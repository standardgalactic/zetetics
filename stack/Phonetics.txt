Phonetics
A problem-based introduction to phonetics, with 300+ exercises integrated into the
text to help the student discover and practise the subject interactively. It assumes no
previous knowledge of the subject and highlights and explains new terms and concepts
when they are ﬁrst introduced. Graded review questions and exercises at the end of every
unit help the student monitor their own progress and further practise new skills, and
there is frequent cross-referencing for the student to see how the subject ﬁts together,
and how later concepts build on earlier ones. The book highlights the differences between
speech and writing in Unit 1 and covers all the essential topics of a phonetics course.
An accompanying website (www.cambridge.org/knight) features audio samples and
answers to selected exercises.
RACHAEL-ANNE KNIGHT is Senior Lecturer in Phonetics in the Department of
Language and Communication Science at City University London.

PREFACE
This book details a fairly traditional view of articulatory phonetics, and some
related aspects of phonology. Our focus throughout is on English phonetics, as
English is the language of instruction, and the one with which all readers will
therefore be familiar. Aspects of general phonetic theory are illustrated using
examples from English, and supported by other languages where appropriate.
We begin in Section 1 with a concentration on individual speech sounds, think
about how sounds combine into words in Section 2, and ﬁnish in Section 3 with
phenomena that occur when words are combined into longer stretches of
speech.
The book is aimed at students with no prior knowledge of phonetics or
linguistics; therefore, new terminology is emboldened and explained when it is
ﬁrst introduced. The book is suitable for ﬁrst-year undergraduates studying
subjects such as linguistics or speech and language therapy, and may also be
used for revision by more advanced students. It would certainly be possible for
students to teach themselves a good deal of phonetics using this coursebook.
However, as phonetics is the study of speech, discussion with a tutor, who can
demonstrate particular sounds and clarify any variant aspects of pronunciation,
is sometimes recommended in the text. The book may also be used in class, with
students working through the exercises either before or during contact hours.
Whether used alone, with a tutor or in a class, the units should be attempted in
order. Each unit builds on the last, and it is assumed that all previous units have
been completed at each stage.
The aim of this book is to encourage students to think for themselves
in order to discover facts about phonetics. One of my favourite textbooks
as a student was Rowntree’s Statistics without Tears: An Introduction for
Non-mathematicians, so I was very happy to be asked to produce something
along similar lines for phonetics. The book is formed of a large number of
exercises which involve saying words and phrases, transcribing written material
or simply thinking about particular issues. Exercises are there for students to
discover particular aspects of phonetic content, and not simply to practise what
has gone before in the text. This means that all the exercises within a unit should
be considered compulsory. Students should attempt each exercise in full
before reading the comment section that follows. And, as the comment sections
xv

not only give answers to the exercises, but introduce new concepts and termi-
nology, they should also be read in full. At the end of each unit there are review
questions and review exercises. These are optional, but allow students to
measure their own progress. Answers to the review exercises are found at the
back of the book, while answers to the review questions can be checked by
looking back through the relevant unit.
As in any textbook, there are a number of aspects that cannot be covered due
to space limitations. In particular, this book is conﬁned largely to articulatory
rather than acoustic phonetics, because I have found that students seem better
able to grasp articulatory aspects ﬁrst, and then to apply these to acoustics.
Likewise, decisions have to be made about how to present certain elements, such
as when to introduce slash and square brackets, and whether to use terms such
as ‘phonemic’ or ‘broad’ transcription. In every such case, I have relied on my
teaching experience, and on the advice of my friends and colleagues, in order to
present things in the clearest way for beginning students. I hope that this book
will stimulate students to enjoy phonetics and go on to further study in this
exciting area. To this end, some ideas for further study are suggested in the
resources section.

Preface

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Any textbook is a synthesis and amalgamation of ideas, and not just the work
of the person named on the cover. As such, I am indebted to many previous
teachers of phonetics (some of whom are named below), and I would like to
make a general acknowledgement of teaching materials and lecture handouts at
University College London (UCL) and City University London, which have no
doubt inﬂuenced several sections of this book. I would also like to acknowledge
the resources that I have consulted most frequently while preparing the
manuscript. They are Patricia Ashby’s Speech Sounds, Alan Cruttenden’s
Gimson’s Pronunciation of English, David Abercrombie’s Elements of General
Phonetics, John Wells’s Longman Pronunciation Dictionary, and Trask’s
Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology. I have also relied on the Handbook of
the International Phonetic Association, and, in particular, have borrowed
examples from the illustrations of Thai, Chinese, Hungarian, Catalan, Hebrew,
German, French, Hindi and Swedish. In addition, the Speech Internet
Dictionary at UCL has been extremely useful.
I would also like to thank the following individuals for helping directly and
indirectly over the course of this project.
My teachers at Roehampton University, UCL and Cambridge, for teaching
me not only what to present, but how to deliver it so that students feel nurtured,
encouraged and inspired to know more. In particular, Judith Broadbent, Ishtla
Singh, Sarah Barrett Jones, Jill House, Sarah Hawkins and Francis Nolan.
My colleagues in the phonetics world, particularly those on the Summer
Course in English Phonetics in 2004 and 2005, for showing me new ways to
teach and explain things. In particular, Jane Setter, Michael and Patricia Ashby,

UNIT 1 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPEECH
AND WRITING
1.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
* discover what phonetics is all about
* explore the relationship between sound and spelling
* ﬁnd out how to count the number of sounds in a word
* learn how to divide sounds up into vowels and consonants.
1.2 Introduction
When most of us think about language and speech, we tend to think about the
way words are written. Because we spend so much time learning to read and
spell, and are constantly told how important spelling is, we often focus on
spelling rather than on speech or sound.
However, this book is about phonetics, the study of speech sounds. This
means that throughout this book we will be thinking about the way humans
produce speech, and what speech sounds like, rather than the written form of
language. We are going to start in this section of the book by thinking about
individual sounds, build up to see how sounds vary in words, and, in the ﬁnal
section, look at the things that can happen when words are put together in
sentences.
In fact, one of the most important things to do in the study of phonetics is to
realise that sound and spelling are very different things. As we will see in this
unit, spelling is often a poor guide to a word’s pronunciation.
1.3 Writing systems and pronunciation
Different languages use different types of writing. The system of Egyptian
hieroglyphics was based on using a picture or symbol (known as an ideogram,
pictogram or logogram) to represent most words. Logograms look like the
object represented, so possible logograms for the words ‘book’ and ‘leg’ could
be those shown in Figure 1.1. However, logograms do not give any clues to the
way the word is pronounced (although in the hieroglyphic system other
3

symbols did help with pronunciation). Therefore, this type of system (known as
a meaning-based or logographic system) requires thousands of symbols in
order to represent all the words in a language. Most purely logographic systems
have now died out, but many Chinese characters are logograms, modiﬁed over
the years to look quite different now to the objects they represent.
In contrast, sound-based or alphabetic writing systems do try to represent
the pronunciation of each word. However, some languages represent sounds
more consistently in their spelling systems than others. In some languages, like
Italian, a word’s spelling corresponds more or less exactly to its pronunciation.
In Italian, the word for book is libro, and leg is gamba, where all the letters are
pronounced with a fairly consistent value (although even here there is not a
strict, one-to-one correspondence of sound and letter).
However, this letter-to-sound consistency is less the case in English, as we
can see just by looking at the two words we have used above. The <b> in ‘book’
can be silent in other words like ‘debt’; the <oo> makes a different sound in
‘food’ in most accents; and the <k> can be silent in words like ‘knight’. Similarly
for ‘leg’, the <l> can be silent in words like ‘calf’; the <e> can make a different
sound in words like ‘pretty’; and the <g> can make a different sound in words
like ‘George’. Because the English language has been inﬂuenced by many other
languages throughout its history, and because all languages change over time,
the English spelling system is not always a good guide to pronunciation. Of
course, English words usually give a fair indication of at least part of a word’s
pronunciation, which is why we can read aloud words that are new to us, but
there are also many inconsistencies, which we will now investigate.
Note that angled brackets < > surround letters; we will look at more types of
brackets as we work through the book.
1.3.1 Many sounds to one letter
Exercise 1.1 Let us have a look at the following list of words. Focus on the letter <c> in each
one. What sound does the <c> represent in each word?
Figure 1.1 Example logograms for ‘book’ and ‘leg’
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
4

face
cherub
control
duck
much
city
Remember not to read on to the ‘comment’ section below until you have
completed the exercise in full.
Comment In ‘face’ and ‘city’ the <c> represents a sound like that at the start of ‘sun’. In
‘duck’ and ‘control’ it represents a different sound, like that at the start of
‘kitchen’. In ‘cherub’ and ‘much’ it is joined by <h> to make yet a third sound,
like that at the start and end of ‘church’. The same letter can therefore represent
different sounds in different words.
1.3.2 Many letters to one sound
Exercise 1.2 Now let us think about the opposite situation: how one sound can be repre-
sented by several different letters or combinations of letters.
a)
Think about the sound made by the word ‘I’ (the pronoun referring to
‘me’).
b)
Now think of several other words containing the same sound as the word
‘I’, and see how that sound is spelt in each case.
Tip You may want to think ﬁrst about words that rhyme with ‘I’ to get you started.
Comment Words might include ‘pie’, ‘cry’, ‘nine’, ‘high’, ‘buy’, ‘Tyne’. Note that they are
all spelt differently from ‘I’, even though they contain the same sound. In
particular, the word ‘eye’ sounds identical to ‘I’, but is spelt differently.
So, we have seen that one complication of English spelling is that sounds and
letters do not have a one-to-one correspondence. The same letter can represent
different sounds, and the same sound can be represented by many different
letters, and letter combinations, in different words.
1.3.3 Silent and double letters
Many English words also include silent letters in their spelling, as we suggested
above. Words like ‘knight’ have a silent <k> and start with the same sound as
‘Nan’, rather than with the same sound as ‘king’. Words like ‘psychology’ and
‘pterodactyl’ have a silent <p> at the start, and many other letters can be silent.
In addition, many English words contain double letters, and we will now think
about how these are pronounced.
Exercise 1.3 Let us think about the following words that contain double letters. Say each
of the words below. When you come to the part of each word represented by
the double letters, listen carefully and work out if you hear two of the same
sound. You may like to practise this with someone else and try to work out what
you hear.

Comment In each case, the double letter only corresponds to one sound within the word
(double letters can actually affect the way the previous vowel is pronounced, but
this is not important to the current point). Again, we can see that there is no
direct match between spelling and sound.
1.4 Letters and sounds
One of the key skills for a phonetician (a person who knows about and uses
phonetics) is to divide a word into its individual sounds, which are also referred
to as segments. Speech is a continuous and dynamic process, but, for conven-
ience, we can think about splitting it up into smaller sections consisting of
individual sounds. This is rather similar to dividing up a movie into a number of
still images or snapshots.
Think about the words ‘dog’ and ‘cat’. Each of these contains three letters
and also three sounds or segments.
The sounds into which each word can be divided are as follows:
‘dog’: d as in ‘doughnut’, o as in ‘off’, and g as in ‘goat’.
‘cat’: c as in ‘camel’, a as in ‘and’, and t as in ‘table’.
As we have just seen in the previous section, however, spelling can be mis-
leading, as there is not always a simple match between sounds and letters.
Exercise 1.4 Each of the words below contains three letters, but how many sounds are there
in each word?
Take each word and try to break it down into the smallest parts possible,
then count how many parts there are. Remember that we are thinking about the
way the word sounds, not how it is spelt.
lie
the
eye
owe
emu
fox
pit
try
Tip It may help to cover up each word as you work on it, so that you are not
distracted by the spelling.
Comment ‘Owe’ and ‘eye’ both have only one sound. You may disagree, as you can feel your
mouth moving somewhat, but these words do only contain one sound, as we will
discuss in Unit 6. ‘Lie’ and ‘the’ both have two sounds; ‘pit’ and ‘try’ have three.
‘Emu’ has four for some speakers, but three if you do not pronounce a sound like
that at the startof ‘yogurt’afterthe ‘m’sound. ‘Fox’ also has four sounds, as the <x>
letter represents two sounds: a sound like that at the start of ‘kite’, followed by one
like that at the start of ‘socks’. In fact, if we think about the sounds at the end of ‘fox’
and ‘socks’, we can hear they are the same, even though the spelling is different.

Exercise 1.5 Now let us look at these words. First of all, count the letters, and then try to work
out how many sounds each word contains.
tough
bud
ex-
beige
cup
love
ox
buff
Comment Hopefully, you have found that all these words contain three sounds, despite
containing between two and ﬁve letters. For example, the <gh> at the end of
‘tough’ represents only a single sound, as does <ff> at the end of ‘buff’. <e> at
the end of ‘love’ does not represent a sound at all, as demonstrated by the
popular spelling <luv> that we use all the time in texts and emails.
As we can see, the number of written letters in a word does not always tell
us how many sounds a word contains. Therefore, when thinking about
phonetics, it will be very important not to think about the spelling of a word
when we want to think about its sounds.
We have seen in the previous exercises that spelling and sound are
separate. In fact, we can think of them as two separate levels for analysis.
The technical term for the level of spelling is the orthographic level. The
technical name for the sound level is the phonetic or phonemic level. We
will discuss the difference between phonetic and phonemic much later on in
this book.
1.4.1 Homographs and homophones
Another example of how the orthographic (spelling) and sound levels are
separate comes from the existence of homographs and homophones.
Homographs are words that sound different but are spelt the same. For
example, ‘polish’ may mean ‘furniture polish’ or refer to a person or thing that
comes from Poland. These homographs are used to great effect in an episode of
One Foot in the Grave, a BBC sitcom from the 1990s: Victor spends a long time
looking for sherry from Poland because Margaret has not left enough space
between ‘polish’ (meaning furniture polish) and ‘sherry’ on the shopping list.
Of course, this could not have happened if she had read the list out, as the two
meanings of ‘polish’ sound different.
Homophones, on the other hand, are words that sound the same but are
spelt differently. For example ‘dough’ and ‘doe’, and ‘cue’ and ‘queue’ are
homophones for all English speakers. There are other cases, however, where a
person’s accent will determine whether a pair of words are homophones or not,
as we will see in Exercise 1.6.
It can sometimes be difﬁcult to remember the meanings of homophone and
homograph, and sometimes students get them confused, but knowing the
origins of these words can help. Homo- comes from the Greek, meaning ‘the
same’ (as in homogeneous), and we will use it for another term later on in this
UNIT 1 The difference between speech and writing
7

book. ‘graph’ is also from the Greek, meaning ‘writing’ (as in autograph), as is
‘phone’, which means ‘sound’ (as in telephone and phonetics). So words that
are homographs have the same writing (spelling), and words that are homo-
phones have the same sound.
Exercise 1.6 As we have said above, some words may not be homophones in all accents. Let
us see if the following pairs of words are homophones for you (that is, do you
pronounce them the same?). It would also be useful for you to ask a friend from
a different part of the country or the world for their opinion.

Comment 1
For most speakers of Southern English, the ﬁrst pair does not sound
the same. ‘Luck’ is pronounced with the same vowel as ‘strut’, while
‘look’ has the same vowel as ‘foot’. For most speakers of Northern
English, both will be pronounced with the same vowel as ‘foot’, so
they are homophones. However, speakers from certain parts of the
north, such as Lancashire, may pronounce ‘look’ with the same vowel
as ‘goose’, and ‘luck’ with the same vowel as ‘foot’ so they are not
homophones.
2
The second pair will be homophones for most speakers, although Scottish
and Irish speakers may produce the ﬁrst sounds differently, with the ﬁrst
sound of ‘which’ having a more whistling or hissing quality.
3
The third pair will be the same for many speakers, but many North
American speakers, as well as those from Scotland, Ireland or the West
Country, will produce an ‘r’ sound at the end of the second word.
4
The fourth pair will sound different for most speakers of British English, but
may be homophones for speakers of Scottish English or some varieties of
North American English.
5
The ﬁfth pair will be pronounced the same for the majority of speakers,
regardless of their accent.
1.5 Accents
Later on in this book, in Unit 14, we will be discussing regional accents in a
bit more detail. However, it is important to say at this point that the way a
person pronounces a word will vary according to where they were born, grew up
and live, as well as their ‘social class’. Their age may also be an important factor,
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
8

as might the situation in which they are speaking. This book will work
most often with an accent of English known as Standard Southern British
English (SSBE). This is the pronunciation used by many people on television
and radio, and by many university lecturers and teachers. It is basically the
pronunciation of fairly educated speakers in the South East of England. It is not
quite the pronunciation used by the British royal family, or by those who
have attended a public school. We will refer to that pronunciation, which is used
by around 3 per cent of the population of England, as Received
Pronunciation (RP).
Many people will ﬁnd that their pronunciation is similar to SSBE in many
respects. However, we must also recognise that not everyone speaks SSBE, so
exercises and examples will try to comment on accent variation where possible.
It is also crucial to point out that this book does not recommend any
particular pronunciation or accent. The aim of this book, and of phonetics in
general, is to describe what occurs in any accent, rather than to prescribe what
should occur. SSBE is used as a convenient reference, as it is the accent with
which the majority of the English-speaking population are familiar (at least
through television and radio), and the accent to which many non-native
learners aspire.
1.6 Introduction to transcription – consonants and vowels
One of the key skills of a phonetician is transcription. As we have seen, spelling
cannot tell us unambiguously how a word should be pronounced.
Transcription, therefore, provides us with a shared system of symbols that only
ever refer to one sound and that allow us to write down pronunciation clearly
and consistently. We will begin to look at these symbols in the next unit. For
now, let us start to do some transcription by thinking about a major division in
speech sounds: vowels versus consonants. Again, it is important not to think
about spelling, as the terms ‘consonant’ and ‘vowel’ mean something different
when we are discussing spoken language. In spelling, for example, we use
twenty-one consonants, but in spoken English we use around twenty-four
depending on our accent. Likewise, in spelling we use ﬁve vowels, but in spoken
English we use around twenty.
We will consider the differences between consonants and vowels in detail in
later units. In brief, though, spoken consonants are sounds made with a lot of
constriction in the mouth, so that the air coming up from the lungs gets
squashed. Consonant sounds also tend to occur at the start and end of syllables –
for example, like those at the beginning and end of the words ‘dog’, ‘cat’, ‘pen’
and ‘tub’. Vowels, on the other hand, are sounds made with the mouth quite
open, and they occur in the middle of syllables. For example, the sounds in the
middle of the words in the previous list are all vowels. Vowels can also occur in
UNIT 1 The difference between speech and writing
9

isolation: the words ‘eye’, ‘are’ (for SSBE speakers) and ‘owe’ all consist of single
vowel sounds, without any consonants surrounding them.
1.7 CV structures
We can begin to think about transcription by noting down the sounds in a word
as either C for consonant or V for vowel. For example, ‘dog’, ‘cat’, ‘pen’ and
‘tub’ can all be represented as CVC, since they start and end with a consonant
and have a vowel in the middle. Words like ‘eye’, ‘are’ and ‘owe’, in contrast,
are all represented as V, since they only contain one vowel sound.
Exercise 1.7 What are the CV structures of the following words? It may help you to try to
count the sounds in each word ﬁrst, and to remember not to think about the
spelling.
glass
think
hatch
ﬂute
robber
ring
Comment ‘Glass’ is CCVC, as the double letter <s> represents only one sound. ‘Think’ is
CVCC, as the <th> letters represent a single sound. ‘Flute’ is CCVC, as the <e>
at the end is silent (and tells us only to make the <u> a long sound). ‘Hatch’ is
CVC, as <tch> at the end of the word represents only a single sound. ‘Ring’ is
either CVC or CVCC, depending on your regional accent. Most English accents
do not pronounce the <g> at the end of ‘ring’, but accents of Birmingham and
surrounding areas may do. Finally, ‘robber’ is either CVCV or CVCVC. The
double <b> only represents one sound, but accents vary as to whether they
pronounce the ﬁnal <r>, as we will explore now.
1.8 Rhotic and non-rhotic accents
Some speakers pronounce an ‘r’ sound at the end of words like ‘robber’ (as in
the previous exercise), and some speakers do not. This is largely down to the
speaker’s regional accent. Speakers who do pronounce an ‘r’ in this position are
called rhotic speakers, and will always pronounce an <r> whenever it occurs in
the spelling of a word. Others will only pronounce an ‘r’ sound when the letter
<r> occurs at the beginning or in the middle of a word, that is, in front of a
vowel. These speakers are referred to as non-rhotic speakers. People who come
from the West Country in England, Ireland, Scotland and parts of the United
States are likely to be rhotic, whereas those from Australia, London and the
South East, and northern parts of England are likely to be non-rhotic – thus
SSBE is non-rhotic.
Exercise 1.8 It would be useful to take some time now to think about whether you pronounce
an ‘r’ sound in words like ‘car’. This can be confusing, as the spelling
suggests that there must be an ‘r’ sound. However, consider if your tongue stays
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
10

still after the vowel. If it does, then you speak with a non-rhotic accent; if it does
not, and you raise the tip or middle of your tongue, then you speak with a rhotic
accent.
Comment Rhoticity will be mentioned at several points in the book, as it is one of the
major divisions between accents of English. If you are unsure about whether you
speak with a rhotic accent or not, it would be useful to ask a phonetics teacher to
help you decide.
1.8.1 The history and status of ‘r’
In past times, all speakers in England would have been rhotic and would have
pronounced an ‘r’ at the end of words like ‘robber’ and ‘car’, and it is this
pronunciation that was taken to America on the Mayﬂower. However, the
rhotic pronunciation was subsequently lost in most of England, and therefore
did not travel to Australia with the colonists.
Now the pronunciation of ‘r’ at the end of words is sometimes a matter for
social comment. People in the UK often focus on this feature in West Country
speech, and associate rhotic pronunciations with people who have traditional
country professions, such as farming. The situation in North America is
rather different, as it can be seen as prestigious to speak with a rhotic accent,
the opposite situation to that in the UK. This disparity demonstrates that
there is nothing inherently prestigious or otherwise about a particular
pronunciation; it is the views of the speech community that give a sound or
accent its status. The ‘r’ sound, in particular, has a very interesting history in
English (and in other languages) that we will touch on at various points
throughout this book.
1.9 More CV structures
Exercise 1.9 The following words are longer than those in Exercise 1.7. Try to produce CV
structures for them.
Jupiter
haricot
television
elephant
necessary
Comment ‘Jupiter’ is CVCVCV for non-rhotic speakers or CVCVCVC for rhotic speak-
ers. ‘Haricot’ is CVCVCV, as the ﬁnal <t> is silent. ‘Television’ is
CVCVCVCVC, as the two vowels <io> represent a single sound. An alternative
pronunciation for ‘television’ is or CVCVCVCC. Speakers vary as to whether
they produce a vowel before the ﬁnal sound in words such as ‘television’ and
‘puddle’. If there is no vowel, then the ﬁnal sound is referred to as syllabic. We
will return to this idea later, when we think about syllabic consonants (in Unit 8),
UNIT 1 The difference between speech and writing
11

but for now either answer is ﬁne. ‘Elephant’ is VCVCVCC, as the <ph>
represents only one sound. However, as for ‘television’, some speakers may
not produce a vowel between the <ph> and the <n>, making the structure
VCVCCC. ‘Necessary’ is CVCVCVCV, as the double <s> only represents one
sound.
You may have noticed that often C and V sounds alternate, and this is
a common pattern in most of the world’s languages. In fact, nearly all
languages have words that are either CV or CVCV in structure. In
addition, CV is often the pattern that young children (in most languages)
produce ﬁrst, as we see if we look at a child’s typical ﬁrst words (mummy,
daddy, doggy, and so on). However, (adult) English is relatively unusual in the
languages of the world because it allows several consonants to occur together
in a cluster, so we can have structures like CCVCC, as we will explore further
in Unit 8.
Exercise 1.10 Let us decide which of the following words start with a spoken vowel and which
with a consonant. We need to remember that just because a word starts with a
written consonant or vowel, this does not necessarily mean it starts with a
spoken consonant or vowel.
honour
unicorn
horse
yellow
ewe
umbrella
weather
Comment ‘Honour’ and ‘umbrella’ start with vowels; the rest begin with consonants.
Sounds like those at the start of ‘yellow’ and ‘weather’ may feel a bit like
vowels because the mouth is quite open. As we will see later, they are
pronounced very much like vowels, but we will continue to call them
consonants because they occur at the same place in the syllable as other
consonants (at the start and end), as we will explore later in Unit 8. It may
be hard to feel any restriction in airﬂow for the ﬁrst sound in ‘horse’, because
the restriction occurs in the throat, rather than in the mouth, as we will see
in Unit 3.
1.10 Summary
In this unit we have looked at the differences between spoken and written
languages, and seen that the English writing system does not have a one-to-one
relationship between spelling and sound. We have learnt to count the sounds in
words, and seen a basic distinction between spoken vowels and consonants,
based on the openness of the mouth.

UNIT 2 CONSONANT VOICING
2.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
* see that voicing (or the lack of voicing) is one of the key features referring
to consonants
* explore how the vocal folds are relevant for voicing
* learn the symbols used for the transcription of Standard Southern British
English consonants.
2.2 Introduction
In the last unit we discussed the division of speech sounds into vowels and
consonants. We decided that vowels are sounds produced with the mouth quite
open and that consonants are produced with a more closed mouth. We also saw
that vowels occur in the middle of syllables, while consonants occur around the
edges. Our aim in this unit, as well as in the next two units, is to think about
three principal components of consonants. We will describe their voicing in this
unit and then look at their place and manner of articulation in the following two
units, before moving on to vowels.
2.3 Speech production
Exercise 2.1 To start with, let us have a think about how humans produce speech.
a)
Which parts of our body do you think are involved in the process of making
speech sounds?
b)
How can we make different sounds?
Comment a)
You have probably mentioned parts of the mouth (tongue, lips and teeth)
and possibly internal organs, such as the lungs and the brain.
b)
You may also have noted that different sounds are produced by
altering the position of the mouth, ideas that we will now explore in
detail.
15

There are a large number of body parts involved in speaking. Aside from
anything else, we need our brain to plan words and sentences and to send
appropriate signals to the rest of our body. However, the activity of the brain is
beyond the scope of this book and we will not consider it further here. Instead,
we will focus on the parts of the body between the lips and nose and the lungs.
These body parts are labelled in Figure 2.1, and we will look at the other,
non-labelled, structures in more detail shortly.
2.3.1 The necessity of air
It will become clear as we work through this book that air is required in order to
produce any speech sound. We hear sound when some medium (usually air) is
set into vibration. Even the sounds of ringing crystal glasses or music played
through an MP3 player involve air set into vibration. Sound then travels as
waves through the air until it reaches our eardrums, where the vibrations are
passed to the inner ear and are eventually turned into electronic signals, which
are sent to our brains.
Sound can travel through other media too, but will travel at different speeds
than if it is travelling though air. This is why things sound different when you
put your head under water, where sound can travel more quickly than in air. It is
also why, in westerns, you sometimes see people listen for horses’ hooves by
putting their ears to the ground. As sound travels more quickly through solids,
the sound of hooves will be heard in the earth before it is heard in the air. Thus,
sound needs a material to travel through and for that material to be set into
vibration. In speech, we usually set air into vibration.
In producing most speech sounds, including all the sounds used regularly in
English, the air we use comes from the lungs. This air travels up from the lungs,
passing through the trachea (windpipe), until it reaches the larynx, where it

16

might be set into vibration. The larynx is commonly known as the voice box,
and the front of the larynx is the protrusion that can be felt in the front of the
neck, which is called the Adam’s apple in men. The air passes through the
larynx into the vocal tract, which is the air passages of the head and neck.
What happens in the vocal tract will be the focus of the following three units.
Our major concern in this unit is with what happens at the level of the vocal
folds, which lie inside the larynx. In order to imagine where the vocal folds are,
it is helpful to imagine that a person has had their head chopped off and you are
looking down into their neck. From above, you might then be able to see the
vocal folds as two strings of tissue arranged in a V-shape, with the point of the
V at the front.
2.3.2 Vibration of the vocal folds
The vocal folds do not stay in the same position all the time. A person can either
keep the vocal folds wide apart (known as keeping them abducted), as happens
during normal breathing, or shut them completely (known as keeping them
adducted), as happens when coughing. When they are shut, they block the ﬂow
of air from the lungs, as happens when we hold our breath. During speech, the
folds can either be kept far apart, as in Figure 2.2, or they can be narrowed, as
shown in Figure 2.3, so that they vibrate when air from the lungs passes through
them. As we said above, sound is produced when air is made to vibrate, and the

vibration of the vocal folds is one of the major ways in which we make our
speech audible.
It is important to understand that the speaker does not use muscles
to open and close the folds for every cycle of the vibration. Instead,
muscles are used to narrow them by just the right amount, so that
aerodynamic constraints take over and they vibrate in the airstream from
the lungs (if you are interested in acoustic phonetics, you may be
familiar with the term ‘Bernoulli effect’, which describes how this
happens).
2.4 Voiced and voiceless sounds
In the most basic terms, a sound produced while the vocal folds are vibrating
is called a voiced sound. A sound produced while the folds are not vibrating
is called a voiceless sound. All vowels are voiced, as we will see later in this
book, but consonants can be either voiced or voiceless. Voiceless sounds
usually have the vocal folds wide apart, or, for a few sounds, they may be tightly
closed.
There are various ways to tell if sounds are voiced or voiceless. The ﬁrst is to
feel the larynx with the ﬁngers while producing a sound. Vibrations can be felt
quite easily for some voiced sounds. A second way is to cover your ears while
producing a sound and see if you can hear a buzz, which indicates that vocal fold
vibration (voicing) is present.
Exercise 2.2 a)
In the pairs below, one word starts with a voiced consonant and the other
with a voiceless consonant. Think about the initial consonants of each
word. Say them out loud and try to work out if they are voiced (with vocal
fold vibration) or voiceless (with no vibration).
zip / sip
fault / vault
coven / govern
dense / tense
Tip Remember to isolate the consonant rather than trying to say the whole word,
and remember to say the sounds out loud. If you whisper, this will not work, as
whispering never produces vocal fold vibration.
b)
Were some of these pairs easier to work out than others? Why do you think
that might be?
Comment a)
The words beginning with voiced consonants are ‘zip’, ‘vault’, ‘govern’
and ‘dense’.
b)
The ﬁrst two pairs tend to be easier to work out, partly because the
consonant sounds are longer, giving you more time to focus on whether or

not you feel vibrations. We will talk more about this in Unit 4; we
will also see other reasons why some sounds are harder to categorise
than others when we start to think about allophones of voicing in
Unit 9.
2.5 Symbols for English consonants
As we mentioned in the last unit, phoneticians have an array of special symbols
with which they can write down, or transcribe, the pronunciation of words and
sounds.
These are the symbols for the voiceless consonants of SSBE, with an example
word to show where each sound occurs.
*
/p/ as in pig
*
/f/ as in fun
*
/θ/ as in theory
*
/s/ as in soon
*
/ʃ/ as in ship
*
/t/ as in tank
*
/k/ as in kind
*
/h/ as in home
*
/tʃ/ as in cherub
And these are the symbols for the voiced consonants.
*
/b/ as in bent
*
/v/ as in vole
*
/ð/ as in they
*
/z/ as in Zen
*
/ʒ/ as in pleasure
*
/d/ as in dale
*
/ɡ/ as in grind
*
/m/ as in mail
*
/n/ as in nail
*
/˛/ as in sang
*
/dʒ/ as in June
*
/l/ as in lull
*
/r/ as in red
*
/j/ as in yogurt
*
/w/ as in went
Exercise 2.3 Let us have a look at the symbols above for voiced and voiceless consonants.
Try to work out:
UNIT 2 Consonant voicing
19

a)
which ones look familiar and seem to represent the right sound
b)
which ones look like they should represent a different sound
c)
which ones look unfamiliar – that is, not like letters of the English alphabet
d)
which letters of the alphabet are missing
e)
why they all have / / round them.
Comment a)
These symbols are all part of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA),
which aims to provide a separate symbol for every meaningful sound in
every language of the world. The alphabet has been through many
incarnations since the nineteenth century. Many of the symbols will be
familiar to you (probably /p f s t k h b v z d ɡ m n l r w/), and seem to
represent the same sound as in English spelling. This is because many of the
authors of the alphabet were European and drew on symbols used in the
spelling of their native languages. Other symbols, however, were added
when needed.
b)
The most confusing consonant symbol for English speakers is probably /j/.
Weareused tothis symbolbeing usedinspelling torepresent thesound atthe
start of ‘July’ and ‘Judy’. However, in many other languages ‘j’ is used to
represent a sound like that at the start of ‘young’, which is also its IPA usage.
c)
The unfamiliar symbols are probably /θ ʃ tʃ ð ʒ ˛ tʃ/ and /dʒ/. /ð/ was an
Old English character call ‘eth’. /ʒ/ was a character called yogh, and
represents a different sound to /z/, even though some people write the letter
<z> using this symbol. /θ/ is Greek, known as theta. /˛/, sometimes known
as ‘eng’, and /ʃ/, known as ‘esh’ were used by Pitman in an alphabet that
was a precursor to the IPA. /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ are both combinations of other
symbols, for reasons that will become clear in Unit 4.
d)
You might expect to see symbols like /c/ and /q/. These symbols do not
represent any English sounds, but we will meet them later when we talk
about other languages. As we saw in the previous unit, the letter <c> can
represent a number of sounds. Sounds normally written as <c> can be
transcribed with /k/ in words like ‘can’ and /s/ in words like ‘ice’. <qu>, as
in ‘queen’, is transcribed as /kw/.
e)
Slash brackets round the symbols are used to tell us that the symbols
represent sounds, just as <> is used to indicate letters. It is important,
therefore, that we always include brackets to indicate whether we are
notating sounds or spelling.
Exercise 2.4 Look at the bold consonants in each word below.

b)

SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols

Tip To complete the exercises, remember to isolate the consonants from the rest of
the word that is, just say the consonant on its own.
Comment a) and b) ‘Many’ starts with /m/, which is voiced. ‘Feather’ has a voiced /ð/ in
the middle. ‘Check’ starts with /tʃ/, which is voiceless. ‘Bat’ ends with voiceless /
t/, and ‘need’ ends with voiced /d/.
Exercise 2.5 You are now ready to begin transcribing! Of course, we have only introduced
the symbols for the consonants, so just use V in place of any vowel sounds
for now. All the following are breeds of dog, and the words get longer and
harder as you go along.
pug
afghan
terrier
rottweiler
chihuahua
Tip You may want to work out a CV structure ﬁrst, and, as always, do not be fooled
by the spelling.
Comment ‘pug’ is /pVɡ/, an easy one to start with. ‘Afghan’ is /VfgVn/. ‘Terrier’ is
/tVrVVr/ for rhotic speakers and without the ﬁnal /r/ for non-rhotic speak-
ers. Do not be thrown by the double <r> in the spelling. ‘Rottweiler’ is a
tricky one. Firstly, the double <t> only represents one /t/ sound. Secondly,
some people pronounce the <w> as /w/ and some as /v/ (because this word is
a German place name). Also, there is the issue of rhoticity. Rhotic speakers
will produce a ﬁnal /r/, whereas non-rhotic speakers will not. Any of the
following are acceptable: /rVtvVlV/, /rVtwVlV/, /rVtvVlVr/, /rVtwVlVr/.
‘Chihuahua’ is a great illustration of the contrast between sound and spelling.
Because this dog breed is named after a Mexican state, it is rather different to
most English words. /tʃVwVwV/ would probably be a good transcription for
most speakers.
2.6 The importance of the voicing parameter
As we go through the book, we will see that we need to understand voicing for a
variety of reasons. To begin with, we will look at some typical examples of child
speech that illustrate the importance of voicing.
Exercise 2.6 The transcriptions below are an example of how a young child learning SSBE
might produce words.

Have a look at the words above.
a)
Which sounds does the child produce correctly and which are incorrect?
b)
Can the child produce both voiced and voiceless sounds?
c)
Is the child more accurate at the start or end of words?
d)
How might we describe the patterns present in the child’s speech?
Comment a)
/b/, /k/ and /t/ are always produced correctly. /ɡ/ is pronounced incorrectly.
/d/ is correct on one occasion, but not on the other.
b)
The child shows evidence of producing both voiced (/d b/) and voiceless
(/k t/) sounds.
c)
The child only makes mistakes at the ends of words.
d)
At the end of words, the child can only produce voiceless sounds. This is a
process known as word ﬁnal devoicing. It is common in young children as
their language develops. Interestingly, some languages never allow word-
ﬁnal voiced consonants. Dutch, for example, has identical production for
pairs such as hard (‘hard’) and hart (‘heart’), both with a ﬁnal /t/.
Exercise 2.7 Knowledge of voicing can also help us when we are learning to transcribe. In
written language we add an <s> to most nouns when we want to pluralise them.
Therefore, ‘rat’ becomes ‘rats’ and ‘ram’ becomes ‘rams’. However, things are
not quite so simple in spoken language.
Think about ‘rats’ and ‘rams’. If you make the ﬁnal sound really long in each
case, you should be able to hear that they are different. Listen to the sound and feel
your larynx. What do you notice?
Comment You should be able to hear and feel that the two sounds are different. If you feel
your larynx, you will feel that the sound at the end of ‘rats’ is a voiceless /s/,
whereas the one at the end of ‘rams’ is a voiced /z/. In fact, when a noun ends in
a voiceless sound, like the /t/ in ‘rat’, we pluralise it with voiceless /s/; and when
it ends in a voiced sound, like the /m/ in ‘ram’, we pluralise it with voiced /z/.
(However, you will ﬁnd this does not quite work for words ending in sounds like
/ʃ/, for reasons we will discover in Unit 4.) A similar thing happens with
possessives too, as you will see if you compare the sound made by the <s> in
‘Jack’s’ and ‘John’s’. Do take care, though, to remember that this rule only
works for sufﬁxes (endings that we add to words, such as plurals and posses-
sives). It is perfectly possible to have /s/ following a voiced sound when such
endings are not involved, such as in the word ‘false’ /fVls/.

vibration, and that some are voiceless, without such vibration. We have also
learnt the symbols for transcribing SSBE consonants.

In the next unit we can move on to another feature of consonants (place of
articulation) and begin to introduce sounds from other languages.

UNIT 3 CONSONANT PLACE OF ARTICULATION
3.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
* see how place of articulation (POA) is an important feature of consonants
* learn the names of the articulators
* investigate the role of passive and active articulators.
3.2 Introduction
So far we have focussed our attention on consonants and have decided that
these sounds are produced with more restriction to airﬂow than vowels. We
have also learnt that one of the main ways in which consonants differ from one
another is in terms of their voicing – that is, in terms of whether the vocal folds
are vibrating or not. In this unit we are going to think about another feature of
consonants: place of articulation (POA).
3.3 Articulators
Exercise 3.1 Produce the words ‘May’ and ‘December’ and focus on the initial sound in each
word. Think about which parts of your mouth move when you make each
sound. Be careful to focus only on the /m/ and the /d/. You will just make it hard
for yourself if you try to focus on the whole word at this stage.
Which parts of the mouth can you feel moving? Are the parts of the mouth
that are moving the same for /m/ and /d/, or different?
Tip For this exercise it may help you to use a mirror, or to work with a friend, so that
you can look at each other while you produce sounds.
Comment You will probably have noticed that the lips move for /m/ and that the tip of the
tongue moves for /d/.
In the previous unit we saw that the vocal tract refers to all the passageways
above the larynx through which air can ﬂow when we produce speech. An
articulator is the name given to a part of the vocal tract that can be used to form
a constriction. When we describe consonant production and place of
25

articulation in phonetics, we think about the place in the vocal tract where
there is maximum constriction to airﬂow. There are always two articulators
involved in making this maximum constriction. For /m/, the articulators are the
two lips; for /d/, the articulators are the tip of the tongue and the roof of the
mouth.
The articulators themselves are named using a special set of terminology.
As in most disciplines, we use special names for things that we need to talk
about often and with a high degree of precision.
Figure 3.1 shows the vocal tract in more detail. The names of the articulators
are shown in bold.
Many of the articulators will be familiar to you. For example, the lips and
teeth are parts of our anatomy that we are all familiar with. Some of the other
names may be less familiar. The alveolar ridge, for example, is not a term most
people come across before they study phonetics. However, the alveolar ridge
can be identiﬁed easily as the prominent ridge of hard bone behind the upper
teeth, which you can feel with your tongue. The palate is the hard, bony
surface further back than the alveolar ridge, and the velum is the soft palate,
which is even further back in the mouth. The uvula is the piece of ﬂesh that
hangs down from the back of the velum and can be seen if you open your mouth
and look in the mirror. We have already met the vocal folds in the previous unit.
They can vibrate to produce voicing, as we have seen, or they can be used to
restrict the airﬂow and act as a place of articulation. The space between the vocal
folds is called the glottis.

The tongue is also an articulator and is involved in the production of the
majority of the sounds present in English and other languages. However, in
order to be precise when we talk about articulation, we need to label parts of the
tongue separately. The tip, blade, front and back of the tongue can all be labelled
individually.
You will note that there are also names for the cavities of the vocal tract,
namely the oral cavity and the nasal cavity. These two are joined together, and
joined to the space above the larynx by another space called the pharynx, at the
back of the mouth.
Exercise 3.2 a)
Look in the mirror and try to identify the articulators shown in Figure 3.1.
Which can and can not be seen in the mirror?
b)
Use your tongue to feel the articulators along the upper surface of the
mouth. Start with the upper lip and run your tongue back along the roof of
the mouth. How far back can you go?
Comment a)
The uvula is probably as far back as can be seen in the mirror. The larynx
and vocal folds are inside the body and cannot be seen or felt with the
tongue.
b)
The articulators that can be felt with the tongue vary from person to
person. Most people will be able to use the tongue tip to feel the lips, teeth,
alveolar ridge and hard palate. Depending on the ﬂexibility of the tongue,
you may also be able to feel the velum. The uvula cannot usually be reached
by the tongue, and is responsible for our gag reﬂex – for example, if it is
touched by a toothbrush.
3.3.1 Active and passive articulators
As we have said previously, when we produce consonants we constrict air,
which is usually ﬂowing up from the lungs. To form a constriction we use two
articulators. In the majority of cases, only one articulator moves and this is
called the active articulator. The articulator that it moves towards is called the
passive articulator.
In the examples that we have looked at already, we can identify active and
passive articulators. In /m/ the active articulator is the bottom lip, because it
moves, whereas the passive articulator is the top lip, which the bottom lip moves
towards. For /d/ the active articulator is the tip of the tongue; the passive
articulator is the alveolar ridge.
Exercise 3.3 Think about the sounds at the start of the words below. Remember to isolate
them from the rest of the word. Say them slowly and try to work out which is the
UNIT 3 Consonant place of articulation
27

active and passive articulator for each one. As with the previous exercise, it may
help to look in a mirror.
car
tank
van
lorry
bike
Comment It is worth noting that this is quite a difﬁcult exercise to do. We are not used to
thinking about how we speak or introspecting about our own vocal organs.
However, this will get easier with practice. Have a look at the answers below and
then go back to the exercise to see if you can relate the answers to your own
articulation.
The /k/ in ‘car’ is formed by the back of the tongue (active) moving towards
the velum (passive). /t/ in ‘tank’ and /l/ in ‘lorry’ are both formed in the
same place as /d/, with an active tongue tip and a passive alveolar ridge. /v/ in
‘van’ is formed when the bottom lip approaches the top teeth. /b/ in ‘bike’ is
formed in the same place as /m/, when the bottom lip approaches the top one.
3.4 Places of articulation
Now that we know which articulators are involved in producing sounds, we
have another set of labels to learn. As mentioned above, when we refer to the
place of articulation of consonants, we are describing the place in the vocal tract
where there is the most constriction of airﬂow. The place of articulation is
normally named after the passive articulator. So, a sound formed with the tip of
the tongue approaching the alveolar ridge is said to have an alveolar place of
articulation. /t/, /d/ and /l/, for example, all have the alveolar ridge as the passive
articulator, so are said to have an alveolar place of articulation.
Below are the names of the places of articulation that are used for
consonants in SSBE. They are ordered from the front of the vocal tract towards
the back.

Exercise 3.4 The sounds below are all formed at different places of articulation.
a)
First of all, identify each sound from its symbol and produce it between
vowel sounds (e.g. ‘ah’ /f/ ‘ah’).
b)
Then try to work out which sound is produced at which place of
articulation.

Comment a)
Again, this is quite a difﬁcult exercise to complete as we are not used to
thinking about the position of our articulators. Look at the answers below
and then return to the exercise to see if you can understand why the
answers are as they are.
b)
/h/ is glottal, which is why you cannot feel any constriction in the vocal
tract above the larynx. /p/ and /v/ are fairly easily identiﬁed as bilabial and
labiodental, respectively, especially if you use a mirror. /ʃ/ is postalveolar,
/j/ is palatal, /g/ is velar, /θ/ is dental and /n/ is alveolar.
Below is a list of all the consonants of SSBE (with one exception), ordered by
their POA, extending from the front to the back of the vocal tract.

3.4.1 /w/: a special case
You might have noticed that /w/ does not appear in the list above. This is
because, unlike the other consonants listed, /w/ has two equally important
places of articulation. If you look in the mirror, or at someone else saying /w/,
you will deﬁnitely see some lip movement, which you might think would make
the place of articulation bilabial. However, we know from techniques like
ultrasound, which allow us to see inside the mouth during speech, that the
tongue also moves when we produce /w/. The tongue moves in such a way that
air is constricted between the back of the tongue and the velum. Importantly,
the constrictions at the lips and at the velum are equal in degree. If we took one
away, the sound would no longer be /w/. So we say that /w/ has a labial-velar
UNIT 3 Consonant place of articulation
29

place of articulation. /w/ is an example of a double articulation because it is
produced with equal constriction of airﬂow at two places in the vocal tract.
Exercise 3.5 Work your way through the list of SSBE sounds above, putting each consonant
between ‘ah’ vowels. Concentrate on your articulators and see if you are
convinced that the POA is as given above.
Comment In general, consonants do not vary a great deal between speakers, or even
different accents, of English. We will return to accents in later units, but for now
you should check any difﬁculties with a teacher, if possible.
There are also a couple of other English sounds you need to know about that
we have not yet covered.
3.4.2 Other English consonants
These sounds have not yet been covered for two reasons. Firstly, neither sound
makes a meaning difference in the English language – that is, it occurs as a
version of other sounds without affecting a word’s meaning. Secondly,
especially for the second sound, they are not used by all speakers. We will return
to these sounds in future units too, where these ideas will become clearer.
The ﬁrst sound we need to think about is often referred to as a glottal stop,
which is symbolised as [ʔ] in the IPA. This sound is very common in English,
and tends to occur as a version of /t/ in certain environments, depending on a
person’s accent. In some accents of English, [ʔ] can occur as a version of /t/ only
at the ends of words – for example, many speakers of SSBE might pronounce
‘cat’ as [kVʔ]. For other accents of English, [ʔ] can also occur in the middle of
words. Speakers of Cockney and Glaswegian English, for example, might
pronounce ‘water’ as [wVʔV] (with a ﬁnal /r/ for Glaswegian, as it is a rhotic
accent), but this pronunciation would be unlikely for an RP speaker. When a
speaker uses [ʔ], it is sometimes said that they are they are ‘dropping their ‘t’s’.
In reality, they are just using another version of /t/; /t/ has not been deleted, but
pronounced in a different way, as a glottal stop. Thus, a term for this phe-
nomenon is glottal replacement, or glottalling.
The place of articulation for [ʔ] is glottal, as the name glottal stop suggests,
so the major constriction of air when this sound is produced is made by the
vocal folds. The second part of the name, stop, means that the air is restricted
completely. We will return to this idea in the next unit, on manner of articu-
lation. As the vocal folds are pressed tightly together for the glottal stop, they are
not able to vibrate at the same time, so this sound is voiceless.
Another sound that it is important to know about is [ʋ]. This sound has a
labiodental place of articulation as the air is constricted most by the bottom lip
approaching the top teeth. [ʋ] is often referred to as a labiodental /r/, because
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
30

some speakers of English use [ʋ] as a version of /r/ – for example, at the start of
words like ‘rabbit’ and ‘rhubarb’. Most speakers produce /r/ by constricting the
air between the tip of the tongue and the postalveolar region, which is why we
have described /r/ as postalveolar above. If we want to symbolise this precise
articulation we can use [ɹ]. But an increasing number of speakers are starting to
use [ʋ] in places where other speakers use [ɹ].
[ʋ] may well be familiar to you. People quite often notice if speakers use this
sound as a version of /r/, and might describe the phenomenon as ‘not being able
to say your ‘r’s’. For example, some celebrities, such as Jonathan Ross, Paul
Merton and Bill Oddie, use [ʋ] for /r/. However, note that [ʋ] is not the same as
/w/, which has a labial-velar POA. This is a confusion that has been perpetuated
in the media (for example, Jonathan Ross calls himself ‘wossy’ on Twitter),
presumably because <w> is the closest way to represent the sound of a labio-
dental /r/ using spelling.
Labiodental /r/ has been in the English language for hundreds of years.
However, over the last thirty years or so, more and more speakers have started
to use it. Its use does not seem to be related to any particular accent, but does
tend to be related to age, with more younger speakers favouring it. I use a
labiodental /r/ when I speak, and generally ﬁnd that about 10 to 15 per cent of
my students do too.
Exercise 3.6 In this exercise you will concentrate on your own speech to work out what type
of /r/ you use and when you use glottal stops.
a)
First of all, try this familiar tongue-twister: ‘Round and round the
rugged rock the ragged rascal ran’. As you can see, there are lots of
/r/s in this sentence. Your job is to think about which articulators
you are using to constrict the air when you produce your /r/ sounds. Are
you using your bottom lip to approach your top teeth and therefore
using [ʋ], or is the tip or back of your tongue approaching the roof of your
mouth behind your alveolar ridge to produce [ɹ]? You can look in a
mirror if this helps. You can also make a very long extended /r/ sound at the
start of these words.
b)
Now, think about where you would use a glottal stop. It is extremely
unlikely that you do not use any at all! Does it sound okay for you to use a
glottal stop at the end of words like ‘hit’ and ‘met’ in phrases such as ‘she
hit Sarah’ and ‘she met Sarah’? What about in the middle of words like
‘butter’ or ‘little’?
Comment a)
For the /r/ sounds, be careful not to confuse lip-rounding with labiodental
place of articulation. Many speakers who produce /r/ as [ɹ], using their
tongue and a postalveolar place of articulation, also protrude their lips
UNIT 3 Consonant place of articulation
31

slightly during this sound. For speakers who use labiodental [ʋ], the lip
shape looks rather different (and more like that for /v/ and /f/), as only the
bottom lip moves and it approaches the top teeth rather than protruding.
b)
The likelihood is that you will use glottal stops at least some of the time.
When you use them can depend on your accent and age, who you are
talking to and even the situation you are in. So, it is possible that you might
use glottal stops in the middle of words on some occasions and not others.
Keep this in mind and listen to yourself and others for the next few days, to
see how many you hear.
One ﬁnal comment is that it is absolutely ﬁne to use any of the variants
we have just discussed. Variation is one of the most interesting aspects of the
study of phonetics, and it is certainly not the case that some variants are
correct and others are wrong. Have a listen to the speech of people around
you, on TV and on the radio, and think about the types of variation you
observe. We will return to types of variation and reasons for variation in
Unit 14.
3.5 Brackets
You know by now that spelling is enclosed in angled brackets <> and that speech
sounds are shown in slash brackets, such as /p/ or /t/. However, you will also
have noticed that [ʔ], [ɹ] and [ʋ] are shown in square brackets. Both slash and
square brackets mean that we are referring to sounds rather than letters, and that
we are giving a transcription rather than using spelling. The difference between
slash and square brackets also gives us some extra information, however. We will
cover this in more detail in later units, but will address it brieﬂy now.
When we put a sound in slash brackets we are indicating that the sound
makes a meaningful difference in the language. We can determine that it makes a
meaningful difference by swapping it for another sound. For example, if we take
the word ‘lit’ and change the /t/ for a /p/, we get the word ‘lip’. This word means
something different and indicates that /p/ and /t/ make a meaning difference in
English. However, if we swap /t/ in ‘lit’ for [ʔ], we can hear the difference in
sound, but there is no meaning difference. Likewise, swapping [ɹ] for [ʋ] – for
example, in the word ‘rose’ – will not make a meaning difference, even though
you can hear a difference in articulation and sound. So, if we are only transcribing
meaningful sounds, we use slash brackets. However, if we want to be more precise
about the way those sounds are produced, we can use square brackets. For
example, we can say that /r/ can be produced as either [ɹ] for [ʋ].
So, in simple terms, meaningful sounds go in slash brackets and variants of
sounds go in square brackets. Do not worry if this distinction is confusing at the
moment, as we will go into much more detail later on, particularly in Units 9 and 13.

3.6 The importance of place of articulation
The terms for place of articulation are important, as they let us describe and
compare different types of sound. That is partly what we did above when we
talked about whether people use a postalveolar or labiodental place of
articulation when they produce /r/, for example. We can make the same kind of
comparison when we talk about the speech of children, or the speech that
speech and language therapists hear in the clinic.
Exercise 3.7 Here are some transcriptions of speech produced by ‘Katy’, who is
three years old.
Orthography
Adult
Katy
cap
/tVp/
Meg
/mVd/
ring

a)
First of all, write in the transcription of the adult pronunciation (assuming
SSBE and using V for the vowels).
b)
Then compare the adult pronunciation to Katy’s pronunciation.
c)
Can you ﬁnd a pattern that describes the difference between Katy’s
pronunciations and those of an adult?
d)
Thinking about the pattern you have identiﬁed, how would Katy
pronounce ‘king’?
Comment a)
For SSBE adults, ‘cap’ is /kVp/, ‘Meg’ is /mVɡ/ and ‘ring’ is /rV˛/.
b)
and c) Where the adult uses a velar, Katy uses an alveolar. This is
a pattern called fronting, in which sounds are replaced with ones that
have a place of articulation further towards the front of the mouth.
It is common in young children until the age of around three and
a half years.
d)
Katy would likely produce ‘king’ as /tVn/, fronting both the velars to an
alveolar place of articulation. Thus, she may be difﬁcult to understand, as
‘king’ and ‘tin’ will be pronounced in the same way.
3.7 Non-SSBE places of articulation
So far we have concentrated on the place of articulation of consonant sounds
in SSBE. This is not because SSBE is particularly exciting or special, but because
it is the variety that all readers of this book will probably be familiar with.
Although English has consonants produced at quite a range of places of
UNIT 3 Consonant place of articulation
33

articulation, there are some other places of articulation that are not represented
in Standard Southern British English. Below are some examples of sounds taken
from the Handbook of the International Phonetic Association, which gives
phonetic illustrations for many languages. If you know a speaker of the language
referred to, you could ask them to produce these words for you.
3.7.1 Alveolo-palatal
These sounds are produced with a constriction between the blade of the
tongue and the alveolar ridge and the palatal region. Such sounds occur in
Swedish (at the start of the word kjol, meaning ‘skirt’), for example. They are
symbolised as [ɕ] and [ʑ].
3.7.2 Retroﬂex
Retroﬂex sounds are produced with a constriction between the tongue tip and
the portion of the roof of the mouth where the alveolar ridge meets the hard
palate. Retroﬂex sounds are different to alveolars, or postalveolars, however, in
that the tip of the tongue is curled back so that the underneath of the tongue
forms the constriction. These sounds are common in languages of South Asia,
and are also one of the most noticeable features of Indian accented English. In
Hindi, for example, the ﬁrst sounds in the words for ‘postpone’ (/ʈɑl/) and
‘branch’ (/ɖɑl/) are both retroﬂexes. We have not yet introduced vowels, but the
/ɑ/ sound in these words is rather like the English vowel in ‘car’.
3.7.3 Uvular
Uvular sounds are produced by forming a constriction between the back of the
tongue and the uvula. You may be familiar with the r-like sounds in French
(starting the word roue meaning ‘wheel’) and some varieties of German
(starting the word Rasse, meaning ‘race’), which are produced with a uvular
place of articulation. There are lots of different uvular sounds, symbolised, for
example, [q ɢ ʀ ʁ χ].
3.7.4 Pharyngeal
Pharyngeal sounds are produced by constricting air, either between the walls of
the pharynx or between the back of the tongue and the back wall of the pharynx.
These sounds are found, for example, in ‘Oriental’ Hebrew, such as in the
middle of the word /maˡħar/, meaning ‘tomorrow’, where /a/ is somewhat like
the vowel sound in the English word ‘cat’.

3.8 Summary
In this unit we have seen that consonants differ in place of articulation, which
relates to the place of maximum constriction in the vocal tract. We have also
learnt the names for the articulators.

In the next unit we will see that the degree of airﬂow constriction is
important for our third and ﬁnal consonant feature: manner of
articulation.

UNIT 4 CONSONANT MANNER OF ARTICULATION
4.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
see how manner of articulation (MOA) is another key feature of
consonants
*
investigate how MOA refers to the way air ﬂows in the vocal tract
*
identify the different manners of articulation that occur in English and
other languages.
4.2 Introduction
We have seen that consonants can be described and distinguished by their
voicing and by their place of articulation. In this unit we will look at the third
feature of consonants, manner of articulation (MOA).
4.3 A third feature of articulation
Exercise 4.1 Think about the following sets of consonants. First of all, label them according
to their voicing and place of articulation. Secondly, decide if the consonants in
each set sound the same or different.
a)
/d/ /n/ /l/
b)
/ʒ/ /dʒ/ /r/
c)
/ɡ/ /˛/
d)
/b/ /m/
Comment You should have labelled all the consonants as voiced. In set (a) they are all
alveolar; in set (b) they are all postalveolar; in set (c) they are both velar; and in
set (d) they are bilabial. If this exercise was difﬁcult, you should return to the
previous units in order to learn the labels more thoroughly. You will also have
realised that the sounds in each set do not sound the same.
Because the consonants in each set share the same voicing and POA, but
sound different, this indicates that there must be at least one more feature of
consonants that distinguishes these sounds. This third important feature of
37

consonants is manner of articulation. This feature refers to how the air ﬂows in
the vocal tract. As we know, different sounds are produced by moving different
articulators. We learnt in the last unit that place of articulation (POA) refers to
the place in the vocal tract where there is the greatest constriction to airﬂow.
However, the degree to which the air is constricted is not the same for all
consonants. So POA refers to the place of maximum constriction, but that
maximum constriction may be more or less, depending on the consonant in
question. Manner of articulation is, in part therefore, concerned with the degree
of stricture in the vocal tract, which refers to how close the articulators get
when a sound is formed. For example, they may touch and form a ﬁrm seal, or
approach each other with a small gap for air to escape.
4.4 Manner diagrams
One of the ways we can represent how the articulators move, and different
degrees of structure, is through manner diagrams, like the one in Figure 4.1. In
these diagrams, a line is drawn to represent each articulator, and time is shown
from left to right. In Figure 4.1, the lines indicate that one of the articulators
stays still, while the other one approaches it, touches it for some time, and then
moves away again.
Exercise 4.2 In Figure 4.1, which line do you think represents the active articulator and
which represents the passive articulator?
Comment As you will hopefully remember from the previous unit, the active articulator
is the one that moves, while the passive articulator is the one the active
articulator moves towards. So, in Figure 4.1, the top line is the passive
articulator and the bottom line is the active articulator. For example, the
diagram might represent the sound /t/, where the tongue approaches the
alveolar ridge, touches it brieﬂy and then moves away again. In all the manner
diagrams in this unit, the top line represents the static passive articulator, while
the bottom line shows the movement of the active articulator.

4.5 Manners of articulation used in English
As in previous units, we will start by thinking about the different manners of
articulation used in SSBE. For each one, we will describe the way the articulators
interact, look at a diagram, and think about which sounds in English are
produced with this manner of articulation.
It is important, for each class of manner of articulation, to experiment with
producing the sounds and establish if you can relate your own articulation to
that described.
4.5.1 Plosive
Plosive sounds in English are /p b t d k ɡ/ and [ʔ]. These are actually the sounds
that are represented by the example manner diagram in Figure 4.1, shown again
in Figure 4.2.
Three stages are represented. To begin with, the articulators are in their
resting position, as if a person were breathing normally. Then, if we imagine the
articulation for /p/, for example, the bottom lip approaches the top lip. This is
called the approach phase of a plosive. The bottom lip continues to approach
the top lip until they touch. While they are touching, the air from the lungs
cannot escape and pressure builds up behind the closed lips. This part of the
sequence is termed the hold phase. You may also hear plosives called oral stops,
as the air in the oral cavity is stopped completely. Then the bottom lip moves
away from the top lip, and air escapes rapidly, with the slight popping sound
characteristic of plosives. This is called the release phase. If produced between
vowels, for example, we can say that the plosive has wide oral release, as the
active articulator moves far away from the passive articulator in the release
phase. The same sequence occurs for all the other plosives, but, of course,
different active and passive articulators are involved. You may wish to try to
describe the articulation of an alveolar or velar plosive.
4.5.2 Fricative
Fricative sounds in English are /f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ/.
Exercise 4.3 Try producing the English fricative sounds listed above. Hold each one for a
while, and concentrate on what you can hear. Do the sounds have anything in
common?
Figure 4.2 Manner diagram for a plosive
UNIT 4 Consonant manner of articulation
39

Comment Fricatives are characterised by the hissing sound that can be heard when they
are produced, and this is hopefully what you will have heard when practising
with the sounds above.
The hissing heard in fricatives comes about because the air from the lungs is
escaping through a small gap. The air becomes choppy and turbulent, and
hissing is heard. So, when a fricative is produced, the articulators come close
together, but not so close that they touch (see Figure 4.3). We call this narrow
approximation. The small gap through which the air escapes causes the hissing
noise, just as a small gap in a window can let in a draught, which you might hear
as a whistling noise. It is important to note that the articulators may be touching
at the sides of the mouth, and you can probably feel this if you practise with a
fricative such as /s/ or /f/. There is, however, enough of a gap for air to escape in
the centre of your mouth, and this is where the turbulence occurs.
4.5.3 Approximant and lateral approximant
Approximant sounds in English are /w j l/ and /r/, including both [ɹ] and [ʋ].
Approximant sounds are rather like vowels in some ways. They are produced
with little constriction in the vocal tract, so that air passage is not restricted, as
shown in Figure 4.4. They are formed when the articulators are positioned in
wide approximation, so that the gap between them is not narrow enough to
cause friction. If you go back to our gap in the window example, it might help
you to think about the difference between fricatives and approximants. When a
window is wide open, air can pass in and out freely and does not make a noise.
We only hear the air when it is squeezed through a small gap and becomes
turbulent. So the open window is like an approximant, and the window letting
in a draught is like a fricative. Obviously the analogy is not perfect, because
approximants are audible. However, they are audible because of the vibration of
the vocal folds (as if someone were playing a banjo outside the window), and not
because noise is produced in the mouth.

SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
40

Exercise 4.4 In this exercise we will be trying to demonstrate the different types of airﬂow for
approximants in English.
First of all, put your articulators in the position for /w/. Try to hold them in
this position, but do not try to speak or add any voicing. Now, keeping your
articulators in the same place, breathe in strongly for a few seconds and try to
concentrate on where you feel cold air in your mouth. Do the same for /j/ and
/r/, and ﬁnally for /l/.
Where do you feel cold air in your mouth? Is it on the sides of your tongue or
in the middle? Is it the same for all four sounds?
Comment For /l/, it is likely that you felt cold air on the sides of your tongue, while you
would have felt it in the middle of your tongue for the other sounds. If you are a
labiodental /r/ user, you will probably have felt air in the middle of your lower
lip, as well as in the middle of your tongue.
This experiment demonstrates that /l/ is produced a little differently to the
other approximants. For /w j r / (including both [ɹ] and [ʋ] versions of /r/),
there is an obstruction at the sides of the mouth, which you can feel if you
produce these sounds and hold them for a time. Recall that the articulators are
in wide approximation, and here this refers to what is happening in the
midline of the mouth. To identify the midline, it can help to imagine a line
going from between your top front teeth back to the uvula, dividing the mouth
into the left and right sides. For /l/, the obstruction is in the midline, and when
you produce this sound you can feel the tip of your tongue resting on the
alveolar ridge. The sides of the tongue, however, are lowered and in wide
approximation to the palate. So this type of sound is called a lateral
approximant. Lateral means ‘side’, and the label indicates that the airﬂow is
around the sides of the tongue. All other approximants in English have airﬂow
down the midline of the tongue and are called median approximants, or simply
approximants.
4.5.4 Affricate
Exercise 4.5 To understand how an affricate is formed, try the following. Produce a /t/
sound, followed very quickly by a /ʃ/ sound. What English sound do you hear? It
will not be identical to an English sound, but will sound very close to one. Try
the same with /d/ followed by /ʒ/. The symbols will give you a clue too.
Comment The ﬁrst sounds like /tʃ/, the sound at the start and end of ‘church’, while the
second sounds like /dʒ/, the sound at the start and end of ‘judge’. These are the
only two affricates in English.
UNIT 4 Consonant manner of articulation
41

From Exercise 4.5 you will have identiﬁed that affricate sounds have
elements of plosives and elements of fricatives. In fact, the approach and hold
phase of an affricate is very similar to that of a plosive, in that the articulators
approach and touch, blocking the ﬂow of air completely. It is in the release
phase that there is a difference between plosives and affricates. As you will
remember, for a plosive, the articulators part rapidly and air bursts out from
between them as they move into wide approximation. For an affricate, the
articulators only part narrowly, so that air escapes slowly, becoming turbulent
and making a hissing sound like a fricative.
4.5.5 Nasal
Exercise 4.6 Finally, we will investigate the nasal manner of articulation. Try producing the
following nasal sounds, with and without holding your nose: /˛/ /m/ /n/. Do
they sound different when you are holding your nose? Does this make them
sound like any other English sounds? Which ones?
Comment The nasal sounds will have sounded a bit like the voiced plosives at the same
place of articulation. So /˛/ sounds somewhat like /g/, /m/ like /b/ and /n/ like
/d/. This is because the articulation of nasals and plosives is similar in many
respects.
When producing a nasal sound, the actions in the oral cavity are the same as
for a plosive at the same place of articulation. So, to produce an /n/ sound, the
tongue tip approaches the alveolar ridge, touches it, and then moves away again,
as it does for /d/. The vocal folds vibrate throughout. However, we know that /d/
and /n/ do not sound identical. The reason for this is the position of the velum.
We have already met the velum as a passive articulator, and the place of
articulation for /k g ˛/. However, the velum can also move up and down. When it
is raised, it seals off the nasal cavity so that air cannot escape through the nose, as
shown in part 1 of Figure 4.6. This is known as velic closure. When the velum is
lowered, air can escape through the nose, as shown in part 2 of Figure 4.6. The
effect of a lowered velum when producing a nasal is that the air does not build up
behind the closed articulators. It cannot pass them, but, as the velum is lowered,
the air can and does escape through the nose. As we will see shortly, the position
of the velum is also a crucial factor when describing other sounds.
The crucial difference between a nasal and a plosive is that the velum is
lowered for a nasal, as shown in part 3 of Figure 4.6, and raised for a plosive, yet
Figure 4.5 Manner diagram for an affricate
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
42

they both have a complete blockage to air in the oral cavity. This means that, in
nasal sounds, air can make its way to the nasal cavity, where it vibrates with a
characteristic sound. You may also hear nasals called nasal stops, as the air in
the oral cavity is stopped completely, even though it can escape through the
nose. Thus, manner of articulation is not just about degree of stricture, but also
about whether air ﬂows into the nasal cavity.
Exercise 4.7 We are generally not aware of the movement of our velum. However, it is
possible to make it easier to feel this movement. If you put your tongue on your
alveolar ridge and keep it there and then silently and rapidly switch back and
forth between /d/ and /n/, you may be able to feel your velum moving.
Comment It can be quite difﬁcult to feel the movement of the velum, but keep practising
this exercise, making sure that everything else in the vocal tract, such as the

43

position of the tongue, stays the same. You can then move on to /g/ and /˛/, and
/b/ and /m/, and try the same thing with these pairs.
It is important to learn what each MOA label means in terms of
articulation. It is also important to learn which sounds are produced with
which manner of articulation. This will make life much easier for you as you
learn more phonetics, as later on we will use these labels freely, without further
explanation, and it will be easier for you to follow if you have learnt them
already.

labels: voice, place and manner.

easy reference.
4.6 Larger manner classes
We have now learnt the manner labels for the consonants of SSBE. However,
there are also two larger manner classes into which we can group sounds and
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
44

the labels we have learnt. Obstruent sounds are those sounds that involve
some kind of pressure change and noise in their production. They include
plosives, affricates and fricatives. For these sounds, the velum must be
raised – that is, there must be velic closure – since otherwise pressure cannot
build up because air simply escapes through the nasal cavity. Obstruents can
be voiced or voiceless. We said in Unit 2 that vocal fold vibration is one way that
we can make sound audible. Another way is to create noise within the oral
cavity, and all obstruents contain some such noise, either from the release of
plosives or from the friction present in fricatives and affricates. Because of the
pressure build-up, voiceless sounds will be audible due to the noise created,
whereas voiced obstruents contain both noise due to pressure and audible vocal
fold vibrations.
Sonorant sounds, on the other hand, do not involve changes in pressure
or the production of noise. They can be produced with either a raised or lowered
velum, and are always voiced or they would not be audible (recall that no
noise is produced in the oral cavity, as we saw in the case of approximants). For
nasals, the velum is always lowered. For median and lateral approximants, the
velum can be raised or lowered, and in English this is dependent on the
surrounding sounds, a fact we will revisit in Unit 11. Note that we can also
classify vowels as sonorants.
Exercise 4.9 For each set, decide whether the consonants are obstruents or sonorants.
a)
/t ʒ tʃ/
b)
/r w j l/
c)
/m ˛ n/
Tip It is best to do this by identifying the MOA ﬁrst, and then remembering which
sounds fall into which class.
Comment The sounds in (a) are obstruents, as they are plosives, fricatives and affricates.
Those in (b) are sonorants, as they are median and lateral approximants. Those
in (c) are also sonorants, as they are all nasals.
4.7 The importance of the manner feature
As for the other consonant features we have identiﬁed, MOA allows us to think
about the similarities and differences between sounds. This can be helpful when
comparing different languages or accents, the same language at different stages
of development (a two-year-old, and a four-year-old, for example), or the
speech produced by a person with a speech disorder.
UNIT 4 Consonant manner of articulation
45

Exercise 4.10 a)
Look at the following transcriptions, which are representative of the speech
of a young child. Transcribe the adult target (assuming SSBE) and then
compare the adult and child versions. What do you notice about the child’s
pronunciation?
Word
Child
Adult
ﬁsh
/fVt/
juice
/dVt/
b)
How do you think the child will pronounce ‘shoe’ and ‘Sue’? Is the child’s
pronunciation of these words likely to cause any confusion?
Comment a)
The adult pronunciations are /fVʃ/ and /dʒVs/. In common with many
young children, this child is replacing fricative and affricate sounds with a
plosive at the nearest POA. This is likely to be because less precise control
over the articulators is required for plosives than for these other sounds.
This process is often called stopping, as sounds are replaced with oral
stops.
b)
Stopping can lead to ambiguity when the child speaks, as many
different words might be pronounced in the same way. For example, the
child in the exercise above will probably pronounce both ‘shoe’ and
‘Sue’ as /tV/. Of course context will usually help listeners understand the
child’s meaning, and stopping typically ceases after the age of around
4 years.
In Unit 2 we discovered that the voicing of plurals depends on the voicing of the
ﬁnal sound of a noun. We looked at examples like ‘ram’, where the voiced ﬁnal
sound triggers the plural to be /z/, and other examples like ‘rat’, where the
voiceless ﬁnal sound triggers the plural to be /s/. We also noted that there was an
additional complication for some sounds like /ʃ/, which is the focus of our next
exercise.
Exercise 4.11 Look at the following words. How are they pluralised? Can you see any common
features between these words that might explain why these plurals work
differently to the ones we have already investigated?
watch
brush
bus
fez
wedge
Comment All these words would be pluralised with a vowel and /z/ – that is, /Vz/. You may
have noticed that the sounds at the end of these words are all fricatives and
affricates. However, it is only certain fricatives and affricates that trigger these
particular plurals, namely /s z ʃ ʒ tʃ dʒ/. These sounds have very high-frequency
energy, and are sometimes known as sibilants. In contrast, nouns ending with
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
46

the (non-sibilant) fricatives /f v θ ð/ simply take /s/ or /z/ as a plural, depending
on whether the ﬁnal sound is voiced or voiceless (as in ‘myths’, for example).
4.8 Manners of articulation not found in SSBE
The manners we have dealt with so far are those found in SSBE. And, in fact,
English has a large number of all possible manners represented. There are a few
manners, however, that are not represented in SSBE, but are found in other
languages throughout the world.
4.8.1 Trill
Trills are probably familiar to many people, even though they are not found in
SSBE. One type of trill is the sound people make when they are ‘rolling their
‘r’s’, or when they are imitating a cat purring. This type of trill is found in
languages like Spanish (in the word perro, meaning ‘dog’). For a trill, one
articulator taps rapidly against another. In the case of the trill described above,
the tongue tip makes brief contact three or four times with the alveolar ridge
(see Figure 4.8). This type of trill is symbolised as [r]. This may be a little
confusing, as it looks rather like the symbol /r/ that we have been using for
English. Note, however, that the brackets are different, a point we will return
to in the next unit.
4.8.2 Tap
A tap can be thought of as a very brief plosive. The articulators come together
completely, but only very brieﬂy (as shown in Figure 4.9), so there is not enough
time for pressure to build up, and the characteristic popping noise of a plosive is
not heard. Taps may also be thought of as one cycle of a trill. Taps occur in
Catalan, for example, in words such as cera, meaning ‘wax’, and in Spanish,
where a tap makes a meaning difference in contrast to a trill (in words such as
pero, meaning ‘but’). The symbol for an alveolar tap is [ɾ].

4.8.3 Lateral fricative
Exercise 4.12 Think about, or reread, the descriptions of approximants and lateral approx-
imants above. How do you think a lateral fricative will be different to the
fricatives we have already met?
Comment The fricatives we have discussed so far (such as [s] and [ʃ]) could also be termed
median fricatives, as air ﬂows down the midline. A lateral fricative is one where
the major blockage to air is in the midline of the vocal tract. Air passes around
the sides of the tongue, as for a lateral approximant, but this time the tongue
edges are in narrow, rather than wide, approximation to the sides of the roof of
the mouth. This means that the air becomes turbulent as it escapes, and friction
is heard. The manner diagrams will look the same for median and lateral
fricatives. You may be familiar with the Welsh ‘l’ sounds in place names like
Llangollen. This sound is a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. You can try to
produce one by making a voiceless /l/ and bringing the sides of the tongue into
closer approximation with the roof of the mouth, so that friction occurs. The
symbol for this sound is [ɬ].
4.9 Summary
Here we have seen that manner of articulation relates to how air ﬂows in the
vocal tract. This is related, in part, to the degree of stricture, and, in part, to
whether or not air ﬂows into the nasal cavity. We have also learnt that there are
two large manner classes, called obstruents and sonorants, which relate to
whether or not pressure builds in the vocal tract.
4.10 Looking forward
In the next unit we will see how all the features we have looked at so far can be
incorporated into a single chart, and how we can draw diagrams of the artic-
ulators to show how sounds are produced.

UNIT 5 THE IPA CHART AND MID-SAGITTAL SECTIONS
FOR CONSONANTS
5.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
investigate how consonants are represented on the chart of the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
*
learn how we can draw diagrams that show the articulation of consonants.
5.2 Introduction
In the last few units we have covered a great deal of ground. We now know how
speech is different from writing, understand the main difference between conso-
nants and vowels, appreciate how consonants are produced, and can describe
the three principle features of their articulation: voice, place and manner. These
three features can be combined to give a single label, known as a VPM label, for
each consonant. For example, we can say that /t/ is a voiceless alveolar plosive.
5.3 More consonant sounds
So far, however, we have concentrated on consonants that are present in a fairly
standard version of English. This is because this is the language and variety that
most readers will be familiar with, at least through the media, even if they do not
speak it themselves.
There are, however, a large number of sounds that do not occur in this
variety of English, or indeed in any variety of English, some of which we have
considered brieﬂy in earlier units. The important thing about the VPM features
we have concentrated on so far is that they can also describe consonant sounds
in any language. Therefore, knowledge of these three features will also enable us
to think about and describe sounds in other languages.
Exercise 5.1 Are you aware of any speech sounds other than those we have been describing
for SSBE? You might like to think about:
a)
the variety of English you or your friends speak
b)
the non-SSBE examples in other units
50

c)
other languages that you speak
d)
languages that you have heard spoken around you.
Comment At this point it is impossible to say which sounds you might have identiﬁed.
However, some of the sounds that are often identiﬁed when people are
asked this question are the trills and taps found in Italian and Spanish, and
the ‘guttural’ sounds found in languages like German and Dutch. The
important thing about these sounds, and consonant sounds in any language,
is that they can be described in technical terms using the same VPM features
that we have been working with for English in the last three units.
5.4 The International Phonetic Alphabet
You may have heard of the phonetic alphabet before you started studying
phonetics. It is important, however, not to confuse the NATO phonetic
alphabet with the International Phonetic Alphabet. The NATO alphabet
provides a standard set of words for letter names, such as Alpha, Bravo and
Charlie, for <a>, <b> and <c>, respectively. This alphabet is particularly
useful for talking over the telephone or radio, when speech is distorted
and certain letter names can sound very similar. In this book, we are not
concerned with the NATO alphabet, but rather with the International
Phonetic Alphabet, which, as we have seen, is often abbreviated to its
initials, IPA.
Like the NATO phonetic alphabet, the International Phonetic
Alphabet also provides a type of standardisation, but this time it provides
a standard description of all the sounds that can be found in the world’s
languages. It also provides symbols for these sounds, as we have seen for
SSBE, and some sounds in other languages. The IPA thus provides sym-
bols to represent all the sound possibilities found in the languages of the
world. However, when it does so, it labels them strictly on the basis of
their articulation, and not on their usage in any particular language.
Therefore, it is appropriate to use square, rather than slash, brackets when
referring to symbols from the IPA chart, as we will do throughout this
unit.
The IPA uses the features of voice, place and manner to describe and deﬁne
consonant sounds, and provides a chart for viewing and organising them easily.
The full chart is shown in Appendix 1 (page 281). In this unit we will look at the
top of the full chart, which shows all the consonants produced using air from the
lungs (pulmonic). A version of this part of the chart is shown below, with [p]
and [b] in place for illustration purposes.

Comment Symbols are placed in the chart according to the voice, place and manner of the
sound they represent. The chart is designed as follows:
a)
The place of articulation is shown in the columns, which are ordered
from POAs at the front (bilabial) to the back (glottal) of the vocal
tract.
b)
The manner of articulation is shown in the rows, and is ordered roughly by
degree of stricture in the vocal tract, from greatest to least.
c)
Voicing is shown by the position of a symbol in the individual cell.
Symbols for voiceless sounds are on the left of a cell, and voiced sounds
are to the right. For example, both [p] and [b] are shown in the cell
representing bilabial plosives, but voiceless [p] is on the left, and voiced [b] is
on the right.
Exercise 5.3 From the previous units, you know everything you need to ﬁll in the chart with
the symbols for SSBE consonants. Try this now, remembering the voice, place
and manner label of each, and the layout of the chart.

Are there any sounds that you found difﬁcult to place on the chart, or where you
have given a different answer to the one above?
Comment /w/ may well be a difﬁcult sound to place on the chart. We have described it as
labial-velar, because it has two equally important places of articulation. In effect,
that might mean that it needs to go into the chart twice, which clearly would not
ﬁt with other sounds and could be confusing. If we look at the entire chart,
available in Appendix 1 (page 281), we see that, in fact, /w/ goes in a different
place, along with ‘other symbols’, rather than on the main pulmonic consonant
chart.
You may have wondered what to do with dental, alveolar and postalveolar
sounds, as there is only a single wide column for them, except in the fricative
row. In many languages, there is only one plosive or approximant produced in
this region; therefore, separate symbols are not needed to indicate differences in
meaning that are produced by a dental versus an alveolar versus a postalveolar
sound (although such differences can be transcribed, using additional symbols,
as we will begin to see in Unit 10). Thus, for most MOAs, there is just one wide
column, combining dental, alveolar and postalveolar POAs. The fricatives, by
contrast, do occur in three distinct columns. We know, just from considering
English, that we need symbols for fricatives at all three places to distinguish
meaning. For example, the words ‘thin’, ‘sin’ and ‘shin’ all begin with a
voiceless fricative sound at a different POA within this region.
In addition, you will see that there is not a row for affricates. As you know,
affricates are symbolised by combining the symbols for a plosive and a fricative
UNIT 5 The IPA chart and mid-sagittal sections for consonants
53

at the same place of articulation. This means that we can always work out the
symbol for an affricate, without this manner needing a separate column.
Finally, you may have been confused over the symbol to use for a post-
alveolar approximant. In our earlier units we have used /r/ and [ɹ], so you may
have wondered whether the symbol goes the right way up, as in spelling, or not.
This is always confusing for beginning students of phonetics. When we are
transcribing English using slash brackets, we can use /r/ to refer to the sound at
the start of words like ‘radish’ and ‘ruby’, however that sound is pronounced.
This simply means that it is a meaningful sound in English, and makes a
difference in meaning to other sounds, such as /w/ or /p/. When we are talking
more precisely about how the sound is articulated, however, we need to use
different brackets and different symbols, and these are the ones shown on the
IPA chart. For a postalveolar approximant, then, we would use the symbol [ɹ].
You might remember that we said in the last unit that the ‘right way up’ [r]
symbolises a trill, and this can be seen on the IPA chart at the end of this unit. To
summarise, /r/ is a very general transcription, which does not tell us in great
detail how the sound is articulated. It can be used as a catch-all for [ɹ] and [ʋ],
which actually have quite different articulations. In Unit 9 we will begin to see
how all our symbols in slash brackets can actually be modiﬁed to indicate more
precisely the way in which a sound is articulated.
5.4.1 Further features of the chart
The (pulmonic) consonant chart of the IPA has some additional features that
we have not yet discussed. An empty cell means that no language has been
found in which such a sound exists and makes a meaning difference. This does
not mean to say that one will not be found. The labiodental tap was only added
to the chart in 2005, after various Central African languages were found to make
use of this sound. A shaded cell means that the equivalent sound is considered
impossible to produce.
Figure 5.1 is the part of the IPA chart for pulmonic consonants, with all the
symbols included.
Exercise 5.4 a)
Looking at Figure 5.1, ﬁnd some symbols that look like letters used to write
English, but which are not in fact used to transcribe English. What sounds

5.4.2 Other parts of the IPA chart
You will have noticed that, so far, we have concentrated only on the part of the
chart dealing with pulmonic consonants. This implies that there are other types
of consonants in a different place on the chart. Indeed this is the case, and we
Figure 5.1 The (pulmonic) consonants section of the IPA chart
UNIT 5 The IPA chart and mid-sagittal sections for consonants
55

will visit these sounds in Unit 7. The full chart is given in Appendix 1 (page 281),
and also contains a place for ‘other symbols’, as we saw for /w/, which
accommodates symbols that do not easily ﬁt elsewhere. In addition, there is a
separate section of the chart for vowels, and additional symbols that we will visit
in later units.
5.4.3 Using the IPA chart
Because you understand the principles behind the IPA chart, and have an
understanding of voice, place and manner labels, you should be able to use the
pulmonic consonants chart to ﬁnd any sound and symbol.
In fact, the symbols act as shorthand for a considerable amount of infor-
mation. If we write [q], for example, we know that we are referring to a voiceless
uvular plosive. But even that label provides a good deal of additional informa-
tion. We know that the vocal folds are held wide apart, because this is a voiceless
sound. We know, because the sound is uvular, that the active articulator will be
the back of the tongue. We also know, because the sound is a plosive, that it is an
obstruent, and therefore the velum must be raised so that pressure can build up
during its production. So, in fact, just transcribing [q] gives us a lot of extra
implicit, or hidden, information.
5.5 Mid-sagittal sections
We have learnt that one way to represent sounds is to use a standard symbol
from the IPA chart. There is another way to represent sounds, though, that is
much less abstract. In this method, we can draw diagrams of the articulators
that show how particular sounds are produced. These are known as mid-
sagittal sections, or, more informally, as head diagrams, and show the posi-
tions of the articulators in the production of a particular sound. They are useful
if you need to show someone else how a sound is produced – for example, if you
are working with a client in speech therapy, with a student of English as an
additional language, or with a class learning about phonetics.
In mid-sagittal sections, much of the ‘hidden’ information given by sym-
bols, which we talked about above, is made explicit – that is, the position of the
vocal folds, active articulator and velum are all shown in the diagram.
For many people, drawing mid-sagittal sections is a challenge. This is
especially the case for people who are not used to drawing, or who think they are
not very good at it. However, like most things, a little bit of practice will go a
long way. Try to work through the tutorial below, which is a step-by-step guide
to drawing mid-sagittal sections.
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
56

Mid-sagittal sections show the head in proﬁle, as if a person had had their
head divided down the midline, and turned their head to their right, so that you
are looking at the left side of their face. The facial part of the section will almost
always be the same. Try tracing the proﬁle in Figure 5.2 a few times.
When you feel comfortable with that, try drawing it yourself, ﬁrst of all while
looking at the diagram, and then without looking.
Exercise 5.5 Under what circumstances will this proﬁle change – that is for what sounds will
it be drawn differently?
Comment The proﬁle will change for sounds with a bilabial or labiodental place of
articulation.
Now we need to begin to draw the internal structures of the vocal tract.
Again, some of these will be drawn in the same way for the vast majority of mid-
sagittal sections.
Exercise 5.6 What structures will be drawn the same way for all head diagrams?
Tip Try to identify which parts of the vocal tract do not move in order to form
different sounds.
Comment The structures that do not move are the teeth (upper and lower, apart from a
downward movement of the lower teeth if the lower jaw moves), alveolar ridge,
hard palate and nasal cavity. These are the parts that are drawn next (see
Figure 5.3).
Figure 5.2 Step 1 for drawing mid-sagittal sections
Figure 5.3 Step 2 for drawing mid-sagittal sections
UNIT 5 The IPA chart and mid-sagittal sections for consonants
57

We now come to two parts of the vocal tract that move to form speech
sounds: the tongue and the velum. For now, we will draw the tongue in a resting
position, as for normal breathing, and the velum open, positioned away from
the back wall of the pharynx, allowing the passage of air between the nasal cavity
and the lungs (see Figure 5.4).
Finally, we add an indication of the action of the vocal folds, which is also
known as the state of the glottis. This is represented by a jagged line for voiced
sounds to represent vibration, and a circle for voiceless sounds to represent
open vocal folds. We can also draw a straight line to represent closed vocal folds,
as in [ʔ]. For now, we will draw the larynx open, as for normal breathing. We
can also show vertical movement of the larynx for non-pulmonic sounds, as we
will see in later units. (see Figure 5.5.)
You have now drawn the basic mid-sagittal section. It is worth practising
this basic sketch until you feel comfortable with it and know what all the lines
represent. It might help you to shade in the alveolar ridge, hard palate, velum
and the tongue, until you can easily see which lines demarcate space, and which
demarcate tissue, as in Figure 5.6.
5.5.1 Place and manner of articulation
Obviously, if mid-sagittal sections are to be useful, they need to show more than
simply the resting positions of the articulators. As we have seen, much of the
drawing will remain the same, but articulators need to be drawn differently
Figure 5.4 Step 3 for drawing mid-sagittal sections
Figure 5.5 Step 4 for drawing mid-sagittal sections
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
58

depending on the place and manner of articulation of the sound that is
represented.
Place is shown by altering the position of the active articulator, so that it
approaches or touches (depending on the MOA) the passive articulator (see
Figure 5.7).
Manner is shown, ﬁrstly, by how close the active and passive articulators are
(the degree of stricture). They will touch for a plosive or a nasal, be in narrow
approximation for a fricative, and be in wide approximation for an approxim-
ant, as in Figure 5.8.
For MOA we also need to show how airﬂow is directed in the vocal tract, and
therefore need to show the position of the velum – that is, whether it is lowered
to allow air into the nasal cavity or raised (velic closure), directing the air to the
oral cavity. Laterals can also be shown by an arrow indicating that air ﬂows
around the side of the tongue. Different manners are shown in Figure 5.8.
A question that often arises at this point is which part or phase of an
articulation we are drawing. As we know, speech is a dynamic process, and single
sounds span a period of time over which the articulators move. The rule of thumb
is that we draw the portion of the sound when there is maximum constriction to
airﬂow (such as the hold phase of a plosive). We can add a dynamic aspect to the
process by using dotted lines to show an additional position of the articulators.
For example, Figure 5.9 shows an affricate, and uses a dotted line to show the
position of the tongue after the closure has been released.

UNIT 6 VOWELS
6.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
identify how vowels are similar and different to consonants
*
discover how the articulation of vowels can be described
*
ﬁnd out how vowels can be displayed on a chart
*
explore the cardinal vowels.
6.2 Introduction
So far we have concentrated on the production of consonants and we
have noted that consonants have more constriction to airﬂow than
vowels. In this unit we will see how vowels are produced, how they can be
labelled and described, and we will learn about the cardinal, or reference,
vowels.
We will begin by thinking about the English vowels. Just as in the case of
consonants, we use English as the starting point because English is the common
language for readers of this book. More speciﬁcally, we will start by considering
the vowels of Standard Southern British English. This is the accent most readers
will be familiar with, at least from the broadcast media. We will certainly
mention other accents as we go along, however, and consider them in much
greater detail in Unit 14. We will start by investigating an important division for
our description of vowel sounds.
6.3 A basic distinction for English vowels
Exercise 6.1 Think about the words ‘heed’ and ‘hide’. Isolate the vowel in each word, and
then pronounce the vowel slowly out loud. Think about what your articulators
(tongue, lips, vocal folds, etc.) are doing. You may also like to watch yourself in a
mirror while you do this exercise. Now say the vowels immediately after one
another.
What differences do you note in their production and in the way that they
sound?
63

Comment In the majority of accents of English, the articulators stay (relatively) still during
the vowel in ‘heed’, but move during the vowel in ‘hide’. This movement of the
articulators can also be heard, as the quality of the vowel (the way it sounds)
changes as the articulators move. The ﬁnal part of the vowel in ‘hide’ is rather
like the vowel in ‘heed’, but the initial part of the vowel in ‘hide’ has the jaw
more open, and the tongue lower down in the mouth. In fact, all types of vowels
in English are either like the ‘heed’ type, which are called monophthongs, or
like the ‘hide’ type, which are called diphthongs.
6.4 Monophthongs
First, we will look at monophthongs in more detail. The word ‘monophthong’
comes from Greek, with mono meaning ‘one’, and phthong meaning ‘sound’.
So, a monophthong is a single sound, with the articulators in one position
throughout and therefore no change in the sound quality.
The monophthongs in SSBE are as follows. The example words are taken
from those frequently used when describing differences between accents, and
we will revisit them when we think about accents in more detail later on in the
book.
/i/ in ﬂeece
/ɪ/ in kit
/ɛ/ in dress
/æ/ in trap
/ʌ/ in strut
/ɜ/ in nurse
/ɑ/ in palm
/ɒ/ in lot
/ɔ/ in thought
/ʊ/ in foot
/u/ in goose
/ə/ (the ﬁnal sound) in comma
Exercise 6.2 Look at the words above which illustrate SSBE monophthongs.
Isolate the vowels in them and then say them out loud, looking at the symbol.
Then try to think of other words containing each vowel.
Now pick an example word to help you remember each vowel (for example,
you may ﬁnd it easier to remember that /ɑ/ is the vowel in ‘car’ rather than in
‘palm’).
Comment Once you have picked an appropriate word for each vowel, you will be able to
use these words when you transcribe. For example, if you want to transcribe the
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
64

word ‘heart’, you can isolate the vowel in this word and then match it to your
example word ‘car’ or ‘palm’, or whichever word you have chosen for this
vowel. You then know that in order to transcribe the vowel in this word you
need to use the symbol /ɑ/. You can also add these words to your vowel ﬂash
cards, which you can copy from the back of the book (page 290–3). Do be
careful, however, that the example word you have chosen really does contain the
appropriate vowel. If you are unsure, ask a teacher to check for you.

using your example words from the previous exercise, and your ﬂash cards if
necessary.

Comment tent = /tɛnt/; camp = /kæmp/; ﬂask = /ﬂɑsk/, or /ﬂæsk/ for speakers of many
northern varieties; water bottle= /wɔtə bɒtəl/, or /bɒtl/ if you use a syllabic /l/;
sleeping bag = /slipɪ˛ bæɡ/; canteen = /kæntin/; cooker = /kʊkə/, or /kukə/ for
certain Lancastrian varieties; food = /fud/ in SSBE, or /fʊd/ in some accents;
thermals = /θɜməlz/, or/θɜrməlz/ for rhotic speakers; mug = /mʌɡ/, or /mʊɡ/ for
speakers with northern accents. There are actually even more differences in the
vowels for different accents, which we do not have space to cover here. Please
check with a teacher if you have particular queries about your own
pronunciation.
You now know the symbols for all the monophthongs in SSBE. The next step is
to think about similarities and differences in how these vowels are produced,
and how these distinctions affect their quality – that is, the way they sound.
6.5 Articulatory features of vowels
Exercise 6.4 All the words below start with /b/ and end with /d/, and only differ in terms of
their vowels. Concentrate on the vowel in each case and think about the position
of the articulators (tongue and lips) and the action of the vocal folds, and how
these are similar or different between members of each pair or set.

Tip At ﬁrst, it may help you to exaggerate the vowel sounds in order to feel and hear
any differences more easily.
Comment First of all, you may have noticed that all the vowels are voiced, as they all have
vocal fold vibration, which can be felt in the larynx.
a)
In the ﬁrst set, you may have noticed that there is a difference in the
position of the jaw and the height of the tongue. The major difference
between the vowels for our purpose is the height of the highest part of the
tongue. In ‘bid’, you might feel the sides of your tongue touching your
upper molars, while this is less the case for ‘bed’ and ‘bad’. In ‘bad’, not
only is the tongue lower, but the jaw is also lowered.
b)
In ‘bad’ and ‘barred’, there is a difference in how far forward in the mouth
the highest part of the tongue is. In ‘bad’, the highest part of the tongue is
towards the front, while in ‘barred’ it is towards the back. You may have
also noticed that the vowel in ‘barred’ is longer.
c)
In the third set, the major difference is in the position of the lips. They are
spread for ‘bead’, in a neutral position for ‘bud’ and rounded for ‘booed’
(and there is also a difference in the position of the tongue).
Exercise 6.5 Think back to our previous units, and the voice, place and manner dimensions
that we identiﬁed as important for the description of consonants. Then think
about Exercise 6.4 and try to decide if VPM labels are also appropriate for
describing vowels.
Comment From Exercise 6.4, you will have realised that we need a different set of features
to describe vowels than those we use to describe consonants. Our VPM labels
are not especially useful for vowels. Firstly, this is because all vowels are voiced.
Secondly, in terms of manner, all vowels are rather like approximants, in that
the narrowing in the vocal tract is not enough to cause friction. Thirdly, the
place of articulation for vowels takes place in a rather restricted area of the oral
cavity, roughly between the hard and soft palates. This is why it can be difﬁcult
to feel the differences between some vowels as you produce them. Finally, it is
always some part of the front or back of the tongue (rather than the vocal folds,
or tip or blade of the tongue) that is the active articulator, while the lips may also
make an important contribution.
In fact, the features that you identiﬁed in Exercise 6.4 are the very features
that we use to describe the articulation of vowels. As just explained, the tongue is
always involved in producing vowels. In terms of our classiﬁcation system, we
are interested in the location of the highest part of the tongue. This part may be
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
66

towards the front of the tongue (roughly in line with the hard palate), as for /i/,
the middle of the tongue, as for /ɜ/, or the back of the tongue (roughly in line
with the velum), as for /ɑ/. This is the tongue frontness (or backness, in some
contexts) dimension, and we can describe vowels as being front vowels, back
vowels or central vowels.
We are also interested in the height of that highest part of the tongue. For /i/,
the highest part of the tongue is very high, in that it is very close to the roof of the
mouth. For /ɑ/, not only is the highest part of the tongue further back than for
/i/, it is also lower down in the mouth. For /ɜ/, it is between these two extremes.
We refer to this as the tongue height dimension, and we can refer to vowels as
being high, mid or low (you may also see the terms ‘close’ and ‘open’ used for
high and low, respectively).
Finally, we have the lip-rounding dimension. Lips may be rounded, as for
/u/, spread, as for /i/, or neutral, as for /ɜ/.
Therefore, we can summarise the features of articulation of vowels as shown
in Figure 6.1.
Of course, all of these dimensions are really continua, so vowels can be
produced with tongue height between that of /i/ and /ɜ/, and where the lips are
less spread than for /i/ but more so than for /ɜ/, for example. While the
dimensions we use to describe vowels may suggest that there are discrete
categories of tongue position and lip-rounding, we should try to remember that
actually these are continuous dimensions.
These three features of articulation serve to affect the shape of the vocal tract
while the vowel is produced. This means that the air inside the vocal tract
vibrates at different frequencies, so that different sounds are produced. Just as
blowing into differently shaped bottles will produce different sounds, setting the
vocal tract into different shapes will produce different vowels.
Exercise 6.6 Experiment with producing the vowels described earlier in this section: / i ɑ ɜ u/.
Can you feel the differences in the height and frontness of your tongue and
the position of your lips?

Try to produce intermediate vowels – for example, vowels between /i/ and
/u/, and /u/ and /ɑ/. Move the tongue and lips between the vowels while voicing
continuously, and listen to the vowels you produce.
Comment It can be very difﬁcult to feel the small differences in tongue position that
produce different vowels. Do persevere, however, as practice will help. While
producing intermediate vowels you may hear vowels that sound like other
English vowels, and also some that sound like non-English vowels. Try to
appreciate the continuum of tongue and lip positions that can produce
vowels.
6.6 Graphic representations of vowels
As you will remember from Unit 5, the IPA chart for pulmonic consonants
allows us to organise the consonants of the world according to three deﬁning
features of voice, place and manner. We can also use a chart to summarise
vowels according to frontness, height and lip position.
For example, a table of the English monophthongs might look like
Figure 6.2.
Exercise 6.7 Look at Figure 6.2 and produce each of the vowels.

What do you think the bolding of certain symbols represents?

Comment a)
The bolding represents vowels with rounded lips. You will notice that all
the rounded vowels in English are back vowels. This is not true for all
languages, as we will see, but is the most typical situation across the
languages of the world.
b)
The major problem with a chart laid out like that in Figure 6.2 is that it does
not show ﬁne gradations of tongue and lip position, which is what we need
for vowels. It sticks too closely to the idea of discrete categories of vowels,
such as high, back or rounded, rather than allowing us to show more
continuous differences. So, for example, English /i/ and /ɪ/ do not have
exactly the same tongue height or frontness (try producing these sounds and
feel the difference between them), but in this type of chart there is no way to
show this. Likewise, /u/ and /ɒ/ do not have the same degree of lip-rounding,
but in this type of chart there is only a way to show rounded as opposed to
unrounded vowels. Of course, we could use different degrees of bolding to
represent degrees of rounding, but this would still be rather difﬁcult to see.
6.6.1 The vowel quadrilateral
A solution to these problems is to allow vowels to sit in different positions
within and between cells. This is the approach taken by the vowel quadrilateral,
shown in Figure 6.3, with /i/ marked.
Exercise 6.8 a)
What do you think the horizontal and vertical dimensions might represent?
Tip Compare this to Figure 6.2 (page 68).
b)
Why do you think the leftmost line is sloping rather than straight?

Using what you know already, try to place the vowels /u ɑ/ and /ɜ/ on the
quadrilateral.
i
Figure 6.3 The vowel quadrilateral, with /i/ marked
UNIT 6 Vowels
69

Comment a)
The horizontal dimension is tongue frontness, with the left of the line
being the front of the part of the oral cavity used to produce vowels (the
vowel space), and the right being the back of this space. The vertical
dimension represents height, with the top being a high tongue position and
the bottom a low position. The rounding dimension is not shown especially
well in this type of chart, when only a few vowels are present, so we will
return to this point when we discuss the cardinal vowels later on in this
unit.
b)
The leftmost line is sloping to represent how far it is possible to move the
tongue when it is raised or lowered. A tongue in a high position can move
further forward than one in a lowered position. The middle triangle simply
divides the top line into three, in order to show additional reference points.
c)
If we ﬁll in all the monophthongs, the quadrilateral looks like that shown in
Figure 6.5.
6.6.2 Acoustic classiﬁcation of vowels
We are discussing the vowel quadrilateral in relation to articulation, but it can
also be thought of as an acoustic map of vowel quality. Although this book does
not deal in detail with acoustic phonetics, it is worth saying something about
this here. Each vowel has a number of important resonant frequencies called
formants, which are related to the shape of the vocal tract. The lowest two of
these, called F1 and F2, are especially important for distinguishing the vowels
we hear. Simply put, F1 is related to tongue height, with high vowels having a
lower F1 than low vowels. This seems difﬁcult to remember, but low vowels
have a high F1, and high vowels have a low F1! F2 is related to the frontness of
u

A

the tongue, so back vowels have a lower F2 than front vowels. Lip-rounding also
affects F2, with rounded vowels having a lower F2 than their unrounded
equivalents. In this way, the vowel quadrilateral also relates to an acoustic map
of vowel space.
6.7 The special case of schwa
The vowel /ə/, known as schwa, has a somewhat special place in English. Partly,
this specialness is because it is the most common vowel in English. A related,
and more important, reason for it special status is because it only ever occurs in
unstressed syllables. We will visit stress and syllables in much more detail in
Unit 8. All you need to know for now is that all speakers carry a store of words,
like a dictionary, in their heads. This dictionary is called the mental lexicon and
it contains information about the way a word is pronounced, such as which
vowels and consonants it contains.
In addition, all words have a stressed syllable as part of their dictionary entry
in your mind, and this information is just as important as knowing which
segments a word contains. For example, in ‘quantum’, the ﬁrst syllable, which
contains /kwɒn/, is stressed, as it is louder and longer than the other syllable.
The second syllable is unstressed and contains the vowel /ə/, which can only
occur in unstressed syllables. Schwa can be represented in spelling by a wide
variety of letters. The emboldened letters in each of the following words
represent a schwa: ‘gather’, ‘gammon’, ‘petal’, ‘candle’ (for ‘petal’ and
‘candle’, note that no schwa, or in fact any vowel, will be produced in the second
syllable if /l/ is syllabic). This variety in spelling can make it hard for beginning
transcribers to feel conﬁdent in recognising schwa, especially as there is a

71

tendency to stress every syllable in a word when ‘sounding it out’ for tran-
scription. Therefore, it is important to listen out for schwa, rather than being
guided by a word’s orthography, and to try to say all words in a natural way
when transcribing. As we will see in later units, schwa occurs even more
commonly in running, connected speech than it does in single words in
isolation. In fact, other vowels can even turn into schwa under the right
conditions.
Exercise 6.9 For each of these words, ﬁnd the stressed syllable and then transcribe the entire
word in full, noting the position of any /ə/ vowels (which will only occur in
unstressed syllables). Be aware that not all words will contain schwa, so say each
one aloud and listen carefully.
pattern
aloof
penguin
travel
traveller
cat
Comment Stress can be indicated in transcription by adding the symbol / ˈ / immediately
before the stressed syllable. /ˈpætən/, /əˈluf/, /ˈpɛ˛ɡwɪn/, /ˈtrævəl/ and /ˈtrævələ/
(‘pattern’, ‘travel’ and ‘traveller’ might also be produced with syllabic
consonants). ‘Traveller’ may also be pronounced with two syllables as /ˈtrævlə/,
a point we will return to in Unit 15 when we think about compression.
Note that schwa is never within a stressed syllable. However, an unstressed
syllable does not have to contain schwa. In ‘penguin’, for example, the
unstressed syllable contains /ɪ/.
For words containing only a single syllable, such as ‘cat’, /ˈkæt/, that single
syllable is always stressed when the word is spoken in isolation, and will
therefore never contain schwa. This situation may change for certain words
(like ‘and’, ‘from’ and ‘has’) in connected speech, however, as we will see later
in Unit 15.
6.8 Vowel length
In some books and classes, you may see that certain vowels are transcribed with
a following [ː] symbol to represent length. So, for example you may see /ɑː/
rather than /ɑ/ to represent the vowel in ‘palm’. In this book we will not use
extra marks to represent length in transcription. This is because, in English,
there are no pairs of vowels that differ only in their length. For example, as we
have seen, /i/ and /ɪ/ are rather similar, but do differ in the height and frontness
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
72

of the tongue. Since they are represented by different symbols (/i/ and /ɪ/), it
seems unnecessary to distinguish them further by adding a length mark to the
longer vowel (that is, /iː/). There are good reasons for using either type of
system, and historically both types have been used, but in this book we will
consistently not use length marks. The only time this can really cause us
problems is when we transcribe vowels in unstressed syllables, like that at the
end of ‘happy’. Systems that use length marks will transcribe this vowel as /i/,
but the vowel in ‘sheep’ as /iː/. In this book we will transcribe both vowels as
/i/, while remembering that there is in fact a difference in duration between
the two.
6.9 Vowels and approximants
Towards the start of the unit we said that the production of vowels is rather
like the production of approximant consonants, in that the tongue is not
close enough to other articulators for friction to result. In particular, the
approximants /j/ and /w/ are rather similar to two English vowels; in fact, so
much so that /j/ and /w/ are sometimes referred to as semi-vowels.
Exercise 6.10 a)
Which vowels do you think are similar to /j/ and /w/? Try producing the
approximants and making them rather long, and seeing what vowels result.
Also consider what you know about the tongue and lip position for vowels
and these approximants.
b)
If the articulation of /j/and /w/ is so much like that of vowels, why do you
think we refer to them as consonants?
Comment a)
/i/ is similar to /j/, as the high front vowel is very similar to a palatal
approximant. /w/ is similar to /u/. As you will remember, /w/ is labial-velar
in its place of articulation. The labial element is basically lip-rounding,
which also occurs for /u/, and the velar place of articulation is rather similar
to that of a back vowel such as /u/.
b)
In terms of articulation, then, the vowels and semi-vowels are really rather
similar. However, the semi-vowels actually function as consonants. They
take up positions around the edges of syllables, just like other consonants,
such as /p v g/, rather than in the centre of syllables, like the vowels /ɑ/ or
/æ/, for example. In addition, they are treated like consonants by some
rules of spoken English. So, when we put the word ‘the’ in front of a noun,
its pronunciation changes depending on whether that noun starts with a
consonant or a vowel. When the noun begins with a consonant, the form of
‘the’ is /ðə/, as in ‘the pear’. When the noun starts with a vowel, the form of
‘the’ is /ði/, as in ‘the apple’. We see that the semi-vowels pattern with
consonants, as in ‘the watermelon’, where ‘the’ is pronounced as /ðə/. This
UNIT 6 Vowels
73

can be taken as evidence that the semi-vowels should in fact be treated as
consonants, despite their articulatory similarity to vowels.
6.10 Diphthongs
As we discovered back at the start of the unit, some vowels are produced by
moving the articulators during the vowel, and this leads to a change in the
quality, or sound, during the vowel. Such vowels are called diphthongs. The
word ‘diphthong’ comes from the Greek, with di meaning ‘two’ and phthong
meaning ‘sound’.
Because the articulators move between two positions, and the sound
changes between two qualities, the symbols for diphthongs are made up of two
parts, as illustrated below for the diphthongs in SSBE.
/eɪ/ as in face
/əʊ/ as in goat
/ɛə/ as in square
/ɔɪ/ as in choice
/ɪə/ as in near
/aʊ/ as in mouth
/ʊə/ as in cure (for some speakers, /ɔ/ may be used instead)
/aɪ/ as in price
Exercise 6.11 Looking at the symbols for the diphthongs above, and thinking about the
sounds they represent, can you divide the diphthongs into three logical sets of
sounds?
Comment You may have noticed that the ﬁnal part of the diphthong symbol is only
occupied by three different symbols. We can divide our diphthongs into three
sets accordingly.
Ending in /ɪ/
Ending in /ʊ/
Ending in /ə/
/eɪ/ as in face
/əʊ/ as in goat
/ɪə/ as in near
/aɪ/ as in price
/aʊ/ as is mouth
/ɛə/ as in square
/ɔɪ/ as in choice
/ʊə/ as in cure
6.10.1 Diphthong classiﬁcation
In fact, many phoneticians divide the diphthongs into two types, closing (which
combines two of the sets we identiﬁed above) and centring. Closing diphthongs
are those that end in /ɪ/ or /ʊ/, where the tongue moves from a low to a high (or
close) position in the mouth. Centring diphthongs are those where the tongue
moves from a higher or lower position to a central, schwa-like position.
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
74

The movement within a diphthong can also be shown on the vowel quad-
rilateral, as in Figure 6.6.
Exercise 6.12 For each of the diphthongs, say them slowly and see if you can see, feel and hear
the movement of your tongue, and relate it to the diagrams in Figure 6.6.
Do any of the vowels seem not to be diphthongs in your pronunciation?
Comment There are two major potential differences between your productions and those
represented in Figure 6.6. Firstly, many speakers no longer use the diphthong
/ʊə/ in words like ‘cure’, and use the /ɔ/ vowel instead, as we suggested when we
introduced this vowel above. That is to say, they produce the same vowel in
‘thought’ and ‘cure’. In addition, some of the other diphthongs may be pro-
duced more as monophthongs in particular accents (the process of diphthongs
becoming monophthongs is called monophthongisation). So, my (vaguely
London) production of ‘square’, for example, has very little change in quality
during the vowel. Likewise, for Cockney speakers, the vowel in ‘mouth’ is rather
like the ﬁrst part of the SSBE diphthong, but with very little upward movement
of the tongue or lip-rounding. As well as being regional differences in
pronunciation, the lack of the /ʊə/ vowel and monophthongisation are more
common in younger than older speakers. We will address more of these
differences, and the reasons for them, in Unit 14, which deals with speech sound
variation.
Exercise 6.13 You now know all the symbols you will need for making your ﬁrst full tran-
scriptions of English. You can celebrate your success by making transcriptions
of the following:

Comment At the moment, we are transcribing each word as it would be produced in
isolation, and the answers below reﬂect SSBE. After working through a few
more units, you will see that some words change their pronunciation when they
are in running speech, and that sounds may be added, changed or deleted. For
now, the answers given below are as if each word were produced in isolation,
and therefore given its pronunciation from the mental lexicon, rather than
produced in connected speech. However, if you read the transcriptions back,
you will likely note that they sound quite unnatural. You may, therefore, wish to
revisit these answers once you have read Units 15–17 and learnt about some of
the things that can happen in connected speech.

6.11 The cardinal vowels
While we have completed our survey of SSBE vowels, we also need to consider
another set of vowels called the cardinal vowels. The cardinal vowels were
devised by the English phonetician Daniel Jones in 1917. He proposed them as a
set of reference vowels to which other vowels could be compared. It is very
important to remember that these vowels do not actually occur in any lan-
guages, although languages can, and do, have vowels which are similar to some
of the cardinal vowels.
Jones wanted to mark the limits of the vowel space, whereby sounds
produced in more extreme positions are either physically impossible or are in
fact consonants, since the air is restricted enough for friction to occur. When we
think about the cardinal vowels, therefore, we can start with two reference
points deﬁned by articulation:
[i] = the highest and most front without causing friction
[ɑ] = the lowest and most back that the tongue can go.
These reference points are shown on the quadrilateral in Figure 6.7, alongside
the numbers by which we often refer to them. So [i] is referred to as ‘cardinal 1’,
for example.
The six other cardinal vowels also mark the edges of the vowel space and are
auditorially equidistant from the two vowels we placed on the chart in
Figure 6.7.
Because these vowels mark the limits of the vowel space, they sound more
extreme than those found in the languages of the world. However, they can be
used as reference vowels and compared to vowels in languages. In this way, the
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
76

vowel quadrilateral acts like a map and the cardinal vowels like landmarks. So,
in the same way as we might describe a café in Paris as ‘halfway between Notre
Dame and Sainte-Chapelle’, we might describe a vowel in a language as being
‘in between cardinals 2 and 3’.
6.11.1 Cardinal vowel symbols
Exercise 6.14 Why do you think many of the cardinal symbols are the same as those used for
the English vowels, even though the articulation and sounds of the cardinal
vowels are, by deﬁnition, not the same as English vowels?
Comment When we symbolise the vowels in any language, we (usually) use the cardinal
symbols. In particular, we use the symbol for the cardinal vowel to which a ‘real’
vowel is closest in terms of sound and articulation. English /i/ is most like
cardinal 1; therefore, we use the same symbol for both the English vowel and the
cardinal vowel, even though the English /i/ is less extreme in its articulation,
being less high, less front and with less spread lips. Likewise, the English vowel

77

in ‘bed’ has a quality between that of cardinal vowels 2 and 3, and we choose to
use one of these symbols (/ɛ/) to represent this sound (some transcription
systems choose the symbol for cardinal 2 [e]). This dual use of the symbols for
cardinal vowels and vowels in languages can be confusing. However, try to bear
in mind that we are using the cardinal vowels as reference vowels, and therefore
use their symbols to represent vowels within a language which are similar to
those reference points.
There are some exceptions, however. For example, in this book we use /æ/
for the vowel in ‘trap’, rather than the symbol for the closest cardinal vowel,
which is cardinal 4 [a]. This is purely a matter of history and convention, and in
fact some phoneticians do use /a/ to symbolise the vowel in ‘trap’. So, in general,
when we symbolise the vowels of a language, we use the symbol for the closest
cardinal vowel.
6.11.2 Secondary cardinal vowels
For the cardinal vowels above, notice that the lips are spread for /i/, become
steadily more neutral between cardinals 2 and 5, and then become increasingly
more rounded for cardinals 6 to 8. This situation represents the most common
lip positions, as in most languages, including English (as we have seen above),
front vowels have spread or neutral lip positions, and back vowels are somewhat
rounded. However, it is also possible to have more uncommon tongue and lip
combinations, which occur in fewer languages, such as the front rounded
vowels of French or German, for example. Jones, therefore, also devised the
secondary cardinal vowels. These have the same tongue positions as the
primary cardinal vowels, but opposite lip-rounding. So, the secondary version
of cardinal 1 has closely rounded lips, for example. The secondary cardinal
vowels also have their own numbers and symbols, as shown in Figure 6.9 (they
might also be referred to by the number of their primary equivalent – for
example, [y] can be cardinal 9 or secondary cardinal 1).

When the primary and secondary vowels are shown on the same chart,
they occur in pairs, with the more rounded vowel to the right. You will
remember earlier that we said rounding was rather hard to show in our initial
table-like representation. Rounding is also rather difﬁcult to show in the
vowel quadrilateral, unless vowels appear in pairs. Note, though, that this
layout also relates to the acoustic properties we discussed earlier. As
lip-rounding lowers the second formant (F2), it makes some sense for
rounded vowels to occur to the right of their unrounded equivalents (return to
the discussion in 6.6.2 if you need a reminder about formants and the acoustic
properties of vowels, page 70).
Exercise 6.15 Try to ﬁnd a recording of the cardinal vowels. These are quite easily available on
the internet, and links to some sites are given in the Resources section (see page
280). Alternatively, ask a phonetics teacher to produce them for you.
Try imitating the vowels as best as you can, ﬁrst of all as a sequence, and then
individually.
Comment It can be very difﬁcult to produce the vowels accurately, and it can take a long
time to learn to do so. To do so accurately, you really need to learn the vowels by
getting advice and correction from an experienced phonetician, and to practise
producing and recognising the cardinal vowels.
6.12 Vowels on the IPA chart
A vowel quadrilateral showing all the cardinal vowels plus additional reference
points is shown towards the bottom of the full IPA chart, as you can see in

6.13 Summary
We have now seen that vowels can be described in terms of the height and
location of the highest part of the tongue, and the position of the lips. We have
discussed monophthongs and closing and centring diphthongs, and learnt the
symbols for vowels in SSBE. We have considered the cardinal (or reference)
vowels, and have seen how vowels can be plotted on a chart. We have also given
our ﬁrst complete transcriptions of English words.

UNIT 7 AIRSTREAM MECHANISMS
7.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
recap the importance of air for the production of sounds
*
identify sources of air used to produce sounds across the world’s languages
*
explore how implosives, ejectives and clicks are produced.
7.2 Introduction
In this unit we will be looking at a number of sounds that do not occur in everyday
English speech. They do, however, occur in other languages, and sometimes in
English in ways that do not contribute to the meaning of individual words.
7.3 Pulmonic egressive and ingressive airstreams
To start with, we are going to think about how we usually use the air from the
lungs and what happens when we breathe in while speaking.
Exercise 7.1 Pick a phrase that you know and can easily repeat, such as the ﬁrst line of
‘Twinkle, twinkle, little star’, or ‘the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog’.
Produce the phrase as you normally would, several times in succession, taking
only one breath at the start. Then, try to repeat the same phrase, but this time
breathing in. What do you notice?
a)
Is the phrase still intelligible?
b)
Does it sound the same in both cases?
c)
Is one version more effortful than the other?
Comment a)
Your experiment above will have demonstrated that you can, in fact, talk
while you breathe in, and that the speech you produce while doing so is
largely intelligible.
b)
However, you will also have noticed that speech in the two conditions does
not sound identical – for example, the quality and pitch of the utterance
will sound different.
83

c)
In addition, you probably found the ‘breathing in’ condition to be quite
difﬁcult, and that you could repeat your phrase fewer times before you
needed to return to normal breathing.
Exercise 7.2 Think again about the differences you observed in Exercise 7.1. Why do you
think there are differences between the two conditions?
Comment First of all, the ‘breathing out’ condition is much more practised. We have all
been doing it since we ﬁrst began to speak; therefore, it feels easier and more
efﬁcient. Obviously we can speak while breathing in, but, as the air now passes
in a reverse direction through our vocal tract, the quality of the sound produced
is different. There is, however, no difference in meaning between the words
produced in these two different ways.
Exercise 7.3 a)
Do you think people ever speak while breathing in under normal cir-
cumstances (that is, not when they are doing an exercise such as that in
Exercise 7.1)?
b)
Might speech produced while breathing in be used for particular purposes
or in particular situations?
Comment a)
Speaking while breathing in is certainly much more unusual than speaking
while breathing out. However, there are someoccasions when wemight speak
while breathing in, such as if we are surprised. Imagine the word ‘oh’ spoken
in shock, for example. Speaking on an inward ﬂow of air has also been
associated with Scandinavian languages, where the words for ‘yes’ are often
produced in this way. Even then, however, the inward ﬂow of air will only be
very short, and we will return very quickly to speaking while breathing out.
b)
Because the sound of the speech produced changes considerably when
breathing in, it can be used for vocal disguise, such as by ventriloquists, for
example.
7.4 Describing airstreams
As we have seen in earlier units, airﬂow is crucially important for speech. An
airstream mechanism is how air is set into motion for speech to occur. By far
the most common airstream mechanism in the languages of the world is the
outward ﬂow of air from the lungs. The technical term for this type of airstream
is pulmonic egressive; ‘pulmonic’ refers to the lungs and ‘egressive’ means
that air ﬂows out of the body. This outward ﬂow happens because muscular
activity contracts the ribcage, thereby compressing the lungs and thorax, which
causes the air inside the lungs to be under higher pressure than in the
surrounding air. As always, air ﬂows from an area of higher pressure to an area
of lower pressure.
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
84

The other type of airstream mechanism that we considered above is termed
pulmonic ingressive. The lungs are still responsible for the movement of air,
but this time the air ﬂows into the body. This happens because muscular activity
lifts the ribcage, allowing the lungs to expand, and creating a lower pressure
inside the lungs than in the air outside the body.
As you can see, then, there are two things that we need to name when
describing an airstream mechanism. Firstly, we need to describe the part of the
body that causes the movement of air. This part of the body is called the
initiator, which is the lungs in the two airstreams we have looked at so far. Next,
we need to describe the direction of airﬂow in relation to the body, which can be
inwards (ingressive) or outwards (egressive).
7.5 Non-pulmonic airstreams
It may surprise you to learn that airstreams other than pulmonic airstreams can
be used to produce speech. These can be referred to as non-pulmonic air-
streams. Although they are not used to create meaning in English, they may be
used in other contexts and are used to produce meaningful speech sounds in
other languages. They exist in about 13 per cent of languages and are quite
common in languages in Africa and Asia, although less so in Europe.
Exercise 7.4 The sounds we will look at below are produced using the following airstream
mechanisms. Using just what you know already, what do you think are the
initiators and directions of airﬂow in the following airstream mechanisms?
Glottalic ingressive
Glottalic egressive
Velaric ingressive
Comment Looking at the names for these airstream mechanisms, you will see that two are
ingressive, so air ﬂows into the body, while one is egressive, so air ﬂows out of
the body. Your knowledge of terminology so far will suggest that the ﬁrst two
have the glottis (which you may remember from Unit 3 is the space between the
vocal folds) as an initiator, while the last mechanism has the velum as the
initiator. We will now look at each of the airstream mechanisms in turn, to see
how they work, and the type of sounds they produce.
7.5.1 The glottalic ingressive airstream mechanism and implosives
The glottalic ingressive airstream mechanism produces sounds called implo-
sives. Implosives are not meaningful sounds in English, but can be used to
imitate sounds in the environment, as we will see in Exercise 7.5.
UNIT 7 Airstream mechanisms
85

Exercise 7.5 What noise do you make when you imitate someone drinking out of a bottle
(glug-glug), or the sound a chicken makes (bok-bok)?
Comment These sounds are very hard to describe in writing, and it is possible that different
readers might use a variety of different sounds to imitate drinking and chickens.
Many readers, however, will make velar and bilabial implosives as part of their
imitations of these noises. Implosives have a distinctive ‘gulping’ sound, and
we will describe their production in detail below. It would be worth asking
your teacher to produce them for you, or to listen to some of the recordings
mentioned in the Resources section, so that you know what these sounds are
like.
The diagrams and explanations below describe how an implosive is
produced.
1.
Firstly, a closure is made in the oral tract. In Figure 7.1 we have a bilabial
closure, so the resulting sound will be a bilabial implosive. You also see that
the velum is raised. This is because pressure needs to build in the vocal tract,
and this cannot happen if the velum is open (see Unit 4 on manner of
articulation if you need a reminder about this).
2.
In the next step (Figure 7.2), the vocal folds vibrate while the whole larynx,
including the glottis and vocal folds, which are inside the larynx, moves
downwards, as indicated by the downwards arrow in Figure 7.2. This
downwards movement is achieved by a number of muscles which allow the
larynx to be raised and lowered. The downwards movement of the larynx
increases the space between the bilabial closure and the vocal folds, which,
in turn, reduces the pressure in the oral cavity. Importantly, pulmonic
egressive ﬂow continues throughout the production of the implosive, so
that voicing can occur. This is the case for most implosives, which are
usually voiced.
3.
The oral closure, bilabial in this case, is released. As the air outside the vocal
tract is now at a higher pressure than that inside, it ﬂows into the area of
lower pressure inside the vocal tract, as indicated by the arrow in brackets in
Figure 7.1 The ﬁrst stage of a bilabial implosive
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
86

Figure 7.3. As air from the lungs continues to ﬂow throughout, all voiced
implosives are actually produced using two simultaneous airstreams,
glottalic ingressive and pulmonic egressive.
4.
Finally, the larynx returns to its normal position, and, if no other
sound follows, the vocal folds open for normal breathing (see
Figure 7.4).
Exercise 7.6 Try to produce an implosive. You may wish to imitate your teacher or a
recording, or try to copy the steps above. The trick is to move the larynx down

(       )
Figure 7.3 The third stage of a bilabial implosive
UNIT 7 Airstream mechanisms
87

while there is a closure in the oral cavity (not before or after this closure).
You can practise moving your larynx up and down by pretending to sing high
and low notes, respectively. You can watch yourself in the mirror, and when
you can move your larynx down at will, try to do it with the lips closed while
voicing.
Comment Many people ﬁnd it quite difﬁcult to produce implosives, especially from
anatomical instructions such as those given above. It is worth persevering,
ideally getting help from a teacher.
Exercise 7.7 Which of the diagrams above (Figures 7.1 to 7.4) would look different if we were
showing a voiced alveolar implosive? Draw those diagrams as they would
appear.
Comment The ﬁnal stages of the process will look the same, as the closure has been
released. However, the ﬁrst two stages will look different, as the place of
articulation has changed, as shown in Figures 7.5 and 7.6.
The symbols for implosives look very similar to the symbols for voiced
plosives, but have a rightwards hook at the top. So, a bilabial implosive is [ɓ] and
an alveolar implosive is [ɗ]. These symbols, and all those explored in this unit
can be seen in the consonants (non-pulmonic) section of the main IPA chart, as
Figure 7.5 The ﬁrst stage of an alveolar implosive
Figure 7.6 The second stage of an alveolar implosive
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
88

shown in Figure 7.16 (page 97) and on the main IPA chart in Appendix 1
(page 281).
7.5.2 The glottalic egressive airstream mechanism and ejectives
In 7.5.1, we saw that the glottis can be the initiator of an airstream, as its
movement causes pressure changes in the vocal tract. We saw that, for implo-
sives, the larynx moves down, and, of course, the glottis moves down too, as it is
inside the larynx. This movement leads to pressure differences, which, in turn,
move air and create an airstream ﬂowing into the mouth.
Now we will continue to look at glottalic airstreams, but this time we will
look at sounds produced on a glottalic egressive airstream. Sounds produced
on a glottalic egressive airstream are called ejectives. They exist in about 15 per
cent of the world’s languages and are quite common in North American and
African languages. They are not found linguistically in English, so they never
make a meaning difference. However, they can be found as one way of pro-
ducing voiceless plosives (/p t k/) at the end of a phrase, especially if the speaker
is being particularly forceful.
Exercise 7.8 a)
Try saying the word ‘quick’ loudly and forcefully. Listen carefully to the
ﬁnal /k/.
b)
Now compare the forceful production to that when the word is said quietly
and gently. What do you notice?
Comment (a) and (b) If you succeeded in producing an ejective, then the /k/ at the end of
‘quick’ will have sounded quite different when it is produced loudly and
forcefully. Of course, it is difﬁcult to describe sounds in writing, but it will have
sounded sharper and more explosive. As you did for the implosives, it is worth
listening to some examples from your teacher or the internet (see the Resources
section, page 279). You will then be able to listen out for ejectives in speech you
hear around you, and in your own speech (we will think about where ejectives
can occur in English in Unit 11).
Exercise 7.9 Bearing in mind what you know about the glottalic ingressive airstream, what
do you think might happen to the glottis to initiate a glottalic egressive
airstream?
Comment Above, we saw that the glottis moves down to bring air into the vocal tract. To
move air out of the vocal tract – that is, to produce an egressive airstream – the
glottis moves up, as we shall see shortly.
We now turn our attention to the stages of production for ejectives. We will
illustrate this with the velar ejective, which is the most common ejective in the
languages of the world.
UNIT 7 Airstream mechanisms
89

1.
The ﬁrst stage when an ejective is produced is for two closures to form more
or less simultaneously, in addition to velic closure. One of these closures
must be a glottal closure, whereby the vocal folds become tightly shut. This
closure of the glottis is shown by the straight line in the larynx in Figure 7.7,
just as for a glottal plosive. The other closure is elsewhere in the vocal tract,
such as the velar closure in Figure 7.7. Air is therefore trapped between
these two closures.
2.
The next stage is for the larynx (and the glottis, which is inside the larynx)
to move up, while both closures remain in place. This is shown by the
upward arrow near the larynx in Figure 7.8. As the glottis is closed, it acts
like a piston and pushes up the air trapped between the two closures. The
air cannot escape, so is squashed into a smaller space, and therefore under
higher pressure than before the larynx rose.
3.
Then the closure in the oral tract is released (see Figure 7.9), and the
pressurised air ﬂows quickly out of the vocal tract towards the ambient air,
which is of lower pressure. This quick movement of air gives the ejective its
distinctive sharp sound.
4.
Finally, the larynx lowers, and, if no sound follows, the glottis opens to
return to normal breathing (see Figure 7.10).

SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols

Exercise 7.10 a)
Attempt to replicate the stages above and see if you can produce ejective
sounds. Try to make velar, alveolar and bilabial ejectives.
b)
Do you think it is possible to produce voiced ejectives? Why, or why not?
Try it!
Comment a)
As we suggested above, it is worth practising the ejectives and trying to ﬁnd
a teacher to help you. Some of the clickable IPA charts recommended in the
Resources section (page 279) will allow you to listen to ejectives and try to
imitate them.
b)
Voiced ejectives do not exist in the languages of the world. You can give
them a try and hear that you do not get the distinctive ejective sound if the
vocal folds are vibrating. While most voiceless sounds have an open glottis,
ejectives have a ﬁrmly shut glottis, like [ʔ]. If the glottis is to act as an
efﬁcient piston, it needs to be tightly closed, and if it is tightly closed, it
cannot also be vibrating to produce voice. Conversely, if the glottis is not
tightly closed, it does not move the air very efﬁciently.
Importantly, any voiceless obstruent can be produced as an ejective. So the
languages of the world contain ejective plosives, ejective fricatives and ejective
affricates. There are no new symbols to learn for ejectives, as all ejectives can be
(   )

Figure 7.10 The fourth stage of a velar ejective
UNIT 7 Airstream mechanisms
91

symbolised by adding the symbol [ʼ] to the equivalent pulmonic egressive
symbol. So, the velar ejective plosive from above is symbolised as [kʼ], a bilabial
ejective plosive is [p’] and an alveolar ejective plosive is [t’]. The symbols for
ejectives are shown with the other non-pulmonic sounds on the IPA chart (see
page 281).
7.5.3 The velaric ingressive airstream mechanism and clicks
The ﬁnal airstream mechanism we will consider is the velaric ingressive air-
stream, which is responsible for the production of click sounds. Clicks only
exist in southern and eastern African languages. Click sounds are not part of the
sound inventory of English, but they occur frequently when English speakers try
to imitate sounds in the environment, or to express certain emotions, so will
probably be familiar to all readers.
Exercise 7.11 What sounds would you make to do the following?
Blow a kiss
Tut your disapproval
Imitate the sound of horses’ hooves (at a Nativity play, for example)
Tell a horse to giddy-up (this one may be familiar only to those who have learnt
to ride horses).
Comment All of the sounds above are click sounds and therefore have a number of
similarities in their production. We will consider the production of a voiceless
alveolar click below, and then think about the labels for the other clicks in
Exercise 7.15.
1.
Firstly, two closures form almost at the same time. One of these closures is
always a velar closure, just as for a /k/, and gives its name to the velaric
airstream mechanism. The other closure is further forwards in the vocal
tract, and the closure shown in Figure 7.11 is alveolar. This traps a pocket of
air between the two closures.
Figure 7.11 The ﬁrst stage of an alveolar click
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
92

2.
Next, the tongue moves back and down, but both closures are maintained,
so that no air can enter or leave the pocket. As the cavity has changed shape,
the trapped air is now in a larger space, and therefore under lower pressure,
than before. (See Figure 7.12.)
3.
Now, the front-most closure is released so that the pocket of air is no longer
trapped. As the pressure inside the vocal tract is lower than that outside,
ambient air is sucked into the vocal tract. (See Figure 7.13.)
4.
Finally, the velar closure is released, so that, if no other sounds follow, the
articulators return to their resting positions. (See Figure 7.14.)

(   )
Figure 7.13 The third stage of an alveolar click
UNIT 7 Airstream mechanisms
93

Exercise 7.12 The place of articulation for the ‘tut’ sound is either alveolar, as illustrated in
Figures 7.11 to 7.14, or dental. What do you think are the places of articulation
for the other clicks?
a)
Blowing a kiss
b)
Imitating the sound of horses’ hooves
c)
Telling a horse to giddy-up
Comment a)
Kisses are bilabial clicks. It is important to remember for bilabial clicks that
the tongue is still involved in the articulation. If you make a slow and
deliberate kissing motion, you should feel that you make a velar closure
with the back of your tongue, even though the tip of the tongue is not
involved, as it is for many other clicks. This velar closure is the crucial
feature of clicks, and gives its name to the velaric airstream mechanism, as
we have said above.
b)
The sound used to imitate horses’ hooves is usually a postalveolar click,
with lips spread and then rounded to imitate ‘clip’ and ‘clop’, respectively
(think back to Unit 6, vowels, on to work out why that should make a
difference to the sound produced).
c)
The giddy-up noise is an alveolar lateral click. So, the head diagram would
look very similar to those in Figures 7.11 to 7.14. However, rather than the
tongue tip lowering to produce the click, the sides of the tongue lower, so
that air escapes laterally (see Unit 4 on manner of articulation if you need a
reminder about lateral airﬂow).
The symbols for these clicks are as follows:
[k⊙]
voiceless bilabial click
[k|]
voiceless dental click
[k∥]
voiceless alveolar lateral click
[k!]
voiceless alveolar or postalveolar click.
Exercise 7.13 Why do you think these symbols have two parts? Speciﬁcally, why do you think
the symbols contain a [k]?
Comment The part on the right of the symbol indicates the place of articulation of the
click – bilabial, alveolar, and so on – and these can be seen on the full IPA chart
under ‘Consonants (non-pulmonic)’ (see page 281). The part on the left, [k],
reminds us about the velar closure that all clicks must have, and also tells us
about the voicing and nasality of the click, as we will investigate further below.
Note that some transcription systems do not show the leftmost [k] part of the
symbol for voiceless clicks. We will use the two-part symbol throughout this
SECTION ONE Sounds and symbols
94

book, however, for consistency with the symbols used for voiced and nasal
clicks, which we will turn to now.
7.5.3.1 Click accompaniments
All the clicks described above are voiceless, as the vocal folds are not vibrating,
and oral, as the velum is raised, sealing off the nasal cavity. However, it is also
possible to produce voiced and nasal clicks.
Exercise 7.14 a)
Why can clicks be voiced and nasal when ejectives and implosives are much
more restricted?
b)
How would our diagrams change to show voiced and nasal clicks?
Speciﬁcally, what would the diagram look like for the second stage of a
voiced, nasal, alveolar click?
Comment a)
As the larynx does not have any involvement in initiating a click, the vocal
folds can either vibrate for voiced clicks or remain open for voiceless clicks.
Importantly, voiced clicks make use of two airstream mechanisms simul-
taneously. The velaric airstream mechanism takes care of the click part,
as we have seen above. Voicing, however, occurs when air ﬂows up from
the lungs and through the vibrating glottis, so voiced clicks are actually
produced on two airstreams simultaneously: velaric ingressive and pul-
monic egressive.
As you can see from Figures 7.11 to 7.14, the nasal cavity is also
independent from the actions of the oral cavity during click production,
because all the air is trapped in front of the velum. Therefore, the
velum can be lowered while the click is produced, without affecting
the pressure in the space between the two closures, and a nasal click will
result.
b)
Figure 7.15 shows the second stage of a voiced, nasal, alveolar click.
Figure 7.15 The second stage of a voiced nasal alveolar click
UNIT 7 Airstream mechanisms
95

Exercise 7.15 a)
How might our symbols change to symbolise clicks that are voiced or
nasal?
b)
How would we symbolise:
a voiceless dental click?
a voiced bilabial click?
a voiced nasal postalveolar click?
Tip Remember the role of [k] in the click symbols we have already seen
above.
Comment a)
As you will remember from Exercise 7.13, the initial part of the symbol
indicates voicing and nasality, while also reminding us about velar closure.
This is why a velar symbol (such as [k]) is used, rather than, say, an alveolar
or bilabial symbol. We can, therefore, use other velar symbols to indicate
voiced and nasal clicks.
b)
So, while [k] indicates the click is voiceless and oral, [ɡ] indicates it is
voiced and oral, and [˛] indicates it is voiced and nasal. The rightmost part
of the symbol simply indicates the place of articulation (and the manner for
laterals) of the click, as we noted earlier.
A voiceless dental click
[k|]
A voiced bilabial click
[ɡ⊙]
A voiced nasal postalveolar click
[˛!]
7.5.4 The velaric egressive airstream
In order to fully cover all the logical combinations of initiators and directions,
we should mention the velaric egressive airstream. While it is possible to
produce sounds (sometimes known as reverse clicks) using this airstream, no
such sounds are found in human languages, so we will not discuss these
further here.
7.6 Non-pulmonic consonants on the IPA chart
Figure 7.16 shows the symbols for non-pulmonic consonants, as they appear
on the IPA chart. They can be seen on the full IPA chart in Appendix 1
(page 281).
7.7 Summary
In this unit we have looked at the production of implosives, ejectives and clicks,
which are all produced on non-pulmonic airstreams. We have also learnt the
symbols for these sounds and seen where they can be found on the IPA chart.

*
explore the constituent parts of a syllable
*
learn some of the rules governing sound patterns in English
*
discover the nature of stress.
8.2 Introduction
In this section of the book we start to think about what happens when we put
sounds together to make words. Later we will see that sounds that we think of
as being the same can be produced quite differently if we listen closely
enough.
Firstly, however, in this unit, we will be looking at syllables and stress. We
will try to deﬁne these terms and concepts, and will ﬁnd that people generally
have quite a good idea about these notions, even if they do not know much
about phonetics.
8.3 Syllables
Exercise 8.1 Without looking anything up in a book, or thinking too hard about it, put these
words in order of how many syllables they contain:
indigo
orange
aquamarine
red
Tip Start by counting the syllables in each word.
Comment Most people agree that ‘red’ has one syllable, ‘orange’ has two syllables, ‘indigo’
has three, and ‘aquamarine’ has four. This is likely to be the case for all native
English speakers, including those who have never studied phonetics. Ask your
friends and family, to see if they agree with you.
So, hopefully you agreed with the comment above about how many syllables
each word contains. But how did you complete the exercise?
101

Exercise 8.2 a)
What did you do in order to come up with the correct answer in Exercise
8.1?
b)
Based on your answer to (a), how would you deﬁne a syllable?
Comment (a) and (b) Most people struggle to answer these questions. They might
mention feeling the rhythm of a word, or dividing it into beats, or tapping
their ﬁnger for each syllable. All of these are useful in describing how a
listener can count the syllables in a word, but do not really help us to
describe a syllable to someone or to deﬁne the concept. It is interesting that
people can essentially agree on how many syllables there are in words, even
though they are unable to explain what a syllable is. However, our knowledge
of phonetics can help us to work out what we are really doing when we count
syllables.
Exercise 8.3 a)
Transcribe the words below and then divide them into their component
syllables, thinking about which sounds ‘belong’ to which syllable. You can
show syllable division by adding a full stop character in between syllables
within your transcription.
indigo
orange
aquamarine
red
b)
Can you see a pattern? What does a syllable have to contain, and what is
optional?
Comment a)
Your transcriptions may have looked rather like those shown below, but do
not worry just now if you put the consonants in different syllables; we will
think about that soon.
/rɛd/
/ɒ.rɪndʒ/
/ɪn.dɪ.ɡəʊ/
/æ.kwə.mə.rin/
b)
All the syllables contain a single vowel, but the syllables may or may not
contain consonants on either side of that vowel.
8.3.1 A phonetic deﬁnition of the syllable
We can deﬁne the syllable as a unit containing an obligatory centre part which
is a sonorant (look back at Unit 4 if you need a reminder about obstruents and
sonorants). This centre is usually a vowel (although in some circumstances it
can be another sonorant, as we will see later).
As the vowel-like centre of the syllable is the only obligatory part, there are
syllables made up entirely of vowels which contain no consonants at all, such
as the words ‘eye’ /aɪ/ and ‘are’ /ɑ/ (for non-rhotic speakers). In our words
above, the ﬁrst syllables of ‘orange’ /ɒ/ and ‘aquamarine’ /æ/, both consist
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
102

only of a vowel. This obligatory vowel-like part is called the nucleus. The term
‘nucleus’ comes from biology and physics, where the nucleus is the centre of
the cell or atom, just as the nucleus here is the centre of the syllable. A nucleus
contains one and only one vowel (or other sonorant), and diphthongs count as
a single vowel, as the change in articulator position happens within a syllable.
Therefore, a word containing two vowels also contains two syllables, and vice
versa.
As we can see from Exercise 8.3, however, syllables can also start with a
consonant, like the ﬁnal syllable in ‘indigo’ /ɡəʊ/. Syllables can also end in a
consonant, like the ﬁrst syllable in ‘indigo’ /ɪn/, or have consonants both before
and after the vowel, as in the ﬁnal syllable of ‘aquamarine’ /rin/. The portion of
a syllable that contains consonants before the nucleus in a syllable is called the
onset, and the portion that contains consonants after the nucleus is called the
coda.
Exercise 8.4 Here are some CVC words for you to divide into their constituent parts. What
sound forms the onset, nucleus and coda in each word?
duck
bath
calm
phone
Tip You may wish to transcribe these ﬁrst, so that you are not misled by the
spelling.
Comment In ‘duck’, /d/ is the onset, /ʌ/ is the nucleus, and /k/ is the coda. In ‘bath’, /b/ is
the onset, /ɑ/ is the nucleus, and /θ/ is the coda. In ‘calm’, /k/ is the onset, /ɑ/ is
the nucleus, and /m/ is the coda. In ‘phone’, /f/ is the onset, /əʊ/ is the nucleus,
and /n/ is the coda. These transcriptions assume SSBE, but while the vowel
symbols may differ for other accents, the division into the components of the
syllable will be the same. Note, for now, that consonants are in the onset and
coda, and vowels are in the nucleus. We will look at some more complicated
examples in Exercise 8.6, and will now turn our attention to nuclei that contain
a sonorant other than a vowel.
8.3.2 Syllabic consonants
As we have implied earlier in the book, /n/ and /l/ can form a nucleus instead of
a vowel. When /n/ and /l/ occur in this way, they are known as syllabic
consonants, because they, rather than a vowel, form the nucleus of a syllable.
However, in all cases where a syllabic consonant can occur, an alternative
pronunciation is also possible, where that consonant occurs as a coda and a
schwa occurs as the nucleus. For example, in the word ‘television’ (which we
looked at back in Unit 1), both /tɛlɪvɪʒən/ (where /ə/ is the nucleus of the ﬁnal
syllable, and /n/ is the coda) and /tɛlɪvɪʒn/ (with a syllabic /n/) are heard in SSBE.
UNIT 8 Syllables and stress
103

There is also a special symbol that we can apply in transcription if we want to
note explicitly that a consonant is syllabic. This is a single bar underneath the
consonant in question – for example, /tɛlɪvɪʒnˈ /. However, this symbol is not
strictly necessary for our purposes, as we know /l/ and /n/ will be syllabic if there
is no vowel to form the nucleus of the syllable; therefore, we will not use it
further in this book.
Exercise 8.5 Try to work out if you have a tendency to use syllabic consonants or not.
Produce the following words as naturally as you can, while concen-
trating on the emboldened syllable. For each emboldened syllable, try to
work out if you produce a syllabic consonant or a schwa followed by the
consonant.
television
puddle
middle
heavenly
Comment There is often variation between and within speakers as to whether or not they
use syllabic consonants. Neither version is more correct than the other, but
speakers may vary according to their accent, individual preferences, who they
are talking to, and the situation, all aspects of variation that we will consider in
Unit 14. We will also return brieﬂy to syllabic consonants a bit later, when we
think about elision in Unit 15.
8.3.3 Syllables in English and other languages
English allows many different types of syllable. As we have seen in the examples
above, English has syllables consisting of just a nucleus, syllables with an onset
and a nucleus, syllables with a nucleus and a coda, and syllables with all three
constituents.
English also allows onsets and codas that contain more than one consonant.
For example, the coda of the second syllable of ‘orange’ contains a cluster (or
group) of two consonants, (/ndʒ/), as does the onset of the second syllable of
‘aquamarine’ (/kw/).
Exercise 8.6 Take the following words (which all consist of just one syllable) and divide them
into onset, nucleus and coda. As usual, remember to transcribe them ﬁrst.
phone
street
grand
eve
lamps
Tip You may ﬁnd it easiest to start by ﬁnding the nucleus in each syllable.
Comment ‘Phone’ has one consonant in the onset /f/, a nucleus /əʊ/, and one consonant in
the coda /n/, as we saw above. ‘Street’ has three onset consonants /str/, a nucleus
/i/, and one consonant in the coda /t/. ‘Grand’ has two consonants in the onset
/ɡr/, a nucleus /æ/, and two consonants in the coda /nd/. ‘Eve’ has no onset (also
known as an empty onset), a nucleus /i/, and one consonant in the coda /v/.
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
104

‘Lamps’ has one onset consonant /l/, a nucleus /æ/, and three consonants in the
coda /mps/.
In fact, English can allow up to three consonants in the onset, and four
consonants in the coda of a syllable.
Exercise 8.7 What is the longest syllable you can think of in English?
Tip Make sure you are thinking of a single syllable, and not a long word with
multiple syllables.
Comment The longest syllable will have three consonants in the onset and four in the
coda. A syllable like ‘strengths’ represents the longest syllable in English, if
you pronounce a /k/ in the coda, which many speakers do – that is,
/strɛ˛kθs/.
Other languages allow different sorts of syllables, and we can distinguish
three broad categories of complexity. English is considered to exhibit complex
syllable structure, as it allows more than two consonants in onset and coda
position, but not all languages do so. For example, in languages like Darai
(spoken in Nepal), considered to have moderately complex syllable structure,
the most complex syllable allowed is CCVC (where C is a consonant and V is a
vowel). Other languages are considered to have simple syllable structure. For
example, Hawaiian has only CV syllables, and Igbo (spoken in Nigeria) has
only CV or V syllables. (See www.wals.info if you would like to read more
about this.)
8.3.4 Syllable afﬁliation in English
Exercise 8.8 Earlier we suggested that you might have had difﬁculty working out which
syllable some consonants belong to, and we will explore this difﬁculty
further now.
a)
Think about the /p/ in happy. Do you think it is the coda of the ﬁrst syllable
/hæp.i/, or the onset of the second syllable /hæ.pi/, or can you not tell?
b)
Ask some other people and see what they think.
Comment (a) and (b) This type of exercise is interesting and tends to draw different
responses from people. In terms of theory, researchers also sometimes dis-
agree about the syllable afﬁliation of these intervocalic consonants (conso-
nants in between vowels). Some people think that stress attracts intervocalic
consonants, so that the /p/ in ‘happy’ would belong to the ﬁrst syllable, as it
is stressed (louder and longer than the second syllable). Some people even
think that the /p/ in ‘happy’ belongs to both syllables at the same time (that
is, as the coda of the ﬁrst syllable and the onset of the second) and say it is
ambisyllabic.
UNIT 8 Syllables and stress
105

In this book, we will take a different approach, based on the maximal onset
principle; but to do that we need to know a few things about phonotactics and
distribution, areas that we will now explore.
8.4 Phonotactics and distribution
Phonotactics refers to which sequences of sounds are allowed within a syllable
in any particular language; and distribution refers to which sounds can occur in
which positions within a syllable or word. We have already seen some examples
of these in the book. For example, we have said that only three consonants are
allowed in onsets in English (phonotactics) and that schwa cannot occur in
stressed syllables (distribution).
Exercise 8.9 a)
Look at the following transcriptions. None of them is a real word of
English. However, for this exercise, you should work out which ones
could be words of English. For example, if a new product came on to
the market tomorrow, which of these could be new words for the
name of that product, and which do not seem like words of English at
all?
b)
When you have worked out which ones can not be words of English, try to
work out what is wrong with them.
/dɛm/
/˛ʊdəl/
/splim/
/spﬁd/
/ʒɔdʒ/
/bɑh/
/sɪ˛t/
Comment (a) and (b) /dɛm/ and /splim/ are both perfectly good English words, which just
happen not to exist in the language at the moment.
All the others, however, violate some important rules of English. These are
rules that English speakers store internally in their minds about what is per-
missible in the language, and not conscious rules of what is right and wrong.
/˛ʊdəl/ is problematic because words in English can never begin with /˛/.
Words can end with this sound and it can occur intervocalically (between two
vowels), but it never occurs at the start of a word. The status of /ʒɔdʒ/ is a bit less
clear. In general, English words can not begin with /ʒ/. However, there are a few
exceptions, such as ‘genre’, which have usually been borrowed into the language
from French. It is still unlikely that newly invented words would begin with this
sound, as many speakers would turn the initial /ʒ/ into the affricate /dʒ/. /spﬁd/
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
106

is also problematic as an English word because of its onset consonants. Onsets
like /sp/ are ﬁne in English, as in ‘spin’, and /sp/ can also be followed by /l/ or /r/
in English, as found in ‘splint’ and ‘sprint’. However, /sp/ cannot be followed by
another obstruent, such as /f/, in the onset. /bɑh/ is an impossible English word
because the syllable ends in /h/. Likewise, /sɪ˛t/ is impossible because of its coda.
In English, nasals can be followed by voiceless plosives in the coda, as long as
they agree in place of articulation. Hence, we have words like ‘rank’, ‘ramp’ and
‘rant’, where both coda consonants are velar, bilabial and alveolar, respectively.
It is not possible to mix places of articulation for the nasal and voiceless plosive,
however, so /sɪ˛t/, with a velar nasal and alveolar plosive, is not a possible word
of English.
Exercise 8.10 Try to produce /sɪ˛t/.
Can you produce it? If so, how does it feel? If not, what do you do instead?
Comment Some speakers will be able to produce the non-word /sɪ˛t/, but will ﬁnd it feels
very awkward. Others will ﬁnd it so difﬁcult that they change it to /sɪnt/ or /sɪ˛k/,
to ﬁt the rules of English.
Of course, other languages make different choices about the sounds they allow
to combine, and where sounds can occur within a syllable. We have already seen
that many languages allow fewer consonants to occur in the onset and coda than
English does, and Thai, for example, allows [˛] in the onset position.
8.4.1 The maximal onset principle
We now return to our question about syllable division from Exercise 8.8. Just
how do we decide whether the /p/ in ‘happy’ forms the coda of the ﬁrst syllable
or the onset of the second? Throughout this book, we will use a rule called the
maximal onset principle. This means that if an intervocalic consonant or
consonant cluster can form the onset of a syllable in English, it is assigned to the
onset of the second syllable. To make this kind of decision, we need to use our
knowledge of English phonotactics and distribution. So, in ‘happy’, we know
that /p/ is a perfectly ﬁne onset (because it is the onset to real words like ‘pen’
and pin’). Therefore, in this instance, we say that it is the onset to the second
syllable in ‘happy’. In a word like ‘lengthy’, /˛/ and /θ/ both occur intervo-
calically. Using the maximal onset principle and our knowledge of phonotactics
and distribution, we would say that /θ/ is the onset to the second syllable, but
that /˛/ must be the coda to the ﬁrst syllable, as the cluster /˛θ/ cannot be an
onset in English (by the same reasoning, the syllable division would be /lɛ˛k.θi/
if you pronounce a /k/ in this word).
By comparison, in a word like ‘restore’, both the /s/ and the /t/ belong in the
onset of the second syllable, because /st/ is an acceptable onset in English. So, using
UNIT 8 Syllables and stress
107

this principle, consonants and consonant clusters always go into the onset of a
syllable, unless doing so disobeys the phonotactic or distributional rules of English.
Exercise 8.11 Divide the following words into syllables, paying particular attention to the
intervocalic consonants and the maximal onset principle. Do not forget to
transcribe the words ﬁrst.

Portland
Austin
Branson
Washington
Memphis
Kansas Aspen Detroit

/mɛm.fɪs/, /kæn.zəs/, /æ.spən/, /dɪ.trɔɪt/.
8.5 Stress
Now that we know what constitutes a syllable, we can move on to think about
stress, which is an important property of syllables. We have already thought
about stress when we introduced schwa in Unit 6, but we will now look at the
phenomenon in much more detail.
Exercise 8.12 Think about the following words. Say them out loud and see if one of their
syllables sounds more prominent than the others. Check with friends too, and
see what they think.
cassette
gramophone
record
disc
video
television
Tip It may help to work out how many syllables each word has ﬁrst.
Comment The syllables that you have picked out, which seem to stand out in relation to
the others, are known as the stressed syllables. As we mentioned when we
introduced /ə/ in Unit 6, the stressed syllable can be indicated in transcription by
using a raised straight line before the onset of that syllable; for example, /kəˈsɛt/
/ˈɡræməfəʊn/ /ˈdɪsk/ /ˈvɪdiəʊ/ are probably fairly uncontroversial. ‘television’ may
be stressed on the ﬁrst or third syllable, depending on the speaker. For ‘record’,
it may be harder to decide which is the stressed syllable, as the word’s pronunci-
ation depends on whether it is a noun or a verb. The other items in the group may
have led you to believe that the intended word was a noun (i.e. ‘a record’), in which
case, the stress is on the ﬁrst syllable /ˈrɛkɔd/. If the word is a verb, however (i.e. ‘to
record’), then the stress is on the second syllable /riˈkɔd/. Recall that stress is as
much a part of our mental representation of a word as the vowels and consonants
it contains.
Exercise 8.13 Listen again to the words in Exercise 8.12 and compare the stressed and
unstressed syllables. What are the properties of stressed syllables that make
them stand out and sound more prominent?
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
108

Comment Stressed syllables are different in several ways from unstressed syllables.
Typically, they are both louder and longer, and cannot contain /ə/.
They may also be associated with pitch prominence (as we will see in
Unit 20).
Exercise 8.14 Look at the following two-syllable words. All of these can be stressed on the
ﬁrst or second syllable, depending on whether they are a noun or a verb. Try
pronouncing them ﬁrst with stress on the ﬁrst syllable, and then with stress
on the second, and work out which version is the noun and which is the
verb.
present
refuse
import
invite (this may be rather colloquial as a noun for some speakers)
permit
Tip If you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to produce the two versions, try putting the word after ‘a’
or ‘the’ to make it a noun, and after ‘to’ to make it a verb.
Comment There are lots of pairs like this in English. For the majority of them, including
those above, the pattern is like ‘record’, where the noun is stressed on the ﬁrst
syllable and the verb is stressed on the second syllable. However, the pattern is
changing for some speakers, so that both members of the pair are stressed on the
same syllable. For example, ‘ﬁnance’ is often stressed on the ﬁrst syllable for
both noun and verb.
8.5.1 Finding stressed syllables
Some students of phonetics have quite a lot of difﬁculty hearing stress,
whereas others ﬁnd it rather easy. If you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to pick out stressed
syllables, there are a couple of things you can try. One trick is to cover your
ears and say the word loudly. The stressed syllable should sound much more
prominent than the others. Another trick is to shout the word across the
room. You will automatically lengthen the stressed syllable and make it even
louder than the rest of the word. Alternatively, try producing the word
several times, each time stressing a different syllable, and working out which
one sounds most like the word when it is spoken naturally. Just remember
not to do any of these in an exam situation! To practise, you can take some
words at random and check their stress pattern using a pronunciation
dictionary.
UNIT 8 Syllables and stress
109

8.5.2 Rules for stressed syllables
Stressed syllables are generally louder and longer than other syllables, as we
have seen. Every word has a stress pattern (a speciﬁcation of which syllables
are stressed and which are unstressed) as part of its entry in our mental
lexicon, the part of the brain where the pronunciation of all words is stored.
In English, stress is largely unpredictable and can occur on any syllable of
the word, as we saw in Exercise 8.12. This means that we need to listen really
carefully to every word to work out its stress pattern. This is not the case for
all languages, however, as some have the same stress pattern in all words.
For example, Hungarian always has stress on a word’s ﬁrst syllable, and
Polish words always have stress on the penultimate syllable.
So, English words can have any of their syllables stressed. Stress location
may also be affected by the afﬁxes that we add to words. Some of these
afﬁxes attract stress to themselves. For example, in the word ‘themselves’
that we have just used, the sufﬁx ‘selves’ is stressed. Other afﬁxes attract
stress to the syllable before them. For example, the word ‘athlete’ is stressed
on the ﬁrst syllable, but in ‘athletic’ the stress moves to the second syllable,
directly before the sufﬁx ‘-ic’. Other afﬁxes have no effect on the stress of
the word to which they attach. These include most preﬁxes, which attach at
the start of a word (such as ‘pre-’ and ‘ex-’) and lots of sufﬁxes, too (such as
‘-ing’ and ‘-ed’).
8.5.3 Lexical and rhythmic stress
So far we have only discussed lexical stress, which refers to the stress pattern of
words when they are produced in isolation (the term ‘lexical’ simply refers to
individual words). However, we can also think about the stress pattern of
syllables in sentences, and this is called rhythmic stress. While we will not
explore this issue much further here, what you need to know for now is that
rhythmic stress can sometimes override lexical stress.
Exercise 8.15 a)
Think about the following phrases. Mark two stressed syllables in each
phrase, one in each word.
Chinese takeaway
Waterloo station
b)
Now ﬁnd the lexical stress when the ﬁrst word of each phrase is said in
isolation.
Chinese
Waterloo
c)
Compare the stress in the words in (a) with the stress in the words in
(b). What do you notice?
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
110

Comment a)
Stress likely falls on the ﬁrst syllable of each element: ˈChinese ˈtakeaway
and ˈWaterloo ˈstation.
b)
When we say the initial words in isolation, however, the stress is on the
ﬁnal syllable: Chiˈnese and Waterˈloo.
c)
This phenomenon is known as stress shift, because stress shifts from
the lexical stress position to somewhere else. This happens because
another stressed syllable occurs immediately afterwards – that is, at the
start of ‘takeaway’ and ‘station’. English likes stressed syllables to be
separated by some unstressed syllables, and stress shift is one of the
techniques the language employs to do just that. This may also be
known as the ‘thirteen men’ rule, as this is often the example used to
illustrate the phenomenon (compare the stress pattern on ‘thirteen’ in
isolation and in the phrase).
Just as for lexical stress, it is not entirely possible to predict where
rhythmic stress will occur in a sentence. However, there are a few generalisations
to bear in mind. Firstly, it is more usual for content words (e.g. nouns, adjectives,
verbs) to be stressed than function words – words that make an utterance
grammatical, but do not add to its meaning (e.g. pronouns, conjunctions,
determiners).
Secondly, notwithstanding our illustration of stress shift above, content
words will normally be stressed on their lexically stressed syllable (as stated in
our mental dictionary entry for these words). Finally, any syllable that contains
a schwa cannot be stressed in English. You will still need to listen to sentences
carefully, though, to work out which syllables are stressed. We will return to
think brieﬂy about rhythmic stress and the effect this can have on vowels and
consonants in Unit 15, when we consider weak forms.
8.6 Summary
We have seen in this unit how we can deﬁne syllables and their component
parts (onset, nucleus and coda). We have thought about phonotactics and
distribution, as a way to decide how to divide words into syllables. We have
also seen that all words have a stressed syllable as part of their entry in our
mental lexicons, and that stressed syllables are louder and longer than
unstressed syllables.
8.7 Looking forward
In the next units, we will move on to look at allophonic variation, starting with
variations of voicing. We will discover that such variation is often affected by
stress and syllable position.

UNIT 9 ALLOPHONIC VARIATIONS OF VOICE
9.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
discover that the same phoneme can occur in a number of different forms
*
explore how allophonic variation is conditioned by the environment and
relates to coarticulation
*
investigate why there is a need for two levels of transcription.
9.2 Introduction
So far we have looked at how individual sounds can be described and how we
can transcribe English words. In this unit, we will see that there are a number of
differences between sounds, which speakers of a language hardly ever notice.
These variations are usually related to the surrounding sounds, and it is
crucially important to know about them when studying phonetics.
9.3 Allophonic variation
Exercise 9.1 a)
Make a transcription of the words ‘pin’ and ‘spin’.
b)
Are the two /p/s the same?
Comment a)
Your transcriptions should be /pɪn/ and /spɪn/.
b)
It is very likely that you have commented that the two /p/s are the same, but
your opinion might change once you have completed Exercise 9.2.
Exercise 9.2 Take a single sheet of paper and hold it in front of your mouth. Now say the
word ‘pin’ loudly and watch what happens to your piece of paper around the
time you are producing the /p/. Now, keeping the paper where it is, say the word
‘spin’ loudly and watch the paper again.
Comment You probably found that your piece of paper moved after the /p/ in ‘pin’, but
not after the /p/ in spin, demonstrating that, in fact, the two /p/s are not
identical. This will be easy to observe for speakers of many accents of English,
such as SSBE. However, for some other accents of English, such as some
114

Northern accents, there may have been little difference between the two. In this
case, you might like to ask some friends with different accents to try the same
experiment, to see what happens.
9.4 Aspiration
The effect you observed when the paper moved in ‘pin’ is the result of some-
thing called aspiration. Aspiration is an audible puff of air that occurs after
another sound; it sounds rather like a short /h/. The /p/ in ‘spin’, on the other
hand, is unaspirated. This means that there is no /h/-like friction after the
release of the /p/. We will consider the detailed phonetics of aspiration and
unaspiration shortly.
Aspiration is present in English not only for /p/, but also for the other
voiceless plosives /t/ and / k/. There is a ‘rule’ for when aspiration occurs, which
is related to the position of /p t k/ in the syllable, and the stress of that syllable.
The rule is that aspiration occurs any time a voiceless plosive (i.e. /p t k/) occurs
at the very beginning of a stressed syllable. However, /p t k/ are always
unaspirated when they follow an /s/ in the onset of a stressed syllable – that is,
when they are in an /s/-cluster. Note that these rules are not conscious rules that
speakers deliberately follow, but unconscious rules, stored in their minds, which
they learnt as they acquired English as a child.
Exercise 9.3 Look at the following words and work out from the rules above which voiceless
plosives are aspirated and which are unaspirated when these words are pro-
duced in isolation, and therefore stressed.
tan
king
spend
ski
stand
pen
Comment ‘king’ has an aspirated /k/, ‘pen’ has an aspirated /p/, and ‘tan’ has an aspirated
/t/. ‘stand’, ‘ski’ and ‘spend’ all contain the unaspirated version of those
consonants, as they come after /s/ in a cluster.
9.5 Diacritics
Now that we know there is a difference between the /p/ sounds in words like
‘pin’ and ‘spin’, we need a way to transcribe this difference. For most differ-
ences of this kind, we will add a small symbol to the symbol that we have
already learnt for the sound. These small additional symbols are known as
diacritics, and there is a special section for them on the full IPA chart. We will
use a large number of diacritics in this book, but they are summarised in
Appendix 3 for ease of reference (page 283). Aspiration is transcribed with a
superscript – (that is, a small, raised)‘h’, and unaspiration is transcribed with a
superscript ‘equals’ sign ‘=’. This is a different level of transcription to that
UNIT 9 Allophonic variations of voice
115

which we have concentrated on so far, in that it shows more detail. For
example, it shows aspiration and unaspiration, rather than transcribing all
/p/s as the same. For this new type of transcription, we will need to use a
different type of brackets, for reasons that will be explained more fully below.
So, ‘pin’ is transcribed as [phɪn] and ‘spin’ is transcribed as [sp=ɪn]. You may
remember that we also learnt how to show more detail for /r/ sounds, using [ɹ]
and [ʋ], back in Unit 3.
9.6 Meaning differences
At this point, you may be feeling a bit confused. You have spent a long time (and
several units of this book so far) learning about the sounds in SSBE, and now it
turns out that there are more differences that you were not even aware of.
Actually this is perfectly normal, particularly if English is your ﬁrst language. As
native speakers of a particular language, we learn to ignore small difference
between sounds – for example, the difference between aspirated and unaspi-
rated plosives. The reason is that these small differences never make a difference
in meaning, as we shall see now.
Exercise 9.4 Remember that an aspirated /p/ has an audible puff of air before the following
vowel, which sounds a bit like an /h/. An unaspirated /p/ has no puff of air. Try
to swap these sounds around in words that you produce. For example, say ‘spin’
with an aspirated /p/, and ‘pin’ with an unaspirated /p/. This can be done quite
easily with a bit of practice, or you could ask your teacher to say it for you, or to
demonstrate it on a computer by splicing sounds together.
What do you notice about the meaning of the word? Does ‘spin’ still mean
‘spin’ even with an aspirated /p/? And what about ‘pin’? Does its meaning
change when the /p/is unaspirated?
Comment You should have found that, although the words might sound a bit odd, there is
no meaning difference between ‘spin’ or ‘pin’ when they are produced with an
aspirated /p/ or an unaspirated /p/. We will carry this idea further by thinking
about phonemes and allophones.
9.7 Phonemes, allophones and minimal pairs
Phonemes are the smallest units that can make a meaning difference in a
language, but they occur in slightly different forms depending on their envi-
ronment (the other sounds around them, and factors such as stress and their
position in the syllable). We can tell if two sounds are variants of the same
phoneme by replacing one for another in a word and seeing if they make a
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
116

meaning difference. If they do not, then we know they are different versions of
the same phoneme. These different versions are called allophones. The aspi-
rated and unaspirated sounds we have looked at in ‘pin’ and ‘spin’ are both
allophones of the phoneme /p/, but we could easily have used different examples
for the allophones of phonemes /t/ and /k/. In fact, every time we speak, we are
actually producing allophones. The native listener simply categorises these
according to which phoneme they belong to, and is very unlikely to even notice
that different allophones of a single phoneme exist. This seems quite a sur-
prising idea for many students, but hopefully it will become clearer and less odd
as we work through the next few units.
In terms of transcription, then, we can transcribe the same speech at
different levels of detail (and we will return to this idea in Unit 13). At one
level, we can give a broad transcription, by including only enough detail to
show which phonemes are present, and encase our transcription in slash
brackets / /. We can also make more detailed transcriptions, known as
narrow transcriptions, which we enclose in square brackets [ ]. One type of
narrow transcription, for example, shows which allophones of phonemes are
present, and would indicate, therefore, whether plosives are aspirated or
unaspirated. This type of transcription is known as allophonic transcrip-
tion. So, a broad transcription of ‘spin’ is /spɪn/, and an allophonic tran-
scription is [sp=ɪn]. Both transcriptions represent the same speech, but at
different levels of detail.
Swapping one sound for another to look for meaning differences is a really
useful tool and is referred to as a minimal pairs test. Minimal pairs are pairs of
words that only differ by one sound and mean different things. So, ‘pin’ and
‘tin’ are a minimal pair, as are ‘spin’ and ‘skin’. If a minimal pair can be found,
it demonstrates that the two different sounds ([ph] and [th], or [p=] and [k=]) are
variants of different phonemes, because they make a meaning difference.
As we have already seen, there is no meaning difference when we swap
allophones of the same phoneme, like aspirated and unaspirated /p/, even if the
resulting words sound a bit odd. Thus, it is impossible to ﬁnd a minimal pair
involving aspirated and unaspirated /p/, because they are allophones of the
same phoneme and never make a meaning difference in English.
Exercise 9.5 What phonemes are illustrated by the following English minimal pairs? For
example, ‘pin’ and ‘tin’ illustrate phonemes /p/ and /t/.
a)
ban and man
b)
cat and rat
c)
tin and tan
d)
ram and ran
e)
belated and berated
UNIT 9 Allophonic variations of voice
117

Comment a)
/b/ and /m/
b)
/k/ and /r/
c)
/ɪ/ and /æ/
d)
/m/ and/n/
e)
/l/ and /r/
These pairs show that the two sounds which distinguish words in a minimal
pair can differ by one feature (such as manner in (a)), or many (such as voice,
place and manner in (b)). The test works for vowels (see (c)) as well as
consonants, in onsets (a), (b), (e) and codas (d), and in multisyllabic words (e).
As long as only one sound is changed, and that sound is in the same position in
each word, then the words form a minimal pair.
We can also ﬁnd minimal sets, such as ‘ran’, ‘ram’ and ‘rang’, which
illustrate three (or more) separate phonemes, /m n ˛/ in this case.
Exercise 9.6 Find minimal pairs to illustrate that the following pairs of sounds belong to
separate phonemes in English. For example, for [t]–[d], you could say ‘tangle’
and ‘dangle’.
[p]–[b]
[s]–[z]
[θ]–[ð]
[z]–[ʒ]
[ɡ]–[ʒ]
[˛]–[h]
Comment You probably found this task harder as the list progressed. That is because there
are more minimal pairs in the language for the pairs of sounds at the start of the
list than those at the end. So, while the ﬁrst two pairs are pretty easy, things get
harder as you go along. For [θ]–[ð] you might have said ‘thigh’ and ‘thy’, for
[z]–[ʒ], ‘baize’ and ‘beige’, and for [ɡ]–[ʒ] ‘mega’ and ‘measure’, which is
possibly the only minimal pair for these two sounds. You can see lists of
minimal pairs at http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/wordscape/wordlist/. Importantly,
you will not have been able to ﬁnd any minimal pairs for /˛/ and /h/, a point that
we will explore further now.
Exercise 9.7 There are no minimal pairs in the English language for [˛] and [h].
a)
Can you think why not?
Tip Remember what we learnt about the distribution of these sounds in Unit 8.
b)
Do you think this means [˛] and [h] are allophones of the same phoneme?
Comment There are no minimal pairs for these sounds because they never occur in the
same environment. This is a situation known as complementary
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
118

distribution. In this example, [˛] only occurs in codas and [h] only occurs in
onsets. When two sounds are in complementary distribution, we often use this
as evidence that they are allophones of the same phoneme, because it means
that a minimal pair cannot be found (remember that minimal pairs differ by
one sound in the same position in the word). Using our earlier example of
aspiration, notice that aspirated and unaspirated sounds occur in different
environments (in stressed simple onsets and stressed /s/-clusters, respec-
tively). For [˛] and [h], however, most native speakers intuitively think they
are allophones of separate phonemes, even though they are in complemen-
tary distribution and can never make a meaning difference between English
words.
Exercise 9.8 Why do you think most speakers think of [˛] and [h] as different phonemes,
rather than as allophones of the same phoneme?
Tip Think about the VPM labels for each one.
Comment The reason that these sounds are classed as separate phonemes, even though they
are in complementary distribution, is that they are not phonetically similar. If we
think about aspirated and unaspirated /p/, they are not only in complementary
distribution, but are also phonetically similar, sharing the same voice, place and
manner of articulation. So, to be classed as allophones of the same phoneme,
sounds must be in complementary distribution and be phonetically similar.
Exercise 9.9 Imagine that a new language is discovered. This language might be on a newly
explored island in the middle of the ocean or on a planet outside our solar
system (in which case, it would likely be very different phonetically to most
human languages, but we can imagine that the principles discussed in this unit
still hold).
How will you work out which sounds are separate phonemes in this new
language and which are allophones of the same phoneme? Think about practical
considerations, such as the task you will ask your participants to perform, any
equipment you might need and any analysis you will carry out.
Comment The crucial test will be to ﬁnd minimal pairs in the language. In order to elicit
words to analyse for minimal pairs, you might ask informants to name concrete
objects (those that can be seen in the surroundings), as these are easier to
consistently identify than abstract concepts, like ‘truth’ and ‘justice’. Producing
words individually has the advantage of breaking up the speech stream some-
what, so that you can tell where word boundaries are, and what each word refers
to. You may also wish to record your participants, so you can listen several times
to their speech, and possibly analyse it acoustically.
Exercise 9.10 Imagine that, after eliciting some speech from your informants, you get the
following results.
UNIT 9 Allophonic variations of voice
119

[phan] means ‘belligerent’
[p=an] means ‘birthmark’
[ban] means ‘to bloom’
The informants clearly use [ph] [p=] and [b], but are they used in the same way
as in English?
Comment [ph] and [p=] make a meaning difference in the language, so must be classed as
allophones of different phonemes. We know this because there is a minimal pair
involving these sounds in our data set. This is a good example of how different
languages can use the same sounds in different ways. English also uses the
allophones [ph] and [p=] as part of its sound system, but they are allophones of the
same phoneme /p/. The language illustrated above is, in fact, Thai, where [ph] and
[p=] are allophones of separate phonemes, both of which contrast (make a
meaning difference) with [b]. This is the most typical example of this contrast in
Thai, which you will ﬁnd in many textbooks, but the same situation also exists at
the alveolar POA, with a three-way contrast between [th] [t=] and [d].
The details of the articulation and auditory effect of different allophones are
a matter of phonetics. However, once we start to think about how sounds
function in a language we are in the realm of phonology. In this book, we will
concentrate on the phonetic aspects of different allophones and where they
occur in English. While this will involve some aspects of phonology, we will
leave detailed description of phonological theory to other textbooks, some of
which are suggested in the Resources section (page 278).
9.8 Allophones of voicing
The remainder of this unit will be devoted to thinking about some of the
allophones of English. We will concentrate on the articulatory aspects of these
allophones, and the environment in which they typically occur in Standard
Southern British English.
The allophones we will investigate in this unit all have something to do with
voicing. As we will see, the voice label we have learnt for the phoneme may be
modiﬁed somewhat, depending on the environment, when we examine the
sound in more detail.
9.8.1 Recap of facts about voicing
Exercise 9.11 Fill in the gaps in the following paragraph for a reminder of the essential facts
about voicing.
Whether a sound is classiﬁed as voiced or voiceless depends on the action of
the _____ _____, situated in the larynx. For voiced sounds, the vocal folds are
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
120

_____ and are positioned close together so that they _____ in the airstream
from the _____. For voiceless sounds, the vocal folds are usually _____ and held
far apart, so that they do not vibrate. All vowels are _____, but _____ may be
described as either voiced or voiceless.
Comment Whether a sound is classiﬁed as voiced or voiceless depends on the action of the
vocal folds, situated in the larynx. For voiced sounds, the vocal folds are
adducted and are positioned close together so that they vibrate in the airstream
from the lungs. For voiceless sounds, the vocal folds are usually abducted and
held far apart, so that they do not vibrate. All vowels are voiced, but consonants
may be described as either voiced or voiceless.
So, in earlier units, we learnt that sounds can be categorised as either voiced
or voiceless. What we will see now, however, is that the situation is rather more
complicated. In particular, the label that we learnt for certain sounds may differ
or be modiﬁed due to the environment in which those sounds occur.
9.8.2 Obstruent devoicing
In some environments, sounds that we have classiﬁed as voiced can in fact be
produced without vocal fold vibration for some or all of their duration. We refer
to this process as devoicing. One class of sounds whose voicing can be affected
by the environment in this way is obstruents (see Unit 4.6 if you need a
reminder of this term). In transcription, a small circle directly above or below a
symbol indicates that a sound is devoiced. In this book, we will mainly use the
diacritic above the symbol, for ease of reading.
Exercise 9.12 Look at the following sets of data, which are allophonic transcriptions. In these
sets, we assume each word is spoken in isolation and thus surrounded by
silence.
What is the rule for obstruent devoicing demonstrated in each set?
Set 1
Set 2
[˚ɡəʊld̊]
[wɛ̊bsaɪt]
[sɪlvə]
[̊bæ˚gpaɪp]
[̊bɹɒnz̊]
[hɒtd̊ɒ˚ɡ]
Tip Firstly, ﬁnd all the obstruents you have previously classiﬁed as voiced, and
divide them into two sets, depending on whether or not they have been tran-
scribed with the diacritic indicating devoicing.
Comment In set 1, the devoiced obstruents are at the beginning and end of words; hence
the /v/ in ‘silver’ is not devoiced. In set 2, there are again some devoiced
obstruents at the start and ends of words, but others appear next to voiceless
UNIT 9 Allophonic variations of voice
121

obstruents. So, in set 2, obstruents are devoiced preceding or following silence
or voiceless consonants. It is important to remember here that the words in set 1
are transcribed as if they were in isolation. If these words were pronounced in a
phrase or sentence, things would be a bit different. For example, in the phrase,
‘gold and silver and bronze’, only the /g/ and /z/ would be devoiced, as they are
next to silence. The /d/ and/b/ would no longer be next to silence, as we do not
leave silent gaps between our words when we talk.
Exercise 9.13 Why do you think sounds classiﬁed as voiced might get devoiced next to silence
and voiceless sounds? Why are they not devoiced next to voiced sounds?
Comment Many of the allophones that we will investigate come about due to the inﬂuence
of surrounding sounds. We tend to think of sounds as individual discrete units,
but, of course, they run together with sounds next to them, and because these
sounds are produced with the same articulators, the sounds affect each other’s
production. Back in Unit 1, we said that speech is really like a movie, but that we
can think of it as a number of still snapshots. Each of our snapshots, however,
will be inﬂuenced by what happens before or after in the movie.
After silence or a voiceless sound, it can take some time for the vocal folds to
start vibrating, so a sound we think of as voiced may not have vocal fold vibration
the whole way through. Likewise, before a voiceless sound or silence, the vocal
folds prepare to stop vibrating, and may stop early, while the rest of the articu-
lators are still in position for the voiced sound. This process is called coarticu-
lation, in which the articulations for successive sounds overlap, and therefore
sounds change to accommodate features of the sounds that are around them.
We can draw a diagram to illustrate where vocal fold vibration takes place
within a word. As you can see in Figure 9.1, a ‘slot’ is assigned to each segment, so
the vertical lines indicate notional beginnings and ends of segments. The hori-
zontal line represents the action of the vocal folds across the utterance. Vibrating
vocal folds are indicated by the wiggly line, and lack of vibration by a straight line.
What we see here is that the vocal fold vibration does not begin immediately
when the other articulators are in position for /ɡ/. In addition, the vibrations of
the vocal folds stop before the other articulators have moved out of position for /d/.
This type of diagram is called a parametric diagram, as it shows parameters
such as vocal fold vibration, and can also be used to show the changing position
of the velum across the course of an utterance, which we will do in Unit 11.

9.8.3 Direction of coarticulation
In the example in Figure 9.1, we see that sounds can be inﬂuenced by what
comes before or after them. So, the /ɡ/ in ‘gold’, when the word is produced in
isolation, is devoiced because of the silence that comes before it. The /d/ of
‘gold’, when the word is in isolation, is devoiced because of the silence that
comes after it. These two directions of inﬂuence have different names. If a sound
is affected by what comes before, this is called perseverative (or progressive)
coarticulation. If a sound is affected by what comes after it, this is called
anticipatory (or regressive) coarticulation. You will see that these terms can
also be used to describe the direction of assimilation in Unit 17.
9.8.4 Approximant devoicing
Obstruents are not the only sounds that are devoiced in English. Approximants
are also devoiced, but in different environments to obstruents.
Exercise 9.14 See if you can spot when approximants are devoiced by looking at the following
allophonic transcriptions.
[tɹ̊i]
[lif]
[ˈﬂaʊə]
[pl̊ɑnt]
[ˈkl̊əʊvə]
[ɡ̊ɹɑs]
[wid̊]
[ˈpɹ̊ɪvət]
[ˈkʌntɹi]
Tip Divide the list into two, separating those words with and without approximant
devoicing.
Comment Approximants are devoiced when they occur in a cluster after a voiceless plosive in
the onset of a stressed syllable. Thus there is a devoiced /r/ in ‘tree’ and ‘privet’,
and a devoiced /l/ in ‘plant’ and ‘clover’. The /l/ in ﬂower is not devoiced because it
follows a fricative. The /r/ in grass is not devoiced because it follows a voiced
plosive (even though this plosive is itself devoiced, the fact that the phoneme is
classiﬁed as voiced means it does not trigger devoicing in the /r/). The /w/ in ‘weed’
is not devoiced because it does not follow a voiceless plosive in a cluster. Finally, the
/r/ in ‘country’ is not devoiced because /tr/ is not the onset of a stressed syllable.
Again, coarticulation explains why there are different allophones of
approximants. After voiceless plosives, the voicelessness carries over into the
next sound, as can be seen in Figure 9.2; so a voiceless version of an

123

approximant is heard, even though approximants are voiced in most other
environments. Figure 9.2 shows how devoicing affects the /r/ in the word
‘preen’.
9.8.5 Aspiration and unaspiration
We have already seen earlier in the unit that some sounds are aspirated and
some are unaspirated. Now we will recap these phenomena. For Exercise 9.15,
you need to remember that the symbol for aspiration is [h], while that for
unaspiration is [=].
Exercise 9.15 Look at the following words. Try to work out in which environments sounds are
aspirated and in which they are unaspirated. We have covered most of this
brieﬂy already, but the rule is slightly more complicated than that explained
above.
[kəmˈpʰæʃən]
[pəˈtʰeɪtəʊ]
[əˈst=ɒnɪʃ]
[spɛkjuˈleɪʃən]
[ˈstɹɒ˛gɪst]
[ˈsk=ul]
[ˈskɹudʒ]
Tip Are there some sounds that are not marked with either diacritic?
Comment First of all, you should notice that aspiration and unaspiration only apply to
the voiceless plosives /p t k/. This is true for English, but is not the case in all
languages, as fricatives and affricates can be aspirated too. Secondly, you will
have seen that stress and syllable position are crucial, as the aspirated and
unaspirated allophones only occur in stressed onsets, as we have already
said. You will also have seen that aspirated consonants occur when they are
alone in the onset of a stressed syllable, while the same sounds are unaspi-
rated in /s/ clusters. If an approximant follows in an /s/ cluster, such as in
‘strongest’, neither diacritic is used. Finally, you will note that when /p t k/
are in the onset of an unstressed syllable, neither diacritic is used. Thus, we
can think of there being three levels of aspiration in English (aspirated,
unaspirated, and a third level, called weak aspiration, which we will revisit
below).
9.8.5.1 The phonetics of aspiration
Exercise 9.16 Look at Figure 9.3, which shows the vocal fold activity in the word ‘Pam’. What
do you notice about the vocal fold activity in the vowel?
Comment The vocal folds do not vibrate all the way through the vowel, even though we
think of vowels as ‘voiced’ sounds. Rather than starting as soon as the articu-
lators have released the bilabial closure, there is a delay in vocal fold vibration,
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
124

meaning that part of the vowel is voiceless. The time between the release of the
plosive and the start of the vibration of the vocal folds is called voice onset time
(VOT), which is measured in milliseconds. A delay in voicing is referred to as a
positive voice onset time. We hear the delay in voicing as [h]-like friction,
because air is still ﬂowing through the vocal tract, even though there is no
voicing; we call this friction aspiration.
It can be quite confusing to realise that the variation in voicing is actually
associated with the following vowel, even though we talk about the consonant
being aspirated and apply the diacritic to the consonant in transcription. This
situation is really due to tradition, and is a consequence of us thinking about
speech as a string of individual sounds, rather than as a more continuous
stream. While we will follow the convention of talking about aspiration in
relation to consonants, it is worth remembering that, phonetically, the effects of
aspiration are present in the following vowel, as we can see in the parametric
diagram (for example, Figure 9.3).
Exercise 9.17 If you compare the diagrams for aspiration in Figure 9.3 and devoicing of an
approximant in Figure 9.2, you will note that they look very similar, in that both
have a delay to the start of voicing. Why do you think we use different terms,
and different diacritics, for these two phenomena?
Comment While the action of the vocal folds is delayed in both, the action and position
of the other articulators (i.e. those above the larynx) is different. So, for a
devoiced approximant, the articulators are in position for that approximant
and a voiceless version can be heard. For example, for a devoiced /l/, the tongue
is in the position for [l], but the vocal folds do not vibrate throughout. For
aspirated plosives, in comparison, the following sound is a vowel, so the
articulators are in position for that vowel during the voiceless period after the
release of the plosive. Voiceless vowels sound like [h]. (You can test this yourself
by whispering a few vowels and listening to them.) So, although the action of the
vocal folds is similar in each case, the positions of the articulators above the
larynx are different, as is the auditory effect. For this reason, we use two
different descriptive terms (aspiration and devoicing) and two different
diacritics.

125

9.8.5.2 Phonetics of unaspiration
For the unaspirated /p/ in Figure 9.4, you will notice that vocal fold vibration
begins immediately at the onset of the vowel, as soon as the bilabial closure for
/p/ is released. There is no interval between the release of the plosive and the
start of voicing, and we say there is zero VOT. Therefore, there is no interval
where we can hear voiceless friction.
9.8.5.3 Phonetics of weak aspiration
As we noted above, however, we can also distinguish a third level of aspiration
in English.
As you can see from the voicing diagram for ‘teepee’ (Figure 9.5), there is
some delay in voicing for the vowel after the /p/, but that /p/ is not transcribed as
aspirated. Again, this is largely a matter of convention. Voiceless plosives in
unstressed onsets are followed by a shorter voice onset time than those in
stressed onsets. While there is in fact a continuum of VOTs, we tend to divide
this into three distinct categories for allophonic transcription, and only tran-
scribe the plosives in stressed syllables as aspirated. So, in SSBE, we refer to three
levels of aspiration for voiceless plosives: aspirated, unaspirated and weakly
aspirated, as for /p/ in the example of ‘teepee’ in Figure 9.5. These weakly
aspirated plosives occur as singleton onsets in unstressed syllables, and weak
aspiration is not symbolised with any additional diacritic. Weak aspiration is
also frequently not shown in parametric diagrams, and we will not show it in the
remainder of the diagrams in this book.

9.8.6 Voicing of /h/
A ﬁnal allophonic variation concerning voicing relates to sounds that are voice-
less in most environments, but occur as voiced variants in certain situations. This
is actually rather rare in English, and primarily affects /h/.
Exercise 9.18 a)
Try producing the following words and listening to the /h/ sound. Do you
hear any voicing for the /h/ in any of these words? In particular, compare
the words on the left with those on the right,
hind
behind
head
ahead
b)
Why do you think voicing of /h/ occurs where it does?
Comment a)
/h/ can be voiced when it occurs between two vowels, in words like ‘behind’
and ‘ahead’.
b)
Here the voicing spreads from the surrounding vowels, which is another
instance of coarticulation.
The symbol for a voiced glottal fricative is [ɦ], as can be seen on the IPA
chart, and this symbol can be used to represent a voiced /h/ in an allophonic
transcription. If you listen closely to the sound of the [ɦ], you might hear that it
sounds breathy, with lots of air escaping each time the vocal folds part, rather
than the smoother, less breathy voicing we hear for other ‘voiced’ sounds.
Exercise 9.19 Why do you think [ɦ] has a breathy quality?
Tip Think about its place of articulation.
Comment [ɦ] is breathy because not only do the vocal folds have to vibrate to produce
voicing, they must also be in the correct position to produce friction, as the place
of articulation is glottal.
Figure 9.6 illustrates the action of the vocal folds for /h/ in ‘head’ and ‘ahead’.
9.9 Allophones and phonemes again
Finally, you may have wondered why we learnt labels and symbols for English
sounds in the early units of the book, which have now changed. For example,
why did we learn that /z/ is voiced, when in fact it can be devoiced, as we have
seen here? The labels and symbols that we have learnt already only reﬂect quite
general characteristics of the sounds in question. So, /z/ is frequently voiced,
frequently alveolar, and frequently fricative. If it has all three of these charac-
teristics, then it is represented as [z] in a narrow transcription. Under some
circumstances, aspects of its articulation can change. The labels and symbols in
the early units allowed us to think about sounds in general terms, but now we
UNIT 9 Allophonic variations of voice
127

can add much greater detail, which can be shown in our allophonic
transcription.
9.10 Summary
In this unit, we have looked at how the VPM labels we learnt for consonants may
be modiﬁed according to a sound’s environment, and we have considered
variations in voicing, such as aspiration and unaspiration, devoicing of obstruents
and approximants, and voicing of /h/. We have seen how such variations can be
noted in an allophonic transcription and shown on a parametric diagram. We
have also considered the difference between phonemes and allophones, and
introduced the idea of coarticulation and allophonic transcription.
9.11 Looking forward
In the next unit, we will investigate allophonic variations of place of articulation.

1 Look at the following words and think about the consonants that are
emboldened. Remembering the rules for aspiration above, divide the words
into three groups, depending on whether the emboldened consonant is aspi-
rated, weakly aspirated or unaspirated, when each word is said in isolation.

UNIT 10 ALLOPHONIC VARIATIONS OF PLACE
10.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
ﬁnd out how allophones of a phoneme can vary in terms of place of articulation
*
see how these allophones can be divided into primary and secondary types
*
explore further how most allophonic variation is the result of coarticulation.
10.2 Introduction
In the last unit we saw that when we speak, we produce allophones. Phonemes
are made up of a number of different allophones, and the allophones are
produced in predictable ways according to the environment in which they
occur. In the last unit, we also saw that there are voicing variations, such as
aspiration and devoicing, which often occur due to coarticulation. In this unit,
we will see that within a phoneme there may also be variations in place of
articulation.
10.3 Variations in POA
10.3.1 Dental realisations
Exercise 10.1 Let us think about the phoneme /t/.
a)
What place label have you learnt for this sound?
b)
Now think about /t/ in the following words and try to decide if its
POA is the same in each one.
eighth
track
leant
Comment You will probably have remembered that we normally label /t/ as alveolar.
And in the word ‘leant’, its POA is indeed alveolar (unless you have replaced
it with a glottal stop [ʔ]). However, in ‘eighth’, you will probably have found
that the tongue touches the upper teeth, so the POA is dental; whereas in
‘track’, the tongue is further back in the mouth, closer to the postalveolar region
130

(unless you use a labiodental [ʋ] in ‘track’, in which case /t/ is likely to be
alveolar).
The /t/ in ‘eighth’ is dental due to the following dental fricative /θ/. This is
due to coarticulation, as the features of one sound inﬂuence an adjacent sound.
We use a diacritic to symbolise this allophone, in the same way that we use
diacritics to transcribe aspiration and devoicing. The diacritic indicating that a
sound’s POA is dental is [ ̪] underneath the symbol for that sound. You will
notice that the direction of coarticulation is anticipatory because the allophone
comes before the trigger sound.
Exercise 10.2 We have seen that /t/ is realised as [t̪] in ‘eighth’. However, we know from
looking at other allophones in the previous unit that the same processes of
coarticulation often apply to classes of sounds – that is, sounds with the same
voicing, manner or place. For example, devoicing occurs in the same environ-
ment for all voiced obstruents in English.
a)
What other sounds do you think might be realised as dental before dental
fricatives?
b)
Produce the following words, paying particular attention to the sound
before the dental fricative. Which of them are produced with a dental
POA?
wealth
menthol
everything
rose-thorn
breakthrough
Comment (a) and (b) The /k/ of ‘breakthrough’ and the vowel /i/ in ‘everything’
are unaffected by the following dental. The /l/ of ‘wealth’ and the /n/ of
‘menthol’ are both produced as dentals, so at ﬁrst it may appear that the
process is open to all alveolar sounds. However, the /s/ of ‘rose-thorn’ is
unaffected. We can therefore summarise the rule by saying that alveolar
stops (both plosives and nasals) and /l/ are realised as dental before a dental
fricative. You will have noticed that we are learning about lots of different
allophones and you may be ﬁnding them difﬁcult to remember. Recall that
you have a list of these allophones in Appendix 3, for ease of reference
(page 283).
10.3.2 Retraction
We have just seen that sounds we have initially classiﬁed as alveolar can in
fact be realised as dentals in a particular environment. In Exercise 10.1, we
also saw that the POA for /t/ in ‘track’ was further back in the mouth than
we might expect for a sound we classify as ‘alveolar’. When a sound is
produced with a POA that is further back in the mouth than most other
allophones of that phoneme, we call this process retraction. We symbolise
UNIT 10 Allophonic variations of place
131

retraction using the diacritic [ ̱] underneath another symbol in an allophonic
transcription.
Exercise 10.3 We have seen that /t/ is retracted before /r/, but, again, we need to see if our rule
should be any broader. In particular, we need to see if it is only /r/ which triggers
retraction of alveolars.
Produce the following words, concentrating particularly on the alveolar
stops and /l/. Before which sounds are they retracted?
pinch
draw
heads
welsh
width
Comment You should ﬁnd that /n/ is retracted before /ʃ/ (or /tʃ/, depending on
your pronunciation) in ‘pinch’. /d/ is retracted before /r/ in ‘draw’
(unless you use [ʋ] in this word), and /l/ is retracted before /ʃ/ in ‘welsh’.
The alveolar /z/ of ‘heads’ does not affect the /d/, and we know that the
/θ/ in ‘width’ will actually cause the /t/ to be realised as a dental. Therefore,
we can summarise by saying that alveolar stops and /l/ are retracted before
postalveolar sounds (such as /ʃ ʒ tʃ dʒ/ and [ɹ]). Again, this process is antici-
patory. The alveolar fricatives sometimes behave in a similar way, but, for
various reasons, we will leave these until Unit 17, where we deal with place
assimilation.
Exercise 10.4 Alveolars are not the only consonants that can be retracted. Sounds that we
classify as velar phonemes can also be retracted, but in different environments
to the retraction of alveolars. We use the same symbol as for retraction of
alveolars, but this time the symbol means that the POA is approaching the
uvular region.
Think about and produce the following words, concentrating on the
emboldened velar phonemes.
queen
geese
ghoul
Gwent
caught
crab
get
a)
In which words are the velars retracted? Think about whether your tongue
touches the velum or further back in the mouth.
b)
How might we summarise the environment for retraction of velars?
Comment a)
Hopefully, you have found that /k/ and /g/ are retracted in ‘queen’, ‘ghoul’,
‘Gwent’ and ‘caught’.
b)
If we look closely at these words, we see that the environment for retraction
is before back vowels (/u/ and /ɔ/ in these examples) and /w/. Of course,
this makes sense when we think about coarticulation. An upcoming back
tongue position affects the POA of a previous ‘velar’. We know that /w/ is
produced in almost the same way as /u/, which explains why /w/ has the
same effect as the back vowels. Again, this is an anticipatory process, as the
velar is affected by the following sound.
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
132

10.3.3 Advancement
Conversely, velar sounds can also be produced at a POA further forward in the
mouth than the phoneme’s place label would suggest, which is known as
advancement. We use the diacritic [˖] underneath another symbol to signify
that that sound is advanced.
Exercise 10.5 a)
In what environments do you think velars might be advanced?
Tip Keep in mind the rule for retraction of velars.
b)
Produce the following words, concentrating on the velars to see if you
are correct.
cute
cake
girl
cube
geese
Comment a)
You may have worked out, by comparison with the environment for
retraction, that velars will be advanced before front vowels, and thus
advancement is an anticipatory process.
b)
Advancement of velars happens in ‘cake’ (where the ﬁrst element of the
diphthong /eɪ/ is a front vowel) and ‘geese’ (where the vowel /i/ is a
front vowel). As /j/ is so similar in articulation to the front vowel /i/, we
ﬁnd that velars are also advanced in front of /j/, as in ‘cute’ and ‘cube’.
When velar sounds are advanced, the place of articulation is actually near
to the palatal region.
We saw previously that velars are retracted before back vowels, and
advanced before front vowels. But what about central vowels? As you will notice
if you think carefully about /g/ in ‘girl’, velars have a truly velar POA before
central vowels.
10.3.4 A note about advancement and dental realisations
As just explained, for articulations further back in the mouth than VPM labels
suggest, we use the same term, retraction, and diacritic [ ̱ ] for both velars and
alveolars. We do this, even though the resulting POA is different: close to uvular
for velars, and postalveolar for alveolars. However, for articulations further
forward in the mouth, we use two different terms and diacritics: advancement
[ ̟ ] for velars and dental [ ̪ ] for alveolars. In the latter case, it would not be
strictly incorrect to use the term ‘advancement’ instead of ‘dental’, but the term
‘dental’ is more speciﬁc and we will continue to use it in this book.
Exercise 10.6 You now know the rules for advancement, retraction and dental realisations.
Have a look at the following words, and produce them while concentrating
on the velar and alveolar consonants emboldened. Work out for each word
whether you need to add a diacritic for dental realisations, retraction or
UNIT 10 Allophonic variations of place
133

advancement in allophonic transcription, or if the consonant in question is in
fact produced at the place of articulation that we learnt in Unit 3.
course
craze
health
keen
garbage
cue
cage
trams
bells
Tip Remember to bear in mind the environments for each allophone that we have
investigated above.
Comment ‘course’ has a retracted /k/ as it occurs before the back vowel /ɔ/. In ‘craze’, there
are no place variations, as the /k/ is not affected by postalveolar sounds such
as /r/. ‘health’ has a dental /l/ due to the following dental fricative. ‘keen’ has an
advanced /k/, as the following sound is the front vowel /i/. ‘garbage’ has a
retracted /g/ due to the following back vowel /ɑ/. ‘cue’ has an advanced /k/, as
does ‘cage’, due to the following /j/ and /eɪ/, respectively. ‘trams’ has a retracted
/t/ due to the following postalveolar /r/. The /l/ in ‘bells’ is alveolar, as stated in
its VPM label.
Note that for speakers who use a labiodental realisation of /r/ in all positions,
this sound will not trigger retraction of preceding alveolars in words like
‘trams’. However, many speakers with labiodental /r/ everywhere else (myself
included), actually use a postalveolar realisation of /r/ when following /t/ or /d/,
and retract the alveolars accordingly.
10.3.5 Labiodental realisations
There is another type of place variation that we need to look at. When sounds
classiﬁed as bilabial /p b m/ come immediately before the labiodental fricatives
/fv/, their place of articulation may in fact be labiodental.
Exercise 10.7 Think about the /m/ in ‘triumph’ and work out if you can see and feel that the
POA of the /m/ is indeed labiodental. Try the same exercise with the bilabials in
‘obvious’ and ‘typeface’.
Comment For some speakers, the /m/ in ‘triumph’, /b/ in ‘obvious’ and /p/ in ‘typeface’
are all labiodental, due to the presence of the upcoming labiodental sound.
Again, this realisation is due to anticipatory coarticulation, where the articu-
lators anticipate the following sound.
The diacritic for these labiodental realisations is the same as that for dental
realisations, [ ̪ ], which can be somewhat confusing. It is important to
remember, however, that the diacritic means labiodental when it occurs under
an otherwise bilabial symbol, and dental when it occurs under an otherwise
alveolar symbol. In addition, the IPA provides a unique symbol for a voiced
labiodental nasal, which is [ɱ], as can be seen on the IPA chart in Appendix 1
(page 281). Thus, [ɱ] and [m̪ ] symbolise the same sound.
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
134

10.4 Secondary articulations and variations of place
In all the examples we have looked at above, the place of articulation of a sound
is different to that stated in the VPM label that we give by default to the
phoneme. So, those phonemes that we would classify as alveolar can in fact be
realised as postalveolar or dental, according to their environment. Similarly,
velars can be realised with places of articulation near to the uvular or palatal
regions, and bilabials can be labiodental. The labels that we learnt in Unit 3
relate only broadly to the phonetic detail that we now know about.
As you know, the term ‘place of articulation’ refers to the greatest con-
striction in the vocal tract, and this can also be referred to as the primary
articulation. For the allophonic variations we have just considered, the primary
articulation is different to most other allophones of the phoneme in question,
and we can refer to these as primary variations of place.
There is another type of variation of place that does not relate to the location
of the primary articulation, but in which an extra, or secondary, constriction is
added in the vocal tract. This secondary articulation is always of a lesser degree
of stricture than the primary articulation. So, for example, the primary articu-
lation may be a plosive, and the secondary articulation an approximant. We will
refer to these types of variation as secondary variations of place, and will look
at several types.
10.4.1 Labialisation
Labialisation is the technical term for lip-rounding. Any consonant can be
labialised before rounded vowels or before /w/. We use the diacritic [ʷ] to the
right of a symbol to symbolise labialisation, as shown in the ‘Diacritics’ section
of the full IPA chart in Appendix 1 (page 281).
Exercise 10.8 Let us compare ‘teak’ and ‘tweak’, by producing them and thinking about the
initial alveolar in each case.
a)
Firstly, see if you can reassure yourself that the primary place of articulation
for /t/ is alveolar in both words.
b)
Now try to work out if you can see or feel lip-rounding during the /t/ in
either of the words. It may help to look in a mirror, or to ask someone else
to say the words for you.
c)
Now do the same exercise for ‘spoon’ and ‘span’, concentrating on the /p/.
Comment a)
You should ﬁnd that the primary articulation for /t/ is alveolar in both words.
b)
However, if you look in a mirror you should see that there is lip-rounding
during the /t/ in ‘tweak’, due to the inﬂuence of the following /w/, but not
during ‘teak’.
UNIT 10 Allophonic variations of place
135

c)
In both ‘spoon’ and ‘span’, /p/ is bilabial, but you will likely see lip-
rounding during the /p/ of ‘spoon’, due to the inﬂuence of the following
rounded vowel /u/.
In fact, labialisation applies to any consonant when it occurs before a
rounded vowel or /w/, and, as we have said, we use the diacritic [ʷ] to indicate
labialisation in allophonic transcription. Because consonants are affected by the
following sound, this is an anticipatory process. Labialisation does not affect the
primary articulation of the sound, but adds another constriction. This con-
striction is a secondary articulation, because it is less extreme than the other,
primary, articulation. For example, the primary articulation for /t/ in ‘tweak’ is
at the alveolar ridge, and, as it is a plosive, this is a stronger constriction (that is,
the articulators are closer together) than the lip-rounding, in which there is wide
approximation between the articulators.
We now know that sounds are labialised before rounded vowels or /w/. In
fact, as we know, all the rounded vowels in English are also back vowels.
Therefore, labialisation occurs in the same environment in which velars are
retracted – that is, before back vowels and /w/.
Exercise 10.9 Think about the word ‘course’ from Exercise 10.6 (page 133) and try to answer
the following.
a)
Do we expect the velar to be retracted?
b)
Do we expect there to be lip-rounding during the velar?
c)
Do we know of any other variations of /k/ that will apply in this word when
it is spoken in isolation?
d)
Can more than one allophonic variation apply to the same phoneme at the
same time?
Comment (a) and (b)
We know that /k/ will be retracted before the back vowel /ɔ/. We
also know that /k/ will be labialised, because /ɔ/ is rounded. In
fact, the /k/ is both retracted and labialised in this word.
c)
You may also have noticed that the /k/ will be aspirated, as it is a
voiceless plosive at the start of a stressed syllable.
d)
Thus, allophones of a phoneme can actually differ from each other
in several different ways, and an allophonic transcription notes all
these variations. So, in ‘course’, /k/ is realised as an aspirated
voiceless retracted velar plosive with lip-rounding, and it could be
transcribed allophonically as [ḵʷʰ]. Remember that an allophone is
the actual sound that we produce, and we include as much detail
about it as possible in our allophonic transcriptions.
Of course, not all allophonic variations can combine, because some articu-
lations are mutually exclusive. An allophone of /t/ cannot be both retracted and
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
136

dental, for example, or both aspirated and unaspirated, as these have mutually
incompatible articulations (and they occur in mutually exclusive environ-
ments). As a rule of thumb, a single realisation might have one difference of
voice, one of primary articulation, one of secondary articulation, and one of
manner from most other allophones of that phoneme.
10.4.2 Palatalisation
We have seen that labialisation does not affect the primary POA of a sound, but
instead adds a secondary articulation at the lips. Palatalisation is similar to
labialisation in this regard, but a secondary articulation is added in the palatal
region of the vocal tract. We use the diacritic [ʲ] to the right of another symbol
to symbolise palatalisation.
Exercise 10.10 Think about the words ‘noon’ and ‘news’ and transcribe them broadly. Be very
careful to think about whether you produce a /j/ after the /n/ in ‘news’. Most
speakers of SSBE will, but some American speakers, those with some British
accents, and younger British English speakers may never produce /j/ in this and
similar words. This exercise will only work for speakers who do produce a /j/ in
‘news’, so you may wish to get a friend to say them if this exercise does not work
for you.
a)
Concentrate on the /n/ in each of these words. In particular, think about
how your tongue feels, and which parts of the tongue are high in the mouth.
b)
Do you notice a difference between /n/ in the two words?
Comment (a) and (b) If you do produce a /j/ in ‘news’, you will have felt that the front of
the tongue comes close to the palatal region of the mouth during /n/, whereas
this did not happen in ‘noon’. Again, this is an effect of anticipatory coarticu-
lation as the tongue prepares to produce /j/ during the /n/. In fact, any non-velar
sound is palatalised before /j/.
Exercise 10.11 Think about the statement above, ‘any non-velar sound is palatalised before /j/’,
and about the primary POA allophones we have already discussed in this unit.
a)
Why are only non-velar sounds palatalised before /j/?
b)
What happens to velar sounds in this environment (before /j/)?
Comment (a) and (b) As we have seen in ‘news’, /n/ is alveolar, as in most other
environments, but gains a secondary articulation in the palatal region. However,
velar sounds are advanced before the palatal approximant /j/, as we saw above.
In a word like ‘queue’, therefore, the presence of the palatal actually affects the
primary POA of the velar, which we say has been advanced to nearer the palatal
place of articulation.
UNIT 10 Allophonic variations of place
137

10.4.3 Velarisation
Exercise 10.12 Given your knowledge of palatalisation and labialisation, what do you think
velarisation might mean?
Comment Velarisation means a secondary articulation in the velar region of the vocal tract.
Like palatalisation and labialisation, velarisation is a secondary POA variant,
so will not inﬂuence the primary POA of any sound it affects. Velarisation applies
primarily to /l/ in English, but only occurs in certain environments.
Exercise 10.13 Think about and produce the words ‘little’ and ‘lulled’. In each word, compare
the /l/ in the onset with the /l/ in the coda, and concentrate on the shape of your
tongue, particularly towards the back.
What do you notice?
Comment This can be quite difﬁcult to feel, but hopefully you noticed that the back of your
tongue comes close to the velar region of the mouth for the /l/s that are in the
coda, but that there is no such approximation for the onset /l/s. The two tongue
shapes are shown in Figure 10.1. In SSBE, /l/s are velarised when syllabic or
when in the coda of a syllable (see Unit 8 for a reminder of these terms),
provided they are not immediately followed by a vowel. Another name for
velarised /l/ is dark /l/, and we can use the diacritic [ˠ] to the right of a symbol to
show velarisation in general, or the special symbol [ɫ] to indicate a velarised /l/.
In this book, we will not use the use the [ɫ] symbol, to avoid confusion with the
symbol for a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative [ɬ]. Instead, we will use the [ˠ]
diacritic, for consistency with other allophonic variations, such as palatalisation
[ʲ] and labialisation [ʷ]. Note that non-velarised /l/s are called clear /l/s, and no
diacritic is added to the symbol we use for the phoneme: [l] signiﬁes a clear /l/.
Take care to remember that [l] is an allophone of /l/, just as [lˠ] is, even though it
does not have any diacritics added in an allophonic transcription.
Consonants before the [lˠ] can also be velarised – for example, in ‘hustle’,
both the /s/ and the /l/ are velarised: [hʌsˠlˠ]. When /l/ occurs between two
vowels, it tends to be clear.
Figure 10.1 Mid-sagittal sections showing the production of non-velarised (left) and
velarised (right) /l/
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
138

Exercise 10.14 We have seen that labialisation and palatalisation are the result of coarticula-
tion. Labialisation occurs due to an upcoming sound with lip-rounding, and
palatalisation occurs due to an upcoming palatal sound.
Let us think again about ‘little’ and ‘lulled’, and about the rule mentioned
above for velarisation.
Do you think velarisation comes about because of a velar sound in the
environment?
Comment Velarisation is rather different to the other secondary place allophones we have
looked at. Velarisation is not the result of coarticulation due to a velar segment
in the environment. Instead, syllable position determines whether /l/ is velarised
or not, as we have seen above. We refer to this as a rule-based or extrinsic
allophone, because it cannot be predicted from the surrounding sounds.
Extrinsic allophones tend to be language-speciﬁc rather than universal. So,
whereas labialisation will happen in many languages before rounded vowels, for
example, not all languages will velarise /l/ syllable ﬁnally.
10.4.3.1 Accent-speciﬁc allophones of /l/
Different regional accents of English also have different allophones of /l/.
Scottish English speakers tend to use velarised /l/ in all positions, including
onsets, while Welsh and Irish English speakers tend to have clear /l/ in all
positions, including codas. Many accents, such as Cockney, use a vocalised /l/
wherever SSBE uses a dark /l/. When a consonant is vocalised, it becomes more
like a vowel. For vocalised /l/, the velar approximation of dark /l/ remains, but
the tongue tip contact is removed, resulting in a sound like a high back vowel,
which can be symbolised as [o] or [ʊ]. These variants would be recorded in an
allophonic transcription but in a broad transcription, all variants will simply be
transcribed as /l/.
10.4.4 Glottal reinforcement
In Unit 3, we saw that speakers often use a glottal plosive [ʔ] as a version (we
now know the term ‘allophone’) of /t/ in English, a situation we referred to as
‘glottalling’ or ‘glottal replacement’. However, it is also possible to produce a
glottal plosive at the same time as, or slightly before, the oral closure for the
voiceless plosives /p t k/, when they occur at the end of an utterance. This is
known as glottal reinforcement, or glottalisation, and can be shown by adding
the [ʔ] symbol to our allophonic transcriptions before the sound that is glottally
reinforced.
Exercise 10.15 Produce the following words and try to work out if you are producing a glottal
plosive at the same time as (or slightly before) the ﬁnal voiceless consonant.
rat
rack
rap
UNIT 10 Allophonic variations of place
139

Comment It can be quite difﬁcult to work out whether or not you are glottally reinforcing
voiceless plosives, so it might be worth practising several times and asking a
teacher to check for you. In addition, you may have used glottal replacement in
‘rat’ in this exercise. People also vary in whether or not they use glottal
reinforcement, and this can depend on their accent, or just the situation in
which they are speaking. As glottalisation varies substantially between and
within speakers, we will not include it in allophonic transcriptions in the
following units.
10.5 Summary
In this unit, we have explored allophones of place of articulation. We have
looked at variations in the primary articulation, such as advancement and
retraction, and variations when a secondary articulation is added, such as
labialisation and velarisation.

In the next unit we will explore allophonic variations of manner.

UNIT 11 ALLOPHONIC VARIATIONS OF MANNER
11.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
explore how allophones of a phoneme can vary in manner of articulation
*
discover how these allophones can relate to the approach and release
phases of plosives
*
investigate nasalisation.
11.2 Introduction
So far, we have looked at how a phoneme’s allophones can vary in terms of
voicing and place of articulation. Here, we will think about how they can vary in
manner. We will start by thinking about nasalisation, a topic that we will
continue in the next unit, about vowel allophones.
11.3 Nasalisation
Exercise 11.1 Just using your knowledge of the English language, and the phonetics termi-
nology you have learnt so far, what do you think the following terms might
mean?
nasal
nasalise
nasalisation
Comment You know from previous units that nasals are consonants with a complete
blockage to airﬂow in the oral cavity, but with a lowered velum so that air
escapes through the nose. The nasals in English are /m n ˛/. The sufﬁx ‘-ise’
(or ‘-ize’) means something like ‘cause to be’, and is used to turn a noun into a
verb. In this book, for example, we use words like ‘symbolise’, and words like
‘visualise’ are common in everyday language. Therefore, ‘nasalise’ means
something like ‘to cause something to be nasal’. The sufﬁx ‘-tion’ is also
common in English and is used to turn a verb into a noun. More speciﬁcally, it is
added to a verb to mean an instance of that verb. So, for example, we have the
142

verb ‘to demonstrate’, and a ‘demonstration’ is an instance of people demon-
strating. ‘Nasalisation’, then, is an instance of something being nasalised.
As we have seen in the previous units, speech is not a string of separate
segments, even though this is a convenient way to think about it. Speech sounds
overlap, and coarticulation means that sounds affect one another. One way in
which manner of articulation is affected is that sounds can be nasalised in
certain environments. For these nasalised sounds, the velum is lowered so that
air can ﬂow through the nasal cavity. Unlike nasal consonants, however, there is
no blockage to airﬂow in the oral cavity. Therefore, nasalisation means that
there is simultaneous oral and nasal airﬂow.
Exercise 11.2 Thinking back to what you know about manner of articulation, and rereading
the comment on Exercise 11.1, what manners of sounds do you think can be
nasalised, and which cannot?
Tip Think back to what we discovered about obstruent and sonorant sounds in
Unit 4.
Comment As you will remember from Unit 4, obstruent sounds (such as plosives, frica-
tives and affricates) must have velic closure, as they need pressure to build in the
oral cavity. If the velum is lowered, air can escape through the nasal cavity and
pressure cannot build. Therefore, obstruents cannot be nasalised. Sonorants
(vowels, nasals and approximants, including lateral approximants) do not need
pressure to build, which means that they do not need velic closure, and, in fact,
nasals must have velic opening. For approximants, however, velic closure is
optional, and when they are produced without velic closure, they are nasalised.
What we will see shortly is that whether the velum is open or closed during
approximant sounds is largely due to coarticulation.
Mid-sagittal sections for a non-nasalised (left) and nasalised (right)
approximant /j/ are shown in Figure 11.1. Note that the position of the velum is
different in the two pictures.

Exercise 11.3 The diacritic for nasalisation is [ ˜ ] above the symbol for the sound that is
nasalised. Look at the following data. Which sounds are nasalised, and in which
environments?
[j̃æ̃m]
[pɑsnɪ ̃p]
[gɹ̃ĩn bĩn]
[l̃ɛ̃ntɪl]
[w̃ɪ̃ntə mɛ̃l̃ə̃n]
[mũli]
Comment First of all, you should observe that only vowels and approximants are nasalised.
As we said before, this is because velic closure is optional for these sounds.
Importantly, these sounds are only nasalised in the vicinity of a nasal consonant
in English. Nasalisation works in both directions – that is, it is both anticipatory
and perseverative. However, the anticipatory effect is stronger, and we will
reﬂect this by assuming that it affects up to two segments, whereas only one
segment can be nasalised following a nasal (compare the two segments after the
/m/ in ‘mooli’ with the two segments before the /n/ in ‘green’).
Exercise 11.4 Why do you think sounds are nasalised in the environment of a nasal
consonant?
Comment The answer, of course, involves coarticulation. For a nasal consonant, the velum
has to be lowered. Therefore, the vocal tract can begin to prepare for a nasal
consonant by lowering the velum before the other articulators are in position
for that nasal. For example, in ‘yam’, which we worked on in Exercise 11.3, the
velum begins to lower before the bilabial closure for /m/. This results in oral and
nasal airﬂow for the approximant and vowel, so they are nasalised. Likewise, in
‘parsnip’, the velum does not immediately return to a closed position after the
/n/, so there is oral and nasal airﬂow in the following vowel. If an obstruent is
next to the nasal, however, the velum must be raised throughout that obstruent,
so there is no coarticulatory effect.
Note that in other languages, such as French, sounds can be nasalised
(have simultaneous oral and nasal airﬂow) without being in the vicinity of a
nasal consonant. Nasalisation can also make a contrast in meaning in other
languages. In French, for example, /sɛ/ means ‘knows’, while /sɛ̃/ means
‘saint’. So, nasalisation need not be a result of coarticulation, even though it is
in English.
Nasalisation can be shown in a parametric diagram, in a similar way to
how we showed allophonic variations of voicing in Unit 9. Figure 11.2 shows a
parametric diagram of velum height in the word ‘parsnip’. Again, the vertical
lines represent beginnings and ends of the individual segments within the
word. The height of the horizontal line in the diagram represents the position
of the velum at each point in the word, with a low line representing a lowered
velum and a high line representing a closed velum (velic closure). Notice that
the velum moves during the nasalised /ɪ/, as shown by the sloping line. We will
look at parametric diagrams, and how to draw them, in much more detail in
Unit 13.

11.4 Allophonic variations of manner relating to plosives
We now turn to some allophonic variations relating to plosives, so we need to
remind ourselves brieﬂy of the articulation of plosives.
Exercise 11.5 Remind yourself about the three stages of plosive production and draw a
diagram to represent these phases. Try to do this without looking back in the
book, but have a look back at Unit 4 if you get stuck.
Comment In Unit 4, we talked about how plosives are produced and we distinguished
three phases. Firstly, the active articulator approaches the passive
articulator, in a phase called the approach phase. The middle phase is the
hold phase, where two articulators are in contact, and air builds up behind
this closure. After the hold phase is the release phase, where the active
articulator moves away from the passive articulator and air escapes from the
vocal tract. Figure 11.3 represents the three phases, with the top line
showing the passive articulator, and the bottom line showing the active
articulator.
We can be more detailed, however, about the approach and release phases of
plosives, and refer to them as wide oral approach and release, when they occur
as shown in Figure 11.3. We use the term ‘wide’ because the active articulator
moves far away from the passive articulator, and ‘oral’ because the air is
released through the oral cavity. We will see shortly that other types of approach
and release are possible.

11.4.1 Nasal approach and release
Exercise 11.6 a)
Produce the word ‘wed’. Concentrate on the /d/ sound and the movements
your articulators make to produce it. Can you feel the approach, hold and
release phases?
b)
Now produce the word ‘when’. Concentrate on the /n/. Again, what
movements of the articulators can you feel?
c)
Now think about the word ‘wend’. Logically, what might you expect to feel
for the /n/ and the /d/ in this word, based on what you discovered for /n/
and /d/ above?
d)
Try producing the word ‘wend’. What do you feel? Speciﬁcally, do you feel
two approach, hold and release phases?
Comment a)
For /d/ in ‘wed’, you probably felt your tongue approaching your alveolar
ridge, making a ﬁrm closure in the hold phase, and then moving away
quickly to a position of wide approximation, before the articulators return
to their resting positions.
b)
For /n/ in ‘when’, the articulators move in a very similar way, with the
tongue approaching the alveolar ridge and making contact with it for a
short time before moving away again. The major difference between /n/
and /d/ is that the velum is lowered for /n/, so air does build up behind the
closure.
c)
Given that /n/ and /d/ both have approach, hold and release phases, you
might have expected ‘wend’ to contain two approach, hold and release
phases.
d)
Instead, however, you would only have felt your tongue approach and leave
the alveolar ridge once.
The reason that you only feel one approach and release is that the /d/ is
nasally rather than orally approached. To produce the /n/, the tongue
approaches the alveolar ridge and makes ﬁrm contact with it. Meanwhile, the
velum is lowered, so that air escapes through the nose. To move from an /n/ to a
/d/, however, the tongue does not need to approach the alveolar ridge, as it is
already in place. In fact, all that needs to happen is for the velum to raise, closing
off the nasal cavity, so that air can build up behind the alveolar closure.
Therefore, the /d/ is not approached orally by raising the tongue tip, but nasally
by closing off the nasal cavity: this is called nasal approach. Try Exercise 11.6
again, to see if you can feel the stages just described in ‘wend’.
Exercise 11.7 In Exercise 11.6, we looked at nasal approach. What do you think nasal release
might be? Can you think of an example word where it might occur?
Comment Nasal release means that a plosive consonant is not released orally by moving
the active articulator away from the passive articulator. Instead, the velum is
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
146

lowered, so that air escapes through the nose, and the sound becomes a nasal.
An example might be a word like ‘hidden’, if /n/ is syllabic and there is no schwa
between the /d/ and /n/ (as, obviously, the plosive and nasal must be adjacent for
nasal approach or release to occur).
Exercise 11.8 The diacritic for nasal approach and release is [n]. This occurs as a superscript to
the left of the plosive for nasal approach, and to the right for nasal release.
Look at the data below. You will notice that not all nasal-plosive combina-
tions result in nasal approach or release of the plosive. Can you spot the
condition for the occurrence of nasal approach or release? (Other diacritics are
omitted for clarity.)
[hænnd]
[hæ˛dɒg]
[lɪmnbəʊ]
[kɪdnnĩ]
[kæmdən]
Comment You will see that nasal approach and nasal release only occur when the nasal
and plosive have the same place of articulation. This makes sense, since, if the
place of articulation of the two is different, the speaker must do more than
simply change the position of the velum, and therefore the plosive will be
approached or released orally. Another word for the same place of articulation
is homorganic.
The examples in Exercise 11.8 all use voiced plosives, but nasal approach
and release also apply to voiceless plosives, as long as they are adjacent to a
homorganic nasal – for example, in ‘lint’, or ‘kitten’, produced with a
syllabic /n/. Of course, to change from /t/ to /n/, or vice versa, the state of the
glottis also needs to alter, but the approach and release is the same as that
described for the voiced plosives.
Note that in a parametric diagram, nasal approach and release are not
shown as nasalisation of the plosive. The velum must be lowered for the nasal
and closed for the plosive, so must move rapidly between them. It cannot move
during the production of the plosive in normal speech, as the plosive requires a
closed velum throughout so that pressure can build, and therefore moves
towards the end of the nasal, as shown in Figure 11.4 for nasal approach.

11.4.2 Lateral approach and release
Exercise 11.9 Given what you know about nasal approach and release, what do you think is
meant by lateral approach and release, and in which environments might these
occur?
Comment The label ‘lateral approach and release’ gives you much of the information you
need to work out what types of allophonic variation are described. The
‘approach and release’ part of the label tells you that we are again thinking
about allophonic variation of plosives. The ‘lateral’ part of the label suggests
that the plosive is approached or released in a lateral manner – that is, by
moving the sides of the tongue. You might have surmised, therefore, that
plosives will be laterally approached or released when they are adjacent to a
lateral consonant, which in English can only be /l/. Furthermore, you may
have thought back to our discussion earlier in this chapter, and imagined
that the plosive and /l/ will have to be homorganic. Consequently, as /l/ is
alveolar, only the alveolar plosives /t/ and /d/ can be laterally approached or
released.
Exercise 11.10 a)
As in Exercise 11.6, produce the word ‘wed’. Concentrate on the /d/ sound
and the movements your articulators make to produce it. Can you feel the
approach, hold and release phases?
b)
Now produce the word ‘well’. Concentrate on the /l/. Again, what articu-
latory movements can you feel?
c)
Now think about the word ‘weld’. What do you feel? Speciﬁcally, when do
you feel the tongue tip approach the alveolar ridge?
Comment a)
When the /d/ is at the end of ‘wed’, you can feel the tongue tip approaching
the alveolar ridge, making ﬁrm contact and then moving away again.
b)
In ‘well’, we ﬁnd a similar sort of articulation for /l/, in that the tongue tip
rises and forms a ﬁrm contact with the alveolar ridge. Here, however, the
sides of the tongue remain lowered and in wide approximation with the
alveolar ridge, so that air ﬂows over the sides of the tongue.
c)
In ‘weld’, the tongue tip contacts the alveolar ridge for /l/ and remains there
for /d/. The sides of the tongue change position, however. After being
lowered for /l/, they rise for /d/ and make ﬁrm contact with the roof of
the mouth. Therefore, the only change in the articulators between /l/
and /d/ is in the position of the sides of the tongue. As the tongue tip
has not risen in the approach to /d/, we say that /d/ is laterally
approached.
Lateral release is much as you would expect, given what you know already.
Here, a /t/ or /d/ is followed immediately by an /l/, and is released by lowering
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
148

the sides of the tongue to a position of wide approximation, so that air can ﬂow
over the sides of the tongue. For example, in ‘little’ or ‘huddle’, the alveolar
plosives are laterally released (so long as the /l/ is syllabic and no schwa occurs
before it), as is the /d/ in ‘medley’.
Lateral approach and release are symbolised in transcription by the super-
script diacritic [l], which occurs to the left of the plosive for lateral approach and
to the right of it for lateral release.
Exercise 11.11 Give allophonic transcriptions of the following. Concentrate on manner allo-
phones, but also try to include allophonic details of voice and place.
mitten
Santa
felt
metal
candle
molten
Comment The allophonic transcriptions are [mɪ ̃tnn], [sæ̃nntə], [fɛlˠlt], [mɛ̃tllˠ],
[k̟hæ̃nndllˠ] and [mɒ̃lˠltnn]. You will notice that plosives can be both nasally
approached and laterally released, as in ‘candle’, or laterally approached and
nasally released, as in ‘molten’. This is an exception to our rule of thumb from
Unit 10, where we said that, in general, only one variation of manner would
occur at any one time. This exception is because one variation affects the
approach phase, and one the release phase of a plosive, and therefore the
articulations are not incompatible. Of course, plosives cannot be laterally
approached and nasally approached at the same time (or laterally released and
nasally released), because they cannot be preceded (or followed) by a lateral and
a nasal simultaneously.
Note, also, that the plosives will only be nasally or laterally released if they
are directly followed by a nasal or a lateral, which is often the case when the nasal
or lateral is syllabic, but not if a schwa intervenes. This depends very much on
an individual’s pronunciation, as we have seen. If a person produces ‘mitten’,
‘metal’ and ‘candle’ with a schwa following the plosive, then the transcriptions
will be [mɪ̃tə̃n], [mɛ̃təlˠ] and [k̟hæ̃nndəlˠ].
We will now turn our attention to several more ways in which plosives may
be released.
11.4.3 Narrow release
Exercise 11.12 Say the following pairs of sentences. Focus on the release of the /t/ in pair (a)
and the release of the /d/ in pair (b). Do you notice a difference between the
members of each pair?
a)
Say cat again
Say cats again
b)
Say card again
Say cards again
Comment In ‘cat’ and ‘card’, the plosives have a wide oral release, as we discussed in our
description of ‘standard’ plosives in Unit 4, and at the start of this unit. In ‘cats’
UNIT 11 Allophonic variations of manner
149

and ‘cards’, however, the release phases of the plosives are much narrower.
Rather than moving far away from the alveolar ridge, as in the ﬁrst example, the
tongue moves into narrow approximation in preparation for the following
alveolar fricatives. Thus, we say the plosives are narrowly released.
Exercise 11.13 The diacritics for narrow release are shown in the allophonic transcriptions
below.
[kætss]
[kɑdzz]
a)
Why do you think the diacritic is different in the different words?
b)
What do you think is the environment for narrow release of plosives?
Comment a)
The diacritic always takes the form of the following fricative.
b)
Plosives are narrowly released when they are followed by a fricative at
the same place of articulation – that is, one that is homorganic with the
plosive.
Exercise 11.14 Will the /t/ in ‘width’ be narrowly released? Give an allophonic transcription of
this word. (Depending on your pronunciation, the plosive in ‘width’ might be
/d/, but the exercise will still work.)
Comment At ﬁrst glance, it might appear that /t/ (or /d/) will have wide oral release,
because it is alveolar and /θ/ is dental. However, as you may remember from
Unit 10, /t/ is actually produced with a dental place of articulation when it is
before a dental fricative due to coarticulation, and, consequently, both plosive
and fricative are dental. As we have a homorganic plosive and fricative, there-
fore, the plosive will be narrowly released and the allophonic transcription will
be [wɪt̪θθ].
11.4.4 Ejective release
As we have already seen in Unit 7, in English, voiceless plosives can sometimes
be produced as voiceless ejective plosives before a pause.
Exercise 11.15 Remind yourself of how an ejective sounds and the diacritic we use to symbolise
ejectives. Try to produce ejective versions of /p t k/.
Comment We looked at ejectives in Unit 7, and demonstrated their use in English with the
word ‘quick’ spoken with some urgency. They have a distinctive sharp sound at
the release, while the approach and hold phases are much the same as for
pulmonic plosives. You will remember that this distinct sound comes from the
larynx being raised so that pressure increases behind the oral closure. In
English, any voiceless plosive before a pause can be produced as an ejective, and
the diacritic we use to symbolise ejective release is [’], to the right of the
appropriate plosive symbol.
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
150

You may have noted by now that diacritics relating to the release phase
occur to the right of a plosive symbol, and those relating to approach appear to
the left. As we transcribe from left to right, you can remember this by recalling
the logical order of the approach and release phases (approach comes ﬁrst, so we
symbolise it ﬁrst – that is, on the left of the symbol).
11.4.5 No audible release
It is also possible that the release of a plosive cannot be heard, and this is known
as inaudible release or no audible release. Note that this does not mean that the
plosive is not released (although we will see some examples of that later), just
that the release cannot be heard.
Exercise 11.16 The diacritic for an inaudibly released plosive is [ ̚ ] to the right of the plosive
symbol. Plosives are inaudibly released in three environments, shown in (a) to
(c) below. Can you spot what the three environments are? (Each word is
assumed to be in isolation rather than part of a phrase.)
a) [ʌp̚ɡɹeɪd ̚]
[tʃɪk̚pi]
[wæɡ̚teɪlz]
b) [bɹɛk̚fəst̚]
[kʊk̚sən]
[əb̚zɒlv]
c) [ɔk̚]
[blit̚]
[sid ̚]
Comment a)
The inaudibly released plosives are those that occur before a plosive at a
different place of articulation.
b)
The inaudibly released plosives occur immediately before fricatives with a
different place of articulation.
c)
They occur at the end of words, with examples of this type also seen in
(a) and (b). Note that inaudible release at the end of words happens
only when the plosives occur before a pause, and not if another word
follows.
In Exercise 11.16, in (a) and (b), the plosive release is inaudible because it is
covered or masked by something else. When a plosive or fricative follows at a
different place of articulation (which we call heterorganic), the hold phase of
the second plosive or the friction of the fricative overlaps with the release of the
ﬁrst plosive, so that the release cannot be heard, as shown in Figures 11.5
and 11.6.
Immediately before a pause, both voiced and voiceless plosives can be
released inaudibly. Here, the closure is released rather slowly and gently, so the
air escapes silently, rather than with the wide oral release and audible plosion
found in other positions.
UNIT 11 Allophonic variations of manner
151

Exercise 11.17 We have just said that plosives may be inaudibly released before a pause. Does
this contradict anything else we have said in this unit, and, if so, is this
contradiction a problem?
Comment In the sections above, we have given two possible allophonic variations for
voiceless plosives before a pause. In the ﬁrst instance, we have said that voiceless
plosives can be ejective before a pause (section 11.4.4), and, in the second
instance, that all plosives, including voiceless ones, can be inaudibly released
before a pause (section 11.4.5). This would seem to be a problem for comple-
mentary distribution, which, as we learnt earlier, means that only one allophone
of a phoneme can occur in any particular environment. However, as we shall
now see, there are some cases in which it is possible for alternative allophones of
a phoneme to occur in the same environment.

152

11.5 Free allophonic variation and complementary distribution
In Unit 9, we ﬁrst introduced the idea that there are two levels at which we can
describe sounds. The broad level is that at which only meaningful units of
sounds (i.e. phonemes) are recognised. However, phonemes actually occur in a
number of different forms, depending on their environment. These different
forms are called allophones, which are largely governed by coarticulation, and
form the allophonic level. Because they are so dependent on their environment,
usually only one allophone of a particular phoneme can occur in any particular
environment, and this allophone can differ in many ways from other allophones
of the same phoneme (remember the allophone of /k/ that we looked at in the
word ‘course’ in Exercise 10.9). We say that allophones of a phoneme are in
complementary distribution – that is, where one occurs, another cannot (the
allophone of /k/ in ‘course’ [ḵwh], for example, is the only one that can occur in
this environment).
What we have seen just now, however, is that, in some rare environments,
different allophones of the same phoneme are possible. So, before a pause, a /p/,
for example, might be pronounced as either [p̚ ] or [p’]. This situation, where
alternative allophones of a phoneme are possible, is called free allophonic
variation (FAV).
Exercise 11.18 From what you know so far, and from what we have said above, can you think
what might determine whether [p̚] or [p’] is used before a pause?
Comment In these very restricted circumstances, the speaker has some degree of choice
over which allophone to use. In Exercise 7.8, where we talked about ejectives, we
tried to produce them by saying the word ‘quick’ loudly and forcefully (page
89). This tends to be one type of situation in which ejective allophones occur,
whereas the inaudibly released ones might be said when the speaker does not
feel a particular desire to be overly clear or directive. In fact, before a pause,
voiceless plosives with wide oral release can also occur, so the speaker actually
has a choice of three allophones in this situation. Of course, the choice will not
be a conscious one, and speakers do not wake up in the morning and think,
‘Today, I am going to use only ejective plosives before pauses’. However, some
speakers may have an unconscious preference for one allophone or another, and
the unconscious choice at any one time might be determined by speaking style,
background noise, or the proximity or identity of the listener. For example, I
tend to use many more plosives with wide oral release and ejective release when
I am talking to my grandmother, who is hard of hearing.
It may seem, initially, that these situations of free allophonic variation
invalidate the notion of complementary distribution, which we said earlier
UNIT 11 Allophonic variations of manner
153

demonstrates that particular allophones ‘belong’ to the same phoneme.
However, it is important to remember that there are only a small number of
allophones that can be in free variation with each other. So, as we have just seen,
there are three allophones of voiceless plosives that can occur before a pause, but
also a vast number of others that cannot occur in this environment. For
example, a nasally released plosive or a narrowly released plosive cannot occur,
as they are not in the right environment (before a homorganic nasal or fricative,
respectively). Consequently, the three allophones that can occur are still in
complementary distribution with all the other allophones of that phoneme,
which cannot occur in this environment. Figure 11.7 illustrates this point.
The three allophones of /t/, on the left, are in free allophonic variation before
a pause, as the speaker has a choice of which to use. However, these three are in
complementary distribution with all the other allophones of /t/ which cannot
occur here, as shown on the right.
11.5.1 Unreleased plosives
Exercise 11.19 Produce the words ‘bad’ and ‘day’ separately, saying them quite carefully.
Concentrate on the /d/s and see if you can feel the approach, hold and release
phases for each. Now put the words together so that you produce the phrase
‘bad day’, and try to produce it fairly quickly and naturally. Again, concentrate
on the /d/s. What do you notice? Can you still feel the approach, hold and
release phases of each one?
Comment When you say the words separately, both /d/s have an approach, hold and
release phase, although the release phase for the /d/ in ‘bad’ may be inaudible
when the word is produced in isolation, as we have seen above, because it
occurs before a pause. When the two /d/s are adjacent in the phrase ‘bad day’,
however, it is possible that they merge together, with a single approach and
release, and one long hold phase. We say that the ﬁrst /d/ is unreleased, and
transcribe it as [d̊ ]. Note that the diacritic is a circle and looks rather similar
to the devoicing diacritic. However, it is to the right of the plosive, rather than
above or below it, as for other diacritics specifying different types of release.
Figures 11.8 and 11.9 illustrate the differences in /d/ between separate
production of the words ‘bad’ and ‘day’, and a rapid production of the phrase
‘bad day’.

When this happens, gemination is said to have occurred. Notice that it is
not the case that one of the /d/s has been deleted (try saying the phrase with just
one /d/ and see how odd it sounds). Instead, they have merged, to have a longer
hold phase than a single /d/, and only a single approach and release phase. Note
that the ﬁrst /d/ is entirely unreleased, and that this is rather different to a
plosive with inaudible release, where the release does occur, but cannot be
heard.
In any sequence of homorganic plosives, the ﬁrst plosive can be unreleased.
This includes voiceless plosives (for example, a sequence of /k k/) and where the
two homorganic plosives differ in voicing (for example, a sequence of /k ɡ/).
However, once again, we have a case of free allophonic variation. When two
homorganic plosives occur, the ﬁrst might be unreleased, as in the example
above, or it can have wide oral release, in which case, gemination does not occur,
and each plosive has an approach, hold and release phase. Again, this depends
on the speaker’s, largely unconscious, choice.
Exercise 11.20 Try to produce ‘bad day’ in two ways: ﬁrstly, with an unreleased ﬁrst plosive;
and, secondly, with the plosive in ‘bad’ produced with wide oral release. Do they
both sound normal and natural?
Comment As the unreleased and wide orally released plosives are in free allophonic
variation in this position, they should both sound ﬁne. The released version may
sound a little more careful, but both are acceptable. However, when we visit
assimilation in Unit 17, we will come across a situation where the unreleased
version is the only option.

11.6 Summary
Here we have looked at variations in manner of articulation. We have looked at
nasalisation of approximants, and several different variations in the approach

in an allophonic transcription, and how to show the position of the velum using
parametric diagrams. We have now covered all the major allophonic variations
of consonants in English.

need to include words that only contain nasals, vowels and approximants.
Some words to get you started are ‘men’, ‘milliner’ and ‘lemon’. This is
especially hard, as few function words (such as pronouns, articles and
conjunctions) ﬁt our criteria, and pluralising most nouns will not be

UNIT 12 ALLOPHONIC VARIATIONS OF VOWELS
12.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
explore how vowels can vary according to their environment
*
see how these variations are related to those found for approximants.
12.2 Introduction
We have spent the last few units describing the way consonants vary
according to their environment. We now turn our attention to two major
allophonic variations of vowels. In fact, we have already considered one of
these in Unit 11.
12.3 Brief revision from the previous unit
Exercise 12.1 Think back to the previous unit about allophonic variations in the manner
of consonants. Can you remember what type of variation we said also applies
to vowels?
Comment In the last unit, we saw that approximants can be nasalised when they are in the
vicinity of a nasal consonant. We also said that vowels can be nasalised in a
similar environment.
Exercise 12.2 Remind yourself about the facts of nasalisation from the previous unit.
a)
What does it mean for a sound to be nasalised?
b)
What is the role of the velum in nasalisation?
c)
In what environment are sounds nasalised in English?
d)
How is nasalisation shown on a parametric diagram?
Comment a)
You will remember from the last unit that nasalised sounds have both oral
and nasal airﬂow.
b)
This is because the velum is lowered for nasalised sounds, so that air can
ﬂow into the nasal cavity; and, as there is not a total blockage in the oral
cavity, there is oral airﬂow too.
158

c)
In English, nasalisation happens in the vicinity of a nasal consonant and is
due to coarticulation: the velum lowers in preparation for a nasal conso-
nant, or stays lowered following a nasal consonant.
d)
Nasalisation, therefore, appears as a sloping (or lowered) line representing
the velum in a parametric diagram.
Note that all of the above facts also apply to nasalised vowels.
Exercise 12.3 Given what you know about nasalisation of approximants, which vowels do you
think will be nasalised when the following words are pronounced in isolation?
Give allophonic transcriptions of each one.
among
helm
help
man
written
modern
Comment The transcriptions are as follows: [̃əˈm̃ɒ˛], [h̃ɛ̃lm], [hɛlp] [m̃æn], [ˈɹɪt̃ən] or
[ˈɹɪtnn] and [ˈm̃ɒd̃ən] or [ˈm̃ɒdnn] (where speakers may vary in whether or not
they use a syllable nasal).
The vowels that are adjacent to nasal consonants will be nasalised. So,
both the vowels in ‘among’, the vowel in ‘man’, the /ɒ/ in ‘modern’ and the
schwas in ‘written’ and ‘modern’ (if the words are produced with schwas) will
be nasalised. In Unit 11, we also learnt that nasalisation can extend for two
segments ahead of a nasal, since the anticipatory effect is stronger than the
perseverative effect. Thus the /ɛ/ in ‘helm’ will also be nasalised, as the process
affects both the /l/ and the vowel. The /ɛ/ in ‘help’, of course, will not be
nasalised, as there is no nasal in the vicinity.
Exercise 12.4 Draw parametric diagrams of ‘help’ and ‘helm’, showing velum height. What
do you think happens to the velum before and after these words when they are
spoken in isolation?
Comment As you would expect, the velum lowers during /ɛ/ and /l/ in ‘helm’, in prepa-
ration for the nasal consonant. This does not happen in ‘help’, however, as it
does not contain any nasals. Before and after the words, however, the velum is in
a lowered position for normal breathing. This is because we normally breathe
through our noses; therefore, the velum is low so that the nasal cavity is open
and air can travel between the nose and the lungs.
Exercise 12.5 What will a parametric diagram of ‘man’ look like when this word is spoken in
isolation? What will happen to the position of the velum before and after this
word?
Comment As the ﬁrst consonant is a nasal, the velum does not raise from its resting
position for normal breathing. Likewise, at the end of the word, the velum is
already lowered, so does not need to move in order to be in a position for
normal breathing. As the /æ/ is surrounded by nasal consonants, the velum is in
a lowered position, rather that moving during the vowel as it does when a nasal
159
UNIT 12 Allophonic variations of vowels

only appears on one side. Consequently, when this word is produced in
isolation, the velum is low throughout.
As with all our diagrams, we should remember that these are only approx-
imations of the actions of the articulators. The exact movements can be affected
by a speaker’s accent, how carefully or quickly he or she is speaking, the degree
of stress put on a word, and a variety of other factors. What is most important,
however, is that we remember that speech is a continuous process, with sounds
affecting one another, rather than each phoneme being produced independ-
ently and identically, regardless of context.
12.4 Pre-fortis clipping
Exercise 12.6 a)
Give broad transcriptions of the words ‘meat’ and ‘mead’. Would you
agree that the vowel is the same in each case?
b)
Now say these words slowly, out loud, and listen to the vowel in each case.
Does the length of the vowel appear to be the same?

SECTION TWO Putting sounds together

Comment a)
A broad transcription of these words would be /mit/ and /mid/. Therefore,
you probably said that the vowels in these words are the same, at least from
a phonemic perspective.
b)
You will probably have noticed that there seems to be some difference in
vowel duration between these words. In particular, the vowel appears to be
shorter in ‘meat’, and somewhat longer in ‘mead’. This is a phenomenon
that we call pre-fortis clipping.
Exercise 12.7 Using your knowledge of the English language, and thinking about Exercise
12.6, what do you think the term ‘pre-fortis clipping’ means? ‘Pre-’ and
‘clipping’ are probably quite easy to work out, but what about ‘fortis’?
Comment Pre-fortis clipping means that sounds are shorter (clipped) when they come
before (pre-) a voiceless (fortis) consonant in the same syllable.
There are a couple of points we need to clarify, however, about pre-fortis
clipping. First of all, the term ‘fortis’ is new to us in this book. This term could
be loosely equated with ‘voiceless’, as we have suggested, but then why do we
need another term? Why not just say pre-voiceless clipping? Fortis, in fact,
means ‘strong’ in Latin, and can be contrasted with the term lenis, meaning
‘weak’. One aspect of this strong–weak distinction is to do with voicing, but
there are also other differences between fortis and lenis sounds. For example,
the fortis consonants are often aspirated in languages, as is the case for English.
Fortis consonants are also longer than lenis ones, and have a shortening effect
on preceding sounds, as we have just seen when we compared ‘meat’ and
‘mead’.
One way in which these terms are particularly useful is as alternative terms
for ‘voiced’ and ‘voiceless’. As you will remember (from Unit 9 on allophonic
variation in voicing), those obstruent consonants that we categorised as being
voiced in Unit 2 are often produced without vocal fold vibration – for example,
when they are next to silence or a voiceless consonant. So, the term ‘lenis’ can be
used for these sounds instead of ‘voiced’. This avoids the problem of saying that
‘voiced’ consonants are produced without voicing, which can seem rather odd
and contradictory. We will not use the terms ‘fortis’ and lenis’ very much in
later units, but it is useful for you to know what the terms mean, in case you
come across them in your further reading. What is important here is to
remember that fortis consonants (for example, [s]) trigger pre-fortis clipping,
while lenis consonants do not, even if they are devoiced (for example, [ ̊z]).
Exercise 12.8 We have said that vowels are shortened when they occur before a voiceless
(fortis) consonant in the same syllable, and this shortening is also found for any
sonorant consonants. Which sounds are clipped if the words below are said in
isolation?
tattoo
candid
said
saint
atlas
161
UNIT 12 Allophonic variations of vowels

Comment The /æ/ in ‘atlas’ is clipped because the voiceless /t/ falls in the same syllable,
due to the maximal onset principle. Similarly, in ‘saint’ /eɪ/ and /n/ are
shortened, as they fall in the same syllable as /t/. ‘Candid’ and ‘said’ have no
clipped sounds as they do not contain voiceless sounds. None of the sounds in
‘tattoo’ are clipped because both the /t/s form onsets rather than codas, and
therefore the vowels are not followed by voiceless sounds within the same
syllable.
The diacritic for pre-fortis clipping is [̆ ], placed above the symbol for the
clipped sound. You can ﬁnd it on your IPA chart (page 281) under
‘Suprasegmentals’ as ‘extra short’. You could show clipping in a parametric
diagram by reducing the width of the column for the clipped sounds, but, in
practice, this tends not to be done and the diacritic is enough to indicate which
allophones are present.
12.5 Additional diacritics for vowels
Looking at the ‘Diacritics’ section of your IPA chart (page 000), you will notice
that there are a number of other diacritics that can help us to describe vowels in
detail. These can be added to cardinal vowel symbols, to provide a more precise
indication of the quality of the vowel in question. For example, in Unit 6 we said
that the English vowel in ‘bed’ is between cardinals 2 and 3, and we chose to use
one of those symbols, /ɛ/, in transcription. A more detailed, narrower, tran-
scription, however, could also add diacritics to indicate the relationship of this
vowel to cardinal 3. For example, we can use a diacritic [˔] to say that the
tongue is more raised than it is for the cardinal vowel.
We can also use diacritics to show allophonic variations of vowels. For
example, we can indicate that /u/ is produced with the tongue in a more central
position before /j/, and could be narrowly transcribed as [ü]. We will not focus
any more on allophonic variation of vowels here, but will revisit vowel variation
when we think more about accent variation in a later unit.
12.6 Diacritics on the IPA chart
Most of the diacritics we have looked at in the last four units are shown in a
special section of the IPA chart, which is shown here in Figure 12.3, and on the
full chart in Appendix 1 (page 281). A few of the symbols we have used (such as
those for labiodental and unaspirated) are not shown here, but come from a
related alphabet, known as the extIPA, which provides symbols primarily for
transcribing disordered speech. It would be worth highlighting those diacritics
that you know on the diacritics section of the main IPA chart, or below, and
checking with a good phonetics dictionary, or a teacher, if you would like to
know more about those we have not covered.

UNIT 13 ALLOPHONIC TRANSCRIPTION
AND PARAMETRIC DIAGRAMS
13.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
revise the difference between broad and allophonic levels of transcription
*
practise allophonic transcription
*
practise drawing parametric diagrams.
13.2 Introduction
In previous units, we have looked in great detail at allophonic variations of
voice, place and manner for consonants, and nasalisation and pre-fortis
clipping for vowels. In this unit, we will consolidate our understanding of
the different levels of transcription, practise allophonic transcription, and
learn to draw parametric diagrams.
13.3 Revision about transcription
Exercise 13.1 Without looking back at the previous units, try to deﬁne these terms.
phoneme; allophone; coarticulation; broad transcription; allophonic transcription
Comment Phonemes are the abstract segments of speech that exist only in our minds.
They are the meaningful units of speech, and swapping one for another can
make a meaning difference (as we see in minimal pairs). In reality, phonemes
are produced in a variety of different forms, and these forms are called
allophones. The allophone used at any particular time will depend on the
environment, and is due largely to coarticulation. Segments are not produced in
isolation, and the production of one affects, and is affected by, the production of
those around it. Broad transcription, as we ﬁrst saw in Unit 9, is a type of
transcription in which we ignore allophonic detail and only show the
phonemes that are present. Allophonic transcription is a more detailed, or
narrower, type of transcription, which shows the allophone of a particular
phoneme that occurs.
165

Exercise 13.2 Try to list all the allophonic variations we have considered in the last few units.
It may help to consider consonant allophones separately in relation to voice, place
and manner, and then move onto allophones relating to vowels.
Once you have made your list, try to add the appropriate diacritics.

13.4 Key differences between allophonic and broad transcription
Exercise 13.3 Look at these two transcriptions of the phrase ‘tin of red paint’.
What similarities and differences do you notice?
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
166

/ˈtɪn ɒv rɛd ˈpeɪnt/
[ˈthɪ̃n ɒ̃v ɹɛd ̚ ˈphẽɪ̆n̆nt ̚ ]
Comment There are many similarities between these two levels of transcription. After all,
they represent the same speech; it is just that the second shows more detail than
the ﬁrst. The allophonic transcription, of course, has a number of diacritics to
indicate which allophones of each phoneme occur, so in this way more detail is
given. For example, /t/ is only transcribed as /t/ in the broad version, but the
precise allophone, be it [th] or [nt ̚], is given in the allophonic version. Note that
both transcriptions mark stressed syllables, so ensure that you do not think of
stress as characteristic of allophonic transcription alone.
/r/ is transcribed as [ɹ] in the allophonic transcription. As we have seen
already, ‘r’ on the IPA chart corresponds to a trill. While it is acceptable, and
traditional, to use this ‘r’ symbol to represent an approximant in a broad
transcription, a narrower transcription requires us to use the [ɹ] symbol for a
postalveolar approximant.
In addition, notice that the two types of transcription are enclosed in
different sorts of brackets: slash for broad transcription and square for allo-
phonic transcription.
Exercise 13.4 Give an allophonic transcription of the following sentence. Your focus
should be on the various allophones of /t/ that occur. Stress is already marked
for you.
ˈSteve is ˈtrying to ˈﬁt the ˈtop onto that ˈbottle.
Comment [ˈst=iv ɪz ˈṯɹ̊aɪ̃ɪ̃˛ tu ˈf ɪ̆t̪ð ðə ˈthɒ̆p ɒ̃n ntu ð̆æt̚ ˈ̊bɒ̆tˠˈlˠ]
Exercise 13.5 Look at the comment on Exercise 13.4. The /t/ in ‘to’ does not have any
diacritics associated with it. What does this mean?
Comment One way to think about allophones with no associated diacritics is that the
allophone is very close to the description attributed by default to the phoneme.
In this example, it is voiceless and does not have any major voicing effect on the
following vowel or approximant, such as strong aspiration or devoicing. Its
place of articulation is alveolar and its manner is plosive with wide oral release.
It is important to realise that the [t] in ‘to’ is an allophone, just as much as any of
the other /t/s that are transcribed with additional diacritics. Being diacritic-free
does not mean that it is phoneme /t/, or a ‘normal’ or ‘unchanged’ /t/, just that
its articulation is similar to that implied by the VPM label for /t/.
Exercise 13.6 Practise your allophonic transcription with the following sentence, which
focusses on /p/. Once again, stress has been marked for you.
ˈPete’s comˈputer was reˈpaired in ˈSpain by Philip ˈPiper

UNIT 13 Allophonic transcription and parametric diagrams
167

Exercise 13.7 Do you think you need to be able to hear a sentence spoken in order to make an
allophonic transcription of it?
Comment When listening to a spoken version of a sentence, it becomes possible to
hear allophonic detail with practice. However, this is one of the most difﬁcult
tasks in phonetics, as you must work against your instinct, which is to hear all
allophones of a phoneme as ‘the same’. If you are transcribing SSBE, however,
you can make an allophonic transcription without hearing a speaker’s
pronunciation. This is because the allophones to be applied are those set out in
the earlier units of the book. As all the allophones are context-dependent and
governed by rules, you can easily complete the transcription just by knowing
those rules. You would not, however, be able to include any aspects of the
pronunciation that are unusual or particular to that speaker, or determine
which realisation has been used when there is a choice available (in free
allophonic variation). Other accents also have some differences in allophonic
realisation.
There will more opportunities for you to practise allophonic transcription in
the exercises at the end of this unit, but for now we will move on to think further
about parametric diagrams.
13.5 Parametric diagrams
In the last few units, we have looked at parametric diagrams that show details of
the articulation of particular stretches of speech.
The following section acts as a tutorial for drawing parametric diagrams of
voicing and velum movement. We will start with the example of the word
‘temperatures’, spoken in isolation in a non-rhotic accent, and with three
(rather than four) syllables.
1.
First, make a broad transcription of the word or phrase for which you will
draw the diagram.
/ˈtɛmprətʃəz/
2.
Now make an allophonic transcription of the same utterance. Remember to
turn any /r/s upside down, change the brackets and add diacritics. Stress
marks should be retained and these will help you to decide where aspiration
and approximant devoicing occur.
[ˈthɛ̃mnpɹətʃəz̊]
3.
Assign one slot to each of the segments in your transcription, retaining the
diacritics. Remember that the lines represent notional beginnings and ends
of each segment. Also remember to allow space so you can show what
happens before and after the word. (See Figure 13.1.)
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
168

4.
Now begin to draw the voicing line. Sounds that you categorised as voiced
in Unit 2 will have a wiggly line to indicate voicing. Those that you
categorised as voiceless will have a straight line. However, you also need to
consider the allophonic level of representation. Aspiration will result in a
delayed voice onset for the following vowel, and devoicing will mean that
sounds are only voiced for part of their duration, as indicated in Unit 9. You
should also show that the vocal folds are not vibrating before or after the
utterance, by drawing a straight line. (See Figure 13.2.)
5.
Now start to work on the velum line. Begin by drawing a high line for all the
obstruents, to represent a closed velum. (See Figure 13.3.)
6.
Then draw a low line for any nasals, to represent a lowered velum.
Remember, if the nasal occurs next to an obstruent, leave enough space for
the velum to be raised or lowered during the nasal itself. (See Figure 13.4.)

7.
At this point, approximants and vowels do not have the position of the
velum represented. As we know, the velum may be raised or lowered for
these sounds, depending on the surrounding sounds. We can work out the
position of the velum by simply joining up the lines that we already have in
place. Then any nasalised sounds will have a sloping velum line (or a low
line if a nasal consonant appears on both sides). (See Figure 13.5.)
8.
We then need to show the position of the velum before and after our word.
Remember that when we are not speaking, the velum is usually low for
normal breathing. If the word starts or ends with a low velum, you simply
need to extend this low line past the boundaries of that segment. If,
however, the ﬁrst or ﬁnal segment has a high line, you need to show it gently
sloping to or from a lowered position, as shown in Figure 13.6.

9.
In the ﬁnal step, it is a good idea to check for mistakes. First, check that you
show voicelessness and velum movement both before and after the word.
Check that the voicing line corresponds to the symbols and diacritics in
your transcription, and that you have included aspiration and devoicing, as
appropriate. Finally, check that the velum is raised for obstruents, lowered
for nasals, and is only moving (shown by a sloping line) during nasalised
vowels and approximants, and more steeply during nasals themselves when
next to obstruents.
Exercise 13.8 Draw parametric diagrams of voicing and velum movement for the following
words.

Comment We have now covered all the major points about allophonic transcription
and parametric diagrams. Such diagrams can also be used to show other
parameters, like the closure of the lips or tongue. Importantly, they help us to
get a feel for speech as a continuous process, where individual segments are
inﬂuenced by the environment in which they appear.

13.6 Summary
Here we have consolidated our knowledge so far by practising allophonic
transcriptions of single words. We have also learnt how to show allophonic
detail of voicing and velum height by drawing parametric diagrams.
13.7 Looking forward
So far, we have noted that variation occurs in speech, but have mainly focussed
on neutral pronunciations in an SSBE accent. In the next unit, we will look more
thoroughly at the types of variation that arise in speech.

UNIT 14 SPEECH SOUND VARIATION
14.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
explore how sounds vary between and within speakers
*
investigate why sounds vary in these ways
*
explore why some sounds change over time.
14.2 Introduction
In this unit, we will think about how and why the way people speak might
vary and change. We will think about why speakers might sound different to
one another, and about if, how and why sounds might change over time. We
will begin by thinking about what we can tell about a person just from their
speech.
14.3 Types of variation
Exercise 14.1 Imagine that you are sitting on a bus, listening to the conversation of the people
behind you. What can you tell about the people you are listening to, just from
their speech?
Comment You can tell a lot about a person just from their speech, because speech can
vary considerably from person to person, and even within a single individual,
and particular aspects of a person’s speech might be associated with
particular characteristics. For example, you might have noted that you would
have an idea about the following characteristics: sex/gender, age, where they
come from, their social class and their emotional state (for example, whether
they are happy or sad). We will take each of these in turn, and think brieﬂy
about how and why they are apparent in a person’s speech. We will think
ﬁrst about aspects that are relatively constant for a single speaker, but vary
between speakers.
174

14.4 Variation between speakers
14.4.1 Sex/gender
Exercise 14.2 Think again about our hypothetical bus situation in Exercise 14.1. Which
factors in a person’s speech will tell you about whether they are a man or
woman?
Comment One of the most striking and reliable ways in which we judge a person’s sex
from their voice is pitch. As we have seen in Unit 2, the vocal folds vibrate
during voiced sounds. It is the speed of these vibrations that gives rise to the
pitch we hear, with quicker vibrations sounding higher in pitch than slower
vibrations. In turn, the speed of the vibrations is determined by the size, mass
and length of the vocal folds. Larger vocal folds produce slower vibrations,
which listeners hear as a lower pitch, just as the thicker strings on a guitar
produce lower-pitched notes. As a larger person will have larger vocal folds,
they will vibrate at a lower frequency and their voices will sound lower in pitch.
Since males tend to be larger than females in humans and other animal species,
males tend to produce lower sounds, and therefore we can often tell a person’s
sex from the pitch of their voice. To summarise, men tend to have larger
vocal folds, large vocal folds vibrate more slowly, and slower vibrations sound
lower in pitch. Therefore, if we hear a low-pitched voice, we often assume the
speaker is male.
Exercise 14.3 Do you think that differences in pitch are the only difference between the speech
of males and females?
Comment In fact, a difference in the pitch of the voice seems to be only one of a whole host
of differences between male and female speech. For example, pitch range (the
difference between the highest and the lowest pitch) is often wider for women,
and their voices may be more breathy, with more air escaping between each
closure of the vocal folds. Many linguists have also investigated aspects of
language (beyond speech) which differ between the sexes. For example, some
authors have suggested that women may apologise more, ask more questions
and interrupt less, although it is unclear how much these generalisations really
hold. In terms of phonetics, research into languages spoken in western cultures
has sometimes suggested that females use more hypercorrect forms. Some
evidence from English, for example, suggests that women make bigger differ-
ences between short vowels like /ɪ/ and long vowels like /i/ than men do. Also,
some studies have suggested that women can be more likely to use prestigious
/ɪ˛/ than regional variant /ɪn/ as the progressive form in words like ‘running’.
Thus, voice pitch is only one of a number of differences between the speech of
men and women.
UNIT 14 Speech sound variation
175

14.4.2 Age
Exercise 14.4 Think about a speaker who is much older than you, whom you speak to
regularly. This could be one of your grandparents, for example. (If this is not
possible, then think about a much younger speaker.) What are the main
differences between this person’s speech and yours? Remember to try to
focus on phonetic aspects here, rather than particular words or phrases that
they use.
Comment Some of the differences you identiﬁed between your own speech and that of
elderly speakers most likely relate, again, to pitch of voice. Some evidence shows
that the pitch of the voice decreases with advancing age in adults, due to
thickening of the vocal folds, and possibly also to hormonal changes. In
addition, there may be differences in voice quality (the way in which the vocal
folds vibrate, to produce breathy or creaky voice, for example), the speed of
speech, and loudness between older and younger adults. Very young children
have high-pitched voices, because of the relatively small size of the larynx and
vocal folds. It seems that humans are quite good at estimating a person’s age
from their speech.
Exercise 14.5 Are there any words that you pronounce differently to your grandparents?
Think about the words below. It would be really useful if you could ask an older
speaker to produce these words for you, then transcribe their productions and
compare them to your own.
ate
dissect
scallop
princess
zebra
tune
Comment All these words have been identiﬁed as potentially differing between speakers of
different ages. The results for these words, and many more, can be found in the
Longman Pronunciation Dictionary, for which a number of pronunciation
surveys were carried out in order to establish the differing pronunciations.
I provide a short overview of the results here.
‘ate’ is likely to be pronounced as /ɛt/ by older speakers and /eɪt/ by younger
speakers.
‘dissect’ is likely to be pronounced variably as /dɪˈsɛkt/ or /dɑɪˈsɛkt/ by older
speakers, and more consistently as /dɑɪˈsɛkt/ by younger speakers.
‘scallop’ is likely to be pronounced /ˈskɒləp/ by older speakers and /ˈskæləp/ by
younger speakers.
‘princess’ is likely to be produced /prɪnˈsɛs/ by older speakers, whereas younger
speakers are split more or less evenly between those saying /ˈprɪnsɛs/ and
/prɪnˈsɛs/.
‘zebra’ is likely to be produced either as /ˈzibrə/ or /ˈzɛbrə/ by older speakers,
and more consistently as /ˈzɛbrə/ by younger speakers.
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
176

‘tune’ is likely to be pronounced as /tjun/ by older speakers of British English,
and /tʃun/ by younger speakers. Some young speakers may say /tun/ for this
word, as do speakers of some regional accents, such as American English, for
whom this is by far the more common pronunciation.
Exercise 14.6 Why do you think speakers of different ages pronounce some words differently
to each other?
Comment As we will see later on, speech and language change over time; therefore,
speakers of different ages have learnt different pronunciations. We will consider
the reasons why this happens towards the end of this unit.
14.4.3 Regional variation
Exercise 14.7 What are some of the differences in regional accent that we have identiﬁed
earlier in this book? Are there any others that you are aware of that we have not
mentioned?
Comment Throughout this book, we have talked about several types of
differences between accents. We have talked about rhoticity, for
example, and the presence vs absence of the /ʌ/ vowel. Depending on your
accent, or the accents you are familiar with, you might have thought of
some more differences. Many books identify a number of features that
distinguish British regional accents, and we will now explore some of the
most common.
Exercise 14.8 For each question below, think about which features are found in your own
pronunciation.
1.
Do you have the /ʌ/ vowel in words like ‘cup’, or do you use /ʊ/?
2.
Are ‘witch’ and ‘which’ pronounced the same for you, or does the ﬁrst
sound differ?
3.
Do you have the /æ/ vowel in words like ‘dance’ and ‘path’?
4.
Do you pronounce the vowel in ‘north’ and ‘force’ the same?
5.
Do you use an /r/ on the end of the word ‘car’ when it is spoken in
isolation?
6.
Do you use /i/ or /ɪ/ at the end of words like ‘city’ and ‘happy’?
7.
Do you produce the sound in the middle of words like ‘little’ as [ʔ]?
8.
How much aspiration do you have after voiceless plosives in stressed
syllables, such as after /t/ in ‘time’?
Comment Obviously the answers you have given will depend on your own regional accent,
so here I comment on what different answers reveal about differences between
regional accents.
UNIT 14 Speech sound variation
177

1 and 2 are types of difference known as systemic variation. This means that
one variety has more or fewer phonemes than another. In 1, Northern and
(some) Midland accents lack /ʌ/ altogether, and use /ʊ/ where SSBE would use
/ʌ/, as in ‘cup’. In 2, Scottish and Irish varieties (and some American varieties)
would pronounce ‘witch’ with /w/ and ‘which’ with /ʍ/, whereas most other
varieties of English use /w/ for both.
3 and 4 are types of lexical variation. This is where the sound used for a
particular set of words varies between accents. In 3, Northern and Midland
varieties use the same vowel in ‘dance’ and ‘bath’ as they do in ‘trap’.
Southern varieties use the vowel that they use in ‘palm’ for these words. In 4,
most varieties of English use the vowel in ‘thought’ for both ‘north’ and ‘force’.
In many types of Scottish English, however, words like ‘north’ are pronounced
with the same vowel as in ‘lot’ and ‘thought’, while words like ‘force’ are
pronounced with the vowel in ‘goat’.
5 and 6 are examples of distributional variation. Here, two varieties have
the same phonemes in the system, but use them in different environments. 5
involves rhoticity, which we have revisited many times already. Notably, all
accents of English can have /r/ before vowels. Some, however, such as most
American accents, Scottish, Irish and West County accents (and some small
parts of Lancashire), can also have an /r/ after a vowel, such as in the word ‘car’.
Likewise, in 6, all accents have /i/ and /ɪ/, but they differ as to which is used at the
end of words like ‘happy’. Northern English, Scottish and Irish accents tend to
use /ɪ/, while most others, including American and Australian, tend to use /i/.
7 and 8 are examples of realisational differences. Here, the same phonemes
are used in the same environments, but the precise way in which these pho-
nemes are produced and sound varies. Thus, London and Newcastle varieties
are likely to have /t/ realised as a glottal stop [ʔ] rather than [t], in the middle of
words like ‘little’. In addition, the degree of aspiration varies across accents,
with Lancashire, Scottish and South African accents having a noticeably shorter
voice onset time than other accents of English for voiceless plosives in the same
context.
Exercise 14.9 Why do you think people have different regional accents? Where do accents
come from, and how are they maintained?
Comment Regional accents have come about due to a number of different factors. England
has been subject to many invasions, after which speakers of different languages
have settled in different parts of the country, and these languages have affected
English accordingly. As we will see shortly, we are all inﬂuenced by the speech
we hear around us, and decide, consciously or unconsciously, whether we want
to ﬁt in with those speakers we hear. Thus, within communities, people tend to
speak in a similar manner to their peers.
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
178

Exercise 14.10 Are there some regional accents that you feel strongly about? Are there some
you love, or hate, or ﬁnd funny?
Comment It is likely that you hold some opinions about regional accents. However, if
you ask your friends the same question, it is perfectly possible that they hold
differing opinions, such as loving those accents that you hate, and vice versa.
There do not seem to be any particular phonetic characteristics that make an
accent likeable or not. However, the media often perpetuates particular
stereotypes about accents, suggesting that speakers with a certain accent
lack intelligence, are untrustworthy or are more likely to be criminals, for
example. So, while it is natural for us to hold some opinions about accents,
we should remember that these opinions are usually not based on fact, and,
as experts in speech, these may be the sorts of judgements we want to
challenge.
14.4.4 Social class
Think back to our exercise at the very start of the unit, where we tried to
imagine what we can tell about a speaker solely from their voice. There we
commented that social class was something that you might identify in such a
situation.
Exercise 14.11 Do you ever think someone is ‘posh’ or ‘common’ because of the way they
speak? What aspects of their speech make you think that way? Is it related to
where they live or where they grew up?
Comment Most of us have an idea about what sounds ‘posh’ and what sounds ‘common’.
These ideas might be based on the words that someone uses, or on phonetic
features, such as whether someone drops their /h/s or uses glottal stops in the
middle of words.
We saw above that a person’s speech is inﬂuenced by their regional accent.
However, there are also differences in accent which arise due to people’s social
class, rather than the geographical area they come from. So, for example, the RP
(Received Pronunciation) accent is thought to be spoken by around 3 per cent
of the population of England. Importantly, those 3 per cent do not come from a
particular region of the country, but rather share a particular social class (upper
class). As with regional accents, however, people are often strongly inﬂuenced
by the speech they hear around them, and may gravitate towards accent features
from another social class if that is what they hear in the environment. For
example, people with a non-RP accent may ﬁnd themselves adopting some
aspects of RP if they move to an environment (such as a school or workplace)
where this accent is the norm.
UNIT 14 Speech sound variation
179

14.4.5 Multiple sources of variation
Exercise 14.12 Do you think it is always possible to decide why a particular characteristic of
someone’s speech occurs? For example, is it always possible to say that a certain
pronunciation is due to age or regional accent?
Comment As we have seen, there are multiple factors that may determine the way in which
a particular word or sound is pronounced. A potential problem is that many of
these factors affect the same sound or set of sounds. For example, pronouncing
‘news’ as /nuz/ might be more likely if the speaker is American, or if the speaker
is female, or if the speaker is young. Thus, in some cases, multiple factors could
be responsible for a particular pronunciation.
Some sources of variation are fairly well understood in terms of how they are
related. For example, the relationship between social and regional variation in
pronunciation is often represented as an equilateral triangle, as illustrated in
Figure 14.1. The diagram aims to show that at the very top of the social scale there
is very little regional difference in pronunciation, as almost everyone uses RP. At
the bottom of the social scale, in contrast, there is large regional variation.
However, the interaction between other sources of variation is more poorly
understood. A person’s pronunciation will not just be inﬂuenced by their
regional accent, but also by all the other factors that we have mentioned so far.
To complicate matters still further, there are also aspects of speech which differ
between individuals, but are not due to any of the factors we have addressed
above, as we will see now.
14.4.6 Idiolectal variation and free phonemic variation
Exercise 14.13 a)
Have you ever come across a pronunciation variant that is peculiar to just
one speaker (that is something that would pick that speaker out for you
anywhere, but which does not appear to be related to their age, class or
where they grew up)? This variant might affect a single sound, a single word
or a whole class of sounds or words.
b)
Have you ever had a disagreement with someone about how a word should
be pronounced? For example, you might have disagreed about how to say
the word ‘envelope’ or ‘either’.
Regional variation 
Social variation 
Figure 14.1 Interaction between regional and social variation in pronunciation
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
180

Comment a)
There are some types of variation between speakers that cannot be
attributed to any of the causes we have listed above. For example,
labiodental /r/ does not appear to be restricted to a particular age
group (although it is increasing among young speakers) or regional
accent. In addition, some speakers might produce some of their vowels
slightly higher or lower than most other speakers, or slightly nasalise
vowels, even when they are not in the vicinity of a nasal consonant.
These types of features are termed idiolectal. We can also ﬁnd idio-
lectal differences at other levels of language, such as vocabulary and
syntax. So, while our speech reveals things such as where we grew up,
our social class, our age and our sex, some of our speech patterns are
idiosyncrasies particular to us, and not attributable to any of these
other factors.
b)
People tend to be very interested in speech and pronunciation, even if
they are not studying phonetics, and they will quite often disagree
about the ‘correct’ pronunciation of a word. In fact, one of my early
memories is of my mother and aunt discussing how to say ‘garage’,
and whether or not /ˈgærɪdʒ/ was to be preferred over /gəˈrɑʒ/.
Indeed, there are some words where more than one pronunciation
can be heard from native speakers, even in isolated form. For exam-
ple, some SSBE speakers say /ɛnvələʊp/ and others say /ɒnvələʊp/,
while some say /aɪðə/, and some say /iðə/, and so forth (situations like
this, where there is a choice of phoneme in a word without affecting
meaning, are called free phonemic variation (FPV)). For these words,
the pronunciation an individual chooses does not depend entirely on
age, sex, class or regional accent, but is related to individual prefer-
ence. For example, although the ﬁrst pronunciation in each of these
examples is more common, there is still a large number of people who
use the alternative. As experts in speech, we would generally not want
to recommend any particular ‘correct’ pronunciation, but are inter-
ested instead in the possible variants and the factors inﬂuencing their
use.
14.5 Variation within an individual
The factors we have looked at above tend to stay entirely or fairly constant for
any individual over time. However, there are also factors affecting pronuncia-
tion that can change from moment to moment and lead to variation in the
productions of a single individual.
UNIT 14 Speech sound variation
181

14.5.1 Situational variation
Exercise 14.14 a)
Do you think that you speak the same way all the time, or are you affected
by the situation?
b)
If you listen to your partner, friends or parents on the phone, are you able
to tell who they are talking to just by the way they speak?
Comment These two related questions are designed to get you to think about how
pronunciation can vary within an individual. Most people are affected to some
degree by the situation in which they ﬁnd themselves. For example, if I am at
home speaking informally to my family, I am far more likely to use [ʔ] word-
medially than if I am giving a lecture or a conference presentation. The person
we are talking to may also make a difference. For example, when I speak to my
grandmother, who is hard of hearing, I speak more slowly and carefully. One of
the most important inﬂuences on a speaker’s choice is related to the formality of
the situation. So, talking to your lecturer or boss is unlikely to produce the same
type of pronunciations as talking to your best friend. The amount of change in
these situations is very much up to the individual, however. For some, the
difference between their most casual and most formal pronunciations is huge,
while for others it is very small.
14.5.2 Emotional variation
Exercise 14.15 In Exercise 14.14, you thought about how your speech might be affected by the
situation and the person you are talking to. Part of these differences might be
due to your mood or emotions in different situations. Can you think how a
person’s speech changes according to whether they are happy or sad, for
example?
Comment As humans, we are generally very good at recognising each other’s emotions,
even if we are talking on the phone and only have auditory cues to work with.
Studies have suggested that pitch might differ when people are happy, perhaps
being higher and with a greater pitch range than when they are sad. People may
also talk more quickly and loudly when they are interested and excited by what
they are saying. It does seem, however, that there may be differences between
languages in terms of which phonetic properties signal particular emotions, and
our understanding of how humans perceive mood from speech is still not
complete.
Exercise 14.16 Do you think that changes an individual makes to their pronunciation are
conscious or unconscious?
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
182

Comment It seems likely that both apply. Clearly, speakers are consciously altering their
pronunciations if they imitate other accents or speakers, for example. In
addition, we may make a conscious effort to alter our pronunciations if there is
some kind of difﬁculty in communication. For example, in the case of speaking
to my grandmother (mentioned above), I make a particular effort to be loud and
clear, as she is hard of hearing. Furthermore, if someone misunderstands us, we
may choose to pronounce a word in a different way for clarity.
In most cases however, it is likely that the changes to our pronunciation are
largely unconscious. We have different speech styles at our disposal, and fairly
unconsciously choose which to use in any given situation. Sometimes the
changes to our speech are so unconscious that we do not even realise we are
making them – as you will know if anyone has ever asked you why you were
talking ‘posh’ on the telephone when you were not even aware you were
speaking differently to normal.
14.6 Pronunciation change over time
Exercise 14.17 What evidence have we seen in this unit that pronunciation (at least of certain
words) changes over time?
Comment In the early part of this unit, we talked about some pronunciations being
related to age. This provides an indication that pronunciation changes over
time. Your grandparents learnt a particular pronunciation for those words
we investigated, like ‘ate’ and ‘scallop’, and retain that pronunciation
today, while the younger generation has learnt and uses a different
pronunciation.
Exercise 14.18 Obviously, to make the claim that pronunciation changes over time, we need to
know how words used to be pronounced. Can you think of any evidence for
how words were pronounced before your grandparents’ time? For example,
how do we know how words were pronounced in the fourteenth and sixteenth
centuries?
Comment If you have read Chaucer or Shakespeare, or heard their works performed in the
original pronunciation, you will know that English has changed hugely over
time. For example, English used to include sounds such as [x] and [ç], which
have now been lost, and vowel sounds were very different to those we hear
today. We can use this literature from the past as evidence for previous
pronunciations. Of course, recording technology did not exist until relatively
recently, so we do not have access to the spoken forms of words, but older
pronunciations can be reconstructed from the spellings used, the way words
rhymed, and by comparison with related languages.
UNIT 14 Speech sound variation
183

Exercise 14.19 Why and how do you think languages change?
For example, why might your grandparents say /ɛt/ when you say /eɪt/? And
why is the English of Chaucer and Shakespeare so different from that heard
today?
How did these changes come about?
Comment It is important to remember that, at any one time, there is a huge amount of
variation within the speech we hear around us. We have already seen, in our
discussion of age-related variation, that there is variation even within speakers
of a single age group. This variation, at any single point in time (called
synchronic variation), is often responsible for variation across time (which is
called diachronic variation). So, your grandparents may have been living in a
world where most of the time they heard /ɛt/, but some of the time they heard
/eɪt/. For whatever reason, a large portion of the younger generation adopted the
second pronunciation, and this process continued over the generations, until
the situation reversed, with most people saying /eɪt/. It is important to
remember that, at least for the changing pronunciations we have talked about, it
is not the case that 100 per cent of older people have one pronunciation and 100
per cent of younger people have a different pronunciation. There is always some
variation within a single speech community, and such variation can lead to
language change over time, much as in natural selection, where variations in the
gene pool inﬂuence the evolution of a species.
Exercise 14.20 a)
If there is variation in the production of a particular word at one point in
time, what factors do you think are likely to make one variant become more
popular than another?
b)
Do you think the media can affect which pronunciation of a word becomes
the more popular one?
Comment a)
Many different theories have been advanced to explain why certain
pronunciations gain a foothold and become the most popular. For
example, the choice may be related to ease of effort, with the easiest
pronunciations being favoured. In addition, factors such as spelling can
inﬂuence pronunciation in a literate society, as can analogy with other
words.
Social reasons for sound change are currently much discussed. It has
often been suggested that we take on the pronunciations of those people
whom we wish to emulate. These might be the most highly regarded and
successful in society, in which case it could be said that we imitate ‘prestige’
pronunciations. Alternatively, we might imitate forms with covert pres-
tige, such as those used by groups who are admired for other reasons, such
as coolness or toughness. Again, though, it is debatable how much of this
imitation is conscious and how much is unconscious.
SECTION TWO Putting sounds together
184

b)
It is also debatable how much our pronunciation is inﬂuenced by the
media, with some experts arguing that pronunciation will only change
when speakers can interact with other speakers who have different pro-
nunciations. Some experiments, however, show that we start to imitate
precise vowel qualities within a few minutes of hearing them, even if we
are only played them over a loud speaker, and have no interaction with the
speaker or assumptions about their prestige. This would suggest that we
imitate speakers quite quickly and automatically, without necessarily hav-
ing to interact with them, or worrying about whether we want to be like
them.
14.7 Summary
To recap, we have seen that people may speak differently to each other due to
sex, age, regional accent, social class or individual preference. In addition,
individual speakers may vary their pronunciation according to the situation or
their mood. We have learnt that variation exists within the language at any
one time and that particular pronunciations may then be adopted by a large
number of people, which can lead to change in pronunciation over time.
Speakers may adopt other pronunciations, either automatically or due to
the prestige of certain individuals. We have now covered a great deal of
ground regarding sounds in isolation and when they are grouped together
in words.
14.8 Looking forward
In the next section of the book, we will begin to consider longer stretches of
speech, and the things that can happen when words occur next to each other,
starting with the loss of sounds in connected speech.

2 The following extract is a conversation that takes place between three
characters in Wuthering Heights, reported by Nellie Dean, the nurse.
What aspects of variation in pronunciation is Emily Brontë trying to
capture here? In particular, compare the speech of Joseph and Catherine.
What do the differences in their speech tell you about their ages, sexes,
regional accents and social class? (Note that you can do this exercise
whether or not you know the story.)
‘She’s ill,’ said Hindley, taking her wrist; ‘I suppose that’s the reason she
would not go to bed. Damn it! I don’t want to be troubled with more sickness
here. What took you into the rain?’
‘Running after t’ lads, as usuald!’ croaked Joseph, catching an opportunity
from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. ‘If I war yah, maister, I’d just
slam t’ boards i’ their faces all on ’em, gentle and simple! Never a day ut yah’re
off, but yon cat o’ Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo’s a ﬁne
lass! shoo sits watching for ye i’ t’ kitchen; and as yah’re in at one door, he’s out
at t’other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side! It’s bonny
behaviour, lurking amang t’ ﬁelds, after twelve o’ t’ night, wi’ that fahl,
ﬂaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think I’m blind; but I’m noan:

YAH’ (directing his discourse to me), ‘yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip
up and bolt into th’ house, t’ minute yah heard t’ maister’s horse-ﬁt clatter up t’
road.’
‘Silence, eavesdropper!’ cried Catherine; ‘none of your insolence before
me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was I who told
him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as you were.’

‘I never saw Heathcliff last night,’ answered Catherine, beginning to sob
bitterly: ‘and if you do turn him out of doors, I’ll go with him. But, perhaps,

UNIT 15 WEAK FORMS AND ELISION
15.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
* see how sounds can change when words are put together in a
sentence
* see how sounds may be lost (elided) when words are put together in
a sentence
* explore the unconscious rules for elision of /h/
* explore the unconscious rules for elision of /t/ and /d/.
15.2 Introduction
In this section of the book, we will start to think about what happens when we
put words together into longer stretches of speech, such as phrases and sentences.
We have already seen that phonemes vary greatly, but predictably, depending
on the sounds surrounding them in a word, and will now start to think about
what can happen in larger units of linguistic structure, such as sentences. In this
unit, we will think about how words change in connected speech, both in terms
of their vowels, and in terms of the loss or deletion of sounds. Then, in the
following units, we will look at sound addition and sound change.
15.3 Weak forms
Our ﬁrst job is to think about how the pronunciation of individual words can
change when they are put together in a sentence – that is, when they are in
connected speech.
Exercise 15.1 a)
Say the following words in isolation and transcribe them.
for
your
and
of
b)
Now say these phrases naturally and ﬂuently, and transcribe the entire
phrase.
i.
penny for your thoughts
ii.
ﬁsh and chips
iii.
cup of tea
191

c)
Compare the pronunciation of the words in (a) with those same words in
(b). What do you notice? What would the phrases sound like if you used the
pronunciations in (a) in place of those in (b)?
Comment a)
The correct transcriptions are /fɔ/, /jɔ/, /ænd/, /ɒv/.
b)
The transcriptions are:
i.
/pɛni fə jɔ θɔts/ or /pɛni fə jə θɔts/
ii.
/fɪʃ ən tʃɪps/ or ‘and’ may be /ənd/ /n/ /nd/
iii.
/kʌp əv ti/ or /kʌp ə ti/
c)
You will notice that the versions in isolation are pronounced differently to
the versions included in a sentence. Speciﬁcally, the vowels have changed
to schwa, and some of the consonants have been deleted. For example,
‘and’ has been transcribed alternatively as /ən/ and /n/. In both cases, the
vowel /æ/ has changed to /ə/, and the /d/ has been deleted in connected
speech. Alternatively, the whole syllable can be reduced to just a syllabic
nasal.
Such reduced pronunciations are known as weak forms, and they
tend to occur for function words (such as pronouns and prepositions) in
English. It is possible to use the pronunciations in (a) in Exercise 15.1
(which are called strong forms), instead of those in (b), but they would
sound fairly unnatural and disﬂuent. In particular, weak forms will occur
when these words are unstressed, as they tend to be within sentences;
therefore, weak forms are related to rhythmic stress (which we looked at
brieﬂy in Unit 8). If functions words are stressed, however, as they will
be in isolation, or if they are stressed in a sentence for emphasis, then
the strong form will be used.
The pronunciation of weak forms is often one of the hardest aspects of the
language to learn for non-native speakers. A particular problem is that not using
weak forms can cause misunderstandings. This is especially the case when the
strong forms are homophonous with other lexical items (words) in English.
For example, ‘for’ can sound like ‘four’ and ‘to’ like ‘two’, if the weak form
isn’t used.
15.4 Elision
Elision is simply the deletion or loss of a sound. We have seen some examples of
elision in our weak form words above, such as when ‘and’ is pronounced /n/.
Elision does not just occur in weak form words, however. It can occur also occur
in content words, and where there is no change of vowel, if certain conditions
are met. Again, these conditions are found when we put words together, in
connected speech.
SECTION THREE Putting words together
192

15.4.1 Elision of /t/ and /d/
Exercise 15.2 a)
Produce the following words in isolation. Can you hear a ﬁnal /t/ in each
case?
next
last
just
b)
Now, produce the following phrases quite quickly and naturally. Listen to
the /t/ in each case. Can you hear it being produced?
next day
last week
just so
Comment a)
In the isolated versions, you will certainly use a /t/ of some sort (remember
from Unit 11 the choice of three allophones of voiceless plosives that occur
before a pause).
b)
When you produce the phrases, however, the likelihood is that you do not
produce the ﬁnal /t/s at all, so transcriptions of these phrases would be
/nɛks deɪ/, /lɑs wik/ and /dʒʌs səʊ/.
Exercise 15.3 Why do you think /t/ can be deleted in these phrases? Do you think /t/ can be
deleted anywhere, depending on a speaker’s preference?
Comment In fact, there are some quite speciﬁc environments in which /t/ can be
deleted, depending somewhat on regional accent. It is never deleted in
onset position, for example. It would be very confusing and difﬁcult to
follow speech if people deleted sounds whenever they wanted to. Instead,
accent communities tend to share unconscious rules about where sounds
can be deleted; we are going to discover some of those rules now for
SSBE.
15.5 Elision of /t/ and /d/
The rules for elision of /t/ and /d/ are actually rather complex. We will discover
them one at a time.
Exercise 15.4 To start with, focus on the words below, which end with a /t/ or /d/ when
spoken in isolation. Look at the transcriptions and see if the alveolar
plosive is elided in each context. Compare the examples in set 1 with those
in set 2; then try to work out the environment in which elision can take
place.

hold
/hi sɛd həʊl faɪə/
/hi sɛd həʊld ɒn/
Comment You will see that /t/ and /d/ are elided in all the phrases in set 1, but not in those
in set 2. Hopefully, you will have realised that this is due to the onset of the word
following the /t/ or /d/. When the next word starts with a consonant, the /t/ or
/d/ is elided, but not when it starts with a vowel. Try saying the phrases on the
right with an elided consonant and note that, for many speakers, this sounds
rather odd (be careful to really elide the /t/, and not just replace it with a glottal
stop).
There are, however, more conditions for elision of /t/ and /d/ than simply
the following word starting with a consonant.
Exercise 15.5 Again, compare the sentences in set 1, which have elision, to those in set 2,
which do not. What rule is being demonstrated?

hold
/hi sɛd həʊl faɪə/
/hi sɛd həʊld hændz/
Comment Although the following word must begin with a consonant for elision to occur,
that consonant cannot be /h/.
Exercise 15.6 Does the rule demonstrated in Exercise 15.5 work in your accent of English? Try
producing the phrases in set 2 with and without elision, to see if they sound
okay.
Comment This rule is ﬁne for SSBE and many closely related accents. For other accents,
however, including my own London-Northern hybrid, /t/ and /d/ can be deleted
when they are followed by an /h/. Experiment, and listen to the speech you hear
around you, to ﬁnd out if this is also the case for your accent.
We now know that in SSBE, /t/ and /d/ can be deleted when they are
followed by a word starting with a consonant other than /h/. There are still more
conditions for elision to explore, however.
Exercise 15.7 Again, compare the examples in sets 1 and 2, to see what you can discover.
There are actually two rules to discover here, one illustrated in the ﬁrst list of
examples, and another in the second. For each rule, you will need to compare
the examples in set 1 with those in set 2.

Comment The rule 1 examples demonstrate that the /t/ or /d/ must be both
preceded and followed by a consonant in order to be elided. The rule 2
examples demonstrate that the preceding consonant must agree in voic-
ing with the /t/ or /d/. So, in clusters like /lt/ and /nt/, where the two
consonants differ in voicing, the plosive will not be elided (in SSBE),
even if all the other conditions are met. As for many of the ‘rules’ that
we have investigated, none of these rules for elision are conscious deci-
sions for a speaker about what it right and what is wrong, but instead
represent an unconscious awareness of how things work in their own
accent.
Exercise 15.8 We have covered all the rules for elision of /t/ and /d/ in SSBE now. See if you
can recap them without looking back in this unit, writing a description of the
environment in which they can be elided.
Comment For /t/ or /d/ to be elided in SSBE, they must be in the coda of a syllable, and
be preceded by another consonant with the same voicing. Additionally, the
following word must start with any consonant except /h/. You can think of
the /t/ or /d/ as having to be sandwiched between two other consonants.
This rule can also be summarised in Figure 15.1, where C represents a
consonant, # is a word (or syllable) boundary and the bold consonant is /t/
or /d/.

UNIT 15 Weak forms and elision

15.6 Elision of /h/
Another consonant that is commonly elided in connected speech is /h/. Again,
we will discover the rules for /h/ elision in SSBE by working through some
example phrases.
Exercise 15.9 What rule is demonstrated below for /h/ elision? Compare the examples in set 1
with those in set 2.
Set 1
Set 2
his
/ɪts ɪz bɜθdeɪ tədeɪ/
/hɪz bɜθdeɪ ɪz tədeɪ/
he
/ðɛn i wɛnt tə ðə ʃɒps/
/hi wɛnt tə ðə ʃɒps/
Comment Here you can see that /h/ is only elided when it occurs after the beginning of the
sentence. If it is at the start of the ﬁrst word of the sentence, as is the case for the
sentences in set 2, then it is not elided. However, there are some more rules we
must consider.
Exercise 15.10 Again, compare the examples in sets 1 and 2, to ﬁnd another condition for /h/
elision.
Set 1
Set 2
his
/ɪts ɪz ˈbɜθdeɪ təˈdeɪ/
/ɪts ˈhɪz bɜθdeɪ təˈdeɪ/
he
/ˈðɛn i ˈwɛnt tə ðə ˈʃɒps/
/ðɛn ˈhi wɛnt tə ðə ˈʃɒps/
Comment This is a little bit easier than some of the other examples we have looked at.
Essentially, /h/ can only be elided when it occurs in an unstressed syllable.
When a syllable is stressed, /h/ remains.
Exercise 15.11 Have a look at the ﬁnal rule for /h/ elision, again, by comparing the examples in
sets 1 and 2.
Set 1
Set 2
his
/ɪts ɪz bɜθdeɪ tədeɪ/
/ɪts hærɪz bɜθdeɪ tədeɪ/
he
/ðɛn i wɛnt tə ðə ˈʃɒps/
/ðɛn hɛnri wɛnt tə ðə ʃɒps/
have
/ðə ɡɜlz əv ɡɒn həʊm/
/ðə ɡɜlz hæv ə həʊm/
Comment In the sentences in set 1, /h/ is elided. All the words from which it is elided are
function words. You will have noted that in the ﬁnal pair, the two ‘have’s mean
different things. In the second sentence, ‘have’ means ‘possess’ and is a content
word, while in the ﬁrst, ‘have’ does not have its own meaning and is therefore a
function word.
So, in SSBE, /h/ can only be elided in unstressed function words that do not
occur at the start of a sentence. /h/ elision is a common feature of weak form
SECTION THREE Putting words together
196

words, as these are function words occurring in unstressed positions, and with
phonetic reduction.
Exercise 15.12 Do you think these rules for /h/ elision apply to all accents? Do they work for
you?
Comment As for /t/ and /d/ elision, the unconscious rules we have looked at are for SSBE,
but may not all apply to other accents. In Cockney, for example, /h/ elision is
less restricted and might occur variably in function words, as well as in content
words like nouns and verbs.
15.7 Connected speech processes
Elision is an example of a connected speech process (CSP). Connected speech
processes are changes that occur to sounds when words are put together in
groups – that is, when words are in connected form. The way a word sounds
when we say it in isolation may be rather unlike the way it sounds in connected
speech (as we have already seen when we considered weak forms). There are
some important points to remember about connected speech processes:
*
They occur at the edges of words, since this is where words ‘meet’ in
sentences.
*
Importantly, connected speech processes are optional. Try saying the
examples from Exercises 15.7 and 15.11, both with and without elision.
Both versions should sound ﬁne, even if the unelided versions sounds a bit
more formal and careful.
*
We can think of them affecting sounds at the phonemic level rather than the
allophonic level. When /t/ or /d/ or /h/ is elided, for example, we do not ﬁnd
that a different allophone occurs; we simply ﬁnd that the phoneme is lost
altogether.
*
Because CSPs affect phonemes, they may lead to confusions about meaning
(you will remember from Unit 9 that phonemes contribute to meaning, as
we see in minimal pairs tests).
Exercise 15.13 Can you think of any examples in which the elision of a consonant might lead to
a potential confusion about meaning?
Tip Start by thinking of a word that becomes another word when /t/ /d/ or /h/ is lost.
Comment One example might be the phrase /ðə nɛks rum/. In isolation, you would not
know if this is ‘the next room’ with an elided /t/, or ‘the ‘necks room’ without
any elision (particularly if /nɛks/ is stressed). Obviously, context will help you,
so it is rare that we even notice potential misunderstandings. We are also likely
to go for the most common interpretation, which would be ‘the next room’ in
UNIT 15 Weak forms and elision
197

this particular example. However, you can imagine that, in a doll-making
factory, for example, there might be a ‘necks room’, a ‘hands room’ and a
‘heads room’, which would make the phrase more ambiguous.
It is also important to remember that not all elisions will lead to a
possible confusion about meaning. For example, ‘the last time’, spoken with
an elided /t/, does not have an ambiguous meaning. It is only the case that
CSPs have the potential to inﬂuence perceived meaning, not that they will
always do so.
15.8 Word-internal cases of elision
The examples that we have looked at above are all connected speech examples of
elision, as they occur at word boundaries. However, elision can also take place
within words.
For example, ‘listless’ and ‘postbox’ can be produced with medial (in the
middle) /t/ in careful speech, but are frequently produced without this
consonant. This type of elision follows the same rules as those for between-word
elision, except that there is a syllable boundary rather than a word boundary
between the second and third consonants in the cluster.
In addition, some sequences of consonants within a single syllable may be
prone to elision, as we will now explore.
Exercise 15.14 Produce the words below slowly and carefully and then transcribe them. Now
say the same words quickly and casually. What do you notice?
asked
ﬁfth
clothes
Comment These words contain sequences of consonants that can all be pronounced when
the speaker is being slow and careful. When a person is speaking in a normal,
casual manner, however, some of the consonants are apt to be elided; these
consonants are shown in brackets below.
asked
/ɑs(k)t/
ﬁfths
/fɪf(θ)s/ or /fɪ(f)θs/
clothes
/kləʊ(ð)z/
15.9 Vowel elision
Throughout the book so far, we have seen that words such as ‘hidden’ and
‘bottle’ may be pronounced either with a syllabic /n/ or /l/ in the ﬁnal syllable, as
/hɪdn/ and /bɒtl/, or with a schwa before the sonorant consonant, as /hɪdən/ and
/bɒtəl/. We have also seen that if the syllabic pronunciation is used, then the /d/
in ‘hidden’ is nasally released and the /t/ in ‘bottle’ is laterally released: [hɪdnn]
SECTION THREE Putting words together
198

and [bɒtll]. One way to explain these cases of syllabic consonants is to say that a
person keeps a pronunciation containing /ə/ in their mental lexicon, but that the
schwa is elided when they speak, and they produce the version with the syllabic
consonant.
Exercise 15.15 Say the words ‘hidden’ and ‘bottle’ with and without a schwa in the second
syllable. How natural does each one feel and sound to you?
Comment As we saw in Unit 8, this is very much a matter of personal preference, and may
also vary according to the situation and who we are talking to, as we explored in
Unit 14 when we considered variation. Now that you are quite experienced in
phonetics, it would be useful to try to monitor your own pronunciations and
those you hear around you, to observe when people do and do not use syllabic
consonants.
Schwa might also be deleted word-internally when it is unstressed and
comes before a nasal, /r/ or /l/, and then another unstressed vowel (for example,
/ənə/, /ərə/ or /ələ/).
Exercise 15.16 Try producing the following words. How many syllables do you produce? Does
this vary, depending on how quickly and casually you speak?
camera
family
traveller
battery
Comment For some speakers, these words will all have two syllables (and thus two vowels)
in casual speech, such as /kæmrə/, while the middle vowel (or syllabic conso-
nant) will be retained in careful speech, so that the words are produced with
three syllables, such as /kæmərə/. The number of syllables produced can also
vary according to how frequently a person says a word, with more frequent
words being more prone to elision. For other speakers, however, the ‘middle’
vowel never occurs, even in the most formal speech. In this case, we cannot talk
about vowel elision, as there is no sound to be deleted from the entry in the
speaker’s mental lexicon. This is the case for me, particularly for the word
‘camera’, which sounds wrong to me when I produce it with three syllables.
The process of elision that occurs in words such as those in Exercise 15.16, is
also known as compression. There are two alternative pronunciations, and in
one of those pronunciations two syllables have been compressed into one.
15.10 Summary
In this unit, we have looked at several situations where consonants and vowels
can be deleted, and we have referred to this process as elision. We have seen that
/t/, /d/ and /h/ can be elided when they occur in particular environments, and
that vowels can change when function words are unstressed and given their
weak form.

15.11 Looking forward
In the next unit, we will look at another connected speech process and see that,
under some circumstances, sounds that do not exist in individual words can be
added when words are put together in sentences.

vowels to schwa, but you may also need to delete some consonants in weak
form words, and should also look for a couple of other examples of elision.
The straight lines [ | || ] in the transcription represent intonation phrase
breaks, which we will think about more towards the end of the book, but, for
now, these will help you to read the transcription.

The last time he stayed with her, she put him in a grand guest room in the
west wing. They had been the greatest friends for the best part of the past
decade. She usually gave him a feast, but it was always fast food and seemed
to taste bland sometimes. Most nights he’d eat the least that he could, and
hide vast quantities in the waste basket. Then, when the mist was just right, he
always crept from the house to hand the basket to a lost traveller, who was
trying to fend for himself on the land nearby.

UNIT 16 LIAISON
16.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
see that liaison is the addition of sounds in connected speech
*
explore the unconscious rules for liaison
*
identify the difference and similarities between linking /r/ and intrusive /r/.
16.2 Introduction
As we have seen in Unit 15, connected speech processes can delete phonemes
when we string words together. This process is called elision. In this unit, we will
look at how phonemes can also be added in connected speech.
16.3 The problem of adjacent vowels
Many languages do not like two vowels to occur next to each other, a situation
called hiatus. For example, if you are familiar with French, you know that
special things happen to the deﬁnite article when a noun begins with a vowel.
So, French speakers say ‘la table’ and ‘le café’, but ‘l’Angleterre’. Languages use
different ways to avoid the problem of hiatus, such as elision in French. The
major process for addressing hiatus in English is the addition of a phoneme,
which is also known as liaison.
16.4 /r/ liaison
In non-rhotic accents of English, the sound that is most commonly added
between two vowels is /r/.
Exercise 16.1 a)
Transcribe the following words as they would be spoken by a speaker with a
non-rhotic accent.
car
more
fear
202

b)
Now say the following phrases quickly and casually, or ask someone with a
non-rhotic accent to say them for you, and then transcribe what you hear.
car aerial
more or less
fear of it
Comment a)
You should be familiar by now with the idea that the orthographic <r> in
these words is not pronounced by non-rhotic speakers, who only pro-
nounce /r/ before vowels. So we transcribe /kɑ/, /mɔ/ and /fɪə/.
b)
When you did the transcriptions of the phrases, you are likely to have
found that an /r/ can be inserted between the ﬁrst two words. By tradition,
we add this /r/ to the end of the ﬁrst word in transcription (and acoustic
evidence seems to suggest that it does indeed form the coda of the ﬁrst
syllable). So, we get /kɑr ɛərɪəl/, /mɔr ə lɛs/ and /fɪər əv ɪt/.
16.5 Linking /r/
The phenomenon that we have just investigated is called linking /r/. When a
word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, an /r/ can
be inserted between the words. This is perhaps a reinsertion of the /r/ that would
have occurred in these words before /r/ was lost in this position in non-rhotic
accents (see Unit 1).
It is important to note that, like any connected speech process, linking /r/ is
optional. It primarily occurs in rapid casual speech, but can be avoided by the
speaker, who may well use [ʔ] instead. In contrast, however, the same process
also occurs within words, where it is obligatory. A common example of this
phenomenon within words is when the progressive sufﬁx ‘-ing’ is added to a
word ending in <r> or <re>. So, non-rhotic speakers pronounce ‘bore’ /bɔ/, but
‘boring’ is pronounced /bɔrɪ˛/.
16.6 Intrusive /r/
You will have noticed that all the examples above had <r> or <re> in the
spelling of the word, and for that reason we have said that, at some point in
their history, they would also have contained an /r/ when spoken in isolation,
even though that /r/ has now been lost for non-rhotic speakers. However,
liaison also occurs when there is no <r> in the spelling, for words that never
contained an /r/ when spoken in isolation, and in these instances the process
is called intrusive /r/.
UNIT 16 Liaison
203

Exercise 16.2 a)
Transcribe the following words.
gnaw
baa
saw
b)
Now transcribe the following phrases when they are said quickly and
casually.
gnaw a bone
baa of a sheep
saw a plank
Comment a)
These words do not have an /r/ in them in any accent. Speakers pronounce
/nɔ/, /bɑ/ and /sɔ/.
b)
However, non-rhotic speakers will have found that the words in (a) can all
have an /r/ inserted after them when they occur before a word that starts
with a vowel, as in (b). So, non-rhotic speakers pronounce /nɔr ə bəʊn/,
/bɑr əv ə ʃip/ and /sɔr ə plæ˛k/. This is the same process as linking /r/, as
can be seen by thinking about homophones of the target words, which all
include an /r/ in the spelling (nor, bar and sore). In fact, the joke book
title, Treats for Pets by Nora Bone, just would not work if it were not for
intrusive /r/.
Like linking /r/, intrusive /r/ is an optional process that speakers have some
degree of choice over. However, intrusive /r/ is somewhat stigmatised by some
non-linguists, and provokes blog posts and letters to newspaper editors, about
pronunciations – for example, ‘law and order’, which may sound like ‘Laura
Norder’ or ‘law ran order’. Nevertheless, intrusive /r/ is a typical feature of a
great many English speakers’ regular pronunciation, and serves as another
reminder to us about the differences between speech and spelling.
16.7 Conditions for /r/-liaison
To recap, linking and intrusive /r/ are both types of /r/-liaison, whereby an /r/ is
added to separate two otherwise adjacent vowels. However, the situation is not
quite as simple as described above, since there are further conditions on what
types of vowels lead to /r/-liaison.
Exercise 16.3 a)
In all the following phrases, the ﬁrst word ends in a vowel when produced
in isolation and the next word is always ‘and’, and therefore starts with a
vowel. Say the phrases quickly and casually and make a broad transcrip-
tion, or, if you are a rhotic speaker, ask a friend with a non-rhotic accent to
say them for you. Listen particularly for whether /r/-liaison can occur
between the ﬁrst and second words.

mango and honey
paw paw and yogurt
pear and sugar
b)
Now divide the above phrases into two groups: the ones where /r/-liaison
occurs, and the ones where it does not. (Do not worry, for now, about
whether any instance of liaison is a linking or intrusive /r/; just put them all
in one group.)
Comment a)
The phrases transcribed in SSBE are: /tʃεri ən tʃɒklət/, /bənɑnər ən tɒﬁ/,
/mæ˛gəʊ ən hʌni/, /pɔ pɔr ən jɒgət/ and /pεər ən ʃʌgə/. Note that different
weak forms of ‘and’ are possible without affecting our point here.
b)
You have probably noticed that the phrases allowing /r/-liaison are the
ones that begin with ‘banana’ /bənɑnə/, ‘paw paw’ /pɔ pɔ/ and ‘pear’ /pɛə/.
The ones where liaison does not occur are those beginning with ‘cherry’
/tʃɛri/ and ‘mango’ /mæ˛gəʊ/.
Note that the words where liaison occurs all end in a non-high vowel or a
centring diphthong (that is, a diphthong ending in schwa). The words that do
not allow liaison end in high vowels or closing diphthongs (that is, diphthongs
ending in high vowels). So, if we wanted to summarise the conditions for /r/-
liaison, we could say that the ﬁrst word ends with a non-high vowel and the next
word starts with a vowel (which can be of any type). If the ﬁrst word has an <r>
in the spelling, we call this process linking /r/. If there is no orthographic <r> in
the ﬁrst word, the process is known as intrusive /r/. Both linking and intrusive
/r/ are types of /r/-liaison.
16.8 /r/-liaison and rhoticity
We have seen that non-rhotic accents use intrusive and linking /r/. However, for
rhotic speakers, neither of these processes applies. Firstly, there will be no
intrusive /r/ because speakers of these accents only produce /r/ when there is an
<r> in the spelling of the word, so never in words like ‘gnaw’ or ‘baa’, regardless
of what sound follows. Secondly, the words that do have an <r> in the spelling
(such as ‘car’ and ‘more’) will be produced with an /r/, even in isolation, so it is
not the case that a linking /r/ will be inserted as part of connected speech.
16.9 Potential meaning confusion
As we have seen in Unit 15, connected speech processes can be thought of as
involving change at the phoneme level, and therefore have the potential to affect
perceived meaning.
UNIT 16 Liaison
205

Exercise 16.4 a)
How might the phrase ‘Did you see her ashes?’ be ambiguous in meaning?
b)
While on holiday in Cornwall, I came across a shop called ‘At your equest’,
which specialises in horse-riding clothing. How does the name of this shop
exploit linking /r/ to give two possible meanings?
Comment a)
Out of context, it might be difﬁcult to tell if the ﬁnal word is ‘ashes’, with
linking /r/, or ‘rashes’, where the /r/ belongs to the lexical item.
b)
If the phrase is produced without a linking /r/, then the ﬁnal word sounds
like ‘equest’, which refers to horses and the merchandise sold in the shop. If
it is pronounced with a linking /r/, it will sound like ‘request’, and the name
will suggest good customer service. Therefore, the shop name plays on
linking /r/ to highlight two of its most important features: what it sells and
how its customers will be treated.
16.10 Newer liaison forms
If you use [ʋ] in lexical items, then you will likely also use this realisation when
you produce linking and intrusive /r/. However, it is noticeable that many
younger speakers (regardless of whether they use [ʋ] or [ɹ] within words) are
now inserting a glottal stop instead of an /r/ when two eligible vowels are
adjacent. Listen to yourself and the speakers around you, and see if you can ﬁnd
people using [ʔ], [ʋ] and [ɹ] to separate the vowels of adjacent words.
16.11 Other types of liaison in English
The major liaison type in English is /r/-liaison, as explored above. However,
there is another type of liaison, which most speakers are aware of in some form.
Exercise 16.5 Remember back to your schooldays when you were learning to spell. What is
the rule about the form of the indeﬁnite article (a/an) when it precedes a noun
that starts with a vowel?
Comment As you will probably remember, if a noun starts with a written consonant, we
use the indeﬁnite article ‘a’. So we write ‘a cat’, ‘a dog’ and ‘a stegosaurus’. But
if a word starts with a written vowel, we use ‘an’ – for example, ‘an owl’, ‘an elk’
and ‘an archaeopteryx’.
Of course, when we are learning to spell, we are only thinking about written
consonants and vowels, rather than the speech sounds. Although in most cases
the two marry up well, there are some exceptions. For example children are
warned to pay special attention to words beginning with written <u>. For words
like ‘umbrella’, ‘an’ must be used, as you would expect from the spelling. For
SECTION THREE Putting words together
206

words like ‘unicorn’, however, ‘a’ must be used, because the word sounds like it
starts with a ‘y’. Of course, as phoneticians, we know that this rule is really all
about spoken vowels and consonants. Words that start with spoken vowels,
including the /ʌ/ of ‘umbrella’, are preceded by ‘an’. Those beginning with
spoken consonants, including the /j/ in ‘unicorn’, are preceded by ‘a’. This,
again, is a type of liaison, as /n/ is used to keep apart vowels that would
otherwise be adjacent. For certain words, over the course of time, the /n/ of ‘an’
has been re-analysed as part of the following noun. Thus ‘a newt’ was called ‘an
ewt’ in Middle English. The opposite process can also occur, where an /n/
originally belonging to a noun is re-analysed as part of the indeﬁnite article.
Thus, ‘an apron’ was ‘a napron’ in Middle English.
Exercise 16.6 What about the deﬁnite article ‘the’? Do you think it changes according to
whether the following word starts with a spoken consonant or vowel? (You
might remember that we have already considered this brieﬂy in Unit 6.)
Try it out with these pairs, by putting ‘the’ in front of them and listening to
its pronunciation.
ape
monkey
orange
pear
ant
spider
Comment You have likely found that there is a difference in the pronunciation of ‘the’.
Before words starting with a consonant, the vowel is likely to be a schwa, /ðə/,
whereas before words starting with a vowel, the pronunciation is likely to be /ði/.
You may have noticed that when we put the /ði/ form next to a word starting with
a vowel, we have two vowels adjacent, which is generally the situation that liaison
avoids. However, as we have seen in the examples in Exercise 16.3 (such as ‘cherry
and chocolate’), sequences of vowels are permissible in English when the ﬁrst
vowel is high, like /i/.
16.12 Elision and liaison
It is also possible for elision and liaison to interact. For example, the phrase ‘or
her sister’ might be pronounced as /ɔ hə sɪstə/, or with an elided /h/, as in /ɔ ə
sɪstə/, or with an elided /h/ and a linking /r/, as in /ɔr ə sɪstə/. Note though that it
cannot be pronounced with a linking /r/ unless the /h/ is elided too, as the
conditions for linking /r/ would not exist (there would not be two adjacent
vowels in the utterance). This suggests that there is an ordering of the uncon-
scious rules that we store for connected speech, in that /h/ elision can apply ﬁrst
and provide the conditions for linking /r/ to occur. Of course, it is important to
remember that both these processes are optional, so any three of the versions
transcribed could be produced.
UNIT 16 Liaison
207

16.13 Summary
We have seen that sounds that do not occur in isolated words can be added in
connected speech if the right conditions exist. Particularly, /r/ can be added to
separate adjacent vowels in non-rhotic accents of English; this is called
/r/-liaison. If there is an <r> in the spelling of a word, we call the process linking
/r/, while it is referred to as intrusive /r/ if there is no <r> in the orthography.
16.14 Looking forward
In the next unit, we will look at the process of assimilation, in which phonemes
are not added or deleted, but rather one phoneme changes to sound like
another.

passage were spoken by a rhotic speaker. You may also wish to ﬁnd places
where elision could occur in SSBE, as there are several in this passage.
Far away from here is the home of a little girl called Clare. Clare is the
sister of another little girl called Emma. Emma and Clare like to go
shopping for their mum Sarah. One day Sarah asked them to go and buy
some fruit from the greengrocer. Clare and Emma got to the store and
had a difﬁcult decision to make. Sarah always gave them a shopping list
but they’d lost it on the way. They couldn’t remember if they were
supposed to buy pears or apples or oranges. In the end they decided to go
back home to ask their mum, who told them not to worry as they’d all go
again the next day.

UNIT 17 ASSIMILATION
17.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
*
explore how sounds can change to become allophones of different
phonemes (assimilation)
*
discover how sounds can change in voice, place or manner
*
investigate the unconscious rules for assimilation in English.
17.2 Introduction
In this unit, we will look at the ﬁnal connected speech process that we will
consider for English. We have already investigated elision and liaison, which
refer to loss and addition of phonemes, respectively. We will now look at how
phonemes can change into other phonemes in connected speech, which is
termed assimilation.
17.3 Voicing assimilation
Exercise 17.1 Transcribe ‘has’ and ‘have’ when they are spoken in isolation.
Now transcribe the phrases ‘has to’ and ‘have to’, spoken in a quick and
natural style.
Compare the ﬁnal fricatives of ‘has’ and ‘have’ when the words are in
isolation to how they sound when they are in the phrases. What do you notice?
Comment The transcriptions for the isolated forms are /hæz/ and /hæv/, with voiced
fricatives in the coda. Hopefully, you discovered that, in the phrases, the voiced
fricatives are produced as their voiceless counterparts, suggesting we should
transcribe /hæs tə/ and /hæf tə/.
Exercise 17.2 Why do you think the voicing of the sounds in Exercise 17.1 might change in
connected speech?
Tip Look at the surrounding environment.
Comment In both of the phrases, the voiced fricative is next to a voiceless sound (/t/ in this
case). As we saw when we looked at coarticulation, sounds can affect one
another. In this case, the voicelessness of the following /t/ affects the voicing of
210

the previous sound; we term this ‘anticipatory assimilation of voicing’ (you may
remember the terms ‘anticipatory’ and ‘perseverative’ from when we intro-
duced coarticulation in Unit 9).
Exercise 17.3 a)
In the comment on Exercise 17.2, we suggested that assimilation is rather
like coarticulation, in that it involves spread, or overlap, of features from
one sound to another. If assimilation and coarticulation are rather similar,
why do you think we give them different names?
b)
A related question is why do you think we transcribe [hæs tu] rather than
[hæz̊ tu] in order to show the change in voicing?
Comment a)
As we have been saying for the last couple of units, connected speech
processes can be thought of as applying to speech sounds at the phonemic
level. So, for elision and liaison, we talk about adding or deleting phonemes;
for assimilation, we are also talking about a difference at the phonemic
level. In effect, we are saying that the change is so big that the sound in
question sounds like an allophone of a different phoneme.
b)
The sound at the end of ‘have’ is /v/ in the mental lexicon (where the
pronunciation in isolation of all words is stored), but it changes so much
that it becomes [f] (which is an allophone of /f/) in ‘have to’. Evidence for a
full phonemic change comes from the duration of the preceding vowel. The
vowel in ‘has’ and ‘have’ is likely to undergo pre-fortis clipping in ‘has to’
and ‘have to’, which, as we saw in Unit 12, happens before consonants
classiﬁed as voiceless (but not those consonants classiﬁed as voiced, even if
they are devoiced by coarticulation). Thus, we transcribe this as a change at
the phonemic level. Also, these changes can potentially affect meaning, as
we will see later.
The view that this is a phonemic change is not taken by all theorists, though,
as there are some who say that [s], in this instance, would still be an allophone of
/z/, and [f] an allophone of /v/. This debate is outside the scope of this book,
however, and we ﬁnd it quite useful to distinguish variation that can (assim-
ilation) and can not (coarticulation) contribute towards perceived meaning. If
you are interested, you can read more about this topic by using the suggestions
in the Resources section (page 278).
Exercise 17.4 Have a look at the following phrases and say them quickly and casually. Does
voicing assimilation take place here? If not, why not?
has partied
have fought
Comment In these phrases, it is unlikely that assimilation of voicing takes place. It is really
important to remember that, in English, voicing assimilation only takes place in set
phrases. Set phrases are words that occur together on a very frequent basis, such as
UNIT 17 Assimilation
211

‘have to’ and ‘has to’, which we looked at above. Complete devoicing (with a
switch from lenis to fortis) certainly is not ubiquitous, and does not occur every
time a voiced fricative occurs next to a voiceless sound. For non-set phrases, there
will be devoicing on an allophonic level, but the sound remains lenis, and the
length of the preceding vowel will remain the same. So, our examples above would
be /həz ˈpɑtɪd/ [həz̊ ˈphɑtɪd̊] and /həz ˈfɔt/ [həz̊ ˈfɔt]. Listen to the speech around
you and try to observe which phrases have phonemic devoicing and which do not.
17.4 Place assimilation
One of the most widespread types of assimilation in English is place assimila-
tion. Although it follows particular rules, it is not restricted to set phrases, as
voicing assimilation is, and it tends to occur very frequently. Once you know
what to listen for, you will likely hear place assimilation anytime you listen to a
sample of speech – for example, on the bus or when watching the TV, or even
just listening to yourself.
Exercise 17.5 Pronounce and transcribe the word ‘tin’ as it would be spoken in isolation. Now
produce the following phrases quickly and casually, and transcribe what you
hear, focussing on the consonant at the end of the word ‘tin’.
tin cans
tin pans
Comment You will have noticed that, in isolation, the word ‘tin’ ends in a voiced alveolar
nasal, and thus the word would be transcribed as /tɪn/. In the phrases, however,
the place of articulation of the ﬁnal sound can change. In ‘tin cans’, the /n/
becomes a velar nasal [˛], consistent with the characteristics of the phoneme /˛/.
In ‘tin pans’, it becomes a bilabial nasal [m], consistent with the phoneme /m/.
Exercise 17.6 Why do you think /n/ can change to [˛] and [m] in the examples in Exercise
17.5? What inﬂuences the change, and why does it not change to a different
sound, like [k] or [b], for example?
Comment Similarly to what we have seen for coarticulation, the change of place for /n/ is
inﬂuenced by the following consonant. So, the /n/ has become velar before a
velar, and bilabial before a bilabial. Notice that only its place of articulation has
changed. Its voicing stays the same (that is, it remains voiced) and its manner
stays the same (that is, it remains nasal). Place assimilation applies to any
alveolar plosive or nasal (that is, oral and nasal stops) before a velar or bilabial
sound, and this type of place assimilation is also known as dealveolarisation.
Alveolar plosives and nasals can also become bilabial before labial-velar /w/,
as in ‘right-wing’, produced as /raɪp wɪ˛/. In addition, they can become
labiodentals before labiodentals (/f/ and /v/). So, in ‘cat ﬂap’, the /t/ might
become [p ̪], a labiodental plosive, which is an allophone of /p/, so we could
SECTION THREE Putting words together
212

transcribe /kæp ﬂæp/ in broad transcription. This is very similar to the coarti-
culatory process we saw in Unit 10, where /p b m/ are labiodental before /f v/.
Here we consider the process as assimilation, however, as the resulting allo-
phones sound like allophones of different phonemes.
Exercise 17.7 How will the ﬁnal ‘alveolar’ sound be pronounced in the following colour terms
if dealveolarisation takes place? Remember that place changes to match the next
consonant, but voicing and manner stay the same.
white coffee; red wine; green grass; violet cream; emerald forest; chocolate
brown; brown bear
Comment Transcriptions are likely to be: /waɪk kɒﬁ/, /rɛb waɪn/, /ɡri˛ ɡrɑs/, /vaɪələk krim/,
/ɛmərəlb fɒrɪst/ or /ɛmrəlb fɒrɪst/, /tʃɒkləp braʊn/ and /braʊm bɛə/.
Note that the /t/s at the end of ‘white’ and ‘chocolate’ could be produced as
glottal stops at the allophonic level, rather than a phonemic place change
occurring. The /d/ in ‘emerald’ could be elided, since all three conditions for
elision are met (see section 15.5, page 193). The choice between connected
speech processes is a point we will return to towards the end of the unit.
When looking at the place assimilations, we also need to think back to the idea
of ‘unreleased plosives’, which we ﬁrst visited in Unit 11. There, we said that in
utterances like ‘bad day’, the ﬁrst /d/ might have wide oral release, or might be
unreleased because it is followed by a homorganic plosive. If it is unreleased,
gemination is said to have occurred, and a plosive with a long hold phrase, and
single approach and release phases, will be produced. We also noted that the two
variants (unreleased and wide oral release) are in free allophonic variation in this
environment. The situation is somewhat different, however, when a sequence of
homorganic plosives is formed by assimilation, as we will see now.
Exercise 17.8 a)
Repeat the following exercise from Unit 11. Produce ‘bad day’ with an
unreleased ﬁrst plosive, and with wide oral release. Do they both sound
okay in your variety of English?
b)
Now try the same thing with /waɪk kɒﬁ/, from Exercise 17.8. Does the ﬁrst /k/
sound equally ﬁne with wide oral release as it does when it is unreleased?
Comment a)
You should be able to hear that either variant sounds ﬁne, and that the
choice between wide oral release and no release is down to the speaker and
the situation (a case of free allophonic variation).
b)
Here, however, only the unreleased plosive is possible for native English
speakers. So, while [waɪk̊ kɒﬁ] sounds ﬁne, it sounds distinctly odd to say
[waɪk kɒﬁ], with wide oral release of the ﬁrst plosive. In most varieties of
English, then, only the unreleased variant is used when a sequence of
homorganic plosives has been formed by assimilation. Therefore, there is
no free allophonic variation for plosives in this situation.
UNIT 17 Assimilation
213

Exercise 17.9 What do you think might happen when two (or more) alveolar stops appear in the
coda of a syllable and are followed by a velar or bilabial consonant in the next word?
Try it with the alveolar stops in ‘can’t go’ and ‘won’t move’.
Comment When there are two alveolar stops at the end of a word, and they are followed by
a word starting with a bilabial or velar, they can both assimilate, so we would
transcribe /kɑ˛k ɡəʊ/ and /wəʊmp muv/. This is in line with Unit 8, which dealt
with phonotactics, in which we said that a nasal and a voiceless plosive in the
coda of a syllable always have the same POA in English.
Exercise 17.10 Alveolar fricatives can also be affected by place assimilation.
Transcribe ‘glass’ and ‘jazz’.
Now transcribe ‘glass shavings’ and ‘jazz shoe’, paying particular attention
to the ﬁnal consonant of the ﬁrst word. What do you notice?
Comment In isolation, ‘glass’ ends with /s/ and ‘jazz’ ends with /z/. However, in the
phrases, /s/ can become /ʃ/, and /z/ can become /ʒ/. The ‘rule’ is that alveolar
fricatives can become postalveolar fricatives before a postalveolar sound, and
also before palatals (/j/).
Exercise 17.11 Transcribe the following sentence, including all place assimilations that could
occur.
Those sheriffs surely can’t mend my shotgun quickly.
Comment /ðəʊʒ ʃɛrɪfʃ ʃɔli kɑmp mɛmb maɪ ʃɒkgʌ˛ kwɪkli/.
Notice that /b/ in ‘mend’ could also be elided, and that assimilation can also
occur within a word, as in ‘shotgun’ (although here, strictly speaking, it is not a
connected speech process).
17.5 Manner assimilation
Assimilation of manner does not really happen in isolation in English, but does
happen in combination with place assimilation.
Exercise 17.12 Transcribe the words ‘won’t’, ‘did’ and ‘you’ in isolation. Now, saying them
quickly and naturally, transcribe the phrases ‘won’t you’ and ‘did you’.
Comment In isolation, the words are /wəʊnt/, /dɪd/ and /ju/. However, when the words are
combined in connected speech, it is quite likely that you heard /wəʊntʃu/ and /dɪdʒu/.
This process is called coalescence and can occur when an alveolar plosive is
immediately before /j/. The plosive and /j/ combine to become the single
affricate phoneme /tʃ/ or /dʒ/ (depending on the voicing of the plosive). This
process has happened word-internally, too, in the history of English. As we saw
in our earlier unit on variation (Unit 14), words like ‘tune’, which you probably
SECTION THREE Putting words together
214

pronounce as /tʃun/, were previously produced as /tjun/ in SSBE (and may still
have this pronunciation for older speakers). However, they have changed over
time, with the coalesced form becoming the most prevalent among younger
speakers.
Exercise 17.13 Coalescence can also affect alveolar fricatives. Transcribe ‘this year’. Listen
closely to the fricative at the end of ‘this’. What happens to it in this phrase?
Comment As connected speech processes are always optional, there is the possibility that
/s/ remains the same as it is in isolation. If assimilation does occur, there are
two possibilities. The ﬁrst is simple place assimilation, as we have seen above.
Here, the /s/ may become /ʃ/, so we have /ðɪʃ jɪə/. However, coalescence may
also take place, whereby the /s/ and /j/ combine to become a single /ʃ/ sound,
as in /ðɪʃɪə/. Try producing both versions and see which one you are most likely
to use.
17.6 Elision and assimilation
As we have seen, we sometimes have situations in which either elision or
assimilation can apply. For example, we saw in ‘emerald forest’ that a speaker
could elide the /d/ because the three conditions for its elision, described in Unit
15, are fulﬁlled (it is in a cluster of three consonants, the one before it agrees in
voicing, and the one after is not /h/). So, a speaker of SSBE could say /ɛmərəl
fɒrɪst/. However, the /d/ is also in a suitable environment for place assimilation,
and therefore could also be produced as [b̪], in which case we would transcribe
/ɛmərəlb fɒrɪst/. Since each of these processes is optional, the speaker could also
produce /ɛmərəld fɒrɪst/ with no elision or assimilation, or /ɛmrəld fɒrɪst/, if
they elide a vowel in ‘emerald’. Yet again, we see that speech is subject to a great
deal of variation, and that speakers continually make unconscious choices about
the forms they use, based on both the situation and personal preference.
So, in some situations, speakers can choose between elision and assimilation.
However, elision and assimilation also interact in another way. In some situa-
tions, both elision and assimilation can apply at the same time. For example, the
word ‘handbag’ might be produced in full as /hændbæg/. However, the /d/ is in a
site where elision is possible, so the phrase could be produced as /hænbæg/.
Furthermore, when the /d/ is elided, it leaves /n/ in a position for place assim-
ilation. So, we frequently hear /hæmbæg/. In this ﬁnal example, we see again that
connected speech processes have the potential to inﬂuence meaning. Is
/hæmbæg/ a rendition of ‘handbag’ with elision and dealveolarisation, or is it
simply ‘ham bag’? In real life, the context and knowledge of the speaker’s habitual
patterns and preferences would help you to decide, and you would probably opt
for the most likely meaning. So, in reality, we are rarely confused by CSPs,
although they do have the potential to cause misunderstandings.

17.7 Summary
We have seen that sometimes sounds change in connected speech so that they
sound like allophones of a different phoneme. We have called this process
assimilation, and looked at changes of voice, place and manner.
17.8 Looking forward
We have now covered the vast majority of information that we need to know
about the consonants and vowels in English. In the upcoming units, we will
practise our transcription and think about pitch and intonation in English.

That garden must surely need plenty of work. You have to keep the grass
short, paint fences, shovel sand, plant bulbs, weed borders and water all
those shoots. Don’t you get bored by all that work, and ﬁnd you want more

3 Make up some sentences of your own that have as many assimilations as
possible. Try to include at least ﬁve examples of assimilation in each. Good
words to use are those that end in alveolars, as these can assimilate, as well
as words that start with bilabials, velars or labiodentals, which trigger
assimilation. Have a look at the sentence in Exercise 17.11 to help you get

18.2 Introduction
Over the course of this book, we have been discovering more and more about
the detail of speech. We have looked at coarticulation and allophones, and
various processes of connected speech, such as elision, liaison and assimilation.
In this unit we will try to put all of these topics together and also return to some
aspects of transcription that students often ﬁnd difﬁcult.
18.3 Thinking about transcription
Exercise 18.1 Are these statements about transcription true or false?
a)
Transcription is the only way to capture what someone says.
b)
The type of transcription we use will depend on our purposes and the
situation.
c)
Transcriptions are an accurate representation of a stretch of speech.
d)
There will only ever be one correct transcription for an utterance.
Comment a)
Clearly false. We might also make an audio or video recording of a person’s
speech, or turn it into a parametric diagram. We could write it down in
orthography as well.
b)
True. At the moment, you know that allophonic transcriptions show more
detail than broad transcriptions, and we will look at when you might use
each type shortly.
218

c)
This depends very much on the transcription, which, in turn, will depend
on the experience and skill of the transcriber, and how difﬁcult the material
is to transcribe.
d)
It is important to remember that there may be different ways to transcribe
the same thing. This is partly due to the purposes for which the tran-
scription is used. For example, both broad and allophonic transcriptions of
the same utterance could be correct. Also, it is important to remember that
a transcription is not just a recording of an utterance. It represents, in part,
the transcriber’s analysis of what has been said. Thus, two transcribers
could come up with similar, but slightly different, transcriptions, depend-
ing on the analysis they have made. For example, the same vowel might be
transcribed as [e̞] (lowered cardinal 2) or [ɛ̝] (raised cardinal 3). We will
examine some of these points further in this unit.
18.4 Types of transcription
Exercise 18.2 What are the types of transcription you know about so far? Under what
circumstances do you think you might use them?
Comment So far, we have concentrated on allophonic and broad transcription. As you
know, these can both be used to represent the same stretch of speech. A broad
transcription gives us only the detail that might contribute to meaning, and
ignores the predictable detail due to the environment and coarticulation.
As we saw in Unit 13, an allophonic transcription will include details such as
aspiration, devoicing and nasalisation, whereas a broad transcription will not.
As we hinted at before, the type of transcription you make will depend on your
purposes. In a dictionary, for example, it is likely that only the phonemic level of
representation will be considered important. If we want to note subtle details in
voicing, then an allophonic transcription will be more appropriate.
18.4.1 Impressionistic and systematic transcription
Both broad and allophonic transcription are types of systematic transcription.
This means that the transcriber knows what the options are for the speech that
is being transcribed. For example, the transcriber of SSBE would know which
vowels and consonants are possible in the variety and would pick the appro-
priate symbol from that limited set. They would also know which connected
speech processes operate in that particular variety of English. Likewise, for an
allophonic transcription, the transcriber knows what allophones exist in the
variety and in which environments they occur. Thus, the transcription follows a
system, and is therefore called systematic.
UNIT 18 Broad transcription
219

Exercise 18.3 Can you think of any situations in which you would want to transcribe speech,
but do not know the system of the variety you are listening to?
Comment There are several situations in which you might not know the system of the speech
you are transcribing. For example, if you were working with a language that had not
been documented before, you would not have any prior knowledge of the system.
Likewise, speech and language therapists working with a client for the ﬁrst time
would not know the system the client used to make meaningful contrasts. If you do
not know the system, you are forced into using an impressionistic transcription,
which means ﬁtting what you hear into all the possible sounds of the IPA, including
all the variations indicated by diacritics. In both of these cases, an initial impres-
sionistic transcription would probably be used to develop knowledge of the system,
so that systematic broad or allophonic transcriptions could be used in future. In
addition, you might choose to use an impressionistic transcription if you wanted to
capture individual variation in great detail, or if you wanted to study a variety for
which you think you know the system, but want to be sure.
Exercise 18.4 What skills do you need to be able to transcribe? Think about the steps that you
go through and what you are doing at each stage. For example, as a starting
point, you have to be able to hear (or at least imagine) the speech signal to make
a transcription.
Comment Transcription is actually an incredibly complex process, using a large number of
skills. In some ways, it is like spelling a new unknown word, in that you turn an
auditory signal into a set of symbols. However, unlike spelling a new word, for
transcription you must also know a special set of IPA symbols, and have
representations of the corresponding IPA sounds stored in your head. So, when
we transcribe spoken material, we must hear (and see) and attend to the signal.
When we transcribe from orthography, we can either say the word out loud, or
access a mental representation of it from our minds. In all cases, we must hold
the signal, in whole or in part, in our short-term memory, and try to divide it
into individual segments. Then, each of these segments must be matched to an
IPA sound, and the appropriate symbol accessed and written down.
Exercise 18.5 How important do you think transcription is for a phonetician? Can you get by
without it, and are there other things that are more important?
Comment It is important to have good skills in transcription, but just how important will
depend on what you want to use phonetics for. In many cases, the listening
aspects of phonetics will be more important than the notational aspects. For
example, you might not be able to remember that the diacritic for nasalisation is
[ ̃], but this is easily remedied by looking at an IPA chart, and is only a small
problem if you can hear that a sound is nasalised and know what this means in
terms of articulation. That said, however, if you want to specialise and excel in
phonetics, then transcription itself is a very important aspect of the ﬁeld. It is
SECTION THREE Putting words together
220

important, therefore, to be aware of the drawbacks of, and problems with,
different types of transcription, which we will now explore.
18.5 Potential problems with transcription
18.5.1 General
We have already alluded to some of the general problems with transcription.
One is that there is no single ‘right answer’, since any transcription will depend
on the interpretation of the transcriber. This is particularly the case for
impressionistic transcription, where the possible options are so numerous.
Another problem is that, when we transcribe, we assume that speech can be
broken up into segments. As we have said since the beginning of this book,
however, segments may only be a convenient notion that allows us to make
sense of a very complex continuous signal. Another possible problem is that
some features of speech are extremely difﬁcult to capture by the ear alone; these
might include minute differences in voice onset time or the position of the
velum. Acoustic measurements or articulatory techniques such as ultrasound
can be used to elucidate these aspects of speech, but without them the very ﬁne
details may not even be captured by the most skilled transcriber. However,
transcription, unlike these acoustic and articulatory techniques, has the added
bonus that it is done by a human using ears and brain alone, and these are the
very organs that are designed to process speech.
18.5.2 Allophonic
Many students ﬁnd allophonic transcription difﬁcult. They ﬁnd it hard to learn
and remember the large number of diacritics, and some may wonder why it is
even important, when most of the allophonic variation is predictable. If you are
to become an expert in speech, however, you really need to be able to hear and
understand aspects of it that are not obvious to an untrained person. Knowing
about allophonic variation reminds us that speech is continuous, and also trains
us to hear features such as aspiration and nasalisation, which any phonetician
needs to be aware of for those times when we transcribe less predictable
material. It is also worth noting here that allophonic transcriptions frequently
leave out a lot of articulatory detail, and even when we include all the variations
we have covered in earlier units, we will still not be recording everything about
the utterance we are transcribing.
18.5.3 Broad
One controversial issue regarding broad transcription is whether or not we
are really transcribing phonemes, which relates to the larger issue of
UNIT 18 Broad transcription
221

whether phonemes really exist at all. While the full extent of this debate is
somewhat outside the scope of this book, it is worth mentioning that
some theorists believe that phonemes have no real psychological reality. In
addition, there is a question, as we have already mentioned, about whether
the changes that occur in connected speech processes really involve
sounds changing into allophones of different phonemes. Those phoneticians
who favour a different view prefer to think of the sounds resulting from
assimilation, for example, as still remaining as allophones of the original
phoneme. In this book, we have taken a very traditional view, however, and
will therefore maintain the notion of change at the phonemic level.
However, if you want to go further in the ﬁeld, you may well want to
explore these issues in more detail, and can ﬁnd ideas for doing so in the
Resources section (page 278).
18.6 Broad transcription practice
In the next couple of exercises, we will recap a few of the basic principles in
broad transcription that were covered in earlier sections of the book.
Exercise 18.6 Transcribe the following words, being sure to avoid the tricky letters that are
never used as symbols in English broad transcription.
jay
Cox
icy
yacht
phoenix
cry
shy
quay
Comment The transcriptions are: /dʒeɪ/, /kɒks/, /aɪsi/, /jɒt/, /ﬁnɪks/, /kraɪ/, /ʃaɪ/ and /ki/.
Remember to keep practising your transcription. For example, you
might ﬁnd it useful to write your shopping lists and to-do lists in
transcription. New transcribers ﬁnd they quickly forget symbols if they do
not use them frequently. In particular, many novice transcribers struggle
to remember their vowel symbols. This is probably because there are
lots of them, and they often bear less relationship to spelling than the
consonant symbols. The following exercise is designed to help you practise
your vowel symbols.
Exercise 18.7 Each of the following sentences contains some of the less common vowels in
English. Transcribe each sentence, paying particular attention to the vowels, so
that they do not catch you out. Remember, however, to include CSPs wherever
they might occur.
They could hear a loud noise somewhere.
Look, that fair bird is near now.
The stern boy cares about the feared wolf.
The idea of bookworms is a rare joy.
The cow put her toy on the rear chair.

This is also a good opportunity to recap our knowledge of where CSPs can
occur in SSBE. While some occur in Exercise 18.7, the sentences in the next
exercise have been chosen especially to provide examples of weak forms and
CSPs, so you should expect to ﬁnd quite a few.

18.7 Summary
In this unit, we have recapped and consolidated our knowledge of different
types of transcription, and practised our broad transcription. We have inves-
tigated some advantages and disadvantages of each type, and seen for what
purposes they might be used.
18.8 Looking forward
In the next units, we will think more about the changing pitch of the voice,
which is called intonation.

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and
caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufﬁcient to
make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difﬁcult to
develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and
uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The
business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and
news.

One of Sherlock Holmes’s defects – if, indeed, one may call it a defect – was
that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person
until the instant of their fulﬁlment. Partly it came no doubt from his own
masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around
him. Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to
take any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who were
acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered under it, but never more
so than during that long drive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front
of us; at last we were about to make our ﬁnal effort, and yet Holmes had said
nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My
nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and
the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were
back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every turn of the
wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.

UNIT 19 INTONATION
19.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
* see how intonation relates to the changing pitch of the voice
* discover how we can transcribe intonation in different ways
* explore the form of SSBE intonation.
19.2 Introduction
In this unit, we will look at intonation, which refers to the changing pitch of the
voice as we speak. In some ways, intonation is like music or singing: ﬁrst,
because it involves changes in pitch, and, second, because the same vowels and
consonants can be produced with a variety of different pitches.
19.3 The production of intonation
Exercise 19.1 Take a single vowel, such as [ɑ]. Try to say/sing it on a very high pitch, and then
on a very low pitch. What aspects of your articulation do you think are
responsible for the change in pitch?
Comment You may remember that we brieﬂy summarised how different pitches are
produced in Unit 14, when we talked about speech variation. It is the voiced
segments of speech, such as our vowel [ɑ] in the exercise above, that carry
changes in pitch. When a sound is voiced, the vocal folds always vibrate, but
they vibrate at different speeds, depending on their size and stiffness. While
different people might have different-sized vocal folds (due to their sex or age),
speakers can also vary the length and stiffness of the folds by using muscles in
the larynx. This will alter the speed at which the folds vibrate; in turn, the speed
at which they vibrate determines the pitch of what we hear. Just as with all
vibrations, a high frequency of vibration causes us to hear a high pitch, and a
low frequency of vibration causes us to hear a low pitch. So, in the exercise
above, the high-pitched sound has quicker vocal fold vibration than the lower-
pitched sound. Notably, however, other aspects of its articulation do not change.
The tongue and lips are in the same position in each case, and, if they vary at all,
227

it is only to accommodate the slight changes in the position of the larynx which
might occur with very high and very low pitches.
In our example in Exercise 19.1, we changed pitch on a single sound. In
normal speech, we string these changes in pitch together over the course of an
utterance; these changes are known as intonation. Because different sounds and
words can be produced with different pitches, segments (vowels and conso-
nants) and intonation are thought of as being somewhat independent. Thus,
intonation is often described as being suprasegmental or autosegmental,
meaning above, or independent of, the segmental level.
Exercise 19.2 Try saying the word ‘arm’ on two different pitches, as you did for the vowel [ɑ]
in Exercise 19.1. Does the word mean something different at a high and low
pitch, or does it mean ‘arm’ in each case?
Comment The pitch of the word does not affect the meaning of the word at all. ‘arm’
means ‘arm’ whether it is said at a high pitch, a low pitch, somewhere in the
middle, or even with an elaborate pitch movement that rises and falls and rises
again. This is not the case in all languages, however. As we will see below, there
are many languages, called tone languages, which do make word-meaning
differences by using changes in pitch.
19.4 Tone languages
Many of the languages of Africa and Asia, as well as the indigenous languages of
North America, are tone languages. In these languages, the pitch on which a
word is produced can change its meaning. Here are two examples from Asian
languages, taken from the illustrations of these languages, in the IPA handbook,
a reference for which is given in the Resources section (page 278). (Note that I
am ignoring complicated notations of tone here, as there are quite a few
different systems in use, which are not important for our current purposes.)
Cantonese
Thai
/si/
/kʰa/
High tone
silk
to engage in trade
Mid tone
to try
to get stuck
Low tone
matter
galangal (a ginger-like root)
Exercise 19.3 Try producing the Cantonese and Thai words above, using the appropriate
tone.
Comment This exercise is a good test of your phonetic production skills, as you do not
have any lexical knowledge to rely on (unless you speak these languages, of
course). In fact, these same vowels and consonants (/si/ and /kha/) actually have
SECTION THREE Putting words together
228

even more different meanings in these languages which are distinguished by
pitch movements such as rises and falls, not exempliﬁed here.
19.5 Intonation
Up to this point, we have said that intonation relates to the changing pitch of the
voice, and that the pitch can be changed by changing the frequency of vibration
of the vocal folds. We have also seen that pitch does not change word meaning
in English, as it does in other languages. We will now brieﬂy investigate what
effects pitch does have in English, and will return to this in much greater detail
in Unit 20.
Exercise 19.4 Try producing a sentence using just one pitch. For example, try producing
‘Twinkle, twinkle, little star’ on a monotone. What does it sound like?
Comment To speak without using pitch variations sounds very unnatural, and possibly
artiﬁcial or robotic. Intonation adds a great deal to the naturalness of our
speech. If people lose the ability to use intonation – for example, if they have had
certain types of strokes or throat cancers – it can be very difﬁcult for them to
sound natural, and sometimes difﬁcult for them to be understood.
As we have learnt, in English and the vast majority of European languages,
pitch does not distinguish the meaning of individual words. It does make our
speech sound natural and coherent, however, and contributes to our under-
standing of the meaning of longer utterances (by signalling aspects such as
emotion and the difference between questions and statements), as we will see in
Unit 20. For now, we are going to concentrate on the form (rather than the
function) of intonation and the ways in which we might transcribe it.
19.6 Systems of intonation notation 1
Exercise 19.5 Thinking back over the rest of the book, have you seen anything that we could
use to transcribe the pitch of the voice? If not, or if you can not remember, what
might be a good system?
Comment In this book so far, we have concentrated on transcribing vowels and con-
sonants, and have not really suggested any system that might be useful for
pitch. There are, however, quite a few different ways of noting down the pitch
of the voice. The most intuitive system is rather like musical notation, and is
capable of giving quite a precise description of changing pitch. We will
work with this system for now, and think about other ways of notating
pitch later.
UNIT 19 Intonation
229

In the musical notation in Figure 19.1, there are notes for each syllable, and
different types of notes (minims and crotchets) for notes of different lengths.
Importantly, these notes are placed at different heights within the stave to
indicate their pitch. Notes at the bottom are low in pitch, while notes at the top
are high in pitch.
We can use a similar notation to describe intonation. Figure 19.2 shows an
interlinear diagram of one way in which a person might say (rather than sing
or play) the ﬁrst line of the same nursery rhyme. There are, in fact, many
different forms of intonation we could use when producing this sentence (and,
indeed, any other), a point that we will return to later on. Figure 19.2 represents
a fairly neutral way to say the sentence.
Note that the top line represents the highest normal pitch of the voice for
any particular speaker, and the bottom line represents the lowest. The difference
between the highest and lowest pitches can be called the pitch range.
Exercise 19.6 Compare the musical and the interlinear notations in Figure 19.2. What are the
similarities and differences between the two?
Comment Firstly, you see that in the interlinear diagram there is a dot for each syllable, in a
similar way to a note representing each syllable in the musical stave. The inter-
linear diagram also has different types of dots, although these differ merely by
size (rather than colour, as in the musical stave), with larger dots representing
stressed syllables and smaller ones representing unstressed syllables. There are
divisions in both the interlinear notation and the score, but these are different in
character: where there are four bars in the score, the interlinear diagram divides
into two sections. These sections are called intonation phrases, and boundaries
between them are notated using single (|) or double lines (||). These two
intonation phrases, coincidentally, have seven syllables each, due to the structure
of the poem, but they could have any number, as we will see shortly.

230

Finally, in our interlinear diagram we have two dots with tails, rather like
tadpoles (in fact, this type of representation is sometimes referred to informally
as a ‘tadpole’ diagram for this reason). These tails indicate a change in pitch on
a single syllable, which would be rather similar to a slur in music, none of which
are shown in the stave above.
19.7 Intonation phrases
In music, we know that a bar is well formed if it contains the right number of
beats. In common, or 4/4, time, all the bars must have four beats, which are
made up of notes and rests. In music, then, the basic unit is the bar, but in
intonation, the basic unit is the intonation phrase. The two separate
sections of ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little star’ in our interlinear diagram are both
intonation phrases. In an interlinear diagram we can divide intonation
phrases using straight lines, as shown in Figure 19.2. Double bars usually
occur at the end of an utterance, and indicate that there will be a deﬁnite
pause before any following material. Single lines may also be used to indicate
that the words in the ﬁrst phrase are closely related in grammatical terms to
the words in the second phrase. So, the next line of the nursery rhyme could
be produced as:
how I wonder | what you are?||
Here you see that we can also use the bars to indicate phrase breaks in
orthography.
As we will see in Unit 20, speakers also have a choice over how they divide
spoken material into intonation phrases, and may choose different patterns
according to the meanings they wish to convey. Importantly, an intonation
phrase can contain any number of syllables, so it is not constrained by size or
length in the same way as a musical bar. It does have to contain certain elements,
however, which we will now investigate. We are going to start by looking at
intonation phrases that contain only one syllable and examine the various
patterns that are possible.
Exercise 19.7 Consider the word ‘no’. How many different ways can you say it, by varying just
the pitch of your voice?
Comment You have probably thought of lots of different ways, including keeping the pitch
quite level or rising and falling in pitch. You may have had difﬁculty deciding
how to group and classify these different pitch changes, however, and therefore
may have had difﬁculty counting the different patterns you produced.
Speciﬁcally, you may have been uncertain as to which productions were sufﬁ-
ciently different to count as separate patterns.
UNIT 19 Intonation
231

19.7.1 Nuclear tones
In the British school of intonation, as applied to SSBE and related accents, there
are considered to be seven pitch patterns that can occur when there is only a
single syllable in an intonation phrase. So, although you may have produced
more than seven types in Exercise 19.7, some of these would be considered to be
versions of the same pattern, based on whether or not they seem to make a
substantial difference to meaning (we will look further at intonational meaning
in Unit 20). The basic seven patterns, called nuclear tones, are shown in
Figure 19.3.
High falls start towards the top of a speaker’s range and fall to the bottom.
Low falls are similar, except that they start from the middle of the range. Rise-
falls have a more complicated pattern. They start from a mid-pitch, rise almost
to the top of the range, and then fall to the bottom of the speaker’s range.
There is a similar distinction between the rises. High rises start at a mid-level
and rise to the top of the range, while low rises start low and rise to the middle of
the range. Fall-rises are more complicated, falling to the bottom of the range
before rising slightly again.
Finally, mid-level tones start in the middle of the range, and the pitch
continues on this level, with no appreciable movement.
Exercise 19.8 Try to produce the word ‘no’ using each of the different tones.
Consider if the different tones give different interpretations to the word ‘no’.
Comment For some speakers, it is rather difﬁcult to produce intonation to order like this. If
this is the case for you, try to begin by being able to produce high and low
pitches on cue, and then work up to producing the patterns above. You may
notice that the different tones give different interpretations to the word ‘no’.
The falls may sound more deﬁnite, and the rises more hesitant, or questioning,
for example. We will consider these different interpretations and the uses of
intonation in Unit 20.

19.7.2 Tails
Above, we have only looked at single-syllable intonation phrases, but there is a
multitude of different types of intonation phrase that contain more than a single
syllable. We will now try to build up several different types of intonation phrase,
considering the various intonation options for each one. We will begin with
two-syllable utterances, where the stress is on the ﬁrst syllable, such as in the
word ‘no one’.
Exercise 19.9 Compare the patterns on the two-syllable utterances in Figure 19.4 with the
patterns on one-syllable utterances in Figure 19.3.
What do you notice? (Remember that the large dots represent stressed
syllables and the smaller dots represent unstressed syllables.)
Comment You should notice that the basic pattern in the one syllable utterance now
spreads out over the two-syllable utterance. The stressed syllable where the
pitch movement starts is known as the nucleus, and we will return to this
deﬁnition shortly. Another part of the intonation phrase is the tail. The
syllable or syllables after the nucleus make up the tail. Note that ‘tail’
does not refer to the movement lines in the interlinear diagram (the tails of
the ‘tadpoles’), as these simply indicate where pitch moves on a single
syllable.
Exercise 19.10 What do you think these pitch patterns might look like if there were more
syllables in the tail. What would ‘nobody’ and ‘nobody can’ sound like when
produced with a high fall, for example? How would these look in an interlinear
diagram?
Comment As we have hinted at above, the pitch in the tail will continue with the same
pattern. So, for example, after high and low falls, the syllables in the tail stay
low and level, regardless of the number of syllables. After high and low rises,
the pitch in the tail keeps on rising, regardless of the number of syllables
that follow.

19.8 Stress and accent
Exercise 19.11 Look at ‘nobody can’ in the two interlinear diagrams above in Figure 19.5 .
What is different about the tail in this phrase in comparison to the other
tails?
Comment For ‘nobody can’, there is a stressed syllable in the tail (represented by a large
dot), which is different to the other tails we have looked at. However, it is
perfectly permissible to have a stressed syllable in the tail of an intonation
phrase.
At this point, we need to remind ourselves what we know about stress, and
then introduce a new term, ‘accent’.
Exercise 19.12 Remind yourself about some facts to do with stress by answering the following
questions.
a)
What are the characteristics of a stressed syllable?
b)
What are two types of stress dealing with words and connected speech,
respectively?
c)
Can we predict with certainty which syllables will be stressed in a new word
or in a sentence?
Comment a)
In Unit 8, we said that stressed syllables are longer and louder than
unstressed syllables.
b)
We looked at both lexical and rhythmic stress. We said that lexical stress
is the stress pattern a word has when it is pronounced in isolation,
whereas rhythmic stress refers to stress patterns within a stretch of
speech.

234

c)
In English, lexical stress can go on any syllable within a word, so, when we
learn a new English word, we have to learn its stress pattern too, unlike in
other languages, where stress might be ﬁxed on the ﬁrst or ﬁnal syllable, for
example. Likewise, in an utterance, it is not possible to say with certainty
which words will be stressed, but those that are will usually carry stress on
their lexically stressed syllable (except in cases such as stress shift).
In addition to stressed syllables being louder and longer, we also learnt in
Unit 8 that stressed syllables might be associated with pitch prominence. This is
what we will explore now, and it is this pitch movement that is relevant for the
distinction between ‘stress’ and ‘accent’. When we talk about intonation,
accents are stressed syllables that are also made prominent by pitch. So, accents
are always stressed syllables and are louder and longer than unstressed and
unaccented syllables. In addition, they have a pitch movement associated with
them, or are higher or lower in pitch than the syllables adjacent to them.
Exercise 19.13 Given the deﬁnition of ‘accent’ above, look back at the interlinear diagram for
the high fall pronunciation of ‘nobody can’ in Figure 19.5. For each syllable, say
whether it is stressed, unstressed or accented.
Comment ‘no’ is accented because it has a pitch movement within it. ‘bo’ and ‘dy’ are
unstressed and unaccented. While ‘bo’ has jumped down in pitch from the
syllable before it, we know it can not be accented because it is not stressed,
and just represents the end of the falling movement on ‘no’. ‘can’ is stressed, but
not accented, because it is not associated with a change in pitch, and will
simply be louder and longer than the unstressed syllables.
Exercise 19.14 Both the terms ‘accent’ and ‘nucleus’ are important for describing intonation.
You have seen them both before in this book. Do you think these terms mean
the same as they did in the previous units?
Comment You’ve heard the term ‘nucleus’ in relation to the compulsory part of the
syllable, and the term ‘accent’ in relation to regional and social variation. The
terms do not mean the same thing in this unit, as you will have noted from the
deﬁnitions we have given.
The term ‘nucleus’ in intonation, however, does have something in com-
mon with the ‘nucleus’ which refers to the centre of the syllable. If you
remember, the minimum syllable is just a nucleus, represented by a word like
‘eye’, for example. The nucleus in intonation, similarly, is the only compulsory
part of the intonation phrase. So, in our examples of ‘no’, above, we have an
intonation phrase consisting of just a nucleus, while in the latter examples we
have a nucleus plus a tail.
The nucleus, however, is more than simply the only compulsory part of the
intonation phrase. In fact, the nucleus is the ﬁnal accent within an intonation
phrase. So, if there is more than one accent in the phrase, the nucleus will be the
UNIT 19 Intonation
235

last one. We have seen that nuclear patterns spread out over the tail; therefore,
all intonation phrases, whatever their length, will end with one of our seven
patterns from above.
Exercise 19.15 We now know that an intonation phrase must contain a nucleus, which is the last
accented syllable, and can contain a tail if there are syllables occurring after the
nucleus. What else do we need to do to describe an entire intonation phrase?
Comment If you have been following so far, you will realise that we have only described
intonation phrases with a single accented syllable, which might be followed by
more unaccented syllables (the tail). We have not described what can happen
before the nucleus and will now do that by describing heads and pre-heads.
19.9 Heads
As we have said above, intonation phrases can contain more than one
accented syllable. When there are two or more accented syllables in an intonation
phrase, the ﬁrst accent marks the start of a unit called the head.
Exercise 19.16 Produce these ﬁlm titles in a fairly natural way and try to listen to your pitch as
you do so. First of all, work out where you put the nucleus (the ﬁnal accented
syllable), and then work out if you can hear any other accents within each title.
a)
A Fistful of Dollars
b)
For a Few Dollars More
Comment First of all, we should bear in mind that intonation can vary greatly, even when
the same sentence is produced by the same speaker. This is why we have used
these well-known ﬁlm titles, which people are more likely to produce in the
same way than less familiar phrases. However, even in these familiar items there
could be variation, a topic we will revisit in Unit 20. For now, we will assume
that all are spoken as a single intonation phrase, and I will give a plausible
intonation pattern for each phrase below.
a)
It is likely that the nucleus in on ‘do-’, and that it is a high or low fall. There
is also likely to be a jump up in pitch on ‘ﬁst’, so this syllable is also an
accent, and the start of the head. (See Figure 19.6.)
A
Fist-ful
of
Do-llars
Figure 19.6 A possible intonation pattern for ‘A ﬁstful of dollars’
SECTION THREE Putting words together
236

b)
The pattern is very similar, with the ﬁrst accent on ‘few’, which begins the
head, and a high fall nucleus on ‘more’. But now we have two syllables
before the ﬁrst accent, which we will investigate shortly, when we come to
pre-heads. (See Figure 19.7.)
In each case, the head starts from the ﬁrst accented syllable and comprises all
the syllables up to, but not including, the nucleus.
Exercise 19.17 Thinking back to the ﬁlm titles in Exercise 19.16, why do you think particular
words/syllables are accented?
Comment As we keep hinting, intonation is not entirely predictable. There are some
general rules, however, that do allow us to predict which patterns might be
used. Firstly, accents can only go onto stressed syllables. So when the word
‘dollars’ is stressed in the ﬁrst ﬁlm title, its ﬁrst, rather than its second, syllable
will be stressed, as this is the lexically stressed syllable. It will also attract the
accent.
You will also notice that accents tend to go onto content words rather than
function words, as these are usually more important for getting our message
across. Accents help to focus our attention on various parts of the sentence that
are most important for meaning, as we will see in Unit 20.
We have seen that the nucleus can have seven different tones associated with
it. The head can also have a variety of patterns. We will look at four basic types
here. They are low level, high level, falling and rising (see Figures 19.8, 19.9,
19.10 and 19.11, respectively).
Exercise 19.18 a)
Try to produce the various patterns shown in Figures 19.8 to 19.11.
b)
From what you can see so far, does the type of head determine the type of
nucleus?

UNIT 19 Intonation
237

Comment a)
Even if it is difﬁcult to produce these patterns, do persevere, and seek help
from a phonetics teacher if possible. Try to get the high and low accents
right ﬁrst, and then add in the others.
b)
If you compare the sentences for high-level and low-level heads, you will
see that they both combine with low-rise nuclear tones, demonstrating that
there is no one-to-one correspondence between the type of head and the
type of nucleus.
Heads and nuclei are rather separate entities, but some authors describe
particular restrictions in the way they can combine, such as low heads
occurring most commonly with low rises, falling heads with fall-rises, and
rising heads with high falls. The high head frequently occurs with many
different types of nuclear tone. We will not investigate this further here, but
you might like to listen out for the various head + nucleus pairings that can
be heard.
19.10 Pre-heads
We now come to the ﬁnal part of the intonation phrase in our discussion, which
is actually the very ﬁrst part of an intonation phrase to be produced, because it
When can we go to the pictures?
Figure 19.9 An example of a high-level head
Surely we mustn’t do that.
Figure 19.10 An example of a falling head

Figure 19.11 An example of a rising head
SECTION THREE Putting words together
238

occurs (optionally) at the start of an utterance. The pre-head is deﬁned as any
unstressed syllables that occur before the head, as we saw in our ﬁlm titles
above. In the vast majority of cases, the pre-head is low in pitch, and lower
than – or on the same level as – the syllables at the start of the head. Such
pre-heads are called low pre-heads.
Occasionally, a high pre-head occurs, which is above the pitch level of the
ﬁrst accent (or on the same level as the start of a high fall). These are much rarer
than low pre-heads, however, and are generally associated with emphasis or
liveliness on the part of the speaker.
Exercise 19.19 Look back at the sentences above which demonstrate the different types of head,
in Figures 19.8 to 19.11. Try to produce each sentence with a pre-head by
putting the word ‘but’ in front of it. Try this ﬁrst with a low pre-head, and then,
if you can manage that easily, with a high pre-head.
Comment Hopefully, you found that the low pre-head sounded more neutral in each case.
In the interlinear diagrams in Figure 19.12, low pre-heads are shown with the
usual ﬁlled circle. High pre-heads are at a level around that of the start of a high
fall, and towards the top of the speaker’s pitch range. These are illustrated here

with an open circle, but this is only so the two types of pre-head can be
compared. Usually they are shown with a ﬁlled circle, just as for all other
syllables.
19.11 Complete intonation patterns
As we said earlier, intonation phrases only need to have a nucleus,
meaning that all the other parts are optional. So, a nucleus can come in
combination with some, any or none of the other parts, such as pre-head, head
and tail.
Exercise 19.20 In the diagrams in Figure 19.13, see if you can work out which units of
intonation are present, and what the pitch pattern is in the nucleus and any
other constituents.
Comment In (a) there is no pre-head, a rising head, a high fall nucleus and two syllables
in the tail. In (b) there is a low pre-head, a high rise nucleus, and one syllable in
the tail. In (c) there is just a rise-fall nucleus; none of the other elements are
present.

b)
c)
Figure 19.13 Interlinear diagrams for interpretation
SECTION THREE Putting words together
240

Comment One advantage is that the system is closely linked to our perception, so it
is not arbitrary and takes almost no time to learn. It may be difﬁcult for some
people to hear rises and falls, but this is not inherent to the system of tran-
scription, and once you can hear them it is easy to notate them. One disad-
vantage is that it is rather hard to combine interlinear diagrams with
transcription of segments, as you have to do two separate tasks: an IPA tran-
scription of the vowels and consonants, and a separate transcription of pitch.
Something that may be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your
point of view, is that the transcription has the potential to be very detailed. You
can show tiny differences in pitch (as long as you can hear them), even if these
do not make a contribution towards meaning. Note that the two systems
described below disregard some of this detail and give a broader transcription,
aimed primarily at capturing different meanings or interpretations rather than
minute details.
19.12.1 In-text notation
Many phoneticians use the same system of analysis as that described above
(comprising nuclear tones, heads, and so on), but use a system of distinct
symbols to mark up the nucleus and other accents on an orthographic or
phonetic transcription, instead of showing pitch movement in an interlinear
diagram. This system is quite detailed in full, with separate marks for different
types of heads and to indicate the difference between stressed and accented
syllables. Here, I simply give the symbols for the different type of nuclear
tones. The nucleus can also be indicated by underlining the appropriate
syllable.
High rise:́ no
Low rise:
̗no
Fall-rise: ̌ no
High fall ̀ no
Low fall
̖no
Rise-fall
̂ no
Mid level ˃no
Exercise 19.22 Can you see why these symbols were chosen to represent these tones? Do you
think they are easy to remember and interpret?
Comment The direction of the pitch movement is indicated by the shape of the symbol,
reading from left to right. The starting height of the pitch movement is shown
by the symbol’s position in relation to the word – that is, high or low in the line
of text. In this way, the symbols are quite easy to remember and interpret, and
this system is quite useful and popular, as it captures some of the iconic nature
UNIT 19 Intonation
241

of the pitch movements, while combining the system with an orthographic or
phonetic transcription. Note that this system does not show high and low
versions of fall-rises, rise-falls and levels, because there are not considered to be
appreciable differences in meaning between high and low realisations of these
tones in English.
19.12.2 Highs and lows
While the seven nuclear tones model described above has been very inﬂuential
in Britain, many teachers in North America use a different system, which is
based on pitch levels, and is referred to as the autosegmental metrical (AM)
model. This system has also come to dominate research into intonation in many
different languages.
This system uses ‘high’ and ‘low’, as basic categories to indicate pitch
levels at particular moments in time, rather than ‘rises’ and ‘falls’. What follows
is a very brief and simpliﬁed introduction to this system.
Exercise 19.23 How would you describe a fall in terms of high and low pitch levels? What about
a rise?
Comment A fall can be thought of as a high level followed by a low level, and a rise as a low
level followed by a high level, as shown in Figure 19.14. When we want to
describe a rise or fall, therefore, we can use the letters H (for high) and L (for
low), in various combinations. So, we can use HL for a fall, and LH for a rise.
Exercise 19.24 How might you indicate a fall-rise or a rise-fall?
Comment We can simply add another letter to our label, to show that there is another
important pitch level: HLH is a fall-rise and a rise-fall is LHL.
Exercise 19.25 How do you think you might indicate the difference between a high rise and a
low rise?
Comment As a high rise starts high, it can be notated as HH; a low rise will be LH,
indicating that is starts low and then rises.
Exercise 19.26 Can you think of any advantages or disadvantages of this system, compared to a
system of rises and falls?

Comment The system is very powerful for describing the phonetics and phonology of
intonation in English and other languages. It uses a simple set of two labels to
describe all accents, including the four types of head, and seven types of nuclear
tone in the British tradition. For some people, however, the system of high and
low levels and the non-iconic symbols used are off-putting.
You may like to read more about the AM system of intonation by looking at
the suggestions in the Resources section (page 278). In this book we will
continue to use the seven nuclear tones from the British tradition, as they are
still more commonly taught in the UK, are perhaps a little more intuitive,
and more is written about them in terms of how they help to convey meaning,
which is the focus of Unit 20.
19.13 Summary
In this unit, we have looked at the form of intonation in English and how we can
describe the component parts of intonation and the options within those parts.
We have seen that intonation phrases must contain a nucleus, and, optionally, a
pre-head, head and tail. We have described seven options for nuclear tones and
tails, four different types of head, and two types of pre-head. We have also
looked brieﬂy at AM forms of notation.
19.14 Looking forward
In the next unit, we will look at how we can change the meaning and inter-
pretation of utterances by varying the length of the intonation phrase, the
position and type of the nuclear tone, and the overall pitch of the voice.

UNIT 20 FUNCTIONS OF INTONATION
20.1 Key learning areas
In this unit we will:
* identify how various features of intonation can contribute to the meaning
or interpretation of an utterance
* learn how intonation can affect meanings related to focus, attitude, grammar
and discourse.
20.2 Introduction
In the previous unit, we have seen various ways to describe intonation. In this
unit, we will look at how intonation functions and how it can affect the meaning
of an utterance.
20.3 Recap about intonational meaning
Exercise 20.1 What have we already said about the meaning of tone and intonation in
Unit 19? Can the pitch of the voice change the meaning of individual words?
Comment In Unit 19, we decided that pitch does not affect the meaning of individual
words in English. Saying any particular word with a rise, fall or fall-rise, for
example, does not affect the meaning of that word. Therefore, ‘dog’ still means
‘dog’, regardless of the pitch on which it is produced. In tone languages,
however, pitch can and does change the meaning of individual words, just as
changing a vowel or consonant can do so in English.
20.4 Intonational meaning in English
Having established that intonation does not affect the meanings of indi-
vidual words, we must now turn to the effect of intonation on longer
stretches of speech. Here we will ﬁnd that intonation does indeed inﬂuence
meaning.
245

Exercise 20.2 Using what you learnt in Unit 19, imagine how the following words could be
spoken with a variety of intonation patterns. Think about which aspects of
intonation you might vary and the different meanings that are then created.
Note that the material does not have any punctuation and is not necessarily
spoken as a single intonation phrase or by a single individual.
I’ll get the shopping tonight
Comment No doubt you have come up with many different ways in which the sentence
might be produced. You may have chosen to break it into two intonation
phrases, for example, with the ﬁrst four words spoken by one person and
‘tonight’ by another person. You can also vary the position of the nucleus (and
other accents), depending on which words you want to make important; and
you can vary the nuclear tone to any one of the seven we discussed in Unit 19.
Or, you might have used a very wide or narrow pitch range. All of these
alterations will have some effect on the intended and perceived meanings of the
utterance. We will now take each type of change in turn and think about each
one in a bit more detail.
In what follows we will look at four different ways in which intonation might
contribute to the perceived meaning of an utterance. These concern (a) how the
speaker breaks their speech into intonation phrases, (b) the choice of accent
position, (c) the choice of nuclear tone and (d) the choice of key or register. For
each of these, we will look at the default, or neutral, pattern, and at how
alternative meanings are created by using patterns other than the default.
In particular, the meanings we will consider are of four main types (although
many subdivisions and extra meanings are possible).
*
Focus – here we can change meanings by altering what is emphasised in a
sentence.
*
Attitude – here we can signal our attitude to the utterance or to the listener,
or we can signal our emotional state.
*
Grammar – here we can use intonation to mark out particular structures,
and to indicate different types of utterance, such as statements and questions.
*
Discourse – here we use intonation to show where we are in our talk, such
as whether we are planning to carry on speaking or are ready to let someone
else speak.
20.5 Intonation phrases
As we saw in Unit 19, the basic unit of intonation is the intonation phrase,
which must have a nucleus and can optionally contain a pre-head, head and tail.
The material in an intonation phrase may relate quite closely to what comes
next, in which case it is demarcated in notation with a single bar (|), or it may be
SECTION THREE Putting words together
246

less closely related, and concluded with a pause, which is indicated by a double
bar (||). One of the decisions that we make (largely unconsciously) when we talk
is how to divide what we want to say into intonation phrases.
The default, or most neutral situation, is for there to be a single unit of
information per intonation phrase. So, the most neutral version of our sentence
above might be:
A:
I’ll get the shopping ||
B:
Tonight? ||
where the dialogue is shared between two speakers and each intonation phrase
contains one unit of meaning.
Alternatively, another neutral version, spoken by a single speaker might be:
A:
I’ll get the shopping tonight ||
where all the information is put together into one intonation phrase.
Other, less neutral, versions are also possible, as we will now explore.
Exercise 20.3 What meaning would you attribute to the same sentence spoken as follows by a
single speaker? (Remember that the bars illustrate intonation phrase breaks and
the marks illustrate the nuclear tones, as shown in Unit 19.)
ˏI’ll | get the ˏshopping | toˋnight ||
Comment Here, the single sentence is broken up into three intonation phrases. Combined
with the position of the nuclei and the choice of nuclear tones, this may have the
effect of sounding rather pedantic and deﬁnite. You could imagine, for example,
that it might be said at the end of a somewhat heated conversation about whose
turn it is to do the weekly shop. So here, the division into intonation phrases (as
well as other aspects of the intonation) has an attitudinal function, as it shows
how the speaker is feeling.
Exercise 20.4 Look at the following sentences. They are both written without any punctua-
tion. Can you ﬁnd two different meanings for each and decide how intonation
boundaries might help us decide between the alternatives when they are spoken
out loud?
a)
The dogs who had bones were content
b)
There was chocolate and coffee cake
Tip Try adding commas to create the different meanings.
Comment a)
The ﬁrst sentence might mean that all the dogs had bones and were
therefore content, as follows:
The dogs | who had bones | were content ||
UNIT 20 Functions of intonation
247

Or the sentence could mean that only some of them had bones, but the
ones that did were content.
The dogs who had bones were content ||
Put the nucleus on ‘had’ if you need help imagining how this might
sound. (Note that for some speakers this option cannot work, as ‘dogs’
should be referred to with the impersonal pronoun ‘that’ rather than ‘who’.)
b)
Turning to the second sentence, this might mean that there were blocks of
chocolate, as well as some cake ﬂavoured with coffee:
There was chocolate | and coffee cake||
Or the sentence could mean that there was cake ﬂavoured with both
chocolate and coffee:
There was chocolate and coffee cake||
In each of these utterances, the intonation breaks help us to decide which
units of information belong together. In (a) the presence of a boundary after
‘dogs’ sets apart the relative clause, almost as though it were in brackets. In (b)
the break after chocolate tells us that, semantically, the chocolate and coffee
relate to different objects, and that, syntactically, they belong to different noun
phrases.
These decisions relating to intonation phrases relate largely to the gram-
matical function of intonation, as they help us to decide which parts of the
utterance belong together.
20.6 Accent position
Another important feature of intonation for meaning is the position of the
accents in the intonation phrase, chieﬂy the location of the nucleus. As you
may remember from Unit 19, the nucleus can in fact go onto any syllable in
the phrase, although some positions are more likely and more common
than others.
Exercise 20.5 If our sentence is spoken as a single intonation phrase, where do you think the
nucleus is most likely to go in a very neutral production?
I’ll get the shopping tonight.
Comment A very neutral production might well be
I’ll get the shopping tonight.
where the nucleus falls on the ﬁnal syllable.
SECTION THREE Putting words together
248

Exercise 20.6 Try the following sentences by reading them in a neutral fashion. Where do you
think the nucleus is most likely to fall in each case? Can you spot a general
pattern?
a)
He doesn’t really care for it.
b)
Can you feed the animals?
c)
Can you feed the giraffe?
d)
She needs to water the plants.
e)
He forgot the spider plant.
f)
What about the spider?
Comment It is likely that you placed the nucleus as follows:
a)
He doesn’t really care for it.
b)
Can you feed the animals?
c)
Can you feed the giraffe?
d)
She needs to water the plants.
e)
He forgot the spider plant.
f)
What about the spider?
When the production is neutral, the nucleus is most likely to fall on the
lexically stressed syllable of the ﬁnal content word. Note that in (a) ‘for’ and ‘it’
are both function words and ‘care’ is the last content word. In both (b) and (c),
the ﬁnal word is a content word and carries the nucleus, but in (b) the nucleus is
not on the ﬁnal syllable, because ‘animals’ is lexically stressed on the ﬁrst
syllable. In (e) the nucleus goes on the ﬁrst syllable of ‘spider’, just as in (f). This
may seem odd, and perhaps you would expect the pattern to resemble that in
(d), with the nucleus on ‘plant’. However, ‘spider plant’ is a compound (made
up of two other words) and treated very much as a single lexical item; con-
sequently, the nucleus (and the lexical stress) occurs on the ﬁrst syllable. This
works for other compounds, too, like ‘peace-lily’ and ‘blackbird’.
By some estimates, around 80 per cent of intonation phrases have their
nucleus on the stressed syllable of the ﬁnal content word. It is possible, however,
to change the position of the nucleus from this neutral or default setting in order
to affect meaning.
Exercise 20.7 Try to produce our earlier example sentence with a nucleus in each of the
underlined positions. Try to keep the same nuclear tone (such as a high fall) in
each case. What different meanings do you create? Also, try to think of an
appropriate context for each version of the sentence.
a)
I’ll get the shopping tonight
b)
I’ll get the shopping tonight
c)
I’ll get the shopping tonight
d)
I’ll get the shopping tonight
UNIT 20 Functions of intonation
249

Comment Putting the nucleus on a syllable other than the default draws our attention to
that syllable and suggests it is important. For example, (b) might mean that the
speaker will get the shopping, while the listener should get something else, like
the dry-cleaning. Likewise, (d) might mean that the speaker is insisting that he or
she, rather than the listener, will pick up the shopping. Note, here, that the
nucleus can be as early as the ﬁrst syllable in the phrase, if that is what the speaker
wishes to highlight. The remainder of the intonation phrase will then comprise
the tail. (c) is harder to account for, as ‘get’ is quite an unusual place for the
nucleus. However, it might be said in irritation, or in contrast to ‘not get’. (a) is
our default pattern, but, depending on the tone, it may also be said contrastively,
to indicate ‘tonight’, as opposed to ‘tomorrow’ or ‘on Saturday’, for example.
The main function associated with the position of the nucleus, then, is focus.
A nucleus in the default position is said to give the intonation phrase broad
focus, focussing our attention on the entire phrase. However, we may also move
the nucleus to another syllable, which will then become the focus of the
listener’s attention, a situation called narrow focus. We may choose to focus on
words or syllables because they are new to the discussion. We also unfocus
information that has already been mentioned or implied (which is sometimes
called given information). This is achieved by not accenting given information,
a process called deaccenting. For example, the response in (d) in Exercise 20.7
might come about if the previous utterance has been, ‘I don’t think I’ll have
time to get the shopping tonight’, in which ‘shopping’ and ‘tonight’ are both
explicitly mentioned. Alternatively, it may be a response to ‘I don’t think I’ll
have time to go to the supermarket after work’. In this case, ‘shopping’ and
‘tonight’ have only been implied, but nevertheless are deaccented in the
response. In fact, it sounds rather odd to put the nucleus on items that have
recently been mentioned, as we will now investigate.
Exercise 20.8 Try to produce the following sentences in response to the prompt, ‘I don’t think
I can get the shopping tonight’.
Which sounds natural and which sounds decidedly odd?
a)
I’ll get the shopping tonight.
b)
I’ll get the shopping tonight.
c)
I’ll get the shopping tonight.
Comment You will probably ﬁnd that only (a) is really acceptable. In English (and in many
Germanic languages), it sounds odd to assign the nucleus to items that have
already been mentioned or implied. This is not the case in all languages,
however. In many Romance languages, for example, the nucleus cannot move
around so freely; therefore, given information can readily be accented. In such
languages, focus can be placed on new information by changing the word order
of the utterance.
SECTION THREE Putting words together
250

As mentioned above, the position of accents other than the nucleus can also
affect meaning. As we already know, the head starts with the ﬁrst accent, and the
position of this accent, along with the position of the nucleus, can add to the
meaning that is understood.
Exercise 20.9 Imagine our earlier sentence with the nucleus on ‘night’, as in our neutral
version. What would be the difference in meaning between the head beginning
on ‘I’ll’, and the head beginning on ‘get’ with a pre-head on ‘I’ll’?
Comment Similarly to the effect of the location of the nucleus, the location of the other
accents also focusses our attention on the words with which they are associated.
Interlinear diagrams are shown in Figure 20.1. So, a head starting on ‘I’ll’ or
‘get’ will focus our attention on these items, but usually less strongly than the
focussing effect of the nucleus.
So, the position of the nucleus and other accents relates largely to the
focussing effect of intonation, and draws the listener’s attention to those parts of
the utterance that the speaker wishes to highlight.
20.7 Nuclear tone
The choice of nuclear tone is perhaps the aspect of intonation that most
obviously affects meaning for non-experts, even if they do not have the termi-
nology to describe what they have heard.
Exercise 20.10 Again, think about our original sentence, with the nucleus in the default
position on ‘night’.
a)
How would it sound with different types of fall, such as a low fall or a
rise-fall?
b)
How would it sound with a rise?
c)
Can you identify different meanings for these tones?
Comment (a), (b) and (c) The falling tones may sound like statements, and also as
though the speaker is being deﬁnite, while the rising tones may sound like
questions or suggestions, or as if the speaker is unsure. In fact, the division
between rise and fall is one of the most basic ones in intonation analysis.
I’ll   get the shopping tonight
I’ll get the shopping tonight
Figure 20.1 Interlinear diagrams for ‘I’ll get the shopping tonight’, with the head starting on ‘I’ll’ (left) and ‘get’
(right)
UNIT 20 Functions of intonation
251

However, the common belief that questions ‘go up’ in pitch and statements
‘go down’, while being quite useful, is not entirely accurate, as this depends on
the type of question being asked (and also the variety of English a person
speaks), a topic we will now investigate.
Exercise 20.11 Imagine the following questions spoken with the nucleus on the ﬁrst syllable of
‘pasta’. Do they both sound right with a rising tone, or is one more neutral and
natural with a fall?
a)
Do you want the pasta?
b)
When do you want the pasta?
Comment Hopefully, it is clear that (a) sounds more neutral with some sort of rise, while
(b) sounds more neutral with a falling tone. Therefore, we must make a
distinction between yes-no questions, like (a), where only a yes or no answer is
needed, and wh-questions, like (b), where a fuller response is required. Yes-no
questions frequently have rising nuclei, while wh-questions frequently have
falling nuclei. This is especially the case when there is nothing in the choice of
words to signal whether the speech is a question or a statement. Imagine, for
example, how the word ‘pasta’ would be pronounced on its own, in order to ask
a person if they would like some.
It is difﬁcult to state what default or neutral tones are, and to do so we at
least need to know the type of material that is being produced (question,
statement, command, and so on). While it is rather difﬁcult to generalise the
meaning of different tones, we can basically say that the default tones for yes-no
questions are rising nuclei, while wh-questions, statements, exclamations and
commands usually have falling nuclei. This aspect of tone variation relates to
the grammatical function of intonation. We will see later that different types of
rises and falls can also affect meaning.
In addition, when we are considering a dialogue, or when there is more
than one intonation phrase in an utterance, the tone of the nucleus may also
have a discourse function, as we will see in Exercise 20.12.
Exercise 20.12 Imagine the following sentence spoken in two different ways, as shown below.
What meaning do you think is implied by each one?
a)
You can do ˏlanguages | or ˏliterature
b)
You can do ˏlanguages | or ˋliterature
Comment In (a) the rising tone on ‘literature’ seems to suggest that there are more options
to come, like ‘humanities’, for example, whereas the fall in (b) suggests that the
speaker is ﬁnished and that these are the only two options available.
Exercise 20.13 Imagine our ‘shopping’ sentence spoken as a single intonation phrase, with a
rise on ‘tonight’.
SECTION THREE Putting words together
252

I’ll get the shopping tonight
Does the rise suggest that there might be more to come, or that the speaker is
ﬁnished?
Do the same exercise with a fall on ‘tonight’.
Comment The rise is more likely to suggest that the speaker will carry on, and perhaps say,
‘and then I’ll go to the pub’ or ‘and then I’ll have time to go out tomorrow’.
Similarly, the mid-level tone, which we have not yet discussed, also carries an
indication that the speaker has not yet ﬁnished and is preparing to produce
another intonation phrase. Conversely, the fall may mean that the speaker has
ﬁnished and is ready for the other person to speak. This type of usage is related
to the discourse function of intonation.
So far, we have seen that the choice of nuclear tone can have a grammatical
and a discourse function. The choice of tone is also largely responsible for how
we signal our emotions and attitudes.
Exercise 20.14 Imagine our ‘shopping’ sentence spoken with the following falling tones on
‘tonight’. What do you think they tell the listener about the speaker’s emotions
and attitudes?
a)
I’ll get the shopping toˋnight.
b)
I’ll get the shopping toˎnight.
c)
I’ll get the shopping to˄night.
Comment All the falling tones in (a), (b) and (c) are likely to indicate some sort of
statement or declaration, as we discussed above, and this choice of a fall over a
rise is a grammatical use of tone. However, the choice of the type of fall may tell
us about how the speaker feels in general (that is, his or her emotional state), or
how the speaker feels about the words spoken, or how the speaker feels about
the listener (his or her attitude towards this person). The difference between a
high fall (a) and a low fall (b) often tells us about the degree of enthusiasm the
speaker feels, with a high fall sounding enthusiastic, and a low fall sounding
bored or disengaged. The rise-fall (c) has a more marked or unusual meaning,
and is often associated with the speaker either being impressed or challenging
something. These two potential meanings for the same tone illustrate the lack of
a one-to-one relationship between intonation and meaning. Used with the
sentence in the exercise, a rise-fall might mean that the speaker is being self-
congratulatory, or that he or she is being somewhat obstinate with the listener.
Exercise 20.15 Now try Exercise 20.14 again, but this time with the rises. What do the different
tones tell you about the emotions and attitudes of the speaker?
a)
I’ll get the shopping to ˊnight.
b)
I’ll get the shopping toˏnight.
c)
I’ll get the shopping to˅night.
UNIT 20 Functions of intonation
253

Comment Here, the choice of any of the rises in (a), (b) and (c) perhaps suggests some
kind of uncertainty or questioning, as opposed to the falls, which, as we have
seen, are more deﬁnite and associated with statements. The choice of a partic-
ular rise, however, may indicate the speaker’s emotion or attitude to what they
are saying. Similarly to what we said about falling tones, the differences between
the high (a) and low (b) versions of rising tones may reﬂect the speaker’s
interest or involvement, with the low rise sounding less engaged than the
high rise. So, the choice of tone may also have an attitudinal function. The
fall-rise (c) often has a special meaning, which might be that of reserve, or
leaving something unsaid. Here, for example, the speaker might be avoiding
saying ‘but actually I was hoping to just stay in and watch TV’ or ‘but I’m really
hoping you’ll get it next week’. Hearing this tone will often lead the listener
to ask about what is being unsaid. For example, some people would say, ‘I can
hear there’s a but coming’, in response to a sentence with a fall-rise nucleus.
In addition, mid-level tones may also indicate that more is to come and that
a further intonation phrase will follow.
We have seen that the choice of nuclear tone may signal a number of
different meanings. Fans of The Wire may remember the scene from ‘Old
Cases’ in season one, where Bunk and McNulty try to recreate the events
surrounding an old murder. The scene consists of multiple repetitions of the
same one-syllable swear-word, produced with a variety of nuclear tones. This
single word is manipulated so that, along with their gestures (and other aspects,
such as speed of delivery and loudness), the viewers can follow their train of
thought and understand the feelings they express.
20.8 Key and register
Another feature of intonation that we have not really considered so far is the key
of the voice. Key refers to the pitch range of a particular intonation phrase.
Changes in key normally involve a difference in the upper part of the pitch
range, while the lower end of the scale stays at the same level as in a default key.
So, in a high key, the high accents are higher, while syllables produced on a
low pitch are at their normal level, as shown in Figure 20.2. You will remember
from the previous unit that the lines represent the top and bottom of the
pitch range.

SECTION THREE Putting words together
254

Exercise 20.16 Think back to one of the sentences we looked at in Exercise 20.4: ‘The dogs
who had bones were content’. There we said that one possible way of chunking
this sentence was to divide it into three intonation phrases, as if the ‘who had
bones’ part was in brackets, as follows:
The dogs | who had bones | were content ||
Try saying this sentence chunked in this way. Can you hear any difference
between the key you use in the different intonation phrases?
Comment You may have noted that the middle intonation phrase sounds quite natural
if it is produced using a lower key than the intonation phrases on either side.
One main use of low key is to signal that some section of the spoken material is
offset, or separate, from the main utterance. Similarly, when you listen to
adverts on the radio, the ‘terms and conditions’ part at the end is often in a
low key (and spoken quickly and quietly) compared to the main body of the
advert. This use of low key, then, is a discourse function of intonation.
Another main use of changes in key is to be found in TV and radio news
reports.
Exercise 20.17 The following text is based on a extract from a spoken round-up of the news
headlines from the BBC. Imagine how the entire extract might be spoken by a
newsreader. What use might be made of changes in key?
Unemployment’s risen again | with nearly two and a half million people
out of work | in the three months to December || The number of sixteen-to
twenty-four-year-olds looking for work | rose to nine hundred and sixty
ﬁve thousand ||
The bank of England | has downgraded its growth forecast for the UK |
and hinted at an interest rise in May || It says the rate of inﬂation | will
probably reach almost ﬁve percent | before falling to the target of two
percent | in 2012 ||
Prince William | and Kate Middleton | will make their ﬁrst ofﬁcial overseas
trip | as a married couple | to Canada || According to ofﬁcials there | they’ll
travel around the country | for around two weeks | in the summer ||
Comment You may have noted that the intonation phrases at the start of new topics will be
in a higher key than those at the end of topics. There is a general tendency in
many languages for pitch to drift down, both within an intonation phrase
and across intonation phrases within a single topic (declination). So, an
intonation phrase in a high key might signal to the listener that the speaker has
changed topics, which, again, is a discourse feature of intonation. This use of
key is very clear in most spoken news reports: try to spot it the next time you
are watching TV or listening to the radio
UNIT 20 Functions of intonation
255

Exercise 20.18 Look at the following extract from the Friends episode ‘The One Where
Underdog Gets Away’ (season one, episode 9). The group have just returned
from the roof, where they were watching an escaped balloon, but have
found themselves locked out of Monica’s apartment, where Thanksgiving
dinner is burning in the oven. They start to argue about whose responsibility
it was to remember the key to the door.
MONICA: Isn’t it enough that I’m making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone?
You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I’m making
different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and
onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it’s my ﬁrst Thanksgiving, and it’s all
burned, and, and I. . . I. . .
CHANDLER: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now
a)
How might Monica’s pitch sound, given that she is starting to cry and is
very upset?
b)
What does Chandler mean by his comment?
Comment It would be useful to see if you can locate a copy of this clip, especially as we will
consider another from the same episode in the review exercises.
a)
Monica’s pitch becomes higher and squeakier as she gets more and more
upset. In fact, it is not just the top of her pitch range that rises, but also
the bottom of her pitch range. When both the top and the bottom of the
pitch range change, we say that this is a change in register (rather than a
change in key, where only the top of the range changes). A high register,
such as the one Monica uses here, tends to be associated with extreme
emotion or stress, and is thus an attitudinal function of intonation.
b)
Chandler’s comment implies that Monica’s speech is now so high in pitch
that it is outside the range of human perception. Dogs can generally hear
much higher pitches than humans, which is why they can hear dog
whistles, and humans generally can not.
20.9 Multiple meanings
As you will have realised from the discussions above, there is no single meaning
for any particular tone, or for any particular nucleus placement, or for any
particular way of chunking a sentence into intonation phrases, or even for any
particular key. Even if we just consider a rising nuclear tone, this may mean that
the speaker is uncertain (a matter of attitude), or is asking a question (a matter
or grammar), or is about to say more (a matter of discourse).
SECTION THREE Putting words together
256

Exercise 20.19 How do you think a listener tells the difference between all of these possible
meanings?
Comment Some of the meaning of intonation is related to the form of words that are used,
so the form of the words and the intonation must operate together to produce a
meaning. For example, changing our utterance slightly to ‘shall I get the
shopping tonight’ would tell us deﬁnitively that this was a yes-no question.
However, if a speaker starts a topic with ‘if I get the shopping tonight’, this
strongly indicates that they are going to add something else, regardless of their
intonation. Thus, intonation cannot stand on its own to create meaning, but
must also be interpreted in the light of the words and structure of the sentence,
and the ongoing events.
In this unit, we have only talked about a few ways in which intonation might
contribute to meaning. We have not considered the effect of different types of
head and pre-head, or considered how factors such as speed, tempo, voice
quality and a whole host of other considerations might interact with intonation
to inﬂuence perceived meaning and help a listener to understand what is
intended. The way in which intonation contributes to meaning is very rich, but
is still not fully understood scientiﬁcally, even though speakers and listeners do
it every day, usually with no problems.
20.10 Variation and change in intonation
So far, we have described intonation very much as though it is a single, ﬁxed
system. However, this is far from being the case. In fact, what we have described
is only a small part of the intonation of Standard Southern British English. Just
as for vowels and consonants, there is a considerable amount of variation in
intonation, which can be attributed to a person’s regional accent, sex and age,
and/or the style in which they are speaking.
Exercise 20.20 Think of some other regional accents that you know well. Can you think of any
particular features of their intonation which differ from those described here, or
from the intonation you use yourself?
Comment Often, one of the most striking differences between accents is their intonation,
even if we are not always able to put our ﬁnger on exactly what those
differences are. One of the differences that attracts rather a lot of attention,
however, is the more frequent use of rising tones in some accents, such as
Australian, Welsh and some northern varieties of English. Similarly to variation
in segments across accents (recall our discussion of the differences between
regional accents in Unit 14), intonation can vary in different ways. For example,
UNIT 20 Functions of intonation
257

accents may have the same meaningful tones, but realise them differently (for
example, by starting at a higher or lower pitch), or may use different basic
nuclear tones. However, it is rather difﬁcult to compare different systems of
intonation, largely due to the lack of a one-to-one relationship between into-
nation and meaning.
Exercise 20.21 What do you consider to be the main differences between intonation in male
and female speakers?
Comment As we discussed in Unit 14, women’s voices are more highly pitched than
men’s, and this is largely due to the fact that the vocal folds are smaller and
lighter in women. As we have seen, however, it is possible for all of us to vary the
pitch at which we speak within the range that is physically determined by the
size of our vocal folds. It has been observed that in some languages and cultures,
there is a greater difference between the pitch of male and female voices than in
others. These differences between languages are not related to biology, but
rather to cultural norms, with women speaking in a higher register, possibly in
order to sound feminine, and males in a lower register, possibly to sound more
masculine. Thus, the natural biological difference in size of the vocal folds can
be exploited for cultural reasons. We see similar behaviours in other animals
too. While larger animals naturally produce deeper-sounding calls, animals can
also make themselves sound larger, and therefore potentially more dominant,
by producing deeper calls.
As well as the overall pitch of the voice and the register used, there may also
be a difference in the tones chosen by male and female speakers. Studies with
English have shown that rises may be used more frequently by female speakers,
which relates to our observation in Unit 14, that women may ask questions
more often than men do.
Exercise 20.22 Have you noticed any differences in the intonation of younger and older
speakers?
Comment The use of rising tones appears to be on the increase for younger speakers.
Often, younger speakers use rises even when there is no question or continu-
ation implied, and it has been suggested that these rises may serve as a means of
checking that the listener is following what is being said. Nevertheless, some
listeners seem to ﬁnd the frequent use of rises quite irritating, as they think they
are continually being asked for a response. This phenomenon has entered the
public consciousness to some degree, and has been mentioned on TV shows
such as QI, The Weakest Link and Top Gear. The use of an increased number of
rises, in places where we would not normally expect them, is referred to
variously as Australian question intonation (as rises are also more common in
Australian English), high rising terminals, or uptalk.

20.11 Summary
In this unit, we have seen that the choices a speaker makes about their
intonation can affect the meaning and interpretation of an utterance. We have
seen that choices regarding intonation phrases, nucleus placement, nuclear
tones, and key and register can all affect meaning. In particular, intonation can
have effects of focus, attitude, grammar and discourse.
We have now completed all the units in the book. You should take some
time to reﬂect on how much you have learnt since you ﬁrst started with Unit 1.
We have looked at consonants, vowels, airstream mechanisms, allophones of
voice, place and manner, and allophones of vowels, elision, liaison and assim-
ilation, syllables, stress, broad and allophonic transcription, speech sound
variation, and the form and function of intonation. Well done!
20.12 Looking forward
Hopefully, you have found that your knowledge and interest in phonetics have
increased during your reading of this coursebook. The following pages provide
some charts and tables that you might ﬁnd useful, and ideas for further study. If
you keep listening to speech around you, you will never be bored and will
continue to learn about and be fascinated by phonetics.
20.13 Review questions
Have a look at the following questions to see if you have understood the
main points to learn from this unit.
 What are the different ways in which intonation can vary in order to
inﬂuence meaning?
 Is there a strict one-to-one correspondence between a particular
intonation pattern and a particular meaning?
 What types of meaning can be created by intonation?
20.14 Review exercises

different positions of the nucleus, and three different nuclear tones. Note that
the material is not punctuated and is not necessarily all spoken by a single
individual.

2 Think about the intonation you typically use when you give someone your
phone number. What aspects of intonation phrase boundaries, nucleus
placement and tone are likely to be shared by all speakers? Take a phone
number you know well and then produce it as you might if you were giving
it over the phone to a stranger. Note the intonation pattern you use, and try
to work out why you have made the choices you have made.
3 The following is an extract from the Friends episode ‘The One Where
Underdog Gets Away’ (season one, episode 9), which we looked at earlier in
the unit. This part of the episode is when the group ﬁrst realise that they are
locked out of Monica’s apartment. Look at the reoccurring word ‘keys’ (or
‘key’, in one instance) and try to work out what the appropriate intonation
pattern is each time. For each occurrence, consider if ‘keys’ is likely to be
the nucleus of the phrase, and, if so, what tone is likely to be used. If ‘keys’
is not the nucleus, explain which syllable might be, and why. This is
American English, but you can still apply the types of analysis that we have
used in this unit.
You might also like to watch the episode, to help you determine the
intonational features of the exchange, and to watch Rachel and Monica’s
hand gestures, which go along with their intonation patterns.
MONICA: Okay, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside,
juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
RACHEL: We’re waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys1.
MONICA: No I don’t.
RACHEL: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, “got the keys2.”
MONICA: No I didn’t. I asked, “got the ke-eys3?”
RACHEL: No, no, no, you said, “got the keys4”.

1 Aspirated consonants are those in ‘appendix’, ‘kidney’ and ‘pancreas’. The /t/ in
‘stomach’ is unaspirated. The second /t/ in ‘intestines’ and the /t/ in ‘uterus’ are
weakly aspirated, as they do not occur in stressed syllables.
2 ‘Bladder’, ‘brain’ and ‘vein’ all have devoiced obstruents at the start if they are
spoken in isolation. The /r/ in ‘prostate’ is devoiced, while ‘heart’ and ‘lung’ do
not contain any devoiced consonants.

2 The velum should be low most of the way through [n], as it is a nasal. It must be
raised throughout [t], as it is a plosive and needs the velum to be raised for
pressure to build. Therefore, the position of the velum should change rapidly
between the two. As [ɪ] is nasalised, the velum will not be raised throughout. In
this case, the velum will lower during [ɪ], in preparation for the upcoming nasal.

the vowel should be nasalised. In the diagram, the velum line should start and
end low for normal breathing. In addition, it should slope through the vowel,
indicating nasalisation, and should rise rapidly between /n/ and /t/, as the velum
must be fully closed for the obstruent.

Boys:
Jack, Thomas (second vowel), Joshua (ﬁrst vowel), Joseph (second
vowel) and Lewis (second vowel) all have pre-fortis clipping. The
others do not. Alﬁe, for example, has the /f/ in the onset of the
second syllable, rather than in the coda of the ﬁrst.
Girls:
Only Grace and Charlotte (second vowel) have pre-fortis clipping.
The /s/ in Jessica and Lucy forms the onset to the second syllable in
each, as does the /f/ in Sophie.
Unit 13
1 The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the word has six segments, with stress on the ﬁrst
syllable. The ﬁrst sound is a voiceless obstruent because the velum is raised and
the vocal folds are not vibrating. The second sound is either devoiced or
aspirated, and also nasalised, so it must be an approximant or a vowel. This
implies that the ﬁrst sound is a plosive, as devoicing and aspiration do not occur
after the other obstruents (that is, fricatives or affricates) in English. The third
sound is also nasalised. Sound four is a nasal, as it is the ﬁrst sound for which the
velum is fully lowered. The ﬁnal two sounds are both voiced and either nasal or
nasalised. Example words might be ‘planning’, ‘training’ or ‘tollman’.

/t/ in ‘true’ is retracted.
/p/ in ‘bump’ is nasally approached.

‘cigarette’ is likely to be stressed on the third syllable by speakers of British
English, but on the ﬁrst by speakers of American English.
‘booth’ normally has a voiced dental fricative for the ﬁnal consonant in

Scotland.
The ﬁrst vowel in ‘migraine’ is usually /i/ for older speakers, compared
to /aɪ/ for younger speakers.
‘schedule’ normally starts with /ʃ/ for older speakers, but may begin

American English pronunciation. In addition, the middle of the word may
be pronounced as /dj/ or /dʒ/.

Answers to review exercises

‘February’ has a number of different pronunciations, based on
regional accent and age. American speakers are more likely to say
/fɛbjuɛri/, while British speakers are more likely to say /fɛbruəri/.
However, younger speakers with both accents appear to be moving
towards the /ju/ pronunciation. One ﬁnal variation is that the word may be
spoken with only three syllables, with deletion of the medial /ə/. Use of this
pronunciation may depend on the individual or the situation.
2 Catherine and Hindley are from the upper classes and are relatively young.
Their pronunciations look fairly standard in contrast to Joseph’s. Joseph is older,
male and a servant, and his speech is represented with many regional pronun-
ciations, such as ‘t’’ for ‘the’ and ‘yah’ for ‘you’. It seems that Emily Brontë
intended to link lower social class with regional accents, which is especially
interesting, as the book is concerned throughout with the issues of social class
and mobility.
3 You may recall that this is very similar to an exercise we did at the start of the
book, before we knew much about phonetics. At that point, we simply tried to
decide if the words in each pair were homophones. Now, however, we can say
much more about them. Pair 1 will be homophones in non-rhotic accents, but
‘lore’ will have an /r/ in the coda for rhotic accents. Pair 2 will be homophones
for many speakers, but some Scottish and American accents, for example, use
[ʍ] at the start of ‘what’. Pair 3 are homophones for many Northern accents of
English, where they both have the ‘foot’ vowel [ʊ]. Southern varieties are likely
to use the ‘strut’ vowel [ʌ] in ‘luck’, however, whereas some Lancashire varieties
may use the ‘goose’ vowel [u] in ‘look’.

/faɪər ɪn ðə həʊl/
/ə pɛər əv faɪvz/
‘ﬁre’ and ‘pear’ both end with a non-high vowel, and the next word starts with a

call this process linking /r/.
Intrusive /r/:
/ærɪzəʊnər ənd tɛnəsi/
/ɪn ɔr əv hɪm/
‘Arizona’ and ‘awe’ both end with a non-high vowel, and the next word starts
with a vowel, so we get /r/-liaison. Because these words do not contain an
orthographic ‘r’ (at the end), we call this process intrusive /r/.
Neither process:
/kɑ but/
/peɪ ɒn taɪm/
Although ‘car’ ends with a vowel, the following word does not start with a
vowel, so the conditions for /r/-liaison are not met. ‘Pay’ ends in a vowel and is
followed by a word starting with a vowel, but the vowel at the end of ‘pay’ ends
high, so, again, the conditions for /r/-liaison are not met.

There are eight examples of potential linking /r/: ‘Far away’, ‘here is’, ‘Clare is’,
‘sister of’, ‘Clare and’, ‘store and’, ‘remember if’, ‘or apples’ and ‘or oranges’.
There are three examples of potential intrusive /r/: ‘Emma and’, ‘Sarah
asked’ and ‘Sarah always’.
Points that might have caused confusion are ‘to ask’ and ‘go again’, but in
each case the ﬁrst vowel is high, so liaison will not take place.
Rhotic speakers would not produce any linking /r/s. They would produce
/r/s in the same place as non-rhotic speakers produce linking /r/s; however, the
/r/s would not be inserted as a form of connected speech, since they would also
occur in the isolated version of the words.
There are also examples of potential elision in ‘called Clare’, ‘asked them’,
‘list but’, ‘supposed to’, ‘end they’, ‘told them’ and ‘next day’.

1 We can split the phrase up into intonation phrases in a number of ways.
a I can’t | talk to her | when she’s on a night out||
b I can’t talk to her || when she’s on a night out||
In both of these examples, intonation phrases may alternate between two
speakers, as in a conversation, or all be said by a single speaker.
c I can’t talk to her when she’s on a night out||
In this third example, the phrase is spoken by one person as a single intonation
phrase.
If spoken by a single speaker in a single intonation phrase, the nucleus may
occur in various positions.
a I can’t talk to her when she’s on a night out.
This is perhaps the default nucleus position, assuming the night out has not been
mentioned before, and the speaker does not wish to emphasise any other points.
b I can’t talk to her when she’s on a night out.
Here the speaker may wish to draw a contrast with other activities, such as
dancing or drinking, or be deaccenting ‘on a night out’, as it is given
information.
c I can’t talk to her when she’s on a night out.
Here the speaker may be able to talk to other people, but not to ‘her’.

The nuclear tone can also vary, of course, and create different meanings.
Here I keep the default position of the nucleus and vary only the tone
a I can’t talk to her when she’s on a night ˊout.
This may be a question about whether or not this is an appropriate action to take,
or the speaker may be about to continue and say something else.
b I can’t talk to her when she’s on a night ˋout.
This may be an emphatic statement that this is not possible.
c I can’t talk to her when she’s on a night ˅out.
This may be implying that the speaker feels there is another time to talk to her
that would be more appropriate, so might be followed by something like, ‘but I
could catch her tomorrow morning before work’.
2 Firstly, we tend to use boundaries to break up telephone numbers into easily
remembered sections. So, using the main phone number for my university as an
example, I would do the following:
020 | 7040 | 5060 ||
This practice also has the effect of grouping together the different parts of the
number, which, here, are the area code, the number shared by all parts of the
university, and then the extension. Notice that each falls into a separate
intonation phrase.
Interestingly, some people group the ‘7’ in London numbers with the area
code, producing 0207 | 040 |. However, grouping the 7 (in speech or writing)
with the 020 area code can cause a problem, because the area code can be
omitted if you are dialling from within the same area. So, grouping the 7 with
the area code may lead the listener to believe, erroneously, that it is unnecessary
if dialling from within London. This is an illustration of how intonation can
affect meaning in a practical way.
In intonation phrases for most phone numbers, the nucleus probably goes on
the ﬁnal digit of each phrase (using the default pattern).
020 | 7040 | 5060||
However, for this phone number, I often say 7040 in the middle phrase
instead, to mark out the contrast between ‘70’ at the beginning of the second
phrase, and ‘40’ at the end, and because the repetition of ‘0’ causes it to be
deaccented.
The ﬁrst two nuclei are usually some sort of rise, to indicate continuation,
while the ﬁnal one is a fall, to indicate ﬁnality.

3 In (1) and (2), ‘key’ is the nucleus, with a high fall nuclear tone. It is not
deaccented the second time, as Rachel is repeating verbatim something she
claims Monica said earlier, where the intonation was especially important for
meaning and thus needs to be repeated exactly. In (3) and (4), the characters play
with the idea that the same words can be a statement or a question, depending on
the nuclear tone. In (3) Monica uses an exaggerated high rising tone, with
matching hand gestures, and in (4), Rachel responds with another high fall, also
showing the intonation pattern with gesture. In (5), Chandler moves the nucleus
to ‘have’, because the word ‘keys’ has been repeated so many times, and he now
wishes to focus the attention on whether anyone actually has a set with them. He
could have put the nucleus on ‘either’, but it would not have sounded natural on
‘keys’. He uses a rising tone, with an exaggerated rising tail, partly imitating
Monica’s tone in (3). In (6), Joey shifts the nucleus to ‘we’ and uses a fall-rise
nuclear tone, with ‘key’ part of a rising tail. Here the nucleus is on ‘we’, reﬂecting
the fact that neither of the women (you) has the key. He could also have put the
nucleus on ‘copy’, but, again, it would not have sounded natural on ‘key’. The
fall-rise tone may leave something unsaid, perhaps that he can go and get it.

A classic introduction to general phonetics, which has formed the inspiration
for much of the material in this book.
Ashby, P. (2005) Speech Sounds, London: Routledge.
Lots of exercises for practice and a very friendly and accessible style.
Ashby, M. and Maidment, J. (2005) Introducing Phonetic Science, Cambridge
University Press.
Very clear explanations and diagrams, and successfully links acoustic and
articulatory aspects of phonetics.
Catford, J. C. (2001) A Practical Introduction to Phonetics. Oxford University Press.
An excellent resource for learning to produce the sounds of the world’s languages,
as well as a good general introduction to phonetics.
Collins, B. and Mees, M. (2003) Practical Phonetics and Phonology: A Resource Book
for Students (Routledge English Language Introductions), London: Routledge.
Lots of practical exercises, including those from an audio CD. Covers accents and
pronunciation change, as well as basic concepts in phonetics and phonology.
Cruttenden, A. (1997) Intonation, Cambridge University Press.
Covers form and function of intonation, including the system presented in this book
and alternatives.
Cruttenden, A. (2008) Gimson’s Pronunciation of English, 7th edn, London:
Hodder Arnold.
This book deals with much that has been covered in this text, including intonation.
The newer editions also include acoustic information.
Garcia Lecumberri, M. L. and Maidment, J. A. (2000) English Transcription Course,
London: Arnold.
Includes lots of practice exercises, concentrating particularly on broad transcription.
It also includes short and clear explanations of connected speech processes.
International Phonetic Association (1999) Handbook of the International Phonetic
Association: A Guide to the Use of the International Phonetic Alphabet, Cambridge
University Press.
The deﬁnitive guide to the IPA, including illustrations for lots of languages,
examples from which have been used throughout this text.
278

Ladefoged, P. (2001) A Course in Phonetics, 4th edn, Belmont, CA: Thomas
Learning.
Generally considered to be the best general phonetics textbook for beginners, it is
most comprehensive and covers articulatory and acoustic phonetics, as well as
providing many practice exercises.
Lodge, K. (2009) A Critical Introduction to Phonetics, London: Continuum.
Covers acoustics, articulatory phonetics and varieties of English, while
encouraging the reader to think critically and go beyond introductory concepts.
This is a perfect text for when you are ready to deal with some of the more advanced
topics in phonetics.
Trask, R. L. (1996). A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology, London: Routledge.
Covers just about every term you will need when studying phonetics and phonology,
often with references for further information, and always with a transcription
letting you know how to pronounce the term.
Trudgill, P., Hughes, A. and Watt, D. (2005) English Accents and Dialects: An
Introduction to Social and Regional Varieties of English in the British Isles,
London: Hodder.
Covers variation across many different varieties of British English, going well
beyond what we have covered in this text.
Wells, J. (1982) Accents of English, 3 vols., Cambridge University Press.
The most comprehensive study of English accents worldwide, and responsible for
the lexical set words that we used throughout this book.
Wells, J. (2008) Longman Pronunciation Dictionary, Harlow: Longman.
An indispensible reference for checking transcriptions of individual words, and can
therefore be used for daily transcription practice of individual words. Also covers
deﬁnitions of phonetic terms, and information about pronunciation change.
