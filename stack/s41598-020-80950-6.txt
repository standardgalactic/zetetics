Isoscattering strings 
of concatenating graphs 
and networks
Michał Ławniczak1*, Adam Sawicki2*, Małgorzata Białous1 & Leszek Sirko1*
We identify and investigate isoscattering strings of concatenating quantum graphs possessing n units 
and 2n infinite external leads. We give an insight into the principles of designing large graphs and 
networks for which the isoscattering properties are preserved for n →∞ . The theoretical predictions 
are confirmed experimentally using n = 2 units, four-leads microwave networks. In an experimental 
and mathematical approach our work goes beyond prior results by demonstrating that using a trace 
function one can address the unsettled until now problem of whether scattering properties of open 
complex graphs and networks with many external leads are uniquely connected to their shapes. The 
application of the trace function reduces the number of required entries to the 2n × 2n scattering 
matrices ˆS of the systems to 2n diagonal elements, while the old measures of isoscattering require all 
(2n)2 entries. The studied problem generalizes a famous question of Mark Kac “Can one hear the shape 
of a drum?”, originally posed in the case of isospectral dissipationless systems, to the case of infinite 
strings of open graphs and networks.
The celebrated question of Marc Kac “Can one hear the shape of a drum?”1 was posed to address the problem 
of isospectral drums having the same shape. Mathematically, this question is equivalent to the distinctiveness 
of spectra of the Laplace operator on planar domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The negative answer 
to Marc Kac question was formulated by Gordon, Webb, and ­Wolpert2,3. Using Sunada’s ­theorem4 they con-
structed different in shape pairs of isospectral dissipationless domains in R2 . These important theoretical findings 
were confirmed experimentally by Sridhar and ­Kudrolli5 and Dhar et al.6 who used for this purpose especially 
designed pairs of microwave isospectral cavities. One should point out that the isospectral properties of pairs of 
neutrino billiards with the shapes of various isospectral in the nonrelativistic limit billiards have been recently 
investigated numerically in Ref.7. It was found that the isospectrality of the billiards is lost when changing from 
the nonrelativistic to the relativistic case.
The problem of isospectrality was also analyzed in other important physically, mathematically and techno-
logically quantum systems—quantum graphs. Quantum graphs are the unions of vertices connected by one-
dimensional quantum ­bounds8,9. The importance of quantum graphs stems from the fact that they can be used 
to describe a huge number of physical and mathematical systems and models, e.g., nanophotonic lasers on 
­graphs10, superconducting quantum ­circuits11, entanglement in graph ­states12,13, experimental setups for high-
dimensional multipartite quantum ­states14, quantum circuits in tunnel ­junctions15, and Weyl and non-Weyl 
quantum graphs and ­networks16.
Gutkin and ­Smilansky17 proved that the spectrum of a graph can be used to uniquely identify graph’s structure 
if the lengths of its bonds are incommensurable. However, in the case of graphs with commensurate lengths 
of bonds the situation is more complicated. Among infinitely many realizations of graphs with the same total 
length L it is also possible to find the isospectral dissipationless ones, which are characterized by different topo-
logical properties. An effective method of construction of such graphs uses the representation theory and the 
transplantation ­technique18,19.
In real life open physical systems, including quantum graphs with ­leads20 and microwave networks, one have 
to deal with dissipation of energy due to, e.g., internal absorption and coupling to the outside world. In such a 
situation one can ask a more general question whether the geometry of a graph can be revealed in scattering-
type experiments. Also in this case the question was answered in negative. To find this answer Band, Sawicki 
and ­Smilansky21,22 analyzed isospectral quantum graphs with attached two infinite leads. They theoretically 
demonstrated that among such graphs it is possible to identify the isoscattering ones.

The theoretical findings were experimentally confirmed in the series of ­papers23–25 where a pair of isoscattering 
quantum graphs with two external infinite leads were simulated by two isoscattering microwave networks. In the 
experimental analysis relatively simple isoscattering networks were characterized by standard characteristics of 
isoscattering properties of graphs such as the cumulative phase and the structures of poles of the determinant 
of the two-port scattering matrices.
In this article we present the construction of isoscattering strings resulting from concatenating open quantum 
graphs and microwave networks. The strings are constructed from n building blocks (units), each one pos-
sessing two external leads, and therefore they can be characterized by 2n × 2n scattering matrices ˆS . Using the 
transplantation technique we prove that the strings are isoscattering, i.e. they have the same spectra of scatter-
ing matrices. It means that their scattering matrices can be, for example, characterized by the same cumulative 
phases of their determinants which is a standard indicator of ­isoscattering23–25. We show that their isoscattering 
properties are preserved in the limit n →∞ . Furthermore, we demonstrate that a trace function can be used as 
a much simpler and therefore a much more effective tool for identifying of complex isoscattering networks. The 
theoretical predictions are confirmed experimentally for n = 2 , i.e., strings of four-leads microwave networks.
Isoscattering strings of concatenating graphs
We demonstrate that the two strings of concatenating open graphs Ŵ1,2n and Ŵ2,2n given in Fig. 1a, b are isoscat-
tering. For this we construct the transplantation matrix that transforms a wave function ˆ1,2n with the frequency 
ν defined on Ŵ1,2n to a wave function ˆ2,2n with the same frequency ν defined on Ŵ2,2n . Both ˆ1,2n and ˆ2,2n satisfy 
all the vertex conditions of Ŵ1,2n and Ŵ2,2n , respectively. The construction goes as follows. We divide each string 
of graphs into 2n building segments (see Fig. 1c, d). The restriction of the wave function ˆ1,2n to a segment k is 
denoted by 1,k and similarly the restriction of ˆ2,2n to a segment k is denoted by 2,k . Our goal is to show that 
there is a 2n × 2n matrix ˆT2n that is independent of ν and satisfies:

string Ŵ1,2n with n −1 loops, 2n leads, and V = 2n + 4 vertices. (b) The isoscattering string Ŵ2,2n with n loops, 
2n leads, and V = 2n + 2 vertices. The Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are marked by N and D 
capital letters, respectively. The restriction of the wave function ˆ1,2n to a segment k of the string Ŵ1,2n is denoted 
by 1,k . The wave function 2,k restricted to a segment k of Ŵ2,2n can be expressed by the components of the 
wave function ˆ1,2n using the formulas (2–3). (c–d) The elementary units of the isoscattering strings Ŵ1,2n and 
Ŵ2,2n , respectively. The vertices of the internal units possess the Neumann boundary conditions. The vertices of 
the last units of the strings from the right-hand side fulfil the Dirichlet boundary conditions.

One can easily see that if we put
then ˆ2,2n satisfies the vertex conditions of Ŵ2,2n provided that ˆ1,2n does so on Ŵ1,2n . Therefore, the transplanta-
tion matrix ˆT2n is given by:
The existence of transplantation guarantees that the 2n × 2n scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) of the open graphs 
Ŵ1,2n and Ŵ2,2n are conjugated through the matrix ˆT2n,
To see this denote by ˆf1,2n and ˆf2,2n the restrictions of ˆ1,2n and ˆ2,2n to infinite leads, respectively. We have
Next, note that the transplantation can be restricted to infinite leads. Thus the existence of the transplantation 
implies
Combining these two equations we obtain
which is equivalent to (5).
Isoscattering strings of concatenating microwave networks
The simulation of quantum graphs by microwave networks is attainable because of a direct analogy between 
the telegraph equation characterizing a microwave network and the Schrödinger equation of the complemen-
tary quantum ­graph26–28. Microwave networks allow for the simulation of quantum graphs described by three 
basic ensembles in the random matrix theory (RMT): the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE)16,23,26,29–32, 
characterized by time (T) invariance, the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE)26–28,33,34 without T-invariance, and 
the Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE)35 also characterized by T-invariance. Many significant papers on this 
­topic16,27,29,35,36 clearly demonstrate that microwave networks are particularly useful in the investigation of proper-
ties of open quantum graphs with complex topology. Microwave networks and coupled waveguides can also be 
used to study a topological edge ­invariant37 and the photon number statistics of coherent ­light38. Recently, micro-
wave networks have been applied to realization of the chiral orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ­ensembles39.
In the experiment described in this article strings of microwave networks simulating strings of quantum 
graphs with preserved time invariance symmetry were used. They are composed of microwave joints (vertices) 
connected by coaxial cables (bonds). Each microwave joint (vertex) i of a network is connected to the other joints 
by vi bonds. The number vi is defined as the valency of the joint i. In the construction of strings of networks the 
SMA-RG402 microwave coaxial cables were used. They consist of two conductors: the inner one of radius r1 
which is surrounded by an outer conductor of radius r2 . A material with the dielectric constant ε = 2.06 is used 
to fill the space between the conductors. Below the onset of the TE11 mode, νTE ≃
c
π(r1+r2)√ε ≃33 ­GHz40, where 
c denotes the speed of light in the vacuum, inside a coaxial cable is satisfied the condition for propagating only 
the TEM mode.

The pair of the isoscattering strings of concatenating networks Ŵ1,4 and Ŵ2,4 obtained from the two elemen-
tary units shown in Fig. 1c, d, respectively, are demonstrated in Fig. 2a, b. In Fig. 2c we show the scheme of the 
isoscattering strings of concatenating microwave networks Ŵ2,4 used in the experiment.
For the above strings of graphs and networks the two most typical vertex boundary conditions will be con-
sidered, the Neumann and Dirichlet ones. The Neumann boundary condition enforces the continuity of waves 
meeting at the joint (vertex) i and vanishing of the sum of their derivatives at i. The Dirichlet boundary condition 
requires vanishing of the waves at a given joint.
The string Ŵ1,4 of the n = 2 graphs in Fig. 2a consists of V = 8 vertices connected by B = 8 bonds. The valency 
of the vertices 3 −6 is v = 4 while for the other ones the valency is v = 1 . The vertices with numbers 1 −2 satisfy 
the Dirichlet boundary conditions, while for the vertices 3 −8 the Neumann boundary conditions are satisfied. 
The second string Ŵ2,4 , shown in Fig. 2b, consists of V = 6 vertices connected by B = 7 bonds. At the vertex 1 
the Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed while the vertices with the numbers 2 −6 satisfy the Neumann 
boundary conditions.
The strings of concatenating microwave networks Ŵ1,4 and Ŵ2,4 have the following optical lengths of the bonds:
In contrast to the investigated ­in23 systems which consisted of simple isoscattering networks with L = 2 external 
leads (one unit, n = 1 , of the considered in this article strings) here we study experimentally much more complex 
isoscattering microwave strings of concatenating networks, consisting of n = 2 units and having L = 4 external 
leads. Because of larger number of leads the systems are more open to the external world. The strings of the 
networks Ŵ1,4 and Ŵ2,4 are described by 2n × 2n scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) , respectively. The relationship 
between both matrices is given by
where ˆT4 is 4 × 4 transplantation matrix (4). In general, the application of a standard measure of isoscattering 
such as the phase of scattering matrix determinant
is from the experimental point of view very inconvenient since for each 2n × 2n scattering matrix ˆS(I) or ˆS(II) it 
requires measurements of (2n)2 matrix elements. If we even assume the reciprocity of the matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) 
for T-invariant systems, which imposes that the transmission between any of two “ports” of the matrices does 
not depend upon the propagation direction, it still requires 2n2 + n matrix elements for each of them.
Therefore, we introduce a new measure of isocattering which is the trace of scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) . 
Using the properties of the trace function from the formula (5) one obtains
b/2 = 0.0537 ± 0.0005 m,
c/2 = 0.0508 ± 0.0005 m,
a = 0.1597 ± 0.0005 m,
b = 0.1074 ± 0.0005 m,
c = 0.1016 ± 0.0005 m,
2a = 0.3194 ± 0.0005 m.

One should point out that both functions trˆS(I) and trˆS(II) are complex and depend on microwave frequency ν . 
The application of the trace function significantly simplifies the experimental procedure. Now, the measurement 
of only 2n diagonal elements of each scattering matrix in a function of frequency ν is required.
The measurements of the scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) were performed using the vector network analyzer 
(VNA) Agilent E8364B. The experimental procedure is explained in the case of the string of microwave networks 
Ŵ2,4 presented in Fig. 2c.
To measure the diagonal elements S(II)
33  and S(II)
44  of the scattering matrix ˆS(II) the flexible 50 Ω test port cables 
HP 85133-60016 and HP 85133-60017 of the VNA were connected to the vertices 4 and 5 of the string of 
microwave networks shown in Fig. 2c. To the vertices 3 and 2, 50 Ω loads were attached as the realization of the 
two additional leads L∞
2  and L∞
1  . The connection of the VNA to a string of microwave networks (see Fig. 2c) is 
equivalent to attaching of two infinite leads L∞
3  and L∞
4  to a string of quantum graphs. The diagonal elements 
S(II)
11  and S(II)
22  were measured similarly. In this case the VNA was connected to the vertices 2 and 3, while to the 
vertices 4 and 5, 50  loads were connected.
The full scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) , including the off-diagonal elements, are required for testing of 
the properties of the isoscattering strings using the transplantation matrix ˆT4 . In this case six combinations of 
connections of microwave test port cables to each string are possible. If any of two vertices of the string were 
connected to the VNA the remaining two vertices were terminated with 50  loads.
Experimental results
The measurements of the diagonal elements of the scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) were performed in the fre-
quency range ν = 0.01–1.3 GHz. In Fig. 3a we show that the amplitudes of the trace function |trˆS(I)| and |trˆS(II)| 
of the scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) of the strings of networks Ŵ1,4 and Ŵ2,4 , marked by red solid line and black 
open circles, respectively, are close to each other, proving that we are dealing with the isoscattering networks. 
For the frequency range 0.01–1 GHz the agreement between the results obtained for both strings of networks is 
almost perfect. However, for the frequency range 1–1.3 GHz small discrepancies arise, caused possibly by small 
differences in the cables’ lengths and a small differentiation of the vertex boundary conditions of the networks 
in a function of frequency ν.
The modulus of the trace function of the scattering matrices can be treated as a concise measure of the iso-
cattering properties of the strings of networks and graphs with dissipation. The problem of losses in microwave 
networks are discussed ­in24. However, the formula (13) deals with the full trace function which is a complex 
number. Therefore, the isoscattering properties of the two strings of networks should be also observed in the 
phases of the trace functions, regardless of the absorption strength

the results obtained for different networks Ŵ1,4 and Ŵ2,4 is very good, demonstrating that we deal with the isoscat-
tering strings of networks.
It is important to note that the isoscattering strings of graphs considered in this article have an additional 
important property, namely the scattering matrices of them are conjugated to each other by the transplantation 
relation (11), where

The matrix ˆT4 does not depend on the frequency and the Eq. (11) is valid for all values of ν.
In order to check the transplantation relation (11) we transformed experimentally measured scattering matrix 
of the first string of networks ˆS(I)′ = ˆT−1
4
ˆS(II) ˆT4 and compared it to the scattering matrix ˆS(I) of the second one. 
In Fig. 4 we present the results obtained for the moduli |S(I)′
11 | (red solid line) and |S(I)
11 | (black empty circles), 
respectively. Figure 4 shows clearly that the transplantation relation works very well. Also in this case some small 
differences that are seen for ν > 0.55 GHz can be attributed to small differences in the cables’ lengths and a small 
differentiation of the vertex boundary conditions in a function of microwave frequency. In general, however, 
the transformed scattering matrix of the first string of networks ˆT−1
4
ˆS(II) ˆT4 reconstructs very well the scattering 
matrix of the second one ˆS(I).
In summary, we proved that there are isoscattering strings of concatenating graphs possessing n units and 2n 
infinite external leads. The isoscattering properties of such strings of open graphs are preserved for n →∞ . The 
theoretical predictions were confirmed experimentally using the strings of two microwave networks Ŵ1,4 and 
Ŵ2,4 consisting n = 2 units and four-leads which are characterized by the scattering matrices ˆS(I) and ˆS(II) , respec-
tively. We proved that both systems are isoscattering showing that both matrices are linked by the transplantation 
relation (11). Furthermore, in the analysis of the strings of microwave networks we used a new measure of 
isoscattering—the trace function. We demonstrated that the amplitudes |trˆS(I)| and |trˆS(II)| , and the phases 
Im

trˆS(II)
 of the trace function measured in the frequency range ν = 0.01–1.3 GHz are 
very close to each other, proving that both networks are isoscattering.
The application of this new measure reduces the number of required entries of the 2n × 2n scattering matrices 
ˆS of the systems to only 2n diagonal elements. The measures of isoscattering used in the earlier ­investigations23,25 
required all (2n)2 entries of the scattering matrices ˆS . Thus for large open experimental systems, with many leads, 
they have no operational meaning. The obtained results clearly show that the investigated strings of microwave 
networks Ŵ1,4 and Ŵ2,4 are isoscattering paving the way towards the future experimental analysis of even more 
complex isoscattering systems for which the transplantation relation can be applied. Moreover, after deleting 
infinite leads, the considered strings of graphs are isospectral as closed quantum systems. They, therefore con-
stitute an interesting example of arbitrary large isospectral quantum graphs.
