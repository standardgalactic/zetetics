Every one says something true about the nature of things, and while individually 
they contribute little or nothing to the truth, by the union of all a considerable 
amount is amassed.

Preface 
Robots manipulating and navigating in unmodelled environments need robust 
geometric cues to recover scene structure. Vision can provide some of the most 
powerful cues. However, describing and inferring geometric information about 
arbitrarily curved surfaces from visual cues is a difficult problem in computer 
vision. Existing methods of recovering the three-dimensional shape of visible sur- 
faces, e.g. stereo and structure from motion, are inadequate in their treatment 
of curved surfaces, especially when surface texture is sparse. They also lack ro- 
bustness in the presence of measurement noise or when their design assumptions 
are violated. This book addresses these limitations and shortcomings. 
Firstly novel computational theories relating visual motion arising from viewer 
movements to the differential geometry of visible surfaces are presented. It is 
shown how an active monocular observer, making deliberate exploratory move- 
ments, can recover reliable descriptions of curved surfaces by tracking image 
curves. The deformation of apparent contours (outlines of curved surfaces) un- 
der viewer motion is analysed and it is shown how surface curvature can be 
inferred from the acceleration of image features. The image motion of other 
curves on surfaces is then considered, concentrating on aspects of surface geom- 
etry which can be recovered efficiently and robustly and which are insensitive to 
the exact details of viewer motion. Examples include the recovery of the sign 
of normal curvature from the image motion of inflections and the recovery of 
surface orientation and time to contact from the differential invariants of the 
image velocity field computed at image curves. 
These theories have been implemented and tested using a real-time tracking 
system based on deformable contours (B-spline snakes). Examples are presented 
in which the visually derived geometry of piecewise smooth surfaces is used in a 
variety of tasks including the geometric modelling of objects, obstacle avoidance 
and navigation and object manipulation.

I am extremely grateful to him for his astute and incisive guidance and the cat- 
alyst for many of the ideas described here. Co-authored extracts from Chapter 
2, 3 and 5 have been been published in the International Journal of Computer 
Vision, International Journal of Robotics Research, Image and Vision Comput- 
ing, and in the proceedings of the International and European Conferences on 
Computer Vision. I am also grateful to Andrew Zisserman for his diligent proof 
reading, technical advice, and enthusiastic encouragement. A co-authored ar- 
ticle extracted from part of Chapter 4 appears in the International Journal of 
Computer Vision. 
I have benefited considerably from discussions with members of the Robotics 
Research Group and members of the international vision research community.

derink, Christopher Longuet-Higgins, Steve Maybank, and Joseph Mundy. 
Lastly I am indebted to Professor J.M. Brady, for providing financial support, 
excellent research facilities, direction, and leadership. This research was funded 
by the IBM UK Science Centre and the Lady Wolfson Junior Research Fellowship 
at St Hugh's College, Oxford. 
Dedication 
This book is dedicated to my parents, Concetta and Salvatore Cipolla. Their 
loving support and attention, and their encouragement to stay in higher educa- 
tion (despite the sacrifices that this entailed for them) gave me the strength to 
persevere.
