Note to the Students
The IIT-JEE is one of the hardest exams to crack for students, for a very simple 
reason – concepts cannot be learned by rote, they have to be absorbed, and IIT
believes in strong concepts. Each question in the IIT-JEE entrance exam is meant
to push the analytical ability of the student to its limit. That is why the questions 
are called brainteasers!
Students find Mathematics the most difficult part of IIT-JEE. We understand that 
it is difficult to get students to love mathematics, but one can get students to love 
succeeding at mathematics. In order to accomplish this goal, the book has been 
written in clear, concise, and inviting writing style. It can be used as a self-study
text as theory is well supplemented with examples and solved examples. Wher-
ever required, figures have been provided for clear understanding.
If you take full advantage of the unique features and elements of this textbook, 
we believe that your experience will be fulfilling and enjoyable. Let’s walk
through some of the special book features that will help you in your efforts to 
crack IIT-JEE.
To crack mathematics paper for IIT-JEE the five things to remember are:
1. Understanding the concepts 
2. Proper applications of concepts 
3. Practice
4. Speed 
5. Accuracy
About the Cover Picture
Medieval mathematician and businessman Fibonacci (Leonardo Pisano) posed
the following problem in his treatise Liber Abaci (pub. 1202): 
How many pairs of rabbits will be produced in a year, beginning with a single pair,
if in every month each pair bears a new pair which becomes productive from the 
second month on?
The solution to this problem leads to the recursive sequence, obeying the simple 
rule that to calculate the next term one simply sums the preceding two. The Fibonacci 
numbers are recursively defined by Fn
F +1 = Fn
F + Fn
F –1, where F0
F  = 0, F1
F = 1. The first
few are
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, …
The image on the cover is that of a Fibonacci spiral.

Special attention has been paid to present
an engaging, clear, precise narrative in the
layout that is easy to use and designed to
reduce math anxiety students may have.
CLEAR, CONCISE, AND INVITING WRITING
Every new topic or concept starts with de-
fining the concept for students. Related ex-
amples to aid the understanding follow the
definition.
DEFINITIONS
DEFINITION 7.1
Random Experiment A random experiment is an experiment in which
1. The experiment can be repeated any number of times under identical conditions.
2. All possible outcomes of the experiment are known in advance.
3. The actual outcome in a particular experiment is not known in advance.
(1) Rolling of an Unbiased Die
Rolling of an unbiased die is a random experiment in
which all the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, if 
we denote the six faces of the die with the numbers 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6. The faces of the die may also contain dots 
in numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. In any case, we identify
the faces of a die with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
The actual outcome in a particular experiment (rolling
of the die) is the number that appears on the upper-
most face of the die and this is not known in advance. 
This experiment can be performed any number of times 
under identical conditions.
(2) Tossing of an Unbiased Coin
Tossing of an unbiased coin is a random experiment in
which there are only two possible outcomes, namely, Head
(H) and Tail (T). In a particular experiment (tossing of the 
coin), the outcome is not known in advance. This experiment
can also be performed any number of times under iden-
tical conditions and therefore this is a random experiment.
Examples
“Tossing of an unbiased coin till tail appears” is also a random experiment. However, experiments such as 
“measuring the acceleration due to gravity using a compound pendulum” is not a random experiment, since the
experiment cannot be repeated under identical conditions and the possible outcomes are not known in advance.
Throughout this chapter, by a coin or die we always mean an unbiased coin (or a fair coin) or unbiased die (or a
fair die) unless otherwise mentioned.
DEFINITION 7.2 
Some of the important definitions are as follows:
1. A set of possible outcomes of an experiment is called an event.
2. Two or more events are said to be exhaustive if the performance of the experiment always
results in the occurance of atleast one of them.
3. Two or more events are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurance of one of the events
prevents the occurance of any of the remaining events.
4. Two or more events are said to be equally likely (or equiprobable) if there is no reason to
expect one of them in preference to others.
Each chapter starts with an opening vignette, defini-
tion of the topic, and contents of the chapter that give
you an overview of the chapter to help you see the 
big picture.

PEDAGOGY 

Examples pose a specific problem
using concepts already presented
and then work through the solution. 
These serve to enhance the students' 
understanding of the subject matter.
EXAMPLES
Example     7.3   
Suppose that an integer is picked from among 1 to 20
(both inclusive). What is the probability of picking a 
prime?
Solution: There are 20 outcomes of the experiment
of picking an integer. The primes between 1 and 20 are
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19 and these are 8 in number.
Therefore, 8 are favourable to the event of picking a 
prime and hence the probability of picking a prime is
8
20

=
Example     7.4   
none of the dice shows 3 (on the upper most face).
Solution: Any outcome of “throwing 8 dice” can be 
expressed as an 8-tuple of integers from 1 to 6 and hence 
the total number of possible outcomes is 68.
An outcome that none of the dice shows 3 can be
expressed as 8-tuple of integers from the 5-element set
{1, 2, 4, 5, 6} and there are 58 such outcomes. Thus, the 
probability that none of the dice shows 3 is

Example     7.5   
Suppose that a bag contains 6 red, 5 black and 4 blue
balls. Find the probability that three balls drawn simul-
taneously are one blue, one black and one red.
Solution: The total number of balls is
6 + 5 + 4 = 15
Out of these 15 balls, 3 balls can be drawn in 15C3 ways.
Therefore, 3 balls can be drawn simultaneously in

Drawing one blue, one black and one red ball simulta-
neously can be expressed as a triple (a1, a2, a3), where

DEFINITION 1.8
Two angles are said to be complementary if their sum is a right 
angle. Therefore, for 0 £ q < p/2,
p
q and 
q
p/2 
p
- q are complementary.
q
THEOREM 1.6
Let q and 
q
y be complementary angles. Then
y
1. sin q = cos y and cos
y
q = sin y
2. tanq = cot y and cot
y
q = tany
3. sec q = cosecy and cosec
y
q = sec y
PROOF
Draw a right-angled triangle OAP with OAP

=
°
90 and AOP

= q (Figure 1.12). Since the sum of 
the angles of any triangle is 180° and since q + y = 90°, it follows that OPA

Unlike the trigonometric functions sine and cosine, the
trigonometric functions secant, tangent, cosecant and
cotangent are not defined on the whole real line. The
functions secx and tanx are not defined at x = (2n + 1)
p/2, 
p
n Î, since cosx = 0 at these x. Similarly cosecx
and cotx are not defined at x = np,p n Î, since sin x = 0
at these x. The domains of all the trigonometric funct-
ions are collected in Table 1.1 for convenience and for 
quick reference.

Within each chapter the stu-
dents would find problems 
to reinforce and check their 
understanding. This would 
help build confidence as one 
progresses in the chapter.
These are marked with a 
pointed finger.

  SUMMARY
7.1 Random experiment: An experiment is called
random experiment if the following conditions are 
satisfied.
(1) The experiment can be repeated any number of 
times under similar conditions.
(2) All possible outcomes of the experiment are 
known in advance
(3) The actual outcome in a particular experiment 
cannot be exactly predicted.
7.2 Sample space and event: The set of all possible 
outcomes of a random experiment is called sample
space of the experiment and any subset of the sample 
space is called an event.
7.3 Exhaustive events: Two or more events are called 
exhaustive events if the performance of the experi-
ment results in the occurrence of at least one of 
these events.
7.4 Mutually exclusive events: Two or more events are 
said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of one
of the events prevents the occurrence of any one of 
the other events.
7.5 Equally likely events: Two or more events are said 
to be equally likely (or equiprobable) if there is no
reason to expect one of them in preference to the 
others.
7.6 Probability (classical definition): Suppose in a 
random experiment there are n exhaustive, mutually
exclusive, equally likely outcomes. If m of them are 
favourable to an event E, then the probability P(E)
of E is defined as
E
 7.8 Usual probability: The classical probability is also 
called usual probability.
 7.9 Sample points and sample space: Any possible 
outcome of a random experiment is called a sample 
point and the set of all sample points is called
the sample space of the random experiment. An
elementary event means a sample point. Generally 
sample space is denoted by S.
7.10 Finite sample space: A set A is called finite if either
A is an empty set or it is bijective with the set {1,
2, 3, …, n} for some positive integer n. If a sample 
space is finite, then it is called a finite sample space.
7.11 Countably infinite sample space: A set A is called 
countably infinite set if it is bijective with the set 
+ of all positive integers. If the sample space of a 
random experiment is countably infinite set, then 
the sample space is called countably infinite. For
example, tossing a fair coin till head appears has a
countably infinite sample space.
7.12 Definition: Here afterwards events mean subsets 
of the sample space. If A and B are two events, then 
A È B means at least one of A or B and A Ç B
means both A and B. Impossible event is denoted
by empty set f and a certain event means the entire 
f
sample space.
7.13 Various events in set theoretical form:
(1) Events E1, E2, …, En are said to be mutually 
exclusive if Ei Ç Ej
E = f for
f
i ¹ j.
(2) E1, E2, …, En are called exhaustive events if E1 È 
E2 È  È En
E = S (sample space).

INTEGER-TYPE QUESTIONS
The questions in this section are nu-
merical problems for which no choices
are provided. The students are required
to find the exact answers to numerical
problems and enter the same in OMR 
sheets. Answers can be one-digit or
two-digit numerals.
These questions check the 
analytical and reasoning 
skills of the students. Two 
statements are provided – 
Statement I and Statement 
II. The student is expected
to verify if (a) both state-
ments are true and if both 
are true, verify if statement 
I follows from statement
II; (b) both statements are
true and if both are true, 
verify if statement II is not 
the correct reasoning for 
statement I; (c), (d) which
of the statements is untrue.
ASSERTION–REASONING TYPE QUESTIONS
In the following set of questions, a Statement I is given
and a corresponding Statement II is given just below it. 
Mark the correct answer as:
(A)  Both Statements I and II are true and Statement II
is a correct explanation for Statement I.
(B)  Both Statements I and II are true but Statement II is 
not a correct explanation for Statement I.
(C) Statement I is true and Statement II is false.
(D) Statement I is false and Statement II is true.

Trigonometric Ratios and Transformations
Trigonometry is the study of the relation between angles and sides of a triangle. This is an essential branch of 
mathematics useful for the measurement of areas, distances and heights.
1.1 | Angles and Their Measures
Consider a straight line extending indefinitely in both the directions and let O be a point on this straight line. Then the 
point O divides the line into two parts and each of these two parts is called a ray and O is called the vertex of the two
rays. Usually rays are denoted by OA, where O is the vertex and A is any point on the ray (ray is a part of the straight
line). In Figure 1.1, OA and OB are rays. The vertex of a ray is called the origin of the ray or the initial point of the ray.
t
FIGURE 1.1 Rays OA and OB.
DEFINITION 1.1
The figure formed by two rays with the common vertex is called an angle and is denoted by 
AOB or AOB,

 where O is the common vertex, A is a point on one ray and B is a point on 
the other ray as shown in Figure 1.2.
O
B
FIGURE 1.2 Angle.
A real number is associated with each angle and this number is called the measure of the angle. There are two impor-
tant systems of measurement of an angle: the sexagesimal system (or British system) and the radian system (or circular 
measure system).
DEFINITION 1.2
Sexagesimal System
An angle AOB

is called a right angle if OB is perpendicular to OA, 
geometrically. In sexagesimal system a right angle is divided into 90 equal parts called degrees.
Each degree is divided to 60 equal parts called minutes and each minute is divided into
60 equal parts called seconds. One degree, one minute and one second are denoted by 1°,
1¢ and 1², respectively. Therefore,

DEFINITION 1.3
Radian System
The angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc whose length is equal
to the radius of the circle is called a radian and is denoted by 1c.

Figure 1.4 shows the radian system. In the following theorem, we prove that this angle is independent of the radius of 
the circle, we have considered.
THEOREM 1.1
The radian is constant, in the sense that it is independent of the radius of the circle.
PROOF
Consider a circle with centre O and radius r. Let A and B be points on the circle such that the 
length of arc AB is equal to the radius r of the circle (Figure 1.5). Then by definition,
AOB

c

Produce AO to meet the circle at C. Then AC is a diameter of the circle and the length of the arc
ABC is equal to half of the circumference of the circle. Therefore,

We know that the angles subtended at the centre of a circle are proportional to the lengths of the
arcs which subtend them. Therefore

Also, we know that the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle is always a constant 
and is denoted by p. Therefore, the circumference of any circle is equal to

the length of any diameter of the circle. From these, we have

1. The value of the constant p mentioned in Theo-
p
rem 1.1 is approximately 22/7 (= 3.1415…). In fact
p is
p
not a rational number; nor it is an alge-
braic number in the sense that p is not a root of 
p
any nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients. 
However, 22/7 or 3.1415… are only approximate
values of p.

These provide us methods to convert the measure-

3. Usually angles are measured in radians or degrees. 
For an angle having degree measure q, we write q°. 
When we do not mention the superscript °, the 
measure is considered to be in radians.

Let us consider a unit circle (a circle of unit radius) having centre at C. Let O be a point on the circle. Let CO be the
initial side of an angle. Since the radius of the circle is one unit, the length of an arc of this circle will be the radian 
measure of the angle subtended by it at the centre C. Consider the line AOB, which is the tangent to the circle at O. 
We can consider AOB as the real line with O representing the real number zero, the points towards OB representing 
positive real numbers and those towards OA representing negative real numbers. Now, if the line OB is roped in 
anticlockwise direction along the circle, then every positive real number will correspond to a radian measure and 
conversely. Similarly, if the line OA is roped in clockwise direction along the circle, then each negative real number
will correspond to a radian measure and conversely. Thus, the radian measures and real numbers are same. However, 
regarding angles, note that two different real numbers may represent the same angle; for example, p/2 and 5

Example    1.3   
Suppose that a clock shows half past 3. Find the angle
between the hours hand and the minutes hand in degrees
and radians.
Solution: From the hypothesis, the hours hand is
exactly in middle of 3 and 4 and minutes hand is at 6 
(Figure 1.7). The 12 divisions in the clock totally repre-
sent 360° and hence each division represents 30°. 
Therefore, the angle between the hours hand and the
minutes hand is 30° + 30° + 30°/2 = 75°, which is equal to

from Theorem 1.2, that

d > 0. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Therefore

Trigonometric Ratios
1.2 | Trigonometric Ratios
In this section we will define the trigonometric ratios sine and cosine as real-valued functions in the interval [0, 2p]
p
first and later extend the domain of these to the entire real line. Using the definitions of these, we define the other
trigonometric functions such as cosecant, secant, tangent and cotangent on appropriate domains.
DEFINITION 1.4
Sine and Cosine Ratios
Let q be a real number such that 0
q
£ q £ 2p. Consider a rectangular
p
coordinate system OXY. Draw a circle with centre at O and radius r > 0 in the coordinate
plane. Choose a point P on this circle such that OP makes an angle of q radians with OX,
measured in the anticlockwise sense (see Figure 1.8).
With reference to the coordinate system OXY, let (x, y) be the coordinates of the point P.
Then, we define the sine ratio of q as
sinq = y
r
and the cosine ratio of q as
cosq = x
r
First note that these ratios sinq and cos
q
q are independent of the circle and its radius
q
r. Consider Figure 1.9 in which
two circle C1 and C2
C of radius r1 and r2 are given and the points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) lie on these circles, respectively, 
such that O, P and Q are collinear.

We have discussed earlier about all the values of x for which the values of each of the trigonometric ratios sinx, cosx,
tanx, cosecx and cotx are defined. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the values of x for which these are positive
and those values of x for which they are negative.
QUICK LOOK 5
Let q be a real number such that 0
q
< q < 2p,p q ¹ p/2,
p
q ¹ p and 
p
q ¹ 3p/2. Consider a rectangular coordinate
p
system OXY, as in Definition 1.4, with O as origin. Let 
r be a positive real number. Choose a point P in the 
r
coordinate plane such that OP = r and OP makes an 
r
angle of q radians with OX measured in the anticlock-
q
wise sense. Let (x, y) be the coordinates of the point P. 
We have the following important observations. Recall
that both x and y are nonzero since q Ï{0, p/2,
p
p, 3
p

2. If p/2
p

p
the plane and hence x < 0 and y > 0, so that sinq > 0
and cosecq > 0 and all others are negative. In this 
case, we say that q lies in the second quadrant.

3. If p < q < 3p/2, then P lies in the third quadrant of 
p
the plane and hence x < 0 and y < 0, so that tanq > 0 
and cotq > 0 and all others are negative. In this case, 
q is said to be in the third quadrant.
q
4. If 3p/2
p
< q £ 2p,p then P lies in the fourth quadrant
of the plane and hence x > 0 and y < 0, so that cosq
and secq are positive and all the others are negative. 
In this case, q is said to be in the fourth quadrant. 
The angles 0, p/2, 
p

p

Now, we shall prove certain basic identities satisfied by the trigonometric functions. For convenience, we write 
f 2(x) for (f(f x))2, where f is any function.

2. The tangent of any angle is the

For these reasons, sine and cosine, tangent and cotangent, and secant and cosecant can be remembered as complementary.
From these observations, we can construct Table 1.3 containing the trigonometric ratios of certain important
angles. The reader is advised before proceeding any further to table that if he/she can memorize accurately the portion

DEFINITION 1.10
Coterminal
Two angles q and
q
f are said to be
f
coterminal if the difference between them is
l
an integral multiple of 2p or 360
p
° according as the angles are measured in radians or degrees.
The following are pairs of coterminal angles:
(1) p
2 and 5
2
p
(2) 40° and 400°
(3) 50° and -310°
Example
If q and

1.3 | Periodicity and Variance
Let us recall that a function f defined on a subset 
f
E of the real number system 
E
 is called periodic if there exists a
positive real number p such that f(f x + p) = f(f x) for all x ÎE whenever 
E
x + p is also in E. In this case, p is called a period
of f. Note that there may be several periods of the same function. For example, if 
f
p is a period of f, then
f
np is also a
period of f for any positive integer 
f
n.
DEFINITION 1.11
Let f be a function defined on a subset 
f
E of 
E
. If the set all periods of f has minimum, then
f
that minimum period is called the period of f.f
A function may possess a period, but still it may not possess the minimum period. For example, consider a constant
function f defined on any
f
E Í . Then every positive real number is a period of f and each period is a positive real

number and, evidently, there is no minimum positive real number. That is, a function may be periodic without having
the period (i.e., the minimum period).
We know that each trigonometric function is periodic and 2p is a period of each of these. In the following, we 
p
prove that each trigonometric function has minimum period.
THEOREM 1.9
The sine function is periodic and its minimum period is 2p.p
PROOF
By Definition 1.5 of the sine function, sin(2p + q)
q = sinq for all real numbers
q
q and hence 2
q
p is 
p
period of the sine function. We shall prove that any positive real number less than 2p is not a 
p
period of sine. Suppose, on the contrary, that 0 < p < 2p and 
p
p is a period of the sine function.
Put x0 = 2p - p. Then since p is a period

This implies that there is no p such that 0 < p < 2p and

2p is the minimum period of the sine function.

Similar arguments as in Theorem 1.9 yield the following theorem.
THEOREM 1.10
1. The sine, cosine, cosecant and secant functions are all periodic with minimum period 2p.p
2. The tangent and cotangent functions are periodic with minimum period p.p

Next, we discuss the variance of different trigonometric functions; that is, how does the change in value of x affects
each trigonometric ratio at x.
Recall that the domain of each of the sine and cosine is the whole real number system , while that of secant and
tangent is  - {(2n + 1)p/2,
p
n Î} and that of cosecant and cotangent is  - {np,p |n Î}. In Table 1.5 we display these 
together with the ranges (or images) of these functions.

We can plot the graph of sinx in the coordinate plane by taking angles x in radian measure on X-axis and the values of 
y = sinx on Y-axis. The graph of sinx is given in Figure 1.15. The sine curve passes through the origin and the values
of sinx vary between -1 and +1 which are, respectively, the minimum and maximum. This curve is in the shape of a
wave whose wavelength is 2p, which is nothing but the period of sin
p

of cosx are 1 and -1, respectively. Each real number in [-1, 1] is a value of cosx. The curve also looks like a wave with

Next we consider graphs of functions of the form sin(ax + b), cos(ax + b), asinbx, etc. First of all note that if p is a
period of a function f(f x), then p/|a| is a period of f(f ax + b) for any nonzero real number a and real number b; for, if 
p > 0 and f(f p

for all x Î and hence p/|a| is a period of f(f ax + b).
Further, if p is a period of f(f x), then p is also a period of af(f x) for any nonzero real number a.
(1) sin(2x + 3) is a periodic function of period 2p/|2| = p, 
p
since sinx is of period 2p.p
(2) 3cos(6x - 9) is a periodic function of period 2p/|6| =
p/3, since cos

x is of a period 2p.p
(3) 7tan(-3x) is periodic and p/|-3| = p/3 is its period,
since tanx is of period p.p
(4) 6cot(4 - 5x) is of period p/|-5| = p/5, since cotx is 
of period p.p
Examples
Graph of 3 sin 2x
The function sinx is a periodic function with period 2p and hence sin
p
2x is also a periodic function with period 
2p/|2| = p.p Therefore, 3sin2x is of period p. Also, since
p

To draw the graph of y = 3sin2x, consider the graph of y = sinx. On the X-axis change 
X
k as k/2 (e.g., p/4 for
p

p
p/2 for

Y
k as 3k (e.g., write 3 in place of 1, -3 in place of -1, 3/2 in place of 1/2, etc.).

1.4 | Trigonometric Ratios of Compound Angles
The algebraic sum of two or more angles is called a compound angle. In this section we derive formulae for the 
trigonometric ratios of compound angles.

Since cos0 = 1 and sin0 = 0, Eq. (1.1) becomes trivial if q = 0 or f = 0. Suppose that q > 0 and f > 0. 
We have to distinguish several cases.
Case I: Suppose that q + f < 2p
Consider a rectangular coordinate system OXY with O as origin. Consider the unit circle in the 
coordinate plane with centre at the origin. Let P be the point with coordinates (1, 0). Choose 
points Q, R and S on the unit circle such that PÔQ, PÔR and PÔS, measured in the anticlockwise
sense, are q, q + f and 2
f
p - f, respectively. Then the coordinates of Q, R and S are (cosq, sinq),
q
(cos(q + f), sin(q + f)) and (cos(2p - f), sin(2p - f)), respectively. Since cos(2p - f) = cosf and 
f
sin(2p - f) = -sinf, the coordinates of S are (cosf, -sinf). We will prove that PR = QS in each of 
the following three subcases under case I.
1. Suppose that q + f < p: In the triangle POR are QOS
OR = 1 = OS
OP = 1 = OQ
and
PÔR = q + f = QÔS
therefore PR = QS (Figure 1.32).

In triangles POR and QOS, we have
PÔR = 2p - (q + f) = QÔS
and OP = 1 = OQ and OR = 1 = OS. Therefore
PR = QS
Thus, in each of the three subcases under case I, we have proved that PR = QS and hence
(PR)2 = (QS)2.
Since P = (1, 0), Q = (cosq, sinq), R
q
= (cos(q + f), sin(q + f)) and S = (cos(2p - f), sin(2p - f)) =
(cosf, -sinf), it follows that

1.5 | Trigonometric Ratios of Multiple and Submultiple Angles
In the formulae for cos(x + y) and sin(x + y) if we substitute x for y, we get formulae for cos2x and sin2y
2 . If x is an
angle, then 2x, 3x, 4x, ¼ are called multiple angles of x and x/2, x/3, 2x/3, 2x/5, ¼ are called submultiple angles of x. In
this section, we derive formulae for the trigonometric ratios of multiple and submultiple angles.

Let us recall that the sine and cosine functions are periodic with minimum period 2p. Also, we have
p
-1 £ sinx £ 1  for 
all x Î and
sin p
2
1
=
and
sin 3
2
1
p = -
Therefore, 1 and -1 are the extreme values of sinx, 1 being the maximum value and -1 being the minimum value. 
Similarly, 1 and -1 are the extreme values of cosx; note that cos0 = 1 and cosp = -1.
The trigonometric functions other than cosine and sine are not bounded and hence they do not have extreme 
values. In this context, we have the following.
THEOREM 1.26 
Let a, b and c be any real numbers and

In the formulae for sinx/2 and cosx/2 in terms of sinx given in the above theorem, there are two ambiguous signs. 
In the following two examples, we have demonstrated how to determine the ambiguity in any particular case.
Example    1.30   
Find the values of sin15° and cos15°.
Solution: By taking x = 30°, we get from the proof of 
Theorem 1.27 that

°

Since sin15° and cos15° are both positive and since
cos15° > sin15°, we get that sin15° + cos15° is positive 
and sin15° - cos15° is negative. Therefore, we have
sin

1.6 | Sum and Product Transformations
In this section, we derive certain formulae through which we can transform the sum or difference of two trigonometric
ratios into products and vice versa. First we take up transformation of sum into product of trigonometric ratios.
THEOREM 1.29
The following hold good for any real numbers x and y.
1. sin(x + y) + sin(x - y) = 2sinx cosy
2. sin(x + y) - sin(x - y) = 2cosx siny
3. cos(x + y) + cos(x - y) = 2cosx cosy
4. cos(x + y) - cos(x - y) = -2sinx siny

48
Chapter 1
Trigonometric Ratios and Transformations
PROOF
This is a simple consequence of the following identities:
1. sin(x + y) = sinx cosy + cosx siny
2. sin(x - y) = sinx cosy - cosx siny
3. cos(x + y) = cosx cosy - sinx siny
4. cos(x - y) = cosx cosy + sinx siny

1.4  Period: Let f be a real valued function defined on
f
a subset E of the real number set
E
. If there exists
positive real number p such that for x and x + p
belonging to E, f(f x + p) = f(f x), then f is said to be 
f
a periodic function and p is called a period of f. f
Among the periods the least one (if it exists) is called 
the least period of f. If 
f
p is a period of f, and 
f
n is any 
positive integer then np is also a period.
1.5  Least periods of trigonometric functions:

Integer Answer Type Questions

The inverse trigonometric 
functions (or
cyclometric 
functions) are the inverse 
functions of the trigono-
metric functions, though they 
do not meet the official defi-
nition for inverse functions 
as their ranges are subsets of 
the domains of the original 
functions. Since none of the
six trigonometric functions 
are one-to-one (by failing 
the horizontal line test), they 
must be restricted in order
to have inverse functions.

Chapter 2
Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Let us recall that a function f is a bijection (injection and surjection) if and only if there is a function 
f
g such that
g
f	g
and g	f are both identity functions. In this case,
f
g is unique and is denoted by 
g
f -1. The trigonometric functions are 
not bijections, since each of them is of period 2p and hence not injective. For example, sin
p
30° = sin(2p + 30°) and 
therefore the sine function is not an injection. Neither, it is surjective, since we cannot find a real number x such that 
sinx = 2. However, by restricting the natural domain and codomain of the sine function, we can arrive at a bijection.
In this chapter, we discuss various properties of the inverses of certain trigonometric functions by first deter-
mining the appropriate domains and codomains of these functions.
2.1 | Domains and Ranges of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
We have first defined the sine function on the interval [0, 2p) and later extended it to all real numbers
p
x by defining
sinx = sinq
where x = 2np + q, 0 £ q < 2p (here n is the integral part x/2p). However, the sine function is not an injection on [0,
p
2p),
p
since sin0 = sinp and sin
p
p/4
p
= sin3p/4. Instead of interval [0, 2
p
p), if we consider the interval [
p
-p/2,
p
p/2], then the sine 
p
function is one-to-one on this interval. Also, the range of sine function is the interval [-1, 1]. Therefore, the function

The discussion made in Quick Look 1 can be extended to other trigonometric functions also. The restrictions of 
the functions cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant and cotangent restricted to [0, p], (
p
-p/2,
p
p/2), [
p
-p/2, 
p
p/2]
p
- {0}, [0, p]
p -
{p/2} and (0, 
p
p), respectively, are injections and hence can be considered as bijections onto their respective ranges.
p
Therefore, these functions have inverses which are denoted by Cos-1, Tan-1, Cosec-1, Sec-1 and Cot-1, respectively. 
The inverse trigonometric functions are also called inverse circular functions. The domains and ranges of the inverse
trigonometric functions are given in Table 2.1.

Let y be a real number and x = Tan-1y. Then tanx = y and -p/2

We shall distinguish two cases.
Case I: Suppose that y ³ 0. Then 0 £ x < p/2 and therefore 0
p

Suppose that xy ¹ 1(note that both x and y are given to be positive). Put Tan-1x = q and Tan
q

Then tanq = x and tanf = y. Since x and y are positive, both q and
q
f belong to (0,

p
0 < q + f < p

Now, suppose that xy < 1. Then, by Eq. (2.1)

PROOF
-10 = 0, the theorem is trivial if x = 0 or y = 0. Therefore, we can assume that both x and y
are positive and belong to the internal (0, 1). Put Sin-1x = q and Sin
q
-1y = f. Then sinq = x, sinf = y
and q and 
q
f Î(0, p/2). Therefore
p
cosq =
-

and
cosf =

Also, 0 < q + f < p and we have

Matrix-Match Type Questions
In each of the following questions, statements are given 
in two columns, which have to be matched. The state-
ments in Column I are labeled as
I
(A), (B), (C) and
(D), while those in Column II are labeled as
I
(p), (q),
(r), (s) and (t). Any given statement in Column I can
I
have correct matching with one or more statements in
Column II. The appropriate bubbles corresponding to
the answers to these questions have to be darkened as 
illustrated in the following example.
Example: If the correct matches are (A) ® (p), (s); (B) ®
(q), (s), (t); (C) ® (r); (D) ® (r), (t); that is if the matches
are (A) ® (p) and (s); (B) ® (q), (s) and (t); (C) ® (r); and
(D) ® (r), (t) then the correct darkening of bubbles will 
look as follows:

then a is called a root or a

solution of the equation anxn + an-1xn-1 +  + a1x + a0 = 0. If atleast one ai is nonzero, then
the equation has at most n roots. Note that if all the ai’s are zero, then every real number is a root of this equation. If 
we consider a quadratic equation, then we know from Chapter 4 of Vol. 1 that the equation has at most two roots. In 
trigonometry, we come across equations such as

where a, b, c are given real numbers. Equations of this type are called trigonometric equations and an angle q satisfying
a trigonometric equation is called a root or

Unlike polynomial equations, any trigonometric equation has infinite number of solutions, if at all there is a solu-
tion. The trivial reason is that each trigonometric function is periodic and 2p is a period. Therefore, if 
p
q is a solution of 
q
a given trigonometric equation, then q + 2np is also a solution of the same equation for every integer
p
n. In this chapter 
we discuss trigonometric equations and their solutions.
DEFINITION 3.1

p
principal
solutions.
p/6 and 5
p
p/6 are the principal solutions of the equation sin

3.1 | The Least Positive Angles with a Given Trigonometric Ratio
For any trigonometric function f and for any real number
f
a, we explore the possibility of the existence of a real 
number x such that f(f x) = a. If f is a sine function or a cosine function and 
f
a is a real number such that |a| > 1, then
clearly there is no real number x for which f(f x) = a, since the range of sine or cosine function is the interval [-1, 1] 
and hence any real number outside this interval is neither sinx nor cosx for any x Î. However, if |a| £ 1, we have 
infinite number of real numbers x for which sinx = a. Among these, there must be least positive x (recall that each 
trigonometric function is having a minimum period). In the following, we construct such least positive real numbers,
represented by angles, between 0 and 2p.p
3.1.1 Construction of Least Positive Angle whose Sine is Equal to a, | a | £ 1
Let a be a given real number with |a| £ 1. If a = 0, then clearly p is the least positive real number
p
x satisfying the
equation sinx = 0. If a = 1 or a = -1, then p/2 or 3
p
p/2 are, respectively, the least positive reals
p
x for which sinx = 1 or
sinx = -1. Therefore, we can assume that 0 < |a| < 1.
Consider a rectangular coordinate system OXY. Let A be a point on OY such that OA = a (if a is negative, the 
point A has to be chosen on YO produced, as shown in Figure 3.1).
Draw a circle of unit radius with O as the centre. Draw a line parallel to the X-axis through A meeting the circle 
at P. Draw line PB perpendicular to the X-axis through P meeting the X-axis at B. Let q be the angle 
q
BOP. Then
BP = a and OP = 1 and hence

q =

Therefore q is the required angle.

Along the X-axis, let A be a point such that OA = a. (If a is negative, then A has to be chosen on the left part of the 
X-axis). Draw a circle of unit radius with the origin O as the centre. Draw a perpendicular to X-axis at A meeting the 
circle at P and P¢, with P on the semicircle above the x-axis (Figure 3.2). Then q = AOP is the required angle, since

3.2 | General Solution of Equations of the Form sin x = a
As we have discussed earlier, for any real number a with |a| > 1, there is no real number x satisfying sinx = a or 
cosx = a. However, if |a| £ 1, there are infinite number of solutions of the equation sinx = a or the equation cosx = a.
In the following, general forms of solutions of such type of equations are discussed.
3.2.1 General Solution of the Equation sin x = 0
For x Î[0, 2p), we know that
p

Now, for any x Î, we have sinx = sin(x - 2kp), where

Since k is an integer, it follows that sinx = 0 Û x = np for any integer

sinx = 0 is x = np,p n Î, or the solution set of the equation sinx = 0 is {np|n Î}.

Note that sinx = 0 implies that cosx ¹ 0 and hence tanx is defined. On the other hand, tanx is defined; also tanx = 0

Thus the general solution of the equation sinx = a is mp + (-1)mq, m Î, where q is any real number such that sin

for example, using Section 3.1.1 we can take the least positive angle q such that sin
q
q = a or we can take Sin-1a for q.
Note: For any real number a such that |a| ³ 1 (i.e., a Î(-¥, -1] È [1, ¥)), general solution of the equation cosecx = a
is mp + (-1)mq, where q is such that cosec
q
q = a.

Note: If |a| ³ 1, the general solution of the equation secx = a is 2np ± q, n Î, where q is any solution of sec
q
x = a.
The general solution of the equation cosx = -1/2 is 2np ± (2p/3
p ), n Î since 120°(=2p/3) is a solution of cos
p
x = -1/2.
Example
Example  3.2   
Find the general solution of the equation sin2x = 1/4.
Solution: The given equation can be written as 
sinx = ±1/2. Since sinp/6
p
= 1/2, the general solution of 
sinx = 1/2 is np + (-1)n(p/6),
p
n Î.
Also, since sin(-p/6)
p
= -1/2, the general solution of 
sinx = -1/2 is np + (-1)n(-p/6). Thus the general solution

Find the general solution satisfying both the equations

Solution: Consider the equation sinx = -1/2. The only
angles between 0 and 2p that satisfy sin
p
x = -1/2 are
x = 330° = 11p/6 and 
p
x = 210° = 7p/6. Also, the only angles

between 0 and 2p that satisfy the equation

tan

are x = 30° = p/6 and
p
x = 210° = 7p/6. Therefore, the only
p
angle between 0 and 2p that satisfies both the equations 
p
sinx = -1/2 and tan

x = 1

3.3 | Solutions of Simple Trigonometric Equations
DEFINITION 3.2
Equations involving trigonometric ratios of an unknown angle are called trigonometric
equations.
An equation is not completely solved unless we obtain a general expression for all angles which satisfy it. In this 
section, we solve certain elementary types of trigonometric equations.
3.3.1 General Solution of an Equation of the Form a sin x + b cos x = c
a, b and c be any given real numbers such that a ¹ 0 or b ¹ 0. Consider the equation
a
x
b
x
c
sin
cos
+
=
Put r
a
b
=
+
2
2 . Then r > 0 (since a ¹ 0 or b ¹ 0). Suppose that |c/r| £ 1. Choose a real number q such that
q
sinq = a
r
and
cosq = b
r
Then the given equation can be written as
r
x
r
x
c
sin

cos
cos
q
q
+

that is
cos(

x

r

q
This can be solved for x, since |c/r| £ 1.
We can choose a Î[0, p] such that cos
p
a = c/r. Then x = 2np ± a + q, n Î is the general solution of the given
equation asinx + bcosx = c.
Alternate Form
The alternate form of the general solution of the above equation can be obtained as follows: Let r
a
b
=
+
2
2 and
suppose that |c/r| £ 1. Then we can choose q Î such that
cos

q
q

Then the given equation can be written as

sin
cos

q
x
x

r

that is

This can be solved for x. Since |c/r| £ 1, there exists a Î[-p/2, 
p
p/2] such that sin
p
a = c/r this
r
a is precisely Sin
a
-1(c/r).
Then x = np + (-1)na - q, n Î is the general solution of the given equation.
Example    3.6   
Solve sin

P ¹ Q.
Hence sin2x

p
x = (np/2)
p

p
these values

Dividing by cos2x (clearly cosx ¹ 0), we have
tan3x + tan2x - 3tanx - 3 = 0

Therefore Statement II is true, but Statement I is false.
Answer: (D)
Note: Since ex ® 0 as x ® -¥, the graph of y = sinx inter-
sects the graph of y = ex at infinitely many points for x < 0
and hence sinx = ex has infinitely many solutions when
x < 0.
4.  Statement I: The general solution of the equation
T
cosx + secx = 2 when x is not an odd multiple of p/2
p
is x = 2np, 
p n Î.
Statement II: cosx + secx ³ 2 for all real values of x.
Solution: Since the maximum value of cosx is 1 and
|secx| ³ 1, cosx + secx = 2 if cosx = 1 and secx = 1.
Therefore
x = 2np,p n Î
Hence Statement I is true.
Statement II is false because cosx + secx < 0 for infinitely
many values of x.
Answer: (C)
5.  Statement I: General solution of the equation 5tan4x -

Chapter 4
Properties of Triangles
The three sides and the three angles of a triangle are called the elements of the triangle. One important aspect of 
trigonometry is to find all the elements of triangle when some of its sides and angles are known. The process of finding
all the unknown elements of a triangle with the help of known elements is called solving a triangle and the values of 
the unknown elements are called solution of the triangle. It is known that when all the three angles are known, then 
the triangle is not uniquely determined. For example, each angle in an equilateral triangle is p/3 and an equilateral
p
triangle is determined by its side. In this chapter, we will be proving that a triangle is completely determined (i.e., all 
its elements are known) if any three of the six elements of the triangle, with at least one side, are known. Further, we
discuss various methods and formulae for solving a triangle.
4.1 |  Relations Between the Sides and the Trigonometric Ratios 
of Angles of a Triangle
We derive certain important formulae relating the sides of a triangle and the trigonometric ratios of the triangle 
which are useful in solving a triangle. First, let us fix certain notations. A triangle is usually denoted by DABC or 
C
simply ABC if 
C
A, B and C are vertices of the triangle. The letters 
C
A, B and C also denote angles
C
BAC, ABC and 
BCA, respectively. The lengths of the sides opposite to A, B and C are denoted by 
C
a, b and c, respectively, as shown
in Figure 4.1.
C
b
c
a
B
FIGURE 4.1
Since the secondary school level, we are familiar with the following geometrical properties of the sides and angles of 
a triangle ABC.
1. A + B + C = p = 180°. That is the sum of the three angles is p radians or 180
p
°.
2. a < b + c; b < c + a and c < a + b. That is, the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
3. a, b and c are positive real numbers.

Relations Between the Sides and the Trigonometric Ratios of Angles of a Triangle
PROOF
Consider angle A. If A is a right angle (Figure 4.5), then cosA = 0. Clearly a2 + b2 = c2 implies
a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bccosA
Therefore, we can suppose that A ¹ 90°. Now draw a perpendicular to CA through B to meet CA
at D (extend CA if necessary). Two cases arise:

THEOREM 4.3 
(PROJECTION
FORMULAE)
In any triangle ABC,
1. a = bcosC + ccosB
2. b = ccosA + acosC
3. c = acosB + bcosA
PROOF
We shall prove formula (1) in each of the following three cases.
Case I: Suppose that C = 90°. See Figure 4.9.

Then,

a
c
=

and hence a = cosB. This can be written as
a = bcosC + ccosB
since cosC = 0.
Case II: Suppose that C is an acute angle. Draw a perpendicular to 
C
BC through
C
A to meet BC
at D (Figure 4.10). Then
cosB

c
=

and therefore BD = ccosB. Also,

and hence DC = bcosC.
Therefore
a = BC = BD + DC = ccosB + bcosC

4.2 | Solution of Triangles
The three sides and the three angles of a triangle are known to be the elements of the triangle. When any three
elements with at least one side are given, then the triangle is completely known, in the sense that its other elements
can be found. When all the three angles are given, only the ratios of lengths of the sides can be found and therefore 
only the shape of the triangle can be found and not the size of the triangle. The process of calculating the values of all 
the elements of the triangle is termed as solving the triangle and the set of values of the elements is called the solution
of the triangle. In the following, we discuss the solutions of triangles in several cases.
4.2.1 Solutions of Right-Angled Triangles
Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with
C
C = 90° (Figure 4.12). Then c is the hypotenuse and A and B are acute angles
such that A + B = 90°. We need two more elements to solve the triangle ABC, in which one is necessarily a side.

c

Case 1: Suppose that the hypotenuse and one side are given
Let b be the given side and c be the given hypotenuse. Since

Chapter 4

and
A = 180° - (B + C) = 90° - B
Also, a = ccosB. Thus, we can calculate all the three sides and the three angles.
Case 2: Suppose that the two sides a and b are given
In this case
c

=

Since

Therefore B is known and

Thus all the elements of the triangle are known. The hypotenuse c can also be calculated using the formula
sin B

=
Case 3: Suppose that the angle B and the hypotenuse c are given
Then A = 90° – B and a and b can be obtained from
cos
sin
B

c
=

and
Case 4: Suppose that an angle B and one of the sides a are given
Then A = 90° – B and b is obtained from tanB = b/a. Also c can be found from the relation cosB = a/c.
Example    4.5   
The length of the perpendicular from one vertex A of a
triangle to the opposite side is 3 cm and the lengths of the 
sides for which A is the common point are 4 cm and 5 cm. 
Solve the triangle.

Solution: LetABCbe the triangle and

and
A = p - (B + C)
Also
a = BD + DC = 4cosB + 5cosC
Thus, all the three angles and three sides are found.

Solution of Triangles
Example    4.6   
Solve the right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is four
times as long as the perpendicular drawn to it from the
opposite vertex.
Solution: Let ABC be the given right angled triangle
C
with C = 90°. Let CD be the perpendicular from C to
C
AB.
Then AB is the hypotenuse. Let CD = x. Then AB = 4x.
See Figure 4.14.

Hence A = 75° or 15° and B = 15° or 75°.

and B = 15° and we are given that C = 90°. Therefore

Therefore knowing the value of b we can determine the
values of a and c. Hence, there are infinitely many trian-
gles with angles 90°, 75° and 15°, if the altitude from the 
right-angled vertex onto the hypotenuse is one-fourth of 
the hypotenuse.
Note: In the above example, the triangle can be determined provided one of the sides is given.
4.2.2 Solution of a Triangle when Three Sides are Given

triangle, B being the right angle since

DEFINITION 4.1
The circle passing through the three vertices of a triangle is called the circumcircle and its
centre and radius are called circumcentre and the circumradius, respectively.
We know that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle are concurrent and the point of concurrence is
equidistant from the vertices and hence it is the circumcentre.
THEOREM 4.15

DEFINITION 4.2
Incircle, Incentre, Inradius
The circle that touches the three sides of a triangle internally is 
called the incircle or inscribed circle of the triangle. Its centre and radius are called the incentre
and inradius, respectively, and are denoted by I and 
I
r, respectively.
It is known from Geometry that the internal bisectors of the angles of a triangle are concurrent and that the point of 
concurrence is equidistant from the sides and hence there is a circle touching all the three sides internally. Therefore, 
the point of concurrence of the internal bisectors of the angles is precisely the incentre I and the distance from
I
I to any 
I
side is the inradius r. In the following, we express the inradius in terms of the sides of the triangle.

DEFINITION 4.3
Excircles, Excentres, Exradius
Let ABC be a triangle. The circle that touches
C
BC and the 
C
extended sides AB and AC (as shown Figure 4.21) is called the 
C
excircle or escribed circle oppo-
site to the vertex A. Its centre and radius are called the excentre or escentre and exradius or 
esradius opposite to A, respectively. These are denoted by I1I  and r1, respectively. Similarly, we 
can define the escentre and esradius opposite to B and C which are denoted by 
C
I2I , r2 and I3I , r3,
respectively.
The internal bisector of the angle A and the bisectors of the external angles B and C are known to be concurrent and
C
the point of concurrence is equidistant from the three sides. This point of concurrence is precisely the excentre I1I and 
the distance from I1I  to any side is the esradius r1. In the following we derive formulae to find the exradius r1, r2 and r3
in terms of the sides of the triangle.

PROOF
Produce AB and AC to
C
L and M. Bisect the angles CBL and BCM by the lines 
M
BI1I and CI1I . These 
meet at I1I and AI1I  will be the bisector of the angle A. Draw perpendiculars I1I D1, I1I E1 and I1I F1
F to
the sides BC, AC and
C
AB, respectively.
The two triangles I1I D1B and I1I F1
F B are equal in all respects (since BI1I is the bisector of the
angle D BF

=

). Therefore I1I F1
F = I1I D1. Similarly I1I E1 = I1I D1. Therefore,
I1I D1 = I1I E1 = I1I F1
F . Hence I1I  is the centre of the escribed circle opposite to A and I1I D1 = r1. Now, the 
area of the quadrilateral ABI1I C is equal to the sum of the areas of the triangles 
C
ABI1I  and ACI1I
and is also equal to the areas of the triangles ABC and

In a triangle ABC, a = 13, b = 14 and c = 15. Find the area

Solution: We have

s = 21, s - a = 8, s - b = 7

DEFINITION 4.4
Orthocentre
In any triangle, the perpendiculars drawn from the vertices to the respective 
opposite sides are known to be concurrent and the point of concurrence is called the 
t
ortho-
centre of the triangle. Also, the triangle formed by the feet of these perpendiculars on the 
sides is called the pedal triangle of the triangle.
Let ABC be a triangle and
C
AK, BL and CM be perpendiculars drawn from
M
A, B and C to 
C
BC, CA and AB, respec-
tively. Then the perpendiculars AK, BL and CM are concurrent at a point
M
P. The point P is called the
P
orthocentre and
the triangle KLM is called the 
M
pedal triangle of the triangle ABC (Figure 4.23).

DEFINITION 4.5
Excentric Triangle
Let ABC be a triangle and
C
I1I , I2I and I3I  be centres of the escribed circles 
which are opposite to A, B and C, respectively. Then the triangle I1I I2I I3I is called the excentric 
triangle of ABC.
THEOREM 4.24
Let ABC be a triangle, 
C
I its incentre and 
I
I1I I2I I3I  be the excentric triangle of ABC. Then ABC is the 
C
pedal triangle of I1I I2I I3I  and I is the orthocentre of 
I
I1I I2I I3I (Figure 4.25).
PROOF
Let I1I , I2I  and I3I  be the centres of the escribed circles which are opposite to A, B and C, respec-
tively. I is the centre of the incircle of 
I
ABC. Then IC bisects the angle

and hence I1I CI2I is a straight line to which IC is a perpendicular. Also, since 
C
IA and I1I A both bisect 
the angle BAC, the three points I1I , I and 
I
A are collinear; that is, I1I IA is a straight line. Similarly, 
I2I IB and I3I IC are straight lines. Thus
C
I1I I2I I3I is a triangle such that A, B and C are the feet of the 
C
perpendiculars drawn from I1I , I2I  and I3I to I2I I3I , I3I I1I and I1I I2I , respectively, and further I is the point
I
of concurrence of these perpendiculars. Thus, I is the orthocenter of the triangle
I
I1I I2I I3I  and ABC
is the pedal triangle of I1I I2I I3I .

DEFINITION 4.6
Medians and Centroid
Let ABC be a triangle and 
C
D, E and 
E
F be the mid-points of 
F
BC, CA
and AB, respectively. The lines AD, BE and
E
CF are called the 
F
medians of the triangle ABC. 
These three medians are concurrent and the point of concurrence is called the centroid of the 
triangle and is usually denoted by G (Figure 4.26).

Let ABC be a triangle and 
C
O and P be its circumcentre and orthocentre, respectively. Draw
P
OD and PK perpendicular to 
K
BC. Let AD and OP meet at 
P
G. The triangles OGD and PGA are
similar. See Figure 4.28. From Theorem 4.15, we have OD = RcosA. Also, from Theorem 4.22,
AP = 2RcosA.

228
Chapter 4
Properties of Triangles
Since the triangles OGD and PGA are similar, we have
AG
GD
AP
OD
=
= 2
Therefore, the point G is the centroid of the triangle. Also
OG

OD
AP
=

Therefore, the centroid lies on the line joining the circumcentre to the orthocentre and divides it
in the ratio 1:2.

DEFINITION 4.7
Nine-point Circle
It is known that the feet of the perpendiculars, the mid-points of the sides
and the mid-points of the line joining the vertices to the orthocentre are all concyclic. The circle
passing through these nine points is called the nine-point circle
-
.
Also, it is known that the centre of the nine-point circle lies on the line joining the circumcentre O and the orthocentre
P and it bijects
P
OP. Therefore, the circumcentre, the centroid, the centre of the nine-point circle and the orthocentre
all lie on a straight line.

59.  If x > 1, then the largest angle of the triangle whose
sides are of lengths x2 + x + 1, 2x + 1 and x2 - 1 is
(A) 150°
(B) 120°
(C) 110°
(D) 135°
Solution: Let a = x2 + x + 1, b = 2x + 1 and c = x2 - 1.
Clearly, a is greater than b and c because x > 1 and also
sum of any two of a, b, c is greater than the third. Hence 
they form a triangle and “a” is the greatest side. If a is
a
the angle opposite to the side a, then

4. The sides of a triangle are 13, 14 and 15. In Column I
the inradius and the three exradii of the triangle are 
given and their values are given in Column II. Match 
these.
Column I
Column II
(A) r
(B) r1
(C) r2
(D) r3
(p) 14
(q) 21/2
(r) 4
(s) 12
(t) 19/2
Solution: Let a = 13, b = 14, c = 15. We know that
2s = a + b + c. Therefore
2s = 13 + 14 + 15 = 42
Þ s = 21
From these values we have s - a = 8, s - b = 7, s - c = 6,

In the 19th century, the 
famous mathematical physi-
cist R. Hamilton (1805–1865) 
introduced the notion of a
vector and his studies on
vectors brought out their 
importance. In recent years, 
the algebra of vectors has
become 
an 
indispensable 
tool in the study of Applied 
Mathematics, Physics and

Chapter 5
Addition and Scalar Multiplication of Vectors
In this chapter, we define the concept of vectors, their addition and two types of multiplication. Also we derive
various properties of addition and multiplication of vectors and obtain the vector equations of straight lines and 
planes.
5.1 | Deﬁnition and Classiﬁcation of Vectors
Physical quantities such as length, area, volume, mass, temperature, density, etc. possess only magnitude and are not 
related to any definite direction in space. Such quantities are known as scalar quantities or simply scalars. On the
other hand physical quantities such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, force momentum, couple, electric current, 
magnetic and gravitational intensities, etc. possess magnitude and are associated with direction in space. Such quanti-
ties are known as vector quantities or simply vectors. In this section we provide concrete mathematical definitions for 
these intuitive ideas of scalars and vectors.
The three-dimensional space is simply called the space and the points in the space are associated with ordered 
triads of real numbers, with respect to a given rectangular coordinate system. We first introduce the concept of a
directed line segment.
DEFINITION 5.1
Let A and B be two distinct points in the space. Then the ordered pair (A, B) is denoted by
AB

 



and is called the directed line segment with initial point 
t
A and terminal point B. The
straight line AB
 



is called the support of 
t
AB

 



.

FIGURE 5.1 Directed line segment.
A directed line segment AB

 



 is represented by the line segment AB with an arrow mark pointing towards B as shown 
in Figure 5.1. Note that AB

 



 is different from BA

 


, though their supports are same.
DEFINITION 5.2
Let AB

 



 be a directed line segment. The distance between A and B is called the magnitude of 
AB

 



and is denoted by |

AB

 



or simply AB.

FIGURE 5.2 Directed line segments in (a) same direction; (b) opposite direction.
Note that the line segment and the length of that line segment are denoted in the same way, namely, AB. There is
no ambiguity and one should understand as per the context. Two directed line segments AB

 



and CD

 


are said to have

299
5.1 
Deﬁnition and Classiﬁcation of Vectors
same direction if their supports AB
 



 and CD
 


 are parallel and both B and D lie in the same half-plane determined 
by the line AC
 



 [see Figure 5.2(a)]. If AB

 



 and CD

 


are parallel but do not have the same direction, then AB

 



and CD

 


are said to have opposite direction. Note that AB

 



and BA

 


 have opposite direction [see Figure 5.2(b)].
DEFINITION 5.3
Equivalence
Let DLS be the set of all directed line segments in the space. Two directed line 
segments are said to be equivalent if they have the same magnitude and the same direction.
t
The relation “being equivalent” is an equivalence relation on DLS (i.e., a binary relation which is reflexive on DLS,
symmetric and transitive) and hence partitions DLS into pair-wise disjoint classes (which are called equivalence
classes) satisfying the following properties
1. Any two directed line segments in the same equivalence class are equivalent (i.e., they have same magnitude as 
well as direction).
2. Every directed line segment belongs to exactly one equivalence class.
3. Directed line segments belonging to different equivalence classes are not equivalent.
DEFINITION 5.4
Vector
Each equivalence class discussed above is called a vector and is usually denoted by
r
  
a b c
, , , etc.
If AB

 



 is a directed line segment in the equivalence class a, then we simply write AB
a

 




= . Note that AB
CD

 




 


=
if and 
only if AB = CD and AB

 



 and CD

 


have the same direction.
If AB

 



 belongs to the vector a, then we say that AB

 



represents the vector a and in this case the magnitude of a
is defined as the magnitude AB of AB

 



 and is denoted by | |.
a
Note that AB

 



and CD

 


represent the same vector if and
only if they have same direction as well as magnitude. Two vectors a and 

b  are said to have same direction if any AB

 



representing a and any CD

 


 representing

b have same direction.
DEFINITION 5.5
Zero Vector
For any two points P and
P
Q in the space, clearly PP

 


and QQ

 



 are equivalent
and hence the collection of PP

 


 where P is a point in the space is a vector (equivalence class 
P
of directed line segments), which is called the zero vector and is denoted by
r

0.
DEFINITION 5.6
Support
For any non-zero vector a, a support of 
t
a is defined to be the support of any AB

 



representing a.
The zero vector has neither support nor direction; however, it has magnitude, namely 0, that is, | |
.

0
0
=
Note that
1. Any two supports of a non-zero vector are parallel in the space.
2. Any vector is uniquely determined by its direction and magnitude but not its support.
DEFINITION 5.7
Unit Vector
A vector of magnitude one unit is called a unit vector. If a is a non-zero vector
and e  is a unit vector having the same direction as a, then e  is called a unit vector in the direc-
tion of a (Figure 5.3).

DEFINITION 5.8
Collinear, Like and Unlike Vectors
Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they have
r
parallel or same supports. Two collinear vectors are said to be like or unlike vectors according
as they have the same direction or opposite direction.
In Figure 5.4(a) a and

b  are like vectors and in Figure 5.4(b) a and

b  are unlike vector as they are collinear and have
opposite direction.

Coplanar and Non-coplanar Vectors
A set of vectors is said to be coplanar if their supports
r
are in the same plane or parallel to the same plane. Vectors which are not coplanar are called
non-coplanar.
Note that any two vectors are always coplanar. Further, three vectors

5.2 | Addition of Vectors
In this section we define the notion of addition of two vectors and derive various properties of vectors involving addi-
tion. Before going for the definition of addition, we shall first have the following theorem.
THEOREM 5.1

b be two vectors and O, A, B, O1, A1 and B1 be points such that

Addition of Vectors
Also, the lines OA and O1A1 are parallel and so are the lines AB and A1B1. Therefore OO1 A1A
and AA1 B1B are parallelograms (Figure 5.5) and
OO

Thus OO1B1B is a parallelogram, so that OB = O1B1 and hence

Note: a and 

b  are collinear if and only if O, A, B and O1, A1, B1 are collinear, and, in this case, O, A, B, O1, A1 and 
B1 lie on the same line.
DEFINITION 5.10
Resultant Vector
Let a and

b be vectors and O, A and B be points such that OA
a

AB
b

is defined to be the vector OB

a
b

 is also called the resultant
vector of 
r

b.
DEFINITION 5.11
Triangle Law for Addition
The equation

DEFINITION 5.12
Parallelogram Law for Addition
If

b
OC

complete the triangle in Figure 5.6 to form the parallelogram OABC (Figure

Note: In view of the Theorem 5.1, the sum

The addition of vectors is defined to be a binary operation, in the sense that given two vectors a and 

b, we have 
defined the vector 

a

 and proved in Theorem 5.2 that 



a

b

addition.
If  
a b
,
 and c are three given vectors, the expression 


a

c
+
+
has no meaning right now, since
g
+ is defined only 
between two vectors. However, (
)



a

c

a

a

c

(
) is 
meaningful, since it is the sum of a and

2. For each vector a, there is a unique vector

PROOF
Recall that for any points A and B, the vectors AA

5.3 | Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
Multiplication of a vector by a positive integer is only a repeated addition. In Definition 5.16, we have defined the
product na  for any integer n and a vector a. In this section we extend multiplication of vectors by integers to that by
any real number.
DEFINITION 5.17
Let r be any real number and
r
a any vector.
1. ra is defined to be 

0 if r = 0 or 

a = 0.
2. If r > 0 and 

a ¹ 0,  then ra is defined to be the vector whose magnitude is r a| | and direc-
tion is same as that of a.
3. If r < 0 and a ¹ 0, then ra is defined as (
)(
),
-
-
r
a
which is the vector with the magnitude 
(
)| |
-r
a and the direction same as -a, or equivalently, the direction is opposite to that of a.
Note that Definition 5.17 coincides with Definition 5.16 when r is an integer. The following is an immediate conse
r
-
quence of Definition 5.17.

Therefore, r sa

and ( )
rs a have same magnitude. If rs > 0, then (r > 0 and s > 0) or (r < 0 and 
s < 0) and hence both of r sa
(
)
  and ( )
rs a have the same direction as that of a. If rs < 0, then (r > 0
and s < 0 or r < 0 and s > 0) both of r sa
(
)
 and ( )
rs a have the same direction which is opposite to 
that of a.
Therefore, in all cases, r sa
(

  and ( )
rs a have same direction. Thus r sa

DEFINITION 5.18
A vector a is said to be unit vector if its magnitude is the unit

a a

For any non-zero vectors a and

5.4 | The Division Formula
Given two points A and B whose position vectors with respect to a point O are a and

b, we derive a formula for the
position vector of any point on the line joining A and B, in terms of the vectors a and

b and the ratio in which the 
point divides the line segment AB.
THEOREM 5.12
Let a and 

b  be the position vectors of two points A and B, respectively, with respect to a point O. 
Then a point C lies on the line

Conversely, suppose that A, B and C are collinear (Figure

Put AB = t and

C

5.5 | Components of a Vector
Given any three non-coplanar vectors  
a b

linear combination of  
a b
,
and c  uniquely which facilitates us in representing any vector by a triad of real numbers. 
In particular, when the given vectors  
a b
,
 and c are pairwise perpendicular, we have several advantages of the repre-
sentation of vectors by triads of real numbers.
THEOREM 5.20
Let

of real numbers such that

Then, by Theorem 5.20, x is a linear combination of

Components of a Vector

b are two vectors, we can choose points
O, A and B such that OA

b is defined to be the smaller angle AOB
and is denoted by ( , ).
 
a b  However, we have to prove that the angle between a and 

b  does not depend on the choice
of O, A and B. This is proved in the following.

Case I: Suppose that a and 

b are parallel. Then O, A and B are collinear and O1, A1 and B1 are also
collinear. If a and

and similarly AO B

Case II: Suppose that a and

and B1 are also not collinear, as shown in Figure 5.27. Since OA

Answer: (A)
Note: With circumcentre as origin of reference, the
position vector of the orthocentre is sum of the position 
vectors of the vertices of the triangle. Equivalently, in the 
Argand’s plane (complex numbers), if the circumcentre
of a triangle is the origin of the coordinate axes, then the 
complex number representing the orthocentre is the sum
of the complex numbers representing the vertices.

Assertion–Reasoning Type Questions
In the following set of questions, a Statement I is given
and a corresponding Statement II is given just below it.
Mark the correct answer as:
(A) Both Statements I and II are true and Statement II 
is a correct explanation for Statement I
(B) Both Statements I and II are true but Statement II 
is not a correct explanation for Statement I
(C) Statement I is true and Statement II is false
(D) Statement I is false and Statement II is true
1. Statement I: Let ABCD be a trapezium in which AB
and DC are parallel sides. The diagonals
C
AC and
C
BD
intersect in O. If M and
M
N are the mid-points of 
N
AB
and CD, then M, O, N are collinear.
N
Statement II: If a and 

b  are non-collinear vectors
(i.e., not parallel), then every vector r  in the plane of 
a and

b can be expressed as 


r
xa
yb
=

where x and 
y are scalars uniquely.
Solution: Statement II is Theorem 5.15. Take the point
O as origin and let OA

Statement II: Three vectors are linearly dependent if 
and only if one of them is a linear combination of the
other two vectors.
Solution: Proof of Statement II: Suppose

5.5  Equivalent directed line segments: Two directed
line segments AB

are said to be equivalent
if they have same direction and same magnitude.

Define relation R on S as
S

 and CD

 


are equivalent}
Then R is an equivalence relation in S, which divides
S into equivalence classes having the following three
properties.
(1) Every directed line segment must belong to
exactly one equivalence classes.
(2) Any two directed line segments belonging to the 
same equivalence class are equivalent (i.e., same
direction and same magnitude).
(3) Directed line segments belonging to different
equivalence classes are not equivalent.
t
Note: For the above theorem see Chapter 1 of Volume 1.
5.7  Vector: Each equivalence class discussed in the 
above theorem is called a vector. Usually we denote
vectors by     
a b c r p
, , , ,

QUICK LOOK
(i) Vector a means it is an equivalence class of all 
equivalent directed line segments.
(ii) Vector a can be represented by any directed line 
segment AB

 



 belonging to the equivalence class 
a. For example, if AB

 



belongs to a, then we
write

AB

 



(iii) Two directed line segments AB

same direction and same magnitude.
5.8  Zero vector or null vector: The collection of all
directed line segments PP

 


, where P is any point from 
P
a vector is called zero vector and is denoted by 

0.

Zero vector has no direction and has zero magnitude.
We can consider

0 in any direction.
5.9  Support of a: The support of any directed line 
segment AB

 



 belonging to a is considered to be the
support of a.
5.10  Unit vector: The equivalence class of all equivalent
directed line segments of magnitude 1 is called unit
vector.
5.11  Parallel or collinear vectors: Two vectors a and 

b
are said to be collinear vectors (parallel vectors) if 
any support of a is parallel to any support of 

b.
5.12  Like and unlike vectors: Two collinear vectors are
said to be like or unlike vectors according as they
have the same direction or opposite directions.
The vectors a and

b  in the figure below are like 
vectors.

5.13  Unit vector in the direction of a:  If a non-zero
vector a and a unit vector e  are like vectors, then 
e  is said to be unit vector in the direction of a.
5.14  Coplanar and non-coplanar vectors: A set of 
vectors (or collection of vectors) are said to be
coplanar vectors if their supports are in the same
plane or parallel to the same plane, Vectors which
are not coplanar are called non-coplanar.

(i) Two vectors are collinear if and only if they are 
linearly dependent.
(ii) Three vectors are coplanar if and only if they are

(iii) In the three-dimensional space the maximum
number of linearly independent vectors (the 
vectors may change) is three. That is, more than
three vectors are linearly dependent.
(iv) If a finite set of vectors contains zero vector then 
they are linearly dependent.

Chapter 6
Multiplication of Vectors
In the previous chapter, we have discussed the operations of addition of vectors and multiplication of vectors by scalars. 
In this chapter, we consider two more important operations on vectors, namely, scalar product (or dot product) and
vector product (or cross product) and discuss certain applications and properties of these. These will be used to derive 
vector equations of a plane in several forms.
6.1 | Scalar or Dot Product
In this section, we introduce the concept of scalar product or dot product of two vectors and present a geometrical 
interpretation which will be used in deriving the vector equation of a plane in the normal form and the orthogonal
projection of a vector on another vector. Let us begin with the following.
DEFINITION 6.1
Let a and 

b be vectors. Then we define
and

| || | cosq
where q is the angle between the vectors 
q

  
a
b a b
and
.
× is called the dot product of 

a
b
and , just
because a dot ×is used here. Since 
×
 
a b
× is defined as a scalar, it is also called the scalar product 
of 

a
b
and .
For any two vectors  
a b
,
let us recall that the angle between 

a
b
and
is denoted by ( , )
 
a b  (see Definition 5.22, 
Chapter 5) and we note that

for any non-zero vectors

a

or
 is a zero vector, then clearly by Definition 6.1 we have

× =

0
and therefore, for any two vectors 

a
b
and ,
 
 
a b
b a
× =
×
That is, the scalar product operation is commutative. However, we cannot talk on the associativity of this operation, 
since  
a b
× is scalar and hence (
)
 

a b c
× × is not defined whereas (
)
  
a b c
×
 has meaning according to the concept of multi-
plication of a vector with a scalar.

Multiplication of Vectors
6.2 | Vector Equations of a Plane and a Sphere
Using vector addition and multiplication of a vector by a scalar we have derived vector equations of a straight line and
a plane in the previous chapter. In this chapter, using dot product of vectors, we derive vector equation of a plane at 
a given distance from the origin and perpendicular to a given vector.
THEOREM 6.13
The equation of the plane, whose unit normal drawn away from the origin is n and whose distance 
from the origin is a, is given by
 
r n
a
.
=
This is called the equation of a plane in normal form.
PROOF
See Figure 6.13. Let R be an arbitrary point in the required plane and the position vector of R
with respect to the origin O be r. Let a perpendicular be drawn from the origin to the plane to
meet the plane at N. Then RN

 



is perpendicular to ON

 



. Since the distance from the origin to the 
required plane is given to be a, we have

Equation of the plane passing through the origin and perpendicular to the unit vector n is

PROOF
The proof follows from Theorem 6.13 and the requirement that the plane passes through the 
origin and hence the distance from the origin to the plane is zero.

If R = (x, y, z) with respect to an orthogonal system of

a is a fixed

P
CP = a is called the sphere with centre at

DEFINITION 6.3
Let
1 and 
2 be two planes and n1 and n2 be unit normals to
1 and 
2, respectively. Then
the angle between n1 and n2 is called the angle between
1 and 
2.

QUICK LOOK 7
Since a given plane has two different unit normals (one 
is opposite to the other), angle between a given pair of 
planes is not unique. In general, there are two angles 
between a given pair of planes. If q is one of them, then
q
p
q is the other. If

Multiplication of Vectors
We have proved earlier that the dot product is commutative in the sense that  
 
a b

× =

b.
The vector product is not commutative, that is, 

a
b may not be equal to


b
a. However, we have the following.
THEOREM 6.19
For any vectors a and

b,




a

That is,

Therefore, we can assume that a and

q
angle between a and 

b and n be the unit vector perpendicular to both a and

PROOF
All these equalities hold good trivially if 

a = 0 or

b = 0 or a and

b  are collinear or l = 0 or m = 0.
Therefore we can assume that a and 

b are non-zero non-collinear vectors and l and
l
m are non-
zero scalars. Let q be the angle between 
q
a and 

b  and n be the unit vector perpendicular to both

Note: The above proof is apparently involved and complicated. We offer an alternate proof later (see Theorem 6.45)
which is elegant and simple. The strength of the above proof is that it is direct from the definition of the vector product.
Next, we derive a simple formula for the vector product of two vectors in terms of their components in the direc-
tions of an orthogonal right-handed system of unit vectors. First, let us have the following.

6.4 | Vector Areas
The orientation of a closed curve is usually denoted by an ordered trial of non-collinear points on the curve as indi-
cated in Figure 6.19. Consider the plane region D bounded by a closed curve described in the anticlockwise sense.
It is indicated by the ordered trial (P1, P2, P3) of points on it (see figure (a) below). In the figure (b), the region D is 
bounded by a curve described in the clockwise sense and it is indicated by the ordered trial (P1, P3, P2). While the area 
of the region D is independent of the orientation of the bounding curve, the vector area depends on the orientation
of the bounding curve, as we see from the definition given below.

1. For any plane region, there will be two vector areas
and they are opposite to each other.
2. The magnitude of the vector area of the plane region 
is the usual area of the region and its direction is 
perpendicular to the plane of the region.

PROOF
Suppose that  
a b
,
and c  are coplanar. Since 

a
b is perpendicular to the plane determined by 
a and 

b, it follows that 

a
b is perpendicular to c and hence
(
)



a
b c× = 0
Conversely, suppose that (
)
.



a
b c× = 0  Then 

a
b is perpendicular to c. But, by the definition 
of 

a
b, we have that 

a
b is perpendicular to both a and 

b. Therefore 

a
b is perpendicular
to  
a b

 and c. Thus

we obtain vector equation of a plane using dot, cross and scalar triple products. Also, we introduce the concept of 
skew lines and derive a formula for the shortest distance between two skew lines. In the following, we fix a point O as
the origin of reference and adopt the notation that A a
( )
  is a point, that is, a is the position vector of a point A with 
respect to the origin O. Let us first prove the following.

DEFINITION 6.7
Skew Lines
Two lines in the space are said to be skew lines if there is no plane containing
both the lines.
Note that if two lines intersect, then there is a plane containing both of them and hence they are not skew lines. 
Therefore, two skew lines have no common point. However, they will have a common perpendicular. In the following
we prove that any two skew lines have a common perpendicular and derive a formula to find its length.
THEOREM 6.43
Let L1 and L2 be two skew lines. Then there exists unique pair (P, Q) of points with P on
P
L1 and 
Q on L2 such that PQ is perpendicular to both L1 and L2.
PROOF
Let A a
( )
  and C c
( )
  be points on L1 and L2, respectively, and let 

b and

d be parallel to L1 and L2,
respectively (Figure 6.27). Then the equations of L1 and L2 are

Therefore, PQ

 


 is perpendicular to 

b  and hence to L1 (since 

b  is parallel to L1). Similarly, using
Eq. (6.8), we can prove that PQ is perpendicular to L2.
Next, we will prove that P and
P
Q are unique. If P  and Q are points on L1 and L2, respectively, 
such that P Q






is perpendicular to both L1 and L2, then the corresponding scalars s and t  satisfy 
Eqs. (6.7) and (6.8). By the uniqueness of (s1, t1) it follows that

P = P and 
P
Q = Q. Thus P and
P
Q
are unique on L1 and L2, respectively, such that PQ

■
Note that, if P  and Q  are points on L1 and L2 respectively, then PQ

between L1 and L2.

Vector Triple Product

The concept of scalar triple product of three vectors is introduced in the previous section and using this we have 
derived equations of a plane in different forms. In this section we introduce the notion of the vector triple product of 
three vectors and discuss certain properties.

From Eqs. (6.91) and (6.92) t = +2, s = 0 which also satisfy

Chapter 7
Probability
Probability is a measure of uncertainty and deals with the phenomenon of chance or randomness. We quite often 
make unknowingly some decisions about probability. For example, when one leaves his house in the morning on a
cloudy day he may decide to take an umbrella with him, even if it is not raining, because he thinks that it may rain
later in the day.
The theory of probability is developed to explain such kind of decisions mathematically. Infact, the theory of 
probability has its origins in gambling and games of chance. It is known that a French gambler Chevalier de Mere
approached a French mathematician Blaise Pascal for a solution of a problem concerning gambling. Pascal gave a 
solution and subsequently he corresponded with another French mathematician Pierre de Farnat and established 
the foundations of the theory of probability. Later Laplace, a French scientist, made first attempt towards giving
some mathematical rigour to the subject of probability. The present day theory of probability is credited to Andrei 
Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, a 20th century Russian probabilist, who laid the set theoretic foundations of probability.
7.1 | Random Experiments and Events
In this section we define certain important elementary technical terms related to probability and discuss some exam-
ples concerning these. Let us begin with the following.
DEFINITION 7.1
Random Experiment
A random experiment is an experiment in which
1. The experiment can be repeated any number of times under identical conditions.
2. All possible outcomes of the experiment are known in advance.
3. The actual outcome in a particular experiment is not known in advance.
(1) Rolling of an Unbiased Die
Rolling of an unbiased die is a random experiment in 
which all the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, if 
we denote the six faces of the die with the numbers 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5 and 6. The faces of the die may also contain dots
in numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. In any case, we identify 
the faces of a die with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
The actual outcome in a particular experiment (rolling 
of the die) is the number that appears on the upper-
most face of the die and this is not known in advance. 
This experiment can be performed any number of times
under identical conditions.
(2) Tossing of an Unbiased Coin
Tossing of an unbiased coin is a random experiment in
T
which there are only two possible outcomes, namely, Head
(H) and Tail (T). In a particular experiment (tossing of the
coin), the outcome is not known in advance. This experiment
can also be performed any number of times under iden-
tical conditions and therefore this is a random experiment.
Examples
“Tossing of an unbiased coin till tail appears” is also a random experiment. However, experiments such as 
“measuring the acceleration due to gravity using a compound pendulum” is not a random experiment, since the 
experiment cannot be repeated under identical conditions and the possible outcomes are not known in advance.
Throughout this chapter, by a coin or die we always mean an unbiased coin (or a fair coin) or unbiased die (or a
fair die) unless otherwise mentioned.
DEFINITION 7.2
Some of the important definitions are as follows:
1. A set of possible outcomes of an experiment is called an event.
2. Two or more events are said to be exhaustive if the performance of the experiment always
results in the occurance of atleast one of them.
3. Two or more events are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurance of one of the events
prevents the occurance of any of the remaining events.
4. Two or more events are said to be equally likely (or equiprobable) if there is no reason to
expect one of them in preference to others.

491
7.2
Classical Deﬁnition of Probability
In rolling of a die, consider the events:
E1: occurrence of an even number (that is, an 
even number appears on the upper most 
face)
and
E2: occurrence of an odd number.
Then
T
E1 and E2 are exhaustive, mutually exclusive and 
equiprobable.
Example
If a coin is tossed, “the occurrence of Head” and “the occurrence of Tail” are exhaustive, mutually exclusive and
T
equiprobable.
Example
Example     7.1   
Consider the experiment of “throwing a pair of dice and 
finding the sum of the two numbers that show up (on the 
upper most faces).” The possible outcomes (events) are
numbers 2 to 12 (i.e., a + b where 1 £ a £ 6 and 1 £ b £ 6).
These events are exhaustive and mutually exclusive, but
not equiprobable. Why?
Solution: These sums are not equally likely, as we can
observe from the following table.
The sum 12 occurs only once, the sum 10 appears
thrice and hence “the sum 12 occurs” and “the sum 10 
occurs” are not equiprobable (or equally likely).

Example     7.2   
In rolling of a die, consider the events
E1: occurrence of an even number
E2: occurrence of a prime number
and
E3: occurrence of 1
Then E1, E2 and E3 are exhaustive, but not mutually
exclusive. Why?
Solution: This is because 2 occurs in both E1 and E2 as
it is both even and prime.
7.2 | Classical Deﬁnition of Probability
In the following we give a classical definition of probability and discuss certain examples.
DEFINITION 7.3
Suppose that in a random experiment there are n exhaustive, mutually exclusive and equi-
probable possible outcomes. If m of them are favourable to the happening of an event E, 
then the probability of occurance of E (or simply the 
E
probability of E) is defined as m/n and is 
denoted by P(E). That is,
P E
m

( ) =
Clearly 0 £ P(E) £ 1.

Chapter 7
Probability
Note that since the number of outcomes not favourable to an event E is
E
n - m, the probability of non-occurance of 
the event E is (
E
n - m)/n and is denoted by P(Ec). That is,

Example     7.3   
Suppose that an integer is picked from among 1 to 20 
(both inclusive). What is the probability of picking a 
prime?
Solution: There are 20 outcomes of the experiment
of picking an integer. The primes between 1 and 20 are 
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19 and these are 8 in number. 
Therefore, 8 are favourable to the event of picking a
prime and hence the probability of picking a prime is
8

Example     7.4   
Suppose that 8 dice are thrown. Find the probability that
none of the dice shows 3 (on the upper most face).
Solution: Any outcome of “throwing 8 dice” can be
expressed as an 8-tuple of integers from 1 to 6 and hence
the total number of possible outcomes is 68.
An outcome that none of the dice shows 3 can be
expressed as 8-tuple of integers from the 5-element set 
{1, 2, 4, 5, 6} and there are 58 such outcomes. Thus, the
probability that none of the dice shows 3 is

Example     7.5   
Suppose that a bag contains 6 red, 5 black and 4 blue 
balls. Find the probability that three balls drawn simul-
taneously are one blue, one black and one red.
Solution: The total number of balls is
6 + 5 + 4 = 15
Out of these 15 balls, 3 balls can be drawn in 15C3 ways.
Therefore, 3 balls can be drawn simultaneously in

Out of these 30 integers, 15 are odd and 15 are even

7.2.1 Limitations of the Classical Deﬁnition
1. If the outcomes of a random experiment are not equally likely, the probability of an event in such an experiment 
cannot be found. For example, the probability of a student passing an examination is not 1/2 as the outcomes of 
success and failure in the examination are not equally likely.
2. If the random experiment contains infinitely many outcomes, then the classical definition cannot be applied for 
the probability of an event in such an experiment. For example, tossing a coin until Head appears is a random 
experiment in which there are infinite number of outcomes, namely all finite sequences of H’s and T’s (Heads and 
Tails). The classical definition gives no answer for finding the probability that the Head never appears before 100th 
tossing.
We have noticed certain limitations and deficiencies in the classical defination of probability. In order to over-
come one of these limitations, we now give the following definition which is known as the statistical (or 
l
empirical or
l
relative frequency) definition of probability.
DEFINITION 7.4
Let E be an event of a random experiment. Let the experiment be repeated
E
n times out of 
which E occurs
E
mn times. Then the ratio
r
m
n
n
n
=
is called the nth relative frequency of the event E. Clearly 0 £ mn £ n and hence 0 £ rnr £ 1. If 
{rnr } is a convergent sequence, then its limit is defined to be the probability of E and is denoted
E
by P(E). That is,
P E
r
m
n

It can be easily seen that 0 £ P(E) £ 1, since 0 £ rnr £ 1 for all n ÎZ+
Z .
One can easily observe the following deficiencies in the above statistical definition of probability
1. Repeating a random experiment infinitely many times is impossible.
2. The sequence of relative frequencies must be assumed to be convergent, which may not be true all the time.

7.3 | Axiomatic Approach to Probability
We have noticed certain shortcomings and deficiencies both in the classical definition (Definition 7.3) and the statis-
tical definition (Definition 7.4). In order to overcome these shortcomings and deficiencies, a Russian probabilist 
A.N. Kolmogorov has proposed an axiomatic approach to probability. Before going to this, first let us have certain 
basic definitions.
DEFINITION 7.5
1. An outcome of a random experiment is called an elementary event or 
t
simple event.
2. The set of all outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space associated with
the experiment. In other words, when x is a random experiment and
x
S is the sample space
associated with x, then every element of S is an outcome of x and any performance of 
x
x
results in an outcome that corresponds to exactly one element of S.
DEFINITION 7.6
Some important terms are:
Let S be the sample space associated with a random experiment x.
1. The elements of S are called the sample points or elementary events of x.
2. A subset E of 
E
S is called an event. That is, a set of elementary events is called an event.
3. An event E is said to 
E
happen or occurs if an outcome of the experiment x belongs to 
x
E.
4. Otherwise, we say that E does not happen or E does not occur.
5. The empty set f and the whole set 
f
S, being subsets of S, are called impossible event and
t
certain (or sure) event, respectively.
6. The complement of the event E is the event given by
E
S-E and is denoted by
E
Ec or E. Such 
event called the complementary event of 
t
E. Usually Ec is denoted by E.
Let x be the experiment of rolling a die. Then the sample 
x
space of x is the set 
x
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, where the integers
denote the faces of the die. “Occurrence of a positive
integer £6 on the uppermost face of the die” is a sure 
event, “occurrence of a positive even integer £6 on the
uppermost face of the die” is an event and “occurrence 
of a prime ³6 on the uppermost face of the die” is an
impossible event.
Example
DEFINITION 7.7
1. A set S is set to be countably infinite if it is bijective with the set + of positive integers and,
in this case we can write S = {s1, s2, …, sn, …}.
2. A set S is said to be finite if S is empty or S is bijective with the set {1, 2, …, n} for some
n Î+ and in this case we write S = {s1, s2, …, sn} and say that S is an n-element set or the
t
number of elements in S is n.
3. A set S is said to be atmost countable is S is either finite or countably infinite. For example 
+,  are countably infinite sets.
Note that the sample space S of a random experiment x may be finite or infinite. Throughout our discussions in this 
x
chapter, we take the sample space S of an experiment to be atmost countable; that is, either finite or countably infinite. 
For example, the sample space in Examples (1) and (2) below Definition 7.1 are finite and that of the experiment
“Tossing a coin till tail appears” is countably infinite.
DEFINITION 7.8
Let E1, E2, …, En be some events of a random experiment x. That is, E1, E2, …, En are subsets
of the sample space S of x.
1. The events E1, E2, …, En are said to be mutually exclusive if Ei Ç Ej
E = f for all
f
i ¹ j; that is, 
if the happening of an event Ei prevents the happening of any other event Ej
E , j ¹ i.
2. The events E1, E2, …, En are said to be equiprobable or equally likely if there is no reason 
to expect one of them to happen in preference to others.

Axiomatic Approach to Probability
3. The events E1, E2, …, En are said to be exhaustive if E1 È E2 È  È En = S; that is, if the 
performance of the experiment always results in the occurrence of at least one of Ei’s.
Note that for any random experiment x whose sample space is
x
S, the set of all possible events of x is
x
Ã(S), the power
set of S (the set of all subjects of S). In the following we introduce Kolmogorov’s axiomatic approach to the theory of 
probability.
DEFINITION 7.9
Let x be a random experiment and
x
S its sample space and suppose that S is finite. Then a func-
tion P:Ã(S) ®  is called a probability function if it satisfies the following conditions.
1. Positive axiom: P(E) ³ 0 for all E ÎÃ(S)
2. Completeness axiom: Ã(S) = 1
3. Union axiom: If E1 and E2 ÎÃ(S) and E1 Ç E2 = f, then

In this case, for any E ÎÃ(S), P(E) is called the probability of the event E. If E = {s}, then we
write P(s) for P({s}) for simplicity. In the case when S is countably infinite, we have to replace
(3) above by (3¢) given below.

A pack of cards means a pack containing 52 cards, out 
of which 26 are with red figures and another 26 are 
with black figures. These 52 cards are divided into 4 
sets, namely Hearts (in red colour), Diamonds (in red
colour), Spades (in black) and Clubs (in black). Each set
consists of 13 cards labelled as
A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K
where A is Ace, J is Jack, Q is Queen, K is King. Find 
the probability of drawing an ace or a spade from a well-
shuffled pack of 52 cards.
Solution: Let E1 and E2 be the events of drawing an
ace and drawing a spade, respectively. Then we have to
find P(E1 È E2). Note that E1 and E2 are not mutually 
exclusive, since there is a spade in aces. In fact, E1 Ç E2
has exactly one member. Note that

If two numbers are selected randomly from 30 consecu-

the two numbers is
(a) even.
(b) odd.
Solution: Two numbers can be selected from 30 in
30C2 = 435 ways. Since the given 30 numbers are consecu-
tive, there are 15 even and 15 odd numbers among them.
(a) For a + b to be even, it is necessary and sufficient 
that either both a and b are even or both odd. There 
are 15C2 + 15C2 such ways. Therefore the probability
that the sum of the two numbers selected is even is

A bag contains 20 identical balls of which 8 are black and
12 are blue. Three balls are taken out at random from 
the bag one after the other without replacement. Find
the probability that all the three balls drawn are blue.
Solution: The probability that the first ball drawn is blue 
is 12/20, since there are 12 blue balls among 20 balls in the
bag. If the first ball is blue, then the probability that the 
second ball drawn is blue is 11/19, since 11 of  the remaining

Independent and Dependent Events

A jar contains 10 white balls and 6 blue balls, all are of

Find the probability that the second ball is white if it is 
known that the first is white.

white” and E2 be the event “the second ball drawn is 
white again. Then,

DEFINITION 7.12
Let x be a random experiment and 
x
S its sample space. Let P be a probability function on
P
Ã(S). Two events A and B are said to be independent of each other if the occurrence of one
r
of them does not influence the occurrence of the other. That is, B is independent of A if
P B
P B A
( )
(

If A and B are not independent, then we say that they are dependent.
THEOREM 7.5
The following are equivalent to each other for any two events A and B of a random experiment.
1. A and B are independent of each other.
2. P(B) = P(B/A

Example     7.17   
A bag contains 20 balls out of which 10 balls are white 
and others are black. Two balls are drawn from the
bag at random with replacement. Let A be the event
“first ball drawn is white” and B be the event “second
ball drawn is white”. Verify whether A and B are
independent.
Solution: It is given that the first ball drawn is 
replaced before drawing the second ball. Therefore, 
there are 20 ´ 20 ways to draw the two balls, of which 
10 ´ 20 have the property that the first ball is white.
Therefore,

7.5 | Random Variables and Probability Distributions
In this section we define the concepts of random variables and probability distributions and discuss certain important
properties of these. First we define a random variable which quantifies the events of a sample space of a random 
experiment.
DEFINITION 7.13
Let S be the sample space of a random experiment. Then any real-valued function defined on
S
S is called a
S
random variable on S. That is, a random variable of S is simply a function
S
J:S ® R.
(1) Let S be the sample space of the experiment 
“rolling a fair die”. That is, 
T
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Define
J:S ®  by
J( )s
s
s
=
ì
íï
îï

0
if
is even
if
is odd
That is, 
T
J(1) = J(3) = J(5) = 0 and J(2) = J(4) =
J(6) = 1. Then J is a random variable on 
J
S.
(2) Let S be the sample space of the experiment “tossing
a fair coin”. That is, S = {H, T}, where 
T
H = Head and 
T = Tail. Define J:S ® R by
J
J
(
)
( )
H
T
=
=
1
0
and
 
Then J is a random variable on
J
S.
(3) Let S be the sample space of the experiment “tossing 
three fair coins simultamously”.
Then
S = {
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
}
HHH HHT HTH HTT THH THT TTH TTT
Define J:S ® R by
J(s) = The number of heads in s
For example,J(HHH) =3,J(HHT) = 2,J(THT) = 1,
J(TTT) = 0. Then J is a random variable on 
J
S.
Examples
For any random experiment x and its sample space 
x
S, we prove in the following that any probability function on 
Ã(S) and a random variable on S give rise to a probability function on P().

Let S be the sample space of a random experiment. Let P:Ã(S) ®  be a probability function

T = P(J-
J 1(T))

for any T Í ,
where J-
J 1(T)

DEFINITION 7.16
A random variable whose range is atmost countable (i.e., finite or countably infinite) is 
called a discrete random variable. A random variable which is not discrete is called a contin-
uous random variable.
The random variables given in all the above examples are discrete. Though there are certain continuous random 
variables, we confine our discussion to the discrete random variables only. In the following we introduce the notions 
of mean, variance, standard deviation and probability distribution of discrete random variables.

7.6 | Theoretical Discrete Distribution
In this section, we discuss certain probability distributions in which the variables are distributed according to some 
definite probability law that can be expressed mathematically. In particular, binomial distributions and Poisson distri-
butions are of special importance.
A random variable X which takes just two values 0 and 1 with the probabilities 
X
p and q, respectively, is of partic-
ular interest. In this case, note that

and
Quite often we come across such random variables. For example, in coin tossing experiment, we can define P(H)
H = p
and P(T)
T = 1 - p, for some 0 < p < 1 and the random variable X can be defined by 
X
X(
X H)
H = 1 and X(
X T)
T = 0, so that

and
Each repetion of such an experiment is called a trial.
7.6.1 Binomial Distribution
Let E and
E
Ec be two complementary events in a random experiment with probabilities p and q, respectively. Let us call
the occurrence of the event E as a 
E
success and the occurrence of the event Ec as a failure in a trial. If the experiment is 
repeated n times and Ek is the event having k successes in these trials, then one of these cases is “E occurs in the first 
E
k trials, Ec occures in the remaining n - k trials”. The required probability for such an event is pk qn-k.
However the number of such cases is

Thus

Let X denote the number of successes in these

DEFINITION 7.18
A random variable X is said to follow
X
binomial distribution, or simply, it is a binomial variate
with parameters n and p if
P(X = k) = nCkpkqn-k
for
k = 0, 1, 2, …, n
and this is described by writing X ~ B(n, p).
Note that P(X = k) are nothing but the terms of the binomial expansion of (p
(
+ q)n and this justifies the name ‘bino-
mial distribution”. Also, recall that q = 1 - p.
The following can be easily proved by using the results in Chapter 7, Binomial Theorem, Vol. 1.
THEOREM 7.10
If X ~ B (n, p), then the mean m and the variance 
m
s 2 of X are equal to 
X
np and npq, respectively.
Notice that a binomial distribution takes place under the following experimental conditions.
1. Each trial results in two mutually exclusive outcomes, termed as success and failure.
2. The number n of trials is finite.
3. The trials are independent of each other.
4. The probability p of success is constant for each trial.
7.6.2 Poisson Distribution
Another important theoretical discrete distribution is the Poisson distribution which is indeed a limiting case of the 
binomial distribution. A random variable X is said to follow
X
Poisson distribution with parameter l and 
l
X is called a
X
Poisson variate if

The following is an important result and we skip the proof of this.
THEOREM 7.11
Let X be a Poisson random variate with parameter 
X
l. Then the mean and variance of X are both
X
equal to l.
Note that the Poisson distribution can be used under the following experimental conditions.
1. Each trial results in two mutually exclusive outcomes, termed as success and failure.
2. The number n of trials is sufficiently large.
3. The probability p of success is very small.
4. The trials are independent of each other.

The Poisson distribution can be used, for instance, in
problems like the following:
1. The number of defective items in a packing
2. The number of deaths from non-epidemic diseases
such as heart attack or cancer or snake bites
3. The number of vehicles passing a given spot per 
minute during the peak hours of a day in a given 
city.

Eight coins are tossed simultaneously. Find the probability 
of getting atleast six Heads, using the binomial distribution.
Solution: Let
p = the probability of getting a head = 1

q = the probability of getting a tail = 1

28. A boy remembers all but the last digit of his girlfriend’s 
mobile number. He randomly chooses a digit from
0 to 9 (including 0 and 9). If he attempts two times, the 
probability that he reaches her at least once is
(A) 0.2

(D) 0.03
Solution: Let
E = Event that the boy makes correct dial at least once.
E = Event of failing in both attempts.
In the first attempt, the probability of failing is 9/10. In the
second attempt, the probability of failing is 8/9. Therefore

(B) 341

(C) 341

Solution: Since the birth date of any person can fall in 
anyone of the 12 months, the number of total outcomes
is 126. Let
E: Event that the birth dates of all 6 fall in two different
months.
Number of possibilities of 6 persons’ birth dates to fall 
in two different months (say February and March) is 
26 -2(this 2 corresponds to either all their birth dates fall
in February or all fall in March). The number of ways
that we can select 2 months out of 12 is 12C2. Therefore

the total number of outcomes = 2n ´ 2n = 4n. Suppose 
P contains “r” elements. Then, Q will have 2n-r choices 
r
because P Ç Q = f. For each selection of an r-element
set P, there correspond 2n-r choices for 
r
Q. Therefore the 
total number of choices for P and
P

Solution: Fermat’s theorem states that, if p is a prime
and x is any natural number, then either p divides x or
xp
x -1 -1 is divisible by p. Hence, if x is a positive integer,
then either 3 divides x or x2 - 1 is divisible by 3. Similarly, 
either 3 divides y or y2 - 1 is divisible 3. Observe that 
x2 - y2 = (x2 - 1) - (y2 - 1) is divisible by 3 if both x and y
are not multiples of 3.
Among 1, 2, 3 …, 3n, there are n multiples of 3. 
Among the multiples of 3, we can select two one after
other without replacement in n(n - 1) ways. Out of 
the remaining 2n numbers, we can select two one after 
other without replacement 2n(2n - 1) ways. Hence the
required probability is

Answer: (B)
58. A factory A produces 10% of defective screws and
another factory B produces 20% of defective screws.
A bag contains 4 screws of factory A and 5 screws of 
factory B. If two screws are drawn at random from
the bag, then the probability that atleast one screw is
defective (correct to three places of decimals) is
(A) 0.168
(B) 0.158
(C) 0.165
(D) 0.155
Solution: Let E be the event that atleast one screw is 
E
defective. Then E can be regarded as the union of the
E
following events.
E1 = one defective from A and one non-defective from B.
E2 = one defective from B and one non-defective from A.
E3 = one defective from A and one defective from B.
E4 = both defective from A.
E5 = both defective from B.

the boys and girls of G1 such that all the 4 boys are 
together and all the 3 girls together. p2 is the prob-
ability of arranging boys and girls of G2 alternately.
p2¢ is the probability of arranging boys and girls of G2
such that no two boys and no of two girls are sepa-

Therefore (A) is correct. Since boys are together and
girls are together (example b1, b2, b3, b4, g1, g2, g3), we 
consider all the 4 boys as a single object and all the 3 girls
as a single object. Two objects can be arranged in 2
ways. In each of these arrangements boys can be inter-
changed among themselves in 4 ways and girls can be 
interchanged among themselves in 3 ways. Therefore
the number of arrangements of boys and girls satisfying
the condition is 2

Statement I: The probability that the system has
unique solution is 3/8.
Statement II: The probability the system has a solu-
tion is 1.
Solution: Statement II is correct, because x = 0, y = 0 is
always a solution. The system has unique solution if and 
only if the matrix

Integer Answer Type Questions
1. Let n be a positive integer and A = {1, 2, 3, …, n}. Let S
be the set of all mappings f :A ® A. The probability that
a randomly chosen element of S to be injective mapping
S
is given to be 3/32. Then the value of n is 
.
Solution: Number of mappings from A to A is nn, that 
is S contains nn elements. It is known that the number of 
injections from A to A is n (see Theorem 6.18, page 293, 
Vol. 1). Therefore by hypothesis

2. 5 pairs of socks are in a cupboard of which 4 socks 
are drawn randomly. The probability that the drawn
sample contains exactly one pair is m/n, where m
and n are natural numbers having no common factor 
except unity. Then n - m is
.
Solution: 4 socks out of 10 can be selected in 10C4 = 210
ways. Let E be the event that the draw contains only one 
E
pair. Out of 5 pairs 1 pair can be selected in 5C1 = 5 ways.
From the remaining 8 socks 2 can be selected in 8C2 = 28
ways. But these 28 ways contain 4 pairs also. Therefore
number of ways of selecting exactly one pair is

Probability
 
  SUMMARY
7.1 Random experiment: An experiment is called
random experiment if the following conditions are 
satisfied.
(1) The experiment can be repeated any number of 
times under similar conditions.
(2) All possible outcomes of the experiment are 
known in advance
(3) The actual outcome in a particular experiment
cannot be exactly predicted.
7.2 Sample space and event: The set of all possible
outcomes of a random experiment is called sample
space of the experiment and any subset of the sample
space is called an event.
7.3 Exhaustive events: Two or more events are called
exhaustive events if the performance of the experi-
ment results in the occurrence of at least one of 
these events.
7.4 Mutually exclusive events: Two or more events are
said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of one 
of the events prevents the occurrence of any one of 
the other events.
7.5 Equally likely events: Two or more events are said
to be equally likely (or equiprobable) if there is no
reason to expect one of them in preference to the
others.
7.6 Probability (classical definition): Suppose in a
random experiment there are n exhaustive, mutually
exclusive, equally likely outcomes. If m of them are
favourable to an event E, then the probability P(E)
of E is defined as
E
P E
m
n
( ) =
QUICK LOOK
0 £ P(E) £ 1
(∵ 0 £ m £ n)
7.7 Complementary event: If E is an event, then non-
E
occurrence of E is called
E
complementary event of 
t
E
and is denoted by E  (or Ec).

7.8 Usual probability: The classical probability is also
called usual probability.
7.9 Sample points and sample space: Any possible
outcome of a random experiment is called a sample
point and the set of all sample points is called 
the sample space of the random experiment. An 
elementary event means a sample point. Generally
sample space is denoted by S.
7.10 Finite sample space: A set A is called finite if either
A is an empty set or it is bijective with the set {1,
2, 3, …, n} for some positive integer n. If a sample 
space is finite, then it is called a finite sample space.
7.11 Countably infinite sample space: A set A is called
countably infinite set if it is bijective with the set
+ of all positive integers. If the sample space of a 
random experiment is countably infinite set, then
the sample space is called countably infinite. For
example, tossing a fair coin till head appears has a 
countably infinite sample space.
7.12 Definition: Here afterwards events mean subsets
of the sample space. If A and B are two events, then
A È B means at least one of A or B and A Ç B
means both A and B. Impossible event is denoted
by empty set f and a certain event means the entire
f
sample space.
7.13 Various events in set theoretical form:
(1) Events E1, E2, …, En are said to be mutually 
exclusive if Ei Ç Ej
E = f for 
f
i ¹ j.
(2) E1, E2, …, En
E are called exhaustive events if E1 È
E2 È  È En
E = S (sample space).
(3) Mutually exclusive and exhaustive events means
E1 È E2 È  È En = S and Ei Ç Ej
E = f for 
f
i ¹ j.
(4) E1, E2, …, En are called equally likely (or equi-
probable) if there is no reason to expect one of 
them in preference to the others.
7.14 Probability function (Axiomatic): Let S be the
sample space connected with a random experi-
ment and Ã(S) is the power set of S (i.e., the set
of all subsets of S). Then a function P:Ã(S) ® 
is called a probability function on the sample S, if it 
satisfies the following conditions:
(1) P(E) ³ 0 for all E ÎÃ(S)
(2) P(S) = 1
(3) If E1 and E2
E  belong to Ã(S) and E1 Ç E2
E = f, then

Summary
If P is a probability function on 
P
S, then for any
E ÎÃ(S), P(E) is called the probability of the event E.
If E = {s}, then we write P(s) instead of P({s}).
If S is a countably infinite space then (3) will be replaced 
by the following:

7.33 Bernoulli trial: A random experiment in which we
consider an event called success and its comple-
mentary called failure is called Bernoulli trial.
7.34 Binomial variate: Let n be the number of indepen-
dent Bernoulli trials in which the probability for 
a success is p and that of failure is q = 1 - p. If X
denotes the number of successes, then
P X
k
p q
n

C
P(X = k) is called the probability of k successes and
n – k failures. n and p are called parameters of the
binomial variate X and we write
X
X ~ B(n, p).
7.35 Theorem (mean and variance of X ~ B (n, p)):
If X
B n p
∼
( ,
),
 
 then the mean of X is
X
np and the
variance is npq.
QUICK LOOK
The mean of a binomial variate is greater than or 
equal to its variance.
Note: If a set of n Bernoulli trials are repeated N
times, then the expected number of sets which contain
r success and 
r
n – r failures is
r
N(nCrprqn-r).

Matrix-Match Type Questions
In each of the following questions, statements are given 
in two columns, which have to be matched. The state-
ments in Column I are labeled as
I
(A), (B), (C) and
(D), while those in Column II are labeled as
I
(p), (q),
(r), (s) and (t). Any given statement in Column I can
I
have correct matching with one or more statements in
Column II. The appropriate bubbles corresponding to
the answers to these questions have to be darkened as 
illustrated in the following example.
Example: If the correct matches are (A) ® (p), (s);
(B) ® (q), (s),(t); (C) ® (r); (D) ® (r), (t); that is if the 
matches are (A) ® (p) and (s); (B) ® (q), (s) and (t);
(C) ® (r); and (D) ® (r), (t), then the correct darkening 
of bubbles will look as follows:

Euclid,
also 
known 
as 
Euclid of Alexandria, was a 
Greek mathematician, often 
referred to as the “Father of 
Geometry.” He was active in 
Alexandria during the reign 
of Ptolemy I (323–283 BC). 
His Elements is one of the 
most influential works in 
the history of mathematics, 
serving as the main textbook 
for teaching mathematics 
(especially geometry) from 
the time of its publication 
until the late 19th or early 
20th century. The origin of 
inequalities stemmed from 
the famous theorem of 
Euclid: The sum of two sides 
of a triangle is greater than
the third side.

8.1 | Introduction
The origin of inequalities stemmed from the famous theorem of EUCLID, namely, the sum of two sides of a triangle 
is greater than the third side. Almost all geometric inequalities, in some way or other, are based on this result. In
this chapter, we deal with geometric inequalities as well as algebraic inequalities, especially more with Arithmetic–
Geometric Mean inequality. Let us begin with formal definitions of Arithmetic Mean (AM), Geometric Mean (GM)
and Harmonic Mean (HM) of real numbers.

negative. Therefore B and C are acute, and
