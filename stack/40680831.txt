 ABSTRACT. Current ideas on the formation of the Galaxy are reviewed. Many of the observed
 characteristics of our Milky Way System are consistent with a scenario in which the Galaxy formed inside
 out, with the inner part of it evolving by rapid collapse of a single protogalaxy, while the outer halo was
 accreted over an extended period. A number of possible problems with this "standard model" are discussed
 and summarized in Sec. 5.
 1. INTRODUCTION
 Observational evidence on the formation and early evolu-
 tionary history of galaxies may be derived from images and
 spectra of very distant galaxies (e.g., Cowie et al. 1995;
 Abraham et al. 1996; van den Bergh et al. 1996) that are
 viewed at large look-back times. Alternatively, one can study
 the fossil evidence for Galactic evolution that is provided by
 the chemical abundances and kinematics of stars belonging
 to the oldest population components of the Milky Way Sys-
 tem. More than three decades ago, Eggen et al. (1962, ELS)
 used such observations of the metallicities and orbit shapes
 of high- velocity stars to conclude that the Milky Way Sys-
 tem formed by rapid collapse of a single massive protogal-
 axy. More recently, Searle (1977) showed that, contrary to
 the predictions of the ELS model, globular clusters in the
 outer halo of the Galaxy did not exhibit a radial abundance
 gradient. This conclusion is strengthened by observations of
 RR Lyrae field stars (Suntzeff et al. 1991) which show no
 radial abundance gradient for RGC>l0 kpc. Searle' s conclu-
 sion, and the remark by Toomre (1977) that "it seems almost
 inconceivable that there wasn't a great deal of merging of
 sizable bits and pieces (including quite a few lesser galaxies)
 early in the career of every major galaxy," led Searle and
 Zinn (1978, SZ) to propose a scenario for the formation of
 the Milky Way System in which transient protogalactic frag-
 ments "continued to fall into dynamical equilibrium with the
 Galaxy for some time after the collapse had been com-
 pleted." Since this model was proposed in the late 1970s,
 various pieces of evidence have emerged which strengthen
 the SZ scenario, while others appear difficult to reconcile
 with it. Some of these problems will be discussed in more
 detail in this review.
 2. FORMATION OF THE GALACTIC HALO
 2.1 Capture and Infall
 In situ measurements of the radial velocities of halo stars
 appear to indicate (Majewski et al. 1996a,b) that the Galactic
 halo may not presently be well mixed dynamically. This sug-
 gests that we are now observing the signature of past infall of
 the "sizable bits and pieces" envisioned by Toomre (1977).
 Prima facie evidence for such infall is provided by the re-
 cently discovered Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Ibata et al.
 1994), which appear to be merging with the Milky Way Sys-
 tem. Debris from tidal stripping of the Sagittarius dwarf (and
 of other dwarf companions of the Galaxy that may once have
 existed) will result in the formation of moving groups in the
 halo (Johnston et al. 1995). The present absence of any other
 dwarf companions to the Galaxy with RGC<50 kpc might be
 due to their removal by capture via dynamical friction (van
 den Bergh 1994a). Bellazzinni et al. (1996) have recently
 noticed a curious relationship between the surface bright-
 nesses and Galactocentric distances of the dwarf spheroidal
 companions to the Galaxy. They find that the lowest surface
 brightness (and, hence, the least stable) dSph galaxies are
 located closest to the Galactic center. Possibly, this result
 indicates that many low surface brightness dSph galactics
 remain to be discovered at large distances from the Galaxy.
 (The faint UMi system would, for example, have been diffi-
 cult to discover if its red giants had been fainter than the
 R- 20 plate limit of the Palomar Sky Survey.) The absence
 of any dSph galaxies with high surface brightnesses at
 R<l00 kpc, which is noted by Bellazzini et al., is not unex-
 pected because only three such objects are known in the
 much larger volume with 100</?GC (kpc)<300. If the lumi-
 nosity function of the Local Group does indeed contain more
 faint objects than presently believed, then the apparent dis-
 crepancy between the shallow slope of the Local Group lu-
 minosity function, and the steep slope of the luminosity
 functions of rich clusters (Driver et al. 1994; Bernstein et al.
 1995), might be removed.
 Van den Bergh (1993) found that eleven Galactic globu-
 lars on retrograde orbits have ([Fe/H])=- 1.59 ±0.07, which
 is significantly higher than the value ([Fe/H]}=- 1.86 ±0.08
 that Suntzeff (1992) derived for 13 true globular clusters in
 the Large Magellanic Cloud. Since mean cluster metallicity
 increases with parent galaxy metallicity (van den Bergh
 1975), this might be taken to suggest that Galactic globular
 clusters on retrograde orbits originated in an ancestral galaxy
 which was more massive than the LMC. Alternatively (and
 perhaps more plausibly) the fact that the clusters on retro-
 grade orbits have a mean metallicity ([Fe/H])= - 1.59 ±0.07,
 which is similar to those of halo clusters on direct orbits (for
 which <[Fe/H]}=-1.65±0.11), might be understood by as-

 suming that most halo clusters formed in a single highly
 turbulent protogalaxy.
 A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows no statistically sig-
 nificant difference in the distribution of [Fe/H] values for
 twelve halo clusters in prograde orbits and for eleven halo
 clusters that are in retrograde orbits (van den Bergh 1993).
 Nevertheless, it is of interest to note that six out of eleven
 halo clusters in retrograde orbits have metallicities in the
 narrow range - 1.59^ [Fe/H] =£S- 1.51. In fact, all three of the
 clusters with the most extreme retrograde motions (i.e., those
 designated R! by van den Bergh 1993) have metallicities that
 fall in this narrow range. This is a point that had previously
 also been noted by Rodgers and Paltoglou (1984). However,
 the fact that the globular clusters in the LMC have a large
 range in [Fe/H] values (Suntzeff 1992) shows that the small
 [Fe/H] range of most Galactic globular clusters in retrograde
 orbits does not constitute evidence for origin in a single cap-
 tured ancestral object. The reason for the small metallicity
 range of the majority of the Galactic globular clusters on
 retrograde orbits remains a mystery.
 An argument against the hypothesis that the Galaxy has
 experienced early mergers with massive ancestral objects
 similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud is provided by the
 observation that the globular clusters in the LMC do not
 exhibit the Oosterhoff (1939) dichotomy of the mean periods
 of RR Lyrae variables. A merger with an object similar to
 the Large Cloud would be expected to have left clusters with
 intermediate periods, such as that observed in the LMC clus-
 ters NGC 1466 ((Pab)=0.59 days) and NGC 1841
 ((Pab)=0.59 days) in the Galactic halo. Furthermore, a rela-
 tively recent merger with an object resembling the Large
 Magellanic Cloud or Small Magellanic Cloud would have
 left many massive intermediate-age clusters in the halo of the
 Galaxy. In fact, only half a dozen such objects are known;
 two of these (Arp 2 and Terzan 7) (Buonanno et al. 1994)
 appear to be associated with the Sagittarius dwarf. This sug-
 gests that mergers with rather massive dwarfs resembling the
 Sagittarius dSph galaxy were probably not very frequent dur-
 ing most of the history of the Galaxy. This makes it unlikely
 that such mergers provided a dominant contribution to the
 population of the Galactic halo.
 Minniti et al. (1996) have argued that the cluster Terzan 7,
 for which Da Costa and Armandroff (1995) find that
 [Fe/H]=-0.36, is too metal rich to be physically associated
 with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. However, the same evi-
 dence could also be invoked to argue that Ter 7 cannot be a
 member of the outer halo of the Galaxy!
 The youngest known cluster in the Galactic halo is Ru-
 precht 106 (Kaluzny et al. 1995) which appears to have an
 age of only 9.3 Gyr (Richer et al. 1996). It has been sug-
 gested by Lin and Richer (1992) that such relatively young
 clusters in the Galactic halo might have been tidally captured
 from the Magellanic Clouds. A possible problem with this
 hypothesis is that Rup 106 has a half-light radius rÄ = 1.10:
 pc (Harris 1996a), which is less than half that of any other
 Magellanic Cloud globular. Furthermore, the age of Rup 106
 falls near the center of the quiescent period, from 12 to 6 Gyr
 ago, during which the Large Cloud does not seem to have
 produced any clusters. The second youngest known halo

 2.2 Destruction of Globular Clusters
 Table 1 shows a comparison between the luminosity of all
 halo stars and the total luminosity of all true globular clusters
 in the Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Fornax dwarf
 spheroidal, and the Virgo giant elliptical M49. Perhaps sur-
 prisingly, the data in this table show that globular clusters
 account for rather similar fractions of the total luminosity of
 the spheroidal populations of these galaxies. Cluster destruc-
 tion by disk and bulge shocking will be of only negligible
 importance in the Fornax dwarf galaxy. The close coinci-
 dence between the fraction of all halo Population II light that
 is in the form of globular clusters in Fornax and in the Milky
 Way System therefore provides weak evidence against the
 hypothesis (Fall and Rees 1977) that the present Galactic
 globular-cluster system represents only a faint shadow of its
 former self. This is consistent with calculations by Hut and
 Djorgovski (1992) which appear to indicate that only
 3.6% ±2.2% of the total Galactic globular-cluster population
 is presently being destroyed per gigayear.
 2.3 Evolution of the Galactic Halo
 Hartwick (1978) has argued that the Galactic halo consists
 of a flattened inner component with c/a -0.6 and a vertical
 scale-height of 1.6 kpc (which is dominant near the Sun's
 position), and a more nearly spherical outer component. A
 somewhat more complex model for the halo is advocated by
 Noms (1994). According to Norris the Galactic halo consists
 of (1) a dynamically hot, nonrotating spherical, metal-poor
 component, within which (2) a somewhat metal richer
 ([Fe/H]>-1.5) rotating thick disk is embedded. Superim-
 posed on this structure is (3) a constituent which was ac-

 creted à la Searle and Zinn (1978). For a more detailed dis-
 cussion of possible substructures in the Galactic halo, the
 reader is referred to the review by Majewski (1993).
 Perhaps the strongest evidence against the hypothesis that
 the outer halo of the Galaxy was mainly formed by capture
 of "transient protogalactic fragments" (Searle and Zinn
 1978) is provided by the observation that the half-light radii
 rh of halo globular clusters grow with increasing Galactocen-
 tric distance Rqç . For clusters with RGC>20 kpc, van den
 Bergh (1995) finds a rank correlation coefficient p (rh,
 /?GC)= +0.61 ±0.18. One of the reasons for the existence of
 this correlation is that the Galactic halo contains few com-
 pact globular clusters, even though such objects would have
 survived destruction much more easily than the distended
 globulars that actually populate the outer halo of the Galaxy.
 A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows no significant differ-
 ence between the frequency distribution of half-light radii rh
 of globular clusters in the LMC (van den Bergh 1994b) and
 in the outer (RGC>'0 kpc) halo of the Galaxy (Djorgovski
 1993). However, a comparison between the metallicity dis-
 tributions of LMC clusters (Suntzeff 1992) and of that for
 Galactic globulars with RGC>l0 kpc shows that the LMC
 clusters are, on average, more metal deficient than those in
 the outer halo. A K-S test shows only a 7% probability that
 the LMC and Galactic halo clusters could have been drawn
 from the same parent population of [Fe/H] values. It is ten-
 tatively concluded that capture of a few LMC-like objects is
 unlikely to have produced a globular-cluster population re-
 sembling that presently observed in the outer Galactic halo.
 In Fig. 1, the half-light radii of the globular clusters in the
 Fornax dSph galaxy (van den Bergh 1994b) are plotted as
 arrows. Note that the radii of these clusters are, on average,
 smaller than those of globular clusters in the outer halo of the
 Galaxy. The paucity of compact clusters, like those in For-
 nax, in the outer halo of our Milky Way System militates
 strongly against the hypothesis that the outer halo of the
 Galaxy was mainly assembled from the debris of Fornax-like
 dwarf galaxies. Note in particular that all five Galactic
 globular clusters with RGC>A0 kpc have half-light radii rh
 greater than that of the largest Fornax globular.

 ters are plotted versus their perigalactic distances P (van den
 Bergh 1995). Also shown are the clusters in Fornax plotted
 at the Fornax perigalactic distance of 100 ±40 kpc (Hodge
 and Michie 1970). The figure shows that the Fornax clusters
 are smaller than Galactic globular clusters at similar peri-
 galactic distances. The Sagittarius dSph galaxy, which ap-
 pears to contain four globular clusters, does not throw much
 light on the origin of the halo. The cluster NGC 6715 (M54)
 has rÄ=2.8 pc, which is typical of globular clusters in the
 main body of the Galaxy. On the other hand, the cluster Arp
 2 has rh = l3.2 pc, which would place it firmly among the
 outer Galactic outer halo clusters. Finally, Terzan 7 and Ter-
 zan 8 have radii of intermediate size.
 The half-light radii of globular clusters in the Galactic
 halo increase with Galactocentric distance /?GC and with
 perigalactic distance P (see Figs. 1 and 2), whereas metal-
 licity [Fe/H] does not (Searle 1977; van den Bergh 1995).
 This suggests that the sizes of globular clusters were set by
 global parameters, whereas the metallicities of individual
 clusters were determined by local enrichment events. For
 very metal-poor halo stars, it is now possible (Sneden et al.
 1996) to see the signatures of individual supernova enrich-
 ment events.
 Lee (1993) and van den Bergh (1993) have independently
 pointed out that Galactic halo clusters can be divided into
 two populations on the basis of their metallicities and
 horizontal-branch gradients C=(B-R)/(B+V+R). Figure
 3 shows that all clusters with RGC<$.5 kpc appear to lie on
 (or close to) a single C vs. [Fe/H] relation. Van den Bergh
 (1993) has assigned all globular clusters of this type to his ß
 Population. On the other hand, most halo clusters with
 RGC>$.5 kpc are seen to fall below (or to the left) of this
 fiducial line. Van den Bergh (1993) has assigned such clus-
 ters to his a Population. Six out of nine clusters (67%) of the
 a Population, for which orbital data are available, appear to
 be on retrograde orbits, compared to two out of eleven (18%)
 for clusters of the ß Population. This suggests that the a
 Population may, at least in part, have formed in Mailing
 fragments that were subsequently captured by the Galaxy.
 Van den Bergh (1993), Lee et al. (1994), and Da Costa
 (1994) have argued that the young (a) Population of globu-

 belongs to an older protogalactic structure that collapsed à la
 Eggen et al. (1962). A scenario, such as that outlined above,
 would be consistent with the observation (Da Costa 1994)
 that clusters of the old halo appear, in the mean, to have
 direct motion (Vrot=+58±24 kms"1), whereas rotation of
 the younger halo (Vrot=- 45 ±81 km s"1) is marginally ret-
 rograde.
 Figure 4 shows a plot of cluster half-light radius rh versus
 perigalactic distance P for members of the a Population. The
 observed correlation would not be expected if clusters of the
 a Population had been captured at random by the protogal-
 axy.
 A recent compilation of the most accurate ages of indi-
 vidual globular clusters by Richer et al. (1996) shows that
 eight clusters of the a Population have a mean age (T) = 13.8
 ±0.5 Gyr, while eleven clusters of the ß Population are
 found to have (r) = 15.0±0.4; i.e., the a clusters are, on
 average, younger than those belonging to the ß Population.
 However, there appears to be a large intrinsic dispersion in
 the relation between globular-cluster age and its distance
 from the fiducial relation shown in Fig. 3. This suggests

 and intermediate-color (-0.80^(7^ + 1.00) horizontal
 branches, respectively. Intercomparison of the two panels of
 this figure shows a significant difference between these two
 types of clusters in the outer halo (/?GC>10 kpc) of the Gal-
 axy, but no obvious difference in the inner halo (RGC^l0
 kpc). For clusters with red horizontal branches that are lo-
 cated in the outer halo (Mi;) = -4.82, which is almost ten
 times less luminous than the value (Mv) = -730, which is
 found for outer halo clusters with blue and intermediate-
 color horizontal branches. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 shows that there is only a 0.1% chance that the red and blue
 HB clusters were drawn from the same parent population.
 At a given metallicity level globular clusters with red
 horizontal branches are believed to be younger than ones that
 have blue horizontal branches (Rood and Iben 1968; Rood
 1978; but also see Richer et al. 1996). So the observed effect
 might be due to a decrease in the luminosity with which
 clusters were formed over time in the outer halo. Alterna-
 tively, this luminosity difference could be related to the fact
 that red horizontal-branch clusters in the outer halo are, in
 the mean, more metal rich (([Fe/H])=-1.32) than are clus-
 ters with bluer horizontal branches (<[Fe/H])=-1.70). Per-
 haps second-generation globular clusters that formed in the
 outer Galactic halo were, on average, both less luminous and
 slightly more metal rich than those formed earlier. However,
 the low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-1.69) of Ruprecht 106, which
 is the youngest known halo globular cluster (Kaluzny et al.
 1995), would appear to militate against such a simple sce-
 nario.
 Most dwarf spheroidal galaxies formed stars over a very
 extended period of time. Such dSph galaxies are observed to
 contain large numbers of carbon stars. Capture of these dSph
 galaxies would therefore be expected to enrich the Galactic
 halo in carbon stars. From the (uncertain!) estimates of the
 number of C stars in the halo, van den Bergh (1994b) esti-
 mated that no more than -40% of the Galactic halo could
 have been produced by disintegration of Fornax-like dwarf
 spheroidal galaxies. It should, of course, be emphasized that
 capture and destruction of dwarf spheroidals that took place
 ^10 Gyr ago would not have contributed to the carbon star
 population of the Galactic halo. A much stronger constraint
 on such captures is set by observations of young blue stars in
 the Galactic halo (Unavane et al. 1996). Such blue objects
 with B-V^0A are younger than the vast majority of halo
 main-sequence stars. Unavane et al. conclude that only -1%
 of the halo could have been formed by accretion of dSph
 galaxies, like the Carina system, that contain a significant
 intermediate-age population. Preston et al. (1994) use their
 observations of metal-poor blue horizontal-branch stars to
 conclude that the accreted population is comparable to the
 total stellar content of all known dwarf spheroidal satellites
 of the Galaxy.
 Some blue stars found in the Galactic halo by Preston et
 al. (1994) might be the bluest members of a metal-poor
 intermediate-age population accreted from dwarf spheroidal
 satellites. Alternatively, a few moderately metal-poor halo A
 stars (Rodgers et al. 1981; Lance 1988) could perhaps have
 formed during collisions between metal-poor intergalactic
 clouds and the metal-rich gas in the disk of the Galaxy. Such
 metal-poor gas might also have been swept out of one or
 more dwarf irregular galaxies that collided with gas in the
 Galactic disk (Freeman 1996).
 If the Galactic globular-cluster system did, as proposed by
 Lee (1993), van den Bergh (1993), and Zinn (1993), grow
 inside out, then the spheroidal cluster component of the Gal-
 axy is presently larger than it was in the past. This contrasts
 with the situation for the system of open clusters which ap-
 pears to have been more extended in the past than it is at the
 present epoch (Friel 1995; Hufnagel 1995). The region with
 Rqc> 12 kpc is found to have produced numerous clusters
 with ages in the range of 2-8 Gyr. However, no clusters with
 Rqq>'2 kpc seem to have formed during the last 2 Gyr.
 Recent HST observations by Richer et al. (1996) appear to
 show that the outer halo clusters NGC 2419 and Pal 3, situ-
 ated at Rqq-100 kpc, have ages quite similar to those of
 globulars with /?gc<10 kPc- This has led Harris (1996) to
 conclude that a * 'coherent event" must have occurred in the
 Galactic halo -15 Gyr ago. In this connection, it is of inter-
 est to note that the oldest globular clusters in the LMC ap-
 pear to have ages that are similar to those of the oldest metal-
 poor globular clusters in the Galactic halo (Brocato et al.
 1996). Taken at face value, these results appear to suggest
 that the first burst of cluster formation took place almost
 simultaneously throughout the Galactic halo and in the sat-
 ellites of the Galaxy.
 3. FORMATION OF THE GALACTIC BULGE
 The dense absorbing clouds in the direction of the Galac
 tic center render the nuclear bulge of the Milky Way Syste
 almost invisible at visual wavelengths. However, it shows u
 prominently as a centrally peaked 2O°X15° (2.8X2.1 kp
 concentration of IRAS sources at a wavelength of 12 ¡m
 (Habing et al. 1985). Most of these infrared sources are pos
 sibly dust-embedded late-M giant stars. High metallicity i
 creases the fraction of giants that become very cool M star
 The existence of a strong radial metallicity gradient in th
 inner Galaxy (Terndrup 1988; Frogel et al. 1990; Minni
 1995) will therefore enhance the frequency of IR sourc
 close to the Galactic nucleus. The distribution of very late-M
 giants therefore presents a somewhat biased picture (King
 1993) of the distribution of stars in the nuclear bulge of th
 Galaxy.
 An initially steep metallicity gradient in the nuclear bulge
 will be flattened (Friedli et al. 1994) by a central bar (Blitz
 and Spergel 1991). However, this trend might be partly com-
 pensated for by metals produced during ongoing starbursts.
 Such star formation presently takes place in the thin, fast
 rotating, nuclear disk (Dejonghe 1993) which has /?GC<150
 pc.
 Baade's (1951) discovery of large numbers of RR Lyrae
 stars in the bulge of the Galaxy at first appeared to confirm
 the hypothesis (Baade 1944) that the nuclear bulge consisted
 of metal-poor stars of Population II. However, Morgan
 (1959) subsequently demonstrated that the dominant popula-
 tion of the Galactic nuclear bulge consists of strong-lined
 metal-rich stars. Radial-velocity observations of RR Lyrae
 stars in Baade's Window (Gratton 1987) showed that these
 objects exhibit a large velocity dispersion (cr^ 130 km s"1),

 which clearly marks them as members of the halo population
 that are just passing through the central region of the Galaxy.
 A recent study by Minniti (1996) of a bulge field at / = 8°,
 b = +7° shows that metal-rich K giants participate in the Ga-
 lactic rotation ((V) = +66±5 kms"1, <o)=72±4 kms"1),
 whereas metal-poor ([Fe/H] < - 1.5) halo giants ((V) = -6
 ±20 kms"1, (cr)=114±14 kms"1) have a large velocity
 dispersion and do not participate in the rotation of the Bulge.
 The Bulge has a half-light radius rh~200 pc (Frogel et al.
 1990). This is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the
 halo.
 From an analysis of the K giants in Baade's window (/
 = i:0, b = -3°.9) Sadler et al. (1996) find <[Fe/H]>=-0.11
 ±0.04, with more than half of the sample lying in the range
 -0.4 <[Fe/H]<+0.3. These values probably underestimate
 the true mean metallicity of bulge stars because (a) the line
 of sight toward Baade's window intersects the bulge at Z
 ^-0.5 kpc and (b) the sample excludes M giants which will,
 on average, be more metal-rich than K giants. From studies
 of the integrated light of stars in Baade's window, Idiart et
 al. (1996) find [Mg/Fe] =+0.45 in the Galactic nuclear
 bulge.
 The very high metallicities of some bulge stars have re-
 cently been confirmed with Keck échelle spectra obtained by
 Castro et al. (1996). These authors find [Fe/H] =+0.47 ±0.1 7
 for the star BW IV- 167. This is similar to the value
 [Fe/H] =+0.46 ±0.1 4 obtained for the nearby super metal-
 rich star fi Leonis.
 Minniti (1995) concludes that metal-rich globular clusters
 with Rqc>3 kpc belong to the Thick Disk, but that those
 having RGC<3 kpc are kinematically associated with the
 bulge. The color-magnitude diagrams of these clusters also
 appear consistent with their assignment to the bulge popula-
 tion. From color-magnitude diagrams obtained with the
 Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Ortolani et al. (1996) con-
 clude that the ages of the bulge clusters NGC 6528 and NGC
 6553 do not differ by more than a few Gyr from that of the
 Thick Disk cluster 47 Tucanae. It has, however, been empha-
 sized by Catelan and de Freitas Pacheco (1996) that such
 small age differences are rendered uncertain by possible dif-
 ferences in helium abundance and in the ratios of elements
 produced by SNe la and SNe II.
 From rather noisy color-magnitude diagrams that extend
 down to the main-sequence turnoff in Baade's Window,
 Terndrup (1988) concluded that the bulk of the stars in the
 bulge have ages in the range of 1 1-14 Gyr. Furthermore, he
 found that the number of objects with ages <5 Gyr is neg-
 ligible.
 The conclusion that disks and bulges of galaxies belong to
 distinct population components is supported by observations
 of M33. This galaxy has a well-developed halo containing
 globular clusters (Schommer et al. 1991) and RR Lyrae stars
 (Pritchet 1988), but appears to have little or no old bulge
 (Bothun 1991). In other words, a galaxy can have a halo but
 no bulge. However, the central region of M33 does contain
 evolved stars that are brighter than those in the Milky Way
 bulge (Minniti et al. 1993). Mighell and Rich (1995) suggest
 that such stars are associated with a relatively recent burst of
 FORMATION OF THE GALAXY 991
 star formation that took place well after the oldest stars
 formed.
 Hartwick (1976) proposed that the Galactic disk 
 formed by gas ejected from halo stars. However, this su
 tion appears difficult to reconcile with the high specific
 gular momentum of disk stars. More recently, Carney 
 (1990) and Wyse and Gilmore (1992) have suggested 
 the Galactic bulge was formed from low angular mome
 gas that was left over after most star formations had end
 the halo. The idea that halo stars were formed from leftover
 halo gas, which was enriched by SNe II on a short time scale,
 appears to be supported by Me William and Rich (1994) who
 find that, compared to disk stars near the sun, [Mg/Fe] and
 [Ti/Fe] are (as is the case in halo stars) elevated by ^0.3 dex.
 However, it is not clear why McWilliam and Rich find
 [Ca/Fe] and [Si/Fe] in bulge stars to closely follow normal
 trends for Galactic disk giants. Sadler et al. (1996) find
 ([CN/Fe]) to be close to solar in metal-poor stars in the
 bulge, whereas <[CN/Fe])=- 0.47 ±0.04 in metal-rich stars.
 The weak CN lines in bulge stars indicate that these objects
 differ in some respects from stars in elliptical galaxies. An
 additional complication (Ratag et al. 1992) is that He and N
 in bulge planetary nebulae appear to be higher than they are
 in the Galactic disk. All of these results suggest that the
 evolutionary history of the Galactic bulge was probably
 complex. This conclusion is supported by the observation
 that the central region of the Galaxy presently contains much
 less gas than would have been ejected by the stars in the
 Galactic bulge during a Hubble time (van den Bergh 1957).
 Most of the gas lost by first-generation bulge stars was prob-
 ably used up to form second-generation stars. Such second-
 generation stars could have incorporated elements produced
 on a relatively long time scale by SNe la.
 In elliptical galaxies, and in the large bulges of Sa and Sb
 galaxies that collapsed rapidly, the absence of gas can prob-
 ably be accounted for (Mathews and Baker 1971) by invok-
 ing Galactic winds generated via gas heating caused by su-
 pernova blast waves. Sofu and Habe (1992) postulate that
 such bulges are themselves formed by star bursts in gas
 clouds ejected from the central regions of galaxies. On the
 other hand, Sell wood (1993) has suggested that nuclear
 bulges might have formed as the result of barlike instabilities
 in disks. However, Minniti (1995) questions whether the
 steep abundance gradients observed in the nuclear bulges of
 galaxies could have been formed (or maintained) if disks had
 first been stirred up by bars. It is still too early (Renzini
 1993) to decide if any (or all) of the processes discussed
 above contributed to the formation of the Galactic bulge.
 Finally, it is noted that Lee (1992) believes the bulge of the
 Galaxy to be older than the halo. Renzini and Greggio (1990)
 have also argued that the bulge formed before the halo be-
 cause the collapse time scale r=(Gp)~m is much longer for
 the halo than it is for the bulge. So the bulge may be older
 than the halo, even though it is metal richer than the halo.
 A possible example of an infalling object is the globular
 cluster NGC 6287 (Stetson and West 1994). This cluster is
 very metal poor ([Fe/H] =-2.05) and is located at only 1.9
 kpc (Djorgovski 1993) from the Galactic nucleus. Its small
 half-light radius of rh = '3 pe suggests that it might be

 physically associated with the central region of the Galaxy.
 However, Stetson and West point out that the relatively high
 radial velocity (V=-208 km s"1) of NGC 6287 gives it suf-
 ficient kinetic energy to travel out (or fall in from) as far as
 the Solar circle.
 Some insight into the formation of spiral galaxies is pro-
 vided by the morphology of individual spirals in the Hubble
 Deep Field (e.g., van den Bergh et al. 1996). A good ex-
 ample is the spiral HDF 2-86. This object has a nucleus
 which is slightly orange in color, indicating the presence of
 some evolved stars. This nucleus is embedded in a disk (or
 flattened clustering) of presumably younger blue knots. This
 indicates that the nuclear bulge may already be present in a
 proto-spiral before assemblage of the disk is complete.
 4. FORMATION OF THE GALACTIC DISK
 4.1 Evolution of the Galactic Disk
 The evolutionary relationships between the Galactic halo,
 the Thick Disk and the Thin Disk remain a subject of lively
 controversy. In particular, it is not yet clear whether the tran-
 sition from the halo phase of Galactic evolution to the disk
 phase was continuous, or if there was an extended hiatus
 (Berman and Suchkov 1991) between the halo and disk
 stages of evolution. If there were such a hiatus, then it would
 no longer be possible to regard the Thick Disk as a structure
 that formed when pressure support started to buildup at the
 beginning of the dissipational phase of Galactic evolution. It
 is not yet clear (see Majewski 1993 for an excellent review)
 whether the Thick Disk and the Thin Disk represent distinct
 evolutionary phases, or if there was a gradual transition be-
 tween the Thick Disk and Thin Disk eras of Galactic evolu-
 tion. Observations by Osvalds and Risley (1961) show that
 short-period Mira variables exhibit halo kinematics, whereas
 longer period Miras seem to belong to a Thick Disk popula-
 tion. More detailed studies of Mira variables might, there-
 fore, provide some insight into the nature of the Thick Disk/
 Thin Disk transition. Realistic numerical simulations, which
 take into account energy and angular momentum transfer to
 the halo (Barnes 1996), seem to show that the Thick Disk
 probably does not represent Thin Disk material that was
 heated by capture of an infalling satellite. [If this view is
 correct, then the existence of thin disks in many spirals no
 longer places strong constraints (Tóth and Ostriker 1992) on
 the rate at which disk galaxies capture companions.] The
 observation by Gratton et al. (1996) that [Mg/Fe]« +0.4 in
 the Thick Disk, but that it decreases by 0.2 dex at the Thick
 Disk/Thin Disk transition, also militates against the sugges-
 tion that the Thick Disk consists of dynamically heated Thin
 Disk stars. However, this conclusion depends critically on
 how the Thick Disk to Thin Disk transition is defined. Ob-
 servations of a few nearby edge-on spirals (Morrison 1996)
 may indicate that only galaxies with central bulges exhibit
 Thick Disks. The reason for the possible existence of such a
 relationship between bulges and thick disks is not immedi-
 ately obvious. The reality of a metal-poor (and hence very
 old) population component in the Galactic disk is presently
 in doubt (Twarog and Anthony-Twarog 1996). Realistic
 merger calculations (Barnes 1996) suggest that it may not be
 possible to account for very metal-poor disk stars by invok-
 ing capture (Quinn and Goodman) of, and mergers with,
 dwarf galaxies.
 4.2 The Open Cluster System
 Recently, Friel (1995) has studied 74 open clusters with
 ages larger or equal to that of the Hyades. For these disk
 clusters, she finds that: (1) clusters with RGC~7 kpc are ab-
 sent, presumably because they have been destroyed by inter-
 actions with giant molecular clouds (van den Bergh and Mc-
 Clure 1980). (2) Open clusters (and, hence, the Thin Disk)
 exhibit a steep metallicity gradient with ([Fe/H])- 0.0 at
 RGC=1 kpc and ([Fe/H])=--0.5 at flGC=12.5 kpc. (3) At
 any value of /?GC, open clusters show a range in metallicity
 of about 0.5 dex. (4) Over the range l^R (kpc)^13 open
 clusters exhibit no evidence for a dependence of metallicity
 on age. Edvardsson et al. (1993) have recently obtained a
 similar result for element abundances (excluding Ba) in field
 stars with ages <10 Gyr. The most straightforward interpre-
 tation of this result is that the heavy elements produced by
 supernovae are diluted by infall of more-or-less pristine gas
 into the disk. Presumably, such infalling gas will, on aver-
 age, have zero angular momentum. Such infall will reduce
 the angular momentum of the Galactic disk and result in its
 radial contraction. Possible evidence for such infall is also
 provided by the observation (Edvardsson et al. 1993) that the
 scatter in [Si/Fe] is about four times smaller than that in
 [Fe/H]. This is exactly what would be expected if disk stars
 form from gas that has not been well mixed after infall of
 clouds with more-or-less pristine composition. Within the
 Galactic disk, Edvardsson et al. find that [a/Fe] decreases
 with increasing RGC. This suggests that the rate of star for-
 mation declined faster in the inner disk than it did at larger
 radii.
 For a detailed discussion of the chemical and stellar evo-
 lution of the Galactic disk, the reader is referred to Prantzos
 and Aubert (1995). However, a problem is that constraints
 imposed by the disk oxygen abundance are uncertain. This is
 so because H il regions show a steep [O/H] gradient in the
 outer disk, whereas observations of B stars appear to exhibit
 no such gradient.
 4.3 Age of the Galactic Disk
 The Thick Disk of the Galaxy is observed to contain
 many RR Lyrae variables. Since RR Lyrae stars occur in the
 ' 'young" globular cluster Ruprecht 106 (Kaluzny et al.
 1995), to which Richer et al. (1996) assign an age of 9.3 Gyr,
 it follows that the Thick Disk must have an age of at least 9
 Gyr. This conclusion is marginally consistent with the fact
 that few carbon stars (most of which are thought to have ages
 ^10 Gyr) appear to have Thick Disk kinematics. An even
 greater age of 12±2 Gyr has recently been obtained by
 Phelps et al. (1996) for the probable open cluster Berkeley
 17. If one assumes that the disk formed after the end of the
 halo phase of Galactic evolution, then an upper limit on the
 age of the Galactic disk is set by the halo cluster M92, for
 which Bolte and Hogan (1995) derive an age of 15.8±2.1
 Gyr. Other normal halo globular clusters may be younger

 than M92, but have less well-determined ages. [Young halo
 clusters such as Rup 106 and Ter 7 probably had unusual
 evolutionary histories (van den Bergh 1996) and may have
 formed after the thick disk was assembled.] A weaker, but
 entirely independent, upper limit to the age of the Galactic
 halo is set by the thorium abundance in the ultra-metal-poor
 star CS 22893-052, which yields an age of 16±6 Gyr
 (Sneden et al. 1996). However, the work by Phelps et al.
 (1994), and of Kaluzny et al. (1995), shows that there may
 be some overlap between the ages of the oldest open clusters
 and those of the youngest globulars. In other words, the disk
 may have started to form before formation of the halo was
 completed.
 If all open clusters are members of the Thin Disk, then a
 lower limit to the age of the Thin Disk is provided by NGC
 6791, which is the oldest open cluster with a well-
 determined age. Garnavich et al. (1993); Kaluzny and Rucin-
 ski (1995); and Tripicco et al. (1995) find ages of 7-10 Gyr
 for this object. The motion of this cluster, which lags circular
 motion by more than 60 km s~l (Scott et al. 1995) is, how-
 ever, somewhat peculiar. An age similar to that of NGC
 6791 is obtained from the calculated production ratios of the
 actinoid pairs 235U/238U and 232Th/238U and their presently
 observed abundance ratios. From these values Chamcham
 and Hendry (1996) find that star formation in the solar neigh-
 borhood began at least 9 Gyr ago.
 An entirely independent lower limit to the age of the Ga-
 lactic disk is provided by the colors and trigonometric paral-
 lax (Ruiz et al. 1995) of the white dwarf ESO 439-26, which
 is found to have Mv= + ll.6±0.l. This low luminosity
 yields a cooling age of 6-7 Gyr. In summary, it appears that
 all presently available data are consistent with ages of be-
 tween 12 and 15 Gyr for the Thick Disk of the Galaxy.
 Berkeley 17, the oldest known "open" cluster may, on the
 basis of its kinematics (Scott et al. 1995), be a member of the
 Thick Disk. The age of this cluster is estimated to be 12±2
 Gyr, which is consistent with the Thick Disk age limits given
 above.
 5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 It is now widely believed that the central region of the
 Milky Way System collapsed from a single protogalaxy à la
 ELS, while the outer part of the Galaxy is thought to have
 been assembled by infall (and subsequent capture) of proto-
 galactic fragments, as envisioned by SZ. The observation
 that six out of nine young globular clusters of a type have
 retrograde orbits, whereas only two out of eleven older
 /3-type clusters have retrograde orbits, appears consistent
 with this scenario. In the "standard model," the Galaxy
 formed inside out, with the bulge being old and the outer
 halo relatively young. However, the following problems are
 noted with this standard model.
 (a) The standard model does not account for the observa-
 tion (see Fig. 1) that the half-light radii rh of globular clus-
 ters grow with increasing Galactocentric distance Rqc An
 even closer (and as yet unexplained!) relation (Fig. 2) exists
 between rh and perigalactic distance P. It is particularly puz-
 zling (see Fig. 4) that young a- type globular clusters in the
 FORMATION OF THE GALAXY 993
 halo, which should mainly be captured objects, app
 exhibit a close correlation between rh and P.
 (b) The globular clusters associated with the Fornax d
 spheroidal galaxy are much smaller (see Fig. 2) than
 globular clusters in the Galactic halo. It follows that th
 cannot have been entirely assembled by capture of For
 like dSph systems. The frequency of blue intermediat
 stars in the halo also limits recent accretion of Carina-like
 dSph systems to -1% of the total stellar population of the
 Galactic halo.
 (c) The periods of RR Lyrae stars in Galactic halo globu-
 lar clusters exhibit a marked Oosterhoff dichotomy, with
 mean cluster periods {Pab)-0.55 days and (Pfl¿7)- 0.65
 days. No such dichotomy is observed among the RR Lyrae
 variables in globular clusters associated with the LMC. This
 suggests that the Galaxy did not merge with one or more
 galaxies resembling the Large Cloud during the course of its
 evolutionary history. The fact that only about half a dozen
 Galactic globular clusters are known to have ages as low as
 - 10 Gyr suggests that the number of mergers with
 Sagittarius-like dSph galaxies has probably been small.
 Weak limits on the number of recent mergers with dSph
 galaxies can also be set from the frequency of C stars in the
 Galactic halo.
 (d) Contrary to expectations from the standard model, re-
 cent HST observations of the clusters NGC 2419 and Pal 3,
 at /?~100 kpc, yield ages that are similar to those of typical
 globular clusters at R<'0 kpc. This suggests the possibility
 that a "coherent event" might have produced a burst of clus-
 ter formation in the Galaxy -15 Gyr ago.
 (e) It is not clear (see Fig. 5) why globular clusters in the
 outer halo, that have red horizontal branches, are an order of
 magnitude less luminous than those that have bluer horizon-
 tal branches.
 Taken at face value, some of these results appear to
 weakly favor a scenario (Sandage 1990) in which mergers
 represent "noise" that is superposed on an ELS-like collapse
 model for the Galactic halo. It should, however, be empha-
 sized that infall might have played a more important role in
 the evolutionary history of other giant galaxies. The obser-
 vation that globular-cluster radii rh correlate with RGC, but
 that [Fe/H] does not, appears to favor a scenario in which
 halo cluster sizes are set by global parameters, whereas their
 metallicities are determined by local factors.
