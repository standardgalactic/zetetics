Spin Echo
Antoine Weis
Spin echo is a technique, introduced in 1950 by Erwin Hahn, for suppressing
inhomogeneous line broadening effects in  magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The
width of a magnetic resonance line (in the low rf power limit ω2
1 ≪γ1γ2) is deter-
mined by the transverse relaxation time T2 = 1/γ2 (cf (3) of  magnetic resonance).
An inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B0 produces an inhomogeneously broadened line
which can be understood as the superposition of many lines with narrow widths γ2.
The spin echo technique overcomes the loss of spectral resolution due to the inho-
mogeneous broadening.
Consider a system of N spins, initially aligned along z. At time t = 0 the spins
are tipped by a π/2-pulse to the y direction, and the (inhomogeneous) magnetic ﬁeld
B0 = B0(x, y)
⌢z drives their precession in the x–y plane. Because of the ﬁeld inho-
mogeneity B, the different spins precess at different angular frequencies (Fig. 1),
and the macroscopic transverse polarization components Px,y =

because of the collective dephasing (Fig. 2, left).
Although the ensemble averaged polarization vanishes for times larger than the
inhomogeneous dephasing time T ∗
2 ∝1/B, the phase memory of the individual
spins will survive for a longer time T2 ≫T ∗
2 and the spins can be made to rephase
following the application of a π-pulse at time t = T after the initial π/2-pulse that
started the dephasing. Such a pulse rotates all the spin vectors by 180◦around
the x-axis, which, for spins in the x–y plane, is equivalent to a reversal of their

Fig. 2 Decay of the transverse spin polarization in the x–y plane due to inhomogeneous dephasing
(left). The π-pulse after time T reverses the y-components of the individual spins and the spins
rephase to a maximum transverse polarization at time t = 2T
y-components (Fig. 2, center). As a consequence the faster precessing spins (here
S3 and S2) will catch up again with the slower spins, so that after the time t = 2T
all spins are again completely in phase, yielding a maximal transverse polarization,
which for later times of course will decay again because of the inhomogeneity. The
reappearance of a ﬁnite polarization from an apparently depolarized sample is called
a spin echo.
The echo pulse amplitude is smaller than the starting amplitude, i.e., the initial
transverse polarization due to the (homogeneous) T2 relaxation. From the variation
of the echo amplitude as a function of the time interval T one can thus infer T2.
An interesting variant of spin echo spectroscopy was developed for neutrons and
has become known under the name of neutron spin echo spectroscopy. The investi-
gation of inelastic neutron scattering via phase shifts requires highly monochromatic
neutrons. This requirement is rendered obsolete by using the echo technique which
rephases neutrons of different velocities, so that all velocities contribute to the
signal, yielding a large gain in statistics and sensitivity.

Similar echo phenomena can be observed in any multilevel quantum system
subject to inhomogeneous relaxation, such as, e.g., in two-level atom and ions, for
which echoes occur in the optical spectral range, where they are then called photon
echoes. See also  magnetic resonance; spectroscopy; spin.

Spin Statistics Theorem
Arianna Borrelli
The term spin-statistics theorem is used to indicate theoretical explanations of the
connection exhibited by non-relativistic quantum systems of identical particles be-
tween the particles’  spin and their quantum-statistical behaviour. In such systems,
particles of integer spin follow  Bose–Einstein statistics, while particles of half-
integer spin obey  Fermi–Dirac statistics. High-precision experiments have not
revealed any violations of this rule [8]. In the framework of relativistic  quantum
ﬁeld theory, it is possible to show that, under the assumption that all particles are ei-
ther bosons or fermions (symmetrization postulate), the spin-statistics connection is
a consequence of basic physical postulates such as relativistic  invariance, positive
energy or time-reversal invariance.
From 1936 until today, a number of proofs of the connection between spin and
statistics have been offered, with varying degrees of rigour and generality and
imposing on the theory different physical requirements and limitations [10–12].
The proof which eventually entered textbook-tradition was given by Wolfgang
Pauli (1900–1958) in 1940, and relied on results obtained previously by his assis-
tant Markus Fierz (1912–2006) (1939) [1]. In the 1960s, the term “spin-statistics
theorem” established itself to indicate these demonstrations, even though they
