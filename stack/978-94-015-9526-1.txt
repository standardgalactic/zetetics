Introduction
The theory of foliations and contact forms have experienced such great de-
velopment recently that it is natural they have implications in the field of
mechanics. They form part of the framework of what Jean Dieudonne calls
"Elie Cartan's great theory of the Pfaffian systems", and which even nowa-
days is still far from being exhausted. The major reference work is.without
any doubt that of Elie Cartan on Pfaffian systems with five variables. In it
one discovers there the bases of an algebraic classification of these systems,
their methods of reduction, and the highlighting of the first fundamental in-
variants. This work opens to us, even today, a colossal field of investigation
and the mystery of a ternary form containing the differential invariants of
the systems with five variables always deligthts anyone who wishes to find
out about them.
One of the goals of this memorandum is to present this work of Cartan
- which was treated even more analytically by Goursat in its lectures on
Pfaffian systems - in order to expound the classifications currently known.
The theory of foliations and contact forms appear in the study of completely
integrable Pfaffian systems of rank one. In each of these situations there
is a local model described either by Frobenius' theorem, or by Darboux'
theorem. It is this type of theorem which it would be desirable to have for a
non-integrable Pfaffian system which may also be of rank greater than one.
We know that such a model is insufficient for describing events more general
than can met in statistical mechanics. One possible approach lies in the
description of the associated dynamic systems not by an exterior equation
alone by a system of exterior equations. This original step has already made
it possible to recover the equations of the statistical mechanics suggested by
Nambu. One of the goals of this work is to lay down the bases of a multi-
symplectic mechanics.
The first part of this work is of a purely algebraic nature. It presents to it
the concepts of exterior forms and systems of exterior forms. A particular

INTRODUCTION
study is devoted to the case of the exterior systems defined by equations of
the symplectic type, and to those groups which leave this structure invari-
ant. Chapter 4 and 5 are devoted to the Pfaffian systems. In them are
defined Cartan's invariants (the class of a system, characteristic spaces, as-
sociated derived systems, etc), and one again finds the traditional theorems
of Frobenius and Darboux. This latter theorem is approached by studing
the maximal integral manifolds of a Pfaffian equation not necessarily in-
tegrable, and doing this makes it possible rather quickly to find Darboux'
theorem "with parameters" quoted by Goursat. The known classifications
of the Pfaffian systems are also presented, these classifications being given
up to local isomorphism.
These chapters culminate in the systems with five variables and their char-
acteristics: there is an infinity of local models - which does not appear in
lower dimension (note that all the systems studied do not have singularities).
Cartan's ternary form giving the differential invariants of these systems is
reconsidered, and it is presented with a reduction inspired by the approach
which Goursat gives in his book to some Pfaffian systems.
The last part of this work is devoted to the differential study of multi-
symplectic systems. The classification of the systems of exterior forms of
degree 2 shows, here also, that there exists an infinity of models (chapter
3). The conditions for the existence of solutions of maximum dimension
make it possible to describe one particular system, that corresponding to
the k-symplectic systems. These latter thus seem to be models of systems
of exterior 2-forms of maximum rank. The interest in embarking upon their
study is obvious within this framework. One starts by defining the concepts
of Hamiltonian dynamic systems and Poisson brackets. One then describes
the (simplest) differential affine manifolds provided with such a structure,
and one establishes the link with the models of statistical mechanics pro-
posed by Nambu. In all this final part use is'made of the traditional concepts
of differential geometry (connection, G-structure, reduction, cohomology)
without giving any detailled reconsideration of their definitions.
This work is the result of a collaboration between the University of Haute
Alsace and the Faculty of Sciences Ben Msik of Casablanca, with the con-
tunued financial assistance of the Integrated Action (AI 809-94).

EXTERIOR FORMS
1.1
Exterior algebra
1.1.1
The dual space
Let II{ be a commutative field and let E be an n-dimensional vector space
over II{. The dual E* of E is the vector space of linear forms on E. If vEE
and f E E*, the value of f on v will be denoted by (v, f).
Let {eI,· ··, en} be a basis of E.
Let us denote by ei E E* the linear
form on E defined by:
i
(
i)
ri
{1
if
i = j,
e : ej I-t ej, e = Uj =
0
if
i i= j.
Then {el, . . . , en} is a basis of E*, called the dual basis of {el, .. . ,en}. We
can note that the isomorphism
F:E~E*
defined by F(ei) = ei is not canonical. In fact , it depends on the choice of
the basis of E . For example, let us consider the new basis {VI, ...,vn} given
by VI = aeI, Vi = ~, i i= 1, a i= O. If F' is the isomorphism between E and
E* given by F'(Vi) = vi where {vl, ...,vn} is the dual basis of {VI, ...,vn},
then F'(el) = a-Ivi = a-2el and F' i= F whenever a2 i= 1. On the other
hand, we can verify that the spaces E and E** are canonically isomorphic,
E** being the dual of E*.
We can see that the tensor product E®E* can be identified to the space
of all linear transformations of E. In fact, if vEE, and f E E*, we put
(v ® f)(w) = (w,f)v

2
CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
for all wEE.
Then v ® f defines a linear transformation of E, and by
linearity we can extend it to all elements of E ® E*. Conversely, if we have
an endomorphism of E having (llij) as its matrix with respect to the basis
{ell ..,en } of E, we can write this endomorphism L:llijei ®e1.
Similarly, we can see that the tensor product E*®E* corresponds to the
space of bilinear forms on E . We can extend this study of tensor products
of E and E* . This leads to the general study of the tensor algebra
T(E)
=
1K+E+E* +E®E+E®E* + E* ®E+E* ®E*
+E®E®E+ ...
1.1.2
The algebra of contravariant tensors
Consider the subalgebra G(E) of T(E) given by
G(E)
=
1K+E+E®E+E®E®E+ ...
=
GO(E)+ GI(E) + G2(E) + ... ,
where (]P(E) = E ® E ® ... ® E (p-times). An element of (]P(E) is called
a p-contravariant tensor and G(E) is called the algebra of contravariant
tensors of E. Similarly, we can define the subalgebra G(E*) of T(E). It is
the algebra of covariant tensors of E . There exists a natural identification
to GP(E*) with (GP(E»*. In fact, we define a pairing of G(E) and G(E*)
into 1K by putting:
(v,I') = 0
if v E cP(E) and l' E Gq(E*) with p i= q,
and , if p = q, we write
v
= 2:: v il
ip ~l ®
® eip '

= 2:: I'il
j pei 1 ®

p
and we put
(V 'V) = ~ Vi1 ...ip'V .
' .
,

This gives the seemed identification.
1.1.3
The exterior algebra of E
The permutation group 6 p acts on the linear space TP(E ). If (J is a permu-
tation and VI ® ... ® Vp E TP(E) , we define
(J(VI ® ... ® vp) = vU(I) ® ... ® vu(p)
and extend by linearity to all of TP(E).

1.1. EXTERIOR ALGEBRA

Definition 1.1 A tensor t E TP(E) is called antisymmetric if it satisfies
O'(t) = sgn(O')t, where sgn(O') = +1 if 0' is even, and -1 if 0' is odd.
We note AP(E) the space of antisymmetric p-tensors on E. There is a
projection
TP(E) --. AP(E)
given by
1
.Ap(t) = , L (sgn(O'))O'(t).
p. UE8p
Now, consider the space A(E) given by
A(E) = lK + E + A2(E) + A3(E) + ...
In this space we define the product 1\ by:
v 1\w = .Ap+q(v 0 w)
with v E AP(E) and w E Aq(E). Thus v 1\ wE Ap+q(E) and
This product provides A(E) with the structure of an associative algebra,
called the exterior algebra of E .
We can carry out the same construction from the vector space E*, and
define the exterior algebra A(E*) of E*.
1.1.4
The algebra of covariant tensors
Consider the subalgebra T(E*) of T(E) given by
T(E*)
=
lK + E* + E* ® E* + E* 0 E* ® E* + ...
=
rD(E*) + T 1(E*) + T 2(E*) + ... ,
where TP(E*) = E*®E*®...®E* (p-times). An element ofTP(E*) is called
a p-covariant tensor and T(E*) is called the algebra of covariant tensors of
E.
We can define the exterior algebra AP(E*) as in the previous section,
considering this algebra as the exterior algebra of the vector space E* . It
is this object which will interest us hereafter. For this we will define the
structure of this algebra directly.

CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
1.2
The exterior algebra A(E*)
Throughout this chapter we consider the real numbers as the base field
(lK = lR).
1.2.1
Exterior p-forms on E
Definition 1.2 A p-exterior form on E is a mapping
satisfying:
for all a, s«JR, Vj, Wi E E, and
as soon as j ~ p such that Vj-l = Vj'
Proposition 1.1 If a is a p-exterior form on E , then it satisfies:

-a(V},· . . ,Vi + Vi+}, Vi + Vi+l, .. . ,Vp )
=
- a(v}, . . . , Vi + Vi+}, Vi,"', Vp )
=
- a(V}, · .. ,Vi+}' Vi,' •• ,Vp ) .
We deduce that
a(v},···, Vp ) = 0
when Vi and Vj are equal or proportional. Then every p-exterior form a on
E is zero when p > dimE = n.•

1.2.
THE EXTERIOR ALGEBRA A(E*)
5
It is easy to see that the p-exterior forms on E are the elements of
I\P(E*). Then, the exterior algebra
n
I\(E*) = E9I\P(E*),
°
with 1\o(E*) = R, is the space of exterior forms on E.
1.2.2
Grassmann product of linear forms
We will define directly the product of the exterior algebra A(E*) in the
particular case of linear forms. Let us consider two linear forms P and f2
on the vector space E . We define the 2-exterior form, denoted I' /\ f2 and
called the Grassmann product of P and f2, by putting:
for all X,Y E E. This product is non commutative and satisfies:
We can also define this product for a large number of factors.
Definition 1.3 Let P, I',...,fP be linear forms of E*.
The Grassmann
product of these forms is the p-exterior form, denoted P /\ f2 /\ ... /\ fP and
defined by:
for all Xl , ...,X p E E, where det(M) stands for the determinant of matrix
M.
The fact that jl /\f2 /\ .. ./\jP is a p-exterior form results from the properties
of the determinant.
Proposition 1.2 Let fl,·· ·,t" be linear forms on E.
These forms are
linearly dependent on E* if and only if the Grassmann product satisfies

6
CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
Proof. Let us suppose that the linear forms I',...,fP are linearly inde-
pendent and let us consider the vectors XI,' " ,Xp satisfying f(Xj) = 8}.
Thus the matrix (f(Xj)) is the identity matrix. Then
fl /\f2 /\ •• • /\jP(X1,···,Xp ) = 1
and
Conversely, if the linear forms r....,jP are linearly dependent in E* then
for all vectors (X1, · · ·,Xp) the rank of the matrix (f(Xj)) is less than p
and det(f(Xj ) ) = O.•
1.2.3
Exterior product
In the preceding paragraph we have defined the product on the exterior
algebra. We take again here this definition in the case of the algebra A(E*).
Definition 1.4 Let a be a p-exterior form and {3 a q-ezierior form E . The
exterior product a /\ {3 of the exterior forms a and {3, is the (p+q)-exterior
form on E , defined by:
a/\{3(X1, "'Xp+q) =
p~! LUE6P+q €(a)a(X u(I )" " ,Xu(p)){3(Xu(P+1)" " ,Xu(p+q)),
where <5p+q is the permutation group of p + q letters and €(a) = sgn(a) the
signature of the permutation a.
According to the previous section, it is easy to see that a /\ {3 is a (p+q)-
exterior form.
Remark 1 The Grassmann product of linear forms is nothing other than
the exterior product of these forms.
Since
a /\ {3 = (-l)pq{3 /\ a
for all a E ft(E*) and {3 E /\q(E*), we deduce that /\(E*) is an associative

We are now able to determine the dimension of spaces /\P(E*) .

Proposition 1.3 Let {fl , "
' ,r} be a basis of E*.
Then the p-ezterior
forms
with ij E {l,"', n} and il < i2 < ... < ip give a basis of the vector space
I\P(E*). Then
and dim I\(E*) = 2n .
Proof. Let {Xl, .. . , Xn} be a basis of E such that {P,···, fn} be its dual
basis. Let a be a p-exterior form on E. We set
We then have
a = L~I...ipf h A ··· Ar-.
This shows that the family {FI A··· A Fp} generates the space I\P(E*).
The linear independence of these forms results from the previous propo-
sitions.•
1.3
The graded algebra /\(E*)
In order to simplify the notation, I\(E*) will be denoted by I\E*. We have
just seen that the graded vector space
is provided with a non commutative associative algebra of dimension 2n .
Each element a of 1\ E* is written on the form:
with 1\0 E* = JR. The i-th exterior form ai is called the homogeneous com-
ponent of degree i of a.

CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
1.3.1
The interior product
Definition 1.5 Let a E It E* be a p-ezterior form on E, p
~ 1, and
let X be a vector belonging to E.
The interior product of X and a is the
(p -I)-exterior form, denoted i(X)a (or XJa), defined by:
for all Xl,··· ,Xp- l E E.
The mapping
i(X) : a I-t i(X)a
from AP E* into AP- I E* is linear.
We can extend this mapping to an
endomorphism of AE* by setting
i(X)a = 0, if a = a E lR
and
n
i(X)a = L i(X)O'i'
i=l
where a = ao + al +... + an is the quantity defined above.
Proposition 1.4 Let X and Y be two vectors belonging to E.
Then we
have
1. i(X + Y) = i(X) + i(Y),
2. i(aX) = ai(X) , a E R,
3. i(X)i(Y) + i(Y)i(X) = 0,
4. i(X)i(X) = 0.
It is easy to prove these identities.
Proposition 1.5 Let a (respectively (3) be a p-exterior form (respectively
a q-sezterior form) on E. For every vector X E E, we have:
i(X)(a /\ (3) = (i(X)a) /\ {3 + (-I)Pa /\ (i(X){3).

Proof. Let us consider p + q independent vectors {el,··., ep+q} (if P+ q
is strictly greater than n, the previous identity is trivial) and let us assume
that X = e1. We have

The permutation group 6 p+q is a disjoint union of 81 constituted of permu-
tations of which the pre-image of 1 is less or equal to p, and of the set 82
of permutations of which the pre-image of 1 is strictly greater than p. We
have:

This gives the result desired. •
Consider the one-dimensional vector spaces 1\n E and 1\n E*, where n =
dim E. These spaces are dual:
Let e and e* be the dual bases of 1\n E and I\n E*.
Proposition 1.6 The linear mapping
1..: ArE -tAn-rE*
defined by
1.. (X) = i(X)e*
is an isomorphism of I\r E onto 1\n-r E*. This mapping is unique up to a
factor only.
Proof. We choose dual bases {e1'...,en} and {a1 = e1,..., an = en} so that
e1 /\ ... /\ en = e and e1/\ ... /\ en = e", then

where s}, ..., sr-p are the complementary set of indices in iI, ...i- to iI, ...,ip

Thus the linear map 1.. associated with e and e* is an isomorphism. •
A decomposable p-uecior of E is a p-vector of I\P E of type X I /\ ... /\Xp •
We have the similar notion for decomposable exterior form.
Proposition 1.7 The linear map
1..: 1\»e ~ 1\ n-rE*
carries decomposable elements into decomposable elements.
Proof. A decomposable element of degree n goes into 1\0 E. In this case
the proposition is obvious. Let el /\ .../\ er be a decomposable element of
degree r and we complete (el, ...,er) to a basis (ei, ...,er,er+l, ...,en) such
that, el /\ ... /\ en = e. Then,
1.. (el /\ ... /\ er) = i(el /\ ... /\ er)e* = ±er+l /\ ... /\ en,
which is decomposable and corresponds to the space spanned by n - r inde-
pendent forms er+l ,..., en. •
1.3.2
Derivatives. Antiderivatives
Definition 1.6 A linear endomorphism h of 1\ E* is a derivative of 1\ E*
if it satisfies:
1. for every p-exterior form a on E, h(a) is an exterior form whose
degree has the same parity as a;
2. h(a /\ (3) = h(a) /\ f3 + a /\ h(f3) for every a, f3 E 1\ E*.
Definition 1.7 A linear endomorphism h of 1\ E* is an anti-derivative of
degree q E Z of1\ E* if it satisfies:

1.3. THE GRADED ALGEBRA I\(E*)
11
2. (_1)deg(a) = (_1)deg(h(a»+1
for every a of a given degree deg(a),
3. h(a /\ (3) = h(a) /\ {3+(-1)Pa /\ h({3) for every a E I\P E*, {3 E 1\ E* .
The second condition implies that the degree of an anti-derivative necessarily
is odd.
Example 1 The interior product by a vector X E E is an antiderivative of
degree -1.
1.3.3
On the structure of the associative algebra AE*
Provided with the exterior product, 1\ E* is a non-commutative unitary
associative algebra of dimension 2n , where n is the dimension of E. Let us
describe this structure for dim E = 1 or 2.
1. n = 1. The algebra 1\ E* is of dimension 2. A basis is given by {1,ei}
with 1 E 1\0 E* = lR and ei E E* = 1\1 E*:
2. n = 2. If {eb e2} is a basis of E* then the set {1,eb e2, e3 = el /\ e2}
is a basis of 1\ E* and the exterior product is defined by:
1/\ e, = e, /\ 1 = ~,
i = 1,2,3
other products being zero.
The exterior algebra is a Cliffordalgebra associated with the null quadratic
form. In fact, let q be a quadratic form on a vector space V. Let us consider
the tensor algebra T(V) on V. We define the ideal Iq(V) as the ideal of
T(V) generated by the elements of the form v ® v +q(v).1 (1 is the identity
of TJ(V) = R). The Clifford algebra associated to q and V is the quotient
algebra T(V)/Iq(V). If q = 0 then Io(V) is generated by the vectors v ® v.
The quotient is well isomorphic to 1\v.
1.3.4
The graded ideals of AE*
An ideal I of 1\ E* is a subalgebra satisfying:
a/\w E I,
for all
a E I
and wE I\E*.

12
CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
Definition 1.8 An ideal I of 1\ E* is called a graded ideal if it admits the
following vectorial decomposition:
Example 2 Let us consider the following subalgebra
It is a graded ideal of 1\ E*. As this ideal has a non-zero square if i < n/2,
the algebra 1\ E* is not simple.
Let I be a graded ideal of 1\ E*. Every element a: E I admits a decomposi-
tion in homogeneous components:
As I is graded, this decomposition is the decomposition associated with the
graduation of I.
Lemma 3 If 10 =f. {O} then 1= 1\ E*.
Proof. In fact, 1\0 E n 1= 10, As I is an ideal, 10 =f. {O} implies 10 = lR.
Then, every linear form on E belongs to I. As these forms generate !\-E*
we then 1\ E* = I. •
1.3.5
Generators of a graded ideal
Let us consider the subspace A(I) c E defined by:
A(I) = {X EEl i(X)a: E I , Va: E I}.
Its orthogonal space is, by definition, the subspace of 1\ E* given by:
A(I).l = {f E E* I f(X) = 0 , "IX E A(I)}.
We denote by I\A(I).l the subalgebra of I\E* generated by A(I).l.
Proposition 1.8 Let I be a graded ideal of I\E* verifying 10 = {O}. There
exists a system of generators of I constituted by elements of 1\ A(I).l.

1.3. THE GRADED ALGEBRA I\(E*)
13
Proof. In fact, let {iI,"',!r} be a basis of A(I)l... Wecomplete this system
in a basis {iI,'" ,Jr,hr+I,'" ,fLn} of 1\1 E*.Let us suppose that II =I- {O}.
Let {a1,'" ,ak} be a system of generators of II. The decomposition of these
vectors on the fixed basis of 1\1E* is written:
r
n
ai = La{/i + L
b1hj.
j=l
j=r+1
Consider a basis {Y1, ..,1';.,XI,·· · ,Xn- r } of E of which the dual basis is
{iI,'" .i-,hr+l,"', fLn}. Then, the system {XI,' " ,Xn - r } forms a basis
of A(I). These vectors satisfy !i(Xj) = 0 for all i and i. Thus
n
i(Xk)Cti =
L
b1hj(Xk) E 10 ,
j=r+1
As, by hypothesis, 10 = {O}, we have i(Xk)ai = O.
Moreover, we have
hr+j(Xk) = Ojk. This implies that b1 = 0 and
r
ai = La{/i·
j=1
Thus, {iI," ',!r} generates II . We shall now prove that the exterior pro-
ducts !il A·· ·A! it A~t+l . . 'A~k generate the component Ik. Every element
f3 E Ik can be written:
f3 = L G,;,li2···ikAl A ... A !i k +6,
where 6 is a k-exterior form of the type
with, when bili2,..ik =I- 0, at least one of the gij equal to ~j' Thus for every
vector Xj of A(I) we have:
i(Xj)f3 = LG,;,li2...iki(Xj)(Jil A· · · A!ik) + i(Xj)6
and i(Xj)f3 Elk-I' But
So i(Xj)6 Elk-I.
If the exterior form 6 contains a term of the form
hil A . . . A ~k' then i(Xj)6 contains at least one term of the form ~l A

14
CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
... A hi"-l and this term will be in Ik-l. By induction, we suppose that
Ik-l is generated by /\ A(I)J..~
Then hil A ... A »«: cannot appear in
the decomposition of e, and each term of this decomposition contains at
least a form k
Then /\ A(I)J.. generates the component Ik and the graded
ideal I. Now suppose that 1I = {O}. In this case we consider the smallest
integer i, i 2: 1 such as Ii
=1= {O}. The same arguments as above permit the
completion of the proof. •
1.4
Linear system associated to a p-form
Let a be an exterior p-form on E. From a basis {eb e2,' .. ,en} of E we can
define linear forms aiIi 2 .••i p_ l on E by:
for all X E E. This linear system
1 ~ il < i2 < ... < ip-l
~ n, obviously depends on a and on the basis
{el, e2,. .. , en}. However, it enables one to construct a linear space which
depends only on a and does not depend on the basis.
1.4.1
Linear system associated to a p-form
D~finition 1.9 The linear subspace A*(a) of /\1 E = E* generated by the
linear form {~li2...ip-l} is called the associated linear system of a.
Of course, this linear space does not depend on the choice of the basis
{el,e2,···,en}. In fact, let
{e~,e~, ···,e~} be a second basis of E: Let us
denote by (~li2...ip_) the corresponding linear system. If e~ = ~ atej then
This proves that the linear space generated by the linear forms aili2 ...ip_l
coincides with the linear space generated by the forms ~li2 ...ip-l'
Definition 1.10 The dimension of A*(a) is called the rank of a and it is
denoted by rank(a) (or r(a)).

1.4. LINEAR SYSTEM ASSOCIATED TO A P-FORM
15
The construction of A*(a) shows that this linear space is the smaller lin-
ear subspace of E* such that the exterior p-form a can be decomposed in a
product oflinear forms belonging to this linear subspace. So if {ft, 12, ···, fr}
is a basis of A*(a) then
a=
We always have
deg(a) ~ rank(a),
deg(a) being the degree of a. An important class of exterior forms corre-
sponds to the forms having a degree equal to its rank. We will study these
forms later.
1.4.2
The linear subspace associated to a
Let A(a) be the linear subspace of E defined by:
A(a) = {X EEl i(X)a = O}.
Theorem 1.1 We have:
A(a) = (A*(a))l- = {X EEl f(X) = 0 Vf E A*(a)}.
Proof. Let {ft, 12,·· ·, fr} , r = rank(a), be a basis of A*(a). The exterior
form a is written:
a =
L
aiIi2···ipfil 1\ . . . 1\ fip.
l:::;il <...<ip:::;r
Let be X E (A*(a))l-. Then fi(X) = 0 for all i. Hence i(X)a = 0 and
X E A(a). This gives (A*(a))l- C A(a). Conversely, let X E A(a). Let us
consider a basis {ell e2, · ··, en} of E. The linear forms
a iIi2···ip_1 = i(eil)i(~2) ·
· · i(~p_I)a
generate A*(a). As X E E,
i (X )a = 0 and i(X)aiIi2...ip_I =o.
So, f(X) = 0 for all f E A*(a). This proves the theorem.•
Corollary 1.1 rank(a) = codimA(a)

16
CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
Example 4 If a is a form of degree equal to 0, then rank(a) = 0 and if a
is a non zero form of degree 1 then rank(a) = 1.
Proposition 1.9 If a is a non zero linear form on E, the associated sub-
space of a is the hyperplane 01E defined by a.
This is a direct consequence of the definition.
Remark 2 The study of the space A*(a) is interesting for the classification
of the exterior p-forms. In fact, the dimension of these spaces is an invari-
ant, up to isomorphism, of the form a. In the following section we shall
see that this invariant gives the complete classification in the case where the
form is of degree 2. For a form of any degree it is little more complicated.
The classification necessitates the study of new invariants.

Exterior 2-forms
1.5.1
Rank of an exterior 2-form
Let {e1' e2, ...,en} be a basis of E and {II,12, ...,In} the dual basis in 1\1E.
An exterior 2-form on E can be written:
a = a 12II /\12 + a 13/11...13 + ... + an-InIn-1 /\ In.
The associated linear system is generated by the linear forms i(ej )a. This
system is given by:
!
a1 = -a12h - a 13h -
- a 1nIn = 0,
a2 = +a12II - a23h -
- a2nIn = 0,
an = a 1nII + a 2n;2 +
+ an-InIn-1 = 0 .
Its rank is equal to the rank of the antisymmetric matrix

Proposition 1.10 Every exterior 2-form on a vector space E is of even
rank.

1.5. EXTERIOR 2-FORMS
17
Then we have:
Let us consider the exterior 2-form a. Let X = EXi~ and Y = Eli~
be two vectors of E . Thus
a(X,Y) = Laij(Xi}j -Xjli).
i<j
The partial derivative of the form a, with respect to the variable Xi, is
defined by:

1.5.2
Reduction of an exterior 2-form
Lemma 5 There is a basis {VI, V2,...,vn } of E such that:
2. a(vi, Vj) = 0 , (i,j) ~ {(I, 2), ... ; (2p - 1, 2p), (2, 1), ... , (2p, 2p - I)}.

18
CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
Proof. Suppose that the form a satisfies a =f. o. Thus there are independent
vectors VI and V2 such as a(V},V2) =f. O. Let us consider
Hi = {x EEl a(Vi, x) = O},
i = 1,2 , and H = HI n H2. If F is the linear space generated by the vectors
VI and V2, then E = H ffi F, dim H = n - 2. The restriction of the exterior
form a to the linear space H is ofrank 2p-2. By induction on the dimension
of the space E we complete the proof.•
Theorem 1.2 For every exterior 2-form {3 of rank 2p, on a vector space E,
there exists a basis {jI, f 2, ... , f2P } of E* such that
Proof. The proof is based on the preceding lemma. Let us consider the
basis {v}, ...,vn } given by the previous lemma. If {fI, I',...,r} is the dual
basis, the exterior 2-form
satisfies ({3 - a) (V2i-I, V2i) = 0 for i = 1,2, .. . ,p. As it also satisfies ({3 - a)
(Vi ,Vj) = 0, then {3 - a = o. •
1.5.3
Determination of the rank
Proposition 1.11 Let a be a non-trivial exterior 2-form on E.
Then the
rank of a is 2p if and only if we have
In fact, we can write

Cartan's Lemma
Theorem 1.3 Let !I, h, ... ,jp be independent linear forms on E. Let us
consider linear forms cPI' cP2' .. . ,cPp on E satisfying

1.7. MONOMIAL FORMS
Then the linear forms <Pi verify
<Pi = "L, CLij Ii /\ !;
j
with CLij = aji·
19
Proof. First suppose p = n. In this case one has <Pi = LCLij/j , because,{fI, 12,"·' In}
is a basis of E*. The equation
implies
"L, CLij!; /\ Ii = O.
Since the linear forms Ij are independent this exterior 2-form is zero when-
ever its coefficients with respect to the basis {Ii /\!;h<j are zero. Thus
CLij - aji = 0, and the matrix (CLij) is symmetric.
Now, suppose that p < n and consider a basis {fI, ...,fp,gP+l,...,gn} of
/\1 E*. We have:

1.7
Monomial Forms
Definition 1.11 A non-trivial exterior p-form a on E is called a monomial
p-form, if there exist p linearly independent linear forms fI , ...,I p such as
It is clear that if a is a monomial p-form then
rank (a) = p = deg (a).

20
CHAPTER 1. EXTERIOR FORMS
Theorem 1.4 Let a be an exterior p-form on E. Then a is a monomial
form if and only if
rank (a) = p = deg(a).
Proof. Let a be a p-form verifying rank (a) = p . Let us consider a basis
{h, ...,fp} of the linear space A* (a) associated to a .
According to the
definition of this space one has
and a is a monomial form.
•
Corollary 1.2 A non-trivial exterior n-form on E, with dimE = n, is of
rank n.
Proposition 1.12 Every non-trivial exterior form of degree n-1, is a mono-
mial form.
Proof. Let a be an exterior form of degree n -1 on E. Consider the linear
map
defined by h(f) = f /\ a. As dim AnE = 1, dim ker h = n or n - 1. We can
find a basis {fl, ..., fn} of E* in order that {II, ..., fn-l} be a basis of ker h.
We can write

The map h is determined by
h(F) = (-l)i-lUif l /\ ... /\ I".
Thus a is zero if h = o. If h i= 0 we have Ui = 0 for i = 1, ...,n - 1, and a is
a monomial form. •
Corollary 1.3 A non-trivial exterior form on E of degree n -1, is of rank
n-l.
Corollary 1.4 A non-trivial exterior form on E, of degree n - 2, is of rank
n - 2 or n.

1.7. MONOMIAL FORMS
21
Proof. If deg(a) = n - 2, then rank(a) = n, or n - 1 or n - 2. Suppose
that rank(a) = n - 1. Let A(a) be the associated linear space of a. The
dimension of the quotient space E/A(a) is n -1. As a is a form of degree
n-2 in A(E/A(a)) c A(E), a is monomial ofrank n -2. This is impossible.
Therefore rank(a) f:. n - 1.
Now consider the case where dim E = 4. The exterior 2-form a defined
by
is of rank 4 = n. •

Exterior Systems
2.1.1
Systems of exterior equations
Let E be an n-dimensional real vector space and AE* = E9 Ai E* its exterior
algebra. An exterior equation is an equation of the form
0=0
where 0 E AP E*. A solution of this exterior equation is a linear subspace
H of E verifying
0(X1,X2,'" ,Xp ) = 0 ,
for all Xl,X2,'" .x, E H.
In the case p = 1the corresponding exterior equation is a linear equation.
For p = 2 the exterior form 0 is an alternating bilinear form, and every linear
subspace contained in the kernel of this bilinear form is a solution.
Definition 2.1 An exterior system is defined by a finite number of exterior
equations on E :

1. Suppose that the equations of the exterior system are given by linear
forms. Then every subspace contained in the kernel of the exterior
system is a solution.
2. Let us consider the system defined on ]R2n by the equation
0= II /\h + fa /\14+ ...+ hn-l/\ hn'
where {II, ...,hn} is the dual basis of a given basis {eI,
,e2n} of
]R2n. Then the subspace H generated by the vectors {eb e3,

is a solution of the exterior system 0 = O. It is clear that this solution is
maximal (for the inclusion relation). It is called a Lagragian subspace
of (]R2n, 0). Of course, such a maximal solution is not unique.
2.2
Resolution of the equation e= 0 with eE Aq(E)
In this section, we study the particular case of an exterior system with only

Definition 2.3 The {ui1...ip } with 1 ~ i l < i 2 < ... < i p ~ n are called the
Pliicker coordinates of the linear subspace H .
As the dimension of H is p, there exists ill i2, ...,ip such that ui1...ip
=1= o.
Therefore we can consider the Plucker coordinates as a system of coordinates
of the projective kind.
2.2.2
Examples
1. Let H be a one-dimensional subspace of ]R3. It is generated by a non-
zero vector V = (a,b, c). The Plucker coordinates are the components
(a,b,c) of this vector. It is clear that these coordinates entirely define
this vector subspace.

The Plucker coordinates of H are the parameters (u I2, u13, u23) • They

define a system of Plucker coordinates of H.
2.2.3
Change of Pliicker coordinates
Let H be a p-plane, that is a p-dimensional vectorial subspace in JRn. Let
us fix a basis {eI, ...,en} of JRn. The Plucker coordinates of H are defined
from an arbitrary basis {VI, ..., vp } of H, and thus depend on this choice. We
will examine the effect of a change of bases on the writing of these Plucker
coordinates.
Let {WI, ...,wp } be a new basis of H and let us denote by P the matrix of
the change of basis. Let M = (a1)and M' = (/31) be the matrices defined
by
n
Vi = 'La1ej,
j=1
and
n
Wi = 'L!31ej.
j=1
These matrices are connected by the following relation:

M'=MP.
Let us denote by u i1...ip the Plucker coordinates of H , with respect to the
basis {VI, ...,vp } , and u,i1 ...ip the Plucker coordinates of H with respect to
the basis {WI, ..., wp } . The above relationship implies:
with A= detP f= O.
These formulae show well that the change of Plucker coordinates corre-
sponds to a change of projective coordinates.
2.2.4
Determination of a p-plane
Let H be a p-plane in R", let {eb ...,en} be a fixed basis of jRn and {Vb ..., Vp }
a basis of H. Let (ui1...ip ) be the Plucker coordinates of H with respect to
this basis. Let
n
Vi = L ~ej
(i = 1, ...,p).
j=1
A system of equations of H is formed by writing that the matrix
is of rank p, that is, by cancelling all the minors of order p + 1. By expand-
ing with respect to the first line, each of these minors of order p + 1, one
finds linear equations in the variables Xi whose coefficients are the minors
of order p of the matrix (a~).However, these last minors are the Plucker
coordinates of H. Thus one finds a system of linear equations defining H
whose coefficients are the Plucker coordinates of H.

Thus the equation
x (bd - cb') - y (ad - ca') + z (ab' -1)(1/) = 0,
that is,
XU 23 _ yu 13 + zu12 = O.
We can note that any system (a,{3,,) is a system of Plucker coordinates
of a 2-plane of lR3 if one of its parameters is non-zero. In the general case,
the situation is more delicate; in fact, a system ('li1...i p ) with 1 S i l < i 2 <
... < i p S n does not necessarily define a system of Plucker coordinates of
a p-plane in lRn • In the following subsection, we will describe the necessary
and sufficient conditions in order that, such a system corresponds to Plucker
coordinates of a p-plane.
2.2.5
Characterization of Pliicker coordinates
Let {ui1...ip } be a system of real numbers with 1 S il < i2 < ... < ipS n;
we suppose that there exist iI, i2, ...,i p so that Ui1...ip =I O. The aim of this
section is to describe the conditions on the system (Ui 1...ip ) for this system
to represent the Plucker coordinates of a p-plane H. Following the definition,
a necessary condition is
Assume that this condition is satisfied and let us consider the exterior p-form
() given by :
o= L U i1···ip fl 1\ . .. 1\ fp,
where {II" . . ,r} is the dual basis of a given basis {el, ...,en} of R".
Theorem 2.1 The system {Ui1...ip } is a system of Pliicker coordinates of a
p-plane H if and only if the exterior p-jortii () is a monomial form.
Proof. Let us suppose that there is a p-plane H whose Plucker coordinates
are ui 1···ip . Let us consider the basis {el,' .. ,e,,} of H associated with these
coordinates and note {gl,"" gp} the dual basis.
The definition of these
coordinates shows that:
() = gl 1\ . . . 1\ gpo
Thus it is a monomial exterior form. Conversely, if () is a monomial exterior
form, that is, () = hI 1\ ... 1\ hp, then the plane H whose basis is given by the
dual vectors {VI,...,vp } of the forms {hI, ..., hp} has as Plucker coordinates
(Ui1···ip) ••

Example 1 Study of the Grassmann manifold G2,4.
Let us consider the system (u12, ul3, ul4, u23, u24, u34) , at least one of the
coordinates ui j being non-zero and set ui j = _uj i if i 2: i- Let us seek the
conditions for this system to be a system of Plucker coordinates of a 2-plane
in ]R4. Let us consider the exterior 2-form:
Then () is a monomial exterior form if and only if it is of rank 2, that is, if
and only if its associated linear system:
is of rank 2. This is equivalent to saying that the matrix
is of rank 2. A13 this matrix is antisymmetric, this condition is equivalent to
the condition:
det(A) = 0
(recall that A # 0). Then we have proved :
Proposition 2.1 The system (ui j ) , 1 s i s j
~ 4, defines a system of
Plilcker coordinates of a 2-plane in]R4 if and only if
Thus this last equation represents the equation of the Grassmann manifold
G2,4 = {2-planes in ]R4} ,
which appears as an homogeneous algebraic submanifold of the projective
space P (]R6) .

It is assumed that () is an exterior q-form in the vector space E.
Let
{ej ,.. . ,en} be a fixed basis of E and let {II,"·'fn} be its dual basis.
The exterior form () is written :
The q-planes H solutions of () = 0
Let H be a q-plane in E and let {hI, .. . ,hq} be a basis of H; let us denote
by (Ui1···iq) the corresponding Plucker coordinates of H, the basis of E being
fixed. If H is a solution of () = 0 then

equation.

2.3. ALGEBRAICALLY EQUIVALENT SYSTEMS

Proof. It is clear that if H is a solution and if HI is contained in H , then
O(Hd = o.
Conversely, let us suppose that every q-plane contained in H is a solution.
Let us suppose that H is not a solution. Then, there are q independent
vectors (XI,'" ,X q) in H satisfying:
The subspace HI of H generated by XI,'" ,X q is of dimension q. It is not
a solution of 0 = O. This gives a contradiction and H is solution to 0 = O.
The p-planes solution with P < q
Proposition 2.4 Every p-plane, with p < q, is a solution of the exterior
equation
In fact, let XI, . . . , X q be q vectors in a given p-plane H. If p < q these
vectors are not independent and

Ideal generated by an exterior system
Let (5) = (01 = 0", " Or = 0) be an exterior system with deg(Oi) = Pi > O.
Our purpose is to compare this system with other systems having the same
solutions. Let
By construction 1(5) is an ideal of /\ E*, called the ideal generated by the
system (5). It is clear that any solution of the system (5) is a solution of
the exterior equation a = 0, whatever the form a belonging to 1 (5) .
Definition 2.4 The system (5) is complete if any exterior form annihilat-
ing each solution of the system belongs to the ideal 1(5) generated by (5).

CHAPTER 2. EXTERiOR SYSTEMS
2.3.2
Examples
1. Every linear system is complete.
2. Let us consider the exterior system in ]R4 given by:
Let H be a 2-plane in ]R4 with Plucker coordinates (ui j ) . These coor-
dinates verify,
U 12U34 _ u 13u24 + u 14u23 = 0.
As H is a solution of the exterior system we have
(h (H) = (h(H) = (}3 (H) = 0,
which implies
{
u13 = 0,
u14 = 0,
u12 _ u34 = 0.
This linear system is thus reduced to:
I
u13 = 0,
u14 = 0,
u12 = 0,
u34 = 0,
and any solution H of the exterior system has as Plucker coordinates
(0,0,0, U 23,U24 , 0) .
Let us consider the exterior form (3 = II /\12. It satisfies f3 (H) = °too
because u12 = 0. This form is not in the ideal 1(8) and the exterior
system (8) is not complete.
3. The exterior system in ]R4 given by
{
(}1 = II /\12 = 0,
(}2 = II /\h =°
is not complete.

2.3.3
Algebraically equivalent systems
Definition 2.5 Two exterior systems (B) and (B') are algebraically equiv-
alent if they generate the same ideal, that is, if I(B) = I(B') .
Let us consider the exterior system in jRn
{
II=O,
12=0,
() = 0,
where II and 12 are linear forms and () an exterior 2-form. Every algebraically
equivalent system has the following form:
{
alI +bh = 0,
cII +dh =0,
e() +II 1\ g +12 1\ h = 0,
where a,b,c,d,e E R, ad - be i= 0, e i= 0, and g,ne AljRn.
It is clear that two algebraically equivalent systems have the same solutions.
On the other hand two systems can have the same solutions without being
algebraically equivalent.
The two exterior systems in jR4
{
II 1\13 = 0,
II 1\ 14 = 0,
II 1\ 12 - 13 1\ f4 = 0,
and
{
II 1\12 = 0,
II 1\13 = 0,
II 1\ 14 = 0,
13 1\ f4 = 0,
have the same solutions but are not algebraically equivalent. Indeed, the
Plucker coordinates of the 2-plane solution of the first system satisfies u13 =
0, u14 = 0, u12 = 0, and u34 = 0. Such a plane is also a solution of the
second system. These two systems are not algebraically equivalent because
the form 13 1\ f4 is not in the ideal generated by the first system.
Proposition 2.5 If the system (B) is complete, every system (8') having
the same solution as (S) is algebraically equivalent to (8).
2.4
Vector space associated with an exterior sys-
tem
Let (8) be an exterior system on E.

34
CHAPTER 2. EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Definition 2.6 The vector space associated with (S) is the smallest sub-
space Q of E* such that AQ contains a subset generating I(S).
One deduces from this that the linear system
is algebraically equivalent to (8).
Definition 2.7 The rank of the exterior system (8) is the dimension of the
associated linear spaceQ.
Proposition 2.6 Two algebraically equivalent systems have the same rank.
This arises directly from the definition of the rank.
In the following chapter we will study a particular class of exterior systems
in which each equation is of degree two. These systems correspond to the
linear models of the equations of statistical mechanics introduced by Nambu.

Chapter 3
k-SYMPLECTIC
EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Introduction.
The classical mechanics has led to the study of the exterior equation
() = 0,
where () is an exterior 2-form of maximum rank. In the first chapter we
have recalled the classification of exterior 2-forms, without returning to the
classic study of vector spaces equipped with such forms.
We propose, in this chapter, to generalize this symplectic geometry by
replacing the symplectic equation by an exterior system of symplectic type.
We would have been able to widen the symplectic geometry by considering
forms of high degree. We note that recent works envisage structures defined
by an exterior equation of degree 3 (see [G.M] and [KIl).
One of our motivations for considering an exterior system of degree 2
rather than an exterior equation of degree 3 comes from mechanics. Doing so
seems a good approach to formalizing the statistical mechanics pointed out
by Nambu. Other motivations are related to the classification of the systems
of bilinear alternating forms. The multi-symplectic systems we are going to
study in this chapter appear naturally in the 3-dimensional case. In high
dimension an infinity of systems which are not algebraically equivalent can
be defined. The k-symplectic systems are defined directly by conditions of
regularity; they can be interpreted as models of exterior systems of maximum
rank.

36
CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
3.1
Classification of exterior systems
Let (S) be an exterior system of Rn spanned by
()l = 0, . .. , ()k = 0,
where ()i = °are exterior two forms (()i E A2(Rn)), and we write (S) =
{()1, ...,()k}. Suppose that the two forms ()i are independent in the real space
A2(Rn)*.
If k = 1 the classification of systems (S) = {()l} is determined by the
rank of ()l. In this section we propose to study the classification problem of
such systems for k ;::: 2.
It will be instructive to recall some fundamental definitions.
3.1.1
Rank of (8)
The associated space to the system (S) is the smallest subspace A*(S) of
(Rn )* such that 1\ A*(S) contains a subset spanning I (S) .
Definition 3.1 The mnk of the exterior system (S) is the dimension of the
associated space A*(S).
Notice that A(S) = {X ERn I i(X)() = 0,V() E S}. It is clear that the
rank of (S) coincides with the codimension of A(S).
3.1.2
Classification for k = 2 and n = 3
The case rank(S) = 1
In this case we have dim(A(S)) = 2. Let {el,e2} be a basis of A(S) which we
extend to a basis {el,e2,e3} ofR3. Relative to the dual basis {w1,w2,w3 }
of {ei.es.ea} the forms ()l and ()2 can be written
{
()l = " cu» 1\ wi
L..J
l]
,
(j2 = "
C~·wi 1\ wi
L..J
l]
,
where C!i are real constants. We have
i(el)O' =L C{jWi =°
i
and

3.1. CLASSIFICATION OF EXTERiOR SYSTEMS
37
Thus C~k = 0 for alll,j = 1,2. This implies that ()l and ()2 are identically
zero, and thus rank(8) = 0, this is absurd. Consequently, there does not
exist a system of 2-forms of degree two and rank 1.
The case rank(8) = 2
In these conditions we have dim(A(8)) = 1. Denote by {el} a basis of
A(8) that we extend to a basis {ej,e2,e3}. In the dual basis {wI, w2,w3} of
{el, e2, e3 } the forms ()l and ()2 take the form
{
()l = '"cu» /\ wi
LJ
tJ
'
()2 = EC,&wi /\wj.
We have i(el)()l = Ej Cfjwj = 0, then C{k = 0 for all I,k = 1,2. Thus
{
()l = Ci3w2 r; w3
()2 = C~3w2 /\ w3
the forms ()l and ()2 are linearly dependent in A2(JR3)*, which contradicts
the hypothesis. Then there does not exist a system of two forms of degree
two of rank 2.
The case rank(8) = 3
For this case the system (8) is non-degenerate (it is of maximum rank) .
Suppose that ()l =f: O. We can find a basis 1wl,w2,w3} of (JR3)* such that
()l = wI /\ w3. Set ()2 = awl /\ w3+ bw2 /\ w + cwl /\ w2. Since the system
{()l, ()2 _ a()l} is algebraically equivalent to (8), we can assume that a = O.
The hypothesis rank(8) = 3 implies that b =f: 0 or c =f: O. Suppose that b =f: O.
Then (8) is equivalent to {()1,()2jb} which allows us to assume that b'= 1.
Thus ()2 = w2/\ w3+ cwl /\ w2 and the change of basis oi = wi , i = 1,2 and
0 3 = w3 + cwl gives the model according to
{
()l = 01 /\ 03,
()2 = 02 /\ 03.
Such a system will be called a 2-symplectic exterior system, or, more gen-
erally a 2-symplectic system. We deduce the following proposition:
Proposition 3.1 Every 2-system (8) of rank 3 in ]R3, is a 2-symplectic
exterior system.
In this case the system (8) possesses a maximal solution F, of dimension
2 defined by F = ker 0 3.

38
CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
3.1.3
Classification for k = 3, n = 3
Let (8) = {Ol,02,03} be a 3-system, that is, the three forms Oi are in-
dependent in A2(JR3)*.
If the rank of (8) is 3, each of the 2-systems
{OI,02},{Ol,03},{02,03} is 2-symplectic.
Indeed, according to the above
considerations, if this were not the case the forms Ol,02 , (}3 would be in-
dependent. The system {Ol, 02} is 2-symplecticj then there exists a basis
{wI,w2, w3 } of (JR3)* such that:
and
03 = awl /\ w3 + bw2/\ w3+ cwl /\ w2.
The system {Ol, 02, (}3 - aOI -
bf)2} is algebraically equivalent to (S). Then
we can suppose that 03 = cwl /\ w2• By hypothesis c =1= 0, then we can take
c = 1 to obtain the following model
3.1.4
Classification for k = 3, n = 4, rank(S) = 4.
Maximal solutions
Let (S) = {Ol, 02 , (}3} be an exterior system of rank 4 in R4, the exterior
forms Oi are of degree 2.
Proposition 3.2 The dimension of all maximal solution is less than 3.
As a matter of fact, for the opposite case the rank of (8) would be zero.
Systems equipped with a maximal solution of dimension 3
Let H be a maximal solution of (8) of basis {el ' e2,es} which we extend to
a basis {el, e2, e3,e4} of R4 with the dual basis {wl,w2,w3,w4}. But H is a
solution of this system, therefore we have:

3.2. K-SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
39
Since the rank of the system is maximum, the rank of the matrix (04) is
equal to 3. We deduce that the system is equivalent to
Such a system is 3-symplectic in ]R4.
Case where the solution is I-dimensional
Suppose that each form () = L:Qiff of this system (S) is of maximum rank.
In this case all solutions of this system are of dimension 1. Otherwise the
existence of a maximal solution of dimension 2 proves that the associated
ideal to the system is 2-dimensional.
Then there exist two linear forms
{w1,w2 } , such that
()i = w1 A rfi + w2 A~.
The rank of the system (rfi, ~)i=1,2 ,3 is less than 2, hence there exists i
such that rfi = a.B{ + b.Bf, where i =I j and i =I k. The rank of the form
()= ()i _ a()i - b()k is less than 2, which contradicts the hypothesis. Hence all
solutions are l-dimensional. The problem of classification of such systems
consists in classifying a system of skew-symmetric forms of rank 4, such
that every combination is also of rank 4 (this problem is related to the
determination of the number of independent vector fields in all points on
the 3-dimensional sphere). Then,
Remark 3 The 3-symplectic system which we have determined appears as
the 'simple' system of maximum mnk. Any other system of this nature can
be seen as a deformation of the latter.
3.2
k-symplectic exterior systems
Let E be an n(k + 1)-dimensional vector space over a commutative field lK
of characteristic =I 2, let F be an n-codimensional subspace of E and let
()l, "', ()k be k exterior 2-forms on E.

40
CHAPTER 3. K-SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Definition 3.2 We say that (jI,
, (Jk is a k-symplectic system associated
to F (or that the (k+l)-tuple ((Jl ,
, (Jk; F) defines a k-symplectic structure
on E) if the following conditions are fulfilled :
1. the exterior system {(Jl, ... ,(Jk} is non-degenerate, that is,
A((Jl) n··· nA((Jk) = {O};
2. (JP(x,y) = 0 forallx,YEF and p=I, ...,k.
Recall that the associated space to the alternating form (J is the set
A((J)= {x EEl (J(x,y) = 0 for all y E E}.
A subspace E 1 of E is called totally isotropic with respect to the form (J
if it is a solution of t~e equation (J = 0, that is
(J(x,y) = 0
for all x, y EEl. Thus, the subspace F is totally isotropic with respect to
the form (JP for all p = 1, ..., k.
3.2.1
Solutions of k-symplectic exterior system
Let (S) be a k-symplectic exterior system (the subspace F is fixed to avoid
all reference to this subspace). A subspace H of E is a solution of (S) if
(JP(x, y) = 0
for all x, y E H. By the definition of the k-system (S) the subspace F is a
maximal solution of (8).

{

(Jk = Ej=1 wki /\ wi

This last structure will be called the canonical k- symplectic structure
of jRn(k+l).

2. A symplectic vector space is a vector space of even dimension equipped
with an exterior 2-form o of maximum rank. A Lagrangian subspace
of E is a maximal solution of the exterior equation a = o. Such a
solution exists, and it is n-dimensional.
Let (E1,u1),..., (Ek,uk) be symplectic vector spaces and let LP be
a Lagrangian subspace of EP. Every quotient space EP/V
is of di-
mension n, there exists a vector subspace B of dimension n and a
surjective linear mapping 1rP: EP --t B such that
ker 1rP = V
for all p( p= 1, . .. , k) . Let (E 1 x . . . X E k ,u) be the product sym-
plectic space where a is the symplectic form defined by:
u((XI, ... ,Xk), (Yl, ... ,Yk)) = u1(Xl,yI) + ...+Uk(Xk,Yk).
Let E be the vector subspace of E1 x ... X Ek defined by:
E = {(Xl, ... ,Xk) EEl x ... X Ek I 1r1(X1) = ... = 1rk(Xk) } .
The linear mapping 1r : E --t B such that
1r(XI, . . . ,Xk) = 1r1(X1) = . . . =1rk(Xk)
for each (Xl, .. . ,Xk) E E, is surjective and satisfies
ker 1r = L 1 X •.• x t),
Let i : E --t E1 X • •• x Ek be the canonical injection and pr"
(u = 1,. .. ,k), the canonical projection E1 x . . . X Ek --t BU. For
every u the composite pru 0 i is the restriction of pr" to E ; it is
surjective linear mapping. It is clear that the space E is of dimension
n(k+1). For every u (u = 1, . . . ,k), we take ()U = (pruo i)*uu.
Thus (()1, ... ,Ok;ker 1r) is a k-symplectic exterior system on E .
3.2.3
Classification of k-symplectic exterior systems
Theorem 3.1 Let (()1, ... ,()k ; F) be a k-symplectic exterior system on E.
Then there exists a basis (wpi, wih$ p$k,l$i$n of E* such that:

CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Proof.
Let {iI , ... , fnk' 91,
, 9n} be a basis of E
such that F is
spanned by the system {iI,
, fnk}, and let hI, ... , ,nk, wI, . .. , wn}
be its dual basis. The second condition of the definition of a k-symplectic
exterior system allows us to see that the bilinear forms (JP take the following
form:

The set {J.Lpj I p = 1', .. . , k and j = 1, ... ,n} is a basis of the dual space
F* of F. In fact, if an element x E F satisfies J.Lpj(x) = 0, for all
p
and j . Then the linear forms i(x)(JP vanish identically, and it followss from
the non-degeneracy of {OI, .. . , Ok} that x = O. The linear forms J.Lpj are
independent in F*, and consequently they form a basis of F*. The linear
forms w pj are independent in E*, the system
is a basis of E*, and we have:
n
Op = L wPj /\wi.

Let (epi, ~h~ p~k,l~i~n be a basis of E having (wPi, wih~p9, l~i~n as
its dual basis. The bases (Ii, 9th~i~nk, l~t~n and (epi, eih~p~k, l~i~n are
related by:
This proves, in particular, that the vectors epj belong to F, and that
F = kerw1 n ··· n kerwk••
Corollary 3.1 The subspace F is a solution of (S).
Definition 3.3 The basis (epi , ~h~p~k, l~i~n of E having as its dual ba-

Ann(F) of F.
It is an immediate consequence of the theorem of classification. Recall
that the annihilator Ann(F) is given by:
Ann(F) = {f E E* If(x) = 0
Vx E F} .
This vector space is isomorphic to (E/ F)*. With respect to the k-symplectic
basis (epi, eih~ p~k , I~i~n of E and the dual basis (wPi , wih~~k, I~i~n, we
have:
1. Ann(F) is spanned by the linear forms wI, . . . , wn ,
2. FP is spanned by the vectors epl, ... ,epn.
Definition 3.4 The subspaces F I , • • • ,Fk are called the characteristic spaces
of the k-symplectic exterior system.
For each p = 1, . .. , k we take
We have
(JP(x,y + f) = (JP(x,y)
for every x E FP, y E E and f E F, then, (JP(x,y) depends only on the coset
y of y modulo F; this allows us to set
7f(x+y,x' +y') = (JP(x,y') -(JP(x',y).
7J P defines a symplectic structure on (]P = FP ED E/ F.

k-symplectic endomorphisms
Let E be a vector space of dimension n(k+l) over K and let (OI, ... ,Okj F )
be a k-symplectic exterior system on E.
Definition 3.5 Let f be an endomorphism of E. We say that it preserves
the k-symplectic exterior system (01, .•. , Ok; F) if it leaves invariant both
the system ofexteriorforms {01, • •• , Ok} and the subspaceF, in other words,
if the following conditions are satisfied :
1. f(F) c;, F,
2. There is a E S k , such that
()P(f(x),f(y»
= (P(P)(x,y)
for all p(p= 1,... ,k) and x,y E E, where Sk is the group of all
permutations of the set {I, ...,k} . We denote by G the group of all
automorphisms of the space E preserving the k-symplectic structure
(O\ ... ,OkjF) .
3.3.1
The group Sp(k, n; E)
Let Sp(k,n jE) be the subgroup G defined by:
Sp(k,njE) = {f E G I()P(f(x),f(y» = ()P(x,y), for all x, y E E and p},
Sp(k, nj E) is called the k-symplectic group of E, and each element of
Sp(k, nj E) is called a k-symplectic automorphism of E .
Every element of G is a composite of elements of Sp(k,n; E), and the
isomorphisms uof E defined by
u(fpi) = eq(p)i,
u(fi) = ei
for all a E Sk, p =1, . .. , k and i = 1, .. . , n~ thus we can to return the study
of G to Sp(k, nj E) .
Let Sp(k, nj lK) be the group of matrices of k-symplectic automorphisms
of E , with respect to the k-symplectic basis.
Proposition 3.4 Sp(k,n; lK) is the group of all matrices of the following
type:
(3.1)

where T, S1,···, Sk are nxn matrices, with coefficients in K, such that,
T is invertible and TtSp = Sprr, for each p (p = 1, . . . , k).
Proof. Let ! E Sp(k, nj E),
p(p= 1, .. . ,k) and i.i' = 1,···, n . Write
!(e;,) ~ tel, e, +t(t epe,,) ,
where

Let T' (resp. T3) be the matrix with coefficients t';i (resp.
t:~) where
p, q = 1,... , k. The matrices T' and TC (p = 1, ... , k) which are inver-
tible, are related by:
r: = t(T'-l).
For q =1= p we have (fl(J(e.pj),!(ej')) = Oq(e.pj,ej') = 0, then
n
Lt~t'j, = o.
i=l
Hence T3tT' = o.
But the matrix T' is invertible, thus the matrices
T3 = o. According to ()P(J(ej),J(ej')) = OP(ej,ej') we have

Consequently the matrices Sp with coefficientst't(i ,i = 1, ... , n) satisfy

for each p (p

with respect to the k-symplectic basis is of the form 3.1. •

3.3.2
The Lie algebra sp(k, n; E)
We assume in this subsection that K = R or C. For this case the group
Sp(k, n; E) is a Lie group. The Lie algebra of this group, which is denoted by
.sp(k, nj E) and identified below with the tangent space of this group in the
identity mapping of E , is formed of the endomorphisms u of E according
to:
u(F) ~ F,
(}P(u(x),y) + oP(x, u(y»
= 0,
for all x, y E E and
p =1, ... ,k.
Let .sp(k, n; lK) be the Lie algebra of Sp(k, n; K), which is the Lie algebra
of all matrices of endomorphisms, with respect to the k-symplectic basis of
E, belonging to the Lie algebra .sp(k, n;E).
Proposition 3.5 The Lie algebm .sp(k, n; K) is constituted of the matrices
of type:
where A, Sl,···, Sk are n X n matrices with coefficients in lK, with tSp -
Sp, for every
p ( p = 1,... , k) .
Proof. Let u E .sp(k, n; E), p = 1, ... , k and j = 1, ... , n. Write
u(epj) = 2:kq=l(2:h=l c ;~eqh) + 2:h=l chpjeh'
u(ej) = 2:kq=l(2:h=l c/heqh) + 2:h=l dJeh.
The relationship oP(u(x),y) + oP(x,u(y» '= 0, for all

Corollary 3.3 The k-symplectic group and its Lie algebra leave invariant
the characteristic subspaces of the k-symplectic exterior system.
In the hypothesis and notations of previous subsection we consider the
space GP = FP EI1 E / F equipped with its a symplectic structure defined by
71(x +y,x' + y') = (JP(x, y') - (JP(x', y)
for all x +y,x' + y' E GP, where p = 1, .. . ,k.
Corollary 3.4 For every f E Sp(k, nj E) the association
f p : x +y f---+ f(x) + fey)
defines an element of the symplectic group Sp(O P, G P) of the symplectic
vector space «»,(1).
Corollary 3.5 If ((J1, ... , (Jk j F)
is a k-symplectic exterior system on a
vector space of dimension n(k + 1), then the forms (Jl,.. . , (Jk are of rank
2n.

k-symplectic geometry
3.4.1
k-symplectic orthogonality
Let E be an n(k +1)-dimensional vector space over a commutative field lK
with characteristic not equal to 2, equipped with a k-symplectic structure
((Jl,... , (Jk j F).
Definition 3.6
1. Let z and y be two vectors of E.
We say that x is
orthogonal to y, with respect to the system {(J1,
, (Jk}, or, symboli-
cally, x ..L y, if (JP(x, y) = 0 for all
p (p = 1,
, k).
2. Let Land M be two vector subspaces of E. We say that L is orthog-
onal to M with respect to the system {(Jl,"', (Jk} , or, symbolically,
L ..L M , if z .L y for all x ELand y E M.
The k-symplectic orthogonal of a non-empty set A of E is the vector
subspace of E defined by:
A .L = {XEE I (JP(x,y) =0 , 'v'yEA, 'v'p(p =
1,... , k)}.

48
CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Definition 3.7 We say that E is an orthogonal sum of the subspace Land
M of E if we have:
E=LtBM, L=M1...
Notice that we have:
1. The non-degeneracy of the system {01, •.• ,Ok} is equivalent to E1.. -
{O}.
2. The 2-symplectic orthogonal X 1.. of an element X of E is not ne-
cessarily an hyperplane. Considering, for instance, the real space ~3
equipped with its canonical 2-symplectic structure defined by:
and F = kerw3, where {w1,w2,w3} is the dual basis of the canonical
basis {eI,e2,e3} of E . The 2-symplectic orthogonal er of el is the
hyperplane spanned by the system [ej , e2}, while the 2-symplectic
orthogonal e§- of e3 is the line IRe3.
Proposition 3.6 For all non-empty subsets A and B of E , we have:
1. A
~ B => B1.. ~ A1..,
2. A

Definition 3.8 A subspace L of E will be called totally isotropic if L ~
L1...
A subspace L of E is a totally isotropic subspace if and only if, the following
property is satisfied:
OP(x,y) = 0
for all x ,y ELand
p =
1, ... , k. Every totally isotropic subspace is
contained in a maximal totally isotropic subspace.
Definition 3.9 A maximal totally isotropic subspace will be called a La-
grangian subspace of E.

3.4. K-SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRY
49
Proposition 3.7 Every element ofthe k-symplectic group Sp(k, n; E) tmns-
forms the totally isotropic subspaces {resp. Lagmngian subspaces) of E in
totally isotropic subspaces (resp. Lagmngian subspaces) .
Proof. Let f E Sp(k, n; E) and let L be a totally isotropic subspace of
E. For any x,y E E we have:
(}P(J(x),f(y)) = (}P(x,y) = 0
for each
p =1, .. . ,k. The subspace f(L) is totally isotropic.
Let L be a Lagrangian subspace of E. Suppose f (L) is strictly contained
in f(L)1., then there exists a' = f(a) belonging to f(L)1. - f(L) such
thatforeachxEf(L) we have (}P(a, x) =0. Set A = LEBJ[{a. We have
(}P(u, v) = 0 for all u, v E A, and A ~ A1.. Consequently L is not maximal,
which contradicts the hypothesis; then f(L) is a Lagrangian subspace.•
Proposition 3.8 Let L be a Lagmngian subspace of E, and Mo a totally
isotropic subspace of E supplementary to L. Then there exists a Lagmngian
subspace M of E supplementary to L and containing Mo.
Proof.
Let M be a maximal element of the set of totally isotropic sub-
spaces of E transverse to L and containing Mo. Then M is a Lagrangian
subspace of E.•
Proposition 3.9 For every vector subspace L of E the following proper-
ties are equivalent :
1. L is a Lagmngian subspace of E,
2. L = L1. .
Proof. If L is strictly contained in L1. there exists an element a of E - L
such that
(}P(a, y) = 0
for all y ELand p = 1, . .. ,k. Let L' = LEB:oca. Obviously, we have L C L'.
Let z = x + Aa E L', with x ELand A E J[{. We have
(}P(z,z')
= (}P(x+Aa,x' +A'a)
= (}P(x,x') + A(}P(x,a) + A'(}P(a,x')
= 0,
for all z' = x'+A'a belonging to L' (x' ELand A' E J[{) and p = 1, ... , k,
then z E u-. Thus L' c 1'1., which contradicts the property that L is a
maximal totally isotropic subspace of E . This proves that 1 ~ 2.
The implication 2 ~ 1 is immediate.•

CHAPTER 3. K-SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Proposition 3.10 Let L be a vector subspace of E .
1. If L is a totally isotropic subspace, then dimL ::; nk.
2. If L is Lagmngian then, n ::; dim L ::; nk.
Proof. Let L be a totally isotropic subspace of E, {iI, .. . , fh} be a basis
of L which we extend to a basis of E denoted by {iI ,... , fh, UI ,... , Um-h},
and let {fi, ..., fh, ui ,... ,u:n-h} be its dual basis. The two forms ()P
can be written as:
where api j , lJPij E lK. Consider the following matrix:

alh I
all m-h
al2 m-h
alh m-h
A -
akl I
ak2 I
akh I
akl m-h
ak2 m-h
akh m-h
and show that it is of rank h . For all X = (Xl,· ··, Xh) E ][h the rela-
tionship A'x = 0 implies that the vector XliI + ... + xhfh belongs to
A(()l) n ... n A(()k); the non-degeneracy of the system {()l, . . . , ()k} implies
that X = 0, thus the matrix A is of rank h. It follows that we have,
in particular, h ::; k(m - h), consequently h ::; nk this proves the first
assertion.
Suppose now that L is a Lagrangian subspace of E, and consider the
matrix

B -
akl I

3.4. K -SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRY
51
We show that B is of rank m - h. For each Y = (Yl,' .. ,Ym-h) E OCm - h ,
the relationship B ty = 0 implies that the vector Y = ~i=lh YjUj satisfies
m-h
()P(y,Ji) = - L a pi jYj = 0
j=l
for any p (p = 1, . .. , k) and i (i = 1, ... , h); then
OP(y,g) = 0
for all
pcp = 1, ... , k) and gEL. This proves that the vector Y is in the
k-symplectic orthogonal L1.. of L; but L is a Lagrangian subspace E and
the vector Y belonging to L, thus y = O. We have proved the following
implication
Bty = 0 => Y = 0 ,
consequently the matrix B is of rank m - h; then m - h:S kh and n :s h
which proves the second assertion.•
Corollary 3.6 The vector subspaces F and G = V ect(el, . .. ,en) are ma-
ximal solutions of the system
We observe that we have :
1. For k = 1 we find the classic case in which all Lagrangian subspaces
are n-dimensional.
2. The vector subspaces F
and G = Vect(eI, ... ,en) are Lagrangian
subspaces of E
of dimensions nk and n respectively.
There also
exists Lagrangian subspaces whose the dimensions are strictly con-
tained between nand nk. Consider, for example, in the case where
n = k = 2, the vector subspace L of E spanned by en + ei ,e12 and
e22; L is a Lagrangian subspace of E of dimension 3.

52
CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
3.4.2
Adjoint endomorphisms
Let E be a vector space of dimension n(k + 1) and let ((}l, ... ,(}k ; F) be
a k-symplectic exterior system on E . Let 1] be the mapping of E into the
OC-vector space hom(E,OCk) defined by:
1](x)(y) = ((}l(x,y), .. . ,(}k(x,y))
for all x,y E E . The non-degeneracy of the system {(}l,.. . ,(}k} implies
that the mapping 1] is injective.
For each endomorphism u of E, we can associate a linear mapping from
hom(E,OCk) into itself, denoted by tu and called transpose of u, defined
by:
for every eE hom(E,OCk) .
Proposition 3.11 For all u,v E End(E) and AE OC, we have:
2. t(u 0 v) = tv 0 tu;
3. tidE is the identity mapping of hom(E,OCk);
4. if u E GL(E) then tu E GL(hom(E,OCk)) and (tu)-l = t(u- 1) .
Let u be an endomorphism of E , satisfying the hypothesis:
(3.2)
For each tEE there exists an unique -r E E , such that
(tu o1])(t) = 1](t').
It is clear that the association t 1----+ -r defines a mapping from E into itself,
denoted by u* , such that for all t and x belonging to E we have:
((}l(t,u(x)), . . . ,(}k(t,u(x))) = ((}l(u*(t) ,x) ,... ,(}k(u*(t), x)).
Consequently, we deduce that for all u, v E End(E) satisfying the relation-
ship 3.2 and A E OC , we have the following properties :
1. (}P(t,u(x)) = (}P(u*(t),x)
forall p(p=l, . . . ,k) and t,xEE;

3.4. K -SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRY
2. the mapping u* is linear;
3. (u + v)* = u* + v*,
(Au)* = AU*;
53
4. (uov)*=v*ou*,
u**=u,
(idE )* = ide:
5. if u E GL(E) then u* E GL(E) and we have (u*)-l = (u-1)*.
Conversely, let u be an element of End(E) in such way that there exists
an endomorphism u* of E satisfying:
()P(t,u(x)) = ()P(u*(t),x)
for all p (p = 1,... , k) and t, x E E; then we have tu(l7(t)).Furthermore:
Proposition 3.12 Let u be an endomorphism of E. The following proper-
ties are equivalent :
1. There exists an endomorphism u* of E such that:
()P(t,u(x)) = (}P(u*(t) ,x) ,
forall p(p=I, .. . ,k) and t,xEE,
2. Im tu 0 17
~ Im 17.
Definition 3.10 If an endomorphism u of E satisfies one ofthe equivalent
conditions of the previous proposition, the endomorphism u* defined above
is called an adjoint endomorphism of u.
Remark 4 For k = 1 the mapping
17 is an isomorphism of vector spaces
from E into E*, and the relation
Im tu o l7 ~ Iml7 = E*
is satisfied for any endomorphism u of E ;hence, for each endomorphism of
E , there is, in this case associated, an adjoint endomorphism. This situation
is not automatic when k 2: 2 , because Im 17
is of dimension n(k + 1); it is
then strictly contained in hom(E,][{k), which is kn(k + I)-dimensional .
Proposition 3.13 We assume k 2: 2. For every endomorphism u of E
the following properties are equivalent:

54
CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS

2. u(FP)

3.5
k-symplectic transvections
The study of symmetries of a given structure (it is the mappings that pre-
serve this structure) permits a fine study of the underlying geometry. There
are detailed studies on generators of the linear and symplectic groups in the
monographs by Artin [1] and Dieudonne [17], making obvious the role played
by dilations and transvections. These transformations generate the linear
group if the field IK is different from IF2 (the field having two elements). If E
is a vector space over lF2, then the linear group GLK(E) coincides with the
special linear group SLK(E). As for the symplectic group Sp(O, E) relative
to a given symplectic structure 0, it is generated by the set of its symplectic
transvections.
In accordance with the classic study corresponding to the symplectic case,
we study in this section the k-symplectic transvections, that is transvec-
tions preserving a k-symplectic exterior system (01, ••• , Ok; F) on a IK-vector
space E, in order to see their role in the study of generators of Sp(k, nj E) .

58
CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
In contrast to the classic case of a symplectic structure, the k-symplectic
transvections do not generate the group Sp(k, nj E)j they generate a normal
subgroup of Sp(k, ni E) denoted Tp(k, nj E) . For k = 1 the I-symplectic
group Sp(I, nj E) does not coincide with Sp(n, E)j in fact, Sp(I, n, E) is the
subgroup of Sp(n, E) formed by elements which leave invariant the sym-
plectic structure e (of E) and which also leave a Lagrangian subspace L
invariant. The transvections of Sp(I, n, E) are therefore the transvections
of Sp(n, E) which leave this Lagrangian subspace invariant. It is surprising
to see that the subgroup Tp(I, n, E) spanned by these transvections appears
naturally within the framework of the geometrical quantification of Kostant
- Souriau and equally, in Kirillov's approach to the harmonic analysis in
nilpotent Lie groups.
3.5.1
Dilations and transvections
Let E be a vector space over a commutative field lK, let H be a vector
hyperplane of E, and let u be an endomorphism of E fixing every element
of H. If x is a vector of E not belonging to H we can write
u(x) = ,x+a,
where a E Hi the scalar I is independent of the chosen vector x ~ H.
IfI =11 then I is a characteristic value of u and E(I iu) is a line S, which
supplements E(Iju) = H, where E(,iU) denotes the set of elements z E E
such that u(z) = IZ. The only vector lines D such that u(D) C D are the
lines contained in H and the line S. We say that u is a dilation of ratio I,
with line S, and with fixed hyperplane H. A subspace V satisfies u(V) C V
if and only if either V C H or S C v:
Suppose I = 1. Let <p(x) = 0 be an equation of H (<p belongs to the dual
E* of the space E), then there exists an unique vector t E H such that
u(x) = x + <p(x)t
for all x E E. In this case wesay that u (which is a bijection) is a transvection
with fixed hyperplane H.
When u =I idE the line T = lKt is independent of the particular equation
taken for H, and we say that u is a transvection with line T and hyperplane
H. The scalar 1 is the only characteristic value of u (if H =I {O}) and
E(I, u) = H, if u =I idE.
If H =I {O} and u =I idE the only vector lines D such that u(D) = Dare
the lines in H; a necessary and sufficient condition for a subspace V to be
mapped into itself is then that either V C H or T C V.

3.5. K -SYMPLECTIC TRANSVECTIONS
Proposition 3.14 Let v be an automorphism of E. We have:
59
1. If u is a dilation with ratio I with line S and fixed hyperplane H then
vuv-1 is a dilation with ratio I
with line v(S) and fixed hyperplane
v(H)j
2. If u is a transvection with line T and hyperplane H, then vuv-1 is a
transvection with line v(T) and hyperplane v(H).
Let I'(E', H) be the set of automorphisms of E leaving the hyperplane
H pointwise fixed:
r(E,H) = {u E GL(E) Iu(h) = h, Vh E H} ,
and let 8(E, H) be a set of transvections with hyperplane H, then we have
Proposition 3.15 8(E,H) is a normal abelian subgroup ofr(E,H) which
isomorphic to additive group of H. In particular the inverse of the transvec-
tion
x t---+ x + cp(x )t,
where cp(x) = 0 is an equation of the hyperplane and t E H, is the transvec-
tion
X t---+ X - cp(x)t.
In fact, consider the mapping f from r(E, H) onto Jl{* defined by
f(u) = I
where u(x) = IX + a. It is clear that f is a surjective homomorphism from
f(E,H) onto the multiplicative group Jl{*, and we have
8(E, H) = ker fj
consequently we have
r(E,H) ~ Jl{*
8(E, H)
.
Proposition 3.16 Let 8'(E,T) be the set of all transvections with a given
line T and with variable hyperplane H containing T. Then 8'(E,T) is an
abelian group.
Proposition 3.17 Let u, u' be respectively two non-identity dilations or
transvections with hyperplanes H, H' , of lines D, D' respectively. We have:

60
CHAPTER 3. K-SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
1. A necessary and sufficient condition for u to commute with u' is that
either H' = H or D c H' .and D' C H. This condition is also sufficient
if u, u' are both transvections.
2. If u, u' are both dilations, the necessary and sufficient condition for
commutativity is that either H = H' and D = D' or D C H' and
D'CH.
3. A dilation u never commutes with a transvection u' unless one or both
is the identity map.
Proposition 3.18 Let r(x) = x +ep(x)t be a transvection with hyperplane
H and line OCt. The following properties are equivalent:
2. t:;i 0 and ep:;i 0 .
This is an immediate consequence of the characterization of transvections.
3.5.2
k-symplectic transvections
Let E be an n(k +1)-dimensional vector space over a commutative field OC
equipped with a k-syrnplectic exterior system «()1, ... ,()k; F) .
Definition 3.11 A transvection r of E with fixed hyperplane H and line
OCt is Called k-syrnplectic ifit belongs to the k-syrnplectic group Sp(k, n; E).
It follows that a transvection r(x) = x+ep(x)t with fixed hyperplane H
and line OCt is k-syrnplectic if and only if, the following property is satisfied
ep(x)()P(y, t) = ep(y)OP(x, t)
for all x,y E E and p(p = 1, .. . ,k).
(3.4)
Proposition 3.19 If r(x) = x+ep(x)t is a k-syrnplectic transvection with
fixed hyperplane H and line lKt such that r :;i idE, then H = tl..
Proof. The relation 3.4 implies that H ~ tl. , whilst the inclusion tl. ~ H
results from the non-degeneracy of the system {()1, ... , ()k} and from the
relationship 3.4.•

3.5. K -SYMPLECTIC TRANSVECTIONS
61
Proposition 3.20 Let T(X) = x + ep(x)t be a k-symplectic tmnsvection
with fixed hyperplane H and line OCt, such that T =1= idE. Then for each p
(p= 1, . .. , k), the following properties are equivalent:
1. There exists x E E - H such that tJP(t, x) =1= 0;
2. For every x E E - H, (JP(t, x) =1= o.
This proposition is an immediate consequence of 3.4.
For each element tEE -
{O} we associate the set I(t) of elements
p E {I, ... , k} such that i(t)tJP
=1= O. The non-degeneracy of the system
{(Jl, ... ,(Jk} implies that let) is non empty.
Let T(X) = x + ep(x)t
be
a k-symplectic transvection with fixed hyperplane H and line OCt; the
relationship 3.4 and the preceding proposition show that we have
ep(x)
tJP(t,x)
ep(y) = (JP(t,y)
for all x, y
E E - Hand
P E l(t). Then there exists non zero scalars
pP (p E let)) such that
ep(x) = pPtJP(x, t)
for all x E E - H and
P E let). This equation is independent of p in
let) , thus we have
for all p, q E let).
The following proposition allowsus to give a characterization of k-symplectic
transvections.
Proposition 3.21 Let t be a vector of E. A necessary and sufficient condi-
tion for t to be a direction of a k-symplectic tmnsvection T with T =1= idE
is that, t takes the form
(3.5)
where ti (resp. ),P) are non-zero scalars.
Proof. For k = 1 it sufficesto show that t E F. In fact, we have tJ.. = H =
ker ep, and F is T-invariant. Thus t E F.

62
CHAPTER 3. K -SYMPLECTIC EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Suppose that k ~ 2. Let r(x) = x+ep(x)t be a k-symplectic transvec-
tion with hyperplane H and line lKt, with r t= idE. The previous relation-
ships prove that there exists a subset I(t) of {I, ... ,k} such that the linear
forms i(t)(JP,
p E I(t), are proportional. We can assume that 1 E I(t).
Write
t~t (t,~~) + t,t'~
If I(t) is reduced to {I}, then i(t)OP = 0 for every
p
~ 2, and t
=
L:7=1 tlieli . This proves that t can be written in the form 3.5. Suppose
now that I(t) is not reduced to {I}.
For every q E I(t) there exists a
non-zero scalar >..q such that i(t)Oq = >..qi(t)Ol; thus
for every i E {I, . . . ,n}, and t is written in the expected form.
Conversely, let t be an element of E - {O} of the form 3.5. It is clear
that I(t) is the set of q E {I, .. . , k} such that >..q t= 0 and
nL tiwi = O.
i=l
is an equation of the hyperplane H , and we have
(3.6)
for every
q E I(t) , then
The relationship 3.6 implies that there exist non zero elements & (q E I(t))
of lK, and a linear form ep of which kernel is H , such that
for every
q E I(t). The endomorphism r of E given by:
r(x) = x + ep(x)t,
for every x E E , is a k-symplectic transvection of E.•

3.5.3
The group Tp( k, n; E)
We denote by Tp(k,nj E) the subgroup of 8p(k, nj E) spanned by the
k-symplectic transvections of E. Ai; in preceding sections, we will denote
by Tp(k,nj OC) the group of matrices of elements of Tp(k,n;E) relative to
the k-symplectic basis.
Proposition 3.22 The group Tp(k,n; OC) is the set of the matrices:

subgroup of 8p(k, nj OC).
Proof. It follows from the previous corollary that for every k-symplectic
transvection we have:
T(X) = x
for each x E F. Thus every element of Tp(k, n jOC) is of the form 3.7.
Conversely, let M

phisms Trj and rJ: of E defined by:

Chapter 4
PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
4.1
Differential exterior systems
A good introduction into this field is given in [13]. We present here only
the base of the theory of exterior systems and Pfaffian systems. For a deep
study of exterior systems we refer the reader to this reference [13].
4.1.1
Differential p-forms
Let jRn be the real space of dimension n equipped with a coordinates system
(XI, ... , xn) , let TRn be the tangent bundle of lRn, and let T*jRn be its
cotangent bundle. We denote by APT*jRn the vector bundle over jRn whose
fibres are APT;jRn, x E jRn (the space of skew symmetric p-forms of the real
space TxjRn) .
Definition 4.1 An exterior differential form of degree p (or simply a dif-
ferential p-form) on jRn is a smooth section of the vector bundle
A Pfaffian form is an exterior differential form of degree 1.
With respect to the coordinate system (Xl, · · ' ,xn ) the derivatives
(8/8xI (x) ,, ·· ,8/8xn(x))
is a basis of TxjRn ,
(dXI (x), .. ., dXn (X ) )

CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
is a basis of T;lRn and any exterior differential p-form a has the form:
where ail ...ip
are smooth functions with respect to the coordinates system
(x}, ... ,xn ) , and a (x) is an exterior p-form of the tangent space TxjRn.
By definition we have:
1. a differential O-form is a scalar function on lRn ;
2. each differential p-form a is zero (a = 0) for p > n;
3. any differential n-form a can be written as
a = f(X)dxl/\ ... /\ dxn,
where f is a smooth function with respect to the coordinates system
(x},··· ,xn ) .
4.1.2
Exterior algebra
The set of exterior differential p-forms on jRn is a real vector space. The
sum and the multiplication by a scalar are defined as follows:let a and {3 be
two differential p-forms given by:
{3 = L{3ilo..ipdxil /\ . .. /\ dXip,
then a + {3 is the p-form
and for every ,X E lR the p-form 'xa is given by
For every smooth function f on jRn the product of f by the p-form a is
defined by
fa = Lfailoooipdxil /\ .. . /\ dXip'
Therefore, the set of all exterior differential p-forms is a module over the
ring of smooth functions on jRn.

4.1. DIFFERENTIAL EXTERIOR SYSTEMS
Let 0: E AP(lRn ) and 13 E Aq(lRn ) . Define 0:/\ 13 E AP+q(lRn ) by
(0: /\ 13)(x) = o:(x) /\ f3(x)
for every x E lRn . Note that we have:
f(o: /\ 13) = [a /\ 13 = 0: /\ ff3·
69
The space of exterior differential forms equipped with the exterior product
/\ is an associative algebra.
4.1.3
Pull back of an exterior form by a mapping
Let f : lRn ---+ lRm be a smooth mapping and let 0: be an exterior differential
p-form on lRm . The pull back of 0: by f is the differential p-form 1"'0: defined
on lRn by

for all exterior differential p-forms 0: and 13 on lRm .
4.1.4
Exterior derivatives of p-forms
First, we recall the definition of the exterior derivative of O-form. Let f :
lRn ---+ lR be a smooth function. In the coordinates system (Xl,... , X n ) , the
exterior derivative df is given by:
8f
df(x) = L 8Xi (X)dXi o
We generalize this to general p-forms as follows: the exterior derivative of a
p-form

4.1.5
Exterior differential systems
Definition 4.2 A differential exterior system on JRn is a system of equa-
tions
(h =O, · · ·,Os =0,
where 01, ... , Os are exterior differential forms.
Example 8 Considering a first order partial differential equations
Taking Pi = 8y/ 8Xi, we obtain the following exterior differential system:
{
F(Xl,"',Xn,Y,Pl,"',Pn) =0,
dy - L.Pidxi = °
in the real space JR2n+l parametrized by (Xl,'" ,Xn,Y,Pl,'" ,Pn).
Definition 4.3 Let (S) be an exterior differential system on JRn.
An in-
tegral manifold of (S) is a submanifold W of JRn such that for every X E
W the tangent space TxW is a solution of the exterior system defined by
{Ol(X) = 0,,, , ,Os(x) = O}.
If f : JRn ~ JRn is a mapping such that W corresponds to f(x) = 0, then
W is an integral manifold of (8) if and only ifre. = °for each i = 1" ", s.
Let (8) = (01 = 0"", Os = 0) be an exterior differential system on JRn.
Definition 4.4 The exterior differential system F(8) defined by the equa-
tions 01 = 0" ", Os = 0, dOl = 0" ", d(}s =°is called the closure of (8).
Proposition 4.1 An exterior differential system (8) and its closure F(8)
have the same integral manifolds.

4.2. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
71
Proof. In fact , let W be the submanifold of jRn defined by f(x) = O. Then
we have f*Oi = 0 for each i = 1, ..., s.
Since d(f*Oi) = f*dOi, therefore
f*dOi = 0, which proves that W is an integral manifold of (F(B)).•
Definition 4.5 The exterior differential system (B) is closed if it is alge-
braically equivalent to (F(B)), that is, ifit generates the same ideal ofA(lRn )
(algebra of exterior differential forms on lRn ) .
4.2
Pfaffian systems
4.2.1
Definition
Definition 4.6 A Pfaffian system is an exterior differential system
(al = 0,... ,as = 0) ,
where ai are Pfaffian forms, that is, exterior differential forms of degree 1.
An integral manifold of such a system is a submanifold W such that the
tangent space TxW at each point x E W is contained in the kernel of the
linear system (al(x) = 0"", as(x) = 0).
4.2.2
Algebraically equivalent Pfaflian systems
Let (al = 0" . . ,as = 0) and (f1l = 0, ... ,f1t = 0) be two Pfaffian systems
on jRn we say that they are algebraically equivalent if there exists smooth
functions gf and h}, such that
and
aj = Lh}f1i'
For example, if the Pfaffian forms ai are independent (that is, the linear
forms ai(x) are independent at each point x E lRn ) and the matrix (gf(x))
is invertible at each point x, then the systems (al = 0"" ,as = 0) and
(f1l = 0"" ,f1s= 0) are algebraically equivalent, where f1i = Egfaj.
Two algebraically equivalent Pfaffian systems are the same integral mani-
folds. This followsfrom the previous definition and the study of algebraically
equivalent systems.

72
CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
The main purpose of the two following chapters is to consider the prob-
lem of the classification of Pfaffian systems, which brings upback to seeing
how to represent locally all Pfaffian system on lRn • This necessitates a study
of the invariants of Pfaffian systems, that is, those objects depending only
on the class of algebraically independent systems.
Remark 5
Let (8) = (a1 = 0" ", ar = 0) be a Pfaffian system. To sim-
plify, one will write (8) = (a1, .. · ,ar ) [or cu, = O, · ··,ar = O. Similarly,
if f3 = 2:Qiai , then f3 = 0 is an equation of the system, and we will write
f3 E (8).
4.3
Class of Pfaffian systems
4.3.1
Rank of Pfaffian systems
Let (8) be a Pfaffian system on lRn . The rank of (8) at a point x is the rank
of the linear system (a1 (x) , a2 (x) , . .. ,a r (x) ). We denote by rank, (8) the
rank of (8). Generally, the mapping x 1--+ rank; (8) is not constant; it is
upper semi-continuous only. In this work we consider only those Pfaffian
systems of constant rank.
This hypothesis avoids the study of the singularity and to make a study
of Pfaffian systems in a neighborhood of a generic point, where the rank is
maximum. The aim is a local study of Pfaffian systems, and this convention
is not too restrictive.
4.3.2
Class of Pfaffian systems
Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of rank r on lRn represented by the Pfaffian
forms (al, ...,ar ) . The characteristic space of (8) at a point x E lRn is the
space Cx (8) defined by:
Recall that XJa (noted also i(X)a) is the interior product of the exterior
form a with respect to the vector X.
Definition 4.7 The class of (8) at a point x (denoted by classx(8)) is the
codimension of the vector space Cx (8).

4.3. CLASS OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
73
This definition equally admits a dual presentation. One considers the
closure (F(8)) of the Pfaffian system (8), that is, the following exterior
differential system:
(F(8)) = (ai = 0, da; = 0, i = 1,...,r).
The associated Pfaffian system which corresponds at each point to the linear
system associated to Fx(8) is defined by
A; (F(8)) = {ai (x) = 0, Xj (X)Jdai (x) = 0, i = 1, ...,r, j = 1, ...,n}
where (Xl, ...,Xn ) is a local basis of vector fields on Rn .
The rank of
A; (F(8)) corresponds to the class of (8) at the point x.
Definition 4.8 A characteristic vector field 0/(8) is a vector field contained
in the distribution C (8).
4.3.3
Interpretation of the class
Let (8) = (al = 0, ..., ar = 0) be a Pfaffian system of constant rank r on
jRn. The kernel of (8) at a point x E jRn is given by
It determines a distribution on jRn of codimension r. We have defined the
notion of integrable system. The original problem of Pfaffian systems was
concerned with research on integral manifolds. The class of a Pfaffian sys-
tem is an invariant measuring the non-integrability of this system. It is an
invariant because this number is independent of the choice of representatives
aI, ...,a r of (8). Two systems algebraically equivalent have the same class
at each point. Of course, the class of (8) is a function whose value depends
on the point x where it is evaluated. It is upper semi-continuous superiorly.
Therefore we can study the Pfaffian system on a neighborhood of a point
where the class is a maximum. This brings us to making the next hypothesis:
all Pfaffian systems considered in this work are assumed to be of constant
class.

74
CHAPTER 4: PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
4.4
Integrability of Pfaffian systems
4.4.1
Completely integrable Pfaffian systems
Definition 4.9 A Pfaffian system (8) of rank r on jRn is called completely
integrable if for each p E jRn there exists a coordinate system (YI, ...,Yn) de-
fined on an open neighborhood ofp, called a distinguished coordinate system,
such that (8) is defined by the Pfaffian system
(dYI = 0, ...,dYr = 0).
If (8) is completely integrable the mapping
X I---t (YI (x) ,...,Yr (x))
is of constant rank r, For every point (aI, . . . ,an) E jRn this mapping defines
an integral manifold passing through the point whose equations are Yi (x) =
ai. The functions Yi are called first integrals of the system.
Proposition 4.2 Each completely integrable Pfaffian system (8) is of con-
stant class equal to its rank.
Proof. In fact,
C; (8) = {Xx E TxjRn I Qi (x) (Xx) = 0 and XxJdQi (x) = 0 mod (8)} .
The notation XxJdQi (x) = 0 mod (8) means that we have
We can choose as representative for (8) the Pfaffian forms Qi = dYi. We
then deduce that we have do; = 0, and
Cx (8) = {Xx E TxjRn I Qi (x) (Xx) = O} = ker; (8).
Thus we have dim C, (8) = n - r, and codim Cx(8) = rankx(8) = r.•
4.4.2
Frobenius'theorem
Theorem 4.1 Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of rank r on jRn. Then (8)
is completely integrable, if and only if, the class of (8) is constant and it
coincides with the rank of this system (rankx(8) = c1assx(8)).

4.4. INTEGRABILITY OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
75
Proof. We prove this theorem by induction on the dimension of ker (S).
1. If (S) is of rank n - 1, that is, dimker (S) = 1, then for every p E Rn
we can find a coordinates system (Yl, ...,Yn) defined on an open set U
of Rn containing the point p such that {~1}
is a basis of ker (S).
Consequently the system (8) is spanned by (dY2, ..., dYn), then it is
completely integrable. Note here that the hypothesis relating to the
class is automatically verified:if rank (S) = n - 1, then class (S) =
rank (S) = n - 1.
2. Assume that all Pfaffian system of a given rank r + 1 of which class
coincides with the rank is completely integrable, and consider a system
(S) of rank r. Let (ou ... ,or) be a basis of (8). With respect to the
coordinates system (Xi) defined on an open subset U centered at the
origin 0 the Pfaffian forms Oi are written:
{
01 = alldx1 ~
+alndxn
Or = arldxl +
+arndxn.
Since the rank of (8) is equal to r the matrix (aij) is of rank r . We can
assume that the matrix M = (aij)l<i '<r is invertible at each point of
_ ,J_
U. The Pfaffian forms given by
satisfy
!3r = dxr+ E brjdxj
j>r
and also span (8). We deduce that the forms
are linearly independent on U. Since class (8) = r, the class of the
Pfaffian system (8) = (!3ll ...,!3r,dxr+1 ) is equal to its rank
class (8) = rank (8) = r + 1.

CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
By hypothesis there exists a coordinates system (Y1,...,Yn) such that
(8) is spanned by (dY1 , ...,dYr+1). Thus
r+1
dXr+1 =L cjdYj·
j=l
We can assume that Cr+1 =1= o. Also the system (8) is spanned by the
forms (dyl, ...,dYr,dXr+1) thus the system (8) is generated by a system
of the following form:
We deduce that
{
~'~da~ Adx.+"
d/3r= dar A dXr+1.
By hypothesis the ~lass of the system (~b ..., ~r) is equal to r, Thus
the forms /3i and d/3i are expressed only by r differentials, and are in
the ideal spanned by these r differentials. Therefore we have

4.4. INTEGRABILITY OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS

4.4.3
Characterization of completely integrable system
Theorem 4.2 A Pfaffian system (S) is completely integrable if and only if
for any representative (al, ...,a r ) we have
da, /\ al /\ ... /\ a r = 0,
for all i = 1,..., r, that is, if (S) is closed.
Proof. Assume that (S) is completely integrable. Then
class (S) = rank (S) = r.
Thus rank (A*(F(S))) = r at each point. By definition, A*(F(S)) contains
(8), thus each set of generators (ab ...,ar ) of (8) generates the closure of
(8). The differentials da, belong to the ideal spanned by (aI, ...,ar ) , this
means that we have
for every i = 1, ..., r .
Conversely, if this last relationship is satisfied for each set of generators
of (8) , the class of (8) is equal to its rank and (8) is completely integrable.•
Such a theorem admits a dual version.
Theorem 4.3 Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of rank r.
Then (8) is com-
pletely integrable if and only ij,there exists a basis (Xl, ...,Xn- r ) ofthe kernel
ker (8) satisfying
n-r
[Xi, Xi] =L CtXk'
k=l
Proof. Let (al, ..., ar) be generators of (8) which we extend to a system (al, ..., ar,
13rH' ...,13n) of n forms linearly independent at each point. Since (8) is com-
pletely integrable we have
da; = L C}kai /\ ak +L Cjkaj /\ 13k'
If (Y1, ...,1';., XrH, ..., X n ) is the dual basis, the vector fields X rH, ..., X n
form a basis of the kernel of (8). The duality relations between the brackets
and exterior differentials imply that we have
n
[Xi, Xi] = L
CtXk'
k=r+l
for all i,j = r + 1, ...,n. This proves the theorem.•

CHAPTER 4.
PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
4.5
The Darboux theorem
We have seen above that all completely integrable Pfaffian systems of rank
r on jRn (that is, of class r) are locally isomorphic. It is similarly so for all
systems of rank 1 and maximal class (or, more generally, constant class).
4.5.1
Class of Pfaffian systems of rank 1.
Considering a Pfaffian system (8) of rank 1 defined by the Pfaffian equation
a = O.
Proposition 4.3 The class of (8) = (a) at a point x is equal to 2s + 1 if
and only if
(a 1\ (daY)x # 0
and
(a 1\ (day+lt = O.
(4.1)
Proof.
Assume that the rank at x of the 2-form da is 2r. Then we have
(dar # 0 and (da)T+l = O.
Two cases are possible:
1. a 1\ (dar # 0 and a 1\ (dar+l = 0;
2. a 1\ (dar = 0 and a 1\ (dar- 1 # 0 .
In the first case we obtain dim C, (8) = n - 2r -1, and in the second case
we have dim Cx (8) = n - 2r + 1 which implies that class {a} = 2r + 1 or
2r.-1. The reverse is immediate.•
Remark 6 This proposition gives a very practical criterion determining the
class of a Pfaffian system of rank 1. Note that we have no generalization
of this nature for systems whose rank is fJreater than 2. Also we can ob-
serve here that the class represents the number of independent differentials
permitting the 2-form da and the form a to be writting.
4.5.2
The Darboux theorem
Theorem 4.4 Let (8) = {a = O} be a Pfaffian system of rank 1 and of
constant class 2s + 1 in jRn. Then there exists a local coordinate system
(Xl, •••, Xs,Yl, ...,Ys, z,Ul, •. . , Un- 2s- 1),
such that

4.5.
THE DARBOUX THEOREM
79
Proof.
First time we assume that n is odd and that (S) -
{a} is of
maximum class n, that is,
a A (daY :f: 0 with n = 28 + 1.
Lemma 9 Suppose that {a} is of maximum class.
For every integrable
distribution D contained in ker a, we have:
dimD s s.
Proof of lemma. Let Xl, ""Xk be linearly independent vector fields at
each point and verifying :
According to Frobenius' theorem the distribution defined by these vector
fields is completely integrable. It is contained in the kernel of the system.
But if s 2: k then
XIJX2J...JXkJa A(daY =
s (s - 1) ... (s - k) a A(Xdda) A(X2Jda) A... A(XkJda) Adas- k.
This expression is zero if k > s. Since a A (da)S is of maximum rank and
the vector fields Xl, ""Xk are linearly independent, the exterior form
is zero. The hypothesis k > s cannot be satisfied.
Lemma 10 Let (a) be a Pfaffian system of rank 1 and of maximum class
n = 2s + 1 and whose kernel contains an integrable distribution of (maxi-
mum) dimension s. Then there exists a coordinates system
such that:

80
CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
Proof of lemma. Let XI, ...,X, be independent vector fields generating
the integrable distribution contained in kereS). Considering a coordinate
system (UI, ...,un) on jRn such that the vector fields Xl, ...,X; verify
for all i = 1, ..., s. Since a (Xi) = 0 the Pfaffian form a can be written as:
with respect to this coordinates system.
The Pfaffian form a is non-zero thus there exists i (i = s+1,... , 2s+1)
such that ~ is a non-zero function (ai =1= 0). We can assume that as+! =1= O.
Dividing a by as+! (obviously we do not change the Pfaffian system {a =
O}), we obtain an expression for a of the form
But (a) is of class 2s + 1, hence a /\ do" =1= 0, which is equivalent to
dus+! /\ dhs+2/\ dbs+2/\ ... /\ db2s+! /\ db2s+! =1= O.
This proves that the functions Us+! ,bs+2, bs+2, ...,b2s+I, U2s+1 form a local
coordinate system such that a takes the expected form.
Finally for the demonstration of Darboux' theorem in the case where a
is of maximum class one needs the following lemma :
Lemma 11 Let (a) be a Pfaffian system of rank 1 and of maximum class
n = 2s + 1. There exists an integrable distribution of rank s contained in
ker o.
Consider a (local) basis of Pfaffian forms {a = aI, a2, ...,a2s+I} such
that
dal = a2 /\ a3 + ... + a2s /\ a2s+!
and let {XI,X2, ...,X2s+!} be its dual basis. We have X2Jdal = a3 and
locally dim (ker al n ker (3) = 2s - 1. Let Z be a vector field contained in
ker al n ker a3. This vector field can be written
The equation [Z, X2] = 0 is equivalent to the differential system :

Notice that according to the expression of 001 one has necessarily
C~=O
for (i,j) ::f (2,3), ..., (28,28+ 1) . The space of solutions of the previous dif-
ferential system is of dimension 28-1, thus we can choose 28-1 independent
fundamental solutions. But,
(P2 = 1, P4 = P5 = ... = P2s+1 = 0)
is a basis of solutions. To each of these solutions these corresponds a vec-
tor field Z = L:PiXi satisfying [X2, Z] = O. Therefore we can construct
independent vector fields (X2, Z2, Z3, ..., Z2s-1) corresponding to the chosen
fundamental solutions.
Let us remark that the distribution spanned by these vector fields is
of rank 28 - 1 and that it is contained in the kernel of al. It is similarly
so for the distribution spanned by the brackets [Zi,Zj], but this distrib-
ution is certainly not integrable. Nevertheless, there exists an integrable
sub-distribution of rank 2 which is spanned, for example, by X2 and Z2. To
understand the process of construction of the maximal integrable distribu-
tion we are going to determine a third vector field Z independent with X2
and Z2 satisfying
[X2, Z] = [Z2, Z] = 0 and al (Z) = O.
The distribution defined by
is of constant rank 28- 2 (on the open where it is defined). Let Z be a vector
field belonging to this distribution and independent of X2 and Z2. This

82
CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
vector field exists if 8 > 2. Amongst the vector fields Z, defined above there
are (28 - 4) independent vector fields, for example, Z4,..., Z2s-1, satisfying
the conditions imposed to the vector field Z . We take
where J-Li are smooth functions satisfying X2(J-Li) = O. The equation [Z2, Z] =
odefines a linear differential system of order 28- 4, and for each chosen fun-
damental solution (amongst 28-4 fundamental solutions) there corresponds
a vector field Z such that
Thus we have constructed (28 - 4) vector fields denoted _by Z4,..., Z2s-1,
and the distribution spanned by the vector fields X2, Z2, Z4 is of rank 3 is
integrable, and is contained in the kernel of a1 . It is sufficient now to iterate
this process. Assume that we have m vector fields (X2' Z2,Z4, Zs, ..., Zm)
assumed to be linearly independent at each point of the open set of the
definition, and satisfying
then we construct an (m + 1)-th vector field by taking
2s-1
Z = :E PiYi,
i=m+1
where Yi are defined by the solutions of the differential system associated
with the equation [Zm-I,Z] = O. Thus we can notice that the distribution
constructed is of rank 8, thus it is maximal.
This completes the proof of the lemma, and also the Darboux theorem
in the case where the system is of maximum class.
The case where class (a) < n can be considered the same to the previous
case, taking a local basis Yi, ...,Yn- 2s- 1 of the characteristic distribution
C (a), and a coordinates system (U1' ...,Un-2s-1,X1,...,X2s+!) such that Yi =
{)/ inu. The system {a} induces on the space (Xl, ...,X2s+I) a Pfaffian system
of class 28 + 1, and in this space the system {a} possesses the Darboux
expression. This completes the proof of the Darboux theorem. •

4.6. THE DARBOUX THEOREM WITH PARAMETERS
83
4.5.3
Consequences
All Pfaffian system of rank 1 and of the class 2s + 1 are locally isomorphic
to the system
{dxl + X2dx3 +... + X2sdx2s+l = O} .
Thus, the classification, up to local isomorphism, of Pfaffian systems of rank
1 and of class 2s + 1 is reduced to an unique model.
4.6
The Darboux theorem with parameters
This Darboux theorem 'with parameters' gives a generalization of the pre-
vious theorem in the following situation: Let ~ be a given foliation and let a
be a Pfaffian form such that on each leaf the system {a = O} is of constant
class 2s + 1. The restriction of this system to each leaf is reduced to the
Darboux form. We are going to show that there exists a transverse coordi-
nates system (UI, ...,Un- p , Xl,..., xp ) such that the foliation is defined by the
equation Ui = constant. The induced form on -each leaf can, by Darboux'
theorem be expressed as a function of the coordinates XI, ... , xn - p •
Theorem 4.5 Let ~ be a local foliation on R n of dimension p and let {a}
be a Pfaffian system of mnk 1 such that the restriction to each leaf defines a
Pfaffian system of constant class 2s+1. Then, there exists a local coordinates
system (UI, ...,Un - p , XI, ... , x p ) such that each leaf is defined by the equations
dUI = 0, ..., du n - p = 0
whose restriction of the Pfaffian form a to each leaf is written
a = dXI + X2dx3 + ... + X2sdx2s+l.
Proof.
Since ~ is a p-dimensional foliation on Rn we can find a coordinate
system (UI, ...,Un - p , VI, ...,vp ) such that the leaves of ~ are parametrized by
the equations
{
UI =
constant,
un - p: =
constant.
Locally, each leaf is a p-plane. With respect to this coordinates system the
Pfaffian form a can be written as:
p
a =L aidvi + Q,
i= l

84
CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
where Oi are smooth functions of the variables UI, •. . , Un-p, VI, . •. , vp, and
a = ~ bidui' The Pfaffian form a is zero in restriction to each leaf. Hence,
al = ~ Oidvi induces a Pfaffian form of class 28+1 on each leaf. We consider
now the differential form
as a Pfaffian form on the space defined by the coordinates (VI ,"" vp ) , the
functions Ui playing the role of parameters. For that reason this theorem
will be termed 'Darboux' theorem with parameters'). We resume now the
proof of Darboux' theorem, point by point, taking into account these new
parameters. We always assume first, that each leaf is of dimension 28 + 1
and class (ad = 28 + 1.
Lemma 12 Let D be an integral distribution ofal and tangent to each leaf.
Then rank (D) ::; s.
In fact , by restriction to each leaf we return to the situation of the
previous paragraph.
Lemma 13 If there exists an integral distribution of rank s and tangent to
each leaf, then we can find a local coordinates system
(Xl, ..., X2s+l , uI, ..., u n-2s-d
such that
Proof of lemma. Let (XI, ...,X s ) be a tangent distribution to each leaf
and satisfying al (Xi) = O. We can find coordinates
such that the leaves of the initial foliation are defined by equations Ui =
constant, the vector fields X i are given by Xi = 8/8xi (i = 1, ...,s). With
respect to this coordinates system, we have
We can assume that asH = 1, that is al = dXs+I + ...+ a2s+ldx2sH ' The
condition al /\ (dadS f= 0 shows that the functions

4.7.

are independent. This proves the lemma.
The lemma 11 of the previous section is unchanged.
Indeed, the key
to the proof is based on the existence of independent solutions of a linear
differential system. The existence of parameters does not change anything
in this proof.
Finally, we examine the case where al is not of maximum class. Then, we
foliate each leaf of the foliation Ui = constant by the characteristic foliation
of aI, which is tangent to (Ui = constant) by the construction of al.
This completes the proof of the Darboux' theorem with parameters. •
4.7
Invariants of Pfaffian systems
The classification up to local isomorphism of Pfaffian systems of constant
rank is based essentially on the study of invariants of a Pfaffian system. We
have defined above a fundamental invariant,the class. In the case of Pfaffian
systems of rank 1 this invariant entirely determines the (local) classifica-
tion by the Darboux theorem. Similarly, the Pfaffian systems of constant
rank r and constant class r are locally isomorphic; that is a consequence
of Frobenius' theorem. In the other cases the classification is less easy to
establish. Here, we are going to study some classic invariants so as to be
able to undertake classifications in low dimensions.
4.7.1
Derived system of a Pfaffian system
Let (S) be a Pfaffian system of rank r in ]Rn.
Definition 4.10 The first derived system DI (S) of (S) is the Pfaffian sys-
tem defined by
D 1 (S) = {a E (S) '" da = 0 mod (S)}.
Recall that da = 0 mod (S) means that da 1\ al 1\ ... 1\ a r = 0, where
(aI, ..., ar ) is a local basis of (S). By definition D 1 (S) is a Pfaffian sub-
system of (S) , that is, for each point x kerx(D I (S)) contains ker; (S). Thus
we write DI (S) C (S).
Let us consider the following examples:
1. Let (S) be a Pfaffian system in ]R4 defined by
{
al = dY3 + y1dY4,
a2 = dY2 +Y3dY4.

86
CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
Then {Ct2} is a basis of D 1 (S). In fact, we have
002 = dY3 /\ dY4,
Ctl /\ Ct2 = dY3 /\ dY2+Y3dY3dY4+YI dY4dY2,
dCt2 /\ UI /\ U2 = o.
2. Let (S) be the Pfaffian system in IR5 defined by
{
UI = dYI +Y3dY4,
U2 = dY2+Y3dY5·
Here we have D 1 (S) = {a}.
Remark 7
The derived system D 1 (S) is not of constant rank in the general case.
In the approach to the classification of Pfaffian systems we will assume that
D 1 (S) is of constant rank. We can always return to this case by considering a
neighborhood where D 1 (S) is of maximal rank. When D 1 (S) is not trivial
it is not completely integrable in the general case. The definition of this
system makes obvious a notion of integrability modulo (S) and not modulo
DI (S). By the definition of D1(S) this system is an invariant: two locally
isomorphic Pfaffian systems (S) and (S') have locally isomorphic derived
systems D1(S) and D1(S'). Thus the rank of D1(S) and the class of D1(S)
are numerical invariants of (S).
4.7.2
The derived systems role
Let (S) be a Pfaffian system of constant rank r and of constant class s.
Assume that the derived system D 1 (S) is of constant rank. Then we have:
Proposition 4.4 Under the previous hypothesis the characteristic space of
D 1 (S) contains the characteristic space of (S) at each point.
Proof.
In fact, considering independent Pfaffian forms
such that

would be in D(S). Thus

This proves the proposition. •
This means that the number of differentials or variables necessary for writ-
ing the derived system is less than that of the initial Pfaffian system. The
operation of taking the derived system is, in a way, an operation of eliminat-
ing variables. Notice, finally, that the characteristic system of (S) (that is
the Pfaffian system having for kernel the characteristic spaces of (8)) is, in a
way, the smallest completely integrable Pfaffian system containing (S). The
derived system plays an opposed role. One seeks inside (8) a completely in-
tegrable sub-system. It is for example, the last derived system not reduced
to {O} when (8) is totally regular. We will define the last notion in the next
paragraphs.
4.7.3
Successive derived systems
Definition 4.11 Let (8)
be a Pfaffian system of constant rank and let
D1(8) be its first derived system. If Dl (8) is of constant rank, the first
derived system D1(D1(8)) ofD1(8 ) will be called the second derived system
of (8) and denoted by D 2 (8) .
In the general case, if the kthderived system Dk (8) is of constant rank,
we define the (k + l)th derived system by:
Dk+1 (8) = D1(Dk (8)) .
If the kth derived system is well defined we have the decreasing sequence
Dk (8) C Dk-1(8) C ... c D1(8) c (8).
Proposition 4.5 If Dk (8) = Dk-1(8) then the Pfaffian system Dk-l (8)
is completely integrable and Dk+p (8) = Dk-1(8) for every p 2: O.
Proof. In fact, D 1 (S) = (8) means that
(8) = [o E 8 '" do: = 0 mod (8)} .
According to Frobenius' theorem (8) is completely integrable.•

4.7.4
Totally regular systems
Definition 4.12 We say that (S) is a totally regular system if all successive
derived systems are of constant mnk.
If (S) is totally regular we can consider the strictly decreasing sequence of
Pfaffian systems
the integer k is defined by the condition that Dk (S) = nk+p (S) #- {O} for
all p or D k (S) = {O} and Dk - 1(S) #- {O}. This integer k is called the length
of (S) . Two locally isomorphic totally regular systems are the same length.
We say that a totally regular system (S) with length k is of the first type if
Dk (S) = {O}, and of the second type if x» (S) = Dk+p (S) #- {O}, that is,
if Dk (S) is of non-zero constant rank and is completely integrable.
Remark 8 Suppose that (S) is of the second type and of length k, and take
t = rank it» (S)). On each integml manifold Fn - t of D k (S) the system (S)
induces a totally regular system of the first type.
An interesting class of totally regular systems is the class of flag systems
defined as follows:
Definition 4.13 A totally regular Pfaffian system (S) with length k is called
a flag system if the following condition is satisfied:
rank (DP (S)) = rank (DP+1 (S)) + 1,
for each p s k.
Example 14
Consider the Pfaffian system (S) in IRs defined by the following forms:
{
01 = dY1 + Y2dys,
02 = dY2 + Y3dys,
03 = dY3 +Y4dyS'

90
CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
This system is of rank 3 and of class 5, and it satisfies :
{
da, = dY2 /\ dys,
da2 = dY3 /\ dys,
da3 = dY4 /\ dys·
Hence
al /\ a2 /\ a3
=
dYl /\ dY2 /\ dY3 +Y4dYl /\ dY2 /\ dys + Y3dYl /\ dys /\ dY3
+y2dyS /\ dY2 /\ dY3.
Let j3 = al al + a2a2 + a3a3. We have
dj3 = da1 /\ al + da2/\ a2 + da3 /\ a3 + alOOl + a2da2 + a3da3
and
dj3 = 0 mod (8) ~ aldal + a2da2 + a3OO3 = 0 mod (S) .
This is equivalent to a3 =
O.
Thus D 1 (8) = {al,a2} and this derived
system is of rank 2. Similarly,
D 2 (8) = {j3 E D 1 (S) '" dj3 = 0 mod(D1 (8))} = {ad
and rank D2 (8) = 1. Finally, D3 (8) = {O}. Thus (8) is a flag system.
Proposition 4.6 Let (8) be a flag system of rank r and of length k , k ~
2. Then the successive derived systems Dl (8) ,...,D k (8) are of constant
classes, and we have
{
class (Dk (8)) =
rank (t» (8)),
class (DP (8)) = rank (DP (8)) + 2 , 0 < P < k.
Proof. Since D k (8) is zero or completely integrable, we certainly have
class (Dk (8)) = rank(Dk (8)).
Let {a1, ...,ar} be a local basis of (8) such that {al,"" ap } is a basis of
tr:» (8). Since (8) is a flag system, we have together k = r and
(
dal = 0 mod (8) ,
dar- l = 0 mod (8) ,

with 9 # 0 mod (S).
j=l
91
We deduce that class (S) = r+ rank (9) (which justifies the hypothesis
k ~ 2). Since {aI, ... , ar-l} is a local basis of D l (S), (al,"', a r-2) being
a local basis of D 2 (S), we have
(
00:1 = 0 mod (D l (S)),
OO:r-2 = 0 mod u» (S)),
OO:r-l /\ al /\ ... /\ ar-l # O.
But dar-l /\ al /\ ... /\ a r = 0 which implies
r-l
OO:r-l =L aj /\ fJj-l + a r /\ {3';.-1
j=l
with {3';.-1 # O. Hence
class(Dl(S)) =r-l+2=r+l=rank (Dl(S)) +2.
In general, let {al,"' , ar-k} be the basis of Dk (S) such that the forms
{aI, '"
, a r - k- l } define a basis of Dk+l (S). We have
da, = 0 mod (D k (S)),
OO:r-k-l = 0 mod (Dk (S)),
OO:r-k /\ al /\

OO:r-k /\ al /\

We deduce that
r-k

class (Dk (S)) = r - k+ 2.
This completes the proof of the proposition. •

CHAPTER 4.
PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
4.7.5
The Engel invariant. The Gardner inequalities
Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of rank r and of constant class c.
Definition 4.14 The Engel invariant e (8) of (8) is the smallest integer n
such that (dwt+l = 0 mod (8) for each W E (8).
Two locally isomorphic Pfaffian systems have the same Engel invariant.
When e (8) = 0 the Pfaffian system (8) is completely integrable.
Example 15
Considering the following examples:
1. Let (01, (2) be a Pfaffian system in JRs defined by
{
01 = dXl + X3dx4,
02 = dx2 + X3 d xS.
Then e (8) = 1. In fact, we have 01 /\ 02 =f 0 and (dai )2/\ 01/\ 02 = 0
for every i = 1,2.
2. Let (01, 02, (3) be a Pfaffian system in R7 defined by
{
01 = dxl + X4dxS + X6 d x7,
02 = dx2 + X4dx6 -
XS d X7,
03 = dx3 + X4 d x7 + XS d X6.
In this case we have e (8) = 3.
Proposition 4.7 Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of rank r and of constant
class c of which the Engel invariant is e (8). Then we have
c - r < e (8) < c - r
r+l -
-

'
called the Gardner inequalities.
Proof. Let (01, ... , or) be a local basis of (8) ,which we extend to a Pfaffian
system (01 " .. , Or , f31' ... ,f3n-r) of maximum rank n. The differentials do;
can be written

4.8. THE SCHOUTEN - VAN DER KULK THEOREM
93
Since the Pfaffian system (8) is of class c, the rank of the Pfaffian system
(
n - r
)
~
c~kf3i'
i = 1,···, n - r
J=l
is less than c - r. It follows that for all i the 2-form
is ofrank less or equal to (c-r)/2. Then (dai )[(c;r)]+1 = 0 mod (8) for each
i. There [a] denotes the integer part of a. The choice of the basis (al,· ·· ,ar)
being arbitrary, one has e (8) ~ (c-r)/2. The second inequality results from
the following remark:if (Xl,··· .X«, Yi, ... ,Yn - r ) is a distribution of rank n
verifying
and
then the Pfaffian system
is of rank c. Consequently the Pfaffian system
(
n - r
)
~ c~kf3k (i = 1,···, r ; j = 1,· ··, n - r)
J=l
is of rank c - r and there exists a = .E Uiai such that
(da)l~+~~ 1= omod (8) .
Then, e (8) ~ (c - r)/(r + 1) it is the second Gardner inequality. •
4.8
The Schouten - Van Der Kulk theorem
Theorem 4.6 Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of constant rank r and of con-
stant class c, whose Engel invariant e (8) is m.
There exists a local basis
(al, ... ,ar) of (8) such that each Pfaffian form a i is of class 2m + 1.

94
CHAPTER 4. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
Let us note that in general it is not easy to find the proposed basis in
the Shouten-Van Der Kulk' theorem. We dot not propose the proof of this
theorem. We can refer to the one given by E. Carlan which is based on the
notion of involutive Pfaffian system.
Example 16
Let us consider the following examples:
1. We take n = 7 ; r = 3 and c = 7. Considering the system (8) given
by:
{
01 = dx1 + X4dxS + X6 d x7,
02 = dx2 + X4dx6 -
XSd X7,
03 = dX3 + X4dx7 + XSd X6'
Here we have e (8) = 2. According to the Gardner inequalities, we
have e (8) ::; (7 - 3)/2 = 2. Then we have an example of a Pfaffian
system of which Engel invariant is maximal. The Pfaffian forms 01, 02,
and 03 are of class 5 = 2 x 2+ l.
2. Consider now the following Pfaffian system given by
{
01 = dx1 + X4dxS,
02 = dX2 + X4dx6,
03 = dx3 + X4 d x7.
As previously, we have n = c = 7 and r = 3. But here e (8) = 1.
Thanks to the Gardner inequalities we find that the possible minimum
for such systems is (c- 2)/ (r+1) = 1. This is an example in which the
Engel invariant is minimal. We also note that the basis forms satisfy
the Schouten and Van der Kulk theorem.
4.9
Maximal integral manifolds
Consider a Pfaffian system (8) of constant rank r and of constant class c.
If this system is not completely integrable it is reasonable to be interested
in the nature of integral manifolds of the Pfaffian system, and especially
in integral manifolds of maximum dimension.
We have seen, in the case
where (8) is of rank 1 and of class c = 28+ 1, that there exists a tangent
foliation of the kernel of (8) and of maximal dimension
8 + (r - c). The
case where the rank is strictly greater than 1, is certainly not regular: the

4.9.
MAXIMAL INTEGRAL MANIFOLDS
95
datum of a constant rank and a constant class does not allow us to ensure
the existence of an integral foliation of (S) is of maximal dimension. We
propose in this paragraph to study the upper boundary of the dimension of
tangent manifolds of ker(S) in order to see how the Darboux foliations must
be in the case where r > 1.
Theorem 4.7 Let (S)
be a Pfaffian system of rank r and of maximum
class n, Then every local tangent foliation to the distribution ker (S) is of
dimension d which satisfies
d
r(n-r)
::;
r+1
.
Proof. Let (aI, ... ,ar ) be a local basis of (S) and consider a distribution of
rank n spanned by (Xl,'" .X»; Yi, ... ,Yq,ZI,"" Zs), where r+q+s = n,
satisfying
at each point.
Assume that the distribution generated by (Yl,' ", Yq) is integrable, that is,
[Yi,Yj] =~CtYk' We denote by (aI, ... ,ar,{3!>···,{3q"l,""s) the dual
forms to (Xi, Yj,Zk). We can write:
OOi
=
L
a~kaj /\ ak + L
b~kaj /\ {3k + L
C~kaj /\ ,k
+ L~k{3j /\{3k + Le~k{3j /\,k + LJ]k'j /\,k'
Since the distribution spanned by (YI,"',Yq) is integrable, the functions ~k
are zero identically. The system (S) being of maximum class, the Pfaffian
system spanned by the forms
is of rank 2: q. But it is a Pfaffian system of order sr, therefore we have
the inequality sr 2: q. Hence (n - r - q) r 2: q, this is equivalent to q ::;
r(n - r)j(r + 1). This proves the theorem.•

96
Remark 9
CHAPTER 4.
PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
We observe that when r = 1 we have q ~ (n -1)/2, that is q ~ s (because
in that case n = 2s + 1). But, contrarly to this situation, where we have
made obvious the existence of a foliation of dimension (n - 1)/2, one cannot
assert anything, in the general case, about the existence or not of a foliation
of dimension r(n - r)/(r + 1). For example, the Pfaffian system in lR7
{
01 = dx1 + X4 d xS,
02 = dx2 + X4 d x6,
03 = dx3 + X4 d x7
admits an integral foliation of dimension 3. This foliation is spanned by the
vector fields
o
0
Yi=--X4- ,
oxs
OXI
and
and we have q = 3 = 3.(7 - 3)/(3 + 1) .
In this example, the Pfaffian system is of maximum class and its kernel
is tangent to a three-dimensional foliation. On the other hand, the Pfaffian
system given by
{
01 = dXl + X4dxS + X6 d x7,
02 = dX2 + X4dx6 -
XS d X7'
03 = dX3 + X4dx7 + XS d X6,
although being of rank 3 and of maximal class 7 like the previous one, it is
not endowed with an integral foliation of dimension 3. One can see that, in
fact, the tangent foliations of the kernel of (5) are at the most of dimension
1.
Proposition 4.8 Let (5) be a Pfaffian system of rank r and of maximum
class n = c endowed with an integral foliation of maximal dimension q =
r(n - r)/(r + 1). Then
1. n = p + r + rp;
2. The Engel invariant of (5) is equal to (n - r)/(r + 1).
Proof. In a straightforward way we take q = pr; we have n - r = q + q/r.
The Engel invariant can be calculated easily enough. It will be sufficient to
notice that for every form o of the Pfaffian system (5) we have do (Yi, }j) =
0, where Yi and }j are tangent vector fields of the foliation. But the dimen-

4.9. MAXIMAL INTEGRAL MANIFOLDS
97
sion of the foliation is equal to r(n - r) / (r +1) from which one deduces that
(00)]>+1 = 0 mod (8). •
The inequality given in the preceding theorem can be generalized to the
case of those systems of constant class c: let (8) be a Pfaffian system of
constant class c and of maximum rank r. Then every integral local foliation
of (8) is at most of dimension q = r(c - r)/r + 1).
The proof is identical to the preceding, the single change resides in the
consideration of the characteristic foliation, which is locally transverse to
the integral foliation.

Chapter 5
CLASSIFICATION OF
PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
We are going, in this chapter, to give all the local models, up to isomorphism,
of Pfaffian systems of constant rank and class on jRn with 3 :S n :S 5. Let us
point out some conventions and notations used in the preceding chapters.
Let (8) be a Pfaffian system defined by the equations
{
WI ~ 0,
W r = o.
The Pfaffian forms Wi are assumed to be independent at any point and, to
simplify the writing of this system, one writes
or
One also says that these forms constitute a basis of (8), and if a is a linear
combination of the basis forms Wi, one writes a E (8).
5.1
Pfaffian systems on )R3
Let (8) be a Pfaffian system with three variables.

100
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
1. If the rank of (S) is one, the class c of this system is either 1 or 3.
Thus one has, according to the theorems of Darboux and Frobenius,
the two following models:
(SJ) = {WI = dYI
r = 1, c = 1
(S§) = {WI = dYI -Y2dY3
r = 1, c= 3.
Every Pfaffian system of rank 1 and constant class is locally isomorphic
to (SJ) or (S§) .
2. The rank of (S) is 2. The class of (S) is either 2 or 3. As there is
no Pfaffian system on IRn of rank n - 1 and from class n, one deduces
from it that any Pfaffian system on IR3 of rank 2 is of class 2. Such a
system is completely integrable and locally isomorphic to
(sg) = {
WI = dYI,
W2 = dY2.
3. The rank of (S) is 3.
It is thus completely integrable and by the
Frobenius' theorem it is locally isomorphic to
{
WI = dYI,
(S:) =
W2 = dY2,
W3 = dY3.
Theorem 5.1 Every Pfaffian System on IR3 of constant rank and class is
locally isomorphic to one of the following system described in Table 1. These
systems are pairwise not isomorphic.

If r = 4 the system (8) is completely integrable and, by Frobenius' theorem,
it admits the following local model:
Case r = 3
The system (8) is completely integrable and locally isomorphic to the fol-
lowing system:
Case r = 1
One is brought back to the Darboux theorem. The system (8) is then locally
isomorphic to the one of the following:
if c = 3 and
if c = 1.
5.2.2
Pfaffian systems of rank 2
class(8) = 2
Since the rank is equal to the class, such a system is completely integrable.
It is written locally

102
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
class(8) ~ 3
Let (WI,W2) be a basis of (8). These forms satisfy
the Pfaffian forms WI , W2 , W3 , W4 being linearly independent at any point. As
the Pfaffian system (8) is not completely integrable one of th e two functions
A or B is not identically zero. Let us suppose that A (x) =I 0 at any point
x (the common singularities of A and B are not considered here for they
imply singularities on the class of (8)). Let us consider a change of basis of
(8):
The Pfaffian equations lth = W2 = 0 define the system (8) and satisfy
The system (8) is thus a Pfaffian system on }R4 of rank 2 and constant class
equal to 4. The first derived system of (8) is the Pfaffian system
It is of rank 1. As for the class, two cases can arise:
- class (DI (8)) = 1 that is, DI (8) is completely integrable,
- class (D I (8)) = 3.
(Here, again, we consider only Pfaffian systems whose numerical invariants
are constant). Two Pfaffian systems corresponding to each one of these two
cases cannot be locally isomorphic because class (DI (8)) is an invariant up
to local isomorphism.
i. class (D I (8)) = 1
By hypothesis one has diJJ2 = 0 mod (W2)' The system DI (8) is completely
integrable; thus there is a coordinates system (Yl, Y2 ,Y3 ,Y4 ) such that

5.2. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS ON ]R4
103
In this system the integral manifolds of W2 = 0 are the planes of the equation
dY2 = 0 and on one of these planes the form (;h (which satisfies diiJi
=
Wgl\w4 mod (8)) induces a contact form. Hence the system (8) satisfies the
hypothesis of the Darboux' theorem with parameters. One deduces from
this theorem that (8) is locally isomorphic to the Pfaffian system
(st) = { WI = dYI + ygdY4,
W2 = dY2'
ii. class (DI (S)) = 3
To simplify the notations, one removes the bars of the representatives of
(S). There is a basis (W},W2,wg,W4) of Pfaffian forms such that if (W}'W2)
is a basis of (8) one has
{
di..JI = Wg 1\W4 mod (S) ,
di..J2 = WI 1\ Wg mod (W2) .
The derived system D I (S) = {W2} being of class 3, one can choose, from
Darboux' theorem, a coordinate system (YI, Y2, yg, Y4) of]R4 such that W2 is
reduced to the canonical form
In this coordinate system the form WI is written
The change of basis (WI = WI - a2W2, W2 = W2) does not alter the written
form of W2, and allows us to assume that a2 is zero in the expression for WI.
However, WI 1\W2 1\ di..J2 = O. One deduces that
yielding al = 0, and thus WI = agdyg + a4dY4. As WI is never zero one of
the two functions ag or a4 is non-zero. Notice that with the variables yg
and Y4 playing symmetrical roles in the expression of W2, by replacing ygdY4
by Y4dyg - d (YgY4) one can assume ag =f 0 and replace WI by wI!ag what
amounts writing :

104
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
As WI A W2 A dwl =I 0 we obtain
(dY3 + a4dY4) A (dY2 + Y3dY4) A da4 A dY4 =I 0,
that is, dY3 A dY2 A da; A dY4 =I 0_The functions (a4,Y2,Y3,Y4) form a local
coordinate system of IR4. By setting a4 = fh one obtains the following local
model:
{
WI = dY3 +fh dY4,
W2 = dY2 + Y3dY4-
Conclusion. Let (S) be a Pfaffian system on ]R4 of rank 2 and class 4. Ifthe
first derived system DI (S) is of rank 1 and class 3, then there is a system of
local coordinates (YI, Y2, Y3,Y4) such that the system (S) is represented by
. (~) = { WI = dY3 + y l dY4,
W2 = dY2 + Y3dY4-
Theorem 5.2 Let (S) be a Pfaffian system on ]R4 of constant rank and
constant class. Let us assume that its derived systems also are of constant
rank and constant class. Then (S) is locally isomorphic to the one of the
following systems described in the table 2. These systems are pairwise not
isomorphic.

Examples
1. The Monge's problem
The problem consists in determining two functions h (x) and 12 (x) of a real
variable satisfying a differential equation of the type
If (x) = F (x,h (x) ,12 (x) ,/2(x)) .
If F is linear with respect to the variable 12(x), then this equation has the
following form
If (x) = G(x,h (x) ,12 (x)) + AI2 (x).
One is led to find the integrals of a Pfaffian equation with 3 variables of the
form
dz = Ady + Gdx.
We have
dh (x) = Adh (x) + Gdx.
Set 12(x) = u to obtain
dh = F(x,h,h,u)dx
and
dh =udx.
Then the problem is reduced to find the integrals of the Pfaffian system of
two equations and four variables (x, h, 12, u)
{
WI = dh -Fdx
W2 = dh -udx.

that is
106
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
We have
{
di.vI = -dF /\ dx
di.v2 = -du /\ dx.
{
di.vI = -~du /\ dx - MidfI /\ dx - BfJdh /\ dx
di.v2 = -du /\ dx.
Consider the Pfaffian form
This form verifies
that is,
Thus
{
(8) =

DI (8) =

.
Then the system (8) is locally isomorphic to one of the following systems
(S~) or (SV . In order to describe the isomorphism one has to return the
equation WI = 0 to his canonical form.
2. Differential equations with two variables
We consider the following differential equation:

and setting dy/ dx = u. The above equation can be written as
dz
du
dx =A(x,y,z,u) dx +B(x,y,z,u).
This yields the Pfaffian system of two equations and for the variables
{
WI = dy - udx
W2 = dz - A (x,y,z,u) du - B (x,y,z,u) dx.

3. Examples of compact manifolds provided with a Pfaffian system
of type 8~
We will give in this paragraph some examples of 4-dimensional compact
manifolds equipped with a Pfaffian system of rank 2 and class 4, whose the
first derived system is of class 3 at any point.
Let n4 be the 4-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra whose the structural
equations are :
I
di.v1 = W3 /\ W4,
di.v2 = -WI /\ W3,
di.v3 = 0,
di.v4 = O.
This algebra admits the matricial representation
n.={O ~41~ ~), ~ ER}

the Lie algebra is n4. It is defined by the group of matrices

forms Wi on the Lie group are written

W2 = dY2 - Y3dYI + !!fdY4,
W3 = dY3,
W4 = dY4'
Let us consider the Pfaffian system (8) defined by (WI,W2) on the Lie group
N 4 • It is of class 4 and of rank 2, its first derived system is of class 3, and it
is (globally) isomorphic to
(8~). The isomorphism is given by
{
ZI = YI +Y4,
Z2 = Y2 - YIY3+ y~:4,
Z3= Y3 + 1,
Z4 = Y4.

108
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
It is clear that the Lie group N4 is not a compact manifold. Let us consider
the discrete subgroup K of N 4 formed by the matrices
with 'ni E Z. It is a closed subgroup of N4 • Thus the quotient manifold
N4/ K is equipped with a structure of differential manifold of dimension 4.
As one can choose a representative of each equivalence class of N 4 / K with
coordinates Yi less or equal to 1, the quotient manifold is compact. The
Pfaffian forms Wi being right invariant, there exist Pfaffian forms Wi on N4/ K
such as Wi = 1f*Wi, where 1f : N4 ----+ N4/ K is the canonical projection. The
Pfaffian system (S) = (WI,W2) defined on N4/K is isomorphic to (51). This
describes well an example of a compact manifold equipped with such Pfaffian
system.

a Pfaffian system of type (S~).
5.3
Pfaffian systems of five variables
Pfaffian systems of five variables has been extensively studied by Elie Cartan
([14]). In the previous paragraph, we have seen that, for dimensions ~ 4,
there exists only a finite number of models of Pfaffian systems, up to local
isomorphism, the rank and the class being constant. For the 5-dimensional
case, the result is quite different. We are going to put in obviousness a family
of Pfaffian systems on ]Rs parametrized by a function.

system is completely integrable and by the Frobenius theorem, it is locally
isomorphic to the following model
Non-integrable case
Assume that one of the functions
~, for example the function A3 , is not
identically zero. One works on an open subset where A3 has no zero in order
that the system is of constant class. If A3 is without zero, the class of (8)
is equal to 5. Since these does not exist a Pfaffian system of rank 3 on IRs
of constant class 4 the class of (8) is 5. Consider the change of bases

5.3. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS OF FNE VARIABLES
111
The forms WI,w2, Wg are independent at each point, and define equations of
system (8). We have
that is,
{
dwl = A IW4 /\ Ws -
A IW4 /\ Ws - d (4;) /\ Agwg , mod (8)
dw2 = A 2W4 /\ Ws - A2W4 /\ Ws - d (t) /\ Agwg, mod (8)
dwg = tW4 /\ Ws, mod (8) .
Thus
{
dwg = 0
dw2 = 0, mod (8)
dwg = W4 /\ Ws·
Lemma 17 Let (8) be a Pfaffian system on IRs of mnk 3 and of constant
class.
If the system (8) is not completely integmble, there exists a basis
(Wl,W2,wg) of (8) satisfying
{
dwg = 0
dw2 = 0
mod (8) ,
dwg = W4 /\ Ws,
where W4 and Ws are Pfaffian forms independent with Wl,W2,Wg.
In this case the first derived system D I (8) of (8) is the Pfaffian system of
rank 2 spanned by WI and W2
Since D I (8) is an invariant of (8) , we observe the behavior of this system,
so as to deduce local models for (8).
1) D I (8) is completely integrable
In this case the system (8) satisfy:
{
dwl = 0
mod(DI (8)),
dw2 = 0
mod(DI (8)),
dwg = W4 /\ Ws
mod (8) .

112
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
The system D 1 (8) being completely integrable, there exists a local coordi-
nate system (YI,' . . ,Ys) on RS such that
{
WI = dYI,
W2 = dY2.
Consider the (local) integral manifolds to D 1 (8). With respect to the coor-
dinates system (YI, · · . ,YS) , these are defined by equations
YI
-
constant,
Y2
-
constant.
They are planes parallel to (Y3, Y4,Ys). Let N be an integral manifold defined
by YI = y~, Y2 = y~, where y~ and y~ are given. Let
j:N~Rs
be the natural injection
j (Y3,Y4,YS) =
(Y~,Y~ ,Y3,Y4,YS)
.
Then j*W3 is a Pfaffian form defined on N of constant class equal to 3. In
fact, we have
d (j*W3) = j*W4 1\ j*ws,
that is a non-vanishing 2-form on N.
Now consider the situation where the derived system (8) is completely
integrable. On each leaf of the integrable distribution D 1(8) the form W3 is
of constant class. According to the Darboux theorem with parameters there
exists a coordinates system (XI, X2, X3) on R5, transverse to the fibration by
planes associated with the derived system (parametrized by YI and Y2), such
that
W3 = dXI + X2dx3.
Therefore we have shown the following result :
Proposition 5.1 Let (8) bea Pfaffian system ofrank 3 of class 5, whose the
first derived system is completely integrable. Then there exists a coordinates
system (XI,X2 ,X3,X4,XS), such that (8) is represented by

5.3. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS OF FNE VARIABLES
2) D I (S) non-completely integrable
Recall that (8) is represented by (WI,W2,Wa), which satisfies
{
dwl = 0,
dw2 = 0
mod(S),
dwa = W4 /\ws
113
and DI (S) = {WI,W2}.
Since D I (S) is not completely integrable one of
functions A, B, A', B' defined by
{
dwl = Awa /\ W4 +Bwa /\ Ws,
dw2 = A'wa /\ W4 +B'wa /\ Ws
is not identically zero.
The derived system D I (S) is assumed to be of
constant rank. Therefore, we can study:
- the class of D I (S)
- the second derived system D 2 (S) = DI (DI (S)) .
First, examine the class of D I (S).
Lemma 18 The class of DI (S) at a point x (of the open of the definition)
is equal to CI = 3+ r (x), where r (x) is the rank of the matrix
(
A(x)
B(X))
M =
A' (x)
B' (x)
.
Proof. By hypothesis the matrix M is not identically zero. We are going
to suppose that it is of constant rank (otherwise one will be working on an
open neighborhood, where the rank is constant and all our study will be
valid in this open set) . We have class, (DI(S)) is equal to the codimension
of the following space:
{Xx E TxRs ",,"Wix (Xx) = 0 and (XJdwdx = 0 mod (DI (8)), i = 1,2} .
Let X be a non-vanishing vector field verifying WI (X) = W2 (X) = 0, Con-
sider the basis (Xl, ·· · ,Xs) formed by vector fields, whose (WI,·· · ,ws) is
the dual basis. Therefore we have X = aaXa+a4X4+asXs and

114
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
Thus, XJdLvl = 0 and XJdLv2 = 0 mod (Dl (S)) imply
{
Aa3 = A'a3 = 0,
Ba3 = B'a3 = 0,
Aa4 + Bas = 0,
A'a4 + B'os, = O.
The two last relationships can be written
M. ( :: ) = O.
If the rank of M is constant and equal to 1 then a3 = 0, and we have
co dim {X"".Wi (X) = 0, i = 1,2 and XJdLvi = 0 mod (D 1 (S)) } = 4.
If the rank of M is equal to 2 then a3 = a4= as = 0 and class (D 1 (S)) = 5.
This proves the lemma.
•
Finally, note that if the rank of M is zero, then class (D1 (S)) = 3 and the
system (8) is completely integrable.
This has led us to examine the two cases:
i) class (D1 (8)) = 4
ii) class (D1 (8)) = 5 .
i) Study of the case class (D1 (8)) = 4
The rank of M is constant, and it is equal to 1. By a change of basis of
Dl (8) we can assume that M is constant, and we have M = (~
~).
This is equivalent to writing:
In this case the second derived system is of constant rank equal to 1. It is
defined by:
D 2 (S) = D 1 (D 1 (S)) = {wI} .
Since D 2 (8) is of constant rank, we can study its class and envisage the
three next cases :
- class (D2 (S)) = 1
- class (D 2 (8)) = 3

5.3. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS OF FNE VARIABLES
- class (D2 (S)) = 5 .
115
il) Let us consider the case class (D2 (S)) = 1 (and class (DI (S)) = 4)
The system D 2 (S) is completely integrable, and in this case we are in
the situation where (S) is of class 5, DI (S) is of class 4 and rank 2, D2 (S)
is completely integrable and it is of rank 1. Thus the Pfaffian system (S) is
totally regular. The Pfaffian system D I (S) is of rank 2 and class 4, whose the
first derived system is of rank 1 and completely integrable. This situation has
been examined in the previous chapter; it follows from the Darboux theorem
with parameters, that there exists a local coordinate system (YI," . ,Y5) of
R5 such that D I (S) admits a basis (WI ,W2) satisfying
{
WI = dYI,
W2 = dY2 + ygdY4'
Consider the basis (WI ,w2,wg) of (S) defined above. Since (W2,wg) = D I (S),
we have
This implies
{
dY2 /\ dyg /\ dY4 /\ dYI /\ Wg = 0,
Wg = aIdYI + a2dY2 + agdyg + a4dY4.
Let Wg =
Wg - aIwI - a2W2; the system (S) is represented by the forms
(Wl,W2,wg) , and by deleting the bars we are returned to the basis (WI ,w2,wg)
of (S) with
{
WI = dYI,
W2 = dY2+ ygdY4,
Wg = agdyg+ a4dY4.
But the rank of (S) is constant and equal to 3. One of the two functions
ag or a4 is not identically zero. Since in the previous representation the
coordinates y g and Y4 play symmetric roles, we can assume that ag is non-
zero, and even without a zero. Divide Wg by ag to obtain the representation
of (S) by the forms
{
WI = dYI,
W2 = dY2 + ygdY4 ,
Wg = dyg + a4dY4.
We have

116
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
Therefore
dYI /\ dY2 /\ dY3 /\ dY4 /\ da4 =I- 0
whose (YI'Y2,Y3,Y4,a4) is a system of independent coordinates on]Rs. Taking
Xs = a4 we obtain the following representation:
Proposition 5.2 Let (S) be a system of rank 3 totally regular with length
2 and of class 5 such that class (DI (S)) = 4. There exists a coordinates
system (Yl, Y2,Y3,Y4,YS) such that (S) is represented by:
i2) class (D2 (S)) = 3 (and class (D1 (S)) = 4)
We have the following flag system:
The first derived system satisfies
mod (D1 (S)) ,
mod (D1 (S)) ,
and dwl /\ WI =I- O.
According to a suitable study in dimension 4 we are
assured that there exists a coordinate system (Yl, Y2 ,Y3,Y4,Ys) such that
{
WI = dYI +Y2dY3,
W2 = dY2 +Y4dY3 .
Now let us consider the basis {WI , W2 , W3} of (8). We have
because W2 E D 1 (8) thus
W3 /\ dY2 /\ dY4 /\ dY3 /\ dYI = O.

5.3. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS OF FNE VARIABLES
117
Replacing W3 by the form W3 = W3 - aiwi - a2w2, we can choose coefficients
al and a2 such that W3 = fsdY3 + f4dY4. Since the rank of (S) is constant
and equal to 3 one of two functions fi is not identically zero.
a) Suppose that f3 has no zero. We take
It verifiesW3 = dY3+gdY4 and dEJ3 = dg/\dY4. The functions (Yb Y2,Y3,Y4,g)
define a local coordinates system on IRs. By renumbering these coordinates
we deduce that (S) is locally isomorphic to the Pfaffian system
{
WI = dXI + X2dx3,
(sg) =
W2 = dX2+ X4dx3,
W3 = dX3+ XSdX4.
(3) Suppose that f4 has no zero. The system is always regular. We take
W3 = W3/ f4 and we have W3 = dY4 + gdY3' As previously (YI' Y2,Y3,Y4,g)
is a local coordinates system and the Pfaffian system considered is locally
isomorphic to
{
WI = dXI + X2dx3,
(SJO) =
W2 = dX2+ X4dx3,
W3 = dX4+ XSdX3'
In his study of Pfaffian systems of five variables, Elie Cartan had not
distinguished the two systems (sg) and (SJO). Although these two systems
are not locally isomorphic (see the next sections), nevertheless, they are
projectively isomorphic. In the tradition of Elie Cartan, projective transfor-
mations were at the root of geometry. This probably explains the voluntary
oblivion of E. Cartan, stated for the first time by Kumpera and Ruiz.
Proposition 5.3 The systems (Bg) and (SJO) are not locally isomorphic.
Proof. The distribution of planes defined by (Bg) (the kernel of (Bg)) is
spanned by the vector fields

where the undefined brackets are assumed to be zero. These relations prove
that the vector fields (XI, 1'2,1'3, Y4, Ys) generate a Lie algebra g of di-
mension 5. Therefore the system (8JO) is associated with a linear system
invariant on the Lie group corresponding to g. On the other hand these
does not exist a Lie algebra of dimension 5 spanned by ker (Bg) . Thus the
systems (8JO) and (Bg) cannot be globally isomorphic.•
Proposition 5.4 Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of rank 3, totally regular
of length 2, of class 5 such that class (D 2 (8)) = 3. Then (8) is locally
isomorphic to one of the two systems:
{
WI = dxl + X2dx3,
(~) =
W2 = dX2 + X4d x3,
W3 = dx3 + XSd X4.
i3) Let us consider the last case class (D2 (8)) = 5 (class (DI (S)) = 4).
Recall the hypothesis
{
di.v1 = 0,
}
di.v2 = 0,
mod (8),
di.v3 = W4 1\ Ws
and
{ ~~ :~3I\W4'
} mod (D I (8)).
di.v3 = W4 1\ Ws·
Since D 2 (8) = {WI} the Pfaffian form WI must be of maximum class. But
di.v1 = 0 mod (D I (8) ) implies di.v1 = owII\{j1+bw21\{j2 and wII\(di.v1)2 = o.
Therefore this case is excluded.
ii) Let us assume now class (DI (8)) = 5.
Here we have

120
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
and the matrix
M= (1,
~,)
is assumed to be of constant rank equal to 2 at each point. Therefore the
second derived system D 2 (S) is reduced to {O}.
Proposition 5.5 Let (S) be a PfafJian system of rank 3 and class 5 for
which first derived system is of rank 2 and class 5. Then this system is
totally regular and of length 1:
(S) ~ DI (S) ~ D2(S) = {O} .
Now determine the canonical form of such a system. Set
( ~~ ) = M-
I
( ~~ )
.
Then WI ,W2 and W3 generate (S) and satisfy
{
diJI=W3/\W4
mod(DI(S)),
diJ2 = W3 /\ W5
mod (DI (S)) ,
dJ.v3 = W4 /\ W5
mod (S) .
Similarly, we name these forms WI,W2,W3 to simplify the handwriting and
one considers a local coordinates system (Xl, .. . , X5) on R,5. Set
We have
and
WI /\ (dJ.v1) 2 = C:i.dXI /\ dX2 /\ dX3 /\ dX4 /\ dX5

The equation WI = 0 is of class 3 if and only if C:i. = O.

5.3. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS OF FIVE VARIABLES

Lemma 19 There exists a Pfaffian form l;h = AIWI + A2W2 such that the
equation WI = a is of class 3.
Proof. In fact, set W = AIWI + A2W2. It is not difficult to see that we have
W/\ dw2
=
-AI [dA2 /\ WI /\ dwl /\ W2 - A2WI /\ dwl /\ dw2J
+Al [-A2dA2 /\ WI /\ W2 /\ dw2 + A~W2 /\ dwl /\ dw2]
-AIA2 [dAI /\ W2 /\ WI /\ dwlJ + A~dAI /\ WI /\ W2 /\ dw2.
The equation W/\ (dw)2 = aappears as a linear partial differential equation
of the first order with respect to the function AI. One chooses a solution of
this equation and the lemma is proved.•
Therefore, we can assume that the system {WI} is of class 3, and ac-
cording to the Darboux' theorem we can choose a local coordinate system
(YI,'" ,Ys) such that
WI = dYI + Y3dY4.
The derived system D 1 (S) being spanned by WI and W2, we can assume that
with respect to the coordinate system (Yi) the form W2 may be written
One of the two functions b2 or bs is non-zero, because the class of DI (S) is
maximum. One works on an open subset where one of these functions, for
example b2, has no zero and one can assume that
Lemma 20 There exists a function h and an integrating factor K such that

In fact, there exists a function K such that
K(dY2 + bsdys)
= ~dY2 + %:;,dys
= dh - ~ dYI - :;dY3 - ~ dY4.
Take for h a function independent of the variable YI.
This allows us to
return the written form of W2 to

122
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
We have
{
m.u2 = dh3 /\ dY3 +db4 /\ dY4,
m.uI = dY3 /\ dY4.
Since D I (S) is of class 5 one of the two systems
is a local coordinate system. Since Y3 and Y4 play symmetric roles we can
assume that dYI /\ dY2 /\ dY3 /\ dY4 /\ db3 i= O. Therefore one has proved:
Proposition 5.6 Under the previous hypothesis DI (S) is locally isomor-
phic to
{
WI = dYI +Y3dY4,
.
W2 = dY2 +Y5dY3 + jdY4.
Now consider the Pfaffian form W3. It is of the form
Since we have
{
m.uI = dY3 /\ dY4 = W3 /\ W4
mod (WI, W2) ,
m.u2 = dY5 /\ dY3 +dj /\ dY4 = W3 /\ W5
mod (WI,W2) ,
one of functions C3 or C4 is non-zero. Suppose C3 i= 0 and
W3 = dY3 + C4dY4 + C5dY5.
The identity dY3 /\ dY4 = W3 /\ W4 mod (D I (S)) implies C5 = 0 then
Similarly
implies
and

5.3. PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS OF FNE VARIABLES
123
Now if we assume that C4 =1= 0 thus we can writte W3 = dY4 + C3dY3 +csdys .
We also obtain
(
8f )-1
Cs = 0
and
C3 = -
Oys
One finds the previous case as soon as 8f /8ys =1= 0 .
Proposition 5.7 Let (S) be a Pfaffian system of rank 3, totally regular
of length 1, of class 5 such that class (D1 (S)) = 5.
Then (S) is locally
isomorphic to the one of systems:
The derived system is of class 5 as soon as f is not a linear function on Ys.
This implies that 8f /Oyg is non zero. Take 8f /8ysas a new variable ys. The
equation W3 = 0 give dY3 = YSdY4 and the system may be written
{
WI = dYl +Y3dY4,
(SJl (F)) =
W2 = dY2 + FdY4,
W3 = dY3 - YSdY4
where F = f + yg. Note that this written form does not respect the flag
decomposition of (S), the derived system is generated by the forms WI and
W2 + (8f/OyS)W3 .
Remark 9 One does not determine in this chapter the relationships con-
cerning the parameter f in order that two systems Sgl (I) and Sgl (I') are
locally isomorphic. Nevertheless, one may be assured that there exists an in-
finity ofmodels, up to localisomorphism, ofPfaffian systems offive variables
(which was not the case in JR4).
5.3.3
Pfaffian systems of rank 2
We consider now a Pfaffian system (S) of constant rank equal to 2 on JRs. Let
WI and W2 be representatives of (S). By choosing a frame (WI,W2,W3,W4,WS)
of Pfaffian forms, we have
{
dwl = A1W3 /\ W4 + A2W3 /\ Ws + A3W4/\ Ws
dw2 = BIW3 /\ W4 + B2W3 /\ Ws + B3W4 /\ Ws
mod(S),
mod(S).

CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
class (8) = 2
The system (8) is completely integrable. It is locally isomorphic to
(8g2) = { WI = dXI,
W2 = dX2.
class (8) = 3
Consider the matrix
M= (AI A

.
Since (8) is not completely integrable the matrix M is not identically zero.
The class of (8) being constant, the rank of M is constant. If the rank of
M is equal to 1 then class (8) = 4. In fact, according to reduction we can
assume that
(100)
M=

.
Then the characteristic system of (8) contains the equations W3 = 0, W4 = 0,
and we have class (8) = 4. If the rank of M is equal to 2 the system (8) is
of maximum class. Thus the case class (8) = 3 is excluded.
class (8) = 4
The matrix M can be reduced to
M=(~

and the system (8) satisfies
{
dwl = W3 !\W4, mod (8) ,
dw2 = 0
which can be returned to a system on ]R4. The suitable study in the preceding
paragraph shows that (8) is locally isomorphic to one of systems

This study has led to the preceding section. The system is isomorphic to

remark that the parameter is probably not a parameter separating non-
isomorphic systems.

The differential forms a4 and as are arbitrary, we can assume that we have:

Contact systems
5.5.1
Contact r-system
Integral manifolds,
Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of constant rank r on Rn. Let D be a completely
integrable distribution tangent at each point to the distribution defined by
(S). Let (WI,'" ,wr ) be a basis of (8) and (Xl,' " ,Xq ) vector fields linearly
independent at each point and defining the distribution D . These vector
fields satisfy
{
[Xi, X j ] =1::%=1 CtXk,
Wi (Xj) = O.
We know that if the system (8) is maximum class n, then the dimension q
of the distribution D verifies q ::; r (n - r) j(r + 1).
We are going to study the Pfaffian systems whose the kernel contains
integrable distribution of maximum dimension q = r (n - r) j(r + 1).
Contact r-systems
Definition 5.1 Let (8) be a Pfaffian system of rank r and of maximum
class n on Rn . We say that (8) is a contact r-system if there exists a com-
pletely integrable distribution D of dimension q = r (n - r) j (r+1) contained
in the kernel of (8).
The existence of an integrable distribution of maximum dimension im-
poses obviously that r (n - r) j(r + 1) in an integer. By taking rp = q we
obtain
q(r+1)=r(n-r)
that is,
n = rp+p+r.

5.5.
CONTACT SYSTEMS
Example 21
For n = 5, r = 2, and p = 1, we consider the Pfaffian system
{
WI = dXI + X3dx4,
W2 = dX2 + XSdX4 .
The kernel of (8) is spanned by the vector fields
137
Since [XI,X2] = 0 the distribution spanned by the vector fields Xl and X2
is completely integrable and contained in the kernel of this system. It is a
contact 2-system.
Remark 10 If r = 1 a contact I-system is a Pfaffian system of mnk 1 and
of maximum class. By the Darboux theorem all contact I-systems on JRn are
locally isomorphic to the system defined by the equation
The main purpose of this paragraph is to generalize this theorem.
5.5.2
Classification of contact r-systems
Theorem 5.6 Let (8) be a contact r-system on JRn with n = r + p + rp.
There exists a local coordinate system
of JRn so that the system (8) is represented by the following equations :
WI = dXI + zidYI +
+ Z(p-l)r+ldyp,
W2 = dX2 + Z2dYI +
+ Z(p-I)r+2dyp,
Wr = dx; + ZrdYI +...+ Zprdyp.
Proof. Let D be the distribution completely integrable contained in
ker (8). It is possible to find a local coordinates system
(UI, ••., Urp,
VI, ••• , Vr+P) of JRn such that the vector fields Xi = 8/8Ui

138
CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
(i = 1, ...,rp) generate the distribution D. Therefore we can choose as
representatives of (S) the forms
r+p
WI = dVI+ L
afdvi
i=r+ 1
r+p
W r = dvr+ L
aidvi.
i=r+1
Thus we have
r+p
dJ.uj = L 001 A dVi,
i=r+1
for every j = 1, ..., r. Since (8) is of maximum class n, the forms (001, dVi)
i = 1, ...,r + p, j = 1, ...,r are independent. It follows that the functions
(a1,Vj) form a (local) coordinate system on Rn. With respect to this coor-
dinate system, the Pfaffian system admits the expected representation. This
proves the theorem.•
5.6
SO (n)-Classification
5.6.1
Position of the problem
A Pfaffian system (8) of constant rank r on Rn is defined by a system of
r linearly independent Pfaffian equations WI = 0, ...,ca; = O. The kernel of
this system is the distribution of (n - r)-planes defined by:
ker; (8) = {Xx E TxRn "",Wix (X) = 0
i = 1, ...,r}.
This distribution is the intrinsic object attached to (S). Note that the equa-
tions Wi = 0 do not form an intrinsic object attached to (8) but every
system formed by independent equations defining the same distribution of
(n - r)-planes. If by abuse of notation we were to denote (S) = {WI , ...,wr }
it would be necessary to understand in this notation that WI = 0, ...,W r = 0
is a system of equations defining the distribution
X J----+ ker; (8) ,

5.6. SO (N)-CLASSIFICATION
139
defined on an open subset U ~ ~n . Every other system of equations defining
the Pfaffian system is of the form
where M (x) = (a{ (x)) is an invertible matrix at each point. Naturally, this
operation has been called a change of basis of (S), the matrices of the change
of basis have values in GL(n,lR). Some differential geometry problems a
privileged particular basis (WI, .. ., wr ) of independent Pfaffian forms. In this
case all changes of bases are not permitted if some properties attached to
the coframe (WI, .. .,wr ) have to be preserved. Consider the following typical
example. Let g2 be a Riemannian metric on lRn . It can be written
222
g
=WI +",+wn
and (WI, ...,wn ) defines a Pfaffian system on lRn of rank n. Since this system
is of rank n and of class n it is completely integrable, and by a change of
basis we can assume that Wi = dXi. The metric returns to the Euclidean
metric
2-d 2
d
2
g
-
Xl + ...+ xn ·
It is clear that this transformation returns the Riemannian geometry to
Euclidean geometry alone . If we desire to preserve the properties of the
metric g2 we have to impose changes of bases preserving this metric, that
is changes of bases with values in SO(n) and not in GL(n,lR). Now the
Pfaffian system associated to the metric cannot be reduced via the Frobenius
theorem.
5.6.2
Classification of Pfaffian systems on ]R2 modulo SO (2)
We consider two Pfaffian forms WI and W2 supposed to be linearly inde-
pendent on lR2. The associated equations WI =.0, W2 =°define a Pfaffian
system (S). The main goal of this section is to determine the local expression
of (S) but the changes of bases allowed are of the form

CHAPTER 5. CLASSIFICATION OF PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS
Proposition 5.8 By an SO (2)-change of basis the Pfaffian forms W1 , W2
admit the following expression with respect to a local coordinates system
(x,y) ofR2
{
W1 = P1dx,
Wz = jUly+ P2dx
where P1 and J.L are without zero functions.
Proof. With respect to the coordinate system (x,y) of R2, we have:
{
W1 = Q1dx + Q2dy,
W2 = (31dx + (32dy.
Consider a matrix
M(x,y) = (aI(X,y)

Introduction
One of the main motivating factors in differential geometry is the conbined
determination and classification of the differential manifolds equipped with
a given geometrical structure.
Recently many works have beeb devoted to foliated manifolds, which we
can see in the context of this book as smooth manifolds endowed with an
integrable Pfaffian system. The study of contact and symplectic manifolds
has received much attention. These manifolds are defined by the existence
of a Pfaffian system of rank 1 and maximum class, or by a closed exterior
2-form of maximum rank.
It is possible to be interested in a more general framework concerning
the study of manifolds equipped with a non-integrable Pfaffian system of a
given constant class. For example the determination and the classification
of connected (simply connected), possibly compact manifold of dimension 5
endowed with a structure locally defined by a Pfaffian system of the type
Sg1(J), seems the most promising. Mathematical and physical considera-
tions (the local study of Pfaffian systems and Nambu's statistical mechan-
ics) have led us to an investigation of manifolds whose geometry is defined
locally by k-symplectic systems. Recall also one of the results est ablished
in chapter 3 that the k-symplectic exterior systems are models of exterior

144
CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
systems of maximum rank.
A general study of exterior systems needs of
such k-symplectic systems. The purpose of this chapter is to define such
ma-nifolds and to approach the existence theorems. The process is classic:
we study the manifolds equipped with an almost k-symplectic structure (at
every point of M the tangent space is equipped with a linear k-symplectic
structure) and we make in obvious the conditions of integrability. The frame-
work of the theory of G-structures is applied to the k-symplectic structure.
A detailed exposition concerning the basic notions of differential geometry
can be found in the book of Sternberg[52J.
A multi-symplectic geometry in a classical field theory was initiated by
Dedecker in 1953 and was developped by Thlczyjew around 1968, by Ki-
jowski in 1973, Gawedzki in 1972 and Sczyba and Kondracki in 1979 (see
for example [38J and [21]). The approach proposed by Geoffrey Martin [21J
concerns a multi-symplectic model for electrodynamics based on the notion
of symplectic (k + I)-vectors fields which generalizes the concept of cosym-
plectic structure on a Poisson manifold. He develops the necessary multilin-
ear algebra of symplectic (k + I)-forms and uses these results to introduce
the geometric structure on which the construction is based. He gives the
dynamical condition and studies the formal properties which establish the
relation between this construction and mechanic.
Our step is analogous .
But the basic notion is related to exterior system of forms of degree 2 when
the approaches of Geoffrey Martin or Kijowski are based on an exterior form
of degree greater than 3.
6.2
k-symplectic manifolds
6.2.1
Definition
Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension n(k+ 1) equipped with a foliation
~ of codimension n, and let 01, .•• ,Ok be closed differential forms on M of
degree 2.
The sub-bundle of TM defined by the tangent vectors of leaves of the
foliation ~ will denoted by E, the set of all cross-sections of the M-bundle
TM ---t M (resp., E ---t M) will be denoted by X(M) (resp., r(E)) and
the set of all differential P:forms on M will be denoted by AP(M) .
For every x E M we denote by Cx(Ol),... ,Cx(Ok) the characteristic
spaces of the 2-forms 01, •.. , Ok at x. Recall that

6.2. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
therefore,
145
where i(Xx)(JP denote the interior product of the vector Xx by the 2-form
(JP.
Definition 6.1 We say that {01, ... , Ok} is a k-symplectic differential sys-
tem associated to the sub-bundle E (or that, the (k+ 1)-uple (01, ••• , Ok;E)
is a k-symplectic structure on M), if the following conditions are satisfied
1. The system {o1, ... ,Ok} is non degenerate, that is,
for every x E M.
2. The system {01, ... , Ok} is vanishing on the tangent vectors to the
foliation J, that is,
(JP(X,Y) = 0
for all X, Y E r(E) and p = 1, ... , k .
6.2.2
Examples
1. Canonical k-symplectic structure on Rn(k+l)
Consider the real space Rn(k+l) equipped with its Cartesian coordinates
(xpi,xih$p$k,I$i$n' Let E be the sub-bundle of TRn(k+l) defined by the
equations
dx 1 = 0, . . . , dxn = 0
and let (JP (p = 1, ... , k) be the differential two forms on M given by
n
Op = L dxpi /\ dxi.
i=1
The (k+1)-tuple (01, ... ,Ok;E) defines a k-symplectic structure on Rn(k+l)
called the canonical k-symplectic structure. This structure induces a natural
k-symplectic structure on the torus yn(k+l).
2. k-symplectic structure on the product of Lagrangian fibrations
Let

146
CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
be k smooth fibrations over an n-dimensional manifold B , let "l be the
trivial product
"l = (M1 X. . . x Mk,B x .. . XB,nJ x . .. X7fk)
and let 8 be the diagonal mapping x
1--+ (x, . . . , x) from B into B x . . . x
B . The fibre product
~ = e XB • •• XB ~k
of fibrations e ,...,~k is the inverse image of "l by 8. It is a smooth
fibration
~ = (M, B, 7f) whose the total space M is the set of elements
(x!, .. . , x k) E M 1 X .. . XM k such that 7fl(x1) = ... = 7fk(xk) ; it is a
closed submanifold of M 1 x . . . XM k • For every b E B, the fibre 7f-l(b) is
the product (7fl)-l(b) x ... x (7fk)-l(b). Let
be the canonical inclusion mapping (i is an embedding) and
prP : M 1 X ••. X Mk ~ MP
(p = 1, .. . , k) the canonical projection on MP. For every p (p = 1, ... , k) ,
the composite prP 0 i is the restriction of prP to M ; it is a submersion.
We suppose that ~P are Lagrangian fibrations (that is MP is endowed
with a symplectic structure uP such that the fibres define a Lagrangian
foliation).
Let 2n be the common dimension of manifolds MP, then the
fibres of ~ are of dimension nk and the manifold M is of dimension n(k+l).
For every p(p = 1, ... , k ), we take
()P = (prP 0 i)*up.
Proposition 6.1 In the previous hypothesis and notation the (k + I) -tuple
(()l, ... , ()k ; E) defines a k-symplectic structure on M, E is the sub-bundle
of T M
defined by the fibres of ~ .
Proof. For every p (p = 1, . . . , k) we have
thus the forms ()Pare closed. Let X
and Y be cross-sections of the sub-
bundle E, let x be a point of M and let p = 1, . . . , k. We have
()~(Xx, Yx) =
uP(prPOi)(x) ((prP 0 i);Xx, (prP 0 i);Yx) ,

6.2. K -SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
147
where (prP 0 i)T is the tangent mapping associated with (prP 0 i).
The
mappings (prPoi) send the fibres of eonto the fibres of ep , thus the vectors
(prP 0 i);Xx and (prP 0 i);Yx are vertical in MP; the foliation defined by
the fibres of ep are Lagrangian by hypothesis, thus
~(Xx,Yx) = O. If for
each x E M and tangent vector Xx to M at x we have i(Xx)8P = 0 for
every p (p = 1,... , k) , then
O~(Xx,Yx) = O.
for all
p(p = 1,... , k) and Yx E Tx(M). The fact that for each p (p =
1, ... , k), (prPoi) is a submersion and uP is of rank 2n proves that i;Xx =
0; thus Cx(Ol) n ··· n Cx(Ok) = {O}.•
Notice that we have:
1. If the manifolds MP are compact, it is similarly so for M and all leaves
of the foliation defined by eare compact.
2. If M 1, . . . , M k coincide with the cotangent bundle T* B of a manifold
B (M1 = ... = M k = T*B) we obtain a k-symplectic structure on
the Whitney sum T*B EEl .. . EEl T* B over B.
3. k-symplectic structure on the bundle of k-(I-covelocities)
This example, often studied in the framework of the regular p-almost struc-
ture [41], corresponds to the canonical k-symplectic structure on the Whit-
ney sum.
Let B be an n-dimensional manifold. We denote by Tk1B the cotan-
gent bundle of k-(I-covelocities) of B, that is, the manifold of all I-jets of
mapping from B to JRk with target 0 E JRk.
For each coordinate system (xih::;i::;n on B we associate the local co-
ordinates
ilk
(x, Xi , ... ,Xih::;i::;n
Xi(JX,OlJ)
xf(Jx,Ol!)
where Jx,Ol! is the I-jet at x E B of the map

148
CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
such that f(x) = O.
We have Tk1B is an n(k + I)-dimensional vector bundle with standard
fibre type lRnA:; the canonical projection is the map 1r : TklB ~ B defined
by
1r(Jx,Ol f) = x.
For each p (p = 1, . . . , k) we have a canonical Lform )l defined by
AP(U)(X) = uP(x)(1r.X)
where u = (u l ,
, uk) E Tk1B, X
E Tu(T;lB) and 1r(u) = x . Let (}P =
dAP where p= 1,
,k and let E=ker1r.;the(k+l)-tuple ((}l, .. . ,(}k;E)
defines a k-symplectic structure on Tk1B.
6.2.3
Darboux theorem
Theorem 6.1 Let M be an n(k + I)-dimensional smooth manifold. If the
(k+ I)-tuple ((}l, ... , (}k ;E) is a k-symplectic structure on M then for every
point p of M
there exists an open neighborhood U of M
containing p
equipped with local coordinates (xpi, xih~p~k,l~i~n called an adapted coordi-
nate system, such that the differential forms (}P are represented on U by
n
()P = ~d# 1\ dxi,
i=l
and the sub-bundle E is defined by the equations
dxl = 0, ... , dx" = O.
Proof. It follows from the Frobenius theorem that there exists a system of
local coordinates (Xl, ... , Xnk,xl , .. . , xn) defined on an open neighborhood
U of M containing p such that the derivatives
a
a
aXI ' .. . , aXnk
generate the tangent space of the leaves at every point of U. The problem is
of a local nature, therefore we can assume that U is an open neighborhood
of lRn(k+l) and p = (XI(p) , ... , Xnk(p),XI(p), ... ,xn(p)) =
O . The forms
(}P are locally exact (Poincare's lemma), we can assume that the differential
forms (}P can be written on the open set U in the form

6.2.4
r -structure associated with a k-symplectic system
Definition 6.2 Let 'I' be a topological space. A pseudogroup r of homeo-
morphisms of 'I' is a family (<Pi)iEI of homeomorphisms of 'I' with domain
Ui and range Vi open subsets of 'I' such that:
1. the identity map of 'I' belongs to I';
2. if <Pi E r then its restriction to any open subset of its domain belongs
to r;
3. if <Pi E r, then <pil E r;
4. if <Pi : U, ---t Vi and <Pj : U, ---t Vi belong to r, with Vi n U, =1= 0 then
<Pj 0 <Pi : <pil(Vi n Uj) ---t <pj(Vi n Uj)
belongs to I';
5. if <P : U ---t V is local homeomorphism of'I' which coincides on neigh-
borhood of each point of U with an element ofr then <P E r .
The pseudogroup r is called transitive if, in addition, for any two points
of'I', there is an element of I' that takes the one to the other.
Definition 6.3 Let r be a pseudogroup of homeomorphisms 'I'. Let M be a
topological space and let Slt be a family (4Ji)iEI of local homeomorphisms
of M onto 'I' where U, (resp. Vi) is an open neighborhood of M (resp. 'I').
We say that Slt is a r -atlas, or an atlas compatible with r if the following
conditions are satisfied:
1. UiEI u, = M;
2. if 4Ji' 4Jj E Slt then 4Ji o4Jj l E r .
The elements of Slt are called charts. A complete atlas of M compatible with
I' is an atlas compatible with r which is not contained in any other atlas of
M compatible with r . Every atlas of M compatible with r is contained in
a unique complete atlas compatible with r .
A complete r -atlas of M is called a r -structure,

6.3. ALMOST K -SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
151
Proposition 6.2 Let M be an n(k + I)-dimensional smooth manifold.
A
k-symplectic structure on is equivalent to a given T -structure on M, where
I' is the pseudocroup of local difJeomorphisms of Rn(k+I) leaving the canon-
ical k-symplectic structure of Rn(k+I) invariant.
Proof.
Suppose that M is equipped with a k-symplectic structure. It
results from the Darboux theorem that there is an atlas
~ (the Darboux
atlas) whose the changes of coordinates belong to the pseudogroup I"; in
other words, the atlas ~ defines a I'-structure on M.
Conversely, if M
admits a I'-structure then there is an atlas
~,whose
changes of coordinates preserve the canonical k-symplectic structure (01, . •. ,
Ok;E) of Rn(k+I), that is, for all (U,r.p), (V;'l/J) E~, we have:
1.
(r.p °'l/J-1)*Op = OP for every p(p = 1,... , k),
2. (r.po'l/J-1)*E(x) = E((r.p °'l/J-1)(x)) for every x E r.p(U)n'l/J(V).
On the domain U of local chart (U,r.p) of ~ we take
u(r.p)P =
r.p*OP
and
P(r.p)(x) = (r.p-1)*E(r.p(x)),
for all p (p = 1, ... , k) and x E U.
On the intersection un V of the
domains of the charts r.p and 'l/J, we have
u(r.p)P = u('l/J)P,
P(r.p)(x) = P('l/J)(x).
for all p (p = 1,... ,k)
and x E unv; thus (ul, ... ,uk ; P) defines a
k-symplectic structure on M .•
6.3
Almost k-symplectic manifolds
6.3.1
Definition
Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension n(k + 1) . We say that M is an
almost k-symplectic manifold if for every x E M the tangent space TxM is
equipped with a k-symplectic structure of vector spaces:
(0;, . .. , O~; Fx ) ,

152
CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
where oP E A2(M).
Of course, we assume that this structure is smooth, that is, for every
Xo E M there exists an open neighborhood Uo of Xo in M and a smooth
cross-section (wpi,wih:Sp:Sk,l:Si:Sn of the bundle of coframes of M such that
n
and
F = kerw 1 n ...kerwk
on Uo. Such a cross-section of the bundle of coframes of M will be called
adapted to the almost k-symplectic structure of M .
6.3.2
Integrability of an almost k-symplectic structure
1. G-structure
Let G be a Lie group and let 9 be its Lie algebra. We assume that G acts
on a smooth manifold M by a smooth right action </> : M x G --t M. We
have a linear mapping X
f---+ X * of 9 into X(M) where
X*(x) = (dd)
</>(x,exp(tX)),
t
t=O
for all X E 9 and x E M; we obtain
[X*, Y*J = [X,Y]* .
for all X, Y E g.
We often omit the </> and simply write xg = Rg(x) for </>(x,g), for all
xE M andg E G.
Definition 6.4 Let G be a Lie group with a unit element e, and let M be
a smooth manifold.
A principal G-bundle over M, with a total space P ,
with a base space M , and with a structural group G, is a smooth mapping
p : P --t M together with a right action of G on P such that:
1. ug = u for some 9 E G implies that 9 = e;
2. M is covered by a family (Ui)iEI of open neighborhoods such that for
every i E I there is a diffeomorphism 'Pi : p-l(Ui) --t U, x G such that
'Pi has the form 'Pi(U) = (P(u),'l/Ji(U)) and 'Pi(ug) = (P(U),'l/Ji(U)g).

6.3. ALMOST K -SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
2. Bundle of Frames
153
Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension n. A frame at a point x of M is
a linear isomorphism u : Rn --+ TxM. Let Fx be the set of all frames at x
Fx = {u : Rn --+ Tx~ u is a linear isomorphism}
and let
FM = Ur:
xEM
Let p : F M --+ M be the mapping defined by p(u) = x if u is a frame at
x, that is u E Fx . The construction of the manifold structure on FM is very
similar to that already used for the tangent and cotangent bundles.
Let
(U, <p) be a chart on M . Define
lj; : p-l(U) --+ U x GL(n,R)
by
lj;(u) = (p(u), d<pp(u) au) .
lj; is a bijection and the topology and differential structure on F M are defined
by requiring these pairs (p-l(U),lj;) to be charts. The group GL(n,R) acts
on the right of FM by uA = uoA for u E Fx and A E GL(n,R). Note that
lj;(uA) = (p(u),d<pp(u) a U a A) ,
so the requirement of the previous definition are met.
Thus, we have a
principal GL(n,R)-bundle.
On the bundle frames FM there sits a canonically Rn-valued linear dif-
ferential form w, defined by
for all u E FM and Xu E Tu (FM)' The Rn-valued linear differential form w
is called the fundamental form of the frames bundle F M .
Definition 6.5 Let p : P --+ M be a principal G-bundle and let H be a
closed subgroup of G. A reduction of the structural group of P to H is a
submanifold Q of P such that p : Q --+ M is a principal H -bundle with
restricted action (thus QH = Q).

154
CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
Definition 6.6 Let p : P -4 M be a principal G-bundle and let Q be the
Lie algebra of G. For g E G we denote by Rg the mapping from Pinto
itself defined by Rg(u) = ug. By a connection on P we mean a Q-valued
differential1-form 7r such that:
1. 7r(u)(A*(u)) = A for all u E P and A E Q;
2. 7r(ug) 0 Rg = Ad(g-l) 0 7r(u) for all U E P and 9 E G.
With a linear connection 7r on the bundle frames we associate the torsion
form of n, which is an lRn-valued two form n defined on FM and related
with the fundamental form w and the connection form 7r by
n = dw + 7r /\ w.
Definition 6.7 Let G be a subgroup of GL(n,lR). A G-structure on an
n-dimensional manifold M, is a G-reduction ofF(M) to the group G. Thus
a G-structure Ba, is a submanifold ofF(M) with the property that for any
x E Ba and any 9 E GL(n,lR) the point xg belongs to Ba if and only if
gEG.
A G-structure P on a smooth manifold M is said to be integrable if every
point of M has a coordinate neighborhood U with local coordinate system
(Xl,. . . ,z") such that (dx l , . . . , dxn ) is a cross-section of the bundle of the
coframes FAtover U. Weshall call such a local coordinate system (xl, .. . ,xn )
admissible with respect to the given G-structure P.
If (xl,... ,z") and
(yl, . .. ,yn) are two admissible coordinate systems in open sets U and V
respectively, then the Jacobian matrix (8yij8xi ) I 'S.i,i'S.n belongs to G at
each point of U n V.
3. Adapted connection
Definition 6.8 A linear connection 7r on an almost k-symplectic manifold
is adapted to the almost k-symplectic structure if, with respect to an adapted
cross-section of the bundle of coframes ofM, the connection form (7r~) takes
its values in the k-symplectic Lie algebra sp(k, n; R); in other words, the
components of the connection

4. The case where G = Sp(k, n;R)
An almost k-symplectic structure on an n(k + I)-dimensional manifold
M is equivalent to a given G-structure with G =
Sp(k, n; R).
Such a
Sp(k,n;R)-structure is integrable if this almost k-symplectic structure cor-
responds to a k-symplectic structure. Consequently we can return to the
calculation of the Bernard tensor in order to integrate this G-structure. But
the vanishing of this tensor is equivalent to the existence of an adapted con-
nection without torsion. Therefore we are going to study the problem of the
existence of such a connection.
Note that the integrability of a G-structure implies the vanishing of
the Bernard tensor; the reverse is false in the general case.
In the case
of an almost k-symplectic structure there is an equivalence between the
integrabi-lity and the vanishing of this tensor (or the existence of an adapted
connection without torsion).
The almost k-symplectic structure is integrable if and only if about every
point of M we can find a coordinate neighborhood U with a local coordinate
system (xpi, Xi)l::;P::;k,l::;i::;n such that
n
()P = 'Ld# 1\ dxi

and F is defined by the equations

CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
Proposition 6.3 Let M be ann(k+1)-dimensional manifold equipped with
an almost k-symplectic structure such that the distribution x I---t F(x) is

Hamiltonian systems
In this section we extend the classic formalism of symplectic geometry to
the k-symplectic structure.
6.4.1
Basic functions-foliated vector fields
Let M be an n-dimensional smooth manifold, let ~ be a q-codimensional
foliation on M, and let E be its corresponding p-dimensional integrable sub-
bundle ofTM, with p = n - q.

6.4. HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS
157
Definition 6.9 A smooth function f on M is said to be basic if for every
Y E I'(E') the derivative Y(f) of f
along Y is identically zero.
We will
denote the set of the basic functions by Ag(M,~);it is clearly a subring of
the ring AO(M) of smooth functions.
Proposition 6.4 Let f E AO(M). The following properties are equivalent
1. f is basic;
2. f is constant on each leaf;
3. In every simple distinguished open set equipped with distinguished local
coordinates (xl, ..., xP, yl , ..., yq) the function f depends only on the variables
y1, ...,yq.
If U is an arbitrary open set of M, a smooth function f on U which is
basic for ~u will be said to be a basic local function.
Definition 6.10 A vector field on M is said to be foliated, or an infini-
tesimal automorphism of~, if for all Y E I'(E') the Lie bracket [X, YJ also
belongs to I'(E').
Proposition 6.5 Let X E X(M). The following properties are equivalent
1. X is foliated;
2. If (CPt)ltl<e is the local one parameter group associated with X on
neighborhood of an arbitrary point of M, then, for all t, the local diffeomor-
phism CPt leaves the sub-bundle E invariant;
3. In every simple distinguished open set equipped with distinguished local
coordinates (xi, yi h 5i5p, 15i5q ,the vector field X
takes the form:

that if f E Ag(M,~) and X E £(M,~) the function X(f) is basic (X(f) E
Ag(M,~)) and the vector field fX is foliated (fX E £(M,~)) .
6.4.2
Hamiltonian systems
Let M
be a smooth manifold of dimension n(k + 1) equipped with a
k-symplectic structure (01, •.• , Ok; E) and let j be the mapping from X(M)
into AI(M) x ... x A1(M) defined by
j(X) == (j1(X), . .. ,jk(X)) == (i(X)01, .. . ,i(X)Ok)
for every X E X(M).

CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
Definition 6.11
A vector field X
on M
is called a Hamiltonian sys-
tem if it is an infinitesimal automorphism for the k-symplectic structure
(01, .. . ,(Jk; E) , that is, if the following conditions are satisfied:
1. X
is foliated;
2. LxOl = ... = LxOk = 0 where Lx is the Lie derivative with respect
to X.
From the relationship
LxO = i(X)dO + di(X)O
we see that the second condition of the previous definition is equivalent to
requiring that the Pfaffian forms i(X)OI, ... ,i(X)Ok are closed.
6.4.3
Hamiltonian mappings
Let X be a Hamiltonian system. It results from the Poincare lemma that
for every x E M there exists an open neighborhood U of M containing x
and a smooth mapping H : U ----t IRk satisfying the relation
j(X)JU = - dH JU .
Conversely, if H is a smooth mapping from M into IRk such that dH E
j(£(M,~)), there exists a unique vector field on M,denoted XH and called
the Hamiltonian system associated with H, such that
j(XH) = -dH
on M; the vector field XH is called a strongly Hamiltonian system.
A smooth mapping H: M
----t IRk satisfying dH E j(£(M,~)) is called
a Hamiltonian mapping of the k-symplectic structure (01, • . . , Ok; E) .
Proposition 6.6 Let H =
(HPh~p~k be a Hamiltonian mapping and let
XH be the associated Hamiltonian system. With respect to an adapted coor-
dinates system (xpi, xih~p~k.l~i~n, the components HP of Hand XH can

the associated Hamiltonian systems. The Lie bracket [XH,YK] is a Hamil-

Let SJ(M) be the set of Hamiltonian mappings of the k-symplectic struc-
ture (O\ ... ,OkjE). The association (H,K)
1----+ {H,K}, of SJ(M)xSJ(M)
into SJ(M) , is a skew-symmetric IR-bilinear mapping satisfying the Jacobi
identity.

6.5
Nambu's statistical mechanics
A notable feature of the Hamiltonian description of classical dynamics is
Liouville's theorem, which states that the volume of phase space occupied
by an ensemble of systems is conserved. The theorem plays, amongst other
things, a fundamental role in statistical mechanics.
On the other hand,
Hamiltonian dynamics is not the only formalism that makes a statistical
mechanics possible. Any set of equations which lead to a Liouville theorem
in a suitably defined phase space will do (provided, of course, that ergod-
icity may be assumed).
Nambu proposes a possible generalization of the
Hamiltonian dynamics for a 3-dimensional space.
In this section we are going to see that the Hamiltonian mappings of
the 2-symplectic structure of IR3 are solutions of Nambu's system. First, we
recall the basic equations of Nambu's statistical mechanics [47].
Let (x, y, z) be a triplet of dynamical variables (a canonical triplet) which
span a 3-dimensional phase space M.
This is a formal generalization of
conventional phase space spanned by a canonical pair (p,q). Next, we will

6.5. NAMBU'S STATISTICAL MECHANICS
161
introduce two functions H and G depending on (x,y,z) which serve as a
pair of Hamiltonians to determine the motion of points in phase space. More
precisely Nambu has postulated the following Hamilton equation:
dx
D~H,G?
dt =
D y,z
'
!El _
D~H,G?
dt -
D z,x
'
dz _ D(f'G?

where D(H, G)/D(y, z) denote the Jacobian
D(H, G)
8H 8G
8H 8G
D(y,z)
8y 8z - & 8y.
The above equations are called Nambu's equations of motion, and the vector
field whose integral curves are given by Nambu's equations of motion will
be denoted by X(kG) and called the dynamical system of Nambu .
Consider the space M =
]R3 equipped with its canonical 2-symplectic
structure ((}1,rP;E) defined by
(}1 = dx /\ dz,
(}2 = dy /\ dz,
E = kerdz.
The Hamiltonian mapping of the 2-symplectic structure are the mapping
H : M
--+ ]R2
whose components are given by
HI = f(z)x + gl(z),
H 2 = f(z)y + g2(z) ,
where i . gl
and g2 are smooth real functions depending only on the
variable z. The integral curves of the Hamiltonian system XH of the 2-
symplectic structure are given by the following equations:

CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
Theorem 6.2 Let H = (Hl,H2 ) with HI = f(z)x + gl(z) and H 2 =
f(z)y+g2(z)) be Hamiltonian mappings of the 2-symplectic structure. Then
the Hamiltonian system XH and the dynamical system of Nambu Xii are
related by
Xii = f(Z)XH.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the following relations:
and
D(Hl,H2) _ _ f(z)oH I

D(H1,H2) _ _ f(z )oH2

k-symplectic Lie algebras
6.6.1
Definition
Let G be a Lie group of dimension n(k+1) with Lie algebra Q, equipped with
a k-symplectic structure ((}l, ... , (}k ; E). We assume that such a structure is
left-invariant that is, for any g,x E G and p = 1, ... , k we have

6.6.
K -SYMPLECTIC LIE ALGEBRAS
163
Let ~ be the left-invariant foliation defined by the sub-bundle E. The leaf
H of
~ passing through the unit element e of G is an n- codimensional
connected Lie subgroup of G. Let 'H be the Lie algebra of the subgroup H.
Thus, we have associated with the sub-bundle E, a Lie subalgebra 'H of 9
such that
()P(X,Y) = 0
for all X ,Y E H; we identify the differential form ()P(e) at the unit element
of G with the corresponding bilinear form on g, also denoted ()P.
Conversely, let H be a subalgebra of g. For every x E G we take:
P(x) = {Xx E TaG I f7(Xx) E 1i}
where f7 is the Maurer-Cartan l-form of G. The associated distribution
defines an integrable sub-bundle of TG.
The leaf H of the foliation ~
associated with P and passing through the unit element e of G, is a Lie
subgroup H of G with Lie algebra 'H such that the orbits of H acting by
the right translations on G are the leaves of ~ .
Definition 6.12 Let 9 be a Lie algebra of dimension n(k+ 1) over]I{ (]I{ =
lR or C), ()1, .. . , ()k be closed forms of degree two (belonging to A2(g)), and
let H be a Lie subalgebra of 9 of codimension n. We say that (()1, ... , ()k; 1i)
is a k-symplectic structure on 9 if the following conditions are satisfied
1. The exterior system {()1, ()2, ... , ()k} is non-degenerate, that is
2. The Lie subalgebra H is a totally isotropic subspace of 9 with respect
the system {()1, ()2, . . . , ()k} , that is,
'
()P(x,y) = 0
for all x ,y belonging to H and p = 1, . .. , k.
Let A be an n(k+l)-dimensional vector space over the field ]I{ (]I{ = lR or
q and let (wjh ~j~n(k+l) be a basis of the dual space A* of A. Considering
the mapping 8 of A* into A2(A*) defined by:
8wr = L~:/ wik+r Awnk+i+l

8wa = 0
if k + 1 :S a :S nk + 1,
8wnk+i = _wnk+1 A wnk+i
for 2 :S i :S n.

164
CHAPTER 6. K-SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS
We have 8 0 8 = 0, therefore the mapping 8 confers upon A a Lie algebras
law. Let (Xih:~i~n(k+l) be the basis of A whose dual basis is (wih5i5n(k+l)'
and let .1 be the ideal of A spanned by (Xih5i5nk. The (k + l)-tuple
((jI = 8wl , ... , Ok = 8wk j.1)
defines a k-symplectic structure on A.
6.6.2
Nilpotent l-symplectic Lie algebras
Recall here the theorem of Medina ([43]).
Theorem 6.3 Let G be a Lie group with a completely solvable Lie algebra
Q.
If 0 is a left-invariant symplectic form on G, then (G,O) admits an
invariant Lagrangian foliation.
Recall that a Lie algebra Q is completely solvable if the adjoint repre-
sentation of Q is trigonalizable, in other hand, if there exists a decreasing
sequence of ideals (of Q) of dimensions n, n - 1, n - 2, ... ,
0, where
n = dim Q. For example every nilpotent Lie algebra is completely solvable.
Corollary 6.2 Every symplectic Lie algebra is 1-symplectic.
Consequence: Classification of 1-symplectic nilpotent Lie algebra of di-
mension less than 6.

Lie algebras of the type (2,2;.:1)
We consider here the case of 2-symplectic Lie algebras of the type (2,2; .1).
These Lie algebras are given by:

P = 1,2
dw5 = WJJ5 /\ w6 ,
dw6 = vw5 /\ w6 ,

k-SYMPLECTIC AFFINE
MANIFOLDS
7.1
Affine manifolds
Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension n. We say that M is an affine
nanifold if there is an atlas (Ui,<Pi) of M such that the changes of coordinates
are restrictions of affine transformations of lRn . An affine structure on M is
equivalent to a given connection
V: r(TM) x r(TM) ~ r(TM)
such that both the curvature
k(X, Y) = V[X,YI- (VxVy - VyVx)
and torsion
T(X,Y) = VxY - VyX - [X,Y]
vanish identically.
Example 23 The circle 8 1 is an affine manifold. It is, in fact, the unique
sphere equipped with an affine structure.

CHAPTER 7. K -SYMPLECTIC AFFINE MANIFOLDS
7.2
Affine Lie group
7.2.1
Definition
A Lie group G is called affine, if there exists a left-invariant affine structure
on G, that is, for every x E G the mapping
Lx: G -t G
defined by
is affine. In other words, the group G is endowed with a left-invariant flat
affine connection.
7.2.2
Left symmetric product
Let 9 be the Lie algebra of the affine Lie group G. By identifying the left-
invariant vector fields on G with the elements of 9 we define a new product
on 9 by taking
X ·Y=VxY.
The property that V is without curvature, implies that this product verifies
X· (Y . Z) - Y . (X . Z) = [X, Y] . Z.
Such a product is termed left-symmetric.
Each symplectic Lie group is affine.
In fact, the product in the Lie
algebra 9 given by:
O(X . Y,Z) = -O(Y, [X, ZJ)
is left symmetric associated with the bracket, where 0 is a left-invari ant
symplectic form.
Proposition 7.1 Every 1-symplectic Lie group is affine.
In this chapter, we are going to show that every k-symplectic mani-
fold is affine with respect to the differential structure defined by the leaves
underlying the k-symplectic structure.

7.3. CHARACTERISTIC FOLIATIONS

Characteristic foliations
175
7.3.1
Definition
Let M be an n(k+1)-dimensional smooth manifold. Let E be an integrable
n-codimensional sub-bundle of TM . Let ()l, ... , ()k be closed 2-forms on
M . Let TMIE be the quotient bundle. Let v be the canonical projection
TM --t TMIE = vE . Let
i/'E be the dual of vE. We denote by
~
the foliation defined by the sub-bundle E . For each p (p = 1, ... , k) and
x E M we denote by Cx((JP) the characteristic space of (JP at x.
All geometric objects on M are assumed to be of class Coo.
Let ((Jl, . . . , (Jk;E) be a k-symplectic structure on M. Recall that about
every point of M we can find an open neighborhood U and local coordinates
(xpi , xih~p~k,l~i~n on U, called adapted coordinates, such that
n
oru = :L dxpi A dxi,
i=l
E IU = ker dx1 n .. . n ker dx"
for each p (p = 1, ... , k).
Equivalently, there exists an atlas
~ of M, called the Darboux at-
las, whose the changes of coordinates belong to the pseudogroup of local
diffeomorphisms of ]Rn(k+1) leaving the canonical k-symplectic structure
invariant.
It follows from the previous canonical Darboux expressions that the dif-
ferential forms
(JP are of class 2n ; this implies that the distribution
defines an integrable sub-bundle of TM.
For each p (p = 1, . .. ,k) we take
In terms of the adapted coordinates (xpi, xih~p~k,l~i~n, we have:
1. vE is spanned by the derivatives 01ox!, ... ,01oxn;
2. v*E is spanned by the differential forms dx1, • . • , dx":
3. EP is spanned by the derivatives 01oxPl , •. . ,01oxpn.

CHAPTER 7. K -SYMPLECTIC AFFINE MANIFOLDS
Proposition 1.2 We have:
1. For each p (p= 1, .. . , k) the sub-bundle EP is integrable;
2. E = E 1 EB ••• E9 E k (direct sum) and [EP, Eq] c nr#p,qC(or)
3. For each p (p = 1,... ,k) the mapping X I--t i(X)OP
defines an
isomorphism ip of vector bundles over M of EP onto
1/*E.

Definition 1.1 The foliations~ of M defined by the sub-bundles EP are
called the characteristic foliations of the k-symplectic structure.

tor fields Xl, ... ,xj satisfying
1. X~ is tangent to leaves of characteristic foliations ';fP for each p,
Proof.
By the duality ip : X

It is clear that we have Xr E EP, and the first point is proved.

CHAPTER 7. K -SYMPLECTIC AFFINE MANIFOLDS
7.3.3
Associated connection
We now give a flat affine connection along the leaves. Let \7 be a basic
connection on vE , that is, an lR-bilinear mapping
\7 : r(E) x r(vE) -t r(vE)
such that
\7xZ = v[X , ZJ ,
for each X E I'(E') and Z E r(vE), where Z E X(M) is such that v(Z) =
Z.
Recall that the curvature k of \7 is a correspondence which associates
with every pair (X,Y) E r(E) x r(E) a mapping
iix, Y) : r(vE) -t r(vE)
given by
iax, Y)Z = \7x\7yZ - \7y\7xZ - \7[X,YjZ,
Z E r(vE).
We have k(X,Y) = 0 for each X , Y E I'(E').
Let p = 1, ... , k and let £. be a leaf of ~. For each X , Y E X(£.) we
take
\7XY = i;l(\7;'(ip(Y))),
where \7* is the map of
r(EP) X T'(z-"E) -t I'(v" E )
defined by
(\7;'0-) Z = Lx(o-(Z)) -
o-(\7xZ)
for each X E r(EP) , 0- E I'(z-"E) and Z E r(vE) and Lx denote the Lie
derivative with respect to X. \7 defines an affine connection along the leaf
£.. Let T be the torsion tensor of \7. Let Z be a local cross-section of
the bundle vE -t M and let Z be a local cross-section of the bundle
TM -t M such that v(Z) = Z. We have
and
OP(\7xY - \7YX,Z)
= OP(i;l(\7;'(ip(Y)) -
\7~(ip (X)))
, Z )
= (\7;'(ip(Y)))(Z) -
(\7~(ip(X)))(Z) ,

7.3.
CHARACTERiSTIC FOLIATIONS
then
OP(\7xY - \7yX, Z)
= Lxip(Y)(Z) - ip(Y)\7xZ - Lyip(X)(Z)
+ip(X)\7YZ,
= Lx (OP(Y, Z)) -
OP(Y, [X, ZJ)
+Ly(OP(Z,X)) + OP(X, [Y, Z]) .
Consequently, we have
oP(T(X,Y) , Z)
= Lx(OP(Y, Z)) + Ly(oP(Z, X))
+ OP(X,[Y,ZJ) - OP(Y, [X, ZJ) - OP([X,Yj,Z) ,
= dOP(X,Y, Z).
As OP is closed, Z arbitrary and i p is an isomorphism, then
T(X,Y) = O.
179
The curvatures k , k and k* of \7, \7 and \7* respectively are related by
where Xl, X2, Y E X(..c). We have k == 0, thus k* == 0 and k == 0 and
we have proved the following proposition:
Proposition 7.5 \7 is a flat connection; it defines an affine structure along
the leaf..c.
We are now going to define a flat connection on the leaves of the foliation
~ inducing other flat affine connections. Let rot be a leaf of~. For every
X, Y E X(rot) we take
k
DxY
= L i;I(\7;'(ip(YP))),
p=l
where YP E r(EP) such that Y = y l + ... + y k . It is clear that D defines
a connection on rot whose restriction to the leaf ..c coincides with \7. This
connection is without torsion. In fact , if X and Y belong to I'(E') , then

Thus
(}P(DxY - DyX,Z)
= Lxip(YP)(Z) - ip(YP)'V'xZ - Lyip(XP)(Z)

Therefore the torsion TI of D is zero. This proves, in particular, that if X
E r(EP) and Y E r(Eq) then
[X,YJ = DxY -DyX.
As for the vanishing of the curvature, it is proved analogously.
Theorem 7.1 Let M be a k-symplectic manifold. Then the leaves of'J and
'JP are affine.

Recall the Blumenthal theorem [11]
Proposition 7.6 Let M be a smooth compact manifold with finite funda-
mental group. Then M does not support a foliation with a fiat basic connec-
tion.
Corollary 7.1 Let (M,F) be a foliatedd manifold with a fiat basic connec-

IfHI (M, Z)

element; that is, 'J is defined by a nowhere zero closed q-form on M where
q is the codimension of 'J.

7.4.

AB consequence we have:
Proposition 7.7 Let M be an n(k+1)-dimensional manifold equipped with
a k-symplectic structure. Then:
1. If M is compact then the fundamental group 1f1(M) of M is infinite;
2. If H1(M,Z) = 0 then the foliation
~ is defined by a nowhere zero
closed n-form on M.
Recall that a foliated vector field X of the sub-bundle E is a Hamil-
tonian system if the differential forms i(X)Ol, ... ,i(X)Ok are closed.
Let H =
(HPh$p~k be a Hamiltonian mapping and let X be the asso-
ciated Hamiltonian system. With respect to the adapted coordinate system
(xpi, xih~p~k,l~i~n , the components HP of Hand XH can be written:

where Ii and gP are smooth basic functions on U. Consequently we have:
Proposition 7.8 The flow generated by X respects the affine structure of
the leaves of ~, that is, X
is an infinitesimal affine transformation of the
space M with its differential structure of dimension nk defined by the leaves
of ~ and the restriction of H to each leaf of ~ is an affine transformation.
7.4
Flag connection on a pair of sub-bundles
Let M be a smooth connected manifold and E be a q-dimensional sub-
bundle of TM. Let AP(M) be the space of all p-forms on M and reE)
(resp. X(M)) be the AO(M)-module of all cross-sections of E (resp. T M) .
Let TMjE be the quotient bundle. Let v be the canonical projection
TM --t TMjE = vE.

182
CHAPTER 7. K -SYMPLECTIC AFFINE MANIFOLDS
Let v"E be the dual of vE.
We denote by ~ the foliation defined by
E when this sub-bundle is integrable.
All geometric objects on M are assumed to be of class Coo.
A transverse frame at a point x of M is a linear isomorphism of Rq onto
the transverse space (vE)x , and the set of these transverse frames is a fibre
bundle Er(M,vr,GL(q,R)) over M. Recall that a connection w on Er
is said to be basic if the parallel translation which it defines along paths
lying in a leaf of ~ agrees with the 'natural parallelism along the leaves'.
Equivalently, the associated Koszul operator
\7 : X(M) xr(vE) -
r(vE)
satisfies the condition that
\7xZ = v[X, ZJ
for all X Er(E) and all Z Er(vE), where Z is any vector field on M , such
that v(Z) = Z. Choosing of Riemannian metric on M , we may regard vE
as a sub-bundle of TM complementary to E
(TM =
E tBvE). If we
denote by \7 the covariant differentiation operator corresponding to the
basic connection, then we have
\7xY = v[X,YJ
for all XEr(E) and all Y E r(vE).
Definition 7.2 A basic connection on the sub-bundle E
is an lR -bilinear
map
\7 : I'(E') x r(vE) -
r(vE)
satisfying
\7xZ = v[X, ZJ
for each XEr(E) and ZEr(vE) where Z E X(M) such that v(Z) = Z.
For every XEr(E) , YEr(vE) and !EAO(M) we have:
\7/xY = !\7xY ,
\7xfY = X(f)Y + !\7xY.
A linear connection 7r on Er(M,ur,GL(q,lR)) is basic if and only if the
covariant differentiation operator corresponding to 7r gives a basic connec-
tion on the sub-bundle E . Using the basic connection on an integrable
Lagrangian sub-bundle, we obtain:

7.4.
FLAG CONNECTION ON A PAIR OF SUB-BUNDLES
183
Proposition 7.9 Let (M,n) be a symplectic manifold equipped with a La-
gmngian foliation ~ . Then each leaf of ~ has a canonical flat affine connec-
tion.
Let M
be a smooth connected manifold, let E be a q-codimensional
sub-bundle of TM and let F
be a sub-bundle of TM contained in E
(Fc;E). If E is integrable then
[X,Y] E r(E)
for each X, Y EI'(F'). For ZEr(lIE) these holds Z = lI(Z) for some Z E
X(M); Z is well defined modulo r(E). Thus for XEr(F) and ZEr(lIE)
\JxZ = lI[X, Z]
is well defined. This is clearly R-bilinear as a map
\J : I'(F] x r(lIE) -t r(lIE)
as can be verified
\JfxY = !\JxY,
\JxfY = X(f)Y + !\JxY,
for all XEr(F), YEr(lIE) , and for all !EAO(M). This satisfies the defi-
nition of a connection on the sub-bundle E, except that the variable X is
restricted to ranging over I'(F).
Definition 7.3 A flag connection on the pair (E,F) is an lR-bilinear map
\J : r(F) x r(lIE) -t r(lIE)
such that
\JxZ = lI[X, Z],
for each XEr(F) and ZEr(lIE) , where Z E X(M) satisfies lI(Z) = Z.
Such a connection will be called an P-connection on E . Notice that we
have :
1. Under the assumption that the sub-bundle E admits a basic connec-
tion (in particular if E is integrable), there exists an F-connection on
E, for each sub-bundle Fc;E.
2. A flag connection on the pair (E, E) is a basic connection on E.

CHAPTER 7. K -SYMPLECTIC AFFINE MANIFOLDS
Proposition 7.10 Let E =
FlEe.. .EeFq
be a direct sum of sub-bundles
FI, . .., Fq of T M such that for each p we have an FP-connection V on
E. Then the sub-bundle E admits a basic connection..
Proof. Let X =
E~l XP E r(E) , XPEr(FP) and let ZEr(vE). If we
take
we will obtain
q
\JxZ = LV[XP,Z] = v[X,Z] ,
p=l
where Z E XM) satisfies v(Z) = Z; this proves that \J is a basic con-
nection on E . •
Proposition 7.11 Let F be an integrable sub-bundle of TM, such that
F~E, let \J be an F -connection on E and let k be its curvature. Then
k(X, Y) = 0 for each X, Y E r(F).
Proof. The curvature k of the F-connection \J is a correspondence which
associates with every pair (X, Y) E I'(F') x I'(F) a mapping
k(X, Y) : r(vE) -- r(vE)
given by
k(X, Y)Z = \Jx\JyZ - \Jy\JxZ - \J[X,YjZ,
Z E r(vE) .
Let X, Y
E I'(F') , Z E r(vE) and Z E X(M) be such that v(Z) = Z.
If we take
v[X, Z] = [X, Z],
v[Y, Z] = [Y,z],
we will obtain
k(X, Y)Z
= \Jx(v[Y,Z]) - \Jy(v[X, Z]) - v[[X, Y], Zl
= v[X, [Y, Z]] + v[Y, [Z,X]] + v[Z, [X, Y]]
= 0. •
The notion of flag connection allows us to find the existence of an affine
structure on the leaves of the characteristic foliations.

k-symplectic affine structure
Let M be an n(k+ I)-dimensional manifold with a k-symplectic structure
(0\ ....e, E).
Definition 7.4 We say that M
is an affine k-symplectic manifold if the
Darboux atlas ~ confers upon M
a structure of a locally affine manifold.
Let Gp(k, n; R) be the group of all affine transformations of R n(k+1) ,
leaving the canonical k-symplectic structure of Rn(k+1) invariant.
The
group Gp(k, n; R) is the set of all affine transformations
X f---+ AX + B
of R n(k+1) such that A E Sp(k, n; R) .
Proposition 7.12 Let M
be a complete connected affine k-symplectic ma-
nifold of dimension n(k + 1). Then M
is just a quotient Rn(k+1)jr and
with a fundamental group r, where r is a subgroup of A(n(k +1)) acting
freely and properly discontinuously on R n(k+1) :
M
= R n(k+1)tt;
7r1(M) = r .
Recall that a manifold M equipped with a connection \l is said to be
complete if every geodesic of \l can be extended to a geodesic defined on R
Proof.
M is a complete connected affine manifold, that is, a quotient
Rn(k+1)jr whose fundamental group
7r1(M) is isomorphic to I' where T
is a subgroup of A(n(k+ 1)) acting freely and properly discontinuously on
lRn(k+1)
M
=
R n(k+1)jr,
7r1(M) = r.
Let q : Rn(k+1) ----t M
= R n(k+1)jr be the canonical projection (q is the
covering map), and let P be the sub-bundle of TlRn(k+1) defined by
q*P:x =
Eq(x)
for all x E Rn(k+1). The (k + I)-tuple (q*o1, ... ,q*Ol j P ) defines a r-
invariant k-symplectic structure on Rn(k+1) .
The changes of coordinates of M
are affine transformations of lRn(k+ 1)
leaving the canonical k-symplectic structure invariant. By the definition of
the quotient M
= R n(k+1)jr we see that I' is contained in Gp(k, nj R) .•

Proposition 7.13 Let M be a complete connected affine k-symplectic ma-

Then M

M = JRk+1jr,

Proof.
It results from the previous proposition that M
is a quotient
JRk+ljr and has a fundamental group T where T is a subgroup of A(k+1)
acting freely and properly discontinuously on JRk+1• An affine transformation

are satisfied:
1. 9 = (S, q,T) E Hp(k, 1;JR.);
2. T rt JR..S .
In particular we have r c Hp(k, 1;JR.). •
We assume now that n = 1 and k = 2 . Let rg2012 be the subgroup of

Proposition 7.14 We have:

1. The subgroup rg2012 acts freely and properly discontinuously on lR3 .
2. The quotient Mg2012 = lR3/ rg2012 is an orientable complete compact
2-symplectic connected locally affine manifold.
3. The manifold M~2012 is a homeomorphic to the torus T3 if and only if
SO = 0.

If 9 admits a fixed point then

and 9 = (0,0,0). If D2 = °then 8 = °and we have two possibilities

(b) if SO

Then the subgroup G = rg2012 acts freely on R3.
We now show
that G acts properly discontinuously on R3 j that is, the following

By (a'), (b'), (d) we have

then I'E?=1l'il is an integer less than 1, 'E~=1 l'i = 0 and z = z'. By

Consider now two points Ql and Q2 of ]R3 not congruent modulo

2. The fact that the vectors (TJ, 0) , (T1,0) and (T2,q2) are linearly
independent permits us to see that the quotient ~2012 is a compact
manifold.
The orientability of this manifold follows from each element of the
group Hp(2,1 ;lR) having positive determinant.
3. Following references [3] and [4J, two compact connected complete lo-
cally affine manifolds M1 and M2 are homeomorphic if and only if
the fundamental groups 71"1 (MI) and 71"1 (M2) are isomorphic; this im-
plies that

Strongly Hamiltonian systems
Let M be an n(k + I) -dimensional manifold equipped with a k-symplectic
structure (fJl, ....e,E). Let ~ be the foliation defined by the sub-bundle
E. By the relationship
LxfJ = i(X)dfJ + di(X)fJ
for every wE AP(M) we see that the following properties are equivalent:
1. LxfJ1 = . . . = LxfJk = 0;
2. The Pfaffian forms i(X)fJl, .. . ,i(X)fJk are closed;
where Lx is the Lie derivative with respect to X . Then a necessary and
sufficient condition for an infinitesimal automorphism X of ~ to be a Hamil-
tonian system is that
are closed Pfaffian forms.
Recall that a strongly Hamiltonian system on M is a Hamiltonian sys-
tem X such that there exists a smooth mapping H : M ~ ]Rk satisfying
j(X) = -dH

192
CHAPTER 8. HOMOGENEOUS K -SYMPLECTIC G-SPACES
wherej(X) = (jl(X), ... ,l (X )) = (i(X)Ol, ... ,i(X )Ok).
Let 3(M) be the set of Hamiltonian systems and let 6(M) be the set of
strongly Hamiltonian systems of the k-symplectic structure. The manifold
M is assumed to be connected, then we have:
Proposition 8.1 Let H
be a Hamiltonian mapping and let XH
be the
Hamiltonian system associated with H. The following properties are equiva-
lent
1. j(XH) = 0;
2. XH = 0;
3. H is constant on M .
Consequently the sequence of Lie algebras

is exact, where inj is the canonical injection and v is the mapping from
.fj(M) into 6(M) defined by
v(H) = XH
for each H E .fj(M).
Proposition 8.2 The following properties are satisfied:
1. [3(M),3(M)]
~ 6(M) ;
2. 6(M) is an ideal of 3(M) .
Proof. We have
i ([X, Y])OP = [Lx ,i(Y)]oP = Lx(i(Y)OP) = -d(OP(X,Y))
for all X and Y
belonging to 3(M) , thus [X, Y]

property is immediate. •

k-symplectic actions
Let G be a Lie group, 9 the Lie algebra of G, and M be a smooth manifold
of dimension n(k+ 1) equipped with a k-symplectic structure ((Jl, .. . , (Jk; E),
and let
'P : GxM --t M
be a smooth left action of the group G on M . For every 9 E G we denote
bY'Pg the diffeomorphism
X
I---t 'P(g, x)
ofM.
Definition 8.1 We say that M is a k-symplectic G-space if for every 9 E
G and x E M we have
1. 'P;(JP = fJP. for each p (p = 1, ... , k) ;
2. ('Pg)*Ex = Erp(g,x) .
If, in addition this action is transitive we say that M is a homogeneous
k-symplectic G-space.
For every X E 9 we denote by XM the fundamental vector field asso-
ciated with X with respect to this action. It is defined by
d
XM(X) = dt ('P(exp(tX), x))1 t=O·
The vector field XM is complete and the association (J': X
I---t XM from
9 into x(M) is an injective anti-homomorphism of Lie algebras, that is,
and it is well known, that if, in addition, the group G acts effectively on M
then
(J' is injective.
Let x EM; denote by G.x the orbit of x under G, and let Gx be
the isotropy subgroup of x in G; with respect to this action Gx is a closed
subgroup of G and the homogeneous space G/Gx admits a natural structure
of smooth manifold, the G-orbit G.x will be equipped with its structure of
smooth manifold in order that the bijection
g.Gx I---t 'P(g, x) ,
from G/Gx onto G.x is an isomorphism of smooth manifolds.
For M not necessarily connected we have ([34]):

194
CHAPTER 8. HOMOGENEOUS K-SYMPLECTIC G-SPACES
Proposition 8.3 For every x E M
and y belonging to the G-orbit G.x
the tangent space Ty (G.x) of G.x at the point y is the set of tangent vectors
of type XM(y) such that X E 9 and the Lie algebra 9x of Gx is formed by
elements X
E 9 such that XM(X) = 0 :
Ty(G.x) = {XM(Y) I X E 9}
and
9x = {X E 9 I XM(X) = O}.
There is a natural action of the Lie group G on the real space hom(Q, IRk) ,
called the coadjoint representation and inducing the ordinary case for k = 1;
this action is given by
for all g E G , f E hom(Q, IRk) and X E 9. The orbits of this action are
called coadjoint G-orbits.
It follows immediately from the definition of a k-symplectic G-space that
we have:
Proposition 8.4 Let M be a k-symplectic G-space. For every X E 9 the
vector field XM is a Hamiltonian system.
Definition 8.2 A k-symplectic G-space M is said to be strongly k-symplectic
if for every element X E 9 the vector field XM is a strongly Hamiltonian
system.
Proposition 8.5 For a k-symplectic G-space M to be strongly k-symplectic,
it is necessary and sufficient that there exists a basis (Xl, . .. ,X
T
)
of 9
whose the associated fundamental vector fields Xlt ,...,XM are strongly
Hamiltonian systems.
Proposition 8.6 A k-symplectic G-space M is strongly k-symplectic in the
following cases:
1. The de Rham cohomology group HI(M,IR) is trivial;
2. 9 verifies [9,9] = 9.

Proof. Let M be a k-symplectic G-space and let X E 9. Assume that
the de Rham cohomology group HI (M, IR) is trivial, then the Pfaffian forms
i(X)OI, .. . ,i(X)Ok are exact. Therefore there exists H E COO(M, IRk) such
that j(XH) = -dH, thus M is a strongly k-symplectic G-space.
If [9,9j = 9 then there exist Xl, yl . . . , X", yq E 9, such that

We have [3(M),3(M) J ~ 6(M) and XM E 3(M) for X E 9. Then
[Xk,¥kJ E
6(M)
for all i (i = 1,... ,q), thus XM is a strongly Hamiltonian system which
proves that the k-symplectic G-space M is strongly k-symplectic. •
Definition 8.3 Let M
be a strongly k-symplectic G-space.
A lift of M
is a Lie algebras homomorphism J from 9 into Sj(M) such that for each
X E 9, the vector field XM coincides with the Hamiltonian system which
is associated with the Hamiltonian mapping -J(X) ; in other words, a ho-
momorphism of Lie algebras J from 9 into Sj(M) is a lift of M if the
condition
is satisfied for every X E 9.
Definition 8.4 A strongly k-symplectic G-space equipped with a lift is called
a Hamiltonian G-space.
8.2
Momentum mappings
The concept of momentum mapping was introduced in symplectic geometry
by Smale and Souriau. In this section, we will generalize to the k- sym-
plectic case this notion. For a general presentation of these notions, see for
example, [LBN-MRL].

196
CHAPTER 8. HOMOGENEOUS K-SYMPLECTIC G-SPACES
Definition 8.5 Let M be a Hamiltonian G-space equipped with a lift J .
The momentum mapping of J is the mapping J from Minto hom(Q,IRk )
defined by
J(x)(X) = J(X)(x)
for all x E M
and X E g.
8.2.1
The canonical k-symplectic case
Consider the real space IRn(k+l) equipped with its canonical k-symplectic
structure ((jl, . .. ,()k; E) defined by the forms
n
()P = L dxpi /\ dxi .
i=1
and by the sub-bundle E of TJRn(k+l) defined by the equations
dx1 = ... = da" = 0,
where (xpi, xih~p~k,l~i~n is the Cartesian coordinate system of IRn(k+l).
Let M be the space M = IRnkx(IRn_{O}) equipped with the k-symplectic
structure induced by the canonical k-symplectic structure of IRn(k+l). The
natural action
(8, X) I---t 8X
of the k-symplectic group 8p(k, nj IR) on M is transitive and effective, and
M is a strongly homogeneous k-symplectic 8p(k, n;IR)-space. In fact, every
element X of .sp(k,n;R) can be written
where A

It results immediately that the mapping H : M --t lRk whose components

is a Hamiltonian mapping of X M . The association X I---t -Hallows us to
define, thanks to the preceding construction, a mapping
J : sp(k, n;R) --t S)(M)
satisfying
J(X)(O) = O.
and
One verifies easily that J is a morphism of Lie algebras. Thus the mapping
J confers upon M a structure of a Hamiltonian Sp(k,n; lR)-space.

8.2.2
Some properties of the momentum mapping
Let
M
be a k-symplectic G-space.
For all H
E S)(M) and 9 E G,
cp;H E S)(M); more precisely, we have:
Let, now, M be a Hamiltonian G-space equipped with a lift J , then for all
X E 9 and 9 E G we have
Thus follows:
Proposition 8.7 Let M
be a k-symplectic G-space. For every 9 E G the
mapping cp; is an isomorphism of Lie algebras from S)(M) onto itself.
It is well known that for each X E g , 9 E G and t E lR we have
exp (tAdgX) = 9 exp (tX) g-l.
By derivation with respect to t we obtain
If M is a Hamiltonian G-space with left J then we have
for every X E 9 and 9 E G. In other words, for each 9 E G and X E 9
the mapping
8(g)(X) = (cpg-l)*J(X) - J(AdgX),

8.2. MOMENTUM MAPPINGS
199
defined on M and with values in lRk , is constant on M ; hence there is a
smooth mapping from G into hom(Q,lRk ) , also denoted by 8 , such that
for all 9 E G and x E M we have
8(g) = J(cpg-l (x)) - Act;-l (J(x)).
Let c: 9 ---4 hom(Q,lRk ) be the mapping defined by
c(g) = 8(g-I).
for all 9 E G. We have:
C(glg2)
= J(CP9l (CP92(X))) - Ad;l (Ad;2(J(X)))
= J(CP9I (CP92(X))) - Ad;1 (J(CP92(X)))
+Ad;1(J(CP92(X))) - Ad;1 (Ad;2(J(X)))
= C(gl) + Att;1 (C(g2) )
for all gllg2 E G and x E M, then the components cP of c (which are
mappings from G into g*) satisfy the condition
characterizing the l-cocycles of G with respect to the coadjoint represen-
tation, thus
c~ = Att; 0 c; 0 L~-I
for all 9 E G, where cT denotes the tangent mapping of c, e the unit
element of G and L the left-translation of G .
Proposition 8.8 For all 9 E G and X, Y E 9 we have:
8(g)([X, Y]) = o.
Proof. In fact, we have
J(Adg[X, Y]) = J([AdgX, AdgY)) = {J(AdgX), J(AdgY)},
As 8(g)(X) and 8(g)(Y) are constant on M , thus
J(Adg[X, Y))
= {(cpg-I)*J(X), (cpg-I)*J(Y)}
= CPg-I)*{J(X),J(Y)}
= (CPg-I)*J([X, Y]),
yielding 8(g)([X, Y)) = 0.•

200
CHAPTER 8. HOMOGENEOUS K-SYMPLECTIC G-SPACES
Proposition 8.9 For all 9 E G and X E g, the mapping e is constant
on the curve ,(t) = 9 exp (tX).
Proof. For all Y E g , we have:
(fte(,(t)lt=o)(Y)
= ft((cpg exp(tX)-l)*J(Y»lt=o - J(Adg[X,Y])
= dJ(Y) 0 (ft((CPexp(-tX) 0 If'g-l)lt=o) - J(Adg[X,Y])
= - dJ(Y)(XM) 0 If';l - J(Adg[X,Y])
= (cp;)-l{J(X), J(Y)} - J(Adg[X,Y])
= (1f';)-lJ([X, Y]) - J(Adg[X, Yj)
= e(g)([X, Y]) = O.
As Y is arbitrary
This proves the proposition. •
The previous proposition implies that Sr = 0 and C[ = 0 ; consequently
we have c'{; = 0 for any 9 E G. But e is constant on the unit component
of G; thus we have
e(g)(X) = S(e)(X) = J(X) - J(X) = 0,
for all 9 E G and X E g , thus
If'; 0 J = J 0 Adg
for every 9 E G. We have proved the following proposition:
Proposition 8.10 The momentum mapping j
is equivariant; that is, for
every 9 E G we have
Corollary 8.1 Let M be a Hamiltonian G-space, let H be a G-invariant
Hamiltonian mapping, that is, H(If'(g,x»
= H(x) for all 9 E G and x E
M. Then the associated momentum mapping j
is constant on the integral
curves of the vector field XH.

Consider now a strongly k-symplectic G-space, let Xl, .. . .X" be a basis
of 9 , and let u»,...,H" be Hamiltonian mappings associated to XL,...,
Xu respectively. The linear mapping
Jo: 9 ---+ .fj(M)
defined by
Jo(X i ) =
_Hi
for each i (i = 1, ... ,r) satisfies the relation
XJo(X) = -XM
for every X E 9 . If Jo is a morphism of Lie algebras, then M is a Hamil-
tonian G-space. Suppose that Jo is not a morphism of Lie algebras. Let
J.L: 9 x 9 ---+ .fj(M)
be the mapping defined by
J.L(X, Y) = {Jo(X), Jo(Y)} - Jo([X,Y]).
For all (X, Y) E 9 x 9 we have
X",(X,Y) = 0,
thus J.L(X,Y) is constant on M, and consequently J.L defines a skew-symmetric
R-bilinear mapping (3 from 9 x 9 into Rk •
Proposition 8.11 Under the previous hypothesis and notations we have the
following properties
1. 6{3 = OJ
2. If there exists a E hom(9, Rk ) such that (3 = So , in particular if the
de Rham cohomology group H2(M,R) is trivial, then M admits a lift
(which is not unique in the general case);
3. If H 2(M,R) is trivial and [9,9] = 9 the G-space M has an unique
lift;
4. If {3 is not a coboundary, that is, (3 is not of the form 6a where
a .E hom(9,]Rk), then there exists a connected and simply connected
Lie group G(/f) with Lie algebra Q(3) = 9 x]Rk with respect to the
law
B((X,T),(Y,S)) = ([X,Y],{3(X,Y)) ,

such that M is a Hamiltonian G({3)-space.

CHAPTER 8. HOMOGENEOUS K-SYMPLECTIC G-SPACES

_f3([Z2, Z3], Zl)
= -{JO([Zl, Z2J), JO(Z3)} + {JO([Zl, Z3J), JO(Z2)}
_{JO([Z2, Z3J), JO(Zl)},
and for each p (p = 1, ... ,k) we have:
{JO([Zl, Z2J), JO(Z3) Y
= -01'([Zl, Z2]M, ZL)
= (i(ZL)BP)([Zl, Z2]M)

= -BP(Xpo(Zl),Jo(Z2n ,XJo(Z3)
= - {{JO(Zl), JO(Z2)} ,JO(Z3)Y
then,
{JO([Zl, Z2J), JO(Z3)} =
- {{JO(Zl), JO(Z2)} ,JO(Z3)} .
Consequently we have:
8f3((Zt,Z2
,Z3) = {{JO(Zl), JO(Z2)} ,JO(Z3)}
- {{JO(Zl), Jo(Z3)} ,JO(Z2)} + {{ JO(Z2) , JO(Z3)} ,JO(Zl)}

and the first assertion is proved.

the mapping from 9 into .fj(M) defined by
J(X)(x) = Jo(X)(x) - a(X)

+a([X, YJ) = /-L(X, Y)(x) + a([X,YJ)

for all X, Y E 9 and x EM. The mapping J defines a lift of M, which
proves the second assertion.
We now prove the uniqueness of the lift. Suppose that H2(M,lR) = {O}
and [9,9] = 9. The second property proves that the k-symplectic G-space
admits a lift. Let Jl ' Jz be two lifts of M. The relationship
for any X E 9 , proves that the mapping
from Minto lRk is constant for every X
E 9; then J1 - h
defines a
mapping from 9 into lRk which is a homomorphism of Lie algebras from 9
into lRk ; therefore
.
(Jl - J2)([X ,Y]) = 0
for all X, Y E 9. Thus, the restriction of the mapping J1- J2 to [9,9] is
zero, but [9,9] = 9, therefore J1 - J2 = 0 and the assertion 3 is proved.
~let us prove the property 4. Suppose that (3 is not a coboundary.

Coadjoint G-orbits
Let M be a homogeneous Hamiltonian G-space equipped with a lift J with
momentum mapping j and let 1{E be the set
1{E = {X E g IXM E r{E)}.
The sub-bundle E of T M is integrable, thus 1-lE is a Lie subalgebra of g .
Proposition 8.15 For every x EM , the tangent space of the leaf of ~
passing through the point x is given by:
Proof. It results immediately from the definition of 1{E that we have
for every X E 1{E .
Conversely, let
Vx E Ex . Considering the space M equipped with its
structure of an nk-dimensional manifold whose components are the leaves
of the foliation
~. The tangent space of M
at the point x with respect to
this manifold structure is Ex. The action of G on M is transitive, thus
there exists X E g such that
Hence for the initial structure of differential manifold of M , XM is a cross-
section of E, thus X E 1{E ; on the other hand,
with X E 1{E.•
Proposition 8.16 If the action of G on M
is effective, then 1-lE is an
abelian Lie subalgebra of g.
Proof. The fundamental vector fields are Hamiltonian systems, then for all
X, Y E 1-lE and p (p = 1, . .. , k) we have

for all p (p = 1, ... , k), because XM and YM are tangent vector of the
leaves of '5, therefore
As a consequence,
[X,Y]M = O.
This action of G on M is assumed to be effective, thus we have
[X,Y] = O.
This proves that 1{E is an abelian Lie algebra. •
Example 24 Consider the case of the canonical k-symplectic space. In this
case 1{E is the Lie algebra tp(k, nj JR) of the Lie group Tp(k, nj JR), it is the
subgroup of Sp(k, n j JR) spanned by the k-symplectic transvections. The Lie
subalgebra tp(k, n; JR) is an abelian ideal of sl'(k, n; JR)
For every X E g we denote by X* the fundamental vector field as-
sociated with X with respect to the coadjoint action of the group G on

For all p (p= 1, ... ,k) and Y E 9 we have

In fact, Xl - X2 belongs to the Lie algebra 9, of the isotropy group G, of

consequently,
Thus we have
Proposition 8.18 Underthe previoushypothesis and notations there exists
on the coadjoint G-orbit 0, closed differential forms !V, ... ,Ok E A2(0)

for all / = (fPh5,p5,k belonging to the coadjoint G-orbit 0, X*(f), Y*(j) E

Proof. Let / = (fPh5,p5,k EO, X,Y,Z E 9 and p = 1,... , k . We have
!1j([X*,Y*j

= (jP,[[X,Y],ZJ) -(jP,[[X,Z],YJ)

Therefore,
dOj(X*, Y*,Z*)

dOj(X*, Y* ,Z*)
= (jP, [X, [Y, Z]]) - (jP, [Y, [X, Z]])
+ (jP, [Z, [X,Y]])
= 0,
which proves that the differential forms OP are closed. •

~t M be a homogeneous Hamiltonian G-space equipped with a lift J ,
let J be the momentum mapping associated to the lift J and let Xo be
a point of M. The Lie group G acts transitively on M, then for each x
belonging to M, there exists 9 E G such that x = c.p(g, xo); the equivariance
of the momentum mapping J implies that
J(x) = J(c.p(g,xo)) = Ad;(J(xo)) ,
which proves that J(M) is a coadjoint G-orbit. Let f E hom(Q, ]Rk), 0 be a
coadjoint G-orbit of f and let JI be the mapping from 9 into CCXl(O,]Rk)
defined by
JI(X)(g) = (g,X)
for all X E 9 and 9 EO. We have
J*(JI(X))(X)
JI(X)(J(X))
(J(x),x)
J(X)(x)
for every X E 9 and x EM , hence
J* 0 JI = J.
It follows that we have
Lemma 25 For every X E 9 if JI(X) is constant on 0
then J(X) is
constant on M.
The momentum mapping being equivariant, then for all X

CHAPTER 8. HOMOGENEOUS K-SYMPLECTICG-SPACES
thus,
J*XM = X* .
Let X, Y E g, let I E hom(Q,Rk), let 0
= G.I be the coadjoint
G-orbit of I, let 9 E 0 and let p = 1,... , k. We have

(i(X*)O~)(Y*) .
We have proved the next proposition:
Proposition 8.20 For all X E 9 and p = 1, ... , k we have
i(X*)OP =
- d(Jj(X» .
Let X E g, I
E hom(Q,Rk) and 0 = G.f . The three preceding proposi-
tions show that the equality J*XM = 0 implies that Jf(X) is constant on
0; hence J(X) is constant on M . Consequently i(XM)OP = 0 for every
p = 1,... ,k. It results from the definition of a k-symplectic structure that
XM = 0 and that the mapping J is an immersion; in particular, we have
dim G ~ dim (0). The equivariance of the momentum mapping proves that
G xo ~ Gj(xo) ,
where Gxo ' G j(xo) are the isotropy groups of xo and J(xo) ,respectively;
thus dim(M) ~ dim(O). We deduce that the identity components Gio and
Gy(xo) coincide; consequently the quotient space
G j(xo)
Gxo
is discrete. This proves that
-

G xo

We have
shown the following result:

8.4. COADJOINT G-ORBITS
213
Proposition 8.21 Let M
be a homogeneous Hamiltonian G-space with a
lift J and with associated momentum mapping i . Then j(M) is a coad-
joint G-orbit, and the mapping j : M ~ 0 from M
onto the coadjoint
G-orbit 0 defines a covering space.
One assumes that the Lie group G acts transitively and effectively on
the manifold M. Let E(O) be the sub-bundle of TO defined by:
E~O) = {X;
'"
X E 'HE}
for every g EO. The previous proposition permits to see that we have:
1. The manifold 0 is of dimension n(k + 1);
2. The sub-bundle E(O) of TO is of codimension n and is integrable.
Proposition 8.22 Let M be a homogeneous Hamiltonian G-space, let Xo be
a point of M, and let f = j(xo). Then
(01, ... ,Ok; E(O»)
defines a k-symplectic structure on 0 = G.f .
Proof.
Let g = (gPh:S;p:S;k be a point of 0
and let X E g. If we have
i(X*)(}P = 0 for every p = 1, ... ,k , then
(gP, [Y, Xl) = (X* (gP), Y) = 0
for every Y E g; therefore, X*(g) = 0, which proves the first condition of
the k-symplectic structure, as for the second condition, it followss from the
property
OP(X*(J), Y*(J)) = 0
for all X, Y E 'HE. •
Proposition 8.23 Under the hypothesis and notations ofthe previous propo-
sition we have :
1. The coadjoint G-orbit 0 = G.f of f
is a homogeneous Hamiltonian
G-space with a lift Jf ;
2. The momentum mapping j is a morphism of k-symplectic manifolds;
more precisely we have:

214
CHAPTER 8. HOMOGENEOUS K -SYMPLECTIC G-SPACES
(aJ JoP = ()P, for every p = 1, ..., k;
(bJ J*(E) = E(O).
Proof. For all X ,YEQ, p(P = 1, ... ,k) and hEO we have:
where 'l/J9 = Ad;. But,
therefore,
(1f!;np)h(X*(h), Y*(h))
=
~g(h)((AdgX)*(h), (AdgY)*(h))
=
- (hP, Adg-l([AdgX,AdgYJ))
=
- (hP, [X, YJ)
=
~(X*(h) , Y*(h)).
One has proved the first condition of the definition of a strongly k-
symplectic G-space; as for the second condition, it results from the rela-
tionship J*XM = X* . The relation
proves that the orbit 0 is a strongly k-symplectic G-space. Let X ,Y E Q,
p (p = 1, ... , k) and hE O . We have:
{Jf(X),Jf(Y)}(h)
= -(n~(xJf(X),XJf(Y»)'
,n~(xJf(X),XJf(Y»))
= -
(n~(X*(h), Y*(h)) ,
,n~((X*(h), Y*(h))
= (h, [X,YJ)
= Jf([X, YJ)(h) ,
then, Jf is a morphism of Lie algebras from Q into.fj(0) , consequently the
coadjoint G-orbit 0
is a homogeneous Hamiltonian G-space, which proves
the property 1. The property (b) comes from the relationship J*XM = X *
and the fact that J(M) is a coadjoint G-orbit and from the mapping J from
Minto 0 defining a covering space. Now let X, Y E Q, p (p = 1, ... , k)

8.4. COADJOINT G-ORBITS
and Xo EM. We have:
(i·op)xo (XM(XO),YM(XO))
= O)(xo) (( i.XM)(xo),(i.YM)(xo))
= O)(xo)(XM(i(xo)), YM(i(xo)))
= - (ft(XO)' [X,Y])
= - (JP([X,YD, xo)
= {J(X), J(Y) }P(xo)
=
~o(XM(XO), YM(XO)) .
This completes the proof. •

Chapter 9
GEOMETRIC
PRE-QUANTIZATION
The aim of this chapter is a discussion about the geometric pre-quantization
of the k-symplectic manifolds. In order to fix the terminology used, we be-
gin by recalling some basic results of Cech cohomology, and complex bundle
lines.
For the proofs the reader is referred to Wallach [54] and Warner
[55]. We advise the reader to use the first and second sections for reference
purpose only.
9.1
The de Rham theorem
Let M be a paracompact connected smooth manifold. Recall that the p-th
de Rham cohomology group of M is the quotient of the vector space of closed
p-forms modulo the subspace of exact p-forms:
H~(M,lK)
ker (d: AP(M,lK) ~ AP+l(M,lK))
dAP-l(M, lK)
where lK = R or C, AP(M,K) is the set of lK-valued differential forms of
degree p on M,and p = 0,1,2, ... , A-l(M,lK) = {O} .
The de Rham theorem relates H~(M,lK) with HP(M,lK), where HP(M,lK)
is one of the usual cohomology groups on M, in our case we use the Cech
cohomology groups. We recall now the definition of the Cech cohomology
groups. Let 11 = (Ui)iEI be an open covering of M.
A collection (Uio, Uil' ... ,Uip) of members of the covering 11 such that

218
CHAPTER 9.
GEOMETRIC PRE-QUANTIZATION
is called a p-simplex. If a = (Uio, Ui1,.. . ,Uip) is a p-simplex, its support
lal is by definition
lal = Uio n Uil n ...n Uip.
Let G be an abelian Lie group written additively. A p-cochain on M with
values in G is a rule c which associates with each p-simplex (Uio' Uil" .. ,Uip)
of II an element
Let cP(ll, G) be the set of all p-cochains with values in G. We define a
structure of an abelian group on CP(ll, G) by taking
Let b be the mapping from cP(ll, G) into cP+I(ll, G) defined by
here the hat over an index means that this index is omitted. An immediate
consequence of the definition is that
Let HP(ll,G) be the quotient group
HP(ll G) = ker(b: cP(ll,G) ~ cP+I(ll, G))
,
8Cp-l(ll, G)
,
where p = 0,1,2, ... , and C-l(ll,G) = {O}.
Let II and l.U be two open coverings of M such that II refines l.U (l.U -< ll),
then there exists a mapping T : II ~ l.U such that T(ll) ~ ll, and for each
c E cP(ll, G) we define a mapping ~ from CP(l.U, G) into CP(ll, G) :
(r{f,c). . .
= Cr(iO),T(il),...,T(ip)·
~O,~l ,... ,~p
Thus we have
r{f, 08 = 80r{f"
consequently, ~ induces a mapping

9.1. THE DE RHAM THEOREM
219
The mapping ~ is independent of the choice of T (cf [36] for the proof of
this assertion).
Now let .1.1, m, m:t be open coverings of M such that m-< m:t -< .1.1. We have
We define HP(M, G) as follows. Consider the disjoint union of the groups
HP(.1.1, G) . Let u E HP(.1.1, G) and v E HP(m, G),then we say that
if there is an open covering m:t refining .1.1 and m( .1.1 -< m:t and m-< m:t ) such
that
TiW(v) = T~(U).
then, U rv V defines an equivalence relation. The set
HP(M,G) = limW(.1.1,G)
-.
of all equivalence classes is an abelian group with respect to the obvious
operations. This group is called the p-th Cech. cohomology group of M with
coefficients in G.
Definition 9.1 An open covering.1.1 = (Ui)iEI ofM is said to be contractible
if, wheneveril . . . ,ip E I and Uiln.. .nUip =f 0, the intersection Ui,n.. .nUip
i$ contractible
Recall that an open subset U of M is said to be contractible if the identity
mapping idu : U ---t U is homotopic to a constant mapping (that is, there
exists a smooth mapping c.p : [0,1] x U ---t U such that c.p(O,x) = x for all
x E U and c.p(0, x) =
XQ where Xo is a fixed point XQ of it.
Let 9 be a Riemannian metric on M and let .1.1 = (Ui)iEI be an open
covering of M. For all i E I and p E U, we consider a convex neighborhood
Up,i of p in U. Thus we obtain a contractible refinement
(Up,i)iEI, pEU;
of.1.1 = (Ui)iEI (for the definition and existence of convex neighborhoods, we
can see [34]).
Theorem 9.1 (Poincare's lemma). Let U be a contractible open of M.
Every closed p-form on U is exact.

220
CHAPTER 9. GEOMETRiC PRFrQUANTIZATION
Theorem 9.2 We have
1. The group HP(11,G) is isomorphic to HP(M,G) for every contmctible
covering 11 = (Ui)iEI of M.
2. (de Rham's theorem) HP(M,OC) is canonically isomorphic to ~(M,OC),
here G = OC is the additive group lR or C.
We have need of an explicit form of de Rham's theorem, hence we review
in details the isomorphism for p = 0,1,2. For a complete proof (every p) we
can refer to [58J.
Proof.
We give here the proof for p = 0,1,2.
Let II = (Ui)iEI be a
contractible covering of M.
Let c be a D-cochain (c E 00(11, OC)) such that 8c = O. We have:
(8c). . = Cio - Ci1 = O.
10,11
Thus if
Uio n Ui1 =I- 0 then Cio = Ci1; consequently, the O-cochain c defines
a constant on M. Therefore Hi>(11, OC) ~ OC. Now, if f is a smooth function
on M (that is, D-form on M) such that df = 0, then f is constant on M (M
is connected). Hence ~(M,OC) ~ K This proves the theorem for p = O.
Now consider p = 1. Let W be a closed OC-valued Pfaffian form on M.
Since U, is contractible for every i E I, then by Poincare's lemma there
exists a smooth function fi : U; ---+ OC such that for each i E I we have
WIU; =dk
Thus if u,n u, =I- 0 then we have
d(Ji-!i)=O
on u. no; Hence ·
(Ji - !i)lu;nuj = Ci,j E K
We have associated with W a 1-cochain c E C1(ll, OC) such that 8c =
O.
Considering now an other family gi : U, ---+ OC such that for each i E I we
have wjU; = dgi, thus
Set
then we have

THE DE RHAM THEOREM
221
Hence the equivalence class [c] of c in HI (11, lK) depends only on the closed
differential form w. It is clear that [c] = 0 ifw = df. Therefore, we have a
mapping
d.R : [w] .....-. [c]
from HJ (M, lK) into HI (ll, lK).
We now prove that this mapping is injective. Let w be a closed Pfaffian
form on M and let c be the corresponding l-cochain. If [c) = 0 then there
is b E CO(ll,lK) such that
Ci,j = 8bi,j = bi -
bj.
Let ~ = Ii -
bi. The restriction (~ - hj),uinuj of ~ - h j to U,n Uj is
zero. Let h be the smooth function on M defined by
hex) = ~(x)
for every x E Ui. We have dh = w, hence [w] = O. This proves that the
mapping d.R is injective.
We must show that the mapping d.R is surjective. Let c E C I (ll, lK)
with Sc = O. For a partition of unity (l{Ji)iEI subordinate to the covering
II = (Ui)iEI we consider
Ii = L
l{JiCi,j,
jEI(i)
where lei) = {j E I Iu; no, :f: 0} .
From Sc = 0 we have
(Ii - I; ),UinUj = Ci,j .
For every i E I we take Wi = dli . Then we have Wi is a lK-valued J-form on
o, and
(Wi - Wj)WinUj = dli - dl; = d (Ii - 1;) = o.
Thus there exists a lK-valued T-form won M, therefore
Now, following the above argument, we see that [c] is the image under this
mapping of [w] . This completes the proof in the case p = 1.
Suppose p = 2. Let w be a lK-valued differential form of degree 2 such
that dJJJ = O. By Poincare's lemma there exists for every i E I a Pfaffian
form ai such that

222
CHAPTER 9. GEOMETRIC PRE-QUANTIZATION
For o,n u, =J 0 we have
d (o, - Q:j)lu;nUj = Wlu;nuj - Wlu;nuj = 0,
hence there exists a smooth function lij : Ui n Uj ~ OC such that
Q:i -
Q:j = dlij .
Now suppose o,n Uj n U» =J 0. Then we have
d (lij - lik +!ik) = Q:i -
Q:j -
Q:i + Q:k + Q:j -
Q:k = O.
Let
Ci,j,k = (lij - lik +!ik)lu;nujnUk .
We have Ci,j,k ElK. It is clear that e E C2(11,OC) and be = O.
Arguing as in the case p = 1, we see that the association W t---t [c) is well
defined and induces a mapping from Hl(M,OC) into H2(11,OC).
Let W be a closed OC-valued 2-form on M such that the corresponding
2-cochain c E C2(11, OC) satisfies c = db; we must show that W is an exact 2-
form on M. In the previous notations let lij : U,nUj ~ OC be the mapping
defined by
We have
lij -T« +Ijk = 0
on UinUjnUk. Let (lpi)iEI be a partition of unity subordinate to the covering
11 = (Ui)iEI' and let
Ii = 2: lpjlij,
jEI(i)
where I(i) = {j E I Io,n Uj =J 0}. It is not difficult to see that we have
(Ii -!i)lu;nuj = lijO
Let
On U,n Uj, we have
consequently there exists a OC-valued Pfaffian form a defined on M such
that the restriction of a to Ut coincides with ai (for every i E I):

9.2. LINE BUNDLE
223
It is clear that we have W = 00, thus the mapping [w] 1----4 [c] from HJ(M,lK)
into H 2(ll, lK) is injective. To complete the proof in the case p = 2 we must
show that this mapping is surjective. Let c E 0 1(ll, lK) with Dc = O. We
show that there exists a closed lK-valued two form won M,thus:
2. (o, - aj)lu,nUj = dfij;
3. fij - fik + /jk = Ci,j,k' on U,n U, n U».
Let (<Pi)iEI be a partition of unity subordinate to the covering II = (Ui)iEI
and let fij : Ui n Uj ----t lK be the mapping defined by
fij = L (<Pk)lu,nujnuk Ci,j,k'
kEI
Let
ai = L <Pj (dfij),u,nuj
jEI
and
for every i E I. Then we have
(Wi - Wj)lu,nuj = O.
Thus there exists a lK-valued differential form won M of degree 2 such that
for all i E I. It is clear that the corresponding element to W under this
mapping is [c].
This completes the proof in the case p = 2 and we have
shown both parts of this theorem for p = 0,1,2.•
9.2
Line bundle
Definition 9.2 A line bundle is a triplet (L,p, M), where E and Mare
smooth manifolds and p : E
----t M is a smooth mapping satisfying the
following conditions:
1. For every x E M, the fibre Lx = p-l(x) over x is a complex vector
space of dimension 1;

224
CHAPTER 9.
GEOMETRIC PRE-QUANTIZATION
2. There exists an open covering (Ui)iEI of M and a family of diJJeomor-
phisms
'Pi : p-l(Ui) --+ U; x C
such that, for every x E U; and y E Lx we have:
and
is C-linear.
Proposition 9.1 Let (L,p, M) be a line bundle and let U = (Ui)iEI be a
contractible covering of M.
Then there exists a family of diJJeomorphisms
'Pi : p-l(Ui) --+ U, X C such that for every x E U, and y E Lx we have
and
is C-linear. Let i,j E I be such that U, n Uj =1= 0 then the mapping
satisfies
'Pi 0 'Pjl(x, z) = (X,gij(X)(Z))
for all x E Ui n Uj and Z E C. Therefore
gij : U, n Uj --+ C- {O}
is Coo.
The mappings gij satisfy the condition
gijgjk = gik
(9.1)
Remark 14 Observe that condition 9.1 is 8g = 0 written multiplicatively.

9.3. CONNECTIONS
But Ut n Uj is contractible, thus there is a smooth mapping
~j : U, n U, --+ C,
such that
225
9ij =
exp(2i7T~j).
The relation 9.1 implies that the mappings ~j satisfy
~j + hj k - hik == q,j ,k E Z
for all x E o,no,n Uk and i, i. k E I.
It is clear that e E C2(U,Z) and 8c = O.
The class of e in H 2(U, Z) is independent of the choices made in its
definition, the class of c is denoted by K(L) and is called the characteristic
(or Chern) class of L. The following properties are equivalent:
1. (L,p, M) is trivial (that is, isomorphic with M x C);
2. K(L) = O.
Let e E C2(U,Z) and lie = 0, then c E C2(U, lK) where lK = R or C with
lie = O. If c = lib with bE Ck- 1(U,Z) then b E Ck-l(U,Z). Thus we have a
mapping
where lK = R or C.
Let ~ E i (H2 (M, lK)) where lK = R or C. We say that c is integral if
c E i (H2 (M,Z)).
Let 0 E A2(M, K) be a lK-valued differential form of degree 2 on M. We
say that 0 is integral if, the image of [0] by the de Rham isomorphism, is
integral.
9.3
Connections
A cross-section of a line bundle (L,p,M) over M is a smooth mapping
a: M --+ L such that po a = idM.
We denote by I'(L) the space of all cross-sections of the line bundle
(L,p,M).
A connection on L is a C-bilinear pairing for each x EM,
(Xx,a) 1---+ '\lx:z;a
ofTxM with I'(L) into the fibre Lx such that

I E COO(M,C)j
2. For all X E X(M) , I E COO(M,C) and a E I'(L), the association
defines a smooth mapping from Minto I'(L), here COO(M,C) denotes
the set of all smooth mappings from Minto C.
Proposition 9.2 Each line bundle admits a connection.
Proof. Let (L,p, M) be a line bundle over M and let it = (Ui)iEI be an
open covering on M and (<Pi)iEI be the family of diffeomorphisms
<Pi : p-l(Ui) ~ U, xC
such that for every x E U, and y E Lx we have

is C-linear. For each i E I we take
for every x E Ui. Let a E I'(L) we have
for every x E Ui, where hi : U, ~ C is a smooth mapping.
For each i E I we take
for all x E U, and Xx E TxM. Let (fh)iEI be a partition of unity subordinate
to the covering it. Define
\lx;o = ~ Oi(X) \l~:z: a

for all Xx E TM and a E I'(L).
It is not difficult to see that \l defines a connection on L. •

on U,n Uj . This proves that there exists a C-valued differential form w of
degree 2 on M whose the restriction to U, coincides with dOi
for every i E I .
Proposition 9.3 The 2-form w is independent of all choices used to define
it and we have:
w(X,Y)a = '\Ix '\IY a - '\IY '\Ix a - '\I[X,Yja
for all a E I'(L) and X, Y E X(M) .
Proof. It is clearly enough to prove the formula in the statement of the
proposition. First we have:
('\Ix '\IY - '\IY '\Ix - '\I[X,Yj) (fa) = f ('\Ix '\IY a - '\IY '\Ix a - '\I[X,YJa)
(9.3)
for every smooth mapping f : M -t C. Hence it is enough to prove the
formula for a = ai on Ui -
'\Ix '\IY ai
- '\IY '\Ixoi - '\I[X,Yjai
= '\Ix (Oi(Y)ai) - '\IY (Oi(X)ai) - Oi ([X, YJ)a;
= X (Oi(Y)) ai +Oi(Y)Oi(X)ai - Y (Oi(X)) ai - Oi(X)Oi(Y)ai
-Oi ([X ,YJ)ai
= (X (Oi(Y)) - Y (Oi(X)) - Oi ([X, Y]))ai.
The proposition results from the property
dO(X, Y) = X (O(Y)) - Y (O(X)) - 0 ([X, YJ)
for any C-valued differential one form 0 and X ,Y E X(M).•
Definition 9.3 The two form w is calledthe curvature of L associated with
'\I and denoted by curv(L, '\I).

It is clear that we have
d (curv(L,'V)) = O.

L is a correspondence x

product on Lx such that for any a E L the mapping

A Hermitian line bundle is a pair (L, (,)) consisting of a line bundle and
a Hermitian structure on L.
Definition 9.5 Let L be a line bundle over M endowed with a connection

Furthermore, if H 1(M,Z) is trivial then M admits a \I-invariant Hermitian

Let L* = {l E L Il # O} .
Proposition 9.7 Let (L,p, M) be a line bundle equipped with a connection
