Kotlin programming language
Kotlin is a modern, cross-platform, multi-purpose programming language. JetBrains
started the design and development of the language back in 2010 and has watched it
rapidly grow in popularity. Known for its concise syntax and pragmatic design, Kotlin
provides ample opportunity for sharing and reusing code between multiple projects and
platforms.
The potential for the language is immense. Programmers are using Kotlin for mobile —
both Android and iOS, server-side and client-side web applications, and data science.
With Kotlin/Native, the support extends to other platforms like embedded systems and
macOS. Kotlin has functional constructs. It supports both object-oriented and functional
programming styles — or a mix of the two together. This is why the developer community
has truly embraced Kotlin. In 2020, Stack Overflow reported Kotlin as being the fourth
most-loved language among professional programmers and the 13th most popular
language overall.
It has had an exciting journey.  In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, and by
February 2012 the project had been made open-source under the Apache Licence,
version 2.0. 2016 saw the release of Kotlin 1.0, the language gained traction and
continued to amaze tech giants and developers alike. In 2017, Google announced that it
would officially support Kotlin as a first-class language for mobile development on
Android. By 2018, the language had already reached over 1.5 million users, with over
96,000 repositories containing Kotlin code on Github. Today, more than 4 million
programmers use Kotlin all over the world, with more than 1 million developers, every
month, using the language in their professional work.
