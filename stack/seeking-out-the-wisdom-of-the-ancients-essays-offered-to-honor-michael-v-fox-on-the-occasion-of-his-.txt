Michael V. Fox: 
A Tribute
In planning this Festschrift we were warned of the perils: wooing tardy sub-
missions from contributors’ hands, the tedium of conforming all essays to a
style sheet, and the mass of letters and e-mails necessary to coordinate the
work. Happily, the burden has not been as onerous as forecasted, thanks
largely to the contributors, whose cooperation and collegiality made the task
enjoyable, and thanks to the always ready assistance of Jim Eisenbraun.
In truth, the most daunting part of the project was this essay. How do you
offer a tribute for someone who would just as soon quietly take his place
among the academy’s cadre of senior scholars? This problem has been largely
solved by the 30 scholars whose articles published here attest Michael’s inﬂu-
ence and standing in academe. Their quick acceptance of invitations to write
essays for this volume is itself a tribute to Michael.
Most readers already know Michael’s reputation for careful reading of He-
brew texts, his mastery of secondary sources, and his control of English prose.
We, representing all his students, wish to provide a tribute to him from within
the halls and classrooms of the Department of Hebrew and Semitic Studies at
the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
Like all scholars renowned for sharing their expertise in writing, Michael can
readily be found at his computer keyboard. The care and sensitivity with which
he reads the Hebrew text is apparent; less obvious is the labor he puts into the
clear and effective prose that, for the reader, has an air of effortlessness. One of
us, having vetted an early draft of an article Michael wrote on hebel in Qo-
heleth, was taken aback when it was published two years later (“The Meaning
of Hebel for Qohelet,” JBL 105 [1986] 409–27); the article was barely recog-
nizable as a successor to that early draft. His already excellent essay had gone
through repeated revisions and was now ﬁtted with a new frame that appropri-
ately contextualized his arguments, which had also undergone reﬁnement.
Thankfully, Michael did not keep his belief in rigorous revision to himself;
he also inﬂicted it on us. Likely all his students would agree that he taught us
to believe in the dictum that clear verbal expression is the prerequisite for clear
thinking. His demand for precision and uncluttered writing had the effect of
helping us formulate clearly the problems encountered in research, as well as
our proposed solutions. However, this was but one instance of his application
to us of the demands he places on himself.

x
A feature of the graduate program in Hebrew and Semitic Studies at the
University of Wisconsin–Madison that Michael has consistently ranked essen-
tial is mastery of Classical Hebrew. He expects students to attain the same
grasp of morphology, syntax, and ﬂuency in oral reading that he commands.
He did not conceal his frustration when one of us was unable to parse or pro-
duce a Hebrew form on demand, and we all dreaded his sighs as he endured
our sometimes stumbling oral reading of the Hebrew text. But equally appar-
ent was his exasperation with himself when he placed an errantly conjugated
Syriac verb on an exam for parsing. As much as we were aware of his displea-
sure with our errors, we were equally aware of his expectations of himself.
In fact, what remains most amazing to us is that, even though he had de-
veloped skills far beyond our immediate grasp, he took seriously our proposed
solutions to problems in the text, testing them for validity and copying into his
own notes suggestions that passed his scrutiny. He never revealed a need to
prove his conclusions unassailable or to show himself superior. And he never
gave us the feeling that time in class was a distraction from his research; he was
always engaged, seeming to regard class as an opportunity to study the text
with others who could offer valid insights.
It should come as no surprise, then, that his ﬁrst response to news that we
were planning this project was to ask whether those who had ﬁnished the
Ph.D. with him would be invited to contribute essays. And so nine of the es-
says included here, as well as the detailed bibliography, were written by grad-
uates of this department.
Strikingly, Michael’s own research agenda did not determine the path of our
education. While Job is one of the biblical books studied as part of a three-year
cycle in our program, the topic of wisdom literature did not loom large in his
classes generally. Indeed, it was not until students appealed to him to incorpo-
rate more of his research into course work that he substituted a semester of
Proverbs for one of the two semesters previously devoted to Job. Not only
that, but among courses Michael offers on regular rotation are year-long book
studies in Isaiah and Ezekiel, as well as graduate seminars on pentateuchal criti-
cism and the Dead Sea Scrolls, and he regularly incorporates forays into textual
criticism and study of the ancient versions into his courses. While these are
certainly areas of interest to him, his main purpose in integrating them into the
curriculum has been to give students exposure to the breadth of our discipline.
The revelation of how much a Mensch Michael is comes to most students
when they innocently click the link marked “photo” at the top of Michael’s
CV on the Hebrew and Semitic Studies Web site. They are startled to ﬁnd
themselves faced with the surly visage of Hulk Hogan, teeth bared and hold-
ing open his vest to expose a rippling pectoral. Michael’s “inner scholar” is
surely well represented in that photo.

Alas, for this book we have had to use a tamer portrait. However, the effect
remains the same, as can be measured by the number and range of essays we
dedicate to him on the occasion of his 65th birthday, with gratitude for his
contributions to scholarship and in anticipation of the beneﬁts that his current
and future endeavors will bring.
We could think of no ancient text that better expresses Michael’s career
than the one from which we derived the title for this volume, Ben Sirach
39:1–3 (nrsv):
He seeks out the wisdom of all the ancients,
and is concerned with prophecies;
he preserves the sayings of the famous
and penetrates the subtleties of parables;
he seeks out the hidden meanings of proverbs
and is at home with the obscurities of parables.

The Publications of Michael V. Fox:
Overview and Bibliography
Lawrence J. Mykytiuk
Purdue University
The subtle achievement of the published works written by Professor Fox is
that they are well focused without being narrowly restricted. Except for re-
views, the majority of his writings relate either to Egyptian literature (mainly
wisdom and love songs) or to one or another of ﬁve biblical books. All of his
ﬁrst book and fully half of his second (both 1985) are devoted to Egyptian love
songs, providing translations, philological notes, and hieroglyphic transcrip-
tions that include much previously unavailable material. Equally signiﬁcant is
his treatment of Egyptian wisdom literature, chieﬂy in journal articles. His ad-
vances in both areas of research succeed in improving our understanding of
the ancient “culture of the Nile” and in providing in-depth background for
the study of particular biblical writings.
Professor Fox’s books on biblical literature fall into a three-phase progres-
sion. The initial phase includes Qohelet, viewed in the light of ancient Near
Eastern wisdom, and the Song of Songs compared with Egyptian love songs. If
we classify his two chapter-length commentaries on those biblical books (1986)
as short monographs and group them with his dissertation (1972)1 and the two
books published in 1985 and the one in 1987 (see below under “books”), the
biblical focus of his ﬁrst six major works is Qohelet and Song of Songs. It is in
this phase that his work on Egyptian parallels serves as a discernible base for his
comments on the Hebrew literature.
The second phase begins with two books on Esther in 1991 and a rereading
of Qohelet in 1999. Although interrupted by the ﬁrst volume of his commen-
tary on Proverbs (2000), it continues with a further treatment of Esther (2001)
and a Jewish Publication Society popular commentary on Qohelet (2004).
The third, and current, phase of his work, begun with his ﬁrst volume on
Proverbs, includes the second volume of his commentary plus a text-critical

edition of Proverbs and two volumes on Job: a commentary for the Old Tes-
tament Library and a parallel, more technical, book of philological-textual an-
notations for Beihefte zur Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft.
Professor Fox’s articles and essays also display the progression of his think-
ing on issues that have occupied him. From his earliest articles, his insights into
text criticism, interpretation, poetry, proverbial sayings, rhetoric, character
portrayal, religion, and wisdom literature have steadily matured in preparation
for the steep ascent to the Everest heights of the book of Job.
Professor Fox’s rethinking of his previously published scholarship on biblical
works, done most conspicuously with Qohelet and Esther, deserves special
comment. After thirteen years of arduous labor to ﬁnish his monumental com-
mentary on Ezekiel, Walther Zimmerli commented, “it would be dishonest of
the author if he were silent about the feeling with which he comes to the
end—a feeling that he is now ready to begin the work with some understand-
ing.” He even added, “there is still much new work that needs to be done.”2
It is axiomatic that great literary works, not least the collection in the Hebrew
Bible, reward reexamination and invite an occasionally bewildering variety of
interpretations. Revisiting books of the Bible at length when one has already
treated them in earlier monographs demands more of the author than at ﬁrst
(no rehashes here!) and can foster perceptions having greater depth and reﬁne-
ment. Thoroughly grounded rereading that includes such “new work” as Zim-
merli mentioned is an advantage that Professor Michael V. Fox has pressed as
he leads readers into the riches of biblical wisdom literature and the delights of
three of the Megillot.3

ters 1–24 (ed. Frank Moore Cross and Klaus Baltzer; trans. Ronald E. Clements; 2 vols.;
Hermeneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979) xiii.
3. Notably, Professor Fox’s 1972 dissertation was only the beginning of his work with
the book of Qohelet. In the course of time, he distanced himself from his early approach,
and his ﬁrst monograph on Qohelet was a fresh study. His work on this book of the Bible
thus far totals four book-length treatments (one during each of four consecutive decades)
and thirteen articles (including eleven from 1986 onward). Thus far, his articles and essays
on Song of Songs/Egyptian love songs, on wisdom, and on Proverbs also number approxi-
mately a dozen each, along with ﬁve on Esther. Of course, there are many more besides.

Observations on Ezekiel as a Book Prophet
Menahem Haran
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
I. Ezekiel as a Writing Prophet
From the outset of critical research of the book of Ezekiel, many scholars re-
ferred to Ezekiel as a book prophet, that is, a prophet who manifested himself
only in writing.1 At ﬁrst, this deﬁnition was accompanied by an acceptance of
the book as a literary unity, totally belonging to Ezekiel. Abraham Kuenen, for
instance, asserted that “there are no reasons compelling us to assume that the
book of Ezekiel’s prophecies were edited by someone other than himself.”2 It
was Johannes Herrmann, and especially Gustav Hölscher, who perceived Eze-
kiel as one of the First Temple prophets, as a speaker, preacher, and poet. But
this perception led them to break up the book into a pile of fragments and to
claim (as Hölscher did) that a distinction should be made between the historical
Ezekiel and the book that bears his name.3 My own conviction is that Ezekiel
indeed has the distinctive characteristics of a book prophet, but the literary ma-
terial incorporated in the book represents the writings of only one personality,
in addition to which one can also discern marks of an editor who was not the
prophet himself. I will suggest some observations regarding Ezekiel as a book
prophet, without intending to exhaust the subject in this discussion.
The qualiﬁcation of Ezekiel as a prophetic writer can be proved, among
other things, by the number of literary units in his book that are presented to
us in a form that had no previous oral existence. These units are, especially,
1. Deﬁning Ezekiel as a book prophet was put forward as early as 1847 by Ferdinand
Hitzig in his commentary on Ezekiel (Der Prophet Ezechiel erklärt [KeHAT 8; Leipzig: Weid-
mann, 1847]).
2. Abraham Kuenen, Historisch-kritische Einleitung in die Bücher des alten Testament (2 vols.;
Leipzig: Schulze, 1892) 2:293.
3. Johannes Herrmann, Ezechielstudien (BWAT 2; Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1908); idem, Eze-
chiel, übersetzt und erklärt (KAT 11; Leipzig: Deichart, 1924); Gustav Hölscher, Hesekiel,
der Dichter und das Buch (BZAW 39; Giessen: Alfred Töpelmann, 1924).
Author’s note: It gives me pleasure to dedicate these observations to Michael, who was a
bright student and is now a noted and creative scholar as well as a real friend.

Menahem Haran

Ezekiel’s call (1:1–3:15), with its cosmographical speculations and the details
of the Divine Chariot described in it, which in their present form were cer-
tainly not meant to be heard; the literary unit succeeding the call (3:16–5:4),
in which ceremonial acts performed by the prophet are described, headed by
the command to shut himself up in his home and not go out among the
people (3:24–25); the prophecy about Gog (chaps. 38–39), describing his as-
sault “in the latter years” at the head of hordes from the remotest north on
“the people who were gathered from the nations,” which ends in his calamity
on the hills of Israel and is a bookish formation with its inquisitive erudition;
the law code comprising chaps. 40–48, where it is unimaginable that any part
of it was ever delivered by the prophet as a live speech—not the detailed geo-
metric contour of the visionary temple or the meticulous ritual regulations or
the division of the land west of the Jordan into imaginary, widthwise strips.4
The series of visions in 8:1–11:25 and the vision of the dry bones in 37:1–14,
which are products of the imagination and have nothing to do with the public,
also belong here (on 11:25, see below, §III). In all of these prophecies, Ezek-
iel, in reality or in his fantasy, is alone, with no one seeing him or his where-
abouts; nor does he speak with human beings. Among the symbolic actions
described in the unit 3:16–5:4, there are some that Ezekiel could apparently
perform in front of an audience. But because he performs them all while being
shut up in his home, he does them for himself, and furthermore, he does not
speak. The discourse between him and the Lord in this unit (4:14–15), as well
as in the vision of the dry bones (37:3), is not contradictory with this situation,
and the same is true for the prophecy that he utters to the spirit (37:9–10),
which also takes place in his imagination. At the beginning of the law code of
chaps. 40–48, the “man” from the heavenly entourage tells him to “report
(dgh) everything you see to the House of Israel” (40:4); the meaning is appar-
ently that he should notify them by means of writing in the book. This is
stated explicitly farther on: “report (dgh) the temple to the House of Israel . . .
make known to them the plan of the temple and its layout, its exits and en-
trances . . . and write it down before their eyes” (43:10–11).5 The code of
chaps. 40–48, as well as the prophecy concerning Gog, should by no means
be separated from Ezekiel’s literary possession. These too are essentially similar
4. On chaps. 40–48 as a literary composition that was not preceded by any live rhetoric,
see Menahem Haran, “The Law Code of Ezekiel XL–XLVIII and Its Relation to the
Priestly School,” HUCA 50 (1979) 46–53.
5. These two verses have been somewhat distorted, but the wording presented above
appears in the LXX. The waw of trwxw was omitted due to haplography with wc[ preced-
ing it. The waw of btkw is waw explicativum (GKC §154a, n. 1 [b]), that is, by writing before
them you will inform them, as they shall be able to see what was written.

to his prophecies, their exceptional character being the result of their unusual
subjects.
All the acts described in section 4:1–17 symbolize the siege of Jerusalem,
and they are performed one alongside the other, one inside the other, so that
all of them combine into a uniﬁed action. The association of the various acts
into one symbol was not agreeable to moderns, who, searching for total unity,
professed that there are different strata and expansions in this section and
attempted to reconstruct a shorter original version than the one before us but
in vain. Following are the symbolic acts described in this section: (1) The
prophet engraves the shape of a city, Jerusalem, upon a brick, and places an
iron plate between himself and the brick, thus symbolizing siege (vv. 1–3).
The siege continues until all the succeeding acts are completed. (2) He lies on
his left side and “bear(s) the punishment” of Israel 390 (the LXX: 190) days,
and then lies on his right side for 40 days and “bear(s) the punishment” of Ju-
dah, “one day for each year” (vv. 4–6; compare Num 14:34). Thus the reader
is informed how long the presentation of the siege lasted. All this time, the
prophet faces Jerusalem, his arm is bare (4:7), and he is bound in cords so as
not to turn over from side to side:6 “until you have completed the days of your
siege(s)” (v. 8), that is, according to the number of days allotted to each of the
kingdoms.7 (3) During this entire time, he eats poor bread in which vegetables
are mixed with wheat and barley (Rashi and Qim˙i: due to the hunger) and
drinks water by measure, while both the bread and the water are rationed in
small quantities. In addition, he must eat a barley cake that was (previously)
baked on human dung, though on this point God leniently allows him to use
cattle dung (vv. 9–17).8 In the following section (5:1–4) the fourth act is
6. The purpose of the cords mentioned in connection with the lying down is: “so that
you cannot turn from one side to another” (4:8). The different purposes convey different
uses, and the two should not be confused.
7. The number of days (390 or 190 for Israel; 40 for Judah) is a riddle that has not
been solved. Some scholars, among them Walther Zimmerli (Ezechiel [2nd ed.; BKAT 13;
Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1979] 18, 163–68), referring to v. 9 which only
mentions 390 days, claim that the 40 days allotted to Judah is an addition to an addition
(which is lying on the left side). However, one can argue with the same degree of certainty
that the 40 days were omitted there. Verse 8 reads: “until you complete the days of your
sieges (Úr,Wxm}).” The last word, being plural, implies “(two) sieges.” The reasoning put for-
ward above serves to reject the notion that the number of days is not an original part of the
text. The purpose of the “cords” mentioned as part of the conﬁnement is: “so that you can-
not go out among them” (3:25).
8. Verse 13: “Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean (amf).” The word
amf here means “unclean,” “loathsome” (see Rashi), not “deﬁled,” because, from the ritual
standpoint, preparing bread on coals of human dung does not cause impurity; compare

mentioned: he shaves his head and beard, dividing the hair into three equal
parts. One part he burns “in the ﬁre inside the city when the days of the siege
are completed” (these are the days that were mentioned in 4:5–6); one part
he must “strike with the sword all around the city”; and one part he scatters
to the wind. In addition, he takes a small number of the hairs and binds them
into the skirts (the LXX: skirt) of his robe, and from this small number there
are some more that are burned in ﬁre (v. 4).
All these acts are extremely peculiar, but most of them cannot be consid-
ered unfeasible in actuality. The only one that the prophet could not conceiv-
ably have performed is lying on his left side for 390 straight days or even only
190 according to the LXX, and then an additional 40 on his right side.9 It is
not surprising that many scholars claimed that the issue of lying on his right
and left sides was a gloss (or a gloss upon a gloss), while the use of the ﬁrst-
person form in the text, not to mention the ﬂuency of the passage, did not dis-
turb them. The assumption is that, if the prophet could not perform that act,
he also could not write it, and therefore the inconceivable must be attributed
9. See G. A. Cooke: “It is incredible that any man could lie prostrate on one side for such
a length of time and retain his senses” (A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Book of
Ezekiel [ICC; Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1936] 53). Georg Fohrer claims that “maybe one
should think of an ecstatic state” when considering the act of lying on both sides and sug-
gests that, because it is an act that can only be performed for a limited while, the prophet
received “only the call to act, and began to perform it” (Ezechiel [HAT 13; Tübingen: Mohr,
1955] 30). Fohrer was compelled to leave at least some of the act as having been performed,
because according to his view, the symbolic acts of prophets were intended to “generate cu-
riosity, attract attention and in this way reach the uninterested as well” (Die symbolischen
Handlungen der Propheten [2nd ed.; ATANT 54; Zurich: Zwingli, 1968] 91). But the text be-
fore us does not mention an initiation of the act, and Fohrer’s deﬁnition of symbolic acts
does not accord with performing them at home, behind closed doors, as Ezekiel did. See
also Ellen Davis’s objection to Fohrer’s view (Swallowing the Scroll: Textuality and the Dynam-
ics of Discourse in Ezekiel’s Prophecy [ JSOTSup 78; Shefﬁeld: Almond, 1989] 68). Maimon-
ides (Guide to the Perplexed, part 2, chap. 46) opined that Ezekiel’s lying on his side was one
of the acts performed “in prophetic vision.”
Luzatto’s note on v. 13 in his Hebrew Commentary on Jeremiah and Ezekiel (orig. 1876; Je-
rusalem: Maqor, 1969). The sentence “among the nations to which I will drive them”
(4:13) was displaced from the end of the chapter (as I will try to prove elsewhere). The rea-
son for eating in loathsome conditions is not the exile but the siege. In v. 14, the prophet
cries out that he has never deﬁled himself with hlbn (the corpse of an animal that died of
itself ), or hprf (that which is torn by beasts), nor did meat of lwgp (that which has been
kept for three days and become corrupt [see Lev 7:18; 19:7; Isa 65:4]) ever come into his
mouth. The issue is not that the barley cake belongs to one of these three impurities but
that Ezekiel, being a priest, was strictly observant of the laws of purity, and he does not de-
serve to be humiliated by eating loathsome food.

to someone else who, allegedly, was capable of telling it, and in the name of
Ezekiel only. However, the lying on his left and right sides is said to have been
performed, as the text explicitly states, when the prophet was conﬁned, alone,
within his home. From this aspect, there is no difference between these acts of
lying on his side and the other symbolic acts that he is supposed to have per-
formed at the same time and place. These are all parts of one and the same the-
atrical performance, all of which exist in the book in their present form, and
the book is their place. In other words, if this set of actions was performed be-
hind closed doors, with no one but the prophet as a witness, it is not so im-
portant how it was done, whether in reality or in the imagination. Moreover,
we are not told when it took place, whether before the destruction of Jerusa-
lem, or as a burdensome echo in the prophet’s memory when he put his
prophecies in writing after the destruction. The assumption underlying my
method in interpreting the book of Ezekiel is that the intense psychological
tremors that stirred this prophet concerning the fate of Jerusalem following its
destruction should not be doubted, but his writings were put down in retro-
spect, not a few years after the destruction, and their verbal garb became a
kind of self-sustaining literary work.10
As I mentioned, when experiencing prophetic visions, Ezekiel is alone. He
is also alone whenever the “word” of God comes to him, and in this respect
he belongs to the category of classical prophets, whose connection with the
Divinity was certainly a personal experience. Yet, despite this similarity, Ezek-
iel’s status is still unique. The visions seen by the prophets of the First Temple
period are often intertwined within the reality in which they are living (com-
pare Amos 7:1–2, 4; 8:2; 9:1; Isa 6:1; Jer 1:11; 24:1). This is not the case with
Ezekiel, whom the hand of the Lord throws far away from his place, whether
to the courtyards of the Jerusalem Temple or to the temple of his utopian vi-
sion or to fantastic sights that are not of this world. He is completely detached
from his surroundings for the duration of these visions.11 Acts of “insanity,”
10. This method will be presented in detail in the third part of my work, The Biblical
Collection [Hebrew], to be published before long.
11. To be sure, Michaiah ben Imlah also saw the Lord “sitting on his throne, with all the
host of heaven standing beside him to the right and to the left of him” (1 Kgs 22:19), and
the throne also appears in the visions of Ezekiel (Ezek 1:26) and Isaiah (Isa 6:1), as well as in
metaphors that have a traditional element (cf. Zimmerli, Ezechiel, 18–21). But Ezekiel’s
visions contain cosmological elements as well, which are apparently taken from the Mesopo-
tamian sphere; concerning these elements, which are realized in drawings, and some may be
connected to what is described in chaps. 1 and 10 of Ezekiel; see Othmar Keel, Jahwe-Visionen
und Siegelkunst: Eine neue Deutung der Majestätsschilderungen in Jes 6, Ez 1 und 10 und Sach 4

whose entire existence is only as part of the story, can indeed be found in the
prophetic miracle stories. Ezekiel’s report about lying on his right and left sides
(as well as the other acts mentioned in the same context) is also a miraculous
happening. However, Ezekiel is unique among the prophets in this respect as
well. The prophetic miracle stories are told in the third person, as the literary
genre requires. Ezekiel speaks in the ﬁrst person telling what he did when he
was conﬁned within his home. On the face of it, this report resembles chaps.
1 and 3 of Hosea, which describe in ﬁrst person the prophet’s marrying adul-
terous women. But, as amazing as it may seem that a man should take for him-
self “a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom” (Hos 1:2), it is not
entirely inconceivable. This is not the case with Ezekiel’s acts of lying on his
sides, which—leading as they do to the other acts mentioned in the same con-
text—together symbolize the siege of Jerusalem. The sequence of these sym-
bols is, as said, a book work.
The eating of the scroll in Ezekiel’s call prophecy (2:8–3:3) is very close in
its characteristics to the previously mentioned sequence of symbols and, like
this sequence, is unrealistic. After the Lord pre-warned him to eat what he was
given, he sees “a hand stretched out” toward him holding a written scroll. The
scroll is opened, and he sees “words of lamentation and mourning and woe”
inscribed on both sides of the papyrus, just as the majority of Ezekiel’s prophe-
cies are going to be those of mass destruction. Upon eating, he senses the taste
of the scroll as though it were “sweet as honey.” This is an imaginary experi-
ence and Ezekiel, for whom the distinction between real and imaginary is of-
ten nonexistent, could easily have been attracted to it. Though we are entitled
to believe that he in fact experienced what is described, the actual act of eating
could not exist outside of his imagination, in objective reality. At the same
time, the eating of the scroll is an extremely appropriate way of expressing
Ezekiel’s character as a book prophet. Jeremiah “eats” the words told him by
the Lord and proclaims: “Your words were found and I ate them (compare
Ezek 3:1: “eat what is offered to you,” although this does not appear in the
LXX), and your words (Qere: word) became to me a joy and the delight of my
heart” ( Jer 15:16). Jeremiah is “a man of words” (compare Exod 4:10; also
Deut 18:18, Jer 1:9), although his prophecies are eventually written as a book
Susanne Müller Trufaut, “Ezekiel 1, Babylonian Cosmological Scholarship and Iconogra-
phy: Attempts at Further Reﬁnement,” TZ 57 [2001] 140–71). On the other hand, Jere-
miah felt the touch of the Lord’s hand on his mouth ( Jer 1:9), at which time he was
necessarily detached from his surroundings. Nonetheless, Ezekiel’s uniqueness is also ex-
pressed by the intensity of the visions he experiences. We have not heard of anyone other
than him who needed to sit “stunned” for seven days after the prophetic vision left him, in
order to sober up and return to his daily schedule (Ezek 3:15).

( Jer 36:5–8, 27–32). Ezekiel “eats” the actual scroll on which his prophecy is
written; he ﬁlls his stomach with this scroll (Ezek 3:3), because his prophecy
is communicated through the book.12 On the scroll, which he eats, the es-
sence of his prophecies is already written, because this report was written only
at a late stage, with a distant perspective that was also seasoned with prophetic
imagination.
II. The Book of Ezekiel as Essentially a Literary Work
Ezekiel’s character as a book prophet is conﬁrmed by features of his proph-
ecies that should only be interpreted as expressions of an essentially literary
work. These features supplement the prophecies mentioned above, which had
no previous oral existence. Thus, if one claims that these prophecies only
speak for themselves, the following features will broaden his or her conclu-
sions. Ezekiel’s manner of setting his face toward the place or the people about
whom he is prophesying, which occurs frequently and follows the order of
“the word of the Lord,” is an essentially bookish characteristic. This setting of
his face is apparently borrowed from what we are told about Balaam, who
needed to see Israel when he was about to curse them (Num 22:41, 23:13,
24:2), though because of Divine intervention the curse was turned into a
blessing. Ezekiel looks and then prophesies toward the mountains of Israel
(6:2), the false prophetesses (13:17),13 the southern forest (21:2[20:46]) which
is interpreted as Jerusalem (21:7[2]), the Ammonites (25:2), Sidon (28:21),
Pharaoh (29:2), Mount Seir (35:2), and Gog (38:2). There are nine occur-
rences of this kind, which is corroborative evidence for the literary unity of
distant chapters. There is, however, a crucial difference between Balaam and
12. This point was also emphasized by Davis, that Ezekiel’s prophecy was expressed in
writing, which served as his basic mode of work (Swallowing the Scroll, 27, 50, 54). But
Davis’s view is quite different from my own. According to her assumption, the writing was
a basis for the live speech that followed it (see especially pp. 24–28, 56–58). In my view,
the live speech should have preceded the written text, and because we do not know the
content of that speech, we can only guess at it.
13. Formally, chap. 13 is a continuous unit, the last section of which, vv. 17–23, ad-
dresses the prophetesses. Verse 17 is not the opening of a new unit. Johannes Lindblom
considers chap. 13 to be one of the examples of what he calls a “ﬁctitious speech,” because
“we can hardly imagine that Ezekiel once assembled all the false prophets of Israel and
prophesied doom against them” (Prophecy in Ancient Israel [Oxford: Blackwell, 1962] 153).
In his view, such “speeches” are prevalent with Ezekiel. The appellation “ﬁctitious speech”
is certainly appropriate, though not because of Lindblom’s reasons, because he believes that
the “ﬁctitious speeches” were also delivered in public, “not in their present form, but in
another way” (p. 154). He does not explain what this different way might have been.

Ezekiel regarding this matter. Balaam’s curses, transformed into blessings, are
a type of witchcraft and are connected with his act of looking at the camp of
Israel. He is taken to hills from which he can see the people (Num 22:41;
23:14, 28), and Balak changes his point of observation each time, in order to
achieve the “proper” effect. Ezekiel’s turning of face is merely a literary cliché,
for he is said to have turned his face in cases that could not have happened in
reality, such as turning toward the false prophetesses or Pharaoh or Gog.14
The formulaic character of these turnings is apparent in the set idiom used to
convey them, which is always “set your face toward (la/l[ ˚ynp µyc) . . . and
prophesy against (la/l[ abnhw).”15 When the apparent object of the turning
of face is different, a different verb instead of µyc is used (4:3: ˚ynp ta htnybhw;
4:7: ˚ynp ˆybt; 14:8: ynp yttnw [P’s inﬂuence]). These gestures have no mean-
ing outside of their written existence.
Ezekiel’s characterization as a book prophet undermines the argument that
he must have acted in Jerusalem because he supposedly had an “intimate fa-
miliarity” with what was happening in the city. This argument is supposedly
supported by a few segments that create the impression that Ezekiel was in Je-
rusalem, speaking directly to its residents. These segments are: 5:5–17 (v. 5:
“this is Jerusalem; I have set her in the center of the nations,” and from v. 7
onward the second person is used); 12:17–20 (v. 19: “and say to the people of
the land, Thus said the Lord God concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in
the land of Israel”); 22:1–16 (v. 3: “a city shedding blood within itself,” and
from v. 4 on there is continuous use of the second-person feminine). In actu-
ality, there is no agreement about the place and time in which these segments
were written.16 But apart from this disagreement it is assumed, and for some
14. Fohrer maintains that looking at the object of the prophecy originally derived from
a magical gesture (Ezechiel, 37). Zimmerli views it as an archaic trait in Ezekiel’s prophecies
(Ezechiel, 143). As far as the book of Ezekiel is concerned, I do not think that it implies
anything more than literary dependence. William Brownlee took the phrase “set your face
toward” to imply that the prophet traveled to all of those places (“Son of Man, Set Your
Face,” HUCA 54 [1983] 83–110), which is inconceivable.
15. Ezek 21:2[20:46] has merely a minor change.
16. In 12:17–20, Volkmar Herntrich (Ezechielprobleme [BZAW 61; Giessen: Alfred Tö-
pelmann, 1933]) thought that the prophet was in Jerusalem; Alfred Bertholet (Hesekiel [HAT
13; Tübingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1936]), that he was in Judah but not in Jerusalem; Hölscher
(Hesekiel) and Fohrer (Ezechiel), that he was in exile and that the prophecy addresses those
who remained in the land after 597 b.c.e.; Zimmerli (Ezechiel), that he was necessarily in
exile and that these verses can be dated between the years 593 and 586 b.c.e. Regarding the
list of offenses put in the style of the Book of Holiness, in the unit 22:1–16, Hölscher
(Hesekiel) claims that it cannot belong to Ezekiel. Herntrich (Ezechielprobleme) and Bertho-
let (Hesekiel) claim that, on the contrary, this is evidence of Ezekiel’s activity in Jerusalem,

reason is taken for granted, that the words before us were uttered in a live
speech, even though we have them only in writing. Since what is written is
already distanced from the time when the “word of the Lord” came to the
prophet, it is impossible to prove that these words had an existence in the form
of live rhetoric before being written down and that they were phrased exactly
as we have them written before us. At any rate, one cannot deny that what we
have before us is in writing, and in writing the prophet could speak to Jerusa-
lem using the second person, even from a thousand miles away. In just the
same manner he uses the second person when addressing nations and coun-
tries he never visited, which is true not only of Ezekiel but of all the latter
prophets. To a certain extent, the written words have autonomous rules. Even
if they were preceded by live oratory, they are not necessarily identical to it.
The written text is the only testimonial. Ezekiel’s residing in Jerusalem is
nothing other than an illusion caused by the unique delivery of his words in
writing.
The ﬁve ritual images that Ezekiel sees in, and on the outskirts of, the inner
temple court after he was carried there by the spirit (chap. 8) are an even less
convincing evidence for his residence in Jerusalem. Let us not forget that the
Lord in person, appearing as a ﬁre from the loins and downward and as bright-
ness from the loins and upward (v. 2), leads Ezekiel around the court, and
there is nobody else there with the prophet. He sees 70 elders of Israel burning
incense before animals engraved on the wall, after he had dug in the wall, en-
tering a secret chamber (vv. 8–12), which means that practically no one
reached the place before him. Of the remaining images, two are odd and in-
comprehensible: “the image of jealousy”17 by the northern gate of the inner
court (vv. 3, 5) and the branch of vine that the people of Judah put to “their
17. “The image of jealousy” (hanqh lms) is a polemic term, so there is no way of know-
ing to what shape it is referring. It cannot be the Asherah placed in the Temple by Ma-
nasseh and “beat to dust” in the time of Josiah (2 Kgs 23:6). The orthostats of northern
Syria and Mesopotamia in the twelfth to seventh centuries b.c.e., whom William Albright
(Archaeology and the Religion of Israel [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1942]
165–66) mentions, are irrelevant here, and his basic approach (pp. 165–68) to Ezekiel 8 as
a cultic reality inﬂuenced by Egyptian and Mesopotamian rituals does not seem reasonable.
Zimmerli is correct in rejecting Albright’s view regarding the orthostats, but he attempts in
vain to reveal a realistic element in the descriptions (Ezechiel, 214–15).
because otherwise it would be merely a literary work. Zimmerli (Ezechiel) holds that this
could not have been said in Jerusalem (p. 506: the Jerusalemites would have viewed these
words as only “an unrestrained exaggeration”), and one must not exclude the possibility
that they belong before the destruction.

nose” (emendation by the Sopherim for “my nose”; v. 17).18 One of the im-
ages is clearly understandable, and yet it appears to be imaginary: men in the
inner court are bowing to the sun, while their backs are turned to the temple
(v. 16). It is unimaginable that this was the practice in the Jerusalem court,
even in Manasseh’s time, despite the fact that the temple’s layout incorporates
an antiquated orientation toward the sun, which is Canaanite and even Egyp-
tian in origin. When worship of the sun was practiced in Jerusalem (in the
time of Manasseh, 2 Kgs 23:5, 11; Jer 8:2; see also Deut 4:19), it was surely an
alternative or a syncretistic form of Yhwh worship, which would not have jus-
tiﬁed turning someone’s back to the temple.19 The additional image is at the
entrance to the northern gate of the inner court, where the prophet sees
women “sitting,” that is, on the ground, like mourners (compare Ezek 26:16,
Job 2:13, Lam 2:10), “bewailing Tamuz” (Ezek 8:14). Tamuz, the son and
lover of Istar as well as the god of fertility, is well known in the Mesopotamian
sphere, as is his wailing (in the fourth month, not the sixth [8:1]). And this is
the only occurrence of his name in the Bible, appearing here with the deter-
minative article. The analogy of this image to the other alternating images in
this context, with the general frame of the vision, testify that this image, as
well, is not a realistic one. Tamuz, as a concept, was possibly known to Ezekiel
and thus was implanted in Ezekiel’s ecstatic experience—and this was in the
temple, no less, which was doomed to destruction, as Ezekiel (who wrote his
vision after the destruction) already knew. The temple’s destruction, as an
earth-shattering experience, required an explanation, and in the case of a
prophet such as Ezekiel the explanation could have exceeded the boundaries
18. In chap. 8, hrwmz is a branch of vine (see Num 13:23; Isa 17:10; Ezek 15:2; Nah 2:3).
Those who accept this meaning here and those who search for another meaning have made
various suggestions, without ﬁnding an acceptable solution. The omission of the end of the
verse is not a solution either.
19. The assumption by medieval commentators that the text deals with what actually
occurred cannot be accepted, nor the tedious efforts of modern scholars (Hölscher, Hesekiel,
10, and others) to ﬁnd a historical element in this bowing and to search for equivalents in
the rituals of Egypt (Fohrer, Ezechiel; Zimmerli, Ezechiel) and other regions. I am also not
of the belief that these images in chap. 8, altogether, derive from what happened in the time
of Manasseh, as Kuenen (Einleitung, 2:267 n. 1) assumed in his time, following F. Hitzig
(Der Prophet Ezechiel erklärt): “the times of Manasseh hovered in spirit before the prophet”).
This was also Yehezkel Kaufmann’s opinion (Toledot ha-ºemuna ha-yi¶reªelit [4 vols.; Tel
Aviv: Mosad Bialik and Dvir, 1937–56] 3:502: “the shadow of the sins of Manasseh still
lingers upon the city and the temple”; 3:538: “there is no doubt that the shadow of Ma-
nasseh’s time lingers upon his [Ezekiel’s] book”). Formerly, this was my view as well, but it
is more correct to state that there are no shadows of the past here, because it is no more
than prophetic imagination, which should not come as a surprise with Ezekiel.

of reality. All of the ﬁve above-mentioned images, which are in fact one pro-
gressive vision, were the product of a wild imagination that must have pres-
sured the conscience of the prophet into writing them down. It was in writing
that their expression was given to them, and from a certain distance of time.
Still another manifestation of Ezekiel’s character as a book prophet are his
historical surveys (chaps. 16, 20, 23), which are full of “learnedness” that is
tendentious in its rulings, and are, due to their nature, literary products not
meant to be heard. These surveys contain strange exaggerations that contradict
the consensus of biblical tradition. If people besides Ezekiel, who probably
were aware of their historical or supposed past, heard them, they would have
been puzzled. These exaggerations are the accusations that were directed at Is-
rael and Jerusalem: that Jerusalem was faulty from the time of her birth, and
her father was an Amorite and her mother a Hittite (16:3, 45); gifts are made
to prostitutes, but Jerusalem gave gifts to her lovers and bribed them (16:32–
34, 41); Israel was already deﬁled when they were in Egypt, and they did not
abandon Egypt’s idols even after the exodus (20:7–8; 23:3, 8, 19, 21, 27); Je-
rusalem was more corrupt than Sodom and Gomorra, while Samaria did not
commit “even half ” of the sins of Jerusalem (16:46–52; 23:11).20 These sur-
veys also include accusations concerning historical crimes for which the people
in exile were certainly not responsible, such as offering sacriﬁces at the high
places after Israel arrived in Canaan (16:16, 31; 20:28–29), human sacriﬁces
(16:20), and passing children through the ﬁre (20:31; compare 16:21), which
was the worship of Molek practiced in the time of Ahaz (2 Kgs 16:3; see also
Isa 30:33) and Manasseh (2 Kgs 21:6).21 If the prophet had announced these
20. The mourner in Lamentations says: “the chastisement of my people has been greater
than the punishment of Sodom” (Lam 4:6). If this analogy proves something, it is that
Ezekiel’s words were also written after the destruction of the temple. The destruction, as a
horrible, incomprehensible happening, is the reason for the exaggeration.
21. Despite the vagueness of some parts of chaps. 16 and 20 referred to above, they still
contain enough to comprehend the nature of the accusations against Israel throughout the
ages. In 16:20, “you took your sons and your daughters,” there is a reference to other hu-
man sacriﬁces besides the ﬁrstborn, which was a sacriﬁce of males. The children (“which you
had borne to me, and these you sacriﬁced to them”) are sacriﬁced to male images, which are
foreign gods (vv. 17–19). In 16:21, the accusation “you slaughtered my (LXX: your) chil-
dren” refers not to the ﬁrstborn, although it is followed by µtwa ryb[hb (as is 20:26 as well),
which is the language used for ﬁrstborn (cf. Exod 13:12; 34:19). Rather, it refers to sacriﬁc-
ing before Molek, despite the absence of either the word Molek or the term vab ‘by ﬁre’
here (compare Ezek 23:37: “and their sons . . . they have also set apart to them [to the idols]
for food”). In 20:25–26, the two verses should not be interpreted each on its own; rather,
they should be understood as one continual sequence: I gave them statutes that were not
good and by this “deﬁled them with their gifts.” This is based on the rule “measure for

accusations to the exiles, they could have responded, “How can we help, for
we have already been punished and are in exile?” It is clear that the historical
surveys and the accusations regarding crimes for which the exiles were not re-
sponsible were meant to explain and justify the destruction of the temple.
Consequently, it transpires that at the time of these surveys the destruction had
already occurred. In other words, it is not that the destruction is inevitable,
which on the face of it one might conclude from some of Ezekiel’s devastation
prophecies, not having a historical perspective. The destruction has already
taken place, and it is the need for explication that causes a distortion of the his-
torical perspective. We cannot guess what the initial forms of these surveys
were, when the “word of the Lord” that reached the prophet was not yet
written down. But we would not be wide of the mark by assuming that, if
there were preliterary formations that preceded the text before us, they were
not favorable at all.
Another extraordinary manifestation of Ezekiel’s character as a book
prophet is his ceremonial act symbolizing the uniﬁcation of Ephraim and Ju-
dah as one people. This theme is mentioned by other prophets as well (Hos
2:1–3; Jer 3:11–15; 30:3; 31:1–8), but only Ezekiel expresses it by writing, as
beﬁts a writer. In the prophecy of comfort in 37:15–28, in the ﬁrst paragraph
(vv. 15–20), Ezekiel brings two “trees” close to one another until they become
“one tree joined together” in his hand, after he has written the name Judah on
one and the name Joseph on the other. In this context, the ‘tree’ ≈[ means a
writing tablet, as Targum Jonathan has it (ajwl), which is the correct interpreta-
tion.22 These tablets do not resemble the ‘staffs’ twfm in Num 17:16–26[1–11]

ment Book,” BA 6/4 [1943] 75–76), and with certainty by G. R. Driver (Semitic Writings
from Pictograph to Alphabet [3rd ed.; London: Oxford University Press, 1976] 80). Some re-
cent English versions such as the neb and reb, have correctly rendered dja ≈[ as one leaf
of a wooden tablet. Concerning wooden tablets in Assyria, of which two, three, or more
could be joined together, see D. J. Wiseman, “Assyrian Writing Boards,” Iraq 17 (1955) 3–

measure”: just as their eyes were set on the idols (v. 24), and thus they deﬁled themselves
(vv. 7, 18, 30, 31), so I made them “deﬁled” by unworthy gifts (see Cooke, Ezekiel, 218).
The unworthy gifts are indicated in v. 26 which, again, speaks not of the ﬁrstborn but of
sacriﬁces to Molek, as is clear from v. 31 (which mentions passing the children “through
ﬁre”). If they were not aimed at Molek, vv. 25–26 together with the explanatory efforts
would be utterly strange. In 20:31, “when you make your children pass through the ﬁre
. . . to this day,” the last words may be a vertical dittographic double but not a secondary
“addition” from the end of v. 29 (where they are problematic as well). This is a distortion
of historical perspective, which is typical of Ezekiel, and it accounts for the destruction.

on which Moses wrote, nor do they resemble the shepherds’ ‘staffs’ twlqm in
Zech 11:7–17, which were only given names but not written on. Ezekiel, Isa-
iah, and Habakkuk have the actual act of writing in common, and the latter
two mention that they have also been written on tablets (Isa 30:8; Hab 2:2).
III. Writing, Remembering, and Apocalypticism
The above-mentioned state of affairs leads us to ask: was Ezekiel solely a
book prophet, or were his prophecies also realized aloud before an audience?
Ezekiel’s prophecies allude to things he said, or should have said, to other
people; but these are, as can be proved, not direct representations of oral
speech. Ezekiel does not appear in public at all. When the text refers explicitly
to Ezekiel’s contact with other people, the prophet is sitting in his home, and
the people (“the elders of Judah,” “certain elders of Israel”) come and sit with
him (8:1; 14:1; 20:1; 33:31). They come in order to “inquire of the Lord”
(20:1, 3, 31; also 14:3, 7), which means that they expect him to inform them
of what is to be in the future, which was the common practice for “inquiring
of the Lord” through prophets (for example, see Gen 25:22; 1 Sam 9:9; 1 Kgs
22:8; 2 Kgs 22:28). Because there is no contact between the two sides, it looks
as if a curtain was stretched between him and them. They sit before him while
a “form of a hand” is taking him by a lock of his hair and carries him to the
temple court in Jerusalem (Ezek 8:3). In another case, before they have a
chance to say anything, the Lord informs the prophet that they have “set up
their idols in their mind,” and therefore he “should not be inquired of by
them” (14:3).23 Moreover, any of the people of Israel who turns to the
prophet, as well as any prophet who is “seduced and does speak a word” will
be destroyed (14:7–10). In still another instance, Ezekiel gives the elders sit-
ting with him a long historical survey without being asked to do so. This sur-
vey is (as is usual in this book) a distinct literary unit, describing the wayward
behavior of Israel from the time of their exodus from Egypt until they entered
the Promised Land (20:2–29). Following this survey, and as a continuation of
the same unit, Ezekiel tells the “House of Israel” that they are deﬁling them-
selves as their ancestors did, and therefore the Lord repeats his oath not to be
“inquired of by them” (20:30–31). Here the unit turns to elated expressions
of comfort regarding their destiny, and with that it ends (20:32–44). It ap-
pears that, while giving this speech, the prophet disregards the presence of

“certain elders of Israel,” despite their explicit appearance at the beginning of
the unit (see 20:3; compare 14:3–4). Similarly, concerning the people who
have come to sit with him, the prophet is told: “To them you are just a singer
of bawdy songs . . . ; they hear your words but will not obey them” (33:32).
The answers that the prophet is commanded to give in response to ques-
tions he will be asked, which are generally also given to him by the Lord in
advance (see 21:12; 24:18–24; 37:18–19), are just a kind of prearranged the-
atrical ceremony. These answers do not turn Ezekiel into an orating prophet,
who was foreordained to stand before an audience of “thistles and thorns”
(2:6). His speech in the east gate of the temple, performed within an imagi-
nary framework and leading to the death of Pelatiah ben Benaiah (11:1–3),
surely does not make Ezekiel a prophet of the preexilic type.24 In the call
prophecy, as well as in the prophecy following it, he is told a number of times
(2:4, 7; 3:27) that he is being sent to Israel in order to “say to them: ‘Thus said
the Lord!’” But in the same breath he is warned: “He who listens will listen
and he who does not will not, for they are a rebellious house” (2:5, 7; 3:27);
and yet more decisively: “But the House of Israel will refuse to listen to you,
for they refuse to listen to me” (3:7). The premonition about the people’s in-
attentiveness means that, from the very beginning, there is little point in
speaking to them and may also explain the paucity of real speeches. And it
goes without saying that the theoretical contemplations about each person’s
responsibility for his or her own actions and the prophet’s responsibility, as a
“watchman,” to “warn a wicked man of his wicked course” and “warn the
righteous man not to sin” (3:21; 33:8) have nothing to do with this prophet’s
24. We do not read about Pelatiah son of Benaiah anywhere else, but scholars assume,
apparently rightfully so, that he is a historical ﬁgure. The question is how Ezekiel saw Pel-
atiah’s death from a thousand miles away, and how this death took place as a response to the
prophet’s proclamations within a visionary framework. Some scholars viewed 11:13 as
proof of Ezekiel’s telepathic ability or of his activity in Jerusalem, or else they considered
this verse a later gloss. Zimmerli asserted that “if this [the death of Pelatiah] did not occur
at that same point in time,” Ezekiel did not have to see this as a denial of his prophecy, be-
cause “the validity of a prophecy . . . is in no way dependant on performances set according
to the calendar” (Ezechiel, 246). As I see it, there should be no great difﬁculty here. We do
not know what the prophet felt at the moment he was caught up by the vision. Quite a few
years had to elapse after this moment, and what we have before us is what he sensed at the
time of writing. At this time, Pelatiah was undoubtedly no longer alive, and it seems that in
the course of time the images ﬂoating in the prophet’s mind took on a slightly different
form. The assumption that the words were written very close to the ecstatic experience is
what overburdens the text with an unsolvable difﬁculty. Assuming that a signiﬁcant distance
of time extended between the experience and its being put into writing, toward the end of
the prophet’s activity, frees up the solution.

way of life. It is unimaginable that Ezekiel spent his time running from one
person to another in order to watch their behavior.25
The only verse containing explicit evidence of active contact between Ezek-
iel and the exiles, on his own initiative, is at the summation of the series of vi-
sions in chaps. 8–11: “and I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had
shown me” (11:25). This summation is not fully compatible with the opening
of chap. 8, where “the elders of Judah” who are sitting with the prophet in his
home are referred to (8:1). From the moment the “hand of the Lord” fell on
Ezekiel, while they were sitting with him, no contact between him and them
could have existed. When the last vision left him, we would expect him to turn
to them but it again appears that the presence of the elders was forgotten in the
ﬂow of events. Nevertheless, I would not regard the summation verse as a mere
addition. Ezekiel’s literary units, with their loose structure, can sustain a certain
incompatibility between beginning and conclusion. The aforementioned verse,
which in any case is part of Ezekiel’s literary inventory, can decide the question
of his oral activity. Scholars who conceive Ezekiel to be similar to the First
Temple prophets try, in vain, to identify units in his book that were spoken, as
they appear before us, to a live audience. The truth of the matter is that, when
this prophet put into writing what he had experienced or said at different times,
he expressed himself as the images came to memory and materialized at the
moment of writing, in retrospect, when the actual prophetic performance was
over. Before putting his words into writing, however, he did not completely
refrain from coming into contact with the exiles, though essentially he was an
ecstatic recluse, a harsh man of fantasies. The very references to words that
Ezekiel was supposed to say (for example, 17:3; 19:2; 21:14; 30:2) are evidence
25. Zimmerli is not of this view. He maintains that from the call (2:4) to the vision of
the new temple (40:4) we have repeatedly heard the explicit order to speak, and “before the
dumbness clasps his (Ezekiel’s) mouth, he becomes an admonisher.” However, the dumb-
ness comes upon Ezekiel only seven days after his call, seven days in which Ezekiel does
nothing but sit “stunned” with the exiles (3:15). Zimmerli himself, with his inner integrity,
seems to have sensed the insufﬁciency of this evidence and adds that the book of Ezekiel
contains passages that present the oral form as it was. These are especially rhythmic passages
or rhythmical prose, which by their nature are meant more for hearing than for writing
(Ezechiel, 105). Recently, some have gone even further and claimed that the book of Ezek-
iel, which they consider to be a whole uniﬁed literary corpus, is also a “rhetorical unit” that
was presented publicly to listeners of the ﬁrst and second generations of exiles and was
aimed at inﬂuencing them to sever their ties with Israel’s past (Thomas Renz, The Rhetorical
Function of the Book of Ezekiel [VTSup 76; Leiden: Brill, 1999]). Regarding Zimmerli’s po-
sition, let me remark that there are to be found (and not just in the book of Ezekiel) pas-
sages of poetry (such as the prophecies against the nations) that are certainly more than
rhythmical prose but that existed only in writing, with no oral presentation.

that he had contact with the exiles, even if these are only apparent sayings that
could not have taken place in reality (for example, 6:3; 25:3; 27:3; 28:12, 22;
29:3; 32:2). The explicit statement at the end of chap. 11 joins these sayings. In
other words, when Ezekiel began to put his words into writing, he acted only
as a prophetic writer. Before writing down his prophecies, he had some con-
nection, restricted as it was, with his surroundings as a speaking or mumbling
prophet.
The distinction we make between two stages in Ezekiel’s activity, the stage
of limited contact with the exiles among whom he lived and the stage of writ-
ing down his experiences as a prophet in the course of time, is apt to clarify
what kind of relation there was between him and apocalypticism. The concept
of apocalypticism is difﬁcult to deﬁne, because as a genre it includes other
genres that were blended into it, while as a spiritual movement its deﬁnition
depends on the boundaries set for apocalyptic literature, which is a controver-
sial issue.26 Scholars who paid no heed to the complexity of the term tended
to deﬁne Ezekiel as the founder of apocalypticism. Others claimed that Ezek-
iel had some of the qualities of this movement, but they did not consider him
one of its representatives, certainly not one of its founders.27 This second
26. The term ‘apocalypse’ ajpokaluvyiÍ, appears at the beginning of Revelation and is
typical of this work, the ﬁrst two verses of which (1:1–2) express its character. The term, as
a noun and as a verb deriving from it, appears again on a few occasions in the New Testa-
ment (Matt 16:17; Gal 1:12; Eph 3:3–5). But this is not a basically Christian term, and its
deﬁnition requires ﬂexibility; see Paul Hanson’s comment: “Rather than describing an ideal
type, it is preferable to sketch the typical features of the work originally designated ‘apoca-
lypse’ in antiquity, the Book of Revelation, and then to consider which other compositions
of the same era show sufﬁcient similarity to justify extension of the term to them as well”
(IDBSup, 27). In contrast, one New Testament scholar stated that “the term has often been
deﬁned so loosely and broadly as almost to lose any distinctiveness” (M. Rist, “Apocalyp-
ticism,” IDB 1:157). Regarding apocalypticism as a spiritual movement, Hanson asserted
that “it is impossible to devise one list which includes all the important characteristics” of
this movement, though certain continuity is discernible in the major apocalyptic trends
(IDBSup 31b).
27. Bernhard Duhm, after distinguishing between prophecy and apocalypse, seems to
have been the ﬁrst to consider Ezekiel “the father of apocalypse” (Israels Propheten [2nd ed.;
Tübingen: Mohr, 1922] 232–34). This is also the way that Ezekiel is presented in Lorenz
Dürr’s book, Die Stellung des Propheten Ezechiel in der israelitisch-jüdischen Apokalyptik (Mün-
ster: Aschendorff, 1923). For examples of those who ﬁnd some characteristics of apocalypse
in Ezekiel’s prophecies but do not consider him to be one of the representatives of the move-
ment, see, for example, Otto Eissfeldt, Einleitung in das Alte Testament (3rd ed.; Tübingen:
Mohr [Siebeck], 1964) 514; Cooke, Ezekiel, 406; Hanson, IDBSup 28b (“Though it is dif-
ﬁcult to designate the visions of Ezekiel as apocalypses, individual motifs from his visions
had profound inﬂuence on the development of the genre”); Julius Wellhausen, Israelitische

opinion is probably correct. Indeed, Ezekiel’s prophecies contain some char-
acteristics reminiscent of apocalypticism, foremost of which are the literary
qualities of his prophecies, which on the whole appear to be works of writing.
This is due to the fact that the prophet’s feelings and perceptions at the time
of writing were projected onto the memory of his ecstatic and prophetic ex-
perience years ago, and the temporal distance facilitated the projection. The
fantastic character of his experiences, which were intensiﬁed by an uncon-
trolled imagination, also contributed to the apocalyptic appearance. That is to
say, what imparts to his prophecies some apocalyptic features is not necessarily
their inﬂuence on subsequent apocalypses but the circumstances of his activ-
ity, which only at its concluding stage became strenuous and vigorous writing.
Ezekiel cannot be deﬁned as an apocalyptic, precisely because his writing was
preceded by live contact with the exiles, whereas the clear-cut apocalypses,
concealing themselves as they did behind a pseudoepigraphic veil, are merely
works of writing. However limited Ezekiel’s contact with the exiles may have
been, an undeniable repercussion of this contact is felt in his prophecies.

The Decrees of Yahweh That Are “Not Good”: 
Ezekiel 20:25–26
Kelvin G. Friebel
Regina, Saskatchewan
Within the prophetic indictment of Ezekiel 20, there are two verses (vv. 25–
26) that are considered to be among the most theologically enigmatic of the
whole book. Verses 25–26 state that, as part of the divine punishment delivered
to the second generation in the wilderness, Yahweh declared:
25 Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which
they could not live. 26 I deﬁled them through their very gifts, in their offering
up all their ﬁrstborn, in order that I might horrify them, so that they might
know that I am the Lord.1

>hwhy yna rva w[dy rva ˆ[ml µmva ˆ[ml 26
The context of these verses is a prophetic message given in response to the el-
ders’ inquiry (vv. 1–4). It is rhetorically structured in a chronological progres-
sion of three sections moving from the past (vv. 5–29) to the present (vv. 30–
31) into the future (vv. 32–44).2 Verses 5–29 are a historical retrospect dealing
1. The nrsv (Division of Christian Education of the National Council of Churches of
Christ in the United States, 1989) is used at this point to give a sense of how the passage is
normally rendered. Elsewhere in the essay, unless otherwise stated, the English translation
is my own.
2. Because almost all commentators regard vv. 25–26 as part of the original content of
the oracle, the debate over the compositional unity of the chapter, speciﬁcally whether
vv. 27–29 and 32–44 are editorial additions, is not one that needs to be entered into or re-
solved for the purposes of this essay. It is sufﬁcient to note that 20:1–44 are thematically and
rhetorically interwoven as a literary unit. See speciﬁcally the discussion of this in Daniel
Block, The Book of Ezekiel Chapters 1–24 (NICOT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1997) 611–
13; Ellen Davis, Swallowing the Scroll: Textuality and the Dynamics of Discourse in Ezekiel’s
Prophecy ( JSOTSup 78; BLS 21; Almond, 1989) 110–13; Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel 1–20
(AB 22; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1983) 376–88.

with the past generations’ willful disobedience to Yahweh’s proclamations.3
The present aspect of the prophetic address in vv. 30–31 drives home the
point that Ezekiel’s contemporary audience in the Babylonian exile continues
in the behavioral patterns of their ancestors. The message then culminates in
vv. 32–44 with the future prospect of the purgation and reestablishment of the
people in the land.
Verses 25–26 occur as part of the historical retrospect, which is composed
of four thematic subsections that describe sequentially four epochs that are tied
directly to their geographical venue: the people in Egypt (vv. 5–10), the ﬁrst
generation in the wilderness (vv. 11–17), the second generation in the wilder-
ness (vv. 18–26), and the settlement in the land (vv. 27–29).
The theological anomaly of vv. 25–26 is highlighted by the contrasting na-
ture of their content in relation to other declarations within the same oracle.
The description of the decrees and judgments as being ‘not good’ and ‘not
life-giving’ (µhb wyjy al . . . µybwf al) contrasts with the perspective in vv. 11,
13, and 21 that observance of the divinely given statutes and ordinances, allud-
ing to the Sinai experience, bestows life (µhb yjw µdah µtwa hc[y rva).4
Also, in Ezek 16:20–21, 36, and 23:37, 39, child sacriﬁce is spoken of as an
act of spiritual apostasy and is considered repulsive by Yahweh and not some-
thing that he intended the people to do.5 Thus the statement in 20:26, if un-
derstood as Yahweh decreeing child sacriﬁce, seems to be out of synch with
the other pronouncements regarding child sacriﬁce in the book.
The most common way of interpreting vv. 25–266 is that µyqj ‘decrees’
and µyfpvm ‘judgments’ refer to provisions of the covenantal law given by
Yahweh, as in vv. 11–13 and 19–21.7 Some modern commentators have un-
3. Conclusions related to the derivation and the historical validity of the retrospect in
vv. 5–29 are not focused on in this essay since such do not affect the issue speciﬁcally of
how to interpret vv. 25–26.
4. See also the pronouncements of life for observance of the law in Ezek 18:9, 17, 21,
28; 33:15, 16, 19.
5. See also Jer 7:31, 19:5, and 32:35, where child sacriﬁce is not something that Yahweh
commanded, nor did it even enter his mind for the people to do it.

That Were Not Good: Ezekiel 20:25 in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity,” in Sacred
History and Sacred Texts in Early Judaism (ed. J. N. Bremmer and F. García Martínez; Kam-
pen: Kok Pharos, 1992) 106–18.
7. The other major line of interpretation is that these “laws” refer to the laws of Israel’s
foreign enemies, among whom they would be scattered by God; see Johan Lust, “Ez., XX,

derstood the declaration fairly literally as either a denigration of the Sinai law8
or as a revealing of Ezekiel’s true negative subconscious feelings with respect
to Yahweh.9 But most commentators have sought, in some way, to ease the
theological disparagement.
One proposal is to read the verses as an interrogative10 that constitutes a
rhetorical question: “Did I give to them decrees that were not good and judg-
ments by which they could not live, so that I deﬁled them by means of their
gifts, by means of their offering all their ﬁrstborn, in order to devastate them?”
The obvious answer would be “of course not” and thus a reafﬁrmation of the
goodness of the law. But this interpretation ﬂounders because there are no
grammatical indicators that this is a question, and reading it as one destroys the
literary parallelism with the preceding strong asseverations in vv. 15 and 23,
which also begin with yna µg ‘also I’. Just as those previous declarations cannot
be read as rhetorical questions, so too the parallel form of expression in vv. 25–
26 should not be.
8. Steven Tuell, “Divine Presence and Absence in Ezekiel’s Prophecy,” in The Book of
Ezekiel: Theological and Anthropological Perspectives (ed. Margaret Odell and John Strong; At-
lanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2000) 200: “even the Sinai revelation itself was under-
stood by Ezekiel as shot through with corruption (see Ezek 20:25–26).”
9. David J. Halperin, Seeking Ezekiel: Text and Psychology (University Park: Pennsylva-
nia State University Press, 1993) 170: “In the unconscious thoughts that underlie Ezekiel’s
fantasies, Yahweh . . . demands . . . that children be sacriﬁced to his pleasure. . . . Of
course, Yahweh will then emerge as a monster of cruelty and hypocrisy. But surely this is
an accurate statement of Ezekiel’s unconscious perception of his God.”

the people were either forced to follow the nations’ edicts and customs, even those contrary
to God’s decrees, or willfully assimilated to them. This interpretively connects with the
people’s statement in v. 32 of wanting to be like the nations. This interpretation is found in
the Targum of the Rabbinic Bible: “25. So, too, since they had rebelled against My Memra, and
did not wish to listen to My prophets, I removed them and delivered them into the hand of their ene-
mies; they followed their stupid inclination and they obeyed religious decrees which were not proper and
laws by which they could not survive” (Samson Levy, The Targum of Ezekiel [The Aramaic Bible
13; Wilmington, Del.: Glazier, 1987] 62–63). But Levy notes that within the Targum tra-
dition two separate lines of interpretation have been preserved. Thus the Sperber manu-
script omits “enemies,” with the resultant meaning being that “God delivers them into the
power of their stupid inclinations, so they go ‘and they make’ the unworthy religious de-
crees and laws” (p. 63 n. 9). The latter reading corresponds with the interpretation that the
people had misconstrued the divinely given laws and created regulations derived from them
that were contrary to the divine intent.

Kelvin G. Friebel

Other scholars have resorted to the emendation of rearranging the verses so
that vv. 25–26 follow v. 27.11 Verse 27 bears the accusation, “In this also your
ancestors blasphemed me.” Following that statement, vv. 25–26 are then un-
derstood as the quotation of the people that explicates exactly what their blas-
phemous pronouncement was: the people were erroneously attributing child
sacriﬁce to Yahweh. But this rearrangement of the verses destroys the literary
parallelism of the declarations of judgment (vv. 15–16 // vv. 23–24 + 25–26)
in the two adjacent subsections, which follow the numerically increasing pat-
tern of 1 followed by 1+1, all three of which begin with yna µg ‘also I’.
The most common way of interpreting the “not good decrees” and “not
life-giving judgments” of v. 25 that seeks to maintain an ideological consis-
tency with the statements in vv. 11, 13, and 21 that observance of the law
leads to life is to view those negative results as being the consequence of hu-
man misinterpretation of the divine regulations, rather than being an inherent
quality of them. The divinely bestowed decrees of the law were actually
“good,” but the people’s misconstruing of them resulted in the complete sub-
version of their intended life-giving effects. Verse 26a is then understood as
citing either the reason or the purpose for Yahweh’s intending or allowing the
people to misconstrue the laws, so that through the observance of those mis-
interpreted statutes Yahweh would deﬁle his people (µtwa amfaw). Verse 26b
then expresses the resulting act of judgment, ‘so that I will devastate them’
(µmva ˆ[ml). The people’s actions, based on fabricated interpretations, were
thus contrary to the original divine decrees and were what, in turn, resulted
in divine judgment coming upon the people.
The manner in which the divine participation is expressed in vv. 25–26 is
interpreted somewhere along a theological continuum, the one end of which is
that Yahweh “deliberately” gave the laws in “a form calculated to cause his
people to fall.”12 In other words, Yahweh intentionally gave ambiguously ex-
pressed laws with the awareness that the people would misconstrue them, and
he did it so that he could then punish them for their lack of obedience to the
originally intended meaning and application of the laws. Yahweh thus created
the circumstances that would elicit the people’s disobedience. Cited analogies
to this are the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart in Exodus 7–11, 14, the sending of
the lying spirit to the prophets in 1 Kgs 22:19–23, and the statement in Isa 6:9–

10 that God worked in the situation so as to bring about the intended result of
judgment. Ezekiel’s declaration here is seen as a radicalization of that theological
concept, in that Yahweh intentionally orchestrated the whole scenario.
The other perspective on the theological continuum is that the divine act
of the verses is to be understood in a “permissive” sense. Yahweh allowed the
people to follow after their own misinterpretations of the law.13 An example
of this reading is the niv14 translation: “I also gave them over to statutes that
were not good and laws they could not live by; I let them become deﬁled
through their gifts—the sacriﬁce of every ﬁrstborn—that I might ﬁll them
with horror so they would know that I am the Lord.”
Following these lines of interpretation, the manner of expression that at-
tributes the activity directly to God is then explained as deriving from either
theological perspectives or rhetorical motivations. It could be attributed to the
radical theocentric nature of Ezekiel’s theology, in which all events and results
were directly attributed to God, even though in a modern systematic theology
a more precise distinction would be made between what God actively does
and brings about, and what God allows or permits to happen. Or similarly, be-
cause of God’s foreknowledge of the people’s rebelliousness, the subsequent
punishment that resulted was spoken of in terms of divine causation. Or it
could be a rhetorical exaggeration designed for its impact. Or possibly in at-
tributing these laws to Yahweh, Ezekiel was, for rhetorical purposes, accom-
modating to and adopting the viewpoint of the people who held that Yahweh
had actually given the traditions that they were following, even though Ezek-
iel would not have considered them from Yahweh.
Following the interpretation that the decrees and judgments of v. 25 refer
to the divinely given law that was misinterpreted by the people, v. 26a is seen
to be explanatory, because it cites a speciﬁc example of a “decree that is not
good”—that is, the offering of the ﬁrstborn (µjr rfp lk ryb[hb).
In the expression µjr rfp ‘that which ﬁrst opens the womb’, Ezekiel is
echoing the speciﬁc language of Exod 13:2, 12–13, 1515 and 34:19–20, in
which the ﬁrstborn belong to Yahweh and are to be given to him.16 In fact the

from George Heider’s, he does elucidate the links between this chapter and the Exodus tra-
dition and language (“A Further Turn on Ezekiel’s Baroque Twist in Ezek 20:25–26,” JBL
107 [1988] 721–28).

because it does not have the exemption clause related to redemption. But that verse uses the

echoing of Exod 13:12 seems evident, in that Ezekiel uses the same verb, the
Hiphil of rb[: Ezek 20:26, µjr rfp lk ryb[hb; Exod 13:12, rfp lk trb[hw
hwhyl µjr. But for Ezekiel, the verb is a pregnant term signifying the sacriﬁcial
death of the ﬁrstborn, not merely a dedication of the ﬁrstborn. Although Exod
13:12–13, as well as 34:20 and Num 18:15, have the subsequent stipulation
that the ﬁrstborn of humans are to be redeemed, the people, if they were
aware of that qualiﬁer, either disregarded it or understood it not as a universal
regulation but as an optional alternative; that is, not that every ﬁrstborn must
be thus redeemed but that the ﬁrstborn could be either redeemed or sacri-
ﬁced. Thus the law related to the ﬁrstborn being given to Yahweh was mis-
construed in the sense that what he demanded included literal child sacriﬁce.
When understood in this way, v. 26 refers to child sacriﬁces that were per-
formed as sacriﬁcial acts of worship devoted to Yahweh.
That v. 26 refers to the cultic activity of child sacriﬁce seems to be well es-
tablished.17 Outside of v. 26 there are six other references in Ezekiel to cultic
activity of this sort. In all seven occurrences, slightly different terminology is
used to describe the practice:
16:20: lwkal µhl µyjbztw . . . ˚ytwnb taw ˚ynb ta yjqtw ‘and you took your
sons and your daughters . . . and you sacriﬁced them to them [that is, to
the idols] to be eaten’;

27
23:39: µhylwlgl µhynb ta µfjçbw ‘and in their slaughtering their sons to
their idols’.
It is precisely the variety of expressions that reinforces the conclusion that the
cultic acts described refer to the actual burning of the children as slaughtered
sacriﬁces.19 In 16:20 and 23:37 the children are presented as food offerings to
the idols. In light of the literalness of the food offerings in 16:19, both 16:20
and 23:37 should not be interpreted merely in a metaphorical sense that the
people had dedicated their children to foreign gods.
In 16:21 and 23:39, the children are said to be ‘slaughtered’ (fjv) to the
idols. The word fjv is clearly a sacriﬁce-related term in Ezekiel, because the
only other occurrences of the verb refer to the cultic slaughtering of various
sacriﬁces in worship to Yahweh in 40:39, 41, 42, and 44:11.
In 16:36, what is ‘given’ (ˆtn) is ‘the blood of your children’ (˚ynb ymd).
When the action is again referred to in v. 38, it is described as ‘shedding blood’
(µd tkpv). Similarly in 23:37, ‘blood is on their hands’ (ˆhydyb µd) stands in
parallelism to ‘offering their children as food to the idols’ (wryb[h . . . ˆhynb ta
hlkal µhl). And in 23:45, where the action is again mentioned, it is described
as both ‘shedding blood’ (µd twkpv) and ‘blood is on their hands’ (ˆhydyb µd).20
The Hiphil of rb[ is used four times in 16:21; 20:26, 31, and 23:37, and
means literally ‘to pass through’. The term ryb[h, by itself, can be ambiguous
regarding the speciﬁcs of the ritual involved. But the interchangeable synony-
mous terms indicate that ryb[h refers to actual sacriﬁce when children are the
direct object. The terminology of 23:37, hlkal . . . ryb[h, is parallel to the
expression of 16:20, l/kal . . . jbz, indicating that jbz and ryb[h are inter-
changeable as synonyms. As noted above regarding these two passages, the
giving of the children as a food offering must be understood in a literal sacri-
ﬁcial sense. The more common expression with respect to child sacriﬁce is
‘make to pass through the ﬁre’ vab ryb[h,21 which appears in 20:31. Based
on the use of that expression elsewhere when children are the objects,22 there

by incineration but to some sort of consecration associated with magic” and that speciﬁcally
Ezek 23:37 “refers to Israel having alienated its own children from Yahweh, introduced
them to foreign cults, and dedicated them to other gods” (“rb"[:, ºabar,” TDOT 10:417–18).
20. Elsewhere in Ezekiel the crimes of “shedding blood” frequently involve social in-
justices of exploitation and oppression that result in the actual killing of individuals (see
7:23; 9:9; 22:2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 27).

Deut 18:10; 2 Kgs 16:3, 17:17, 21:6, 23:10; 2 Chr 33:6; Jer 32:35.
22. The expression vab ryb[h in Num 31:23 is not speaking of the same cultic activity.
It is addressing the issue of purifying the spoils of war (vv. 19–24) and the way to determine

28
seems to be little doubt that an actual incineration rather than a nonsacriﬁcial
ritual of child consecration is meant. For example, in Jer 32:35 the expression
vab ryb[h is used as the synonymous replacement for vab πrc ‘burn in ﬁre’
found in the parallel passages of Jer 7:31 and 19:5.23 Thus, ryb[h in 20:26
should be understood as referring to the act of child sacriﬁce.
Having given the common interpretation of this passage, I now turn to
exploring whether this is, from a literary standpoint, the most viable interpre-
tation. Of primary concern are ﬁve issues: (1) whether the decrees and judg-
ments of v. 25 refer to the Sinai law referenced elsewhere in the preceding
historical retrospect; (2) in what way the divine declaration of vv. 23–24 cor-
relates with the activity of vv. 25–26; (3) whether the deﬁling of v. 26 is a con-
sequential result following v. 25 or a distinct additional divine action; (4) the
precise meaning of “deﬁling” in v. 26; and (5) whether the child sacriﬁce in
v. 26 is to be understood as an act of worship to Yahweh or as an act per-
formed in the worship of idols.
With respect to the referents of the decrees and judgments in v. 25, many
commentators have noted the variant of the masculine plural µyqj ‘decrees’
rather than the feminine plural (twqj) used elsewhere in chap. 20 for the cove-
nant statutes (vv. 11, 13, 16, 19, 21, 24). But deviation from the stereotypical
phraseology of chap. 20 appears not solely in the use of the masculine plural
but also in the use of both ‘decrees’ and ‘judgments’ without the ﬁrst-person
possessive sufﬁx. Elsewhere in the chapter, the coordinated phrase is always
ytwqj ‘my statutes’ with yfpvm ‘my ordinances’ (vv. 11, 13, 16, 19, 21, 24).24
A deviation from the stereotypical coordination of these two terms is also no-
ticeable in v. 18 (yqwj µkytwba ‘the decrees of your fathers’ and µhyfpvm ‘their
judgments’), which is the only other occurrence of the masculine plural (µyqj)
in the chapter. In v. 18, the variance draws attention to the contrast between
the inappropriate teachings that were formulated and followed by their ances-
tors as opposed to the divine stipulations of Yahweh.
23. See also vab wtbw wnb ryb[m ‘one causing his son or his daughter to pass through
ﬁre’ in Deut 18:10, which seems synonymous with vab wprcy µhytnb taw µhynb ta ‘their
sons and their daughters they burn in ﬁre’ in Deut 12:31.
24. Outside of the six occurrences in chap. 20, this coordination also appears six more
times in Ezekiel (5:6, 7; 11:20; 18:9, 17; 37:24) in the similar sense of covenant obligations.
which puriﬁcation process is appropriate for any given inanimate object. Although the sim-
ilar expression of “passing through ﬁre” is used there, it does not provide an appropri-
ate hermeneutical parallel to the passages under discussion here; the same meaning of the
phrase should not be assumed to be applicable to the differing context of making a child
“pass through the ﬁre.”

The Decrees of Yahweh That Are “Not Good”: Ezekiel 20:25–26
29
Although the feminine plural (twqj) is the predominate form in Ezekiel in
reference to the divine decrees of the law, on two occasions the masculine
plural (µyqj), in coordination with µyfpvm, is used: 11:12 and 36:27. In both
of these cases, the ﬁrst-person possessive, in reference to Yahweh, is attached
to both nouns to avoid ambiguity regarding the source of the decrees. And the
stereotypical language of Ezekiel, ‘to walk’ ˚lh, ‘to keep’ rmv, and ‘to do’
hc[, is coordinated with the two terms. So, although the masculine plural
form is used in a couple of instances for the divinely given law, within the spe-
ciﬁc context of chap. 20 there does seem to be a differentiation between the
referents of the masculine plural and the feminine plural forms, as evidenced
from the different connotation of the masculine plural in v. 18. In v. 25, the
grammatical deviation of the masculine plural coupled with the variant of no
possessive pronoun attached to the nouns seem to be ways of literarily distin-
guishing the “decrees” and “judgments” of v. 25 from the “statutes” and “or-
dinances” of the divine covenantal law spoken of elsewhere in the chapter.
That a difference in referents is intended can also be deduced from the con-
trastive perspectives regarding the covenant statutes in the chapter and the
decrees of v. 25. As already noted, the contrast is evident when comparing
vv. 25–26 with vv. 11–12. In v. 25 the decrees and judgments are “not good”
and are “not life-producing,” whereas in v. 11 (also in vv. 13 and 21) Yahweh’s
statutes and ordinances are those by the observance of which “one shall live”
(µhb yjw). Furthermore, Yahweh’s ‘declaring the people unclean’ (µtwa amfaw)
in v. 26 is a counterpoint to his ‘sanctifying them’ (µvdqm) in v. 12. These
contrasts, which occur within the same literary unit, suggest that v. 25 is re-
ferring to declarations by Yahweh other than the covenant obligations for-
merly referenced, because it becomes illogical for the identically referenced
decrees to produce opposite results.
To what then do the “decrees” and “judgments” of v. 25 refer? A clue to
this can be found in the structural link between vv. 23–24 and vv. 25–26.
Both begin with yna µg ‘also I’, which literarily highlights their structural in-
terconnectedness. This repetition in v. 25 can be understood in one of two
ways. It can be understood as an additional, unrelated declaration of judgment,
or it can be understood as a literary device indicating a resumption of the sub-
ject of v. 23,25 in which Yahweh swears to scatter and disperse the people. As
a resumptive repetition, v. 25 would refer to that speciﬁc oath of judgment.
Clearly that decree of judgment in v. 23 is not to the people’s beneﬁt—in
25. See the similar use of µgw ‘and also’ in v. 12, where µhl yttn . . . µgw ‘and also . . . I
gave to them’, with respect to the Sabbaths, is a further resumptive repetition that elaborates
on and speciﬁes the preceding “giving” of the statutes and ordinances in v. 11 (µhl ˆtaw).

other words, it is not good. Rather it is essentially a declaration of death for
the nation—in other words, it is not life-giving. Understanding v. 25 as refer-
ring to the new declarations of judgment in v. 23, rather than to Yahweh’s
covenantal statutes and ordinances, would thus explain the variation in using
the masculine-plural µyqj as opposed to the feminine-plural twqj.
The generic µyfpvm ‘judgments’ also conforms with this interpretation,
because the only other occurrence in Ezekiel of the plural not determined by
a sufﬁx or a construct relationship is in 5:8, where it also bears the meaning of
‘judgments’ in the sense of punishments for sin. In fact, 5:8 bears interesting
literary similarities to v. 25 in that both are strong divine asseverations intro-
duced by yna µg ‘also I’. The generic plural of µyfpvm is juxtaposed in 5:8 with
the immediately preceding threefold use of the noun in 5:6–7, where it has
the ﬁrst-person sufﬁx and is coordinated with ytwqj. Thus the µyfpvm ‘judg-
ments’ in 5:8 are for failure to keep Yahweh’s twqj ‘statutes’ and µyfpvm ‘or-
dinances’ mentioned in the indictments in 5:6–7. And in 5:6–7 the people’s
disobedience to the covenant law is spoken of using the terminology ‘rebel’
hrm, ‘not walk in’ . . . b ˚lh al, ‘not do’ hv[ al, and ‘reject” sam, the same
as in 20:8, 13, 16, 21, and 24. Also 5:8 declares that the judgments will be
done ‘in the sight of the nations’ µywgh yny[l. This same motif appears in 20:9,
14, and 22, where Yahweh refrains from pouring out his wrath so that his
name will not be profaned “in the sight of the nations,” and in v. 41, where
his restoration is done “in the sight of the nations.”26
Thus it is appropriate in v. 25 for µyqj and µyfpvm to be understood, not
as statutes and ordinances that Yahweh had given for the people to follow—
that is, the Sinai law—but, rather, the newer decrees of punishment that Yah-
weh had declared would come upon the people due to their disobedience.
As already noted, vv. 25–26 along with vv. 23–24 form a two-part, parallel
declaration of judgment, both beginning with yna µg ‘also I’. The structure of
vv. 23–24 is that of a twofold declaration of judgment expressed with inﬁni-
tives (µta ≈yphl ‘to scatter them’ and µtwa twrzlw ‘to disperse them’), fol-
lowed by the reason clause introduced by ˆ[y ‘because’, which gives four
reasons for that judgment. Verses 25–26 appear to be similar in construction,
with a twofold declaration of judgment using the ﬁnite verbs (µhl yttn) ‘I gave
to them’ and (µtwa amfaw) ‘I deﬁled them’, followed by the reason introduced
by two prepositional phrases (µtwntmb ‘on account of their gifts’ and ryb[hb
µjr rfp lk ‘on account of [their] causing to pass through all [the] ﬁrstborn’),
which in turn are followed by the two purpose clauses, each introduced by
26. Outside of 5:8 and the four occurrences in chap. 20, the speciﬁc phrase µywg yny[l
appears only four other times in Ezekiel (22:16, 28:25, 38:23, 39:27).

The Decrees of Yahweh That Are “Not Good”: Ezekiel 20:25–26
31
ˆ[ml ‘so that’. Understood this way, µtwa amfaw is not explanatory of the rea-
son for or the consequence of giving the decrees that are not good but a coor-
dinated, separate declaration of the judgment that Yahweh had decreed. The
grammatical sequence should not be read as “I gave them decrees . . . so as to
deﬁle them” or “I gave them decrees . . . and thereby deﬁled them,” but as “I
gave them decrees . . . and, in addition, I deﬁled them.”
A key to understanding v. 26 is the unique declaration that ‘Yahweh deﬁles
the people’ (µtwa amfaw). This is the only place in which Yahweh is the sub-
ject of that verb.27 When the Piel of amf ‘to deﬁle’ occurs and the object is a
person (rather than a place or thing), it has the following meanings:
1. the subject performs a sexually deﬁling act upon another person that 
violates the other person’s being (Gen 34:5, 13, 27; Ezek 18:6, 11, 15; 
22:11; 23:17; 33:26);
2. the subject performs a deﬁling act, the contagion of which violates 
another person’s sphere of holiness (for example, the death of a person 
violating the high priest, Num 6:9; the people’s actions deﬁling 
Yahweh, speciﬁcally, his holy name, Ezek 43:7, 8);
3. the subjects do deﬁling actions that bring deﬁlement upon themselves 
(Lev 11:44);
4. a sanctiﬁed person declares that the person who is presumed to be in an 
unclean state or condition is actually in a state of cultic deﬁlement 
(Lev 13:3, 8, 11, 15, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 44, 59).
In the ﬁrst three instances, it is clear that the Piel, when referring to bringing
deﬁlement upon a person, always means that it occurs because the one doing
the deﬁling is also deﬁled in some way. In other words, it is not used in the
sense of an undeﬁled person’s performing an act that deﬁles the other person
exclusively or causes the other person to deﬁle only him- or herself. Nor is it
used for an act of judgment upon another that results in the judged person’s
being in a state of uncleanness.
The fourth example is distinct, because it refers to a cultic pronouncement
rather than an action that produces deﬁlement. In other words, the priest does
not bring deﬁlement upon the person, nor does the action of the priest make
the person unclean. The priest is making a cultic declaration based on the pre-
existing condition of the person.
27. The only comparable expression in Ezekiel in which Yahweh is the subject is in
24:21, in which he profanes (llj) his sanctuary in an act of judgment. But there the object
is a thing rather than a person.

Of these uses of the Piel, the one that most appropriately ﬁts Ezek 20:26 is
the one in Leviticus 13 (example #4). Understood in this way, 20:26 is stating
that Yahweh is declaring the people to be ritually unclean and thereby unﬁt to
worship him in his sanctuary. The “being unclean” is therefore not what Yah-
weh has caused them to be, nor is it something that Yahweh has done to them,
but it is a consequence of what the people themselves have done.
In v. 18, the generation under discussion (vv. 18–26) was instructed ‘not to
deﬁle themselves (Hithpael) with their ancestors’ idols’ (wamft la µhylwlgbw).
Although the speciﬁc terminology of deﬁlement is not echoed in vv. 21 and
24, as the people are adjudged guilty, deﬁlement is clearly implied because
v. 24 declares that “their eyes were after the idols of their ancestors.”28 The
question in v. 30, where Ezekiel asks his contemporaries whether they will de-
ﬁle themselves (Niphal of amf) in the manner of their ancestors, also makes it
clear that the previous generations had indeed deﬁled themselves through
their worship of idols. In v. 26, Yahweh afﬁrms this condition by making an
ofﬁcial cultic declaration, implying that the people will bear all the conse-
quences of deﬁlement.
Understanding amfaw in v. 26 as an act that involves divine speech ﬁts the
context well. Repeated in the historical retrospect of vv. 5–29 is the emphasis
on divine speech (vv. 5, 6, 7, 15, 18; also implicit in the “giving” of vv. 11, 12,
25). As a verbal pronouncement afﬁrming deﬁlement, v. 26 provides the coun-
terpoint to the voiced command for the people not to deﬁle themselves in vv. 7
and 18. Also as an act of divine communication, v. 26 parallels the divine pro-
nouncements of judgment in vv. 23 and 25, with all three verses citing negative
consequences for the people. The parallel sequence could be paraphrased as
follows: “I verbally swore that I would scatter them” // “I spoke decrees (of
punishment) . . . and judgments” // “I ofﬁcially pronounced you unclean.”
The reason for the declaration of deﬁlement is speciﬁcally cited in the fol-
lowing prepositional phrases: µjr rfp lk ryb[hb µtwntmb ‘on account of
their gifts, on account of (their) passing through all (the) ﬁrstborn’. In this
chapter, one of the key issues related to the people’s disobedience is idolatry
(see vv. 7, 8, 16, 18, 24, 28–29, 30–31, 32, 39). This contextual emphasis sug-
gests an identical cultic setting for the people’s actions in v. 26. Clearly v. 26 is
literarily linked to v. 31, which also uses the term twntm ‘gifts’, the expression
ryb[h ‘pass through’ with respect to children,29 and the concept of deﬁlement
28. See the similar command and indictment for the generation in Egypt in vv. 7–8 and
the similar indictment against the ﬁrst generation in the wilderness in v. 16.
29. In v. 31, the LXX lacks the phrase vab µkynb ryb[hb.Thus some commentators
consider it an addition in the MT based on v. 26 (see G. Cook, A Critical and Exegetical Com-
mentary on the Book of Ezekiel [ICC; Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1970] 220; John Wevers,

(amf). In v. 31 the object to whom the gifts and child sacriﬁces are given is
the idols. Also, through the term twntm there is a literary link between vv. 26,
31, and 39, where again the “gifts” are given to idols. Thus the speciﬁc terms
in v. 26 literarily foreshadow their later appearances in vv. 31 and 39 and con-
sequently can also be understood as offerings given to the idols, not to Yahweh.
Interpreting the gifts and child sacriﬁces in v. 26 as being given to the idols
is consistent with all of the other references to child sacriﬁce in Ezekiel, where
idols are the objects of these offerings: in 16:20–21 the indirect object is the
rkz ymlx ‘male images’ in 16:17; in 16:36, 20:31, as well as 23:37 and 39, it is
their µylwlg ‘idols’. Although no indirect object is given in 20:26, to under-
stand the child sacriﬁces as being given to Yahweh would be an anomaly.
The understanding of the gifts and offerings of the ﬁrstborn as being to idols
is also consistent with the use of amf ‘to deﬁle’ in chap. 20. The word is only
used in this chapter when speaking of idols (see vv. 7, 18, 30, 31, 4330), not
when describing violations of other covenant stipulations. When other cove-
nant violations are referred to (see vv. 8, 13, 16, 21, 24), distinctive terminol-
ogy (‘rebel’ hrm, ‘not walk in’ . . . b ˚lh al, ‘reject’ sam, ‘profane’ llj, ‘not
keep’ rmv al, or ‘not do’ hc[ al) is used,31 but never amf. Thus, in v. 26, the
use of amf points toward Yahweh’s declaration of deﬁlement as resulting not
from acts of worship directed to him, but because of their gifts and offerings
of children to idols.
As previously noted, the language in v. 26, µjr rfp ryb[h, echoes the di-
vine statute about the dedication of the ﬁrstborn in Exod 13:12 (lk trb[hw
hwhyl µjr rfp). This deliberate literary echoing serves to highlight the levels
of irony between that statute and the people’s actions and perceptions referred
to here. First, whereas in Exodus 13 the ﬁrstborn were to be dedicated to Yah-
weh, Ezekiel’s fellow Judahites had been giving their children to the idols.
Second, whereas in Exod 13:12–13 (also 34:19–20) Yahweh demanded the
redemption of the ﬁrstborn of humans, implying that the actual sacriﬁce of hu-
mans was repulsive to him, the Judahites were not performing any redemption
30. Although the “deﬁling” in v. 43 is tied to the more general “ways” and “deeds” of
the people, the speciﬁc indictments in the preceding context (vv. 32 and 39) are only for
serving idols.
31. See also the same terminology in the positive command of v. 19.
Ezekiel, 119; Walther Zimmerli, Ezekiel 1 [trans. Ronald Clements; Hermeneia; Philadel-
phia: Fortress, 1979] 402). But the LXX has also (mis)interpreted the reference in v. 26
(µjr rfp lk ryb[hb) as a divine act of judgment (“when I pass through upon every one
that opens the womb”), rather than an indictment of the people’s activity of child sacriﬁce.
Once the phrase was understood in that way by the LXX translator in v. 26, it was not logi-
cal to translate the similar phrase in v. 31 that way, because such a meaning would then
make no sense.

but were actually sacriﬁcing their children to the idols, presumably because
they thought the idols required or preferred it.
Ezek 20:26 places the activity of child sacriﬁce to idols during the period of
the wilderness sojourn of the second generation after the Exodus. Elsewhere,
child sacriﬁce is only attested among the Israelites after they were in the land
(see Ps 106:34–39), with speciﬁc instances being cited during the period of
the monarchy (see 2 Kgs 17:17).32 Just as the historical recitation of chap. 20
temporally carries the sin of idol worship back into Egypt prior to the Exodus,
so too v. 26 indicates that practices such as child sacriﬁces had antecedents that
predated the entrance into the land. The lack of attestation elsewhere for the
practice during the wilderness period need not mean that Ezekiel has fabri-
cated this detail, for he may have drawn on a tradition no longer extant to us.33
The rhetorically intended purpose for the decrees and judgments in v. 25
(referring back to the oath in v. 23) and the divine pronouncement of the
people as unclean in v. 26a is given in v. 26b through the twofold ˆ[ml ‘so
that’. The intended result was for them ‘to be horriﬁed’ µmv. Although at
times this is translated ‘to devastate them’, in the sense of an imposed judg-
ment, it should not be understood as physical destruction34 but as an emo-
tional result. When the Hiphil of µmv has a person as the accusative it clearly
has an emotional connotation;35 thus it means to bring about emotional and
psychological devastation, “to cause to be appalled,” as in Ezek 32:10. This
contrasts with a situation in which a place is in the accusative, in which case
“to devastate” refers to physical desolation, as in Ezek 30:12 and 14 (see also
Lev 26:31, 32). Although what they will be horriﬁed at is not speciﬁed here,
whether the horrendous judgment inﬂicted or their horriﬁc sins that brought
about the punishment, it is probably the latter, because of the fairly frequent
32. During the reign of Ahaz: 2 Kgs 16:3, 2 Chr 28:3; during the reign of Manasseh:
2 Kgs 21:6, 2 Chr 33:6; an issue dealt with in the reforms of Josiah: 2 Kgs 23:10; as a prac-
tice during the latter days of Judah: Jer 7:31, 19:5, 32:35. The only earlier example of hu-
man sacriﬁce may be Jephthah’s vow and its fulﬁllment in Judg 11:30–31 and 39, if one
understands it to be the actual sacriﬁce of his daughter.
33. The prohibitions of Lev 18:21, Deut 12:31, and 18:10 are rhetorically placed in the
context of the wilderness legislation (see Lev 18:3, Deut 12:29, and 18:9, respectively) as
part of the delineation of practices performed by the Egyptians and the Canaanites that the
Israelites were not to appropriate. Although none of these passages accuses the Israelites of
performing child sacriﬁces during this period, and clearly the dating of this practice even
among the other peoples is dependent on when one dates these pieces of legislation, never-
theless the prohibitions may reﬂect a tradition of the Israelites’ awareness of these practices
while in Egypt and prior to their entrance into the land.

occurrence of that motif in Ezekiel. This is precisely the rhetorical purpose
cited in vv. 43–44 to be achieved through the restoration to the land: the
people will remember (rkz) their ways and deeds through which they have de-
ﬁled themselves (Niphal of amf) and will loathe themselves (µynpb fwq). A
similar rhetorical purpose is cited in 6:8–10 and 7:16–18 with respect to the
acts of judgment, and in 16:54, 61, 63; 36:31–32, and 43:10–11 with respect
to divine acts of restoration. The events of judgment and restoration are de-
signed to produce within people a remembering (rkz) of and groaning (hmh)
over their sins that will result in emotional responses of shame (vwb), dismay
(µlk), and a loathing of themselves (µynpb fwq). Although the speciﬁc termi-
nology of µmv is not used in any of these other passages, clearly the intended
rhetorical outcome is the same. Thus the aim of Yahweh’s actions in vv. 25–
26a is to shock the people into recognizing the severity of the evil they have
done.
A second purpose is to produce within the people a recognition of Yah-
weh: hwhy yna rva w[dy rça ˆ[ml ‘so that they will know that I am Yahweh’.
Whereas the ﬁrst purpose is focused on the people’s view of what they have
done, with the production of a negative attitude toward it, this second purpose
is positive in that it focuses the people’s attention on who Yahweh is. Al-
though a number of commentators have deleted this phrase as a secondary
addition,36 caution should be exercised in doing so, given that in 20:43–44
and 6:8–10 the recognition formula is also coupled with declarations that the
people would experience shame for their sins.
The interpretation of 20:25–26 proposed here is consistent with both the
literary context and the terminology and grammatical forms used elsewhere in
the book.
(1) The use of the generic masculine plural (µyqj ‘decrees’) in v. 25 indi-
cates that those decrees refer not to the covenantal laws, which are elsewhere
indicated through a feminine plural with ﬁrst-person possessive sufﬁx and in
vv. 11, 13, and 21 are viewed as being life-giving.
(2) The structural connections between vv. 23–24 and 25–26 suggest that
the decrees and judgments of the latter refer back to the divine judgment of
exile in v. 23. It is then the divine declarations of impending judgment that are
“not good” and that result in “death” to the nation.
(3) The grammatical construction of amfaw . . . yttn ‘I gave . . . and I de-
ﬁled’ should be read as two coordinated acts, akin to the grammatical con-
struction in v. 23, which cites two divine acts by using inﬁnitives. Thus, in
v. 26, the conjunction on amfaw does not introduce a result or purpose clause.
36. Ibid., 219; Zimmerli Ezekiel 1, 401.

36
(4) The best comparable use of the Piel of amf ‘deﬁle’ is found in Leviticus
13. In Ezek 20:26, Yahweh is “declaring the people unclean,” just as the priest
made a declaration regarding the person with a skin disease in Leviticus.
(5) The reason for the decrees of judgment and the declaration of the people
as deﬁled are the consequences of the people’s gifts and child sacriﬁces. The
literary links to the subsequent verses (31 and 39) suggest that these offerings
by the people were not to Yahweh; rather, they were to idols.
Thus vv. 25–26 are best rendered:
And also I gave them decrees [regarding their dispersion and scattering] that
were not good and judgments [of punishment] by which they would not have
life. And I declared them deﬁled on account of their gifts [to their idols], on
account of offering [by ﬁre to idols] all [their] ﬁrstborn, so that I would cause
them to be horriﬁed, so that they would know that I am Yahweh.

Ellipsis Involving Negation in Biblical Poetry
Cynthia L. Miller
University of Wisconsin–Madison
1.0
Introduction
Ellipsis involves words that are not phonologically present, but whose ex-
istence is understood by speakers and hearers, as well as writers and readers. In
(1), for example, only the ﬁrst instance of the verb is phonologically realized;
in the second line the verb is equally present, though it is neither spoken nor
heard:
(1) Isa 1:271
Zion by justice shall be redeemed
hdpt fpvmb ˆwyx
and her repentant ones by righteousness [shall be redeemed].
hqdxb hybvw
In this case, it is relatively easy to determine that the second line is elliptical.
Ellipsis has deleted a required element in the sentence, resulting in the frag-
mentation of the surface syntax: ‘and her repentant ones by righteousness’ is
not a complete sentence. The hearer or reader must restore the missing verb
on the basis of the previous sentence, which has identical constituents as well
as the missing verb.
Ellipsis involving negation, however, is far more problematic, because the
deletion of a negative particle does not result in fragmentation of the surface
syntax. Consider (2):
1. In translations of biblical examples involving ellipsis, underlining indicates the ante-
cedent(s). Material that has been deleted by ellipsis is italicized and enclosed in square
brackets.
Author’s note: The research included in this paper is part of a larger work in preparation on
ellipsis in Biblical Hebrew. I am grateful to my senior colleague, Michael Fox, for many
stimulating discussions on ellipsis, especially in Proverbs. Michael Patrick O’Connor, Rob-
ert D. Holmstedt, and John A. Cook provided insightful comments on an earlier draft of
this essay. Kevin Chau, my graduate student and project assistant for 2002–4, assisted with
data collection and checking. This research was supported in part by the Graduate School
of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture,
and the Ettinger Family Foundation.

b. and I have not given birth,
ytdlyAalw
c. and I have not reared young men,
µyrwjb ytldg alw
d. I have [not] brought up young women.
twlwtb ytmmwr
The three clauses in (a), (b), and (c) are each explicitly negated with al. The
clause in (d) must also be understood as negated, although no trace of the
negative remains in the surface structure.
Another example is found in (3):
(3) Ps 38:2
O Lord, do not in your anger rebuke me,
ynjykwt ˚pxqbAla hwhy
and [do not] in your wrath discipline me.
ynrsyt ˚tmjbw
On the level of poetics, the two lines are “synonymously” parallel. The second
line is understood as negated, although no negative marker is present.
Ellipsis involving negation, then, is a particularly troublesome phenome-
non. Deletion of a negative does not leave any detectable trace in the surface
structure, but it reverses the semantic polarity of the sentence. It is probably
for this reason that ellipsis of the negative is quite unusual in biblical poetry.
Ordinarily, if both lines are negative, an explicit indicator of negation is pres-
ent in both lines, as in (4):
(4) Isa 5:12
And the doing of the Lord they do not 
wfyby al hwhy l[p taw
acknowledge,
and the work of his hands they do not see.
war al wydy hc[mw
Nonetheless, because ellipsis of the negative is possible, it is very important to
know the extent to which negatives can be elided in biblical poetry and how
to recognize, or at least suspect, that this elision has taken place.
In this essay I discuss the interplay of negation and ellipsis in biblical poetry.
I describe the various kinds of ellipsis that are attested and provide a prelimi-
nary description of the syntactic environments within which ellipsis of the
negative is possible.2
2. The research for this paper involved an exhaustive analysis of negative ellipsis involv-
ing al in Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, The Twelve, Lamentations, and Song of Songs; addi-
tional examples from elsewhere in the biblical text are included where relevant. Three
kinds of elliptical constructions involving negation are excluded. First, rhetorical questions
introduced with alh (e.g., Ps 139:21, Joel 1:16) are excluded from consideration, because

Syntactic Preliminaries
2.1
Negation in Biblical Hebrew
Linguists distinguish two types of negation—constituent negation, in
which only a constituent is negated, and sentential negation, in which the en-
tire proposition of the sentence is negated.3 Both types of negation are present
in Hebrew. Constituent negation in Hebrew is less common than in English,
but it is attested, as illustrated in (5):4
(5) Jer 22:13—constituent negation
Woe to the one who builds his house with 
qdxAalb wtyb hnb ywh
unrighteousness
and his upper chambers with injustice.
fpvm alb wytwyl[w
Constituent negation does not interact with elliptical processes and thus will
not be discussed further here.5
Sentential negation involves negative particles such as al, la, ˆya, and lb,
as well as the negatives used for negating subordinate clauses: ytlbl and ˆp. In
prose, sentential negation requires an explicit indicator of negation for each
negated predication, as in (6):6

A. Fodor and Jerrold J. Katz; Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1964) 246–323. For
difﬁculties in distinguishing sentential negation from constituent negation in English, see

“Negation,” in Language Typology and Syntactic Description (ed. Timothy Shopen; 3 vols.;
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985) 1:197–242.
4. For a list of instances involving constituent negation, see GKC §152a n. 1 and Bruce
K. Waltke and M. O’Connor, Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax (Winona Lake, Ind.: Ei-
senbrauns, 1990) 661 n. 59. Waltke and O’Connor refer to constituent negation as “item
negation” (§39.3.2).
5. However, in some cases (e.g., Isa 31:8, 45:18, 55:1; Zech 14:7), it is difﬁcult to know
whether constituent negation is involved or whether all of a sentence except for one con-
stituent has been deleted (as described in §3.3 below).
6. JM §160q lists some exceptions, but the prose examples (Exod 28:43; Lev 22:9, 15–
16) are dubious in that they relate to conditional sentences within pentateuchal regula-
tions. Two other exceptional cases can be mentioned. In Jer 26:19, alh occurs at the begin-
ning of a series of verbs; the construction seems to mean: ‘Isn’t it the case that . . .’ (see also
semantically they do not involve negation. Second, ellipsis involving verbless clauses is also
excluded here, although preliminarily I note that ellipsis can involve either the subject con-
stituent (e.g., Ps 75:7) or the predicate constituent (e.g., Prov 18:5). Third, ellipsis involv-
ing a deictic pro-element (such as ˆk in Ps 1:4) is excluded.

(6) 1 Sam 12:4—sentential negation in prose (each verb negated)
hmwam vyaAdym tjqlAalw wntwxr alw wntqv[ al wrmayw

They said, “You have not defrauded us, and you have not
oppressed us, and you have not taken from anyone 
anything.”
b. (cf. English) They said, “You have not defrauded us, oppressed us, or 
taken†anything from anyone.”
In English, unlike Hebrew, it is possible to delete the repeated negative as in
(b), where each verb is understood as negated, but only the initial verb is pre-
ceded by an explicit marker of negation.
The requirement in Hebrew that each verb “bear the burden of its own ne-
gation” is usually followed in biblical poetry as well; ordinarily the negative is
repeated with each predication, as we saw in (4) above.7 Ellipsis of the nega-
tive, as exempliﬁed in (2) and (3), is thus an unusual phenomenon, even in
biblical poetry.
Another feature of negation in Hebrew involves the placement of the
negative marker. In both prose and poetry, the negative marker must always
appear before the verb (it can never appear after the verb), and usually it appears
immediately before the verb.8 This syntactic fact will play an important role in
the discussion concerning ambiguity of negative ellipsis in §3.4 below.
2.2
Ellipsis in Biblical Hebrew
As noted above (§1.0), ellipsis involves words that are “missing” but yet un-
derstood by speakers and hearers. We can reﬁne this description of ellipsis by
7. As O’Connor observes: “The rule that every verb must bear the burden of its own
negation is rarely contravened by gapping and in our corpus there are no examples of nega-
tive gapping” (M. O’Connor, Hebrew Verse Structure [Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns,
1980] 406). O’Connor mentions Deut 32:6cd as a possible exception, but that example in-
volves a rhetorical use of alh.
8. This fact concerning the placement of the negative marker with respect to the verb
in Biblical Hebrew reﬂects the most prominent pattern of negation cross-linguistically
(Ö. Dahl, “Typology of Sentence Negation,” Linguistics 17 [1979] 79–106). In addition,
Biblical Hebrew has syntactic negation (i.e., it uses an uninﬂected negative particle) rather
than morphological negation.
Jer 22:15). In Amos 9:10, the negative is gapped and the verbs share a subject: vygtAal
h[rh wnyd[b µydqtw ‘The evil will not draw near and will [not] meet us’. Interestingly, the
noun phrase that serves as subject of both verbs follows the second verb, though it is hard
to know what to make of that fact. Compare Isa 48:19, which has no ellipsis and the subject
intervenes between the verb and the prepositional phrase (i.e., in the middle of the verb
phrase).

stating that ellipsis is a syntactic phenomenon that involves the deletion of a
required element.9 With this deﬁnition, I am excluding verses that involve the
distribution of the constituents of a clause across multiple poetic lines without
any evident fragmentation in the surface syntax.10 Consider (7):
(7) Prov 8:26
When he had not made the earth, and the ﬁelds,
twxwjw ≈ra hc[ alAd[
and the beginning of the dust of the world.
lbt twrp[ varw
The object consists of three conjoined noun phrases. If this sentence were en-
countered in prose, we would not consider it to have a structural hole or gap.11
Similarly excluded are instances in which the constituent in the second line
is appositional to the ﬁnal constituent in the ﬁrst line, as in (8):
(8) Jer 31:7
Save, O Lord, your people,
˚m[Ata hwhy [vwh
the remnant of Israel.
larcy tyrav ta
The noun phrase ‘the remnant of Israel’ is in apposition to ‘your people’.12

lipsis,” in The Handbook of Contemporary Semantic Theory (ed. Shalom Lappin; Oxford:
Blackwell, 1996) 145–75; and Chris Wilder, “Some Properties of Ellipsis in Coordination,”
in Studies on Universal Grammar and Typological Variation (ed. Artemis Alexiadou and T. Alan
Hall; Linguistik Aktuell 13; Amsterdam: Benjamins, 1997) 59–107. For discussions from

ﬁeld: JSOT Press, 1984) 303–6; Paul E. Dion, Hebrew Poetics (2nd ed.; Mississauga: Ben-
ben, 1992) 14–16; and my “Linguistic Approach to Ellipsis in Biblical Poetry: Or, What to
Do When Exegesis of What Is There Depends on What Isn’t,” BBR 13 (2003) 251–70.
10. For additional examples, see Zech 12:7 (with coordinate subjects), Prov 8:26 (with
coordinate objects), and Amos 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6 (with coordinate prepositional
phrases).
11. I acknowledge that many generative linguists would consider these structures to be
formed through deletion of underlying coordinate structures. Example (7) would be under-
stood to have three underlying coordinate sentences: [he had not made the earth] [he had not
made the ﬁelds] [he had not made the beginning of the dust of the world]. Conjunction reduction
factors out the identical subjects and verbs to produce a single sentence: [he had not made
[[the earth] and [the ﬁelds] and [the beginning of the dust of the world]]]. (Following linguistic con-
vention, I use square brackets to indicate constituent boundaries.) Similarly, it is possible to
understand appositional phrases, such as those in (8) below, as derived from underlyingly
coordinate structures: [save, O Lord, your people] [save, O Lord, the remnant of Israel] § [save,
O Lord, [[your people] [the remnant of Israel]].
12. For additional examples, see Ps 91:5 (with appositional prepositional phrases) and
Lam 4:12 (with appositional subjects).

Ellipsis is possible only when three conditions are met.13 First, ellipsis op-
erates on coordinate structures. In Biblical Hebrew poetry, conjoined lines
with identical syntax may be coordinated explicitly with the conjunction waw,
as in (9):
(9) Ps 88:13
Are your wonders made known in darkness,
˚alp ˚vjb [dwyh
and [is] your righteousness in the land of oblivion
hyvn ≈rab ˚tqdxw
 [made known]?
However, in the syntactically identical verse in (10), waw does not occur. In-
stead, the lines are asyndetically coordinate; that is, they are conjoined without
an overt conjunction.
(10) Ps 88:12
Is your faithfulness recounted in the grave,
˚dsj rbqb rpsyh
[is] your constancy in Abaddon [recounted]?
ˆwdbab ˚tnwma
In both (9) and (10), the two lines are syntactically coordinate; ellipsis of the
verb has operated in each.
The requirement that ellipsis operate on coordinate structures is important
because it tells us, for example, that we should not expect ellipsis to occur
from a main clause to a subordinate clause. And this is, in fact, the case in Bib-
lical Hebrew. We do not ﬁnd sentences such as:
(11) Unattested sentence (ellipsis from main clause to subordinate clause)
Zion by justice shall be redeemed (hdpt),
so that (ˆ[ml) her repentant ones by righteousness [might be redeemed (wdpy)].
Ellipsis, then, is possible between two lines (a bicolon) within biblical verse
only when the lines are coordinate, with each line comprising a clausal con-
junct. Not all bicola meet this requirement. Furthermore, ellipsis is possible
within a single line of poetry, if it contains two coordinate clauses. As a result,
the syntactic contexts within which ellipsis occurs do not necessarily corre-
spond to poetic lines.
A second requirement of ellipsis is that the two halves of the coordinate sen-
tence must correspond syntactically, though languages differ concerning the
nature of the correspondence. In Biblical Hebrew, this requirement usually
13. For a more detailed discussion, see my “Constraints on Ellipsis in Biblical Hebrew,”
in Papers on Semitic and Afroasiatic Linguistics in Honor of Gene B. Gragg (SAOC; Chicago:
The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, forthcoming).

Ellipsis Involving Negation in Biblical Poetry

means that the constituents in the two conjuncts match exactly. For example,
in (2), the constituents of conjuncts (c) and (d) are identical and occur in the
same order: verb, object. In (3), the clausal constituents of the two conjuncts
also match precisely: prepositional phrase, verb, object. Note that for the pur-
poses of ellipsis, the vocative does not count as a clausal constituent.14 Ellipsis
is possible in Hebrew when the constituents do not match precisely, under cer-
tain speciﬁable syntactic conditions, a point to which I will return below.15
A third requirement of ellipsis is that the item that is present and the item
that is deleted must be lexically identical—the deleted verb in (1) must be wdpy
(‘they will be redeemed’), the same lexical item that is present in the ﬁrst con-
junct, adjusted to agree in gender and number with the subject of the second
conjunct. When ellipsis involves negation, the requirement of lexical identity
means that the speciﬁc negative particle must be identical in both conjuncts.
For example, in (3), it is impossible to restore al as the negative particle that
has been deleted, even though in isolation ynrsyt, understood as an imperfect,
could be negated with al. Instead, the presence of la in the ﬁrst conjunct
means that we must understand la to be the item that is deleted from the sec-
ond conjunct.
A ﬁnal feature of ellipsis involves the direction of ellipsis. All of the Hebrew
examples we have looked at thus far involve forwards ellipsis, that is, an item
is present in the ﬁrst conjunct and is deleted from the second conjunct. The
opposite situation—when deletion occurs in the ﬁrst conjunct—is known as
backwards ellipsis. Backwards ellipsis in Biblical Hebrew is highly constrained.
Backwards ellipsis of constituents is possible only from ﬁnal position in the
clause, as in (12):16
14. Similarly, O’Connor considers the vocative to be “extraneous” to the clause (O’Con-
nor, Hebrew Verse Structure, 79–81), and McCawley views the vocative as “extrasentential,”
that is, it is not a syntactic constituent of the host sentence ( James D. McCawley, The Syn-
tactic Phenomena of English [2 vols.; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988] 2:763–64).
15. Two conditions will be mentioned brieﬂy. First, within a ﬁnite clause a prepositional
phrase in one line may correspond to an adverbial phrase in the other line (see example [17]
below). Second, the constituent structures may match only as far as a clause boundary
within the line. For example, in Mic 7:1, the existential predicate ˆya has been elided from
the beginning of the second line: yvpn htwa hrwkb lwkal lwkvaAˆya ‘There is no grape
cluster to eat / [there is no] ripe ﬁg (that) my soul desires’. The two lines match only at the
highest syntactic level; they differ in that the subject in the ﬁrst line (lwkva) is modiﬁed by
an inﬁnitival clause, whereas the subject in the second line (hrwkb) is modiﬁed by an un-
marked relative clause.
16. This observation about backwards ellipsis corresponds to what we know about el-
lipsis cross-linguistically. Languages that allow backwards ellipsis, such as Russian, do so
from ﬁnal position. For example, Russian allows both forwards and backwards gapping of

Cynthia L. Miller

(12) Ps 94:3
How long [will] the wicked [exult], O Lord,
hwhy µy[vr ytmAd[
how long will the wicked exult?
wzl[y µy[vr ytmAd[
Recall that the vocative does not count as a clausal constituent; underlyingly
the two conjuncts have identical constituents (prepositional phrase, subject,
verb). The verb is in ﬁnal position in the second conjunct and has gapped
backwards into the ﬁrst conjunct. Backwards ellipsis is unusual, but possible,
in Biblical Hebrew when the constituents of both conjuncts match exactly and
the constituent to be deleted is in ﬁnal position.17
With this introduction, I will now examine the ways in which ellipsis and
negation interact in biblical poetry. To simplify the presentation, I will con-
centrate on the most frequent type of ellipsis: al in ﬁnite verbal clauses.
3.0
Description of Ellipsis and Negation
Sentential negation intersects with ellipsis of verbal constituents in a limited
number of patterns.18 In the ﬁrst pattern (§3.1), the verb or verb phrase19 is
17. Purported instances of backwards ellipsis of the verb from non-ﬁnal position can be
understood in alternative ways; three such instances will be mentioned brieﬂy. In Prov 13:1,
the ﬁrst conjunct should be understood as a verbless clause, rather than an elliptical sen-
tence; see the discussion in my “Linguistic Approach to Ellipsis in Biblical Poetry,” 258,
267–68. Ps 91:9 can be understood without ellipsis, following the njpsv: “Because you
took the Lord—my refuge, the Most High—as your haven,” rather than as an instance of
medial backwards ellipsis (pace M. Dahood, Psalms I: 101–150 [AB 17a; Garden City,
N.Y.: Doubleday, 1970] 435). Finally, the verb bbE/ny] in the second half of Zech 9:17 should
be understood as being embedded within an unmarked relative clause rather than as the
antecedent of medial backwards ellipsis (following the analysis of Arnold B. Ehrlich, Rand-
glossen zur Hebräischen Bibel [reprint; Hildesheim: Olms, 1968] 5:344).
18. Excluded from consideration are cases where the negative serves as an echo reply to
a yes-no question (with the original proposition elided in the reply); see Isa 30:16; Amos 6:10;
Hag 2:12; Zech 4:5, 13. The use is identical to that in prose (see Num 22:30, Judg 12:5).
verbs: (a) forwards gapping: Ja citaju naucnuju stat’ju, a on ___ detektiv ‘I read a scientiﬁc ar-
ticle, and he ___ a detective novel’; or Ja naucnuju stat’ju citaju, a on detektiv ___ ‘I a scientiﬁc
article read, and he a detective novel ___’; (b) backwards gapping: Ja naucnuju stat’ju ___, a
on detektiv citaet ‘I a scientiﬁc article ___, and he a detective novel read’. (The examples are
from Robert R. van Oirsouw, The Syntax of Coordination [Croom Helm Linguistics Series;
London: Croom Helm, 1987] 122.) Note that, when the Russian verb is in ﬁnal position
in its clause, either forwards or backwards gapping is possible; with the verb in non-ﬁnal
position, only forwards gapping occurs.
Ugaritic is similar to Hebrew in that it allow backwards ellipsis only from the ends of
lines; see my article “Patterns of Verbal Ellipsis in Ugaritic,” UF 31 (1999–2000) 333–72.

deleted from one conjunct, but the negative appears in both conjuncts. In the
second pattern (§3.2), the negative is deleted with the verb or verb phrase
from one conjunct. In the third pattern (§3.3), all of a conjunct is deleted ex-
cept for one constituent, which is preceded by the negative. In the fourth pat-
tern (§3.4), the negative is deleted from a conjunct without the verb or verb
phrase that it negates.
3.1
Ellipsis of Verb or Verb Phrase Out of Conjoined Negated Clauses
In the ﬁrst pattern, two negative sentences are conjoined and a verbal con-
stituent is deleted. In (13), the verb phrase (the verb and its object) are elided
out of a negated sentence:
(13) Ps 115:17
The dead do not praise the Lord,
hyAwllhy µytmh al
and those who go down into silence do not
hmwd ydryAlk alw
 [praise the Lord].
The second conjunct has only the negative particle and the subject. This kind
of ellipsis is not difﬁcult to recognize and interpret because ellipsis has frag-
mented the syntax in the second clause; it is also quite rare.
3.2
Ellipsis of Negative and Verb (Phrase)
In the second construction, both the negative particle and the verb are de-
leted, as in (14):20
(14) Ps 1:5
Therefore the wicked will not stand in 
fpvmb µy[vr wmqyAal ˆkAl[
the judgment,
and sinners [will not stand] in the congregation 
µyqydx td[b µyafjw
of the righteous.
19. Following linguistic practice, I will use “verb phrase” to refer to the verb and its ob-
ject or adjunct(s). In Modern Hebrew (as in English), VP-ellipsis (i.e., ellipsis of the verb
phrase) differs from ellipsis of the bare verb (see Edith Doron, “V-Movement and VP El-
lipsis,” in Fragments: Studies in Ellipsis and Gapping [ed. Shalom Lappin and Elabbas Ben-
mamoun; New York: Oxford University Press, 1999] 124–40). Biblical Hebrew does not
display a similar differentiation between ellipsis of the verb phrase and the verb.
20. Analogous examples are not grammatical in English. The sentence I didn’t eat ﬁsh,
Bill didn’t eat rice, and Harry didn’t eat beef cannot undergo gapping to produce the sentence
*I didn’t eat ﬁsh, Bill rice, and Harry roast beef ( John Robert Ross, “Gapping and the Order
of Constituents,” in Progress in Linguistics: A Collection of Papers [ed. Manfred Bierwisch and
Karl Erich Heidolph; Janua Linguarum Series Maior 43; The Hague: Mouton, 1970] 250).

In this type of ellipsis, the negative marker is always immediately adjacent to
the verb, and the constituent structures of the two conjuncts match. In (14),
the constituents of both conjuncts match precisely—the two clausal conjuncts
have the constituents verb, subject, prepositional phrase. (Note that the con-
junction ˆkAl[ governs both clauses; it is not part of the ﬁrst conjunct.) As il-
lustrated in (15), however, matching constituent structure means identical
syntactic relations at the highest level of the sentence:
(15) Prov 19:10
Luxury is not ﬁtting for a fool,
gwn[t lyskl hwanAal
even more, ruling over princes [is not ﬁtting] 
µyrcb lvm db[lAyk πa
for a slave.
The inﬁnitival phrase µyrcb lvm (‘to rule over princes’) functions as the sub-
ject of the second conjunct; both conjuncts have identical constituent struc-
tures: verb, prepositional phrase, subject.
Usually this construction exhibits explicit coordination between the two
conjuncts, with waw, as in (14), or with another conjunction, as in (15). Less
frequently, the two conjuncts are asyndetic, as in (16):
(16) Ps 50:9
I will not accept from your house a bull,
rp ˚tybm jqaAal
[I will not accept] from your ﬂocks goats.
µydwt[ ˚ytalkmm
Chiastic order of constituents is also possible, as in (17), although it is rare:
(17) Ps 121:6
By day the sun will not strike you,
hkkyAal vmvh µmwy
and the moon [will not strike you] in the night.
hlylb jryw
This example also illustrates another way in which the constituents in the con-
juncts may not be identical but still bear the same syntactic relationship to the
verb: the adverb µmwy and the prepositional phrase hlylb are both adverbial
modiﬁers of the verb phrase.21
To summarize, this second type of ellipsis has two syntactic requirements in
addition to matching constituent structures: the negative marker immediately
precedes the verb, and the negative plus verb are either at the very beginning
of the clause, as in (14), or at the end of the clause, as in (17).22
21. This example also illustrates that another constituent may be deleted along with the
negative particle + verb. Here the object is deleted.
22. For additional examples, see Ps 129:7 (the elliptical structure is inside a relative
clause), Isa 10:14 (the negative + hyh are gapped), 60:18; Hos 4:14; Joel 1:16; Prov 17:7,

Ellipsis Involving Negation in Biblical Poetry
47
3.3
Ellipsis of Everything Except One Constituent
In the third construction, ellipsis deletes everything except one constituent
in the second conjunct.23 The remaining constituent semantically contrasts
with its counterpart in the other conjunct:24
(18) Hos 6:6
For loyalty I desire,
ytxpj dsj yk
and [I do] not [desire] sacriﬁce (or, and it it not sacriﬁce
jbzAalw
 [(that) I desire]).
The two objects (‘loyalty’, ‘sacriﬁce’) are contrastive: one God desires, one he
does not. Note that, on semantic grounds, the phrase jbz al cannot be under-
stood as constituent negation (‘I desire non-sacriﬁce’) but rather involves sen-
tential negation of the elided verb.
Ellipsis of this sort typically involves a contrast between the objects of the
verb (as just discussed) or a prepositional phrase, as in (19):
(19) Hos 8:4
They set up kings
wkylmh µh
but [they did] not [set up kings] from me 
ynmm alw
(or, and it it not from me [(that) they set up kings]).
This type of ellipsis is used to afﬁrm the proposition of a sentence while ne-
gating a portion of the sentence that is in contrastive focus. In Biblical He-
brew, the two conjuncts in this construction are explicitly coordinated with
waw as in (18), except when more than one sentence serves as the antecedent
of the deleted portion. This exceptional case is illustrated in (20), where the
two conjuncts are asyndetically coordinate:25
(20) Isa 45:13
a. he will build my city
yry[ hnbyAawh
b. and my exiles he will release
jlvy ytwlgw
c. not for a price [he will build my city/he will release my exiles]
ryjmb al
d. and not for a reward [he will build my city/he will release 
djvb alw
my exiles]
23. In generative linguistics this elliptical process is referred to as “stripping” (see Mc-
Cawley, The Syntactic Phenomena of English, 2:527) or “bare argument ellipsis.”
24. Other examples include: Ps 100:3; Isa 29:9; 30:1; 45:13; 48:7, 10; 51:21; Hos 8:4;
Lam 3:2; Prov 31:12. When the ﬁrst sentence is negated, the contrastive elided sentence is
introduced with µa yk (see Jer 3:10).
25. See also Isa 48:1.
19:10. Qim˙i correctly recognized Isa 42:8 as involving ellipsis of negative plus verb (Wil-
liam Chomsky, David Kim˙i’s Hebrew Grammar [Mikhhol] [New York: Bloch, 1952] 357).

Both (c) and (d) consist of the negative plus a prepositional phrase, and they
are related both to (a) and to (b).26 The lack of an explicit conjunction be-
tween (b) and (c) is a result of larger concerns: (a) and (b) are conjoined par-
allel clauses and form the antecedent clauses; (c) and (d) are conjoined parallel
clauses and form the elided clauses.27
In one remarkable example of this category of ellipsis, the direction of el-
lipsis is not forwards but backwards:
(21) Ps 115:1
a. Not to us [give glory], O Lord,
hwhy wnl al
b. not to us [give glory],
wnl al
c. but to your name give glory.
dwbk ˆt ˚mvlAyk
Here the verb and its object in (c) are in the third conjunct. Because these
constituents occur in ﬁnal position in their conjunct, backwards ellipsis is pos-
sible.28 The previous two conjuncts provide a contrast between giving glory
to ‘us’ and giving glory to God’s name.29 Each conjunct in (a) and (b) is a sen-
tence fragment; the verb phrase must be supplied from (c).
Ellipsis in this category, in which everything except one constituent is de-
leted, requires that the constituents of the two conjuncts match precisely. The
negative particle negates the elliptical conjunct.
26. O’Connor refers to this construction, in which four interrelated clauses appear to-
gether, as “mixing” (O’Connor, Hebrew Verse Structure, 421–22). A classic example is 2 Sam
1:20.
27. For evidence that conjuncts (c) and (d) must involve deletion of a verb (even though
we can translate ryjmb al and djvb al in English as ‘without price’ and ‘without reward’,
respectively), see Isa 55:1: wklw wlkaw wrbv wkl / πsk wlAˆya rvaw / µyml wkl amxAlk ywh
bljw ˆyy ryjm awlbw / πskAawlb wrbv ‘Ho, all who are thirsty, come to the water / and who-
ever does not have money, / come, buy and eat / come! buy without silver and without price
wine and milk’. The negative is within each prepositional phrase (πsk alb and ryjm alb)
rather than outside each prepositional phrase, as in Isa 45:13. Therefore, these are examples
of negated prepositional phrases.
28. The conjoined prepositional phrases at the end of the verse (˚tmaAl[ ˚dsjAl[)
should probably be understood as part of the preceding clause. In that case, they should be
considered to have elided backwards along with the verb and object (‘Do not to us [give
glory on account of your lovingkindness and faithfulness], but rather to your name give glory
on account of your lovingkindness and faithfulness’).
29. The form of the verb in (a) and (b) must be ˆtt. Although it is unusual for the
psalmist to use al with the imperfect in a command to God, the same construction occurs
in Ps 40:12: ynmm ˚ymjr alktAal hwhy hta ‘You, O Lord, do not withhold (imperfect)
your mercies from me . . .’.

Ellipsis Involving Negation in Biblical Poetry

3.4
Ellipsis Involving Deletion of the Negative but Not the Verb
We are now ready to examine the kind of ellipsis that is the most difﬁcult
to recognize, namely, ellipsis involving the deletion of a negative (but not the
verb) in the second conjunct. There are two syntactic requirements that must
be met before the negative particle can elide. The ﬁrst requirement is one that
is universally present in elliptical constructions—the constituent structures
must be identical.30 Example (22) illustrates identical constituents in the same
order in both conjuncts:
(22) Isa 38:18
a. For Sheol does not thank you,
˚dwt lwav al yk
b. death does [not] praise you;
˚llhy twm
c. those who go down to the Pit do not 
˚tmaAla rwbAydrwy wrbvyAal
hope for your faithfulness.
Ellipsis of the negative is possible in (b) because the clause has a constituent
structure identical to (a): subject, verb, object. Ellipsis of the negative is
blocked in (c) because of a different order of verb and subject. Other examples
with constituents in identical order are found in (2) and (3) above.31
The constituents may also be arranged in chiastic order, as in (23):32
(23) Ps 9:19
For the needy will not be forgotten forever,
ˆwyba jkvy jxnl al yk
the hope of the dejected will [not] perish forever.
d[l dbat µywn[ twqt
The conjuncts have constituents orders that are precisely chiastic—preposi-
tional phrase, verb, subject / subject, verb, prepositional phrase. The conjunc-
tion yk governs both conjuncts.
30. In Ps 131:2, al µa introduces a complex sentence that contrasts with the preceding
negative sentences in v. 1. The ﬁrst two clauses share an object; thus their constituent struc-
tures are identical underlyingly: ‘But rather I have stilled [my soul] and quieted my soul . . .’.
In rare cases, the constituent structures are not precisely identical. In Job 32:9, the ﬁrst con-
junct has an intransitive verb, whereas the second conjunct has a transitive one. The constit-
uent structures of the two conjuncts are: S V // S V O. The negative should be understood
as elided from the second conjunct.
31. See also Job 3:11.
32. See also Isa 28:27. In Ps 44:19, the constituents are partially chiastic. The verbal
constituents are initial in both conjuncts and the remaining constituents are chiastic.
O’Connor refers to this type of partial chiasm as a “back simple chiasm” (O’Connor, He-
brew Verse Structure, 394); he lists as additional examples Deut 33:26bc; Hab 3:13d, 14a; Ps
78:16ab, 26ab; 107:41ab.

The second syntactic requirement relates to the position of the negative
particle: the negative particle must appear at the head of the ﬁrst conjunct.
This is the case in (22) and (23) as well as in (2) and (3) above. In initial posi-
tion, the negative can be understood as having scope over both conjuncts.
This requirement means that ellipsis of the negative is not syntactically possible
in bicola such as (24) (the asterisk indicates a grammatically impossible inter-
pretation of the second line):
(24) Prov 28:5
Evil men do not know justice;
fpvm wnybyAal [rAyvna
and those who seek the Lord understand 
lk wnyby hwhy yvqbmw
everything.
*and those who seek the Lord [do not] understand everything.
Quite apart from the exegetical difﬁculties in understanding the second con-
junct as negated, the negative in the ﬁrst conjunct is not in initial position. As
a result, from a syntactic point of view, the negative cannot be understood as
having scope over the second conjunct.33
When these two syntactic requirements have been met, the main difﬁculty
in identifying whether ellipsis of the negative has taken place involves cases in
which the verb immediately follows the negative in initial position in the ﬁrst
conjunct. In (25), we understand the second line as negative on semantic (or,
exegetical) grounds:
(25) Ps 35:19
Let not my treacherous enemies rejoice over me,
rqv ybya ylAwjmcyAla
Let [not] those who hate me gratuitously wink 
ˆy[Awxrqy µnj yanc
the eye.
However, in (26), we do not understand the second line as negative, again on
semantic/exegetical grounds:34
(26) Ps 78:7
And they should not forget the works of God,
laAyll[m wjkvy alw
and (but) keep his commandments.
wrxny wytwxmw
33. A similar example appears in Prov 3:1, in which the object precedes the negative in
the ﬁrst conjunct. The negative cannot be understood as elided from the second conjunct.
34. Similarly, Ps 31:9 has constituents that are partially chiastic within a “back simple
chiastic” pattern; ellipsis of the negative is syntactically possible. Most translations do not
understand the negative to be elided on exegetical grounds (e.g., ‘and have not delivered
me into the hand of the enemy; you have set my feet in a broad place’, nrsv). Dahood,
however, understands the negative to be elided and translates: ‘You did not put me into the
hand of the Foe, nor set my feet in the broad domain’ (i.e., the netherworld) (Mitchell Da-
hood, Psalms 1: 1–50 [AB 16; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1966] 185).

Ellipsis Involving Negation in Biblical Poetry
51
It is possible to provide a precise syntactic description for the semantic differ-
ence. In (25), the negative of the ﬁrst line has scope over both clausal con-
juncts that follow. By contrast, in (26), the negative belongs inside the ﬁrst
clausal conjunct and therefore does not have scope over the second clausal
conjunct. These differences are schematized in (27), where (a) represents the
negative having scoping over both clausal conjuncts as in (25), and (b) repre-
sents the negative within the ﬁrst clausal conjunct as in (26):
(27)
a. Negative has scope over both clausal conjuncts, e.g., (25)
Neg. [clausal conjunct]
[clausal conjunct]
b. Negative is within the ﬁrst clausal conjunct, e.g., (26)
[Neg. clausal conjunct]
[clausal conjunct]
The difﬁculty lies in the fact that there is no way to determine which under-
lying syntactic structure is operative in any given instance except through the
semantics of the lines.
There are only a few examples like these in which the verb is in initial po-
sition in the ﬁrst line, and the syntactic requirements for ellipsis have been
met, resulting in syntactic ambiguity concerning the scope of the negative.35
However, constructions like these are the primary area involving ellipsis and
negation in which syntax is not determinative and the polarity of the second
line can be ascertained only through semantics. That is, an interpreter must
decide which syntactic structure to assign on the basis of exegesis.
Another area of difﬁculty involves a few instances in which the verb in the
second conjunct is one of the so-called “consecutive” forms, usually wayyiqtol:36
(28) Job 3:10
Because he did not shut the doors of the womb,
ynfb ytld rgs al yk
a. [nor] hide trouble from my eyes.
yny[m lm[ rtsyw
b. so as to hide trouble from my eyes.
The constituents of both conjuncts match, and the negative particle appears at
the head of the ﬁrst conjunct, so both requirements for ellipsis of the negative
35. For example, Ps 50:8 could be elliptical or not. See also Prov 30:3 (which has two
clausal constituents in chiastic order); most translations understand the negative to be
gapped (e.g., njpsv, nrsv), but it is not necessarily the case (e.g., jpsv).
36. See also Ps 44:19, Job 31:15 (with alh), Lam 3:33, and Jer 22:10 (with a perfect
consecutive). JM §160q lists additional examples. In other examples in which wayyiqtol fol-
lows a negated clause, the negative does not have scope over the clause with wayyiqtol (e.g.,
Ps 52:9, 109:16).

Cynthia L. Miller
52
have been met. However, there are two ways to understand the verse, each re-
ﬂecting differing syntactic analyses. The negative in the ﬁrst conjunct could be
understood to have scope over the second conjunct, even though it is not pos-
sible in the surface syntax for a negative particle to be present within a clause
that has a wayyiqtol verb. This interpretation is illustrated by the translation in
(a). But alternatively, it is also possible to understand the wayyiqtol as represent-
ing an action that is consequent upon the verb in the previous conjunct; in
that case, the negative particle from the ﬁrst conjunct does not have scope over
the second conjunct. This interpretation is illustrated by the translation in (b).
At the moment, I do not have compelling reasons for preferring one analysis
over the other, and both analyses are syntactically problematic.
4.0
Conclusions
We have seen that sentential negation interacts with elliptical processes in
ways that are in accord with the patterns of ellipsis in Biblical Hebrew. Ellipsis
of negative particles, the last category examined, is the most critical type of el-
lipsis to identify. Ellipsis of the negative without the verb (or verb phrase) can
be understood to have occurred only when a number of syntactic features are
present: the two clauses must be coordinate, the negative must appear in initial
position in the ﬁrst clause, and the constituent structures of the two clauses
must be identical with the constituents either in identical order or in chiastic
order. In addition, ellipsis of the bare negative is always forwards and never
backwards, because the negative is never in ﬁnal position in the clause. As a
result, even though ellipsis of the negative does not appear to leave a detectable
structural hole or gap in the syntax of a verse, there are a limited number of
contexts in which it can occur, thus signiﬁcantly decreasing the potential for
uncertainty concerning whether a sentence should be understood positively or
negatively.37
37. The possibilities for confusion are further reduced in that biblical poetry ordinarily
pairs a positive sentence in the ﬁrst line with a negative sentence in the second line (Adele
Berlin, The Dynamics of Biblical Parallelism [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985]
56–57, 94), rather than coupling a negative sentence in the ﬁrst with a positive sentence in
the second.

Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22: 
Two Versions of the Same Song

College of Evangelical Theological Education, Portugal
Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22 have been studied extensively as synoptic texts,
from varying perspectives and for different purposes.1 The purpose of this es-
say is to analyze some differences between the two texts as preserved in Codex
Leningradensis (L)2 with a view toward arriving at conclusions about the
transmission of the original composition in two forms.
David is presented in both versions as author. Internal evidence does not
preclude Davidic authorship; however, identiﬁcation of the author is not im-
portant to the focus of the present study. Cross and Freedman3 suggest, on the
basis of orthography and archaisms, a minimal date in the ninth through
eighth centuries b.c.e. for the composition. Reconstruction of the original
composition is also not one of my purposes, but one should recognize that the
texts are two versions of a single original composition. The high degree of
correspondence between them should be sufﬁcient evidence to support this
assumption. Certainly ancient scribes should also have recognized them to be

I have achieved more in my professional life than I had imagined possible. Professor Fox’s

two versions of a single original, even though the texts were transmitted on
separate scrolls. Nevertheless, the many signiﬁcant variations between the texts
beg an explanation.4 What is the nature of the differences, from a general per-
spective? Can everything be explained on the basis of errors introduced during
the copying process, or should we look for other causes?
Emanuel Tov5 makes an important distinction between genetic and alter-
native readings in the interpretation of textual variants. Genetic readings are
those that developed from another reading, generally on the basis of scribal
practices. Examples are: (1) transposition, modiﬁcation or graphic confusion of
letters, words, and sentences; (2) variant word division; (3) variation in use of
matres lectionis, maqqeph, dagesh and ﬁnal letters; (4) interpretive variations; and
(5) accidental additions and deletions. I presuppose that genetic variants in
these two texts are the result of errors introduced into the texts as a result of
scribal negligence or historical conventions (that is, in the case of matres lectio-
nis). Although many variants of this type are found within the two texts under
study, genetic variants are not speciﬁcally treated in this essay.
A signiﬁcant number of differences between Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22 are
alternative readings, which are the principle focus of the present study. Alter-
native readings do not result from modiﬁcation of a written Vorlage, nor were
they generated from another reading as a result of scribal mishap. These read-
ings are equally acceptable in context on the basis of grammar, syntax, and us-
age, and deserve equal claim to “originality.” Synonym variants, for example,
are clearly alternative readings because synonyms, by deﬁnition, are semanti-
cally interchangeable in a given context.6 I will also give attention to unique
readings (pluses and minuses), duplicated morphological variants, single mor-
phological variants, and stylistic variants.
In the following sections I will identify, list, and classify the alternative vari-
ants of the composition with some commentary to orient the reader to the na-
ture of the evidence.
1. Unique Readings (Pluses and Minuses)
These readings are unique in the sense that the synoptic text contains noth-
ing that corresponds to the reading under consideration. Both texts contain

lectionis. The decision to count a complex difference as one or more variants is subjective.

unique readings. The following items merit special attention because they are
supported by the LXX evidence, proof of their existence in a period earlier
than the third through second centuries b.c.e. Some unique readings are not
treated here, because they are to be identiﬁed as conﬂate readings or are not
supported by the LXX.
a. Psalm 18:2
Ps 18:2 reads yqzj hwhy ˚mjra ‘I love you, Lord, my strength’. Some schol-
ars7 propose to emend ˚mjra to ˚mmra, ‘I exalt you’, because ﬁrst, µjr in the
Qal is a hapax legomenon that expresses a rare intimacy with the deity, and
second, µmr would form a near inclusio with v. 49, ynmmwrt ‘You exalt me’.
Ps 116:1 expresses a similar sentiment of intimacy with different vocabulary,
ylwq ta hwhy [mvy yk ytbha, ‘I love that the Lord hears my voice’. Given the
support of the LXX here, there is no good reason to expunge or modify the
reading.
b. 2 Samuel 22:3
2 Sam 22:3 includes yn[vt smjm y[vm ‘My savior, you save me from vio-
lence’, where the psalm text offers nothing. As is, it balances an idea similarly
expressed in v. 49, ynlyxt µysmj vyam, ‘You deliver me from men of violent
acts’.
c. 2 Samuel 22:5
The LXX of 2 Sam 22:5, o§ti, presupposes the Hebrew equivalent yk. The
corresponding psalm text lacks an equivalent in both language versions.
d. Psalm 18:7
Cross and Freedman8 consider the reading awbt wynpl ‘(my cry) comes be-
fore him (into his ears)’ in Ps 18:7 to be a case of conﬂation or haplography. No
manuscript or versional evidence is offered to support this proposal. 2 Samuel
22 has the non-verbal sentence “My cry is in his ears.”
e. Psalm 18:15
The root bbr-II ‘to shoot’ is rare,9 but its association with arrows, as in Ps

LXX ejplhvqunen ‘multiplied (lightnings)’ interprets differently; nevertheless it
reﬂects the reading of L. 2 Samuel 22 presumes an ellipsis of the verb jlvyw
from the beginning of the verse, ‘(and he sent) . . . lightning’.
f. Psalm 18:16
The second masculine-singular pronominal sufﬁx in Ps 18:16, ˚tr[gm
‘at your rebuke’ is absent in 2 Samuel 22 (tr[gb), which continues a third
masculine-singular form of address from v. 15 and into v. 17 and beyond. At
some point a decision was made to alter the original here either to second
masculine singular or to third masculine singular. The more intimate second
masculine-singular form conforms to the sentiment of Ps 18:2, ˚mjra ‘I love
you’.
g. Psalm 18:19
The preposition l with the predicate is optional in the syntagma—“hyh +
l-predicate + l-person”—as in Ps 18:19 ˆ[vml and 2 Sam 22:19 ˆ[vml.10
The variation seen here may be due to a dialectal preference or due to a sty-
listic preference of the recorder.
h. Psalm 18:29
In Ps 18:29 the plus ryat, used to convey the idea ‘You light my lamp’ is
equally as good as 2 Samuel 22 ‘You are my lamp’. The verb rwa ‘to light’ is
used elsewhere in poetry to complement the noun rn ‘lamp’ (for example, Ps
119:105; Job 18:6, 29:3; Prov 6:23, 13:9).
i. Psalm 18:36
The syntactical structure of ynd[st ˚nymyw ‘Your right hand supports me’ in
Ps 18:36 is identical to the following colon, “Your help makes me great.”
Cross and Freedman think that it has dropped out of 2 Samuel 22.11 If we ask
whether the omission was accidental or intentional, no certain conclusion is
possible. Its omission would still leave a well-formed bicolon: “You have given
me your shield of salvation, and your condescension has made me great.”
j. 2 Samuel 22:47
The extended construct chain of 2 Sam 22:47 with rwx ‘rock’ (“the God of
the rock of my salvation”) seems overloaded. Alter reads 2 Samuel 22 with L
and interprets the unit as an example of semantically complementary verse
halves.12 L’s reading is supported by the LXX, though vocalizing differently,

as “my God, the rock of my salvation.” Its omission in Psalm 18 avoids a ver-
batim repetition from the preceding colon.
2. Synonym Variants
Synonyms, that is, words similar in meaning, are a common source of tex-
tual variants. Synonyms and synonym variants appear in poetic parallelism, in
alternation within the same narrative text, in parallel expressions of contem-
poraneous prophets (for example, Isaiah and Micah), in parallel passages
within the Masoretic Text (MT), between the MT and the Samaritan Penta-
teuch, and between manuscripts of the MT.13
Not all of the variants listed here are, technically speaking, synonyms having
equivalent meanings; some are words commonly associated in a literary con-
text. They may be used interchangeably in expressions elsewhere in the Bible,
though not with a strictly synonymous meaning (see, for example, §2b2, be-
low). These are treated here along with synonyms so as to not multiply cate-
gories needlessly.
a. Repetition and Variation
It is noteworthy that in four cases, by use of a synonym, Psalm 18 avoids a
repetition that exists in the 2 Samuel text: (1) Ps 18:1 dymw . . . πkm; 2 Sam
22:1 πkmw . . . πkm; (2) Ps 18:7 [wva . . . arqa; 2 Sam 22:7 arqa . . . arqa;
(3) Ps 18:32 ytlwz . . . yd[lbm; 2 Sam 22:32 yd[lbm . . . yd[lbm; (4) Ps 18:29
yhla hwhy; 2 Sam 22:29 hwhyw hwhy. In a ﬁfth case, Psalm 18 repeats a construct
noun but maintains variation by use of an alternate nomen rectum: (5) Ps 18:5–
6 lwav ylbj . . . twm ylbj; 2 Sam 22:5–6 lwav ylbj . . . twm yrbvm. The
omission of rwx in Ps 18:47 (see above, §1j) is a sixth case of variation over
repetition. The preference for variation in the psalm version surely cannot be
ascribed to scribal carelessness but must be credited to a conscious artistic pur-
pose. Of course, it is an open question which technique was used in the origi-
nal composition: repetition or variation?
The words dy ‘hand’ and πk ‘palm’ are a common word pair in Hebrew and
Canaanite poetry (for example, Isa 1:15; 62:3; Ps 71:4; Prov 10:4; 31:19, 20;
Song 5:5). They are used interchangeably and often indistinguishably14 in
common expressions (for example, “the work of his hands” in Ps 17:9 l[p
wypk; Deut 33:11 wydy l[p). The variant dymw in Ps 18:1 (2 Samuel 22 πkmw),
creating diversity in the place of reiteration, is therefore not surprising.

Seeligmann, “Studies in the History of the Biblical Text,” Textus 20 (2000) 4.

b. Synonymous Nouns
In addition to variants used to avoid repetition (§2a, above) other synony-
mous nouns are found, generating a variant for which no internal motive is
discernible.
b1. The expression twm ylbj ‘cords of death’ in Ps 18:5 alternates with
twm yrbvm ‘breakers of death’ in 2 Samuel 22. The semantic connection be-
tween ‘cords’ and ‘breakers’ is in the idea of “dragging down to death.” Both
are used of death and of the sea (see Ps 93:4 µy yrbvm; Ezek 27:9 µyh ylbj).
b2. The 2 Sam 22:8 variant µymvh (versus Psalm 18 µyrh) in the phrase
“the foundations of the heavens” is a striking turn of expression and ought to
be retained as the lectio difﬁcilior in its place. The psalm reading might be a har-
monization from Deut 32:32, although “the foundations of X” appears in
seven other passages (Isa 24:18, 40:21; Jer 31:37; Mic 6:2; Prov 8:29; Ps 18:16
= 2 Sam 22:16) where X is one of three associated words: ‘the mountains’
µyrh, ‘the earth’ ≈ra, and ‘the world’ lbt.
b3. Ps 18:33 has “the God who girded me (ynrzamh) with strength” where
2 Sam 22:33 reads “the God who is my strong refuge (yzw[m).” The concept of
a God who “girds with strength” is found also in 1 Sam 2:4 and, notably, in
v. 33 of this passage. The concept of a God who is “my (or their) refuge” is
found in Ps 31:5, 37:39, 43:2, and Jer 16:19. Thus the two notions are equally
at home in hymnic literature.
b4. The idiomatic expression ≈ra(h) rp[k ‘as the dust of (the) earth’ is
used in Gen 13:16, 28:14, and 2 Chr 1:9 to speak of what is numerous. The
combination rp[k plus some other noun is also a common simile for numer-
ousness. Its use in 2 Sam 22:43 is as a simile for what is ﬁnely pulverized. The
locution jwr ynp l[ ‘on the face of the wind’ in Ps 18:43 is unique (though
jwr ynpl ‘before the wind’ is found with “chaff ” as a simile for what is easily
moved) and certainly not a genetic development from the synoptic text-form.
c. Divine Names
Both texts use variations of the divine name freely. Aside from the intro-
ductions, in only 3 places do the texts vary. Although we might ascribe these
3 variants to genetic causes, there are valid reasons to view them as alternative
variants. In Ps 18:3 we ﬁnd yla (2 Sam 22:2 yhla), a form that appears only
12 times in BH. Ten times it appears in direct address to the deity, and twice
it emphasizes a personal relationship with the deity (here and Exod 15:2). Its
use then connotes a sense of intimacy, and this sentiment complements the
unique opening of v. 2, “I love you, Lord.”
A second variant in Ps 18:29 effectively avoids a repetition (see above, §2a).
A third variant in Ps 18:32 is interesting from a dialectal standpoint. The form

Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22: Two Versions of the Same Song
59
hwla (versus la in 2 Samuel 22) is a favorite form of the book of Job (occur-
ring 41 times). In 8 other instances (Deut 32:15, 17; 2 Kgs 17:31; Isa 44:8; Ps
50:22; Prov 30:5; Neh 9:17; 2 Chr 32:15) the text is identiﬁed as being of
Northern origin by Gary Rendsburg and others.15 In 49 of a total of 58 uses,
then, the form hwla is used as a feature of a Northern dialect.
d. Synonymous Verbs
d1. For Ps 18:7 [wva ‘I cry for help’ = 2 Sam 22:7 arqa ‘I call’ (see above,
§1g). These verbs are used as word pairs in Isa 32:5, 58:9, and Jonah 2:3.
d2. Waltke and O’Connor16 identify a modal use of the nonperfective verb
(that is, yiqtol) to denote the capability of the subject to perform the action of
the verbal root. They cite 2 Sam 22:39 (ˆwmwqy ‘they can [not] rise’) along with
other examples. If this analysis is correct, then the use corresponds semanti-
cally to the same root with auxiliary lky17 ‘to be able’ in Ps 18:39 (µwq wlky
‘they are [not] able to rise’), making more explicit the idea of capability. The
two readings, accordingly, are completely synonymous, and the variation may
be due to the dialectal or stylistic preferences of the recorders of the two ver-
sions.
d3. The meaning ‘subdue’ for the Hiphil of rbd (Ps 18:48 rbdyw) is rare but
conﬁrmed by the same use in Ps 47:4 (also with µym[ ‘peoples’, as here). The
Hiphil of dry in the sense ‘bring down (peoples)’ (2 Sam 22:48 dyrwmw) is also
rare but conﬁrmed by Ps 56:7 (with µym[) and Isa 10:13 (with µybwvy ‘inhabi-
tants’). If these uses were also rare in the living language of preexilic Israel and
Judah, then this variation may be the result of regional preferences.
d4. The participle with ﬁrst common-singular pronominal sufﬁx, yflpm,
‘who redeems me’ (Ps 18:49; 2 Sam 22:49 yayxwmw) is used ﬁve other times in
the Psalms (18:3, 40:18, 55:9, 70:6, 144:2). The Piel of flp corresponds se-
mantically to the Hiphil of axy in the sense ‘bring forth’ in a limited number

60
of contexts (for example, Job 21:10; perhaps Ps 56:8). Thus, the two readings
are synonymous, and there is no genetic explanation for the substitution of
one for the other.
e. Prepositions
In six cases the texts differ in the use of prepositions, though a difference of
sense is not necessarily implied.
e1. The use of the preposition b in µymvb (Ps 18:14) in the sense of ˆm
‘from’ (as in 2 Sam 22:14 µymv ˆm) has been studied by Rendsburg, Dahood,
and others.18 Rendsburg identiﬁed this usage as a Northernism. The non-
assimilated nun of 2 Sam 22:14 (µymv ˆm) makes it unlikely that this is a case of
graphic confusion of bet and mem.
e2. Both ˆm and monographic b function regularly to indicate the cause of
an action or situation as here in Ps 18:16 (˚tr[gm) and 2 Sam 22:16 (tr[gb).19
Viewed in isolation, the variation might easily be interpreted as a case of
graphic confusion.20 If the alteration is intentional, then the motive could be
either a regional preference (that is, localect), a personal preference (that is, id-
iolect), or a stylistic preference of the recorder. The use of the preposition b
in 2 Sam 22:16 avoids the close repetition of ˆm (tr[gb ‘at the rebuke’; tmvnm
‘at the blast’).
e3. For Ps 18:19 ˆ[vml = 2 Sam 22:19 ˆ[vm, see above, §1g.
e4. The expressions µ[ µymt hyh (Ps 18:24) and l µymt hyh (2 Sam 22:24)
‘to be blameless before’ are unique in BH, so no ﬁrm conclusion can be drawn
from this case. The syntagma µ[ µlv hyh in 1 Kgs 15:14 is analogous to the
use in Ps 18:24, demonstrating that the preposition µ[ is appropriate to the
context. Graphic confusion of the prepositions is not likely, nor is any other
genetic explanation of the variation.
e5. The preposition ytlwz ‘besides’ in Ps 18:32 is by no means a genetic de-
velopment from the synonymous yd[lbm of 2 Samuel 22. Its use in Psalm 18
avoids the repetition of yd[lbm in 2 Samuel 22. Both prepositions are of low
frequency in BH (16 times hlwz / ytlwz; 12 times yd[lbm), so it is unlikely here
that a rare word has been replaced by a more familiar term.
e6. The preposition la ‘to’ appears as a complement of the verb [wv 8
times in Psalms (18:7, 28:2, 30:3, 31:23, 88:14) and Job (30:20, 38:41); the
complement l[ ‘upon’ only appears in Ps 18:42. The prepositions la and l[
overlap substantially in their functions, and l[ is found where la might be ex-

61
pected with verbs of motion ‘to(ward)’ or of speaking ‘to’ (especially in later
texts, though this use of l[ by itself is not a sure mark of lateness).21 The in-
terchange of these prepositions in Ps 18:42 and 2 Sam 22:42 therefore is not
signiﬁcant for my argument here.
f. Conjunctions
Conjunction variants, listed here mainly for the sake of completeness, do
not make a strong case for an alternative versus genetic explanation but do
contribute some weight when added to other data presented.
f1. The conjunctions yk and w appear with such frequency in BH that it
would be legitimate to presume that a scribe substituted one in the place of
the other, the result of a simple mental error. The readings of Ps 18:28 (yk) and
2 Sam 22:28 ([ta]w) are supported by the LXX, which may indicate nothing
more than that an error slipped into the text at an early stage. However, this
variation of conjunctions is not an isolated case, as demonstrated by the fol-
lowing examples.
f2. In seven other cases a waw conjunction appears in one version and not
the other (see Ps 18:5, 8, 13, 18, 29, 30, and 41 along with the corresponding
verses in 2 Samuel 22). These cases are to be distinguished from the use of waw
to form the verb tense wayyiqtol (see §3e, below). No pattern is evident and no
grand conclusion is to be drawn from these cases other than that the number
of cases must reﬂect more than scribal carelessness. The care with which
scribes preserved a waw or its absence could and should be studied in the ver-
sions and manuscripts, but such an exercise goes beyond the parameters of the
present study.
f3. The coordinating conjunction πa (Ps 18:49 [ymq ˆm] πa) is most often
equivalent to conjunctive waw (2 Sam 22:49 [ymqm]w) but may add some em-
phasis, perhaps the more so because of its relative rarity.22
3. Repeated Morphological Variants
Morphological variants are arguably genetic in nature. However, when the
same type of difference occurs in two or more places within the same text, it
is likely evidence of design rather than of an accident of copying.
a. Noun Formation
The forms qdx and hqdx appear 160 times or more each in BH, broadly
distributed among the various books. Each noun is used in concentration in
21. Waltke and O’Connor, Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax, 216.
22. Schökel, Dicionário Bíblico Hebraico-Português, 72; also BDB 65.

Theron Young
62
Isaiah, Psalms, and Job. In Isa 45:2, 58:2, and Hos 10:12, both forms appear in
the same immediate context, demonstrating an equivalence of meaning and
usage. A single variant could easily be explained as a genetic development.
However, given that in two separate verses the psalm text has qdx (Ps 18:21,
25 yqdxk) where the 2 Samuel text has hqdx (2 Sam 22:21, 25 ytqdxk), the
variation is probably intentional.
b. Pronominal Sufﬁxes
In vv. 37, 40, and 48, the psalm has ytjt ‘under me’ where 2 Samuel has
yntjt, a form otherwise not found in BH. Gesenius (GKC §103d) explains
the form yntjt as an example of a preposition with a verbal sufﬁx. Delitzsch
rightly ascribes this to “an inaccuracy of the common dialect which confused
the genitive and accusative sufﬁx.”23 The 2 Samuel text has preserved a local
variation of the tjt plus ﬁrst common-singular sufﬁx form. It is perhaps
worth noting that BH also preserves two forms of tjt plus third masculine-
plural sufﬁx (µhytjt 5 times, and µtjt 11 times) and two forms of the tjt
plus third masculine-singular sufﬁx (wytjt 99 times, and wtjt 4 times, always
with Qere wytjt). Either the use of this preposition was subject to local varia-
tion, or two competing forms were concurrently employed in the living lan-
guage at the time of the recording of these two versions. In either case, 3
separate cases of the rare form in 2 Samuel 22 cannot be explained as a result
of genetic processes.
Another variant in pronominal sufﬁx formation appears in 2 Sam 22:46. The
feminine plural noun with third masculine-plural sufﬁx (Ps 18:46 µhytwrgsmm)
appears without ßerê yôd (µtwrgsmm). The shorter (and older) form of the pro-
noun competes with the longer form with certain high-frequency nouns (ba
‘father’, µa ‘mother’, and µv ‘name’).24 In these 2 examples of pronominal-
sufﬁx use, then, the 2 Samuel 22 text presents the reader with a minority for-
mation in relation to standard BH.
c. Verb: Hithpael
In 2 cases, the 2 Samuel 22 text presents the reader with a verb in the Hith-
pael where the psalm text records a different binyan. The Piel of vjk (as in
Psalm 18) appears 19 times in BH; the Hithpael appears only in 2 Sam 22:45.
Once again, the Samuel text preserves a legitimate but minority form. The
Hithpael of v[g is represented in the Qere of 2 Sam 22:8 (ﬁrst occurence of 2
in the verse) where the Kethiv and Psalm 18 have a Qal form. It is unclear
23. Delitzsch, Books of Samuel, 275.
24. JM §94g.

Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22: Two Versions of the Same Song
63
whether the Qere is a correction to the majority form or is preserving an ear-
lier text reading. The Qere form, if original, would preserve another case of
repetition in the 2 Samuel text where the psalm has variation.
d. Verb: Geminate Root Formation
Two variants involve the formation of verb forms from geminate roots. In
each case the psalm text records a normal form (that is, with the second con-
sonant duplicated; see JM §82a) where the 2 Samuel text records a reduced
form (that is, without duplication of the second consonant). The sentence
structure is the same in each version, so a difference of meaning is not signaled
by the use of differing verb formations. The occurrence of the same phenom-
enon twice within the texts decreases the likelihood of a genetic explanation
(that is, haplography or dittography). Do the versions preserve here a prefer-
ence of two concurrent dialects, or do they preserve a stylistic preference of
forms occurring in free variation within the language?
In the case of rrb, the evidence is very limited. The Hithpael of this root
appears only three times: Ps 18:27 (rrbtt), 2 Sam 22:27 (rbtt), and Dan
12:10 (wrrbty).
In the case of bbs, the form ynwbbs (Ps 18:6) appears seven times in BH
(once with defective spelling), whereas the form ynwbs (see 2 Sam 22:6) ap-
pears twice (once with defective spelling). Both forms appear in a single verse
in Ps 118:11, supporting the conclusion that, at least at some point in history
and in some location, the forms were stylistic variants of a single dialect.
e. Verb: Final hê Formations
The formally cohortative (h[dra) of 2 Sam 22:38 is labeled a “pseudo-
cohortative” by Waltke and O’Connor25 and usually interpreted as a simple
yiqtol (see rsv “I pursued my enemies”) as in Ps 18:38 (πwdra). In Ps 18:50 the
cohortative force of the second verb (hrmza) should be applied to the ﬁrst
(˚dwa); the 2 Samuel reading implies that both verbs are to be read as yiqtol.
The question of the cohortative form in 2 Sam 22:24 (hrmtvaw) versus the
wayyiqtol in Ps 18:24 (rmtvaw) should be considered in conjunction with the
full and defective forms of the Qal wayyiqtol ﬁrst-common singular of hyh in
the same verse (Ps 18:24 yhaw; 2 Sam 22:24 hyhaw). In both cases the psalm ver-
sion lacks hê where the 2 Samuel version has it. The shorter spelling of hyhaw
is found 16 times in BH, 7 times in texts identiﬁed by Rendsburg as “North-
ern” ( Judg 18:4; Hos 13:7, 10, 14; Ps 73:14; Job 30:9).26 On the other hand,
25. Waltke and O’Connor, Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax, 576.
26. Rendsburg, Linguistic Evidence, 8–13.

Theron Young
64
the longer version also appears in Northern texts twice (Hos 11:4, Job 7:20) in
10 uses in BH. Since the forms alternate in Hosea and Job, we conclude that
they are style variants. The long form of 2 Samuel 22 (hrmtvaw) must be
another pseudo-cohortative. It is inserted between two wayyiqtol verbs, the
second of which states a reward given to the psalmist based on past faithfulness
shown in the previous three verses. In 3 of 4 cases, the 2 Samuel text uses an
extended form with ﬁnal hê; in 1 case the psalm text does the same.
f. Consecutive Waw
We should not hastily jump to the conclusion that all variations in the use
of consecutive waw are to be explained as cases of scribal carelessness. A study
of the frequency of this type of variant among the manuscripts would be help-
ful, especially comparing L with the Qumran and Cairo Genizah manuscripts.
The number of differences of this sort between Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22 is
not great. Twice (vv. 14 and 16) the psalm text is fuller; 6 times the 2 Samuel
22 text is fuller (vv. 7, 12, 39 bis, 41, and 44). The Ps 18:14 wayyiqtol (µ[ryw)
resolves an isolated jussive (µ[ry), unnatural in context, appearing in 2 Sam
22:14. The reverse is true in 2 Sam 22:12 (tvyw) and Ps 18:12 (tvy). Volitives
are used sparingly in the hymn: v. 47 contains the only unsuspicious jussive
(psalm µwryw; 2 Samuel µryw). Variants in vv. 38–44 (Psalm µgycaw, 2 Samuel
µdymvaw; Psalm µxjma, 2 Samuel µxjmaw; Psalm wlpy, 2 Samuel wlpyw; Psalm
µtymxa, 2 Samuel µtymxaw; Psalm ynflpt, 2 Samuel ynflptw) create a distinc-
tion of perspectives. Wilson27 notes that in the psalm text imperfect verb forms
suggest “an immediacy of narrative as if it is currently happening,” whereas the
Samuel text “creates an unambiguously past reference” through use of “verb
forms . . . pointed as waw consecutives.” The grouping together of similar vari-
ants suggests purpose, rather than accident.
4. Single Morphological Variants
Each of the following morphological variants occurs only once in the text,
so the likelihood of a genetic explanation increases. However, they are just as
likely to be the product of linguistic or stylistic preferences of the recorders
and therefore should be treated as alternative readings. Taken with the other
evidence presented, they add weight to the argument.
a. Noun Formation
The noun dswm ‘foundation’ (see the masculine-plural construct in Ps 18:8
ydswm) appears 10 times in BH, 8 times in the plural. The noun hdswm ‘foun-

65
dation’ (see the feminine plural construct in 2 Sam 22:8, twdswm) appears 7
times in BH, 6 times in the plural. Both appear in construct with ≈ra ‘earth’,
and no difference of meaning is implied by the substitution of one for the
other.
b. Singular versus Plural Noun
The noun qrb ‘lightning’ is used 12 times in the singular (as in 2 Sam 22:15
qrb) and 9 times in the plural (as in Ps 18:15 µyqrbw). The singular noun is
general (‘lightning’) and the plural speciﬁc (‘lightning ﬂashes’).
c. Plural versus Singular Noun
The noun smj ‘violence’ appears 60 times in BH; only 4 times in the plu-
ral. Three times the plural is used in the expression µysmj vya ‘man of violent
actions’ (as in 2 Sam 22:49); 4 times the singular is used in the corresponding
expression smj vya ‘man of violence’ (as in Ps 18:49).
5. Stylistic Variants
a. Preposition ˆm
It is noteworthy that in two verses the psalm text has the preposition ˆm with
nonassimilated nun (Ps 18:12 ybya ˆmw and 18:49 ymq ˆm), where the 2 Samuel
text has it with the nun assimilated (2 Sam 22:12 ybyamw and 22:49 ymqmw). Both
forms may appear in combination with the same word in the same text (for ex-
ample, Ps 18:49 ybyam; 18:4 ybya ˆmw). But in addition to being style variants,
the forms reﬂect a difference of pronunciation. These are the only 2 of 23 oc-
currences of ˆm in the psalm text that have nonassimilated nun.
b. Emphasizing Pronoun
The form yflpm ‘my deliverer’ (Piel participle with ﬁrst common-singular
pronoun) appears 6 times in BH. In 2 Samuel 22 the preposition l follows
with emphasizing ﬁrst common-singular pronoun, which is lacking in the
Psalm 18 version. This same structure is seen one other time in BH, in Ps
144:2, a text that borrows directly from 2 Samuel 22 = Psalm 18.
c. Accusative Pronoun: Sufﬁxed to Verb or to Particle ta
In Ps 18:20 an accusative pronoun is sufﬁxed to the verb (ynayxwyw). In the
corresponding 2 Samuel 22 text, the accusative pronoun is joined to the par-
ticle ta (yta . . . axyw). The recorders thus conveyed the same idea through
different options available to them, and the variation is best explained as an al-
ternative reading rather than a result of genetic causes.

6. Three Models of Explanation
Three models may be proposed to explain the alternative variants, though
indeed, other models may exist that at present are unknown to me.
1. Modiﬁcation by Scribes.
One option would be to ascribe all the data to
scribal interventions, especially harmonization to parallel passages. In this model
the scribes, wittingly or unwittingly, modiﬁed a canonical composition by writ-
ing something that was not in their Vorlage but was actually a reading of an-
other, similarly-structured text familiar to them.
2. Modiﬁcation by Disciples.
A second theory might be that disciples intro-
duced variants in the form that they committed to memory for later promulga-
tion (of an ostensibly canonical composition). Disciples introduced synonymous
expressions in their versions according to their own preferences that did not
signiﬁcantly alter the original meaning of the text.
3. Modiﬁcation through Cultic Usage.
In the third model, free modiﬁcation
of an original composition took place within different communities through
repeated usage in worship—in a precanonical stage, perhaps even before each
version was committed to writing. The type of modiﬁcation would have taken
place gradually over time according to the preferences of local communities.
7. Interpretation
Let me now discuss the interpretation of the evidence with these models in
mind.
a. Unique and Synonymous Readings
Either we must accept that the majority of unique readings are the result of
separate and deliberate modiﬁcations of the original composition, or we must
conclude that haplography and/or harmonizing tendencies have played havoc
with the text. The presence of many synonymous readings argues for the
former explanation, because these cannot be directly explained on the basis of
copying practices. It seems more natural to think that the substitution of a syn-
onym was made during an oral stage. The occasional synonym variant might
be explained as a case of harmonization, especially if it can be shown to con-
form to common expressions or parallels found elsewhere in ancient Hebrew
or Canaanite literature. However, the accumulation of synonym variants is
evidence of an active purpose at work to modify the original form of the
composition.
The evidence from repetition and variation in the use of synonyms (§2a
above) is important. It suggests that two different techniques of poetic style are
operating within these versions. The use of repetition in the 2 Samuel version

Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22: Two Versions of the Same Song
67
and variation where possible in the psalm version must be the result of edito-
rial intent rather than the fortuitous product of a series of scribal accidents.
The number of unique readings (pluses and minuses) in evidence in the
psalm version and in the 2 Samuel version is signiﬁcant. The nature of these
readings is also signiﬁcant. In four cases, the pluses of Psalm 18 tend to increase
the intimacy in the relationship between the implied author and the deity,
especially by use of a second-person address in place of third-person: “I love
you, Lord, my strength” (v. 2), “my God” (v. 3; see §2c above), “at your re-
buke” (v. 16), and “Your right hand supports me” (v. 36). This evidence im-
plies that an editorial purpose is involved in the differences. Admittedly, these
four examples do not present a strong argument. But taken in conjunction
with other evidence, they suggest that the differences are a result of creative
purpose and not mishap.
b. Stylistic Variants
A number of readings show that in cases where two equally good options
existed in the language to express an idea, each version preserves a different
option. The choice of prepositions and conjunctions (§§2e–f ), of noun for-
mations (§3a, §4a) and number (§4b–c), of pronominal sufﬁx forms (§3b), and
of verb morphology (§§3c–f ) are all examples. The option to assimilate the
nun of ˆm or not (§5a) and the choice of an accusative pronoun attached to the
verb or preceded by ta (§5c) are more direct examples, because these varia-
tions alternate freely in texts nearly everywhere in BH. The use of an empha-
sizing pronoun or not (§5b) is also direct evidence that willful choice operated
in the preparation of the text.
c. Morphological Variants
In many cases of morphological variants, we have seen that one form is as
much used as the other, and there is no evident reason to select or prefer one
reading over another. The usage in BH does not support the conclusion that
harmonization was the motive for the substitution of one form over another.
For all practical purposes the forms are synonymous or interchangeable. In the
case of the use of a singular versus a plural noun, this is true to a lesser degree,
but even here the use of the plural is as common as the singular (§§4b–c), and
both are used in similar contexts. Certainly we cannot say that the use of a sin-
gular in place of a plural (and vice versa) took place on the basis of harmoni-
zation to a more common expression. A genetic explanation could be given to
resolve one or two cases in the text, but the large number of morphological
variants encountered between these two versions substantiates the notion that
the readings are alternative rather than genetic. The large number of duplicated

Theron Young
68
morphological variants suggests that the versions preserve linguistic data from
different (speech) communities.
d. Dialect and Provenance
The data presented here represent linguistically diverse types of evidence.
A continuum of language use includes idiolects (that is, a speaker’s own system
of language), localects (that is, the language system of a locality), dialects (that
is, the language system of a region), and languages (that is, a group of mutually
intelligible dialects).28 Style options operate within an individual speaker’s id-
iolect and represent equivalent options that might be selected on the basis of
undeﬁnable factors, such as the mood of the moment. The variants of this
study are both stylistic and dialectal. Dialectal differences imply that the two
versions developed within different localities. Within those distinct localities,
the speakers who developed the versions also substituted readings on the basis
of style preferences, implying that they did not at the time consider the com-
position to be canonically ﬁxed.
A rigorous application of linguistic methods can often yield information re-
garding the provenance of a literary composition. This approach has been used
effectively by Gary Rendsburg to identify a number of the psalms as being of
“Northern” or “Israelite” origin. The variants between Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel
22 do not divide clearly along dialectal lines, especially not according to the
criteria presented in publications of Rendsburg (and others).29 Unfortunately,
the data do not permit us to identify the regions or localities represented in
each version—certainly not as indicating one version as Israelite and the other
as Judahite. Rendsburg, in his detailed study of Northern psalms, has not iden-
tiﬁed these texts as being of Northern origin, not because no Northern fea-
tures appear, but because there is an insufﬁcient concentration of features to
support such a conclusion.30 Northern features are sometimes found in South-
ern texts. Psalm 18 includes a couple of features that are Northern (that is, the
divine name hwla and the use of the preposition b in the sense of ˆm; see §2c
and §2e1). 2 Samuel 22 preserves a couple of minority forms (§§3b–c). At
best, we conclude that the versions come from different localities.
Psalm 18 is not a poorly preserved copy of a written text of 2 Samuel 22;
nor is 2 Samuel 22 a copy of Psalm 18. We do not have here a text that was
initially preserved in written form in one version and as a copy of that text in

1996) 480–82.

69
the other version. We have two versions of a song—each preserved in writing
somewhat independent of the other. The number of alternative readings be-
tween the two versions points deﬁnitively in that direction. This observation
was made by C. F. Keil already in the nineteenth century:
The idea that the text of 2 Sam. rests upon a careless copy and tradition must
decidedly be rejected: for, on the one hand, by far the larger portion of the devi-
ations in our text from that of the Psalter are not to be attributed to carelessness
on the part of the copyists, but are evidently alterations made with thoughtful-
ness and deliberation.31
After the initial reduction of the versions to writing, genetic variants were
produced as errors in the copying of the consonantal text. James Barr rightly
noted: “One cannot, indeed, assume that all such differences between parallel
texts are a result of textual corruption; some may go back to free variants in
oral tradition.”32 Modiﬁcation within different communities is the model that
corresponds most naturally to the data introduced in the earliest (oral) stage.
Two lines of evidence support this explanation. First, the presence of differ-
ences of pronunciation, morphology, grammadr, and word choice suggests
that we are looking at more than just a collection of the stylistic preferences of
an individual. Second, given the nature of the text—that is, a thanksgiving
hymn to be sung and appropriated in worship repeatedly—we might expect
that local versions would develop. I have observed the same phenomenon re-
peatedly among worship communities in Portugal, where newly-created cho-
ruses, not yet recorded in hymnals, are employed in worship and freely
modiﬁed within the different localities.
For some readers, this conclusion may seem unnecessary. But it is one thing
to suppose that this was the case and another thing to try to draw a connection
between the evidence and the conclusion—as I have attempted to do here.

The Wisdom of Creation in Psalm 104
Adele Berlin
University of Maryland
Although Psalm 104 is not usually classiﬁed as a “wisdom psalm,” its afﬁn-
ities to wisdom thought have been noted by several scholars.1 First and fore-
most, contemplation about the cosmos and the place of humans in it is a major
concern in wisdom literature, and it is also the main topic of this psalm. A
more speciﬁc reference to wisdom is the statement that God made all of cre-
ation with wisdom (v. 24), an idea also found in Prov 3:19. That is, wisdom is
the means, the divine tool as it were, through which the universe was created.
Our psalm also implies that the creation manifests the quality of wisdom,
in that it is well crafted and logical. A third point of contact with wisdom
thought is the banishment of the wicked at the end of the psalm (v. 35), remi-
niscent of the destruction of the wicked in Psalms 1 and 37 (generally consid-
ered wisdom psalms). In our psalm, however, the idea is not that the righteous
are superior to the wicked but that there is no place for the wicked in the per-
fect world that God created.
These afﬁnities to wisdom notwithstanding, I do not want to argue that
Psalm 104 is a wisdom psalm, for its stated aim is to “bless the Lord,” not to
instruct or to inquire into matters of good and evil. Nonetheless, these afﬁni-
ties raise the question of the use of wisdom thought in the Psalms and also, by
extension, the relationship of wisdom to Torah.
1. For instance, E. Gerstenberger, Psalms, Part 2, and Lamentations (FOTL 15; Grand
Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001) 226. J. G. Gammie calls it a wisdom psalm (“From Prudentialism
to Apocalypticism: The Houses of the Sages amid the Varying Forms of Wisdom,” in The
Sage in Israel and the Ancient Near East [ed. J. G. Gammie and L. G. Perdue; Winona Lake,
Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1990] 481–82), as does R. N. Whybray (The Intellectual Tradition in the
Old Testament [Berlin: de Gruyter, 1974] 154). S. Terrien speaks of the “sapiental ﬂavor of
the entire psalm” (The Psalms [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003] 717).
Author’s note: It is with pleasure that I dedicate this essay to my friend and colleague, Mi-
chael Fox, who is renowned for his contributions to our understanding of wisdom in bib-
lical literature. This essay will consider wisdom in the Psalms, especially in Psalm 104, and
will then investigate how the psalm describes creation.

Wisdom in Psalms is not the pragmatic, universalistic, “nonsectarian” an-
cient Near Eastern wisdom that scholars commonly associate with biblical wis-
dom literature. All the so-called wisdom psalms put wisdom ideas in the
context of trust in God to do justice, punish the wicked, and so forth. Success
or failure in life is determined not by intellectual knowledge or by savvy be-
havior but by loyalty to God and to his commandments: “Fortunate is every-
one who fears the Lord, who follows his ways (Ps 128:1; cf. Psalms 1, 37, and
112). In the Psalms, the path to wisdom is through following God’s com-
mandments (the same idea expressed in Eccl 12:13). And knowledge of the
commandments is achieved through the study of God’s words—learning
them, speaking them (Pss 1:2; 37:30–31; 119:12–16, 74–77 et passim). That
is, in the view of many psalms, the form in which wisdom is accessible to Israel
is through the Torah, the textual record of God’s words.2 The Torah makes
the simple wise (Ps 19:8). In this sense, there is little difference between “wis-
dom psalms” and “Torah psalms” (Psalms 1, 19, 119) except that the term
“Torah” appears in the second group.3
This connection between wisdom and Torah should be seen as having been
made under the inﬂuence of Deuteronomy, a book whose relationship to wis-
dom was explicated by Moshe Weinfeld some years ago.4 According to Wein-
feld, the beginning of deuteronomic literary activity (during the time of
Hezekiah) marks a turning point in the Israelite conception of wisdom. The
concept of wisdom then took on a new meaning. “The Deuteronomist no
longer conceived of ‘wisdom’ as meaning cunning, pragmatic talent, or the
possession of extraordinary knowledge, but held it to be synonymous with the
knowledge and understanding of proper behavior and with morality.” Wein-
feld goes on: “Until the seventh century Law and Wisdom existed as two sepa-
rate and autonomous disciplines. Law belonged to the sacral sphere, whereas
Wisdom dealt with the secular and the mundane. These two disciplines were
2. Clearly the Psalms and other parts of the Bible use “Torah” to indicate some known
traditional text, be it the Torah as we now have it or a precursor.
3. “Torah psalm” designates psalms that advocate the study of the Torah, such as Psalms
1, 19, and 119. James Luther Mays indicates that these three psalms are the only ones com-
posed on the theme of Torah, but he includes along with them, in his category of Torah
psalms, Psalms 18, 25, 33, 78, 89, 93, 94, 99, 103, 105, 111, 112, 147, 148 (“The Place of
the Torah-Psalms in the Psalter,” JBL 106 [1987] 8 n. 12). These psalms all have Torah in-
terests. They all follow the lead of Psalm 1 in the idea that God’s Torah is the concern of
the righteous and that adherence to it determines the individual’s success or failure.

amalgamated in the book of Deuteronomy, and the laws of the Torah were
now identiﬁed with wisdom.”5 The proof text is Deut 4:6–8, where obser-
vance of the laws is “proof of your wisdom and discernment to other peoples.”
For Deuteronomy, Israel’s wisdom is distinctive and superior to that of other
nations. It consists of God’s laws and rules, as revealed through Moses. (Notice
how close to this idea is Ps 119:98: “Your commandments make me wiser than
my enemies.”) Stephen A. Geller succinctly sums up the deuteronomic change
to wisdom in the following words: “The development of full biblical religion,
in the form of the Deuteronomic-covenantal complex, created a crisis for the
wise. Deuteronomy rejects wisdom that does not concern itself with revelation
and covenantal law.”6 In the exilic and postexilic periods, explains Geller, the
themes of the earlier traditional wisdom were combined with the newly
emerging faith. Eventually, as Geller puts it, “wisdom’s focus on nature gave
way entirely to a focus on covenant, with the results we see in the ‘Torah
psalms,’ of which Psalm 119 is the longest . . . example.”7
This does not mean that the focus on covenant completely blotted out con-
cern with nature and with the cosmos but, rather, that the consideration of na-
ture was drawn into the orbit of covenantal thought. In fact, the creation of the
world is a dominant motif in postexilic writings, a mainstay of covenantal
thought that shows God’s power over the universe, including the great empires
of Babylonia and Persia. Indeed, one might ask: Where in the Bible is the cre-
ation of the world not part of covenantal thought?8 The Bible views the creation
5. If this is so, as most scholars agree, then one may question how much, if any, of the
predeuteronomic view of wisdom has been preserved in the Bible. A few recent studies
suggest that such wisdom books as Job and Proverbs are more “covenantally” focused than
has been appreciated. See Mayer Gruber, “Human and Divine Wisdom in the Book of
Job,” in Boundaries of the Ancient Near Eastern World: A Tribute to Cyrus H. Gordon (ed. Meir
Lubetski, Clairs Gottlieb, and Sharon Keller; Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 1998) 88–

for Stephen A. Geller. See also Murphy, “Wisdom and Creation,” JBL 104 (1985) 3–11.

8. This question was posed by Roland Murphy, who argued that the God of wisdom and
the God of creation were viewed by ancient Israel as one and the same, and that creation/
wisdom was never outside the realm of faith. “Rather, the concept, as well as the develop-
ment of creation in wisdom theology, can be accepted as a genuine element (and not merely
an importation) of the faith of the Israelites as they encountered the Lord in the created
world” (“Wisdom and Creation,” 5). This position is diametrically opposed to E. Gersten-
berger, who says in reference to Psalm 104: “the major characteristics of God, humankind,
and world seem to be aligned to international wisdom rather than national Torah and elec-
tion theology” (Psalms, Part 2, and Lamentations, 226).

as God’s greatest accomplishment, with bringing Israel out of Egypt a close sec-
ond (or perhaps equal, as in Psalm 114). It is not strange, then, that creation
becomes a primary mode of praise for God, since God is known through what
he has done. Contemplating creation leads to the praise of God, or perhaps one
should say that contemplating creation is a form of praising God.9
It has been observed that the topic of creation is never an end in itself in
Psalms but always a trope or subtheme that supports a psalm’s main theme.
The psalm that appears to break this rule is Psalm 104, because, as some read
it, its main topic is creation.10 Meir Weiss has argued that it is not about cre-
ation per se but about praising God, like the many other psalms in which cre-
ation ﬁgures.11 True enough, but I think something more than just praise is at
issue in the psalm’s use of creation. Creation is a part of what God revealed of
himself to humans, a revelation that is impossible not to see. The natural world
is, as it were, an ongoing visual revelation, just as the Torah is an ongoing tex-
tual (or aural) revelation. That is the sense of Psalm 19, which draws a parallel
between the cosmos and the Torah, mapping one onto the other.12 In this way
is the cosmos drawn into the orbit of covenantal thought. God is revealed to
Israel both through creation and through Torah.
Like Psalm 19, Psalm 104 operates in this nexus of creation and Torah.
Clearly, the idea of wisdom in creation is paramount. Verse 24 (“How mani-
fold are your works, Lord; you made them all with wisdom; the earth is full
of your creations”) has been identiﬁed as central to the message of the psalm.
It implies that to understand creation is to understand wisdom. The wisdom
through which God created the world is, as the psalm demonstrates, manifest
in the created world. The effect of this line of thought is to make creation not
only a way to praise God but also a way of access to divine wisdom—that
same divine wisdom embodied in the Torah. There may be a stronger con-
nection between creation and Torah at the end of the psalm, in v. 32, which
describes God as “He who looks at the earth and it trembles, who touches the
mountains and they smoke.” This is the language of creation and of revelation
9. We see this also in Psalm 8, but whereas Psalm 8 celebrates the special place of hu-
mans in the cosmic hierarchy, Psalm 104 presents the cosmos as a nonhierarchical ecosystem
in which each component, including humans, is interconnected, and all are provided for.

The Wisdom of Creation in Psalm 104

(cf. Amos 9:5 and Ps 144:5). Exegetes have identiﬁed this as the language of
theophany, and it is especially close to Exod 19:18, where Mt. Sinai was all in
smoke and shaking. If this verse is an oblique allusion to that most famous
theophany, then it is implying that the God of creation is the God who re-
vealed himself at Sinai, the record of which is preserved in a written text. If
this psalm is exilic or postexilic, as I suspect it is, then the Sinai text is the To-
rah, just as it is in the “Torah psalms.”
Now while the term “Torah” is nowhere found in this psalm, the Torah
text is very much present, for the psalm is not simply employing the oft-used
theme of creation in a general sense but is speciﬁcally engaged with the story
of creation as recounted in the Torah, at the beginning of Genesis.13 The
psalm is a poetic retelling of the Genesis story, and it therefore falls under the
rubric of “innerbiblical interpretation.”14 I will not belabor the arguments
about whether, or to what degree, Psalm 104 is based on Genesis 1 or on other
ancient Near Eastern texts.15 It is clear to me that Genesis 1 informs the psalm,
although the psalm is also informed by other strands of cosmological thinking
common in the Bible and the ancient Near East (upon which Genesis 1 also
draws). I would point out that, whatever cosmological ideas were borrowed
from Israel’s neighbors, they had been borrowed long before the psalm was
written. All of them had worked their way into biblical literature by the time
of our psalmist, so he did not have far to go for them.16 The trend of reading
biblical texts against ancient Near Eastern counterparts, while extremely use-
ful, may exaggerate the “foreignness” of many cosmological ideas, which over
time became “Israelite” despite their foreign origins. This trend also tempo-
rarily diverted attention from the psalm’s allusions to Genesis 1. But given the
more recent interest in biblical intertextuality, especially innerbiblical interpre-
tation, it is time to revive the comparison of the psalm to Genesis 1.
13. While Genesis 1 is the main basis for the psalm, it also knows the story of Genesis
2–3. Human working of the soil is reﬂected in v. 14, and the creation of humans from dust
and God’s breath is alluded to in v. 29.
14. Other psalms in which I see the rewriting, or interpretation, of Torah texts include
68(?), 78, 81, 83(?), 89, 103, 105, 106, 114, 132, 135, and 136.
15. The Egyptian hymn “The Great Hymn to the Aten” bears many similarities, but its
relationship to the psalm is difﬁcult to ascertain. Most scholars today doubt any direct rela-
tionship, ascribing the similarities in language to the similar themes of the two poems. For
a summary of scholarship, see Leslie Allen, Psalms 101–150 (WBC; Waco, Tex.: Thomas
Nelson, 2002) 40–41. C. Uehlinger argues that vv. 25–26 are better explained as stemming
from Canaanite-Phoenician thought, as demonstrated by a cylinder seal from Tell el-Dabºa
(“Leviathan und die Schiffe in Ps 104, 25–26,” Bib 71 [1990] 499–526).

Poetry,” CBQ 29 (1967) 405–6.

The psalmist uses the Genesis blueprint, but he does not structure his pic-
ture of creation exactly the way Genesis does.17 He adds mythological refer-
ences, expands by association, and does not organize the events into a six- or
seven-day schema. As does Genesis 1, the psalmist speaks of the light, the sky,
the separation of the waters, the land with its vegetation, animals, the sun, and
the sea with its marine life; but the account is less rigid and the order is slightly
different. The psalm’s “dischronologizing” of the Genesis story results from
the way it organizes the domains of the world. I use “domains” to refer to the
sky, land, and sea—the habitats that according to Genesis were ﬁrst created
and then, in a second round, populated. Thus, according to Genesis, the sky
is ﬁrst created, but only later are the celestial bodies formed and placed in it;
the land is separated from the water, but only later are the water and land crea-
tures created. Psalm 104, on the other hand, treats everything in the sky at
once (vv. 2–4), everything on the land, including streams, rain, birds, and
sunshine (vv. 5–23), and ﬁnally everything in the sea (vv. 25–26). The psalm
does not structure the creation on a six- or seven-day plan and therefore at-
tempts to equate sections of the psalm with speciﬁc days in Genesis 1 fall short.
Instead, the psalm derives its structure from the story of the separation of the
waters: ﬁrst the separation of the waters above and below the ﬁrmament and
then the separation into dry land and seas. The psalm speaks ﬁrst of the do-
main of the sky, then of the dry land, and then of the sea. The thread that links
these three domains, especially the last two, is the water.
Additional observations: Genesis 1 has a God’s-eye perspective, whereas
Psalm 104 looks at the world through the eyes of humans, seeing what a per-
son standing on earth would see. The events of Genesis 1 are in the distant
past—it is the story of origins, the world at the beginning of time; Psalm 104
paints a picture of the present world—the (idyllic) world as it is now. What
does the psalmist see? What does the world look like? How is God envisioned?
These questions will be the focus of the remainder of this essay.
1. The Domain of the Sky: 
God Is Arrayed in His Creation
After opening with the idea that God is very great, the psalm describes God
as dressed in glory and majesty. The next verses elaborate: the majestic glory is
17. That Genesis 1 lies behind the psalm, or that it should be used as the interpretive
strategy for this psalm, is an old idea, espoused by, for example, the medieval exegete David
Qim˙i. Many modern scholars have outlined the similartities; see, for example, the chart in
Weiss, The Bible from Within, 89. Others try to ﬁnd a seven-part structure in the psalm, to
match the seven days of creation, but this is less convincing.

the light, heavens, waters, clouds, and wind. These are the ﬁrst things God
created, but in this poem they do not stand separate from God but serve as
God’s clothing and habitat—his suit, house, and car, as it were. The light is
like a robe; the sky is his curtain or tent cloth (cf. Isa 40:22)—the walls of his
house; the (upper) waters are his roof beams; the wind-driven clouds are his
chariot. At this point the description in Genesis is made more vivid by the pic-
turesque imagery of God riding on the clouds. Similar imagery is in Deut
33:26; Isa 19:1; Ps 18:11 = 2 Sam 22:11; and Ps 68:34, where God rides in the
sky, on the clouds, or on the wind. Drawing on storm imagery and the idea of
divine beings or angels, v. 4 makes the wind and lightning God’s servants, his
entourage. A similar idea is found in Ps 103:20–21, where the angels are de-
scribed as doing God’s bidding and the heavenly hosts, his servants, as doing
his will.18 While drawing on Genesis 1, the psalm has, with a few extra brush
strokes, painted a majestic picture of God as king in his heavenly abode. The
ﬁrst part of the creation becomes, through the poetry of this psalm, the heav-
enly place that God fashioned for himself. As Ps 11:4 puts it, “The Lord is in
his holy palace/Temple; the Lord, his throne is in heaven.”19 This is the do-
main of the sky, the domain of God. The sun and moon are not part of this
domain; the image of God residing in the heavens does not include the sun
and moon, although it may include the stars (cf. Isa 40:26). Therefore, the sun
and moon are relegated to the domain of the land (v. 19). For the same reason,
the birds are not in the sky but part of the land scene.
The domain of God is separate from the domain of the earth. The creation
of the earth is not mentioned until v. 5. Unlike Genesis 1, here heaven and
earth are separate entities, not part of a heaven-and-earth complex. God is al-
ready present, ensconced in his heavenly splendor, when he sets to work on
the earth and waters (cf. Ps 90:2).
2. The Creation of the World
Verses 5–9 describe the creation of the world in mythological terms—the
cosmic battle against the primeval waters—invoked elsewhere in psalms (e.g.,
18. James Kugel links this verse with the idea of angels developed more clearly in later
literature (The Bible as It Was [Cambridge: Belknap/Harvard University Press, 1997] 58–59).
19. It is possible, as J. C. McCann Jr. suggests, that the mention of h[yry is a reference
to the Temple, because the word is most frequently used in connection with the Tabernacle
(“Psalms,” NIB, 4:1097). However, I would not say, as he does, that “v. 2b then suggests
that God’s real house is not in the Temple but the universe.” There is no polemic here.
Rather, God’s abode is imagined to be like the Temple or Tabernacle, in the same manner
that God is often imagined as a king. The Temple, earthly or heavenly, is the palace of the
divine king.

Ps 29:3; see also Jer 5:22). In our psalm’s battle the cosmic waters are no real
rival to God, for he has complete control over them. He ﬁrst made the waters
cover the earth and then made them recede; then he barred them from ever
covering the earth again. While the imagery is mythological, the thought re-
ﬂects Gen 1:2 and 9, where the waters ﬁrst cover the earth and are then re-
moved. The land, with its topographical features, is already present but
submerged in water. As the water rushes away, it runs up the mountains and
down the valleys, till it reaches the place assigned to it, where it is permanently
restrained.20 The image of the waters covering the mountains may owe some-
thing to the Flood story, where the waters cover the mountains (Gen 7:19–
20, 24). The Flood is a return to the precreation state, before the waters were
separated by the ﬁrmament, when “all the fountains of the deep burst apart
and the ﬂoodgates of the sky broke open” (Gen 7:11). Our psalm later pictures
a more-benevolent watering of the earth from the streams and the rain.
3. The Domain of the Land
The domain of the land begins with a section (vv. 10–18) that encompasses
the work of the third and sixth days in Genesis 1, the creation of vegetation
and of land animals. Having disposed of the primeval waters, the psalmist now
looks at the land, but he does so by continuing the story of the waters, only
now these are the beneﬁcent waters of the streams and the rainfall (not the
cosmic waters that have been chased away and conﬁned to the seas). This sec-
tion connects nicely to the previous section through the mention of water and
mountains. In the place of the primeval waters running over the mountains in
their escape, we have the springs gushing through the mountains bringing the
water to sustain life. The mountains, the habitat of the wild animals, frames
the section, with humans at the center.
As in Genesis, the vegetation is of two types: grass (vv. 14–15) and trees
(vv. 16–17). Most of the wildlife mentioned by name is also found in Job 38–
39: mountain goat (v. 18; Job 39:1), wild ass (v. 11; Job 39:5), lion (cub)
(v. 21; Job 38:39), stork (v. 17; Job 39:13). The ˆpç ‘badger or coney’ is not
listed in Job but appears in Prov 30:26 as a weak animal that lives in the pro-
tection of the rocks, where the psalmist also locates it (v. 18). It seems likely
that this zoological taxonomy is part of a known list or catalog, of the type as-
20. The njpsv translation of v. 8, “mountains rising, valleys sinking” is incorrect; moun-
tains and valleys are not being formed. Better is the nrsv, “They rose up to the mountains,
ran down to the valleys.” The subject of these verbs is the waters, not the mountains and
valleys.

The Wisdom of Creation in Psalm 104

sociated with scribal circles, that poets deployed for their own purposes.21 If
so, this is another point of contact between the psalm and wisdom writings.
Psalm 104 and Job draw on the list for different ends, but both link the divine
knowledge and protection of wildlife to the creation. This is part of the “wis-
dom” with which the world was created.
What is the hmhb? This is another term from Genesis 1, usually translated
‘cattle’ (vv. 24–26). Does hmhb have the same meaning in v. 14 of our psalm?
Most commentaries think so, reasoning that domesticated animals immedi-
ately precede human agriculture. “God sends rain for domestic animals and
crops,” says R. Clifford, and S. Terrien speaks of “pastures for goats, sheep,
and cattle.”22 However, I want to argue for a more general meaning for hmhb
as a grass-eating animal, be it wild or domesticated. The combination of hmhb
and ryxj appears also in Ps 147:8–9 and in Job 40:15, where the general sense
of herbivore obtains. Job likens the hmhb to cattle (rqb) in that it eats grass. Ps
147:9 pairs it with birds of prey, carnivores. In neither of these references is
‘cattle’ or ‘domesticated animals’ the best reading. So too in Ps 104:14, where
the pairing of grass for the hmhb and herbage for human labor is better under-
stood as the pairing of the uncultivated vegetation (eaten by both domesti-
cated and wild animals) with the cultivated vegetation. The same type of
pairing of wild-animal activity and human activity is found in vv. 20–23. God
simultaneously provides for the natural world to get its food and for the hu-
man world to produce it.
The sun and moon, created on the fourth day in Genesis to be placed in the
sky, are here not part of the domain of the sky, but of the land. Their purpose
is not calendrical, but to “separate day from night,” to mark the diurnal cycle
of activity of the land creatures—their habitat in time. In this regard, the
moon is actually superﬂuous, because the setting and rising of the sun deter-
mines day and night; but it is mentioned along with the sun, much the way we
associate the sun with the day and the moon with the night.23 The nighttime

ﬁeld Academic Press, 1996) 84–114, on catalog literature, and pp. 95–96 on Psalm 104 in
particular. He considers the entire psalm to be a catalog, whose title is v. 24, “How many are
the things you have made, Lord; you made them all in wisdom.” See also idem, “:dq µylyht

(the moon does not mark seasons). The word µyd[wml comes from Gen 1:14, which the

world is the world of forest creatures, nocturnal predators, represented by lions
hunting for food. The daytime world is represented by humans doing their
work. These natural enemies, lions and humans, are here kept apart, their ac-
tivities assigned to mutually exclusive time-slots. Job 38:39 also uses the image
of the lion hunting prey that only God can provide.
A miniature of the same idea of God as creator and provider is in Ps 147:8–
9: “[God] who covers the sky with clouds, who provides the earth with rain,
who makes mountains sprout grass; he gives the animal (hmhb) its food, the
raven’s brood what they call for.”
4. Natural and Man-Made
The psalmist’s picture of the world includes both natural and man-made
elements, for it is not a picture of the beginning of the world but of the world
as it exists for the psalmist in real time. So human agricultural products—
wine, oil, and bread, signifying the three agricultural seasons and the basic
provisions for life—are mentioned in the domain of the land. (The more-
frequent triumvirate is ˆgd, çwryt, and rhxy.) The sun, too, is seen in reference
to the regularity of human work. In the same vein, ships take their place along
with sea creatures in the domain of the sea.24 The ships represent commerce;
or perhaps, as Qim˙i suggests, ﬁshing, which would make a nice parallel with
human agricultural endeavors. Human work and its products are celebrated in
the psalm as part of creation. Animals also “work,” doing what animals do:
wild animals ﬁnd food and drink (vv. 11, 21), birds sing (v. 12) and build nests
(v. 17). The purpose of all this work is to obtain food and shelter, which is
actually provided by God, who has arranged the world in such a way that all
its creatures ﬁnd (or produce) the food and shelter they need (vv. 27–28).
5. The Domain of the Sea
The story of the waters continues further. “God called the dry land Earth,
and the gathering of waters he called Seas,” says Gen 1:10. The psalm follows
this order: having described the domain of the earth/land, it now describes the
sea. The sea is large and wide, with an uncountable number of creatures in it.
“Living things great and small” may be a merismus for all sea life, or it may
reﬂect the two-part division of sea creatures in Gen 1:21: the sea monsters
(µylwdgh µynynth) and the swarming creatures.
24. Uehlinger points to Phoenician ships with animal-headed prows as an explanation of
why ships are included among the large sea animals (“Leviathan und die Schiffe,” 522–24).
njpsv translates “they shall serve as signs for set times—the days and the years.” Our psalm
is concerned only with days, not years.

The Wisdom of Creation in Psalm 104
81
Is the domain of the sea parallel to the domain of the land? We have seen
that the domain of the sky is set off separately from the land. Is the domain of
the sea also set apart from the land? The question arises because the summary
line in v. 24 precedes the mention of the sea and its constituents. One might
expect this verse to follow the domain of the sea, summing up all of creation,
including both land and sea domains. Secondly, the point of the description of
the domain of the land is to show how God provides food and shelter for all
his creatures. This is not the point of the description of the domain of the sea,
where the emphasis is, rather, on its size and the quantity of marine life. The
sea is deep and wide, and its creatures are without number. The domain of the
sea is a second illustration or proof of “how manifold are your works . . . the
whole earth is full of your creations.” Therefore, the phrase µyh hz is best ren-
dered as ‘such is the sea’, not ‘there is the sea’ (as if pointing to it in the dis-
tance).25 The main focus of the psalm is on the picture of the land, which
takes up the greatest number of verses and occupies the central position in the
structure. The sea, while part of the land-sea complex in the Genesis story, is
given less attention in the psalm. It is a side thought to explain part of v. 24.
The main thought of v. 24, “all of them you made with wisdom” is then con-
tinued in v. 27, “all of them look to you to give them their food.” Providing
food is the wisdom with which God created the world, and food is precisely
what was emphasized in the picture of the land. Nothing is said about food for
sea creatures.
6. Leviathan
What is the Leviathan? One possibility, the most widely-accepted one, is
that the Leviathan is the well-known mythical sea-serpent or sea monster. If
so, this ﬁgure serves here as an interpretation of the great serpents, µynynth
µyldgh, mentioned in Gen 1:21. This would then be an early reference to an
interpretation found in later literature.26 The sea monster, known from my-
thology and folklore, is not invoked here in the sense of a cosmic enemy or
symbol of evil. Rather, the monster has been “tamed”; it is no more threaten-
ing than the other inhabitants of the sea.
Another possibility is to understand Leviathan in the sense that many exe-
getes understand it in Job 40:25, as a crocodile. Given the other similarities to
Job 38–41 in this psalm, and given that the psalm is here describing the natural
25. For other examples of ‘such is’, see HALOT 1:264. Most translations take hz as in-
dicating distance, as if the psalmist is pointing to the sea, as in the nrsv’s “yonder is the sea.”
26. E. Lipinski (ˆt:y;w]lI, TDOT 7:506) cites (Ethiopic) 1 Enoch 60:7; 2 Esd 6:49; 2 (Apoc)
Bar 29:4; Gen. Rab. 7:4; Tg. Ps.-J. on Gen 1:21.

82
world rather than the mythological world, it may be better to take Leviathan
as a crocodile. This may explain why it is not included in the large marine
creatures in v. 25. Additionally, Job 40:29 asks if Job can play (qjçt) with the
Leviathan as with a bird—another suggestive connection between the psalm
(in v. 26 the Leviathan was created in order to play) and Job. These wonders
of the natural world are, like the cedars of Lebanon (v. 16), simply large-scale
examples of the wonders of the created world, on the land and in the sea.
Meir Weiss has opted for a more-mundane explanation, explaining the ety-
mology of “Leviathan” as the one who escorts (hwl) and understanding the
reference to tuna or tunny ﬁsh (or dolphins), which are often found in the
proximity of ships.27 This, says Weiss, is why the Leviathan is listed after the
ships rather than among the sea creatures “small and great.”
These interpretive possibilities are interesting, but in the end it is not cru-
cial to decide among them. It matters little whether the Leviathan is real or
mythological; the point is that it is large and lives in the sea. Verses 25–26 want
to say that the sea is teeming with life, and yet it is so vast that there is plenty
of room for large objects, ships, and a giant sea creature (be it a whale or the
Loch Ness monster) to move around in it.28 Verse 25 exempliﬁes living things;
v. 26 exempliﬁes large things, animate and inanimate.
7. The Ending of the Psalm
The description of creation ends in v. 26, yet the psalm continues. Not only
did God create the world, says the psalm (a world that is perfect in its plan and
execution), but God’s continued presence in the world is necessary. Without
God’s favor, all life will starve, perish, and disintegrate.
At stake in this psalm is more than just praising God for his wonderful and
wise creation. The psalmist is praying that God will not abandon his creation,
that life as we know it will not come to an end. The psalmist is praying for the
continuation of the world. If v. 24 is the ﬁrst key to the psalm, v. 31 is the sec-
ond: “May the Lord’s glory (dwbk) be forever; may the Lord rejoice in his
works.” The term dwbk means the manifestation of the divine presence that
ﬁlls the world (cf. Num 14:21; Ps 57:6, 12; 72:19; 108:6). In our psalm, God’s
presence, his dwbk, is manifest in creation, an idea shared with Ps 19:2: “The
27. Weiss, The Bible from Within, 91–93.
28. This interpretation requires parsing the syntax of v. 26b as “Leviathan that you
formed to sport in it” (nrsv), meaning that the Leviathan sports or plays in the sea, rather
than as “Leviathan that you formed to sport with” (njpsv), meaning that God sports with
the Leviathan. This is an old crux, reﬂected in ancient, medieval, and modern commentar-
ies. See Weiss, The Bible from Within, 78–93.

The Wisdom of Creation in Psalm 104
83
sky tells of the dwbk of God; the ﬁrmament proclaims his handiwork.” The
psalmist hopes that the divine presence will remain in the world and that God
will continue to approve of his creation, thereby guaranteeing its continued
existence.29 The disappearance of sinners (v. 35) reinforces the point, for sin-
ners undermine God’s favor to the world: they may cause God to hide his
face. To ensure that God will look with favor on the world, the psalmist
promises to praise him continually. Such is the power of prayer.
29. Amos Hacham sees in “May the glory of the Lord be forever” a counterpart to
“Long live the king” (µylht rps [ Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1990] 261). Several com-
mentaries suggest a relationship between God’s rejoicing in his works and Gen 1:31: “And
God saw all that he had made and behold it was very good.” The phrase “may God rejoice
in his works” is unusual; normally humans rejoice in God and his works, as the psalmist
does in v. 34.

Comparing Psalms and Proverbs
William P. Brown
Columbia Theological Seminary
Comparative studies of Psalms and wisdom have been limited largely to lo-
cating “wisdom psalms” in the Psalter,1 an endeavor recently and vigorously
called into question.2 Until certain criteria have attained universal consent (an
unlikely prospect), I propose advancing the discussion in a way that declines,
respectfully, the challenge to identify “wisdom psalms” as such. The burden of
proof lies in demonstrating that the allegedly wisdom material in the Psalms is
uniquely sapiential, an intractably difﬁcult, if not impossible, task.3 Neverthe-
less, identifying shared rhetoric between Psalms and the wisdom literature is
1. Or, more modestly, units of sapiential rhetoric allegedly reﬂecting the editorial hand of
the sages. Representative examples include, on the maximalist side, Roland Murphy, “A
Consideration of the Classiﬁcation ‘Wisdom Psalms,’” in Congress Volume: Bonn 1962 (VTSup
9; Leiden: Brill, 1962) 156–67; J. Kenneth Kuntz, “The Canonical Wisdom Psalms of An-
cient Israel: Their Rhetorical, Thematic, and Formal Dimensions,” in Rhetorical Criticism: Es-
says in Honor of James Muilenburg (ed. Jared Jackson and Martin Kessler; Pittsburgh: Pickwick,
1974) 186–222; Leo Perdue, Wisdom and Cult: A Critical Analysis of the Views of Cult in the
Wisdom Literature of Israel and the Ancient Near East (SBLDS 30; Missoula, Mont.: Scholars
Press, 1977); Anthony Ceresko, “The Sage in the Psalms,” in The Sage in Israel and the Ancient
Near East (ed. John Gammie and Leo Perdue; Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1990) 217–
30; R. N. Whybray, “The Wisdom Psalms,” in Wisdom in Ancient Israel: Essays in Honour of
J. A. Emerton (ed. John Day et al.; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995) 152–60.
A comparatively minimalist view is found in Avi Hurvitz, “Wisdom Vocabulary in the He-
brew Psalter: A Contribution to the Study of ‘Wisdom Psalms,’” VT 38 (1988) 41–51; idem,
Wisdom Language in Biblical Psalmody ( Jerusalem: Magnes, 1991) [Hebrew].

no vain exercise. Sharing more than just a few words, these two corpora ex-
hibit similar language, parallel motifs and metaphors, and comparable didactic
aims.4 Yet it is precisely their rhetorical afﬁnities that help to delineate their
divergent emphases. Differences, after all, can be measured in degrees; apples
and oranges belong to the same food group.5
In the face of the current impasse, new questions need to be asked that afford
more subtle and suggestive comparisons. How do Psalms and Proverbs, for ex-
ample, deploy didactic rhetoric within their respective contexts and to what
ends? This essay examines several so-called “wisdom psalms” (Psalms 32, 34,
37, and 111–112, as well as Psalm 78)6 and identiﬁes their distinctive goals and
theological nuances in relation to comparable motifs and passages in Proverbs.
Psalm 37
Roland Murphy declares, “if ever a psalm could be classiﬁed as wisdom, it
is this one.”7 Its tone is thoroughly admonitory, and proﬁles of the righteous
and the wicked are sharply contrasted. The psalm’s central theme is indicated
in the opening verse and effectively summarized in v. 7:
Be still (µwd)8 before Yhwh,
and wait passionately (llwjth)9 for him.
4. By “didactic,” I simply mean anything meant for instruction that is explicitly indicated
as such by form and/or language. Didactic literature is by no means limited to Psalms and
the wisdom literature and could include the prophetic summons to pay attention (see, for
example, Deut 31:12–13; Isa 1:2–3; 28:23–29; Jer 9:20; Joel 1:2–3; Amos 3:3–8). For an
overview of biblical and other ancient Near Eastern witnesses to education, see James
Crenshaw, Education in Ancient Israel: Across the Deadening Silence (New York: Doubleday,
1998) 51–220.
5. Tellingly, both Kuntz and Crenshaw regard the image of two similar buildings as an apt
analogy for the overlapping of vocabulary and concepts between the wisdom literature and
Psalms (Crenshaw, “Gold Dust?” 156–57; Kuntz, “Reclaiming Biblical Wisdom Psalms,”
149).
6. Other “wisdom psalms,” so called by some, include Psalms 1, 19, 49, 119, and 127,
three of which are better labeled Torah psalms (see James Mays, “The Place of the Torah-
Psalms in the Psalter,” JBL 106 [1987] 3–12). For the purposes of this essay, I have selected
those psalms most frequently labeled sapiential (with the exception of Psalm 49; see n. 37).
7. Roland Murphy, The Gift of the Psalms (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2000) 88. Sam-
uel Terrien refers to this acrostic as a “sapiential homily” (The Psalms: Strophic Structure and
Theological Commentary [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003] 317, 322–32).
8. For the use of this verb, which does not occur in Proverbs, see Pss 4:5; 31:18; 62:6;
131:2.
9. The verb can suggest writhing ( Job 15:20), as in the case of giving birth (Isa 51:2),
dancing ( Judg 21:21), and anxiety (Esth 4:4). The parallelism suggests that “waiting” for
God is no passive exercise; rather, it involves pathos.

Do not get worked up (rjttAla) over those who prosper in their way;
[do not fret] over those who carry out evil schemes.
Characteristic of the psalm as a whole, this verse is balanced by positive and
negative commands. The positive imperatives proﬁle a certain posture before
Yhwh (v. 7a), namely that of patient longing, whereas the negative command
(repeated elliptically in the ﬁnal colon) does the same vis-à-vis the wealthy
wicked (v. 7b). The juxtaposition of commands betrays a striking irony: a pos-
ture of restraint is commanded with respect to both the wicked and the deity.
They require concomitant orientations. This paradox of God and the wicked
sharing the same syntactic stage is, however, signaled only here. The com-
mands in vv. 1, 7b, and 8 exhort an attitude of restraint vis-à-vis the wicked.
But much more is enjoined with respect to one’s orientation toward God, as
indicated in the positive commands: “Trust in Yhwh” (v. 3a; see v. 5b); “Take
delight in Yhwh” (v. 4); “Commit your way to Yhwh” (v. 5a); and “Wait for
Yhwh, and keep to his way” (v. 34). Most explicit in v. 7a, the proclivity to-
ward anger against the wicked is transformed into passionate longing for God
(compare Psalm 73).
The problem of the wicked and their attendant success is acknowledged
and resolved in a series of assurances regarding their imminent destruction10
and the vindication of the righteous.11 The present condition of disparity is to
be reversed: “The meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abun-
dant riches” (v. 11; see also vv. 9, 22). In the meantime, the psalmist offers a
typically, but not exclusively, sapiential expression in v. 16, a Tobspruch. The
righteous are to be, for the time being, content with their meager resources.
Thus, to “wait for Yhwh” is, in part, to wait with assurance for the passing of
the wicked “yet in a little while” (v. 10).
This “wisdom psalm” bears certain rhetorical similarities to Proverbs, while
exhibiting its own distinctive emphases. Although the players remain the same
by name or role (that is, the righteous, the wicked, and the speaking voice of
experience), Psalm 37 places proportionally greater emphasis on the destiny
and condition of the wicked and the righteous than on their general conduct.
The conduct of the wicked is an issue primarily insofar as it impacts the wel-
fare of the righteous (vv. 12, 14, 21, 32, 35). Only peripherally are the wicked
indicted for unethical behavior apart from their persecution of the righteous.
Conversely, the righteous are distinguished, in addition to their moral con-
duct, by the protective favor they (are to) receive from God. The wicked are
destined by God for destruction; the righteous, for prosperity in the land.

Akin to wisdom’s laughter over the imminent destruction of scoffers (Prov
1:26–27), “Yhwh laughs at the wicked, for he sees that their day is coming”
(v. 13), and on that day the righteous shall “inherit the land” (vv. 9, 22, 29,
34).12 In the meantime, however, the righteous assume a distinctively unsapi-
ential proﬁle: they are vulnerable and victimized; they have “little” (v. 16).13 Be-
set by hardship, they are the “meek” and the “poor and needy” (vv. 11, 14).14
This sort of identiﬁcation of the righteous is largely absent in Proverbs. At
stake in the psalm is the vindication of the righteous (v. 6), indeed their deliv-
erance from the wicked, not their enlightenment or moral growth.
Consonant with proverbial literature, the righteous in this psalm are ethi-
cally deﬁned by both their mouth and their heart:15
The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom,
and their tongues speak justice.
The law [or teaching, hrwt] of their God is in their hearts;
their steps do not slip. (vv. 30–31)
Wisdom and justice characterize the discourse of the righteous, but an inner
source is identiﬁed that is not given full play in Proverbs, namely, divine “law”
lodged in the “heart.”16 In Proverbs, wisdom penetrates the heart (for example,
Prov 2:2, 10; 14:33). In Psalm 37, this implanted “law,” or divine guidance,17
12. The expression is not found in Proverbs, but see Prov 2:21–22; 10:30. The ﬁgure
of the righteous in Psalm 37 takes on a more disenfranchised position than in Proverbs with
respect to the “land.”
13. Several psalms identify the righteous or speaking voice of the Psalms with the
“poor” and “needy” (for example, Pss 40:18[17]; 70:6[5]; 86:1; 109:22). For a general de-
scription of the vulnerable righteous in the Psalter, see J. Clinton McCann Jr., “‘The Way
of the Righteous’ in the Psalms: Character Formation and Cultural Crisis,” in Character and
Scripture (ed. William Brown; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2002) 141–42. For a more mate-
rialist proﬁle of poverty in the Psalms, see John Pleins, The Social Visions of the Hebrew Bible:
A Theological Introduction (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2001) 419–37.
14. The “poor” and the “needy” are referenced in altogether four passages in Proverbs,
and in no instance are these categories identiﬁed with the righteous (Prov 14:31; 30:14;
31:9, 20). Indeed, it is the righteous who are consistently in the position of helping the needy
(31:9, 20; see also 29:7). In the Psalms, God is the one who rescues the needy. Positive ref-
erences to the poor in Proverbs are found primarily in the Tobsprüche (Prov 19:1, 22; 28:6;
see also 28:11).
15. See Prov 2:2, 10; 3:1, 3; 4:21, 23; 10:8; 16:21; 23:15.
16. In Proverbs, Torah is referenced in the ﬁrst nine chapters as parental “teaching”
(Prov 1:8; 3:1; 4:2; 6:20, 23), but its more legislative sense is found concentrated in chaps.
28–29, part of the Hezekian collecton, where Torah is treated as something external yet
without reference to the deity (28:4, 7, 9; 29:9, 18).

is directly tied to the deep desires of those who “trust in Yhwh” (v. 4): “law”
and desire meet in the heart. As the seat of volition, the “heart” is the natural
repository for appropriated “law.” This sort of “law” makes for right conduct,
ensuring safe passage through life (v. 31b). Consonant with rabbinic halakah,
“law” and “way” are integrally related.
The familiar metaphor of the “way” wends through this psalm, as it does
through much of Proverbs.18 There is the deity’s “way,” enjoined by the
psalmist (v. 34a), and there is the “way” of the righteous, whose “steps do not
slip” and are “made ﬁrm by Yhwh” (vv. 23–24, 31). The way of the wicked,
so prevalent in Proverbs, is scarcely mentioned in the psalm (only obliquely in
v. 7). Indeed, like Proverbs 1–9, two distinct “ways” are mapped in Psalm 37.
But, unlike Proverbs, the two ways in the psalm are not diametrically op-
posed, as evident in the following two injunctions:
Commit your way to Yhwh;
trust in him, and he will act (v. 5).
Wait for Yhwh and keep to his way,
and he will exalt you to inherit the land (v. 34a).
The merging of Yhwh’s “way” and the addressee’s “way,” of divine guidance
and human conduct, is rife with soteriological signiﬁcance. Compared to
Proverbs, reference to the via dei appears distinctive in this psalm, although the
motif is in fact quite common throughout the Psalter.19 The two “ways” in
Proverbs are those of the righteous and the wicked,20 but explicit reference to
the deity’s way is scarce.21 Telling are the injunction in Ps 37:5, cited above,
and a parallel in Prov 16:3a:
Commit your work to Yhwh,
and your plans will be established.
Developed throughout the psalm,22 the force of the injunction in Ps 37:5b
(“trust”) bears far less rhetorical weight in Proverbs.23 Similarly, the motif of

20. For the way of the wicked, see Prov 1:15, 31; 2:12, 18; 4:14, 19; 7:27; 8:13; 12:15
(“fools”), 26; 13:15; 15:19 (“lazy”). For the way of the righteous, see 2:8, 20; 3:23; 4:11

“waiting” for God is virtually absent in Proverbs.24 Thus, the psalmist’s call for
restraint “from anger” (v. 8a), a value prized also in proverbial instruction,25 is
given a distinctly theocentric cast: the outcome is God’s action (v. 5b), not
necessarily success in human devices.
Another motif that receives prominent attention in the psalm, and indeed
throughout the Psalter, but not as such in the proverbial literature, is that of
divinely established “refuge”:26
The salvation of the righteous is from Yhwh;
he is their refuge (zw[m) in the time of trouble.
Yhwh helps them and rescues them;
he rescues them from the wicked and saves them,
because they take refuge (wsj) in him. (vv. 39–40)
The theme of “refuge” marks a ﬁtting conclusion to the salviﬁc promise given
in the psalm, namely, deliverance from the wicked. As destination, “refuge” is
the locus of divine protection for the righteous, who “keep to [Yhwh’s] way”
(v. 34). To “take refuge” in God is to trust in Yhwh, the provider of security.
Psalm 34
A thanksgiving psalm cast as an acrostic, Psalm 3427 opens with words of
praise (vv. 2–4) and, like Psalm 37, concludes with reference to the righteous
and the wicked (vv. 16–23): the righteous enjoy God’s protective favor in the
face of their “afﬂictions” (v. 20), whereas “evil” and “condemnation” are the
designated lot of the wicked (v. 22). Between these two sections is the
speaker’s testimony of divine deliverance (vv. 5–11), followed by an explicitly
didactic address (vv. 12–15). Like the instructional material in Proverbs, this
address opens with a call to attention that marks the audience as recipients of
moral counsel (“children”),28 matched by the speaker’s desire to “teach . . .
the fear of Yhwh” (compare v. 10). The initial exhortation is followed by a
statement of motivation (v. 13), cast as a rhetorical question, which leads to a
24. Only Prov 20:22 provides a parallel to the psalmist’s injunction to “wait” for God.
25. See the expression “slow to anger” in Prov 14:29; 15:18; 16:32; 19:11. Compare
12:16; 15:1; 22:8, 24; 29:11, 22; 30:33.
26. Only Prov 14:26 and 30:5 make explicit reference to “refuge.” For a full study of
this theme in the Psalter, see Jerome Creach, Yahweh as Refuge and the Editing of the Hebrew
Psalter ( JSOTSup 217; Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 1996). That is not to say that
wisdom does not take on a function of refuge by, for example, protecting the “son” from the
“smooth tongue of the alien woman” (Prov 6:24).

series of general moral admonitions (vv. 14–15). This section is followed by
concluding observations about the deity’s orientation toward the righteous
and the wicked (vv. 16–23).
As a whole, the moral exhortation of vv. 12–15 not only invests this thanks-
giving psalm with didactic intent; it renders a complex proﬁle of the speaking
voice. The “poor soul” who is “saved from every trouble” (v. 7) is identiﬁed as
one who teaches (vv. 12–13). This teacher counts himself among “the broken-
hearted” (v. 19a), “the crushed in spirit” (v. 19b), and “the humble” (v. 3b), as
well as among “the righteous” (v. 16), who undergo many “afﬂictions” (v. 20),
and Yhwh’s “servants.” The speaker’s character provides testimonial credence
to the general observation that Yhwh delivers the righteous. Along with gen-
eral moral counsel (vv. 13–15), the soteriological side of the deity forms an
integral part of the psalmist’s teaching. Linked to the boast of blessing (v. 3),
the psalmist’s testimony of deliverance provides the basis for thanksgiving and
admonition.
The exhortation to “fear Yhwh” encapsulates the prescriptive force of the
entire psalm. A motif in both psalmic and sapiential literature, divine rever-
ence constitutes the expressed object of the psalmist’s teaching (vv. 10, 12) yet
lacks the distinctly cognitive focus it is given in Proverbs 1–9.29 In the psalm,
reverence is not so much the object of understanding and knowledge30 as the
subject of personal testimony and holy orientation. Such “fear” is life-giving
(v. 13)31 and sufﬁcient for all needs (v. 10b).32 To “fear Yhwh” is to “seek
Yhwh” (v. 11) and, thereby, to reﬂect God’s holy effulgence in joy (v. 6).
“Fear of Yhwh” casts out “all . . . fears” (v. 5). Such reverence, moreover, has
its home in refuge, which confers happiness (v. 9b) and security (see v. 8). By
coordinating these two motifs, the psalmist cements their connection such
that one takes on the characteristics of the other (vv. 8–9, 22). Refuge-taking
is as much a matter of moral orientation as reverence is charged with saving
signiﬁcance. “None of those who take refuge in [Yhwh] will be condemned”
(v. 23; compare Ps 52:9[7]).
To sum up, where psalmic teaching and sapiential admonition seem joined
in Ps 34:12–15, the motif of divine reverence functions differently in each cor-
pus. In the psalm, reverence establishes “refuge” from evildoers; in Proverbs,
the “fear of Yhwh” provides enlightenment and fosters integrity, the beginning
29. See, especially, Prov 1:7; 2:5. The latter places “fear” and “knowledge” in parallel
positions. Drawing from Dermot Cox, Michael Fox deﬁnes this fear as “conscience” or
“deep knowledge” (Proverbs 1–9 [AB 18A; New York: Doubleday, 2000] 70).

point of moral growth (Prov 1:7; 9:10). For the psalmist, salvation—rather than
formation—is paramount.
Psalm 32
One of the so-called penitential psalms, this thanksgiving song opens with
two macarisms that extol the related conditions of forgiveness and innocence
(vv. 1–2), followed by an account of personal afﬂiction (vv. 3–4) and a confes-
sion of sin marking a dramatic turn-around in the psalmist’s state (vv. 5–7).
Employing the standard terminology of forgiveness, the psalmist proclaims
that God has “lifted the guilt of my sin” (v. 5b). The consequent release of the
psalmist’s burden leads to a joyful exhortation to prayer and a profession of
God’s protective care from the fearsome “many waters” (v. 6). God, the
psalmist declares, has become a “hidden shelter (rts)”; the speaker is sur-
rounded “by glad cries of deliverance” (v. 7). This joyous scene of the sanctu-
ary is interrupted by the directive words of instruction in vv. 8–9. This section
signals instructional intent and is followed with a general observation about
the afﬂictions of the wicked and the protection that divinely wrought dsj
affords the one “who trusts in Yhwh” (v. 10b). A call for the righteous to re-
joice concludes the psalm (vv. 10–11). Psalm 32, in short, begins with a be-
atitude and ends in a command to joyful praise; in between unfolds a personal
testimony of forgiveness and instruction.
The placement of this didactic passage is telling. The setting of the sanctu-
ary presupposed in the previous section marks vv. 8–9 as an oracle. Yhwh re-
sponds to the psalmist’s statement of forgiveness with words of instruction.33
The reference to the “eye upon you” conﬁrms the source of instruction.34
This divine intrusion plays an integral role within the psalm as a whole. Words
of counsel follow forgiveness. The main speaker in the psalm has committed
sin, suffered for it, come to acknowledge it, and is forgiven (vv. 3–5). Exhor-
tation is then given, and a profession of trust is made (v. 7), a seemingly ﬁtting
conclusion that proves to be merely provisional in light of the psalm’s larger
context. Verse 8 signals a turning point from personal testimony of the past to
future orientation, from forgiveness to counsel. The didactic passage, in short,
gives shape to the forgiven self and identiﬁes the role of instruction as the out-
come and goal of the repentant life. Refuge (v. 7) gives way to pathway (v. 8),
security to conduct.
As a whole, Psalm 32 claims forgiveness as the fundamental starting point
of faithful conduct. By contrast, the wisdom literature has little to say about
33. Terrien refers to vv. 8–9 as a “sapiential oracle” (The Psalms, 294).
34. See also Judg 18:6; Ezra 5:5; Ps 33:18; Zech 12:4. Compare Isa 30:20–21.

divine forgiveness.35 The starting point of moral formation in Proverbs, for
example, is the renouncement of immaturity (Prov 9:6) and a willingness to
receive instruction (1:21–33) and obtain wisdom (4:5–8). The psalm, how-
ever, establishes the occasion of instruction within an explicitly cultic setting
(that is, a setting of prayer, refuge, and praise) by situating confession and for-
giveness as foundational for wise conduct.
Psalm 78
Only a few have regarded Psalm 78 as sapiential,36 and for good reason: the
psalm provides a lengthy account of Israel’s national history, a subject entirely
lacking in the wisdom literature. Nevertheless, the psalm opens in vv. 1–2
with explicitly didactic terminology:
Listen, my people, to my teaching (ytrwt)!
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth (yp yrma)!
I shall open my mouth with instruction (lvm);
and draw hidden truths (twdyj) from of old.
The terminology of this exordium resembles the opening words of Proverbs
(1:2, 6).37
To know wisdom and instruction (rswmw hmkh),
to understand words of insight (hnyb yrma). . . .
To understand a saying (lvm) and a ﬁgure (hxylm),
the words of the wise (µymkj yrbd) and their enigmas (µtdyj).
Both passages share two common terms of instruction, lvm and hdyj,38 as
well as several related terms. They mark what follows as distinctly didactic in
function. But the rhetorical similarities are not limited to these introductions.
Proverbs moves immediately into a parental lecture, that of a father to a son
(1:8–19); Psalm 78 also slides effortlessly into a world of generational division
in vv. 3–8.

37. See also Ps 49:2–4[1–4]. Psalm 49 is identiﬁed by many as a “wisdom psalm,” but
its rhetorical afﬁnities lie more with Ecclesiastes; hence, it is not treated in this essay.

9, 54–55). For further interpretation, see Otto Eissfeldt, Der Maschal im Alten Testament
(BZAW 24; Giessen: Alfred Töpelmann, 1913) 13–14; Gerstenberger, Psalms, Part 2, 93–
94. The term hdyj is not unique to the wisdom literature (see Ezek 17:2; Hab 2:6).

The differences, however, are suggestive. Whereas the speaker in Prov 1:8–
19 conveys nonnegotiable parental instructions, the psalmist expresses the
words of “sons” who bear witness to the counsel and failures of their “fathers.”
Together, these passages hold, as it were, an intergenerational conversation.
The psalmist at once venerates and disparages the “fathers”; the parental sage
imposes counsel upon a receptive son. In Proverbs, the son never speaks; in
Psalm 78, the corporate speaker talks back, as it were. Both the sage and the
psalmist are mutually concerned with the transmission of tradition from one
generation to the next (see Prov 4:1–4). But the psalmist stops short of en-
couraging a seamless transmission of tradition and example. To be sure, what
the “fathers have told” must not be “concealed,” but the previous generations
failed to live up to their own testimony, itself a testimony that invites critical
appropriation of the past.
In addition, the issues at stake differ signiﬁcantly. The parental ﬁgure in
Proverbs warns the son of the dangers of highway robbery and greed (1:10–
19) and, later, urges him to obtain wisdom and to avoid adulterous women
(4:5–9; 5:1–20; 7:1–27).39 Featured also are occasional references to trusting
in or fearing Yhwh and to the salutary beneﬁts that accrue from doing so (1:7;
2:5; 3:5–9, 11; 9:10). Lacking, however, is any sense of corporate historical
consciousness; the rhetorical world of Proverbs is immediate and crisis-ﬁlled.
The didactic discourse of Psalm 78 is not a parental lecture but a history les-
son. The psalm charts the history of Israel’s failure in the wilderness, from the
exodus to the occupation of the land, met by God’s forbearance (vv. 12–55).
Divine restraint, however, comes with a cost: Israel’s progressive rebellions
lead ultimately to God’s rejection of the Northern Kingdom and to Zion’s
election (vv. 56–72). The psalmist’s “teaching” is, at base, a corporate narra-
tive. Inextricably related are God’s mighty deeds, on the one hand, and cove-
nantal obedience, on the other. Binding law and glorious deed issue from the
same source and, thus, bear comparable prescriptive force (vv. 10–11). Israel’s
failure was to refuse and to forget, a failure on two counts: to abide by God’s
“commandments” and to remember the “works of God” (v. 7). The sin that
breaks the forbearance is idolatry (v. 58), a renunciation of God’s integrity as
both savior and lawgiver. For the psalmist, God’s saving deed and binding law
form a seamless unity reﬂected, at the level of praxis, in an ethos of gratitude
and obedience.40
39. For a discussion the sage’s central concern about the dangers of adultery, see Fox,
Proverbs 1–9, 252–62.
40. For comparable presentation of the essential unity of divine deed and law, see the
Prologue of the Decalogue (Exod 20:2; Deut 5:6; compare 6:20–25).

“Come, O Children . . . I Will Teach You the Fear of the Lord”
95
As in the psalm, the morally formed individual (the “son”) in Proverbs 1–
9 is one who “trusts in Yhwh” (3:5a; compare v. 9). The opposite of this trust,
however, is not idolatry—indeed no reference to idolatry is given in Prov-
erbs—but exclusive trust in one’s “own insight” and being “wise” in one’s
“own eyes” (3:5b, 7). Intellectual hubris, not apostate worship, is the cardinal
sin for the sage.
Moreover, the respective objects of teaching highlighted in Psalm 78 and
Proverbs 1–9 are different. The father ﬁgure in Proverbs 1–9 exhorts the son
to “possess,” “keep,” and “love” wisdom (4:5–6). Although the “son” is ex-
horted to “guard her” (v. 13), it is she who guards the son, ensuring safe pas-
sage (“way”) through life (see 2:10–12; 3:21–23; 4:6). She acts, as it were, in
tandem with the deity; for Yhwh, the source of wisdom (2:6), also secures the
wise one (3:26). Wisdom’s content features a trinity of cardinal virtues: justice,
righteousness, and equity (1:3; 2:8–9). Wisdom is “every good path” (2:9)
and the ultimate prize in a life well lived (4:5–9). More precious than jewels,
she is the supreme object of desire (3:15), the son’s most intimate “kin” or
friend (7:4). Wisdom’s acquisition, then, is the goal of learning by which the
son is properly domesticated.41
The content of the psalmist’s teaching features a dual-object of learning:
God’s “works” and God’s “commandments” (Ps 78:7). Adopting the meta-
phor of the “way,” the psalmist indicts Israel for refusing “to walk in [Yhwh]’s
law” (v. 10b).42 This “law” (“decree,” “commandments,” “covenant,” “de-
crees”) is not enumerated except insofar as it can be inferred from Israel’s vari-
ous failures: rebellion (vv. 17, 40), testing (vv. 18, 41), lack of trust in God’s
power (vv. 22, 32, 42), lying to God (v. 36), worshiping at high places (v. 58a),
and idolatry (v. 58b). The “law” behind the failures demands exclusive alle-
giance to God. The ﬂipside of this allegiance is trust in God’s power to save,
also a topic of inquiry. As another psalm states, “Great are the works of Yhwh,
examined (µyvwrd) by all who delight in them” (111:2). God’s wonders and
God’s law are the constituent halves of the same object of learning, and lack-
ing is any speciﬁed mediator. Neither wisdom nor Moses makes an appearance
in this psalm. Obedience and trust in God are of greatest importance to the
psalmist.
41. Indeed, Yhwh is also domesticated in Proverbs, namely, as a reproving “father,” a
parental guide (Prov 3:12). For a discussion of the deity’s proﬁle in this text, see Lennart
Boström, The God of the Sages: The Portrayal of God in the Book of Proverbs (ConBOT 29;
Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell, 1990) 223–24.

Whereas the God of Proverbs 1–9 is cast primarily in the image of a paren-
tal sage who rebukes and instructs individuals (Prov 3:12), the God of the
psalmist’s “teaching” is both lawgiver and savior, one who redeems and con-
stitutes a people. God’s wondrous works and authoritative guidance, divine
deed and commandment, are indispensable to the psalmist’s curriculum. His-
tory bears witness to God’s saving works; human integrity embodies God’s
law. For the sage, the mythos of God’s mighty deeds and the ethos of covenantal
law or teaching do not replenish the fount of either wisdom or reverence.
Rather, wisdom is evinced in the natural order (Prov 3:19–20; 8:22–31) and
reﬂected in a prudential life of discipline.
United in didactic intent, the psalmist and the sage also render different, al-
beit complementary, proﬁles of human integrity. In the psalm, adherence to
divine law and attention to divine deed inspires “hope in God” (v. 7), a “heart
steadfast toward God” (vv. 8a, 37a), faithfulness (v. 8), obedience to God’s
covenant and decrees (vv. 17, 37b, 56), earnest seeking of God (v. 34), and
trust in God’s works and saving power (vv. 22, 42). Not one trait of moral
character is named without reference to God. Not so in Proverbs: offering
counsel in familial responsibility, neighborliness, and moral conduct, wisdom
is the primary shaper of character.
Psalms 111–112
As commonly recognized, these two psalms—Zwillingspsalmen43—are com-
positionally paired. Both are cast in short acrostic form, and a number of verbal
and thematic correspondences can be discerned across their distinctive genres.44
Psalm 111 is a thanksgiving song that opens with a command to praise and
an expressed desire to give thanks (v. 1). The psalm continues with ascriptions
of praise that honor God’s “wonderful deeds” (vv. 2–4a), which include pro-
viding food (v. 5a), establishing and abiding by an eternal covenant (vv. 5b, 9b),
granting Israel an “international heritage” (v. 6b), establishing “his precepts”
(vv. 7b–8), and redeeming “his people” (v. 9a). These deeds allude to Yhwh’s
historical guidance in the wilderness and establishment of Israel in the land.
God’s “work” is characterized by “splendor and majesty” (rdhw dwh, v. 3) and
described as “faithful and just” (fpvmw tma, v. 7a). Apart from the references
to the deity’s various deeds, Yhwh (or Yhwh’s “name”) is described as “gra-

cious and merciful” (µwjrw ˆwnj, v. 4b) and “holy and fearsome” (arwnw vwdq,
v. 9b). The psalm (v. 10a) concludes with a sapiential-like saying:
The fear of Yhwh is the beginning of wisdom;
comprehension of the good (bwf lkc)
is for all who perform them (µhyc[ lkl).45
While the ﬁrst colon of this couplet appears in variant forms in Prov 1:7, 9:10,
and Sir 1:14 (see also Job 28:28), its association with covenantal praxis is un-
precedented from a sapiential perspective. Indeed, the second line serves to
qualify the ﬁrst. Nowhere in Proverbs is wisdom or reverence referred to as
something done or performed. Wisdom, rather, is found and possessed; reverence
is chosen and understood.46 In Proverbs, they are primarily objects of attainment.
The psalmist offers a different nuance: wisdom and reverence constitute an ex-
plicit level of covenantal praxis: wisdom is evidenced in fulﬁlling the divine
commandments (compare Deut 4:5–6). Wisdom is contextually related, more-
over, to the capacity to render praise and give thanks (vv. 1b, 10b). To “fear
Yhwh” is to give due praise and thanks, a wise thing to do in the psalmist’s
estimation. Praise and thanksgiving, however, do not fall within the scope of
sapiential conduct in Proverbs.
Psalm 112 is often considered the sequel to the previous psalm, perhaps
both psalms forming a pilgrimage litany.47 Of the two, Psalm 112 is more of-
ten regarded as a “wisdom psalm,” even though Psalm 111 features the pro-
verbial saying about wisdom. In any case, both psalms contain numerous
thematic and verbal correspondences. Psalm 112 opens with an identical “hal-
lelujah” command, immediately followed by a macarism: “Happy is the one
who fears Yhwh, who delights greatly in his commandments” (v. 1b). Re-
gardless of whether the saying draws from a uniquely sapiential genre, the
content forges a direct comparison between “wisdom” in 111:10 and “com-
mandments” in 112:1b (see also 111:7b), as well as the “works of Yhwh” in
111:2. Through the juxtaposition of these two psalms, divine deed, com-
mand, and wisdom are inseparably bound.
45. The antecedent of the masculine-plural sufﬁx in the MT is a crux. The LXX and
Peshi†ta feature a feminine singular, presupposing “wisdom.” The MT, however, bears the
more difﬁcult reading, whose antecedent is evidently “precepts” in v. 7b.
46. The “fear of Yhwh” is chosen (rjb, Prov 1:29) and understood (ˆyb, 2:5); a person
is “in” reverence of God (14:26; 23:17). “Wisdom,” similarly, is something chosen, re-
ceived, found, bought, loved, and possessed or appropriated (for example, 2:2a, 10; 3:13;
4:5, 7; 10:13; 16:16; 19:20; 23:23; 29:3), as well as understood and communicated (2:2b;
10:31). Only Prov 28:26 contains the expression “walk in wisdom.”

Together, the psalms effectively join the theocentric and the anthropocen-
tric. Whereas Psalm 111 describes primarily Yhwh’s character and power,
Psalm 112 characterizes the individual who acknowledges Yhwh in reverence
(“fear”). The “Lord-fearer” prospers (v. 3a), is altogether righteous (vv. 3b,
6a, 9b), is generous and just (vv. 5, 9a), is renowned (v. 6b; see also 111:4), has
a “ﬁrm” and “steady” heart (vv. 7b, 8a), has no fear (vv. 7a, 8b), and receives
honor (v. 9b; see also 111:3a). Like Yhwh’s character described in 111:4b, the
righteous individual is “gracious and merciful” (112:4b). Both deity and hu-
man being are deﬁned by their comparable deeds, sharing, moreover, an iden-
tity marked by righteousness, grace, mercy, renown, and power. In content,
the psalms are veritable mirror images: they proﬁle the divine—human poles
more in terms of similarity than difference. Van Leeuwen argues that the
psalms, forming a conceptual whole, impart the message, “humanity is image
and imitator of God” (imago et imitatio dei).48 Such essentialist language, how-
ever, is not part of the psalmists’ discursive repertoire. More accurate is the ob-
servation that the righteous individual comes to share in Yhwh’s nature by
virtue of his or her reverence. Crassly put, “you become what you revere” eth-
ically and, to a degree, efﬁcaciously.49 The righteous individual, in addition to
modeling and appropriating the deity’s moral attributes, accrues a certain
power. The one who reveres Yhwh is in a position to give.
In addition to the opening macarism,50 one reason why Psalm 112 is often
regarded as a “wisdom psalm” is that the central ﬁgure, the “righteous” man,
bears a family resemblance to the ﬁgure proﬁled in the concluding acrostic of
Proverbs (31:10–31), namely, the “woman of strength” (lyj tva).51 Like the
righteous man in the psalm, she is powerful (vv. 17, 25), generous to the poor
(v. 20), lacks fear (v. 21), accrues wealth (vv. 16, 18a), and holds an estimable
reputation (vv. 23, 28–31). In short, “a woman who fears Yhwh is to be
praised” (v. 30b). Nevertheless, there are other activities described in this ode
to the ideal spouse that have no parallel in the psalm: she is commercially in-
dustrious (vv. 13–16, 18–19, 24) and resourceful in providing for and manag-
ing the household (vv. 15a, 21–22). The household is of no concern to the

example, Isa 1:29–31; Jer 2:8–13; Hos 9:10b.

psalmist. The man’s source of material wealth remains unidentiﬁed; his pros-
perity is not speciﬁcally tied to industry. While the righteous man is blessed
(Ps 112:2b; see also 128:4), the woman earns her praise (Prov 31:31b). In the
psalm, the wicked—absent in Proverbs 31—“gnash their teeth and melt
away” before the integrity of the righteous (Ps 112:10). In addition, while the
woman of Proverbs “opens her mouth with wisdom, and covenantal loyalty is
on her tongue” (Prov 31:26), nothing is said about the righteous man’s dis-
course in the psalm. Whereas praise is due the woman (v. 31), it is reserved
only for Yhwh in the psalm (Ps 112:1). Whereas the woman embodies wis-
dom, the man exempliﬁes obedience to Yhwh’s “commandments.”
“Wisdom,” thus, is given greater theocentric orientation in the psalmic dyp-
tich than in Proverbs. With Ps 111:10 serving as the linchpin of both psalms,
wisdom ﬁnds its home exclusively in reverence of God. For the psalmist(s), wis-
dom is not primarily a matter of understanding; it is all about covenantal
praxis, the fruit of obedience. Wisdom is embodied in righteousness born of
trust in Yhwh (Ps 112:7b) and delight in Yhwh’s commandments (v. 1b).
Conclusion: Seeking Sophia in the Psalms
Such inductive comparisons invite more broad-based observations about
Psalms and Proverbs. Theologically, the most striking difference is the sophia-
centric focus in Proverbs 1–9. Wisdom’s personiﬁed stature in Proverbs is ut-
terly absent in the Psalms. While wisdom acts as a mediating ﬁgure of instruc-
tion for humanity in Proverbs (see, for example, 8:22–31), the psalmists
address their concerns and prayers directly to God with the expectation of a
response. The obvious genre difference between wisdom lecture and psalmic
prayer decisively shapes the theological distinctions of each corpus. In Prov-
erbs, no prayers are addressed to wisdom; indeed, there are no prayers in
Proverbs 1–9 and only one in the entire book (30:7–9).52 And yet the reader
is exhorted at one point to address wisdom directly: “Say to wisdom, ‘You are
my sister,’ and call insight your intimate friend” (Prov 7:4).53 As an agent of
instruction, wisdom, at least rhetorically, can be an object of address, but not
deﬁnitively so, as in the case of the psalmist’s deity.54
52. For a discussion of this text in the context of prayer in the wisdom literature, see
James Crenshaw, “The Restraint of Reason, the Humility of Prayer,” Urgent Advice and
Probing Questions: Collected Writings on Old Testament Wisdom (Macon, Ga.: Mercer Univer-
sity Press, 1995) 212–14.
53. This address to wisdom is enjoined here speciﬁcally in order to resist the advances
of the “strange woman” (v. 5).
54. As Crenshaw points out, the later sage Ben Sira acknowledges the formative role of
prayer and praise in learning (ibid., 217–21).

In Psalms, God is the primary agent of instruction and protection, hence
the prominent theme of refuge in the Psalter. Although Yhwh is acknowl-
edged as protector also in Proverbs (3:25–26), elsewhere “prudence” and “un-
derstanding” are named as guardians of the person’s way (2:1–12), and evil is
deﬁned more as moral corruption than as life-threatening danger.55
As a parallel to the psalmists’ “refuge,” the sages offer a comparable meta-
phor, namely, wisdom’s house, hewn and furnished by wisdom herself (Prov
9:1–2). There, a banquet is furnished for her disciples (vv. 3–6). Wisdom’s
domicile represents the new “home” for her students, co-opting as well as ex-
tending the counsel of the parental sage proﬁled earlier. Her house is a desti-
nation and source of sustenance, a sapiential counterpart to God’s “refuge” in
the Psalter. As God has “his” habitation on Zion, providing refuge for wor-
ship, so wisdom has “her” domicile, a place of instruction. Sophia’s house is
also a house of life and serves as a refuge from death and danger (see Prov
9:18). Conversely, refuge in the Psalms is occasionally construed as a place or
destination of instruction, whose source is God, the Temple’s resident theolo-
gian (Pss 31:3–4; 43:2–3).
In Proverbs, wisdom is a preeminent source of instruction. In the Psalms,
wisdom is the outcome of reverence. More pronounced as a source of instruc-
tion in the Psalms is Torah, which is occasionally invested with cosmic import
(for example, Pss 19:1–10; 119:89).56 But, unlike wisdom, whose proportions
are also cosmically informed, Torah is nowhere given personiﬁed status in the
Psalter. The metaphorical richness that viviﬁes wisdom in Proverbs is lacking
in psalmic treatments of Torah. Torah never speaks in the ﬁrst person in the
Psalter. For all the expansive reach it enjoys in the Psalms, Torah does not
compare to the lively character that wisdom embodies in Proverbs. In the
Psalms, Torah is transcendentalized but never personiﬁed, in contrast to the
proﬁles of Torah, for example, in Sirach 24 or the Midrashim.57 Why not?
55. See the related phrases “the way of evil,” “doing evil,” “delight in the perverseness
of evil,” and “crooked paths” in vv. 12–15. Danger is implied in Proverbs when “evil”
comes in the form of the seductive adulteress, whose way “leads down to death” (7:27; see
also 6:20–35).
56. See Levenson, “The Sources of Torah,” 559–74. Most recently, Stephen Geller has
argued that many of the “wisdom psalms,” such as Psalm 19, were composed as a response
from the perspective of nature-based wisdom (“Old Wisdom”) to Deuteronomic covenan-
tal theology. Such psalms represent a “New Wisdom,” a “hybrid wisdom-Torah” theology
(“Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms,” in Riches Hidden in Secret Places: An-
cient Near Eastern Studies in Memory of Thorkild Jacobsen [ed. Tzvi Abusch; Winona Lake,
Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2002] 101–21).

An obvious guess is that the psalmists placed great value on God’s unmedi-
ated agency in teaching. The language of “command” is the exclusive preroga-
tive of God. Not so in Proverbs 1–9: “commandments” are given by the
parent or by wisdom, not directly by God.58 Hence, a personiﬁcation of Torah
comparable to that of wisdom would have compromised such singular theo-
centric focus. With Torah as the direct repository of divine prescription, there
was no need for a mediating ﬁgure. Indeed, hints of a polemic against the wis-
dom of the sages can be discerned in the Psalter (see Ps 119:98–100, 102).59
Nevertheless, can one talk about a constructive relationship between wis-
dom and psalmic Torah? Indeed, yes. Particularly suggestive is the social loca-
tion that wisdom is given in Proverbs. She traverses the domains of human
intercourse that lie outside the domain of the cult: from the family to the
larger corporate, particularly urban, environment deﬁned by marketplaces,
crossroads, and city gates (Prov 1:20–21; 8:2–3). But nowhere does she gain
entrance to the Temple (contra Sir 24:8–11).60 Nowhere does she play a de-
ﬁnitive role in the history of salvation (contra Wis 10:1–21). Corporate his-
tory and cult are not her primary domains. Wisdom is a special creation of
God (Prov 8:22–31) but not God’s consort. It is in the noncultic, public do-
mains of the city square and marketplace that the sages found her to be a theo-
logical necessity. Her realm lies apart from the sanctuary of praise and petition
that the God of the psalmists inhabits. As the embodiment of “public theol-
ogy,” as it were, wisdom’s reach is beyond, as well as removed from, the ex-
plicit practice of worship.
Finally, complementarity between Proverbs and Psalms is well illustrated in
the respective goals of the two corpora. As indicated in the Hebrew title of the
Psalter, the psalms collectively point toward full praise of God. With few ex-
ceptions, even the lament psalms invariably conclude with thanksgiving or a
vow to praise. In Proverbs, however, the resounding note of divine praise is
never played. As the prologue to the book indicates, “gaining instruction” is
58. For example, Prov 2:1; 3:1; 4:4; 7:1–2; 8:10. The only reference to God’s issuing a
“command” in Proverbs is in a creation context, directed at the sea (8:29).
59. As the putative masters of wisdom, the “teachers” and elders serve as foils for the
one who obeys Yhwh’s commands. The psalmist possesses a higher order of knowledge;
Torah exceeds human insight because it remains, like the Decalogue (Exod 19:24–20:17;
see also Deut 4:5–8), unmediated teaching, wisdom direct from the divine (see also Pss
19:7; 119:24).
60. To be sure, the sage in Proverbs gives a deferential nod to the cult (Prov 3:18–10).

the overarching goal.61 Throughout the ﬁrst nine chapters of Proverbs, the
reader is repeatedly exhorted to appropriate wise counsel and discipline,62 and
such appropriation verges on the erotic,63 a rhetorical feature entirely lacking
in the Psalms. Wisdom is a lover who enables her partner to navigate the com-
plexities of life. In short, praise of God in Psalms is conjoined with assent to
wisdom in Proverbs. “Learning the ropes” of life through wisdom (Prov 1:5)
is matched by “singing to God with a new song” in praise (Ps 149:1).
Yet the peals of praise in Psalms ﬁnd some resonance in Proverbs. Like the
Psalter, Proverbs ends on a note of praise, but not praise of God:
Her children rise up and call her happy;
her husband too, and he praises her:
“Many women have done excellently,
but you surpass them all.”
Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
but a woman who fears Yhwh is to be praised.
Give her a share in the fruit of her hands,
and let her works praise her in the city gates. (Prov 31:28–31)
Praise in Proverbs is given a distinctly anthropocentric, speciﬁcally gyno-
centric, cast.64 As God is to be praised in “the assembly of the faithful” (Ps
149:1b), so also the female Lord-fearer in the household and city gate. The
accolade “happy” concludes Proverbs and, not coincidently, opens the Psalter.
Despite the theological divergences between these two complex books, in-
deed despite evidence of a polemically strained relationship, the psalmist and
the sage are canonically associated in constructive dialogue over the proper
morphology of the self. The canonical union of Proverbs and Psalms, of the
“woman of strength” and the “righteous man,” of the marketplace and the
sanctuary, of Sophia and Torah, is a match made on earth, if not in heaven.
61. For a general discussion of the pedagogical aims of Proverbs, see Daniel Estes, Hear,
My Son: Teaching and Learning in Proverbs 1–9 (New Studies in Biblical Theology; Grand
Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996) 63–87.

64. I do not take the “woman of strength” in Proverbs 31 as merely a metaphor for
mythic wisdom, although she is not unrelated to wisdom’s proﬁle in Proverbs 1–9. See

A Proverb in the Mouth of a Fool
James L. Crenshaw
Duke University
“When sight and hearing fail, the mute leads.” This variant of “Among the
blind the one-eyed is king” is embedded in the “historical romance in pseudo-
prophetic form” attributed to Neferti, an Egyptian sage from the Middle King-
dom Twelfth Dynasty (1990–1785 b.c.e.). As part of an apologetic discourse
for Amenemhet I, the text describes a period of social chaos, real or imagined,
and proleptically “predicts” the rise of a ruler who will establish order, inaugu-
rating an era of peace.1 Faintly resembling biblical prophecy and early apoca-
lyptic, it has few afﬁnities with the body of literature to which the adjective
“wisdom” has been attached by modern scholars. Nevertheless, the author uses
an aphorism to communicate a harsh reality: an absence of intellectual leader-
ship leaves a vacuum that is rapidly ﬁlled by the inept. According to the pro-
verbial saying, both organs of acuity, sight and hearing, are inoperative, while a
speechless leader usurps their place. A single statement sums up such a situation:
“All people think of themselves.” The result of numbness of observation and
listening creates a situation of total lawlessness like that described in the scan-
dalous stories at the end of the book of Judges that offer a persuasive defense of
centralized rule ( Judges 19–21; note the refrain in 19:1, “In those days, when
there was no king in Israel,” and 21:25, “In those days there was no king in Is-
rael; everyone did what was right in his own eyes”).
“Want is followed by deceit.” This proverbial saying appears in “The
Hymn to Hapy,” a hymn to the personiﬁed Nile. Also from the Middle King-
dom, the literary composition praises the inundating river for nourishing life,
and the section under consideration emphasizes the theme that bread sustains
1. The translation is from Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature (3 vols.; Berke-
ley: University of California Press, 1971–80) 1:142. The probability that the theme of na-
tional distress became a literary topos in the ancient Near East complicates every attempt to
explain texts of this sort as products of social crises.

humankind.2 The brief proverb suggests that hunger creates its own ethical
norm,3 a point also made in the prayer attributed to Agur in Prov 30:8–9,4
and perhaps in Prov 6:30, “One does not despise a thief who steals to satisfy a
hungry appetite.”5 “The Hymn to Hapy” seems to demean mercantile en-
deavors and religious rites in that the former secure no bread and the latter no
meat.6 Furthermore, it elevates bread and barley over gold, silver, and lapis la-
zuli in that the latter cannot be eaten or drunk. This early effort at prioritizing
human possessions has a parallel in Ben Sira, who reduces life’s necessities to
water, bread, clothes, and a house (Sir 29:21), or, in a less Spartan mood, wa-
ter, ﬁre, iron, salt, ﬂour, milk, honey, wine, oil, and clothes (Sir 39:26).
“Who would give water at dawn to a goose that will be slaughtered in the
morning?” This proverb, the ﬁnal sentence in “The Tale of the Shipwrecked
Sailor,” captures the trepidation of an ofﬁcial who has been sent on a mission
and failed.7 The tale reckons with the arbitrariness of human destiny, against
which excellence does not always succeed. Sometimes, it suggests, individuals
put forth Herculean effort to achieve a desired goal only to be thwarted in the
2. Ibid., 1:208. The poem goes on to say that anyone who consorts with the sea does
not harvest grain, which remotely resembles Eccl 11:1 and 4, where bread is associated with
the sea, and it is said that “whoever observes the wind will not sow, and whoever watches
the clouds will not reap.”
3. See the stimulating analysis of ethics by Miriam Lichtheim, Moral Values in Ancient
Egypt (OBO 155; Fribourg: Universitätsverlag / Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht,
1997). She identiﬁes three sources of the Egyptian’s moral code: self-esteem, the sense of in-
terconnectedness with others, and the recognition of an underlying right order, maat (p. 13).
4. In these verses, access to one’s daily bread, but nothing in excess, staves off the prof-
anation of the deity, either from dire need or from a feeling of self-sufﬁciency.
5. The author nevertheless holds the thief responsible, noting that a sevenfold repayment
will be exacted if the thief is caught. Here is an example of case law that failed to keep up
with moral sentiment (only here and in the Greek text of 2 Sam 12:6 does sevenfold pay-
ment occur). Some interpreters read Prov 6:30 as a rhetorical question, but this understand-
ing weakens the contrast in the larger unit, vv. 20–35, between prostitution and adultery,
money and life. On the text, see Michael Fox, Proverbs 1–9 (AB 18A; New York: Double-
day, 2000) 234–37. He notes a similar leniency in the Egyptian “Tale of the Eloquent Peas-
ant”: “Stealing by a thief is the misdeed of one who is needy. He should not be blamed, for
this is just a matter of seeking (necessities) for himself ” (p. 234, citing Lichtheim, Ancient
Egyptian Literature, 1:174).
6. The observation that even exuberant praise of the gods cannot bring birds to the
desert stands in stark contrast with the biblical story of divine succor in the wilderness by
means of quail.
7.  See Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, 1:215. This proverbial saying is also dis-
cussed by Antonio Loprieno, “Theodicy in Ancient Egyptian Texts,” in Theodicy in the
World of the Bible (ed. Antti Laato and Johannes de Moor; Leiden: Brill, 2003) 46–47.

end by random events. The effect of following the proverb’s implied counsel
would be catastrophic, for no one would attempt anything worthwhile lest the
effort be wasted. Another version of the saying has been widely formulated:
“Humans propose, but the gods dispose.” Whereas this version suggests that
an unpredictable transcendent factor may alter the best-laid plans, the other
contemplates a similar unknown: fate. In some religious systems, the two are
equated.
“Mouth or muscles, men are what they’re born.” This obscure saying is
from an epic poem that Benjamin Foster entitles “Tiglath-Pileser and the
Beasts,” a description of the Assyrian king’s massacre of mountain peoples.8
Depicted as a hunter stalking wild game, the king strikes terror in his prey,
which they attempt to conceal beneath braggadocio. The meaning of the say-
ing—a part of their response—is unclear, but it may intimate that education
in both senses, intellect and skill (at hunting), is innate;9 hence, it cannot be
pressed beyond prescribed limits. A modern variant would then be “An apple
does not fall far from the tree.”
“Water ﬂows under the straw.” This proverbial saying is attributed to the
god Dagan and is spoken by a prophet. The full oracle indicates the speciﬁc
use to which the proverb was put. It reads: “The peace initiatives of the king
of the city of Eshnunna are treachery, water ﬂows under the straw. But I will
capture him for the very net he meshes; I will destroy his city; and I will make
plunder of his ancient possessions.”10 In short, the deity warns against pursuing
a treaty with a sovereign who is covertly stalling and biding his time until a
propitious moment, when he will launch an attack. Contemporary parallels
easily come to mind, the most obvious being the argument by U.S. govern-
ment ofﬁcials that Saddam Hussein’s political maneuvering was a calculated
move to gain time to hide weapons of mass destruction.
“The bird takes refuge in its cage, and the cage saves its life.” This Hittite
proverbial saying from Mursili’s “Second Plague Prayer” is the ﬁrst of three
analogies in support of the king’s plea for relief from a devastating plague.11

The metaphorical language, familiar from biblical psalms, envisions the deity
as a refuge from danger.12 Just as an endangered bird ﬂees to its nest and then
rests securely, the king seeks safety in the deity’s presence. The other two
analogies emphasize the servant relationship between the king and the god.
They note that a servant in distress ﬂees to his master, who takes pity on him
and gives protection from danger; and that a servant who has committed an
offense, confessed the wrong, and made restitution has done enough to satisfy
the master, who, if not in fact satisﬁed, can then tell the servant what else is
required to set things right. The symbolism of a bird taking refuge under its
mother’s wings, which continues into New Testament times, is a domestica-
tion and democratization of the sentiment expressed by Hittite royalty.
“He has put his one foot in the boat; may he not stay the other on dry
land.” This proverbial saying, which means that there is no turning back after
a decisive step, occurs in a mythic text from ancient Sumer, “Enki and Nin-
hursaga.”13 In hot pursuit of the goddess Ninnisiga, Enki seeks encouragement
from his page Isimu: “Is this nice youngster not to be kissed?” Obligingly,
Isimu urges him on: “Is this nice youngster not to be kissed? With a (favorable)
downstream wind blowing for my master, a downstream wind blowing, he has
put his one foot in the boat; may he not stay the other on dry land!” Where-
upon, Enki makes love to Ninnisiga, and she conceives a daughter, Ninkurra.
A similar scene later unfolds, and Enki impregnates Ninkurra, who gives birth
to Nin-imma. The scene is perpetuated until Uttu, the daughter of Nin-
imma, is forewarned about Enki’s amorous ways. Uttu succumbs, nonetheless,
but the verbal chain is broken.
These seven proverbial sayings from Egypt and Mesopotamia14 adorn a va-
riety of literary types: historical romance, hymn, wondrous tale, epic, oracle,
prayer, and myth. Who would ever think of classifying such texts as wisdom
literature? Yet each of them uses a proverb to make an important point. In this

regard, the proverbs resemble biblical sayings that are interspersed within nar-
ratives and oracles.15
“We must all die. We are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be
gathered up again” (2 Sam 14:14). Reﬂections on human mortality such as this
one emphasize a return to the material from which we were created, “Dust
you are, and to dust you will return” (Gen 3:19; compare “Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,” The Book of Common Prayer). The observation that all die is
placed in the mouth of an astute woman from Tekoa, an accomplished actress
who follows a script assigned to her by David’s chief warrior, Joab. The He-
brew text leaves no doubt here; it states that Joab “put the words in her
mouth” (2 Sam 14:3b), that is, he gave her speciﬁc instructions about what she
was to say.16 Indeed, he needed a woman for his subterfuge, a widow’s appeal
to the king for redress from grievous harm implicit in the law. Playing on royal
ideology, particularly the belief that a king was the champion of widows, the
speech evoked royal pity and opened the door for its extension to the king’s
own household.
“I shall go to him, but he will not return to me” (2 Sam 12:23). This state-
ment of resignation is credited to David on learning of the death of the child
conceived in a clandestine encounter with Bathsheba. The king is represented
as truly practical, resorting at ﬁrst to religious entreaty but wasting no time
once that approach proves to be in vain. The statement’s reasoning is based on
the common belief, expressed in the Yahwist’s story of creation, that humans
are destined to return to their original source and then to exist in Sheol as pale
replicas of their earthly form.17 That journey was nothing to welcome with
open arms, unlike the later Jewish and Christian hope of joining loved ones in
another world.
“Let not the one putting on armor boast like the one taking it off ” (1 Kgs
20:11). This aphorism contrasts proven valor with untested enthusiasm, noting

mond, 1982]).
16. The operative word in the narrative is “pretend.” Similar language occurs in the
story about Jonadab, who used his intelligence to help Amnon rape his half-sister Tamar.
Curiously, no one to my knowledge has insisted that he was a professional sage. This fact
alone casts suspicion on all attempts to show that the woman of Tekoa belonged to the
µymkj ‘wise’. After all, the adjective µkj is attributed to both individuals. In the case of
Jonadab, it is even reinforced by dam ‘exceptionally’ (2 Sam 13:3).

that only an experienced warrior who has defeated the enemy and lived to tell
it really knows the outcome of a contest of arms. The untried warrior may be-
lieve that he has superior strength and skill, and like many cocky athletes, he
may talk a good game, but his inexperience may speak otherwise. In the last
resort, the bragging comes to nothing, and death ensues. The verbal contest
that precedes the armed conﬂict between the champion of the Philistines and
David illustrates the role of rhetoric in ancient warfare, especially its psycho-
logical force.18
“The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are sensitive”
(Ezek 18:2, Jer 31:29). Transgenerational punishment, a principle embedded in
the old confessional formula in Exod 34:6–7—“visiting the iniquity of fathers
upon the children and the grandchildren, to the third and fourth genera-
tion”—is harsh enough without the added freight of theological legitimation.19
The decisions in Judah during the Babylonian threat had lasting consequences,
according to the exiles who were paying the price for what their ancestors had
done. With this proverb, the descendants of the guilty ones assert their inno-
cence and protest the inequity of the situation, accusing the deity of treating
them unfairly. Beneath this simple proverb glows a tiny coal that will soon
threaten to consume faith itself. As is evidenced by the recent massive tome de-
voted to theodicy in the world of the Bible,20 that smoldering ember erupted
into a full-scale ﬁre in Second Temple times with the loss of temple, land, Da-
vidic dynasty, and religious autonomy.
Proverbial sayings of this sort, biblical and extrabiblical, could easily be
multiplied,21 but these examples sufﬁce to reveal the widely diverse contexts
18. Although several biblical narratives emphasize the important psychological inﬂuence
of rhetoric on the enemy (for example, the confrontation between David and Goliath
[1 Sam 17:43–47], the dissimulating speech of Hushai that won precious time for a ﬂeeing
David [2 Sam 17:7–13], and the mocking taunts of the Rabshakeh against Hezekiah and
the people of Jerusalem [Isa 36:4–10, 13–20 and parallels in 2 Kgs 18:19–25, 28–35; 2 Chr
32:10–15]), it is Wisdom of Solomon that ﬁrst introduces psychology as a central theme in
divine retribution.

sponses to the Problem of Evil (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005).

ignation of this sort is absent, a proverb can be recognized by other indications: its apparent
incongruity in context, a remark that people regularly say it, or its presence in a list of prov-
erbs (Hallo, “Proverbs Quoted in Epic,” 212–13).

of their use. Not one of them comes from a sapiential text, nor does any of
them constitute advice from a professional sage. The gathering evidence seems
to support the conclusions based on paremiological studies in general that cer-
tain societies used proverbial sayings for argument in circumstances as diverse
as entertainment and legal decision-making.22 I ﬁrmly believe that we need to
acknowledge as much for ancient Israel.
After all, even sages recognized that fools could cite proverbs. In Prov 26:9
we read: “Like a thorn that penetrates the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in
the mouth of fools.” An alternative translation of the ﬁrst colon may be pref-
erable: “Like a thorn taken up by a drunkard.”23 The ﬁrst rendering suggests
an individual whose oblivion to reality prevents him from recognizing the
harm he inﬂicts on himself, while the second suggests one who grabs a thorn-
bush in his drunken stupor and wields it as a weapon or in fun. This proverbial
saying resembles the one in v. 7, which has the same second colon but is in-
troduced by the words “Like a lame person’s legs that hang useless.” The pic-
ture of a person suspended between two crutches may point to the external
form of the biblical proverbs, their employment of two cola.24 It would then
mean that fools may use the correct structural device, but the content of their
proverb lacks effectiveness.
Whereas Prov 26:9 seems to refer to a comic or absurd ﬁgure, a drunk wav-
ing a thornbush in the air, Prov 9:17 indicates real and present danger, the el-
oquence of the seductive woman of folly herself: “Stolen water is sweet, and
bread eaten in secret is pleasant.” This rival to personiﬁed wisdom25 does her

modern society, summing up a distinct view of things in a brief, catchy phrase. Seldom,
however, do sound bites carry authority.

own wooing, making no use of servant maids to issue an invitation to her feast.
Her use of furtive suggestion promises more than culinary delights, and by ap-
pealing to the illicit she taps into the human desire to throw off all restraint.
That is why the warning that follows conjures up the dreaded Rephaim in the
depths of Sheol: “He does not know that the Rephaim are there, in the depths
of Sheol, her guests” (v. 18). Metaphors for adultery and erotic pleasure (see
also Prov 5:15–20) are thus matched by a literal reminder of death.
It naturally follows that biblical sages had no monopoly on such proverbial
sayings, which would have found their way into common discourse from the
very beginning. Moreover, it is probable that many, perhaps most, proverbial
sayings in the Bible arose from common experience rather than the study of
professional sages.26 The same can be said for related speech forms such as
pedagogic incentives in parental, prophetic, and priestly instruction (for ex-
ample, “listen,” “pay attention”), macarisms about receptive hearing, and ter-
minology pertaining to the intellect (for example, smart, astute, clever, stupid).
By analogy, the rhetorical devices in common use (for example, cases of poly-
genesis, especially opposites and graded numerical sayings) and existential re-
sponses to nature’s harshness and grandeur (for example, expressions of awe
and wonder, as well as musings about life’s brevity and frailty) are better at-
tributed to society in general. These features are universal, hardly limited to
an elite professional group that made up a tiny percentage of the population
in Israel. Like specialists in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian literature,
biblical scholars should make a distinction between the general use of hmkj
‘wisdom’ (and similar words for intelligence) and the technical use of such
words among sages.27 Anything short of this only brings confusion into an al-
ready complex situation.
If the assessment of the extrabiblical evidence of proverbial sayings as cre-
ations of the populace in general is correct, and if the conclusions based on this
evidence are sound, it follows that biblical interpreters may have overlooked a
natural source of many expressions that they have attributed to professional
sages. The issue is complicated by the probability that many sayings in the
book of Proverbs arose in the larger society before being assimilated into a text
that eventually became the exclusive domain of sages.
For this reason, modern biblical scholars are divided over the scope of wis-
dom inﬂuence on prophetic, historiographic, and psalmic texts. This argument

continues unabated, despite caveats about hidden assumptions and unwanted
consequences from one side28 and claims of canonical shaping from the other.29
In some ways, the most innovative insights into redactional structuring of a
text relate to the Psalter, and the persons responsible for this activity are said
to have had sapiential interests. One of the latest to make this claim is Samuel
Terrien, no novice in the long-standing debate over wisdom inﬂuence. In his
massive commentary on Psalms, Terrien frequently mentions sapiential inﬂu-
ence, sometimes qualifying the observation with a “possibly” or posing the is-
sue as a question.30 This enormously erudite scholar has capped an impressive
literary contribution with a testament to faithful reading. Its publication poses
an old question anew: Did the sages inﬂuence the Psalter? What response can
one make?
First, what indicators point to sapiential shaping of the book of Psalms?
Terrien suggests that two “sapiential meditations,” Psalms 73 and 90, form two
poles on which the rest of the book is articulated, a variant of others’ claim that
the ﬁrst of these two psalms is the book’s “theological center.” Moreover, he
appears to trace to the sages the dogma of reward and retribution, in which he
sees the risk of latent biblicism. Similarly, he views acrostic psalms—“artiﬁ-
cial” poetry devoid of artistic spontaneity—as a product of sapiential teachers,
and the “prolix and redundant” recitation of history in Psalm 78 as akin to sa-
piential instruction.
28. I have led this charge, beginning with “The Inﬂuence of the Wise upon Amos,”
ZAW 79 (1967) 42–52, which by coincidence was partly directed against Terrien’s views,
and culminating in wholesale questioning of the utility of the category “wisdom psalms”
(The Psalms: An Introduction [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001] 87–95), with a much-cited
article in between (“Method in Determining Wisdom Inﬂuence upon ‘Historical’ Litera-
ture,” JBL 88 [1969] 129–42 [= Urgent Advice and Probing Questions (Macon, Ga.: Mercer
University Press, 1995) 312–25]).
29. The design of the book of Psalms has evoked fresh approaches that rival earlier form
criticism, as recent analyses of interpretation demonstrate: above all, see my “Foreword: The
Book of Psalms and Its Interpreters,” in Sigmund Mowinckel, The Psalms in Israel’s Worship
(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2004) xix–xl; Erich Zenger, “Psalmenforschung nach Hermann
Gunkel und Sigmund Mowinckel,” in Congress Volume: Oslo, 1998 (ed. André Lemaire and

From my perspective, Terrien’s association of dogma and acrostics with
wisdom fails to do justice to their wide association with laments and prophecy,
and his reﬂections about the pedagogy of Psalm 78 do not take into account
the vast differences between this material and the use of Israelite history in Sir-
ach 40–50 and Wisdom of Solomon 10–19. The argument about the two
poles of the Psalter, while suggestive, is highly subjective. Still, some critics
ﬁnd the context of Psalm 73 too similar to the book of Job to ignore the pos-
sibility of sapiential origin, even if similar thoughts appear in prophetic texts,
especially Jeremiah and Habakkuk.
Second, Terrien thinks that the depiction of human grandeur in Psalm 8
and the comparable portrayal of divine majesty and human frailty in Psalm 90
derive from the sages, whose views were similar to those articulated in Hebraic
myths of creation. He does not identify the particular myths he has in mind,
but he does note that the myths of creation are more sapiential than cultic.
Given the prominent place of cultic worship in his interpretation of Psalms
and the book of Job, this acknowledgment of noncultic myths of creation
within wisdom literature is signiﬁcant. Scholars have often described wisdom
theology as creation theology,31 by which they mean that it embraces the hu-
man as opposed to a particular nation and that it is open to the world. Never-
theless, the myth of the ordering of society through cosmic conﬂict with chaos
is very much at home in prophecy and sacred narrative in the Torah. Terrien
does not demonstrate that speciﬁc features of sapiential reﬂection on creation
that may correspond to those in Psalms 8 and 90 do not occur in other treat-
ments of the theme.
Third, Terrien’s sense of the radiant divine presence in the theology of
Psalms leaves little space for religious doubt, despite its prominence in a few
psalms (94:7–9, 14, 53). He labels the speakers who deny divine justice rebels
or empirical atheists from the sapiential circles.32 The problem of theodicy, to
which these and similar texts attest, lays no legitimate claim on Terrien. In this
view he has modern allies, especially in the Barthian camp,33 but ancient think-
ers did not hesitate to raise the question of divine justice. Like the authors of
31. The seminal essay is that by Walther Zimmerli, “The Place and Limit of the Wis-
dom in the Framework of the Old Testament Theology,” in Studies in Ancient Israelite Wis-
dom (ed. James Crenshaw; New York: Ktav, 1976) 314–26 (“Wisdom thinks resolutely
within the framework of a theology of creation,” 316). See also Leo Perdue, Wisdom and
Creation: The Theology of Wisdom Literature (Nashville: Abingdon, 1994).

fending God, chap. 1.
33. Terrien is not alone in this aversion to theodicy. He is joined by, among others, Ter-
rence Tilley, The Evils of Theodicy (Eugene, Oreg.: Wipf & Stock, 2000). Ancient peoples

113
the psalms of lament (with the exception of Psalm 88), Terrien suppresses the
feelings of absence and anxiety while basking in the hoped-for deliverance.34
Fourth, Terrien tends to erase distinctions between wisdom and prophecy,
especially in the case of Jeremiah and the Jeremianic tradition.35 Again and
again he links a psalm with this prophet and the sages; this association is made
in Psalms 73, 88, and 119, while both Psalms 52 and 62 are said to show afﬁn-
ities with prophetic and sapiential discourse. Jeremiah’s deep probing of the
psyche is similar to that of certain psalms, particularly 39, but it also reminds
Terrien of Qoheleth’s inner questioning.36 The differences, however, between
the psalmist and Qoheleth are major, for the latter does not examine his life to
make himself more acceptable in God’s sight37 but, rather, uses autobiograph-
ical ﬁction on the one hand and internal dialogue on the other to muse about
life’s absurdity.
Fifth, Terrien builds evidence of sapiential inﬂuence on assumptions about
ancient Israelite society that need revision in light of current research, tenta-
tive as it is. At one point he suggests that nomadic terminology in Psalm 25 has
been normalized among prophets, priests, and poetic musicians. Does he im-
ply a nomadic past for the ancestors of these psalmists, as was typical of scholars
in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century? That is not clear. He does, however,
state that wisdom schools were fashionable in several cities of the Diaspora,38
a claim that rests on analogy with neighboring cultures, which has been
34. In his stimulating book The Elusive Presence: Toward a New Biblical Theology (San
Francisco: Harper & Row, 1978), the adjective “elusive” scarcely functions, so powerful is
the sense of divine presence.
35. Language of individual retribution permeated the entire social fabric of the ancient
world; it is therefore natural to expect commonalities of expression between Deuteronomy,
Jeremiah, and Psalms. This sentiment does not derive from sages.
36. “Such confessions of conﬁdential introspection belong generally to the sapiential
circles ( Job 9:27; 29:18; Eccl 2:1; but see Jer 5:40; cf. also Ps 119:8, 17, 34, 44, 55, 88, 101,
134, 146)” (Terrien, Psalms, 331).
37. The contrast between Qoheleth and the orthodox epilogist who added Eccl 12:13–
14 could hardly be greater. Qoheleth may well have counseled others to fear the deity, that
is, to tremble before divine presence, but this has little if anything to do with revering God
and keeping the commandments.

rael: Across the Deadening Silence (New York: Doubleday, 1998).
were less hesitant to raise the question of divine justice than many modern theologians. Mar-
cel Sarot addresses the modern philosophical issue of deﬁning theodicy and opts for a broad
deﬁnition similar to that of the ancients (“Theodicy and Modernity: An Inquiry into the
Historicity of Theodicy,” in Theodicy in the World of the Bible [ed. A. Laato and J. de Moor;
Leiden: Brill, 2003] 1–26).

sharply criticized.39 Terrien also writes that sapiential ethics addressed itself
chieﬂy to the socially elite, ignoring decisive indications that many of the per-
sons described in the book of Proverbs were peasants struggling to eke out an
existence from the land.40 True, Qoheleth advises the people to seize the day,
but he appears to be teaching ordinary people, µ[h. It has been argued, on
slight grounds, that the book of Job envisions two types of privileged people,
the generous and the selﬁsh,41 but this argument is difﬁcult to sustain. Sirach,
however, does ﬁt Terrien’s description of sapiential ethics, for he seems to have
belonged to a privileged class.42
Sixth, Terrien relies on style and vocabulary to link psalms and the sages,
despite the overwhelmingly negative conclusions that specialists in this en-
deavor have reached.43 All such attempts founder on the incontestable fact that
the limited vocabulary of ancient Hebrew is insufﬁcient to yield such conclu-
sions about exclusive use in certain sectors. It is highly probable that cognitive
expressions belonged to every segment of the population.
Seventh, although Eccl 11:5 acknowledges human ignorance about the
miracle of life within a fetus, it does not follow that, as Terrien suggests, Psalm
139 derives its interest in embryology from sages. In Israelite society, midwives
and pregnant women seem like the logical sources of reﬂection about the
mystery of embryology.44 In any event, the harsh remark in Ps 139:19–22 dis-
tances this psalm from the sages, with a single exception (Sir 50:25–26).

The widespread use of proverbs in literary genres distinct from wisdom lit-
erature, both within the Bible and in ancient Near Eastern texts, can be ex-
plained in one of two ways. Either the sayings are the product of sages, or they
derive from popular culture. The second of these options would render less
likely the widespread claim of sapiential inﬂuence, for example, in the book of
Psalms. The evidence is sufﬁciently ambiguous to point scholars in opposite di-
rections. Those who, like Terrien, discern the inﬂuence of sages in prophetic
books and in the Psalter may be right. In my view, however, their labeling of
words and expressions as sapiential serves no useful purpose. After all, labels
ought to clarify or to issue vital information. Perhaps it is time to move beyond
speculation to a different task, that of specifying functional similarities and dif-
ferences among genres. After all, fools had access to proverbs. It was the use of
proverbs that distinguished the fools from the wise.

Egyptian sages, however; see Papyrus Insinger 32,7–9: “He created the breath in the egg
though there is no access to it. He created birth in every womb from the semen which they
receive. He created sinews and bones out of the same semen” (Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian
Literature, 3:210).

Genericity, Tense, and Verbal Patterns in the
Sentence Literature of Proverbs
John A. Cook
University of Wisconsin
A perusal of the Hebrew text of the book of Proverbs will quickly uncover
a rich variety of verb constellations employed in its maxims. However, this
richness is generally lost on commentators and translators, who tend to render
the proverbial sayings with present-tense verb forms. This translation practice
ﬁnds support in numerous cross-linguistic examples of present-tense maxims
and linguistic treatments of the present verb form in such gnomic expressions
as a “generic (or gnomic) tense.” However, more recent linguist research has
abandon the idea of a “generic tense” as mistaken. Although there are discern-
ible cross-linguistic patterns of association between genericity and verbal se-
mantics, no particular tense, aspect, or modality (TAM) is alone sufﬁcient to
produce a characterizing (or generic) expression.
Unfortunately, this newer linguistic research has yet to be brought to bear
on the question of genericity in Biblical Hebrew.1 As a result, even the most
recent Hebrew grammars continue to employ classical terminology such as
“gnomic perfect”2 and identify present gnomic or habitual as a central area of
semantic overlap among the ﬁnite verb forms.3
A review of recent linguistic discussion of genericity suggests that the tra-
ditional approach to generic statements in the Hebrew Bible (especially the
book of Proverbs) is inadequate both linguistically and exegetically. Semanti-
cally, the treatment of all verb forms in proverbial literature as expressing
present tense begs the question why different verb forms have been employed.
1. An exception is Max Rogland’s recent work, in which he raises doubts about the tra-

Exegetically, discerning the distinct contribution each verb form makes in ge-
neric statements leads to a fuller understanding of the meaning and rhetoric of
biblical maxims.
Generic(ity) is used by linguists in reference to statements such as The whale
is a mammal, Only fools rush in, and Robert drinks coffee. More traditional labels
for statements of this sort include gnomic, general/omnitemporal/timeless
truth, proverb, and habitual.4 With respect to these and similar sentences, ge-
nericity refers to two distinct but related phenomena. The noun phrases (NPs)
the whale and fools (but not Robert) do not refer to individuals but to kinds.
Such NPs are called “kind-referring NPs” or simply “generic NPs.”5 The sec-
ond phenomenon has to do with the propositions themselves. They do not re-
fer to speciﬁc episodes or events but to general properties or characteristics.
Thus they are called “characterizing” (or simply generic) sentences in contrast
to “particular” sentences.6
Within the larger category of generic sentences, habituals are distinguished
variously by different linguists. Krifka et al. apply the label “habitual” to generic
sentences whose predicate is related to a dynamic or “episodic” predication.7
On this basis, Only fools rush in and Robert drinks coffee would be categorized
as habituals. Krifka et al. would call the third example, The whale is a mammal,
a “lexical characterizing sentence” because of its inherently stative predicate.
Characteristic of all generics is the neutralization of this dynamic: stative distinc-
tion; in other words, whether derived from a dynamic predicate (habitual) or a
stative one, all generics are stative.
By contrast, Langacker proposes a distinction between generics and habit-
uals based on whether the subject NP is kind-referring or not.8 Thus, The
whale is a mammal and Only fools rush in are generics based on the fact that both
the whale and fools are not individual NPs, but kind-referring NPs. By contrast,
the subject NP in Robert drinks coffee presumably refers to an individual named
Robert; hence it is habitual, rather than generic.
This lack of unanimity about how to distinguish habituals within the larger
category of generics is characteristic of the challenge linguists face in analyzing

or not (Ronald W. Langacker, “Generics and Habituals,” in On Conditionals Again [ed. An-

genericity. On the one hand, the way Krifka et al. explain the distinction
makes sense on a certain level: “Habitual sentences intuitively generalize over
patterns of events as a component of their meaning.”9 On the other hand, this
understanding breaks down when applied to generics such as Only fools rush in,
which is intuitively not a habitual. Although the difﬁculties in distinguishing
habituals serves to illustrate some of the characteristics of generic sentences,
they do not impinge upon the study here, which is based on the concept of
generic statements in the broader sense.
To round off this general introduction to genericity, let me note two related
distinctions that linguists make with respect to the interpretation of generic
sentences. The ﬁrst is between a universal and an existential interpretation.10
To illustrate, Jared eats oatmeal may be interpreted universally to mean that on
every occasion that Jared eats, he eats oatmeal. By contrast, an existential inter-
pretation would simply be that on occasion Jared eats oatmeal.11
The second interpretive distinction is between “descriptive” and “norma-
tive” generics (to use Dahl’s terminology).12 The former refers to probabilities
or tendencies in the actual world, whereas the latter has to do with a state of
affairs that is valid across a number of possible worlds but that may never actu-
ally be realized.13 For instance, a statement such as My friends drive Volkswagens
may be paraphrased according to either a descriptive or a normative interpreta-
tion: My friends tend to/generally drive Volkswagens (descriptive interpretation), or
I will only be friends with those who drive Volkswagens (normative interpretation).
These two distinctions are helpful for understanding generic sentences.
First, the commonplace notion that generics are statements that are univer-
sally valid is misleading, because a generic may refer to a possibility (existen-
tial interpretation) or a tendency (descriptive interpretation) rather than a
universal necessity (universal and/or normative interpretation). Second, these
related distinctions explain the law-like characteristic of generic sentences
that are interpreted as aphorisms or maxims (for example, A friend in need is a

10. John M. Lawler, “Generic to a Fault,” in Papers from the Eighth Regional Meeting, Chi-
cago Linguistic Society (Chicago: Chicago Linguistic Society, 1972) 247–58.
11. Dahl relates these categories of universal and existential to the English modal oper-
ators “necessity” and “possibility,” respectively: a universal generic is necessarily the case in
the possible situations, whereas an existential generic is possibly the case in the possible sit-
uations (Östen Dahl, “On Generics,” in Formal Semantics of Natural Language [ed. E. Kee-
nan; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975] 105).
12. Ibid., 100–102.

truth conditions of a statement are the ways in which the “world” must be in order for it
to be true.

friend indeed) or those that are employed as directives (such as There is no
smoking in here). These types of generics are interpreted as both universal and
normative. Third, Declerk suggests that semantic indeterminacy of the sort
discussed here is characteristic of generics. He claims that generic interpreta-
tions arise expressly from the fact that such statements are “unspeciﬁed for
various distinctions.”14
Despite the extent to which these distinctions help our understanding of
the nature of generic statements, there remain some questions that linguists
have been unable to answer satisfactorily. The ﬁrst of these has to do with an-
alyzing how generic sentences mean. A frequently used example to illustrate
this problem is Birds ﬂy. While most people interpret this statement as true,
most people also know that not all birds ﬂy. Similarly, the generic Mammals
bear live young is not invalidated by the fact that it does not apply to male or
immature mammals. This is in a sense the primary difﬁculty in understanding
generics. Therefore, it is important to survey some approaches to the problem,
realizing however, that there is not yet a completely satisfactory answer.
Two types of approaches to analyzing generics are the inductivist approach
and the rules-and-regulation approach.15 The inductivist approach interprets
a generic statement as true or valid if and only if there are a sufﬁcient number
of instantiations for which the predicated property holds true. So, if Colin
walks to school regularly, at some point I can validly state that Colin walks to
school as a generalization about his behavior. The greatest difﬁculty for this ap-
proach is that some generics apply even if there are no instantiations of the
predication. For example, Kathy does not take cream in her coffee may be consid-
ered valid even if she has never drunk coffee. The statement may perhaps be
deduced from the fact that she is lactose intolerant rather than from her ob-
served coffee-drinking habits.
The rules-and-regulations approach sidesteps the difﬁculty of a lack of
instantiations by interpreting generic statements as true or false based on
whether they have a corresponding structure (that is, a rule or regulation) in
the world. Carlson lists examples of generics that favor this explanation over an
inductivist one such as Bishops move diagonally and Tab A ﬁts in slot B.16 These

generics are considered valid even though there may be no instantiations of
them, because they correspond with some rule or regulation with respect to
the way the world works. Nevertheless, this approach has attracted criticism as
well, primarily for the fact that it is “ontologically more extravagant” than the
inductivist approach.17 It places the burden of validity on the existence of rules
and regulations in the world structure. This seems particularly problematic
when, as Carlson points out, generics appear to be formally based on particular
or episodic sentences that clearly refer not to rules and regulations but to indi-
viduals.18 If the nongeneric sentence Twenty birds ﬂy refers directly to individ-
ual instantiations in the world, on what basis can we argue that the generic
statement Birds ﬂy refers to some rule or regulation about bird behavior?
In any case, both these approaches have difﬁculty dealing with exceptions
to certain generic sentences such as those mentioned above (Birds ﬂy, Mammals
bear live young). In an attempt to overcome the problem of exceptions, linguists
have proposed limiting the quantiﬁcation or application of generics to “nor-
mal,” “prototypical,” “stereotypical,” or “relevant” subjects, or else constrain-
ing the situations to which they apply.19 According to Cohen’s recent
“alternative-based” theory, the truth of a generic statement must be evaluated
with respect to a set of possible alternatives. Thus, Birds ﬂy must be evaluated
with respect to a set of alternative means of locomotion { ﬂy, walk, swim}.20
Cohen calls such readings “absolute,” in contrast to “relative” readings in
which the set of alternatives is related not to the predicated property, but to
the NP. Thus, The Frenchman eats horsemeat is not evaluated on the basis of an
alternative set of foods but relatively, that is, on the basis of an alternative set
of nationalities {Frenchman, American, Russian}. In this case, the statement is
valid if the Frenchman is more likely to eat horsemeat relative to the alterna-
tive nationalities in the set.21 In either case, Cohen argues, generic statements
must be understood as probability statements;22 hence, exceptions to generics
are always possible.
The above discussion forms a relevant background to the issue of genericity
and verbal semantics because TAM distinctions may reasonably be expected to
contribute at some level to the interpretation of a generic statements. Unfor-
tunately, here we encounter a further difﬁculty in that languages rarely have

122
distinct structures to signal generic readings.23 Rather, various verbal predi-
cates may permit a generic interpretation. For example, although English ge-
nerics predominantly occur in the Simple Present, they may also be expressed
by Past or Future tense forms:24 Bill plays golf / Bill played golf (every chance he
had) / Bill will play golf (all week if he can).
Nevertheless, English sentences with Perfect and Progressive show a strong
tendency toward a particular rather than generic interpretation. However, cer-
tain adverbs serve to enforce a generic reading even with a Progressive con-
struction: Bill is usually playing golf. An explanation for this tendency toward
particular readings may be found in the aspectual value of Perfects and Pro-
gressives: both create distinct temporal bounds on a situation and hence lead
to a particular reading. By contrast, the simple tense forms in English allow for
an unbounded characteristic reading.25
Despite the fact that most languages, like English, have no distinctively “ge-
neric tense,” a pattern can be discerned cross-linguistically with respect to
which TAM values are most commonly associated with genericity. Dahl makes
two main observations about generics and TAM marking based on his exten-
sive cross-linguistic database.26 First, there is a “minimal marking tendency”
among generic statements cross-linguistically. In other words, languages tend
to employ the less-marked verb form in generics, such as the English Simple
Present versus the Progressive Present: Bill drinks versus Bill is drinking.27
Second, Dahl ﬁnds three exceptions to the minimal-marking tendency
among languages. One is that imperfective verbs, which might not be the least-
marked forms, predominate in generic sentences in some languages. A second,
related exception is that “receding non-progressives” (that is, forms that have
developed beyond a progressive meaning on the universal grammaticalization
path of progressive § present / imperfective) are predominantly used in ge-
neric expressions in many languages. For instance, Dahl cites the example of
Tamil, in which the verb form labeled “Future” commonly appears in generic
sentences.28 He hypothesizes that this form was earlier a general non-past
23. Krifka et al. cite an example from Swahili in which the verbal preﬁx hu- marks ha-
bitual genericity, but they also note that markings of this sort are only a sufﬁcient and not a
necessary marker of genericity (“Genericity,” 8).

speciﬁc verbal forms.

(present / imperfective) form that has been superseded in this role by the de-
velopment of a progressive form now labeled “Present.” Finally, a few lan-
guages actually employ an overt generic marker, as in Cebuno where the
progressive ga-suwat ‘he is writing’ is distinct from the generic mu-suwat ‘he
(usually) writes’ through a “real durative” marking on the former (the preﬁx
ga-) and an “unreal” marking on the latter (the preﬁx mu-).29
Let me summarize the main conclusions from this discussion of generic
statements before moving on to a discussion of the statements in Proverbs.
First, generics are characterizing probability statements. That is, they do not
refer to particular episodes or events but characterize properties of certain
states of affairs, and as probability statements their characterizations are not
without exceptions. Second, generic statements are unspeciﬁed with respect
to several distinctions, so they may be interpreted in a number of ways de-
pending on their pragmatic context. Third, although most languages have no
particular marking of generic sentences and no speciﬁcally “generic tense,”
there are some discernable cross-linguistic patterns with respect to TAM and
generics. Among these are (1) a “minimal-marking tendency,” meaning that
languages tend to use the less-marked or unmarked verb forms in generic
statements, and (2) a preference for progressive § present / imperfective verb
forms in generic statements.
The book of Proverbs offers an extensive collection of generic statements
containing a variety of verb forms. However, not all of the material in Prov-
erbs qualiﬁes as generic. In particular, it has been customary among biblical
scholars to distinguish between two main literary types in the book: instruc-
tional material and sentence literature. Although the instructional material is
interspersed with some generic sentences, it is dominated by directive (com-
mand) statements with modal verb forms (mostly imperatives and negated
jussives). The collections in chaps. 1–9 as well as the “Words of the Wise”
(22:17–24:35), and the “Words of Lemuel” (31:1–9) are usually characterized
as instructional material.30 By contrast, the sentence literature, predominantly
found in the two “Solomonic” collections (10:1–22:16 and 25:1–29:27), con-
sists mostly of generic sentences interspersed with some directive statements.
Thus I have made these two “Solomonic” collections the basis of my investi-
gation.31 I have tabulated the proverbs from these two collections in table 1,
according to which verb form constitutes the main predication in the ﬁrst line
(vertical axis) and second line (horizontal axis). Examples in which the verb is

gapped in the second line are tabulated in the “gapped” column; those with
only one main predication are listed as having “nothing” in the second line.
Let me begin my analysis by noting that the data are in keeping with Dahl’s
cross-linguistic observations. The most frequently employed verb forms are
associated with the progressive § present / imperfective grammaticalization
path, namely, the participle and yiqtol. Although the progressive participle is
beginning to encroach upon imperfective yiqtol in the sphere of the present,
yiqtol appears more frequently in the generic statements of Proverbs than the
participle. Between these two forms, in terms of frequency, are verbless pred-
ications, which illustrate the “minimally marked tendency” of generics dis-
cussed above. Together, minimally marked verbless predications, progressive
participles, or imperfective yiqtols occur in some combination to the exclusion
of any other verb forms in over 80 percent of the examples in the data.
Although one may protest (as Rogland has done with regard to qatal)32
that TAM distinctions are preserved even in generic statements, how can such
protestations be substantiated? I think an answer lies in the analogy between
generics and direct speech. In both the generic statements in Proverbs and di-
rect speech in Biblical Hebrew narrative, the TAM value of the verb form is
uninﬂuenced by the surrounding context—both are “deictically” indepen-

dent of the surrounding discourse.33 As a result, discourse-determined TAM
values, such as past perfect for qatal (for example, Gen 5:24) and future in the
past (the equivalent of English Past Conditional) for yiqtol (for example, Gen
43:25), are rare in short stretches of direct speech and are likewise expected
to be rare in the short generic statements in Proverbs. This correlation would
conform to the “minimal-marking tendency” observed in generic statements
cross-linguistically.
Within direct speech, just one or two TAM values are consistently associ-
ated with each ﬁnite verb form: (1) qatal expresses past tense (perfective aspect),
or perfect aspect; (2) yiqtol expresses present (imperfective aspect) or future
tense; (3) the participle expresses (present) progressive aspect; and (4) the nar-
rative verb wayyiqtol is rare in direct speech, as it also is in generic statements
(see table 1). These “default” TAM values, which are illustrated by the ex-
amples in (1), provide a baseline or a starting point for analyzing the TAM val-
ues in generic statements.34
The validity of the above analogy between generics and direct speech seems
evident in the fact that these “default” TAM values can account for the re-
spective verb forms throughout the generic statements in Proverbs. However,
this is only a starting point. It remains to explain the signiﬁcance of the various
verb choices in Proverbs. Although not every example can be analyzed in this
space, and semantics alone cannot account for every verb choice, some distinct
differences can be seen among the major predicate patterns in the data.

tion of Speech in Biblical Hebrew Narrative: A Linguistic Analysis (HSM 55; 2nd printing; Wi-
nona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2003) 74. With respect to the generic sentences in Proverbs,
Declerck’s characterization of generics as “underspeciﬁed” may perhaps be applied to the
issue of context as well (Declerck, “Generic Sentences,” 151).

Verbless predications are the most basic (“minimally marked”) type of pred-
ication and are analyzed as present tense or “tenseless.”35 The types of prover-
bial statements that utilize verbless predication are, not surprisingly, quite varied
but fall into two broad categories: those that express identity between two en-
tities (nouns or noun phrases), often in the sense of providing a deﬁnition, as
illustrated by (2a–b); and those that make a descriptive statement using a predi-
cate adjective or some other predicate than a noun, as illustrated by (2c–d).
The progressive participle occurs third-most frequently in the data. As in
other languages (for example, Swedish), the Hebrew participle may express ei-
ther a general present or present progressive predication. However, because of
the bounded, particular reading (versus unbounded, generic) associated with
35. Two explanations have been offered for verbless predications in Hebrew and other
languages. The ﬁrst is that the copula verb is absent, and the predicate is unmarked for
TAM; in this case, the copula when present is analyzed as a “dummy” verb necessary only
for the placement of TAM marking (see John Lyons, Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics
[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968] 323; for criticism of this view, see Leon
Stassen, Intransitive Predication [Oxford Studies in Typology and Linguistic Theory; Oxford:
Clarendon, 1997] 65–76). The second explanation posits that in verbless predications a
copula is syntactically present but only phonologically null; the lack of a “present” copula
form in Hebrew merely makes the language “defective morphologically” according to
Shlonsky, a proponent of this view (Ur Shlonsky, Clause Structure and Word Order in Hebrew
and Arabic: An Essay in Comparative Semitic Syntax [Oxford Studies in Comparative Syntax;
Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997] 39. For a treatment of verbless clauses in Biblical
Hebrew see Cynthia L. Miller (ed.), The Verbless Clause in Biblical Hebrew: Linguistic Ap-
proaches (LSAWS 1; Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1999).

progressives, the participle in generic statements is best understood as a general
present. In contrast to verbless predications that equate or describe states of af-
fairs, participial generics present actions that are typical or characteristic, as il-
lustrated in (3).
Yiqtol is the most common verb in the data; it is also the most varied se-
mantically. Three distinct nuances may be expressed by yiqtol. The first of
these is a general generic statement to which an adverb like “typically” or
“usually” may be added without changing the meaning, as illustrated by the
English aphorisms Boys will (typically) be boys, and Birds of a feather (typically)
flock together. In such examples the TAM value of yiqtol may be interpreted as
general (imperfective) present tense or future tense; I have chosen to translate
all the examples in (4) with English Future tense forms.36

The second category of examples demands a future-tense interpretation of
yiqtol. Rather than expressing typical states of affairs, these proverbs feature in-
evitable states of affairs, similar to English maxims such as What will be will be
and Accidents will happen. Such examples, illustrated in (5), are distinct from the
ﬁrst category in that they allow adverbs such as “inevitably,” “eventually,” or
“ultimately” to be added to them without a change in meaning, whereas they
yield a quite different sense with the adverbs “typically” or “usually.”37
Deciding to which of these ﬁrst two categories an example belongs is an issue
of interpretation. Although some statements, such as (5a) above, quite clearly
demand an inevitable interpretation, others, such as (5b) might be interpreted
as either typical or inevitable. It is an interesting question to what degree the
choice between these interpretations is dependent on the view of reward and
punishment in the book of Proverbs.
The third category consists of examples in which yiqtol has some variety of
modal meaning.38 There is only one case of yiqtol with a clear directive (com-
mand) modal meaning, given in (6a); but several examples in the data seem

The use of perfective qatal and past wayyiqtol forms in Proverbs is less fre-
quent and is of particular interest because these forms are less expected in light
of the dominance of progressive § present / imperfective forms in generic
statements cross-linguistically. Most often translations and commentaries fol-
low the traditional approach of identifying such occurrences as “gnomic per-
fects” (and by analogy applying it to wayyiqtol as well) and translating them as
present tense.43 However, this treatment is not self-evidently correct because
in many instances the usual translation of the verb is perfectly acceptable, as
illustrated by (9).44
In addition, there are enough examples of past and perfective verb forms in
generic statements from the world’s languages to raise doubts with respect to
this analysis of qatal and wayyiqtol in Proverbs.45
Beyond this negative assessment of the traditional understanding, I believe
a positive explanation for the use of qatal and wayyiqtol in Proverbs is possible
through understanding examples such as the one in (9) to be anecdotal.46
Anecdotes are closely related to moral generic statements, as explained by
Frykenberg:
A maxim states some general principle which serves as a guide or rule. An anec-
dote narrates facts and circumstances, giving details in sequence. An anecdote,
43. Although Driver does not employ the term “gnomic,” he cites examples of qatal ex-
pressing general truths, about which he states that “the idiomatic rendering in English is by
means of the present” (S. R. Driver, A Treatise on the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew and Some
Other Syntactical Questions [3rd ed.; London: Oxford University Press, 1892; repr. with an
introductory essay by W. Randall Garr, Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans / Livonia, Mich.:
Dove, 1998] 17).

strong men,

44. Thus, Murphy (Proverbs, 157), the reb, and the nab translate this verse with English
Present tense verbs, whereas Scott (R. B. Y. Scott, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes [AB 18; Garden City,
N.Y.: Doubleday, 1965] 124), the nrsv, and the njps use Past tense verb forms.

as purpose, result, and conditional/temporal clauses (see my Biblical Hebrew Verbal System,

even if and when it points to some conclusion or some general observation, will
not do so explicitly. . . . It is the audience (or reader) who draws the inferences
and connects the particular to the general. In any case, whether anecdote or
maxim, the form of one is the other form inside out, back-to-front, or upside
down: one gives a general conclusion or theory without supplying evidence; and
the other does just the reverse, narrating details and providing evidence without
drawing general conclusions or principles. The empirical and the theoretical, by
nature, work in opposite ways.47
An example such as the one above in (9) should be translated in its most
straightforward manner—as a past tense anecdote whose moral message is left
for the reader to discern: “A wise man went up (against) a city of strong men,
and brought down its strong fortiﬁcation.”
This anecdotal explanation does not hold for all the examples, however. In
particular, some examples have a stative predicate and thus are properly ren-
dered as presents, as in (10a).48 Others should be understood as expressing
some variety of perfect aspect based on the context, which signiﬁes that some
present state of affairs holds true based on some previous event, as illustrated
by (10b).49 Finally, I identify some examples as instances of modal qatal in
proverbs.50 These examples may have a generic habitual sense, as illustrated in
(10c); the habitual sense is found frequently in prose narrative (for example,
Gen 29:3).51 In other examples the form appears in some type of contingent
modal clause, such as a purpose, conditional, or temporal clause.52 This is il-
lustrated by the examples in (10d–e).53

Something further may be said with regard to wayyiqtol. First, the number
of examples is extremely small: only seven verses have wayyiqtol as the main
predicate, in addition to one verse where it occurs following a leading qatal.55
Second, although most of these examples are plainly past tense, there remain
some problematic examples, such as those following a verbless clause in (11).
Intriguingly, examples of qatal following a verbless clause are likewise some-
times awkward whether translated with a past or perfect, as illustrated in (12).

56
These puzzlements admitted, the past-tense reading (or perhaps a modal read-
ing for qatal) is not completely ruled out for these examples, and thus they do
not detract from the overall observation that TAM distinctions do exist in
Proverbs.
Despite the voluminous research on the Hebrew verb, the role of the verb
forms in generic statements in the book of Proverbs have largely been left un-
addressed. This is unfortunate for two reasons. First, since most models of the
Hebrew verb recognize that all the ﬁnite indicative forms appear with varying
frequencies in generic sentences, determining the semantic distinctiveness of
each of these forms in such sentences contributes to our understanding of the
Hebrew verbal system overall. In particular, what this study has shown is that
the TAM values for the ﬁnite verb forms in generic sentences are consistent
with the values these forms have in direct speech. The degree of overlap
among these forms in the present sphere may not be as great as is sometimes
portrayed.
Second, the distinction among the verb forms in generic statements has in-
terpretive import. The examination of genericity in this study, as tentative as
it is, provides a basis for investigating the interpretive signiﬁcance of different
verb forms in generic statements. In particular, the participle usually expresses
typical actions that are indicative of particular characters. Generics with yiqtol
may be interpreted as either an expression of “typical” truths or future “inev-
itable” truths, in addition to the various modal nuances yiqtol may have. Fi-
nally, qatal along with the few examples of wayyiqtol in Proverbs may portray
past tense anecdotes from which the reader is left to extract a general maxim.

Word Order in the Book of Proverbs
Robert D. Holmstedt
University of Toronto
I. Introduction
There are innumerable studies of Biblical Hebrew (BH) proverbs—as a
genre, as a book, as individual units—and almost as many studies of BH word
order. Oddly, few works have broached the subject of the word order of BH
proverbs. Perhaps it is due to the poetic, nonnarrative nature of proverbs; it is
possible, if not likely, that the lack of lengthy stretches of discourse combined
with the perceived syntactic “chaos” of BH poetry has motivated grammarians
to look for greener, more easily accessible pastures elsewhere.
My biblical wisdom teacher, however, declined to graze elsewhere, and
both his tenacity and refusal to be intimidated by the obscurities and complex-
ities of BH wisdom texts have produced a scholar, who, to modify a biblical
line, µtdyjw µymkj yrbd hxylmw lvm ˆybm awh. It is in his honor, and in the
spirit of stubbornly working a knot until it is undone, that this study is offered.
Word order in the book of Proverbs is indeed a knotty grammatical issue.
In this initial foray into this complex issue, I will proceed by examining the
discourse features of BH proverbs, the typological study of word order, and
the syntactic and pragmatic features that determine the word order of BH
proverbs, focusing on the relative placement of subjects and verbs.
II. The Discourse Feature of Biblical Hebrew Proverbs
There is a tendency within the study of BH word order, particularly among
those working within a typological-functional approach, to distinguish among
various discourse types and/or genres.1 Thus, the natural unmarked constitu-
ent order in BH narrative prose is believed to differ from that of the poetry in
Psalms or the poetic prose within the prophets or, for example, Genesis 1, as
1. See, for example, P. J. MacDonald, “Discourse Analysis and Biblical Interpretation,”
in Linguistics and Biblical Hebrew (ed. W. R. Bodine; Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1992)
153–76; N. A. Bailey and S. H. Levinsohn, “The Function of Preverbal Elements in Inde-
pendent Clauses in the Hebrew Narrative of Genesis,” Journal of Translation and Textlinguistics
5/3 (1992) 179–207; R. E. Longacre, The Grammar of Discourse (New York: Plenum, 1996).

well as—to cut along a different axis—from reported speech/dialogue.2 BH
proverbs, which clearly ﬁt into the category of poetry, present us with a rich
and largely unstudied body of linguistic data. The results of a word order study
of BH proverbs have the potential not only to enhance our abilities to inter-
pret the book of Proverbs but also to contribute to our understanding of BH
grammar in general.3
Perhaps there is still a lingering objection to my use of Proverbs: How
could a poetic corpus be an appropriate corpus for investigating the basic word
order of BH? It is because the crucial issue for word order study is not the
prose-versus-poetry distinction—both prose and poetry exhibit a variety of
stylistic and pragmatic features; that is, they both have conventions that any
adequate word order study must analyze. Choosing one over the other, as long
as the nature of the text is recognized and the salient features are analyzed,
provides no advantage either way. Rather, the linguistic distinction that is im-
portant is between narrative (often monologic in nature) and nonnarrative (of-
ten dialogic in nature).
Typologists engaged in identifying basic word order for any given language
have for quite some time debated about whether monologue or dialogue is
more likely to provide basic word order examples. For many years narrative/
monologue material was preferred: according to Robert Longacre, “If story-
line clauses in narrative discourse in a given language are VSO, then that lan-
guage should be classiﬁed as a VSO language.”4 Longacre bases this claim on
several assumptions, the ﬁrst of which is that “monologue discourse is a better
2. See, for example, J. MacDonald, “Some Distinctive Characteristics of Israelite Spo-
ken Hebrew,” BO 23 (1975) 162–75.
3. A signiﬁcant question that is often overlooked in BH word order studies concerns the
use of genre distinctions for the study of BH grammar. I suggest that pressing distinctions
among a number of genres too far renders the study of anything called “BH syntax” impo-
tent. Indeed, a valid objection to maintaining any sort of strict discourse boundaries is that,
for the purposes of BH syntax, discourse distinctions between, for example, prose and po-
etry are facile: either there is a “syntax” of BH or not. If there is, then the syntactic patterns
of BH proverbs belong to that grammar, and while they may exhibit greater variety than
nonproverbial material or nonpoetic material in general, their basic syntactic features should
be in accordance with those of any other discourse type. Therefore, in some sense this essay
does not aim to sketch simply “the grammar of BH proverbs” or even “the grammar of the
book of Proverbs” (as if either would somehow constitute a distinct “grammar”) but aims
to contribute to the larger determination of the basic patterns of constituent order in BH
grammar as a whole.

guide to language typology than dialogue . . . in that the exigencies of repartee
presumably make for departures from standard word order at many places.”5
However, an increasing number of typologists and discourse analysts are
arguing that the opposite of Longacre’s position is preferred, that reported-
speech/dialogue texts are less idiosyncratic and thus should be used to deter-
mine basic word order.6 In fact, it has been suggested that features associated
with temporal succession in narrative result in narrative/monologic texts,
rather than reported-speech/dialogic texts, exhibiting greater departures from
standard word order.7
With proverbs, we have perhaps the best genre in the Hebrew Bible for iso-
lating basic word order; it is, at least, of equal value to the long narratives most
often studied (e.g., Genesis). How so? BH proverbs present us with nonnarra-
tive discourse, thus this discourse type avoids the problems associated with
temporal succession in narrative (e.g., foreground vs. background narrative and
any correlation that this distinction has with word order). BH proverbs also
straddle the fence in terms of the dialogue-versus-monologue distinction: they
are cast as a dialogue between father and son, but the son is silent; thus, the
intentionally unidirectional nature of the speech suggests that features of mono-
logue exist. Certainly, it is apparent that Longacre’s concerns about the “exi-
gencies of repartee” do not apply to BH proverbs.
Additionally, most of the line pairs in the book of Proverbs are not “bound”
within the discourse; that is, individual proverbs, or occasionally small groups
of proverbs, constitute a self-contained world of discourse and are thus not in-
ﬂuenced by discourse factors beyond the syntactic boundaries of the proverb
or proverb group.8 Thus, with the data in the book of Proverbs we have few
of the long, pragmatically complex stretches of discourse found in narrative.
Finally, studying BH proverbs allows us to deal with a corpus that is rela-
tively free from the skewing presence of the narrative-past verb wayyiqtol. This
verb form greatly complicates the study of word order whenever it is present.
Indeed, its dominance in BH narrative has misled most word order studies
5. Ibid., 333. Longacre also comments that, although BH narrative is primarily VS, “in
expository discourse . . . SVO [i.e., subject-verb-object] predominates and is on the main-
line” (The Grammar of Discourse, 23).

with regard to the essential syntax of the BH clause. It is self-evident that a
verb form that requires a clause-initial position (i.e., one cannot have a pre-
verbal constituent with the wayyiqtol) in a language that otherwise exhibits
nearly free word order should be analyzed separately and that other clause
types should be used to study basic word order.
Now that I have provided a brief justiﬁcation for using BH proverbs to
study BH word order, I will alert the reader to my methodological stance be-
fore proceeding to the data. Perhaps the approach taken in this essay could
best be labeled “generative-typological.” In other words, there is a strong ty-
pological element to the following analysis of the BH data, but it is predicated
on generative principles.9 To some, these two linguistic approaches may seem
to be strange bedfellows, but in fact they are not theoretically irreconcilable.10
III. The (Generative-)Typological Study of Word Order
What is the typological study of word order? It is most often traced back to
Joseph Greenberg’s seminal 1963 article, “Some Universals of Grammar with
Particular Reference to the Order of Meaningful Elements.”11 This essay set
in motion a rich comparative linguistic method with the goal of discerning
morphological and syntactic “universals”12 within the incredible diversity of
human languages. The ﬁrst section in Greenberg’s essay, focusing on “certain

of Technology Press, 1995); idem, “Minimalist Inquiries: The Framework,” in Is the Best
Good Enough? Optimality and Competition in Syntax (MIT Working Papers in Linguistics 15;
Cambridge: MIT Press, 1998); idem, “Derivation by Phase,” in Papers from the Workshop on
Structure and Constituency in Native American Languages (MIT Occasional Papers in Linguis-
tics; Cambridge: MIT Press, 1999). For somewhat more readable expositions of the recent
generative model, see A. Radford, Syntactic Theory and the Structure of English: A Minimalist
Approach (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1997); J. Ouhalla, Introducing Transformational Grammar: From Principles and Parameters to Min-
imalism (2nd ed.; London: Arnold, 1999).

12. The quotation marks around the word “universal” simply serve to distinguish the
typological notion of language universals (which are rarely in fact “universal”—that is,
without exception) and the Chomskyan generative concept of universals (which are, as
“principles of Universal Grammar,” taken to be without exception and part of the language
faculty that is a genetic feature unique to humans).

basic factors of word order,” is perhaps the most signiﬁcant for our discussion.
In order to identify the basic word order of any given language, Greenberg
proposed using three criteria:13
(1) the use of prepositions versus postpositions;
(2) the relative order of subject, verb, and object in declarative sentences
with nominal subject and object;
(3) the position of qualifying adjectives, either preceding or following the
modiﬁed noun.
Although these three criteria have been modiﬁed as the typological program
has matured, they still reﬂect the fundamental questions involved in determin-
ing how a language patterns: do heads (i.e., the constituent being modiﬁed)
precede or follow their modiﬁers?
Typologists have reﬁned the procedure considerably, and many have re-
duced the basic classiﬁcation of languages to the VO-versus-OV and SV-
versus-VS distinctions.14 Generativists (and many other formalists) typically re-
cast syntactic description such as this by using the the terms “complement” and
“adjunct.”15 Complements are constituents that complete the head and are
thus obligatory for forming a larger grammatical item. For instance, transitive
verbs require complements, often in the form of direct objects but sometimes
also in the form of prepositional phrases, and so forth. Adjuncts, in contrast, are
nonobligatory modiﬁers, such as adjective, adverbs, and noncomplement prep-
ositional phrases. Finally, the category of “speciﬁer” includes subjects, articles,
demonstratives, possessives, and subordinators. Using these three syntactic cate-
gories, the basic oppositions for a typological study are “head-complement
versus complement-head,” “head-adjunct versus adjunct-head,” and “head-
speciﬁer versus speciﬁer-head.”
13. Ibid., 76. It should be noted, with regard to the nature of Greenberg’s “universals,”
that Greenberg himself lists exceptions in his footnotes. In defense of this “loose” approach
to language universals (which some now call “tendencies” rather than “universals”), Tho-
mas Payne suggests that “[l]anguages which deviate from Greenberg’s ideal types do not
‘violate’ Greenberg’s universals. They are simply inconsistent with the ideal type. Since the
majority of languages of the world are inconsistent, it may be more appropriate to dub per-
fectly consistent language as a violation of expectations!” (T. E. Payne, Describing Morpho-
syntax: A Guide for Field Linguists [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997] 90–91).

Our typological goal is thus to determine whether and how a language ex-
hibits strong tendencies one way or the other for each grammatical category,
such as nouns and verbs, and each syntactic relationship, such as complemen-
tation and adjunction. The table in example (4) illustrates the way we might
sketch a simple typological analysis for English, asking the “head-initial” or
“head-ﬁnal” question for each syntactic category.
The English examples in the table illustrate the facts that English is strictly
head-initial for the order of head and complement, strictly head-ﬁnal for the
order of head and speciﬁer, and both head-initial and head-ﬁnal for the order
of head and adjunct, with greater weight given to the head-ﬁnal examples be-
cause they occur in less-restricted environments (see below, examples [14] and
[15] and the discussion there). So English exhibits no one order for all “gram-
matical” categories but is fairly consistent within each “syntactic” category; in
this way, English is a fairly typical SVO language.
When we investigate BH complements and adjuncts, we ﬁnd that it is a
strongly head-initial language, illustrated by the examples in (5–9).

When we turn to the issue of speciﬁers, we arrive at the knotty issue. First,
the evidence of nouns and speciﬁers is ambiguous, as the examples in (10)
illustrate.
While articles precede nouns (that is, they exhibit head-ﬁnal order), demon-
strative and possessive pronouns follow nouns (that is, they exhibit head-initial
order). Unfortunately, the evidence of verbal speciﬁers (subjects) further com-
plicates the determination of basic order for this syntactic category. To put
a point to the question for the book of Proverbs: Does the SV/head-ﬁnal
example in (11) or the VS/head-initial example in (12) represent the basic
order? (Remember, the verb is the head.)16

16. The overwhelming majority opinion is that VS is basic in BH; most of the analyses
have focused on narrative. For representative recent studies, see T. Goldfajn, Word Order and
Time in Biblical Hebrew Narrative (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998); J.-M. Hei-
merdinger, Topic, Focus and Foreground in Ancient Hebrew Narratives (Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Aca-
demic Press, 1999); C. H. J. Van der Merwe, “Towards a Better Understanding of Biblical

lical Hebrew: A Statistical Analysis (Ph.D. diss., Yeshiva University, 2000); K. Shimasaki, Focus

CDL, 2002). Representative of the majority opinion applied to the syntax of BH proverbs,
Murray Salisbury assumes VS basic order (“Hebrew Proverbs and How to Translate Them,”
446). For rare dissenting voices to the VS analysis, see P. Joüon, Grammaire de l’Hebreu bi-
blique (Rome: Pontiﬁcal Biblical Institute, 1923); V. DeCaen, On the Placement and Interpre-
tation of the Verb in Standard Biblical Hebrew Prose (Ph.D. diss., University of Toronto, 1995);

Not surprisingly, when this issue is analyzed from a generative perspective, the
options—as well as the starting point—change considerably. To simplify for the
sake of space, current generative analysis has determined that initial derivations
(perhaps we could call these “clauses-in-the-making”) start with the subject
preceding the verb. Since within the generative approach many constituents in
the clause (it depends on the language) “move” from this starting position to
higher positions in the clause (that is, toward the front of the clause), it is pos-
sible for this derivation to result in a clause with VS or SV order (hence, the
older distinction between “deep” structure and “surface” structure17).
Furthermore, the structural position of subject constituents is quite unlike
that of complements and adjuncts. Whereas complements and adjuncts (again,
depending on the language) may occupy positions on either side of the verb
(that is, VO vs. OV and V-Adv vs. Adv-V, etc.), subjects are thought to occupy
a unique position called the “speciﬁer” (abbreviated as “Spec”) that is only to
one side—to the left side, or “higher”—of its phrasal head. In informal terms,
the speciﬁer position is occupied by constituents that “specify” salient features
of the main constituent; so, for example, subjects specify the agent/theme/
patient of verb phrases, articles specify the deﬁniteness of noun phrases, and
complementizers (e.g., English “that”) specify the ﬁniteness and illocutionary
force of the complementizer phrase (i.e., clause).18
Recast in this paradigm, the issue for BH becomes whether the verb “raises”
over the subject, producing VS order, or whether the verb remains lower than
the subject, producing SV order. And, as we shall see, there are further com-
plicating factors: additional movement of constituents (e.g., the verb moving
even higher than normal) can be “triggered”19 by the presence of other con-
stituents, such as clause-initial grammatical items like relative words.20
Thus, the typological study of basic word order, when performed within
the paradigm of generative linguistics, becomes at once more complex and
17. On the conceptual changes brought about by the Minimalist Program, with particu-
lar reference to “deep structure” and “surface structure” as components of the model, see

more powerful. A typologically minded generativist recognizes the value of
cross-linguistic analysis, the nuanced discussion of which clause type best ap-
proximates the basic clause type, the identiﬁcation of a variety of discourse
types, and the typological obsession with compiling vast sets of data. However,
the generative approach qualiﬁes what it views as the naïve acceptance of the
ﬁnal or “surface” product as the sole object of syntactic study;21 in other
words, the basic distinction between “deep” structure and “surface” structure
allows a generativist to identify relevant features in a way that a nongenerativist
cannot.22
At this point, I have introduced the basics of the typological study of word
order, described many of the features of BH harmonics, excluding the subject
and verb issue, and set this typological study within the broader generative
theoretical program. I have yet to identify whether BH proverbs suggest that
BH is VS or SV. This is not an easy task, and we must use a few established
criteria in order to analyze the data. The four most commonly used criteria for
this task are listed in (13).23
21. Although Chomsky’s earliest comments on the value of “statistical studies” are
somewhat dismissive in tone (and he took a slightly more positive approach toward typol-
ogy within the Principle and Parameters approach in the mid-1980s), the basic critique of
Greenberg’s initial study has not changed: “Insofar as attention is restricted to surface struc-
tures, the most that can be expected is the discovery of statistical tendencies, such as those
presented in Greenberg 1963” (N. Chomsky, Aspects of a Theory of Syntax [Cambridge:
MIT Press, 1965] 118). Frederick Newmeyer has recently proposed a method by which
generativists can make use of typology (see above, n. 8), he made the following skeptical
observation in an earlier work:
[T]here is no evidence that “the collection of valuable facts” has ever led or could lead to
the discovery of any generalizations other than the most superﬁcial sort. For example, the
seven-year-long Stanford University Language Universals Project (whose results are now
published as Greenber, Ferguson and Moravcsik 1978) carried out Li’s program to per-
fection yet has not led, as far as I know, to any substantial theoretical revisions. The prob-
lem is that the fairly shallow generalizations and statistical correlations described in the
project’s reports were far too sketchily presented to be of much use in ascertaining even
the grammatical structure of the individual languages treated, much less shed any light on
universal grammar. (F. Newmeyer, Grammatical Theory: Its Limits and Its Possibilities [Chi-
cago: University of Chicago Press, 1983] 71)

IIIa. Clause Type
The criterion of clause type builds upon Greenberg’s initial approach;
however, typologists have since reﬁned the deﬁnition of the appropriate basic
clause considerably. An example is Anna Siewierska’s, in which she deﬁnes the
basic clause as: “stylistically neutral, independent, indicative clauses with full
noun phrase (NP) participants, where the subject is deﬁnite, agentive and hu-
man, the object is a deﬁnite semantic patient, and the verb represents an ac-
tion, not a state or an event.”24
Admittedly, clauses of this sort may not occur in abundance in a typical text
or discourse due to the nature of human communication.25 For example, in
languages that allow subject pronouns to be omitted (that is, “pro-drop” lan-
guages, such as Spanish, Italian, and Hebrew), clauses with “full noun phrase”
subjects will be difﬁcult to isolate. The fact that “basic clauses” may not be fre-
quent does not invalidate the search for basic word order, however; rather, this
simply illustrates the complexities of typical human discourse.26
IIIb. Frequency
Those who assign primacy, or at least signiﬁcance, to statistics use the fre-
quency criterion. Whereas a “basic clause type” may be in the statistical mi-
nority—here of course is the potential rub—the frequency approach demands
that the basic order designation be assigned to a statistically dominant pattern.27
It is interesting to note that the frequency criterion is used by Takamitsu Mu-
raoka in his study of emphatic structures in BH: “[W]e are not interested in
discussing the theory that [VS] order is normal because action is the most im-
portant piece of information to be conveyed by this sentence type called verbal
clause. In other words, by saying that V-S is the normal word-order we do not
mean that it is logically or intrinsically so, but simply statistically.”28

However, there have been a number of challenges to using simple statistical
dominance to determine basic word order. For example, given a 2:1 ratio of
VS to SV order in a given text, are we justiﬁed in classifying that language as
VS? Linguists are not in agreement on this issue. The problem is exacerbated
when the statistics are even closer, as Matthew Dryer notes: “In the Auk dia-
lect of Tlingit, for example, a text count (Dryer 1985) for the order of subject
and verb revealed VS outnumbering SV by 177 to 156. In a case like this, the
difference in frequency is sufﬁciently small that it does not seem reasonable to
say that VS is more frequent than SV or that VS is basic.”29
IIIc. Distribution
The third approach is based on the test of “distribution.” Given two or
more alternatives for a syntactic construction, the one that occurs in the greater
number of environments, that is, it is less restricted, is the basic order. Note
that this is not the same as statistical dominance, because the issue at hand is
not “occurrence” but “environment.” For instance, in English, manner ad-
verbs may both precede and follow the verb, as in (14–15):
Although both options exist in English, based on the distributional patterns, it
can be argued that “verb-adverb” order is basic because there are environ-
ments in which the order “adverb-verb” is not used (e.g., ?*Ethan is slowly
walking), or is less felicitous.30
IIId. Pragmatics
Finally, we come to the last criterion by which basic word order is often
examined: pragmatics. This criterion is particularly signiﬁcant for “free-order”
languages, that is, languages exhibiting a great deal of word order variation. At
the core of this approach is the recognition that the majority of language data
contains pragmatically “marked” or “non-neutral” clauses due to the nature of

human communication. Even for languages that have a more rigid word order,
such as English, pragmatics can produce extreme but grammatically acceptable
examples, as in (16a) and (17a):31
The recognition of the importance of pragmatics in the order of constitu-
ents in some languages has provided a necessary corrective to the investigation
of basic word order. Marianne Mithun even questions whether some lan-
guages can be assigned to a typologically word order category.32 In particular,
for languages with an apparently “free word order,” Mithun argues that we
should not be looking for a basic word order in terms of the position of subject,
verb, and modiﬁers. Rather, she suggests that in these languages it might be the
case that the syntactic role of an item (subject, object, etc.) is less important
than its discourse role (e.g., topic-hood, identiﬁability, “newsworthiness”).
Thus, the order of the constituents, subject noun phrase, verb, complements,
and so on, will change in a “basic clause,” depending on the information status
of the constituents. At the very least, this type of argument has made it clear
that an awareness of how a language allows information to be structured is a
fundamentally important part of word order study.33
IV. The Word Order of Proverbs
With the four basic criteria in hand, we are adequately prepared to begin
considering the data from BH proverbs. The ﬁrst task is to isolate the proper
database of examples from the book of Proverbs. Since the primary issue for
this study is the position of the subject in relation to the verb (not comple-
ments or adjuncts), we are limited to clauses with full noun phrase subjects. In
addition, we are limited to examples with ﬁnite verbs, because clauses with
non-ﬁnite verbs often exhibit their own distinctive syntactic features. After

(ed. D. L. Payne; Amsterdam: Benjamins, 1992) 15–61.
33. I do not think, however, that Mithun’s observations obviate a basic word order dis-
cussion for those languages. I would still suggest that in clauses in which the constituents all
share the same pragmatic marking (e.g., all the constituents are “new,” such as in presenta-
tive clauses), the observable order could be identiﬁed as basic.

sifting through the clauses in Proverbs for these features, I arrived at an initial
database of 504 clauses (18), with the statistic breakdown noted:
However, this database includes all types of clauses and verbs. The basic
clause type criterion, however, reﬂects the recognition that there are a number
of factors that affect word order for purely syntactic reasons.34 Thus, it has
been established cross-linguistically that subordinate clauses, modal clauses,
negative clauses, and interrogative clauses are complicating factors.35 There-
fore, I will eliminate those clauses speciﬁed in (19) and illustrated by the ex-
amples in (20–23):

Some Biblical Genealogies” [Journal of Translation and Textlinguistics 10 (1997)] 10 n. 4).

36. Negation is often closely linked to modality (see J. Lyons, Semantics [Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1977] 768–77; F. R. Palmer, Mood and Modality [Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1986] 218–21; L. Hoye, Adverbs and Modality in English [Lon-
don: Longman, 1997]). Furthermore, in some languages negative function words clearly
affect the word order of the subject, verb, and object constituents (see T. Givón, On Under-
standing Grammar [New York: Academic, 1979] 124–25). Thus, the negative examples
should be subsumed under the presentation of modal clauses, unless the negative in question
is an item adverb; see Ps 103:10 (cf. GKC 478–79; B. K. Waltke and M. O’Connor, Intro-
duction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax [Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1990] 659–60; JM 603).

Once the dependent, modal, negative, and interrogative clauses are sorted out,
the remaining database includes 319 clauses from the book of Proverbs:
And yet another sorting needs to be performed. Both syntactic (that is, par-
allel constituents) and semantic (that is, parallel lexemes) parallelism make it
clear that many line pairs present contrasts (for example, righteous vs. wicked,
rich vs. poor, wise vs. foolish).38 Because the presence of a contrast suggests

37. The S-Neg-V order of the b-line presents an interesting case of focus-fronting (see
below for a brief explanation of this phenomenon). First, the semantics of the syntactic co-
ordination between the a-line and the b-line should probably be interpreted as result. Sec-
ond, the placement of the subject noun phrase above the negative and verb (which, due to
the negative, would normally be located in the highest position in the clause) suggests that
the subject is being focused. The intended nuance of the line pair, then, is probably similar
to a Qal we˙omer statement: if the garments are burned, how much more will the man’s lap,
or worse! be burned. Thus, the subject wydgb is contrastive with one explicit (the man’s lap)
and other implicit alternatives, which are presumably more sensitive items that could be
burned.

the great likelihood that one or both of the clauses are no longer “unmarked”
or “normal” and that the word order may have been affected, we must exclude
such examples as speciﬁed in (25) from the basic word order database. The ex-
ample in (26) illustrates the variety of contrastive constituents in the book of
Proverbs, from prepositional phrases to entire clauses.
39
It is equally evident, however, that many line pairs do not contain contrastive
relationships between the parallel items. Indeed, this feature no doubt contrib-
uted to the identiﬁcation of Lowth’s categories of “synonymous” and “syn-
thetic” parallelism. Prov 22:8 is a good case in point: it is difﬁcult to imagine
what kind of contrast exists between the two lines of (27).
40
Both lines in (27) exhibit SV order, thereby presenting a degree of syntactic
parallelism. There is also a very general semantic parallelism that binds the two
lines together, because presumably the rod of anger in the b-line belongs to

39. The two noun phrases are clearly contrastive; however, although the verbs differ, it
cannot be argued that they are contrastive as well, because “receiving commands” and “be-
ing thrust aside” are simply different actions/events, not opposing members of the same
semantic continuum. Proverbs like this are elliptical in nature, with the opposites of the
predicates intended for application to the opposites of the subjects (i.e., 10:8a should be read
as both “the wise of heart receives commands” and “the not-wise of heart does not receive
commands”; so too, 10:8b).

the ‘one who sows injustice’ from the a-line (i.e., the third masculine-singular
possessive sufﬁx in wtrb[ refers back to the implicit subject of [rwz).
The numerous examples like (27) seriously challenge a VS analysis of BH,
whether in proverbs or elsewhere. If there is no apparent contrast (and, since
there is no larger discourse, the issue cannot be a change in topic—that is,
what functionalists call “topicalization”), then what motivates the SV order?
However, if BH were an SV language, these examples would simply be prag-
matically unmarked and representative of basic word order.
The exclusion of overtly contrastive clauses results in a database of 103
clauses from which we can potentially identify basic word order in Proverbs,
illustrated in (28–29). That is, these clauses do not appear to be dependent,
negative, modal, or interrogative, and they present no clear contrast.

43
These statistics greatly favor an SV analysis of word order in BH proverbs (by
a ratio of 4:1). Two additional linguistic features support this SV analysis. First,
it is signiﬁcant that many, if not all, of the VS clauses included in the 22 ex-
amples described above in (28) can be analyzed as a type of modal clause.
Consider the example in (30):
In VS examples such as Prov 22:13, the event represented by the perfective
verb rma appears to be “habitual”; in the case of (30), this is what the lazy per-
son repeatedly says in order to get out of work.

Word Order in the Book of Proverbs
151
The connection between VS order and the habitual nature of the action lies
in the issue of modality. Importantly, linguists have come to recognize that
many languages use modal forms to express habitual action;44 additionally, the
BH perfective has recently been associated with modal uses.45 Thus, we have
the habitual action associated with the BH perfective in (30) reﬂecting the
modal use of the verb. More to the point, it has been observed by both E. J.
Revell (for the narrative material in Judges)46 and me (for Genesis)47 that
modal clauses in BH prose exhibit VS basic order, whereas indicative clauses
exhibit SV basic order. To summarize, perfective verbs expressing habitual ac-
tion in the book of Proverbs are being used modally and as such exhibit a basic
VS word order; as “modal” clauses, they should be excluded from considera-
tion as basic word order. This leaves us with no VS examples, and 81 SV ex-
amples from which to identify basic word order in BH proverbs.
If SV is the basic word order, why then are there so many clauses with VS
order? The answer lies with an inherently generative syntactic notion that I
brieﬂy mentioned above in section III: “triggered inversion.” Thus, for all of
the clauses that I have excluded so far in this study, the simplest explanation for
the dominant VS order is that subordinating functors like rça or yk, negatives
like la or al, interrogatives like hml or h, and modality all serve as syntactic
triggers, causing the verb to rise higher than the subject and producing VS order.
The second feature that buttresses the SV analysis of BH proverbs—or at
least removes a possible set of counter examples—concerns the status of the
ﬁrst line in a contrastive line pair. It is far from obvious that that SV order of
the a-line in line pairs that do present a contrast is pragmatically marked (i.e.,
exhibit the fronting of the subject for contrast). Up to this point, I have ex-
cluded such examples from my database. Yet, it is arguable whether the initial
subjects in this type of example, such as the ﬁrst line in (31),48 need to be read
as contrastive, because the ﬁrst-time reader/listener really has no idea if the
proverb contains an opposing or non-opposing second line.

In other words, at the outset of the proverb, one has no idea whether the b-
line will reinforce or heighten the positive statement about the wise son in the
a-line, or make an observation about the opposing constituent, the foolish
son, as (31) does. Because examples of this sort are open to different readings
(some may prefer to read the initial subject constituent as contrastive in the a-
line, but whether this was intended is far from clear), they do not provide sup-
port for either argument—that BH is VS or SV.
In summary, what the data from BH proverbs suggest is that an SV analysis
for BH word order provides the greatest descriptive adequacy. If we start with
an SV arrangement, we can account for all other arrangements by means of
two very common linguistic phenomena: “triggered inversion” (which I have
just described) and “focus fronting.” Note that both are predicated upon a the-
ory of constituent movement; that is, both imply that a constituent has been
“raised” further than normal in the clause due to some motivation.
I have already argued that examples (20–23) illustrate syntactically motivated
triggered inversion; in the remaining space I will brieﬂy illustrate focus-front-
ing in BH proverbs. First, it is important to recognize that triggered inversion
is not limited to clauses with initial function words; any item that is positioned
above the subject and verb constituents serves as a trigger, producing VS order.
Not surprisingly, then, we ﬁnd VS order in clauses in which a constituent has
been fronted for focus.49 How is focus fronting manifested in the syntax of BH
proverbs? The b-line in (32) provides us with a good example.
(31) a wise son gladdens his father // 
but a foolish son is his mother’s misery (10:1bc)
 ba jmçy µkj ˆb
wma tgwt lysk ˆbw
49. I ﬁnd it useful to distinguish two general approaches to focus. On the one hand, fo-
cus may refer to the information in a clause that the addressee does not share with the
speaker and thus is “asserted,” “new,” or “added” (see Lyons, Semantics, 509; K. Lambrecht,
Information Structure and Sentence Form: Topic, Focus, and the Mental Representations of Discourse
Referents [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994] 206–18). It should be noted that
“new,” “added,” and “asserted” are not necessarily equivalent concepts, and often linguists
take great pains to distinguish among them. On the other hand, focus may refer to the rela-
tively most important or salient piece of information in a clause (see S. C. Dik, The Theory of
Functional Grammar, Part 1: The Structure of the Clause [2nd rev. ed.; ed. K. Hengeveld; Berlin:
Mouton, de Gruyter, 1997]; E. Vallduví and M. Vilkuna, “On Rheme and Kontrast,” in The
Limits of Syntax [ed. P. Culicover and L. McNally; San Diego: Academic, 1998] 79–108).
The ﬁrst approach to focus means that every clause must have a focused item (excluding an
absolute redundancy) because some information is always being added or asserted. The sec-
ond approach to focus often consists of a linguistically nuanced way of discussing the non-
linguist’s “emphasis” or “contrast.” In this work, I am using a deﬁnition of focus that falls
into the latter category. For further discussion, see my “Adjusting Our Focus (review of Kat-
suomi Shimasaki, Focus Structure in Biblical Hebrew: A Study of Word Order and Information
Structure),” Hebrew Studies 44 (2003) 203–15.

In the a-line of example (32), we have a banal statement attributing the blame-
less person’s success to his righteousness. The b-line presents an initial PP
(prepositional phrase), wt[çrb, that does not parallel any item in the a-line in
a strict syntactic sense but apparently contrasts semantically with the syntactic
subject of the a-line, tqdx. The formal semantic features of both items (both
are feminine-singular nouns) suggest that the contrast is indeed between the
two initial constituents in the line pair. (I belabor this point in order to dem-
onstrate that, while one could identify a chiasm in this verse [SVO//PPVS],
such an analysis would lack any explanatory power.)
In terms of the pragmatic structure of the two lines, the ﬁrst line presents an
ambiguous case: it is possible to read ﬁrst lines of this sort (whether in Hebrew
or English) as having either a contrastive or noncontrastive initial subject. It
is the order of the b-line that is unambiguously illustrative. The initial PP
wt[çrb is clearly focus-fronted to set the reason50 of the wicked person’s fail-
ure in contrast: it is his “wicked behavior” that will bring about his end. The
function of the focus instructs the listener/reader to establish a membership
set51 that includes all the possible reasons that a wicked person might fail—for
example, his thoughts, his associates, his behavior, and so on—and set the one
reason chosen in the PP, “his wickedness,” over against the others, presumably
to stress with absolute clarity the reason that the wicked must lack success
in life.
The pragmatically motivated movement of the PP to the clause-initial po-
sition sets in motion a chain of events that results in the raising of the verb over
the subject (that is, triggered inversion occurs). Thus, the VS order in the
b-line can be explained in simple syntactic terms (thereby further undermining
(32) PPVS
the righteousness of the blameless will straighten 
his path // 
but in his wickedness the wicked will fall (11:5)
 wkrd rçyt µymt tqdx
[çr lpy wt[çrbw
50. Or the initial PP may specify the type of result if the preposition speciﬁes manner
rather than means; see M. V. Fox, Proverbs 10–31 (New York: Doubleday, forthcoming).
51. “A set is any collection of objects, which are described as its members. We can specify
a set by reference to a property which all members share: for example, we can speak of a set
of British towns with a population over 1 million, or a set of English sentences. Alternatively,
a set can be speciﬁed by listing its members: for example, there is a three-membered set
whose members are Margaret Thatcher, the number 7, and the city of San Francisco. As this
example indicates, the members of a set need not ‘belong together’ in any natural fashion”
(K. Malmkjær, The Linguistics Encyclopedia [London: Routledge, 1991] 401; see also J. van
der Does, “Set Theory,” in The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics [ed. R. E. Asher; Ox-
ford: Pergamon, 1994] 3861–64).

any sort of chiastic, or similar “stylistic,” analysis). There are many of these
focus-fronted PPs52 or even focus-fronted objects53 in Proverbs.
As a last example, the a-line in Prov 22:23 presents a focus-fronted subject.
One environment in which these unambiguously appear is within dependent
clauses, clauses that should exhibit triggered inversion to VS order but do not.
54
Example (33) presents one of those less-common situations in which a two-
line proverb is dependent on the previous context, in this case, the preceding
verse (22:22). The preceding verse is an exhortation to avoid oppressing the
lowly and poor and suggests a legal context. In the a-line of Prov 22:23, then,
the legal language is continued, and a rather forceful motivation is given for
abiding by this advice: because “it is Yhwh” that will take up their case against
you if you oppress them. To make this point unambiguously, the subject noun
phrase “Yhwh” is focus-fronted within the subordinate clause. That is, the
focus-fronting results in SV order even though the syntactic environment is a
dependent clause and normally exhibits VS due to triggered inversion. Such
examples, of which there are many, indicate that the triggered inversion to VS
order can be superﬁcially negated by the movement of a focus-fronted constit-
uent to a position even higher than the raised verb. SV examples like the one
in (33) also demonstrate that even SV order need not present an unmarked,
basic word order clause.
V. Conclusion
I have focused on data in the book of Proverbs to further our understanding
of BH word order. Using both typological and generative principles, I have as-
serted that BH proverbs exhibit a basic SV word order. However, at the outset
I also suggested that BH proverbs provide a better source of data for a basic
word order analysis than BH narrative. If so, then word order studies should
reevaluate the rest of the data in the Hebrew Bible in light of my conclusions
here. In other words, I suggest that the syntax of BH narrative should be stud-
ied in light of BH proverbs and not the other way around.

Exegetical and Stylistic Analysis of a Number of 
Aphorisms in the Book of Proverbs: 
Mitigation of Monotony in Repetitions in Parallel Texts
Shamir Yona

The study of parallel texts in Hebrew Scripture and the variations, small
and great, between them has a long history. Scholars have called attention to
two kinds of variations. The ﬁrst kind of variation includes slight changes in
the order of the elements, which results in a chiastic structure. The second
kind of variation involves the substitution of alternate synonymous words and/
or phrases.1 Assuming that the respective variations are signiﬁcant on the level

allel clauses and in the variations introduced when a given clause is repeated in a different
context. Avishur attempts to account for the variations in repeated versets chronologically.

nomenon in question frequently in his Forms of the Priestly Style in the Pentateuch ( Jerusalem:

into the matter under discussion in his Literary Pattern of Three and Four in the Bible ( Jerusa-

eleven psalms that share the common idea of God’s hearkening to the prayer of the psalmist

of meaning and content, scholars have tried to account for the variations in
several ways. Some scholars saw in the variations the inﬂuence of the practices
of ancient copyists.2 Others accounted for the variations as an attempt to avoid
monotony.3 In fact, Talmon presented a theory that combined the latter two
suggestions.4
In the present essay, I suggest a fourth hypothesis to account for the varia-
tions encountered when a particular proverb is repeated in the book of Prov-
erbs. According to my hypothesis, many of the variations among repeated
texts can be accounted for as a function of the phenomenon that Freedman
and Hyland called “expanded repetition.”5 Expanded repetition involves the
appearance of a given root twice or more within parallel versets or verses or
larger textual units. In fact, the phenomenon of expanded repetition appears
also in prose texts characterized by rhythm that marks them as high-register
prose. Texts of this sort are found especially in legal and cultic contexts, in
which patterns of repetition serve a mnemonic function.
Indeed, this model of expanded repetition is found not only in Hebrew
Scripture but also in other literatures of the ancient Near East. A few examples
appeared already in Akkadian literature. The phenomenon is attested much
more frequently in Ugaritic literature, and a few examples can be found in
Phoenician inscriptions. The Hebrew Ben Sira also presents numerous ex-

amples of expanded repetition. In addition, poetic texts from Qumran reveal
several important examples of expanded repetition.6
In expanded repetition, a word that appears in one verset or verse reappears
in another verset or verse either in the same or in another morphology. If, for
example, a term appears in the construct or the genitive in a construct genitive
chain in a given verse or verset, it will reappear in the opposite position in the
later verse or verset. For example, in Isa 56:5 the term µv ‘name’ appears in
verset A as an isolated word, while in verset C it appears as a construct:
I will give them in my Temple and in my walls a monument and a name (µv) //
an eternal name (µlw[ µv) I will give them.
Similarly, in Joel 4:19 the noun hmmv ‘desolation’ appears in verset A as an
isolated form serving as object of the preposition l, while in verset B it re-
appears in genitive position at the end of a prepositional phrase:
Egypt will be for a desolation (hmmç)
and Edom a desolate waste (hmmv rbdml).
However, in many cases the order is turned around so that the construct
genitive chain precedes the use of one of its elements as an isolated term. For
example, in Ps 124:7 the term jp ‘trap’ appears in verset A in the construct
genitive chain ‘trap of fowlers’, while in verset B the term jp ‘trap’ appears as
an isolated term functioning as the subject of a clause.
In Ps 104:3–4 the single term jwr ‘wind’ appears as a genitive in both of
the clauses. However, in the ﬁrst clause the term is singular, while in the fol-
lowing clause the term is plural. Together, the two clauses function as “paral-
lelism of singular and plural”:
He sets the rafters of his lofts in the waters,
makes the clouds his chariot,
moves on the wings of the wind.
He makes the winds his messengers,7
ﬁery ﬂames his servants.
Just as in Ps 104:3–4 the term jwr ‘wind’ appears as singular and plural in
the two respective clauses, thereby forming an example of singular-plural par-
allelism, so in Jer 23:19 the terms tr[s ‘a storm of’ (feminine and construct)
and r[s ‘storm’ (masculine and isolated) create both feminine-masculine par-
allelism and expanded repetition:

University Press.

Shamir Yona
158
Lo, the storm of the Lord goes forth in fury,
a whirling storm;
it whirls down upon the heads of the wicked.8
As I pointed out above, the phenomenon of expanded repetition is also re-
ﬂected in many parallel passages. In one member of the pair/group of parallel
passages, a given lexeme appears as an isolated word, whether substantive or
verb. In another member of the group of parallel passages, the same word
functions as a construct or a genitive in a construct genitive chain. In some in-
stances, the parallel text—for our purposes, text B—exhibits expansion in that
the lexeme that appears in text A as an isolated noun or verb reappears in text
B as part of a construct genitive chain. In other cases, one senses that the rela-
tionship between the members of a group of parallel passages exhibits contrac-
tion rather than expansion. In the latter instance, the construct genitive chain
is replaced by a single word, which is synonymous in meaning with the given
construct genitive chain. The frequent use of this structure of contraction
makes a strong case for its having been deliberately employed by the ancient
authors.
The stylistic logic demonstrates a tendency to limit verbatim repetition by
employing a minor variant that in no way interferes with the attempt to repeat
the same thing in different words.9
In this study we will concentrate on variation in several aphorisms, which
recur several times in the book of Proverbs with variations that exemplify ex-
panded repetition. In Prov 6:24 we read:
to keep you from an evil woman,
from the smooth talk of a woman from abroad;
while in Prov 7:5 we read:
to keep you from a strange woman,
from a woman from abroad who speaks smoothly.
The two verses serve as textbook cases of the variations presented in expanded
repetition. In the ﬁrst clause of Prov 6:24, the construct genitive chain is
[r tva ‘evil woman’. Indeed, this expression is grammatically plausible, but it
is anomalous from the standpoint of biblical parallelism. Some scholars emend
[r to hrz in light of Prov 7:5. In fact, this emendation would create greater
8. See also Jer 30:33. Concerning feminine-masculine parallelism in this verse, see Ber-
lin, Dynamics, 42.
9. It is well known that the translators responsible for the Old Greek versions of Prov-
erbs, Job, and Sirach reduced the number of parallel clauses precisely because of the difﬁ-
culty they had in imitating Hebrew synonymous parallelism in Greek.

congruence between Prov 6:24 and its various parallels.10 Other scholars sug-
gest revocalizing [r; as ['re.11 Indeed, it is accepted that the vocalization in the
standard Hebrew text does not always reﬂect authorial intent.12 Many modern
scholars emended [r tva to ˚[r tva ‘your neighbor’s wife’. Indeed, in the
immediate context in v. 26, we ﬁnd that idea expressed by the Hebrew ex-
pression vya tva, while in v. 29 we ﬁnd that idea expressed by the Hebrew
expression wh[r tva ‘his neighbor’s wife’, which is to say, ‘someone else’s
wife’.13 Indeed, if we adopt the emendation of [r tva ‘an evil woman’ to
˚[r tça ‘your neighbor’s wife’ in Prov 6:24, the entire passage consisting of
Prov 6:24–29 constitutes an inclusio referring to adultery.14
Additional support for the emendation is found in the LXX, whose render-
ing gunaiko;Í uJpavndrou means ‘a married [to someone else] woman’. The
logic behind the restored text is that, on the basis of the principle of contracted
repetition, the restored version of Prov 6:24 employs the construct genitive
chain ‘woman of your neighbor’. According to the same logic, the parallel text
in Prov 7:5 employs the isolated term hva ‘woman’ with the addition of the
attributive adjective hrz ‘strange’.
The same pair of verses, Prov 6:24 and 7:5, exhibits a second pair of expres-
sions that reﬂect the principle of contracted repetition. In 6:24b we ﬁnd the

11. Toy (Proverbs) notes that Baumgartner objected to this emendation because in his
opinion the expression ['re tva ‘someone else’s wife’ always appears in Biblical Hebrew with
a pronominal sufﬁx; cf. also William McKane, Proverbs (OTL; London: SPCK, 1970); see
also BHS. For another suggestion, see Gustav Boström, Proverbia Studien: Die Weisheit und
das Fremde Weib in Spr. 1–9 (Lunds Universitets Arsskrift n.s. 1/30/3; Lund: University of
Lund, 1935) 143–45; cf. also Roger Whybray, Wisdom in Proverbs (London: SCM, 1965) 49.

that the original ﬁnal kap could easily have dropped out by haplography because the follow-
ing letter in the verse, mem, was so similar to the kap in Paleo-Hebrew script.
14. Indeed, the recognition of the inclusio is important also for settling the controversy
among scholars concerning the composition of the literary unit in Prov 6:20–35. See, for
example, the view of Boström (Proverbia), who holds that the passage in question is not a
unity because vv. 20–26 deal with pagan cultic prostitution, while vv. 27–35 deal with the
prohibition against adultery. Concerning the non-unitary nature of the passage and the later
additions contained therein, see Whybray, Wisdom. McKane (Proverbs) argued against the
theory of cultic prostitution, expressing doubt that the woman in question is necessarily a
foreigner; see also the criticism of Fox, Proverbs 1–9, 231. He holds that the passage deals
with adultery, regardless of who the woman may be.

construct genitive chain ˆwvl tqlj ‘smoothness of tongue’,15 while in Prov
7:5b we ﬁnd an isolated word, the verb hqyljh, which constitutes, vis-à-vis
Prov 6:24b, an example of variation achieved by noun-verb parallelism.16
Moreover, the two clauses constitute a chiastic structure, which itself is one of
the most frequently employed devices for achieving variety in both the poetry
and the prose of the Hebrew Bible.17
Were we to juxtapose Prov 6:24b and Prov 7:5b, we would in fact achieve
the following chiastic structure:
from the smooth talk of a woman from abroad //
from a woman from abroad who makes her speech smooth.
Another interesting example of expanded repetition in the book of Proverbs
comprises the pair Prov 9:1a and 14:1a:
Wisdom built her house //
the wisest of women built her house.
Some scholars found it difﬁcult to comprehend the expansion accomplished
by use of the construct genitive chain in Prov 14:1a. Therefore, they sug-
gested removing the word ‘women’. However, this emendation requires us to
revocalize the noun t/mk}j" ‘the wisest’ to t/mk}j: ‘wisdom’18 on the basis of the
parallel text in Prov 9:1a.19 The imaginary crux leads to two additional emen-
dations in the single verset of Prov 14:1a: (1) substituting the verb µyct ‘she
15. Avraham Kahana (The Book of Proverbs [ed. A. Kahana; Zhitomir: A. Kahana, 1903])
explains: ‘smoothness [an abstract noun] of tongue’ of the strange woman. Other scholars
(e.g., BHS) suggest the reading hyrkn ˆ/vl}, meaning that the emphasis is ﬁrst and foremost
on the foreignness of the speech; so also Fox, Proverbs 1–9. Tur-Sinai, in his commentary,
argues for a different syntactical division so that ˆwvl tqljm ‘one who speaks smoothly’ is
the main issue here, while “a strange woman” serves as an appositive to “one who speaks
smoothly.” In this case, the expression “strange woman” does not mean a woman of foreign
origin but, as Fox (Proverbs 1–9) explains, ‘someone else’s wife’.
16. Concerning verb-noun parallelism employing the same root, see Berlin, Dynamics,
54–55.
17. With reference to the chiastic structure found here, see Paran, “Repeated Proverbs,”

nine plural, see GKC §86L. See also William Albright, “Some Canaanite-Phoenician Sources

will put’ for the noun µyvn ‘women’; and (2) changing the verbal predicate
‘she built’ to the adverb of manner ˆtyab ‘with strength’.20 The two emenda-
tions together yield the following reconstruction: Wisdom will establish her
house with strength.
These emendations demonstrate both the insensitivity of many scholars to
the phenomenon of stylistic variations and the ease with which they rush to
improve texts that they assume to be difﬁcult. Often the proposed emendation
serves only to make a given aphorism more like its expanded or contracted
parallel and neglects an in-depth examination of the meaning of each of the
texts. Now, a number of scholars have opposed shortening the expanded aph-
orisms. Delitzsch, for example, relying on the expression “the wisest of her
ladies” in Judg 5:29, interpreted µyvn twmkj in Prov 14:1 as ‘the wisest of
women’, and Toy agreed.21 Dahood, in turn, sought a parallel to this interpre-
tation in the Ugaritic expression ºmq nsm,22 which he translated ‘the wisest of
men’. However, this Ugaritic expression can, with equal plausibility, be ren-
dered ‘the strongest of men’, as was argued by Gordon and then by Sivan.23
Paran,24 following Delitzsch, takes the Hebrew expression µyvn twmkj to
mean ‘a wise woman’, the antithesis of the twlysk tva ‘foolish woman’ re-
ferred to in Prov 9:13–18.25 On the basis of this comparison, Paran argues
that in Prov 9:1 the term t/mk}j: also denotes ‘a wise woman’ (literally, ‘a
woman of wisdom’).
In my opinion, we should accept Delitzsch’s view. However, we must note
that from a stylistic point of view we have a pattern of repetition in which an
isolated word in one text is expanded into a construct genitive chain in an-
other text. The variation is motivated by the poet’s desire to avoid monotony.
In addition, we must emphasize the fact that, while from a morphological-
syntactic point of view the expression µyvn twmkj is a construct genitive
meaning ‘the wisest of women’, it has another sense altogether from a seman-
tic point of view: women’s wisdom.

This phenomenon of a construct genitive chain serving as a substitute for a
noun followed by an attributive adjective is reﬂected also in legal and cultic
texts of Hebrew Scripture. For example, twxm yqyqr (Lev 2:4), which, from a
syntactic point of view is a construct genitive chain, serves semantically to
mean ‘thin wafers’.26 Similarly, Cassuto explains the expression ‘the blood of
my sacriﬁce’ in Exod 23:18 and 34:25 as meaning ‘my sacriﬁce of blood’.27 In
the same vein, the expression ‘the evil of your doings’ in Isa 1:16 is used to
mean ‘your evil doings’.28
Another fascinating example of the phenomenon of expanded repetition is
afforded by comparing Prov 10:1, 15:2, and 29:3. The three verses read as
follows:
Prov 10:1
A wise son brings joy to his father;
a foolish son is his mother’s sorrow.
Prov 15:20
A wise son brings joy to his father;
a fool of a man humiliates his mother.
Prov 29:3
A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
but he who keeps company with harlots will lose his wealth.
Two of the three pairs of antithetical proverbs are very similar, while the third
is similar to the other two only in its opening clause. Let us look ﬁrst at the
two very similar pairs (10:1; 15:20). These two proverbs are characterized by
very precise antithetical parallelism, whose cohesion is enhanced by both the
antithetical nouns wise/fool and the ﬁxed pair father/mother.29 The opening
clauses of the two proverbs are identical,30 while the second clauses of the two

guages, see Yitzhak Avishur, Stylistic Studies of Word-Pairs in Biblical and Ancient Semitic Lit-
eratures (AOAT 210; Kevelaer: Butzon and Bercker, 1984) 3, 604–5.
30. It is widely held that, when a given clause recurs in a number of different proverbs,
the repeated clause must originally have been an independent short proverb; so, for example,
Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology (Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, 1971) 63–70.
The most extreme position on this question is found in W. O. E. Oesterley and Theodore

Exegetical and Stylistic Analysis of Aphorisms in Proverbs
163
proverbs are distinguished from each other in two ways. The two second
clauses are related to each other by chiasm31 in that the ﬁrst opens with the
expression lysk ˆb ‘a foolish son’, while the second opens with the expression
µda lysk ‘a fool of a man’. The second form of variegation is achieved by the
pattern of contracted repetition in that Prov 10:1b ends with the construct
genitive wma tgwt ‘his mother’s sorrow’,32 while Prov 15:20 ends with the iso-
lated noun wma functioning as the direct object of the participle hzwb.
Now let us consider the relationship between the ﬁrst two aphorisms and
the third proverb. This relationship is limited to the ﬁrst clause. In the third
proverb (Prov 29:3), the ﬁrst clause is very close in ideational content to the
opening clause of each of the other two aphorisms. However, the opening
clause of the third proverb differs from the other two opening clauses in that
it is longer.33 In addition, it exhibits stylistic variations. What is of interest to
31. Concerning this structure, see Paran, “Repeated Proverbs,” 27. Note that in some
Hebrew manuscripts and in some ancient versions (the LXX, the Aramaic Tg. Proverbs, and
the Peshi†ta) Prov 15:20 has the expression “a foolish son” instead of “a fool of a man” (see
BHS). However, the expression “a fool of a man” recurs in Prov 21:20. Consequently, there
is no reason to emend it. See McKane, Proverbs, at Prov 15:20.
32. In the Aramaic Tg. Proverbs (as in many places in which an abstract noun appears in
the Hebrew text), the construct genitive expression employing two nouns “his mother’s
sorrow” is replaced by the verbal expression “he makes his mother miserable” (see Prov
17:21, where in place of “her sorrow” in the MT, the Aramaic version reads “her misery”),
which apparently means that he embarrasses her. One of the meanings of axwmyj in Ara-
maic is blushing because of embarrassment, while in the Pael the verbal root ≈mj means ‘to
embarrass’. See Marcus Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim (New York: Pardes, 1950)
457b, 479a, s.v. ≈mj I; Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic (Ramat
Gan: Bar Ilan University Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002) 470a,
s.v. ≈mj II.
33. Concerning the lengthening of the aphorism in Prov 19:3, see Paran, “Repeated
Proverbs,” 24. Paran, however, does not deal with the aphorism in question in the context
of his discussion of expanded parallelism.
Robinson, An Introduction to the Books of the Old Testament (London: SPCK, 1953) 205–6.
In fact, Tamar Oron, in her comment on this verse, treats it as a short popular proverb, to
which another hemistich was added in order to create a pair of parallel clauses (The Book of
Proverbs [ed. Nili Shupak; Olam ha-Tanakh; Tel Aviv: Davidson-Ittai, 1998] Hebrew). Ac-
cording to Oron, the frequent occurrence of the proverbial statement in question in a vari-
ety of contexts in the book of Proverbs proves that the clause in question was widely quoted.
However, it seems doubtful to me that this is really a case of a single hemistich proverb. In
any case, this is not the place to argue this point one way or the other. For another view,
see Hans-Joachim Hermisson, Studien zur israelitischen Spruchweisheit (Neukirchen-Vluyn:
Neukirchener Verlag, 1968) 52; Roland Murphy, “Form Criticism and Wisdom Literature,”
CBQ 31 (1969) 478; see also Fox, Proverbs 1–9, ad loc.

us is the stylistic variation, which here again consists of the expansion of the
isolated noun µkj ‘wise person’, found in each of the ﬁrst two proverbs, into
the construct genitive phrase ‘one who loves wisdom’. In addition, we should
point out the recurring root µkj, whose noun form appears in gender-
matched parallelism,34 once as a masculine-singular adjective and once as an
abstract feminine noun.
The last two examples of expanded repetition to be considered are Prov
16:9 and Prov 20:24. The two verses read as follows:
Prov 16:9
A man’s heart may plot out his course,
but it is the Lord who directs his steps.
Prov 20:24 35
A man’s steps are decided by the Lord;
what does a man know36 about his own way?
The stylistic-structural variation between the two aphorisms is double. The
two aphorisms stand in a chiastic relationship37 to each other. The two syn-
onymous clauses shared by the two proverbs involve contracted repetition in
that the subject of the ﬁrst proverb is the construct genitive phrase ‘a man’s
heart’, while the subject of the second clause is the isolated noun ‘man’. Sim-
ilarly, the relationship of the isolated noun ‘steps’ at the end of Prov 16:9 to
the genitive construct phrase ‘a man’s steps’ at the beginning of Prov 20:24 is
34. This kind of parallelism, which is found both in Hebrew Scripture and in Ugaritic
literature, was ﬁrst pointed out by Umberto Cassuto, The Goddess Anath ( Jerusalem:
Magnes, 1951) 36–37 [Hebrew]; other studies of the phenomenon include Wilfred Watson,
Traditional Techniques in Classical Hebrew Verse (Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 1994)
192–239; Berlin, Dynamics, 41–44; Avishur, The Repetition and the Parallelism, 205–9.
35. An aphorism very similar to this one is found in Ps 37:23: “The steps of a good per-
son are ordered by the Lord, and he delights in his behavior.” Concerning the relationship
between these two aphorisms, see Toy, Proverbs, at Prov 20:24; Artur Weiser, The Psalms
(OTL; London: SPCK, 1962), at Ps 37:23; Zvi Peretz Chayes, The Book of Psalms (ed.
A. Kahana; Zhitomir: A. Kahana, 1903), at Ps 37:23. Chayes had difﬁculty with the verb
wnnwk, which is found in Ps 37:23 but disappears from the aphorism in Prov 20:24. Despite
the fact that his interpretation is forced, Chayes concludes that the verb wnnwk in Ps 37:23 is
superﬂuous. There is here a clear tendency to level the distinctions between parallel texts.
This tendency is the consequence of insensitivity to deliberate stylistic variations that were
employed by scribes who adapted the work of earlier authors.
36. BHS suggests reading ˆyky. This emendation is not necessary once one observes that
the root ˆyb is also juxtaposed with the noun ˚rd ‘way, path, behavior’ in Prov 14:8: “The
wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way.”
37. See Paran, “Repeated Proverbs,” 29.

one of expanded repetition. In addition, while 16:9 employs the singular
qa†al-noun d[x, 20:24 employs the synonymous plural construct maq†al-noun
yd[xm. These are additional forms of well-known variation in the repetition
of aphorisms.38
Our examination of many examples of deliberate variation in the repetition
of aphorisms has demonstrated that the variants are not the product of scribal
errors. Consequently, one must reject conjectural emendations designed to
eliminate supposed scribal errors. Examination of the proposed emendations
reveals a lack of sensitivity by various scholars to stylistic variations and a cav-
alier smoothing out of presumed textual difﬁculties. Often the proposed
emendation simply levels the distinction between two versions of the same
proverb. Indeed, we have seen that by and large the variations are deliberate.
What lies behind them is the principle of mitigation of monotony in the repe-
tition of aphorisms.
Consequently, biblical scholars would do well to pay careful attention to
the phenomenon of expanded/contracted repetition that we have discussed in
the present essay. This stylistic feature is not just a resource for use in biblical
prosody but also an important exegetical tool for lower and higher criticism of
biblical literature.

Forming “Fearers of Yahweh”:
Repetition and Contradiction as Pedagogy in Proverbs
Christine Roy Yoder
Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, Georgia
Over the last few decades, several studies have called our attention to vari-
ous ways that the book of Proverbs—the aim of which is to teach wisdom
(1:2–7)1—commends and embodies certain didactic strategies and tech-
niques.2 In one such study of pedagogy in Prov 10:1–31:9, William P. Brown
identiﬁes an “overarching editorial arrangement and pedagogical movement
of the book as a whole,”3 namely, a progression from Israelite to international
1. The prologue (1:2–7) is a series of phrases introducing the goals of the book of Prov-
erbs (vv. 2–6), followed by its “motto” (v. 7). Each phrase, with the exception of v. 5, be-
gins with an inﬁnitive (e.g., “for learning,” v. 2; “for gaining instruction,” v. 3; “to teach,”
v. 4; “to understand,” v. 6), a syntactical construction that connects the phrase back to the
superscription, “the proverbs of Solomon” (v. 1). The result is an extended description, an
advertisement replete with wisdom terminology, of the book’s pedagogical intentions.

Author’s note: I am pleased to dedicate this essay with gratitude to Michael V. Fox, whose

lifelong pursuit of wisdom carried out with unﬂagging zeal and according to the most
rigorous of standards.

wisdom, an increasing variety and complexity of literary forms, and an in-
creasing breadth and complexity of moral purview. Thus, the book guides
readers through a process of maturation from a silent, dependent son (chaps.
1–9) to a mature adult companion of wisdom (31:10–31).4 Progressing ped-
agogically from “basic staples” to “more advanced variegated fare,”5 Proverbs
develops readers by its content and its arrangement.
Assuming Brown’s overarching movement, I consider here two speciﬁc ped-
agogical techniques employed in the book: repetition and contradiction. Both
have a somewhat checkered past in Proverbs scholarship. Repetition at the level
of the proverb, for example, has long been construed as a vestige of the book’s
compositional history. Some interpreters posit that it is the result of minimal or
poor editing of what were originally independent subunits;6 repetition signals
a literary “seam,” so to speak, that must somehow be explained.7 Others con-
tend that iterative sayings are a consequence of the book’s oral formulation and
transmission.8 And P. W. Skehan argued that many of the repeated sayings were
produced ad hoc so that the number of verses in the book would correspond
to the numerical value of the names in its superscription (Solomon, son of Da-
vid, king of Israel = 930; see 1:1).9 To date, no proposal has garnered a consen-
sus; indeed, in the most comprehensive study to date of “twice-told” proverbs,
4. Ibid., 153.
5. Ibid., 181.
6. See, for example, O. Eissfeldt, The Old Testament: An Introduction (trans. P. R. Ack-
royd; New York: Harper & Row, 1965) 472. To explain repetition within subunits of the
book, proponents of this view argue that editors put together larger “collections” using
smaller, unmarked ones. D. C. Snell aptly notes that ultimately the reasoning is circular: “if
repetition stems from literary cleavage, then repetition remains the major indication that
there is literary cleavage” (Twice-Told Proverbs and the Composition of the Book of Proverbs
[Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1993] 11).
7. C. H. Toy, for example, claimed that repetition across subunits of the book demon-
strates that the collectors of 10:1–22:16, 22:17–24:22, 24:23–34, and chaps. 25–29 were
“not acquainted with the work of the others,” while some repetition within subunits may
be scribal errors (Proverbs [ICC; Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1899; repr. 1959] vii–viii); sim-
ilarly, W. O. E. Oesterley claimed that the compiler of the book “failed to notice” the same
sayings in the different collections and that nearly identical sayings in closely contiguous
verses “must either be due to carelessness, or they may be the work of a later scribe who
overlooked the fact that they had already been utilized” (The Book of Proverbs [New York:
Dutton, 1929] xviii).
8. See Snell’s discussion of this proposal in Twice-Told Proverbs, 13–14.

Catholic Biblical Association, 1971) 15–26.

Forming “Fearers of Yahweh”
169
Daniel C. Snell concludes that the data neither rule out any of these proposals
nor provide a clearer chronology of the collecting of the book’s subunits.10
However, not much has been done to consider the signiﬁcance of repetition
from a vantage point other than that of compositional history.11
By comparison, the prevalence and importance of the book’s contradictions
remain largely unexamined. Notable exceptions to this include Kenneth G.
Hoglund’s work on Prov 26:4–5,12 arguably the best-known example of di-
vergent admonitions in Proverbs and, according to the Talmud, a threat to the
book’s inclusion in the canon (b. Sabb. 30b); and Raymond C. Van Leeuwen’s
analysis of Proverbs’ contradictions with regard to the relation of wealth and
poverty to righteousness and wickedness.13
The aim of this essay is to consider what role(s) repetition and contradiction
play in the pedagogical movement of Proverbs. What effects do repetition and
contradiction have on readers? How do the techniques contribute to the
book’s goal to form wise people? I propose that repetition and contradiction
buttress vital claims in the book about the limits of human knowledge; that is,
the reader’s experience of repetition and contradiction reinforces certain pro-
verbial content, making it more likely that readers will emerge with the hu-
mility characteristic of “fearers of Yahweh” (see 15:33, 18:12, 22:4). After a
brief overview of the pedagogical shifts from Proverbs 1–9 to 10–30, I address
each of the techniques in turn.
I. From the Household into the World
Interpreters commonly regard Proverbs 1–9 as a hermeneutical guide for
the remainder of the book. Set in a household in an unidentiﬁed city,14 the
10. Snell concludes: “the uncertainty we have attained is not a bad thing if we therefore
manage to see a little more clearly what exactly we do not know” (Twice-Told Proverbs, 84;
cf. p. 75).
11. Although some interpreters identify repetition as a signiﬁcant element of the book’s
rhetoric, they do not elaborate on this signiﬁcance, pedagogically or otherwise (e.g., L. G.
Perdue, Proverbs [Interpretation; Louisville: John Knox, 2000] 32–33; R. C. Van Leeuwen,
“Proverbs” in NIB 5:23). Melchert is an exception, but he only attends to the fact that re-
petitive language can “heighten impressiveness” and enable memorization (Wise Teaching,
23, 47–48).

chapters are the instructions of a father to his son(s).15 Readers, regardless of
their actual identities (for example, the young and the old, 1:4–5), are asked
repeatedly to assume the identity of the silent son. Although the sages’ privi-
leging of the father-son relationship as the authoritative context for learning
offends modern Western sensibilities, this starting point is perhaps apt for a
book about the formation of human character. While notions of family cer-
tainly vary over time and between and within different cultures, because most
people have or have had a family, and the family is typically where our identi-
ties are ﬁrst formed, the household appears to be a “natural,” familiar domain
for theological-ethical teaching.16 Families command loyalty and bear primary
responsibility for initiating children into the moral beliefs, traditions, and in-
stitutions of the family and community. Similarly, the city is a bastion of hu-
man culture, purportedly a symbol of civilization at its most advanced. Both
locations are conventional, though certainly value-laden,17 places for moral
education.
The father teaches primarily in long didactic poems, or instructions. Ac-
cordingly, when he uses what appear to be preexisting, self-contained two-
line proverbs, he nestles them in larger literary contexts that directly inform
their interpretation (see, for example, 1:17; 2:21–22; 6:10–11). J. L. Cren-
shaw argues that this use suggests that each proverb “reinforces the argument
within an instruction as if to provide irrefutable proof of the position being
defended.”18 While it is debatable whether the purpose of the proverbs is, in
15. The father-to-son setting is common in ancient Near Eastern wisdom literature. For
example, the epilogue of the Egyptian Instruction of Anii is a dialogue between a father and
son (AEL 2:144–45) and the Sumerian Instructions of Shuruppak are lessons that Shuruppak
teaches his son (BWL 92–94). Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, Ecclesiastes addresses “my
son” (12:12). In Proverbs, the father-to-son setting appears in chaps. 1–9 and is assumed
occasionally elsewhere in the book (cf. 19:27; 23:15, 19, 26; 24:13, 21; 27:11). Twice, the
father associates his teaching with the teaching of his wife (1:8, 6:20), but she never speaks
directly to the son.

Proverbs 1–9,” in Women in the Hebrew Bible: A Reader (ed. A. Bach; New York: Routledge,

17. The family setting, for example, eclipses class interests: “[t]his is not a landed aristo-
crat speaking, not a senior bureaucrat, not a member of the urban middle class or a disen-
franchised intellectual, but ‘your father’” (ibid.). Indeed, when one looks more closely, it
appears that Proverbs 1–9 was intended for young men of relatively privileged circum-
stances, perhaps the sons of afﬂuent and moderately wealthy members of an urban commer-
cial class (see, e.g., 3:9–10; 5:10; 6:1–5, 35).

fact, to “prove” anything, they appeal to communal consensus and function as
“capstones” that encapsulate the larger lessons.19 Consequently, when readers
ﬁrst encounter proverbs in the book, they ﬁnd them in literary frameworks
(appropriate contexts of use) that demonstrate when and how the proverbs
“make sense.” The father, that is, models for readers “right” use of the sayings.
At 10:1, however, the literary landscape changes dramatically. No longer is
the father in evident control of the discourse, nor is personiﬁed wisdom on
center stage. No longer do proverbs appear hand-in-glove with longer instruc-
tions that inform their meaning. No longer is the reader even directly addressed
(until 14:7). Instead, sayings follow one after the other, in no apparent order of
priority and often without ready connection to those around them. Although
scholars identify exceptions to this, namely, formal and thematic arrangements
that connect adjacent proverbs,20 many of the proverbs are like polished bits or
shapes placed, without being changed, next to others also unmodiﬁed.
On the heels of the didactic poems of Proverbs 1–9, this seemingly indis-
criminate arrangement is disorienting and abruptly shifts responsibility for
making sense of proverbs from the father to the readers—those with whom,
given the book’s aim to form wise people, responsibility must ultimately re-
side.21 Moreover, the arrangement itself initiates a process of contemplation
and criticism,22 inviting readers who have been instructed by the father in

chaps. 1–9 to participate now in “wisdom-making” themselves. The apparent
lack of prioritization among the sayings compels readers to test each one, con-
sidering which seem fallacious and which valid. Ironically, the fact that the
proverbs are for the most part “disconnected” from their literary and oral con-
texts sharpens the signiﬁcance and effects of context itself.23 So-called “decon-
textualized” proverbs24 require readers to imagine appropriate contexts from
their own experience in which the proverbs would be applicable. To this ex-
tent, Gerhard von Rad observed, “the single line [a proverb comprising two
parallel sections] often enough makes higher claims and demands a greater de-
gree of intentional participation than a developed didactic poem.”25
Borrowing a metaphor from James Boyd White,26 we may say that Proverbs
10–30 reads like a literary mosaic: a text formed by small pieces of variously
colored proverbs, each a polished entity unto itself, placed next to other equally
polished and vibrant sayings. Viewed up close, where interpreters have long po-
sitioned themselves, the eye focuses on each proverb, then on those immediately
around it, noting ways the colors interact with or are distinct from one another.
From a step or two back, however, the bits of polished color blur together into
something beyond what any of the pieces, standing alone, resembles—the
“overarching pedagogical movement” that Brown suggests. We might say, then,
that the proverbs generate “patterns of experience” that, as much as their con-
tent, instruct readers in the ways of wisdom.27 I turn now to the two features
of this mosaic to be analyzed here—namely, repetition and contradiction.
II. Repetition
Repetition abounds in Proverbs.28 The structure of the book is itself repeti-
tive: three collections of sayings are attributed to Solomon (hmlv ylvm, 1:1–
23. Ibid., 41.
24. Drawing on folklore studies, C. R. Fontaine notes: “the saying which exists in a col-
lection or by itself without a context of use has a discrete nucleus located in its topic and
comments. This is the context-free kernel (Baukern) . . . this core is the carrier of the mes-
sage, however mundane or profound” (Traditional Sayings in the Old Testament [BLS 5; Shef-
ﬁeld: Almond, 1982] 165). Indeed, the lack of “context” for proverbs in a collection
prompted renowned paroemiologist W. Meider to declare that “the proverb in a collection
is dead” (“The Essence of Literary Proverb Study,” Proverbium 23 [1974] 892). See also

9:18, 10:1–22:16, 25:1–29:27), and two are ‘the words of the wise’ (yrbd
µymkj, 22:17–24:22, 24:23–34). At the level of individual proverbs, the level
of concern here, various manifestations of verbatim and nearly verbatim repe-
tition of content appear, from whole two-line sayings and cola to syntactically
similar sayings and double-verb forms. Moreover, these repetitions are found
between and within the main subunits of the book. In his catalog of “twice-
told” proverbs, for instance, Snell identiﬁes 6 two-line sayings that repeat with
only minor variations in spelling,29 5 two-line sayings and one quatrain that re-
peat with merely one dissimilar word,30 11 two-line sayings that repeat with
two dissimilar words,31 and so on. With regard to repeated cola, he ﬁnds that 16
recur with minor spelling variations,32 20 with only one dissimilar word,33 and
22 with two dissimilar words.34 Finally, at the micro-structural level, the sages
frequently employ alliteration, assonance, anaphora, refrains, and inclusios.35
Given the extent of the repetition in Proverbs and, as recent interpreters ar-
gue, the likelihood of a selective ﬁnal redaction of the book,36 it makes little
29. Namely, 9:4 and 16; 14:12 and 16:25; 18:8 and 26:22; 20:16 and 27:13; 21:9 and
25:24; 22:3 and 27:12 (Snell, Twice-Told Proverbs, 35).
30. Namely, 2:1 and 7:1; 2:16 and 7:5; 5:7 and 7:24; 19:5 and 9; 23:18 and 24:14b;
6:10–11 and 24:33–34 (ibid., 36).
31. Namely, 1:8 and 6:20; 1:25 and 30; 2:2 and 5:1; 3:2 and 9:11; 4:20 and 5:1; 10:1 and
15:20; 11:1 and 20:23; 12:11 and 28:19; 13:14 and 14:27; 19:1 and 28:6; 19:24 and 26:15
(ibid., 37–38).
32. See, for example, 4:4b and 7:2a; 5:7a, 7:24a, and 8:32a; 6:15b and 29:1b (ibid., 42–44).
33. See, for example, 1:9a and 4:9b; 3:21a and 4:21a; 3:31a and 24:1a (ibid., 44–48).
34. See, for example, 1:7a and 9:10a; 1:8a and 4:1a; 3:7b and 16:6b (ibid., 48–52).
35. Verbatim and nearly verbatim repetition occurs in other ancient Near Eastern wis-
dom texts, though to a notably lesser extent. See, for example, the Egyptian Instruction of
Amenemope (e.g., IX 7–8 and XVI 13–14; XI 13–14 and XV 13–14 [AEL 2:147–63]); the
Instruction of Ankhsheshonq (“a man’s character is his family” in 11:11, 18:13; cf. 21:25 [AEL
3:159–84]); Instruction of Papyrus Insinger (e.g., variations on the refrain “the fate and fortune
that come, it is the god who determines/sends them” conclude nearly every instruction
[AEL 3:184–217]); and the Babylonian Counsels of Wisdom (“in your wisdom, study the
tablet” in lines 142, 154, 159 [BWL 105–6]).
36. So M. V. Fox: “The diversity comes from the varied sources, the unity (of the book)
from the redactors’ individual creativity. The redactors’ intervention was radical and deter-
minative, going far beyond just attaching ‘later additions’ to existing proverbs. They did
collect sayings and add some of their own, but, most important, they selected. They chose
plot. Moreover, I am concerned only with repetition within Proverbs; that is, I restrict the
locality of this analysis to the book itself. Further study is needed about how sayings from
the book are “repeated” in other biblical and nonbiblical texts and/or oral contexts. For a
helpful discussion regarding the complexities of deﬁning repetition, see B. Johnstone et al.,
“Repetition in Discourse: A Dialogue,” in Repetition in Discourse: Interdisciplinary Perspectives
(2 vols.; Advances in Discourse Processes 47–48; Norwood, N.J.: Ablex, 1994) 1:1–20.

sense to attribute repetition merely to editorial sloppiness or oral transmission.
Commenting on repetition in biblical texts generally, Meir Sternberg writes:
Since the literary text is characterized by rigorous selection and arrangement . . .
the dismissal of its redundancies in terms of “noise” is the reader’s last rather
than ﬁrst resort. After all, the general presumption of coherence applies to
redundancy no less than to any other literary feature, dissonance, or incongruity.
. . . The chances therefore are that this redundancy, too, is deliberate and func-
tional—in fact, no redundancy at all. The text has devised a redundancy on
some level with an eye toward a deﬁnite effect; that is, in order to impel the
reader to transfer it to another level (pattern, context, framework) where it will
duly fall into place.37
Wondering about this effect in Proverbs is particularly important given the
book’s aim to teach and, to that end, its use of such didactic techniques as in-
direction, analogy, and motivational clauses.38 Despite fairly widespread and
longstanding distaste for repetition,39 repetition is a helpful device, particularly
in suasive speech.40 In oral and written discourses alike, repetition has long been
recognized as an effective means to clarify, emphasize, and recapitulate; more-
over, its connection with memory makes it of particular didactic value.41

39. As J. P. Fokkelman describes: “Many [modern readers] make our ﬁrst tentative for-
ays into the ﬁeld of serious writing in high school, when we have to write an essay, and are
immediately criticized for using the same words too frequently. . . . We often leave school
with the impression that repetition is something to be avoided at all costs” (Reading Biblical
Narrative: An Introductory Guide [trans. I. Smit; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1999]
112). This negative regard for repetition is certainly not new; consider, for example, the fol-
lowing in the Complaints of Khakneperre-sonb, an Egyptian text that dates to the Middle
Kingdom: “Had I unknown phrases, / Sayings that are strange, / Novel, untried words, /
Free of repetition; / Not transmitted sayings, / Spoken by the ancestors! (AEL 1:146).

So what pedagogical effects does repetition have in Proverbs? Although
ideally we would consider every instance of repetition in the book on its own
terms (a task beyond the scope of this essay), I suggest the following as a start.
An important clue emerges when we compare the content of the repetition
in chaps. 1–9 with the content in chaps. 10–30. The preponderance of what
is repeated (whole sayings and half-verses, verbatim and nearly verbatim) in
Proverbs 1–9 is exordia, speciﬁcally the father’s appeals for disciplined atten-
tion and obedience. Repetition thus serves principally as a means to “interpel-
late” readers, that is, to call on them again and again to take up a particular
subject position,42 speciﬁcally that of a silent, receptive son in relation to an
authoritative father. For example, the father repeats these exordia with only
minor variation:43
Listen [Keep], my son, to your father’s instruction [command],
and do not neglect your mother’s teaching. (1:8, 6:20)
Listen, my son [sons], to your [a] father’s instruction. (1:8a, 4:1a)
My son, if you accept [keep] my words,
and treasure up my commands within you. (2:1, 7:1)
[My son,] making your ear attend [attend] to [my] wisdom,
inclining [incline] your heart [ear] to [my] understanding. (2:2, 5:1)
So now, my sons, listen to me,44
do not depart from [give heed to] the words of my mouth. (5:7, 7:24).
Bind them (i.e., my teachings) on your throat [ﬁngers];
inscribe them on the tablet of your heart. (3:3bc, 7:3)
Keep my commands and live. (4:4c, 7:2a)
My son [
], do not let them (i.e., my words) escape your eyes. (3:21a, 4:21a)
42. Newsom, “Woman and the Discourse of Patriarchal Wisdom,” 86. Newsom bor-
rows the term “interpellation” from Louis Althusser (Lenin and Philosophy [trans. B. Brew-
ster; London: Monthly Review, 1971] 174–75), who “speaks of the way in which ideology
‘recruits’ subjects, ‘hails’ them as a policeman might: ‘Hey, you there!’ The individual rec-
ognizing himself or herself as the one addressed, turns around in response to the hailing.
And with that gesture he or she becomes a subject, takes up a particular subject position in
a particular ideology.”
43. The brackets indicate in what ways, if any, the second speciﬁed text varies from the
word or phrase underlined.
44. That personiﬁed wisdom issues the same summons in 8:32a is one of several indica-
tors that Proverbs 1–9 presents a uniﬁed pedagogical “front”: as the father describes it, his
teachings are inextricably associated with those of personiﬁed wisdom and God—so much
so that, in places such as 8:32a, the ﬁgures themselves resemble each other (see 3:11–12).

Christine Roy Yoder
176
Repetition of particular verbs (for example, listen, hear, keep, bind, attend, do not
depart) and direct objects (for example, discipline, commandment, teaching, my
words), coupled with the use of second-person address and frequent impera-
tives, suggests that Proverbs 1–9 aims to foster in readers the very discipline,
receptivity, and obedience to (parental) instruction that the book presumes
necessary for attaining wisdom (see, for example, 2:1–4). Each repeated ex-
ordium ushers readers another step up “on a scale of intensity, the note of des-
perate urgency pitched slightly higher,”45 so that refusing the desired subject
position becomes progressively more difﬁcult. Moreover, the text underscores
the idea that attaining wisdom is a matter of survival—three times readers are
told that wisdom saves a person from the strange woman with her “smooth
words” (2:16, 6:24, 7:5) and three times that wisdom brings long life (3:2,
4:10b, 9:11). The rhetorical effect of this “heaping up” of exordia and moti-
vation clauses is that, by chap. 9, readers still engaging the text46 have so inter-
nalized the (parental) instruction that they may serve as teachers in their own
right (see 9:7–9) and may choose wisely when personiﬁed wisdom and folly
issue verbatim invitations from the highest places in town (“Let you who are
simple come over here,” 9:4, 16). In sum, repetition in chaps. 1–9 functions
largely to form the readers’ subjectivity, to interpellate readers into a particular
way of seeking wisdom.
This focus on what is repeated disappears beginning with 10:1. Even a cur-
sory look through Snell’s catalog of “twice-told” proverbs indicates that what
the sages reiterate in chaps. 10–30 is comparatively arbitrary; with some ex-
ceptions, there are no apparent thematic or structural indications for the repe-
tition of certain sayings or cola and not others. One effect of this seemingly
indiscriminate use of repetition is heightened awareness of the relativity and
malleability of proverbs.
Closer examination of sayings repeated verbatim, for example, reveals that
word-for-word repetition cannot be equated with identity of meaning(s).
What Meir Sternberg argues with regard to repetition in narrative also applies
here: “every new use entails deviant use, every repetition a variation. For the
original is rooted in its native ground—tone, genre, situation—so that even to
reiterate it word for word is to uproot and transplant it.”47 That is, variations

46. As Kawin points out, it is possible that readers will “turn off” the exordia, that is, set
Proverbs aside. Kawin writes: “repetition . . . makes intense and solid through persistence. Re-
peated enough, a word or idea or phrase or image or name will come to dominate us to such
an extent that our only defenses are to concede its importance or turn off the stimulus com-
pletely” (Telling It Again and Again, 49–50, emphasis his). See also Strawn, “Keep/Observe/
Do,” 222, 229.

in literary contexts, among other things, inform readers’ experiences of a prov-
erb. So, for example, we ﬁrst encounter the saying “the words of a gossiper
[literally, ‘whisperer’] are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner
parts of the body” (18:8) after a pair of proverbs about the trouble that fools
get themselves into by talking (18:6–7). The emphasis on speech in the imme-
diate context draws readers’ attention to the words of whisperers (18:8)—how,
like junk food, they taste delicious but are harmful when swallowed.48 When
the sages repeat the same proverb later (26:22), however, it is nestled between
proverbs that reﬂect on the power of words to spark conﬂict (26:20–21) and
on the deceptive cruelty that the gossiper harbors (26:23–26). The context
invites readers to reconsider the proverb in light of the gossiper’s malicious
disposition.49
In turn, sayings and cola repeated nearly verbatim highlight the adaptability
of proverbs themselves, how they are “subject to reexamination and compli-
cation, to a further process of thought.”50 Repetition makes apparent the fact
that proverbs are not ﬁxed units of a stable theoretical system but are inher-
ently tentative, structurally ﬂexible, and prone to revision. Consider the fol-
lowing examples:
(1)
Prov 19:5 and 19:9
A false witness will not go unpunished,
and a liar will not escape (flmy al, 19:5).
A false witness will not go unpunished,
and a liar will perish (dbay, 19:9).
(2)
Prov 10:1bc and 15:20
A wise son gives joy to a father,
and a foolish son, grief (tgwt) to his mother (10:1bc).
A wise son gives joy to a father,
but a fool of a man despises (hzwb µda) his mother (15:20).
(3)
Prov 12:11 and 28:19
Whoever works his land will have enough food,
but whoever pursues empty goals lacks sense (blArsj, 12:11).
Whoever works his land will have enough food,
but whoever pursues empty goals will have plenty of poverty
(vyr [bcy, 28:19).

By repetition (verbatim and nearly verbatim), Proverbs teaches that wisdom—
at least as represented by the book itself—cannot be reduced to a repository
of static propositions but is continually being recreated by the sages and, ulti-
mately, by readers.51
Finally, experience of the book’s repetitive rhetoric teaches readers some-
thing about what it is to be human—namely, that we are incapable of holding
on steadily to what we know. Seemingly inexorable is the human capacity to
forget even the most signiﬁcant of lessons. White argues that a climactic scene
in Book Ten of Homer’s Iliad teaches readers the same lesson. There, on a
corpse-strewn battleﬁeld, a passionate appeal by Patroclus on behalf of the
Achaeans so strongly evokes the reader’s sympathies that she (momentarily)
forgets what she learned at the poem’s beginning about the equal humanity of
those who die—Achaean and Trojan alike. White then writes: “we learn
something in the early books, we forget it, and learn it again; and this time we
learn something else as well, about our own susceptibility to circumstance, our
own incapacity to keep solidly to what we know.”52
So, too, repetition in Proverbs reminds us that human learning is inescap-
ably repetitious: we learn, forget, and relearn. We are “subject to repeated
fallings-off from what we have once partly known (and in some sense still
know) into a seemingly unnecessary, almost willful, ignorance.”53 This steady
erosion of our knowledge means that we must discover or be told what we
“know” again and again. It may be said that, in this sense, readers become the
subject of Proverbs, and the process of life about which we are taught is the
continual reconstitution of knowledge and self.54 By reminding us of the hu-
man disposition to forget, the sages underline our lifelong need for wisdom
and pedagogy of the sort that Proverbs offers to us.
The experience of repetition thus reinforces what the book’s content
teaches about the human need for lifelong education. The prologue, for in-
stance, summons the naïve, the young, the wise, and the discerning to pay at-
tention, signaling up front that the quest for wisdom is a continual endeavor
(1:2–7). In 8:4, personiﬁed wisdom takes her stand in the city streets and sum-
mons everyone (µdaAynb) to listen to her. Throughout the book, the sages de-
scribe seekers of wisdom as lovers of discipline (for example, 12:1, 13:1),
always receptive to advice, reproof, and instruction (for example, 9:9; 12:15;
19:20, 25b; 21:11b). They also caution repeatedly about our capacity for bad
judgment (for example, 14:12, 16:25) and our tendency to put too much

stock in our own ingenuity: “do not rely on your own insight . . . do not be
wise in your own eyes” (3:5b, 7a; compare 28:26).55 Indeed, as the sages tell
it, only fools hate knowledge (for example, 1:22) and rely, to their detriment,
on their wits instead (28:26).
III. Contradiction
I turn now to contradiction56 as a pedagogical technique in Proverbs. As
noted above, arguably the best-known instance is Prov 26:4–5:
Do not answer a fool according to his folly (wtlwak lysk ˆ[tAla),
or you will be a fool yourself.
Answer a fool according to his folly (wtlwak lysk hn[),
or he will be wise in his own eyes.57
More typical are incongruous proverbs scattered throughout the book, inviting
readers into a sort of disputational dialogue. Compare, for example, proverbs
concerned with wealth and poverty. Some speak of wealth as an unqualiﬁed
good (for example, 10:15, 22; 14:20; 22:4, 7), others as a liability (see 11:4,
28); some attribute poverty to laziness (for example, 6:10–11//24:33–34, 10:4,
12:24, 20:13), others to violence, extortion, and deceit (see 1:10–19; 11:1, 16;
13:23; 21:6). Similarly, consider the sayings that describe a wife as an unquali-
ﬁed good (so 18:22, 5:15–20) with those that indicate otherwise (21:9, 19;
27:15). Insofar as Proverbs preserves such divergent points of view, it ensures
a certain ambiguity: wisdom does not afford only one perspective on wealth or
poverty, wives, or, for that matter, most anything. Interpreters acknowledge
the didactic signiﬁcance of this, but few elaborate.58
55. Other ancient Near Eastern wisdom texts similarly emphasize the ongoing nature of
human learning. The Egyptian Instruction of Ankhsheshonq, for instance, teaches: “a wise
master who asks advice, his house stands forever” (AEL 3:168), and the Instruction of Ptah-
hotep cautions: “Do not be proud of your knowledge, consult the ignorant and the wise.
The limits of art are not reached; no artist’s skills are perfect” (AEL 1:63).
56. Contradictions are understood here broadly as logical inconsistencies (for example,
two propositions related to each other in such a way that if one is true then the other is
false) and “unresolved tensions between incongruous and incompatible observations” (see
M. V. Fox, A Time to Tear Down and A Time to Build Up: A Rereading of Ecclesiastes [Grand
Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999] 3).
57. While I recognize that it remains a matter of some debate whether or not Prov
26:4–5 contains contradictory proverbs, I maintain that, for most readers, the two sayings
appear contrary and, therefore, require explanation as such (for the same argument regard-
ing contradictions in Ecclesiastes, see ibid., 14).
58. Exceptions are Melchert, Wise Teaching, 54–56; and Van Leeuwen, “Proverbs,” 23.

So what might incongruities across the book of Proverbs teach readers?
First, they call attention to incongruities in the world; they convey that the
arena of wisdom is replete with competing discourses, with divergent per-
spectives on reality and morality (note the proverb “the one who ﬁrst states a
case seems right, until the other comes and cross examines him,” 18:17).
While some of the contradictory sayings may represent perspectives of the dif-
ferent social groups who collected, augmented, and edited the book along the
way, the idea that the world is full of contradiction is also a theme of the book.
In Proverbs 1–9, for example, the father seeks to establish his discourse over
against competing discourses—different (moral) “languages” (such as those of
the sinners [1:10–19]; the wicked [2:12–15]; the strange woman [7:14–20])—
each of which vies with the others over what it means to live wisely and well.
As Carol Newsom notes, readers ﬁnd themselves “hailed from many direc-
tions, offered subject positions in discourses that construe the world very dif-
ferently”59—all under the watchful eye of the father, who “quotes” or gives
voice to the rival characters and disparages their points of view. The father
aims to teach readers to recognize and resist the opposing discourses (some of
which the father acknowledges are quite compelling, for example, 1:10, 7:21)
lest those discourses inform the readers’ development.
After 10:1, the battle of perspectives and words continues but without the
father’s heavy interpretive hand. Warnings about rival discourses abound (for
example, 10:14, 32; 11:9; 12:5–6), even as the sages make the situation more
complex with divergent proverbs side by side, or nearly so, without reﬂection.
In short, what readers experience as a world of incongruities between the wise
and the foolish (//wicked) in chaps. 1–9 broadens to include tensions between
the proverbs themselves. Suddenly, the moral world looks more complicated.
Moreover, whereas the father in chaps. 1–9 presents a uniﬁed pedagogical
“front”—by associating his teaching with that of Solomon, whose renowned
wisdom bears the stamp of royal ofﬁce and is the voice of the state (1:1); per-
soniﬁed wisdom, who speaks with communal and transcendent authority
(1:20–21, 8:22–31); and God (for example, 3:1–4, 11–12; 6:20–23)—read-
ers of Proverbs 10–30 ﬁnd themselves responsible for navigating this “strange
new world” riddled with conﬂict on their own, informed by what they
learned in chaps. 1–9. Contradiction between proverbs renders palpable and
unavoidable the complexity and ambiguity of the world. 
Ironically, the contradictions may, in fact, also facilitate the book’s appeal to
everyone (see 1:2–6, 8:4). In his analysis of contradictions in the law codes of
the Hebrew Bible, J. W. Watts explains:
59. Newsom, “Woman and the Discourse of Patriarchal Wisdom,” 88.

Forming “Fearers of Yahweh”
181
Politicians regularly address multiple, and frequently opposed, audiences. Court
decisions usually address individuals or social groups in conﬂict with each other.
Analyses of these modern texts point out that . . . the separate treatment of the
concerns of each audience can be effective in gaining their acceptance even
when other parts of the speech may offend them.60
Analogously, while the sages’ inclusion of incongruous proverbs—some of
which may have emerged from divergent social groups61—renders Proverbs
self-contradictory, it simultaneously makes the book more persuasive to more
people. Inclusive of varying points of view, self-contradiction as pedagogical
strategy makes it more likely that Proverbs can lead “all who live” (8:4) in the
ways of wisdom. The book may succeed, at least in part, because it contradicts
itself.
Second, contradictory proverbs teach something about the nature of the
mature moral self. The series of countering appeals woven into Proverbs, none
of which is discounted or trivialized, asks readers to adopt inconsistent points
of view simultaneously, to experience statement and counterstatement at the
same moment (for example, 26:4–5).62 The sages thereby put readers in a po-
sition where no single response, no one proverb or perspective, can always
work for them.63 By doing so, they point readers to a reality larger than the
proverbs in question: the moral self inevitably holds views that are in conﬂict
with one another and applies those views depending on the immediate cir-
cumstances. Readers cannot avoid the relativity of human knowledge—the
fact that meaning is contextual.64 Indeed, the availability of contradictory
proverbs enables them to more readily “accommodate the many ﬁne distinc-
tions and qualiﬁcations to which each particular life situation is subject.”65
The experience of divergence thus reinforces what the content of Proverbs
elsewhere makes clear about the situational nature of wisdom. Indeed, as vari-
ous proverbs emphasize, being wise requires perceptiveness and good timing:

Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 1999) 81.

place need not be the same as his response elsewhere. And even a single response may be
compounded by various attitudes or remain resolutely unstable” (A Time to Tear Down, 3–4).

“Apples of gold in a setting of silver, such is a word spoken at the right time”
(25:11), and “A gold ring, an ornament of gold is a wise person’s rebuke to a
listening ear” (25:12). Conversely, the foolish notoriously misread their cir-
cumstances and misspeak (for example, 26:7, 9).
Finally, contemplation of contradictory proverbs may teach the moderation
of impulses, a lesson esteemed by Proverbs (for example, 14:29, 15:27, 19:2,
23:19–21). Speech communication specialists Paul Goodwin and Joseph Wen-
zel argue that what often emerges from a clash of contradictory statements is a
sensible “middle way.” 66 This seems to be the strategy at work, they note, in
West Africa, when a Yoruban father invokes a proverb to justify disciplining a
child harshly, only to be countered immediately by the mother, who quotes a
proverb on tempering discipline with love.67 Or when in African judicial pro-
ceedings, prosecutors and defendants recite proverbs to bolster their arguments,
much as European or American lawyers cite legal precedents.68 Although con-
tradictions, at ﬁrst glance, suggest inconsistency, Goodwin and Wenzel con-
clude, “they may be found to achieve consistency at a higher level . . . they
constitute a unique kind of solution to conﬂicting human tendencies.”69 Said
differently, perhaps if we know both “look before you leap” and “he who hes-
itates is lost,” we will hesitate just long enough to look.70
IV. Conclusion
So how do repetition and contradiction contribute to the book of Proverbs’
goal to teach wisdom? Viewed up close, repetition in Proverbs 1–9 serves
principally to form the reader’s subjectivity as a seeker of wisdom while the
father introduces and mediates a world replete with contradictory discourses.
After the pedagogical shift at 10:1, repetition and contradiction in chaps. 10–
30 generate “patterns of experience” that (just as much as certain content in
the book) instruct readers about the relativity of human wisdom and the
66. P. Goodwin and J. W. Wenzel, “Proverbs and Practical Reasoning: A Study in
Socio-Logic,” in The Wisdom of Many: Essays on the Proverb (ed. W. Mieder and A. Dundes;

70. Similarly, contrasting contemporary proverbs include “you are never too old to
learn” and “you cannot teach an old dog new tricks”; “out of sight, out of mind” and “ab-
sence makes the heart grow fonder”; “the more the merrier” and “too many cooks spoil
the broth”; “nothing ventured, nothing gained” and “better safe than sorry”; and “haste
makes waste” and “strike while the iron is hot” (Kirschenblatt-Gimblett, “Toward a The-
ory,” 823).

183
world “at odds.” Proverbs thus forms readers through its content and its ar-
rangement, making palpable and unavoidable the limits of human knowledge,
our dependence on and accountability to context, and our need for lifelong
education.
These lessons, I contend, in the end inspire humility in readers, a hallmark
of those who “fear Yahweh.” To teach wisdom, that is, to form “fearers of the
Lord”—persons who recognize God’s sovereignty and the place of humanity
(our potential and limitations) in relation to God—is the aim of Proverbs (see
1:7, the book’s “motto”). Indeed, the idiom “the fear of Yahweh” is itself re-
peated 12 times in the book (1:7; 2:5; 8:13; 9:10; 10:27; 14:26–27; 15:16, 33;
16:6; 19:23; 22:4; 23:17) and the imperative “fear the Lord!” three times
(3:7, 14:2, 24:21). The phrase also forms an inclusio around chaps. 1–9 (1:7,
9:10) and Proverbs as a whole (1:7, 31:3071). For the sages, “fear of Yahweh”
is the quintessential expression of what it means to be wise; it is the beginning
and end, the best and fullest expression of wisdom (1:7).72 And intrinsic to
“fear of Yahweh” is abiding humility: humility that comes from knowing
one’s capacities and limitations as a creature of God (so 15:33, 18:22, 22:4).
Repetition and contradiction in Proverbs engender just such humility. In the
end, it seems, these brightly colored proverbs (each a polished entity unto it-
self ) blur into something quite spectacular after all.
71. Reading MT hyhyAtary substantively (compare with Prov 1:7, 9:10, 15:33) and in
apposition to hva (“a woman, fear of Yahweh”). MT ta"r]yi is vocalized as the feminine
construct of ha:r]yi, not as the feminine adjective suggested by the typical translation “a
woman who fears Yahweh” (for example, the nrsv, niv). One would expect the feminine
adjective to be ta"rey] or tarey] (see, for example, T. P. McCreesh, “Wisdom as Wife: Proverbs
31:10–31,” RB 92 [1985] 28–29 n. 11).
72. According to the sages, “fear of the Lord” is the tyvar of knowledge (1:7a; cf.
9:10a). The term tyvar has a range of possible meanings. It may be interpreted temporally
as “beginning or starting point” (cf. Gen 10:10, Jer 26:1), suggesting that “the fear of the
Lord” is the prerequisite, the foundation for knowledge. It may also be read qualitatively,
as “ﬁrst, best, or epitome” (Amos 6:6, Jer 2:3, Ezek 48:14). Either way (and the ambiguity
may well be intentional), there is no wisdom without it.

Some Archaeological Reﬂections 
on Gendered Iconography
Carole R. Fontaine
Andover Newton Theological School
It is with great pleasure that I present this essay in celebration of the excep-
tional scholarship of Prof. Michael V. Fox. His work in Egyptology, wisdom
literature, and lyric poetry has been an ongoing inspiration in my own studies
since the early days of my graduate education. Prof. Fox’s work provides com-
mentary and analysis of ﬁne philological and theological acumen, and he has
been particularly attentive to aspects of female imagery, even in his earliest
works. In this essay I attempt, in some small way, to add an art historical and
gender archaeological perspective to his skillful textual exegesis of a particular
metaphor in biblical love and wisdom poetry: the woman whose body (sexu-
ality?) is a well/cistern or a fountain (Prov 5:15, 16, 18; Song 4:12b, 15). Us-
ing methodologies developed from representation theory,1 I hope to show
that the biblical metaphor of the “woman-well” can be found rendered in clay
and stone in a variety of contexts, providing a frame of reference for many of
the same variations in meaning that can be found in the biblical text.
It should be noted at the outset that studies of the physical representation
of sexuality in ancient art are still in their methodological adolescence. This is
reﬂected even in the level of basic terminology. No longer do analysts consider
a representation of sexual activity to be an unambiguous reﬂection of real
practice, nor is this sort of representation necessarily considered erotic in func-
tion (that is, designed to arouse). Instead, with recognition of the cultural con-
struction of sexuality (gendered practice) based on biological difference (the
anatomical “givens” of the sexes, a concept itself under revision), the ter-
minology “sexuality” has come to mean both more and less than it did in the

bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996).

nineteenth and early-to-mid-twentieth-century studies. Sexuality is no longer
considered an indelible category of dualisms (male/female;2 active/inactive;
procreative/recreational; heterosexual/homosexual; natural/unnatural) but in-
stead a sliding scale of behaviors taught and inscribed by culture on the bodies
of its members. Further, in such an interpretive framework, issues of sexual
identity may not always coincide with actual sexual practice or the repre-
sentations of sexuality found in the culture in question.3 In other words, the
whole concept of gender, the cultural meanings assigned to a range of biolog-
ical differences and behaviors, is alive and well in art history, cognitive or sym-
bolic archaeology, and representation studies.
The beneﬁt of using studies of this sort to understand biblical imagery for
sexuality and gender better comes from a key feminist insight in gender ar-
chaeology: gender is a process, a cultural performance, and not a given.4 Open-
ness to this dynamic will help us understand our texts and their implications
better. Hence, this analytical category of gender-as-process must be brought
to bear on materials available from the ancient world of the Bible and its
neighbors, as well as the biblical materials themselves.
Another methodological point is critical to our interpretation of what might
also be called “visual theology.” Visual theology is the deliberate expression of
theological and social meanings via artistic media, as opposed to arts that in
modern culture might be considered merely decorative embellishments. When
image becomes a motif or archetype, it subsequently may ﬁnd verbal expres-
sion in later or contemporaneous texts. The notion that anepigraphic evidence
of material culture from the ancient world has much to tell us (contra the
views of the so-called Minimalist or Copenhagen school of biblical interpreta-
tion) is key here, but such materials seldom function as straightforward “his-
torical” proof of much of anything—except, perhaps, the unconscious biases

of the excavators and interpreters.5 Some archaeologists prefer to speak of con-
vergences between texts and artifacts. This is a more-nuanced position that
moves the excavator and interpreter away from simplistic models of biblical
archaeology that seek to determine or prove the Bible’s historical or theological
claims.6
I believe it is quite fair to speak of convergences between text and contex-
tual artifact, whether it is in terms of social and ideological function or arche-
typal representation, even in cases in which the relationship between text and
artifact must remain conceptual because no direct inﬂuence or sequencing can
be adduced. I choose to take this approach with the Woman-Well metaphor
and correlative images in ancient Near Eastern art. A congruence between
wisdom literature’s and the Song of Song’s images, metaphors, form, and con-
tent with the international world of the ancient scribes, bureaucrats, and arti-
sans has been afﬁrmed repeatedly in scholarly discourse.7 One might cite the
convergence between the sages’ vision of Yahweh as “weighing the heart” to
requite one’s deeds in Prov 21:2 and 24:12 and its clear connection to the vi-
gnette in chap. 125 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, where the heart is
weighed on a balance against Maºat, the goddess who symbolizes justice and
right action. Similarly, the image of Wisdom herself as engaging in Hathor-
like acrobatics of pleasurable cultic frolicking before the high god is portrayed
in Prov 8:30–31.8 Examples such as these demonstrate that there is much in

the biblical text that may be fruitfully illumined by close attention to ancient
artistic traditions of the cultures that produced both texts and artifacts. Meso-
potamian narrative traditions are clearly in evidence as sources known to and
reworked by the biblical authors and editors. If a culture can borrow the sto-
ries of another region, then we might reasonably posit a similar borrowing of
motifs from the world of the arts and representation, especially where exten-
sive trade networks between the two regions can be established with a fair
degree of certitude.9 A salient question about these connections arises from
perusal of the narrative and artistic evidence of “borrowing”: what causes one
motif to be used by a local Levantine craftsperson or artist and others to be
excluded deliberately from reproduction or to be drastically altered in their
new context? Ecology, ideology, and theology come to mind as potential
sources for this variation.
As is often the case, time and chance affect the materials that survive and
are available to scholars for study; in Mesopotamia and Egypt we can often es-
tablish a better sequence of artistic images as they mutate through time and so-
cial changes. We will take up our questions in relation to the relevant materials
from ancient Sumer to the kingdoms that followed it in the period of state-
formation, before comparing them with the material and social contexts of
texts from the Levant.
The artifact under consideration is a single-handled jug, one of many of the
so-called “mother-goddess type” associated with late Early Dynastic IIIA–
early IIIB pottery type “A.” It was found in Mound A of the cemetery carved
into the ruined ED IIIA palace complex at Kish, the ﬁrst city to receive “king-
ship” after the Great Flood, according to the Sumerian King List.10
Ancient Kish, mentioned in lists and inscriptions from Sumer and else-
where, has been identiﬁed with Tell Uhaimir in Iraq, lying about 12 km east
of Babylon and 14 km northeast of modern Hillah. A group of about 40
mounds, including the ziggurat named Uhaimir, extends approximately 8 km
(east–west) by 2.5 km (northeast) in an oval-shaped area. The whole area is
generally referred to as “Kish,” a city associated with the warrior deity Zababa
in Early Dynastic IIIA hymns, though it may be that some of the tells of in-
terest did not lie within the boundaries of the earliest city.11 In Protoliterate
and Early Dynastic times, this region of northern Mesopotamia was domi-
nated by three cities—Babylon, Kutha, and Kish—which, not coincidentally,

grew up along the three most hardy branches or channels of the Euphrates
River extending into the south.12 Water and its management were critical in
the political and economic fortunes of these cities and would have exerted
profound impact on the iconographic and artistic traditions of the site.
Sadly, early excavations of Kish Mound A, which concerns us here, and the
related temple mound of Tell Ingharra (known in the Early Dynastic period as
Hursakalama, a great temple complex dedicated to Ninhursag and later to Ish-
tar in the Neo-Babylonian period) were divided between several different ex-
cavators from Oxford and Chicago, who used different methodologies for
recording their ﬁeld notes. This has caused considerable confusion in handling
the collection of artifacts and inscriptions divided between the Iraq Museum,
Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum, and the University of Chicago Oriental Insti-
tute. Making sense of grave groups in terms of chronology and relationship to
pottery sequences often requires the researcher to consult the extremely cryp-
tic Field Note cards of excavator Mackay, and even then, it is not always pos-
sible to reconstruct the exact position of artifacts (both the numbering for
forms and the method of publication changed between seasons 1923 and
1925), though Mackay’s documentation is clearly superior to that of excavator
Watelin, who followed him. Later specialists trying to make sense of the full
sweep of the excavations lament our lack of a clear picture of the life of the
city and region, not from lack of ﬁnds, but because of “uniform inadequacy
of publication.”13 The confusion surrounding these excavations underscores
the serious difﬁculties encountered when one tries to provide a full prov-
enance, much less an interpretation, of even the artifacts that excavators con-
sidered to be the “most distinctive” ﬁnds of the cemetery.14
The scientiﬁc excavations of the 1920s found evidence of many “clandes-
tine” excavations, whose ﬁnds have been dispersed into private and university
collections (for example, Yale University) via the private antiquities market,
but the content of whose inscriptions make clear that the artifact in question
originated in Kish. Materials from the excavations show that the city was oc-
cupied from the late Protoliterate period well into the Sassanian period, when
the oldest areas of Kish and Hursagkalama were largely deserted. Re-cutting
of canals in the Samarran period caused a brief ﬂourish in the form of a small
wealthy city on the old site, giving way to a small and poor village settlement

during the Ottoman period. Surveys of canals and watercourses show that the
expansion and contraction of occupation in this general area, like so much of
Mesopotamia, was dependent on the fortunes, health, and upkeep of the ca-
nals and river channels.15
The so-called “mother-goddess” handled jars are the most ornate examples
of a type of jar that is found in almost every intact set of grave goods (Mackay’s
Pottery Type A; see ﬁg. 1). It was invariably accompanied by a low, round
stand (Type B), considered a brazier by Mackay but perhaps better understood
as a fruit stand, with Moorey.16 Type B stands have also been found at Ur,
Mari, Fara, and Susa from the Early Dynastic IIIA period into the early Akka-
dian period. The association of these stands with the mother-goddess handled
jars is illuminated by a stand of the same type B at Ur, which shows date palm
trees incised on the stand, along with the doorways of two shrines and two in-
cised triangles representing the female pudenda, or the munus/SAL sign, a
pictogram of the vulva, meaning “woman.”17 Early excavators, noting the two
ziggurats and temple of Hursagkalama at Tell Ingharra right next door, con-
cluded that the “goddess” modeled onto the most-ornate handles of the Type
A grave jars must be Aruru (Ninhursag) or Inanna-Ishtar. While this attribution
of the “mother-goddess” title certainly ﬁts for Aruru or Ninhursag, it is hard to
think of a goddess less motherly than Inanna-Ishtar, a female warrior ﬁlled with
erotic allure, a dangerous sex partner at best, and a demonic, spurned female at
worst. Further, the most imposing temple to Ishtar at Kish is clearly a Neo-
Babylonian building, though naturally it has earlier strata. Regardless of the
“mother” to whom these handles and fruit stands were dedicated, the items
themselves are dated to late Early Dynastic IIIB, and later excavation of Tell In-
gharra provided additional evidence for this dating. Given the lack of explicit
evidence to identify the female ﬁgure on the handles, who is neither pregnant
nor nursing, one can only conclude that, for some excavators, the mere pres-
ence of breasts was an indelible indication of motherhood, just as the simple ap-
pearance of a female ﬁgure in a world gendered as normatively male must
indicate her divinity.
Looking at our jar, we note a number of striking features. First, in all the
jars of this type, decoration is mostly conﬁned to the pronounced ledge shoul-

der of the jar and the single handle, some of which are hollow (perhaps origi-
nating from a more-typical “spout,” whose neck had been closed to form a
handle). In some cases the top of the handle does not meet and attach to the
high neck of the jar, but in all cases the bottom of the handle is attached with
considerable care to render it strong enough to aid in carrying something
heavy in the jar (at least once!), usually presumed to be water. The small neck
of the jars also suggests its use in holding and pouring. P. Delougaz has studied
the range of handle decoration development in conjunction with the pottery
forms of the Diyala region. The progression seems to have been from (1) short,
geometric decoration on handles in Early Dynastic II (usually two diagonal
lines crossing, creating two “open” triangles, mirroring the munus/SAL sign

visually); to (2) taller geometric handles, sometimes decorated with a vegetal
“sprig,” perhaps a palm leaf, rendered by incision (ED IIIA); to (3) anthropo-
morphic ﬁgures modeled onto the handles (ED IIIB).18 Decorations on the
shoulder rim are made by a comb implement, creating a series of incised chev-
rons, forming upward-pointing triangles around the jar. Many jars contain two
rows of triangle chevrons running around the shoulder; in some cases, similar
incised designs were also found around the base of the jar.19
Our example of the Pottery Type A jar (Mackay’s registration number
2133B, 1925 Season, 210)20 combines all the most striking features of the
type, and hence, helps us explicate an implied meaning for this ritually pre-
scribed item. Because of the longer time needed to make the decorated and
modeled jar, it is reasonable to assume that this version was more costly and
desirable and was used in elite graves. Not only is the shoulder of the jar in-
cised with triangles, but the body of the jar sports a munus/SAL triangle po-
sitioned so that it clearly continues the ﬁgure of the entity modeled on the
gynomorphic handle. Further, both breasts are present (markers of both fe-
male sex and female gender in ANE art) and are small but prominent.21 They
cannot be mistaken for anything other than breasts.22 A sprig of vegetation
rises from the “groin” area of the ﬁgure up between the breasts, emerging
from a pointed triangle above the rim, smaller in size than the munus/SAL tri-
angle marked beneath it on the jar’s body. This imagery is a forerunner of
what may be seen on so much of the jewelry from Syria–Palestine, the so-
called “Astarte” plaques (see ﬁg. 2). Like most of the other handled ﬁgures,
the jar’s face has modeled, appliquéd brow ridges, large oval eyes with slight
evidence of incised pupils but no inlays,23 a prominent but narrow nose, and
a relatively tiny mouth, indicated by modeled lips.

This is, without a doubt, a jar, probably for water, that has been “gendered”
as female. It incorporates markers of both biological sex and gendered culture
in the form of modeled breasts and the munus/SAL sign, which establishes a
metonymy between Woman and woman’s sex organs. This association comes
to stand for her whole “meaning” to the culture that understands females this
way, even though there are many times in an ordinary woman’s life when she
is acting neither as mother nor sexual partner. The jar’s inclusion as a promi-
nent and nonnegotiable element in any good high-end grave assembly and its
connection to the female-gendered “fruit stand” suggest not so much a god-
dess giving birth or nursing—that is, a “mother” goddess engaged in mother-
ing—as a female-as-earthen-partner and guarantor of fertility, the one whose
womb supplies the water that causes plants to grow.
In this case, our female does not merely hold the pot, an instrumentality for
the delivery of water to the arduously cut canals; she is the jar that holds its pre-
cious cargo, mirroring a woman whose womb is an implicit locus of blessing
and fecundity. The munus/SAL marker on the body of the pot leaves no

question about this identiﬁcation between woman-who-is-womb and woman-
who-is-jar. The sprig that runs from groin to neck between the breasts supports
the conclusion that this is a divine ﬁgure and perhaps suggests why this image
should appear on an item destined for use by the dead: is there hope here of
some new life symbolized by the sprig that grows from the vulva of the jar-
female? Yet this female has been “handled,” made instrumental, and buried for
the continuation of the human community, or so one must presume by this
very intentional rendering of the female form as a “container” of something
else. She is necessary but not as necessary as what she carries. Our jar cannot
speak its full meaning to us, so we cannot say whether its primary use was for
the living to bring water for lustration of the dead in the liminal zone of the
grave or whether it was a source of drink for the dead in the realm of shadows.
At any rate, it is nice to think that when the dead were laid in their grave they
did not go alone or unprovisioned!
As might be expected from Kish’s geographical placement, guarding the
way south to the rich city-states of Sumer24 and its mention as the ﬁrst city to
“make ﬁrm the lands” after the Flood—that is, exercise some sort of broader
regional power—Kish carried its cachet of power for centuries after its heyday
in the Early Dynastic period had come to a close. Perhaps because of the broad
region included within its boundaries, Kish developed a so-called “secular”
model for its rulership rather than the typical model of governmental power
developing out of a tightly controlled temple/religious center. This form of so-
cial organization may have offered far greater possibilities for the expansion of
civil power and territorial hegemony.25
Kish’s probable ﬁrst ruler after the Flood, Etana, whose myth is enshrined
in the glyptic arts, is said to have ﬂown up to heaven on a rescued eagle in or-
der to beg the “plant of birth” from Ishtar, providing a mythic origin for the
motif of a male ﬁgure mounted on an eagle in mid-air on seals. Although the
earliest rulers of Kish all seem to have had Semitic rather than Sumerian
names, by the time we see a king with a true Sumerian name, Enmebaragesi,
rulers felt obliged to add the title “king of Kish” to their portfolio if they
wished to highlight their role as regional rather than local ruler. In a Sumerian
legend, either Enmebaragesi or his son Aka is said to have been forced to sub-
mit to Gilgamesh of Uruk. Moorey posits that the expansionist tendencies of
Kish’s rulers in the Early Dynastic period lent a powerful symbolic vehicle to
kings of other prominent cities who wished to take up this aggressive program

of conquest. This validating “king of Kish” tradition continued until the time
of Naram-Sin, and well into the Neo-Babylonian period we ﬁnd the great
builder kings of many dynasties speaking proudly of their restorations at Kish
and Hursagkalama.26
For our study, perhaps the most interesting literary survival of a tradition
about or from Kish is the rather remarkable rulership of a woman, Ku-Baba (or
Ku-Bau), at the end of the Early Dynastic period, precisely the time period to
which our gynomorphic-handled jar is dated. Called a “woman of wine” in
the Sumerian King List, she was apparently a barmaid from the city of Akshak.
Given the association of Inanna-Ishtar with the tavern and the sweet (sexual?)
wine to be drunk there, as well as female ownership of taverns and involve-
ment with the process of brewery, we should not assume Ku-Baba to be some
sort of prostitute but a successful business woman with divine associations her-
self. We need only think of Siduri, the wise ale-wife who counseled Gilgamesh
on the meaning of life, to correct the impressions of “women of wine” left by
the Bible’s treatment of businesswomen such as Rahab of Jericho.27 Little more
is known of Ku-Baba than this brief resumé, but her name endured in later
omen texts, where it was associated with evil for the land as a result of sexual
identity “confusion”:28 “If an anomalous birth has both male and female geni-
tal organs, it is a case of the omen of Ku-Bau who ruled the land: the land of
the king will become waste.”29 Clearly, with Ku-Baba’s anomalous assumption
of the title lugal, a term reserved for males, we have moved into the realm of
ancient perceptions of gender and sex. While the rich burials of women rulers
and administrators (an index of their power and prestige) were not unknown
in the Early Dynastic period, women’s ongoing disappearance from public life
starting in the Akkadian period was underscored in the gender ideology of the
male elites. A baby whose gender was unclear and a woman ruler: these were
linked in the elite mind as a challenge and threat to the political hegemony of
the king, a point to which we will return later.

Our gynomorphic Sumerian jar is in many respects a more primal exemplar
of some of the ideas associated with the well-known motif of the “deity with
ﬂowing streams.” This widespread image showed a deity, sometimes holding a
small, handle-less pot (aryballos) from which two (or four, depending on how
one counts) wavy streams ﬂow, often ﬁlled with cavorting ﬁsh. In other ex-
amples, the ﬂowing streams emerged directly from the deity him- or herself.
Van Buren concludes that the original deity of the ﬂowing streams was Enki/
Ea, god of sweet waters and wisdom, and his image is sometimes replaced by
lesser deities, including goddesses with whom he was associated.30 This imag-
ery has often been connected to the important role of royal oversight of the
cutting, digging, and maintaining of the canal system that was so critical to
cultural development. The king “stands in” for the god, whose sweet waters
give ﬁsh, irrigation, trade, and communication; in this way, the godlike port-
folio of the king’s duties and essences is conveyed in visual form (repeatedly).
This in turn supports the ideology of a ranked and stratiﬁed society in which
neither gods nor elites actually wish to be the ones who do the punishing
work associated with irrigation! The king, in performing this duty, is power-
ful, effective, and godlike and might reasonably use this water association to
shore up his claims to godly powers in other realms as well.
One of the most striking manifestations of the deity with ﬂowing streams is
to be found in the OB period in the kingdom of Mari (see ﬁg. 3). Recalling
the limestone basin of Gudea of Lagash,31 which shows interlocking goddesses
in the sky (or perhaps clouds) with ﬂowing pots whose waters stream down to
earth, we ﬁnd this female form of the motif made concrete in a goddess who
has quite literally become the fountain. Found at the foot of stairs leading up to
dais in palace courtyard hall #64 (Plan III), the statue of an ornately dressed and
elegantly coiffed minor goddess holds an aryballos that ﬂows with streams, an
effect also emphasized in the long lines of her robe, which teem with ﬁsh. The
vase was connected to a pipe at the back of the statue which must once have
been linked to a water tank at a higher level.32 Here, the fountain-female
openly dispenses her blessings in the palace of the king of Mari, in the liminal
zone inhabited by those waiting to enter the king’s audience chamber. The
30. See E. Douglas Van Buren, The Flowing Vase and the God with Streams (Berlin: Hans
Schoetz, 1933) for a full analysis of the variants on this motif. Enki/Ea is often shown as a
hybrid ﬁgure whose male body ends in a ﬁsh tail. The rank of deities can easily be calcu-
lated by counting the number of horns on their crowns—the more, the better!

same motif is repeated in the famous “Inves-
titure of the King” wall painting found in
another palace courtyard #106 (Plan III).
This painting shows King Zimrilim before
Ishtar in the upper left register. Beneath that
scene, we ﬁnd two goddesses with ﬂowing
vases, ﬂanked by trees and various animals;
the middle section is damaged but may also
have contained Zimrilim.33 In a related
wall painting scene opposite, mythological
battles around water are recorded: Marduk
conquers Tiamat, the (salt) watery female
monster whose defeat marks Marduk’s rise
to sovereign power above all the gods. Ex-
cavator Parrot writes of the goddess with the
ﬂowing vase at Mari: “Statue miraculeuse,
elle s’animait à certaines heures, apportant
à l’Etat, donc aux sujets de Zimri-Lim, la
preuve matérielle de ses faveurs. D’elle on
aurait pu dire en lui appliquant une des
données de la dogmatique chrétienne,
qu’elle était ‘le signe visible d’une grâce in-
visible’.”34 Indeed!
One might easily make the case that
Mesopotamian water imagery has greater
or lesser impact on gendered metaphors
found in Proverbs that were edited or com-
posed in the Persian or Hellenistic period,
depending on how one chooses to deal
with the scant evidence. The Babylonian
shape and inﬂuence on the Torah is indis-
putable and need not be argued here; later
Jewish communities continued living in the
region of Babylon, so continuous contact
with ancient traditions of this region may
be posited. However, our study must also

take into account the change in ecological environment—and concomitant
mythology—between the Bible’s two regional homes, the Levant and Meso-
potamia. Given the Hebrew Bible’s preoccupation with issues of land, we
would expect to see conditions in the beloved land of promise reﬂected in its
scripture as well as the environmental situation of some of its writers in the
land of exile.
It is hardly possible to overestimate the signiﬁcance of water in its real, ma-
terialist sense in an arid region whose inhabitants engage mostly in subsistence
agriculture for their survival. Indeed, the history of economic and political de-
velopment in Syria–Palestine may be mapped along the trajectory of the situa-
tion pertaining when there is no great river to serve as conduit for culture. In
circumstances of that sort, it was not the ﬂowing stream that held pride of place
but the life-giving rainstorm whose waters were caught in cisterns, hewn into
bedrock by hard labor. In the south (Arad, Beth-shemesh, Kadesh-barnea, Tel
Sheva), cisterns (sing., bôr) were cut directly into bedrock in the shape of a
bottle or bell and, where rock was porous, had to be plastered with lime in or-
der to hold water successfully. In the north (Gibeon, Hazor, Gezer, Megiddo),
engineers cut directly down into bedrock to reach the water table. By the Iron
II period, most houses had their own private cistern, though the king or gov-
ernor also maintained a public cistern within the city walls. Some cities were
provided with man-made underground reservoirs. Management of one’s water
supply was a critical duty of kings who wished to survive a war or siege, as
Hezekiah’s work on the Siloam Tunnel and the outlets of the Gihon Springs
shows (2 Chr 32:2–5).35
Mythology reﬂects these conditions and adaptations. The long-time associ-
ation of the Weather- or Storm-God with the powerful thunderstorms that
give life is attested in Levantine mythological epics, prayers, and historical
documents. The ability to make rain or control water supply is equated with
the raw power of life. In Ugaritic materials from the Late Bronze Age, we ﬁnd
that, along with loss of animal and human fertility, the parched furrow and
dried up wadi pool is a sure sign that the Weather-God Baºal has fallen to his
enemy, Death. The return of the rains is a poignant moment of realized prom-
ise and deliverance, as we ﬁnd in the Epic of King Keret, yet another text
about a king’s quest for progeny:
Unto the earth Baal rains,
and unto the ﬁeld rains ºAliyy.

Sweet to the earth is Baal’s rain,
and to the ﬁeld the rain of ºAliyy . . .36
Yet, when read against the climatological background of the ancient Levant,
the story of the god who makes water from the sky—an atmospheric Storm-
God—takes on a more nuanced history, especially with respect to subterra-
nean waters as a source of fertility. Due to continued deforestation by ancient
populations engaged in building projects, the water table of Anatolia, northern
Syria, and Canaan continued to drop relentlessly, causing springs, rivers, and
wells to dry up. This ecological change took place within the framework of
the regular cycle of dry (death) and rainy (life) seasons, drought and fecundity.
At the same time, we see earlier terrestrial water-gods, modeled along Mesopo-
tamian mythological lines, recede in importance, often becoming the “disap-
pearing” Storm-God so well known from mythology. In prehistoric Anatolia,
a progression of imagery for this chthonic water deity can be seen by changes
in the images taken to represent fertilization of the ground: a squatting female
is later replaced by images of subterranean waters and ﬁnally evolves into a bull
or its horns, often shown within a circle (an image of a well from which the
god emerges). These earlier versions of the chthonic, water-giving deity in
Syria–Canaan (Yam ‘Sea’ or Nahar ‘Prince River’, along with ªEl, the great fa-
ther who gives fecundity) represent, for some, the more available naturally oc-
curring ground waters—springs, fountains, and wadi pools—of the Neolithic,
Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Ages.37
In the Levant, then, the dependence on rainfall and its collection rather
than river irrigation and its maintenance has not only shaped the portrait of the
dominant Weather-God but also added a signal dimension of uncertainty to
the human socioreligious relationship to the environment. Most importantly,
not only is rainfall unpredictable but, even when it does arrive, the necessary
waters run away uselessly without considerable organized effort to restrain and
contain them. While the data do not allow much speculation at present, it may
also be that the dominant form of the goddess in ancient Israel, the “asherah,”
whether pole or tree in Yahweh’s sanctuary, also bows gracefully to the testi-
mony of cosmic groundwaters that must be present to nourish a tree’s growth,
thereby allowing it to feed the caprids so often seen nibbling at its fruit. Per-
haps it is not without signiﬁcance that Josiah desecrated the irrigated royal gar-
dens on the terraces of the Kidron Valley, watered by the Gihon Spring, and

burned the Asherah from Yahweh’s house there at the brook ﬂowing from the
spring (2 Kgs 23:4, 6). For Ezekiel, paradise will have been restored when
these underground waters break out from beneath the restored Temple in Je-
rusalem and create trees whose fruit never falls or fails, along the banks of the
saving stream (Ezek 47:12).
Turning to consider the gendered imagery found in Prov 5:15–20, we
read:
Drink water from your own cistern, ﬂowing water from your own well.
Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
Let them be for yourself alone, and not for sharing with strangers.
Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth. 
(Prov 5:15–18, nrsv)
The sage’s address to the young man uses powerful images of water that is pri-
vate, contained, and restrained, versus scattered and public. It ﬁts nicely with
the Iron II conditions in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, where private cis-
terns in the home are contrasted with public cisterns or reservoirs accessible to
the public. The differentiation between the two kinds of groundwater—water
occurring naturally (fount, spring) and water that must be cultivated by hu-
man effort (cistern, well)—is accounted for by Fox as primarily a poetic dis-
tinction rather than an active element in the metaphor in question.38
However, given our survey of artifacts and material culture related to ground
water and its containers, one might raise the question of this distinction from
a mythological point of view.
The fountain and spring connect us powerfully to the ancient deities often
associated with wisdom and the secrets of the deep, such as Enki/Ea, who dis-
pense the naturally occurring waters; the cistern and the well remind us of
male effort in stabilizing the waters by providing a useful container—the canal,
the jar, the cistern. The kings and sages of the ancient Near East certainly
wanted water to ﬂow reliably but only under close control—theirs! Whether as
a funereal jar gendered as female and intimating primal growth or an awe-
inspiring “state” monument of a goddess fountain whose ﬂowing jar is main-
tained by a feat of male engineering, the female element in this metaphor is
diminished into an instrumentality, a vehicle for the master’s waters, and by ex-
tension, his sovereignty. The metaphor, when placed in material and mytho-
logical context, emphasizes male control more than female fecundity, and Fox
is correct when he places the meaning of springs and streams within the realm
of male procreativity. The springs and streams may refer to semen given shape

and held in its own rightful container, the wife, or to the offspring (!) them-
selves.39 Yet, the male waters are profoundly ambiguous, ﬂuids having no
shape of their own but the ones provided by culture. Left to themselves, they
wander where they will and run the risk of coming to nothing or going where
they should not. The well, the jar, and the cistern furnish a comforting, female
solution: inert, made and maintained by male effort, they contribute stability
to the ﬂow as they encompass the male streams.
The metaphor found in Prov 5:15–18 reﬂects some elements typical in the
gendering of visual imagery in the Hebrew Bible, where we often ﬁnd male
images to be “movable” (gazelle, ox, bull, eagle) and female images “station-
ary” (tree, plant, ﬂower, food). It does more, however, in that it reminds us
that, even in the words of the poet, the hand of the ruler may be at work, in-
scribing his own power on his subjects. Patriarchal organization, including sex-
uality, is a strategic technology of social control that fosters territorial expansion
and ranked stratiﬁcation of social classes, in part by making one gender norma-
tive and the owner of the other. Anomalous female sexuality, whether in desire
for a forbidden partner or an aberrant birth in which the sex of the child is un-
clear, was seen as a threat to the rule of kingship for precisely this reason. The
ruler had to assure the populace that he ruled with godly authorization and
could dispense the ﬂowing streams of life with godlike potency. This he ac-
complished by the harnessing the ideological power of the arts to convey the
simple message of “king = blessing.” But no king rules alone: in a world of
constant competition, it was important to form trustworthy alliances, and this
was best achieved by assuring loyalty through ties of kinship. In this context,
control of female sexuality was every bit as important and laborious a strategy
in the quest to stabilize power as was the ability to channel divine waters into
useful and far-ranging channels. Where would kings—or sages!—be without
the dutiful kinswomen they exchanged as pawns on the ﬁeld of politics?
Three different artifacts from three successive millennia—yet all tell the
same story in their imagery. Our sages are no Mesopotamian despots, but they
have a strikingly similar goal in this little passage on sexual ﬁdelity: to achieve
a proper succession and transfer of power from one generation of men to an-
other. Especially fearful is the liminal boundary where the sacred streams cross
the limits of the male body, where private becomes public, the secure becomes
the scattered; it required metaphorical reinforcement. To achieve this, the
sages required a conduit, a stabilizing mold or “placeholder” for their semen
and their connection to the future. The gendered image of the female body as

a receptacle,40 whether as well or fountain, in clay, stone, or ﬂesh, is indeed
“locked” and loaded with patriarchal fantasies of control as woman’s body
gives shape to the gendered waters of life.
40. Fox rightly notes that Lev 20:18 views “fount” as the source of menstrual ﬂow
(p. 201). Clearly, the image can be multivalent, but I would argue that menstrual ﬂuid is sel-
dom considered positively in ofﬁcial patriarchal ideology (for extensive discussion of genital
ﬂuids, see Wholly Woman, Holy Blood: A Feminist Critique of Purity and Impurity (ed. Kristin
De Troyer et al.; Studies in Antiquity and Christianity; Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press Inter-

The Instruction of Amenemope and
Proverbs 22:17–24:22 
from the Perspective of Contemporary Research
Nili Shupak
University of Haifa
The Instruction of Amenemope remained buried in the basement of the
British Museum for approximately 40 years before its translation into English
was published in 1923. Subsequently, the question of the relationship between
the Instruction of Amenemope and the book of Proverbs has not ceased to oc-
cupy researchers. A variety of answers to this question were proposed, until in
the 1960s the consensus was reached that the Instruction of Amenemope in-
ﬂuenced the book of Proverbs, rather than the reverse.
This position was, however, challenged by the late R. N. Whybray. Why-
bray, a leading scholar of research on biblical wisdom literature who initially
voiced support for this consensus, recently revised his opinion and, in a series
of recent publications, cast doubt upon the direct connection between the
book of Proverbs, particularly 22:17–24:22, and the Egyptian wisdom litera-
ture. Given Whybray’s long, valuable contribution to the study of biblical wis-
dom literature, his view deserves serious consideration.
The purpose of this discussion is, therefore, to examine Whybray’s argu-

I will begin with a brief survey of scholarship on the issue. Then I will present
Whybray’s argument, together with the opposing claims that have recently
been raised from a biblical perspective by J. A. Emerton. In the following, I
will examine Whybray’s approach, with an emphasis on the Egyptological per-
spective: an analysis of the relevant Hebrew text in comparison with Egyptian
wisdom literature, essentially a completion of Emerton’s examination from a
biblical perspective. Finally, I will attempt to answer the following question:

Instruction of Amenemope and Prov 22:17–24:22, or should a relationship of
this sort be rejected, in line with Whybray?
The ﬁrst scholar to point to a connection between the third collection of
the book of Proverbs, “The Words of the Wise” (Prov 22:17–24:22), and the
Instruction of Amenemope was the Egyptologist Erman,1 who, in 1924, rea-
soned that the Instruction of Amenemope was translated into Hebrew by a
Jew living in Egypt in the Saite or the Persian period. The differences between
the texts were explained by him as distortions on the part of the editors of the
collection of Proverbs, who did not understand the composition translated
from the Egyptian.
Gressmann2 embraced Erman’s assumption that the writer or editor of these
chapters in Proverbs borrowed from the Egyptian composition, although in his
opinion Proverbs was not a direct translation from the Egyptian source but
rather a considered selection of suitable material adapted to the new frame-
work. Both Gressmann and Sellin,3 who also published two papers in the same
year (1924), assumed that the word µwvlv in Prov 22:20 relates to 30 sayings
that can be found in Prov 22:17–24:22.
No more than three years later (beginning in 1927), both biblical and
Egyptological scholars overturned these conclusions: the Egyptian composi-
tion is not the source for the Proverbs but vice versa. They argued that the
book of Proverbs, or another Semitic composition, inﬂuenced the author of
the Instruction of Amenemope; or alternatively, that the author of the Instruc-
tion of Amenemope and the author of the book of Proverbs borrowed from a
prior Hebrew or Aramaic composition. The starting point for this proposition
was the assumption that the Instruction of Amenemope was composed in the
Late Period, that is, during the Persian period, probably in one of the Jewish
colonies in Egypt mentioned in Jeremiah (44:1; 46:14). The major arguments
of these scholars were as follows:
a. Amenemope demonstrates a unique religious-moral standpoint regard-
ing the conception of God and the relationship between humans and

their fellow-humans. These thoughts have no parallel in the previous
Egyptian wisdom texts but are to be found in the Hebrew Scriptures.4
b. The Instruction of Amenemope is replete with Semitisms reﬂected in its
syntax, grammar, and terminology.5
This view was disproved with the redating of the Egyptian work on the basis
of orthography and palaeography. During the 1960s, it became clear that
Amenemope was, almost certainly, composed in the Ramesside period, the
eleventh century b.c.e.6
Williams7 stood at the forefront of the rejection of the theory in favor of
Semitism in the Egyptian work, a theory which seemingly conﬁrmed that the
Egyptian instruction was translated from a Semitic composition. Williams
pointed out that the Ramesside period was characterized by close contact with
Egypt’s northern neighbors, as a result of which many Semitic words pene-
trated the Egyptian language. Accordingly, the use of Semitic words is com-
mon to all works that were written in that period and is not unique to the
Instruction of Amenemope.8
Thus, for approximately three decades, the majority of researchers were
of the opinion that the Egyptian wisdom literature inﬂuenced the author of
Prov 22:17–24:22, whether the source of the inﬂuence was the Instruction of
Amenemope or other similar Egyptian instruction.9 The key word in the

reconstruct this instruction, which she terms Alte Lehre. The Jubilar questioned the feasibil-
ity of reconstructing such an instruction; see Michael V. Fox, “Two Decades of Research in

establishment of this relationship between the Egyptian instruction and Prov-
erbs 22–24 was µwvlv (Kethiv; µyv¥ylIv… Qere) which appears in Prov 22:20.
Scholars assumed that this word was borrowed from its Egyptian parallel,
found in the epilogue to the Instruction of Amenemope (27:6) and relates to
the 30 chapters that make up the Egyptian work. They disagree, however, on
the question of whether there are 30 chapters or instructions in Prov 22:17–
24:22 and on the scope of these units.10
Recently, Whybray challenged this consensus. In his last publications, from
1990 onward, he argued that the author or editor of Prov 22:17–24:22 had no
direct contact with the Instruction of Amenemope.11 The main points of
Whybray’s research have been raised in previous research,12 and they are as
follows: only some of the subjects that feature in the Egyptian work can be
found in Prov 22:17–23:11; additionally, the order of their appearance in the
10. Among those who maintain that Prov 22:17–24:22 contains 30 sayings or literary
units are: Sellin, “Review of A. Erman”; idem, “Die neugefundene ‘Lehre des Amen-em-
ope’”; Gressmann, “Die neugefundene Lehre”; R. B. Y. Scott, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes (AB 18;
Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1965); William McKane, Proverbs: A New Approach (OTL;
Philadelphia: Westminster, 1970); J. A. Emerton, “The Teaching of Amenemope and Prov-
erbs XXII 17–XXIV 22: Further Reﬂections on a Long-Standing Problem,” VT 51 (2001)

and Exegetical Remarks to ‘The Words of the Wise’ (Proverbs 22,17–24,22),” in Homage to
Shmuel: Studies in the World of the Bible (ed. Z. Talshir et al.; Jerusalem: Ben-Gurion Univer-
sity of the Negev Press / Bialik Institute, 2001). Among the writers who hold that µwvlv
was written under the inﬂuence of the Egyptian parallel but doubt that Prov 22:17–24:22
contains 30 sayings are Erman, “Eine ägyptische Quelle,” and my Proverbs (The World of
the Bible; Tel Aviv, 1996 [Hebrew]).
11. Whybray expressed the opposite opinion in his earlier research. Thus, in his com-
mentary on the book of Proverbs, he writes: “The Instruction of Amen-m-opet served di-
rectly as a basis for one section of Proverbs (22:17–24:22)” (The Book of Proverbs [CBC;
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972] 3; cf. p. 132). Further on, in his commentary
on 22:17–24:22, he identiﬁes 30 sections (pp. 133–41). For a rejection of the direct connec-
tion between the Instruction of Amenemope and the book of Proverbs, see his latest publi-
cations: R. N. Whybray, Wealth and Poverty in the Book of Proverbs ( JSOTSup 99; Shefﬁeld:
Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 1990); idem, Proverbs (NCBC; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994);

sive research (Wege der Weisheit, 7–114).

207
Hebrew work is not identical to that in the Egyptian work. Whybray focuses
his discussion on the word µwvlv (Kethiv; µyv¥ylIv… Qere; Prov 22:20), which in
his opinion should be interpreted in accordance with the Kethiv ‘the day be-
fore yesterday’, although this interpretation was mentioned in earlier research
and rejected for reasons of hapax legomenon. Whybray ﬁnds support for this
reading (like Rufﬂe who preceded him) in the appearance of the word ‘today’,
also marking time, in the previous verse (v. 19). Whybray rejects the reading
µyv¥ løv‘ ‘thirty’, arguing that the use of a number without a noun is unknown
in biblical language; if the intention was to refer to 30 proverbs, the language
employed would have been ‘thirty words’ or ‘thirty sayings’. In addition, Prov
22:17–24:22 is not one homogenous literary unit made up of 30 sayings or
chapters, like the Instruction of Amenemope, but rather a literary unit consti-
tuted from varied material relating to different sources.13
Whybray nevertheless admits that these chapters in Proverbs demonstrate an
afﬁnity to the Egyptian material,14 although he maintains that there is a closer
similarity in form and content to other collections in the book of Proverbs,
particularly to the ﬁrst collection, chaps. 1–9. From this perspective, he exam-
ines and interprets Prov 22:17–24:22, not in comparison with the Instruction
of Amenemope but in connection with other sections of the book of Proverbs,
particularly with chaps. 1–9.15
Emerton disputed Whybray’s conclusions.16 In his article, Emerton ad-
dresses each of Whybray’s claims and refutes them one by one. Here I will re-
strict myself to the central issue raised by Emerton, speciﬁcally, the meaning
of the key word µwvlv (Kethiv; Prov 22:20). Emerton rejects the reading of
the word in accordance with the Kethiv ‘the day before yesterday’. He repeats
arguments that have been presented in prior research and, in addition, ﬁnds
support for his opinion in the versions as follows: the Septuagint renders
‘threefold’, namely, ‘in a threefold way’; the Vulgate, which follows, interprets
13. Whybray suggested (following Niccacci) that 22:17–23:11 constitute a separate in-
struction that contains ten units and a prologue at its beginning (22:17–21), and that 23:12–
24:22 “is a miscellaneous collection of (probably) seven pieces mainly of an instructional
character but having no common pattern and no connection with one another”; see Why-
bray, “The Structure,” 90–96; idem, The Composition, 324–25.
14. In this issue too, Whybray follows Rufﬂe (“The Teaching of Amenemope”), who
reasons that both the literary form and the subjects common to Prov 22:17–24:22 and the
Instruction of Amenemope belong to the wider cultural tradition of the ancient Near East
and are not indications of a dependency of one of the compositions on the other.

ture,” 86–96.

it as ‘in a threefold manner’, and the Syriac version is similar.17 Emerton as-
sumes that the Qere µyv¥ylIv… is the basis of the Septuagint translation. If this is
the case, the interpretation ‘thirty’ is closer to the versions and equals the
Egyptian parallel. With respect to Whybray’s claim that biblical language does
not allow the use of a number without specifying its subject (which should
have been ‘words’ or a similar term), Emerton cites examples from biblical lit-
erature in which a number is used without a subject (for example, the numeral
sayings in Prov 30:18, 21). Moreover, Emerton argues that, even if Whybray’s
claim that 22:17–24:22 are constituted of varied material taken from different
sources is accurate, it does not negate the existence of 30 sayings in these
chapters. Indeed, Emerton identiﬁes 30 sayings.
In the following, I will examine Whybray’s claims from an Egyptological
perspective rather than a biblical one such as Emerton’s, in light of the publi-
cation of new Egyptian wisdom texts in recent years. This may be considered
a fulﬁllment of Whybray’s own request, as he wrote in one of his last studies:
“That these may be here (in Proverbs 22:17–24:22) direct reminiscences of
that work (Amenemope), as of other similar works, here remains possible—
but this is a question to be decided by the Egyptologist.”18
Before embarking on a discussion of the Hebrew text in relation to the rele-
vant Egyptian material, I will brieﬂy describe the Egyptian composition, the
discovery of which 80 years ago was a turning point in the research on biblical
wisdom literature. The Instruction of Amenemope, the full manuscript of
which is to be found in the British Museum (no. 10474), was probably written
in the Ramesside period, in the eleventh century b.c.e., by a scribe of this
name who intended it for his youngest son. As with other Egyptian composi-
tions of this genre, its goal was to provide a sort of guidebook for the reader to
prepare him for a successful life and career. Both in its form and content, the
Instruction of Amenemope resembles other Egyptian wisdom instructions, all
17. Emerton raises a further argument against the interpretation of µwvlv as relating to
a period of time, but it does not withstand criticism. He argues that this interpretation infers
that the speaker recently wrote a letter of wisdom (t[dw tx[wmb) to the reader. This inter-
pretation is unlikely because there is no other instance in the Bible in which a letter of wis-
dom was written. However, the lack of reference to a letter of wisdom in the Bible does
not mean that there was no such letter in reality. Letters connected to schools were abun-
dant in ancient Egypt; see, for example, the Kemit, which is “a letter used in scribal train-
ing” (Richard Parkinson, Poetry and Culture in Middle Kingdom Egypt [London: Continuum,
2002] 322) or the satirical letter of Anastasi I and many other letters in the collection of Late
Egyptian Miscellanies (see Ricardo Caminos, Late-Egyptian Miscellanies [Brown Egyptolog-
ical Studies 1; London: Oxford University Press, 1954]).

of which are constructed in a uniform pattern. Despite this similarity, it has a
number of unique features with regard to both form and content: with regard
to form—the organization of metrical lines and grouping of lines into 30 sec-
tions or chapters; with regard to content—an emphasis on the connection be-
tween humans and god on the one hand, and the supremacy of god on the
other. God appears here as a supreme being who exercises exclusive gover-
nance over various aspects of human life, such as wealth and poverty, reward
and punishment, and so on. It is important to note that, over time, the Rames-
side work became a popular text and even formed part of the corpus taught in
schools, as testiﬁed by copies of sections preserved on papyrus, wooden boards,
and ostraca. Although most of these copies date from the middle of the ﬁrst
millennium b.c.e., a citation in a school text from the ﬁrst century b.c.e. dem-
onstrates that it remained in use even in a later period.
The parallels between “The Words of the Wise” (Prov 22:17–24:22) and
the Instruction of Amenemope are concentrated in the ﬁrst section, 22:17–
23:11. The second part of this collection, 23:12–24:22, does not contain con-
secutive parallels to the Instruction of Amenemope. It does, however, include
parallels to Egyptian wisdom literature in respect to content and even termi-
nology, although they appear in a scattered, rather than in a concentrated,
manner. The nature of the connection to Egyptian material differs, therefore,
between the two parts of the collection, and I will discuss them separately.
A. The Connection between Proverbs 22:17–23:11 and the
Egyptian Wisdom Literature
Appendix 1 demonstrates that the parallels in Proverbs to the Instruction of
Amenemope (with the exception of 22:26–27, which has no Egyptian paral-
lel) appear consecutively, while in Amenemope they are dispersed throughout
the entire work (in nine different chapters!). Moreover, details found in the
Egyptian instruction do not appear in the Hebrew composition and vice versa.
However, these differences between the Hebrew and Egyptian texts do not
necessarily lead to Whybray’s conclusion that there is no connection between
the two works. The conclusion of these ﬁndings is, rather, that the Hebrew
author did not copy the text mechanically. The Egyptian material was adapted
and modiﬁed in order to suit the new Hebrew framework; in this way, “casket
of the belly” was replaced by “belly” (appendix 1, #2); the goose commonly
found in the Nylotic habitat became the eagle, characteristic of the mountain-
ous landscape of the land of Israel (app. 1, #11). So, too, Hebrew elements
were added that have no analogy in the ancient Egyptian world; for example,

210
lag (‘redeemer’, app. 1, #15), µlw[ lwbg (‘an ancient landmark’, app. 1, ##8
and 15), and the name of God (app. 1, ##2 and 5).
Previous scholars who argued in favor of the inﬂuence of the Egyptian
work on the book of Proverbs generally used two arguments: the similarity of
the content and objectives of Prov 22:17–23:11 and Amenemope, and the
predating of the Egyptian instruction in relation to the book of Proverbs. In
the following, I would like to raise further arguments that have not yet re-
ceived sufﬁcient attention:
1. The Hebrew text is difﬁcult and incomprehensible unless illuminated by the Egyp-
tian text, in which the verses are clearer and situated in their natural context. For
example, Prov 22:18–19 and the Instruction of Amenemope 3:11–16 (app. 1,
#2), although different in scope (Hebrew—2 verses; Egyptian—6 verses), deal
with an identical subject: a warning to treasure the instructions and to employ
them only in a time of need. Both sources speak of safeguarding words in the
belly. This image is foreign to Hebrew thought, which normally considers the
heart to be the seat of thought and feeling. The belly rarely plays this role and
then only in biblical wisdom literature ( Job 32:18–20 and Proverbs; see be-
low). Hence, this image is borrowed from Egyptian literature, in which the
belly denotes a person’s innermost soul. “Belly” in the Hebrew work is paral-
leled in the Egyptian work by “casket of the belly,” which is based on the
metaphor of a human’s thoughts arranged, book-like, in one’s belly casket.
The word “casket” in Egyptian denotes a wooden box used for storing papy-
rus scrolls.19 The Egyptian phrase “casket of the belly” is absent from Proverbs,
although the collocation “chambers of the belly,” which is strange and extraor-
dinary in biblical language, appears four times in the second collection of this
book (Prov 18:8; 26:22; 20:27, 30). This collocation is probably a result of the
adaptation of the Egyptian expression to the Hebrew background: the chest of
books belonging to the Egyptian scribe’s craft was replaced by the “chamber”
common to the Israelite environment. The mention of God’s name (Yhwh)
in the biblical verses (v. 19) again indicates the elaboration and adaptation of the
Egyptian material to the Hebrew mentality.
In Prov 22:24–25 and the Instruction of Amenemope 11:11–12 (#6), the
subject of both sections is also identical—a prohibition against befriending a
hot-tempered man (Heb. twmj vya; Eg. smm/hmm)—although there is a small
19. For a detailed study of the concept of the belly and the phrase ‘casket of the belly’
(hnw n ht in Egyptian), see my Where Can Wisdom Be Found? The Sage’s Language in the
Bible and in Ancient Egyptian Literature (OBO 130; Freiburg: Universitätsverlag, 1993) 293–
97; idem, “Egyptian Idioms and Imprints in Biblical Wisdom,” Tarbiz 54 (1985) 478–81
[Hebrew].

The Instruction of Amenemope and Proverbs 22:17–24:22
211
alteration: in Proverbs, one who befriends such a person brings tragedy upon
himself, while in the Instruction of Amenemope, the hot-tempered person
brings loss upon his fellow-human.
The terms twmj/hmj vya (in Prov 22:24–25 and 15:18), hmj l[b (29:22),
and hmj ldg (19:19), and their synonyms πa l[b (in 22:24) and πa vya (29:22)
appear as qualiﬁers of persons only in the book of Proverbs. The noun hmj de-
rives from the Hebrew root µmj ‘to be hot’, and the collocation hmj vya is the
semantic, phonetic, and etymological equivalent of the Egyptian adjective smm/
hmm, which represents the negative type of human being in Egyptian wisdom
literature—irritable, an instigator of quarrel, a slanderer, and a heretic. The
term hmj vya and other parallel terms in the book of Proverbs are, therefore,
another instance of borrowing from the Egyptian usage and concept.20
In comparing Prov 23:4–5 and the Instruction of Amenemope 9:14–15
(app. 1, #11), the general meaning of the section of Proverbs is clear: wealth
is ephemeral; it disappears the moment one looks away. However, the content
of this section is difﬁcult and surprising, because there are many sayings in the
book that praise wealth and scorn poverty (see, for example, 10:15; 19:4;
22:7). Apparently, the section in Proverbs is distorted and needs to be under-
stood in conjunction with the Egyptian parallel: it speaks of wealth that has
been acquired by theft, and for this reason it will not remain in the possession
of the owner. This is a further example of the adaptation of the Egyptian ma-
terial by the Hebrew author, who took the opening and the conclusion of the
Egyptian parallel but omitted the middle section by mistake. So, too, he ex-
changed the geese for an eagle in order to suit the image of the bird to the
Israelite landscape.
These examples are sufﬁcient to illustrate the manner in which comparison
with the Instruction of Amenemope clariﬁes vague and incomprehensible de-
tails in Prov 22:17–23:11. Consequently, it is difﬁcult to accept Whybray’s hy-
pothesis that there is no direct connection between Prov 22:17–23:11 and the
Instruction of Amenemope and that these chapters should be interpreted in re-
lation to other chapters of the book of Proverbs, particularly chaps. 1–9. The
similarity between the ﬁrst collection of Proverbs, chaps. 1–9, and the third
20. The term smm/hmm stands in synonymous parallelism with the adjective t·. These
two terms are collocated with parts of the body: mouth, belly, heart. For a discussion of the
Egyptian terminology that relates to the “hot-tempered man” and to the “hot-tempered
man” as a type of human being in Egyptian literature, see my “Where Can Wisdom Be Found?
117–18, 129–31. For parallels in Hebrew, see pp. 132–34, 137–38, 144–49; see also my

Wisdom Literature” [Hebrew], in Scribes, Schools and Libraries in Antiquity (Michmanim 10; ed.

collection of “The Words of the Wise” cannot be denied, even though this
similarity is mainly expressed in its literary form, namely the genre of instruc-
tion from father to son and the call to listen and observe the wisdom words for-
mulated in the imperative. Moreover, the differences between Prov 22:17–
23:11 and Proverbs 1–9 in matters of detail do not exist between Prov 22:17–
23:11 and the Egyptian instruction. (For example: the subject of the poor and
needy person in 22:17–23:11 is not found in chaps. 1–9, and the image of
Lady Wisdom appears repeatedly in chaps. 1–9 but is missing from “The
Words of the Wise.”)
2. The assumption that the Instruction of Amenemope or a similar instruction inﬂu-
enced Prov 22:17–23:11 is also supported by concepts, terms, and images interwoven
in these chapters that, though common to Egyptian wisdom literature, are foreign to the
Hebrew context. These details, some of which have been mentioned above, are
abundant both in works that precede the Instruction of Amenemope and in
works that follow it, as may be seen from the following list:21

(b) The ‘hot tempered man’ (Heb. hmj vya; Eg. smm/hmm) and its syn-
onyms, as the negative type of human being (rather than the fool or the
wicked man):23 Amenemope 4:17; 5:10; 6:1–6; 11:13–12:9; 12:16; 15:13–

(c) Table manners. This was a popular subject for the authors of wisdom lit-
erature in general and not just for the authors of the book of Proverbs and the
Egyptian compositions. See, for example, Sir 31:12–16. Advice and instruc-
tions regarding dining and table manners, however, are particularly prevalent
in Egyptian wisdom literature: Amenemope 23:12–20 (cf. Prov 23:1–3); To
Kagemni I 3–11; Ptahhotep 119–44; Any 8:6–7; see also: Kheti xxviii:d–f;
Insinger 5:12–6:24.
Other details, common to both Prov 22:17–23:11 and the Instruction of
Amenemope, are also widespread in Egyptian wisdom literature. These in-
clude: the call to listen to the instruction of the father and words in praise of
the act of listening,24 acclamation for the efﬁcient (ryhm) ofﬁcial (scribe?)25 and
the good messenger,26 and a call to lend help and show generosity toward the
weak and needy—the poor, the orphan, and the widow.27 These motifs,
however, are not exclusive to Egyptian wisdom and can also indicate an an-
cient Near Eastern wisdom tradition common to both the Hebrew author and
his Egyptian colleague.

Kheti XXIV:c; Amunnakht 2–4, 5–8, 50–51; Anastasi III 3,13–4,1; Anastasi V 23:5–6.

IV verso 2:5–3:10; 6:11–6:14; Anastasi V 9:4–5. The need for a ‘skilled scribe’ (ss ss·wy)
in Amenemope (27:16) is replaced in Proverbs (22:29) by ryhm vya. The meaning of ryhm
in biblical language is ‘efﬁcient’, and it appears twice in the context of a skilled scribe who
is proﬁcient in his work (Ps 45:2, Ezra 7:6). The likely meaning of ryhm vya in Proverbs is,
therefore, ‘an efﬁcient scribe’. The description of Ahiqar as ‘a wise and efﬁcient scribe’ (spr
˙kym wmhyr) (Ahiqar 1; see Arthur Cowley, Aramiac Papyri of the Fifth Century b.c. [Osna-
brück: Otto Zeller, 1923; repr. 1967] 212) also conﬁrms this interpretation. In the satirical
letter Anastasi I 4, 18, the phrase mhr ‘scribe’ appears, and is traditionally interpreted in light
of the biblical expression ‘efﬁcient scribe’. Recently, however, Egyptologists have shown
that this phrase has no connection to the biblical phrase. In Papyrus Anastasi I the term has
a military context, and its meaning is a scout or tracker who goes ahead of the army and
prepares the way for the infantry and cavalry. For a detailed discussion of this issue, see Hans
Werner Fischer-Elfert, Die satirische Streitschrift des Papyrus Anastasi I (Ägyptologische Ab-
handlungen 44; Wiesbaden: Harassowitz, 1986) 159, 161, 244–45 and the bibliography

The above discussion demonstrates that there are parallels in content, con-
cept, and terminology not only with the ﬁrst section of “The Words of the
Wise,” Prov 22:17–23:11 and the Instruction of Amenemope, but also with
other Egyptian wisdom works, both earlier and later. However, the connec-
tion to the Instruction of Amenemope is of a different nature: no other Egyp-
tian wisdom work, including works published in recent years, contains such a
large number of parallels to the Hebrew composition. Moreover, the com-
monalities with the Instruction of Amenemope appear in Prov 22:17–23:11
in a concentrated and consecutive fashion, in a manner unparalleled in other
sections of the book of Proverbs. There can be no doubt of the exceptional
connection between this section of “The Words of the Wise” and the Egyp-
tian instruction. Assuredly, the Instruction of Amenemope was before the eyes
of the Hebrew author as he wrote these verses of the book of Proverbs.
B. The Connection between Proverbs 23:12–24:22 and the
Egyptian Wisdom Literature
It has been shown above that the consecutive connection with the Instruc-
tion of Amenemope ends with Prov 23:11. This conclusion does not negate
the possibility that the second section of “The Words of the Wise,” Prov
23:12–24:22, was also inﬂuenced by Egyptian material. In fact, an examina-
tion of these verses in relation to compositions of Egyptian wisdom reveals a
range of terms and concepts that are common in Egyptian wisdom literature
(some of these are identical to those that may be found in the ﬁrst section of
“The Words of the Wise”). The following is an enumeration of these terms
and concepts, in accordance with the order of their appearance in the book of
Proverbs:
1. the call to listen and acquire instruction (23:12–13; cf. 22:17);28
2. the heart and ears as vessels for acquiring wisdom (23:12; cf. 22:17);29
3. whipping with a rod as an incentive for learning (23:13–14);30
28. See n. 24 above. The term rswm (23:12–13) is semantically parallel with Egyptian
sb·yt and has a double meaning of ‘instruction’, ‘reproof’, on the one hand, and ‘beating’,
on the other. See my Where Can Wisdom Be Found? 31–34.
29. For a detailed discussion and for examples from the Egyptian and Hebrew wisdom
literature, see ibid., 277–80, 299–302; idem, “The ‘Sitz im Leben’ of the book of Proverbs
in the Light of a Comparison of Biblical and Egyptian Wisdom Literature,” RB 94 (1987)
113–16.
30. See ibid., 109–11; cf. Ahiqar 80–82 (Cowley, Aramaic Papyri, 214–15).

4. refraining from rejoicing at an enemy’s misfortune and from responding
to an adversary or injurer, knowing that God alone is in charge of in-
ﬂicting penalty (23:17; cf. 24:29);31
5. warning against gluttony and guzzling wine (23:20–21);32
6. the dangerous results of slackness and idleness (23:21);33
7. demonstrating respect and obedience to parents, particularly to mothers
(23:22);34
8. parental joy in a wise son (23:24–25);35
9. the danger posed by a prostitute illustrated by comparing her to a nar-
row well and a deep pit (23:28–29);36
10. admonition against drunkenness (23:29–35).37
Based on this enumeration we may infer that the primary afﬁnity with the
Egyptian material is to be found in Prov 23:12–35.38 However, chap. 24 also
contains concepts or images borrowed from Egyptian wisdom literature. For
example, the appellation for God twbl ˆnt ‘who measures the hearts’ in 24:12
appears only in the book of Proverbs (see also 21:2 and compare with ˆnt
twjwr ‘who measures the spirits’ in 16:2). This image of God relates to the role
of Thoth, the Egyptian god of Wisdom, in the Judgment of the Dead. Thoth
is positioned next to scales, upon which the heart of the deceased is weighed

38. Some scholars see a connection with Egyptian wisdom literature in Prov 24:11–12,
which instructs a person to support his/her neighbor in a time of need. In substance, this
verse is close to Amenemope 11:6–7, which warns against handing over an escaped man,
and perhaps also to Ankhsheshonqy 8:9, which advises against distancing oneself from a
scribe who has been taken to jail. See Römheld, who cites further parallels to Egyptian wis-
dom literature (Wege der Weisheit, 84–85).

against the goddess of Justice, Maºat, and Thoth’s role is to record the results
of the weighing.39 Furthermore, the word twlbjt ‘wisdom saying’, which ap-
pears in Prov 24:6 and is common in the Bible only in wisdom literature,40
should be interpreted in the light of its Egyptian semantic parallel, the term ts.
In the language of Egyptian wisdom, ts represents a well-constructed saying, a
pithy maxim made like a series of knots and loops. Similarly, the word twlbjt
is derived from the Hebrew word lbj ‘rope’ and in wisdom literature refers
to wisdom words artfully expressed.41
There is no doubt that many of the admonitions and words of advice pre-
sented above as Egyptian imprints on Prov 23:12–24:22 are not unique to
Egyptian wisdom literature. Instructions to respect parents, avoid prostitutes,
encourage education through whipping, and so on, may be found in all an-
cient wisdom literature. However, the unique terminological afﬁnity between
these chapters of Proverbs and the vocabulary of Egyptian wisdom literature
(reﬂected in the terms rswm, twbl ˆkt, and twlbjt) and the mark of the In-
struction of Amenemope on the ﬁrst section of “The Words of the Wise,”
Prov 22:17–23:11 lead us to the conclusion that these are deﬁnitely Egyptian
imprints.
An analysis of Prov 22:17–24:22 in comparison with Egyptian wisdom
literature demonstrates that the ﬁrst section of “The Words of the Wise” in
22:17–23:11 contains a concentration of topics, terms, and images common
to Proverbs and the Instruction of Amenemope. This connection is excep-
tional and cannot be equated with the connection that exists between the sec-
ond section of the collection, 23:12–24:22, and Egyptian wisdom literature.
Accordingly, it may be assumed that the author or editor of Prov 22:17–
23:11 was familiar with the Instruction of Amenemope and borrowed from it.
The borrowing was done in a careful and considered manner: the Hebrew au-
thor or editor made changes and adapted the instructions of the Egyptian sage
to the world of monotheistic belief and to the geographical conditions of the
land of Israel. There is no doubt that the key word µyv¥ løv‘ ‘thirty’ in Prov
22:20 stems from the inﬂuence of the Egyptian parallel, whether 22:17–24:22
contains 30 sayings or not.
These conclusions refute Whybray’s position that there is no connection
between the Instruction of Amenemope and Prov 22:17–23:11.
39. This Egyptian motif is reﬂected in the description of scales in Job 31:6. For twbl ˆnt
as a fossilized remnant of the Egyptian motif in the Bible, see my “Egyptian Idioms,” 476–78.
40. See Prov 1:5; 11:14; 12:5; 20:18; 24:6; Job 37:11–12.

The Instruction of Amenemope and Proverbs 22:17–24:22
217
With respect to the nature of the connection between the second section
of “The Words of the Wise,” 23:12–24:22, and the Egyptian material, the
picture is different. The use of subjects and terms common in Egyptian wis-
dom literature reﬂects a general connection, but there are no consecutive par-
allels between the Hebrew and Egyptian materials of the kind found in 22:17–
23:11. Accordingly, it is likely that the author or editor of these chapters was
inﬂuenced by the Egyptian wisdom tradition in general rather than by the In-
struction of Amenemope.
In any event, the answer to the question posed by Whybray that opened
this discussion is: Prov 22:17–24:22 is indeed reminiscent of Amenemope, as
well as of other similar works!
Finally, the question also arises how the Egyptian wisdom material reached
the hands of the author-editor of the collection “The Words of the Wise.” Al-
though any answer to this question is necessarily speculative, we can assume
that the corpus taught in the educational framework in ancient Israel included
instructions such as the Egyptian Instruction of Amenemope.42 Furthermore,
we may assume that a copy of this instruction—a subject of great popularity
in Egypt that was still copied in schools a thousand years after its composi-
tion—reached the author-editors of the book of Proverbs (whether they were
part of the educational framework in Israel or not), who used it in an intelli-
gent and sophisticated manner. They succeeded in incorporating this foreign,
Egyptian material into Hebrew wisdom, embedding it in such a fashion that
even a renowned scholar such as Whybray was misguided by them!

The Woman of Valor and A Woman Large of Head: 
Matchmaking in the Ancient Near East
Victor Avigdor Hurowitz
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev
For Papa make him a scholar;
For Mama make him rich as a king;
For me, well, I wouldn’t holler
if he were as handsome as anything.
—Hodel, Fiddler on the Roof
The “Woman of Valor” (henceforth WV),1 meticulously portrayed as a ﬁ-
nale to the book of Proverbs (Prov 31:10–31), is no stranger to biblical schol-
ars, who have examined her from head to toe in countless commentaries,
articles, and books. One may think, in fact, that she is regarded as a woman
with no rival, for she has rarely been compared systematically with any con-
temporary lady.2 However, this lack of comparison may reﬂect not an absence
1. I use ‘Woman of Valor’ as a translation of lyj tva purely for convenience, indicating
therewith both the woman and the pericope (Prov 31:10–31). This term has been trans-
lated ‘Woman of Virtue’/‘Virtuous Woman’ (kjv, rsv), ‘Woman of Parts’ (William Mc-
Kane, Proverbs: A New Approach [OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1970]), ‘Capable Wife’
(njpsv), ‘Woman of Substance’, among others. For a recent discussion of the nuances of lyj,
see Alexander Rofé, who interprets the term as “successful woman” (“‘A Virtuous Wife’
[lyj tva], gunhv sunethv, and the Redaction of the Book of Proverbs” [Hebrew], in Homage
to Shmuel: Studies in the World of the Bible [ed. Z. Talshir, S. Yona, and D. Sivan; Jerusalem:
Ben Gurion University Press / Bialik Institute, 2001] 382–90). My colleague Prof. Chaim
Cohen is preparing a study of the term in which he suggests translating it ‘A Woman who
is a Treasure’. WV has often been taken as an allegory of things such as Wisdom, Torah,
Sabbath, and Shekhinah. Such interpretations go back to ancient sources and still appear in
contemporary scholarship. Nonetheless, I fully concur with the majority of modern schol-
ars, who take her at face value as a ﬂesh-and-blood woman (for example, Margaret Crook,
“The Marriageable Maiden of Proverbs 31:10–31,” JNES 13 [1954] 137–40; Rofé, “A
Virtuous Wife”).
2. Berend Gemser refers to the Egyptian proverbs of Any §54, Ankhsheshonq, and Pa-
pyrus Insinger 8,8–9 (Sprüche Salomos [HAT 16; Tübingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1963] 109).
These compositions in fact contain numerous adages of one or several lines concerning
women of all sorts, but there is no extended depiction reaching the proportions of WV; for

of rivals but a dearth of competing descriptions.3 This lack of candidates may
now be ﬁlled by a Mesopotamian text recently published and edited, which is
probably not well known to many biblical scholars. In this article, dedicated in
friendship and esteem to Michael Fox, the world’s foremost expounder of bib-
lical wisdom literature in general and Proverbs in particular, I will brieﬂy de-
scribe and discuss this relatively unknown text and subject it to comparative-
contrastive investigation, attempting to determine what, if anything, it can
teach us about WV and matchmaking priorities in the ancient Near East.
The Akkadian text is called Summa sinnistu qaqqada rabât ‘If a Woman Is
Large of Head’ (henceforth WLH), as found in the partially preserved colo-
phon to one of the exemplars.4 This is a collection of physiognomic omens—
that is, omens based on a person’s anatomical features—in which the protasis
describes some feature of the person’s appearance and the apodosis either
makes a prediction about the person or characterizes him or her on the basis
of that feature. Unlike the 12-tablet series Alamdimmû that examines the male
body for signs, this one tablet composition describes a woman. As a sample of

pret WV against the background of the Persian period, but she does not mention any one
text that describes a woman (“The Woman of Substance [lyjAtva]: A Socioeconomic

Berlin: de Gruyter, 2001). Al Wolters (“Proverbs xxxi 10–31 as Heroic Hymn: A Form-
Critical Analysis,” VT 38 [1988] 446–57) states that WV is a “critique of the literature in
praise of women which was prevalent in the ancient Near East” (p. 456), but the only an-
cient Near Eastern literature he mentions in his article is the Song of Deborah.

Proverbs that deal with human physiognomy and characteristics (other verses according to
G. E. Bryce, “Omen-Wisdom in Ancient Israel,” JBL 94 [1975] 19–37) but offers no fur-
ther discussion. See the review by Jo Ann Scurlock, “Review of Böck, Die babylonisch-
assyrische Morphoskopie,” JAOS 123 (2003) 395–99; she refers to our text as “the picture of
the ideal woman” (p. 398). See as well Mark Geller (“West Meets East: Early Greek and

tabru) on women (ibid., 230–33).

of California Press, 1973–80). For citations from these texts concerning women in general,

what this text contains, lines 100–103 read: summa sinnistum qatasa baªla bit
dulli ippus; summa qattana mustamrißat; summa arka isarru ilanât; summa karâ ulap-
pan ‘If a woman’s hands are abnormally large, she will build a house of labor/
misery; if they are small, she is a hypochondriac; if they are long, she will be
rich, she is divine; if they are short, she will be poor’.
The largest text, which can be reconstructed on the basis of four, partially
preserved manuscripts, was originally an 8-column tablet, of which no less
than 265 lines partially or fully survive. The preserved passages are divided by
horizontal lines into 24 sections, each section relating to a different part of the
body from head to toe, including:5 hands (lines 100–118), ﬁngers (119–42),
chest (143–46), breasts (156–72), nipples (173–75), belly (176–81, 182–87),
navel (188–96, 197–200), vaginal labia (208–12), toes (233–39). Each section
contains individual omens of the type illustrated above, describing a particular
characteristic of the pertinent body part, followed by what this particular trait
signals.
Toward the end of this tablet (lines 250–61) there are two sections that de-
viate from the rest of the text in structure and details of content,6 to which we
turn our attention now. No longer are there individual lines describing single
features of a woman, but two six-line composite views, each containing sev-
eral different features of two women. The apodosis in each section begins
with the resumptive words sinnistum si ‘that woman (just described)’ and is
considerably more detailed than the one- or two-word statements in the
single-line omens. Most importantly, the signs and prognoses in the protases
and apodoses have no exact parallels in the previous omens.
These are the passages in normalized transliteration and translation:

Both of these passages describe a woman and then predict what kind of life
awaits her. There are elements common to both passages, and, in a certain
sense, they are parallel. Nonetheless, there is not a full one-to-one correspon-
dence between the elements of the two passages. The ﬁrst one describes seven
physical features of the woman. The second, however, describes only six
clearly physical traits, while adding three behavioral aspects: something goes/
walks and is found by her right side, and she speaks softly. As for the apodoses,
both passages contain seven clauses, but they differ in content and grammatical
construction. The ﬁrst one has three clauses predicting physical and mental
characteristics in stative-tense verbs and four describing future actions in
present-future forms. The second also contains seven clauses, but only the ﬁrst
is a trait in the stative, while the other six are actions in the present-future.
9. Böck (Morphoskopie) has translated here and in line 255: ‘wird sie den Korb vor sich
nicht tragen’, referring to CAD M/1 390a, s.v. massû A. I prefer rendering it according to
massû B ‘signal’, because this noun only appears together with the verb nasû, and all such us-
ages are in omen apodoses. Böck may have been deterred because AHw 619 (which ap-
peared in1972, ﬁve years before CAD M) lists all these occurrences under massû I 2 ‘Fürsten’.

ter than the shout of a foolish taskmaster.”
with nenbu†a ‘shining brightly’, is a variant on that word and is not explained by it. It does
seem to have some association with coloration, however.

The Woman of Valor and A Woman Large of Head
225
The ﬁrst woman is described more or less from head to foot, mentioning
her forehead, teeth, nose, lips, chin, hands and feet, and skin. The “tooth” is
obviously out of order, unless the lady is a freak, but it is possible that the word
sinni does not refer to a tooth but to some sort of tooth-shaped mark on the
forehead.11
The features of the second woman also are listed in order—forehead (?),12
nose, beard, and limbs—indicating that the break in the tablet followed by the
predicate adjective kabrat ‘is thick/fat’ was not a facial feature. A problem in
this description appears in the word ha†aªªat, translated by Böck (Morphoskopie)
as Frevlerin ‘is sinful’. This creates a difﬁculty because this woman has a positive
future, which we would not expect of a morally ﬂawed person. It is possible,
however, that this word means ‘physically defective’ and refers to the limbs.13
In other words, she has beautiful limbs but they are somehow defective.
Is either woman attractive? At ﬁrst glance it seems not. Cultural and personal
prejudices make it difﬁcult for a modern man to judge ancient Mesopotamian
standards of beauty without a much broader study than can be undertaken here.
Nonetheless, certain features seem to transcend the bounds of cultural condi-
tioning. Moreover, were we to compare our text with descriptions of women
in love poetry such as we ﬁnd in the biblical Song of Songs and the Mesopota-
mian and Egyptian texts that have been adduced as parallels, texts stating explic-
itly that the women are comely, there would be no doubt in our minds that
neither of the women in our passages is beautiful.14
If not beautiful per se, do these women have a “positive” appearance; that
is, do their appearances augur well for them? Böck has gathered the omens
with overtly positive apodoses from the complete text of WLH: ilanât ‘she is
divine’, isarru ‘she will become rich’, alidat ‘she is able to give birth’, libba †ibat
‘she is happy’, musallimat ‘she is able to complete pregnancy’, and so on, and
11. I would think ﬁrst of a marking shaped like the Aramaic letter sin. This should not
be excluded (see Michael Jursa and Michaela Weszeli, “Der ‘Zahn’ des Schreibers: Ein
aramäischer Buchstabenname in akkadischer Transkription,” ZA 90 [2000] 78–84; Michael
Jursa, “Weitere aramäische Buchstabennamen in akkadischer Überlieferung,” NABU 2002
no. 13), but we must bear in mind that in Alamdimmû III 76–133 (Böck, Morphoskopie, 92–
96), which lists graphic markings on the forehead, the marks are cuneiform signs rather than
Aramaic letters. Furthermore, the verb used is nadi ‘placed’ rather than aßi.
12. Böck (Morphoskopie) has restored the beginning of the line [diß pu?]-tu, probably im-
itating the beginning of the previous section. But it is difﬁcult to imagine what it means to
have a forehead, as if a woman could be missing a forehead. If the reconstruction is correct,
it may mean that the forehead is not marked and therefore fully visible, unlike the previous
section, in which the forehead is marked with a “tooth.”

has come up with the following composite of a woman whose physical fea-
tures (described in protases) individually augur well: a propitious woman can
have a birthmark on the left ear, thick armpits, convulsing arm muscles, long
hands and short ﬁngers, thick ﬁngers and toes, long toes, hand lines either
opening or going right and left, broad chest, distorted pelvis, big breasts with
pointed nipples, a longer left breast, small white nipples, white hair on the
belly, a soft navel perhaps bending to the left, hefty buttocks, thick vaginal lips,
and broad ankles. This woman may forecast a bright future for her man but,
in this writer’s humble opinion, can hardly be considered a heart-stopper. It
becomes quite obvious that in WHL, appearance is all important, but beauty
is of no signiﬁcance.
In our particular passages, the features mentioned by Böck do not appear,
so we are left to judge on our own, using information provided by the text
itself. The ﬁrst woman has motley skin, which is most likely not considered
beautiful, and a mark on her forehead. The second woman is described explic-
itly as “comely of limbs,” which is obviously a positive feature, but the addi-
tion, ha†aªªat ‘is defective’ (?) mars even that beauty. It is also hard to imagine
that a woman with a nose displaced to the right would be considered attractive
in any society, and the possession of a beard would obviously be unfeminine
and, ipso facto, unattractive or repelling. It seems, therefore, that each woman
may have certain attractive features, but neither would be a raving beauty,
whatever the viewer’s background is.
Only the behavior of the second woman is described in the protasis. She is
speciﬁcally described as soft spoken, which is positive (compare Eccl 9:17).15
To determine whether the pictures are positive or negative on the whole,
propitious or foreboding, we turn to the apodosis of each. Surprisingly, both
are largely positive, and certain clauses are identical or synonymous. As for pre-
dicted behavior and attitude, the ﬁrst lady is “close to the god” and “bright,” a
sign of happiness or cheery disposition.16 It is hard to know what a “twittering
heart” is, but it does not seem to be negative.17 The second lady is also de-
15. I could ﬁnd no Akkadian usages of nâhu describing speech.
16. See CAD N/1 214, s.v. namaru 2b.
17. Böck (Morphoskopie, 169 n. 603) comments that the translation is uncertain. To be
sure, the verb ßabaru is translated in CAD Í 2 ‘to be voluble, to prattle (said of lips), to twit-
ter (said of birds), to ﬂit, move quickly, to squint, look askance, signal with the eyes’. The
only place that this verb appears in some combination with ‘heart’ libbu is in a lexical text
(Nabnitu X 88) where ßubb/ppuru sa libbi occurs together with some gastrointestinal ail-
ments such as diarrhea, but this can hardly be suitable for our text. I would venture a guess
that it should be taken as the opposite of such verbs as nakadu ‘throb’, and galatu ‘twitch’,
which, when describing the heart, are signs of fear. If so, a twittering heart, one that beats
softly, may refer to calmness and contentment.

scribed as “bright of heart.” In addition, she is to walk constantly in happiness,
and something about her will be bright.
As for actions, including expected rewards, both women are promised that
a signal will not be raised in front of them, an allusion beyond my comprehen-
sion. Both are also promised prosperity: the ﬁrst that she will have barley and
silver, and the second that she will not want these commodities. The ﬁrst is to
have a long life, and about the second it is said that the ﬁr tree will get old.
This statement is obscure but may be a metaphor for old age18 and therefore
synonymous with the ﬁrst woman.
If we have interpreted these two passages in a reasonably proper manner,
we learn that both ladies have good futures ahead of them, although neither is
especially attractive. Bad looks do not necessary indicate a bad future.
We now turn to comparison with the biblical WV. What can the Akkadian
passage teach us about the biblical paean? The compositions are obviously
very different in just about every aspect and there is certainly no connection
between them, but there are several common features nonetheless.
Before beginning, I must confess to comparing and contrasting texts with
different geographical and chronological backgrounds and very different
genres and life-settings; and one may legitimately question such an undertak-
ing. This is to say nothing of the fact that the biblical passage describes the
ideal wife, a woman after marriage, a wife the way she should be, with a well-
established family and career.
It seems to me, however, that despite the differences the texts may serve
similar functions and certainly may reﬂect similar ideas. The WV paean is a
didactic piece, aimed at young men of marriageable age who are looking for
an ideal mate, mindful of her promise and potential for the years to come.19 It
may share a school, family, or even court setting with the rest of the book of
Proverbs. The Akkadian text, on the other hand, is a collection of omens with
no perceptible didactic aim, belonging on the surface of things to the magical,
cultic sphere of divination. Nonetheless, both have what can be called an ad-
visory function. In Mesopotamian culture, omens of all types were consulted
18. Possible symbolic meanings suggesting themselves for a ﬁr tree include fertility,
strength, and age. See CAD A/2 478, s.v. asuhu. In a symbolic self-imprecation from a treaty
(KBo 1 3 rev. 29), the participant says, “just as a ﬁr tree when it is cut down has no (further)
shoots, so may I, RN, together with my wife (etc.), like this ﬁr tree, have no offspring.”
This formulation implies that a ﬁr tree that has not been cut down is recognized for its
many offspring, making it a potential symbol of fertility. Other texts speak of ﬁr trees as
mighty (pagluti) and grown tall (sihuti).
19. Were a young lady to read it, she would certainly ﬁnd it revealing with regard to
what is expected when she is married.

for information in making proper decisions, and there is certainly no greater
decision in life than choosing a partner. Consequently, both texts should be
reliable indicators of what their respective societies considered desirable in a
woman, regardless of where they originated, making the comparison worthy
of pursuit. Böck has already made the plausible suggestion that the apodoses
in the Akkadian text are relevant speciﬁcally for future marriage, and the text
was in fact aimed at assisting in the selection of a desirable bride by indicating
which of the woman’s qualities boded well for the household she would en-
ter.20 In other words, a man seeking a woman who will give him what is
found in the apodoses should look for a woman who looks like someone in
the protases. Conversely, if a woman was marked by features described in the
protases, she would behave as the wife described in the apodoses. As for the
differences in the status of the women depicted—wife in WV and candidate
for marriage in WLH—we should remember that a serious young man look-
ing for a match should be interested, not only in what his intended is at the
time of matchmaking, but what she will be ultimately as a wife, and it is this
portrait that Prov 31:10–31 wishes to draw.
Bearing all this in mind, what can we learn from comparison? First of all, in
the apodoses, an overview of WLH in its entirety shows that the major themes
treated are: life expectancy, death, fertility and ability to complete pregnancy,
behavior, attitude toward life, and life-style—all of which relate to the woman
herself. In addition, there are predictions concerning the economic welfare and
demeanor of the man who will marry her, the house she enters, and the house
in which she lives. Finally, there are omen apodoses concerning her relation-
ship to the gods, possessions, wealth or poverty, and eating habits.21
Some of these themes are found in WV. A long life (bala†a urrak) seems to
be presumed by Prov 31:12, “She is good to him, not bad, all the days of her
life.” Ability to complete pregnancy and bear children (alidat musallimat) in
WLH is paralleled by the WV’s sons and daughters (vv. 15, 28).22 The favor-
able Mesopotamian woman is divine (ilanât) and righteous (isarat), while WV
is a woman who fears the Lord (v. 30).23 The Mesopotamian woman is suc-
20. See Böck (Morphoskopie, 58–59) for a discussion of the function and Sitz im Leben
of the omens about women. She concludes, “Somit stellt die Serie Summa sinnistu qaqqada
rabât ein einzigartiges Zeugnis der Kriterien für eine Eheschließung dar.”
21. For a synopsis of the apodoses, see Böck, Morphoskopie, 36–38.
22. Rofé (“A Virtuous Wife,” 384) points out that motherhood is not mentioned in
WV; but even he cannot deny the existence of children and the implied fertility of their
mother.
23. Rofé argues that the Septuagint gunhv sunethv read originally tlkcm hva ‘a success-
ful woman’, whereas hwhy tary hva is an editorial adjustment. If this is the case, then the
parallel between the descriptions is based on a late emendment of the biblical text.

cessful in whatever her hand touches (lipit qatisa issir), and the WV also has
very enterprising and successful hands (v. 13: “sets her hands to them with a
free will”; v. 16: “she plants a vineyard with her own palms”; v. 19: “she sets
her hands to the distaff, her palms work the spindle”; v. 20 “she stretches out
her palm to the poor”; and especially v. 31: “extol her for the fruit of her
hands”). In the second WLH passage cited above in particular we can compare
‘barley and silver she will not want’ (ihassah) with WV, whose trusting hus-
band will not be missing anything (v. 11: “and lacks no good thing”). In gen-
eral the Mesopotamian woman will be rich (isarru), see wealth (masrâ immar)
and proﬁt (nemala immar), and it is clear that WV is ﬁnancially well off. The
Mesopotamian woman eats regularly (akala sadra ikkal) and is sated by food
(akala isebbi), while WV provides sustenance for her house and regular food to
her lasses (v. 15: “she supplies provisions for her household, the daily fare for
her maids”). The Mesopotamian lady is of happy disposition (†ub libbi sakinsi)
and walks constantly in bright spirits (namris ittanallak), while WV smiles to the
last day, or “she looks to the future cheerfully” (v. 28). The second of the two
ladies in the WLH texts examined here is soft-spoken (ina dababisa nehat),
while WV opens her mouth with wisdom, and kindly teaching is on her
tongue (v. 26). It is clear, therefore, that what a Mesopotamian man looks for
in a wife resembles the qualities recommended for the WV. The favorable
Mesopotamian women and WV share many of the same blessings in life and
offer them to their potential husbands. We should point out, however, that
fertility and the ability to complete pregnancy are pronounced themes in
WLH, while in WV they are simply implied by the reference to children.
A striking thing about WLH in general and the two passages examined
here in particular is that the features auguring well for women, marking a
woman as desirable or undesirable, are pointedly not beauty. In fact, as we saw
above, a propitious woman can actually be quite homely or downright ugly.
This reminds us, of course, of the penultimate verse in WV (v. 30): “Charm is
a lie, and beauty is vane; a woman who fears the Lord, she will be praised.”
We may also mention in this connection Shimeon ben Gamliel’s dictum at the
end of m. Taºanit:24
There were no better days for Israel than the ﬁfteenth of Av and the Day of
Atonement, on which the Daughters of Israel went out in white, borrowed
clothes so as not to embarrass those who had none. . . . And the Daughters of
Israel would go out and dance in the vineyards. And what would they say?
“Young man! Look and see what you choose for yourself. Look not at the
beauty (ywn); look at the pedigree.”
24. I am grateful to my colleague Dr. Edward Fram for reminding me of this passage.

Although they share some themes and purposes, there is certainly no genetic
link between the two texts from the biblical-Judaic tradition and the Akkadian
composition. So one cannot say that one inﬂuenced the other. In fact, the
view reﬂected is probably universal. But all reﬂect a view, each for its own
reasons, that physical beauty is not important in choosing a bride. Beauty has
a place in romantic love, as we ﬁnd in Song of Songs and similar texts from the
ancient Near East. But the texts involved in selecting brides not only ignore it
but explicitly (WV, m. Taºan.) or implicitly (WLH) reject it. All three texts
make a most important statement for both men and women. On the one
hand, they enable and encourage young men to look beyond their superﬁcial
perception to ﬁnd a woman of quality, be it lyj, pedigree, or positively por-
tentous features. From the feminine perspective, they liberate young women
from the necessity and mental anguish of trying to be beautiful to catch a man
as well as lack of self-esteem and other such woes. They make “the girl next
door” as eligible a catch as a Hollywood starlet. Going back to the immortal
words of young Hodel in the epigraph: young girl that she is, she dreams of
physical beauty, but Papa and Mama realize that there are more important
things in life than looks. And so it was in the ancient Near East.
The dependence on omens as a criterion in matchmaking raises a question:
did not WHL, which was deterministic in nature, doom certain women to
spinsterhood? Not every woman augurs favorably, and who would want to
marry a woman whose very appearance presages family disaster? Such a
woman would be the equivalent in the ancient mind of a known bearer of a
hereditary disorder in present-day perceptions. This would be true, of course,
if a mate was chosen blindly on the basis of a single sign. However, it is well
known that in Mesopotamian divination, no individual omen was taken as an
exclusive indicator but was always interpreted in combination with other signs
pointing in various directions. Moreover, divination was essentially binary, an-
swering yes or no, and omens were considered either positive or negative, so
the details of a particular prediction were not very important. Most important,
omens could be and often were manipulated in their interpretation, so an an-
cient Mesopotamian matchmaker working on the basis of WLH and personal
interpretive skill would certainly be able to make any lady into a desirable
catch, not unlike Yentel from Fiddler, who manages to ﬁnd a saving grace even
in the most dismal of her offerings.
I cannot adduce evidence of this kind of manipulation in Akkadian physi-
ognomic omens, but a good example of “manipulating” a woman’s appear-
ance for good in order to enable marital relations appears in the Babylonian
Talmud, b. Nedarim 66b:25
25. This translation is taken from Geller, “West Meets East,” 72–73. Geller does not
relate it to WLH, but he points out that its examination of the woman from head to toe
resembles descriptions in omens.

“A man once said to his wife, ‘I vow that you will not beneﬁt from me [i.e.,
have sexual intercourse] until you show something beautiful [hpy] in yourself to
R. Ishmael, son of R. Jose.’
“He said to them: ‘Perhaps her head is beautiful?’ ‘It is round,’ they replied.
“‘Perhaps her hair is beautiful?’ ‘(It is) like stalks of ﬂax.’
“‘Perhaps her eyes are beautiful?’ ‘They are bleared.’
“‘Perhaps her ears are beautiful?’ ‘They are folded over.’
“‘Perhaps her nose is beautiful?’ ‘It is obstructed.’
“‘Perhaps her lips are beautiful?’ ‘They are thick.’
“‘Perhaps her neck is beautiful?’ ‘It is stubby.’
“‘Perhaps her belly is beautiful?’ ‘It protrudes.’
“‘Perhaps her feet are beautiful?’ ‘They are as broad as those of a duck.’
“‘Perhaps her name is beautiful?’ ‘It is Liklukit’ [a thick, nauseating 
substance].
“Said he to them, ‘It is appropriate [hpy] that they call her Liklukit, since she is
ugly [tklklm] because of her defects’; and so he ‘untied’ her [from her hus-
band]” [that is, released him from his vow, thereby permitting him to resume
relationships].
This woman is obviously as ugly as sin, with no redeeming physical charms.
Liklukit is no Miss Babylonia.26 Nonetheless, R. Ishmael is able to release her
husband from his vow of abstinence by ﬁnding “beauty” in her name. Cer-
tainly the experienced Mesopotamian omen interpreters would have been
able to do the same with their unsightly daughters, giving new meaning to

The Fly and the Dog: 
Observations on Ideational Polarity 
in the Book of Qoheleth
Tova Forti

Qoheleth’s canonical position was discussed among the rival schools of Hil-
lel and Shammai, and its inclusion in the Hebrew canon was approved ex post
facto by the former (m. Yad. 3:5, ºEd. 5:3; b. Meg. 7a).1 Two primary argu-
ments against admitting Qoheleth into the canon, due to its perceived lack of
divine inspiration, appear in rabbinic sources. The ﬁrst is that the book is not
internally coherent (b. Sabb. 30b), and the second is that the views expressed
are too heretical (Qoh. Rab. 1:3; 11:9; Num. Rab. 161b).2 It seems that the ac-
tual acceptance of the book among the canonical books of the Bible was due
to the ancient Jewish tradition that the author of the book of Qoheleth was
King Solomon, the son of David, king of Jerusalem (Eccl 1:1, 12; Cant. Rab.
1:1, 10), the archetype of the wise. Another no-less-important explanation for
its inclusion may stem from the presence of the orthodox statement in the
closing verses of the book (12:12–14; see b. Sabb. 30b).
Qoheleth’s apparent lack of internal coherence that was not lost on the an-
cient rabbis, is a recurring issue in modern scholarship. Different voices are
heard in the book: one voice, in which the author refers to himself in the ﬁrst
person, and another that refers to Qoheleth in the third person. But beyond
the nonuniform style, a more serious literary problem concerns the dissonance
between conservative statements with regard to various phenomena of life, on
1. The school of Shammai pronounced the scroll of Qoheleth clean, and the school of
Hillel pronounced it unclean according to the rule µydyh ta ˆyamfm vdqh ybtk lk ‘All Holy
Scriptures deﬁle the hands [or render them unclean]’; thus the dispute over Qoheleth was
considered one of the points on which the school of Shammai was more lax than the school
of Hillel. See C. H. H. Wright, Book of Koheleth (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1883) 3–
27, 470–74.

the one hand, and skeptical observations that contradict the traditional beliefs,
on the other hand. The skeptical voice has been attributed to the original au-
thor, seen as the µkj ‘sage’, while the conservative views have been attributed
to a dysj, a pious glossator, or even to several glossators or editors.3 Another
approach that attributes the contradictory voices to the same author offers two
main, different solutions for the above inconsistencies in the book: (a) The au-
thor creates a dialogue of debate by quoting traditional standard views in order
to contradict them. The dialogue is conducted with either a genuine or a ﬁc-
tional interlocutor.4 (b) The author expresses one person’s reﬂections from the
perspective of changing stages in his life and in accordance with the develop-
ing changes in his own world view.5 It follows that the conﬂicting points of
view in the discourses of the book express a dialogue between Qoheleth and
himself.
Qoheleth formulates his ideas a priori. He sets up a wide variety of expres-
sive modes for his personal observations and introduces his perceptions while
sketching a procedure for investigation. For example, he writes, “I set my
mind to study and to probe with wisdom all that happens under the sun”
(1:13);6 “and so I set my mind to appraise wisdom and to appraise madness
and folly” (1:17); “for all this I noted, and I ascertained all this” (9:1). Qo-
heleth’s confessional, monologue style is characterized by a string of sentences
connected by means of coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunc-
tions. For example, he uses the particle -v≤ along with rva, not only as a rela-
tive particle as in the older biblical texts, but as a conjunction introducing the
subject of an object clause, which is typical of late Biblical Hebrew.7

The Fly and the Dog: Observations on Ideational Polarity in Qoheleth
237
Scholars have tried to discern a well-planned composition divided into
separate units.8 It is difﬁcult however, to demarcate the individual pericopes.
Often we can observe a continuous ﬂow of thought in the argumentation of a
literary unit, whereas in other instances the thematic continuity appears to be
forced. Taking into consideration the complexity of this issue, it seems to me
preferable to read the relevant texts in their original order and to evaluate the
contents of each pericope in its original place.
The main concern of this essay is to evaluate the rhetorical impact on Qo-
heleth’s sermon of two ﬁgurative aphorisms that have been shaped by fauna
imagery (9:4 and 10:1). An examination of the syntactical and thematic setting
of these two sayings within their literary pericopes will stimulate further dis-
cussion regarding two well-known scholarly debates concerning Qoheleth:
a. Ideational aspect. The possible sources of and explanations for Qoheleth’s
contradictory statements as noted brieﬂy above.
b. Compositional-editorial aspect. The identiﬁcation of the limits or, alterna-
tively, the extent of each thematic unit in the planned, inner structure
of the book.
The demarcation of the literary unit provides a key for understanding it as a
whole, as well as for assessing the role of the imagery contained within it.
Stated differently, the identiﬁcation of the thematic unit aids in understanding
the reciprocal relationships between the whole and its parts, so that the func-
tions of the component elements themselves contribute toward comprehend-
ing the form of the literary unit.9
Following Weiss’s methodology, I will read Qoheleth in its accepted format,
without committing myself to any of the scholarly hypotheses to resolve the in-
ternal contradictions of the book. For the division into thematic units, I will be
guided by Qoheleth’s own method of investigation: positing the thesis, moving
to the antithesis or to a restrictive statement, and ﬁnally presenting the deduc-
tion. The thematic development is followed by an analysis of key terms and
other literary features. The latter include catchwords, repetitions, and phrases

43–47.
9. I follow Meir Weiss, who applies the critical principles of the “Total Interpretation”
method of the New Criticism (Die Werkinterpretation ‘close reading’) school to the under-
standing of the biblical text. See M. Weiss, The Bible from Within: The Method of Total Inter-
pretation ( Jerusalem: Magnes, 1984) 1–73; idem, “Die Methode der ‘Total Interpretation’:
Von der Nowendigkeit der Struktur-Analyse für das Verständnis der biblischen Dichtung,”

and concepts used by means of juxtaposition and contrast (such as youth and
old age, Eccl 11:9–12:7), all of which bind the subject unit together.
We turn ﬁrst to 9:13–10:1, which raises the question of the advantage of
wisdom over foolishness. Despite its thematic unity, it presents a wide variety
of literary patterns and stylistic features: the parabolic narrative (9:14–15), the
proverbial metaphor (10:1); two “better proverbs” (9:16a, 18a), one “better
proverb” without the characteristic, stylistic element bwf ‘better’ (9:17); and
two formulas introducing the theoretical debate (9:13 and 9:16aa).10
With the words “this thing too I observed under the sun about wisdom,
and it affected me profoundly” (9:13), the author introduces an instance of
wisdom that appears as a great source of wonder to him. The illustrative back-
ground for this assertion is provided by the parable of the king and the poor
wise man (9:14–15). The sense of amazement is echoed by the story of the
poor wise man that has saved (or might have saved) the entire city through his
wisdom and has overcome the great king and his warriors. But even more
amazing is the fact that, in the ﬁnal analysis, no one remembers the poor man
who saved the city through his wise council.11
The thematic unit 9:13–10:1 consists of a parable (vv. 14–15) and a cluster
of proverbial sayings (9:13, 16–18; 10:1b), whose main theme is the advantage
of wisdom and counsel over both military might and foolishness.
The book of Proverbs, as well as Ecclesiastes, praises wisdom over military
might, as in Prov 21:22, “One wise man prevailed over a city of warriors and
brought down its mighty stronghold,” and 20:18, “Plans laid in council will
succeed; / Wage war with stratagems.”12 Moreover, Proverbs also indicates that
it is more praiseworthy to overcome evil impulses than to exhibit bravery on
the battleﬁeld: “Better to be forbearing than mighty, to have self-control than
10. On the delineation of the literary unit 9:13–10:1, see R. Gordis, Koheleth: The Man
and His World (New York: Schocken, 1968) 309; R. B. Y. Scott, Ecclesiastes (AB 18; New
York: Doubleday, 1981) 247; Fox includes the fool sayings in the literary unit 9:13–10:3
(Qohelet and His Contradictions, 261–62). Ogden compares subunits 9:17–18 and 10:1–4
and ﬁnds thematic parallels, such as wisdom versus folly; wisdom’s superiority (9:17; 10:2–
4) against wisdom’s vulnerability (9:18b; 10:1). He also calls attention to stylistic parallels,
such as repeated words, chiastic structures, antitheses (e.g., single error vs. much of value),
and the keyword bl ‘heart’. G. Ogden, Qoheleth (Readings; Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic
Press, 1987) 163–64. G. A. Barton includes 10:1 in the literary unit 10:1–20, entitled “Ad-
vice concerning one’s attitude toward rulers,” whereas the genuine portions are 10:4–7,
14b, 16, 17, 20, and the interpolations are the rest (The Book of Ecclesiastes [ICC; Edinburgh:
T. & T. Clark, 1908] 169).

to conquer a city” (Prov 16:32). The collection of sayings in Eccl 9:16–18 thus
proves to be an embedded cluster within a contemplative discussion of the
value of wisdom in the literary section 9:13–10:1. The sayings share a com-
mon idea that assesses the relative value of wisdom vis-à-vis bravery on the
battleﬁeld. The opening clause of both sayings states the advantages of wis-
dom, whereas the closing clause declares that there are limitations to this truth.
The structure of the pattern is a “better proverb” + oppositional waw + a re-
strictive saying. The waw actually precedes a circumstantial clause that limits
the main assertion of the “better proverb” pronounced in the opening clause:
Eccl 9:16: Wisdom is better than valor + but a poor man’s wisdom is scorned, and
his words are not heeded.
Eccl 9:18: Wisdom is better than weapons of war + but one sinner destroys much
good.13 (rsv)
The middle saying of the triplet of sayings (9:17) expresses the logical para-
digm of the “better proverb” without presenting the stylistic morpheme bwf
‘better’. In contrast to the other two sayings, this saying declares an absolute
appreciation of the gentle mode of expression pronounced by wise people:
“The words of the wise spoken gently are heard more than the shout of a ruler
among fools” (9:17).14
The ideational tension of the contradiction between the recommendation
to be wise and the limits of wisdom’s advantage provides a dialectical garb for
the literary unit under discussion. Let us take a closer look at the distribution
of the juxtaposed antonyms in the verses:15
Antitheses in the parable about the king (9:14):
little city, few men π great king, mighty siege works
poor wise man π great king
Antitheses in the sayings unit (vv. 16–18):
wisdom π valor
poor man’s wisdom π scorned
wise men π foolish ruler
spoken softly π shouted
wisdom π weapons of war
single π much

The sayings in praise of wisdom (vv. 17, 18) can indeed be interpreted as in-
dependent sayings juxtaposed by free association. However, their common
feature of contrasting the relationship between wisdom and folly by employ-
ing the stylistic pattern of the “better proverb” echoes the same ideational ten-
sion conveyed through the parable of the king’s siege of the town and its
rescue by the commoner sage.
We can interpret the saying in v. 17 of the advantage of the sage’s gentle
words over the shout of a ruler among fools against the backdrop of the par-
able of the mighty king and the clever counsel offered by the lowly commoner
(vv. 14–15). The same arrogant attitude of a screaming ruler among fools is
echoed by the conceited behavior of the great king who besieged the city and
built great siege works against it (v. 14).
The opening clause of another saying declares wisdom to be superior to
“weapons of war” (v. 18a). This assertion also elicits the story of the poor wise
man who overcame the strong king. But the second half of the saying, “but a
single error destroys much of value” (v. 18b), questions the categorical asser-
tion that wisdom always prevails. Rashbam explicates dja afwj ‘one sinner’ as
being linked to the lowly wise man of the parable in a relationship of opposi-
tion: just as this poor wise man saves the city through his sagacity, so does one
sinner destroy much good.16 And indeed the afwj ‘sinner’ is often evaluated
in wisdom literature as one who assumes an errant attitude, speciﬁcally one
who exhibits negative behavioral characteristics and a lack of social concern,
such as overweening pride and self-conﬁdence (Prov 14:21; 20:2) or haste and
lack of consideration in action (Prov 19:2). The word afwj ‘sinner’ (Prov
8:36) borrows its meaning from “missing the target” as expressed in the verse,
“Every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss” ( Judg 20:16b).
A note is appended to the story of the wisdom of the common wise man
that saves the little city. This touches on the position of the lowly wise man as
seen by others in retrospect: “Yet no one remembered that poor man” (v. 15c).
In fact, biblical commentators are divided regarding whether the verse refers
to the wisdom of the poor man that was not taken advantage of to save the city
because he was poor, or to the fact that the wisdom was forgotten later and
was not appreciated enough. The past tense of the verb flm ‘saved’ is evidence
that the poor man did indeed save the city through his wisdom, which was
subsequently forgotten by his fellow townspeople. In attempting to make the
16. Rashbam also identiﬁes the “fools” (v. 17b) in relation to the context of the “mighty
siege works” of the ruler (v. 17b) in the parable of the little city: “For they are fools because
they have no wise counsel to overcome the strategy of this man, who is poor and wise”
(Qoheleth, 112–13).

The Fly and the Dog: Observations on Ideational Polarity in Qoheleth

oppositional stich suit the context, v. 16 (“a poor man’s wisdom is scorned,
and his words are not heeded”) interprets the story as one in which the towns-
people did not heed the poor man’s advice, and his wisdom was of no use.
The phrase awh flmw ‘he who saved’ is then explained in this context as a hy-
pothetical condition: if only they had listened to his words, he could have
saved the city.17 This sober, realistic tone describing the poor unfortunate
man’s position in the eyes of society shows that there are limits to the advan-
tage of wisdom. The appreciative words in the parable are formulated accord-
ing to the pattern of the “better proverb,” stated in ﬁrst person: “So I
observed: Wisdom is better than valor; but . . .” (9:16a). The continuation of
these words overturns the appreciative tone by recognizing the scorned posi-
tion of the poor wise man whose words are not heard: “A poor man’s wisdom
is scorned, and his words are not heeded” (9:16b). In both instances, the wise
man does not get the recompense he justly deserves. Either society forgets the
wise man in retrospect after following his advice that saved the city de facto,
or the townspeople scorn his advice at the onset of the siege and refuse to heed
his counsel (v. 15c).
The scales in the “better proverb” weigh in favor of “words spoken gently
by wise men” over the “the shout of a ruler among fools” (see v. 17). On the
surface, it seems unsuitable and does not ﬁt well with the poor wise man’s dis-
appointment at not being given the reward he so richly deserves in the parable
of the king: “but nobody thought of that poor man” (v. 15c). However, there
is a contradiction between the wisdom saying and the parable of the poor wise
man that expresses the dialectical tension between reality and ideal.18 Although
there is an ideal of wisdom, forces of reality operate against it. Although the
counsel of the poor wise man is worthy of society’s valuation without any con-
nection to his very low socioeconomic level, the fact is that striving for a just
reward does not always withstand the test of reality.19
Both parable and sayings share a similar dialectical tension that establishes a
thematic unity. The adjacent sayings show an ideational association between the
single error that destroys much of value and the “ruler among fools” (18b); both
express support of wisdom (v. 18a) and its spokespeople (v. 17a); juxtaposed to

rule and the exception” (Ecclesiastes, 322).
19. Similar to the ungrateful attitude of society to the wise adviser (9:15b, 16b), com-
pare the skeptical approach by Qoheleth to the material gains of the wise: “nor wealth by
the intelligent” (9:11). For a discussion on the wise in Qoheleth, see Fox, Qohelet and His
Contradictions, 114, 207, 262.

these is the critical outlook on the damage produced by that “one sinner” and
the “ruler among fools.”
We must now consider the placement of the proverbial metaphor “dead
ﬂies turn the perfumer’s ointment fetid and putrid” (10:1a), within the literary
unit 9:13–10:1. The word bwbz ‘ﬂy’ is the generic name for the insect species
Brachycera and is the onomatopoetic noun mimicking the noise of the insect’s
ﬂight.20 The female of the species lays eggs that hatch into maggots, legless lar-
vas that develop either into rotting materials or into parasites feeding on other
living animals. Maggots weave cocoons from which a ﬂy emerges after several
days. Flies multiply extremely rapidly, especially under primitive health con-
ditions and therefore are all the more injurious to human beings by carrying
many, many germs.
The word bwbz appears in the Hebrew Bible twice: Eccl 10:1 and Isa 7:18.
In the prophecy to Ahaz (Isa 7:10–25), Isaiah compares the Assyrian armies’
onslaught to the ﬂies and the bees that alight “in the rugged wadis, and in the
clefts of the rocks, and in all the thornbrakes, and in all the watering places.”
The irksome nature of hordes of stinging insects seems to inspire the prophet’s
imagery.21
In some of the instances of maggots and worms in the Bible, ﬂies’ maggots
are hinted at, so it seems that ancient peoples knew that ﬂies emerged from the
maggots.22 The description of the manna, “So they put it aside until morning,
as Moses had ordered; and it did not turn foul, and there were no maggots in
it” (Exod 16:24), describes the rotting process that can be attributed to the ac-
tivity of ﬂies’ maggots.23 In texts that describe meat rotting due to maggots,
the latter may be identiﬁed as the larval stage of ﬂies that destroy the ﬂesh of
20. For the bwbz ‘ﬂy’ in Akkadian, see zumbu (zunbu, zubbu), CAD Z 155. The Aramaic
denominative verb bbd (from the noun abbyd, abdwd ‘ﬂy’) expresses the idea of moving
and shaking.

ering of the gods over the performer of the sacriﬁce is compared both in the Gilgamesh
Epic (XI 161) and in Homer’s Iliad (2.469–73) to swarming hordes of ﬂies.

as maggots is attested by a papyrus found placed in the mouth of an Egyptian mummy:
“The worms will not become ﬂies within you.” See F. S. Bodenheimer, Ha-˙ay beªarßôt Ha-
mikra ( Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1965) 1:116 [Hebrew]. On Aristotle’s knowledge of the
larval stage as an insect’s form of procreation, see Aristotle, Gen. an. 3.9.758b. Aristotle
states that the ﬂy is created from the garbage (Hist. an. 5.721).
23. It may be that the verse meant the drosophila maggots, the “fruit ﬂies” found in over-
ripe fruit when it begins to turn sour. See M. Dor, Ha-˙ay bymêy Ha-mikra, 202.

the dead: “My ﬂesh is covered with maggots and clods of earth; / My skin is
broken and festering” ( Job 7:5; cf. Isa 14:11; 2 Macc 9:9).
The ﬂy appears in a wide range of talmudic sources as a loathsome creature,
atwsyam bwbz ‘disgusting ﬂy’, that disseminates infectious diseases (b. Ketub.
77b). A case of a ﬂy that falls into a dish can even serve as a sufﬁcient pretext
for divorce (b. Gi†. 6b).
 The proverbial metaphor in Qoheleth, “Dead ﬂies turn the perfumer’s
ointment fetid and putrid” (10:1), appears as the plural construct twm ybwbz
‘ﬂies of death’ (10:1), that is, ﬂies that deserve to die or are destined to die.
However, the plural noun is not in agreement with the third-person singular
verbs çyaby ‘will spoil’ and [yby ‘will bubble’. The disagreement in number is
exacerbated by the comparison of “a little folly” in the second clause of the
verse to “ﬂies” in the opening clause.
The asyndeton [yby çyaby has created syntactical and, thus, hermeneutic
problems. Ibn Ezra deﬁnes [yby ‘bubble’ as a transitive verb: “and the stink
shall not cease because the ﬂies will continue to bubble up.” Others read [yby
as dittography with çyaby or as an interpolation of an explanatory gloss of the
linguistic difﬁculty. Therefore, they omit [yby entirely. Still others emend the
verb [yby to [ybg ‘goblet’, due to the asyndetic nature in the string of verbs
[yby çyaby.24
Luzzatto, in his commentary on Ecclesiastes in Me˙qerey Ha-yahadut from
1820, proposed a redivision of the existing possessive compound into a noun
and a verb, twmy bwbz ‘a ﬂy will die’; this division is more compatible with the
idea of the damage of ‘a little folly’.25 Others propose the reading twm bwbz
‘mortal ﬂy’, designating someone who is destined to die, similar to the com-
pound expression twm ˆb ‘mortal’ (1 Sam 20:31; 2 Sam 2:5).26
24. Scholars’ suggestion to omit [yby as dittography is supported by the ancient versions
of Symm., the Aram. Tg., and the Vg. BHS suggests emending [yby to [ybg ‘goblet’ or
‘vessel’. The LXX reads as a noun, skeuasÇan ‘preparation’, as reﬂected also by the Syr.
reading of anqwt ‘vessel’ or ‘container’. The word [ybg ‘goblet’ or ‘vessel’ is also interpreted
as a metonym for its contents; see R. Saºadiya Gaon (Rasag), who translates it as a noun, a
container of oil. See H. Louis Ginsberg, Koheleth (Tel Aviv: Newman, 1961) 119 [He-
brew]; Scott, Ecclesiastes, 248; Fox, Qohelet and His Contradictions, 265.
25. Shmuel David Luzzatto (Shadal), Me˙qerey Ha-yahadut, vol. 1: Divrey Qohelet (War-
saw: Ha-zeﬁra, 1913) 100 [Hebrew]. Ginsberg follows Luzzatto in proposing the reading
twmy bwbz ‘a ﬂy about to die’, similar to the pattern of twmy çwna ‘a mortal man’ (Isa 51:12).
See Ginsberg, Koheleth, 119; Fox, Qohelet and His Contradictions, 261. C. F. Whitley sup-
ports the reading bwbz ‘a ﬂy’, emphasizing its suitable counterbalance twlks f[m ‘a little
folly’ (Koheleth: His Language and Thought [BZAW 148; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1979] 83).

The saying conjures up a picture of dead ﬂies that fall into precious, high-
quality oil, making it putrid and spoiling it. The concise formulation of the de-
scription provides it with the character of an aphorism. Consequently, the
reader is not required to reexamine its empirical truth but to implement its cog-
nitive pattern and take in its moral message by drawing the appropriate analogy.
The term jqwr ˆmç indicates a concoction of oils and fragrant spices (cf. Exod
30:25), whose delicate qualities are ruined by dead ﬂies falling into it.27
Closely connected to the proverbial metaphor is an additional saying that
may be explained in relation to the analogy in a chiastic structure:
Dead ﬂies turn the perfumer’s ointment fetid and putrid (10:1a)
So a little folly outweighs massive wisdom (10:1b)
This second stich opens with the adjective rqy, which may be informed by the
Aramaic epithet ryqy, meaning both ‘honorable’ and ‘heavy’. The Targum ren-
ders atmkwj†ˆm ryty ryqyw ‘the value is heavier [or more honorable] than wis-
dom’, thus keeping the pattern of the “better proverb.”28 Fox proposes adding
27. Ogden interprets jqwr as a participle “describing one who blends aromatic com-
pounds, hence ‘perfumer’ (rsv)” (Qoheleth, 164). See jqrh ˆyy ‘spiced wine’ (rsv; Song
8:2). The phrase jqwr ˆmv ‘perfumer’s oil’ aided in the reconstruction of the Ug. lection
smn rq[˙] in UT 3:21 and sm[n] rq˙ in UT 120:5. That these readings are correct has been
conﬁrmed by the unpublished Ugaritic Tablet RS 24.643:21 with the phrase lg smn rq˙ ‘a
log of perfumers oil’. See M. Dahood, “The Phoenician Background of Qoheleth,” Bib 47
(1966) 278.
28. On rqy corresponding to dbk in Aramaic, see hryqy (Dan 2:11) as well as Ahiqar and
Aramaic papyri (see A. E. Cowley, Aramaic Papyri of the Fifth Century b.c. [repr.; Osnabrück:
Zeller, 1967] 290, col. A [index]). Rashi and Rashbam compare rqy, in the sense of heavy
property, to twrqy ‘choice’ [stones] (1 Kgs 5:31). For the association between dwbk and dbk
as property, see Gen 31:1; Isa 10:3; 61:6; 66:11, 12; Nah 2:10; Ps 49:17, 18. The same an-
tithesis between the borrowed meanings of dbk and lq appears between the antonyms dwbk
‘honor’ and ˆwlq ‘disgrace’ (Prov 3:35) as well as dbka and wlqy (1 Sam 2:30).

the Bible the irregular singular verb plus a plural noun is used to denote each separate act
of the singular. For example, rwç yl[ hd[x twnb ‘its branches run over the wall’ (rsv; Gen
49:22) and also Exod 31:14, Lev 17:14, Isa 2:18, and Eccl 2:7. Delitzsch decides in favor of
the reading twm ybwbz ‘death-ﬂies’, ‘poisonous ﬂies’ as described by the LXX mu∂ai qanatouÅ-
sai ‘pestilent ﬂies’, emphasizing the intentional dramatic effect of the simile in analogy to
damage caused by a little folly. See F. Delitzsch, Ecclesiastes (trans. M. G. Easton; Grand Rap-
ids: Eerdmans, 1960) 370–71. K. Budde compares twm ybwbz with other compound expres-
sions, such as: twm ylk ‘deadly weapons’ (Ps 7:14) and twm ylbj ‘snares of death’ (Ps 18:5)
(Die Fünf Megillot [Freiburg: Mohr, 1898]) 155; cf. Wright, The Book of Koheleth, 417–18.
Fox argues against the reading twm bwbz ‘mortal ﬂy’: “But ﬂies are not deadly . . . nor is it
relevant that they are doomed” (Qohelet and His Contradictions, 264).

rqy as an accompanying epithet to jqr ˆmç and to emend from dwbkm to dbkt,
as follows: f[m twlks dbkt hmkjm rqy jqr ˆmç [ybg çyaby twmy bwbz ‘a dead ﬂy
will make a vessel of precious perfumer’s oil putrid, a little folly outweighs
massive wisdom’.29
This parable compares dead ﬂies to a little folly, and the ﬁne ointment is
compared to wisdom and honor. The damage caused by a small creature, val-
ueless and scorned, such as a ﬂy, to high-quality perfumer’s ointment is com-
pared to the severity of the damage of a little folly that overcomes wisdom and
honor.30
The proverbial metaphor of the dead ﬂy acts in close association with the
closing stich of the previous saying, “but one sinner destroys much good”
(9:18b); in other words, the degree of damage caused by one misdemeanor
alone is compared to the damage caused by dead ﬂies falling into a vessel of
high-quality oil (cf. 10:1). Hence, the proverbial metaphor of dead ﬂies falling
into ointment is embedded as a kind of concretizing device that functions as
fable and moral in illuminating the closing stiches of both sayings that sur-
round it:
One sinner destroys much good (9:18b)
A little folly outweighs massive wisdom (10:1b)31
Both analogical sayings describe limitations of the “better” status of wisdom
because they propose sober examination of reality, whereby sin and folly (wis-
dom’s natural, primary enemies) are likely to prevail.
The picturesque image of the small ﬂies that ruin an entire vessel of ﬁne oil
is intended to illustrate the disproportionate relationship between size and
negative effect. Therefore, people should not underestimate how much dam-
age “a single sinner” or “a little folly” may bring about.
The fable of the king and the poor wise man (9:14–15) and the ﬂy parable
(10:1) deal with precisely the same matter: evaluation of the inﬂuential power
of wisdom on vital aspects of life. The appeal to all of the senses by both
29. Fox’s emendation breaks the asyndeton dwbkm hmkjm that shapes the closing stich in
the paradigm of a “better proverb” (Qohelet and His Contradictions, 265).

comparative waw (Prov 22:1; 26:3, 8, 14) or the comparative morphemes ˆk . . . k (Prov
26:1, 8; 27:18).
31. On the role of the proverb in its context, see J. L. Crenshaw, Ecclesiastes, 169; Fox,
Qohelet and His Contradictions, 264–65. Loader uses the term tertium comparationis to desig-
nate the common feature of the image and its analogue (Polar Structures, 60). In this case,
the tiny size of the small ﬂies and the smallness of the folly are compared.

parables successfully evokes the intensity of the confrontation between Wis-
dom and her adversaries.32
The proverbial metaphor contains antithetic terms, as demonstrated with
regard to the parable about the king (9:14) and the sayings unit (vv. 16–18):
fetid, putrid π perfumer’s ointment
little π heavy and precious
wisdom, honor π folly
In addition to Qoheleth’s method of juxtaposing two contradictory statements
that evoke a speculative debate, Qoheleth fashions his proverbial narrative in a
garb of intrusive and challenging vocabulary:
çyaby: The root çab refers to fetid odor caused by the rot or spoilage of
solid food (Exod 16:20) or liquids (Exod 7:21; Eccl 10:1). But the extended
meaning of the root çab is disgraceful behavior: “A righteous man hates false-
hood, but a wicked man acts shamefully and disgracefully” (rsv; Prov 13:5,
and see Gen 34:30 and 2 Sam 16:21). Here çab uniﬁes both levels: parable
and lesson.
[yby: The verb is in the Hiphil form of the primae nun root [bn ‘ﬂow’, al-
though its context suits the wuu[ verbs and the [uu[ verbs [wb and [[b meaning
to ‘bubble up’ and ‘froth’.33 The latter root would be appropriate for a de-
scription of foaming, that is, effervescence and foam on the surface of the liq-
uid due to a ﬂy falling into it. The inﬁnitive of [bn expresses the bubbling up
of springwater, as in the “torrid earth shall become a pool, parched land, foun-
tains of water” (Isa 35:7a; cf. 49:10), but the root [bn is also a borrowed ex-
pression. Both meanings appear in this saying: “the words of a man’s mouth
are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a gushing stream” (rsv; Prov 18:4).
The secondary use of [bn can be found in regard to negative types of people,
fools and malicious people: “the tongue of the wise dispenses knowledge, but
the mouths of fools pour out folly” (Prov 15:2); “the mind of the righteous
ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things”
(Prov 15:28).
jqr ˆmç: The high-quality oil (ˆmv) is connected to the good reputation
(µv´) of the wise man, as the “better proverb” states using assonance µv´, ˆmv:
“a good name (µv´) is better than precious oil (ˆmv)” (Eccl 7:1a). Anointing
32. Rashbam (Qoheleth, 113) creates a hermeneutic link between the parable of the ﬂy
(10:1) and the fable of the king who mounts a siege against a little city with his army (9:14–
15), expressing the application of the principle of divine retribution. He claims that the im-
age of the ﬂies, “insects good for nothing,” is compared by Qoheleth with a sinful ruler
who is not worthy of his throne.

one’s head with oil concretizes Qoheleth’s call to celebrate and enjoy life: “let
your clothes always be freshly washed, and your head never lack oil” (Eccl
9:8).34 Thus the proverb states, “precious treasure and oil are in the house of
the wise man, and a fool of a man will run through them” (Prov 21:20). The
latter verse describes the oil as a desirable treasure that the wise man deems pre-
cious, while his polar opposite squanders it (cf. Prov 21:17). The use of the
verb [bn in the proverb in relation to dead ﬂies that pollute precious oils arouses
the associative meaning of the archetypical fool, the evildoer, and the slan-
derer as depicted in wisdom proverbs. Included in this category are dja afwj
‘one sinner’ and lysk ‘the fool’, who are compared to the ﬂy that putreﬁes the
ointment.
The rhetorical use of words that are polar opposites, backed up by double
meanings and opposition between proximate proverbs in the unit, provides a
very lively and exciting character to the dialectical discussion. The reader is re-
quired to delve into the contextual meaning of the key words. The careful
reader must take a new look at the advantage of wisdom in light of the realities
of human life.
My second discussion concerns the idea that it is better to be among the
living than among the dead. The closing unit of chap. 8, vv. 16–17, discusses
the limitations of human intelligence in understanding divine deeds, even
when it is a wise person who attempts to understand God’s works under the
sun. The discussion of the limitations of human knowledge continues into the
beginning of chap. 9, which opens with Qoheleth’s ﬁrst-person observation
style, “I set my heart” (9:1a). This formula gives voice to inner reﬂections, ru-
minations, and experiential impressions from life phenomena, from which
Qoheleth ﬁnally draws his conclusion.35
Chapter 9 opens with a general summarizing statement, hz lk ta yk ‘for all
this’, using the opening yk as a causal particle to introduce speciﬁc explana-
tions. The inﬁnitive construct rwbl (9:1b), evidently deriving from the root
rrb, expresses the process of the investigation and clariﬁcation of his conclu-
sions.36 Qoheleth declares that the conclusions have become clear to him after
34. On the relation of oil and the qualities that produce enjoyment of life, joyousness
and a good name, see Ps 23:5, 45:8, 92:11, 133:2; Prov 27:9; Job 29:6; Song 1:3.
35. For Qoheleth’s procedure of discovery and argumentation, see Fox, Qohelet and His
Contradictions, 85–89.
36. The word rwblw indicates ‘to examine’, ‘to discern’, ‘to select’ as the roots ˆjb ‘to ob-
serve’ and rjb ‘to select’. The word rwblw (9:1b) does not appear in the LXX. Its Vorlage,
reading by retroversion, lk ta har yblw ‘and my heart saw everything’ forms a complete par-
allelism between the two stichs (followed by the Syr.) The philological principle of lectio dif-
ﬁcilior supports the MT. For the meaning ‘to select’ for the root rrb in late biblical books,

a process of investigation: hz lk ta rwblw ‘and all this I ascertained’ (9:1b). The
wise and righteous are no different from other human beings with respect to
knowledge of their ﬁnal fate; hence, ‘their actions’ (µhydb[w) are in the hand
of God.37 Even love and hate are not revealed in advance, as in a literal ren-
dering of µhynpl lkh µdah [dwy ˆya ‘Human beings know none of this in ad-
vance’ (Eccl 9:2d).38
The expression lkl rçak lkh ‘everything is like everything else’ concerns
dja hrqm†‘the same fate’ that awaits all human beings.39 This summarizing af-
ﬁrmation raises the issue of the principle of retribution with regard to the un-
predictable outcome of actions and feelings in human life. Events are only
within divine control. The view that death is the fate shared by all human be-
ings, without regard to their moral qualities, blurs the distinction between the
moral poles of righteous and wicked, the good and the bad, the pure and the
impure, those who bring sacriﬁces and those who do not, and between the
ones who swear and those who shun oaths.40 Qoheleth’s declaration that all
37. The Targum, followed by Rashi, renders ˆwhydymltw ‘their students’ for µhydb[, de-
picting an ideal picture of the subservient attitude of disciples toward the Torah. Ibn Ezra
renders µhydb[m ‘their works’ ( Job 34:25). Ginsberg (Koheleth, 113) also renders µhydb[
(from adb[) as an Aramaism equivalent to Hebrew µhyç[m ‘their deeds’. Whitley (Ko-
heleth, 79) claims that the retention of qameß under the second syllable in a plural noun with
a heavy sufﬁx indicates the Aramaic provenance of the word (cf. ˆwhtwnk, tnk ‘colleague’,
‘their colleagues’, Ezra 4:17). Fox questions why an author composing in Hebrew would
chose a unique Aramaism instead of the frequent hç[m ‘deed’; thus, he assumes that the
translator misread it for ˆwhydb[ ‘their slaves’, because he was misled by the conjunction
with two nouns that refer to classes of people (Qohelet and His Contradictions, 256).
38. The LXX takes the opening word of v. 2, lkh ‘everything’, and reads it as lbh ‘van-
ity’ (mataiovthÍ ejn toÇÍ pavsin ‘Vanity is in all’) with the end of v. 1, obtaining the reading
lbh µhynpl lkh, that is, humankind cannot see the logical consequences of events. Another
datum that directs us to a deviation from the Masoretic division of the verses is evidenced
by Rashbam’s division of the commentary units, in which the closing phrase of v. 1, lkh
µhynpl, appears as the opening phrase at v. 2, thus implying all the evils and punishments
that may occur to human beings during their life (Qoheleth, 110).
39. Gordis (Koheleth, 300) offers parallel idiomatic expressions of the idea that one thing
is just like the other (e.g., hyha rça hyha ‘I am whatever I am’, Exod 3:14 and also 4:14).
40. The antitype for bwfl ‘for the good one’, missing in the MT, is attested in the LXX
by the reading kaµ tåÅ kakåÅ ‘and the bad’, which is followed by the Syr. a√Nblw and the
Vg. et malo.
see 1 Chr 7:40; 9:22; 16:41; and Neh 5:18. The root rwb is an wuu[ verb type for the gemi-
nate rrb (cf. ddg, dwg, Gen 49:19). See Gordis, Koheleth, 299; Ogden, Qoheleth, 144. Others

share a common fate contradicts the accepted view, according to which there
is some sort of correlation between a person’s deeds and his end.
Within the textual ﬂow that lists polar-opposite social types, the positive
archetype is always presented ﬁrst, except in the last pair, which opens with
the negative type (the one who swears) followed by the positive type (the one
who shuns oaths). The reverse order of the ﬁnal pair in contrast to the preced-
ing ones constitutes a concluding inversion, which marks the close of the lit-
erary unit. An additional stylistic variation in the unit may be seen in the
substitution of the prepositional kap for the prepositional lamed and in the use
of the word afwj ‘sinner’ as the opposite of bwf ‘good’.41
 Qoheheth binds the twllwh ‘madness’ of human behavior and humans’
wicked deeds “under the sun” together with the perception of death as the ex-
pected end of all human beings; hence, µytmh la wyrjaw ‘and afterward they
join the dead’.42 His deterministic world view wants to correlate moral behav-
ior with human death. A similar critical statement of the distortions and defects
41. The metathesis in the ﬁnal hemistich and its lengthening form a “closing deviation”
to the pericope. For the recognition of this phenomenon as an intentional esthetic struc-
ture, see M. Paran, Forms of the Priestly Style in the Pentateuch ( Jerusalem: Magnes, 1989)
179–88 [Hebrew]. Gordis attributes the inverted order to an ethical tendency “to end on a
favorable note, bwf ykb as in 3:8.” He considers the change of the prepositional lamed of the
ﬁrst three pairs into the comparative kap within the coordinate construction of two pairs to
be a stylistic variation (Gordis, Koheleth, 300–301). The term [bçnh ‘the one who swears’
refers to one who does not take an oath seriously or even swears falsely (see Eccl 8:2; Zech
5:3–4; Sir 23:9–12). The participle [bçnh ‘the one who swears’ presents another stylistic
variant that is probably the MT original reading. See Crenshaw, Koheleth, 160. On the pos-
itive type, the one “who shuns oaths,” and denunciation of the one “who swears,” see Sir
23:9–11 as well as Eccl 8:2–3. The Akkadian semantic equivalent to the Hebrew idiom ary
h[wbv is palahu mamita (see AHw 1317) which is also contrasted with “the one who swears
(falsely)” (e.g., BWL 116, lines 2–4). See Seow, Ecclesiastes, 299.
42. For a detailed discussion of the term wyrja and the peculiarity of the syntax wyrjaw
µytmh la, see Whitley, Koheleth, 79–80. Fox divides the understanding of the term wyrja
into three kinds: (1) ‘after him’, with reference to what will happen to the individual after
death; (2) ‘after him’, with reference to what will happen on earth after his life; (3) ‘after-
ward’, with reference to what will happen on earth in the lifetime of the individual. He opts
for the third meaning, ‘afterward’ (Qohelet and His Contradictions, 199; cf. Barton, Book of
Ecclesiastes, 160; Gordis, Koheleth, 301; Hertzberg, Der Prediger, 172). The LXX and the Vg.
both render the Hebrew term wyrja as ‘their end’, while the Syr. reads zhwpws rtbw ‘and
after their end’; Rashbam (Qoheleth, 111) reads wyrja as tyrja, “the end of each and every
human being is to go with the dead, since death comes to all; this is why evildoers continue
to do evil and do not repent.” Ginsberg (Qoheleth, 113) renders wyrja ‘his end’, based on
the parallelism between wyrja and qlj ‘lot’, ‘share’ (cf. Eccl 3:22; 6:12).

in the way God handles the world is even more sharply conveyed in Eccl
1:13b–15 through the following wording: “A twisted thing that cannot be
made straight, a lack that cannot be made good” (v. 15).43
It remains for us to consider the placement of the proverbial metaphor
“even a live dog is better than a dead lion” (9:4b) within the literary unit 9:1–
6, where it is embedded in a series of similitudes:
Similitude (part I): For he who is reckoned [Qere: is joined] among the living has
something to look forward to (9:4a)
Similitude (part II): since the living know they will die, but the dead know nothing;
and they have no more recompense, for even the memory of them has died (9:5)
Qoheleth’s gloomy observation of life is connected with the perception of
mortality as humankind’s inescapable fate. The ﬁgurative aphorism “even a
live dog is better than a dead lion” (v. 4b) illuminates this dark reﬂection from
a different perspective. The reason offered for the observation that it is better
to be among the living than among the dead is that “the living know they will
die” (v. 5a), while those who have died “know nothing” (v. 5b). The departed
is not called upon anymore to deal with issues of reward and punishment, nor
is he capable of experiencing love, hate, or envy.
Qoheleth introduces his arguments by using an independent relative clause
that opens with the emphatic particle yk: rça ym yk ‘for he who is’.44 The
Kethiv rjby, based on the root rjb, denotes ‘choice’, hence ‘to choose’.45 Fol-
lowing the interpretation of the Kethiv makes the opening clause sound like a
rhetorical question: ‘who is the one who chooses?’ The implicit response is
that no one, no mortal has free choice.46
43. The word twllwh ‘madness’, spelled with the plene ˙ôlem in the ﬁnal syllable (see Eccl
1:17; 2:12; 7:25), appears along with a qibbûß in Eccl 10:13, which is suspect. If the former
vocalization is the authentic one, it may have arisen on analogy with the similar twmkj ‘wis-
dom’ (Prov 1:20; 9:1) as the plural of majesty. See JM 1:265–66. The word twllwh re-
appears in Ecclesiastes in association with twlks/twlkç ‘folly’ (1:17; 2:12; 7:25; 10:13). It
implies madness and unbridled behavior (see Jer 25:16) as well as arrogant, vain, boastful
speech (see Ps 75:5–6).
44. The phrase rça ym ‘he who is’ serves here as the beginning of the nominal clause
and not just the beginning of the relative clause. A similar use of the particle yk is found in
Num 23:23; Isa 15:1; Amos 3:7; Prov 30:2; Job 5:2; and 28:1. The LXX translates rva ym
as an interrogative clause, while the Vg. reads it as a rhetorical question. The Syr. recognizes
it as a relative equivalent to rça lk ‘he who is’ (d ˜m; see Exod 32:33; 2 Sam 20:11; Eccl
5:9), and this seems correct. See Gordis, Koheleth, 304.
45. Or vocalized as yibba˙er (Niphal, 3rd-masc. imperfect) or as a Qal (3rd-masc. imper-
fect) ‘will choose’, meaning the one who chooses.

The Qere suggests the metathesized reading of ye˙ubbar from the root rbj
as the Pual passive (3rd-masc. imperfect) ‘be joined’, rendering the opening
clause: “for he who is reckoned among the living.”47 The Qere links better
with a closing stich that speaks of ˆwjfb ‘conﬁdence’ and ‘trust’, as in the verse:
tjfb rça ˆwjfbh hm ‘What makes you so conﬁdent?’ (2 Kgs 18:19 = Isa 36:4).
Thus, it seems that the logical argument of the literary unit vv. 4–6 leads to
the conclusion that participating fully in all spheres of human activity ex-
presses humans’ conﬁdence in life.48
The metaphor “even a live dog is better than a dead lion” is embedded be-
tween the argumentative clause beginning with yk (“for he who is reckoned
among the living [according to the Qere] has something to look forward to”),
and the two additional motivational clauses provide further explanations:
“since the living know they will die. But the dead know nothing; they have
no more recompense, for even the memory of them has died” (v. 5). Skipping
over the proverbial metaphor in v. 4b does not disturb the thematic continuity
of vv. 4a, 5. The concept behind the reason for the hope and conﬁdence of
those who are living is explained by the words “since the living know they
will die,” while the reading of the metaphor in its context undermines the
credibility of the declaration regarding the beneﬁt of living. The favoring of
life is expressed sardonically by appealing to the worth of the lowly live dog
over a highly regarded but dead lion. The lion commonly accepted as ‘the
king of beasts’ is linked to the exclusive promise of the awarded kingship to
Judah: “the scepter shall not depart from Judah” (Gen 49:9). The royal por-
trayal of the lion and its intimidating power are applicable in three “royal say-
ings” in the book of Proverbs (19:12, 20:2, and 28:15).49 The king’s rage is
likened to the roar of a lion, evoking terror and boldness; thus, the writer
gives advice regarding one’s behavior in light of the king’s authority.
47. The LXX, Vg., and Syr. reﬂect the Qere, thus also medieval commentators, for ex-
ample Rashi and Rashbam. Crenshaw claims an ironic meaning of the Kethiv being juxta-
posed to Qoheleth’s denial of divine retribution in v. 3; thus the praise for life proposed by
the Qere seems more plausible (Qoheleth, 161). Ogden opts for the root rjb of the Kethiv,
which denotes choice, hence supporting the contrasting debate between the living and the
dead (Qoheleth, 147–48).
48. The word ˆwjfb is interpreted as ‘hope’ and ‘expectation’ by Ibn Ezra: “While there
is life there is hope” (so also Ginsberg, Koheleth, 114). Whitley follows the talmudic meaning
of ˆwjfb in y. Ber. 9.13 (Koheleth, 80; cf. Wright, Koheleth, 408). For both meanings (‘hope’
and ‘conﬁdence’), see Delitzsch, Ecclesiastes, 359. Fox argues for the meaning ‘hope’: “know-
ing that one will die is not a ‘hope’” (Qohelelt and His Contradictions, 258).

The dead lion in our discussion is ironically juxtaposed with the image of a
living dog. The derogative epithet “dead dog” is commonly used as an expres-
sion for devaluation and self-abasement, as in the following desperate protest
of David to Saul: “Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, a single ﬂea?” (1 Sam
24:15). The dog itself is associated with an attitude of scorn and disdain, even
evoking feelings of disgust: “As a dog returns to his vomit, so a dullard repeats
his folly” (Prov 26:11).50 Therefore, placement of the metaphor constructed
on the model of the “better proverb” seems puzzling. The choice of the image
“living dog” to illustrate the advantage of life over death according to the
“better-proverb” pattern adds a cynical, skeptical tone to the debate in place
of the authoritative tone that usually characterizes this literary paradigm.
The “better proverb” (†ôb-saying) is a form-variation of the wisdom saying.
Its structure shapes a logical paradigm of the advantage of one strophe over the
other: “better is x than y.”
The inner structure of the “better proverb” measures and then determines
µyyjb µdal bwf hm ‘what is best for a man to do in life’ (Eccl 6:12a). The an-
thropocentric orientation of this paradigm stems from its purpose of evaluat-
ing essential values and practical needs in the life of the individual.51 The
didactic authority of the “better proverb” is supported by its normative ethos
50. The idiom tm blk ‘dead dog’ expresses self-loathing. See 1 Sam 24:15; 2 Sam 9:8,
16:9; and 2 Kgs 8:13 (according to the LXX), and see D. W. Thomas, “Kelev, Dog: Its Or-
igin and Some Usages of It in the Old Testament,” VT 10 (1960) 410–27; G. W. Coats,
“Self-Abasement and Insult Formulas,” JBL 89 (1970) 14–26. On the idiomatic expression
in Exod 11:7, “not a dog shall snarl (or: move his tongue) . . . at man or beast,” see F. C.
Fensham, “The Dog in Exodus XI, 7,” VT 16 (1966) 504–7. For a link between dog and
servant as a self-disparaging term, see 2 Kgs 8:13, “your servant (but) a dog”; and see my
ºbdk klb in Lachish Letters 2.4, 5.4, 6.3; ANET 322. For the same use ardu, kalbu ‘servant’,
‘dog’ and kalbu alone in various expressions of humiliation in the Amarna Letters, see, e.g.,
EA 129:4, 134:4, 201:2, 295:4; 320:22, 322:17 (W. L. Moran, The Amarna Letters [Balti-
more: Johns Hopkins University, 1992]). The image of the dog as an obsequious creature
is used by Sargon, portraying the Manaean king and his nobles thus: eli erbi rettisunu iptassilu
kima kalbi ‘groveling on all fours in obeisance before him’ (TCL 3, 12:58). On the low sta-
tus of the dog in the ancient Near East, see D. Marcus, “Animal Similes in Assyria Royal
Inscriptions,” Or 46 (1977) 94.

and empirical dimension, as well as the didactic authority of the Sage–Teacher
that shapes the admonition genre.
 Our “better proverb,” that “even a live dog is better than a dead lion” (Eccl
9:4b), forms a pattern that digresses from the usual paradigm.52 Whereas the
adverb bwf regularly stands at the head of a saying, here it is transposed to the
end of the opening clause, where it appears in conjunction with the preposi-
tional particle ˆm.53 Hence, the ironic perception of the saying gains its rhe-
torical emphasis by means of the alternative form of the “better” pattern; thus:
The (scorned) dog = is alive and the (glorious) lion = is dead.
The proverb “even a live dog is better than a dead lion” is woven through
the thoughtful discussion (vv. 4–5) in order to illustrate the advantage of life
over death.54 Comparison of this speech to another contemplative mono-
logue, in which a contradictory statement is expressed—“then I accounted
those who died long since more fortunate than those who are still living” (Eccl
4:2)—invites a debate. Furthermore, the speaker here provides the same pre-
text for his praise of death in the evil deeds done under the sun (4:3–5) as he
does in ennumerating the advantages of the living in the actual debate (9:3).
The speaker chooses to concretize his cynical position toward life by juxtapos-
ing a living dog and a dead lion to prove the advantage of life over the glorious
dead.
The sage’s pessimistic attitude toward human conduct does not contradict
his admonitions to partake as fully as possible of the pleasures of life in wlm[ lk
‘all of his work’. In the confrontation between life and the netherworld, the
balance is tipped toward life due to the existence of ‘action, reasoning, learn-
ing and wisdom’ (9:10) in life and their absolute absence in the netherworld.
The ideational tension between life and death in the literary unit of Eccl
9:1–6 is obtained by means of contradictory terms:
52. For the use of the emphatic lamed elsewhere, see Isa 32:1; Ps 32:6. Fox argues that
the particle lamed in blkl is not emphatic, because an emphatic particle would come before
the predicate; see Eccl 2:3; 6:12; 8:12 (Qoheleth and His Contradictions, 258).
53. Our saying resembles the ironic context of another “better proverb”: “I say, the still-
birth is more fortunate than he” (Eccl 6:3). In both sayings the undesirable states (the “live
dog” and the “stillbirth”) appear in the advantageous position within the aphorism.
54. Another example of the way an idiomatic expression concretizes a general truth
within a debate is conveyed by the laconic proverb: “skin for skin” ( Job 2:4a). Here too, the
proverb is embedded in the network of arguments to test Job anew after his trials: “But lay
a hand on his bones and his ﬂesh, and he will surely blaspheme You to Your face” ( Job 2:5).
On the stylistic device of quoting popular sayings in self-debates, see R. Gordis, “Quota-
tions in Wisdom Literature,” 123–47; idem, “Quotations as a Literary Usage in Biblical,
Rabbinic and Oriental Literature,” HUCA 22 (1949) 196–97.

It seems that the use of polarity turns the dogmatic rules of the perception of
divine providence and retribution on its head, and the moral opposites be-
come partners in a shared fate. Qoheleth depicts a picture of chaos that serves
to bolster his skeptical outlook on the commonly accepted belief system.
The ﬁgurative proverb is embedded in a literary unit deﬁned by means of
an inclusio: the opening of the speech describes the lack of knowledge by the
righteous and the wise about their future in relation to feelings of love and
hate (9:1), while the speech’s closing section features the absence of all feelings
and drives, such as love, hate, and jealousy, among the dead (9:6)
Introductory Unit
(1) For all this I noted and I ascertained all this: that the actions of even the righ-
teous and the wise are determined by God. Even love! Even hate! Man knows
none of these in advance.
Proverbial Metaphor
(4) For he who is reckoned [according to Qere: ye˙ubbar] among the living has
something to look forward to—even a live dog is better than a dead lion—
(5) since the living know they will die. But the dead know nothing; they have
no more recompense, for even the memory of them has died.
Closing Unit
(6) Their loves, their hates, their jealousies have long since perished; and they have
no more share till the end of time in all that goes on under the sun.
Summing up, the social types who represent moral opposites (poor wise vs.
wealthy fools) share consciousness of their ﬁnal fate. This perception strikes a
blow at the principle of retribution, according to which God repays human
beings according to their actions. Even the advice to live is exempliﬁed
through the advantage of a living dog over a dead lion, thus expressing an
even more skeptical view of divine retribution.
Gordis includes the proverbial saying in the unit discussing the praise of life
(9:4–12), while he deﬁnes the theme of the literary unit 8:10–9:3 as the fail-
ure of the principle of divine retribution. However, it seems that the ﬁgurative
proverb with the metaphor taken from the realm of fauna (v. 4) functions as
the concretizing device of a theoretical discussion and, therefore, is not appro-

priate for opening a new discussion. The ﬁgurative saying is linked to the
sage’s ongoing argument that humans are not capable of speculating on their
fate. Nevertheless, the advantage of the living over the dead emerges from the
saying. The conclusion to be drawn is that the very fact of being alive renders
people masters of their own consciousness.55
Qoheleth juxtaposes contradictory terms and values that are seen as equal
forces in the cognitive process of making the right choices. This is the way he
chooses to express his ambivalent attitude toward life and to stimulate his au-
dience into reﬂecting on contradictory phenomena in human life. Within the
dialectical discourse, the vividness and ﬁgurative suggestiveness of animal
metaphors help to illustrate the inherent polarities on both the conceptual and
rhetorical levels.

A Sense of Timing:
A Neglected Aspect of Qoheleth’s Wisdom
Richard L. Schultz
Wheaton College
In his inﬂuential monograph, Wisdom in Israel, Gerhard von Rad treats “the
doctrine of the proper time” as a signiﬁcant wisdom theme.1 In general, how-
ever, this theme has been associated more frequently with Proverbs and Sirach
than with Ecclesiastes. To be sure, the structure and meaning of Eccl 3:1–8,
which addresses this topic, have been the subject of much study, as have indi-
vidual terms from the semantic ﬁeld of time,2 but with the exception of John
Wilch’s 1969 monograph, Time and Event, and Michael Fox’s recent work, A
Time to Tear Down and a Time to Build Up,3 Qoheleth’s development of this
theme has been largely neglected.
The purpose of this essay is to offer a preliminary synthesis of this theme
within the book of Ecclesiastes. This will be achieved through a brief exami-
nation of all occurrences of the key terms related to time in their order of oc-
currence in the book of Ecclesiastes: ‘time’ t[, ‘day’ µwy, and ‘year’ hnv, as well
as ‘ﬂeeting’ lbh, ‘afterward’ rja, and ‘eternity’ µlw[, seeking to determine
whether they present a complementary or a diffuse development of this theme
1. Gerhard von Rad, Wisdom in Israel (Nashville: Abingdon, 1972) 138–43. Although
von Rad begins by quoting Eccl 3:1–8, he devotes only two brief paragraphs to the treat-
ment of the subject of “the proper time” in Ecclesiastes, arguing that its author’s signiﬁcant
contribution is in linking this “doctrine” with a theological determinism.
2. The most thorough treatment of individual terms and phrases is by Gershon Brin, The
Concept of Time in the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls (Studies on the Texts of the Desert of
Judah 39; Leiden: Brill, 2001), although few of his examples are taken from the wisdom
corpus of the Hebrew Bible.

ing of Ecclesiastes (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999) 194–206.

within the book. In addition, a number of texts in Ecclesiastes that address the
relationship between time and human conduct will be noted: acting too hast-
ily (5:2), acting too slowly (5:4, 8:11, 10:11), and discerning the proper action
for a given moment in time (3:1–8, 11, 17; 8:5–6; 10:17). In the concluding
section, I will argue for the foundational role of 3:1–8 in setting forth Qo-
heleth’s “sense of timing” and seek to demonstrate that this uniﬁed thematic
perspective can be traced through the book.
Qoheleth’s view of time has sometimes been viewed as unique in the Old
Testament. On the one hand, according to Henry Wheeler Robinson, Qo-
heleth is no longer rooted in history, showing “no concern with a redemptive
past, and no vision of a Messianic future” and, as such, atypical for “Hebraic
thought.”4 However, this could be viewed simply as typical of the wisdom
genre as a whole, for Robinson’s description would also ﬁt the books of Prov-
erbs and Job. Kurt Galling, on the other hand, credits Qoheleth with being
the ﬁrst biblical wisdom writer to discover and develop thematically the ge-
schichtlichkeit ‘authenticity, historical relevance’ of human existence.5 How-
ever, James Barr discovers no “drastic innovation” in Qoheleth’s conception
of time.6 In any case, the goal of the present examination is not to compare
Qoheleth with other canonical books, but, as it were, to compare Qoheleth
with Qoheleth, given a history of interpretation in which scholars frequently
have identiﬁed contradictory voices within the same canonical book.7 Because
Qoheleth’s “doctrine of the right time” often has been portrayed as determin-
istic or even predestinarian, although this may result from interpreting Eccl
3:1–8 in isolation from the rest of the book, this claim also must be addressed.
Before summarizing Qoheleth’s understanding of time as it relates to God
and humanity, I ﬁnd it helpful to survey brieﬂy several previous studies of the
topic.8 According to James Barr, in his 1962 monograph, Biblical Words for
4. Henry Wheeler Robinson, Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament (Oxford:

Time, t[ means ‘time’, often designating the temporal setting of an incident,
even referring to conditions prevailing over a longer period. In contrast, µlw[
refers to remotest time, or ‘perpetuity’, but rarely, if ever, ‘eternity’. In his
view, Qoheleth’s emphasis is on “the stultifying and frustrating effect of time
and change upon human effort.”9 John Wilch understands t[ as designating
an “occasion or a situation as a given opportunity” (in Qoheleth, a God-given
one) for activity and experience. According to Wilch, t[ does not refer to a
kairos, that is, a critical or decisive occasion or, for that matter, even to a spe-
ciﬁc moment in time but, rather, to all situations that one encounters in the
daily course of life, involving all possibilities.10
Here Wilch is questioning Carl Heinz Ratschow’s view that the biblical
concept of time involves a Zeit-für ‘time for’ as well as a Zeit-sein-für ‘being
time for’ and a Zeit-haben-für ‘having time for’ concept, with t[ having the
basic meaning of ‘the right time for’.11 Ratschow, in contrast to other kairos
proponents, does not see a “moment of decision” here but, rather, an “open-
ness for every situation that comes upon a man.”12 In Wilch’s view, however,
this is reduced in Qoheleth to a passive acceptance of the “occasion-when”
something occurs rather than the recognition of the “time-for” a speciﬁc ac-
tivity.13 Wilch rejects a deterministic interpretation of Ecclesiastes, since this
would be indicated by the use of d[m. Rather, God has given ordered exist-
ence to nature so that individuals have the opportunity to lead an ordered
life—which also includes waiting for the proper occasion. According to
Wilch, Qoheleth’s argument is “not directed against the man who does not
recognize the right time for a certain matter, but rather against the man who
is not content to accept the opportunity within its given limits.” What is called
for is an attitude of submission, not decisive action.14

Michael Fox distinguishes two uses of t[: (1) “temporally deﬁned: a seg-
ment of time of any duration,” and (2) “substantively deﬁned: events and their
conﬁgurations,” the latter being more important in Ecclesiastes.15 Qoheleth’s
God can, but does not, “predetermine exactly what will happen and when.”
However, he “repeatedly and unpredictably intrudes and overrides human ef-
forts,” even through premature death.16 According to Fox, Qoheleth claims:
“Every type of event and deed has an ºet, a set of circumstances (whether re-
current or unique) in which it is appropriate.”17 Fox’s understanding of Qo-
heleth’s message appears to differ from Wilch’s only in degree: one should do
things in their times and “not transgress the times.” This does not involve try-
ing harder to act at precisely the right moment but “adapting oneself to the
constraints of reality” while seeking to produce a proﬁt through one’s toil.18
In light of these divergent understandings of Qoheleth’s view of time, I turn
now to an examination of the key terms referring to time in the book of Ec-
clesiastes.19 The word t[ is used 11 times in the book after 3:1–8, and I will
begin with 3:1–8, despite the danger of reading my assessment of time in 3:1–
8 into the following passages as well. Eccl 3:1 sets forth Qoheleth’s founda-
tional understanding of time, which he then refers back to throughout the
book: “There is a speciﬁc time [ˆmz, its only appearance in Ecclesiastes] and
occasion for every earthly matter or purpose.” The sage then illustrates this
premise with seven pairs (perhaps indicating representative completeness) of
contrasting (or polar) activities in 3:2–7. This basic afﬁrmation, along with the
accompanying examples, is developed further in the course of the book. The
next occurrence of t[ is in Eccl 3:11 in the midst of the section (vv. 9–15) that
draws conclusions from the “Catalogue of Times.”20 In view of the divine or-
dering of the times, one can pose the question of what can be gained through
human toil (v. 9). In observing humanity’s God-given task, one can afﬁrm the
beauty (that is, ﬁttingness, hpy) of each divinely-appointed time (kairo, LXX).

19. Within the scope of a brief essay, it is not possible to discuss all of the widely-differing
interpretations (or even translations) of the following texts. My goal is simply to summarize
my understanding of each passage in an effort to argue that a uniﬁed perspective regarding
time can be found in the book.

heleth afﬁrms that the rhythms of life are good, to the extent that one can dis-
cern them. Yet these times ﬁnd their true signiﬁcance against the backdrop of
the sense of perpetuity that God has placed in the human heart. In 3:17, Qo-
heleth applies the principle of 3:1 to one of his most troubling issues, the lack
of justice in the courts. Despite current observations to the contrary, he ex-
presses his conﬁdence that God will indeed judge both the righteous and the
wicked, for an appropriate occasion (t[) for the purpose of assessing every
deed will ultimately arrive.
In discussing the limited ability of righteous and wise behavior to guarantee
a bump-free path, 7:7 also alludes back to chap. 3. If there is an appropriate
“time to die” (which the elderly are rapidly approaching), then there must also
be an inappropriate—or premature—time, in this case, precipitated by a life
of excessive wickedness and folly.
Similarly, chap. 8, in discussing the role and limited success of government
in maintaining justice, draws intertextually on chap. 3, using t[ 3 times. Ac-
cording to v. 5, law-abiding citizens will not become entangled in a harmful
conspiracy (compare v. 2), for their wisdom will help them to recognize, de-
spite the suffering that bad government can inﬂict on them, that the present
may not be the right time to act, because there is a ﬁtting time and way to deal
with this problem. Some interpreters, including Tremper Longman, translate
fpvm in vv. 5 and 6 as ‘manner’ or ‘custom’.22 However, in light of the use of
fpvm elsewhere in the book (3:16, 5:8, 11:9, 12:14), it is preferable to take the
expression as a hendiadys, that is, an occasion for judgment, alluding back to
3:17, a text that similarly afﬁrms that there is a time for this purpose. Presently,
circumstances (literally, ‘a time’ t[, v. 9) may prevail in which one person
rules over another to the latter’s detriment, but a time for justice is coming.
Abusive rulers will ultimately meet their match, being no more capable of
mastering death (v. 8, literally, ‘in the day of death’, here probably the equiv-
alent of the ‘time to die’ in 3:2) than the wind, unable to escape the conse-
quences of their wickedness. (This development of thought is suggested by the
fourfold use of the root flv in vv. 4, 8–9.)
Chapter 9, which discusses how to live in the light of death, also builds on
chap. 3, employing t[ 4 times. Eccl 9:7–10 offers the climactic presentation
of the refrain-like “eat, drink, and enjoy your work” motif in the book, for it
is only here that imperatival verbs are used.23 Qoheleth urges his addressees to

be always in a celebratory mode, ‘at every time’ wearing white garments with
plenty of oil on the head (v. 8). This appears to be contrary to the instruction
found in chap. 3, namely, that there is an appropriate (and thus limited) time
to laugh and to dance (v. 4). However, v. 10b explains the exceptional charge:
in Sheol, where one is headed, there will be no more opportunities to enjoy
the Creator’s everyday gifts. Verse 11 records the sobering observation that the
swift, mighty, and wise are not always the successful ones (perhaps an encour-
agement if one does not belong to one of these categories), because “time and
chance” befall (hrq) all, perhaps here again a hendiadys: “time-related fate.”
One cannot know when it is “his time” (to win or to lose, perhaps, v. 12a):
the gold-medal favorite can pull a muscle in the sprint ﬁnal. If one sees here
an intertextual link back to 7:17 (“Why die before your time?”), this text may
present an argument from the greater to the lesser: how can one expect to
know whether or not divine providence is on one’s side in the various chal-
lenges of life, if one cannot even know when one’s time on earth is up?24 In
any case, an evil time (including the ultimate evil time of one’s death, v. 12b)
can overtake one as suddenly as a ﬁsh is caught in a net or a bird in a trap.
Given the major emphasis on death in this chapter, beginning with the afﬁr-
mation that everyone and his/her deeds are in God’s hand and that one fate
(hrqm) awaits all (9:1–2), 9:11–12 cannot be speaking simply of good luck or
blind fate when it refers to one’s “time.”25
The ﬁnal appearance of t[ is in 10:17, which also reﬂects the instruction in
chap. 3 regarding the proper time. A country is fortunate if its princes eat at
“the time.” The time that is referred to here, as Michael Fox correctly notes,
is “not merely non-morning” but, rather, “when circumstances are appropri-
ate to feasting.”26 The verse’s ﬁnal phrase reinforces this: eating “for strength
and not for dissipation.” One can conclude, then, that nearly every passage in
Ecclesiastes that employs the word t[ can be understood as harking back to
and further developing or illustrating “the doctrine of the times” set forth in
chap. 3.
24. There is no contextual basis for taking v. 11 as a denial that one is able to discern the
appropriate time for a particular action. This is the claim of Alexander A. Fischer, who sees
the same thought expressed in 8:6–7, as well (Skepsis oder Furcht Gottes? Studien zur Kompo-
sition und Theologie des Buches Kohelet [BZAW 247; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1997] 222–23).

A Sense of Timing: A Neglected Aspect of Qoheleth’s Wisdom
263
The word µwy ‘day’ appears 26 times in Ecclesiastes. Most of these occur-
rences are in the plural, usually referring to the totality of one’s days, often
with lk ‘all’. “Days” refers in Qoheleth to the succession of indistinguishable,
often wearisome, units of time that one is apportioned by God (8:15). Some-
times the emphasis is on how few they are (literally, ‘the number of days of
their/his life’, 2:3 and 5:17[18]), especially the days of one’s youth (11:9 and
12:1). More often the point is that there is a dulling or painful uniformity to
all of them; none of them is unique or remarkable. They are marked by sor-
row (2:23), darkness (5:17), and lbh (6:12, 7:15, 9:9). Periods of time can be
compared with one another as being better or worse than the present (7:10,
11:8, 12:1). Almost Kafkaesque, they can pass almost without notice when
one is occupied with joy (5:20) or pass slowly when one is waiting for a return
on one’s investment (11:1). More importantly, one’s days can be shortened by
doing evil (8:13), and soon all of one’s days will be forgotten by those who
follow (2:16). Interestingly, however, 6 of the 7 occurrences in the singular are
in the context of death: 7:1, which picks up the word pair from 3:2 (“the day
of death is better than the day of one’s birth”); 7:14, if it refers back to the
opening 4 verses of the chapter (“day of good . . . day of misfortune”); 8:8
(“no one has mastery over the day of one’s death”); and 12:3, which describes
the breakdown of the body that culminates in death (“in the day which . . .”).
This is in keeping with Qoheleth’s obsession with death as the ultimate lbh.
Eccl 7:14, which concludes a section that sets forth the beneﬁts of adverse ex-
periences, seems to suggest, in a manner similar to chap. 3, that both happy
and unpleasant days are made by God and thus are good “in their time.”
Therefore, Qoheleth urges individuals to enjoy the simple pleasures of life as
much as they can and learn from the difﬁcult days.27
The word hnv ‘year’ is used only 5 times in Ecclesiastes. On the one hand,
according to 6:1–6, many children and many years, which are often viewed
in the Old Testament as indicators of divine favor, in themselves are unable to
compensate when God withdraws from a rich person the ability to enjoy one’s
wealth—not even 100 children or 2,000 years. On the other hand, in 11:8
one is encouraged to enjoy as many years as one is given, while keeping in
mind that many dark days will also follow. Soon enough, says Qoheleth, the
unpleasant days will arrive, and the years will draw near when one is no longer
able to enjoy life (12:1). This seems to be the only respect in which the words
27. For a summary of the positive message of Qoheleth, see Martin A. Klopfenstein,
“Kohelet und die Freude am Dasein,” ThZ 47 (1991) 97–107; and Richard L. Schultz,
“Ecclesiastes,” in New Dictionary of Biblical Theology (ed. T. Desmond Alexander et al.; Lei-
cester: Inter-Varsity, 2000) 211–15.

for days and years contribute to Qoheleth’s sense of timing. There is no sug-
gestion, for example, that one can do anything to prolong one’s days (although
one can shorten them) or to make one particular day unique or memorable.
In addition, there are several texts that indicate that the proper time is
something that humans can discern rather than simply being something that
God determines. Eccl 4:17–5:6[5:1–7] is instructive in this regard. On the
one hand, with regard to a vow, one can act too hastily, conveyed by the use
of the verbs lhb and rhm, respectively: “Do not be quick with your mouth,
do not be hasty in your heart, in uttering a vow before God” (v. 2). On the
other hand, one can also act too slowly with regard to a vow, dragging one’s
feet when it comes to paying up (v. 4, using rja). The wise person discerns
the proper time both to vow and to fulﬁll a vow. Otherwise, consequences
will develop from bad to worse: “God has no pleasure in fools” (v. 4) . . . “Do
not let your mouth lead you into sin” (v. 6a) . . . why should God be angry
. . . and destroy the work of your hands?” (v. 6c)—all of this resulting from a
voluntary oath and a wrong sense of timing. Chapter 8 presents another two-
fold example. On the one hand, a citizen can abandon a loyalty oath to the
king too hastily (again using lhb) by joining in a conspiracy (literally, ‘to stand
in a bad thing’, v. 3). On the other hand, a government that acts too slowly in
executing criminal justice (using the negation of hrhm, v. 11) can provoke its
citizens to do evil! Neither text clearly advises against the action that it de-
scribes—whether making vows or abandoning one’s loyalty to the king. The
problem is, rather, a matter of poor timing.
The most striking illustration of this principle is offered in chap. 10. In vv. 8
and 9, 4 hazardous actions are described: digging a pit, tearing down a wall,
quarrying stones, and chopping wood. However, Qoheleth’s conclusion is not
that one should avoid these actions, because they are all necessary for con-
struction projects. Instead, he notes that help is available but only if one’s tim-
ing is right. Taking up the hazards of vv. 9b and 8b in reverse order, the sage
notes in an ironic tone that one’s skill and cunning are of no beneﬁt if one’s
timing is off! According to v. 10, if one fails to sharpen the axe blade before
chopping wood, one must exert more energy and thus, by implication, might
injure oneself. According to v. 11, if the poisonous snake strikes before being
charmed, there is no beneﬁt to being a master charmer.28
28. In addition, there are also some less-explicit examples of proper timing in the book.
For example, Eccl 10:18 suggests that further negligence after laziness already has caused
the house beams to sag may result in a leaky roof.

A Sense of Timing: A Neglected Aspect of Qoheleth’s Wisdom
265
Michael Fox views 11:1–6 as offering a “reformulation” of the practical
message of 3:1–9.29 In some respects, this passage marks the conﬂuence of a
key emphasis on one’s inability to know in the second half of the book with
the theme of timing. Addison G. Wright has noted that the section 9:1–11:6
is distinguished by the repeated phrase and frequent closing refrain “one can-
not know.”30 Eccl 11:1–6, then, gives advice on how to act in situations in
which the proper time cannot be discerned. According to v. 1, one simply
takes decisive, even risky, action and then waits for the results. Verse 2 suggests
that one contribute generously to many causes, because one cannot know the
bad times that might come upon the earth. Verses 3–4 suggest that one cannot
simply wait for more propitious times to arrive, because then one might never
take action. One is as incapable of knowing in advance the unpredictable and
hidden work of God as it impacts one’s work as one was incapable of under-
standing the process of fetal formation before the advent of ultrasound tech-
nology (v. 5). Thus one should sow one’s seed both day and night, despite not
knowing which seed will bear fruit (v. 6). Taken together with the previous
group of texts, this passage asserts that even the lack of knowledge of the ap-
propriate time does not exempt one from taking decisive actions.
A major problem for humans, with respect to time, is uncertainty regarding
the future: according to 8:7 and 9:1, one knows neither what is coming nor
when it will come. This is expressed in 3:22, 6:12, 7:14, and 10:14 in terms
of one’s not being able to know what will happen wyrja ‘afterward’, literally
‘after him’.31 This term may refer to the afterlife, given the context of 3:22
(that is, immediately following the question posed in 3:21); at the very least, it
refers to the time following one’s death (see the use of rja in 2:12, 18; and
9:3), although it could simply mean ‘later in life’ in 7:14. The implications of
this ignorance regarding the future are that one should enjoy the present
(3:22), accept the unpleasant days (7:14), and not speculate on the reason for
what occurs (6:12, 10:14).
Another term that denotes the future is µlw[ (traditionally, ‘eternity’). Is an
awareness of µlw[ a signiﬁcant component of Qoheleth’s sense of timing? The
word µlw[ appears 7 times in Ecclesiastes. Although one may question the pre-
cise duration of µlw[ (for example, the idea of “eternity” in some absolute sense

heleth,” CBQ 30 (1968) 326.

certainly does not ﬁt in 1:10), its juxtaposition with expressions of temporality
and transience (especially in chap. 3) indicate that it more likely refers to some
dimension of time than to ‘darkness’, ‘hiddenness’, ‘world’, or ‘ignorance’, as
various commentators have suggested.32 Instead, µlw[ expresses the fact that
some things do endure in a world marred by transience.33 In 1:4 µlw[ denotes
the enduring earth in contrast to constantly changing nature.34 In 2:16, 9:6,
and 12:5, µlw[ refers to the period following one’s death, without any indica-
tion that it will end.
More signiﬁcant is its use in 3:11 and 14. One could understand the whole
of chap. 3 as an assessment of time in its relationship to eternity. In response to
the ˆwrty hm ‘what is the gain?’ question in 3:9 at the conclusion of the “Cat-
alogue of Times,” Qoheleth mentions the deity 6 times in 8 verses. God has
both ordered the times (v. 11a) and implanted a sense of perpetuity in human
hearts (v. 11ba). His work cannot be fully comprehended (v. 11bb), in part be-
cause it lasts, unlike human work, which cannot even alter the divine work
(v. 14). God enables humans to enjoy everyday activities in time as a gift
(v. 13), which they should acknowledge, even while revering God for his sov-
ereignty over time, as one who not only accomplishes that which endures but
also is able to pursue the past (v. 15, literally, “and God will seek what is driven
away”). In light of this discourse regarding the relationship between t[ and
µlw[, it may be that Qoheleth’s greatest problem is not that God constantly
thwarts human efforts to accomplish something35 but, rather, that all human
achievement is utterly temporal (as expressed by lbh).
32. See especially the detailed discussion by James L. Crenshaw, “The Eternal Gospel
(Eccl. 3:11),” in Essays in Old Testament Ethics (ed. James L. Crenshaw and John T. Willis;
New York: KTAV, 1974) 39–43. The translation ‘eternity’ is also supported by the versions.
33. Even more translation options have been suggested for lbh than for µlw[. However,
I consider ‘transience’ to be the primary thrust of lbh in Ecclesiastes, while acknowledging
that ‘senseless’, ‘meaningless’, or ‘absurd’ may be an appropriate rendering for lbh in a given
passage, thereby expressing a human response to the temporary value of achievement. As
Thomas Krüger explains: “all convictions and wishes prove to be futile and absurd when
they do not do adequate justice to the ﬂeeting and transitory nature of human life” (Tho-
mas Krüger, Qoheleth [Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Augsburg/Fortress, 2004] 3). For a thor-
ough discussion of the options, see Michael V. Fox, “The Meaning of Hebel for Qohelet,”
JBL 105 (1986) 409–27; Daniel C. Fredericks, Coping with Transience: Ecclesiastes on Brevity
in Life (Bible Seminar 18; Shefﬁeld: JSOT Press, 1993); and Douglas B. Miller, Symbol and
Rhetoric in Ecclesiastes: The Place of Hebel in Qohelet’s Work (Academia Biblica 2; Atlanta: So-
ciety of Biblical Literature, 2002).
34. Fox takes ‘the earth’ here as referring not to “the physical earth, but humanity as a
whole,” as in Gen 11:1, 1 Kgs 2:2, and Ps 33:8 (Fox, A Time to Tear Down, 166).

A Sense of Timing: A Neglected Aspect of Qoheleth’s Wisdom
267
I can return now to the question with which I began: how does 3:1–8 re-
late to the further development of the theme of timing in the rest of the book?
(1) Eccl 3:1 introduces a basic thesis that is taken up, applied, and illustrated in
various places throughout the book. This may even include 12:1: days will ar-
rive late in life when there is seemingly no useful ≈pj ‘purpose’ for them.
(2) Although not every term from the semantic ﬁeld of time is closely related
to Qoheleth’s “sense of timing,” there are no obviously conﬂicting perspec-
tives regarding this theme in the book. (3) Several passages in the book suggest
that it is important both to discern and to act decisively at the right time,
rather than passively accepting God’s ordering of the times with moderation
or resignation. (4) Thus it appears that the “Catalogue of Times” in 3:1–8 is
presented so that, thus instructed, one can toil more proﬁtably (v. 9). As
Michael Fox has noted, most of the items in 3:2–8 (other than the initial pair
“birth and death”) involve actions whose timing humans can control “to some
degree.”36 The examples of “proper timing” later in the book suggest that, in
order to proﬁt, one must recognize the appropriate time for a particular action
and then proceed accordingly.
Qoheleth’s attitude toward time has been characterized incorrectly as de-
terministic or fatalistic. Instead, Qoheleth counsels those who live amid the
tension between transience (lbh) and perpetuity (µlw[) “under the sun” to ac-
knowledge God’s sovereign ordering of the times and, whenever possible, us-
ing Michael Fox’s expression, to act “when the time is ripe.”37
36. Fox, A Time to Tear Down, 201; contra Loader, who views the list as descriptive and
deterministic rather than as a prescriptive encouragement to seek to control life ( James A.
Loader, Polar Structures in the Book of Qohelet [BZAW 152; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1979] 29,
32). Most individuals are capable of determining when to stop embracing and get back to
work or when to throw away their high school notebooks!

The Little Sister and Solomon’s Vineyard:
Song of Songs 8:8–12 as a Lovers’ Dialogue
J. Cheryl Exum
The University of Shefﬁeld
Michael Fox has, for the past few years, been my most valued and constant
conversation partner for the commentary I have been writing on the Song of
Songs. Not the real Michael Fox, the real author of The Song of Songs and the
Ancient Egyptian Love Songs, with whom I have hardly discussed this text at all,
but the implied author, the one I have constructed based on his commentary
and with whom I have had numerous discussions and arguments, both in my
mind and on paper. His analysis of the Song is so insightful, thorough, precise,
and convincing that I am always pleased when I ﬁnd a point on which we dis-
agree, because I know it means an intellectual challenge, something like, I sup-
pose, playing chess with a master, one whose every move is so well crafted that
you cannot predict the outcome. For Michael’s Festschrift it is an honor to be
able to offer an essay on some verses of the Song on which we hold different
views. I hope I might convince him (and readers of this article) but, at the very
least, that I might give him something to ponder in return for the many inter-
pretive issues and questions he has posed for me.
The text in question is Song 8:8–12, a pericope that is enigmatic but not
particularly controversial.
8. We have a little sister
who has no breasts.
What shall we do for our sister
on the day she is spoken for?
9. If she is a wall,
we will build upon it a silver tier.
And if she is a door,
we will panel it in cedar.
10. I am a wall,
and my breasts are like towers.
So I have become in his eyes
like one who brings peace.
11. Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon;
he gave the vineyard to keepers.

J. Cheryl Exum
270
For its fruit one would give
a thousand silver pieces.
12. My own vineyard is before me;
the thousand for you, Solomon,
and two hundred for the keepers of its fruit.
There is a wide range of opinion regarding the speakers in these verses and
their precise meaning, but it seems to make little difference to the overall in-
terpretation of the Song of Songs, because this section of the poem is not gen-
erally accorded much signiﬁcance. Indeed, some ﬁnd these verses anticlimactic
or even out of place, coming as they do after the dramatic paean to love as
strong as death in vv. 6–7.1 But this is not the case, as I hope to show.
There are two different themes in 8:8–12, though they are not unrelated:
the little sister and the vineyard. Verses 8–9 are about someone’s little sister and
the steps that will be taken when she is betrothed, and v. 10 belongs with vv. 8–
9 as a response. Verses 11–12 are about vineyards, Solomon’s as compared with
the speaker’s. It is generally agreed that the speaker of v. 10 is the female pro-
tagonist of the Song. Her words here ﬁt both her relationship with her lover
and her mode of speaking about herself (cf., e.g., “Black am I, and lovely,” 1:5;
“I am a rose of Sharon,” 2:1; “I am my lover’s and my lover is mine,” 6:3). But
who speaks in vv. 8–9 and in vv. 11–12? Is the woman who speaks in v. 10 the
“little sister” of vv. 8–9? If so, what is the meaning of the exchange? If not,
who is the little sister and why is she important? What is the meaning of the
comparison in vv. 11–12? Is “my own vineyard” a vineyard or a metaphor for
something else, and whose vineyard is it? Are these verses related to vv. 8–10
and, if so, how? The answers to these questions are, I propose, simpler and
more straightforward than commentators have hitherto recognized.
The issue in vv. 8–9 appears to be the little sister’s chastity, because these
verses are about her person and the context is betrothal.2 If “wall” and “door”
are metaphors for the girl’s virtue, are they antithetical (being a wall is good
but being a door is bad) or complementary (parts of one and the same image,
a walled city)? The wall metaphor suggests inaccessibility. The action that will
be taken, building upon it a tier decorated in silver,3 might be a measure to
1. Murphy, for example, says of vv. 8–12: “These verses introduce a vignette that has
no obvious connection with the immediate context” (Roland E. Murphy, The Song of
Songs: A Commentary on the Book of Canticles or the Song of Songs [Hermeneia; Minneapolis:
Fortress, 1990] 198).
2. Compare 1 Sam 25:39; Francis Landy, however, maintains that betrothal is too narrow
a context (Paradoxes of Paradise: Identity and Difference in the Song of Songs [Shefﬁeld: Almond,
1983] 163), and Fox speculates that chastity may not be the issue; see below (pp. 274–75).
3. The word hryf refers to encampments in Gen 25:16; Num 31:10; Ezek 25:4; Ps
69:26[25]; and 1 Chr 6:39[54]; perhaps originally it referred to rows of stones used to mark

271
strengthen the wall, but the use of silver suggests that the ediﬁce is for show—
an adornment, presumably to enhance the young woman’s appeal to potential
suitors. The door, on the other hand, since it can be either closed or open,
represents both inaccessibility and accessibility. The door is an important part
of the metaphor in v. 9 for precisely this reason, though here the idea seems to
be that it is closed: the word used is tld, the door itself, whose function is
normally to bar entry, rather than jtp, the doorway, which allows it.4 To
panel it in precious cedarwood would be a costly way to reinforce it but a
most impressive form of ornamentation. It is difﬁcult to think of this speech as
anything other than playful; its cryptic, question-and-answer style makes it
seem almost like a riddle. A moral lesson about the rewards of chastity and the
punishment for sexual freedom, as some interpreters read it, or, worse, a
warning or threat, would be out of place after the climactic paean to love in
vv. 6–7, for if torrents cannot threaten the ﬂame of love, how can social re-
strictions intimidate it?5
In vv. 8–9 the little sister, when she comes of age, is metaphorically de-
scribed as a walled city, fortiﬁed and decorated. In v. 10 the speaker takes up
the wall image and applies it to herself. She is a wall, but in contrast to what is
said about the little sister, she requires neither reinforcement to protect her
from suitors nor ornamentation to attract one. She possesses her own en-
hancement, an erotic one, her breasts. The phrase µwlç taxwmk in v. 10b is
difﬁcult. It is reasonable to assume that the comparison, ‘like (k) one who
brings/ﬁnds peace’, because it too is a metaphor, continues the metaphor of
the walled city and that, like the rest of the imagery in vv. 8–10a, this phrase
too has a sexual signiﬁcance. The woman is (like) a wall, her breasts are (like)
towers, and she is like one who brings, or ﬁnds, peace (µwlç is her answer to
the military allusion). Whether we take taxwm as the Hiphil of axy ‘one who
brings’ or as the Qal active participle of axm ‘one who ﬁnds’ makes little dif-
ference. In the context of a city under siege, to bring peace signiﬁes surrender,

Commentary (AB 7C; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1977) 680. In Ezek 46:23 it is applied
to rows of masonry. The idea seems to be a course or tier decorated in silver crowning the
wall, although it could be a structural feature; compare “parapet” (reb, nab), “battlement”
(nrsv, njb, jpsv).

272
and to ﬁnd peace is to have the offer of surrender accepted.6 The signiﬁcance
of the door in v. 9, which could be opened or closed, now becomes clear. A
city that surrenders does not have its walls besieged, because it opens its doors.
The woman is both a wall and a door (like the little sister in v. 9), but in her
case the door has been opened so that her lover can take possession of the city.
“In his eyes” can only refer to her lover; she speaks here about his perspec-
tive, the way he sees her. Throughout the Song he speaks about how he sees
her;7 here she describes how (she believes) he perceives her—like a beautiful
fortiﬁed city offering peace, that is, as surrendering to him. There is a rather
nice irony here because, whereas she speaks of surrender to him, he speaks of
being captured by her (4:9; 7:6[5]).
If the woman is the obvious choice as the speaker of v. 10 (and there is no
reason to posit anyone else as speaker), who speaks in vv. 8–9? Proposals for
identifying the speakers of these verses include a group of suitors,8 the woman
in v. 8 and the woman’s brothers in v. 9,9 the brothers in v. 8 and suitors in
v. 9,10 one brother in v. 8 and another in v. 9.11 Goulder, looking back to the
previous verse, reads vv. 8–9 as the scorning words of those who in v. 7 ridi-
cule the offer to buy love with money, “relatives of the (hypothetical) girl,”
who, in turn, are quoted by the woman.12 Keel assigns vv. 8–9 to older sib-
lings (including sisters) of a girl who has not yet reached puberty and proposes
that their words are quoted by one of the sisters (but not the little sister) in
v. 10.13 Such proposals as these involve either bringing hitherto unidentiﬁed
characters onto the scene or rather arbitrarily carving up this speech, or both.

The Little Sister and Solomon’s Vineyard
273
Most interpreters opt for a simpler solution and assign vv. 8–9 to the wom-
an’s brothers (who were mentioned earlier in 1:6), and v. 10 to the woman,
whom they identify with the little sister spoken of here. The brothers, so the
argument goes, are concerned with their sister’s chastity, as they were in 1:6,
and they speak here about the measures they will take to protect it. It is, how-
ever, odd that the brothers would speak now, for the ﬁrst and only time in the
Song. It is also a bit strange that they would claim that their sister has no breasts,
if, as she says, they are clearly observable. Have they simply failed to notice that
she has grown up? A number of commentators get around these problems by
proposing that the woman is quoting words that her brothers spoke in the
past.14 But when the woman is quoting—or, better, putting words in someone
else’s mouth15—it is obvious she is doing so. When she quotes her lover in
2:10–14, she introduces his words with, “My lover answered and said to me.”
Similarly, in 5:2–8 the context makes clear that his words in vv. 2–3, which
seem to be spoken in the present, are part of a story that she is narrating, a story
that blurs the distinctions between past and present. To assume that in 8:8–9
the woman is quoting her brothers, who appear only in one verse of the Song,
involves explaining the poem by appealing to a “story” that lies behind the
poem, outside the poem: at some time in the past the woman’s brothers made
a statement about her readiness for marriage, a statement so important that she
responds to it now. Why now? one wonders.

15. To say she is quoting implies that someone said these words at some other time but
we only hear of them now; in other words, a “story” behind the poem. But the woman in
2:8–17 and 5:2–8 is the narrator: the poet puts words into her mouth, creating her speech,
in which she puts words into her lover’s mouth, creating his speech. On the complexity of
the narratorial voice, see my “‘Voice of My Lover’: Double Voice and Poetic Illusion in
Song of Songs 2.8–3.5,” in Reading from Right to Left: Essays in Honour of David J. A. Clines

he rightly criticizes interpreters for postulating a situation between the woman and her
brothers for which there is no evidence, Keel’s conclusion that “the siblings lend their sup-
port to their younger sister, who is not ready to go too quickly into a union planned by the
parents or assumed by some admirer” is similar in that it also creates a plot.

It is not altogether surprising that commentators think of the woman’s
brothers when they read these verses, for the Song encourages us to make such
connections by returning at the end to themes of the beginning. Vineyards
(µymrk) and vineyard keepers (µyrfn), about which the woman spoke in 1:5–
6, are once again the subject of attention in 8:10–12, and, because the distinc-
tive phrase ‘my vineyard which is mine’ (ylç ymrk) appears only in 1:6 and
8:12, it is tempting to think of it as the same vineyard in both cases. Solomon
is mentioned in 8:11–12 and 1:5. Because it makes sense for the woman’s
brothers to be concerned with making marriage arrangements for her (espe-
cially because her father is never mentioned in the Song), are the sentiments
of vv. 8–9 not likely to be theirs? Their anger in 1:6 was not explained. It is
often assumed that it has to do with their sister’s failure to guard her chastity,
metaphorically expressed as not keeping her own vineyard (though, curiously,
she does not present her failure to keep her vineyard and their anger as cause
and effect). If that is the case, then here, as there, the brothers are concerned
with their sister’s chastity. It is worth noting, however, that there are no verbal
correspondences between vv. 8–10 and 1:5–6; the correspondences are all be-
tween 1:5–6 and vv. 11–12.
That vv. 8–9 belong to the brothers is Fox’s view, and the interpretation he
offers has the merit of not requiring a story line according to which the broth-
ers said something in the past and the woman now quotes it. Rather, the
brothers speak directly here in vv. 8–9, offering reconciliation in place of their
earlier rebuke in 1:6. They now consent “in principle” to their little sister’s
marriage and express their willingness to provide for her, but they tease her by
suggesting she is still too young (“she has no breasts”). In v. 10, she counters
their view by describing her breasts as towers. “She is,” Fox concludes, “grate-
ful for their consent and promise, and in v. 10 expresses pleasure at their assent
to her marriage.” The issue of her chastity “may simply be irrelevant to the
verse.”16
Fox ﬁnds in 1:5–6 and 8:6–12 a “loose narrative framework” within which
the “basic love story repeats itself.”17 This framework “suggests a certain de-
velopment in [the woman’s] relations with her brothers,” who, in the end,
agree to give her in marriage in the face of her declaration of the power of
love, though they still have doubts about her maturity.18 It is unusual to ﬁnd
Fox engaged in a practice quite common among Song of Songs commenta-
tors, reading for the plot—interpreting the text as though some “story” lies

behind it.19 Indeed, Fox, more than any other commentator except perhaps
Landy, is keenly aware that we are reading a poem and that the female and
male lovers of the Song are personae created for us by the poet. There is no
relationship, no “story,” apart from that on the page before us.
Fox assumes that the brothers are the speakers in vv. 8–9 because, in an-
cient Israelite society, they would have been the ones responsible for caring for
her needs at marriage. But it is nonetheless strange that they should suddenly
take on an important role in the Song, where gender relations seem rather un-
conventional—and a speaking role at that.20 Because he takes the woman to
be the little sister, Fox needs to explain the discrepancy between the brothers’
claim that she has no breasts and her claim that her breasts are like towers,
which he does by concluding that they are teasing her. And since the brothers
are talking about the Song’s female protagonist in vv. 8–9, chastity (which
seems to most commentators to be the subject of these verses) may not be the
issue, apparently because the Song, which does not make a virtue of chastity,
gives the audience every reason to believe that the woman has had sexual in-
tercourse with her lover.21
But what leads Fox to conclude that the brothers consent to their sister’s
marriage in v. 9 and that she is pleased and grateful in response in v. 10, if not
reading a presumed “story” of their relationship between the lines? Because he
understands the brothers’ words in v. 9 not as conditional (“if she is . . .”) but
as a promise to take care of their sister, Fox translates µa as interrogative: “Is
she a wall? We’ll build on it a silver turret. Is she a door? We’ll panel it with a
cedar board.”22 In the context of such a promise, MT’s “in his eyes like one
who ﬁnds good will” (v. 10) “makes little sense.”23 Because he assumes the
19. Fiona C. Black sees its ﬂirtation with a plot as an aspect of the Song’s “amatory tech-
nique,” by which it seduces its readers to ask, “What happens?” (“What Is My Beloved? On
Erotic Reading and the Song of Songs,” in The Labour of Reading: Desire, Alienation and Bib-
lical Interpretation [ed. Fiona C. Black, Roland Boer, and Erin Runions; Semeia Studies; At-
lanta: Scholars Press, 1999] 42–44). Commentators frequently speak of the woman and the
man as though they were real people with a “history,” when, in fact, the Song is perfectly
understandable on its own as a lovers’ dialogue (with an audience within the poem, with
whom the lovers occasionally interact). If we take it on its own terms, as a lyric poem for
three voices, it is easy to see how it “works” without supplying settings, background situ-
ations, and so forth. The only parts of the Song that have a plot are the “stories” told by the
woman (2:8–3:5; 5:2–6:3). Telling stories in which she and her lover are characters is the
woman’s principal way of talking about love in the Song; see my “Poetic Genius.”

lations between the sexes in comparison to what we know of ancient Israelite social reality.

woman is addressing a group in v. 10 (which, in turn, is because he assumes
the brothers are the speakers in v. 9), Fox reads ‘in your eyes’ (µkyny[b) for
MT’s ‘in his eyes’ (wyny[b). For MT’s taxwmk he reads taxwm, and, citing Jer
16:5, he takes µwlç in the sense of ‘friendly attitude’ or ‘favor.’ Thus he ren-
ders v. 10b, “So now I’ve become in your eyes one who ﬁnds good will.” He
concludes, “The Shulammite says to her brothers: since you now assent to my
marriage, I know that I am ﬁnally enjoying your favor, in place of your earlier
unkind treatment of me.”24 Although Fox avoids the usual assumptions, his
reading of vv. 8–9 rests upon others. In particular, having the brothers speak
here, for the ﬁrst and only time in the Song, is the most unsatisfactory part of
Fox’s interpretation. It gives the brothers an important role in the Song that
the text does not warrant.
There are only three clearly identiﬁable speaking voices in the Song: those
of the woman, the man, and the women of Jerusalem. Is it not possible, in-
deed likely, that these verses belong to one of them? Nowhere else except v. 9,
in fact, does Fox ever assign a speaking part to anyone else.
As Fox notes, 8:8–9 would not belong to the man, who “is unlikely to re-
fer to his beloved as ‘our sister’ and who certainly would not say that she has
no breasts.”25 They could, however (and Fox allows for this possibility), be the
words of the women of Jerusalem.26 Whereas the woman’s brothers are inci-
dental characters in the poem, like the watchmen (3:3–4) or queens and con-
cubines (6:8–9), the women of Jerusalem are not. Like the female and male
personae, whose voices the poet uses to explore the nature of love from both
points of view, a woman’s and a man’s, the women of Jerusalem have a dis-
tinct and vital poetic function: they provide an audience within the poem
whose presence facilitates the reader’s entry into the lovers’ seemingly private
world of erotic intimacy, thereby making the Song less voyeuristic.27 That the
women of Jerusalem should speak in 8:8–9—at the very point when the Song
has reached its climax in the afﬁrmation of the strength of love (8:6–7)—is in
keeping with the way they function elsewhere, to remind its audience, by
their presence, that the Song is addressed to us.28

28. For example, the woman reminds us of their presence at a moment of intimacy by
addressing them directly in 2:5–7 and 3:5, and in 5:1 they encourage the lovers in their
lovemaking.

The Little Sister and Solomon’s Vineyard
277
If we view Song 8:8–10 as a dialogue between these women (vv. 8–9) and
the woman (v. 10), there is no reason to assume that they are talking about
her. They could be speaking, hypothetically, as it were, about a girl who has
not reached sexual maturity, whom they refer to as their “little sister.” The
woman’s reply in v. 10 contrasts her situation with that of the young girl—and
the discrepancy between “she has no breasts” and “my breasts are like towers”
no longer requires explanation (viz., the reference is to the past; the speakers
are teasing). The tone, which appears to be playful, is reminiscent of what also
seems to be banter at the beginning of the Song (1:7–8), where the speaker(s)
with whom the woman interacts is also unidentiﬁed. It is also possible that the
Jerusalem women are the speakers in 1:8, for the woman is addressed as “most
beautiful of women,” and elsewhere only they use this epithet for her (5:9;
6:1).29 Despite the advantage that it does not require having someone speak
who has neither spoken before nor been spoken to before in the Song, assign-
ing vv. 8–9 to the women of Jerusalem is not altogether satisfactory. It seems
a curious, and wholly unanticipated, exchange for them to be holding with
the woman at this point in the poem.
This brings us to the woman, the female protagonist of the Song of Songs,
in whose mouth the entire speech in vv. 8–10 makes perfect sense. There is
no reason to identify the woman who speaks in v. 10 as the little sister of
vv. 8–9 unless we assume that the speakers of vv. 8–9 are the brothers. Once
we recognize that the speaker of v. 10 and the little sister spoken of in vv. 8–
9 are not the same person, everything falls into place. There is no need to
specify the identity of the little sister, as, for example, Landy does when he
proposes that the woman is speaking about her little sister.30 This proposal too
involves supplying a context, another plot of sorts, in which the woman’s fam-
ily includes a little sister (whom we hear of for the ﬁrst time), and a situation
in which the woman speaks in the plural (“we”) on behalf of the family. As
Rudolph observes, the mention of another sister is without interest and has no
point.31 But not if the little sister is merely hypothetical, the subject of an ex-
ample story that the woman tells in vv. 8–9 in order to make her point in
v. 10. That this is the case becomes clear in the light of vv. 11–12.
Who is the speaker in 8:11–12? The phrase ylç ymrk appears in 1:6, where
it is spoken by the woman, and this leads some critics to conclude that the

woman is the speaker here.32 These verses would thus be a continuation of her
speech in v. 10, in which she speaks about herself.33 But the context, where the
speaker’s vineyard is preferred over Solomon’s vineyard, makes it more likely
that the man speaks here. Moreover, the vineyard is “before me.” ‘Before me’
(ynpl) is often understood in the sense of “at my disposal” (as in Gen 13:9;
20:15; 24:51; 34:10; 47:6; 1 Sam 16:16).34 Fox interprets it as “near at hand”;
that is, in the man’s care, in the center of his attention, as in Prov 4:3; Isa 53:2;
and Gen 17:18.35 I take “before me” literally to mean that the woman is in the
presence of her lover as he speaks these words. In 1:6 the woman announces
“my own vineyard I have not kept,” which, among other things, may suggest
that she has given herself to her lover or that she needs tending. Now the man
declares that this vineyard belongs to him; he will tend it.
Landy rightly and astutely identiﬁes these verses as a similitude or parable
based on such features as its setting in an indeterminate time, its semilegendary
protagonist, its formulaic opening, and its apparent triviality. Its enigmatic na-
ture is part of its appeal: “the parable sets up a mystery.”36 Since “vineyard” is
a loaded term in the Song, we may suspect that Solomon’s vineyard is some-
thing more than a collection of grapevines in a place called Baal-hamon.
Meanings of the name, ‘owner of wealth’ and ‘husband of a multitude’, sug-
gest that it was chosen to emphasize Solomon’s afﬂuence—his vast riches, his
holdings of land, his many wives. Two things are noteworthy about this vine-
yard: Solomon does not tend it himself, and its produce is very valuable. I take
the second couplet in v. 11 in a general sense to mean its produce is worth (at
least) a thousand silver pieces, a substantial sum (cf. Isa 7:23, where a vineyard
with a thousand vines is worth a thousand shekels of silver). The alternative
(“each [i.e., the keepers] would bring for its fruit a thousand silver pieces”)
seems less likely, both because it leaves us with a complicated business transac-
tion to explain (the keepers pay Solomon a thousand silver pieces; he then

Paradise, 154; cf. Munro, Spikenard and Saffron, 41–42.
33. There is no reason to split the verses between the chorus (v. 11) and the woman
(v. 12), as Goulder and Garrett do (Goulder, Song of Fourteen Songs, 68–69; Garrett, Song of
Songs, 258–59). Garrett sees Song 8:8–12 as a canto of two stanzas, in each of which the
chorus “sings” ﬁrst (vv. 8–9, 11) and then the soprano (his term for the female voice) re-
sponds (vv. 10, 12). But he admits, “This canto is thus unusual for the fact that the majority
of the lyrics are sung neither by the tenor nor the soprano but by the chorus” (p. 259).

pays them two hundred), and because in v. 12 the speaker tells Solomon he
can keep his thousand (not a thousand from each keeper, though that could be
implied).
In v. 12, the man compares his vineyard to Solomon’s, and here the sexual
referent of “vineyard” becomes apparent. He prefers his own vineyard (his
lover) to Solomon’s vineyard, which, because it belongs to the king, must be
a very ﬁne one, and, because it needs keepers, must be extensive. If Solomon’s
vineyard is his harem, v. 12 (“you can have the thousand, Solomon”) may hint
at its legendary size, a thousand women (1 Kgs 11:3). The man’s vineyard
means more to him than a royal harem. His vineyard is priceless; no other
woman can compare with her (cf. 6:8–10). What is more, he has his vineyard
to himself, unlike Solomon, who relies on vineyard keepers to tend his.
Because Solomon’s vineyard works on two levels, literal and metaphorical,
whereas the man’s is clearly metaphorical (the woman), we should perhaps not
expect the correspondences between the two vineyards to work completely.
The motif of vineyard keepers allows the man to illustrate indirectly his sole
responsibility for his vineyard. But whereas vineyard keepers could allude to
harem guards (cf. Esth 2:3), for whose upkeep Solomon would have had to
provide (“two hundred [silver pieces] for the keepers of its fruit”), they do not
tend Solomon’s vineyard in the way the man tends his vineyard (unless this is
a sexual joke at Solomon’s expense).
Does this vignette make fun of Solomon, who “possessed so many women
that he could not keep their ‘fruit’ to himself ”?37 Might it be critical? Falk
thinks these verses reject a view of woman as sexual object or sexual property
(the relationship of Solomon to his harem) and advocate the kind of loving re-
lationship the man has with his beloved.38 Longman proposes that the lovers’
exclusive relationship is implicitly favored over Solomon’s polygamy.39 I ﬁnd
it hard to believe that Solomon is the butt of a joke or the object of criticism
here, for, if he were, then we would have here a very different treatment of
Solomon and royalty from what we ﬁnd elsewhere in the Song, where King
Solomon is portrayed positively (3:6–11) and the man assumes a royal guise as
“the king” (1:4, 12; 7:6[5]).
The man’s speech is a similitude, an example story. So too, I suggest, is the
woman’s. Both example stories have an enigmatic quality, as if the speakers
wished to engage the audience in solving a puzzle. Moreover, the two speeches

in vv. 8–10 and vv. 11–12 are formally quite similar. Both begin as a story
that seems to be irrelevant: “We have a little sister . . .”; “Solomon had a vine-
yard. . . .” The woman is not the “little sister,” as most commentators think,
nor is she putting words into her brothers’ mouths, as many assume. She is the
narrator of this vignette, and the little sister of whom she speaks is ﬁctive in the
same way that Solomon’s vineyard in Baal-hamon is. Both the sister and Solo-
mon’s vineyard are foils that allow the speakers to say something about them-
selves. They say it metaphorically, and poetic metaphor is by its very nature
plurisigniﬁcant, but the thrust is fairly clear. She says that, unlike the girl in her
example, for whom preparations will be made when she comes of age, she
needs no such attention, since she (a fortiﬁed city) has already offered herself to
her lover. He says that his vineyard (the woman herself ) is worth more than
Solomon’s and he alone will tend it.
We do not need a background explanation, especially if we think of Fox’s
proposal about the Song as entertainment,40 and we do not need any other
characters besides the woman, the man, and the chorus if “the singers repre-
sent personae before an audience.”41 In the dialogue format of the Song
(which, in any event, lends itself to performance), if “my own vineyard is be-
fore me” in v. 12 suggests that the woman is in her lover’s presence, so also “in
his eyes” in v. 10 of her speech allows us to imagine that he is present and may
even be looking at her as she speaks.
Both vignettes seem to have marriage arrangements as their backdrop,42
not explicitly, since marriage is not the subject of the Song, but in a way that
is lighthearted and at the same time leads to serious avowals of commitment.
They are thus well suited to their context here at the conclusion of the Song.
In what appears to be a detached, playful manner (detached because social
conventions are pushed aside by the overwhelming power of love, vv. 6–7),43
the woman speaks about preparations made when a girl reaches marriageable
age, the time when she will be “spoken for” (vv. 8–9). As far as she herself is
concerned, it is a moot question. She has already reached womanhood and she
has surrendered herself to her lover (v. 10); in a sense, she has been spoken for
40. Fox, The Song of Songs, 247–50 et passim.
41. Ibid., 256.
42. A wedding provides a context for entertainment too; compare Samson’s cryptic
riddle at his wedding feast and its answer, which is also a riddle, Judg 14:14, 18.
43. It is only partially true to say that society’s values are not the Song’s values or that
social conventions are ignored; see Landy, Paradoxes of Paradise, 152–76. In 8:1, just before
the paean to love in vv. 6–7, the woman wishes her lover were like a brother so that she
could kiss him openly in the street without incurring social disapproval, and even the paean
to love acknowledges society’s judgment of one who would offer money for love.

The Little Sister and Solomon’s Vineyard
281
(not necessarily formally, since that is not really the issue). The man conﬁrms
their mutual commitment by declaring that she belongs to him: she is his very
own vineyard, worth more than any vineyard a king might possess (v. 12). As
elsewhere in the Song, they speak along gender-determined lines.44 She deals
with a subject that can only have been of great concern for women. In a soci-
ety where women were under the control of their fathers or other male rela-
tives before marriage, where marriages were usually arranged, and where the
virginity of the bride was an important issue, what role do matters of the heart
play? He thinks in terms of competition with other men, and the imagery he
draws on (vineyards, hired workers to tend them, and payment for the pro-
duce) belongs to the sphere of economic livelihood.
Perhaps the woman’s speech contains an implicit criticism of the practice of
paying a bride price,45 and possibly the man’s speech is critical of a man’s hav-
ing many wives, but the Song is not polemical. Rather, in their dialogue in
8:8–12 the Song’s lovers deﬁne themselves against social concerns that do not,
in their view, apply to them, as all lovers are inclined to do.
In Song 8:6–7 the poet placed a profound declaration of love in the mouth
of the woman. Saying more on the topic of the strength of love would risk
allowing the poem to slip into sentimentality. Moreover, the poet knows that
showing is more effective than telling, for apart from Song 8:6–7 the poet re-
veals what love is like by having the lovers speak about love as they experience
it rather than about love in general. After the woman’s erotic imperative, “Set
me as the seal upon your heart . . . for love is strong as death . . . ,” the lovers
offer further afﬁrmations of their love in vv. 8–12. The tone becomes lighter,
but the theme is still that of love’s power.46
If we take as our clue the formal correspondences between these two vi-
gnettes, or similitudes, Song 8:8–14 can be most readily understood as a dia-
logue between the lovers in which, ﬁrst, they each tell a story in which they
speak metaphorically about themselves and their beloved (the woman in vv. 8–
10 and the man in vv. 11–12).47 Then, in a passionately serious and urgent
vein, they express once again their desire for each other: he, by asking to hear

seeing these verses as dialogue; the lovers are always speaking to each other, even when they
speak about the other in the third person (e.g., 2:2–3).

her voice (v. 13), and she, by answering in a way that does not allow the dia-
logue to end, though the poem comes to its close (v. 14). Her speech thus
moves from an urgent appeal to him (“set me as the seal upon your heart . . .
for love is strong as death,” vv. 6–7) to similitude (vv. 8–10), and his from si-
militude (vv. 11–12) to an urgent appeal to her (“let me hear,” v. 13).
The advantage of the interpretation of vv. 8–12 offered above is that it re-
quires the least explanation from outside the text. As the similarities in both
form (similitude) and theme (commitment, possibly marriage) between vv. 8–
10 and vv. 11–12 conﬁrm, like most of the Song, Song 8:8–12 is a lovers’
dialogue.

Answering Questions, Questioning Answers: 
The Rhetoric of Interrogatives in the 
Speeches of Job and His Friends
Dennis R. Magary
Trinity Evangelical Divinity School
Interrogatives have always raised questions. The scant treatment of inter-
rogatives in most elementary Hebrew grammars and the limited discussion
provided in intermediate and advanced grammars leave the impression that
there may be little to be said about them.1 To suggest or to imply that there
may be little more to be said about interrogatives is simply not true. Interrog-
atives are, indeed, the “little people” of Hebrew grammar. They are small.
They do their job. They make things happen. But even when we have seen
the results of their work, verbs and nouns and even prepositions and conjunc-
tions continue to spur our interest. So this chapter will draw attention to the
“little people” and will focus our attention in this case on interrogatives in the
speeches of Job and his friends.
I certainly do not want to give the impression that there has been little or
no investigation of interrogatives. There has been signiﬁcant work done, par-
ticularly on rhetorical questions in the Hebrew Bible. Rhetorical questions

have been studied in speciﬁc biblical texts and within canonical books: J. Ken-
neth Kuntz’s chapter in Writing and Reading the Scroll of Isaiah entitled “The
Form, Location, and Function of Rhetorical Questions in Deutero-Isaiah,”
Lénart de Regt’s 1996 essay, “Discourse Implications of Rhetorical Questions
in Job, Deuteronomy and the Minor Prophets,” Michael Fox’s insightful ar-
ticle in 1981 entitled, “Job 38 and God’s Rhetoric,” and Walter Bruegge-
mann’s 1973 article, “Jeremiah’s Use of Rhetorical Questions”—to mention
just a few.2 But interrogatives are about more than “asking.” It is, in fact, their
versatility and utility that make them such valuable linguistic markers.
The purpose of this essay is twofold. First, I will identify and characterize
the interrogative set found in the speeches of Job and his friends ( Job 3–37),
and second, I will describe the function of the interrogatives as a set in chaps.
3–37. I will demonstrate that the interrogatives in Job 3–37 work best when
we allow them to work together. I have chosen to limit this analysis to the
speeches of Job and his friends. I will not attempt to characterize the use of
interrogatives in either the narrative prologue or epilogue, nor will I address
the use of interrogatives in the divine speeches.
Twelve different interrogatives are found in the speeches of Job and his
friends. The most common are the interrogative preﬁx h (58x); the animate
pronoun ym (41x); the inanimate pronoun hm (52x); and the particle µa (20x).
The other interrogatives used are the interrogative adverbs hml (9x) and [wdm
(6x); the locative adverbs ya (2x), hya (7x), and hpya (1x); the temporal adverb
ytm (1x); the adverb ˆa (3x); and one occurrence of the particle πa.3 In addi-
tion, there are six instances in these chapters (7:20, 11:3, 15:3, 17:16, 32:16,
37:18) in which an interrogatory is unmarked.
Interrogatives are found throughout the dialogue. Every one of the 23
speeches attests at least 3 interrogative clauses. Most have a minimum of be-
tween 5 and 8. The highest number of interrogatives appears in Job’s speeches

(perhaps not surprisingly), but particularly the speeches in the ﬁrst cycle. Job
responds to Eliphaz with 31 interrogative clauses (that is 31 clauses to Eliphaz’s
9). Job responds to Bildad with 23 clauses (that is 23 to Bildad’s 8). Job re-
sponds to Zophar with 28 interrogative clauses (that is 28 to Zophar’s 10).
Each of Job’s friends uses at least 6 different interrogative pronouns and parti-
cles. Job uses all 12. Interrogatives are found in every chapter: 1 clause in
chaps. 29, 30, and 32; 2 clauses in chaps. 5, 20, and 24; 3 clauses in chaps. 12,
16, and 18; and ﬁnally, 13 clauses in chap. 13, 14 clauses in chap. 21, and 15
clauses in chap. 6.
Of the 889 verses that constitute the speeches of Job and his friends, 182
verses contain interrogative structures. Over 20 percent (20.5%) of the dia-
logue between Job and his friends employ interrogatives. Embedded in these
182 verses are 265 interrogative clauses. But why? What is clear is that inter-
rogatives constitute an integral part of the fabric of discourse between Job and
his friends. The interrogatives are prominent. They are persistent. This is how
the characters speak to one another. It is how they say what they have to say.
And it is how the book communicates its meaning to us. The interrogative in
chaps. 3–37 is a major literary device that gives structure, coherence, and
movement within the dialogue and reinforces the issues that the book is prob-
ing. This brings us to a consideration of how the interrogatives are used. Here
we will take into account the versatility of the interrogatives that enables them
to function syntactically in ways other than to introduce a question. I will
consider, ﬁrst, non-question uses of the interrogative in chaps. 3–37. I will
then give attention to the more-typical function of the interrogative—namely,
marking questions.
Not all interrogatives in chaps. 3–37 mark questions. The animate and in-
animate pronouns are used in ways other than to pose questions. For example,
8 times in chaps. 3–37, the inanimate pronoun hm is employed to mark the
grammatical object.

Another interrogative found in these chapters is the collocation ˆty ym,
which conveys a strong wish or desire on the part of the speaker. Nine times
the animate interrogative pronoun ym is collocated with the Qal yiq†ol of the
verb ˆtn. Worth noting here is that 8 of the 9 occurrences are found in the
speeches of Job, and all but 3 of them express a yearning for God to respond,
to manifest himself in some way.5
Here (in 6:8), of course, Job is mocking Eliphaz’s use of hwqt in 4:6 and 5:16.

4. The identiﬁcation of these words as belonging to Job is widely held (e.g., John Hart-
ley, The Book of Job [NICOT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1988] 24–26, 361–62). It is my
understanding, however, that the words of 26:7 are more likely those of Bildad than of Job
(e.g., Carol Newsom, “The Book of Job: Introduction, Commentary, and Reﬂections,” in
NIB 4:516). Bildad the Shuhite replies (25:1) in 25:1–6. Job, cutting Bildad off, replies
(26:1) in 26:1–4. Bildad then continues his speech in 26:5–14. And in 27:1–23 Job con-
tinues his discourse (27:1).

The other ˆty ym appears in Zophar’s ﬁrst speech. This is the only time in the
book that ˆty ym is not in initial position.
The exclamatory use of the interrogative pronoun is found 5 times, always
using the inanimate interrogative hm. What is of particular interest here is that
4 of the 5 exclamations using the interrogative are uttered by Job. The ex-
clamatory use of the interrogative hm is ﬁrst found in Job’s response to Eliphaz,
where it is paired with hm heading a rhetorical question:
The other occurrences are all in one chapter, chap. 26. This time Bildad, hav-
ing just begun his speech (25:1–6), is interrupted by Job in 26:2. In back-to-
back bicola, using hm, Job declares sarcastically:
He continues in 26:4 with a rhetorical question, a shift marked by a double-ym
construction:
The other appearance of an exclamatory hm is in Bildad’s third speech:

The interrogatives that serve a function other than inquiry, that is, the use
of hm in object constructions, the use of ˆty ym to convey a strong wish, and
the exclamatory use of the inanimate pronoun are found predominantly in the
words of Job.
Having considered the broader utility of the interrogative in Job 3–37, we
now give attention to the principal role of the interrogative in the speeches of
Job and his friends: introducing questions. The interrogative set that we have
identiﬁed exhibits three basic types of questions: (1) questions of fact, or cir-
cumstantial questions; (2) exclamatory questions; and (3) rhetorical questions.6
The vast majority of times, the questions (80.4% [213 out of 265]) are rhetori-
cal. I have identiﬁed 23 information-seeking questions in the speeches, most
of which are “why” and “where” inquiries, 6 of which are within embedded
speech.
6. One other type of question is attested in Biblical Hebrew, although not in these chap-
ters: alternative questions (Waltke and O’Connor, Introduction, 316).

In the remaining instances, the interrogative is found in embedded speech:
Apart from these information-seeking questions, rhetorical questions dom-
inate the literary landscape. I mentioned earlier the 182 verses that host 265
interrogative clauses. Of these 265 clauses, 213 are rhetorical questions. Robert
Koops explains: “In an ordinary conversation . . . a question is assumed to be
a request for information. When it becomes evident to the hearer that the ‘in-
formation’ in question is already well known to both of them, he understands
that the speaker must be ﬂouting the expected pattern, and thereby doing
something else, namely emphasizing a point.”7 So these are questions not seek-
ing information but seeking to make a point. So, are rhetorical questions ques-
tions or statements? Well, they are both or either! As Jürgen Schmidt-
Radefeldt points out, the addressee, the other participant in the dialogue, “can
‘answer the question’ and/or ‘contradict the statement.’”8 It is up to the ad-
dressee whether he accepts the rhetorical question as an assertion or, contrary
to the speaker’s expectation, he capitalizes on the interrogative element in the
rhetorical situation and takes issue with it, which is almost invariably what hap-
pens in chaps. 3–37. The effect is felt by both the addressee and the audience.
In these chapters two types of rhetorical questions can be identiﬁed. In the
ﬁrst type, the speaker puts forward a question but then immediately answers it
himself. On 2 occasions in chaps. 3–37, an answer accompanies the rhetorical
question. Again, this type of rhetorical question is found only in the speeches

of Job. In 14:4a Job asks,9 amfm rwhf ˆtyAym ‘Who can make the clean out of
the unclean?’ He immediately answers, dja al ‘No one!’ In 23:6 Job imagines
a direct encounter with God. Prior to this, God’s overwhelming power has al-
ways been an obstacle to Job. But here Job sees things differently. Job’s answer
to his own question makes this clear to us.
The second type of rhetorical question is, as we have noted, an assertion in
interrogative form. The majority of these occur as a bicolon. The most com-
mon rhetorical interrogative structure in these chapters is the interrogative h.
Thirty-three times the h marks a single question or is followed by µa at the
beginning of the second half of the same verse. There are 15 instances in
which the interrogative h heads the ﬁrst colon, and the particle µa follows,
heading the second.10 For example:
In 12 cases, the h interrogative is preﬁxed to the negative particle al.11 An af-
ﬁrmative, but unspoken, answer is assumed. For example:
9. Some treat the collocation ˆty ym here as a ﬁxed expression indicating strong desire,
that is, “O that a clean person could come from an unclean person. Not one can.”

Twenty-three times, the preﬁxed h is present only in the ﬁrst line, although
the interrogation carries over into the second line. In one instance (10:3), the
preﬁxed h, present only in the ﬁrst line, extends over three lines.
Three times the interrogative h preﬁxes the nominal vy:
In each case of the double rhetorical question using the interrogative h, the
second line emphasizes or elaborates on the assertion that underlies the initial
question.
The interrogative adverb hml is found 9 times but only in the speeches of
Job. Job’s fundamental complaints against God and his friends are given voice
through these 9 questions: his wish that he had never been born, his confusion
over why God is attacking him and hiding from him, and his deep disappoint-
ment in his friends for giving him everything but comfort.

Having considered the basic types of questions that constitute the interrogative
set within chaps. 3–37, namely, questions of fact, exclamatory questions, and
rhetorical questions, I will now turn our attention to their function.
First, the interrogatives in chaps. 3–37 contribute to the delimitaton of lit-
erary boundaries on all levels of the text. Almost half the speeches begin inter-
rogatively. The effect is one of immediate engagement between speaker and
the one spoken to, and between speaker and reader. Using either a rhetorical
question (or questions) or an exclamation, 11 of the 23 speeches in chaps. 3–
37 begin with an interrogative component. All ﬁve speaking characters do
this. A well-placed rhetorical question in this book is worth a thousand words.
The ﬁrst words we hear from the friends who have come to comfort Job—
who upon arrival saw that his pain was so great that they did not speak a word
to him for seven days and seven nights (2:13)—the very ﬁrst words we hear
are put to Job as a question. It is Eliphaz who asks in 4:2:
The very ﬁrst question posed by the friends focuses on Job and his inability to
bear the burden of words. The second question turns back on Eliphaz and his
inability not to utter them. As a matter of fact, each of the speeches that begins
interrogatively draws attention to the futility and oppressiveness of words.
Bildad begins to build on this. In 8:2–3 he asks:
Rhetorical questions come with inherent risks. One of the risks is that they can
elicit the “wrong” response. For Bildad, it is inconceivable that God, Shaddai,
could or would pervert what is right. But Bildad was not privy to chaps. 1 and
2, and Bildad did not hear God’s admission in 2:3 that he has been unjust with
Job for the sake of the test. Job also was not privy to God’s admission in 2:3,

but Job is convinced that something is wrong. Job’s argument in chap. 9 reveals
that he believes that God does, in fact, pervert justice both in his personal life
(9:17–20) and in the world (9:22–24). Job responds to Bildad’s question with
an unexpected afﬁrmative answer. Rhetorical questions do not require a reply
because only one answer is assumed. An unexpected contrary reply makes the
key issue here regarding God’s justice more prominent and serves to heighten
the level of disagreement between Job and Bildad.
Zophar’s ﬁrst words in 11:2 bring us back to the problem of words:
In the opening speech of the second cycle (15:2–3), Eliphaz is not as sen-
sitive when he speaks the second time. Moreover, he doubles his questions:
Bildad also increases his question quotient when he addresses Job the sec-
ond time (18:2–4):
Job responds with an interrogative adverb this time, one of only 3 in chaps. 3–
37. Bildad has just asked him in 18:2:
Using the same interrogative adverb hnaAd[, Job replies in 19:2:
When he speaks for the third time in 22:2–5, Eliphaz again begins with
questions, even more than before:
Shall a multitude of words go unanswered,
hn[y al µyrbd brh
And a talkative man be acquitted/found in the right?

Job’s opening words in chap. 26 again make use of interrogatives; but this
time (vv. 2–4) his speech is exclamatory, albeit sarcastic, and the singular verb
forms indicate that he is unleashing his exclamations on Bildad speciﬁcally:
What we have seen thus far is that interrogatives serve effectively in chaps. 3–
37 to delimit literary boundaries of the text, with nearly half the speeches be-
ginning with an interrogative component. The distribution of interrogatives
in these chapters shows, too, that interrogatives are frequently used at the be-
ginning of strophes within speeches.12 In addition, one can observe that inter-
rogatives are positioned throughout these chapters in order to conclude
speeches and strophes.
Three speeches have interrogative closure. Job’s ﬁrst response to Eliphaz in
chap. 7 ends with a barrage of interrogatives (vv. 17–21):

or a wise man be useful to himself?

Job’s ﬁnal response to Eliphaz in 24:25 ends with a simple interrogative bicolon.
And the speech that draws to a close in chap. 26, whether one considers it to
be the words of Job or of Bildad, ends (v. 14) with both an exclamatory use of
hm and the use of ym in a simple two-word rhetorical question.
Interrogatives also serve regularly to close off strophes and stanzas. There
are, in fact, 91 strophes in chaps. 3–37 that begin with an interrogative, and
60 that are closed off with an interrogative. Sixteen strophes are composed
entirely of interrogative clauses.13 Only 9 of the 265 interrogative clauses in
these chapters stand inside a strophe.14
A second function of the interrogatives in chaps. 3–37 is to maintain co-
herence within the speeches. The interrogatives help establish connection and
progression within the speeches. Consider 9:2:
Job’s interrogative response to Bildad bears considerable lexical and syntactical
overlap with Eliphaz’s words in 4:17a:
Both cola are rhetorical questions of the same length. Both cola use the noun
vwna for humankind. They both use the yiq†ol form of the verb qdx, and both
refer to God, although 4:17 refers to hwla and 9:2 to la. Job’s rhetorical ques-
tion at the beginning of his speech in chap. 9 alludes to Eliphaz’s words in 4:17

and serves to reintroduce one of the thematic issues in the book. Eliphaz’s
question, concerning whether or not a human may be considered righteous
before God, clearly expects a negative answer. But Eliphaz did not read the
prologue, where three times the narrator and God asserted that Job was up-
right. These similarly worded rhetorical questions occurring ﬁve chapters
apart assist the reader in evaluating the positions that are emerging. According
to Eliphaz, no human being, precisely because of being human, can be just
before God. According to Job, God is just not being just! In this case, the
wrong answer would be right!
A third function of the interrogatives in chaps. 3–37 is to sustain reﬂection
on the events and issues introduced in the prologue. At key junctures in these
chapters, the use of interrogatives prevails on the reader to think back, to re-
member what happened and what is happening and why. The prominence
and pervasiveness of the interrogatives provides great assistance in reading the
book. It is virtually impossible not to answer (along with the characters) the
key questions as one reads. It is, in fact, the interrogatives that steer us from
time to time back to chaps. 1 and 2.

It has been demonstrated elsewhere that rhetorical questions have a ten-
dency to cluster as a means of achieving emphasis and underscoring a speaker’s
main point. I suggest that the distribution of interrogatives throughout the
speeches of Job and his friends, what I would call the interrogative matrix, is
anything but fortuitous. Interrogative clusters are present. With the full com-
plement of interrogatives used and the careful placement of them at the begin-
ning and end of speeches, sections and strophes, there is a broad pattern that
emerges. Within chaps. 3–37, interrogatives cluster, predominantly in bicola
occuring in alternating two, then three, and then four or more verse segments.
For example, Job’s lament in chap. 3 has no such cluster. Eliphaz’s ﬁrst speech
has one two-verse interrogative cluster. Job’s response has one three-verse in-
terrogative cluster framed by two two-verse clusters and then concludes with
a ﬁve-verse cluster. Bildad’s ﬁrst speech has two two-verse interrogative clus-
ters. Job’s response has one three-verse cluster at the beginning of chap. 10.
Zophar’s ﬁrst speech has two two-verse clusters. Job’s response has two three-
verse clusters.
This alternation of interrogative clusters continues through the second and
third cycles with a fairly even distribution. The four- and ﬁve-verse clusters
appear at only three junctures: (1) at the conlcusion of Job’s response to Eli-
phaz’s ﬁrst speech in 7:17–21; (2) at the beginning of Eliphaz’s third speech in
22:2–5; and (3) in the latter part of Job’s ﬁnal speech in 31:1–4. This pattern
dissipates almost entirely in the four speechs of Elihu. Elihu has one two-verse
interrogative cluster in 36:22–23 and one two-verse cluster in 37:15–16.
Given the fact that interrogatives are so pervasive, is there any place in the
book where interrogatives are conspicuously absent? There are 7 text seg-
ments between 20 and 29 verses long where no interrogatives appear at all. No
questions. No interrogatives:
The signiﬁcance and effect of these interrogative gaps remains part of my
ongoing work on the the rhetoric of interrogatives in the speeches of Job and
his friends.

What contribution might accrue from a careful consideration of interroga-
tives—as a set, as a matrix—within the book of Job? How might further
analysis of these “minor characters” present throughout the book contribute to
our understanding of the book? In his essay, “The Arguments of Job’s Three
Friends,” David Clines, decrying standard attempts to discriminate between
the friends on psychological grounds, says, “what one really wants to see—and
what one looks for in vain among the commentaries—is a set of notations of
the distinctiveness, logical or theological, in their various argumentations.”15
Speech is a window to the soul of a character. Because speech tells us a great
deal about a character, because the use of interrogatives is so much a part of the
way that Job’s friends speak, and because rhetorical questions tend to be a more
revealing mode of speech, could the disposition of the interrogatives in Job,
that is, the interrogative matrix, provide data regarding their character?
In this essay, I have identiﬁed the interrogative set that is found in the
speeches of Job and his friends, and I have described the function of the inter-
rogatives as a set in chaps. 3–37. We would certainly be remiss if we did not
thank all the “little people” for making the book of Job possible.

The Mysterious Disappearance of Zerubbabel
Theodore J. Lewis
The Johns Hopkins University
One of the greatest historical mysteries in the Hebrew Bible is the disap-
pearance of Zerubbabel. It is actually a mystery within a mystery. The ﬁrst has
to do with how and why the Signet of God disappeared. The second is equally
profound: Why does the retrospective text yield no details?
Zerubbabel is well known to biblical scholars specializing in the Persian pe-
riod yet of minor notice to today’s average worshiper, be he Jewish or Chris-
tian. So clean is his disappearance that remarkably few modern adherents of
Judaism and Christianity could articulate the major role he played in biblical
history. Few people realize that (according to the prophet Haggai) Zerubbabel
was God’s messianic designate.
Haggai and the Postexilic Diarchy
According to the prophet Ezekiel, too much power vested in the monarchy
brought about so many past ills that he could only envision the newly restored
community led by a diarchy with the Davidide (a depoliticized aycn rather
than a ˚lm)1 sharing power with the Zadokite priesthood.2 Even the land was
apportioned in such a way as to balance royal and priestly power (Ezek 45:1–
5, 7; 48:9–14, 21–22).
Such a diarchical administration (yet only in the early postexilic period) is
envisioned in the books of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah. In particular we read
of the shared rule of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua ( Joshua), the
son of Jozadak (Ezra 3:2, 8; 4:3; 5:2; Neh 12:1; Hag 1:1, 12, 14; 2:2, 4; Zech
3, 4; compare Sir 49:11). Yet immediately we are struck by the expression “in
1. Ezek 34:24, 37:25 (yet cf. 37:24); see J. D. Levenson, Theology of the Program of Resto-
ration of Ezekiel 40–48 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1976) 75–99.
2. Compare Jer 33:14–22 (especially vv. 17–18), which states that David will never lack
a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel nor will the Levitical priests (µyywlh µynhkh)
ever lack a man to serve in Yahweh’s presence. Contrast Ezek 44:15–27. Most scholars as-
sign this passage from Jeremiah to the postexilic period. See, for example, W. L. Holladay,
Jeremiah 2 (Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1989) 228–31.

the days of Zerubbabel” (Neh 12:47) that harks to a day when the royal half
of the diarchy held more prestige.
Though short, the book of Haggai refers to the diarchy ﬁve times, always
listing Zerubbabel’s name prior to that of Joshua. In what builds to a cre-
scendo, Haggai elevates Zerubbabel to messianic status.3 He employs cosmic
language in which Yahweh of Hosts, the divine warrior celebrated from of old,
will again act to shake the heavens, earth, sea, and dry land (Hag 2:6). With
apocalyptic fervor, all other nations will be shaken so that their treasures will
pour into Jerusalem. The nations’ gold and silver, Yahweh’s possession not
theirs, will be used to make Zerubbabel’s rebuilt temple more glorious than
Solomon’s (Hag 2:7–9).
The crescendo is depicted in an oracle (Hag 2:20–23) dating to December
18, 520 b.c.e. Zerubbabel, here addressed as ‘governor of Judah’ (hdwhy tjp),
is given the following divine promise:
I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,
I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms;
I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations,
I will overthrow the chariots and their riders;
horses and their riders shall fall,
every one by the sword of his comrade.
On that day, declares Yahweh of Hosts,
I will take you, O Zerubbabel,
son of Shealtiel, my servant,
declares Yahweh,
and I will make you like a signet ring (µtwj);4
3. It will become clear that I share this consensus view in contrast to the recent work of
W. Rose, Zemah and Zerubbabel: Messianic Expectations in the Early Postexilic Period (JSOTSup
304; Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 2000); idem, “Messianic Expectations in the Early
Postexilic Period,” in Yahwism after the Exile: Perspectives on Israelite Religion in the Persian Era
(ed. R. Albertz and B. Becking; Assen: Van Gorcum, 2003) 168–85.
4. Rose (“Messianic Expectations in the Early Postexilic Period,” 170–71) argues that
this designation is “most crucial” for determining Zerubbabel’s messianic status. For Rose,
the word µtwj designates not a signet ring (where the word t[bf is more appropriate) but
“the seal itself, which is usually located either in a case as a part of a ring or on a cord.”
Therefore, the expression of God’s making Zerubbabel “like a seal” implies only that
“Yhwh has a special relationship with him . . . Yhwh personally guarantees his safety: he
will protect him so that he will not suffer the same fate as other political leaders” (p. 173).
He concludes, asserting “the absence of anything explicitly royal in this oracle” (ibid.). In
the ﬁrst instance, it is clear that µtwj can indeed designate a signet ring and not just the seal
itself. As most scholars recognize, Haggai is here consciously referencing (and reversing) Jer
22:24. There Yahweh declares that if King Coniah (= Jehoiachin, Zerubbabel’s grandfather)

The Mysterious Disappearance of Zerubbabel
303
for I have chosen you,
declares Yahweh of hosts.
According to the Chronicler, Zerubbabel was of Davidic descent (1 Chr 3:17–
19), although, in contrast to the lineage listed above, the Chronicler lists him
as the son of Pedaiah, not Shealtiel. If Zerubbabel was indeed a Davidide,5
5. See B. E. Beyer (“Zerubbabel,” ABD 6:1085), who comments on the two basic posi-
tions: “Some have suggested Shealtiel died childless and Pedaiah his brother fathered Zerub-
babel, who then became the legal son of Shealtiel according to the principle of levirate
marriage (Deut 25:5–10). Others have proposed that the text of Chronicles contains an error
in transmission or refers to another individual by the same name.” A third option (the Chron-
icler is revising history) is voiced by J. M. Miller and J. H. Hayes, A History of Ancient Israel
and Judah (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1986) 456: “If Zerubbabel had been a member of the
Davidic family line, it seems almost unbelievable that neither Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, nor
Zechariah noted this. In all probability, therefore, Zerubbabel was a non-Davidic Jewish
leader whom the Chronicler has made into a member of the Judean royal family in order to
emphasize what he considered to be essential—the continuity of the leadership in preexilic
and postexilic times.” Accordingly, Miller and Hayes (p. 460) then suggest (based in part on
Zech 12:10) that Zerubbabel was killed by “a pro-Davidic faction.” A fourth option argued
here is that Zerubabbel was indeed a Davidide. Yet due to the embarrassment of his ill fate
(especially after such high messianic hopes were already penned), authors (or, more likely,
ancient editors) may have consciously chosen not to underscore his Davidic lineage.
were ‘a signet ring on his right hand’ (ynymy dy l[ µtwj), he would tear it off. Compare the
later tradition from Sir 49:11 that describes Zerubbabel (and Jeshua!) like ‘a signet ring on
the right hand’ (wJÍ sfragµÍ ejpµ dexiaÅÍ ceirovÍ). (For pictures of a signet ring with an at-
tached engraved seal, see J. Elayi, “Name of Deuteronomy’s Author Found on Seal Ring,”
BAR 13/5 [1987] 54–55.) Using a seal/signet ring conveys using the owner’s authority and
power. Compare 1 Kgs 21:8. Thus Zerubbabel, declares Haggai, is Yahweh’s instrument,
endowed with divine authority and power. As for Rose’s second assertion, much more is
going on in Hag 2:20–23 than just offering Zerubbabel personal protection. The context is
one of cosmic (divine warrior) language. Yahweh, marching forth as a Storm-god (see 2:6
with even a mention of µy), will shake the heavens and the earth on his way to overthrow
thrones and kingdoms. As a part of the process of bringing down kings, he will elevate
Zerubbabel to a chosen position wearing his seal. How could this wording (destroying
kingdoms and vesting a chosen leader bearing a divine insignia) be anything but royal? The
use of divine-warrior imagery to legitimate kingship has a long pedigree in ancient Near
Eastern royal ideology. One thinks of Adad, who let King Zimri-Lim use his divine weap-
ons, the very weapons that Adad used to defeat Tiamat. (For a convenient text and transla-
tion, now see M. Nissinen et al., Prophets and Prophecy in the Ancient Near East [Atlanta:
Society of Biblical Literature, 2003] 21–22, with additional bibliography.) According to
S. Japhet (“Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel,” ZAW 94 [1982] 77–78), “this is a vivid and
graphic description of the removal of political regimes and the putting to an end of the mili-
tary might upon which they are built . . . Haggai sees Zerubbabel as a king, whose kingdom
is made possible by a change in the political structure.”

Theodore J. Lewis
304
Haggai’s use of the appellation “my servant” (Hag 2:23), a favorite designation
used elsewhere for the house of David (e.g., Ezek 34:23–24, 37:24), would be
telling.
Zechariah and the Postexilic Diarchy
Like Haggai, the book of Zechariah starts out envisioning a diarchy with
shared leadership between Zerubbabel and Joshua, who is designated ‘the
great priest’ (lwdgh ˆhkh) in 3:1, 8.6 The clearest expression is found in Zecha-
riah 4, where the diarchy is depicted through the mention of two olive trees
(µytyzh ynv, 4:3, 11) with two branches (µytyzh ylbv ytv, 4:12). These, accord-
ing to 4:14, are the “two anointed [rulers] (rhxyh ynb ynv) who stand by the
Lord of the whole earth.” Of the two leaders, special emphasis is placed on
Zerubbabel in Zechariah 4. It is Zerubbabel (not Joshua) who is singled out
for laying the foundation of the temple (4:9). It is Zerubbabel’s hands that will
bring it to completion (4:9). He is the one who holds the plumb line that will
occasion rejoicing among the people (4:10). It is Zerubbabel about whom the
divine oracle announces:
Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit says Yahweh of Hosts. Whoever
you are, O great mountain, before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain; for he
shall bring forward the top stone, amid shouts of “Grace, grace” to it! (Zech 4:6)
Here the book of Zechariah is similar to the book of Haggai in embracing a
diarchy with more emphasis placed on the Davidide.
As for Joshua, a lengthy section is devoted to him in 3:1–5, yet its emphasis
is on his cleansing. This “brand plucked from the ﬁre” (3:2) (hardly an effer-
vescent designation) is cleansed from sin and guilt (ˆw[). His ﬁlthy garments are
replaced by rich apparel. A conditional clause follows in 3:7, where he is ex-
horted that only if he is righteous will he then have charge over God’s temple
and courts.
What follows next is crucial. Joshua and his (priestly) colleagues are told
that God is about to bring “his servant,” the jmx (often translated ‘branch’ but
more properly meaning ‘sprout’ or ‘shoot’). Once again we have two terms
for the Davidide.7 In addition to the servant (ydb[) language (see above), the
6. On this phrase, see C. L. Meyers and E. M. Meyers, Haggai, Zechariah 1–8 (AB 25B;
New York: Doubleday, 1987) 180–81; and T. Pola, “Form and Meaning in Zechariah 3,”
in Yahwism after the Exile: Perspectives on Israelite Religion in the Persian Era (ed. R. Albertz and
B. Becking; Assen: Van Gorcum, 2003) 163.
7. It is curious to read the rationale underlying Pola’s conclusion that jmx ydb[ in Zech
3:8 “has nothing to do with Zerubbabel” (“Form and Meaning in Zechariah 3,” 165). He
bases this on the fact that Moses is called God’s servant in Num 12:7–8. Yet Moses is never
called a “shoot” or “branch.” The royal (Davidic) association with the jmx language is clear.

imagery of the word jmx is certainly royal and ﬁlled with messianic overtones.
For example, consider the following passages from Psalm 132 as well as from
the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah.
There (Zion) I will make a horn sprout (jymxa) for David;
I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one. (Ps 132:17)
In that day the Branch of the Yahweh (hwhy jmx)8 shall be beautiful and glori-
ous. (Isa 4:2)
There shall come forth a shoot (rfj) from the stump ([zg) of Jesse,
A branch (rxn) shall grow out of his roots (wyvrv). (Isa 11:1; cf. 53:2)
Days are coming, says Yahweh, when I will raise up for David a righteous
Branch (qydx jmx) and he shall reign as king and deal wisely. He shall execute
justice and righteousness in the land. ( Jer 23:5)
In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch (hqdx jmx) to
spring forth for David. He shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
( Jer 33:15).
The Mysterious Disappearance of Zerubbabel
Zerubbabel disappears mysteriously from the pages of history. His fate is
never articulated in any ancient text (biblical or extrabiblical).9 If he was a mi-
nor ﬁgure, his absence could go unnoticed. However, his stature (at least for
the authors of Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra, and Nehemiah) was too prominent to
let this mystery go unexplored. Three options are viable. One speculates:
1. Did Zerubbabel die a natural death? Our texts are silent.
2. Was he removed from ofﬁce (and/or killed) by the Persians, who felt the
need to stem a growing nationalism? Our texts are silent.
3. Was he removed from ofﬁce (and/or killed) by a priestly party (the
Zadokites?) in some type of struggle for power? Our texts are silent.
Ultimately, this is a mystery we cannot solve. Arguments from silence by def-
inition are speculative. Yet perhaps the silence of one theory may be louder

The Second Mystery: Why the Silence?
The ﬁrst mystery is perplexing enough. What happened to the historical
Zerubbabel? How did he disappear or die? Yet the second mystery is more
profound: why do our texts not tell us what happened to him? 
Option 1
If Zerubbabel simply died, then why did not the author of the book of Ze-
chariah simply say so? Royal ﬁgures commonly fall ill, are wounded in battle,
and die. Even illustrious Davidides are not spared tragedy or misfortune, and
such events are amply recorded. Consider the two Davidides about whom we
read the “incomparability statements” that there never was a king like them
(2 Kgs 18:5, 23:25),10 yet this enthusiasm did not keep scribes from recording
negative events.
Despite the overall positive assessment that our deuteronomistic editors
have left us regarding Hezekiah, we read that his Judah was besieged, resulting
in the humiliation of the king’s handing over heavy tribute, including the gold
stripped from the temple (2 Kgs 18:13–16). We read that Hezekiah was
mocked and ridiculed by the Assyrians (2 Kgs 18:19–35, 2 Chr 32:9–19) and
fellow tribes (2 Chr 30:10). At another time he falls gravely sick (2 Kgs 20:1–
7, 2 Chr 32:24) and is even sanctioned for his pride (2 Chr 32:25). Hezekiah’s
death is recorded in 2 Kgs 20:21 and 2 Chr 32:33.
Certainly the abrupt killing of Josiah, at the height of his reform, must have
come as an unexpected shock to his followers, especially the pro-Josianic edi-
tor Dtr1 (2 Kgs 23:29). Yet our ancient authors/editors did not shrink from
relating the bitter death of the Davidide par excellence by Necho II at
Megiddo.
In each of these cases, ancient scribes recorded the event. While writers and
redactors presented the details in carefully crafted forms (and according to spe-
ciﬁc ideological criteria), no attempt at covering up the basic reality of royal
misfortune and death can be detected. If Zerubbabel fell ill or was fatally
wounded in battle, would it not have been likely to have the event recorded?
If Zerubbabel were a nobody, then one could forgive his passing without no-
tice.11 The absence of any mention of what happened to such a prominent
10. See G. N. Knoppers, “‘There Was None like Him’: Incomparability in the Book of
Kings,” CBQ 54 (1992) 411–31.
11. I am speaking, of course, of Zerubbabel’s status among those (such as Haggai and
Zechariah) who held him in the highest regard. It matters not that others (such as Olmstead)
are of the opinion that Zerubbabel “was only a governor of third rank.” See A. T. Olmstead,
History of the Persian Empire (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1948) 139. On Zerub-
babel’s position of hjp and its relation to the Assyrian ofﬁce of bel pihati, see K. G. Hoglund,

person, while it could be innocent, lends itself to suspicion. Zech 12:10, yet
another bewildering text due to its lack of speciﬁcity, speaks of a prominent
person who was killed. If this later remorse refers to Zerubbabel, then it would
rule out the option that he died a natural death.
Option 2
It is certainly possible that the Persians removed Zerubbabel from ofﬁce ei-
ther by deporting him or murdering him. If Hag 2:7, 22–23 is any indication,
there was a growing tide of nationalism that certainly could have piqued more
than just mild interest within the Persian administration. R. Albertz suggests
that Zerubbabel’s sudden disappearance from the scene was “probably the re-
sult of Persian intervention.”12 Because Zerubbabel was “the main focus of
national hopes, [he] was removed from the political stage.”13 As a result, “the
high-ﬂying nationalistic hopes had collapsed at a stroke.”14
Some commentators go so far as to accuse Zerubbabel of rebellion. Olm-
stead, for example, speaks of “zealots” who “were grooming Zerubbabel for
independent rule.” Accordingly, writes Olmstead (relying on Tattenai’s accu-
sations in Ezra 5:11–16), “hints of the projected revolt came to royal atten-
tion.”15 Thus Zerubbabel, even if it was not of his own making, “might
justiﬁably be accused of high treason against his royal benefactor.”16 W. F. Al-
bright asserted this view as if there were a consensus among scholars: “As is
well known, he [Zerubbabel] planned rebellion against Darius, and probably
was punished with death.”17

minster John Knox, 1994) 2:454.

15. Other scholars, such as John Bright, suggest that certain nobles of Samaria whom
Zerubbabel had previously rebuffed (Ezra 4:1–5) were responsible for bringing (misrepre-
senting?) such (seditious?) talk to the attention of the Persian authorities. See John Bright,
A History of Israel (3rd ed.; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1981) 371.
16. All three quotations come from A. T. Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire (Chi-
cago: University of Chicago Press, 1948) 138–39 and are representative of many other
scholars. A more recent example would be E. Stern (Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, Vol-
ume 2: The Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian Periods [New York: Doubleday, 2001] 355), who
suggests that “perhaps because Darius suspected that Zerubbabel was plotting an uprising,
the governor—last heir of the Davidic line—disappeared suddenly, only a short time after
construction work began.”

A realist would recoil at the thought of such rebellious actions. As E. Mey-
ers has wisely noted: 
such [monarchist] hopes were not grounded in any sense of realism, because the
population of Yehud at this time was insigniﬁcant and would have made even the
staunchest monarchist hesitate to advocate independence, let alone rebellion . . .
it is highly unlikely that some sort of political rebellion took place under his [Zerub-
babel’s] leadership. The new colony of Yehud was tiny and not yet on its feet eco-
nomically and would have stood no chance of challenging the might of Persia.18
And yet, when did zealots ever concern themselves with realistic assessments
of their chances at success?
All these scenarios are speculative. We have no indication of hostile feelings
on the part of the Persians toward Zerubbabel or vice versa. Every indication is
that the opposite was the case (compare Ezra 5:1–17, 6:1–15).19 As H. G. M.
Williamson writes, “Darius conﬁrmed Zerubbabel in his role as governor and
temple builder despite the inquiry of Tattenai and his associates (Ezr. 6:6–12).
Darius would not have granted this permission had there been any suspicion of
seditious activity.”20
If, for the sake of argument, one assumes that the Persians were in some
way responsible for Zerubbabel’s disappearance, then why do we have no
mention of their culpability? Could it be that they were responsible, and yet
authors like Haggai or Zechariah feared repercussions if they mentioned the
fact or voiced objections? Such a scenario is a possible, yet not the most plau-
sible, suggestion.
Option 3
The third option is the most attractive if we, to borrow a detective phrase,
“follow the money.” In other words: Who most beneﬁted from Zerubbabel’s
disappearance? Or, more appropriately, who thought they would beneﬁt from
Zerubbabel’s disappearance?21

Prophecy,” in “Go to the Land I Will Show You”: Studies in Honor of Dwight W. Young (ed.

19. Note also his title ‘governor of Judah’ (hdwhy tjp) which, according to Beyer,
(“Zerubbabel,” 1085) “demonstrates the signiﬁcance of Zerubbabel’s role in the eyes of
both the Persians and the biblical writers.”
20. H. G. M. Williamson, “Zerubbabel,” ISBE 4:1194. Note also later apocryphal tra-
ditions, such as 1 Esd 3:1–5:6, that celebrate how impressed Darius was with Zerubbabel’s
wisdom and therefore authorized and supported his work in Jerusalem. See Josephus, An-
tiquities 11.
21. Who historically held the most power in the post-Zerubbabel administration of Ye-
hud is a different question. Scholars debate three viable options: (a) the priesthood together

The Mysterious Disappearance of Zerubbabel
309
From the books of Haggai and Zechariah it is clear that power (and all the
economic and social advantages that power implies) was to be shared between
Zerubbabel and the (Zadokite) priesthood with Joshua at its head. Of the two
ofﬁces (from the evidence we have presented above), one would have to agree
that at the outset the Davidic house was accorded the more power of the two.22
In contrast, at the end of Zech 6:9–14 it is the priesthood ( Joshua in particular)
that ends up with not just 75 percent of the power but all of the power, both
royal and priestly. A hierocracy rather than a diarchy is envisioned.23
Zechariah 6:9–14
Zerubbabel disappears in this pivotal passage, yet his absence is not without
a trace. There are multiple clues left behind.

Translations have been less than accurate. Note the nrsv’s rendering, which is
similar to many other translations:
The word of the Lord came to me: Collect silver and gold from the exiles—
from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah—who have arrived from Babylon; and go the
same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. Take the silver and gold and
make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest Joshua son of Jehoza-
dak; say to him: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Here is a man whose name is
Branch: for he shall branch out in his place, and he shall build the temple of the
Lord. It is he that shall build the temple of the Lord; he shall bear royal honor,
and shall sit and rule on his throne. There shall be a priest by his throne, with
peaceful understanding between the two of them. And the crown shall be in

the care of Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah, as a
memorial in the temple of the Lord. (emphasis mine)
There are several clues that indicate that the text as we have it has been ad-
justed to ﬁt a different reality from the one addressed by the original.
The most immediate clue (if one is reading the text in Hebrew) is the non-
sensical notion in 6:11 of Joshua wearing (two) crowns (twrf[). While apol-
ogetic answers are readily at hand (e.g., the double crown of ancient Egypt
worn by a single pharaoh uniting both lands), the solution is more likely to be
found through textual criticism.
It is irresponsible of modern translations (such as the one above) not to give
readers access to the primary information. Instead of translating the Hebrew
(which reads the plural ‘crowns’), an overwhelming number of commentators
and translators render a singular noun (‘a crown’ trf[), following the Greek
and Syriac (for example, nrsv notes). (The word “it” is also supplied in 6:11
by translators, where no direct object appears in the Hebrew text.) Why any
textual critic would prefer a clearly secondary reading (violating the basic rule
of lectio difﬁcilior) is perplexing. Surely the Greek and Syriac translators were
faced with the difﬁculty of Joshua’s wearing (two) crowns and read the singu-
lar to smooth out the problem.24 The word twrf[ must be the original read-
ing, for it can account for the secondary production of trf[. The reverse
cannot be convincingly argued. (If original, why would a scribe change trf[,
a reading that makes good sense, into the difﬁcult twrf[?) Thus, the original
text referred to (two) crowns, seemingly one for each member of the diarchy,
Zerubbabel and Joshua.25
The second clue is as apparent as the ﬁrst. Zech 6:13 notes that there will
be ‘harmonious understanding between the two of them’ (ˆyb hyht µwlv tx[w
µhynv). This comment only makes sense if both Zerubbabel and Joshua were
once present in the text.
The third clue is to be found in 6:12, where the “Branch” language at ﬁrst
glance looks like it refers to Joshua, the immediate antecedent. Clearly, the
hnh clause, as the predicator of existence,26 has God saying to Joshua, “here is
24. The singular verb hyht in 6:14 would be a secondary reading as well, occasioned by
the texts that read the singular trf[. The MT’s mixture of the plural twrf[ and the singu-
lar hyht represents a mixed tradition of original and variant readings.
25. See Meyers and Meyers (Haggai, Zechariah 1–8, 350), who argue that the reference
to silver and gold also refers to two crowns, with Joshua wearing the more inferior silver
crown and the Davidide the gold, “fully proper monarchic crown.”

senbrauns, 1990) 675 (§40.2.1).

the Branch,” namely, a person other than Joshua. This, together with the use
of “branch” language elsewhere to denote the Davidides, again reveals (as did
3:8) that originally Zerubbabel, the Branch, was in this passage with the diar-
chy ﬁrmly envisioned. Zerubbabel was originally the ﬁgure in 6:13 bearing
dwh ‘royal honor’ or ‘majesty’, sitting on a throne (ask), and ruling (lvm), all
words that would not be ﬁtting in regard to a priest. One might mistakenly
associate the building of the temple mentioned in 6:13 as a priestly duty (and
hence think of Joshua), were it not that the author just underscored Zerubba-
bel’s major role in laying the foundation of the temple and bringing it to com-
pletion (4:9).
If a fourth clue were needed, it is available in the latter half of 6:13. At ﬁrst
glance, the text is again problematic, for it seems to state that there will be a
priest (i.e., Joshua) seated on (Zerubbabel’s) throne, which makes little sense
when the Davidide is already sitting there. It makes more sense if the author
intended l[ as a contingent locational preposition (‘beside, by, next to’) rather
than as a simple locational preposition (‘upon, on’). In other words, he was re-
ferring to ( Joshua) the priest as sitting next to the royal throne. 27 Indeed, this
is the understanding of the Greek translator, who rendered: ‘and there will be
a priest at his [i.e., Zerubbabel’s] right hand’. Only if Zerubbabel were removed
from the text would it take on the meaning of a priest sitting on the throne.
It seems apparent that the original text of Zech 6:9–14 was congruent with
passages (such as Zech 3:8–9, 4:6–14) that underscored the diarchy with Ze-
rubbabel as the primary party. What originally stood here was a text in which
both Zerubbabel and Joshua were crowned.
A reconstructed text could be translated as follows:
The word of the Lord came to me: Collect silver and gold from the exiles—
from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah—who have arrived from Babylon; and go the
same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. Take the silver and gold and
make (two) crowns and set (one) on the head of the high priest Joshua son of
Jehozadak; say to him: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Here is <Zerubbabel. Set
(the other crown) on the head of> a man whose name is Branch: for he shall
branch out in his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord. It is he that
shall build the temple of the Lord; he shall bear royal honor, and shall sit upon
his throne and rule. There shall be a priest ( Joshua) by his throne, with peace-
ful understanding between the two of them. And the (two) crowns shall be in
27. So too the nrsv. See Waltke and O’Connor, ibid., 216 (§11.2.13). Alternatively, as
suggested to me personally by R. Westbrook, with an original diarchy in place, one could
retain the translation “There shall be a priest Joshua on his throne.” The reasoning would
be that if there were originally two crowns (one for Zerubbabel and one for Joshua) then
perhaps originally there were two thrones as well.

the care of Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah, as a
memorial in the temple of the Lord. (emphasis mine)
Though I have noted the changes in translation in bold, please note that only
the words marked by < > brackets in 6:12 would require a different Hebrew
text. It would read:
.hwhy lkyhAta hnbw jmxy wytjtmw wmv jmx vya <carøB} T:m}c"w] lb<B:ruz]> hnh
This change could have resulted from haplography, with the similar endings
var and vya occasioning the error. More likely, the change was a conscious
decision resulting from historical reality.
Perhaps another hint is to be found in Zech 3:8–9:
Now listen, O Joshua, the high priest, you and your colleagues who sit before
you! For they are an omen of things to come: For I am about to bring my ser-
vant, the Branch. For on the stone (ˆbah) that I have set before Joshua, on a
single stone (tja ˆba) with seven facets, I am about to engrave its inscription
(hjtp jtpm ynnh), says Yahweh of Hosts.
The symbolism of the stone placed before Joshua has been debated, with
scholars settling on two options. Either the stone refers to a monolith associ-
ated with rebuilding the temple (perhaps a type of cornerstone), or it refers to
a gemstone associated with either priestly vestments or a royal diadem. If the
stone represents Zerubbabel,28 it signaled more power and inﬂuence being
held in royal hands. If the stone (ˆbah) is associated with the rebuilding of the
temple (cf. hvarh ˆbah ‘the top stone’ in 4:7), then once again we have a pas-
sage coinciding with Zech 4:9–10 that emphasizes Zerubbabel’s prominence
in the temple reconstruction.
Alternatively, if the stone is a gemstone, it too could have raised the ire of
Joshua and his priesthood. The most obvious reference would be to the en-
graved stones associated with the priestly vestments in Exodus 28. In particu-
lar, Exod 28:36 (compare with 28:11) refers to a priestly golden plate being
like ‘engraved signets’ (µtj yjwtp).
In light of the fact that Haggai called Zerubbabel God’s Signet Ring (µtwj
2:23), Zech 3:9 could imply that Zerubbabel is ‘the single stone’ (tja ˆba; cf.
tjah ˆbah in Exod 28:10) with its ‘engraving’ (hjtp) (compare the engraved
µtwj in Exodus 28). In other words, once again we could have a reference to
28. If the stone does not equal Zerubbabel, the phrase jmx ydb[Ata aybm ynnhAyk seems
randomly placed here.

Zerubbabel’s accumulating power (even priestly power) in a way that threat-
ened Joshua and his priestly colleagues.29
Conclusion: A Cover-Up?
The disappearance of Zerubbabel must remain a mystery. Although we can
conjecture, ultimately, we do not know his fate.30 Of the speculations offered
above, option 3 in my opinion remains the most likely.
As the above comments indicate, if we prefer option 3, we are implying
a murderous plot by a power-hungry priesthood, followed by a cover-up.
Whether this scenario is at all attractive will be conditioned by how one views
Joshua’s priesthood (positively or negatively) and the nature of the postexilic
leadership. There are several passages that scholars have described as indictments
29. Compare Meyers and Meyers’ (Haggai, Zechariah 1–8, 421–422) comments about
how, prior to the founding of the temple, “every one was set against the other” (Zech 8:10).
30. There are other factors to consider, yet it is questionable how much light they
would shed on the mystery. For example, of what relevance is the continuation of Zerub-
babel’s family? According to 1 Chr 3:19–20, Zerubbabel had two sons (Meshullam and Ha-
naniah) and one daughter (Shelomith), their sister, as well as ﬁve additional sons (Hashubah,
Ohel, Berechiah, Hasadiah, Jushab-hesed). Contrast Albright’s (“The Date and Personality
of the Chronicler,” 108) unfounded assertion that “it is furthermore all but certain than [sic]
the young Zerubbabel of Judah perished without children.” What would (did?) Zerubba-
bel’s children say about the cover-up if there was one? We know nothing of them or their
service in the administration of Yehud from the biblical text. Yet in 1976, N. Avigad (Bullae
and Seals from a Post-exilic Judean Archive [Qedem 4; Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1976]
11–13) published a seal that read “belonging to Shelomit, the ªamah of Elnatan, the gover-
nor.” The bulla of Elnatan is also attested in the same corpus. Avigad and many other schol-
ars have equated this Shelomit with the one that 1 Chr 3:19 describes as the daughter of
Zerubbabel. Some scholars see ªamah as designating just a woman of high standing, while
others prefer to see an additional marital connotation. Eric Meyers (“The Shelomith Seal
and the Judean Restoration: Some Additional Considerations,” ErIsr 18 [Avigad volume;
1985] 33*–38*), who builds on Avigad’s work, argues that Elnatan, the secular leader who
followed Zerubbabel as governor, married Zerubbabel’s daughter, who could provide him
with “a visible sign of the continuity of the Davidic family in the eyes of the public.” He
married her “to solidify his control over an ofﬁce that was diminishing in ﬁscal power and
which was being eclipsed by an ever-strengthening high priesthood.” Such a scenario, while
admittedly speculative, would ﬁt well with our theory that the priesthood removed Zerub-
babel from ofﬁce. Other questions: Is it relevant that, despite his elevation in Zechariah 6,
Joshua does not appear in any of the Chronicler’s genealogies? Is it noteworthy that, though
Zerubbabel is praised for his association with building the temple (e.g., Zech 4:9), he is not
speciﬁcally mentioned (however, neither is Joshua) in the summary in Ezra 6:14–15?

of the postexilic religious establishment,31 yet the majority of these texts are
anonymous and their dating is debated. Certainty again escapes us, as the
enigma remains.
Addendum: The Nature of the Text
While solving the mystery of Zerubbabel is impossible, perhaps we can gain
a little more than just the pleasure of speculation. A closer examination of Zech
6:9–14 may be able to inform our understanding of the nature of transmission
history. In the case of this passage, it seems that by the time the text was “doc-
tored” it had already achieved a type of “sacral” status. In other words, the
original text (that crowned both Zerubbabel and Joshua) was already (at a rela-
tively early stage) “ﬁxed”—but only to a degree.
It was “ﬁxed” in the sense that the written oracle was known (and grouped
together into a collection?) and could not simply be discarded when no longer
apt. For that matter, the same could be said about the second chapter of the
book of Haggai and the earlier portions of the book of Zechariah that cele-
brated Zerubbabel’s future. After Zerubbabel suffered his ill fate, these texts
could not simply be discarded. Even though discarding them would have kept
these celebratory texts from turning into embarrassing reminders, such writ-
ings were kept. They had “sacral” status.
However, the text was not as “ﬁxed” when it came to adjustment, or what
M. Fishbane32 refers to as “reinterpretations.” Just as the book of Ezekiel
could be updated to reﬂect Nebuchadnezzar’s “revised” wages for his failed
campaign against Tyre (compare Ezek 26:7–14 with 29:17–20), so too Ze-
chariah 6 could be updated to reﬂect the new historical reality in which
Zerubbabel was no longer on the scene. E. Meyers describes the way that our
texts have been “purposely adjusted to suit larger theological aims and pur-
poses.” He is referring to what he calls the “muted messianism of First Zecha-
riah” as well as the similar “quiescent, though triumphal, tone of the messianic
oracle” of Zech 9:9–10.33

Textual Criticism of the Book of Deuteronomy and 
the Oxford Hebrew Bible Project
Sidnie White Crawford
University of Nebraska–Lincoln
The Oxford Hebrew Bible is a scholarly project that aims to produce a criti-
cal, eclectic edition of every book of the Hebrew Bible.1 This has not, to my
knowledge, been attempted before; the critical editions available of the He-
brew Bible (e.g., Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia) are diplomatic editions. That is,
they rely on a single manuscript as their base text and only present variants
from that base text in a critical apparatus. An eclectic text, on the other hand,
attempts to reconstruct the best text possible from all known witnesses, along
with a critical apparatus.2 The parallel project to the Oxford Hebrew Bible in the
ﬁeld of Septuagint studies is the Göttingen Septuagint, which is producing a
critical, eclectic edition for every book of the Greek Bible.
The impetus for the Oxford Hebrew Bible project was the publication of all
the (so-called) biblical manuscripts from the Judean Desert ﬁnds,3 which made
available to the scholarly community the only large group of pre-70 c.e. biblical
manuscripts. Thus an eclectic edition, as opposed to a diplomatic edition tied
to a single manuscript, has become possible. Some may wish to argue that, even
with the new texts from the Judean Desert ﬁnds, not enough manuscript evi-
dence exists to produce a reliable eclectic edition. I will attempt to demonstrate
in this article that, at least with regard to Deuteronomy, this is not the case.

years, especially the book of Esther; most recently I have had the privilege of collaborating
with him in the Oxford Hebrew Bible project, the subject of this essay.

When approaching the task of preparing a critical edition of the book of
Deuteronomy, which I have been asked to do for the Oxford Hebrew Bible
project, one must ﬁrst question what evidence is available in the form of an-
cient witnesses to the text and immediately follow up with the corollary ques-
tion of how to deploy that evidence (the question of method). In this essay I
will concentrate on displaying the evidence available, while also touching on
the question of deployment.
The discoveries in the Judean Desert have given us a wealth of manuscripts
of Deuteronomy, all dating to before the second century c.e. The oldest of
these manuscripts is 4QpaleoDeuts, which dates to the second half of the third
century b.c.e.4 The total number of Hebrew Deuteronomy manuscripts from
Qumran is 30 or 31, a number that includes the 4 excerpted texts identiﬁed
by Julie Duncan and me.5 There is also one Greek Deuteronomy manuscript
from Qumran. In addition, there was one Deuteronomy manuscript recov-
ered from Wadi Murabbaºat, one from Na˙al Óever/Wadi Seiyal, and one
from Massada. This gives a total of 34 or 35 manuscripts of Deuteronomy
from the Judean Desert caves, certainly an impressive number and one sur-
passed only by the number of Psalms manuscripts. This is the good news for
the textual critic.
The bad news, of course, is that all of these manuscripts are extremely frag-
mentary. The fragments remaining from these manuscripts contain an average
of 2, 3, or 4 verses of text; some contain as little as a part of a single verse.
Large sections of running text are quite rare. The largest preserved segment is
found in 4QDeutn, which contains Deut 5:1 through 6:1, for a total of 34
verses.6 However, 4QDeutn is an excerpted text, and its text of the Decalogue
has been expanded with material imported from the parallel text in Exodus.
Therefore, it must be used very carefully for text-critical purposes. More
typical is 4QDeuta, which preserves a large fragment of text, from 23:26
through 24:8, for a total of 9 verses.7 Long segments like these, however, are
relatively rare.

Let us pause to analyze this information. The fullest coverage is provided by
4QDeutc, which contains 120 verses from 19 chapters.10 There is no pattern
of preservation among the various scrolls; some preserve fragments from
widely scattered portions of Deuteronomy (e.g., 1QDeutb preserves segments
of chapters 1, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30 and 31), while others
preserve fragments from a particular section of the book (e.g., 4QDeuti con-
tains verses from chaps. 20–24). The manuscripts that have been identiﬁed as
excerpted manuscripts (4QDeutj, 4QDeutk1, 4QDeutn, and 4QDeutq)11
contain portions of speciﬁc chapters (viz., 5, 6, 8, 11, and 32) that were of par-
ticular interest for study and meditation (they also consistently occur in the
phylacteries and mezuzot from Qumran, as I shall discuss).

Because of the fragmentary nature of these manuscripts, it is difﬁcult, if not
impossible in most cases, to assign a textual afﬁliation to these manuscripts.
Even for the 3 most extensively preserved manuscripts, 4QDeutc, 4QDeutf,
and 4QpaleoDeutr, the editors are rightly cautious. For 4QDeutc, I stated, “it
can be said with assurance that 4QDeutc is not a manuscript of the Samaritan
tradition,”12 while for 4QDeutf I remarked that “4QDeutf cannot be placed
within any textual tradition.”13 The editors of 4QpaleoDeutr, Sanderson and
Ulrich, declare that “4QpaleoDeutr appears to have agreed with MG [the
Masoretic Text and the Septuagint] in lacking the typological features of the
Samaritan Deuteronomy. In minor variants the manuscript most often pre-
sents a unique reading, less often agrees with [Sam], and least often agrees with
M.”14 There are only a few of the smaller manuscripts that one can argue, on
the basis of the available evidence, are afﬁliated with one of the three major
witnesses to Deuteronomy. I have argued that 4QDeutg is afﬁliated with the
proto-Masoretic text;15 Duncan has suggested that 4QDeutb and 4QDeutq
are afﬁliated with the Septuagint text;16 and Sanderson and Ulrich have stated
that 4QLXXDeut is the Septuagintal Deuteronomy text.17 What this means
for textual criticism is that all the variants presented by these manuscripts must
be carefully weighed, because it will be difﬁcult to reconstruct stemmata in
which to locate all the variants. However, these manuscripts do preserve vari-
ants that can lead to a reconstruction of the critical text.
The parade example of this is 4QDeutj, which Duncan has identiﬁed as an
excerpted text of Deuteronomy.18 Column XII of 4QDeutj preserves Deut
32:7–8, and in line 14 contains the reading µyhla ynb. This reading agrees with
the Septuagint (G), and disagrees with the Masoretic Text (M), the Samaritan
Pentateuch, and the daughter versions of M, which read larçy ynb. As early as
1971, Skehan argued that the Septuagint text reﬂected the original text of
32:8, and the M and Sam. reading was a “deliberate and tendentious modiﬁ-
cation.”19 4QDeutj now supplies the original Hebrew from which the Greek
was translated, and µyhla ynb is bolstered as the preferred reading.

There is another set of manuscripts found in the Judean Desert that pre-
serve portions of Deuteronomy but are not complete and/or separate manu-
scripts of Deuteronomy, which the text-critic must decide whether and how
to utilize. First are 3 manuscripts from the group designated 4QReworked
Pentateuch, 4Q364, 4Q365, and 4Q366.20 These manuscripts were desig-
nated “reworked” by their editors because they display evidence of scribal in-
tervention of a relatively extensive nature to their base text. In the case of
4Q364 and 365, that base text is the pre- or proto-Samaritan text (see below,
pp. 323–24), demonstrated by the fact that we ﬁnd the types of harmonizations
or content-editing characteristic of that text group.21 The Reworked Penta-
teuch texts move further along the spectrum of scribal intervention by insert-
ing new elements into the base text.22 Some scholars have maintained that
these manuscripts, especially 4Q364 and 4Q365, are simply biblical manu-
scripts and should be counted as such.23 Others have argued that these manu-
scripts go so far in their reworking that they have fallen out of the category
“biblical.”24 I myself have argued elsewhere that these manuscripts, which dis-
play every evidence of scribal intervention and exegesis, occupy a gray area be-
tween the biblical and Rewritten Bible categories.25 Whatever the ﬁnal word
is on these manuscripts, they do preserve some and even (in the case of 4Q364)
relatively extensive portions of Deuteronomy.26 I believe these manuscripts can
be used for text-critical purposes with due caution, bearing in mind the possi-
bility of scribal intervention in a previously existing text of Deuteronomy.
A more difﬁcult case is the Temple Scroll, which also preserves large portions
of the text of Deuteronomy in cols. 51–66, following the essential order of
Deuteronomy 12–26.27 However, the portions of Deuteronomy found in the

Temple Scroll have been extensively redacted by the redactor/composer of the
Temple Scroll or his source, thus giving rise to the title “Deuteronomic Para-
phrase.”28 For example, in keeping with the practice of the rest of the Temple
Scroll, third-person divine speech is changed to the ﬁrst person, although not
consistently. Further, the Temple Scroll rearranges the biblical pericopes by
topic, sometimes with nonbiblical additions.
A good example of the redactor’s method comes from the beginning of the
Deuteronomic Paraphrase, col. 51:11–18. In accordance with the scroll’s prac-
tice, God is speaking in the ﬁrst person.

onomy directly but a source in which sections of Deuteronomy had already been selected
and redacted. Michael Wise, A Critical Study of the Temple Scroll from Qumran Cave 11

The segment begins with Deut 16:18, although the redactor omits the phrase
˚yfbçl ˚l ˆtn ˚yhla hwhy. It continues with 16:19 but weaves in part of Deut
1:17, converts the second-person verbs to third person, changes the order of
the clauses, and adds the phrase fpçm hfm djwçh yk ‘for the bribe perverts jus-
tice’ to emphasize the point of the verse. Before the quotation from Deuter-
onomy continues in line 15 with qdx qdx (16:20), the redactor adds several
phrases punctuating the consequences of perverting justice, the climax of
which is deﬁlement of the temple (tybh). Deut 16:20 is quoted nearly verba-
tim, although the text is expanded beyond the MT text, and the device of
ﬁrst-person divine speech is maintained (line 16). Lines 17–18 draw on both
Deut 1:17 and 18:22 (“you shall not be afraid”); like the false prophet in
18:20, the unjust judge is to die, because his actions have polluted the land.30
Thus the point of this whole introductory section is the importance of qdx
‘righteousness’ in the land that is God’s gift. This example, which shows the
strong hand of the redactor/composer at work, should sufﬁce to demonstrate
that the Deuteronomy portions of the Temple Scroll can only be used for text-
critical purposes with extreme caution; they may only be helpful in supporting
a reading from another witness.
The ﬁnal group of texts from the Judean Desert that preserves portions of
Deuteronomy is the phylacteries and the mezuzot.31 Twenty-ﬁve phylacteries
and 8 mezuzot were recovered from the caves at Qumran, and 3 phylacteries
and one mezuzah were found in the other Judean Desert sites. These docu-
ments preserve only a limited repertoire of Deuteronomy passages: sections of
5:1–6:9 (the Decalogue and the Shemaº ), 10:12–11:21, and 32 (the same
chapters preserved by the excerpted texts, which in some cases also preserve
chap. 8). Some of these phylacteries and mezuzot also preserve passages from
Exod 12:43–13:16. These texts exhibit signs that they have not been carefully
copied, and the passages they contain are often expanded; therefore they, too,
can only be used with extreme caution, mainly as support for the reading of a
more reliable witness.
The above list comprises almost all the evidence for the text criticism of
Deuteronomy available from the texts of the Judean Desert (barring quota-
tions; for example, Deuteronomy is cited eight times in the Damascus Docu-

ment 32) but does not exhaust all the available evidence for Deuteronomy. We
have not yet even discussed the three major witnesses to Deuteronomy: the
Masoretic Text, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Septuagint.
The Masoretic Text is, of course, the canonical text in Judaism and readily
available for study. The two oldest codices of the Masoretic Text are the tenth-
century Aleppo Codex, published by Goshen-Gottstein in a facsimile edition,
and the eleventh-century Leningrad Codex, published by Freedman, Beck,
and Sanders in a facsimile edition, and also available in the Dotan edition. 33
The damaged Aleppo Codex preserves Deuteronomy only beginning with
28:17, while the Leningrad Codex preserves the entire book. Because both
the codices are available in facsimile, they can be consulted directly; in addi-
tion, the current diplomatic critical editions of Deuteronomy are based on the
Leningrad Codex: Biblia Hebraica in the Kittel and Stuttgart editions, as well
as Biblia Hebraica Quinta, as it becomes available.
The daughter versions of the Masoretic Text will also be helpful, but not
central, in determining patterns among the variants. These are, ﬁrst, the Tar-
gums: Targum Onqelos, available in the Sperber edition; Targum Pseudo-Jonathan,
available in the Rieder edition; Targum Neoﬁti I; and the Fragmentary Targums,
edited by Klein.34 Second, we have the Syriac Peshi†ta, in the Leiden edition;
and ﬁnally, the Vulgate, edited by Weber.35
The second complete ancient Hebrew witness to Deuteronomy is in the
Samaritan Pentateuch, the canonical text of the Samaritan community. This
text has a veneer of sectarian Samaritan editing, most notably making Mt.
Gerizim the central place of worship and making a change to the past tense in
the phrase “the place which the Lord will choose/has chosen (rjb/rjby).”36
Once this ideological veneer is removed, what remains is an ancient Hebrew

witness to the text of the Torah. This relatively recent insight is strengthened
by the fact that, among the Qumran texts, manuscripts very close to the Sa-
maritan Pentateuch were found, minus its ideological changes, a group now
referred to as the pre- or proto-Samaritan texts. Although this group has been
characterized as “harmonistic” by Eshel,37 most of the harmonizing changes
involve importing parallel sections of Deuteronomy into Exodus and Num-
bers, not the other way around.38 Therefore, the pre-Samaritan text of Deu-
teronomy cannot be characterized as another “edition” of the book, as is the
case with Exodus and Numbers,39 but simply stands as another witness to the
ancient text. The Samaritan Pentateuch is available in the editions of von Gall,
Íadaqa, and Tal.40
The third major witness to the ancient text of Deuteronomy is the Septua-
gint (LXX), the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Torah is the
oldest part of the Septuagint, its translation probably taking place in the mid-
third century b.c.e. For the Greek Deuteronomy we have three very ancient
exemplars: Papyrus Rylands 458, dating to the second century b.c.e., which
includes fragments of chaps. 23–28; 4QLXXDeut, dating to the early or mid-
second century b.c.e.,41 which contains ﬁve fragments, one of which can be
identiﬁed conﬁdently as Deut 11:4; and Papyrus Fouad 266, dating to the ﬁrst
century b.c.e., which contains Deut 31:36–32:7.
Of course, these three manuscripts do not exhaust the evidence; there is a
plethora of manuscript evidence for the Septuagint Deuteronomy, collated
and divided into families by John Wevers in his critical eclectic edition for the
Göttingen Septuagint project.42 This edition is the ﬁrst place the text critic
will turn for the Greek witness. However, it is not the only place she should
turn, for Wevers has a preference for the Masoretic Text that underlies all his
text-critical decisions. As he himself states, “These Notes are based on the pre-
supposition that the parent text being translated was in the main much like the

consonantal text of MT; . . . it seems only right to begin with the consonantal
text of MT, and to accept change only after all other avenues of understanding
have been explored.”43 It is very helpful of Wevers to share his presupposition
up front, because it aids the reader in understanding the basis for his text-
critical decisions. I, however, do not yet share his presupposition; I prefer to
keep an open mind regarding what the parent text of the Septuagint Deuter-
onomy actually looked like, and so I will use the Göttingen edition with care
and consult the apparatuses closely. In addition, I will take advantage of the
different approach of the Cambridge Septuagint, edited by Brooke and Mac-
Lean, which is a diplomatic edition based on Codex Vaticanus.44
The daughter translations of G, like the daughter translations of M, will be
helpful in offering support for the place of a reading in the tradition. The
daughter versions of the LXX are the Arabic, Armenian, Ethiopic, Coptic, Ve-
tus Latina, Palestinian-Syriac, and the Syrohexaplar. Most of these translations
are not available in critical editions, an exception being Melvin Peters’s edition
of the Coptic text.45
The remainder of the textual evidence for Deuteronomy includes quota-
tions in New Testament and patristic sources, rabbinic quotations, and medi-
eval manuscripts, both Christian and Jewish. These I will not collate and will
use very sparingly; they are further removed from the ancient text and less
helpful for text-critical purposes.
I have laid out all this evidence in order to demonstrate why I believe it is
possible to produce a critical, eclectic text of Deuteronomy according to the
canons of textual criticism. Fortunately for the text critic, the text of Deuter-
onomy is well preserved, but with a tendency toward expansion, a phenome-
non explainable by the particular rhetorical style of the book.46 Therefore, it
should be possible to recognize cases of expansion as well as other types of
common scribal errors and eliminate them from the text. Other variants, of
course, will be harder to adjudicate, and in those cases the Oxford Hebrew Bible
project has determined to use the Leningrad Codex as its copy text, while pre-
senting the reader with the relevant data.

While I am under no illusion that my work will miraculously reveal the Ur-
text of Deuteronomy, I do believe that the large amount of evidence means
that, with hard work, a critical text will produce a better text. This task may
be difﬁcult; however, to quote Anneli Aejmelaeus on the subject of textual
criticism, “what is difﬁcult is perhaps still not entirely impossible and ought
not to be given up.”47

What’s in a Name?
Contemporization and Toponyms in LXX-Isaiah
Ronald L. Troxel
University of Wisconsin–Madison
Ever since Seelgimann divined within LXX-Isa allusions to the translator’s
historical and cultural setting, scholars have sought intimations of that milieu
within the translation.1 The rendering of toponyms has provided one quarry
for investigations of this sort.
Seeligmann himself considered LXX-Isa’s toponyms (including allied eth-
nic names) “eminently suited to giving one an impression of the translator’s
mental and spiritual horizons,” inasmuch as they reveal the translator’s “con-
scious or unconscious tendency to rediscover, in the text he was translating,
the world of his own period.”2 For example, because the translator “replaces,
on more than one occasion, the Assyrian king of the Hebrew text by the
action of Antiochus Epiphanes, we may be justiﬁed in regarding the Greek
translation of 10:24 (mh; fobouÅ oJ laovÍ mou o¥ katoikouvnteÍ ejn Siwn ajpo; As-
surÇwn . . . plhgh;n ga;r ejgw; ejpavgw ejpµ se; touÅ ijde∂n oJdo;n A√guvptou) as echo of
the idea of a Jewish emigration from Palestine to Egypt to escape the religious
persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes.”3 In this case, AssurÇwn does not refer
to the ancient Mesopotamian kingdom or its denizens but serves as a cipher
for the Seleucids.

Van der Kooij endorses this inference and attempts to give it ﬁrmer ground-
ing by pointing out that, in 10:5, rwva is translated as referring to a people
(AssurÇwn), not a country, and positing that the translator equated the Assyr-
ian king addressed in the succeeding verses with a Seleucid ruler.4 While van
der Kooij disputes Seeligmann’s assertion that 10:24 refers to a persecution un-
der Antiochus IV, considering it more likely that “viel eher verband er damit
das Unheil, das das Gottesvolk in Jerusalem vor allem 167 v.Chr. getroffen hat,
und dieses Unheil scheint eine Flucht nach Ägypten ausgelöst zu haben,”5 he
still ﬁnds in it a reﬂection of an event affecting Jerusalem during the Hellenistic
crisis of the early second century b.c.e.
Koenig similarly concludes that LXX-Isa applied Assuvrioi “aux Syriens de
l’époque séleucide” but expands the list of place-names that the translator con-
sidered surrogates for cities in his day to include the translation of vyvrt by
KarchdovnoÍ in 23:1, 6, 10, and 14, which Koenig labels “un indice oraculaire
très visible.”6 Indeed, for Koenig, “l’interprétation oraculaire de noms géogra-
phiques, ethniques ou personnels établit sans conteste que le livre d’Is a été uti-
lisé par G à des ﬁns oraculaires contemporaines.”7
The question is whether this perception is right; did the translator of LXX-
Isaiah treat the toponyms of his Vorlage as references to political or ethnic en-
tities in his own day? As a ﬁrst step toward an answer, we must survey the
translator’s methods in rendering the 108 toponyms of Isaiah, which appear a
total of 558 times. In only 4 instances would I conclude that the translator’s
Vorlage contained a variant vis-à-vis the MT, beyond merely orthographic
variants. In 8:14 ∆Iak∫b attests bq[y, in place of MT’s larcy; in 11:16 ejn
A√guvptå surely reﬂects µyrxmb in contrast to MT’s rwvam; and in 66:19 Foud
attests dwp in the Vorlage, opposite MT’s lwp. More signiﬁcantly, in 30:4 the
LXX’s mavthn suggests that its Vorlage read µnj rather than MT’s snj. This last
case reduces the number of toponyms available to the translator by one, to 557.
Twenty-four of these occurrences lack a clear Greek equivalent, and (be-
cause my interest is in how the translator represented toponyms) it is unimpor-
tant whether each is due to an absence from the Vorlage or to omission by the
translator. For this reason, I will deduct these 24 from the total, leaving 533
instances in which the translator represents a Hebrew place-name.
However, there are also instances when the translator seems to have found
a toponym in his Vorlage that is not attested in the MT. The ﬁrst is in 1:21,

where corresponding to hnman hyrq hnwzl htyh hkya, the LXX reads pΩÍ ejgev-
neto povrnh povliÍ pisth; Siwn. It appears that a scribe had already inserted ˆwyx
as a gloss, because there is no reason to attribute it to the translator.
Two other instances are similar and adjacent to each other. In 22:1, parallel
to MT’s ˆwyzj ayg acm ‘an oracle of the valley of vision’, the LXX reads tov rJhÅma
thÅÍ favraggoÍ Siwn ‘the word of the valley of Zion’. Similarly, in v. 5 the LXX
reads ejn favraggi Siwn parallel to the MT’s ˆwyzj aygb. Positing that the trans-
lator merely took advantage of graphic ambiguities simply is a cover for a prej-
udice against ﬁnding variants. The LXX’s Vorlage read ˆwyxh in both places.
Two cases in which graphic confusion was a factor are 25:5 and 32:2, where
both times the LXX reads ejn Siwn for the MT’s ˆwyxb ‘in the desert’. Even
then one cannot speak of the translator’s “taking advantage” of the orthogra-
phy, inasmuch as these are the only occurrences of ˆ/yx: in the Tanach, so that
he can be forgiven for reading the more common ˆ/YxI, a reading likely tradi-
tional in his community.
In all 5 of these cases, then, the translator can reasonably be said to have
found in his Vorlage toponyms not attested in the MT. Accordingly, we must
increase the number of toponyms available to him to 538. Of this number, 22
(or 4.1%) are translated with common nouns. For example, in 15:8 we ﬁnd
µylya rab rendered with touÅ frevartoÍ touÅ Ailim ‘well of Elim’, consistent with
the LXX’s pattern of translating rab in compound names.8
On the other hand, the preponderance of toponyms in Isaiah—430 (or
79.9%)—are transliterated,9 in accord with Seeligmann’s observation that the
translator “shows a preference . . . for transcriptions from Hebrew names of
towns and countries above the Hellenistic nomenclature.”10 Moreover, the
transliterations used are typically standard throughout the LXX. Thus, ˆwyx is
always rendered by Siwn and µlçwry by Ierousalhm,11 while qcmd is invari-
ably rendered by DamaskovÍ, ˆwnbl by LÇbanoÍ, and lbb by Babul∫n or Babu-
lwnÇa. Not only are these place-names common in the LXX, but they are also
used by such Hellenistic authors as Strabo and Didorus Siculus.12
8. Similarly, in 15:1 bawm ryq is translated to; te∂coÍ thÅÍ MwabÇtidoÍ, and in 16:11 ryql
vrj is represented by wJseµ te∂coÍ o¶ ejnekaÇnisaÍ (the res of vrj read as dalet).
9. “Transliteration” refers to Greek words whose characters correspond recognizably
to the Hebrew characters, whether the word has been adapted to Greek declension (e.g.,
ÂssuvrioÍ) or has been preserved indeclinable (e.g., Assour [Isa 31:8]). I include in the list
of place-names words that, in Isaiah’s vocabulary, often designate the country’s people,
such as larcy and hdwhy.
10. Seeligmann, Septuagint Version, 77.
11. The word µlçwry is not represented in 4:4 and 36:7 (part of a large minus).
12. For details of usage, see BDAG, s.v.

Equally noteworthy are the hapax legomena that the translator recognized
as place-names and transliterated. For example, µylg is found in Isaiah only in
10:29, where it is transliterated Gallim.13 The word hnmdm appears in the
Bible only in Isa 10:31, where the LXX gives Madebhna (apparently reading
hnbdm). The word µynrwj is rendered Arwniim in 15:5 but Wrwnaim in Jer
31[48]:3, 5, and 34, its only other occurrences in the Bible. LXX-Isaiah rep-
resents tyjwl with Louiq in 15:5, whereas Jer 31[48]:5 gives Alawq, parallel
to MT’s twjlh (Qere tyjwlh).
On the other hand, of the 538 Hebrew toponyms represented, for only 86
(or 16%) does the translator use Hellenistic equivalents. Setting aside the ubiq-
uitous rendering of µyrxm by A≥guptoÍ (34x) or A√guvptioÍ (16x),14 the 36
remaining instances are distributed among 16 words. For example, the 8 ap-
pearances of vwk are rendered by either A√qiopÇa (3x) or A√qÇoy (5x), equiva-
lents found throughout the LXX. rx appears 6 times, always renderd TuvroÍ, its
most common equivalent in the LXX.15 µwda is 3 times rendered ∆IdoumaÇa, a
common LXX equivalent (but Edwm in 63:1, which is also found elsewhere in
the LXX). In each of its 3 appearances, ˆ[x is rendered by TavniÍ, a stock LXX
equivalent. Both occurrences of dwdva are rendered ◊AzwtoÍ, a common LXX
equivalent. As for words appearing just once, πn is rendered by MemfiÍ (19:13),
as it is throughout the LXX, while ˆwy is rendered ÔEllavÍ (66:19), an equivalent
appearing elsewhere in the LXX.
In Isa 27:12 µyrxm ljn is translated ÔRinokorouvrwn to mark the southern
boundary of the territory that the Kyrios will one day enclose within walls.
Even though this translation stands within a utopian scene fashioned by the
translator, the speciﬁcation of the boundary by a Hellenistic toponym is no
more remarkable than the previous examples.16 As Ottley observes, “the Alex-
andrian translator naturally gives the Greek name for the ‘brook of Egypt.’”17
This pattern of using standard Hellenistic equivalents makes the occasional
13. In the word’s only other appearance (1 Sam 25:44), the LXX reads tåÅ ejk Romma for
the MT’s µylgm rva.
14. The only variation from this is ÔRinokorouvrwn || µyrxm ljn in 27:12, on which see
below (p. 000).
15. While a linguistic relationship between rx and TuvroÍ is apparent, the transliteration
is not as close to the Hebrew as the transliteration Sor (cf. the characteristic Sidwn for ˆwdyx),
which appears 9 times in Ezekiel.
16. Joseph Ziegler reports that “Rinokorura ist die Grenzstadt zwischen Ägypten und
die Syrien” ( Joseph Ziegler, Untersuchungen zur Septuaginta des Buches Isaias [Münster: Asch-
endorff, 1934] 203).

deviation noteworthy. Most remarkable are the equivalents found in 9:11[10]–
12[11]:
Immediately arresting is tou;Í ejpanistanomevnouÍ ejp∆ oßroÍ Siwn for MT’s ta
ˆyxr yrx, because elsewhere ˆyxr is transliterated ÔRaasswn, both inside Isaiah
(7:1, 8:6) and out (e.g., 4 Kgdms 15:37; 16:5, 6, 9).18 Although Seeligmann
posited that the translator merely took advantage of the orthography to ﬁnd a
reference to Zion,19 the appearance of ˆwyx as a gloss in the Vorlage in 1:21 and
of ˆwyxh in place of ˆwyzj in 22:1 and 5 more likely implies that the LXX’s Vor-
lage read ˆwyx rh yrx ta, as Duhm posited.20
More striking is tou;Í £EllhnaÍ || µytvlp, the singular example of this
equivalence in the Bible and the only place that £Ellhn appears in LXX-Isa,
which otherwise translates µytvlp as ajllovfuloi (2:6, 11:14), its most com-
mon equivalent throughout the LXX and the one it uses for tvlp in 14:29
and 31.21 £Ellhn appears 5 other times in the LXX, each time corresponding
to ˆwy in the MT ( Joel 4:6; Zech 9:13; Dan 8:21; 10:20; 11:2), a Hebrew to-
ponym that appears in Isa 66:19, where it is translated ÔEllavÍ. While a graph-
ically anomalous substitution of ˆwyw for µytvlpw in the Vorlage cannot be ruled
out, we should at least note that the Syr., Tg., and Vg. attest µytvlpw, and the
initial lpw and part of the ç are visible in 1QIsaa. In this light, and given the fact
that this is a singular equivalence within the book (similar to ÔRinokorouvrwn in

tines were not of the same blood, i.e., Semite, as the other inhabitants of Canaan, but of an
origin akin to the Hellenic race” (Redpath, “The Geography of the Septuagint,” 295). He
adds that the use of ajllofule∂n and ajllofulismovÍ “in 4 and 2 Maccabees respectively, also
points toward the Greek world, for they are used of the Hellenizing party” (p. 295 n. 16).

27:12), it is likely that the translator interpreted µytvlp with an eye to the
Hellenized coastal cities, which lay ajf∆ hJlÇou dusmΩn (rwjam).22
The surmise that the translator equated the µytvlp with the Hellenistic
coastal cities of his day ﬁnds support from another toponym in this passage,
SurÇan. At ﬁrst blush this rendering of µra seems unremarkable,23 because it is
a stock equivalence used throughout the LXX (134x).24 However, 9:12 is the
only place where SurÇa is used in the LXX-Isa, although we ﬁnd SuvroÍ for µra
in 17:3.25 On the other hand, µra is transliterated Aram in 7:1, 2, 5, and 8,26
an equivalence found elsewhere in the LXX only in Gen 10:22, 23; 36:28 (MT
ˆra), and 1 Chr 2:10, 23; and 7:34. Although in each of these cases Aram refers
to a person who became the progenitor of a nation,27 in Isaiah 7 Aram desig-
nates the nation, as is evident from the rendering of µra ˚lm by basileu;Í Âram.
Wevers’s speculation that “Aram was used to parallel the proper names Israhvl
and Ioudav of v. 1 and Efravim of vv. 2, 8 and 9” does not amswer the question
why the more frequently occurring proper name SurÇa was not used.28
Notably, the translator renders another toponym distinctively in chap. 7.
Rather than translating ˆwrmv by SamareÇa, as elsewhere in LXX-Isa (8:4; 9:8;
10:9, 10, 11; 36:19) and throughout the LXX, he chose Somorwn, found else-
where only in 2 Chr 13:4, Ezra 4:10, and Neh 3:34. Taken alongside Aram,
this suggests that the translator archaized the names to lend an air of antiquity
to a narrative expressly set in the time of Isaiah.
In contrast to this, and alongside tou;Í £EllhnaÍ, the translator’s use of
SurÇan in 9:12 evidently had in view the Syrians of his day, the Seleucids.29
However, this example proves the rule: the translator did not, by-and-large,
treat Isaianic toponyms as surrogates waiting to be unmasked; but when he re-
garded a place-name as relevant to events in his day, he was not shy about sub-
22. As Seeligmann summarizes, in these verses “we are directly and unmistakably trans-
ported into the historical atmosphere of Palestine in Hellenistic times” (Seeligmann, Septua-
gint Version, 81).
23. The Syriac reads µdal for µra, a common rendering in Syr. (Michael Weitzman,
The Syriac Version of the Old Testament [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999] 49).
24. For an overview of the LXX’s translation of µra, see John Wevers, “Aram and Ara-
maean in the Septuagint,” in The World of the Aramaeans I (ed. P. M. Michèle Daviau, John
Wevers, and Michael Weigl; JSOTSup 324; Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 2001)
237–51.
25. Not surprisingly, SuvroÍ translates ymra 8x, although 15x it corresponds to µra.
26. The LXX lacks a clear equivalent for whylmr ˆbw µraw ˆyxr in v. 4.

stituting a Hellenistic toponym, even if it was at variance with the Hebrew
toponym. As a result, there is no prima facie case for taking a commonly oc-
curring equivalent as a cipher for a political entity in the translator’s day.
This conclusion applies to two instances noted in the survey of scholars’
discussions of place-names above. While van der Kooij ﬁnds signiﬁcance in
the fact that the LXX translated rwva in 10:5 not as the name of a country but
as the name of a people, he notes that this equivalence is typical for LXX-Isa
(42x).30 Assuvrioi is also the most common equivalent for rwva throughout
the LXX (138x). This undercuts the inference that Assuvrioi is itself notewor-
thy. Although we will wait until we explore 10:5–14 to see whether the con-
text signals that the translator perceived a Seleucid ruler behind the Assyrian
king, we see here that one cannot base this argument on his use of AssurÇoiÍ.
Equally, in 10:24 AssurÇwn, by itself, cannot be used to assert that the trans-
lator had in mind Seleucid action against Judea, as Seeligmann proposed.
Likewise, the translation of vyvrt as Karchd∫n in 23:1, 6, 10, and 14 is not
proof that the translator engaged in mantic interpretation. Indeed, the substitu-
tion of a Hellenistic name for a Hebrew one may simply have been to identify
an ancient location with a contemporary one, even as Gen 23:2 equates tyrq
[bra with ˆwrbj. In fact, Karchd∫n coexists in the book with the translitera-
tion QarsiÍ (60:9, 66:19) and the translation of vyvrt twyna lk by paÅn plo∂on
qalavsshÍ in 2:16. Most likely, then, in choosing Karchd∫n the translator at-
tempted to identify vyvrt in chap. 23 with a city recognizable to his readers,
just as he used ÔRinokorouvrwn for µyrxm ljn in 27:12. There is no indication
that Karchd∫n was chosen due to contemporaneous political circumstances.31
In sum, the translator’s choice of Greek equivalents for Hebrew toponyms
is, in general, too unremarkable to assume that he characteristically perceived
Hebrew names as preﬁguring political entities of his day. On the few occasions
when he did so, he marked the equation clearly.
A set of connected passages in Isaiah 9–11 provides a case study to test this
conclusion. The central passage is 10:5–14, which van der Kooij judges to re-
ﬂect activities of the house of Seleucus, thereby establishing “the king of the
Assyrians” as a cipher for a Seleucid ruler.32 Among the more opaque equiva-
lents in this passage is the translation of tmj as ArabÇa (10:9) rather than
30. Van der Kooij, Die alten Textzeugen, 35–36.
31. Van der Kooij draws attention to Targum Jonathan’s equation of vyvrt with Africa
in 1 Kgs 10:22, 22:49; Jer 10:9 (Arie van der Kooij, The Oracle of Tyre: The Septuagint of
Isaiah 23 as Version and Vision [Leiden: Brill, 1998] 49).

Aimaq (as in 36:19, 37:13).33 Although the LXX’s Vorlage possibly contained
a variant, the fact that the same equivalence appears again in 11:11 (kaµ ejx
ÂrabÇaÍ || tmjmw) suggests that the variation was due to the translator.
Buttressing this inference is the observation that, in both of these passages,
this equivalent is found among similarly striking equivalents for place-names.
Thus we ﬁnd the rendering of vymkrk as th;n c∫ran th;n ejpavnw babulΩnoÍ in
10:9 (CarcamiÍ in Jer 46:2) as part of the Assyrian king’s claim:
Seeligmann argues that, because the translator was unfamiliar with vymkrk (a
hapax legomenon in Isaiah), he spoke in general terms about “a country above
Babylon.”34 Additionally, maintains Seeligmann, the translator identiﬁed wnlk
with hnlk, a city mentioned in Gen 10:10 (Calannh ejn t¬Å g¬Å Sennaar), with
which the translator correlated the story of the building of the tower in Gene-
sis 11 (ou• oJ puvrgoÍ åjokdomhvqh).35 This story exerts an inﬂuence again in 11:11,
the same verse in which ArabÇa once more translates tmj.
The absence of an equivalent for dprak in 10:9 is also explicable by com-
paring 10:9 with 11:11, where the translator omits another toponym. Just as
the story of the tower inﬂuenced the translation of wnlk in 10:9, so also the
translator rendered r[nvmw in 11:11 as kaµ ajpo; hJlÇou ajnatolΩn, due to the lo-
cation speciﬁed for the tower in Gen 11:2 (ajpo; ajnatolΩn eu•ron pedÇon ejn g¬Å
Sennaar).36 The fact that the translator substituted this phrase for r[nv, rather
than transliterating it as Sennaar and appending the phrase ajpo; hJlÇou ajna-
tolΩn (comparable to his qualiﬁcation of Calannh by ejn t¬Å g¬Å Sennaar in
10:10), suggests that he was more concerned to locate the action generally
than to identify the site with precision. Parallel to this, he might well have
considered unessential a translation of dpra in 10:9 (transliterated Arfaq in
36:19, alongside Aimaq for the MT’s tmj).
33. Throughout the LXX, ArabÇa primarily translates br[ (LXX-Isa twice renders ybr[
with ◊Aray).

Equally intelligible, in this light, is BabulwnÇa || swrtp in 11:11, the only
place where this equivalence appears.37 Given the translator’s insertion of Ba-
bulwn as part of his rendering in 10:9 (th;n c∫ran th;n ejpavnw BabulΩnoÍ), where
Gen 11:2 was again his pedagogue, his employment of Babulwn for swrtp
should occasion no surprise, especially because this provides a Mesopotamian
power as companion to A√qiopÇa, just as ÂssurÇwn is companion to A√guvtou.38
Although the translator typically resorts to transliteration for unfamiliar
toponyms, in these two passages he rendered some toponyms via associations
with texts outside Isaiah and omitted others, all with the apparent goal of pro-
viding geographic bearings for his readers.
Van der Kooij, however, asserts that the toponyms of 10:9 can be identiﬁed
with lands conquered by Seleucid rulers. Rejecting Seeligmann’s assertion that
the translator rendered wnlk in the light of the story of the tower, on the
grounds that “in Gen 11 aber nicht von einem Turmbau in Chalanee die Rede
ist,” he notes that “in der etwas jüngeren jüdischen Exegese zu Kalne in Gen
10,10 wird diese Stadt in Babylonien ist.”39 Also citing Jerome’s comment on
wnlk in Gen 10:10 (“postea verso nomine a Seleuco rege est dicta Seleucia”),
he concludes that by using Calannh the translator possibly “mit dem Turm-
bau in Chalanne auf den Bau der Stadt Seleucia . . . der Hauptstadt der seleu-
kidischen Reiches, anspielt.”40
Having posited this, van der Kooij equates the ruler’s boast of having cap-
tured th;n c∫ran th;n ejpavnw babulΩnoÍ with Seleucus III’s recapture of the
upper regions of the Seleucid empire, while noting Polybius’s report that, in
218 b.c.e., “haben sich die Araber gemeinsam Antiochus III. unterworfen
(Polybios, Historiae V. 71).”41 Moreover, he asserts that oujk eßlabon th;n c∫ran
th;n ejpavnw babulΩnoÍ implies “dass Babylon zum Reich der ‘Assyrer’ ge-
hörte,” because the oracle is directed against the Assyrians (v. 5).42 Comparing
a passage from the third Sibylline Oracle that equates the Seleucids with the
Babylonians, he concludes that “der Verfasser der LXX Jes in Jes 10,9 . . . mit
dem assyrischen König auf einen seleukidischen Herrscher anspielt.”43 Thus,
37. The 4 remaining appearances (all outside Isaiah) are transliterated PaqourhÍ.
38. The only other place that babulwnÇa (or babulwn) does not correspond to lbb in
the MT is 14:23, where the LXX translates hytmcw with kaµ qhvsw th;n BabulwnÇan. How-
ever, this clariﬁcation of the 3rd fem.-sing. sufﬁx simply compensates for the translation of
µç lbbl ytrkhw as kaµ ajpolΩ aujtΩn oßnoma in the previous verse.

van der Kooij explains the toponyms of 10:9 as the translator’s infusion of the
text, not just with Hellenistic toponyms, but with allusions to the political re-
alities of his day.
There are problems with this explanation, however. First, the assertion by
the aßrcwn that he has taken th;n c∫ran th;n ejpavnw babulΩnoÍ does not neces-
sarily imply that the aßrcwn himself was in Babylon, nor does it imply anything
about the status of Babylon itself. Second, van der Kooij’s objection to Seelig-
mann’s proposal that the translator rendered wnlk by Calannh with an eye to
Genesis 11 overlooks the fact that Seeligmann builds his argument not simply
by reference to Gen 11:2 but also by comparing the mention of Calannh in
Gen 10:10, which places it ejn t¬Å g¬Å Sennaar, the same location given for the
tower in Gen 11:2.
In fact, this perceived intertextual reading rests on more than the two verses
in Genesis and Isa 10:9, because (as we have seen) Isaiah 11 also shows reﬂexes
of the story of building the tower, as does 9:10[9],44 where the LXX gives un-
usual equivalents for MT’s vocabulary:
The correspondence between the LXX and the MT in the ﬁrst line is trans-
parent, and there are equally perceptible correspondences in lines two and
three,45 while the only Hebrew word without a clear equivalent is πyljn. Koe-
nig suggests the translator transposed hnbn and πyljn, construing the latter
in the light of an Aramaic homonym meaning ‘to cut down’.46 This merely
trades one problem for another, however, because line three already has a rec-
ognizable Hebrew equivalent for ejkkovywmen (w[dg).
The solution is more likely found in addressing the question of the LXX’s
plus, eJauto∂Í puvrgon, which bears a striking resemblance to LXX-Gen 11:4a:
kaµ eπpan DeuÅte o√kodomhvswmen eJauto∂Í povlin kaµ puvrgon. The hypothesis

337
that LXX-Isa translated 9:10[9] under the inﬂuence of Gen 11:4 explains not
only the plus but also why o√kodomhvswmen stands at a later point than hnbn.47
The inﬂuence of Genesis 11 is apparent even earlier in 9:10[9], with laxeuv-
swmen lÇqouÍ, which is reminiscent of Gen 11:3: (deuÅte) plinqeuvswmen plÇn-
qouÍ. Like that phrase, this one is introduced by deuÅte and is constructed of a
volative + cognate external accusative. Given the clear impress of Gen 11:4 on
the end of the verse, it is likely that the shape of this phrase similarly bears the
impress of Gen 11:3.48
In this light, it appears that in 10:9 the translator was guided at least as much
by the story of the tower as by contemporary geography.49 Although Koenig
disparages this conclusion on the grounds that it reduces the translator to “un
amateur d’antiquités bibliques,”50 it actually reveals that he drew on a variety
of sources in clarifying his text, not all of which had to do with his historical/
political milieu.
Of course, van der Kooij’s identiﬁcation of these toponyms with Seleucid
conquests is bound up with his assertion that the translator equated the Assyr-
ian king in chap. 10 with a Seleucid ruler.51 However, this contention is difﬁ-
cult to support in the light of the translator’s handling of vv. 5–14.
The translator interpreted this passage as an address to a ruler preoccupied
with conquest. As Ziegler contended, the translator twice supplied eßlabon in
v. 9, as well as lhvmyomai in v. 10, because “er an die Eroberung der genannten
Länder durch den König von Assur dachte,” which Ziegler concluded was an
expedient forced on him “weil ihm der Satzbau von V. 9 nicht recht klar
47. As already observed by Ziegler, Untersuchungen zur Septuaginta, 63.
48. Even though I cannot agree with Koenig’s conclusion that the translator infused
9:10[9] with reminiscences of the story of the tower so as to discredit the Samaritan com-
munity, he has correctly identiﬁed the inﬂuence of Genesis 11 here, thus showing the extent
to which the translator was affected by that story (L’Herméneutique, 92). Van der Kooij has
pointed out the fallacy in Koenig’s assumption that “Samaria” would have univocally raised
the specter of the Samaritan schism, noting that the Greek text of Sirach 50:26 distinguishes
between o¥ kaqhvmenoi ejn oßrei SamareÇaÍ and oJ lao;Í oJ mwro;Í oJ katoikΩn ejn SikimoiÍ. As van
der Kooij also notes, Koenig fails to pay adequate attention to equally striking and signiﬁcant
differences with the MT in the context of v. 9 (Arie van der Kooij, “Accident or Method?
On ‘Analogical’ Interpretation in the Old Greek of Isa and in 1QIsa ” [review of Koenig,
L’Herméneutique analogique du Judaïsme antique] BO 43 [1986] 366–76, 370).
49. As Arie van der Kooij points out (in private correspondence), however, this does not
relieve us of the question of what the translator understood as “the country above Babylon”
or his conception of the location of Calannh, although the evidence to answer questions
of this sort is not readily at hand in this passage.

war.”52 More likely, however, this translation is the product of a reasoned in-
terpretation of vv. 5–14.53
Whereas the Hebrew text of v. 5 deﬁnes Asshur as ypa fbv and asserts that
it wields the staff of the Lord’s wrath, the LXX follows the announcement of
woe to the Assyrians with:
The translation of hfmw as kaµ ojrghÅÍ creates an extended phrase modifying hJ
rJavbdoÍ, rather than introducing a phrase deﬁning Asshur’s role, as in the
MT.54 Although this restructured syntax keeps the “rod” of wrath in Assyrian
hands, a change introduced in v. 6 gives this assertion a different meaning.
Rather than the Lord’s sending the Assyrian(s) against an ‘impious nation’
(πnj ywgb), the Kyrios sends his wrath e√Í eßqnoÍ aßnomon.55 Still more striking is
the translator’s rendering of the next clause:
Although the ﬁrst-person singular sufﬁx of ytrb[ is recognizable in ejmåÅ, the
lack of an equivalent for the noun is perplexing, until we compare this with the
manner in which other versions ﬁnessed this form. For example, the Peshi†ta
translates ytrb[ µ[ as aNtKa aMo ‘a wrathful people’, while the Targum
elaborates: ytyrwa l[ wrb[d am[ ‘the people who transgressed my instruction’.
In this light we can perceive in the LXX an equally interpretive rendering.
Given that the ﬁrst half of the verse speaks of the Kyrios’s intent to send his
wrath on a ‘lawless nation’, the translator evidently perceived ytrb[ µ[ as mean-
ing ‘the people who execute my wrath’ and collapsed it into ‘my people’.
As a result of these interpretive ploys, the assertion that ‘the rod of my an-
ger and wrath’ is in the hands of the Assyrians does not mean that they wield
the Kyrios’s wrath but, rather, that wrath is now resident with them (in other

his rendering of whfmw as kaµ oJ qumo;Í aujtouÅ in 10:26 as well as his use of ojrghv for atypical
equivalents elsewhere (kaµ ojrghÅÍ || hxanw in 37:3; hJ ojrgh; para; kurÇou || uh jwr in 59:19).

words, in their bosom) and executed by Israel.56 As Seeligmann summarizes,
with eßqnoÍ aßnomon, “the translator apparently had in mind not Israel, but hos-
tile Assyria . . . and he regarded it as a duty with which God had charged the
Jewish people, to plunder towns and trample them under foot.”57
As in the MT, v. 7 focuses on the ruminations of this bellicose ruler. How-
ever, whereas in the MT the ruler is ill disposed to acknowledge that he is
merely a vehicle of the Lord’s wrath against Israel, in the LXX he fails to con-
sider that the Kyrios’s anger is poised against him and his cities. Rather, he is
intent on a course of destruction that will engulf numerous nations.
Noteworthy is the choice of oJ nouÅÍ aujtouÅ to translate wbblb, because the
more typical equivalents for bbl in LXX-Isa are kardÇa (25x) and yuchv (6x),
as in the preceding clause: kaµ t¬Å yuc¬Å || wbblw.58 Because nouÅÍ appears for
bbl outside this passage only in 41:22 (although dianoÇa translates it in 14:1359
and 35:4), its reappearance in 10:12 makes this the only co-occurrence of this
atypical equivalent within one passage.
Having detailed the bent of this nouÅÍ in 10:7–11, v. 12 announces judg-
ment as follows:
Rather than judgment befalling ‘the fruit of the haughtiness of the heart of the
king of Assyria’ (MT), it falls on ‘the ruler of the Assyrians’, designated in ad-
vance by the epithet ‘the great mind’, the same nouÅÍ that refused to consider
what the Kyrios was plotting for him. Although the use of o√koumevnh in v. 14
to describe the extent of “the great mind’s” intended conquests may support
the hypothesis that the translator had Seleucid rulers in mind (inasmuch as it
56. This is preferable to das Neves’s conclusion that tåÅ ejmåÅ laåÅ refers to the “Assyr-
ians,” while eßqnoÍ aßnomon designates Israel (A teologia, 202). Even if eßqnoÍ aßnomon denotes
Israel elsewhere, the characterization of the subsequent Assyrian ruler as haughty (10:7–11)
and the Kyrios’s resolve to judge his haughty mind (v. 12) make it difﬁcult to imagine the
translator’s entertaining the idea that the Assyrians were the Kyrios’s people.
57. Seeligmann, Septuagint Version, 88.
58. Although the LXX’s Vorlage may have read wbblbw, it is equally possible that t¬Å
yuc¬Å is the translator’s reformulation. We encounter the same quandary in the Targum’s
hyblbw.
59. Van der Kooij argues that 14:13, even though translated literally, can refer to Antio-
chus IV, “denn er trifft sich mit Dan 8,10 und 2 Makk 9,10 in der Deutung des Verhaltens
dieses Königs” (van der Kooij, Die alten Textzeugen, 42). This, on its own, is a weak argu-
ment and certainly could not be the basis for positing an association with 10:12 as a refer-
ence to Antiochus IV (van der Kooij posits no such connection).

transposes the passage “from the atmosphere surrounding the Assyrian claims
to world sovereignty into the Hellenistic period”),60 the designation of this
ﬁgure as an aßrcwn is evidence against it.
Raurell has drawn attention to the importance of aßrcwn for the translator,
who used it as an equivalent for 17 Hebrew words.61 The use of aßrcwn for
˚lm in 10:12 is especially striking, because each of the other 25 times that ˚lm
rwva appears in Isaiah it is translated basileuvÍ ÂssurÇwn. Moreover, for the
80 occurrences of ˚lm, LXX-Isa always uses basileuvÍ (72x) or basileuvein
(3x), except in 10:12 and in 8:21.62
In 8:21 we read,
As Seeligmann notes, patacra is a transliteration of Aramaic arktp ‘idol’,
which appears in the Targum’s rendering of this verse.63 LXX-Isaiah uses
patacron again in 37:38 (its only other appearance in the LXX) in the de-
scription of the Assyrian king worshiping his god. Evidently, then, the trans-
lator perceived the deities of 8:21 as foreign, which suggests that he also
regarded this aßrcwn as foreign.
The address of these words to a group (ejre∂te) is attributable to the trans-
lator, who frequently assimilates the grammatical person and number of some
pronouns to other pronouns in the context.64 In this case, the second-person
plural resumes advice addressed to those who have been urged by others to
avail themselves of necromancy (8:19). The people who propound this advice
are described as inexcusably violating the Torah (v. 20):

With this rendering, the translator continues a theme that he had divined just
prior to this.65 After admonishing addressees to trust in the Kyrios so as not to
confront him in judgment, the LXX speaks of the house of Israel falling into
a snare and troubles (8:14–15) and concludes with the statement:
Clearly the translator is again concerned about a group that is opposing the
Torah in some way.66 Indeed, the translator seems to have been guided in the
latter half of chap. 8 by his concern for the Torah and his conviction that Is-
rael’s leaders are disloyal to it.
However, it is important to note the distinction between the people said to
inhibit Torah study (o¥ sfragizovmenoi to;n novmon touÅ mh; maqe∂n, v. 1667) or to
encourage necromancy (kaµ eja;n e≥pwsin pro;Í uJmaÅÍ, v. 19) and the ruler in
v. 21. As is common in LXX-Isa, the ones who afﬂict the people are described
as a group,68 whereas v. 21 envisions a solitary ﬁgure whose foreign identity is
suggested by his appeal to ta; patacra.
This description’s point of contact with 10:12, once again, is that to speak
of this ﬁgure as an aßrcwn the translator deviated from his typical equivalents for
˚lm. However, aside from the possible assumption that the aßrcwn of 8:21 is a
foreign ruler, the description in chap. 8 holds no similarity to the description of
65. The middle phrase of this verse shows the closest correspondence to the MT, al-
though the choice of e√Í bohvqeian for hdw[tlw may well derive from relating the word to
rz[, just as the translation of rjç with dwÅra probably reﬂects the fact that it was read as
djv (so Ottley, The Book of Isaiah, 2:150). In each case the translator ﬁlled out the sense by
supplying what he considered an appropriate verb.
hdw[t rwx
tovte faneroµ eßsontai
ydmlb hrwt µwtj
o¥ sfragizovmenoi to;n novmon touÅ mh; maqe∂n
66. The relationship of the second clause to the MT is discernible, despite enigmas, the
most vexing of which is tovte faneroµ eßsontai with hdw[t rwx. As Ottley suggests, the
LXX’s Vorlage may have read ydmlm for ydmlb (The Book of Isaiah, 2:150), and this may be
the source of the divergence in the ﬁrst half of the verse. In the light of his perception of
the second phrase, the translator may have read hdw[t as hrw[t and related it to hr[, even
as he renders hr[y as ajpokaluvyei in 3:17 and r[nw as fanera; eßstai in 33:9 (cf. ibid., 2:271).
Although this still leaves tovte || rwx oblique, the translator interjects temporal conjunctions
frequently enough that its presence here is best attributed to him (cf. tovte speÇrei || ≈yphw
in 28:25; tovte eßstai || ˆtnw in 30:23; kaµ nuÅn oJ oi˙koÍ Iakwb || bwq[y tyb in 2:5; nuÅn de; e√Í
ç˙dou || lav la ˚a in 14:15).
67. It is not clear, however, whether this is to be taken literally (and as having to do with
prohibitions during the Hellenistic reforms of the second century) or ﬁguratively, as a char-
acterization of “false teaching” of the Torah (so Seeligmann, Septuagint Version, 105–6).

the aßrcwn in chap. 10. Nor does the translator take the opportunity in 8:21 to
construct a fuller picture of this aßrcwn or to link him with the violations of the
Torah just described. This aßrcwn seems incidental to the problems affecting Je-
rusalem; he merely bears the brunt of popular displeasure. Thus, it is doubtful
the translator chose to deviate from his typical equivalent for ˚lm in 8:21 in or-
der to identify this ruler with a speciﬁc Hellenistic overlord. This, in turn, di-
minishes the likelihood that, in using aßrcwn for ˚lm in 10:12, the translator had
in mind a speciﬁc Seleucid ruler or line of rulers.
We should also note that 10:12 is not the ﬁrst occurrence of aßrcwn within
the context of 10:5–14. Talk of a solitary aßrcwn appeared already in 10:8:
Even though aßrcwn renders yrc (for which reason µyklm was perhaps passed
over as redundant), the translator has overridden the plural form, against his
prevailing pattern of rendering yrc with aßrconteÍ.69 Moreover, the sentence
has been reformulated as a question addressed to the ruler.70
Most striking is movnoÍ || wdjy. Apparently the translator, construing vv. 9–
11 as stating an intent to build a far-ﬂung empire (th;n o√koumevnhn o§lhn
katalhvyomai), perceived this question to concern the extent of the ruler’s
sovereignty.71 This is the hubris that gives meaning to the epithet to;n nouÅn to;n
mevgan in v. 12.
Although this aspiration to sole mastery of the world might have been well
suited to a Seleucid ruler, the title aßrcwn does not ﬁt that hypothesis. In the
contemporaneous works of 1 and 2 Maccabees, the title applied to Seleucid
rulers is basileuvÍ. Moreover, while aßrcwn does not appear in 2 Maccabees, it
occurs 22 times in 1 Maccabees, where the plural 10 times designates military
commanders and 6 times, unspeciﬁed ofﬁcials. It appears 6 times in the singu-
lar: 3 times to designate the commander of an army, once for a representative
µyklm wdjy yrc alh rmay yk
kaµ eja;n e≥pwsin aujtåÅ su; movnoÍ eπ aßrcwn
69. Each of the 4 remaining occurrences of yrv is translated aßrconteÍ, while the other
11 occurrences of rc in a plural formation are translated by plural forms in Greek. Even the
lone singular form (rc) is translated tou;Í aßrcontaÍ in 9:5.
70. Although Ottley implies that the translator’s Vorlage may have read wlh for alh (The
Book of Isaiah, 2:160), it seems to me more likely that alh is expressed via a question that
expects an afﬁrmative response, while the translator supplied the pronoun as indirect object.
Compare v. 11, where the translator omits an explicit translation of alh, casting the verse
as an assertion.
71. The translator may have related wdjy to dja, even as in 65:25 we ﬁnd w[ry hlfw baz
djak rendered tovte luvkoi kaµ aßrneÍ boskhqhvsontai a§ma, the characteristic equivalent for
wdjy in LXX-Isa. Compare kata; movnaÍ for djy in Ps 32[33]:15; 140[141]:10.

of a leader (2:17, 12:53). The fact that 1 Maccabees never applies aßrcwn to a
Seleucid ruler is relevant to Isaiah 10, especially because 1 Maccabees is also a
translation into Greek from Hebrew.72 If that translator consistently used
basileuvÍ for Seleucid rulers and never applied aßrcwn to them, it becomes dif-
ﬁcult to imagine that our translator, who everywhere else renders rwva ˚lm as
oJ basileuvÍ tΩn AssurÇwn, chose aßrcwn in a text in which he perceived the
Assyrian king to be a cipher for a Seleucid ruler.
Consequently, it seems fruitless to attempt to identify this aßrcwn with a
Seleucid and equally fruitless to correlate Seleucid conquests with the LXX’s
toponyms in chap. 10, especially in light of the fact that those equivalents seem
more likely to be determined by intertextual associations.
Returning to the question of whether the translator’s fascination with
“contemporization” is a likely explanation for his rendering of toponyms, my
investigation suggests that we cannot correlate political or military events of
the late third to early second centuries b.c.e. with LXX-Isa’s toponyms with-
out ﬁrst considering other reasons that the translator might have chosen them.
By turning ﬁrst to political circumstances to explain toponyms of this sort, we
risk falling prey to what Sandmel called “parallelomania”: adducing parallels
that seem to illuminate a text but fail the test of aptness.73
Consequently, the rationale for choosing ArabÇa as the equivalent for tmj
should be sought in the translator’s desire to portray a recognizable place in
10:5–14, just as in 27:12 he chose ÔRinokorouvrwn as a more precise designa-
tion for µyrxm ljn and in 23:1, 6, 10, and 14 he rendered vyvrt as Karchd∫n,
again choosing a toponym that his audience would recognize but without any
evident interest in its political intrigues.
Noteworthy in this regard is Weitzman’s report that the Syriac renders tmj
as “Antioch” in 1 Chr 13:5, 18:9, and 2 Chr 8:4, in recognition of tmj as “the
northern boundary of the promised land . . . but identif[ying] that border with
the Taurus Mountains (as in Gen. Apocr. 21.16).”74 Similarly, the translator of
72. Harold Attridge, “1 Maccabees,” in Jewish Writings of the Second Temple Period: Apoc-
rypha, Pseudepigrapha, Qumran, Sectarian Writings, Philo, Josephus (ed. Michael Stone; Min-
neapolis: Fortress, 1984) 171.
73. Samuel Sandmel, “Parallelomania, ” JBL 81 (1962) 1–13. Sandmel addresses literary
parallels and their use to argue that one passage’s ideas were derived from another. Mutatis
mutandis, Sandmel’s concerns apply to ﬁnding events that parallel, to some degree, peculiar
phrases in LXX-Isa and suggesting that the translator was guided by them. While that sce-
nario is possible, the factors inﬂuencing the translator in each passage must be considered
before one concludes that he referred to contemporaneous events in rendering his Vorlage.

LXX-Isa may well have chosen ArabÇa for tmj because he was uncertain of its
precise location, but he wished to identify it with a territory that his audience
would know. As van der Kooij notes, the region of Lebanon was settled in the
course of Arabian migration with the name Iturea.75 Most likely it was this
group that the translator had in mind when he referred to ArabÇa. Although
it is not possible to prove that this was his reasoning, this conjecture is more
likely than the assumption that ArabÇa reﬂects Seleucid conquests, given the
translator’s reliance on intertextual associations and his departure from the
translation equivalent that would have most closely associated the king of
10:5–14 with a Seleucid ruler.
Although the translator sometimes used Hellenistic toponyms that reﬂect
the political map of his day (as is surely the case with tou;Í £EllhnaÍ || µytvlp
in 9:12[11]), this was merely one of the contemporizing inﬂuences on his elu-
cidation of Isaiah. In particular, the evidence renders it unlikely that he viewed
Hebrew toponyms as stock ciphers for places in his day. Each case must be
taken on its own, but the tendency to assume “contemporization” of topo-
nyms in the light of political circumstances is unjustiﬁed.
75. Van der Kooij, Die alten Textzeugen, 38. According to Josephus (Ant. 13.11.3), Iturea
was incorporated into the Hasmonean state by Aristobulus I (ca. 105 b.c.e.).

Characterization in the Old Greek of Job
Karl V. Kutz
Multnomah Bible College
The Septuagint is the product of an enterprise to translate the literary heri-
tage of the Jewish people into Greek. The primary goal was not the introduc-
tion of new ideas but the exposition of these texts as they were understood
within the Hellenistic Jewish community. Though various factors may have in-
ﬂuenced the LXX translators’ perception of the text’s meaning, each translator
faithfully and creatively sought to capture the sense of his Hebrew Vorlage.
Of the various translations in the LXX, the Old Greek of Job is especially
fascinating, due to its frequent, and sometimes extensive, divergences from
modern translations of the MT. Though some of these divergences are due to
variant readings in the translator’s Vorlage, many attest to unique interpreta-
tions of a text identical to the MT. Moreover, the paraphrastic nature of the
translator’s rendering of the Hebrew often discloses what he, and his religious
community, considered implicit in the text—insights that would not be re-
vealed in a more literal translation. The OG of Job is, thus, important because
it reﬂects perhaps the earliest written interpretation of the book and because
it illuminates, on a broader scale, the process of exegesis and translation within
Hellenistic Judaism.
The interpretive aspect of the translation process is especially evident in the
translator’s portrayal of the characters in the book. Early studies of the OG ar-
gued that the translator intentionally toned down Job’s criticism of God and
altered the negative portrayals of Job so that Job appears more saintly.1 Orlin-
sky, however, demonstrated that the ultraliteral approach of these earlier stud-
ies exaggerated the differences between the OG and MT. 2 Despite the lack of

a formal correspondence between the OG and MT, the sense was generally
the same. Orlinsky concluded, therefore, that
there is nothing theological or tendentious in the Greek; there is nothing but
the usual factors involved in turning the Hebrew into Greek: the honest attempt
on the part of the translator to interpret and translate the Hebrew correctly; the possibility
of different Hebrew readings in his Vorlage; and the temper of the translator in
the matter of style.3
Orlinsky’s comment on the exegetical component of the OG is extremely im-
portant. In several instances striking differences between the portrayal of char-
acters in the OG and MT can best be accounted for on the basis of a unique
understanding of the same Hebrew text preserved in the MT.
I will argue that broader exegetical concerns are behind the translator’s
handling of Job’s speaking ‘without knowledge’. A variant reading in Job
32:1, coupled with the Lord’s commendation of Job in 42:7–8, led the trans-
lator to a signiﬁcant deviation from the MT’s portrayal of Job and his friends.
In the OG Job is no longer guilty of speaking without knowledge but instead
is guilty of trying to withhold his true thoughts and feelings from God. As a
result, the Lord’s ﬁnal commendation of Job as a man who has spoken what is
right (42:7–8) is realized in its fullest sense. Job’s three friends eventually ac-
knowledge the fact that their accusations against Job are unjust and insensitive,
and they cease giving counsel. Elihu, who begins his criticism of Job just
when the others realize that Job is right, is unreliable because he criticizes Job
for speaking without knowledge, a charge that contradicts the presentation of
Job in the rest of the OG.
Unlike the MT, the OG does not present Job as having spoken without
knowledge. In the opening words of the Lord’s confrontation of Job (38:2)
the Lord sharply rebukes Job in the following manner:
Job says exactly the same thing about himself when he humbly offers his con-
fession before God in 42:3.

According to the MT, Job has obscured God’s purposes by speaking about
things he was incapable of understanding. This is why the Lord proceeds to
test Job’s knowledge in the verses that immediately follow. The error of Job’s
speech referred to in the MT is not, however, present in the OG text, where
the Lord asserts that Job erred by trying to withhold his thoughts from God.4
Although some scholars assume that this divergence is due to variant readings
in the translator’s Vorlage, the retroversions they propose do not adequately ac-
count for the details of the text. According to Dhorme, the translator’s Vorlage
read t[d blb ˆylmb ‘with words in the heart, knowledge’ and drew upon v. 2a
(‘Who is this that hides counsel from me?’) in order to clarify the signiﬁcance
of the resulting disjointed reference to knowledge.5 The natural correlation,
however, between kruvptein ‘hide’ in 38:2b and MT t[d ylb ‘without knowl-
edge’ casts serious doubt on the existence of the variant reading proposed by
Dhorme. One should also note that, although kardÇa ‘heart’ corresponds to bl/
bbl 17 times in the OG, kardÇa is added by the translator in 3 other passages
(31:29; 33:23; 36:28b = MT 37:1), one of which includes the phrase noe∂n t¬Å
kardÇç ‘to know/decide in the heart’ (33:23). The addition of kardÇa in 33:23
is comparable to sunevcwn de; rJhvmata ejn kardÇç ‘withholding words in his heart’
(38:2). Moreover, the addition of feidovmenoÍ de; rJhmavtwn ‘withholding words’
in Job 42:3 as an anaphoric recollection of sunevcwn de; rJhvmata ejn kardÇç (38:2)
seems to suggest that ejn kardÇç is a paraphrastic expansion rather than a formal
translation. Heater, who follows Dhorme’s explanation of the OG, assumes that
there are additional variants in the Vorlage behind the OG. In his view,
sunevcwn stems from a semi-doublet in the translator’s Vorlage: ˆylmb rx[ hx[
t[d blb ‘restraining counsel with words in the heart’.6 An examination of the
translator’s use of sunevcein reveals, however, that this verb is a paraphrastic

4. TÇÍ ou••toÍ oJ kruvptwn me boulhvn does not mean ‘Who is this that hides me with coun-

accusative to indicate the object hidden and the one from whom it is hidden.

addition in every other occurrence (2:9; 3:24; 7:11; 10:1; 31:23; 34:14). Al-
though rx[ is translated sunevcein 13 times in the LXX, there are no such trans-
lations in Job (12:15 = kwluvein; 29:9 = pauvein). It is far easier to suppose that
the translator had a Hebrew text identical to the MT, with exegetical factors
alone being responsible for his unique translation. The translator appears to have
interpreted the text to mean, “Who is this that hides (his own) counsel, with
words outside of (God’s) knowledge”7—a reference to Job trying to hide his
true thoughts from God. From there it is fairly easy to account for the rest of
the verse. The translator’s identiﬁcation of ˆylm ‘words’ as words held within
the heart (sunevcwn ejn kardÇç) is merely a clariﬁcation based on the ﬁrst half of
the verse. The phrase itself may have been suggested by the opposite image in
Job 8:10, “from their heart they will bring forth words” (OG = MT). Borrow-
ing of this sort would be consistent with the translator’s anaphoric style of trans-
lation.8 The addition of o≥etai in v. 2bb (‘and thinks he can hide them from me’)
highlights the futility of trying to hide one’s thoughts from the knowledge of
an omniscient God.
Similarly striking is the OG translation of the second half of 42:3. In this
verse the Job found in the MT clearly states that he has spoken without un-
derstanding or knowledge, and yet this too is different in the OG.
7. Support for this explanation of the OG is found in Sir 37:10, where one is advised to
‘hide counsel from those who are jealous [of you]’ (dws µyl[h anqmmw). The phrase µyl[h
dws ‘hide counsel’ is virtually identical to hx[ µyl[m ‘hide counsel’ (42:3) and demonstrates
how both this phrase and hx[ ˚yvjm ‘darken counsel’ (38:2) could be interpreted as refer-
ences to Job’s hiding his own thoughts. It is interesting to note that Sir 37:10 (like Job 38:2;
42:3) is translated with the phrase kruvptein boulhvn.
8. Similar phrases appear in other literature from this period: diathre∂n ejn kardÇç (Luke
2:51; T. Levi 6:2), sumbavllein ejn kardÇç (Luke 2:19), and kruvptein ejn kardÇç (Ps 118:11 =
MT 119:11, blb ˆpx). The phrase blb ˆpx ‘hide in the heart’ appears in Job 10:13 as well,
but unfortunately the OG translator employs an anaphoric translation from 42:2 to translate
this verse. The translator’s choice of sunevcein was no doubt determined by the fact that Job
was withholding his thoughts rather than receiving external information and treasuring it
up (diathre∂n/kruvptein).

It is possible that the translator had a variant reading in his Vorlage (e.g., yndgh
‘tell me’ in place of MT ytdgh ‘I have spoken’). But there is no other evidence
of such a variant, and it is once again possible to explain the OG on the basis
of the MT. The translator could easily have viewed ˆyba alw as an expression
of Job’s present circumstances (‘I have spoken [just now] and I do not know’)
rather than a description of his speech during the dialogues (‘I spoke, but I did
not know’). As a result, the OG paraphrases the text and presents Job as ap-
pealing for instruction (‘Who will tell me what I do not know?’) in a manner
that anticipates his appeal for God to teach him (42:4) and highlights the emp-
tiness of the advice of Job’s friends.
As we have seen, the unique translation of Job 38:2 and 42:3 in the OG
cannot be explained on the basis of variant readings. It is possible, however, to
account for both texts as a paraphrase of a Hebrew text identical to the MT.
In each case the OG reﬂects an interpretation of the Hebrew text that is sig-
niﬁcantly different from our own. The critical question then is what motivated
the translator’s unique approach.
It is nearly impossible to account for the OG translation of 38:2 and 42:3
on the basis of what we know about Job from the earlier part of the book.
Given the tenor of Job’s speeches in Job 3–31, it is difﬁcult to imagine what
Job could have left unsaid. In fact, Job speciﬁcally states in 7:11 that he will not
restrain his speech: “So then, I will not restrain my mouth” (OG = MT).
There is, however, a variant reading in the OG of Job 32:1 that plays an
important role in the translator’s perception of the character of Job. In the MT
this verse states that Job’s three friends fell silent because they realized the fu-
tility of arguing with a man who was righteous in his own eyes (wyny[b). In the
OG, on the other hand, Job’s three friends ceased responding to him because
he was righteous before them (ejnantÇon aujtΩn). This departure from the MT,
attested again by Symmachus (ejp∆ aujtΩn) and the Peshi†ta, reﬂects the variant
µhyny[b ‘in their eyes’. In the Vorlage of the OG, Job’s discourses were even-
tually effective in convincing the friends that Job was indeed righteous and
had done nothing to merit the disastrous circumstances that befell him. In
short, they concluded that Job had spoken right. I doubt that this means that
Job’s friends approved of all that Job said. Indeed, in the OG Job himself ac-
knowledges that he has spoken rashly (19:25). But Job’s vindication in the
eyes of his friends would certainly have raised serious questions about whether
Job had actually spoken without knowledge.
Who will tell me what I do not know,
For I have spoken, but I have no 
understanding,
great and marvelous things that
things too wonderful for me,
I do not understand?
but I have no knowledge.

Karl V. Kutz
350
The translator’s failure to reproduce the Hebrew references to Job as
speaking without knowledge in 38:2 and 42:3 also suggests a connection with
Job 42:7–8. In these verses the Lord declares that Job’s three friends “have not
spoken toward me what is right (hnwkn) as has my servant Job.” This commen-
dation of Job’s speech in the MT is surprising when viewed against the poetic
dialogues in which Job’s accusations against God ( Job 3–31) result in a sharp
rebuke from the Lord for speaking without knowledge ( Job 38:2). As a result,
modern scholars attempt to resolve this tension by interpreting 42:7–8 on the
basis of the poetic dialogues. For example, Job’s accusations against the Lord
in the dialogues lead some to assume that hnwkn must refer to Job as speaking
honest words (Hartley) or that the correctness of Job’s statements pertains only
to his claim of innocence and to his objection to the view of divine provi-
dence and retribution advocated by his friends (Delitzsch, Pope). Others who
contend that Job’s dialogues could never be classiﬁed as right assume that hnwkn
refers only to Job’s confessions in 40:4–5 and 42:2–6 (Fohrer) or that the con-
ﬂicting characterization of Job stems from the redaction of once independent
and contradictory accounts of the experiences of Job (Tur-Sinai).9
The OG translator, on the other hand, seems to have reversed the direction
of exegesis and interpreted the poetic dialogues on the basis of 42:7–8, rather
than the other way around. Given the fact that the Lord himself is the speaker
in both 38:2 and 42:7–8, the translator has tried to produce a sense of har-
mony between these passages.10 In other words, Job 42:7–8 created the exe-
getical parameters within which the translator interpreted Job 38:2 and the
related passage in 42:3. Since Job spoke what is right, it was not conceivable
in the translator’s mind that Job could speak without knowledge. He therefore
interpreted the Hebrew text of 38:2 and 42:3 in a way that was consistent with
this presupposition. He was not trying to alter the text. He reﬂected what he
believed the text meant.
It is interesting to note that the OG does preserve one verse that states that
Job spoke without knowledge. This accusation is leveled against Job by Elihu
in 34:35:
9. J. E. Hartley, The Book of Job (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1988) 539 (also citing Fohrer);
F. Delitzsch, The Book of Job (vol. 4 of the Commentary on the Old Testament; trans. F. Bolton;
Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1982) 386; M. H. Pope, Job (3rd ed.; New York: Doubleday, 1973)
350; N. H. Tur-Sinai, The Book of Job ( Jerusalem: Kiryath Sepher, 1967) 579, 582.
10. Such a harmonization would accord well with the translation technique of the OG.
For example, in Job 1:10 the reference to God’s protection of Job and his possessions was
translated solely as a reference to Job’s possessions in order to conform the verse with the
theme of the ﬁrst chapter of the prologue (i.e., taking away all that Job has). After all, Job
himself is not attacked until chap. 2.

Characterization in the Old Greek of Job
351
The literal translation of this verse stands in marked contrast to the OG trans-
lation of Job 38:2 and 42:3.11
The fact that the OG translator reproduces Elihu’s charge that Job spoke
without knowledge and without insight could lead one to conclude that the
OG of 38:2 and 42:3 is due solely to the translator’s misinterpretation of these
individual verses rather than broader exegetical concerns or impressions about
Job. After all, if the translator was sensitive to the notion of Job’s speaking
without knowledge, then why would he provide a literal translation of Job
34:35? However, for the translator, Job 34:35 differs from 38:2 and 42:3 in
one important detail. Whereas the Lord and Job were viewed as reliable char-
acters, Elihu was not.
The character of Elihu in the OG is, to a large degree, shaped by the vari-
ant reading attested in the OG of Job 32:1. As the narrator introduces Elihu’s
speeches, we are told that Job’s three friends ceased responding to Job because
he was ‘righteous before them’ (32:1). The conclusion reached by Job’s three
friends anticipates the Lord’s own statement made in the OG of Job 40:8,
where the Lord tells Job that his sole purpose in afﬂicting him was to prove
that Job was righteous.

11. Elihu’s second reference to Job as speaking without knowledge (35:16) has no cor-
respondent in the OG. This verse was either absent in the translator’s Vorlage or simply
omitted in keeping with the translator’s frequent excision of synonymous words and
phrases or his omission of recurring ideas (especially in Elihu’s speeches). The absence of
35:16 is thus inconsequential to the interrelationship of the three passages under discussion.

As a result, the righteousness of Job is afﬁrmed by the prologue, recognized by
Job’s three friends (32:1), and afﬁrmed by the Lord both in 40:8 and in his
commendation of Job at the end of the book (42:7–8).
It is within this context that one must assess Elihu’s criticism of Job. The
narrator informs us that Elihu was angry with Job “because he asserted that he
was righteous before the Lord” (32:2). Elihu himself articulates this view in
35:2 when he says, “Who are you that you say, ‘I am righteous before the
Do you think that I have dealt with you13
for any purpose other than that you
may prove yourself righteous?14
Will you condemn me so that 
you may be justiﬁed?
13. In the LXX and New Testament, crhmatÇzw is predominantly used in reference to
God’s communication with men ( Jeremiah 8 times; New Testament 6 times; note also
crhmatismovÍ in Prov 31:1; 2 Macc 2:4; Rom 11:4) or human communication (New Tes-
tament 3 times; note also crhmatismovÍ in 2 Macc 11:17). C. Thomson thus translates the
OG in this sense: “Do you think that I have spoken to you . . . ?” (The Septuagint Bible [ed.
and rev. C. A. Muses; Indian Hills, Colo.: Falcon’s Wing, 1954]). But because the OG of
40:8a apparently alludes back to Job’s verbal responses in Job 3–31 (it certainly does not
refer to 40:3–5), the context suggests that 40:8b should be translated, “Do you think that I
have dealt with you for any other reason than that you may prove yourself to be righteous?”
(thus also Gard, Exegetical Method, 24; Gerleman, Studies in the Septuagint, 54; L. C. L. Bren-
ton, The Septuagint with Apocrypha [Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 1986] ad loc.). This latter
sense accords with the use of crhmatÇzw in 1 Kgs 18:27 and of crhmatisthvrion ‘council
chamber, place of business’ in 1 Esd 3:14.
14. The explicit reference to Job’s condemning God in the MT is lacking in the OG.
Moreover, the translator interpreted qdxt ˆ[ml ‘so that you can be righteous’ as the motive
behind God’s treatment of Job rather than what prompted Job’s criticism of God. Though
substantially different on the surface, a closer examination reveals that the implication of the
verse is the same as in the MT. It appears that the translator has attempted to capture an
important nuance that he believed was present in the verse. Job 40:8b can be interpreted in
at least two ways. Some commentators assume that Job’s desire to maintain his righteous-
ness was wrong. After all, no man can be righteous before God—not even Job (cf. 5:17).
However, the OG translator interpreted the Hebrew text as though God recognized the le-
gitimacy of Job’s claim to righteousness. God himself had commended Job for this very
thing in Job 1:8 and 2:3. With this perspective in mind, one could essentially paraphrase
the Hebrew text to mean, “Do you (have to) condemn me so that you can be righteous?”
The answer to this question is a resounding “No.” Just as Job’s suffering led his friends to
assume that Job was guilty of sin, so too Job assumed that his innocence presumed an error
in the meting out of God’s justice. However, as we know from the prologue, God’s purpose
in allowing Job to undergo this suffering was to demonstrate that Job was a righteous man.
It is this thought that the OG translator has captured in his dynamic translation of Job 40:8.

Lord’?” The Greek phrase dÇkaioÍ ejnantÇon kurÇou ‘righteous before the Lord’
that appears in these verses is a translation of µyhl)m/lam qdx ‘righteous from
God’. Modern scholars are divided over whether the idiom ˆm qdx indicates
that someone is righteous more than another or that he is righteous before some-
one.15 The translator adopts the latter position. In each occurrence of ˆm qdx,
the OG translates dÇkaioÍ ejnantÇon/eßnanti kurÇou ‘righteous before the Lord’
(32:2; 35:2) or kaqaro;Í ejnantÇon kurÇou ‘pure before the Lord’ (4:17). The OG
also adopts this rendering when translating the less-ambiguous phrase µ[ qdx
la ‘righteous with God’: dÇkaioÍ para; kurÇå (9:2) and dÇkaioÍ eßnanti kurÇou
(25:4). In Job 32:1, the Hebrew phrase µhyny[b qydx ‘righteous in their eye’
(MT wyny[b qydx) was likewise translated dÇkaioÍ ejnantÇon aujtΩn.16 As a result,
it is clear that the Elihu of the OG was angry with Job because he claimed to
be righteous.17
Because of the interplay between the OG of Job 32:1–2 and 40:8, Elihu is
thus portrayed as though he is wrong. Elihu begins his criticism of Job’s claim
to be righteous just when the OG text asserts that the others came to realize
that Job was righteous. He also concludes his discourse just as the Lord rises
up to afﬁrm the fact that Job is righteous (40:8). Elihu, in his youthfulness
(32:6), has failed to perceive the true nature of Job’s trials.
One should also notice that the OG’s literal translation of Job 34:35 con-
tributes to the negative impression of Elihu. In the MT, Elihu’s accusation that
Job has spoken without knowledge is conﬁrmed both by the Lord’s own criti-
cism of Job (38:2) and by Job’s ﬁnal confession (42:3). But due to the OG’s
unique translation of 38:2 and 42:3, Elihu’s perspective receives no conﬁrma-
tion and, instead, is ﬂatly contradicted by the Lord’s statement that Job spoke
what is right (42:7–8). Elihu has clearly embraced a viewpoint that is wrong.
15. Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible it is consistently used to indicate someone who is
‘righteous more than’ another (Gen 38:26; Ezek 16:52; Jer 3:11). Moreover, one could argue
that being ‘righteous before God’ is expressed in a different way (la µ[ vwna qdxy hmw, Job
9:2; 25:4). However, the context seems to support the meaning ‘righteous before [someone]’
(cf. Job 4:18–19; 5:7a and compare Eliphaz’s nearly identical statements in Job 4:17–19 and
15:14–16). Note also the nearly parallel constructions in Num 32:22 (larcymw hwhym µyyqn
‘innocent before God and Israel’) and Jer 51:5 (larcy vwdqm µva halm µxra ‘their land
was ﬁlled with guilt before the Holy One of Israel’).
16. Passages elsewhere in the LXX in which ˆm qdx is interpreted to mean ‘more righ-
teous than’ someone else are translated dikaiouÅn ajpov ( Jer 3:11), dikaiouÅn uJpevr (Ezek 16:52),
or dikaiouÅn hß (Gen 38:26).
17. This is underscored in the rest of Elihu’s discourses as well. Elihu begins each of his
speeches with a quotation of Job’s own words that he wants to challenge. In each case,
Elihu raises the issue of Job’s righteousness ( Job 33:8–13; 34:5–9; 35:2–3).

The unreliability of Elihu’s words may also be reﬂected in Job’s ﬁnal con-
fession. In 42:3 Job asks,
Although one should probably interpret the rhetorical question in the OG
primarily as an indirect appeal for knowledge from God, Job’s statement also
hints at the inadequacy of the counsel offered by his friends. Elihu and the
other three friends were evidently unable to contribute to Job’s knowledge of
God and his ways among men.
I do not think that the translator deliberately tried to recast Elihu as unreli-
able. If that had been his goal, one might have expected the translator to in-
clude a reference to Elihu in the Lord’s rebuke in 42:7–8 or, as in the T. Job
42:12, to include some sort of rebuke of Elihu at the outset of the Lord’s
speech. The absence of a closing reference to Elihu is certainly signiﬁcant, es-
pecially in a translation where even minor characters such as Job’s wife are sub-
ject to midrashic expansion (2:9a–d).
It is interesting to note, however, that the negative portrayal of Elihu that
can be inferred from the OG eventually led to an even more critical assessment
of Elihu’s character. Elihu’s inability to perceive the righteousness of Job that
was recognized by the other three friends (32:1) and the absence of Elihu from
the Lord’s rebuke in the epilogue (42:7–8) led the author of the Testament of
Job to identify Elihu as more evil than Job’s other three friends. According to
the Testament of Job, Elihu was inspired by Satan (41:5; 42:2) and was not con-
sidered by God to be worthy of grace (43:1).
As we have seen, the OG of Job can shed much light on the exegesis of the
book of Job during the ﬁrst and second centuries b.c.e. The translator did not
work in a mechanical fashion, moving from verse to verse with little recourse
to the larger context or issues of the book. He was extremely sensitive to the
cohesiveness of the narrative and grappled with the signiﬁcance of phrases in
a way that is vastly different from our own. Because the three friends came to
realize that Job was right all along (32:1) and because the Lord commended
Job as one who spoke what is right (42:7–8), the translator did not think that
the Hebrew text of Job 38:2 and 42:3 could be talking about Job as speaking
without knowledge. Instead, Job tried to withhold his thoughts from God.

Characterization in the Old Greek of Job
355
The translator’s unique approach to these verses also has negative ramiﬁcations
for the characterization of Elihu. Because he insisted that Job did speak with-
out knowledge, Elihu becomes more blatantly negative than in the translator’s
Vorlage, and the OG becomes the springboard for even more critical assess-
ments of Elihu in the Testament of Job.

On the Inﬂuence of Job 
on Jewish Hellenistic Literature
Heidi M. Szpek
Central Washington University
Make everything known to your son, 
Methuselah, and show to all your children 
that no one of the ﬂesh can be just before 
the Lord. (1 En. 81:5)
Indeed I know that this is so; but how can a 
mortal be just before God? ( Job 9:2)
And Thou hast fenced me off from all the 
snares of the pit. (1QH II 21)
Have you not put a fence around him and 
his house and all that he has, on every side? 
( Job 1:10)
It has long been noted that parallels exist between Jewish Hellenistic litera-
ture and the book of Job.1 On becoming blind, Tobit’s prayer—“For it is bet-
ter for me to die than to live, because I have had to listen to undeserved
insults, and great is the sorrow within me” (3:6)—at once makes Tobit’s plight
analogous to Job.2 Ben Sira’s search for the “root” of wisdom (1:1–10) evokes
the sentiments of the wisdom poem in Job 28.3 I am struck by the connection
to the language of Job in these apocryphal texts; however, the very fact that
they, like Job, by deﬁnition belong to the genre of wisdom literature causes
me to question how much emphasis we should give to their similarities to Job,
arguably the wisdom text par excellence.
1. The Jewish Hellenistic literature discussed in this article consists of the Apocrypha,
Pseudepigrapha, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. On parallels see, for example, the introductory
notes to Apocalypse of Zephaniah, 4 Ezra, Testament of Job, and Apocalypse of Elijah in James
Charlesworth, The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (vol. 1; New York: Doubleday, 1983). Ab-
breviations in this essay are according to the SBL Handbook of Style (ed. P. H. Alexander et al.;
Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 1999).
2. A parallel can also be seen with Jonah 4:3, “And now, O Lord, please take my life
from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.”
3. An analogy to Prov 8:22–31 can also be drawn.

Heidi M. Szpek
358
In the Pseudepigrapha, Joban parallels assail us in the ﬁrst Sibylline Oracle’s
revelation of the coming of the Titans, whose plot “to ﬁght in opposition
against the starry heaven” will be thwarted by the power of the surging waters,
whose very boundaries, as in Job 38:8–11, were established by God (Sib. Or.
1:320). Establishing the “boundaries of the sea” is likewise essential to 2 En.
28:4 and the Prayer of Manasseh 3 and is said to be worthy of recollection when
contemplating the majestic powers of God in the Hell. Syn. Pr. 3:9. Again, the
Joban scholar may be inclined to seek out a more-precise explanation for these
parallels. Are the parallels due to more than the author’s need to enrich the
aesthetics of the text by drawing on some of the most powerful and prominent
biblical imagery, in this particular case the Lord’s speech from the whirlwind?
Among the Dead Sea Scrolls the same situation prevails. The Master’s
Hymn concluding the Community Rule implores the congregants to bless God
for “His exceedingly wonderful deeds” (1QS XI 20), reminiscent of thoughts
expressed in Job 42:1–6:
My eyes have gazed on that which is eternal,
on wisdom concealed from men,
on knowledge and wise design
(hidden) from the sons of men.
Reading further in 1QS (XI 21–22), we see that language reminiscent of Job
continues:4
What shall one born of woman
be accounted before Thee?
Kneaded from the dust,
his abode is the nourishment of worms.
He is but a shape, but molded clay,
and inclines towards dust.
What shall hand-molded clay reply?
What counsel shall it understand?
Further contemplation by anyone familiar with the book of Job might lead
him/her to view parallels of this sort as being more than coincidental. Based
on the fact that approximately one hundred parallels with Job are found in
Jewish Hellenistic literature, this pursuit seems to be worthwhile.5 Finding one
4. See Job 14:7, 15:14, and 25:4 for parallels with “born of woman”; 4:10 “dust”; 7:5,
21:26 “worms”; 10:9, 33:6 “clay”; 20:11, 34:15 “inclines towards dust”; and 38:2, 42:3
“counsel.”
5. Joban parallels are found in Tobit (3:6 [bis], 13:2), Sirach (1:1, 6), and the Wisdom of
Solomon (7:22; 18:1, 20, 21). In the Pseudepigrapha, parallels are most noteworthy in 1, 2,
3 Enoch (see n. 24 below); Sib. Or. 1:320 ( Job 38:8–11), 8:95 ( Job 1:21); 4 Ezra 3:34 ( Job

hundred parallels to Job in this vast literature might seem daunting if it were
not for the fact that 60 percent are found in the Hodayot and 19 percent in
Enochic texts.6 The concentration of these parallels in the Hodayot spurs anew
the desire to explore the value of Joban inﬂuence. The Enochic parallels, on
the other hand, must also be considered because (1) they serve as an excellent
source for comparison with the parallels in the Hodayot, and (2) the well-
documented (and controversial) signiﬁcance of Enoch at Qumran warrants fur-
ther thought with respect to its relationship with the Hodayot.7
The timeliness of this endeavor coincides with the plea of Florentino Gar-
cía Martínez regarding the main problems facing Qumran research on sapien-
tial texts:
Speciﬁc to the wisdom texts seems to me the acute need to analyse their rela-
tionship with Biblical wisdom compositions (in terms of ideas, vocabulary, com-
positional techniques, literary patterns, etc.) and with the larger continuum of
the Near Eastern wisdom tradition. There is also the speciﬁc problem of the his-
torical context in which these texts originated and their function there, as well as
their function in the Qumran context which they transmitted, in which they
were almost certainly used, and to which they may have been adapted. And
ﬁnally, there is the speciﬁc problem of the relationship of these texts to the Wis-
dom of the Rabbis and the Christian Wisdom.8
Martínez’s plea, though clearly directed at sapiential texts proper, is certainly
applicable to the relationship between Joban parallels in these texts and the bib-
lical text of Job, and the relationship of these passages to their immediate and

to 3 Enoch. Given the range of dates for these Enoch texts, viewing them as a single entity
would be tenuous.

greater sociohistorical context. In this paper, then, I will evaluate the Joban
parallels in these two bodies of literature and illuminate their value with respect
to ideology expressed elsewhere in Jewish Hellenistic literature, including the
ways that this ideology is reshaped in the Hodayot and the Enochic texts.
The research of Schwarz, Davies, and Campbell on scripture in the Damas-
cus Document as well as Kittel’s research on the Hodayot will serve as a bench-
mark for determining the nature of Joban parallels.9 Ideological criticism, as
advanced by Gale Yee, will be applied to the Joban parallels to explain how
and why Joban thought was drawn upon during the Hellenistic era, in the Ho-
dayot and Enoch in particular.10
As early as 1961, Menahem Mansoor recognized the “echo” of biblical lan-
guage in the Thanksgiving Hymns.11 He applied the term “mosaic” to the in-
terweaving of biblical language and style in the composition of the hymns,
which “imitate Biblical psalms to such an extent that most Essene hymns are
patchworks of phrases from the Psalter and, notably, from the Prophets.”12
While no discussion of Joban inﬂuence ensued, scholars continued to explore
the way that biblical passages help form these “mosaic” hymns.13
In 1985 Davies pointed out that the term “mosaic” does not do justice to
the potential value that the biblical passages held for the community at Qum-
ran.14 In 1995, Campbell revisited Davies’s conclusion, ﬁnding it insufﬁcient;
he also challenged Schwarz’s typology,15 ﬁnding an intriguing contradiction
among the scholars who see biblical allusions and quotations in CD as either
“a clever, but superﬁcial, web of scriptural borrowings which can otherwise
be passed over” or valuable for discerning the background and ideology of the
group who produced CD.16 Because the “group behind the document must

have had an origin and early history” and was religious in nature, biblical lan-
guage would naturally have been employed.17
Campbell then posited three types of scriptural usage: quotation/explicit ci-
tations, allusions to the Scriptures, and “the employment of a general style of
vocabulary and phraseology which sounds ‘biblical’ or simply ‘imitation.’”18
Even though the latter two are the most difﬁcult to deﬁne and discuss, they
will be of concern in this study.
In “allusions to Scripture,” the author of the text does not explain why he
has chosen what he has; he relies on readers to infer its signiﬁcance, although
this leaves us with little evidence regarding his own motivations. Similarly, in
the case of biblical-sounding phraseology, we can determine neither authorial
intent nor authorial ideology.
Bonnie Kittel’s study The Hymns of Qumran sheds light on the ways and rea-
sons that Joban passages are used. Although Kittel’s primary concern is the
poetic structure of the Hodayot, she also discusses the hymns’ use of biblical
language. Drawing especially on the research of Holm-Nielsen,19 she delin-
eates four types of “borrowing” from the Bible that, in general, parallel the
categories later developed by Campbell.20 Kittel’s distinct contribution, how-
ever, is a criterion for determining whether an expression is used deliberately:
one can assume that it is deliberate when the suspect phraseology “is not a fre-
quently employed idiom in the OT,” making it a readily recognizable refer-
ence to a speciﬁc biblical composition.21
Campbell’s threefold classiﬁcation (quotation, allusion, imitation) together
with Kittel’s criterion are useful for our inquiry into the nature of Joban par-
allels in Jewish Hellenistic literature. Campbell’s terminology of allusion and
imitation most readily describes the Joban parallels in the Hodayot and Enochic
texts. More speciﬁcally, in the Hodayot we ﬁnd allusions, whereas in Enoch
imitation is the appropriate classiﬁcation. Consider hymn 7 in the Hodayot:

19. Svend Holm-Nielsen, Hodayot: Psalms from Qumran (Aarhus: Universitetsforlaget,
1960).
20. Kittel’s categories are: (1) quotation or allusion that is used to recall a speciﬁc passage
to the reader/listener’s mind; (2) biblical literary forms that are imitated by the use of stan-
dardized phrases in appropriate places; (3) biblical imagery and metaphors that are charac-
teristic of certain types of literature or certain theological ideas; and (4) thoughts that are
expressed in a manner consistent with biblical language and terminology (The Hymns of
Qumran, 48–52).

For Thou hast given me knowledge
through Thy marvelous mysteries,
and hast shown Thyself mighty within me
in the midst of Thy marvelous Council.22
This passage immediately evokes Job 42:1–6, where Job acknowledges the
mystery and incomprehensibility of divine wisdom, which dwarfs human wis-
dom. Yet the allusion in hymn 7 has a new twist. Set within the larger context
of the Teacher of Righteousness, who propounds these words and prefaces
them with “Through me Thou hast illumined the face of the Congregation
and has shown Thine inﬁnite power,” they now allude not to the Job who in
the biblical text has just come to this realization but to the “Qumran Job,”
who is privy to the wisdom of the entire Joban drama and serves as an exem-
plar for the Ya˙ad.
Consider two brief parallels in 1 En. 18:2–3, during Enoch’s ﬁrst tour of
Sheol: “I saw the cornerstones of the earth. . . . These are the very pillars of heaven.”
This is reminiscent both of a question that the Lord poses in Job 38:6, “On
what were its [the earth’s] bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone?” and of Job’s
response to Bildad in 26:11, “The pillars of heaven tremble.”23 Unlike Joban
parallels in the Hodayot, these do not seem to evoke Joban ideology; this par-
allel corresponds to Campbell’s third category of imitation.
Kittel’s criterion for allusion becomes helpful in the distinction between al-
lusion in the Hodayot and imitation in Enoch. Allusion (like quotation) is used
to call a speciﬁc passage to the reader’s mind, intending to evoke the expres-
sion’s meaning in its original context. Hence, the Hodayot author wants the
reader/listener to “connect” with the biblical Job, albeit with added signiﬁ-
cance. The Enoch author, by contrast, imitates biblical imagery and language
simply to create and amplify his story.24
Campbell’s conclusion on the use of scripture in the Damascus Document re-
vealed two additional ﬁndings relevant to our question: (1) in the case of CD,
the author returned time and again “to a distinct corpus of scriptural passages,”
and (2) the passages drawn on represent a particular ideology, in the case of

CD, “rebellion par excellence.”25 Similarly, both the Hodayot and the Enochic
texts return time and again “to a distinct corpus of scriptural ‘passages’ from
Job,”26 namely passages from Job 28, 36, 37–38, 40, and 42 (the poem on wis-
dom, the Elihu speeches, and the Lord’s speeches from the whirlwind) and
occasional phrases from chaps. 1, 3–6, 13, 14, 17, 26, and 30, in which dra-
matic imagery, especially creation terminology, is present.27 The question is:
were these passages selected in order to embody a particular ideology?
Gale Yee’s application of ideological criticism to the biblical text may pro-
vide the means by which to answer this question. Ideological criticism, as de-
ﬁned by Yee, is a method “that understands literature as an ideological
production of social praxis, which itself is governed by ideology.”28 Drawing
on Eagleton (and Marx), Yee explains that ideology, the production of ideas,
beliefs, and values in social life, is borne out in the material world. Moreover,
ideology can refer to (true or false) ideas and beliefs that symbolize the circum-
stances and life experiences of a particular socially signiﬁcant group or class.
This ideology promotes that group’s interests and legitimizes them against ri-
vals. It can also be deceptive, in that it may represent the ideas of a powerful
minority rather than the majority. The potential is also present that an ideol-
ogy will leave some things unsaid, especially ideas that are contradictory.
How is a literary text a production of ideology? The “text reveals some-
thing about its relationship and that history.”29 Yee well notes, however, that
a text is not simply a window into another world, a mirror reﬂection of it, but
rather, “the literary text becomes an ideology of an ideology.”30 The text may

present study I will only treat them in a general way, in contrast to Joban passages.
27. The discovery of the Targum of Job at Qumran (Caves 4 and 11) may lend support to
the idea that Job was inﬂuential on the ideology of the Ya˙ad.
28. Yee, Poor Banished Children of Eve, 9. Note that, although Yee is interested in an
ideological approach to elicit a fresh understanding of gender in the Hebrew Bible, her spe-
ciﬁc strategies for applying this method to gender studies comes after delineating the basic
ideological strategies. Yee follows the strategies as described by Terry Eagleton (Ideology: An
Introduction [London: Verso, 1991]) and acknowledges that her approach is inﬂuenced by
Marxist literary criticism, which has been most successful in bringing together the text and
its social world. I will use the terminology “intrinsic” and “extrinsic,” following Yee’s un-
derstanding of “intrinsic” as referring to an analysis that focuses on “how the text reworks
the ideologies that produce it” (p. 26)—in other words, the rhetorical devices and semantic
choices utilized. An “extrinsic” analysis attempts to uncover “the social and historical con-
ditions of the text’s production” (p. 25).

be “a complex reworking of an already existing ideological discourse” with
absences or silences of the minority or conﬂicting ideologies.31 In the case of
Joban passages in the Hodayot and Enochic texts, it is essential to ask not only
which passages are used to present ideology, but also which are not and to
consider whether these passages reﬂect the voice of the majority. As noted, the
poem on wisdom ( Job 28), Elihu’s speeches ( Job 36–37), the Lord’s speeches
from the whirlwind ( Job 38–41), and Job’s recant (42:1–6) are drawn upon
the most. In our examination of the Hodayot and Enochic texts, the use of
these passages (over against the dialogues between Job and his three friends)
will become evident.
The Hodayot are a collection of individual hymns of thanksgiving, num-
bered at 25 by Vermes,32 that emphasize salvation and knowledge, two themes
prominent in the book of Job. Authorship of some (if not all) of the hymns
has been ascribed to the Teacher of Righteousness, and certain hymns (1, 2,
7–11) reﬂect the abandonment and persecution that were a part of his life,
with details paralleling the biblical Job.
For the current study it is important to remember that these hymns do not
develop a sequential plot line or develop an ideology; they are independent of
each other. Because each hymn is written in the heightened style of poetry,
they lack the components of plot construction (exposition, conﬂict, climax,
resolution) and consistently embrace the climactic level of discourse. With
these factors in mind, we can examine one hymn, the ﬁrst, as an exemplar of
the use and signiﬁcance of Joban parallels, drawing comparisons with other
hymns as needed.
The extant opening of hymn 1 has the author extolling God in creation.
The language used alludes to, not only the Lord’s speeches from the whirl-
wind, but also Job’s recant (42:1–6):
By Thy wisdom [all things exist from] eternity,
and before creating them Thou knewest their works forever and ever.
[Nothing] is done [without Thee]
and nothing is known unless Thou desire it.
In the whirlwind speeches Job has been enlightened regarding the work of the
Creator and the insufﬁciency of his knowledge (38:2). Post-whirlwind Job re-
cants that he did not understand “things too wonderful for me” (42:3). The
opening of hymn 1 echoes these very details: it is God who possesses this
knowledge, not Job and not the author; Job and the author must accept their

humble position. The hymn confesses that it is God who has “spread the heav-
ens” and all that pertains to them: the hosts of heaven, the mighty winds, the
heavenly lights, “the stars in their paths,” “the thunderbolts and lightnings to
their duty,” and “the treasuries (of snow and hail).” We similarly ﬁnd these
heavenly features in Job 37–38.
Hymn 1 continues with praise to God for the creation of man, his domin-
ion over the earth, and the destiny established for humanity. Then follows
what might be called a jubilant outburst:
These things I know
by the wisdom which comes from Thee,
for thou has unstopped my ears
to marvelous mysteries.
The reader is at once reminded of Job’s confession (42:3), with its acknowl-
edgment of the source of wisdom, and reminded of the earlier opening to the
whirlwind speech (chap. 38). The Lord “unstopped” Job’s ears when he re-
vealed his wisdom in his speeches.
The “I” of hymn 1 proceeds to describe himself as “a shape of clay,” “a
ground of shame,” “a melting-pot of wickedness,” and “an ediﬁce of sin,” each
descriptor evoking for the reader the character of Job.33 The author then turns
to a Joban style of questioning:
What shall a man say concerning his sin?
And how shall he plead concerning his iniquities?
And how shall he reply to righteous judgment?
We immediately recognize the allusion to Job 9:2–3:
Indeed I know that this is so;
But how can a mortal be just before God?
If one wished to contend with him,
One could not answer him once in a thousand.
Hymn 1 turns to the most delicate creations, “breath for the tongue” and “the
ﬂow of breath from the lips.”34 Why do lips have such potential? “That they
may tell of the glory and recount Thy wonders,” writes the hymnist. The re-
sponse to these creations again draws us back to Job: “But O that God would
speak, and open his lips to you” (11:5).35
33. See Job 10:9, 33:6, “shape of clay”; 11:3, 36:14, “shame”; 22:5, 35:8, “wickedness”;
7:20, 10:6, 13:23, “sin.”

If the allusions thus far seem too general to be convincing, let us progress
to col. II of hymn 1, where a rapid succession of succinct terms and phrases
make stark allusion to Job’s plight: “strengthening my loins” ( Job 21:24, 38:3,
40:7), “a snare to those who rebel” ( Job 18:9), “to traitors Thou hast made
me a mockery and scorn” ( Job 12:4, 16:20, 30:9), “a byword to traitors” ( Job
17:6, 30:9).
Hymn 1 then closes:
They have cast towards the Pit the life of the man
whose mouth Thou hast conﬁrmed,
and into whose heart
thou hast put teaching and understanding,
that he might open a fountain of knowledge
to all men of insight.
They have exchanged them for lips of uncircumcision
and for the foreign tongue
of a people without understanding,
that they might come to ruin in their straying.
Herein is the culmination of Joban allusion,36 although this is not the biblical
Job who challenged, questioned, and called on God to explain. Rather, we see
the post-whirlwind Job, the Job who has recanted, the enlightened Job with
newfound wisdom. This Job closes the ﬁrst hymn by juxtaposing the biblical
Job with the Qumran Job, replete with all the knowledge that his archetype,
the biblical Job, had so painstakingly acquired. The Qumran author relates to
Job because, not only as the leader of the Ya˙ad, but also as a Jew in the late
Second Temple period under Roman domination, he suffered; he also drew
on the strength of Job to continue.
Consider just a few additional allusions from the Hodayot. In hymn 2
“mighty men have pitched their camps against me” and in hymn 7 “all my
friends and brethren are driven far from me” at once connect the hymnist’s
suffering with the suffering of Job and his friends (19:13). A sense of being
trapped like Job is alluded to in hymn 2: “I thank Thee, O Lord, for Thou
hast placed my soul in the bundle of the living, and has hedged me about
against all the snares of the Pit” ( Job 1:10, 33:28). The physical suffering of
the biblical Job is also alluded to in the Hodayot: “They have let ﬂy arrows
against which there is no cure” (hymn 2 // Job 6:4); “as for me, shaking and
trembling seize me and all my bones are broken” (hymn 7 // Job 4:14); “an-
guish [seizes me] like the pangs of a woman in travail” (hymn 9 // Job 3:24);
“[groaning] and sorrow encompass me” (hymn 9 // Job 23:2); “for my sore
36. See Job 17:14 and especially 33:18, 22, 24, 28, 30.

On the Inﬂuence of Job on Jewish Hellenistic Literature
367
breaks out in bitter pains, and an incurable sickness impossible to stay” (hymn
14 // Job 34:16); “and Hell is upon my bed, my couch utters a lamentation”
(hymn 4 // Job 7:13).
However, the Hodayot also redirect the Joban allusions to suit their needs.
In hymn 2 the Teacher states:
And the net which they spread for me,
has taken their own foot;
they have themselves fallen
into the snares which they laid for my life.
Used originally for Job’s suffering ( Job 18:8, 22:10), the allusion is now re-
directed to the Teacher’s/Ya˙ad’s enemies.
These Joban parallels, thus, reveal that the author of the Hodayot wanted his
congregants to connect with Job, his story, and its rich imagery on a number of
levels. First, the author (and congregants) of these hymns, like Job, have suf-
fered. Second, unlike Job, the author (and congregants), though suffering, have
beneﬁted from the wisdom of the biblical Job; they are like the post-whirlwind,
richer and wiser Job, privy to the wonders of God’s wisdom; because of this
knowledge, they can persist despite persecution from their enemies all about.
They know their suffering is not of their creation. Unlike the biblical Job, they
know the details of the prologue, as well as all that transpires before the epi-
logue. Last, due to this wisdom acquired from the biblical Job, they too can
endure and triumph. Ultimately, like Job’s friends, their oppressors will fall into
the snares laid for them.
This intrinsic analysis of select Joban allusions in the Hodayot suggests that
the author of these hymns, whether the Teacher of Righteousness or not,
wished that in the Ya˙ad’s conversation with or songs to God the members
would relate themselves to Job.37 However, the particular passages chosen sug-
gest a unique ideology informed by these Joban passages. This ideology em-
braces the creation theology emphasized elsewhere in Qumran texts and the
doctrine of dualism. The world of the biblical Job clearly draws on creation
terminology to relate the mysteries of the universe and divine wisdom. The
dualistic notion of good under siege by evil so prevalent at Qumran could be
seen as played out in the very drama of Job. Job represented an inherent good
that needed to be awakened and enlightened by the divine wisdom of creation
theology to ﬁght the forces of evil, the theology embraced especially by the
three friends of Job, Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad.

As for Elihu, though seemingly playing the role of the young upstart in the
Joban drama, in the greater scheme of this drama his words serve as a portent
for the divine wisdom in the whirlwind speeches. Although the biblical Job
does not recognize their value, the Teacher of Righteousness, guiding the Ya-
˙ad, sees Elihu as offering as much wisdom and guidance as the mysterious poem
on wisdom or the whirlwind speeches.
And so, speciﬁc passages of Job have been selected because they embrace
two prominent doctrines of the Ya˙ad: creation theology and dualism.38 But
where might Enoch ﬁt into this ideology? The Joban passages “imitated” in
Enoch point to the wonder of creation in recounting the revelatory journeys
of the mysterious Enoch, drawing on them for aesthetic purposes. However,
when read among the Ya˙ad, given the signiﬁcance of creation theology for
them, the “imitations” of Job in Enoch might have been seen as embodying
the ideology of kindred spirits.39 To the Ya˙ad, the Joban passages in Enoch
may have provided an exemplar for the reader. In other words, the reader of
Enoch was not only to consider Enoch, but also Job, when Joban “imitations”
evoked his person. As such, the mysterious world of Enoch becomes part of the
world of the Ya˙ad, united by a similar association with the biblical book of
Job, more speciﬁcally with its creation theology.
It is well to recall Yee’s warning, however, that, although the text inscribes
an ideology, this ideology may very well be that of the minority, not the ma-
jority. Whether or not this ideology was widely embraced among the Ya˙ad
may prove unanswerable. However, it is also well to recall that an intrinsic
analysis of the text should connect with “the socio-historical circumstances of
the text’s production.”40 An extrinsic analysis of the Hodayot (and Jewish Hel-
lenistic literature in general) does not discount the potential for the Ya˙ad’s
ideology to be embraced more widely, to a certain degree. As discussed in the
opening of this essay, Joban parallels are found within other Jewish Hellenistic
works, even if not to the extent they are in the Hodayot and Enochic texts. It
is noteworthy that, while such parallels are infrequent elsewhere, the same cor-
pus of Joban passages is used: primarily the Elihu speeches, the whirlwind
speeches, and Job’s recant. This evidence implies that Judaism of the late Sec-

ond Temple period embraced, to some degree, an ideology that included
creation theology and the doctrine of dualism. These ideological elements
drawing on Job would accord with the “sociohistorical circumstances” of this
period, which was marked by sectarianism, a reaction to foreign domination,
ﬁrst by the Greeks and then the Romans. Sadducees, Pharisees, Hasidim, Zea-
lots, Sicarii, Essenes, and the Ya˙ad each would have experienced degrees of
oppression in accordance with their doctrines in respect to how to continue
their religious observance yet survive amidst foreign domination. Those more
inclined to synthesize, tolerate, or adapt (Sadducees and Pharisees) may have
still related to the suffering to Job but not nearly as much as sects that spiritually
(Óasidim, Essenes, Ya˙ad) or even physically (Zealots, Sicarii) sought to ﬁght
the opposing Roman forces.
At the intrinsic level of analysis, the use of Joban passages to promulgate
creation theology and dualism is a prominent feature of the Hodayot. At the
extrinsic level of analysis, set within the backdrop of the Hellenistic age, the
Ya˙ad’s use of Joban parallels connects it with other ideologies of late Second
Temple Judaism; however, it is a connection of ampliﬁcation. A modest ele-
ment of Second Temple Judaism ideology (the inﬂuence of Job) has been
magniﬁed many times in the Hodayot and within the Ya˙ad.
The perception that the Ya˙ad embraced an ideology emphasizing creation
theology and dualism as evidenced by Joban allusions in the Hodayot; that this
use of Job suggests that the Ya˙ad, or at least the Teacher of Righteousness
perceived themselves as aligned with Job; that the Ya˙ad looked to the au-
thor(s) of Enoch like kindred spirits; and that the ideology present in the Ho-
dayot, embodied in Joban parallels, can be connected to some extent with
ideology in the Hellenistic era generally may all very well remain in the realm
of theory. However, what becomes noteworthy from this study of Joban par-
allels is that (1) two texts predominate in their use of Joban allusions or imita-
tions: the Hodayot and Enoch; and (2) most signiﬁcantly, both draw on the
same corpus of Joban passages. These details cannot be ignored.
Martínez spoke of an “acute need to analyse” sapiential texts in order to
understand their relationship to the biblical texts, their historical context, and
the greater genre of wisdom literature.41 Job 28:12 asks, “But where shall wis-
dom be found? And where is the place of understanding?” Accommodating
Martínez’s plea and providing the answer to this eternal Joban question may
jointly be found in dissecting the “mosaic” within the texts, not only at Qum-
ran, but within other Jewish Hellenistic literature. While this study was con-
ﬁned to Joban parallels, exploring the inﬂuence of individual biblical books

following the same methodology employed here and then conjoining these
results might contribute to developing at the least a theoretical ideology of not
only the Ya˙ad but also of Judaism in the late Second Temple period.

Becoming Canon: 
Women, Texts, and Scribes in Proverbs and Sirach
Claudia V. Camp
Texas Christian University
When I ﬁrst met Michael Fox many years ago, during some reception or
other at the annual Society of Biblical Literature meeting, we talked about his
disagreement with my interpretation of the Strange Woman in Proverbs as a
symbol of evil. To Michael’s mind, the ﬁgure remained in the social world of
young men and their elders, an effectively stylized form of persuasion against
the dangers of sexual adventures outside the boundaries of wife and home. Did
this (patriarchal?) interpretation suggest that Michael himself was a patriarch?
We shared a laugh at this self-mockery on his part. Certainly he seemed too
young for the role. For me (younger yet, of course!), his interest in my work
was well worth his disagreement. He further honored me sometime later with
a suggestion that we coauthor an article in which we would dialogue about our
different readings of the Strange Woman. I regret greatly that my own circum-
stances prevented this, and thus I was all the more delighted when, in his re-
markable commentary on Proverbs 1–9, he did his utmost to hold up both
ends of the conversation. I remain honored by his close attention to—includ-
ing even his continuing disagreement with—both the whole and many of the
particulars of my work on the female imagery in Proverbs.
I would like to use this happy occasion of honoring Michael Fox to pursue
this conversation. My purpose is not rebuttal but entrée into more-recent in-
terests of my own, centering on the book of Sirach. This book has not been a
major focus of Michael Fox’s published work; nonetheless, in his Proverbs 1–9,1
many comments and footnotes provide a running comparison between the ear-
lier and later wisdom books. A number of these touch on points of interest to
me, relating both to my long-standing work on women and wisdom and to my
more-recent musings about the development of the biblical canon.
Ben Sira stands, if not at a crossroad, then at a hard bend in the road to a
biblical canon. While he has no singularly causal role in the process, his book,
I believe, provides a denser coding of important developments than is generally

recognized. Preceding him we speak of an increasingly written, increasingly
authoritative, increasingly closed set of religious traditions. With and after him
we speak, if only in hindsight, of more or less open-ended interpretive tradi-
tions—whether the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Oral cum Written-Oral Torah, the
Pseudepigrapha, or the New Testament. These traditions have or had their
own various forms of authority, mainly insofar as they extend or comment on
that consolidating and, ﬁnally, fully closed body of written work that we now
conceive as the Tanak, to which we ascribe the designation “canon.”2
But use of the term canon already presupposes a commonly understood def-
inition, whereas in fact there is currently much debate on the matter, espe-
cially in regard to how “closed” a body of literature must be in order to qualify
for the designation.3 I shall take up elements of this debate in the course of my
2. David Carr cites the fact that Ben Sira, while promoting a variety of writings, “talks
exclusively of the Torah as holy Scripture”; this to him is one piece of evidence that “a
broad canon had not yet achieved enduring recognition by this point” (“Thinking Socially
about Canon: Implicit and Explicit Community Paradigms,” paper presented to the Society
of Biblical Literature, 2001). Lester Grabbe, on the other hand, observes that Ben Sira’s
praise of the ancestors poem could be seen as an outline of the narrative and prophetic lit-
erature now comprised by the Tanak, suggesting that the sage had this material in front of
him in more or less its present form (“Jewish Historiography and Scripture in the Hellenis-
tic Period,” in Did Moses Speak Attic? Jewish Historiography and Scripture in the Hellenistic Period
[ed. Lester Grabbe; ESHM 3; JSOTSup 317; Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 2001]
142–48). The Dead Sea Scrolls, though beyond the scope of this essay, also provide prime
evidence, partly contemporary with Ben Sira, of this process of canonizing and may be seen
to some degree in counterpoint to his work. In both cases, the line between canon and in-
terpretation is not yet clearly drawn: the production of authoritative books is still under way
and the accepted rules for their use still being developed. Yet hierarchies of preferred writ-
ings are also evident. Ben Sira studies the wisdom of the world but gloriﬁes only Torah,
while writing in the tradition of Proverbs and Psalms. There are also important nonbiblical
documents from Qumran as well as a tradition of reworked or rewritten Scriptures that blur
the line between biblical text and biblical interpretation ( James VanderKam, “Authoritative
Literature in the Dead Sea Scrolls,” DSD 5 [1998] 382–402; idem, “Questions of Canon
Viewed through the Dead Sea Scrolls,” in The Canon Debate [ed. Lee McDonald and James
Sanders; Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2002] 91–109). Given the relatively narrow range
of Ben Sira’s composition, despite his wider studies, it is tempting to speculate that his sense
of canon had progressed further than the thinking at Qumran.
3. The line between scripture (as a possibly open-ended body of sacred writings) and canon
(as a closed or almost closed list) is especially fuzzy. The historical process has been typically
dependent “upon the pressure of deﬁning one ‘orthodoxy’ against one or more competing
interpretations of faith’; and yet it is still ﬁnally determined not by ﬁat but by “usage of the
majority” (William Graham, “Scripture,” ER 13:142). Efforts to theorize about the problem
include: James Sanders (“Canon,” ABD 1:839), who distinguishes between canon as “the

discussion but for the most part will use the term for a body of authoritative,
identity-shaping literature that, while not necessarily fully closed, is moving in
that direction. We can, I think, speak of a canon-consciousness—a sense that
the number of canonical books is ﬁnite, even if the exact number is not yet
determined; that there is a “list” to which some books belong and others do
not, even if books are still being added. It is in this betwixt-and-between state
on the road to a closed canon that Ben Sira can be located, a location reﬂected
in the ethos of his work.
The question I am interested in is how canon-consciousness emerges as part
of the production of books and lists. My question is not so much a literary-
historical one—hypothesizing developments regarding oral traditions, early
writings, and redactions—as it is a sociocultural one. What I would like to un-
derstand better is how written texts gain authoritative status and, in particular,
how they do this in a largely oral culture. Consideration of the processes of
canon-formation thus needs to be contextualized in a wider study of orality
and literacy.4 In the present essay, I shall take up some of Fox’s observations
about speaking, writing, and women in Proverbs, with an eye to the question
of “what changes?” in Sirach, and what the signiﬁcance of these changes is for
the growing authority of a book.5
Woman Wisdom and the Strange Woman are slippery characters in the
book of Proverbs, and much less so in Sirach. A host of goddesses have been
4. I received William Schniedewind’s important new book How the Bible Became a Book
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), as I was (I thought!) ﬁnishing this essay.
His question about canon formation in an oral context is very similar to mine, as is his turn
to theories of orality and literacy. The historical scope of his work is much broader, how-
ever, and our ﬁndings sometimes concur and sometimes do not. Although I cannot give his
book the attention it deserves in the present essay, I have tried to take account of it to some
degree. As will become apparent, I have found his notion of “textualization” very useful.

Canon I and Canon II are distinguished by their “vectoring,” “the means or mode by which
something is carried.” Canon I is vectored by “some other form of religious activity,” while
Canon II, closed and complete, is its own vector, a carrier of religious authority in its own
right (“The ‘Canons’ of ‘Scripture,’” in Rethinking Scripture: Essays from a Comparative Per-
spective [ed. Miriam Levering; Albany: SUNY Press, 1989] 173). This formulation leads
Folkert to the conclusion that there is no Canon II until the Reformation.

postulated in the search for female Wisdom’s origin. It is difﬁcult to imagine,
given the ubiquity of polytheism in the ancient world, that some reemergence
of the repressed female divine is not at work in the ﬁgure, although I agree
with Fox that there is no intention here to reconstitute a goddess for Judaism.
The questions, then, are why the sages ﬁrst invented and then developed this
exalted female character, what made her effective, and what is to be made of
her pairing with what Fontaine calls her “evil twin” in Proverbs 1–9.6 There
are two basic considerations that drive my interpretation of both female ﬁgures
and underlie my sense that the Strange Woman expresses an incipient ancient
perception of ontological moral dualism. The ﬁrst—and here Fox and I are on
common ground—is that, in important ways, Proverbs’ female imagery is
grounded in men’s experience with human women. Second, however, is what
seems to me the inescapable rhetorical effect of the woman-versus-woman bi-
nary created in Proverbs 1–9 by the collocation of these poems.
Fox’s proposal about the literary development of Proverbs 1–9 posits that
the Prologue (1:1–7) and what he calls the Ten Lectures were composed by a
single author as an introduction to chaps. 10–29, with the Five Interludes (all
but one a Wisdom poem: 1:20–33; 3:13–20; 6:1–19; 8:1–36; 9:1–6+11, 13–
18) added later.7 To what end this latter and highly innovative development?
The goals, Fox argues, are rhetorical, but with both moral and intellectual
ramiﬁcations. Woman Wisdom provides an alternative to the Strange Woman’s
seduction by embodying in “the mythos of a woman” the attractions of “the
perfect and transcendent universal, of which the inﬁnite instances of human
wisdom are imperfect images or realizations.”8 By means of this ﬁgure the au-
thors of Proverbs “insist on an emotional commitment, a desire for learning.”9
Seduction, attraction, emotional commitment, desire. Beyond mere pre-
cepts, the authors of Proverbs attempt to communicate and inculcate “wisdom
as a power” that guards against the temptations presented by sinful men and
women: “seduction is the main (indeed, almost the only) peril warned against
in the lectures.” The antidote to seduction is not just discernment of right and
wrong but “desire to pursue the right.”10 The language, however, is irreducibly
tropological. Seduction and desire may describe intellectual or moral experi-
ences, but the terms are also inherently sexual. It is not surprising, then, that

one reason Wisdom must be female (as opposed to personifying a masculine-
gender word such as sekel) is the need for an erotic counterweight to the “ex-
plicitly sexual pull” of the Strange Woman or female Folly.11
I want to stress here the tight bonding of the discourse of sexuality to the
discourse of the sages’ teachings. While it is true, as Fox points out, that Prov-
erbs 1–9 is concerned with evil men as well as evil women,12 construing the
problem as seduction and the solution as desire clothes evil in female garb.
This is not to minimize the problem of actual adultery; far from it. But the
problem only becomes a problem when men are unable to control women’s
sexuality, and fear of this uncontrollability governs an important strand of re-
ligious language in the Hebrew Bible. Proverbs’ gendering of the discourse
cannot be dissociated from the way in which adultery/fornication becomes
virtually a dead metaphor for worship of other gods in narrative and prophetic
literature—texts that were surely familiar to the sages of the late Persian and
Hellenistic periods. It seems to have been for all intents and purposes impos-
sible to think about Israel’s problematic relationship with Yahweh without us-
ing the terminology of marital inﬁdelity—that is to say, the choice of Woman
Israel to do what she wills with her own sexuality-cum-religiosity. We might
also then imagine that imprecations against adultery in Proverbs meant the
moral sin, as Fox insists, but also more than this. This interpretation does not
mean that the editor of Proverbs was concerned, as were the prophets, with
actual foreign worship; I do not believe they were. But it does take seriously
the conceptual power of the bad-sex/bad-religion equation that pervades
much biblical thought.13
One of the most obvious features of human cognition is our tendency to
think in binaries.14 Even if the authors of the individual poems in Proverbs 1–9

12. Ibid., 259.
13. See my Wise, Strange and Holy: The Strange Woman and the Making of the Bible for an
extended discussion of the varied manifestations of this rhetoric in biblical narrative (GCT
9; JSOTSup 320; Shefﬁeld: Shefﬁeld Academic Press, 2000).
14. I agree with Fox that Proverbs does not present the virgin-whore binary so often re-
marked in feminist literature (Proverbs 1–9, 260; compare my Wise, Strange and Holy, 17–18).
The ethos is not anti-sex, as the erotic poem in 5:15–19 makes clear. This does not mean
there are not other binaries at work, however, the most obvious of which is good woman/
bad woman. Cast in the human dimension, the dividing line between the two is not sex
versus no sex but rather married (= male-controlled) sex versus extramarital (= female-
controlled) sex. This human experience provides the affective grounding for the projection
of female-embodied goodness and evil into the ontological realm of life and death (see my
Wisdom and the Feminine in the Book of Proverbs [BLS 11; Shefﬁeld: Almond, 1985] 228–31,

did not intend to cast the Strange Woman’s evil as a symbol of Evil itself, this
is surely the effect of these chapters taken as a whole, once the Wisdom poems
are added. The suggestion of a supra-social dimension to female strangeness
appears already in 2:17, where the covenant language connects the marital re-
lationship to the divine realm.15 Fox further distinguishes what he regards as a
“pathetic” depiction of the adulteress in 7:10–23 from the development in
vv. 24–27, where we ﬁnd “the strange woman in the abstract, the paradigm of
all adulterous tempters.”16 Fox cautions that “[t]he hyperbole of the warning
in the conclusion does not override the verisimilitude of the characterization
in the lesson.”17 I would urge, however, by the same token, that the internal-
ization of such a hyperbolic abstraction communicates a danger that transcends
all its many living exemplars. The ultimate formulation of a direct semantic
opposite to Wisdom—Lady Folly, who appears at the conclusion of the intro-
ductory chapters—culminates and absolutizes the binary opposition: insofar as
the Woman who offers life is Life (8:35), it is hard to apprehend the Woman
whose house is the mouth of death as anything other than Death herself.
I have reviewed my reading of the Strange Woman as a symbol of evil in
Proverbs in order to highlight the real differences in the use of gender imag-
ery, both for Woman Wisdom and her counterpart, when we turn to the book
of Sirach.18 Here the power of the Strange Woman is markedly diminished by
means of a counteracting rhetorical strategy. Whereas Proverbs magniﬁed the
particular evil of adultery through the abstraction of female Strangeness, Ben
Sira deﬂates the power projected through this uniﬁed image by reducing the
problem to a list of particulars: the ªissâ zarâ who entraps with snares (compare
Prov 7:22–23) is but one form of dangerous woman, alongside the singing
girl, the prostitute, the shapely woman, and of course another man’s wife (Sir
9:1–9). The adulteress is not the mysterious stranger on a darkened street who
cajoles with erotically charged language but simply the wife of another man,

for a model, drawn from anthropologist Clifford Geertz, of religious symbols as nodal points
of ethos and world view, affect and intellect, morality and belief system). Notably in this
poetry, there is no male binary, no ﬁgure of the “good man” developed to counter that of
the evil men. The plural form is not insigniﬁcant, leaving the latter characterization in the
social world rather than the symbolic one, as are the wise men who are the subjects (and
hoped-for products) of the book as a whole.

who might inappropriately join the men in a banquet (9:9; compare 23:22–
27)—presumably allowed to do so by her husband!19
The gender relations depicted by Ben Sira are strongly marked by the cul-
tural system of honor and shame, most obviously so in his instructions concern-
ing women’s shamelessness and the danger it presents to men.20 Prostitutes or
even other men’s wives are not the heart of the problem, however; a man’s own
wife and daughters are! Thus his poem of caution on women begins, not with
the outsider women, but with a warning against “the wife of your bosom”
(9:1), an insidious evil within a man’s house that the sages of Proverbs never
imagined but that Ben Sira magniﬁes to monstrous proportions. The magnif-
ication is not produced by abstraction, however, but, as with the strange
women, by reference to concrete details. The sage heaps vicious and speciﬁc
invective on the evil wife’s angry, querulous manner, her wickedness-darkened
features, her refusal to obey her husband, her drunkenness, her jealousy, her un-
trustworthiness with money, and her lack of chastity—which she will likely pass
on to her equally untrustworthy daughter (25:13–26; 26:4–12; 42:6, 9–14).
Woman Wisdom undergoes a different rhetorical transformation in Ben
Sira’s book. In Proverbs there is a mutually authorizing, dialectical relationship
between the cosmic elevation of the female Wisdom ﬁgure and the positive
and varied human female imagery that constitutes her.21 The female imagery
grounds universal Wisdom in an apprehensible form, while the ﬁgure’s power
and cosmic origin reinforce the status of the “house-building” wife with her
wise instruction. Ben Sira is also capable of envisioning a good wife, who
shares with her sister in Proverbs the ability to add substance to her husband’s
household (Prov 31:10–31; Sir 26:13b). In both books, furthermore, the
wife’s charm is surpassed by another quality. In Proverbs it is the same fear of
the Lord that characterizes the pious man (Prov 31:30). In Sirach, however,
the preferred quality is the wife’s proper sense of shame, which entails both
silence and chastity (26:14–15).22
19. Far more threatening is the description of the male fornicator and adulterer, which
employs the rhetorical style (for example, embedded speech) as well as the imagery of Prov-
erbs’ Strange Woman (Sir 23:16–21).

Woman Wisdom cannot, of course, be silent. Ben Sira thus ruptures the
bond between her characterization and the characterization of the ideal wife as
silent. This rupture ﬁnds expression in three other ways as well. One of these
hints at the lurking threat of female unchastity, while the other two neutralize
the problem. Somewhat surprisingly, there are numerous links in words and
imagery between the depiction of the adulteress in Sir 23:22–27 and the self-
praise of cosmic Wisdom that immediately follows in chap. 24.23 The adul-
teress in her “disgrace” (oßneidoÍ; 23:26) provides an “heir” (klhronovmoÍ) by a
stranger (23:22), while Yahweh, Wisdom, and Torah are the “inheritance”
(klhronomÇa; 24:12, 20, 23) of the antithetically “honored” (dedoxasmevnoÍ) Is-
rael (24:12); those who inherit Wisdom will not be “put to shame” (a√scunqhv-
setai; 24:22). The adulteress’s children will not “take root” (diad∫sousin e√Í
rJÇzan; 23:25), though Wisdom did so (ejrrÇzwsa; 24:12). The woman’s mem-
ory (mnhmovsunon) will be a curse (23:26); Wisdom’s, sweeter (glukuv) than
honey (24:20). Nothing is sweeter (glukuvteron) than following the command-
ments (ejntolai) of the Lord, the antidote to the adulteress (23:27). Wisdom, of
course, is ﬁnally identiﬁed with this self-same law commanded (ejneteÇlato) by
Moses (24:23).
Ben Sira’s neutralizing rhetorical solutions to this intimated sexual danger
in personiﬁed female Wisdom are to masculinize her and to depersonify her.
As striking as his praise of Wisdom at the center-point of his book may be, all
the more noteworthy is the erasure of the cosmic feminine at the book’s end
and its replacement by an ideal cosmos constituted entirely of men.24 In Ben
Sira’s climactic poem, the high priest Simeon in all his ritual splendor replaces
Woman Wisdom as the one who ministers before Yahweh in the holy place
(24:10; 50:14, 19), assuming her sensual imagery of plants and fragrant incense
(24:13–17; 50:8–10, 12) along with her honor/glory (24:1–2; 50:4, 11). Nor
does Simeon stand alone. Wearing “garments of splendor,” he is encircled by
a “crown of sons,” “all the sons of Aaron in their honor/glory” (50:13), who
have displaced Woman Wisdom’s “crown of splendor” (6:31; compare 15:6).
Although Ben Sira sometimes casts Wisdom in speciﬁcally female terms,
“her” main role outside chap. 24—as a rigorous disciplinarian—sounds more
like the role of a father/teacher than a loving wife or mother (for example,
4:11–19; 6:18–31). This masculinization of Wisdom is complemented by her
depersoniﬁcation. Sir 14:20–27 begins with animal imagery, shifts to Wisdom
as house (though not without sexual innuendo!), then concludes with the
metaphor of the tree. Chapter 24 also increases the level of abstraction by re-

379
ducing Wisdom’s personal qualities. Instead of the dramatic metaphor of Wis-
dom being brought to birth by Yahweh, as in Proverbs 8, Ben Sira has her
come forth, mist-like, from the mouth of the Most High. Most importantly,
however, in Sirach 24 Woman Wisdom becomes a book. In this transition
from Wisdom represented as (female) person to Wisdom as written text we
may ﬁnd an emblem of the transition from orality to textuality that undergirds
the rising canon-consciousness of the second century b.c.e.
As Michael Fox argues, the content of wisdom as understood by the an-
cient sages undoubtedly went far beyond the book of Proverbs, beyond even
the larger body of written Jewish sacred traditions.25 Yet the early Hellenistic
(or perhaps late Persian) period that Fox adduces for the addition of Proverbs
1–9 to the proverb collections26 was, for Judaism, a time of books. But books
do not slip easily into largely nonliterate cultures, for authority and power are
at stake. As long as ancient Israel and Judah had monarchies, there were people
who, of political and economic necessity, were trained to read and write. It is
possible that in addition to these practical purposes writing was also under-
stood to have a magical power, although how culturally pervasive this presum-
ably priestly lore was is uncertain. As far as the biblical canon is concerned,
however, William Schniedewind argues that it is not simply literacy that needs
to be accounted for but “textualization.” Whereas orality and literacy may
exist on a continuum of use and interaction, “orality and textuality compete
with each other as different modes of authority.”27
I would like to return at this point to an earlier proposal of my own, namely,
that one crucial function of Proverbs’ female Wisdom ﬁgure, drawing on the
authority of her universal purview and the persuasive appeal of her female em-
bodiment, is both to constitute and to authorize the text that she introduces.28
Evident here are the dynamics of orality and textuality characteristic of the con-
text in which she emerges. I want to highlight two features of this interface:
ﬁrst, the formation of literary collections and, second, the tendency to associate
these collections with human ﬁgures. Both features connect us with the larger
issue of canonization.
Philip Davies argues that “copying and archiving are the very stuff of can-
onizing.” Having been copied long enough for its status as a classic to be en-
sured, a work is ﬁnally

classiﬁed as belonging to a collection of some kind. Scrolls can be canons in their
own right, but multiple scrolls need to be archived: that means labeling and stor-
ing in some sort of order. . . . The result is various canons, groups of classic texts
or classic collections on scrolls.29
The book of Proverbs, Davies goes on to suggest, is representative of this pro-
cess of canonizing. Here “we have an example of a set of collections, some as-
cribed to Solomon, copied together onto a single scroll for obvious archiving
reasons, and stored with the label ‘Proverbs’ or ‘proverbs of Solomon.’”30
While there is some degree of randomness in the way the smaller collections
are patched together, there is also some intentionality in framing the collec-
tions of bilinear proverbs with the longer instructional poems that appear in
chaps. 1–9 and 31. Especially notable is the prominent female imagery in these
poems, which has led me to argue that this imagery was deployed as a means
of providing a beginning and end to the book, in effect constituting it as a
book31—which is to say, in Davies’s terms, a canon and, indeed, a closed one.
It may well be that the “classic” status of Proverbs was the result of a long
history of copying, but I think there is more to it than this, for a second fea-
ture of textualization in the postexilic period is the association of collected
texts with authorizing persons.32 I suggest that this move was speciﬁcally de-
signed to meet an oral culture’s expectation that the anonymous springs of
hoary tradition ﬂow through the mouth of a particular human mediator.33
What was necessary for authoritative oral instruction—both its claim to antiq-

31. Scott Harris resists my emphasis on the feminine as the major structuring device of
the book, citing (1) the presence of negative male imagery corresponding to the Strange
Woman and (2) what he sees as a lack of feminine traits ascribed to Wisdom in Proverbs 1
(Proverbs 1–9: A Study of Inner-Biblical Interpretation [SBLDS 150; Atlanta: Scholars Press,
1995] 157–62). This criticism ignores, I think, the hermeneutical effect of reading the
(MT) book as a whole, with its clear correlation of chap. 31’s woman of worth and Woman
Wisdom. Further, although negative male imagery does appear in 9:7–12, it appears only
in the mouth of Woman Wisdom. According her the role of speaking subject is an extraor-
dinary move for a patriarchal text, highlighting the structural importance of the feminine in
the book’s ﬁnal redaction.
32. In connecting the mention of important ﬁgures to textual authorization, I move be-
yond Davies, who sees this ﬁrst as a matter of classiﬁcation (Scribes and Scrolls, e.g., p. 136).
33. Compare Adiel Schremer’s analysis of “the book revolution” at Qumran, in
which “text-based observance” displaces “tradition-based observance” as the primary
mode of religiosity, one in which “the inﬂuence of teachers and educators increases dra-
matically (“‘[T]he[y] Did Not Read in the Sealed Book’: Qumran Halakhic Revolution

uity and its delivery in a contemporary voice of authority—must have been
true all the more for writing.
The Bible, however awkwardly, constantly personalizes and thereby autho-
rizes its texts in this way. The prophets provide a case in point: the abyss be-
tween their fully oral characterizations and their fully literary appropriation
usually leapt (with the exception of Jeremiah’s Baruch) with cavalier conﬁ-
dence. The authority of Moses, the legendary leader, was likely a tradition of
long-standing at the time Deuteronomy was written, but it is this book that
ﬁrst channels his authority to the written word, an innovation that was then
retroﬁtted into Exodus 24 as well.34 The narrative ﬂow suggests that the Tet-
rateuch was once of a piece with Joshua through Kings,35 with Deuteronomy
later dropped in, in my view precisely for the purpose of providing the au-
thority of Moses, not to the story but to its writtenness. The book of Psalms, of
course, must come from David and much of the so-called wisdom literature
from Solomon. But these later scribal framings are either anticipated or justi-
ﬁed, or both, by the stories told about texts and their spokenness, whether in
the form of prophetic revelation or of covenant ceremonies. Thus text and rit-
ual intertwine in the stories of Moses (Exod 24:2–8; cf. Deut 30:15–21),
Joshua ( Josh 24:1–27), Josiah (2 Kgs 23:1–3; 2 Chr 34:29–32),36 and Ezra
(Neh 8:1–8).
Wisdom literature presents a problem, however, in that it ﬁts neither the
revealed word nor the narrative-law-ritual patterns that govern the other texts.
The dubious religio-sexual choices of its self-ascribed patron, Solomon (for all
his purported wisdom), also undercut a neat covenantal packaging. Proverbs
1–9 meets the latter problem head on—on the one hand foregrounding Solo-
mon’s nemesis, the Strange Woman and, on the other, drawing on a multifac-
eted experience and tradition of wise women to provide an authoritative
female countervoice. Wisdom’s female form and voice disclose the complex

velopment. My proposal here is that one way earlier canon formations struggle with this
shift from orally conveyed traditions to text-based observance is by appeal to authoritative
speakers either embedded in the text or identiﬁed with it.

interplay of the oral and the written in a way that prophetic texts (with their
divinely-called messenger) and narrative texts (with their omniscient narrator)
do not. In the wisdom literature, the scribes who are hidden behind most of
what became canon come forward to show their own faces.
These faces remain at ﬁrst masked by the façade of an older man instructing
a younger, nominally, at least, a father to a son. It was not always thus. The
“men of Hezekiah” who copied the “proverbs of Solomon” made no pretense
of being anything other than royal scribes with literary interests (Prov 25:1).
The book of Proverbs, however, while nodding brieﬂy to Solomon at the out-
set (1:1), cedes immediately to the voice of the father and, secondarily, the
mother as well. Fox wishes to retain the real social connection of Proverbs to
the family setting, while acknowledging that its presentation in chaps. 1–9
may be ﬁctive, indeed, possibly a “disguise” for a school setting.37
It is this disguising rhetoric of the home that interests me here as a mark of
the transition from orality to textuality and its related shift of authority. As Fox
notes:
The Wisdom tradition is self-consciously literary, but it uses a genre setting (Sitz
im Leben) that was originally oral, namely, parental advice, the most fundamental
form of education. That does not mean that these texts were ever declaimed by
the authors to their children, but that this setting is the way the authors want
their teachings understood.38
At the same time, Fox observes, “[t]he Prologue regards the sayings as text that
must be studied and interpreted, not just heard and obeyed. . . . [T]he me-
shalim are viewed as Wisdom literature, not just wisdom.”39 Indeed, the same
might be said of the instructions in chaps. 1–9 themselves, for it is questionable
whether their oral “genre setting” involved an actual oral form. Parental advice
is the most fundamental form of education, but did parents teach in parallel
bicola? Indeed, did even schoolteachers teach in parallel bicola? Yet the family
setting persists.
The reason, I would suggest, is not simply to disguise a school but to pro-
vide the semblance of traditional, oral, family-based authority to the literary
products and producers of the new educational institution. The ostensible
father-to-son oral discourse camouﬂages, even as it manifests itself in, the written
texts. Thus, the dialectic of the oral and the written, so well described by Fox,
accounts for more than the writing down of the fundamentally oral enterprise
of instruction: it represents the more profound movement toward textualiza-

383
tion, vesting authority in books rather than voice, scribes rather than fathers.
It also yields the considerable irony of the written text’s initially acquiring au-
thority by appeal to the family/oral context that it will eventually supplant.
The irony persists in the shaping of the book itself. The prologue to Prov-
erbs, as Fox notes, “regards the sayings as text that must be studied and inter-
preted,” and directs its address to adults (“the wise”) as well as youth (1:5–6).
Yet the prologue presumes the family-centered and family-sourced instruc-
tional poems that both open and close the book (chaps. 1–9 and 31), poems
that shape it as a book and indeed, as I have noted, a closed book. Now, while
the canonical process is one of copying and archiving, it is closure that marks
the ﬁnal canonical product and further intensiﬁes the need to persuade the
readers that authority lies within the text itself. At the same time, as it ap-
proaches closure, the book increasingly demands interpretation. As Jonathan
Z. Smith observes,
the formal requirement of closure . . . generates a corollary. Where there is a
canon, it is possible to predict the necessary occurrence of a hermeneute . . .
whose task it is continually to extend the domain of the closed canon over every-
thing that is known or everything that exists without altering the canon in the
process.40
If Fox is correct, it is in this latest, canonizing moment of the literary his-
tory of Proverbs that Woman Wisdom makes her appearance.41 To what end?
Fox makes two proposals that relate to Smith’s point about the interface of
canon and interpreter.
First, “[t]he book of Proverbs is one precipitate of the primeval, universal
wisdom, as this is transmitted by and ﬁltered through individual sages.”42 This
universal wisdom is embodied in Woman Wisdom herself, “a single principle
that comprehends all sagacious teachings and astute thoughts”43—an ex-
tended domain indeed! Second, the choice to personify Wisdom as female has
implications for the kind of authority that is envisioned for her. In contrast to
a masculinized sekel, whose “antiquity, wealth, and power would make his au-
thority institutional, a derivative of social and political relationships,”44 Woman
Wisdom’s

inﬂuence is verbal, working through persuasion and appeal to affection, not
through exercise of ofﬁce and power. Her power and appeal come from the just
workings of the universe and the good sense of individual minds rather than
from the constraints and compulsions of political institutions.45
If, then, the personiﬁcation of Wisdom makes it universal, the female personi-
ﬁcation makes it personal.
The manifestation, however, is textual. Woman Wisdom embodies the
complete wisdom of the universe, articulated in replaceable but sufﬁcient form
by the sage—best represented as a father—who teaches orally but also writes
a book. The literary instructions of the book may have been re-oralized with
speech in the father/teacher’s own declamation. Within the text, however,
this “paternal” declamation comes forth in conjunction with the (en-texted!)
re-oralizing of female Wisdom.46 Fox argues that the father/teacher’s voice is
not merged with Wisdom’s but is heard in counterpoint to hers.47 It is not,
however, the counterpoint of equals: “The teacher is wise, but wisdom itself
transcends any human’s wisdom.”48 This difference matters, in my view, as
comparison with Ben Sira will show. The anonymous writer of Proverbs—
however much authority he may have had in giving oral instruction—must
offer as authorization for his writing, not only the mask of the speaking father,
but also the voice of Wisdom, who both shapes and transcends the book. The
Wisdom ﬁgure, then, embodies the dialectic of orality and textuality that con-
stitutes the interpretive process required by the canonically delimited book,
both to authorize and to point beyond itself. Woman Wisdom is the quintes-
sential “hermeneute,” already embedded in the text itself.
Once the scribe names himself and asserts his ofﬁce, however, books will
never be the same. Ben Sira represents a new moment in the development of
45. Ibid., 340.
46. Compare with Schniedewind: “even the written word is relational,” and his citation
of William Graham: “A text becomes ‘scripture’ in active, subjective relationship to per-
sons. No text, written or oral or both, is sacred in isolation from a community” (Beyond the
Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion [Cambridge: Cambridge Uni-
versity Press, 1987] 5). “Likewise,” comments Schniedewind, “even after an oral tradition
is textualized, it never completely escapes a fundamental orality” (How the Bible, 196). Be-
yond even this, I argue, is the conscious re-oralization that marks the persistent attribution
of texts to persons in the Bible and generates the parole that is essential for a book to “in-
vit[e] both a sense of plausibility and conviction” (Smith, “Canons,” 299).

canon-consciousness, and the shift in his use of gender imagery corresponds
to this change. Fox points to two developments in regard to personiﬁed Wis-
dom. First, Ben Sira represents but one “decoding” of the complex “mythos”
of female Wisdom: Wisdom becomes Torah.49 At the same time, whereas in
Proverbs Wisdom speaks her own words, in Sirach—precisely as Torah—“she
conveys [God’s] word to the world by her very being.”50 She becomes a me-
diator between the divine and human worlds.
There is, however, more than one way to think of “mediation.” It is true
that Woman Wisdom in Proverbs speaks no verbal message from God, as a
prophet would. She does, however, mediate divine power—more like a king
would—in her offer of life, prosperity, security, and political authority. Her
mediation is iconic—the communication of presence—rather than cognitive.
Ben Sira’s identiﬁcation of Wisdom with Torah, surprisingly, does not change
this. Although we might expect this textualization of Wisdom to produce
text-based teaching, it does not obviously do so—not, at least, in the way we
might expect of a wisdom teacher, with his traditional concern for moral
guidance.51 One curious aspect of Ben Sira’s book is that, for all his elevation
of Torah, he hardly ever cites or interprets its laws.52 Just as Proverbs’ Wisdom
mediates iconically, so too does Ben Sira’s Torah, embodied in precisely this
same form.
This does not mean, however, that there is no content to be authoritatively
appropriated. While Wisdom in Proverbs points beyond the text to universal
wisdom (while also including the text in universal wisdom), Ben Sira brings
Wisdom/Torah into close and authorizing alignment with his very own book,
as the parallel imagery for Torah and his own inspired instruction clearly dem-
onstrates (24:23–34). Just as “the book of the covenant of the Most High

51. In contrast, Schremer cites passages from the Damascus Document, the Manual of Dis-
cipline, the Temple Scroll, and 4QMMT (see also Jubilees) as evidence for “Qumran’s ten-
dency to halakhic strictness and its bibliocentricity, that is, the crucial role that Scripture
plays as a source for the sect’s self-deﬁnition and its unique halakhic norms” (“[T]he[y] Did
Not Read,” 112).
52. One exception to this generalization may appear in 3:1–16, where Ben Sira offers a
detailed commentary on the commandment to honor parents. I thank George Nickelsburg
for pointing this out (among many helpful comments) in his response to an earlier version
of this paper delivered at the Annual Meeting of the SBL, 2003. But compare Jack Sanders,
who argues that even this teaching is assimilated to a sapiential logic (“When Sacred Can-
opies Collide: The Reception of the Torah of Moses in the Wisdom Literature of the Sec-
ond Temple Period,” JSJ 32 [2001] 123–24).

386
God” overﬂows like the rivers of Eden, Canaan, and Egypt, he too ﬂows like
a canal, watering his garden before becoming a river and then a sea. He pours
forth prophecy as the book pours forth wisdom. And, though “the ﬁrst man
did not know wisdom fully, nor will the last one fathom her,” this sage will
“make instruction shine forth like the dawn, and . . . make it clear from far
away.” As Ben Sira’s grandson clearly perceives, his predecessor’s purpose was,
despite his sparse citation of it, to help people “live according to the law”
(Prologue, two times).
At the same time, this identiﬁcation of Wisdom with text effectively de-
personiﬁes her, a shift that corresponds to Ben Sira’s attenuation of the connec-
tion between Wisdom and the good wife. The authority with which Wisdom
speaks, both divine and personal, is co-opted by the male teacher to be written
down in his book and preserved for future generations (24:33; 50:27). The
scribe who hides behind Woman Wisdom in Proverbs here asserts his own tex-
tualized voice and his authority, through his interpretation, over her. To do so,
Ben Sira does not turn to the emerging method of midrashic halakah evident at
Qumran, a fundamentally literary form, but continues a long tradition of non-
legal moral teachings that echo the oral mode, the quasi-oral form effectively
mediating the authority of written texts—his own as well as Moses’—to an
oral world.53
If chap. 24 supercedes female Wisdom’s voice with the voice of the male
scribe, chap. 50 masculinizes as well her iconic quality of powerful presence.
Her glory is transferred to the high priest: Simeon displaces her as minister be-
fore Yahweh in the holy place (24:10; 50:14, 19) and assumes her sensual em-
bodiment imaged as plants and fragrant incense. Although Ben Sira is often
credited with identifying Wisdom and Torah in a new, or at least newly ex-
plicit way, his identiﬁcation of Wisdom with cult is equally important.54 And
53. G. W. E. Nickelsburg notes the similarity between Sirach and 1 Enoch in their use of
sapiential forms rather than halakah as the means of ethical instruction, suggesting the sensi-
bility that, despite Moses’ rising star in the second-century literary world, his unique author-
ity was not uniformly established (1 Enoch: A Commentary on the Book of Enoch [Hermeneia;
Minneapolis: Fortress, 2001] 58–59; see also Sanders, “When Sacred Canopies Collide,”
121–36). I thank Prof. Nickelsburg for these references. With Nickelsburg, Sanders, and
others, I imagine “Moses” and “Enoch” to be mouthpieces for competing constituencies.
My contribution to the discussion would be to propose that at least part of the battle in-
volved the process of textualization itself, with Ben Sira’s willingness to show his authorial
hand constituting a unique and innovative strategy.

yet in each case the apparent identiﬁcation elides a more tensive relationship.
For Ben Sira clearly, if diplomatically, represents his own scribal ofﬁce as the
source of an alternative, though complementary, authority to that of the
priests (38:31–39:11). For all the glory of Simeon in the temple, the sage in
the end calls his readers to his own house, the bêt midras (51:23).55 Through
his scribal work, moreover, Ben Sira hopes to achieve the eternal memory and
honored name accorded to the list of famous men whom he praises in chaps.
44–50 (39:9–11; 44:8–15). It is here—in narrative rather than in law—that
Ben Sira engages directly with the authoritative writings of his tradition. On
his own authority he adds Simeon to the list of Israel’s identity-deﬁning he-
roes—a roster that he also wants to make himself. And for this to occur, his
book will also have to make the list of the emerging canon, his scribal inter-
pretation of Torah taking its place alongside Torah. As Michael Fox has so as-
tutely noted, while Ben Sira’s invitation to his bêt midras presumes the known
reality of a school, in his ﬁnal poem this fundamental home of both heart and
mind is “a metaphor for his book.”56

Translating Biblical Words of Wisdom
into the Modern World

 Of Michael Fox’s manifold contributions, none is more signiﬁcant or of
more enduring value than his work on wisdom literature within the Hebrew
Bible and, more broadly, throughout the ancient Near East. Because only a
handful of specialists command all of the languages in which this ancient wis-
dom was committed, translation is a necessity. In this essay, I look at Fox’s ren-
derings (and suggestions for rendering) of a select group of words and phrases
within Song of Songs, Qoheleth (or Ecclesiastes), and Proverbs, comparing
them with a selection of contemporary English-language versions. In analyz-
ing these selections, we will, I believe, come to recognize the abiding value
and validity of Fox’s insights.
 Before proceeding, I need to make several points that serve to deﬁne and
delimit the present study. The translations of Fox that I analyze are for the
most part not the primary purpose of the works in which they are found but
ancillary to his analysis of passages. For this reason, Fox does not follow a con-
sistent pattern of or approach to translation. Nonetheless, he reveals at least the
broad contours of his preferred method of rendering Biblical Hebrew in state-
ments such as these:
The translation is fairly literal. It seeks to suggest the rather baroque style of
the book (rather than simplifying, as some translations do), and it tries to reﬂect
the quality of the syntax, which is often convoluted. . . . The translation also tries
to maintain consistency in the rendering of key words that constitute motifs. . . .
I do not, however, aim for strict correspondence.1
In conjunction with the comments on each unit I give a literal translation. A
periphrastic rendering follows the commentary. . . . The literal translation is not
on the extreme of the scale of literalness . . . and does not aim at strict English-
Hebrew concordance. It does attempt to render the theme words consistently,

Old Testament; Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1991) 13.

but not even this can always be achieved without violence to the meaning. In the
literal translation I usually maintain ambiguities present in the Hebrew text.2
In my opinion, the description of his style as “fairly literal” and “not on the
extreme of the scale of literalness” accurately deﬁnes his renderings and,
moreover, produces a version that is serviceable in many contexts. In addition
to revealing, as I see it, Fox’s preferences, these quotations also serve as a re-
minder that the term “literal” does not describe a monolithic phenomenon;
rather, it deﬁnes a range of options at one end of what I would term the
literal–free continuum.3
 The contemporary translations that I have selected are broadly representa-
tive of the stylistic and theological options available in the ever-growing Bible
market of today. I provide here only the briefest of descriptions in order to
identify my reasons for selecting each.
 I begin with the two primary translations available to English-speaking
Jews: the Jewish Publication Society’s Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures (njpsv) and
the ArtScroll Tanach. The njpsv, of which the Torah appeared in 1965 and the
last revision in 1999 (with the publication of an English-Hebrew edition), fol-
lows closely the traditional Masoretic Text (MT), especially in its Torah, and
embodies rabbinic interpretation on occasion. Its most distinctive feature,
however, is stylistic rather than exegetical, in that it exempliﬁes the dynamic
or functional equivalence espoused by one of its chief editors, Harry M. Or-
linsky, who shares this preference with the American Bible Society teams re-
sponsible for the Good News Bible and the Contemporary English Version.
 The ArtScroll Tanach, often called the Stone edition (after its benefactor), is
a product of Mesorah Publications, which has positioned itself ﬁrmly in the
Orthodox wing of Judaism, combining a wide array of traditional sources
with very high production values. Its rendering of the Hebrew Bible fre-
quently prefers the interpretations of Rashi and other exegetes over the peshat
or plain meaning of the text. Additionally, it brings into its English texts all
sorts of midrashic material.4
 I turn next to the King James Version (kjv) and some of its descendants. In
spite (or perhaps because) of the passage of almost four centuries, the King

James retains a central, for some unique, status among Protestants. Even
though (or, again, because) much of its language is barely comprehensible to-
day, its phrasing and cadence deﬁne, for millions of English-speakers, what the
Bible is. Although rarely noted, it is demonstrable that the King James trans-
lators, Protestants all, were deeply imbued with knowledge and a keen sense
of the Hebrew language and more than a smattering of Jewish exegesis, espe-
cially the exegesis associated with David Kim˙i (Radak).5
 I have not included here any of the revisions, which I collectively term
“sons of King James,” such as the New King James or the 21st Century King
James, that add little to (and subtract much) from the original. I turn instead
ﬁrst to the New American Standard Bible (nasb), which traces its ancestry to
the King James through the Revised Version of 1885 and its American correc-
tions in the American Standard Version. Its stated goal is to reproduce the
original languages with as strict ﬁdelity as possible; the results have often been
criticized as wooden.6
 My placement of the New International Version (niv) next is deliberate,
even though it is not, according to its creators, in the King James mode. But
it does share with the New American Standard the desire to appeal to conser-
vative Protestants, for whom the Revised Standard Version and New Revised
Standard are perceived as too liberal. The New International Version has, in
this regard, enjoyed unparalleled market success. In literally dozens of editions
aimed at every conceivable niche, it is by far the number-one-selling Bible in
the United States. Along with a style that most would deﬁne as quite readable,
it is not reluctant to incorporate traditional Christian interpretations at many
points, sometimes preferring to translate the Septuagint rather than the Mas-
oretic Text when this strategy is perceived as achieving this goal.7

 The Old Testaments of the Revised Standard Version (rsv) and the New
Revised Standard Version (nrsv) have been and continue to be the most
widely used in academic circles. Although the rsv Old Testament was treated
with scorn by many conservative Protestants on its appearance in 1952, it soon
won wide acceptance among Protestants, Catholics, and Jews. Its translation
team was the ﬁrst—and, along with the nrsv, only—mainstream (that is,
Christian) one to include a Jewish scholar, Harry M. Orlinsky. The nrsv,
which was ﬁrst published in 1990, is more gender-sensitive than the rsv and
tends to be less literal than its predecessor as well.8
 The New American Bible (nab) and New Jerusalem Bible (njb) are the
two English-language versions for Roman Catholics. They represent the ﬁrst
Catholic translations of the Hebrew Bible, as opposed to the Vulgate, into En-
glish. The nab, in its initial editions, favored functional equivalence, but its
successive revisions tend toward the formal. This is also the case for the njb.
The texts of both of these versions are in accord with Catholic doctrines and
teachings.9
 The Revised English Bible (reb) is a product of British scholarship and is
intended to replace the New English Bible, whose stylistic and other infelici-
ties were widely noted. The reb aims at a high level of literary quality, coupled
with a greater willingness than more-conservative versions to part company
with the MT.10
 The Living Bible (lb) was a periphrastic rendering, undertaken by an indi-
vidual with no knowledge of Hebrew or Greek. Its idiosyncrasies were well
documented, as was its ability to attract a wide audience. The New Living
Translation (nlt), undertaken by conservative researchers with linguistic and
other requisite expertise, aims to retain the lb’s distinctiveness, harnessed to
more-responsible scholarship.11
 The Contemporary English Version (cev) is a translation prepared by the
American Bible Society, which earlier produced the Good News Bible. It is an

excellent example of a functional-equivalence version. Although its New Tes-
tament portion often breaks new ground in Jewish-Christian relations, it is
traditionally Christian in its Old Testament.12
 For the book of Ecclesiastes, I have chosen two closely related passages, 1:9
and 3:14–15, that are at the heart of this book’s message. For the most part,
these two passages can be discussed together, because Fox’s primary concern
and major contribution in this connection involves the rendering of a com-
mon but crucial root: hyh. As Fox states,
“to happen” (or “occur”) is the better rendering when the author is not speaking
of simple existence. In Qoh 1:9, the Hebrew usually translated “That which has
been is that which shall be” does not mean that a certain entity will once again
come into existence, a notion quite foreign to Qohelet. It means that types of
events recur ad inﬁnitum. The types of events he has in mind are illustrated in 3:1–
8, the “Catalogue of Times,” whose idea is recapitulated in 3:15. The rendering
of hayah as “to be” could lead to misunderstandings, as it has in 3:14, where the
translation “whatever God has made will be forever” may be read to imply the
eternity of the created world, a notion unparalleled in Qohelet and not relevant
to context.13
For forms of hc[ in 1:9b: ‘happens’ (Fox actually uses ‘occurs’) is preferable
to the other common meaning of this root (‘to do’; that is, ‘is done’).14
 As Fox observes, the most common translation of one of the most com-
mon Hebrew verbal roots (hyh) risks serious misrepresentation of what the
book is all about. Interestingly, almost all English versions follow, consciously
or not, the wording of the kjv at 1:9, as can be seen in the listing just below.
The exceptions are striking: njpsv, reb, nlt, and cev. In general, these ver-
sions have little in common, representing as they do diverse styles and differing
theological perspectives. Nonetheless, they unite here with each other, and
with Fox, to provide the correct understanding of Ecclesiastes’ thought.

In Eccl 3:14a, “l eºolam does not indicate duration, as if Qohelet were assert-
ing the eternality of everything God creates or makes happen; that is a notion
both untrue and irrelevant. . . . Rather, it is a sentence modiﬁer placed as an
afterthought. In other words, it is always the case that what happens is only
what God has made happen.”15

 Fox objects to the usual translation of 3:14b, “and God caused people to
fear him,” inasmuch as
all Qohelet’s statements about human wickedness show that Qohelet does not
believe that God has caused mankind in general to fear him. Rather, God intends
for people to fear him, but he does not impose that fear. By enforcing human
ignorance and helplessness, God occasions fear but does not directly cause it.16
 As Fox notes, 3:15b is a crux:
The sentence means, approximately, “God seeks what has already been sought.”
Of the ancient Versions, only the Vulgate understands the sentence in this
way. . . . It is not clear what “seeking” or “pursuing” has to do with divine cau-
sation of events, but the gist of the sentence seems to be that God seeks to do
things he has already done.”17 
None of my selected versions has a rendering of leºolam in keeping with
Fox’s interpretation. In this instance, however, it is not clear that Fox’s own
rendering reﬂects his preferred interpretation; that is, “I know that whatever
God makes happen will always occur” does not seem to rule out the fact that
other things, which God did not make happen, might also always occur.
 In v. 14b, Fox’s distinction—between God’s occasioning fear and his caus-
ing it—is a subtle one but one that, on the whole, is worth maintaining. In this
context, the ﬁrst observation I make is that none of the selected versions, in-
cluding the kjv, has the rendering that Fox characterizes as the usual translation.
In fact, the kjv appears to agree with Fox, as do several others. Moreover,
“fear” has been banished from most of the modern translations, replaced by
“reverence” and “awe.” But Fox’s observation, nonetheless, remains valid: God
is no more likely to impose or directly cause reverence than he is fear or dread.
 It is not surprising that there are a variety of renderings and underlying in-
terpretations of 3:15b. It is appropriate that a number of versions signal the
uncertainty here in one way or another, as Fox does with the question mark.
It also seems useful to alert the user of a given version that it is the root ‘to
pursue’ that appears in the Hebrew.

The examples I have selected from the Song of Songs are very different
from Qoheleth. Here Fox exhibits a ﬁnely honed sensitivity to the evocative
nature of the poetry he is rendering. In these instances, even slight differences
can add to, or subtract from, the effect experienced by the English-language
reader.
I turn ﬁrst to Song 4:3, about whose second colon, ‘and your mouth is
lovely’ (hwn ˚yrbdmw), Fox comments:
Except for the opening and closing generalizations, all the other predications in
this Praise Song [4:1–7] are nominal and metaphorical. Umidbareka naªweh alone
is an adjectival predication, and a rather pale one at that, in a series of vivid sen-
sual metaphors. Furthermore, the poet, who elsewhere uses common words for
parts of the body, here chooses a strange word for mouth, midbar, a hapax lego-
menon apparently meaning “speaking place” or the like. Both these peculiarities
are explained when we recognize a double pun here. Midbar can be taken as
njb
I know that whatever God does will be for ever.
To this there is nothing to add,
from this there is nothing to subtract,
and the way God acts inspires dread.
What is, has been already,
what will be, is already;
God seeks out anyone who is persecuted. 
[Note: ‘persecuted’ as the word, lit. ‘pursued’, is interpreted in the 
Midrash Qoheleth Rabba]
reb
I know that whatever God does lasts forever; there is no adding to it, 
no taking away. And he has done it all in such a way that everyone 
must feel awe in his presence. [15] Whatever is has been already, and 
whatever is to come has been already, with God summoning each 
event back in its turn.
nlt
And I know that whatever God does is ﬁnal. Nothing can be added 
to it or taken from it. God’s purpose in this is that people should fear 
him. [15] Whatever exists today and whatever will exist in the future 
has already existed in the past. For God calls each event back in its 
turn. [Note: Hebrew For God calls the past to account]
cev
Everything God has done will last forever; nothing he does can ever 
be changed. God has done all this so that we will worship him.
[15] Everything that happens
has happened before,
and all that will be
has already been—
God does everything
over and over again.

“wilderness,” and naªweh can be heard as naweh, “habitation,” an area contrasted
with midbar. In conjunction with midbar, naweh refers to an oasis. . . . Thus the
youth is saying, in playful hyperbole: you are so lovely, so ﬂawless, that whatever
part of you might in comparison with the other parts be reckoned a wilderness,
as somehow defective—even that “wilderness” is an oasis, fresh and refreshing.
. . . Thus her mouth, her “midbar,” is indeed like an oasis.18
Regarding the next colon, “Like a slice of pomegranate is your cheek” (˚tqr),
he writes: “Raqqah appears only here and in Judges, and its precise meaning is
not clear there either. The comparison is more understandable if we take raqqah
as including the cheeks, for most of the temple would be covered by hair.”19
Fox’s analysis of the phrase umidbareyk naªweh is superb, placing it as he
does within its immediate poetical context and within a much larger, and
completely relevant, literary, linguistic, and even geographical environment.
That said, it would have been valuable to attempt an English rendering that
would open up at least some of the richness concealed in the Hebrew. Perhaps
Fox felt that such an effort, as laudable as it might be in principle, would be
forced in practice. In any case, “mouth” is the preferred rendering in all se-
lected versions except for the kjv (“speech”) and the njb (“words”). (“Word”
is also found in the expanded, Midrash-like rendition of Tanach, which con-
tinues through the second half of this verse.)
 Fox’s “cheek” (or cheeks) is favored in several versions that would not usu-
ally be associated with each other: the niv, nrsv, nab, njb, nlt, and cev.
Given the anatomical uncertainty of the underlying Hebrew, it is somewhat
surprising that only the cev notes “the difﬁcult Hebrew text”; the nab, with
its seemingly unnecessary explanation (“The girl’s cheek is compared, in
roundness and tint to a half-pomegranate”), appears to have little conﬁdence in
its readers’ imaginative or agricultural sensibilities.
 In Song 5:8 the female speaker appeals to “the daughters of Jerusalem,” “I
ask you to promise . . . do not tell him,” about which Fox writes:
As far as I can tell, this verse has invariably been understood as a request by the
Shulammite that the girls of Jerusalem inform her beloved that she is love-sick.
This translation is based on the understanding of mah taggidu lo as a rhetorical
question that the Shulammite herself immediately answers. . . . But the adjura-
tions elsewhere in Canticles, which begin in precisely the same way as this one,
are indisputably negative. . . . In our verse too mah is a substitute for negative
ºim. The verse is a request that the girls not tell her beloved how she has behaved.

She has acted in a distraught manner, running about the city at night half-
dressed, and she is embarrassed over her behavior.20
And thus Fox translates v. 8,
“I ask you to promise, girls of Jerusalem:
if you ﬁnd my beloved
do not tell him
that I am sick with love.”
 I am convinced by Fox’s argument that his understanding and rendering of
v. 8 are correct. At least on the basis of our selected versions, Fox is also cor-
rect in his contention that elsewhere this verse “has invariably been under-
stood as a request . . . that the girls of Jerusalem inform her beloved”:

 In Song 7:7[6], Fox (“delightful girl”) opts for a text at variance with the
MT, noting that “Aquila and the Peshi†ta have ‘daughter of delights’, which
renderings evidence the reading bt tºnwgym for MT btºnwgym.”21
 The two Jewish versions, admittedly each in its own way, provide a reﬂec-
tion of the MT, as do the kjv and contemporary Protestant renderings that are
conservative (i.e., the nasb, niv, nlt). The nrsv and njb, with text-critical
notes, and reb, without, work with the same Vorlage as Fox. The inclusion
of a text-critical note here, as with Fox, the nrsv, and the njb, is appropriate
for versions parting company at this point with the MT.

Translating Biblical Words of Wisdom into the Modern World
401
For Proverbs, I have chosen to emphasize Fox’s careful distinctions be-
tween and among the many wisdom terms that are used positively as well as
those that have a negative connotation. Although a number of these are closely
related, they are far from being synonymous. Rather, they each point to a par-
ticular aspect of wisdom, or its opposite, that is held up for approbation or
condemnation. As Fox indicated in his comments on Esther, he does not feel
bound to use the same English term for each occurrence of a Hebrew root.
Prov 2:7 avers, µyrvyl ˆpxw hyvwt, about which Fox comments:
Tusiyyah is an inner power that can help one escape a ﬁx. It is not an inherently
intellectual faculty, nor is it a moral virtue; in fact, many honest people lack the
gift. . . . But the sage insists that God himself imbues the upright with the useful
endowment of mental dexterity.22
In his introduction, Fox renders this term “competence” and “wits.”23 Here
in 2:7 he translates ‘resourcefulness’.
Accepting Fox’s explication of the unique characteristics of the term hyvwt
puts us in a position to criticize the many renderings we ﬁnd in contemporary
versions. Particularly problematic are the two most common: ‘sound wisdom’,
and ‘counsel’ or ‘advice’; the former, because it suggests an intellectual and/or
moral element that the Hebrew root lacks; and the latter, because it fails to

“endow” the upright with a unique characteristic. ‘Ability’ and ‘good sense’
seem closer to the mark as deﬁned by Fox and by Proverbs.
The word hyvwt appears again in Prov 3:21, which in Fox’s rendering be-
gins with ‘let not (my words) escape your eye’ (“my words” is added in the
translation). As Fox notes,
The verb “escape” (yaluzu) lacks a subject. . . . An exordium [such as the one
that begins here] must start with a command to listen or remember. It is likely
that a verse was skipped in copying, and we should restore a couplet along the
lines of 4:20: “My son, hearken to my words, incline your ear to what I say.”24
The proverb continues with hmzmw hyvwt rxn. The word hyvwt is translated
‘resourcefulness’ in 2:7 and is here rendered ‘competence’ by Fox. ‘Sound
wisdom’ and ‘advice’ again predominate in English-language versions, along
with ‘sound judgment’ and ‘good planning’. The njpsv alone reproduces
Fox’s rendering from 2:7; the cev, with ‘common sense’, strikes just the right
balance as well.
For hmzm, Fox uses ‘shrewdness’ here; it is “private, unrevealed thought,
hence ‘circumspection or discretion.’”25 Its connotations in Proverbs (as else-

where) can be negative or (as here) positive.26 ‘Discretion’ is indeed found as
early as the kjv and in a variety of later English versions. ‘Foresight’, ‘insight’,
‘discernment’, and ‘prudence’ all seem on target as well, especially in this verse,
where the connotation is positive. Consequently I wonder about Fox’s ‘shrewd-
ness’ here. Although it is undoubtedly an ideal equivalent for hmzm in general,
because both the Hebrew and the English terms carry both positive and nega-
tive connotations, here where the sense is undoubtedly positive ‘shrewdness’
seems to inject an unnecessary element of ambiguity. 
None of the selected modern versions reﬂects any awareness of the difﬁculty
Fox detects at the beginning of this verse; Fox’s suggestion at this point is pos-
sible, though far from persuasive.

Prov 6:32 propounds bl rsj hva πan, which Fox would render literally,
‘one who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart’. As he expounds, “The
ﬂaw in focus here is not the adulterer’s sin but his stupidity, his lack of ‘heart,’
as evidenced in his self destructiveness.”27 As for the Hebrew expression rsj
bl, Fox comments:
This expression is unique to Proverbs and Sira. In this phrase, leb always refers to
faculties we would consider cognitive, namely, the ability (or willingness) to make
a prudent, sensible decision. Hence leb is better translated “mind” in this phrase
[so Fox has as one of his renderings, “mindless”]—or even “head,” since the
expression means the same as the English “empty-headed.” . . . The imprudence
of the ˙asar leb may involve an immoral or vile act, as here, but it may also reveal
itself in lesser types of indiscretion and mindlessness, such as pursing vain things
(Prov 12:11), guaranteeing a loan (Prov 17:18), and being lazy (Prov 24:30).28
In this verse Fox chooses not to introduce a literal translation, preferring in-
stead the ad sensum ‘lacks sense’. This same expression, or very similar wording,
recurs frequently in Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic versions. The kjv’s “lack-
eth understanding” and niv’s “lacks judgment” are also reﬂective of the cog-
nitive faculties to which Fox points. This is probably also the case with ‘fool’,
‘senseless fool’, and ‘utter fool’ elsewhere. Only Tanach, with its “lacking an
[understanding] heart,” has the literal translation of leb, but even here the ad-
dition of “understanding” points the reader away from emotion and towards
cognition.

 In honoring Michael Fox through this essay, I have not uncritically repro-
duced his renderings of various wisdom passages from the Old Testament.
Rather, I have attempted to put his work within the context of modern Bible
translation. Although Fox is not primarily known as a Bible translator, it is
clear that his contributions in this area are manifold. This is not surprising.
Because all translation involves interpretation, and Fox is an interpreter par
excellence of wisdom literature, it follows quite naturally that he has singular
contributions to make to Bible translation.
 I have uncovered a number of Fox’s interpretations of the biblical text. In
all of these cases, I judge them to be at least probable, often persuasive, typi-
cally convincing. At the same time, I am not equally convinced that he has
consistently managed to convey his distinctive interpretations through his
choice of renderings. On occasion, no doubt, this is due to the fact that his
translations are often in the service of another goal. Elsewhere, I feel certain,
I simply disagree with his rendering. In every case, I marvel at his ability to
combine rigorous investigation with literary sensitivity. This combination is
indeed rare, and we are all enriched by Michael Fox’s abilities in this regard.

The Text-Critical Value of the 
Septuagint of Proverbs
Johann Cook
University of Stellenbosch
Michael Fox can surely be regarded one of the chief wisdom teachers as far
as the ancient Near East is concerned. Few scholars are competent in such a va-
riety of areas in this ﬁeld. In addition to having ﬁrsthand knowledge of the an-
cient Egyptian and Hebrew wisdom traditions, he has published expertly and
extensively on the Septuagint. He is one of the few scholars who actually takes
into account this important ﬁrst commentary on the Hebrew Bible. Hence in
his commentary on the ﬁrst nine chapters of Proverbs in the Anchor Bible se-
ries, he takes the MT as his point of departure but also deems other readings
(mainly from the ancient translations) to be signiﬁcant.1 He actually has a nu-
anced view on the LXX, because “(it) is by far the most valuable of the versions
for text criticism, for the history of interpretation, and for the transmission his-
tory of the book of Proverbs.”2
However, as far as LXX Proverbs is concerned, we have a difference of
opinion. According to Fox, “LXX-Prov is primarily a translation, one aiming
at a faithful representation of the Hebrew, and it is best understood in terms
of that goal.” Later on the same page he continues in the same vein: “When
the exegetical and tendentious features are accounted for and the expansions
are set aside, the LXX proves to be, on the whole, a fairly faithful rendering
of a Hebrew original, and it can be used for textual variants.”3 Thus, according
to Fox, the text-critical value of this unit is high. In my opinion the opposite
is the case. This text has been translated so freely that I would not feel com-
fortable retroverting its Hebrew Vorlage. By this I am not saying that it is im-
possible to do so, but it seems to me almost an impossible task; the main
problem, in addition to the translation technique, is that primary external tex-
tual evidence is lacking.

Michael Fox and I have had many a discussion of this issue; in the above-
mentioned commentary, he also engages with my views. In this essay I there-
fore will continue our ongoing debate as a tribute to him. I will brieﬂy dem-
onstrate to what extent the person(s) responsible for this compilation rendered
the parent text creatively. Then I will discuss a representative number of ex-
amples to underpin my case. Most of these will be taken from the writings of
Fox that I mentioned above.
I have demonstrated that the approach of the person(s) responsible for LXX
Proverbs should be deﬁned as one of diversity and unity.4 This deﬁnition is
based on studies of the way that the parent text was rendered on a micro, lexi-
cal, level as well as on a macro level. As far as the micro level is concerned,
some individual lexical items are rendered consistently, but many are varied.
This consistent attitude did not, however, prevent the translator from inter-
preting in individual instances, even when a generally consistent manner of
translation has been followed with respect to a speciﬁc Hebrew word. Fur-
thermore, this translation exhibits unique features on the macro level. The or-
der of chapters toward the end of the book, which differs from the MT and
other versions, should be ascribed to the translator(s), as should the removal of
the names of Agur and Lemuel, who are mentioned as authors of some prov-
erbs in the Hebrew.
I will return to these issues below, but it is clear to me that this translator
was a creative stylist with an exceptional knowledge of Jewish and Greek cul-
ture. This is observable on various levels. As far as his creative approach is con-
cerned, he made ample use of hapax legomena from the Greek world. There
are also a number of neologisms; moreover, he used a rather large number of
words that appear exclusively in Proverbs.5 As can be expected, he interpreted
extensively in some instances.
This interpretive character of the book makes retroversion to the Semitic
parent text practically impossible, in my view. There is a compounding factor:
the Old Greek of this unit has not yet been determined. I have addressed this
issue with regard to a number of chapters,6 but the others still need to be ex-

amined.7 Because the differences in the order of chapters from chap. 24 on-
ward is one of the striking characteristics, I will commence with this topic,
after ﬁrst dealing with a few methodological issues.
In an innovative book by Emanuel Tov entitled The Text-Critical Use of the
Septuagint in Biblical Research, a whole chapter is devoted to the issue of meth-
odology in retroversion.8 According to him, there are ﬁve criteria that need to
be taken into account in retroversions: (1) Greek-Hebrew equivalents, (2) in-
tuition, (3) textual probability, (4) linguistic probability, and (5) external sup-
port.9 As usual, Tov is extremely nuanced and careful in dealing with textual
issues. The quotations from Margolis (“in passages wanting in Hebrew, all at-
tempts at retroversion are unscientiﬁc”) and Goshen-Gottstein at the begin-
ning of Tov’s chapter are already evidence of his position:10 clearly, he is
opposed to what he calls mechanical retroversion.11 Moreover, he takes con-
textual information seriously when he decides to retrovert.12 However, Tov is
also a champion of using translation technique as a basis for determining ele-
ments in the Vorlage, which we can deduce from his point that “[t]echnique
and vocabulary are the major source of information for the identiﬁcation of
details in the translator’s Vorlage when the translation is literal; but when it is
paraphrastic or free, they are of little help in reconstructing its parent text.”13
A prime characteristic of Tov’s approach is that he regards internal considera-
tions of great importance for the evaluation of retroversion.14
In my own evaluation of LXX Proverbs, including its text-critical value, I
was inﬂuenced by a number of the criteria that Tov suggested. I also maintain
that arguments based on internal considerations are of primary signiﬁcance.
This contextual approach should be basic to a text as complicated as the Sep-
tuagint, even though in some instances external support could be considered.
I discovered a number of Jewish exegetical traditions in LXX Proverbs that
bear witness to the fact that the person(s) responsible for the translation did in
fact use external data. Appropriate examples are the nuanced application of the
rabbinic idea of good and bad inclinations in Proverbs 2 (see my discussion

edition.

below, p. 413) and the rabbinic view of the torat Moshe as a surrounding wall
in 28:4.15 I also think that the translator used well-known Greek traditions
concerning the river Styx that must be traversed in Prov 9:18d.16 So at the
least the possibility of external data should be taken into consideration.
Fox has not clearly formulated the criteria that he used to decide which
Hebrew readings actually represent a different Vorlage for the book of Prov-
erbs. In fairness it must be said that one cannot expect exhaustive discussions
in a commentary in which the emphasis is on the Hebrew text. Moreover,
Fox does mention careful examination of the context as one criterion.17 How-
ever, he tends to discuss passages and/or individual readings without providing
the necessary theoretical background.
With these considerations of methodology in mind, I commence with the
difference between the LXX’s order of chapters and the MT’s. There are a
number of theoretical possibilities to consider when we reﬂect on the origin
of these conspicuous textual differences.18 First, Tov’s view that these differ-
ences result from a deviating recension of a Hebrew text is well known.19 Sec-
ond, it is possible that these major differences were brought about during the
transmission of the book by copyists, who inadvertently displaced leaves.20 Fi-
nally, it is possible that the translator deliberately reshaped these chapters be-
cause of special considerations.
In light of the theoretical discussion above, it seems appropriate to consider
the possibility that a translator who was very paraphrastically minded brought
about these changes deliberately. This is actually one of the problems that I
have with the work of Fox on LXX Proverbs. He never engages in a system-
atic analysis of the translation technique of the translator. Hence, even though
he puts forward excellent arguments in some instances, he can in the ﬁnal
analysis only speculate about what happened. Having said this, I am not im-
plying that a free translation technique should be taken as one’s exclusive guid-

ing principle. As Fox has indeed done, we must analyze each case individually
before drawing conclusions.
I have argued that there is no primary Hebrew evidence that the differences
in order should be ascribed to a deviating Hebrew recension.21 The main
problem in this regard is that the only evidence we have is the Septuagint text,
and using this as the determinative text seems to me to be circular reasoning.
Unfortunately, there were only a handful of readings at Qumran, none of
which is related to the issue under discussion. Moreover, the other textual
witnesses are of no assistance in this regard. The Peshi†ta does show some de-
pendence on the LXX,22 but not in respect to the order differences. In any
case, this relationship is much more nuanced than Fox suggests.23
Another possibility mentioned by Fox is that chaps. 24 through 31 actually
circulated as independent collections that were assembled differently in the
LXX and MT.24 However, Fox rejects this view and argues that the sequence
in the adapted order of chaps. 24–25 and 30–31 is basically the same as the
MT’s. In his view this would not have been the case if these collections had
actually circulated independently.
I need not repeat my arguments in detail that the translator indeed brought
about these changes deliberately. In short, 31:1–9 was moved by the translator
in order to place 31:10 adjacent to 29:27 for purposes of contrast. In this way
the translator deliberately contrasts an unjust man (ajnh;r aßdikoÍ) with a coura-
geous wife (guna∂ka ajndreÇan). Fox disagrees with my interpretation;25 how-
ever, the point that he does not take into account is that this is indeed in line
with the translator’s general approach to create contrasts even where there are
none in the Hebrew text. I have actually deﬁned this as a translation technique
by this translator in the Festschrift for James Sanders.26 One relevant example
must sufﬁce.
In Prov 11:7 the Hebrew contains no contrast. The Hebrew mentions only
the wicked and the godless (synonyms), whereas the LXX changes the wicked
man ([vr µda) to a righteous (ajndro;Í dikaÇou) one.

tween the LXX and Peshi†ta ( Johann Cook, “On the Relationship between the Peshi†ta

The inclusion of the negative particle oujk, which has no equivalent in the He-
brew, is another deliberate endeavor to interpret this passage. In v. 16 in the
same chapter another contrast appears in the Greek without an equivalent in
the Hebrew and should also be taken to have been introduced by the transla-
tor.27 As a matter of fact, similar creations are found throughout this book. In
these cases it is not possible to reconstruct an underlying Semitic text.
In the passages under discussion, other adaptations were brought about by
the translator on account of thematic considerations. Prov 29:27 and 31:10
were aligned because in the context of both passages the theme is the king.
Fox seems to agree to some extent with my interpretation but argues that it is
difﬁcult to be certain that it was done by a Hebrew scribe rather than a later
Greek copyist.28
Finally, looking at the book as a whole and not just at individual verses and
lexemes, it is clear to me that these differences in order should be ascribed to a
creative translator. In the Festschrift for Tov, I conceded that not all of the dif-
ferences seem to ﬁt this picture.29 This applies to the beginning of Proverbs 30,
which is not as clear-cut as the other examples. However, chap. 30 does contain
one interpretation: the name Agur is deliberately removed. On this issue I ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to understand Fox’s position. On the one hand, he concedes that
these changes are the result of deliberate adaptations: Agur and Lemuel “were
contorted midrashically [sic].”30 On the other hand, he maintains that it is pos-
sible and indeed necessary to reconstruct the Vorlage. The most that I would
be willing to argue in this instance is that the Hebrew text from which this
translation was made actually did not differ extensively from the MT.31

The Text-Critical Value of the Septuagint of Proverbs
413
The LXX of Proverbs contains numerous examples of additions that had no
equivalent in the translator’s Vorlage. To determine the origin of these addi-
tions is a complicated matter. The rules of thumb formulated by de Lagarde
are helpful, but they need to be applied circumspectly.32
Some of these larger additions appear in connection with the strange
woman, for whom the translator followed a rather interpretive and, I would
argue, a systematic mode of translation.33 In his systematic dealing with this
strange woman, the translator commences in 2:16–20 and ends in chap. 9.34
The addition of u¥ev mhv se katalavb¬ kakh; boulh; ‘My son do not let bad
counsel overtake you’ in Prov 2:17 has no equivalent in Hebrew and repre-
sents an interpretation. Hengel understood this “bad counsel” as a reference
to a contemporary “evil counsel,” namely, Hellenistic wisdom.35 I concur
with this point of view,36 and to me the primary argument is the fact that the
Greek concept kakh; boulh; actually represents the rabbinic concept of the
[rh rxy. I have argued that in v. 11 the counterpart of this bad counsel (i.e.,
‘good counsel’ bwfh rxy)—at least the adjective kalh;—has been deliberately
added by the translator.37 Fox disagrees with my metaphorical interpretation,
and he prefers to understand this addition internally from the perspective of
the chapter as a whole.38 The “internal approach” can certainly not be faulted;
however, I do not ﬁnd his counterarguments compelling. For instance, I do
not think that Ben Sira can explain what the inclinations here in Proverbs ac-
tually mean, because Ben Sira refers to only one of these inclinations and does
not distinguish between the two mentioned above. This was a development
that came later in Judaism. I would not expect the translator to have closely
similar views on, for example, the evil inclination, as Fox does. I accept the
fact that, even though the translator used known exegetical traditions, he in
fact interpreted creatively and hence created an additional level of abstraction.

33. This represents another of the differences between my view and Fox’s. He ﬁnds evi-

As far as the issue of the retroverting of this passage (and more speciﬁcally, the
additions) are concerned, I therefore argue that it was the result of interpreta-
tion by the translator and not of a differing parent text.
Fox’s and my different stances become clearest in our divergent interpreta-
tions of the large additions to Proverbs 9. I agree with Fox that the Hebrew
text already was an expanded text; however, this has no bearing on the LXX,
because I think that the person(s) responsible for chap. 9 had a Hebrew text
similar to the MT. Hence, I argue that all of the added passages are to be as-
cribed to the translator. All of the Greek words in these pluses were indeed part
of the general vocabulary of LXX Proverbs.39 Both sets of pluses, moreover,
are aimed at contrasting the wise and the foolish. In the ﬁrst set of pluses the
translator depicted the foolish by, for example, applying farming terminology.
Fox, on the other hand, ﬁnds three strata of development: “(1) the earlier,
leaner text, maintained in the MT, (2) the addition with a Hebrew source,
12a–12b, and (3) further augmentations in Greek (12c [?] and 18a–18d).”40 As
I have stated already, we are lacking clearly formulated criteria by Fox. How-
ever, as will become clear, he and I do not differ dramatically as far as the issue
of interpretation in the LXX is concerned but with regard to the possible Vor-
lage. Fox does suggest the retroversion of some Greek passages into Hebrew.
The ﬁrst concerns the additions to v. 12, beginning with 9:12a:
o¶Í ejreÇdetai ejpµ yeuvdesin ou•toÍ poimane∂ ajnevmouÍ
oJ d∆ aujto;Í di∫xetai oßrnea petovmena
He who relies on deceits—he will shepherd the winds.
Such a one will pursue a ﬂying bird.
The following retroversion is suggested by Fox:41
tppw[m rwpx πwdryw twr h[ry rqç ˚mwt
He who grasps deceit he will shepherd winds and he will pursue a ﬂying bird.
I do not understand why Fox has reconstructed ajnevmouÍ as twr. I presume this
is a printing error, because jwr ﬁts the picture. With this adjustment, it is
surely possible to reconstruct the Greek to the Hebrew phrase above. All the
lexemes appear in the book of Proverbs. However, methodologically, this can
hardly be used as primary evidence.
The second addition is 9:12b.

For he has abandoned the roads of his own vineyard,

The retroversion reads:
h[f whdç ylg[mw wmrk ykrd bz[ yk
For he has abandoned the ways of his vineyard and has neglected the axles of his
ﬁeld.
This reconstruction is a theoretical possibility as far as most of the lexemes
are concerned, such as lg[m, which appears in Prov 2:9, 15, 18; 4:11, 26; 5:6,
and 21. However, there is one conspicuous exception: h[f does not appear in
Proverbs and found only in Ezek 13:10. Fox has an ingenious argument from
the Aramaic language. First he considers aßxonaÍ (as in Prov 2:9, 18) to be an
etymologizing translation of ylg[m (or twlg[m) and understands it as ‘axles’,
speciﬁcally (pars pro toto) ‘wagon’. According to him, this word is one indica-
tion of a different Hebrew Vorlage; so is the awkward phrase peplavnhtai +
accusative, which he feels also indirectly reveals a Hebrew origin. In order to
explain the problem surrounding h[f, he refers to Aramaic y[f + accusative,
which means ‘forget, neglect’. Consequently, he thinks that the Vorlage must
have been ylg[m h[f, which resulted from the more-natural h[f ylg[mm ‘stray
from’ by haplography.
It is certainly acceptable to revert to Aramaic in an endeavor to understand
problematic Hebrew passages in Proverbs. However, as in the case of the dif-
ferences in the order of chapters, the problem is that there is unfortunately no
primary evidence that this Semitic parent text indeed existed. Hence this in-
terpretation can at most be regarded as a creative possibility. To me, a better
and more elegant solution is to accept the fact that the whole Greek phrase
comes from the hand of the translator, who deemed it necessary to interpret
because of his speciﬁc religiopolitical context.42
The second set of additions, in v. 18, can also in my view be ascribed to the
translator. Fox ascertains that it is impossible to be decisive about the origin of
this addition.43 In the ﬁnal analysis he uses an external datum, the fact that this
passage was apparently aimed at the diaspora community, for concluding that
it was composed in Greek. According to him, however, this composition was
made by an “inner-Greek glossator.”44

416
Again, it appears that the disagreement between Fox and me is not exten-
sive, even though we differ on the details. He considers the addition to be
based on allegorical exegesis. The foreignness that predominates in these pas-
sages is treated as foreign culture or, more generally, as the experience of life
in foreign lands. Where we do indeed differ rather extensively is that he has an
overtly literalistic understanding of these passages, whereas I interpret them
only symbolically, as a reference to foreign wisdom.45 The interpretations of
course have little bearing on the issue of retroversion, except of course that I
discern no Hebrew Vorlage in these instances. As should be abundantly clear,
I am not convinced by the arguments put forward by Fox in this regard. This
also applies to some extent to his interpretation of individual readings.
As I have stated above, it is necessary to deal with each case as objectively
as possible. For the record, I must state that I do not regard all retroversions to
Semitic parent texts to be impossible. In individual cases it is possible, for ex-
ample, to relate a Greek word directly and unequivocally to a Hebrew word
that was understood differently without vowels. Two examples must sufﬁce,
even though similar examples abound in this section.
In Prov 10:15, the Hebrew noun µvyr ‘poor’ is translated ‘the impious’.
Clearly the interpretation is based on a different reading of the Hebrew. The
same applies to Prov 19:6, which contains a reference to kings instead of the
generous. In addition, the noun [rh ‘friend’ is connected with ‘an evil per-
son’. The point to make in these instances is that it is possible to refer to an
existing Semitic text that is not just a hypothetical possibility.
Returning to the issue of individual cases for the purposes of this contribu-
tion, I will be discussing a small number of examples only. Fox argues that the
reading ajreth; instead of ajrch; that appears in A of 1:7 actually came from a
different Hebrew Vorlage that did not have the word tyvar ‘beginning’.46 I
suppose this is possible; however, I maintain that the translator actually inter-
preted in this instance. I would put forward the same argument (contrary to
Fox) with respect to v. 12b, which seems to be a quotation from Ps 34[33]:17b
and/or 109[108]:15b. Hence I have argued that aßrein is an exegetical render-
ing introduced in connection with µmt.47 I think Fox is correct in the third
example, from 1:21, in arguing that the Vorlage had twmj or twymj and not
t/YmIhø. He refers to convincing extrabiblical cognates from Amarna, Ugaritic,
and Phoenician in this regard.48

The Text-Critical Value of the Septuagint of Proverbs
417
As I stated above, Fox holds a nuanced view on the issue of retroversion in
some instances. He is well aware of the fact that retroverting the parent text of
the LXX is a highly problematic issue. In connection with 2:19, which has
three strophes in comparison with the MT’s two, he concedes that it is difﬁ-
cult (impossible) to reconstruct this third strophe.49 He is also open minded
enough to accept the fact that the translator indeed interpreted freely in some
cases. In Prov 3:9 the LXX has two signiﬁcant additions compared with the
MT: ‘your just (sΩn dikaÇwn) labors’ and ‘your ﬁrstfruits of righteousness’ (dikai-
osuvnhÍ). He correctly concludes that these additions are the work of the
translator and points out that “the translator is paraphrastic and moralistic,
teaching that you may honor God only from honest earning.”50 The differ-
ence between my position and his is that I have demonstrated that this trans-
lator consistently used what I have called “religionizing” terminology.51 In
these instances it is not proﬁtable to seek for possible underlying parent texts.
In Prov 3:16 Fox follows Tov’s retroversion of the two added strophes.52
He correctly indicates that the second strophe is based on Prov 31:26[25]. I am
not convinced, however, that the Greek actually shows an afﬁnity with the
Hebrew rather than with the Greek in that passage and that therefore the cou-
plet stems from a Hebrew Vorlage. What Tov and Fox failed to observe is that
there is also a relationship of sorts between Prov 31:25 and 28, witnessing to
intratextual activity in the Greek. Moreover, 3:16 does not agree in detail
with the Hebrew of 31:26, which reads:
hnwvl l[ dsj trwtw hmkjb hjtp hyp
She opens her mouth with wisdom
and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
The Greek of 3:16a reads:
ejk touÅ stovmatoÍ aujthÅÍ ejkporeuvetai dikaiosuvnh
novmon de; kaµ eßleon ejpµ gl∫sshÅÍ fore∂
Out of her mouth righteousness comes forth,
and she carries law and mercy upon the tongue.
To me it is clear that the translator is here interpreting, or as I argued earlier,
religionizing. He interprets wisdom as a religious category, ‘righteousness’

418
(seen this way, it is not necessary to revert to Isa 45:23a, as Fox does), and then
he uses two more religious terms, law and mercy, which are taken from the
Hebrew (dsj trwtw). The interpretation of two categories occurs elsewhere in
Proverbs; for instance, in 6:23, where the opposite process took place, and the
two Hebrew words hrwtw hwxm are interpreted as a genitive construction (ejn-
tolh; novmou). This is in line with what this translator usually does, as in 31:25,
where wisdom is interpreted as prosecovntwÍ kaµ ejnnovmwÍ ‘cautiously and le-
gally’, also based on dsj trwtw. A similar trend is followed in v. 28, where wis-
dom is rendered sof∫Í kaµ nomoqevsmwÍ ‘wisely and lawfully’. The point is
that this translator is interpreting in these cases. I would therefore argue that
the translator is responsible for these interpretations and that they are not the
result of a different parent text.
I think that the same argument could be put forward to account for the ad-
dition that appears in 3:22a. I agree with Fox that it is based on v. 8; however,
in my view there is no indisputable evidence that the Greek actually is the re-
sult of a different Hebrew text. To me it seems clear that the translator is re-
sponsible for this addition. The difference in the Greek wording is typical of
the creativeness of this translator. Instead of the particle tovte he used de;, and
savrx is used for s∫ma. It is difﬁcult to make a ﬁnal decision, because of the
limited use of these nouns in the book of Proverbs. The noun savrx is used in
Prov 3:22 (-); 4:22 (rcb); 5:11 (rcb); and 26:10 (-). In two instances it is an
addition, and in the other two cases it represents the noun rcb. The word
s∫ma also appears in a few instances only in Proverbs: in 3:8 (-); 5:11 (rav);
11:17 (rav); and 25:20 (-). It is signiﬁcant that in 5:11 the two nouns are re-
lated to one another. In Hebrew the relationship is paratactic (˚ravw ˚rcb),
whereas in the LXX a genitive construction is the result (savrkeÍ s∫matovÍ
sou). As I have demonstrated above, this translator often interprets grammar
freely. In the ﬁnal analysis I think it is more likely that the difference in word-
ing was deliberately brought about by the translator.
From the above it should be clear just how skeptical I am of retroversions
in LXX Proverbs. In practically all of the instances discussed by Fox (and some
by Tov), I have put forward internal arguments that obviate or at least rela-
tivize the search for underlying Semitic texts. As I have demonstrated abun-
dantly, because of the rather free way that this translator approached his parent
text, I am compelled to retain this view. Due to the lack of primary textual
evidence, there are unfortunately too many uncertainties. What is needed are
clear-cut retroverting criteria in each case, such as the criteria formulated by
Tov; yet, as I demonstrated above, even these need to be handled carefully. I
have decided to use the translation technique followed by the translator as a
determining principle. The fact that this person interpreted extensively seems

The Text-Critical Value of the Septuagint of Proverbs
419
to be an appropriate guideline. Many, if not all, of the differences between the
MT and the LXX that I discussed above can be considered interpretation.
I want to make it clear, ﬁnally, that the retroversion of parent texts as sug-
gested by Fox and Tov is, in principle, a laudable and legitimate exercise. I have
made extensive use of this principle in my research of the Septuagint version of
Genesis, where there is fortunately some external textual evidence available in
the Dead Sea Scrolls.53 It should, however, be remembered that the person(s)
responsible for Genesis had a different attitude toward the parent text from the
attitude of the translator of LXX Proverbs. It should therefore be clear that I
regard the text-critical value of LXX Proverbs as extremely low.

Christian Aramaism: 
The Birth and Growth of Aramaic Scholarship 
in the Sixteenth Century
Stephen G. Burnett
University of Nebraska–Lincoln
Since the mid-nineteenth century, Jewish historians have marveled at the
vigorous growth and vitality of Christian Hebrew scholarship in early modern
Europe. Ludwig Geiger and Moritz Steinschneider chronicled parts of this
astonishing and unexpected phenomenon.1 During the past 50 years, Karl-
heinz Burmeister, R. Gerald Hobbs, Bernard Roussel, Gerard Weil, and Je-
rome Friedman have provided biographies and analyses of the achievements of
some of the most important Christian and Jewish scholars who made this pos-
sible.2 In my own research I have sought to quantify the growth of Hebrew
learning among Christians through analyzing the Christian Hebrew printing
industry as it developed. To honor my teacher Michael V. Fox, however, I
wish to write, not on Christian Hebraism, but on the growth of Aramaic
learning among Christians during the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries.3 The
Christian study of Aramaic literature illustrates even more sharply than Chris-
tian Hebraism the religious and philological barriers that hindered the study of
Jewish literature by non-Jews and the often-surprising ways that these barriers
were surmounted.4

Stephen G. Burnett
422
Postbiblical Aramaic literature was forbidding to the would-be Christian
reader for a number of reasons. First, it was fundamentally Jewish literature.
Christians could justify the study of Biblical Hebrew and the Hebrew Bible
text because the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) was a part of their own bibli-
cal canon. Biblical humanists and theologians, Protestant and Catholics alike,
could point to St. Jerome, Nicholas of Lyra, Paul of Burgos, and other prede-
cessors in the Christian study of Hebrew. Jewish Aramaic literature, however,
included the Targums, the Talmud, and the Zohar, all of which had been
written by Jews for Jews after the close of the New Testament canon. Assum-
ing Christian scholars could overcome the religious barrier, very few of them
were able to overcome the lack of Latin-language Aramaic grammars and lex-
icons and the rarity of the texts themselves. While the patronage of secular or
church ofﬁcials could and did enable Christian Aramaists to make impressive
strides, the assistance of Jewish converts and professing Jews was essential for
the growth of this new ﬁeld. By 1600, Aramaic study had found a home
within the world of Christian learning, as attested both by the number of
Aramaic-related titles printed and also by the Aramaic library holdings of both
individual scholars and universities.
Why should Christians devote time to reading Jewish Aramaic books?
During the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth centuries, such Christian Aramaic learn-
ing as existed was largely devoted to anti-Jewish polemics or proselytizing.
The Christians scholars who pursued it, many of them Jewish converts,
combed the Talmud, kabbalistic literature, and the Targums for passages that
appeared to support Christian doctrines and perspectives.5 The theological
need to use Jewish Aramaic texts for Christian polemics was sufﬁcient motiva-
tion for a few scholars to devote themselves to the study of Aramaic, but only
a few. Only when Christian scholars came to believe that these texts could
beneﬁt Christian theology and academic life in a constructive way by provid-
ing information useful to Christians would Aramaic literature ﬁnd a larger
niche within the Christian world of learning.6

382–83.

Christian Aramaism: Aramaic Scholarship in the Sixteenth Century
423
For Christian scholars, ﬁnding a satisfactory motive for studying Aramaic
literature was simpler for some genres than for others. By the late ﬁfteenth cen-
tury, the Christian case for Targumic study had long been clear. Not only had
polemicists such as Raymundo Marti found the Targums useful, but so had
biblical commentators. Nicholas of Lyra, for example, discovered that the Tar-
gums contained much information that Christian exegetes could use, not only
to refute Jewish interpretations of passages, but also to bolster Christian ones.7 
While other Christian scholars, some of them Jewish converts, had put kab-
balistic literature to use in the cause of Christian missionizing by the early ﬁf-
teenth century, it was Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–94) who
ﬁrst saw another, quite different beneﬁt for kabbalistic study. He believed and
taught that “non-biblical Jewish sources were meaningful and relevant to Chris-
tianity itself.”8 Pico’s own understanding of Kabbalah was shaped both through
the Latin translations of the sources and through his own Platonic and Pythag-
orean philosophical framework. Although Pico himself did not read the Zohar,
either in translation or in the original, he justiﬁed its study by Christians.9
The most difﬁcult Aramaic book to justify for Christian study was the Tal-
mud. Through the work of Peter the Venerable of Cluny (1094–1156), the
idea that the Talmud was a “heretical” work had entered Christian theological
tradition. The earlier medieval theological understanding of Judaism (and the
predominant one throughout the Middle Ages) was that Jews had functioned
as witnesses to the truth of Christianity by continuing to live according to the
laws of the Pentateuch, serving as “living letters” of the biblical text. Jeremy
Cohen has argued that Peter and other later theologians believed that the Tal-
mud was “heretical” because it represented a new law whose authority among
Jews was greater than that of the Bible. Peter also understood the Talmud to be
“sinister, insane, blasphemous, diabolical Jewish doctrine.”10 Christian authori-
ties justiﬁed Talmud-burnings in the fourteenth century because the work
contained “blasphemies, errors, curses, and lies.”11 Yet, despite the Talmud’s

evil reputation within Christian scholarship, by the early sixteenth century
even Talmudic study could be justiﬁed on humanist grounds.
Johannes Reuchlin is best known as the author of the ﬁrst Latin-language
Hebrew grammar and for his devotion to the Kabbalah. But Reuchlin also was
the author of an Opinion about the Books of the Jews written for the imperial
commission that was summoned to study Pfefferkorn’s proposal to conﬁscate
Jewish books.12 When he discussed the Talmud, Reuchlin asserted that it con-
tained information valuable to the most important university-level disciplines
(that is, theology, law, and medicine). He wrote:
For it contains many good medical prescriptions and information about plants
and roots, as well as good legal verdicts collected from all over the world by
experienced Jews. And in theology the Talmud offers in many passages argu-
ments against the wrong faith. This can be seen from the bishop of Burgos’s
books concerning the Bible, which he has written in a praiseworthy and Chris-
tian manner and in the Scrutinium Scripturarum, in which he clearly protects our
faith on the basis of the Talmud.
Indeed, Reuchlin found no fewer than 50 passages in which Paul of Burgos
quoted Talmudic passages in the latter book.13 Reuchlin’s argument was less
important for its immediate effect on imperial policy than as an important le-
gal opinion and precedent that established a rationale for allowing Christians
to use—and to print—the Talmud. The two opinions submitted by the the-
ology faculty of Basel and Ambrosius Froben to defend the propriety of print-
ing the Basel Talmud in late 1578 or early 1579 reﬂect and note Reuchlin’s
arguments.14
Around 1635, Johannes Buxtorf the Younger wrote a letter with advice on
how to begin the study of postbiblical Aramaic. The student, he wrote, must
ﬁrst attain a good knowledge of Aramaic dialects, consult a variety of study aids,
and above all, purchase any Latin translations of these books, because by com-
paring the original text with the Latin, the student would be able to make rapid
progress.15 In the days of Pico and Reuchlin, almost none of these tools was

available to Christians. The creation of a philological apparatus of Aramaic
grammars, dictionaries, and bilingual text editions (some with annotations) was
one of the greatest achievements of sixteenth-century Christian Aramaists.
The very ﬁrst Aramaic grammar composed in Latin for Christian students
was written by Sebastian Münster, a professor at the University of Heidelberg,
and was printed in 1527. Münster learned Hebrew from Conrad Pellican, his
superior in the Franciscan order, and Matthaeus Adrianus, a Jewish convert
from Spain who taught a number of the most important Protestant Hebraists
of the early sixteenth century.16 Most of his Aramaic education, however, in-
volved personal study, with occasional help from professing Jews.17 Münster’s
grammar was intended to help students learn not only Aramaic but also
enough medieval Hebrew (including abbreviations) to read Jewish biblical
commentaries.
Münster’s pioneering grammatical work would ﬁnd few emulators, at least
during the sixteenth century. Only seven authors composed Aramaic grammars.
Four of these were at least nominally Catholic (Theseus Ambrosius, George
Amira, Angel Caninius, and Jean Mercier), and three were Protestant (Sebas-
tian Münster, Cornelius Bertram, and Immanuel Tremellius). Two of these au-
thors, Amira and Ambrosius, lived and worked in Italy, while the other four
lived and worked in the French-speaking world. Both Caninius and Mercier
taught Hebrew at the Collège Royale of the University of Paris, the former
during the 1550s, and the latter from 1547 to 1570, while Bertram was one of
Mercier’s students. Bertram taught Hebrew at the Academy of Geneva from
1567 to 1586, and Tremellius taught Hebrew at the University of Heidelberg
from 1561 to 1575, though like Bertram he had his grammar printed in Ge-
neva. Mercier and his colleagues at the Collège Royale played a critical role in
providing both grammatical helps and annotated Aramaic texts for other
would-be Aramaic scholars.

to use the formula a docto quodam Iudaeo (Münster, Chaldaica Grammatica, f. a3r; Joseph Prijs,

in the early sixteenth century. See Karl Heinz Burmeister, “Johannes Campensis und Se-

Providing serviceable Aramaic lexicons for Christian students proved to be
a far greater challenge than grammars. Apart from the Hebrew-Aramaic
dictionary of Alfonso de Zamora in vol. 6 of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible
(1514–17), all scholarly attempts to write an Aramaic dictionary would be
based to some degree on Nathan ben Yehiel’s Sefer Aruk (ca. 1100).18 Nathan
ben Yehiel wrote his lexicon for advanced students of the Talmud, the Tar-
gums, and the Midrash and focused his attention on explaining foreign and dif-
ﬁcult words while leaving out more common ones. Moreover, he did not
organize his dictionary according to the principle of trilateral roots (which he
either did not accept or was perhaps unaware of ) but used an alphabetical or-
der.19 While some Christian Hebraists had the ability to use Sefer Aruk as it was
written, most needed a much smaller, Latin summary of it.
Jewish author Elias Levita wrote the ﬁrst Aramaic dictionary speciﬁcally in-
tended for Christian readers at the request of his patron, Cardinal Viterbo. Vi-
terbo may have learned the rudiments of Hebrew as early as his stay in Florence
during 1497, and throughout his career he was keenly interested in kabbalistic
learning and the Targums, as well as in oriental studies generally.20 He hired
Elias Levita to serve as his personal tutor in Hebrew and Aramaic from 1515
until 1527. At Viterbo’s initiative Levita took on the unenviable task of com-
piling the ﬁrst Targumic dictionary, combing through Nathan ben Yehiel’s Se-
fer Aruk for information, and providing further references to Latin and Greek
loanwords in the Targums. Levita organized his work alphabetically and used
the trilateral root as his organizing principle.21 Levita was forced to leave Rome
and move to Venice because of the sack of Rome in 1527, but Viterbo pro-
vided further ﬁnancial support for Levita, which allowed him to complete the
dictionary between 1528 and 1530. Levita’s work, entitled Meturgaman, or “In-
terpreter,” was ﬁnally printed by Paul Fagius in Isny during 1541.22
In 1523, Santes Pagninus wrote Enchiridion expositionis vocabulorum Haruch,
the ﬁrst Aramaic dictionary actually to appear in print. Pagninus learned He-
brew in Florence from Clemente Abraham, a Spanish-Jewish convert.23 He

served as a professor of Hebrew in Rome while Leo X was pope, enjoying his
patronage and the patronage of three of his successors. Pagninus based his dic-
tionary, not on Sefer Aruk directly, but on a Jewish summary, the Sefer Aruk
ha-Qizzur.24 Pagninus’s work was reprinted twice in expanded form, once in
the sixth volume of the Antwerp Polyglot (1568–72), edited by Guy le Fevre
de la Boderie, and as the Thesaurus Linguae Sanctae sive Lexicon hebraicum with
annotations by Jean Mercier, Cornelius Bertram and Pierre Chevalier, printed
in Lyons, 1575 and reprinted in 1577.
Sebastian Münster also wrote an Aramaic dictionary, which he had printed
in 1527, the same year as his grammar. He based his work on both a manu-
script copy of the Sefer Aruk ha-Qizzur, which he found in a Dominican mon-
astery library in Regensburg, and upon Pagninus’s Enchiridion.25 His old
teacher, Pellican, also gave him his notes on Talmudic vocabulary to include
in the dictionary.26 David de Pomis, a Jewish physician, composed the ﬁnal
Postbiblical Hebrew/Aramaic dictionary for Christians that appeared in the
sixteenth century. His Zemah David (Venice, 1587) was also based on the Sefer
Aruk and provided glosses in Italian as well as Latin.
While Latin-language Aramaic grammars and dictionaries were essential for
Christian students to learn the language, translations of Aramaic texts were an
important aid to study as well. Because the Targums were valuable to Catholic,
Reformed, and Lutheran theologians alike, and both the Zohar and Talmud
had far fewer Christian readers, it is no surprise that only targumic texts were
published in Latin translation during the sixteenth century. But these translated
Targums appeared in two distinctly different kinds of publications, polyglot
Bibles and small annotated editions, usually of single books for use as textbooks.
The earliest Targum to appear in a Christian printing with Latin translation
was published as part of Agostino Giustiniani’s Psalterium hebraeum, graecum, ara-
bicum et chaldaeum (Genoa, 1516). Giustiniani provided not only the targumic
text of the Psalms but also a Latin translation. The patronage of Cardinal Sauli
was essential for the printing of this pioneering work, and Sauli’s arrest in
1517 (as well as the poor sales of the Psalter), frustrated Giustiniani’s ambition

Qizzur, which had been owned by Italian Jewish grammarian Abraham de Balmes (1440–
1523), in “Aruch ms. Breslau,” Monatsschrift für Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums 73

to continue the project until he had published an entire polyglot Bible.27 The
two best-known polyglots, the Complutensian polyglot (1514–17) and the
Antwerp Polyglot (1568–73), were successfully completed because of their
more secure patronage and funding.
The Complutensian Polyglot was the brainchild of Cardinal Jiménez de
Cisneros. Cardinal Jiménez assembled a ﬁrst-class team of scholars to prepare
the text of the polyglot Bible, including two Jewish converts, Pablo Coronel
and Alfonso de Zamora. The editors provided Targum Onqelos in Aramaic and
a facing Latin translation. Cardinal Jiménez spent about 50,000 gold ducats on
preparing the text for printing. As Giustiniani had done with his Psalterium,
Cardinal Jiménez dedicated the polyglot Bible to Pope Leo X. Unfortunately,
the distribution of the Bible went far less smoothly than its printing. Although
production of the polyglot was completed by 1517, its distribution was not
sanctioned until papal authorization was given in March of 1520. Of the 600
sets printed, many were lost in a shipwreck.28 It was a handsome, monumental
Bible printing, whose size and distribution troubles limited its inﬂuence.
The Antwerp Polyglot Bible was meant both to update and to surpass the
older Complutensian Polyglot Bible. It was edited and produced under far dif-
ferent circumstances, however, from its predecessor’s. While its publication
was justiﬁed primarily on the basis of its usefulness to the Catholic Church and
the luster that it would add to the reputation of King Philip II of Spain, it was
also intended to be a philological weapon of war against Protestantism.29 In
contrast to the older Complutensian Polyglot, the Antwerp Bible contained
Targums to nearly every book of the Hebrew Bible, with facing Latin transla-
tion by Benito Arias Montano, the editor-in-chief himself.30 It also featured an
Aramaic dictionary and brief grammatical sketch written by Guy le Fèvre de la
Boderie, one of Guillaume Postel’s best students form the University of Paris.

Volume 8 also included Franz Raphelengius’s collation of variant readings in
the Targums.31 King Philip II provided an initial subsidy of 12,000 guilders to
underwrite the costs, which ultimately would grow to 21,000 guilders.32
The ﬁnal Polyglot Bible to appear in the sixteenth century was the work,
not of a group of well-connected Catholic scholars, but of an extraordinarily
persuasive Lutheran, Elias Hutter.33 Hutter can probably best be understood as
an educational visionary and entrepreneur. In 1597, when he arrived in
Nuremberg, Hutter planned to found a school for languages and sought the
support of the city council to publish multilingual books, a monumental multi-
lingual dictionary, a New Testament edition in twelve languages, and then his
enormous Hexateuch printing in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Latin, German,
Slavonic, French, and Italian. To ﬁnance the printing of these complicated
works, Hutter borrowed an enormous amount of money from the city coun-
cil, 14,000 Gulden for the Hexateuch alone in 1600.34 Sales of Hutter’s books
were too slow to repay his loans to the city council, and Hutter was forced
ﬁrst to turn over his remaining stock of books in 1604 and then to leave town
in early 1605, never to return.35 His polyglot Hexateuch would be only an
odd footnote in Targum studies, except that the Nuremberg city council was
desperate to recoup some of their losses. They used several different strategies
to sell off the remainder of Hutter’s stock, and these books were fairly easy to
ﬁnd on the book market.36
The generosity of wealthy or powerful patrons was only one factor in the
circulation of Aramaic texts. The foundation of chairs of Hebrew in northern
European universities meant that the potential existed for regular Aramaic
classes and therefore textbook sales. Jean Cinqarbres and Jean Mercier, both
professors of Hebrew at the Collège Royale of Paris were among the ﬁrst to
print Aramaic readers for their students.37 Between 1550 and 1562, Mercier

Wittenberg and Leipzig between 1563 and 1565 ( Johannes Schilling, “Johannes Drachs Mar-

prepared seven different student editions of books of the Targum, mostly the
Minor Prophets but also the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. His colleague,
Jean Cinqarbres, printed another three Aramaic readers with the texts of Lam-
entations (1549) and Hosea (1554–56).38 Other Targums for biblical books
were published by Erasmus O. Schreckenfuchs (Song of Solomon, Basel, 1553),
Pierre Costus (Ecclesiastes, Lyons, 1554); Gilbert Genebrard ( Joel, Paris, 1563),
and Arnauld Pontac (Obadiah, Jonah, Zechariah, Paris, 1566). Immanuel
Tremellius published a Latin translation, without the Aramaic text, of the twelve
Minor Prophets (Heidelberg, 1567).
Although neither the Zohar nor the Talmud was published in Latin trans-
lation, either in part or in their entirety, during the sixteenth century, they
were objects of enthusiastic study by at least some Christian scholars.39 Among
Christian students of the Zohar, Guillaume Postel stands out, because he
translated the entire work into Latin and prepared it for publication. Postel
ﬁrst acquired a manuscript copy of the Zohar in Venice during 1547, and he
began his ﬁrst translation of it the following year. In addition to his consider-
able linguistic skills, Postel brought to the task of translation his idiosyncratic
understanding of a universal salvation, which he derived from the Zohar as in-
terpreted by the “Venetian Virgin,” Mother Johanna, his spiritual mentor.40
After the Zohar appeared in print for the ﬁrst time (Cremona, 1558–59), Pos-
tel acquired a copy of it and translated the Zohar a second time into Latin.41
He tried unsuccessfully a number of times between 1553 and 1580 to con-
vince various Basel printers to print his Zohar translation.42

Christian Aramaism: Aramaic Scholarship in the Sixteenth Century
431
Talmudic study was by far the most difﬁcult branch of Aramaic literature
that a Christian could pursue. During the sixteenth century (and also the sev-
enteenth), Christian students normally needed a Jewish tutor to make any
progress at all. Wolfgang Capito owned a Talmud, but he gave it to Conrad
Pellican in Zurich in 1526 because he had no tutor to help him learn. Pellican
would ultimately make substantial use of Capito’s gift. From 1538 to 1540,
Pellican had the help of Michael Adam, a Jewish convert, as he translated por-
tions of the Talmud into Latin. At ﬁrst the work went very slowly, because
Adam knew no Latin and also could not read German. The two men spent
half an hour a day reading Talmud, Adam explaining a given passage in Ger-
man, while Pellican wrote down the Latin translation.43 Ultimately Pellican,
with Adam’s help, translated 17 tractates, drawn from both the Babylonian
and the Palestinian Talmuds, all of which remained unpublished. Pellican’s
motive for devoting decades to the work, however, was apologetic rather than
humanistic. He wrote to a colleague in 1550, “Why should anyone devote
themselves to these Jewish unworthy things? Only to prevent the Jews, who
alone master it, from creating confusion among Christians.” Pellican believed
that combing Jewish literature for valuable information and insights was like
“looking for gemstones in heaps of manure.”44 Christian scholars did not be-
gin to make serious use of the Talmud as a historical source for understanding
the Bible until the early seventeenth century, when Johannes Coccejus and
Constantijn L’Empereur began their careers.45
Apart from Pellican’s motive of “knowing one’s enemy,” another use for Tal-
mudic learning among Christians was preparing censors to read Jewish books.
While the majority of Hebrew censors in Italy were Jewish converts, there were
a few both in Italy and in Germany who were non-Jews. In order to gain the
knowledge necessary to evaluate the Talmud at all, these Christian censors had
to have instruction from Jews or Jewish converts. For example, three different
men censored portions of the Basel Talmud between 1578 and 1580: Immanuel
Tremellius, a Jewish convert; his former student from the University of Heidel-
berg, Pierre Chevalier; and Marius Marinus, the papal inquisitor of Venice.
Marinus had ﬁrst learned Hebrew from Pablo Veneto, a Jewish convert and a
fellow Augustinian monk in the Congregation of S. Salvator of Brescia. Later
Marinus would receive further instruction from Samuel Archevolti in Venice at
the same time that young Leon Modena studied with him.46

By the 1560s, the basic philological tools for Aramaic study had been
forged, and a workable rationale for studying the Targums, the Zohar, and the
Talmud had been worked out. But how widespread was the study of Aramaic
among sixteenth-century Christians? Was it the hobby of a very few or a
more-established, intellectual pursuit? That Aramaic study was no mere hobby
is clear from an analysis of the places in which Christian Aramaic books were
produced and from an examination of the records of Christian libraries in
which Jewish Aramaic books found a home.
While knowledge of Biblical Hebrew was not uncommon among Christian
theologians of the sixteenth century, they were seldom proﬁcient in postbibli-
cal Aramaic. A comparison of printing statistics for Hebrew and Aramaic phil-
ological books written for Christians suggests different markets for each kind of
book. Over the course of the century, 852 philological books on Hebrew-
related topics were printed for Christians, while only 61 were printed that con-
tained substantial information on Aramaic. Of the books that were produced,
only three of the authors, Elias Levita, Santes Pagninus, and Jean Mercier had
their works reprinted, which implies a lack of demand for the titles. 
Because the demand for Aramaic books was not particularly high, patron-
age was essential for both the scholars who wrote them and for the printers
who produced them. Some of the very earliest scholars were beholden to gen-
erous benefactors of many kinds. Elias Levita lived for more than a decade in
the household of Egidio de Viterbo and was strongly encouraged not only to
provide language instruction but also to publish in the ﬁelds of Hebrew and
Aramaic studies. Both Agostino Giustiniani and Santes Pagninus also enjoyed
the patronage of high Catholic churchmen, in Pagninus’s case the support of
no fewer than four popes. Cardinal Jiménez and Agostino Giustiniani both
dedicated their works to Pope Leo X. David de Pomis dedicated his Zemach
David to Pope Sixtus V. The monumental polyglot Bibles would not have ap-
peared in print at all without the help of generous patrons, a cardinal and a
king, who helped to defray their production costs.
Before we conclude that Christian Aramaism was an oddity, the pursuit of
devoted hobbyists, we should remember that the true harvest in terms of
Christian translation and study of these Jewish classics could only come after
the dogged scholarship of Johannes Buxtorf the Elder and Younger produced
the monumental Lexicon Chaldaicum Talmudicum et Rabbinicum (1639–40). Yet
between the days of Münster, Pagninus, and Buxtorf there were a sufﬁcient
number of Christians interested in Aramaic that a measurable number of Jew-
ish Aramaic books began to form part of their libraries.

Christian Aramaism: Aramaic Scholarship in the Sixteenth Century
433
Inventories of two university and seven private libraries, dating from the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, provide remarkable insights into the
progress of Aramaic studies among Christians.47 All of the scholars, except Jo-
seph Scaliger, were German, as were the university library catalogs. Five of the
seven libraries owned by individual scholars contained complete Babylonian
Talmuds, and three also contained Palestinian Talmuds, while Reuchlin had
only a manuscript copy of b. Sanhedrin. The Strasbourg University Library
owned both Talmuds. Lucas Edenberger, Wittenberg University’s librarian,
tried to purchase a Talmud in Venice during 1541 but was deterred by its high
cost.48 In 1593, Johannes Piscator, the rector of the newly founded Herborn
Academy, solicited the gift of a Babylonian Talmud from Count Wilhelm
Ludwig, Stadholder of the Dutch province of Friesland and oldest son of Count
Johann VI of Nassau-Dillenberg, for the library.49 These library lists and the
wishes of Edenberger and Piscator to acquire Talmuds for their institutions all
underscore its importance for Christian thinkers by 1600.
The Targums are represented in every one of these lists in a wide variety of
formats. The Biblia rabbinica, printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg, was strongly
represented. Only Georg Siegel did not own one. Martin Bucer, Conrad Pel-
lican, and Sebastian Münster each owned two different printings, as did the
Strasbourg library. Several leading Wittenberg scholars including Melanchthon,
Caspar Cruciger, and possibly even Luther himself also owned copies of either
the 1517 or 1524–25 editions of the Biblia rabbinica.50 Each library has at least
one other Targum text, whether in the form of a Pentateuch with Targum
(Strasbourg, Reuchlin, Scaliger), a polyglot Bible (Pappus), or Giustiniani’s Psal-
terium (Wittenberg, Bucer, Pellican, Pappus, Scaliger).
The Zohar appears in only one copy in the library of Joseph Scaliger. How-
ever, it is worth remembering that kabbalistic study of any kind among Protes-
tants and Catholics tended to be a private rather than a public or academic
47. The libraries’ catalogs under discussion are the university libraries of Wittenberg
(1540) and Strasbourg (1572?), and the scholarly libraries of Johannes Reuchlin, Martin
Bucer, Sebastian Münster, Konrad Pellican, Georg Siegel, Johannes Pappus, and Joseph
Scaliger. See the appendix (pp. 434–36).

pursuit. The number of Christian imprints of kabbalistic texts of any kind dur-
ing the sixteenth century was very small, only 9 of the 912 Hebraica books.51
Even among Jews the Zohar was not widely available until after it appeared for
the ﬁrst time in print in Cremona in 1558–59. Guillaume Postel, Francesco
Zorzi (both living in Italy), and other Christian Kabbalists were able to ﬁnd
copies of the Zohar to read before it appeared in print, but its diffusion and
study among Christian Hebraists was slower than the Talmud or the Targums.52
These reﬂections on the Aramaic holdings of a group of predominantly
German Protestant Hebraists illustrate one other trend in Aramaic scholarship.
These books, which were sponsored and produced in Catholic Europe, found
avid readers among Protestants. Because of its large number of universities
with professors of Hebrew, Germany formed one of the largest markets for
Hebrew textbooks, reference books, and for source collections such as the
Biblia rabbinica.53 In the seventeenth century, Protestants scholars would take
the lead in Aramaic scholarship, but even before this happened they were avid
consumers of it.
Christian Aramaism, then, was born in late-ﬁfteenth-century Italy and
Spain and grew up north of the Alps during the early years of the Reforma-
tion. In its early stages it was inﬂuenced more by patronage and Jewish assis-
tance than by the tensions of the Reformation. By the end of the sixteenth
century, Christian scholars had formulated rationales for studying Jewish lit-
erature and had forged a rudimentary apparatus. They had begun the process
of translating and excerpting it, especially portions of the Targums, to inte-
grate the information they found into a Christian framework. Taken together,
the growth of Christian Aramaism was a remarkable scholarly achievement.

A Report from Genology
Carol A. Newsom
Candler School of Theology, Emory University
Biblical studies has a natural afﬁnity with genology, the study of genres but
has had a strangely on and off again relationship with that discipline. For biblical
studies the investigation of genres largely took shape as part of the development
of form criticism. Although Gunkel was in conversation with several disciplines
(e.g., classics, Germanics) that were concerned with the nature of genres, he did
not apparently read literary theory.1 Despite this, or more likely because of it,
early form criticism included some elements that made it among the most pro-
gressive developments in genre criticism of the time. Form criticism, of course,
was not primarily interested in literary genres but in the oral Gattungen that
came to be recorded in written texts. In this regard form criticism might be
seen as an early investigation of issues similar to those that intrigued Mikhail
Bakhtin in his reﬂections on “speech genres” and their function in discourse,2
though form criticism’s focus was primarily on the reconstruction of oral Gat-
tungen. More signiﬁcantly, form criticism’s attention to the Sitz im Leben of
speech forms was a signiﬁcant contribution to the sociology of genres. Indeed,
this contribution was acknowledged in the work of Robert Jauss, a leading ﬁg-
ure of the Konstanz school of “reception aesthetics,” which emphasizes the
function and reception of literary genres in their historical and social contexts.
Jauss contrasts the relative neglect of attention to these aspects of genre in many
strands of literary studies at the turn of the century with the development
within biblical studies of “a concept of genre that is structural as well as socio-
logical,” describing brieﬂy the work of Gunkel, Dibelius, and Bultmann.3

Despite its accomplishments, however, early form criticism was marked by a
tendency toward rigidity in its assumption that oral forms were “pure forms,”
with a tight connection between their life settings and their structures.4
A new interest in the potential of genre theory for biblical studies was part
of the “literary turn” of biblical studies in the 1970s and was reﬂected in the
SBL Genres Project, initiated by Robert Funk. Groups were established to in-
vestigate the genres of parable, pronouncement story, miracle story, letter, and
apocalypse. Results from some of the groups were published in various issues
of Semeia and have been quite inﬂuential in shaping the discussion of these an-
cient genres.5 Since that time, of course, various individual scholars have used
genre theory in their research,6 but the conversation between biblical studies
and genre studies continues to be sporadic.
In this essay I wish to make a brief and selective review of some of the
trends in genre theory and their possible usefulness in biblical studies. In order
to organize this discussion I will examine the approach and ﬁndings of the
Apocalypse Group of the SBL as published in Semeia 14, Apocalypse: The Mor-
phology of a Genre (1979), noting how more-recent developments in genre the-
ory might change the assumptions, approaches, and questions to be posed in a
study of the genre of apocalypse. My comments are in no sense a criticism of
the work of the Apocalypse Group. To the contrary, even some 25 years later,
the quality of the analysis of this deservedly inﬂuential work remains impres-
sive and its results valuable. But not surprisingly, the framework of genre stud-
ies has changed signiﬁcantly, so that now one would probably approach the
issues somewhat differently.
Characteristic of genre studies of the time, the Apocalypse Group frames
the task primarily as one of deﬁnition and classiﬁcation, so that the authors de-
scribe their purpose as that of identifying “a group of written texts marked by
distinctive recurring characteristics which constitute a recognizable and coher-
ent type of writing.”7 The metaphors and images that appear in the descrip-
tion refer to the “members” of the genre, to texts “belonging” to the genre,
and to the genre’s “boundaries.” In several of the chapters, grids are presented
that list the various features of form and content on one axis and the names of
the apocalypses on the other axis. Each feature attested in the apocalypse is

marked with an x. Over the past quarter-century, however, genre theorists
have become increasingly dissatisﬁed with an approach that deﬁnes genres by
means of lists of features. The objections are of several sorts. Deﬁnitional and
classiﬁcatory approaches are now seen as not representing well the functions
of genre in human communication. As Alastair Fowler remarks, genre primar-
ily has to do with communication. “It is an instrument not of classiﬁcation or
prescription, but of meaning.”8 Moreover, classiﬁcatory schemes are by their
very nature static, whereas genres are dynamic. Thus Fowler memorably ob-
jects that the classiﬁcation approach tends to treat genres as though they were
pigeonholes, when in fact genres are more like pigeons.9 “Mere” classiﬁcation
obscures the way in which every text—however it relates to similar texts—
whether “by conformity, variation, innovation, or antagonism” will change
the nature of the genre and indeed give rise to new genres.10
The objections from poststructuralists such as Derrida are, not surprisingly,
even stronger. In characteristically paradoxical fashion, Derrida claims that
while “a text cannot belong to no genre” he would rather “speak of a sort of
participation without belonging—a taking part in without being part of, with-
out having membership in a set.”11 In my opinion there is much to be said for
following Derrida’s lead and thinking of genre in relation to a text’s rhetorical
orientation so that rather than referring to texts as belonging to genres one
might think of texts as participating in them, invoking them, gesturing to
them, playing in and out of them, and in so doing, continually changing them.
With respect to apocalypses, this shift in how one thinks about texts and
genres accommodates better not only the multigeneric nature of many apoc-
alypses but also their irreducible particularity. It also allows one to think more
ﬂexibly about apocalypses and the penumbra of related kinds of texts.
Classiﬁcation continues to have its defenders in genre theory but often in a
way that quite changes the nature and purposes of classiﬁcation from a descrip-
tive enterprise to that of a critical category devised by the critic for the purposes
of the critic. Thus Adena Rosmarin, in The Power of Genre, argues that genre
can be seen as a kind of intentional category error in which two things that are
not the same are brought together “as if” they were the same. Drawing on art
historian E. H. Gombrich’s dictum that “all thinking is sorting, classifying,” she

argues that it is the critic who draws together different texts for productive pur-
poses. This is how we
can explain texts that are different—“Composed upon Westminster Bridge” and
“The Windhover”—as if they were the same kind of thing, namely, a sonnet.
. . . We can always choose, correct, invent, or deﬁne a class wide enough to
make the desired [category] mistake possible. . . . The initial thesis of a rhetorical
and pragmatic theory of explanation, then, is that the inevitability of making
mistakes is not the bane of criticism but, rather, its enabling condition. It makes
classiﬁcation possible, and classiﬁcation enables criticism to begin.12
Thus for the neopragmatist genre critic such as Rosmarin, the “validity” of a
genre category has to do with its potential for creating new critical insight
rather than with its correspondence to the author’s own sense of genre.
The authors of Semeia 14 initially appear to have some sympathy for a prag-
matic approach to genre of this sort because they observe that the use of the
term Apokalypsis in ancient manuscripts is “not a reliable guide to the genre.”
Rather “an ‘apocalypse’ is simply that which scholars can agree to call an
‘apocalypse.’”13 If this is the case, then there would be little objection to a
classiﬁcatory approach that deﬁnes the genre of apocalypse in terms of a clus-
tering of features of form and content. Nevertheless, it does not seem to me
that the authors of Semeia 14 intended their clariﬁcation of the genre apoca-
lypse simply to function as a convenience for critics but in some sense to make
explicit the tacit assumptions held by ancient writers about how one composes
an apocalypse. That is to say, I judge that their critical act was not intended so
much as a constructive act as a reconstructive one. If this is the case, then the
limitations of the classiﬁcatory approach have to be addressed.
Even if one wishes to move beyond classiﬁcation, however, the fact remains
that genre recognition involves some sort of mental grouping of texts on the
basis of perceived similarity. Many of the recent discussions have struggled to
ﬁnd more-apt ways of describing this process. One of the most popular of
these explanations is developed from Wittgenstein’s notion of family resem-
blance. In Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein posed the question of what is
common to the various things we call games: “board games, card games, ball
games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? . . . If you
look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities,
relationships, and a whole series of them at that. . . . We see a complicated net-

work of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similari-
ties, sometimes similarities of detail.—And I shall say: ‘games’ form a family.”14
Adapted and popularized by Fowler as a means of thinking about genre,15
the notion of family resemblance does seem to get at aspects of the perceptual
processes by which the mind sorts things that belong together from those that
seem not to belong together. One might, of course, argue that classiﬁcation by
means of features is simply the systematic and self-conscious application of a
model of family resemblance, but this is not usually the way in which genre
theorists invoke the model. Fowler insists that it is neither “as an inferior sub-
stitute for a class” nor “a mere preliminary to deﬁnition.”16 Instead, it makes
the “blurred edges” of genres of the essence. Indeed, among its more radical
proponents, the family-resemblance model appears to dissolve category bound-
aries in a fairly decisive manner. But for this very reason the approach runs into
problems of its own. For example, texts in Group A might exhibit features a,
b, c, Group B might exhibit features b, c, d, and group C might exhibit features
c, d, e, and so forth. One is left with the uncomfortable conclusion that the
family-resemblance model could produce a genre in which two exemplars in
fact shared no traits in common! As John Swales remarks, “family resemblance
theory can make anything resemble anything.”17
Another attempt to describe how genre recognition and genre competence
take place invokes the notion of intertextuality. Jonathan Culler describes the
way in which readers make sense of texts as follows: “A work can only be read
in connection with or against other texts, which provide a grid through which
it is read and structured by establishing expectations which enable one to pick
out salient features and give them a structure.”18
One of the appealing aspects of this account is that it suggests the tacit and
unselfconscious way in which people acquire a sense of genre by reading many
texts. Culler’s account also attends to the communicative function of genre as
establishing “a contract between writer and reader so as to make certain rele-
vant expectations operative and thus to permit both compliance with and de-
viation from accepted modes of intelligibility.”19 In many respects the practice

of the Apocalypse Group could be described as a highly intentional form of in-
tertextuality, because they read texts closely in relation to one another in order
to cultivate a disciplined sense of genre recognition. But they did so with a
much more limited purpose than that which Culler ascribes to intertextuality.
Culler’s model is not only about genre recognition but also about the dynamics
of genre deviation as part of the text’s communicative purpose. Culler does
not, however, draw the implications for the history of genres that Fowler does
in his reference to an author’s practice of “conformity, variation, innovation,
or antagonism,” by means of which the very body of intertexts is changed with
each new instance, so that ultimately the very genre itself may be transmuted
into something else.20 While the Apocalypse Group did not include an at-
tempt to establish a diachronic map of the changing nature of the apocalypses,
the intertextual approach described by Culler and Fowler could well be
adapted for purposes of this sort.
As helpful as the invocation of intertextuality can be, it is based on a hypo-
thetical sense rather than an empirical ﬁnding of how readers actually acquire
a sense of genre, and in fact it is in some ways mistaken about the nature of
this process. One of the most promising recent developments in exploring
how people do recognize and engage genres emerges from cognitive science
and its radical overturning of our understanding of how mental categories are
formed and function. Because genres are categories of speech or literature,
they function in much the same way as other mental categories. The key in-
sight of the cognitive theory of categories is that conceptual categories are not
best thought of as deﬁned by distinctive features possessed by every member
of the group but, rather, by a recognition of prototypical examples that serve
as templates against which other possible instances are viewed. In a series of
experiments in the 1970s, Eleanor Rosch showed that this is how categorical
structures function.21 For instance, even though robins, ostriches, swallows,
eagles, and penguins are all birds, people tend to treat robins and sparrows as
“typical” members of the category birds and ostriches and penguins as “atyp-
ical.” Thus robins and sparrows are the prototypes for the category “bird.”
The category can be extended to cover other birds that do not conform to the
prototype (e.g., those that are large or do not ﬂy or do not sing), but the birds
that do not closely resemble the prototypes have a marginal status. Categories

are thus structured with central and peripheral members. Indeed membership
in a category may be a matter of degree.22
One of the advantages of prototype theory is that it provides a way for
bringing together what seems so commonsensical in classiﬁcatory approaches,
while avoiding their rigidity. At the same time it gives more discipline to the
family-resemblance approach, because not every resemblance or deviation is
of equal signiﬁcance.23 As applied to genre categories, prototype theory
would require an identiﬁcation of exemplars that are prototypical and an
analysis of the privileged properties that establish the sense of typicality.
How would this approach compare with the project of the Apocalypse
Group? In fact, it appears that they intuitively worked with something like a
prototype model. Consider the following statement:
There is a general consensus among modern scholars that there is a phenomenon
which may be called “apocalyptic” and that it is expressed in an ill-deﬁned list of
writings which includes (on any reckoning) the Jewish works Daniel (chaps. 7–
12), 1 Enoch, 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch and the Christian book of Revelation. The
list is generally agreed to be more extensive than this but its precise extent is a
matter of dispute.24
The apocalypses named are clearly recognized as “prototypical,” though a
prototype theory of genre would ﬁnd the dispute about the extent of the
genre category not to be a problem that requires solving by recourse to a strict
deﬁnition. Also similar to prototype theory is the distinction made by the
Apocalypse Group between “a few elements [that] are constant in every
work,” a larger number that may or may not be present, as well as elements
distinctive to particular works.25 Thus there is a distinction between central or
privileged properties and those that are more peripheral.
To this point, prototype theory may sound as though it is not much differ-
ent than a slightly chastened form of deﬁnition by features. But there are other
aspects of prototype theory that differentiate it from traditional forms of cate-
gory deﬁnition. Categories are not simply collections of features but also in-
volve cognitive models or background framework schemata. The difference
between the two approaches can be illustrated by a classic example.26 By def-
inition, the concept “bachelor” means “an unmarried adult male.” But no one

really thinks of the Pope, Tarzan, or a Muslim with three wives as a bachelor.
The category is implicitly related to a script-like semantic frame that under-
stands the course of a typical man’s life as beginning with childhood, progress-
ing to a period of sexual maturity, and involving (or not) marriage to one
woman. Only in relation to that “idealized cognitive model” does the cate-
gory “bachelor” make sense.27
The signiﬁcance of this analysis of cognitive models for genre is that “ele-
ments” alone are not what trigger recognition of a genre; instead, what trig-
gers it is the way in which they are related to one another in a Gestalt structure
that serves as an idealized cognitive model. Thus the elements only make sense
in relation to a whole. Because the Gestalt structure contains default and op-
tional components, as well as necessary ones, individual exemplars can depart
from the prototypical exemplars with respect to default and optional elements
and still be recognizable as an extended case of “that sort of text.”28
The members of the Apocalypse Group seem to have anticipated some-
thing like the gestalt notion as essential to genre recognition in their discussion
of what they called “the inner coherence of the genre.” As they noted, “the
different elements which make up our comprehensive deﬁnition of the genre
are not associated at random but are integrally related by their common impli-
cations.”29 Speciﬁcally, they note “transcendence” as the key to the relation-
ships, linking the manner of revelation, the existence of a heavenly world, the
nature of its beings, and the function of apocalyptic eschatology. “There is,
then, an intrinsic relation between the revelation which is expressed in the
apocalypse as a whole and the eschatological salvation promised in that revela-
tion.”30 Thus an element like pseudepigraphy, which is surely a central cate-
gory for the genre apocalypse, may nevertheless be absent even from one of
the prototypical exemplars (the book of Revelation). Certain “default” fea-
tures characteristic of prototypical apocalypses (e.g., resurrection of the dead)
do not, however, appear in all of the Jewish apocalypses (e.g., the Apocalypse
of Weeks and Testament of Levi 2–5) and may be represented by different con-
tent in others (e.g., the way in which revealed knowledge conveys present sal-
vation in Gnostic apocalypses). The gestalt structure (or idealized cognitive
model) organizes and authorizes the extension from the prototypical cases to
those that are atypical.

Prototype theory, however, challenges the classiﬁcatory approach in a more
fundamental way. Classiﬁcation, no matter how nuanced, tends toward a bi-
nary logic. Does a text belong or not belong? Does it belong to this genre or
to that one? Thinking in terms of prototype exemplars and a graded contin-
uum challenges this artiﬁcial manner of assigning texts to generic categories.31
In a witty analogy, Marie-Laure Ryan describes the existence of both “highly
typical” and the “less typical” texts of a genre as encouraging one “to think of
genres as clubs imposing a certain number of conditions for membership, but
tolerating as quasi-members those individuals who can fulﬁll only some of the
requirements, and who do not seem to ﬁt into any other club.”32 Though it
may seem to be a mere quibbling over metaphors, metaphors are quite impor-
tant in how we think. Thus the prototype and family-resemblance approach
to genre seems to me to offer advantages for how one would think about
Jubilees or the Temple Scroll or revelatory discourses in relationship to the genre
apocalypse in contrast to a classiﬁcatory approach that talks of the boundaries
of the genre and the problem of borderline cases.
One ﬁnal aspect of prototype theory remains to be noted, and it is one that
raises the issue of the limits of this approach. Michael Sinding, one of the
strong advocates of prototype theory, argues that, in contrast to the historically
oriented family-resemblance approach as developed by Fowler, prototype the-
ory operates ahistorically. That is to say one can read the prototypical exem-
plars out of historical order and thus without a sense of how one text
inﬂuences or imitates another “and still have as good a grasp of the genre, as a
genre, as anyone.”33 Here, too, the Apocalypse Group works with a similar
perspective in that they deﬁne their concern as that of “phenomenological
similarity, not historical derivation.”34 For the purposes of genre recognition,
this ahistorical approach can certainly be justiﬁed. But developing a sense of
the genre is not the only matter to be pursued. Some of the most interesting
issues in genology are precisely those of genealogy.
The recognition of the historical nature of genres was a surprisingly late de-
velopment in genre theory. Until the emergence of Romanticism, most genre
criticism treated genres as transcendent or “natural” forms that were valid, de-
scriptively and prescriptively, across historical periods.35 This explains various

attempts to identify biblical compositions in terms of classical genres, such as,
for instance, Theodore Beza’s comparison of Job with classical tragedy. Ro-
manticism’s new recognition of genres as dynamic entities historically and cul-
turally conditioned was given its classic expression in Hegel’s lectures on
aesthetics. Not surprisingly, this new historicist understanding of genres soon
found an intriguing model in Darwin’s theory of evolution, developed most
fully in Ferdinand Brunetière’s L’évolution des genres, published in 1890. Al-
though the evolutionary model has been criticized, it has received a recent de-
fender in David Fishelov, who argues that a more careful use of Darwinian
analogies can be of signiﬁcant use in understanding why some genres are pro-
ductive at particular periods and then become extinct or “sterile,” as Fishelov
would prefer to describe them.36
For reasons that should be evident, this is an extremely important issue for
understanding the genre of apocalypse, because it is possible to date the emer-
gence of apocalypses (sometime in the third century b.c.e.) and to date their
demise within Judaism (in the aftermath of the Bar Kochba revolt), though
they continued to be composed in Christian circles, including the Gnostics.
Moreover, most of the Jewish apocalypses and many of the Christian ones can
be dated with reasonable certainty, and patterns of inﬂuence often can be
traced. The relationships among these documents have frequently been ex-
plored with respect to ideas, motifs, or theological perspectives, but rarely has
the focus been on describing the evolution of the genre as such.
Another aspect of the historicist perspective on genre has to do with the re-
lationship of different genres to one another in succeeding historical periods.
The Russian Formalists, in particular, took up the question of the evolution of
genres not as isolated developments but in relation to the genre system as a
whole.37 Whether or not one could describe a hierarchy of genres within the
Second Temple period, as the Russian Formalists proposed for various epochs
in Western literature, is a difﬁcult question. But it is worth asking how one
might describe the relationships among the narrative, historiographical, poetic,
paraenetic, apocalyptic, halakic, and other genres that ﬂourished during the
Second Temple period. Were some more dominant than others? Are certain
genres absorbed into others? And how might one describe the radical restruc-
turing of the genre system in the period after the destruction of the Temple
and especially after the failure of the Bar Kochba revolt? Shklovsky drew at-

447
tention to the fact that genre change is not simply continuous development
but often discontinuous or, as one might say, that it requires not only evolu-
tionary but revolutionary models.38
Even though Shklovsky rightly challenged the simple linearity of the nature
of genre change, his own metaphors—the knight’s move in chess or an inheri-
tance that proceeds from uncle to nephew rather than from father to son—
suggest a rather schematic sense of motivated directionality. While this may be
adequate for an investigation of large-scale changes in genre systems, the
change that takes place in particular genres is generally much less tidy. Fowler
describes a process of continuous metamorphosis in which “every literary
work changes the genres it relates to. This is true not only of radical innova-
tions and productions of genius. The most imitative work, even as it kowtows
slavishly to generic conventions, nevertheless affects them, if only minutely or
indirectly.”39 Fowler’s observation might be recast in terms of Mikhail Bakh-
tin’s notion of texts as utterances in dialogical relationship to one another.40
Not only is every utterance unique but also it must be conceived of as a reply
to what has gone before. Thus every instance of a genre can be understood as
a reply to other instances of that genre and as a reply to other genres, whether
or not self-consciously conceived of as such. The dialogical relationship carries
forward the ever-changing conﬁguration of the genre.
Bakhtin, however, recognized not only the continuous transformation of
genres but also their profound conservatism. In a paradoxical formulation he
asserted that “a genre is always the same and yet not the same, always old and
new simultaneously.”41 This paradox was contained in what he referred to as
genre memory, the fact that new iterations of a genre always contained archaic
elements. “A genre lives in the present, but always remembers its past, its begin-
ning. Genre is a representative of creative memory in the process of literary
development.”42 Bakhtin’s formulation thus brings together the synchronic
and diachronic elements of genre.43

With respect to the problem of the genre of apocalypse, this perspective
may be of particular use for understanding the internal dynamics of late Chris-
tian and Gnostic apocalypses, which stand chronologically far from the begin-
nings of apocalyptic. But it may also be a fruitful approach to the issue of the
multigeneric nature of apocalypses. Many apocalypses contain paraenesis, his-
torical resumés, dream reports, and a variety of other small genres. These, too,
have genre memory and retain archaic elements even as they are newly con-
textualized and transformed by being incorporated into apocalypses.
As so often, Bakhtin is more suggestive than systematic. To understand bet-
ter the issues posed by the origin of the genre of apocalypse, its multigeneric
quality, and its relation to what the Apocalypse Group terms “related texts”
one might turn again to the intersection of cognitive theory and genre theory.
Cognitive theory has concerned itself extensively with the mechanisms of
mental creativity, particularly the notion of “conceptual blending” in the
work of Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner.44 Although this is a highly com-
plex and subtle theory to which I cannot begin to do justice in this short essay,
it understands certain forms of creative thinking as occurring when two or
more mental schemata are brought together and integrated in networks of
“mental spaces.” This is, in essence, how we think by means of metaphors or
the way we integrate a ﬁgural scenario and a political scenario in political car-
toons. The extension of this theory to genre is only in its initial stages, and its
usefulness remains to be demonstrated.45 Nevertheless, it might well provide a
more rigorous way in which to investigate, for instance, how late prophetic vi-
sion accounts, parabiblical narrative, historical resumés, and other such forms
are creatively blended to produce what we recognize as apocalypses. Or, one
might use an approach of this sort to understand the way in which apocalypses
and testaments are brought together to create novel types of texts that occupy
the periphery between genres.
A ﬁnal perspective on genres that holds particular promise for the investi-
gation of apocalyptic literature comes from the work of the Bakhtin circle. For
Bakhtin and his colleagues, genre is not simply a literary form but a mode of
cognition. The metaphor invoked by Pavel Medvedev was genre as a means of
seeing: “Every genre has its methods and means of seeing and conceptualizing
reality, which are accessible to it alone. . . . The process of seeing and concep-

tualizing reality must not be severed from the process of embodying it in the
forms of a particular genre. . . . The artist must learn to see reality with the
eyes of the genre.”46 Medvedev compares the different ways of conceptualiz-
ing reality that are accessible to a graph as opposed to a painting, or to a lyric
poem as opposed to a drama or a novel. Genres are thus ideological instru-
ments in that they are the expressions of mental structures or world views.
Thus the exploration of the genre apocalypse needs to include the question of
what kind of thinking is performed by the genre qua genre.
But how might one approach this question? Bakhtin’s own work on the
genre of the novel led him to privilege the particular conﬁgurations of space
and time, the chronotope, as he called it, as that which deﬁnes and distin-
guishes different genres.47 Thus the adventure novel of ordeal has a repertoire
of characteristic physical settings (journeys, voyages, exotic locales, market-
places, etc.) as well as a repertoire of characteristic ways of handling time
(abrupt meetings and partings, coincidental arrivals, a series of episodes that
are largely interchangeable in sequence, etc.). By contrast the Bildungsroman
has a quite different repertoire of privileged places and constructions of tem-
porality. These differences have implications for the kind of characters who
can inhabit these different worlds. Indeed, they are very different ways of con-
struing reality itself.
Although the chronotope has mostly been explored in relation to narrative
structures, there is no reason why it would not be fruitful for other types of
literature. Apocalypses, in particular, are deeply concerned with the nature
and signiﬁcance of time and with the relation of certain privileged spaces to
one another and to time. The distinctive character of the apocalyptic seer and
the privileging of apocalyptic knowledge as a moral and religious virtue are
integrally related to the chronotope characteristic of apocalypses. To go be-
yond superﬁcial observations would require considerable, detailed work, but
the aptness of Bakhtin’s conception of the chronotope for research on apoca-
lypses should be evident.
One could, of course, go on and on, but I hope in this short essay to have
shown ways in which the conversation between biblical studies and genology
can continue to be highly productive. Although it is always hazardous to at-
tempt to predict the future of an intellectual inquiry, I suspect that the most
creative work in genology in the next decade will take place at the intersection

of the Bakhtinian understanding of genre and the understanding that is devel-
oping in conversation with cognitive theory. Not only can cognitive theory
help reﬁne the intuitive insights of Bakhtin and Medvedev concerning the
cognitive force of genre, but the Bakhtin circle’s emphasis on the social and
historical dimensions of genres can also prevent cognitive theories from be-
coming too abstract. Given the rich tradition of the study of oral and written
forms in biblical studies, there is every reason to think that this discipline can
play an important role in the developing discourse concerning genre.

What’s in a Calendar? 
Calendar Conformity, Calendar Controversy, 
and Calendar Reform 
in Ancient and Medieval Judaism
Shemaryahu Talmon
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
I propose to address the question when and how a difference of opinion be-
tween diverse echelons of a society is prone to harden into a schism that even-
tually leads to the establishment of a sociopolitical or religious corpus separatum.
In other words, where exactly can the borderline between “dialogue,” “legit-
imate disputation,” and socioreligious schism be drawn. It is my thesis that in
respect to Judaism, a nonconformable calendar was often the decisive factor in
such a process. The centripetal effect of a shared ephemeris on the one hand,
and of the centrifugal impact of calendrical nonconformity on the other hand,
can be illustrated by bringing under review reports and documents that bear
witness to the pivotal role recurrently played by a “calendar-event” in the
emergence of dissenting factions in various periods in the history of ancient
Judaism. I do not aim at exhausting the topic. Rather, I intend to highlight the
centrality of “calendar” as a unifying element or, in contrast, as a divisive fac-
tor, by focusing attention on the effect that calendar-controversy had on Jew-
ish society. I would maintain that this phenomenon has not been subjected to
the comprehensive scholarly investigation it deserves.
Let me begin my predominantly descriptive review by paraphrastically
quoting Emile Durkheim’s appreciation of the impact of a shared time-
schedule on societal life, as I did in previous publications.1 The French soci-
ologist rates the calendar as a most important factor of socialization, which
“expresses the rhythm of the collective activities while at the same time its
function is to assure their regularity.”2 By putting the stress on “collective

activities,” Durkheim correctly identiﬁed the “calendar” as a time-schema that
regulates societal life, the life of a structured “body politic.”
I venture to say that the characterization of calendar as a societal instrument
emerges already in the biblical traditions preserved in the ﬁrst chapters of the
book of Genesis. In the “constitutive era” of the history of humanity, the days
of Adam, Eve, and their descendants, time is not yet seen as a social phenom-
enon. The concept of time has solely a cosmic application. It is tied to the cre-
ation of the great luminaries, the sun and the moon, of day and night (Gen
1:14–19). In the ensuing traditions that pertain to antediluvian humanity, in
reference to the number of “years” ascribed to a patriarch, at the birth of his
ﬁrst son and at his death (Genesis 5), time takes on an “anthropological” di-
mension. However, a breakdown of the year into natural seasons or into days
and months in the life of humans is never given. These data do not apply in
an era of a not-yet fully stabilized cosmos.
The primeval creation came to an end, dissolved, so to speak, in the cosmic
ﬂood. That universe was supplanted by a new creation, the intrinsically differ-
ent postdeluge world of Noah, the second “ﬁrst man,” and his descendants.
Calendrical data according to days, months, and years are ﬁrst introduced in
the account of the “Great Flood” (Genesis 7–8), which marks the termination
of the cosmic “constitutive era” and the onset of the “history” of humanity.
In this “historical” world is set the forever-ﬁxed revolution of the sun and the
moon, the natural phenomena that rule “time” and are the bases of all reﬁned
calendrical computations: “while the earth lasts, seedtime and harvest, cold
and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall never cease” (Gen 8:22;
compare Jer 33:25–26). The incipient “historical” world is characterized by
the progressive differentiation of humanity into discrete societal structures:
families, clans, and peoples that occupy severally diverse areas of the earth
(Genesis 10–11).
In the “historical” world the societal propensities of “time” and “calendar”
are brought into full light. When applying Durkheim’s deﬁnition of the signi-
ﬁcation of calendar to speciﬁc political and/or religious organisms, we must
pay attention to the function of a common calendar as an indispensable instru-
ment for securing the internal unity of a given body politic and/or a religious
community, whereas calendrical nonconformity amounts to the most tangible
declaration of schismatic intention, which eventually hardens into the estab-
lishment of a sovereign sociopolitical and/or religious entity.
Some well-known instances exemplify the signiﬁcance of a nonconformist
calendar as a symbolic and, at the same time, a tangible indicator of political
and/or religious independence: from their inception, faith communities tend
to inaugurate a particular time schema and to perpetuate it in their ensuing
history. For such a community, its idiosyncratic calendar becomes a most con-

spicuous rallying point, serving at one and the same time internally as a cen-
tripetal unifying instrument, and externally as a centrifugal factor that sets it off
against other communities.
In the Western world, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam prove the point.
Each one in the past established its own peculiar calendar and adhered to it
continually, without fail. It will sufﬁce to illustrate the point by drawing atten-
tion to the introduction by Church authorities in the early second century of
a “heidenchristlich(e) version of Pesa˙/Easter aimed at accentuating the segrega-
tion of Christianity from Judaism.”3 The separation was further underpinned
by the decision of the Council of Nicea in 375, which forever riveted the date
of Easter to the 1st Sunday after the full moon in the ﬁrst month, never before
March 22 nor after April 25, thus effectively cutting it off from Pesa˙,4 ob-
served in the Jewish tradition on the 14th of the ﬁrst month (Nissan), which
can fall on any of four days—Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday but
never on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.
In the course of history, both Judaism and Christianity were subject to in-
ternal diversiﬁcation and were affected by calendar schisms. In the sphere of Ju-
daism, it will sufﬁce to mention the Samaritans and the Karaites. To this day,
the Samaritans gear their communal and individual pace of life to a particular
lunar calendar that effects an unbridgeable chasm between theirs and the Jewish
community. This is a demarcation line that cannot be crossed. Because of the
different calendars, the Samaritan sacriﬁce of the paschal lamb seldom coincides
with the Jewish Pesa˙, although both communities observe the festival on the
biblically prescribed date the 14th of the ﬁrst month. Similarly, the Orthodox
and Eastern churches celebrate Christmas, Easter, and Palm Sunday at times
that differ from those that obtain in the Western churches, although all depend
on the dates ﬁxed in the hallowed Scriptures. As aforementioned, in the past,
believers saw Muhammad as the founder of a new world order, just as the faith-
ful interpreted Jesus’ singular mission on earth as the onset of a new creation.
A comparable situation can be observed in the political arena. The nine-
teenth-century French revolutionaries made the foundation of their “new re-
gime” the launching pad of an equally new calendar, commencing on the

18th Brumaire 1798. In the twentieth century a similar attempt was made
after the Russian Revolution. In both instances, the initiators of the novel po-
litical structures conceived of them severally as new beginnings in history. In
all these cases the introduction of a time scheme was called for to set the “old”
world apart from the intrinsically “new.”
In modern times, the introduction of a new calendar as a symbol of “oth-
erness” is no longer feasible. Therefore, the quest for distinctive sociopolitical
separateness generated surrogate measures involving “time.” Let me mention
two recent cases. Before the reuniﬁcation with West Germany, the East Ger-
man government consistently maintained a difference of one hour between
their daylight saving time and West Germany’s. Similarly, during the “Inti-
fada” uprising, the Palestinian leadership signaled “independence” from the
Jewish state by introducing daylight saving time in East Jerusalem at a date that
differed from its introduction in the western part of the city and also by im-
posing on the Arab population a midday closing of shops at hours that did not
coincide with the “siesta” kept in the Jewish sector. These examples illustrate
the impact of calendar nonconformity on contemporary societies that base
their ephemeris on ﬁxed, objective astronomical observations and calculations
that exclude any possibility of deviation. In antiquity, premeditated dissent
had an even harsher and more acute effect on social entities. At that time cal-
endrical computations in the framework of a solar ephemeris were dependent
on the cycle of seasons and, in the lunar calendar, on direct observation of the
moon’s revolution. Those “practical” systems are prone to be affected by
changing natural conditions, such as rainfall or clouded skies.
In the orbit of Judaism, the inquiry regarding the calendar pertains to sev-
eral issues: (a) adherence to a solar, as against to a lunar calendar; (b) the im-
pact of the abidance by a solar or a lunar ephemeris on the reckoning of the
day, whether from morning to morning or from evening to evening; (c) the
synchronization of a lunar calendar with a solar one by systematic intercala-
tion; (d) regular periodic intercalation in a societal framework in which both
the Jewish lunar year of 354 days and the Qumran solar year of 364 days are
employed, because neither dovetails with the true solar year of 365 days and
about six hours.
The unifying propensity of a common calendar on the one hand, and the
disruptive impact of calendrical nonconformity on the other hand, can be il-
lustrated by bringing under scrutiny relevant instances in the history of Israel.
This leads to a short discussion of the calendar controversy between the
“Community of the Renewed Covenant”5 and mainstream Judaism at the
5. This is the most appropriate designation of the community predominantly called
“Qumran Sect,” “Essenes,” “Qumran Essenes,” and so on. See my “Community of  the

height of the Second Temple period, to which many texts from the Qumran
caves give eloquent testimony.
1. The earliest example of the disruptive effect of calendar divergence in Is-
raelite history is the cult and calendar reform carried out in ca. 900 b.c.e. after
the death of King Solomon by Jeroboam I ben Nebat, the founder of the
Northern Kingdom of Ephraim: “He observed the Feast of Tabernacles (Suk-
koth) in the eighth month, on the ﬁfteenth day of the month, like that in Ju-
dah [which was observed there on the ﬁfteenth of the seventh month] . . . and
sacriﬁced upon the altar in Bethel on the ﬁfteenth day of the eighth month, in
a month of his own choosing” (1 Kgs 12:32–33). The accusation that Jero-
boam invented the date of the prominent pilgrimage festival patently does not
hold water. Rather, it reveals the Judean author’s polemical interpretation of
his rebellious action. The very fact that ten out of twelve tribes unhesitatingly
accepted the apparent deferment of the major festival (1 Kgs 11:31) proves be-
yond doubt that Jeroboam reverted to time sequels with which they were
comfortable and which David’s and Solomon’s “unifying” administrative mea-
sures had thrown out of kilter. Jeroboam readjusted the date of that autumn
festival of the grape harvest to the climatic and the agricultural conditions that
obtained in the North of the land, where grains and fruits ripen approximately
one month later than in the South. Jeroboam actually reverted to tradition, as
reformers are wont to do; to quote Karl Marx, “The revolutionary is the
greatest consumer of precedents.” The different timing of the Festival of
Booths capped Jeroboam’s other actions, namely the reestablishment of the
ancient cult places in Bethel and Dan (1 Kgs 12:28–33; 13:32) as rival shrines
of the Temple of Jerusalem6 and the installation there of priests of his own
choice from the ‘elite of the people’ µ[h twxqm (1 Kgs 12:31–32; 13:33),
whom the Chronicler disparagingly designates ‘priests from the (common)
people’ twxrah ym[k7 µynhk (2 Chr 13:8–9). These procedures caused the
Ephraimites to turn north in their annual pilgrimages instead of to the Jerusa-
lem Temple situated to their south (1 Kgs 12:26–28). Thus, Jeroboam effec-
tively severed the political and religious union of Judah with the Northern
tribes that David and Solomon had achieved.

Jeroboam’s calendar reform did not cause only a onetime deferment of the
Sukkoth Festival. Rather, in the wake of his reform, all festivals in the cultic
year, foremost the pilgrimage festivals, were actually observed in the Northern
Kingdom one month later than in the Southern Kingdom. The different tim-
ing was in force until the days of Hezekiah of Judah—that is, for at least one
century and a half. The Chronicler reports that in his effort to reunite the ter-
ritory of the defunct Northern Kingdom with the realm of Judah, Hezekiah
“wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the house
of the Lord in Jerusalem to keep the Passover” (2 Chr 30:1). However, the lo-
cal population treated his messengers “with scorn and ridicule” (30:10), pre-
sumably because according to their calendar the invitation came much too
early, actually one month before the appropriate time. Therefore, in order to
persuade the northerners to acclaim Jerusalem as the central and exclusively
legitimate place of Yhwh worship, Hezekiah made an important concession
to them. The Chronicler reports that he decided to defer the Passover celebra-
tions in Jerusalem by one month: “The king and his ofﬁcers . . .  agreed to
keep the Passover in the second month” (30:2), which in fact was the ﬁrst
month in the Ephraimites’ calendar. As a result, “some men of Asher, Ma-
nasseh and Zebulun submitted and came to Jerusalem. . . . There was great
rejoicing in Jerusalem, the like of which had not been known there since the
days of Solomon” (30:11–26), after whose death Jeroboam’s cult and calendar
reform had dissolved the uniﬁcation of Judah and Ephraim.
Only three generations later, Josiah of Judah imposed by force the Judean
schedule of holy seasons on the population in the Northern territories and re-
aligned the Northern calendar with the Southern one: “Josiah kept Passover
. . . in Jerusalem . . . on the fourteenth (day) of the ﬁrst month. . . . The
people of Israel who were present (in the land) kept the Passover at that time
and the Matzoth festival for seven days . . . none of the kings of Israel had ever
kept such a Passover as Josiah kept” (2 Chr 35:1–18).
2. It appears that in the Middle Ages, a shared calendar at times was consid-
ered a factor that outweighed discordant basic tenets of faith over which Rab-
banites and Karaites were divided. In his description of the seventh-century
Karaite sect, led by Abu ºIsa al-Isfahani, the tenth-century historian al-Qirqisani
relates: “I asked (the Rabbanite) Jacob ibn Ephraim al-Shami, ‘Why do you
encourage association with the followers of ºIsa and intermarry with them, al-
though they attribute prophecy to men who are not prophets?’ He answered
me, ‘Because they do not differ from us in the keeping of the festivals.’”8 Qir-
qisani himself then mocks the Rabbanites who attach greater importance to the

observance of the festivals on the basis of a shared calendar than to profound
disagreements over issues of fundamental religious signiﬁcance.9
3. A special clause in medieval matrimony contracts between Rabbanite
men and Karaite women, as recorded, for example, in a marriage contract
from the Cairo Genizah (Cambridge T-S fragment 24.1),10 highlights the im-
portance of a common timetable of the holy seasons by which both parties
abide.11 In addition to the routine economic stipulations listed in the docu-
ment, the Rabbanite bridegroom, David Hanasi, son of Daniel Hanasi, evi-
dently a man of distinction, “also takes upon himself not to force his wife
Nasia to sit with him by the (light of the) Sabbath candle,12 or to eat the fat
covering the rump,13 or to desecrate her festivals,” which she is wont to keep
in accordance with the Karaite calendar, “under the condition that she (also)
observes with him the [viz., his] festivals.” The wife’s right to celebrate the fes-
tivals according to the Karaite calendar and her duty also to observe her hus-
band’s holy seasons on the dates ﬁxed in the Rabbanite cultic calendar are seen
as conditions which guarantee that peace will reign in their home.14 In con-
trast, the member of a community who from the outset does not observe the
festivals in accord with the schedule to which the community adheres will be
considered an outsider, nay a heretic. Equally, by not joining in the celebra-
tion of the hallowed seasons at the times ordained in his community, an origi-
nally full-ﬂedged, bona ﬁde member is bound to forfeit his membership.

12. In strict adherence to the biblical commandment “you shall not light a ﬁre in all
your homes on the sabbath day” (Exod 35:3), Karaite, like Samaritan law, forbids the use of
candles on the Sabbath even if they were lit before the onset of the holy day, in distinction
from rabbinic law, which allows it.

ºIsunians should indeed have kept a solar calendar. Or, shall we say that, like the Mishawites
. . . they, too, adhered theoretically to a solar calendar, but resigned themselves to the Rab-
binic system as far as actual practice was concerned?”

Shemaryahu Talmon

4. In a tradition variously ascribed to Sages of the ﬁrst, second, or third gen-
eration,15 the adherence to a solar calendar is held up as a crucial criterion that
separated non-Jews from Jews: “Once a pagan asked R. Johanan ben Zakkai
[end of ﬁrst century c.e.]: ‘we have kalenda, saturnalia and kartosis; and you
have Pesa˙, aºseret [Pentecost] and Sukkot. [When you rejoice we do not re-
joice; and when we rejoice you do not rejoice.]16 When do we both together
rejoice?’ Said R. Johanan ben Zakkai to him: ‘On a day on which rains fall.’”17
5. Communities that are deprived of political sovereignty, as Judaism was at
the height of the Second Commonwealth and after its destruction, are espe-
cially apprehensive of the danger, lest the adherence to an unconformable cal-
endar would trigger religious schism and societal secession. Lacking coercive
instruments for safeguarding national unity and effective punitive measures for
dealing with recalcitrants, internal cohesion depended upon the voluntary sub-
mission of all members of the community to the rulings of the socioreligious
authorities and on the unconditional submission to the rules of the established
communal institutions. The cultic and civic authorities in Jerusalem rightly
considered the acceptance of their decisions regarding the ﬁxing of the dates of
the sacred seasons throughout the year a sine qua non afﬁrmation of member-
ship in the community and an indispensable instrument of self-government.
This matter is the intrinsic subject of a controversy between two sages of the
second generation of Tannaªim, the president of the Sanhedrin, Rabban Ga-
maliel the Elder, and the highly esteemed Rabbi Joshua (m. Ros Has. 2:8–9).
At that time the dating of the annual holy seasons was ofﬁcially determined on
the basis of the actual sighting of the new moon,18 especially in the month of
Tishre, considered the ﬁrst month of the year, although astronomical compu-
tations of the moon’s orbit were already known and practiced (ibid.; cf. b. Ros
Has. 25a). The discovery of an astronomical measuring instrument at Qumran
proves that computations of the revolution of the sun were also known.19

with it the onset of the new cultic year on the strength of the afﬁrmation by
two men that they had espied the new moon. Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas, an-
other prominent sage, declared these men to be false witnesses because his
own observations indicated that the moon was still full. He used a simile to
prove them liars: “How can one say (today) of a woman that she has given
birth, and on the next day she is still visibly pregnant?” R. Joshua also invali-
dated their claim and presumably demanded that the proclamation of the new
moon be deferred. But Rabban Gamaliel stood by his decision, evidently ap-
prehensive that his acquiescence in R. Joshua’s dissenting opinion might cause
a rift in the community, with one party abiding by his ruling, the other ﬁxing
the dates of the holy seasons in accord with R. Joshua’s opinion. In order to
forestall such a possibility, he ordered R. Joshua to present himself in Jabneh
on the day on which, according to his computation, the Day of Atonement
would fall, ostentatiously carrying his staff, his food bag, and his purse, thus
publicly desecrating his Yom Hakkippurim, the holiest day in the cultic year.
R. Joshua bowed to Rabban Gamaliel’s authority, acted as ordered, and thus
the unity of the community was preserved.
The above report vividly illustrates the appreciation of decisions pertaining
to the calendar as a signal manifestation of the power invested in the Sanhedrin
and its president. It shows that the decrees of this body in respect to the
progress of the cultic and the civic year were not necessarily dependent on ac-
curate astronomical computation. Rather, they were understood as expres-
sions of the commonly acknowledged sovereign status of this institution in
decisions regulating the life of the individual and the community. The High
Court’s rulings concerning private and public conduct were ﬁnal and binding,
irrespective of whether they were accordant or discordant with cosmic data.
Even if it should transpire after the fact that the court had erred in its judg-
ment, its decree was still upheld: “if they [the members of the Sanhedrin] hal-
lowed the new moon, and subsequently the witnesses were found to have
been in conspiracy [to have intentionally misled them], it is still hallowed . . .
or if they erred, it is still hallowed” (ibid.; cf. t. Ros Has. 2.1).20

calendar. The issue of calendar conformity and calendar controversy assumed

solar calendar and the mainstream community, which abided by a lunar calen-
dar. The books of 1 Enoch and Jubilees witness the vehement solar-versus-lunar-
calendar dispute in Judaism at the height of the Second Temple period. The
authors of the apocryphal books never cease to propagate the exclusive legiti-
macy of the 364-day solar calendar, nor do they tire of disavowing the 354-day
lunar calendar by which mainstream Judaism abided. However, since the Sitz
im Leben or Sitz in der Geschichte of 1 Enoch and Jubilees could not be unequiv-
ocally identiﬁed, the calendar controversy was viewed as a theoretical or scien-
tiﬁc-astronomical issue rather than as a practical, down-to-earth discord, which
in fact caused a profound rift in Jewry of the time. Only after the discovery of
the Qumran scrolls did the presumably historical reality of the dispute come
into full view. The overriding importance that attaches to “proper chronology”
in the world of ideas of the “Community of the Renewed Covenant” is
evinced by fragments of over 20 calendrical works (4Q317–330, 335–337;
6Q317), the tailpiece of a calendar preserved as the suggested opening of Miq-
ßat Maºa¶e-Hatorah (4Q394); calendar-related references in the Covenanters’
foundation documents: Rule of the Community (1QS), Damascus Document
(CD), Pesher Habakkuk (1QpHab), Psalms Scroll (11Psa), Songs of the Sabbath Sac-
riﬁce (4Q400–407; 11Q17), a more-detailed exposition in the Temple Scroll
(11Q19–20); and other works, such as Otot (4Q319) and the Commentary on
Genesis Apocryphon (4Q252; 4QcommGenA), all presuppose this calendrical
system. The ya˙ad’s messianic-millenarian expectations depended on a divinely
appointed sequence of periods in history, deﬁned by the term µyxq/≈q, as in
µymlw[ yxq ‘world’ or ‘eternal periods’ (Hodayot 1QH IV 16; War Scroll 1QM
33 I 8–9); la yxq ‘divine(ly determined) periods’ (Pesher Habakkuk, 1QpHab
VII 12–13); jxn yxq ‘eternal periods’ (1QH I 24–25), and similar phrases, cul-
minating in the ‘cut-off period’ and the establishment of the fervently awaited
‘new (age)’ hçdj twç[w hxrjn ≈q (1QS IV 25).21 In this schema of periods,
the disappointing present is totally rejected, and the memory of an idealized
past is injected into the vision of a projected ideal future.
The considerable number of calendrical records and statements attest to the
exceeding signiﬁcance of matters calendrical in the Covenanters’ everyday life,
and even more so in the life of the members of the priestly hierarchy, because
the efﬁcacy of ritual acts and the correct execution of legal rulings are subject
to precise timing. From early on in the study of the Qumran documents, I
have maintained that the adherence to a 364-day solar calendar was the crucial
factor that precipitated the ﬁnal break-away from mainstream Judaism of the
“Community of the Renewed Covenant,” whose members deposited these
documents in the caves.

In his book A Time to Tear Down and a Time to Build Up: A Rereading of Ec-
clesiastes, Michael Fox mentioned his preparations for a commentary on the
book of Ecclesiastes, to be published by the Jewish Publication Society.1 Be-
cause the book in which that statement appeared already contained a substan-
tial commentary on the book of Ecclesiastes, one could not help wondering
how the projected work would differ.2 As if anticipating this question, Fox
explained that the new book would include “a deeper engagement with tra-
ditional Jewish exegesis, as well as some thoughts on the signiﬁcance of the
book to the modern Jewish reader.”3 This essay explores the role of commen-
taries within the contemporary Jewish community. I am honored to dedicate
it to Michael Fox, with deep gratitude for his friendship and support, which
have extended over many years.
From 1929 to 1936, Joseph Hertz, who was then Chief Rabbi of the United
Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire, published an edition of the Pen-
tateuch for synagogue use.4 Hertz intended his book to be a practical aid with
which worshipers could follow the Torah as it was being read in the syna-
gogue.5 The text was, therefore, divided according to the Sabbath morning
1. Ecclesiastes (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2004).
2. The format is similar to Fox’s works on other biblical books, such as The Song of Songs
and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1985);
Qohelet and His Contradictions (Shefﬁeld: Almond, 1989); and Character and Ideology in the
Book of Esther (Columbia: University of South Carolina, 1991; 2nd ed.; Grand Rapids:
Eerdmans, 2001). His Anchor Bible volume on Proverbs 1–9 (AB 18A; New York: Double-
day, 2000) is a freestanding commentary.

to 1936 by Oxford University Press. A one-volume edition appeared in 1938 at the insti-
gation of Soncino Press; see Harvey Meirovich, A Vindication of Judaism: The Polemics of the
Hertz Pentateuch (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1998) 168.

lections, each of which was followed by the traditional prophetic selection (haf-
tara). Alongside the Hebrew text was an English translation (although the ear-
liest printings used the Revised Version, that was soon replaced by the Jewish
Publication Society’s 1917 edition6), with explanatory notes underneath. These
often responded to the views of contemporary biblical scholarship, which the
Chief Rabbi thought undermined the authority of Jewish Scripture.7 To ac-
complish this, Hertz drew on the work of numerous scholars, both Christian
and Jewish; however, his message throughout was clear: the teachings of the
Jewish Bible are equal to the very highest values of Western culture and far bet-
ter than scholars usually suggest.8
For over ﬁve decades, Hertz’s edition of the Pentateuch was the commentary
on the Bible among English-speaking Jews, many of whom did not always dis-
tinguish the rabbi’s notes from the words of Scripture. However, with the dra-
matic changes that have taken place in Jewish life over the half-century since it
was published, Hertz’s comments began to seem dated. So in 1981, the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations, the umbrella organization for the Ameri-
can Reform movement, published a commentary of its own.9 Compiled by
W. Gunther Plaut, a leading ﬁgure in the Reform rabbinate, The Torah: A Mod-
ern Commentary10 included contributions from Rabbi Bernard Bamberger11
and an introductory essay to each book of the Torah by William Hallo, an em-
inent Assyriologist from Yale who had taught at the Reform movement’s He-
brew Union College from 1956 to 1962.12 The commentary’s format was

Pentateuch associated with the name of Wellhausen is a perversion of history and a desecra-
tion of religion” (Pentateuch, vii).

any other nation” (ibid., 403, emphasis in original); cf. Harvey Meirovich, “Reclaiming

Pentateuch, 404–6). For Hertz’s views on the Bible’s contribution to Western civilization,
see p. 929 and the note on p. 42.

much the same as that of Hertz: each page contained both the Hebrew text and
an English translation as well as a set of comments. At the end of each section,
Plaut offered extended discussions on topics of particular interest or rele-
vance.13 These were followed by a selection of “Gleanings,” which provided
quotations from a wide range of sources (both Jewish and non-Jewish) relating
to the contents of that section.
Plaut’s volume differed from Hertz’s in several notable respects. The most
conspicuous of these were matters of form. Where the earlier commentary
had been bound like a Hebrew book, opening from the right, Plaut’s volume
was made available in both a Hebrew and an English format that began at the
left. In addition, the Hebrew text was printed with only consonants and vow-
els, but not the accent marks (“trope”) that indicate the melody to be used
when chanting the Torah during Jewish worship. Both of these characteristics
corresponded to Reform practice. The movement’s newly published prayer
books had also been published in both English- and Hebrew-opening formats,
while the Torah was more often read than chanted in Reform synagogues.14
(Tellingly, the accent marks were added in a subsequent printing.)
On a more substantive level, the text itself was divided into “topical” units,
based on the subjects covered in a particular passage, rather than in accordance
with the traditional weekly portions (parashot), although these were identiﬁed
both within the text and in the running heads. Thus, a single parasha might
extend over several sections, even as individual sections could include passages
from more than one parasha.15 (Remarkably, the Ten Commandments were
actually divided into several sections.16) This feature, too, reﬂects typical Re-
form practice, in which only a selection from each week’s lection is usually
read in the synagogue.17 Further weakening the visibility of the traditional
lections, the haftarot were gathered at the end of each biblical book rather than
being printed after the Torah portion with which they are read, as Hertz had
done; moreover, these were given only brief introductions, describing the bib-
lical books from which they were taken, rather than the full set of comments
provided for the Torah.18 As a result, the haftarot appear to be something of an

14. As acknowledged in Plaut (Torah, xxxv), perhaps to justify omitting the trope marks;
however, there are several comments that take note of them (e.g., pp. 262, 1163, 1366,
1558).

afterthought, as, indeed, they often are in Reform worship, where they are
typically read only during Bar or Bat Mitzvah services.
The commentary’s contents also ﬁt the community that produced it. As a
product of the most worldly and most Americanized of the major Jewish
movements, these draw extensively and explicitly on non-Jewish sources. For
example, the homiletical excerpts that offer meanings one might draw from
various passages include quotations from Virgil, John Bunyan, and Roger Wil-
liams, as well as the Protevangelium of James, the Qurªan, and the Epic of Gil-
gamesh.19 The comments themselves draw connections between Jewish and
non-Jewish culture. Thus, they compare rabbinic law to American law,20 trace
the origins of Thanksgiving to Sukkot,21 ﬁnd biblical roots for an image in
“The Battle Hymn of Republic,”22 and note allusions to the Bible’s Urim and
Tummim in both the Yale University seal and the name of an Israeli kibbutz.23
Equally reﬂective of its readership is the commentary’s concern to distinguish
premarital sex from adultery24 and its several references to mixed marriage.25
Perhaps out of deference to its audience, the commentary describes the biblical
story about Zimri and Cozbi (Numbers 25) as warning against ritual prostitu-
tion rather than mixed marriage.26 Christianity serves as a point of reference
throughout the book.27 In addition to distinctively Christian interpretations of
several speciﬁc passages,28 there are comments about its shifting the day of rest
from Saturday to Sunday,29 its attitude towards the Jewish dietary laws,30 and
an observation about rabbinic and ministerial remuneration.31
Unlike Hertz, Plaut does not hesitate to criticize halachic principles.32 He is
also far more entranced with contemporary scholarship than his predecessor,

who tried to defend the Bible from its conclusions. This is immediately evident
in Plaut’s free use of such terms as “Heilsgeschichte”33 and “Tetrateuch,”34 as
well as his numerous comparisons of Hebrew and German grammar.35 He
clearly accepts the approach of contemporary biblical scholarship and endeavors
to inform his readers of its conclusions. Thus, he routinely identiﬁes the hypo-
thetical sources to which individual passages in the Pentateuch are attributed.
He also describes many ﬁndings of modern archaeology. In conformity with
the scholarship of the day, these are typically said to support the biblical account,
albeit with occasional qualiﬁcations. This perspective is extended to the rela-
tionship between the Bible and the ancient Near East in general, which is most
often invoked to demonstrate the superiority of biblical values. This is espe-
cially noticeable in the essays that precede each biblical book, where the Bible
is portrayed as part of the world from which it emerged but with teachings that
are superior to those of contemporary cultures.36 To do all this, Plaut draws on
numerous Christian scholars, including Rudolf Otto37 and Gerhard von Rad,
placing the latter’s interpretation alongside that of the ﬁfteenth-century Jew
Isaac Abarbanel.38
In 1993, ArtScroll, an Orthodox publishing venture that had already pro-
duced popular editions of several religious texts, 39 issued a ˙umash of its own.40
Unlike the other commentaries discussed here, this was not the project of an
established religious organization but of the independent, albeit Orthodox,
Mesorah Heritage Foundation. However, among the people involved were
several leading ﬁgures of the “modern Orthodox” establishment. For example,
Immanuel Jakobovits, who occupied the position once held by Joseph Hertz,
served as a trustee. In addition, the editors acknowledge the support of former
Yeshiva University president Norman Lamm, and Pinchas Stolper, Executive
Vice President of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.

They also mention having had access to the notes of Rabbi Joseph Soloveit-
chik, spiritual leader of the modern Orthodox community in America, where
he is known as simply the Rav.41
The ArtScroll format is essentially the same as the format of both Hertz and
Plaut, with an English translation and commentary alongside the Hebrew text.
In addition, each page includes the Aramaic Targum and Rashi’s Hebrew
commentary, both in their original languages.42
Unlike the other editions considered here, which incorporate the 1985
Jewish Publication Society rendering, this volume uses its own translation,
presumably on account of the Orthodox community’s discomfort with that
version.43 Among the hallmarks of its translation is the use of “HaShem” to
render the Tetragrammaton, in accordance with widespread Orthodox prac-
tice.44 Equally distinctive is the reproduction of words in transliteration whose
meanings are considered uncertain. Most often these are technical terms, such
as tzaraas, which the translators take pains to point out is not the disease that
is today called leprosy.45 Similar treatment is accorded several of the forbidden
species listed in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14.46
According to its introduction, the “translation in this volume attempts to
render the text as our Sages understood it,”47 in other words, to follow rab-
binic tradition with regard to the text’s meaning. This approach is apparent
throughout. For example, yba dba ymra (Deut 26:5), which is generally under-
stood as meaning ‘my father was a wandering Aramean’, is instead rendered,
‘an Aramean tried to destroy my forefather’.48 Likewise, the commandment
that a harvest offering be brought, beginning tbvh trjmm (Lev 23:11, literally,
‘from the day after the Sabbath’), is translated ‘on the morrow of the rest
day’.49 Other idiosyncratic renderings include the treatment of µjr (Gen

20:18) as ‘oriﬁce’ rather than ‘womb’50 and twyj (Exod 1:19) as ‘experts’ rather
than ‘lively’.51
The commentary is also based on traditional Jewish interpretations. More-
over, its sources, which span Jewish history, are consistently identiﬁed. As a
result, the book gives the impression of being a veritable digest of Jewish un-
derstandings, with Rabbi Nosson Scherman less the “author” of this work, as
he describes himself,52 than its “editor.”
Unlike both Hertz and Plaut, in ArtScroll no Gentile sources are named.
Nor, for that matter, are there any modern liberal scholars, however highly re-
spected.53 Especially conspicuous is the absence of any reference to either the
Hertz or the Plaut volumes, although it is hard to believe that the compilers
were unaware of these widely used works. In fact, there is no reference to
modern biblical scholarship.54 Nor are prevailing scholarly views about the
Bible, such as the presence of two creation stories or the relationship between
the story of Noah and the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, either challenged
or described. Even the occasions on which classical Jewish commentators,
such as Abraham Ibn Ezra (whose works are frequently cited in the commen-
tary), present similar ideas are utterly ignored.55
Predictably, this ˙umash entertains no doubt about the historicity of the
events recounted in the Torah in the way that both Plaut and Etz Hayim do.
Instead of saying this in so many words, the commentary makes the same
point by routinely offering the dates on which the various events described in
50. “The punishment for the abduction of Sarah was that the bodily oriﬁces of all
Abimelech’s people became closed. They could not relieve themselves or give birth until
Abraham prayed for them” (Scherman, Chumash, 95); so Gen. Rab. 52:13, cf. b. B. Qam. 92a.
51. Scherman, Chumash, 295; so Rashi; cf. Targum Onqelos, ad loc.
52. Scherman, Chumash, xvii–xviii. In this, the commentary resembles The Soncino
Chumash (ed. A. Cohen; London: Soncino, 1947), which was a result of the popularity of
the Hertz commentary, which had been published by the same house, thereby, co-opting
the need for a contemporary commentary in that series.
53. B. Barry Levy notes the absence of references to Abraham Heschel and Martin Bu-
ber, as well as Orthodox authorities such as Abraham Kook, Nehama Leibowitz, and
Menahem Schneerson (“Judge Not a Book by Its Cover,” Tradition 19 [spring, 1981]) 91.
54. The only exceptions are its description of David Zvi Hoffmann as having “refuted
revisionist Bible Criticism” in the list of authorities (Scherman, Chumash, 1298) and the ob-
servation that “the attitude of one who approaches a book as the immutable word of God
is far different from that of one who holds a volume that was composed by man and
amended by others over the years” in the preface (xviii).
55. As in Abraham Ibn Ezra’s hints about the authorship of the Pentateuch and Rash-
bam’s interpretations that contradict halakah; the one exception to this is the reference to
Ibn Ezra’s comment on Gen 36:31 (Scherman, Chumash, 196).

the text took place.56 There is even a chart, which collates all this data as it
pertains to the various accounts.57 To be sure, the fundamental historicity of
the biblical account was also a key tenet for Hertz;58 but for him, this was a
position to be defended, whereas in ArtScroll it is simply assumed.
In fact, the commentary itself is studiously nonmodern. Even a map illus-
trating the boundaries of Israel is attributed to medieval and early modern rab-
bis rather than modern geographers.59 Likewise, the topics addressed appear
most often to be of antiquarian rather than contemporary interest. Thus, there
are illustrations of the Tabernacle and its various implements,60 as well as in-
numerable charts and diagrams cataloging the various sacriﬁces required by the
Torah.61
The comments themselves lean toward the midrashic. For example, one
points out that the words for ‘male’ (vya) and ‘female’ (hva) differ in that the
former has the letter y in the middle while the latter ends with the letter h, not-
ing that these letters together spell out the name of God. This is said to dem-
onstrate what man and woman can become together. Conversely, the two
letters that these words share spell out the Hebrew word for ‘ﬁre’ (va), signal-
ing what is left when God is absent.62 Elsewhere, the mnemonic summaries of
the masoretic reports about the number of words and verses in each parasha are
glossed with comments drawing homiletical lessons from those data.
A similar homiletical interest can be discerned in the comments’ predilec-
tion for drawing moral and theological lessons from the biblical tales. Thus, the
pair Israel and Amalek, like Jacob and Esau, is said to epitomize good and
evil.63 In the same spirit, the story of Jacob’s sons is used to demonstrate the
dangers of playing favorites64 and to illustrate the fact that liars are never be-
lieved.65 In doing this, the commentary presents these stories in an almost

ahistorical light, lifting them out of the ancient Near Eastern world in which
they took place and which has become the focal point of so much of contem-
porary scholarship.66
Of special note is the commentary’s pervasively benign tone, especially
given Orthodoxy’s reputation for triumphalism. Although the comments ex-
press repeated concern with assimilation,67 at no point do they explicitly crit-
icize any of the (non-Orthodox) modern Jewish movements. Indeed, the only
group that is overtly challenged is the Karaites, a primarily medieval, antirab-
binic sect.68 As noted above, even biblical scholarship, which served Hertz as
a frequent target and which Plaut enthusiastically embraced, is largely ignored.
In fact, other than its underlying orientation, there is very little about this
book that marks it as being Orthodox. Rather, its most consistent bias is sim-
ply Jewish, as in its observation that “Jews have always been ready to make
sacriﬁces to raise their children among people of high moral caliber”69 or its
explanation about the dietary laws being required because “the Jewish people
have the capacity for spiritual life.”70 However, most often even this bias is
subtle. The only time it becomes explicit is when the comments complain
about the chapter numbers having been improperly placed by non-Jewish
printers;71 the translation is nonetheless structured in accordance with those
very same divisions.
The most recent of these commentaries was published by the Conservative
movement in 2001. Its title, Etz Hayim72 (‘tree of life’), is a phrase from Prov
3:18, which has come to be associated with the Torah scroll through its use in
Jewish liturgy.73

marriage on pp. 182 and 977.

Of the three commentaries considered here, Etz Hayim is by far the most
explicitly denominational. There are frequent references to Conservative
practice in its section on Jewish practice, which often cites the decisions of the
Conservative movement’s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. The his-
torical comments are abridged from a much larger commentary, written by
leading academics under the auspices of the Jewish Publication Society of
America. However, the Conservative movement has itself long been charac-
terized by a markedly academic orientation.74 Moreover, all the authors in this
section have some formal connection with the Conservative movement.75
Even its literary editor, novelist Chaim Potok, was a graduate of the Jewish
Theological Seminary of America.
The most conspicuous feature of this volume is its presentation of three,
ostensibly separate commentaries, printed one above the other on each page.
These present a straightforward (p’shat), a homiletical (d’rash), and a practical
(halakah l’ma-aseh) interpretation of the text. (Although Plaut and Hertz con-
tain similar material, they generally present it in the form of excurses to spe-
ciﬁc passages.) These separate commentaries do not always agree with one
another.76 Even more dramatic are the differences to be found among the 40
short essays that close out the volume.77 These explore a broad array of topics,
ranging from the academic (for example, “Biblical Archaeology” and “An-
cient Near Eastern Mythology”) to the pragmatic (for example, “Education”
and “Ecology”). It is here that one ﬁnds far more “radical” views than those
expressed in the actual comments, although content of this sort is the excep-
tion rather than the rule. The underlying diversity is also a hallmark of the
Conservative movement, whether it be viewed positively or negatively.

Tradition Renewed: A History of the Jewish Theological Seminary (ed. Jack Wertheimer; New
York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1997) 1:540; see also p. 537, and Mel
Scult, “Schechter’s Seminary,” in ibid., 59 and 67.
75. Nahum Sarna, who wrote the commentary on Genesis and Exodus (1989, 1991),
taught at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1957 to 1965, while Baruch Levine (Le-
viticus, 1989), Jacob Milgrom (Numbers, 1990), and Jeffrey Tigay (Deuteronomy, 1996)
are all JTS graduates.
76. Sometimes the comments disagree with the translation (e.g., Lieber, Etz Hayim,
466, 486, 797, 807, and 1226), as does Plaut (Torah, 194, 211, 422, 451, 460, 479). They
are also willing to acknowledge reliance on the Septuagint (e.g., Lieber, Etz Hayim, 106,
938, 944, 1062; cf. 275, 1179, 1186, 1193, and 1228), which the translators claim to ignore.
77. Thus one essay states that “women, as a rule, did not play political roles” (ibid.,
1356), whereas on the preceding page one reads that “at least two queens ran the govern-
ment” (p. 1355); see also p. 1363.

The appearance of these three volumes within a span of barely 20 years is
truly remarkable.78 After all, the Hertz commentary had been almost univer-
sally accepted within the Jewish community for over half a century. As a re-
sult, what once served as a unifying force has now come to be a point of
contention, with each of American Jewry’s three major religious movements
having a commentary of its own. Thus, synagogues can now choose the one
that best matches their own afﬁliation and ideological orientation.
Each of these commentaries reﬂects its respective community. Even their
choice of authors is telling. As we have already seen, the main commentators
in Etz Hayim are university professors,79 whereas W. Gunther Plaut is a pulpit
rabbi, although the introductory essay to each book in the Reform commen-
tary is by an academic. And the ArtScroll editors, though Orthodox, are gen-
erally afﬁliated with yeshivot rather than individual synagogues.
The content of these commentaries also mirrors their respective communi-
ties. Thus, the Reform movement emerges as fully engaged in the “larger”
world, the existence of which Orthodoxy strives mightily to ignore; on the
other hand, Conservative Judaism embraces an academic approach that toler-
ates a high degree of internal disagreement. With the publication of these vol-
umes, it seems that the Jewish community’s common commitment to Torah
has come to serve the interests of polarization and fragmentation that are so
widely decried within contemporary American Jewish life. It is, thus, surely
no accident that during the very years that these commentaries were being
published both the Conservative and the Reform movements changed the
names of their congregational unions in order to emphasize their denomina-
tional identities, with the United Synagogue of America becoming the United
Synagogue of Conservative Judaism (1992) and the Union of American He-
brew Congregations becoming the Union for Reform Judaism (2003). (Their
Orthodox counterpart has long been the “Union of Orthodox Jewish Con-
gregations of America,” with even its nickname—“the O-U”—alluding to
its denominational identity.) Now the commentaries used during worship re-
inforce these organizational titles in emphasizing their ideological differences.
78. There have been several others as well, for example, Aryeh Kaplan, The Living Torah
(New York: Maznaim, 1981); Avrohom Davis, The Metusdah Chumash (Hoboken, N.J.:
Ktav, 1991); and Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, The Jewish Study Bible (New York:
Oxford University Press, 2004).
79. However, the homiletical section was edited by Conservative congregational Rabbi
Harold Kushner, who is best known for pastoral works, such as Why Bad Things Happen to
Good People (New York: Schocken, 1981; 2nd ed., 1989) and the halachic commentary by
Elliot Dorff, the rector of the movement’s University of Judaism, and Susan Grossman, a
congregational rabbi.

At the same time, these volumes share several features that, although possi-
bly less dramatic, are more fundamental than their differences. The most con-
spicuous of these is their liturgically-based structure. Where worshipers in
Christian churches and an earlier generation of Reform synagogues would
typically be provided a complete Bible, all three of these volumes contain only
the Pentateuch (Torah). Moreover, none of them presents that text whole, but
each divides it according to the units traditionally assigned to be read on each
Sabbath. In Etz Hayim these Torah units are interspersed with the prophetic
selections (haftarot) that accompany them, just as they were in Hertz.80 The
ArtScroll commentary gathers these at the end of the volume, while Plaut puts
them after each of the Pentateuchal books; however, both volumes mark their
presence at the end of the appropriate Torah sections. Thus, all three identify
the haftarot in sequence along with the ones that are read on special Sabbaths
(along with an indication of the accompanying Torah portions).81 To these,
ArtScroll has even added the Five Scrolls (Megillos), which are read on various
holidays.82 In the end, then, none of these is an actual Bible but, rather, the
Bible as it is used in the synagogue. Reinforcing their liturgical character, all
three volumes include the blessings that are to be recited both before and after
Scripture is read.
Layout is another feature that these volumes share. In all three, the Penta-
teuch is printed in both Hebrew and English with explanatory comments on
the same page. This commonality should not be minimized, for it stands in
stark contrast with Christian practice, which provides only a translation. How-
ever, Jewish tradition has consistently honored the original text, whether or
not it is understood. As if to emphasize their recognition of the Bible’s He-
brew character, all three of these works are printed as Hebrew books, pro-
ceeding from right to left, though the Plaut commentary is also available in an
English-opening format. Paradoxically, this Jewish commitment to Hebrew
may have contributed to the need for volumes of this sort in the ﬁrst place:
because in many synagogues the Torah is simply read in Hebrew without
translation, these books provide the only way for worshipers to know what it
actually says.
80. Further minimizing the importance of the haftarot is the fact that each is given only
a brief introduction in the Plaut and ArtScroll volumes, typically identifying its source and
explaining its connection with the relevant Torah portion (but see n. 18 above). The com-
mentary to these haftarot in Etz Hayim is much more abbreviated than those for the Torah
itself.
81. According to the publisher’s introduction (Hertz, Pentateuch, viii), these haftarot
were added in the second (1960) edition.
82. Hertz had initially intended to include these (Meirovich, Vindication, 29–30).

Given this orientation, the use of English as the primary language for the
commentary is a noteworthy feature. Especially signiﬁcant is the presence of
an English translation in the ArtScroll volume, where it tacitly acknowledges
the linguistic limitations of Orthodox Jews.83 Moreover, the translation in this
volume generally adopts conventional English nomenclature, such as “Moses”
and “Isaac,” although there are occasional Hebraisms (for example, “Mal-
chizedek,” “Issamar,” and “Yoshiahu.”)84
The inclusion of a commentary also sets these volumes apart from their
Protestant counterparts, which enshrine that tradition’s preference for un-
adorned Bibles in conformity with its principle of sola scriptura. In all three
Jewish works, the comments serve conspicuously didactic ends, describing and
explaining a wide range of Jewish practices. This is particularly visible in Etz
Hayim’s halachah l’ma-aseh section; however, didacticism is also evident in the
Plaut and ArtScroll volumes, which use biblical verses as a kind of springboard
for excurses on Jewish concerns and, especially, Jewish observance. In Plaut,
these usually appear after the comments on an individual section, whereas
ArtScroll offers extended notes to speciﬁc verses. However this material is pre-
sented, all three volumes strive to educate their audience about topics that are
of speciﬁcally Jewish import. These range from the calendar85 (for example,
Passover86 and the Sabbath87) to worship (for example, teﬁllin,88 tsitsit,89 and
the Shemoneh Esrei 90) and ritual practices (for example, kashrut91 and ˙evra kad-
disha92). That these are addressed to a Jewish audience is clear from the occa-
sional use of the ﬁrst-person plural (“we”).93 Sometimes ArtScroll even refers

Sinai in the vessel of today’s vernacular” (Scherman, Chumash, xiii).

to the ancient Israelites as “Jews,”94 and all three volumes incorporate Hebrew
terminology, albeit typically in transliteration95 and sometimes even transla-
tion, in a way that presumes that Hebrew words will be recognized. Plainly,
the editors of all three works believe that their Jewish readership needs the
kind of basic Jewish education that these comments seek to provide.
Another commonality among these three books is the fact that all of them
include a variety of commentaries rather than a single, “correct” interpretation.
To be sure, only Etz Hayim actually prints several separate commentaries on
each page. (These are not as distinct as the format implies; comments in one
section frequently take approaches that are more appropriate to another.96) Al-
though ArtScroll provides just one set of notes, these routinely present multiple
interpretations for each verse, explicitly noting disagreements among tradi-
tional authorities.97 These are further distinguished by their identiﬁcation as
“the plain sense” and “homiletical” or midrashic interpretations.98 Plaut also in-
corporates a multiplicity of approaches, albeit not usually on the same page.99
Instead, his notes, which provide a straightforward explication of the text, are
followed by “Gleanings,” which take a more “homiletical” approach. In rec-
ognizing and tolerating this kind of diversity, all three volumes reﬂect the tra-
ditional Jewish openness to the possibility that Scripture can have several
meanings simultaneously.100
Also common to all three commentaries is their reliance on a range of
sources that extends from antiquity to the present day. Moreover, in so doing,
all three give preference to Jewish over non-Jewish sources. This is most con-
spicuous in the case of ArtScroll, which cites only Jewish authorities; however,
a similar tendency can be discerned in the commentary (though not the es-
94. Scherman, Chumash, 407 and 922.
95. E.g., Plaut, Torah, 271. All three commentaries occasionally use Hebrew font (e.g.,
Plaut, Torah, 1388); the lemmata in the ArtScroll Chumash are routinely printed in Hebrew.
96. For example, the p’shat commentary contains homiletical interpretations on pp. 102,
442, and 697 and halachic notes on pp. 393, 471, and 1106 (Lieber, Etz Hayim). For straight-
forward interpretations in the d’rash commentary, see pp. 129, 258, 804, 954, and 1020, and
pp. 80, 137, 140, 293, 294, 297, 393, 418, 528, and 1063 for halakic comments.
97. Note Rashi’s disagreements with Ibn Ezra as cited in Scherman, Chumash, 389; with
Nachmanides on pp. 209, 271, and 753; and with the Vilna Gaon on p. 816. Nachmanides’
disagreement with Maimonides is noted on p. 54, and with Ibn Ezra on p. 820. In this same
spirit, the map on p. 923 shows two different delineations of the borders of Israel, one ac-
cording to R. Eshtori ha-Farhi (fourteenth century) and the other according to R. Yehoseph
Schwartz (nineteenth century).
98. E.g., Scherman, Chumash, 10, 17, 89, 139, 145, 148, 165, 171, 376, 721, and 847.

says) in Etz Hayim.101 Even the comments that are based on the work of Gen-
tiles do so without identifying their source.102 As for Plaut, although he does
invoke ﬁgures from all manner of religious backgrounds, extending to both
pagan and Muslim sources, one can discern a preference for Jews here as well.
For example, he incorporates a wide variety of Jewish interpretations, ranging
from gematria to David Zvi Hoffmann.103 More signiﬁcantly, he is clearly sen-
sitive to Jewish concerns and scholarship, such as when he defends Yehezkel
Kaufmann’s understanding of the documentary hypothesis, which dates the
Priestly source prior to Deuteronomy, over the more prevalent view of Julius
Wellhausen, in which the sequence is reversed.104
Further evidence of these books’ Jewish orientation is evident in the topics
they address. Besides their interest in Jewish practice, there are numerous ref-
erences to anti-Semitism and the Holocaust.105 Plaut even provides an over-
view of the history of usury.106 So too is the modern State of Israel repeatedly
mentioned107 and alluded to more often, as in Plaut’s reference to Keren
Kayemet when explaining the Hebrew term ˆrq.108 This interest in contempo-
rary Israel may also be responsible for the use of Sefardic norms when translit-
erating Hebrew. Even the ArtScroll volume, which is written for an audience
that generally prefers Ashkenazi pronunciation, renders vowels according to the
101. The only non-Jews named are Jean Astruc (Lieber, Etz Hayim, 800 and 899), Hein-
rich Heine (p. 1088), both of whom were partially Jewish, John Milton (p. 20), and John
Steinbeck (p. 25)—all in the d’rash section.
102. For example, Lieber (Etz Hayim, 294), where the story of the elevation of Ephraim
and Manasseh is attributed to an effort to maintain a total of 12 tribes, a view that derives
from Martin Noth, Das System von der zwölf Stämme Israels (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1930).

on p. 413; they are implicitly referred to on p. 293 of Scherman, Chumash (regarding “the
‘Jewish problem’”), which expresses concern with Jews’ appearance before hostile rulers on
p. 240.

the land by means of purchase.” See also Plaut, Torah, 103, 254, 522, 557, 610, 688, 1031,
and 1511; and the reference to Jewish military ability in Scherman, Chumash, 985. Con-
temporary issues may also be reﬂected in the ArtScroll Chumash’s reference to the talmudic
comment that “the sages fault [Abraham] for using Torah sages to wage war” (p. 64, based
on b. Ned. 32a) and Plaut’s statement that Mt. Nebo “provides a good view of most of cen-
tral Israel” (Torah, 1582).

Sefardic (that is, modern Israeli) pattern, despite the fact that this sometimes
leads to rather odd forms.109 But the other volumes are not entirely consistent
on this, with forms such as Abib, Sukot, and Negeb in Plaut110 and y’shiva, m’no-
rah, g’nizah, k’tubbah, m’zuzah, and seider in Etz Hayim.111
Alongside their particularistic concerns, these commentaries ﬁnd a universal
element in the Bible’s message. The result can be paradoxical, as in the juxta-
position of ArtScroll’s belief that God’s rules extend to all humanity112 with its
repeated interest in the messianic return to “Eretz Israel.”113 The authors sup-
port this position by explaining that “the Torah is not a history book”114 but
“the eternal living monument of God’s rendezvous with Israel.”115 Thus, the
exodus from Egypt is described as “a seminal event in world history because it
demonstrated God’s mastery over nature . . . the textbook lesson for humanity
that God is not an aloof Creator.”116 Plaut echoes this sentiment when he
states that “the Torah is a book about humanity’s understanding of and expe-
rience with God,”117 which “doesn’t propose to teach antiquity as such but to
give religious instruction.”118
Surprisingly, all three commentaries tend to downplay their denomina-
tional identities, despite their institutional origins and intended use. To be
sure, these identities are not entirely absent. As we have already observed, Etz
Hayim repeatedly refers to Conservative practice, while Plaut notes several
Reform practices119 and frequently cites scholars from this movement’s He-
brew Union College.120 For its part, the ArtScroll commentary is full of cross-
references to related passages in other ArtScroll books.121 However, the titles

of all three of these books are denominationally vague, albeit explicitly Jewish
(The Torah: A Commentary; The Chumash; The Torah, Haftaros and Five Megillos;
Etz Hayim Torah and Commentary). This is particularly notable in light of the
increasing visibility of denominational identities; moreover, all three of these
books tend to avoid explicitly denominational terms when referring to matters
of disagreement. We have already observed the absence of partisan attacks in
the ArtScroll commentary. Likewise, Etz Hayim usually distinguishes the
Conservative position from “traditional,” rather than “Orthodox” Judaism,122
even as it is “very traditional”123 and “liberal” practice that Plaut sets against
one another.124
Finally, it should be emphasized that, whatever their own points of view, all
three are, in fact, acutely aware of the issues raised by modern biblical schol-
arship. As one would expect, this is most explicit in Plaut’s volume, with its
frequent references to the documentary hypothesis125 and discussions of both
historical problems126 and textual difﬁculties.127 Given the bluntness with
which these are expressed, it is remarkable that it was the publication of Etz
Hayim, which is typically more careful in raising questions about the presence
of both contradictions128 and anachronisms129 within the Bible, that attracted
far greater attention.130 It does, in fact, speak of the biblical text as being com-
posite131 and alludes to the documentary hypothesis.132 It also characterizes
the Bible’s statement about the number of Israelites in the desert as being “im-
possibly large,”133 describes the duration of their sojourn in Egypt as likely to
have been much less than the Bible’s 400 years,134 makes frequent reference
to ancient Near Eastern practice,135 and is willing to use ancient versions to

address textual problems, even noting cases in which the new Jewish Publica-
tion Society translation on which it comments may have done likewise, in op-
position to the translators’ stated mandate.136
What is most remarkable is the fact that even ArtScroll, which, as we have
seen, seems to skirt these sorts of topics, is plainly aware of their existence;
however, it justiﬁes dealing with them by attributing its insights and solutions
to rabbinic precedent.137 For example, like Etz Hayim, it concludes that the
Israelites spent signiﬁcantly less than 400 years in Egypt but bases this conclu-
sion on rabbinic tradition.138 It typically resolves chronological problems by
appealing to the rabbinic principle that Scripture is not arranged chronologi-
cally (hrwtb rjwamw µdqwm ˆya).139 A similar approach is used for contradic-
tions.140 For example, the fact that the name spelled Reuel in Num 2:14
appears as Deuel in Num 1:14 is resolved in conformity with a statement by
R. Moses ben Nahman141 and the Bible’s inconsistent terminology for God by
noting the rabbinic view that these terms allude to different aspects of the
deity.142 Familiarity with modern scholarship can also be seen in its reference
to the body of water that the Israelites crossed as the Sea of Reeds rather than
the Red Sea.143 Finally, Elijah’s apparent violation of a pentateuchal regulation
is attributed to a prophet’s right to override a commandment if circumstances
warrant.144 If the solutions to these problems are drawn from Jewish tradition,
the problems themselves stem from contemporary biblical scholarship.
Overall, whatever their distinctively Orthodox, Conservative, or Reform
characteristics, these commentaries have much in common, including their
preference for Hebrew terminology and their concern with questions of his-
tory and consistency. Like these books’ reliance on English and pedagogical
interests, these features suggest that their readerships are quite similar. This
should not be entirely surprising, inasmuch as the contemporary American
Jewish audiences to which these three are directed have all now had at least one

full generation in which to assimilate. This, after all, is the reason for these
books’ pedagogical concerns, just as it is the basis for the Orthodox commen-
tary’s including an English translation and just as the updating of the Reform
volume to incorporate the cantillation marks reﬂects the return to tradition that
also spans the late-twentieth-century American Jewish community.
In the end, whatever their denomination, Jewish worshipers are now likely
to ﬁnd an elaborate and lavishly produced ˙umash at their pew in almost any
American synagogue. Although these ˙umashim may have different publishers,
their structure and layout are likely to be strikingly similar, with the Hebrew
text at the top of the page alongside an English translation, while footnotes to
individual words and verses contain comments drawn from the Jewish tradi-
tion. As a result, these books can barely be distinguished on the basis of their
appearance. In this, all three movements now conform to the Jewish tradition
that the Bible should be read with a translation and interpretation, even if
these are not the targum and Rashi that the tradition calls for.145
This format, too, has a noble lineage within Jewish tradition, for it is the
same as the layout of the rabbinic Bibles (Mikraªot Gedolot), which were among
the earliest Jewish books printed.146 These also bring several, often conﬂict-
ing, interpretations together on the same page, with Rashi and Ibn Ezra, for
example, presenting totally different interpretations of the same word. Thus,
these seemingly competing commentaries share in both format and, to some
extent, purpose with each other and with numerous Jewish precedents. In
this, they are profoundly Jewish in ways that say much about the contempo-
rary American Jewish reality.
In the end, whatever differences these volumes may have, it is doubtful that
worshipers familiar with any one of them would be uncertain about how the
others should be used or would ﬁnd them without value. If the Reform com-
munity sits at the interface between Jewish tradition and the secular world,
which Orthodoxy has chosen to ignore while Conservatism strives to blend
both, the evidence gathered here suggests that the American Jewish commu-
nity’s much-vaunted “polarization” may be more a matter of style than of sub-
stance, of rhetoric rather than reality. These three commentaries are plainly
engaged in the same endeavor and even addressed to audiences that seem to

have more in common than what divides them, whether in language or the
longing to ﬁnd meaning within their own tradition.
Remarkably, all three movements have chosen to meet this need in the same
way—through the vehicle of a Hebrew-English commentary—something that
was not always available even a generation ago, when Orthodox synagogues
provided only the Hebrew text (albeit typically with Rashi’s commentary and
the Aramaic targum), and some Reform congregations provided their worship-
ers an English Bible. In this commonality, these volumes demonstrate the point
made by Gershom Scholem decades ago, when he observed that commentary
is “the characteristic expression of Jewish thinking about truth.”147 And so the
very desire to create commentaries also reﬂects a traditional Jewish approach
that spans the American Jewish community, further demonstrating that Ameri-
can Jews may not be not as different as they claim to be.
