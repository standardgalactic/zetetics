Ogba Educational Clinic
Promoting technology skills to empower Africa’s next generation

Education transforms.
Ogba Educational Clinic empowers 
Nigerian youth with an applicable, 
transformative education that equips 
them to make a tangible impact in 
Nigeria through 21st century jobs.
The failure of the current education system to prepare 
students for today’s technology-centric jobs leaves 
many unemployed – and vulnerable to the mounting 
threat of global cyber crime, which has a strong 
foothold in Nigeria.
With its transformative approach to education, Ogba 
Educational Clinic has launched graduates into growing 
tech fields, like software programming, robotics, cyber 
security, data science and system analysis, changing not 
only their futures, but the future of Nigeria. 

Global cyber fraud is a growing threat to at-risk youth, 
who are plagued with unemployment and ill equipped 
by their school system for 21st century careers. 
Scamming can be a lucrative alternative. 
1 in 4 Nigerian youth* is engaged 
in online scams or identify theft 
trades. 
In 2018, the U.S. charged 80 people (77 of them 
Nigerians)** in the “largest case of online fraud in U.S. 
history.” And, US authorities also accused business tycoon 
Obinwanne Okeke of stealing $11M in a single online scam. 
The BBC calls this challenge a “widening network of global 
cyber fraud.” 
“The antics of these fraudsters have come at a 
wider cost for most Nigerians, as students, 
business people and tourists are often subject 
to extra scrutiny from international payment 
platforms, potential business partners and 
embassies for visa applications.”
