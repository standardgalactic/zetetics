ABSTRACT
Background and Objectives: Although there is accumulating evidence for
an inverse relation between life meaning and psychological distress, little
is known about the mechanisms of this relation. Using cross-sectional,
observational methods, this research examined fear of uncertainty as
one potential mechanism.
Design and Methods: Study 1 (N = 141) was completed with a
convenience sample, a unidimensional measure of life meaning, and
general measures of anxiety and depression. Study 2 (N = 152) was
completed with a sample prescreened for anxiety, a multidimensional
measure of life meaning, and clinical measures of anxiety and
depression.
Results: The results from both studies generally showed an inverse
relation between life meaning and psychological distress. Study 2
further indicated that these relations were stronger for the meaning
subscale of perceiving life as coherent/comprehensible than the
subscales
assessing
whether
participants’ lives
are perceived as
purposeful or signiﬁcant. Mediation analyses in both studies showed
indirect eﬀects of life meaning on psychological distress through fear
of uncertainty.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings support and extend previous research by
showing
that
(i)
meaning-as-comprehension
may
be
particularly
important in regards to psychological distress, and (ii) fear of
uncertainty may mediate the inverse relation between meaning and
measures of anxiety and depression.

Introduction
The idea that life meaning plays a role in psychopathology and its treatment has a long history in
clinical psychology (Adler, 1929; Frankl, 1946/1959; Horney, 1950; Jung, 1928/1966). Although
there is increasing evidence for an inverse relation between life meaning and psychological dis-
tress (for a review, see Steger, 2012) and a growing interest in developing meaning-based inter-
ventions (Breitbart & Poppito, 2014; Schneider, 2008; Yalom, 1980), little is known about the
mechanisms of this relation. The current research examines fear of the unknown as a potential
mechanism.

Life meaning and psychological distress
Research on the role of life meaning in psychological distress has mostly relied on correlational
designs using self-report measures. Although ﬁrst-generation measures of life meaning often con-
sisted of unidimensional measures with items representing a number of meaning-related constructs,
the ﬁeld has begun to take a more diﬀerentiated approach to theorizing about and measuring life
meaning. Speciﬁcally, researchers have started to converge on a conceptualization of life meaning as
involving both an overall sense of whether life is meaningful and three components that contribute
to a sense of a meaningful life, including comprehension (coherence), purpose, and mattering (sig-
niﬁcance) (George & Park, 2016; Martela & Steger, 2016). Using the terminology of George and Park
(2016, p. 206), comprehension involves feeling “that one’s life makes sense, things seem clear in one’s
life, things in one’s life ﬁt together well, and things are as they ought to be,” purpose occurs when
individuals are “motivated by valued life goals” and involves “a sense of engagement with life” in
which individuals feel “pulled and directed toward their goals,” and mattering consists of individuals
feeling that “their existence is of signiﬁcance, importance, and value to the world.”
Research with ﬁrst-generation unidimensional measures has consistently shown that meaning is
inversely related with depression and anxiety, using both cross-sectional (Ishida & Okada, 2006; King
& Hicks, 2009; Steger et al., 2009) and prospective designs (Eakman, 2014; Ostaﬁn & Proulx, 2020a;
Schaefer et al., 2013; Scheﬀold et al., 2014). Cross-sectional research using a new multidimensional
measure has shown that comprehension, purpose, and mattering are inversely related with
depression and anxiety and that the comprehension scale showed the strongest eﬀects (George
& Park, 2017). Intervention studies have also demonstrated that meaning can reduce psychological
distress, though this research has mostly used indirect measures of distress. One study found that a
meaning aﬃrmation (about religious values in religious participants) before a Stroop task resulted in
a weaker aversive reaction to task errors indicated by neural response (Inzlicht & Tullett, 2010).
Another study found that compared to control, a meaning aﬃrmation (thinking about important
values) before a stressful task resulted in less post-stressor cortisol response (Creswell et al., 2005).
A third study showed that a meaning aﬃrmation (to socio-political values) before presentation of
playing cards with anomalous items resulted in a diminished arousal response to the anomalous
cards, indicated by pupil dilation (Sleegers et al., 2015). Recent research has shown that a brief
meaning intervention administered after a stressor can reduce stressor-related anxiety and rumina-
tion (Ostaﬁn & Proulx, 2020b). These experimental ﬁndings are supported by clinical research that
has found meaning interventions to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms (Breitbart et al.,
2010; Mohabbat-Bahar et al., 2014; for meta-analyses, see Kang et al., 2019; Vos et al., 2015).
Fear of the unknown as a common factor in psychological distress
Although there is increasing evidence for an inverse relation between life meaning and psychologi-
cal distress, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie this relation. Fear of the unknown
represents one potential mechanism that has long been proposed by existential thinkers. Following
Kierkegaard’s (1844/1980) initial ideas, existential philosophers (Heidegger, 1927/1996; Tillich, 1952)
and psychologists (Boss, 1962; Yalom, 1980) have proposed that the core of human existence is
characterized by the unknowable, which has been variously described (using English translations)
as the indeﬁnite (Heidegger, 1927/1996) or nothingness (Nietzsche, 1885/1961; Tillich, 1952) and
that this state involves inﬁnite possibility (Kierkegaard, 1844/1980). Importantly, this indeterminate
state elicits anxiety (Heidegger, 1927/1996; Kierkegaard, 1844/1980; Tillich, 1952). Further, responses
to the unknown can involve identiﬁcation with the meaning structures of one’s culture, with the
eﬀect that such involvement “covers over” the unknown (Heidegger, 1927/1996; Kierkegaard,
1844/1980) or opening to and facing the unknown, with the eﬀect of facilitating individualized, crea-
tive possibilities to live an authentic life (Boss, 1962; Heidegger, 1927/1996; Tillich, 1952). Although
such turning toward the unknown may increase anxiety, the unknown and attendant anxiety may be

relativized as a fundamental motivational force, replaced by personal growth, individualized
meaning structures, and the experience of vitality (Boss, 1962; Tillich, 1952; Yalom, 1980).
The idea of the unknown as pervading the center of human experience is found in more recent
philosophers (Dreyfus & Kelly, 2011) and cognitive scientists (Simon, 1987). Further, the idea that the
unknown elicits anxiety has been examined by psychology researchers. Speciﬁcally, a number
researchers deﬁne the unknown as occurring when there is insuﬃcient information for determining
the motivational relevance of a phenomenon and note that the aversive response to such states of
the unknown – and the attendant experience of uncertainty (the terms are used interchangeably in
this paper) – plays a central role in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (Barlow, 2002; Carleton,
2016; Gray & McNaughton, 2000; Grupe & Nitschke, 2013). For example, Gray’s model proposes
that anxiety is elicited by uncertainty related to perception and behavior – what a phenomenon
is and how to act in its presence (Gray & McNaughton, 2000; Hirsh et al., 2012). Research shows
that anxiety and anxiety disorders are related with an excessive negative response to uncertainty
using self-report (Carleton et al., 2012) and psychophysiological (Grillon et al., 2008) methods. Car-
leton (2016) goes as far as to argue that fear of uncertainty is the most fundamental fear that con-
tributes to anxiety. Recent research provides initial evidence that fear of uncertainty is indeed more
strongly related to anxiety than other candidate fundamental fears (Papenfuss & Ostaﬁn, 2021). In
addition to anxiety, there is evidence that aversive response to uncertainty is related to other
emotional disorders such as depression (for a meta-analysis, see Gentes & Ruscio, 2011).
Carleton’s (2016) model of an evolutionarily old system via which the unknown elicits anxiety is
aligned with the perspective that basic emotion systems are activated by typical categories of stimuli
and that although emotions were selected because they increased adaptation, aberrant response of
these emotion systems contributes to psychopathology (Panksepp, 2001). Whether emotions are
functional and contribute to adaptation or aberrant and contribute to psychopathology is inﬂuenced
by contextual factors such as genetics (Aleman et al., 2008) or learning (Chorpita & Barlow, 1998). The
presence of life meaning represents another factor that may inﬂuence response to the unknown.
Life meaning as an antidote to the unknown
Echoing the existential idea that meaning can “cover over” the unknown (Heidegger, 1927/1996),
Hirsh and colleagues (2012) note that goals, and especially the integrated goal hierarchies of a
meaning structure, can constrain perceptual and behavioral uncertainty. The comprehension sub-
construct has similarly been proposed to reduce the amount of uncertainty experienced by the indi-
vidual (George & Park, 2016; Martela & Steger, 2016). In addition to reducing the amount of
uncertainty, life meaning may also relativize the motivational salience of uncertainty. Speciﬁcally,
reductions in the amount of uncertainty may lead to less defensive fear response to uncertainty
when it occurs. For example, hearing unexpected and strange noises in the attic would likely
elicit less anxiety if the noises occurred during the daytime with others around versus late at
night while one is alone. A reason for this may be that the former situation has less perceptual
and behavioral uncertainty, as the presence of daylight aﬀords gathering information regarding
the source of the sounds and the presence of others aﬀords resources for adaptive response (e.g.,
greater likelihood of exploring the source of the sounds; help in the case of an intruder). Evidence
that the amount of uncertainty inﬂuences aversive response to uncertain events is provided by
ﬁndings that defensive response (i.e., startle reﬂex) to an unpredicted aversive stimulus (i.e.,
startle probe) is greater in conditions of uncertainty. For example, eliciting an uncertain context
by placing participants in a dark (vs. lit) room leads to greater startle to unpredicted noise blasts
– but not to noise blasts for which the participant is ﬁrst prepared (i.e., by a weaker auditory stimulus
presented before the startle probe) (Grillon et al., 1997, 1998). Evidence is also shown in aversive con-
ditioning tasks that involve predictable and unpredictable conditions regarding the presentation of
electric shock. Startle response to unpredicted noise blasts is stronger in the unpredictable context
than in the predictable context (Grillon et al., 2004; Papenfuss et al., 2021). These lines of research

indicate that when there is more uncertainty, individuals have a greater negative response to uncer-
tain aversive events. Given that a meaningful life is typically one that is coherent and thus one in
which uncertainty is constrained (George & Park, 2016; Hirsh et al., 2012), individuals with more
meaning may subsequently have weaker fear responses to uncertainty.
Current studies
Although there is a growing evidence base for the inverse relation between life meaning and psycho-
logical distress,littleis known aboutthemechanisms ofthis relation. The current studies were designed
to examine a model in which fear of the unknown mediates the meaning-distress relation. Study 1
tested this research question with undergraduate students using a unidimensional measure of life
meaning (Steger et al., 2006). Study 2 tested the question with a sample that was prescreened for symp-
toms of anxiety andused a newer,multidimensionalmeasure of life meaning that assesses comprehen-
sion, purpose, and mattering(George & Park, 2017). Both studies tested the hypotheses that meaning is
inversely related with anxiety and depression (H1) and that the inverse relation is partially mediated by
fear of the unknown (operationalized with a fear of uncertainty measure) (H2). The Study 2 hypotheses
were preregistered on the As Predicted website (https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=t6qn2f).
Study 1
Participants and procedure
One hundred and forty-one undergraduate students (Mage = 20.09 years, SDage = 1.90) at a Dutch uni-
versity volunteered to participate as partial fulﬁllment of a class requirement. The majority of partici-
pants self-reported as female (n = 103) and either German (n = 74) or Dutch (n = 26) nationality. The
study was approved by the University of Groningen psychology department ethics review board
(approval number 16208-S-NE). This sample resulted in a power of .95 to detect a bivariate corre-
lation of .30. After signing an informed consent form, participants completed a packet of the
measures listed below.
Measures
Meaning in life
Life meaning was assessed with the Presence of Meaning scale from the Meaning in Life Question-
naire (Steger et al., 2006). The Presence of Meaning scale consists of ﬁve items (e.g., “I understand my
life’s meaning”) using a scale ranging from 1 (Absolutely untrue) to 7 (Absolutely true). The scale
demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .89).
Depression and anxiety
The Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983) was used to assess how much participants
were bothered by depression (six items; e.g., “Feeling blue”) and anxiety (six items; e.g., “Spells of terror
or panic”) symptoms over the previous month using a scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely).
Internal consistency was good for both the depression (α = .83) and anxiety (α = .84) scales.
Fear of the unknown
Fear of the unknown was assessed with the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale – short form (Carleton et al.,
2007), which consists of 12 items describing cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to uncer-
tainty (e.g., “Unforeseen events upset me greatly”; “When it’s time to act, uncertainty paralyzes me”)
rated on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all characteristic of me) to 5 (entirely characteristic ofme). Although
the scale consists of two subscales, there is evidence that the overall scale is more appropriate for asses-
sing the construct (Shihata et al., 2018). The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .87).

Data analyses
Statistical analyses for both studies were conducted with SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp., 2019). The
hypothesis that meaning is inversely related with anxiety and depression (H1) was tested with bivari-
ate correlations. The hypothesis that the inverse relations with anxiety and depression are mediated
by fear of uncertainty (H2) was tested with regression analyses using version 3.5 of the PROCESS
macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013).
Results
Correlation hypotheses
Bivariate correlation analyses (see Table 1) supported the ﬁrst hypothesis that life meaning is inver-
sely related with anxiety (small-to-medium eﬀect size) and depression (large eﬀect size). Table 1 also
demonstrates that meaning in life is inversely related with fear of uncertainty.
Mediation hypotheses
The second hypothesis was that fear of uncertainty would partially mediate the relation between life
meaning and psychological distress and this was tested with regression analyses in which depression
and anxiety (in separate analyses) were regressed on life meaning, with fear of uncertainty entered as
the proposed mediator. The top panel in Figure 1 illustrates that the relation betweenlife meaning and
depression was reduced when controlling for fear of uncertainty. Speciﬁcally, a bias-corrected boot-
strap 95% conﬁdence interval for the indirect eﬀect (β = −0.096) based on 10,000 bootstrap
samples did not include zero (−0.168 to −0.034), indicating a model in which the relation between
life meaning and depression is partially accounted for by individual diﬀerences in fear of uncertainty.
The bottom panel in Figure 1 illustrates that fear of uncertainty also partially mediates the relation
between life meaning and anxiety, as a bias-corrected bootstrap 95% conﬁdence interval for the indir-
ect eﬀect (β = −0.082) based on 10,000 bootstrap samples did not include zero (−0.154 to −0.026).
Given the cross-sectional nature of the data, the direction of the mediation model cannot be
determined. Although our theory proposes that the fear of uncertainty represents a mechanism
of the inverse relation between life meaning and psychological distress, it is possible that the direc-
tion goes the other way – that meaning could mediate the relation between fear of uncertainty and
psychological distress. We examined this possibility with post-hoc analyses in which fear of uncer-
tainty was entered as the predictor and life meaning as the potential mediator. The results
showed that meaning did not act as a mediator for the anxiety outcome but did act as a mediator
for the depression outcome (see Supplemental Table 1).
Discussion
The correlation results of Study 1 are consistent with previous research showing an inverse relation
between the Presence of Meaning scale and both anxiety and depression (Huo et al., 2019; Miller &
Rottinghaus, 2014; Steger et al., 2009). The current study extends previous ﬁndings by examining
fear of the unknown as a potential mechanism of the relation between life meaning and

psychological distress. The results support a model in which fear of uncertainty mediates the relation
between life meaning and both depression and anxiety.
Study 2 was designed to build on the ﬁndings of Study 1 in several ways. First, it assessed life
meaning with a multidimensional measure. George and Park (2016) have noted that older unidi-
mensional measures often assess subjective judgments about an overall sense of meaning (e.g.,
“my life is meaningful”) and that a beneﬁt of such measures is that they may reﬂect the partici-
pants’ experience of life meaning. However, because such measures allow participants to decide
what “meaning” means, these scales may have more noise (e.g., greater inﬂuence by aﬀective
states; Heintzelman & King, 2014). Additionally, unidimensional measures often include several
meaning-related constructs. For example, the Presence of Meaning scale includes items that
reﬂect the subconstructs of comprehension (“I understand my life’s meaning”) and purpose
(“My life has a clear sense of purpose”). Such measures are limited in their ability to examine
the extent to which comprehension, purpose, and mattering individually contribute to the
phenomenon of interest. Having such information would facilitate theory building and the devel-
opment of interventions. Study 2 thus used a recently developed measure of this more diﬀeren-
tiated operationalization of meaning.
Study 2 was also designed to extend Study 1 by increasing the clinical relevance of the methods.
For example, the use of a convenience sample in Study 1 may limit the ability to generalize the
ﬁndings to clinical populations. As a ﬁrst step in examining the relevance of the model for clinical
populations, Study 2 used a sample that was prescreened for elevated anxiety. In addition, although
the Study 1 depression and anxiety measures are widely used, they may be more valid as measures
of general psychological distress than for identifying clinically relevant symptoms (Recklitis et al.,
2017). Study 2 thus included measures commonly used in clinical research to assess symptoms of
depression and several anxiety disorders.

Study 2
Participants and procedure
Participants at a Dutch university were administered a pre-screening battery that included a 7-item
measure to assess anxiety (Spitzer et al., 2006). Participants who indicated elevated anxiety (≥8;
Kroenke et al., 2007) were recruited to participate in the current study. Of those invited, 152
(Mage = 20.48 years, SDage = 2.67) volunteered to participate as partial fulﬁllment of a class require-
ment. Of the six symptom measures used, three provide cutoﬀscores for clinical relevance. As
can be seen in Table 2, the mean scores of the sample indicated clinically relevant symptoms of
depression (scores of 20–24 representing mild depression [Olsen et al., 2003], mean score of 23.57
and 61.2% of sample with a score of 20 or more), worry (scores of 57 or more representing clini-
cally-relevant symptoms [Fresco et al., 2003], mean score of 58.76 and 61.2% of sample with a
score of 57 or more), and obsessive compulsive disorder (scores of 21 or more representing clini-
cally-relevant symptoms [Foa et al., 2002], mean score of 20.55 and 45.4% of sample with a score
of 21 or more). The majority of participants self-reported as female (n = 116) and either German
(n = 64) or Dutch (n = 39) nationality. The study was approved by the University of Groningen psy-
chology department ethics review board (approval number 18122-S). This sample resulted in a
power of .95 to detect a bivariate correlation of .30. After signing an informed consent form, partici-
pants completed a packet of the measures listed below.
Measures
Life meaning
Meaning was assessed with the Multidimensional Existential Meaning Scale (George & Park, 2017),
which consists of 15 items rated on a scale ranging from 1 (Very strongly disagree) to 7 (Very strongly
agree) to assess the following subscales: Comprehension (e.g., “I understand my life”), Purpose (e.g., “I
have overarching goals that guide me in my life”) and Mattering (e.g., “Even considering how big the
universe is, I can say that my life matters”). The aggregate measure of the scale demonstrated good
consistency, α = .92, as did each of the subscales: Comprehension α = .86; Purpose α = .92; and Mat-
tering α = .88.
Fear of the unknown
Fear of the unknown was assessed with the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale – short form (Carleton
et al., 2007), and demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .92).
Depression
Symptoms of depression were assessed with the Major Depression Inventory (Bech et al., 2001). This
questionnaire consists of 13 items (e.g., “Have you felt low in spirits or sad?”), with the overall sum
using 10 items (three items have two alternatives, with the higher score used in the sum). Partici-
pants rate how much they experienced the symptoms over the past two weeks with a scale
ranging from 0 (At no time) to 5 (All the time). The scale’s internal consistency was good (α = .90).
Worry
Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer et al., 1990). The ques-
tionnaire consists of 16 items (e.g., “I’m always worrying about something”), which participants rate
according to how much the statements are true for them on a scale ranging from 1 (Does NOT
describe me) to 5 (Describes me PERFECTLY). The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α
= .90).

Obsessive compulsive symptoms
Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder were assessed using the Obsessive Compulsive Inven-
tory – Revised (OCI-R; Foa et al., 2002). It consists of 18 self-statements describing symptom beha-
viors (e.g., “I check things more often than necessary”) that are rated on a scale ranging from 0
(not at all) to 4 (extremely) according to how much these behaviors have distressed the participant
over the past month. The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .84).
Panic and phobias
Symptoms of social phobia (10 items; e.g., “Giving a speech”), interoceptive fear (5 items; e.g.,
“Playing a vigorous sport on a hot day”), and agoraphobia (9 items; e.g., “Going through a car
wash”) were assessed with the Albany Panic and Phobia questionnaire (APPQ; Brown et al., 2005;
Rapee et al., 1994) using a scale ranging from 0 (no fear) to 8 (extreme fear), according to how
much fear is anticipated in case of an encounter during the following week. Internal consistency
was good for all three scales: Social phobia scale α = .89; Interoceptive fear scale α = .76; and Agor-
aphobia scale α = .77.
Data analyses
The hypothesis that meaning is inversely related with anxiety and depression (H1) was tested with
bivariate correlations ﬁrst with the aggregate score of the life meaning measure. As there were
several anxiety measures, a Bonferroni–Holm correction was applied to correct for a family-wise
error rate in the analyses with the ﬁve measures. Therefore, the smallest to largest p-values were
tested against alphas of .01, .0125, .0167, .025, and .05, respectively. In order to provide additional
information about the relation between life meaning and psychological distress, bivariate corre-
lations with the distress measures were tested with the individual scales of comprehension,
purpose, and mattering. The hypothesis that the inverse relations with anxiety and depression are
mediated by fear of uncertainty (H2) was tested with regression analyses using version 3.5 of the
PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013), ﬁrst with the aggregate score of the life meaning
measure and then with the individual scales.
Results
Main eﬀect hypothesis
The hypothesis that life meaning is inversely related with symptoms of anxiety and depression was
largely supported with bivariate correlations with the aggregate measure of meaning (see Table 2).
In addition to demonstrating a large eﬀect size inverse relation with depression, life meaning
showed medium eﬀect size inverse relations with a majority of the anxiety measures. Speciﬁcally,
results using the Bonferroni–Holm correction indicted that life meaning was inversely related with
social anxiety, p < .001, worry, p < .001, and interoceptive fear, p = .007, but not with agoraphobia
or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Table 2 also indicates that the aggregate life meaning measure
was inversely related with fear of uncertainty.
We also examined whether psychological distress was inversely related with the meaning-related
scales of comprehension, purpose, and mattering. As can be seen in Table 2, all three scales were for
the most part related with the psychological distress measures (i.e., 10 of the 15 correlations were
statistically signiﬁcant). We next conducted exploratory analyses to examine whether the subscales
predicted unique variance of fear of uncertainty and each of the psychological distress measures.
The unique variance question was conducted with regression analyses in which fear of uncertainty
and the distress variables were regressed on the three meaning subscales. As shown in Supplemen-
tal Table 2, the comprehension scale most consistently demonstrated unique relations, including
fear of uncertainty, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, social anxiety, and
ANXIETY, STRESS, & COPING

interoceptive fear. Mattering predicted a unique variance of the worry and social anxiety measures
and the purpose scale demonstrated unique variance only for the interoceptive fear variable.
Mediation hypothesis
The second hypothesis was that fear of uncertainty would partially mediate the relation between life
meaning and both depression and anxiety and this was tested with regression analyses, in which
depression and anxiety measures (in separate analyses) were regressed on the aggregate measure
of life meaning, with individual diﬀerences in fear of uncertainty entered as the mediator. The
results are illustrated in Table 3, which shows indirect eﬀects of the relation between life meaning
and all depression and anxiety measures through fear of uncertainty, indicated by the 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals for all indirect eﬀect measures not including zero. Of note, the indirect eﬀects
were observed even for the two anxiety measures that did not show bivariate correlations with
life meaning (agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder).
We also conducted exploratory analyses to examine whether the relation between the meaning
subscales and the psychological distress variables was mediated by fear of uncertainty. As above,
these analyses were conducted with the PROCESS macro, in which depression and anxiety measures
(in separate analyses) were regressed on each of the three meaning subscales, with fear of uncer-
tainty entered as the proposed mediator. As indicated in Supplemental Tables 3a-c, the results uni-
formly indicated that the relation of each of the psychological distress variables and each of the
meaning subscales was partly mediated by fear of uncertainty. We next examined the extent to
which the relation between each meaning subscale and psychological distress was mediated by
fear of uncertainty, while controlling for the other two meaning subscales (see Supplemental
Table 4). The results indicated that fear of uncertainty continued to mediate the relation between
the comprehension scale and all distress variables, including depression, worry, obsessive compul-
sive symptoms, social anxiety, agoraphobia and interoceptive fear. Mediation eﬀects with the
purpose and the mattering scales were no longer signiﬁcant when controlling for the other two
meaning scales.
As in Study 1, we examined a model in which fear of uncertainty was entered as the predictor and
meaning as the mediator. The results showed that meaning did not act as a mediator for four of the ﬁve
anxiety outcomes but did act as a mediator for the depression outcome (see Supplemental Table 1).
Discussion
Similar to Study 1, the correlation results generally indicated an inverse relation between life
meaning and measures of depression and anxiety. Speciﬁcally, the aggregate measure of life
meaning was inversely related with symptoms of depression, worry, social anxiety, and interoceptive
fear but not with obsessive-compulsive disorder or agoraphobia. As Table 2 indicates, the inverse
relations between the meaning subscales and the depression and anxiety measures was largely
similar to those with the aggregate measure, with the comprehension scale showing an additional

relation with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and slightly stronger correlations compared to the
other two subscales. The strength of the comprehension scale was further indicated by regression
analyses indicating that when all three scales were simultaneously entered as predictors, compre-
hension demonstrated unique relations with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms,
social anxiety, interoceptive fear, as well as with fear of uncertainty. The other subscales showed
weaker unique predictor eﬀects, with the mattering scale related to worry and social anxiety and
the purpose scale related to interoceptive fear.
Also similar to Study 1, the mediation analyses showed evidence for fear of the unknown as a
mediator of all relations between the aggregate scale of life meaning and the depression and anxiety
measures, including the two scales for which there were not signiﬁcant main eﬀect relations (i.e., the
obsessive-compulsive disorder and agoraphobia scales). The ﬁndings with the agoraphobia and obses-
sive-compulsive disorder measures is perhaps to be expected, given evidence that indirect eﬀects fre-
quently occur when the relation between the predictor and criterion variables is relatively weaker than
their relation with the mediator (Rucker et al., 2011). Further, all relations between the three meaning
subscales and the depression and anxiety measures demonstrated indirect eﬀects through fear of
the unknown. In analyses controlling for the other two meaning subscales, the comprehension scale
continued to show indirect relations through fear of the unknown with each of the depression and
anxiety measures whereas there were no longer mediator eﬀects for the purpose and mattering scales.
General discussion
These studies examined two hypotheses regarding the relation between life meaning and psycho-
logical distress. The ﬁrst hypothesis was that life meaning would be inversely related to anxiety and
depression. This hypothesis was largely supported, as Study 1 showed that a unidimensional
measure of meaning was inversely related to both anxiety and depression and Study 2 showed
that both the composite score and subscales of a multidimensional measure of meaning were inver-
sely related with clinical symptom measures of depression, social anxiety, worry, and interoceptive
fear but not with symptoms of agoraphobia or obsessive-compulsive disorder (with the exception of
the comprehension subscale). The second hypothesis was that the inverse relation between life
meaning and psychological distress would be mediated by fear of the unknown. This was also
largely supported, as mediation analyses indicated indirect eﬀects of life meaning and all measures
of depression and anxiety through fear of uncertainty using both unidimensional (Study 1) and mul-
tidimensional (Study 2) measures of meaning.
Contributions
These studies support previous ﬁndings of an inverse relation between anxiety and depression and
life meaning assessed with unidimensional (Steger et al., 2009) and multidimensional (George & Park,
2017) measures. As previous research has typically examined the relation between meaning and
general anxiety (Miller & Rottinghaus, 2014; Steger et al., 2009), one contribution of the current
research is the use of symptom measures from multiple disorders in Study 2. The ﬁndings indicated
that life meaning showed strong associations with symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety dis-
order, and social anxiety disorder, somewhat weaker relations with interoceptive fear symptoms of
panic disorder, and little or no relations with agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. A
potential reason for these ﬁndings is that depression, generalized anxiety disorder and social
anxiety often involve concerns with incentives such as relationships and employment (Ashbaugh
et al., 2019; Newby & Moulds, 2012; Roemer et al., 1997) whereas panic disorder and obsessive-com-
pulsive disorder may involve concerns with physical and mental injury (de Silva, 1986; Ottaviani &
Beck, 1987). Life meaning may thus play a more important role in disorders that involve problems
with higher-order goals that provide purpose and comprehension.
ANXIETY, STRESS, & COPING
389

Study 2 also extends previous research by examining the unique variance of psychological dis-
tress accounted for by the meaning subconstructs of comprehension, purpose, and mattering.
Although the three subconstructs may inﬂuence each other, they are generally proposed to have
distinct contributions to an overall sense of life meaning and other measures of psychological
well-being and distress (George & Park, 2016; Martela & Steger, 2016; McKnight & Kashdan, 2009).
Table 2 provides evidence for both perspectives in that the three scales were indeed interrelated
with bivariate correlations ranging from .50 to .62, but not so strongly as to indicate they represent
the same construct (Carlson & Herdman, 2012). Further, the comprehension scale most consistently
predicted unique variance of the psychological distress variables and was the only subconstruct to
uniquely predict fear of uncertainty (see Supplemental Table 1). The current ﬁndings support the
important role given to comprehension/coherence for the experience of meaning and psychological
distress, as discussed by existential thinkers (Camus, 1955; Tillich, 1952) and contemporary psychol-
ogists (Heine et al., 2006; Heintzelman & King, 2014; Janoﬀ-Bulman & Yopyk, 2004; Peterson & Flan-
ders, 2002). The ﬁndings regarding the importance of coherence are relevant for clinical researchers,
who should further examine this meaning subconstruct in developing models of and interventions
for mood and anxiety disorders.
These studies also extend previous ﬁndings by addressing a potential mechanism of the inverse
relation between life meaning and psychological distress. Across both studies, the inverse relation
between all (sub)scales of life meaning and all anxiety and depression scales showed indirect
eﬀects through fear of uncertainty. The nature of this model was further developed in the Study
2 analyses that examined the mediation eﬀects for each meaning subscale when controlling for
the other two subscales. The results showed that fear of uncertainty continued to act as a mediator
between the comprehension subscale and all distress variables whereas none of the previously sig-
niﬁcant mediation eﬀects with the purpose and mattering subscales remained signiﬁcant. Given
theory that the amount of uncertainty is most strongly related with the comprehension subscale
(George & Park, 2016; Martela & Steger, 2016), the current ﬁndings coincide with previous results
indicating that fear responses to uncertain aversive stimuli are weaker in conditions of less uncer-
tainty (Grillon et al., 1998; Papenfuss et al., 2021).
Limitations and future directions
There are several limitations in addition to those listed above. One important limitation regards the
mediation analyses. Although all of the analyses across both studies supported the proposed model
of indirect eﬀects of an inverse relation between life meaning and psychological distress through
fear of uncertainty, the direction of these relations cannot be determined due to the cross-sectional
nature of the methods. We conducted post-hoc analyses to examine whether the data would ﬁt an
alternative model in which meaning was entered as the mediator of the relations between fear of
uncertainty and psychological distress. The results from both studies indicated that the anxiety
data better ﬁt a model in which life meaning is the predictor and fear of uncertainty the mediator
but that the depression data also ﬁt the alternative model in which meaning is the mediator. It
may be that in some cases fear of uncertainty impedes the ability to ﬁnd meaning with conse-
quences that are more detrimental for depression than anxiety.1 However, the correlational
nature of the data suggests that the results be interpreted as initial evidence for the proposed
model that requires further testing with longitudinal and experimental designs.
Another limitation regards the generalizability of the ﬁndings. The ﬁndings were similar in both
studies and the use of an analog sample in Study 2 suggests the results will generalize to those
suﬀering from clinical disorders (Abramowitz et al., 2014). To illustrate, the mean depression score in
this sample (23.57) is similar to that found in a clinical sample of participants who were mildly depressed
(mean = 20.9; Cuipers et al., 2007) and the mean worry score (58.76) is similar to what is seen in social
anxiety patients ( = 56.35) but lower than GAD patients ( = 68.11; Fresco et al., 2003). Although the
ﬁndings of Study 2 are promising, the extent to which the results apply to clinical samples needs to
390

be examined. Future research would beneﬁt from correlational and experimental designs that test the
‘life meaning-fear of uncertainty-psychological distress’ model in clinical samples, thereby determining
the extent to which the model is relevant for understanding and treating anxiety and mood disorders.
Conclusion
The cosmic horror author H.P. Lovecraft (1927) stated that “The oldest and strongest emotion of
mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.” Existentially-
oriented thinkers have proposed that fear of the unknown contributes to psychopathology and
that life meaning can reduce both the frequency with which the unknown is encountered and
the unknown’s motivational salience (Boss, 1962; Heidegger, 1927/1996). The current studies are
aligned with these ideas by (i) contributing to a growing body of evidence that fear of the
unknown plays a transdiagnostic role in the symptoms of anxiety and mood disorders (Gentes &
Ruscio, 2011) and (ii) providing support for a model in which the inverse relation between life
meaning and psychological distress is partly accounted for by fear of the unknown. These
ﬁndings suggest the transdiagnostic potential for life meaning interventions.
