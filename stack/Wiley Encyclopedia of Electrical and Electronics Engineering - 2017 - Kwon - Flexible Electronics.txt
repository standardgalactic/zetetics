FLEXIBLE ELECTRONICS
INTRODUCTION
HISTORY OF FLEXIBLE ELECTRONICS
Flexible electronic devices extend the limits of conventional
devices based on rigid, inorganic electronics such as dis-
plays, sensors, and many other electronic systems (1–4).
Especially, ﬂexible electronics have received a lot of atten-
tion for diverse applications such as electronic skins (5) and
electric fabrics that are touted as future electronics (6). In
the 1960s, the ﬂexible electronics was ﬁrst demonstrated in
satellite solar cells made of 100 μm single-crystal silicon (7).
In addition, the ﬁrst ﬂexible thin ﬁlm transistor (TFT) was
made in the late 1960s by Brody using tellurium on paper.
The next year, TFT was fabricated on various substrates
such as Mylar, polyethylene, and anodized aluminum
wrapping foil (8). In the early 1970s, hydrogenated amor-
phous silicon deposits on ﬂexible metals or polymers were
created to overcome the energy crisis due to their low cost
(9). For instance, in 1976, Wronski, Carlson, and Daniel at
RCA (Radio Corporation of America) announced that they
were successful in fabricating solar cells on stainless steel
(10). In the 1980s, Plattener and Okaniwa reported a solar
cell fabricated on ﬂexible polymer substrates and a roll-to-
roll process, which is still applied to the manufacturing
process for solar cells today, was introduced (11, 12).
Active-matrix liquid-crystal display and hydrogenerated
amorphous
silicon
were
made
using
the
PECVD
(plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition) process in
Japan in the mid-1980s (13–17). Moreover, in the 1990s,
electric circuits based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon
could be produced on stable polymer substrates such as
polyimide (18). In the late-1990s, hydrogenated amorphous
silicon TFT and polycrystalline silicon TFT could be pro-
duced on ﬂexible plastic substrates (19–21). Samsung
recently revealed a 7 in. ﬂexible liquid crystal panel, while
Universal Display Corporation and the Palo Alto Research
Center reported a ﬂexible OLED (organic light emitting
diodes).1,2 So far, many candidates for ﬂexible semi-
conductor, for example, organic materials and amorphous
silicon fabricated on plastic sheets, have been introduced.
Ultrathin single-crystal silicon membranes, inorganic opto-
electronic
devices,
and
semiconducting
nanoparticles
transferred onto ﬂexible substrates have recently emerged
as high-performance ﬂexible electronics.
In this article, we summarize the recent advances in
ﬂexible electronic devices based on materials and designs.
We also provide a detailed description of the organic,
inorganic, and optoelectronic devices as well as an intro-
duction of new emerging ﬁelds based on ﬂexible electronics.
2. MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS FOR FLEXIBLE
ELECTRONICS
2.1. Organic Semiconductor
Organic semiconducting materials have been studied since
the 1940s (22). The semiconducting properties come from
the conjugated π-electron system of carbon (C) atoms in the
backbone with a bandgap from 1.5 to 3 eV, because
π-electron bonding is weaker than σ bonding (23). One of
the most popular organic semiconductor materials, penta-
cene, which has a mobility of ∼3 cm2=V s, was used (24)
(Table 1). A small molecule semiconductor, such as penta-
cene, requires complicated equipment and a vacuum depo-
sition process to make a high crystalline ﬁlm, because the
size and orientation of the grain boundary of the pentacene,
controlled by the deposition condition, improves electron
and hole charge motilities. However, the deposition
method is quite limited in large area processes and is
not cost effective. To overcome this limitation, new organic
materials suitable for the solution process have been devel-
oped. Since the solubility of pure pentacene in organic
solvents is not good, chemically modiﬁed pentacene,
TIPS[6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)]-pentacene,
and
alternatively polymeric materials such as poly(3-hexylth-
iophene-2,5-diyl)) (P3HT) are utilized. TIPS-pentacene
was studied for TFT involving solution processes such as
spin coating, ink-jet printing, and spray coating (25).
Recently, the enhancement of semiconducting properties
by improving the crystallinity of thin ﬁlms and the pattern-
ing process was researched. Representatively, the Bao
research group publishes articles about the solution-shear-
ing method that can increase the electrical properties and
crystallinity of TIPS-pentacene and form different pat-
terns according to the shearing velocity or substrate struc-
ture (26).
P3HT is another substance with similar stages. Ini-
tially, polythiophene was studied as an organic semi-
conductor,
although
it
had
very
low
solubility
and
mobility around 105 cm2=V s (27). Like pentacene, poly-
thiophene is combined with a long alkyl chain to improve
the solubility and mobility through arrangement in a
lamellar
structure.
According
to
Bao,
the
mobility
increases to 0:01 cm2=V s (38). The Sirringhaus research
group announced that they observed mobility around
0:1 cm2=V s when the P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-
diyl)) lamellar structure was applied to the active layer of
an LED (light emitting diode) (28). Recently, nanowire
made of P3HT (core) and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide) (shell))
showed high performance with mobility about 9:7 cm2=V s
and the possibility of reliable fabrication on a large area
(29) (Figure 1b). Furthermore, P3HT can be used with
other materials such as fullerene derivatives and PCBM
(phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) that makes solution
casting possible. This combination is commonly used as the
active layer in solar cells. The efﬁciency of solar cells using
P3HT:PCBM increased from 2.8% in 2002 (39) to 3% in
2010 (40). Many approaches involving the chemical han-
dling of this kind of material to improve efﬁciency have
received attention in recent years (41). Additionally, other
organic
semiconducting
materials
like

hydroxyquioline)aluminum) (Figure 1d) (42), PPV (poly(p-
phenylenevinylene)) (43), PFO (polyﬂuorene) (44), and C60
(fullerene) (31) have been employed. Especially, carbon-
based materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene
are used in many ﬁelds due to their superior electrical
properties. Recently, various types of wearable devices and
sensors designed to have close contact with objects in patch
form were reported to measure mechanical signals such as
pressure and to monitor diseases like diabetes for health
care. For example, combined with nanotube transistors and
AMOLED systems, skin-like pressure sensory devices dis-
play various colors depending on the amount of pressure
applied without loss of mechanical stability when deformed
in a 4.7 mm bending radius (30) (Figure 1e). Furthermore,
electronic skin based on carbon nanotubes (45–47) and
their clinical applications for detecting diseases and drug
delivery, with various sensing parts composed of up to 30%
graphene compressed or stretched, have been reported (48)
(Figure 1f).
Organic semiconductors are usually applied in many
ﬁelds by display companies, because of their merits such
as ﬂexibility and low manufacturing cost when applied
to ﬂexible electronics. Especially, optoelectronic devices,
usually called OLEDs, are receiving attention for a wide
variety of applications, from lamps for illumination to
displays on televisions or mobile electronics and so on.
2.2. Flexible Inorganic Semiconductors
Materials for Flexible Inorganic Electronics. Compared
with organic semiconductor materials, inorganic materials
should be modiﬁed to withstand mechanical stress when
they are deformed. According to Khang, wrinkled ultrathin
single-crystalline silicon can be transferred on stretchable,
ﬂexible
polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS)
substrates
(51)
(Figure 2a). It is possible that a nanoribbon silicon structure,
which is mechanically stable within a certain range of
applied strain, can be applied to stretchable and ﬂexible
electronics due to the portion of the silicon detached from the
substrate (36). Therefore, this technique involving the depo-
sitionofathinﬁlmofinorganic semiconductorsispotentially
notable with the increase of interest in ﬂexible electronics.
Approaches involving inorganic semiconductors with
nanowire structures provide other solutions for ﬂexible
devices. Zheng’s research group practically used silicon
nanowire in unusual techniques, such as vertically grown
nanowire with a crack that is easily detached (55) or a
water lift-off process, and additionally reported successful
results with ordinarily activated electronics based on vari-
ous ﬂexible substrates (56). Alternatively, the exfoliation
process, in which fully formed devices are mechanically
separated from the original board in a thin layer, can be
used. Zhai reported that CMOS (complementary metal–
oxide–semiconductor) arrays on silicon wafers are sepa-
rated by nickel metal seeds with a silicon nitride passiva-
tion layer attributed to the negative residual strain of the
nickel layer (57). Chung et al. attempted to transfer the
fully formed devices to a ﬂexible substrate. In this process,
fully fabricated devices are encapsulated by a passivation
layer and the supporting part is etched with different
velocities depending on the crystal direction that makes
the devices vulnerable to detachment. Using a polymer
stamp, the devices are easily separated and transferred to
other kinds of surfaces, not only a ﬂat board but also bent or
deformed surfaces (52) (Figure 2b). Moreover, ﬂexible/
stretchable inorganic devices based on ultrathin single-
crystal silicon membranes and semiconducting nanopar-
ticles, which are described later, exhibit high performance
in electrical properties and mechanical stability like ﬂexi-
bility and stretchability, due to their unique structures in
the form of ultrathin and nanoscale geometries for low
effective moduli. Based on these devices, ﬂexible and wear-
able electronics closely attached to curvilinear objects are
being developed in various ﬁelds, especially biointegrated
devices with biocompatibility. In recent years, patch-type
devices possessing sensors and memory systems have
shown promise in enabling users to monitor their condi-
tions such as body temperature or movement in real time
(53) (Figure 2c). Furthermore, electronics with transient
characteristics, which means that they are dissolved by the
environment after a speciﬁc time, based on very thin silicon
materials have received a lot of attention in the medical
ﬁeld for application in brains (54) (Figure 2d), because
extra surgery for the removal of residual devices is not
necessary and silicon is reported to be dissolved by body
ﬂuid without an immune reaction (58). Ultrathin devices
combined with serpentine-shaped electrodes or intercon-
nections possess superior stretchability of more than 100%.

Design for Flexible Inorganic Electronics. Because of the
electrical and mechanical properties, certain parts of
electronics, especially active components and electrodes,
cannot be replaced with inherently ﬂexible materials.
Therefore, new designs for ﬂexible inorganic devices should
be introduced. Lots of research groups have developed
ﬂexible active components and electrodes by transforming
the structures. Some of them developed a serpentine struc-
ture for the electronic circuit using a natural wave (59).
There are two main approaches used for creating a wavy
structure. First, horizontal serpentine structures are used
in the electronic circuit. This results in serpentine transis-
tors and diodes (Figure 3a). One application of this research
is epidermal tattoo electronics (Figure 3b). Tattoo elec-
tronics attached on the skin are expected to eventually
develop into wearable devices (60), as real skin requires
lots of motion such as skin expansion, compression, and
bending. Due to this requirement, electronics must possess
some mechanical properties and the serpentine structure of
rigid materials partly satisﬁes this condition. The other
method is a vertical serpentine structure involving the
interconnection of rigid materials (61). This has the advan-
tages of pressing, expansion, compression, and bending
properties. However, both vertical and horizontal serpen-
tine structures are produced using a photolithography
process. Horizontal serpentine structures have a wavy
form for direct materials such as the source, drain, and
gate in transistors and the p–n junction materials in
diodes. Vertical serpentine structures have a wavy form
for indirect materials such as the arch shape inter-
connection. A natural spiral-inspired structure is another
method for creating ﬂexible properties using several differ-
ent geometries (Figure 3c,d). These structures have the
advantage of stretching in all directions. The structure can
be expanded with up to 60% strain (Figure 3e) (62). Also,
various kinds of fractal shapes (63, 64) have been studied
by lots of groups (Figure 3f). Freestanding metal is usually
limited to under 1–2% when stretched. Beyond this

percentage of stretching, ruptures occur in the metal struc-
ture. However, metals attached to the elastomeric sub-
strate can be stretched by a percentage of up to several
tens (Figure 3g). Also, this multilayer exhibits no fatigue
after repeated stretching and releasing motions, but free-
standing metal does. The result can be explained by two
factors. First, the thin metal layer on which the elastomeric
substrate is located has a tri-branch fractal on the surface.
According to the amount of deformation applied for each
individual shape, the metal layer improves the stretchabil-
ity. This can also be veriﬁed by a simulation (Figure 3g).
The other factor is that the elastomeric substrate sustains
the stretching of the device.
2.3. Flexible Optoelectronic Devices
Like
organic
and
ﬂexible
inorganic
semiconductors,
inorganic optoelectronic semiconductors can be utilized
as illuminating devices such as displays that exceed the
properties of OLEDs such as brightness, lifetime, and
efﬁciency. However, they are restricted to very large
areas and low resolutions (65, 66). Previously, the

substrates. First, fabrication of a thin single crystal silicon layer with thickness of about 20–320 nm using the conventional lithographic
method is conducted, followed by etching of the silicon and silicon dioxide layers. Second, silicon nanoribbons are supported by PDMS with
extra expansion. Finally, peeling of the PDMS substrate and releasing causes the formation of a wavy structure for silicon. Scanning electron

manufacturing and arrangement process for inorganic
light emitting diodes (ILED) were accompanied by epi-
taxial growth, wafer-slicing, pick-and-place, wiring, and
so on that are not appropriate for ﬂexible electronics
because some processes require a high temperature and
are based on hard substrates (67, 68). Therefore, different
approaches for practical use with ﬂexibility should be set
up. Park et al. designed the transfer printing process for
ILED arrays on wafers by creating a polymeric anchor,
vertically etching and undercutting the support layer of
the wafer, and ﬁnally placing the ILED on a rubbery
substrate with a polymer (PDMS) stamp, followed by
wiring with a mesh that can deform the response to
bending stress up to 20% (67) (Figure 4a). Afterward,
the research result indicated that the microscale ILED
(μ-ILED) array on ﬂexible substrates made by a process
similar to the above could be used for biomedicine and
surgery with biocompatible materials, that is, PDMS
coating. This gives the devices various properties when
they make contact with liquids such as water or saline
solutions. Their operation is not different from soaking to
improve mechanical stability according to the work by
Kim et al (69) (Figure 4a). Thermal heat generated during
activation is an issue when dealing with μ-ILED. Some
reports showing that the thermal stability of μ-ILED
made with indium gallium nitride (Figure 4b) and gal-
lium nitride on unconventional substrates provide ﬂexi-
bility even when deformed have been presented (68, 70).
In recent years, quantum dots have received a lot of
attention as notable materials for displays, and many
companies such as Samsung are manufacturing mobile
devices for televisions equipped with QLED (quantum dot
light emitting diode) (71–75). Illuminating devices with
quantum dots and patterns developed using the intaglio
pressing method and the applicability to ﬂexible elec-
tronics are reported (76).

2.4. New Emerging Field in Flexible Electronics: Bioinspired
Devices
Flexible electronics can facilitate the emergence of many
ﬁelds for various applications. Especially, ﬂexible bioins-
pired electronic systems that can be integrated on various
target substrates have already been demonstrated for
arthropod eyes (77), chameleon color transformation (78),
spider vibration in detecting sensors (79), and octopus
camouﬂage (80).
Arthropod-Inspired Eyes for Artiﬁcial Lens. Arthropods
have compound eyes that consist of thousands of ocellus
reference for (83). Because of this structure, arthropod
eyes have a wide ﬁeld of view. Each ocellus detects a
speciﬁc part on an object and sends this information to the
peripheral nerves. Afterward, the information about the
object is integrated at the central nerve. The beneﬁt of
arthropod eyes can be applied to artiﬁcial lens that can be
used as cameras, surveillance systems, and endoscopy for
surgery. It is hard to realize artiﬁcial hemisphere lens
before the development of ﬂexible techniques. As more
methods to generate ﬂexible and stretchable devices are
developed, it is possible to realize arthropod-inspired
artiﬁcial lens. First, researchers interconnect the photo-
detectors with a serpentine shape, as mentioned previ-
ously (Figure 5a), and then the lens is placed onto a soft
material with a hemisphere shape to mimic arthropod
eyes. Each photodetector recognizes the object and out-
puts the image individually. These images are integrated
by processing and the resulting integrated image is simi-
lar to the arthropod eye object detection mechanism. This
device can be used in a wide-angle ﬁeld of view with low
aberration, high acuity to motion, and inﬁnite depth of
ﬁeld on artiﬁcial lens (Figure 5b).
Chameleon Color Transformation. Chameleons change
their color for various reasons, such as to maintain their
body temperature, camouﬂage from their enemies, and
communicate with each other. Chameleon-color-transform-
ing-inspired artiﬁcial e-skin applies pressure input to elec-
trochromic output. For this device, electrochromic devices
(ECDs) and pressure sensors (PS) are required to achieve
color transformation. E-skins need three crucial factors
that are tactile sensing, low power consumption, and
stretchability for free movement (81, 82). To satisfy these
properties, the function of the bottom layer (blue) is tactile
sensing, while the top layer (red) serves as a pigment cell.
The top layer includes P3HT and this material changes its
color by redox reaction. When oxidized, P3HT has a blue
color while the reduction of P3HT results in a red color.
This phenomenon occurs due to external pressure. Accord-
ing to this mechanism, pressure can be detected by color
change in the layers (Figure 5c).
Cephalopod Skin-Inspired Artiﬁcial Camouﬂage System.
Cephalopods have a color changing skin whose purpose is
to help them with camouﬂage, communication, hunting,
and reproduction. This skin is composed of a bottom layer
containing leucophores, which function as a bright back-
drop; a middle layer containing iridophores, which provides
a high refractive index and a camouﬂage mechanism; and a
top layer containing chromatophores, which performs pig-
mentary color changes. Because of these three layers,
cephalopods can change their color to match their sur-
roundings. The color change system can be used for stealth
and as a military camouﬂage strategy. Artiﬁcial e-skin
inspired by cephalopods is composed of ﬁve layers. The
ﬁrst layer contains artiﬁcial chromatophores. This layer
provides pigmentary coloration and acts like the top
layer of the cephalopod’s skin. The second layer contains

artiﬁcial leucodyes. This layer changes color due to its
unique structural coloration component. The third layer
contains artiﬁcial muscle and functions as the supporting
silicon diode and actuation for Joule heating. The fourth
layer is PDMS. It separates the layers above from the
bottom layer. The last layer contains artiﬁcial opsin and
functions
like
a
photodetector.
This
artiﬁcial
e-skin
changes color with external Joule heating. The advantage
of this device is that the response time is very fast and it has
high sensitivity (Figure 5d).
Crack-Based Sensor Inspired by the Spider Sensory Sys-
tem. Spiders hunt by sensing the movement of prey
caught in their web as vibration. As such, the vibration
sensor of the spider is the most sensitive in all creatures
except for the cockroach. The vibration sensor in spiders
contains two different layers in the joint section between
the legs. Changes in resistance occur due to differences in
expansion and reversible shrinkage of the two layers
against external stimuli. According to the resistance
changes processed by neurons, spiders can detect tiny
vibrations. A vibration sensor with different levels of
elasticity applies a strain on both ends after rigid metal
is deposited on the ﬂexible polymer layer to create a copy
of the spider joint (Figure 5e) (80). The resistance from the
strain change must be reversible to external stimulus,
and the vibration sensor needs to ﬁt on curved surfaces
such as the human body. To satisfy this property, the base
uses a ﬂexible polymer material, while the top surface is a
very thin metal layer attached to the surface though the
use of rigid materials that meet the bending require-
ments. This ultrahigh sensitivity of the vibration sensor
can be improved by a voice recognition sensor, a micro-
ﬂuidic area, and heart rate measurement compared to
conventional sensors. The voice recognition sensor for
sensing vibration does not detect sound coming from
the mouth, but rather, throat and neck vibrations. The
inclusion of a voice recognition sensor has many advan-
tages over existing voice recognition techniques and
greater sensitivity as it can measure selective sounds
from the target voice and distinguish external noise

3. SUMMARY
In this article, we described recently introduced ﬂexible
electronics with organic and inorganic materials and their
essential designs devices. Both ﬂexible and inﬂexible mate-
rials are in harmony with each other according to the
structures employed in the conﬁguration of ﬂexible elec-
tronics. We also introduced a wide range of structural types
and attribute values that can be implemented. Following
the introduction of the materials for construction and the
structural characteristics of these ﬂexible devices, the
emerging applications and research ﬁelds were described.
First was the description and various examples of appli-
cations and devices with ﬂexible elements used in opto-
electronics. Other applications of ﬂexible materials to
biomimetics and various examples were also described.
Four examples that reﬂect current research activities are
arthropod eye-inspired lens, chameleon color transforma-
tion, cephalopod skin-inspired artiﬁcial camouﬂage sys-
tems, and crack-based sensors inspired by the spider
sensory system. We believe that not only new applications
but also new industrial needs will be inspired by these
ﬂexible optoelectronics and bioinspired electronics based
on organic and inorganic semiconductor materials.
