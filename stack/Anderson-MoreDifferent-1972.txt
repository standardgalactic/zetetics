More Is Different
Broken symmetry and the nature of
the hierarchical structure of science.
P. W. Anderson
The reductionist hypothesis may still
be a topic for controversy among phi-
losophers, but among the great majority
of active scientists I think it is accepted
without question. The workings of our
minds and bodies, and of all the ani-
mate or inanimate matter of which we
have any detailed knowledge, are as-
sumed to be controlled by the same set
of
fundamental
laws,
which
except
under certain extreme
conditions we
feel we know pretty well.
It seems inevitable to go on uncrit-
ically to what appears at first sight to
be an obvious corollary of reduction-
ism: that if everything obeys the same
fundamental laws, then the only
sci-
entists who are studying anything really
fundamental are those who are working
on those laws. In practice, that amounts
to some astrophysicists, some elemen-
tary particle physicists, some logicians
and
other
mathematicians,
and
few
others. This point of view, which it is
the main
purpose
of
this
article
to
oppose,
is expressed in a rather well-
known passage by Weisskopf (1):
Looking
at
the development
of
science
in
the Twentieth Century one can
dis-
tinguish
two
trends,
which
I
will
call
"intensive" and "extensive" research, lack-
ing
a
better terminology.
In
short:
in-
tensive research goes for the fundamental
laws, extensive research goes for the ex-

SCIE:NCE:
less relevance they seem to have to the
very real problems of the rest of sci-
ence, much
less to those of society.
The constructionist hypothesis breaks
down when confronted with the twin
difficulties of scale and complexity. The
behavior of large and complex aggre-
gates of elementary particles,
it turns
out, is not to be understood in terms
of a simple extrapolation of the prop-
erties of a few particles.
Instead,
at
each level of complexity entirely new
properties appear, and the understand-
ing of the new behaviors requires re-
search which I think is as fundamental
in its nature as any other. That is, it
seems to me that one may array the
sciences roughly linearly in a hierarchy,
according to the idea: The elementary
entities of science X obey the laws of
planation
of
phenomena
in
terms
of
known fundamental laws. As always, dis-
tinctions of this kind are not unambiguous,
but they are clear in most cases.
Solid
state physics, plasma physics, and perhaps
also biology are extensive. High energy
physics and a good part of nuclear physics
are intensive. There is always much less
intensive research going on than extensive.
Once new fundamental laws are discov-
ered, a large and ever increasing activity
begins in order to apply the discoveries to
hitherto
unexplained
phenomena.
Thus,
there
are two
dimensions
to
basic
re-
search. The frontier of science extends all
along a long line from the newest and most
modern intensive research, over the ex-
tensive research recently spawned by the
intensive
research
of yesterday,
to
the
broad and well developed web of exten-
sive research activities based on intensive
research of past decades.
The effectiveness of this message may
be indicated by the fact that I heard it
quoted recently by a leader in the field
of materials
science, who urged the
participants at a meeting dedicated to
"fundamental problems
in condensed
matter physics"
to accept that there
were few or no such problems and that
nothing was left but extensive science,
which he seemed to equate with device
engineering.
The main
fallacy
in this kind of
thinking is that the reductionist hypoth-
esis does not by any means imply a
"constructionist"
one: The
ability
to
reduce everything to simple fundamen-
tal laws does not imply the ability to
start from those laws and reconstruct
the universe. In fact, the more the ele-
mentary particle physicists tell us about
the nature of the fundamental laws, the
science Y.
x
solid state or
many-body physics

But this hierarchy does not imply
that science X is "just applied Y." At
each stage entirely new laws, concepts,
and generalizations are necessary, re-
quiring inspiration and creativity to just
as great a degree as in the previous one.
Psychology is not applied biology, nor
is biology applied chemistry.
In my own field of many-body phys-
ics, we are, perhaps, closer to our fun-
damental, intensive underpinnings than
in any other science
in which non-
trivial complexities occur, and as a re-
sult we have begun
to formulate
a
general theory of just how this shift
from quantitative to qualitative differ-
entiation takes place. This formulation,
called
the
theory
of
"broken
sym-
metry," may be of help in making more
generally clear the breakdown of the
constructionist converse of reduction-
ism. I will give an elementary and in-
complete explanation of these ideas, and
then go on to some more general spec-
ulative comments about
analogies
at
393

other
levels
and
about
similar phe-
nomena.
Before beginning this I wish to sort
out two possible sources of misunder-
standing. First, when I speak of scale
change causing fundamental change I
do not mean the rather well-understood
idea that phenomena at a new scale
may obey actually different fundamen-
tal laws-as, for example, general rela-
tivity
is required on the cosmological
scale and quantum mechanics on the
atomic. I think it will be accepted that
all ordinary matter obeys simple elec-
trodynamics and quantum theory, and
that really covers most of what I shall
discuss. (As I said, we must all start
with reductionism, which I fully ac-
cept.) A second source of confusion
may be the fact that the concept of
broken symmetry has been borrowed by
the elementary particle physicists, but
their use of the term
is
strictly an
analogy, whether a deep or a specious
one remaining to be understood.
Let me then start my discussion with
an example on the simplest possible
level, a natural one for me because I
worked with it when I was a graduate
student: the ammonia molecule. At that
time everyone knew about ammonia
and used it to calibrate his theory or
his apparatus, and I was no exception.
The chemists will tell you that ammonia
"is" a triangular pyramid
N (-)
H(+)
i
(+)H
HI(+)
with
the nitrogen negatively charged
and the hydrogens positively charged,
so that
it has an electric dipole mo-
ment (n), negative toward the apex of
the pyramid. Now this seemed very
strange to me, because I was just being
taught that nothing has an electric di-
pole moment. The professor was really
proving that no nucleus has a dipole
moment, because he was teaching nu-
clear physics, but as his arguments were
based on the symmetry of space and
time they should have been correct in
general.
I soon learned that, in fact, they were
correct (or perhaps it would be more
accurate to say not incorrect) because
he had been careful to say that no
stationary state of a system (that
is,
one which does not change in time)
has an electric dipole moment. If am-
monia starts out from the above un-
symmetrical state, it will not stay in it
very long. By means of quantum me-
chanical
tunneling,
the
nitrogen can
394
leak through the triangle of hydrogens
to the other side, turning the pyramid
inside out, and, in fact, it can do so
very rapidly. This is the so-called "in-
version," which occurs at a frequency
of
about
3 X 1010
per
second.
A
truly stationary state can only be an
equal superposition of the unsymmetri-
cal pyramid and its inverse. That mix-
ture does not have a dipole moment.
(I warn the reader again that I am
greatly oversimplifying and refer him
to the textbooks for details.)
I will not go through the proof, but
the result is that the state of the system,
if it is to be stationary, must always
have the same symmetry as the laws of
motion which govern it. A reason may
be put very simply: In quantum me-
chanics there is always a way, unless
symmetry forbids, to get from one state
to another. Thus, if we start from any
one unsymmetrical state, the system will
make transitions to others, so only by
adding up all the possible unsymmet-
rical states in a symmetrical way can
we get a stationary state. The symmetry
involved in the case of ammonia
is
parity,
the
equivalence
of
left- and
right-handed ways of looking at things.
(The elementary particle experimental-
ists' discovery of certain violations of
parity is not relevant to this question;
those
effects are too weak to
affect
ordinary matter.)
Having seen how the ammonia mol-
ecule satisfies our theorem that there is
no dipole moment, we may look into
other cases and,
in particular, study
progressively
bigger
systems
to
see
whether the state and the symmetry are
always related. There are other similar
pyramidal molecules, made of heavier
atoms. Hydrogen phosphide, PH3, which
is twice as heavy as ammonia, inverts,
but at one-tenth the ammonia frequency.
Phosphorus trifluoride, PF3, in which
the much heavier fluorine is substituted
for hydrogen, is not observed to invert
at a measurable rate, although theo-
retically one can be sure that a state
prepared in one orientation would in-
vert in a reasonable time.
We may then go on to more compli-
cated molecules, such as sugar, with
about 40 atoms. For these it no longer
makes any sense to expect the molecule
to invert itself. Every sugar molecule
made by a living organism is spiral in
the same sense, and they never invert,
either by quantum mechanical tunnel-
ing or even under thermal agitation at
normal temperatures. At this point we
must forget about the possibility of in-
version and ignore the parity symmetry:
the symmetry laws have been, not re-
pealed, but broken.
If, on the other hand, we synthesize
our sugar molecules by a chemical re-
action more or less in thermal equi-
librium, we will find that there are not,
on the average, more left- than right-
handed ones or vice versa. In the ab-
sence of anything more complicated
than a collection of free molecules, the
symmetry laws are never broken, on the
average. We needed living matter to
produce an actual unsymmetry in the
populations.
In really large, but still inanimate,
aggregates of atoms, quite a different
kind of broken symmetry can occur,
again leading to a net dipole moment
or to a net optical rotating power, or
both. Many crystals have a net dipole
moment in each elementary unit cell
(pyroelectricity), and in some this mo-
ment can be reversed by an electric
field (ferroelectricity). This asymmetry
is a spontaneous effect of the crystal's
seeking
its
lowest
energy
state.
Of
course, the state with the opposite mo-
ment also exists and has, by symmetry,
just the same energy, but the system is
so large that no thermal or quantum
mechanical force can cause a conversion
of one to the other in afinite time com-
pared to, say, the age of the universe.
There are at least three inferences to
be drawn from this. One is that sym-
metry is of great importance in physics.
By symmetry we mean the existence of
different viewpoints from which the sys-
tem appears the same. It is only slightly
overstating the case to say that physics
is the study of symmetry. The
first
demonstration of the power of this idea
may have been by Newton, who may
have asked himself the question: What
if the matter here in my hand obeys
the same laws as that up in the sky-
that is, what if space and matter are
homogeneous and isotropic?
The second inference is that the in-
ternal structure of a piece of matter
need not be symmetrical even if the
total state of it is. I would challenge you
to start from the fundamental laws of
quantum mechanics and predict the am-
monia inversion and its easily observ-
able properties without going through
the stage of using the unsymmetrical
pyramidal
structure, even though no
"state" ever has that structure.
It
is
fascinating that it was not until a cou-
ple of decades ago (2) that nuclear phys-
icists stopped thinking of the nucleus as
a featureless, symmetrical little ball and
realized that while it really never has a
dipole moment, it can become football-

shaped or plate-shaped. This has ob-
servable consequences in the reactions
and excitation spectra that are studied
in nuclear physics, even though it is
much more difficult to demonstrate di-
rectly than the ammonia inversion. In
my opinion, whether or not one calls
this intensive research,
it is as funda-
mental in nature as many things one
might so label. But it needed no new
knowledge of fundamental
laws and
would have been extremely difficult to
derive synthetically from those laws; it
was simply an inspiration, based, to be
sure, on everyday intuition, which sud-
denly fitted everything together.
The
basic
reason why
this
result
would have been difficult to derive is
an important one for our further think-
ing. If the nucleus is sufficiently small
there is no real way to define its shape
rigorously: Three or four or ten par-
ticles whirling about each other do not
define a rotating "plate" or "football."
It is only as the nucleus is considered
to be a many-body system-in what is
often called the N -> oo limit-that such
behavior is rigorously definable. We say
to ourselves: A macroscopic body of
that shape would have such-and-such a
spectrum of rotational and vibrational
excitations, completely different in na-
ture from those which would character-
ize a featureless system. When we see
such a spectrum, even not so separated,
and somewhat imperfect, we recognize
that the nucleus is, after all, not macro-
scopic; it is merely approaching macro-
scopic behavior. Starting with the fun-
damental
laws
and
a
computer, we
would have to do two impossible things
-solve a problem with infinitely many
bodies, and then apply the result to a
finite
system-before we
synthesized
this behavior.
A third insight is that the state of a
really big system does not at all have
to have the symmetry of the laws which
govern
it; in fact,
it usually has less
symmetry. The outstanding example of
this is the crystal: Built from a substrate
of atoms and space according to laws
which express the perfect homogeneity
of space, the crystal suddenly and un-
predictably displays an entirely new and
very beautiful symmetry. The general
rule, however, even in the case of the
crystal, is that the large system is less
symmetrical than the underlying struc-
ture would suggest: Symmetrical as
it
is, a crystal
is less symmetrical than
perfect homogeneity.
Perhaps in the case of crystals this
appears to be merely an exercise in
confusion. The
regularity of crystals

could be deduced semiempirically
in
the
mid-19th
century
without
any
complicated reasoning at all. But some-
times, as in the case of superconduc-
tivity, the new symmetry-now called
broken symmetry because the original
symmetry is no longer evident-may be
of an entirely unexpected kind and ex-
tremely difficult to visualize. In the case
of superconductivity, 30 years elapsed
between the time when physicists were
in possession of every fundamental law
necessary for explaining it and the time
when it was actually done.
The phenomenon of superconductiv-
ity is the most spectacular example of
the broken symmetries which ordinary
macroscopic bodies undergo, but it is
of course not the only one. Antiferro-
magnets, ferroelectrics, liquid crystals,
and matter in many other states obey
a certain rather general scheme of rules
and ideas, which some many-body the-
orists refer to under the general heading
of broken symmetry. I shall not further
discuss the history, but give a bibliog-
raphy at the end of this article (3).
The essential idea is that in the so-
called N --
oo limit of large systems (on
our own, macroscopic scale)
it is not
only convenient but essential to realize
that matter will undergo mathematically
sharp, singular "phase transitions" to
states in which the microscopic sym-
metries, and even the microscopic equa-
tions of motion, are in a sense violated.
The symmetry leaves behind as its ex-
pression only certain characteristic be-
haviors, for instance, long-wavelength
vibrations, of which the familiar exam-
ple is sound waves; or the unusual mac-
roscopic conduction phenomena of the
superconductor;
or,
in
a
very
deep
analogy, the very rigidity of crystal lat-
tices, and thus of most solid matter.
There is, of course, no question of the
system's really violating, as opposed to
breaking, the symmetry of space and
time, but because its parts find it ener-
getically more favorable to maintain cer-
tain fixed relationships with each other,
the symmetry allows only the body as
a whole to respond to external forces.
This leads to a "rigidity," which is
also an apt description of superconduc-
tivity and superfluidity in spite of their
apparent "fluid" behavior. [In the for-
mer
case, London noted
this
aspect
very early (4).] Actually, for a hypo-
thetical gaseous but intelligent citizen of
Jupiter or of a hydrogen cloud some-
where in the galactic center, the proper-
ties of ordinary crystals might well be
a more baffling and intriguing puzzle
than those of superfluid helium.
I do not mean to give the impression
that all is settled. For instance, I think
there are still fascinating questions of
principle about glasses and other amor-
phous phases, which may reveal even
more complex types of behavior. Never-
theless, the role of this type of broken
symmetry in the properties of inert but
macroscopic material bodies is now un-
derstood, at least in principle. In this
case we can see how the whole becomes
not only more than but very different
from the sum of its parts.
The next order of business logically
is to ask whether an even more com-
plete destruction of the fundamental
symmetries of space and time is possi-
ble and whether new phenomena then
arise,
intrinsically
different from the
"simple" phase transition representing
a condensation into a less symmetric
state.
We have already excluded the appar-
ently
unsymmetric
cases
of
liquids,
gases, and glasses. (In any real sense
they are more symmetric.) It seems to
me that the next stage is to consider the
system which
is regular but contains
information. That
is,
it
is regular in
space in some sense so that it can be
"read
out," but
it contains
elements
which can be varied from one "cell"
to the next. An obvious example
is
DNA; in everyday life, a line of type
or a movie ifim have the same struc-
ture. This type of "information-bearing
crystallinity" seems to be essential to
life. Whether the development of life
requires any further breaking of sym-
metry is by no means clear.
Keeping on with the attempt to char-
acterize
types
of
broken
symmetry
which occur in living things, I find that
at least one further phenomenon seems
to be identifiable and either universal or
remarkably common, namely, ordering
(regularity or periodicity) in the time
dimension. A number of theories of life
processes have appeared in which reg-
ular pulsing in time plays an important
role: theories of development, of growth
and growth limitation, and of the mem-
ory. Temporal regularity is very com-
monly observed
in
living
objects.
It
plays at least two kinds of roles. First,
most methods of extracting energy from
the environment in order to set up a
continuing, quasi-stable process involve
time-periodic machines, such as oscil-
lators and generators, and the processes
of life work in the same way. Second,
temporal regularity is a means of han-
dling information, similar to informa-
tion-bearing spatial regularity. Human
spoken language is an example, and it
395

is noteworthy that ali computing ma-
chines use temporal pulsing. A possible
third role is suggested in some of the
theories mentioned above: the use of
phase relationships of temporal pulses
to handle information and control the
growth and development of cells and
organisms (5).
In some sense, structure-functional
structure in a teleological sense, as op-
posed to mere crystalline shape-must
also be considered a stage, possibly in-
termediate between crystallinity and in-
formation strings, in the hierarchy of
broken symmetries.
To pile speculation on speculation, I
would say that the next stage could be
hierarchy or specialization of function,
or both. At some point we have to stop
talking about decreasing symmetry and
start calling it increasing complication.
Thus, with increasing complication at
each stage, we go on up the hierarchy
of the sciences. We expect to encounter
fascinating and, I believe, very funda-
mental questions at each stage in fitting
together less complicated pieces into the
more complicated system and under-
standing the basically new types of be-
havior which can result.
There may well be no useful parallel
to be drawn between the way in which
complexity appears in the simplest cases
of many-body theory and chemistry and
the way it appears in the truly complex
cultural and biological ones, except per-
haps to say that, in general, the rela-
tionship between the system and
its
parts is intellectually a one-way street.
Synthesis is expected to be all but im-
possible; analysis, on the other hand,
may be not only possible but fruitful in
all kinds of ways: Without an under-
standing of the broken symmetry in
superconductivity, for instance, Joseph-
son would probably not have discovered
his effect. [Another name for the Joseph-
son effect is "macroscopic quantum-in-
terference phenomena": interference ef-
fects
observed
between
macroscopic
wave functions of electrons in super-
conductors, or of helium atoms in su-
perfluid liquid helium. These phenom-
ena have already enormously extended
the accuracy of electromagnetic mea-
surements, and can be expected to play
a great role in future computers, among
other possibilities, so that in the long
run they may lead to some of the major
technological achievements of this dec-
ade (6).] For another example, biology
has certainly taken on a whole new as-
pect from the reduction of genetics to
biochemistry and biophysics, which will
have untold consequences. So it is not
true, as a recent article would have it
(7), that we each should "cultivate our
own valley, and not attempt to build
roads over the mountain ranges
.
.
.
between
the
sciences."
Rather,
we
should recognize that such roads, while
often the quickest shortcut to another
part of our own science, are not visible
from the viewpoint of one science alone.
The arrogance of the particle physi-
cist and his intensive research may be
behind us (the discoverer of the positron
said "the rest
is chemistry"), but we
have yet to recover from that of some
molecular biologists, who seem deter-
Natural Areas
While harboring valuable species, natural areas also
serve as bench marks in evaluating landscape change.
William H. Moir
"The sheep destroy young trees and
when the old ones die no forest will be
left"; thus H. C. Cowles described the
situation after his epochal study in 1899
of plant succession on the dunes of Lake
Michigan (1). Cowles knew well how
the heavy hand of man could accelerate
396
changes in vegetation, often in unde-
sirable directions. He and his colleague
V. E. Shelford had seen the expanding
city of Gary threaten ever more of the
".quiet but varied beauty" of the dunes
and wooded hills (2). Man's destruc-
tion of the natural landscape appeared
mined to try to reduce everything about
the human organism to "only" chem-
istry, from the common cold and all
mental disease to the religious instinct.
Surely there are more levels of orga-
nization between human ethology and
DNA than there are between DNA and
quantum
electrodynamics,
and
each
level can require- a whole new concep-
tual structure.
In closing, I offer two examples from
economics of what I hope to have said.
Marx said that quantitative differences
become qualitative ones, but a dialogue
in Paris in the 1920's sums it up even
more clearly:
FITZGERALD: The rich are different
from us.
HEMINGWAY:
Yes, they have more
money.
