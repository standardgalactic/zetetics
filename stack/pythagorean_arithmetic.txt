PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
THERE is very little early evidence regarding Pythagoras's
own achievements, and what there is does not touch his mathe-
matics. The earliest philosophers and historians who refer
to him would not be interested in this part of his work.
Heraclitus speaks of his wide knowledge, but with disparage-
ment : ' much learning does not teach wisdom; otherwise
it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again
Xenophanes and Hecataeus \1 Herodotus alludes to Pytha-
goras and the Pythagoreans several times; he calls Pythagoras
' the most able philosopher among the Greeks' ('EWrjvcoi/ ov
r<3 ao-Qeveo-T&rcp o-oc/yL&Tr) IlvOayopr}).2 
In Empedocles he had
an enthusiastic admirer : ' But there was among them a man
of prodigious knowledge who acquired the prof oundest wealth
of understanding and was the greatest master of skilled arts
of every kind; for, whenever he willed with his whole heart,
he could with ease discern each and every truth in his ten—
nay, twenty—men's lives.'3
Pythagoras himself left no written exposition of his
doctrines, nor did any of his immediate successors, not even
Hippasus, about whom the different stories ran (1) that he
was expelled from the school because he published doctrines
of Pythagoras, and (2) that he was drowned at sea for
revealing the construction of the dodecahedron in the sphere
and claiming it as his own, or (as others have it) for making
known the discovery of the irrational or incommensurable.
Nor is the absence of any written record of Pythagorean

doctrines down to the time of Philolaus to be attributed
to a pledge of secrecy binding the school; at all events, it
did not apply to their mathematics or their physics; the
supposed secrecy may even have been invented to explain
the absence of documents. The fact appears to be that oral
communication was the tradition of the school, while their
doctrine would in the main be too abstruse to be understood
by the generality of people outside.
In these circumstances it is difficult to disentangle the
portions of the Pythagorean philosophy which can safely
be attributed to the founder of the school. Aristotle evi-
dently felt this difficulty; it is clear that he knew nothing
for certain of any ethical or physical doctrines going back
to Pythagoras himself; and when he speaks of the Pytha-
gorean system, he always refers it to the Pythagoreans',
sometimes even to ' the so-called Pythagoreans'.
The earliest direct testimony to the eminence of Pythagoras
in mathematical studies seems to be that of Aristotle, who in
his separate book On the Pythagoreans, now lost, wrote that
' Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus, first worked at mathe-
matics and arithmetic,and afterwards,at one time, condescended
to the wonder-working practised by Pherecydes.' *
In the Metaphysics he speaks in similar terms of the
Pythagoreans:
'In the time of these philosophers (Leucippus and
Democritus) and before them the so-called Pythagoreans
applied themselves to the study of mathematics, and were
the first to advance that science ; insomuch that, having been
brought up in it, they thought that its principles must be
the principles of all existing things/ 2
It is certain that the Theory of Numbers originated in
the school of Pythagoras; and, with regard to Pythagoras
himself, we are told by Aristoxenus that he ' seems to have
attached supreme importance to the study of arithmetic,
which he advanced and took out of the region of commercial
utility \3

Numbers and the universe.
We know thatThales (about 624-547 B.C.) and Anaximander
(born probably in 611/10 B.C.) occupied themselves with
astronomical phenomena, and, even before their time, the
principal constellations had been distinguished. 
Pythagoras
(about 572-497 B.C. or a little later) seems to have been
the first Greek to discover that the planets have an inde-
pendent movement of their own from west to east, i.e. in
a direction contrary to the daily rotation of the fixed stars ;
or he may have learnt what he knew of the planets from the
Babylonians. Now any one who was in the habit of intently
studying the heavens would naturally observe that each
constellation has two characteristics, the number of the stars
which compose it and the geometrical figure which they
form. Here, as a recent writer has remarked,1 we find, if not
the origin, a striking illustration of the Pythagorean doctrine.
And, just as the constellations have a number characteristic
of them respectively, so all known objects have a number ;
as the formula of Philolaus states, 'all things which can
be known have number; for it is not possible that without
number anything can either be conceived or known \2
This formula, however, does not yet express all the content
of the Pythagorean doctrine. Not only do all things possess
numbers; but, in addition, all things are numbers ; ' these
thinkers', says Aristotle, ' seem to consider that number is
the principle both as matter for things and as constituting
their attributes and permanent states \3 
True, Aristotle
seems to regard the theory as originally based on the analogy
between the properties of things and of numbers.
' They thought they found in numbers, more than in fire,
earth, or water, many resemblances to things which are and
become; thus such and such an attribute of numbers is jus-
tice, another is soul and mind, another is opportunity, and so
on; and again they saw in numbers the attributes and ratios
of the musical scales. Since, then, all other things seemed
in their whole nature to be assimilated to numbers, while
numbers seemed to be the first things in the whole of nature,

they supposed the elements of numbers to be the elements
of all things, and the whole heaven to be a musical scale and
a number/1
This passage, with i^s assertion of ' resemblances' and
' assimilation', suggests numbers as affections, states, or rela-
tions rather than as substances, and the same is implied by
the remark that existing things exist by virtue of their
imitation of numbers.2 
But again we are told that the
numbers are not separable from the things, but that existing
things, even perceptible substances, are made up of numbers;
that the substance of all things is number, that things are
numbers, that numbers are made up from the unit, and that the
whole heaven is numbers.3 Still more definite is the statement
that the Pythagoreans ' construct the whole heaven out of
numbers, but not of monadic numbers, since they suppose the
units to have magnitude \ and that, ' as we have said before,
the Pythagoreans assume the numbers to have magnitude'.4
Aristotle points out certain obvious difficulties. 
On the one
hand the Pythagoreans speak of ' this number of which the
heaven is composed'; on the other hand they speak of ' attri-
butes of numbers ' and of numbers as ' the causes of the things
which exist and take place in the heaven both from the begin-
ning and now \ 
Again, according to them, abstractions and
immaterial things are also numbers, and they place them in
different regions; for example, in one region they place
opinion and opportunity, and in another, a little higher up or
lower down, such things as injustice, sifting, or mixing.
Is it this same 'number in the heaven' which we must
assume each of these things to be, or a number other than
this number?5
May we not infer from these scattered remarks of Aristotle
about the Pythagorean doctrine that 'the number in the
heaven' is the number of the visible stars, made up of
units which are material points? 
And may this not be
the origin of the theory that all things are numbers, a
theory which of course would be confirmed when the further

capital discovery was made that musical harmonies depend
on numerical ratios, the octave representing the ratio 2: 1
in length of string, the fifth 3: 2 and the fourth 4:3?
The use by the Pythagoreans of visible points to represent
the units of a number of a particular form is illustrated by
the remark of Aristotle that
'Eurytus settled what is the number of what object (e.g.
this is the number of a man, that of a horse) and imitated
the shapes of living things by pebbles after the manner of
those who bring numbers into the forms of triangle or
square \1
They treated the unit, which is a point without position
(aTtyfifj aOsTos), as a point, and a point as a unit having
position ([lova? diaif

Definitions of the unit and of number.
Aristotle observes that the One is reasonably regarded as
not being itself a number, because a measure is not the things
measured, but the measure or the One is the beginning (or
principle) of number.3 This doctrine may be of Pythagorean
origin; Nicomachus has it 4; Euclid implies it when he says
that a unit is that by virtue of which each of existing things
is called one, while a number is 'the multitude made up of
units'5; and the statement was generally accepted. According
to Iamblichus,0 Thymaridas (an ancient Pythagorean, probably
not later than Plato's time) defined a unit as ' limiting quan-
tity ' (irepaivovaa noo-orr)?) or, as we might say, 'limit of few-
ness ', while some Pythagoreans called it ' the confine between
number and parts', i.e. that which separates multiples
and submultiples. Chrysippus (third century B.C.) called it
'multitude one' (irXfjdos eV), a definition objected to by
Iamblichus as a contradiction in terms, but important as an
attempt to bring 1 into the conception of number.
The first definition of number is attributed to Thales, who
defined it as a collection of units (fxovdSoDv avarTrj/ia), ' follow-

ing the Egyptian view'.1 The Pythagoreans 'made number
out of one72; some of them called it * a progression of multi-
tude beginning from a unit and a regression ending in it'.3
(Stobaeus credits Moderatus, a Neo-Pythagorean of the time
of Nero, with this definition.4) 
Eudoxus defined number as
a ' determinate multitude' (irXfjOos inpiayievov)? Nicoma-
chus has yet another definition, ' a flow of quantity made up
of u n i t s ' G (7TO(T6T7]TO9 x^/jLa 
*K f^o^^ooy 
avyKeifievoi'). 
Aris-
totle gives a number of definitions equivalent to one or other
of those just mentioned, 'limited multitude',7 'multitude (or
' combination') of units ',8 (multitude of indivisibles ',9 ' several
ones' (eVa irXeico),10 'multitude measurable by one',11 'multi-
tude measured', and ' multitude of measures'12 (the measure
being the unit).
Classification of numbers.
The distinction between odd (irepio-aos;) and even (apTtos)
doubtless goes back to Pythagoras. 
A Philolaus fragment
says that ' number is of two special kinds, odd and even, with
a third, even-odd, arising from a mixture of the two; and of
each kind there are many forms \13 According to Nicomachus,
the Pythagorean definitions of odd and even were these:
' An even number is that which admits of being divided, by
one and the same operation, into the greatest and the least
parts, greatest in size but least in number (i. e. into two halves)
. . ., while an odd number is that which cannot be so divided
but is only divisible into two unequal parts.'14
Nicomachus gives another ancient definition to the effect
that
' an even number is that which can be divided both into two
equal parts and into two unequal parts (except the funda-
mental dyad which can only be divided into two equal parts),
but, however it is divided, must have its twTo parts of the same
hind without part in the other kind (i, e. the two parts are

both odd or both even); while an odd number is that which,
however divided, must in any case fall into two unequal parts,
and those parts always belonging to the two different kinds
respectively (i.e. one being odd and one even)/*•
In the latter definition we have a trace of the original
conception of 2 (the dyad) as being, not a number at all, but
the principle or beginning of the even, just as one was not a
number but the principle or beginning of number; the defini-
tion implies that 2 was not originally regarded as an even
number, the qualification made by Nicomachus with reference
to the dyad being evidently a later addition to the original
definition (Plato already speaks of two as even).2
With regard to the term ' odd-even', it is to be noted that?
according to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans held that ' the One
arises from both kinds (the odd and the even), for it is both
even and odd \3 The explanation of this strange view might
apparently be that the unit, being the principle of all number,
even as well as odd, cannot itself be odd and must therefore
be called even-odd. There is, however, another explanation,
attributed by Theon of Smyrna to Aristotle, to the effect that the
unit when added to an even number makes an odd number, but
when added to an odd number makes an even number: which
could not be the case if it did not partake of both species;
Theon also mentions Archytas as being in agreement with this
view.4 But, inasmuch as the fragment of Philolaus speaks of
4 many forms' of the species odd and even, and ' a third'
(even-odd) obtained from a combination of them, it seems
more natural to take 'even-odd' as there meaning, not the
unit, but the product of an odd and an even number, while, if
' even' in the same passage excludes such a number, ' even'
would appear to be confined to powers of 2, or 2n.
We do not know how far the Pythagoreans advanced
towards the /later elaborate classification of the varieties of
odd and even numbers. But they presumably had not got
beyond the point of view of Plato and Euclid. In Plato we
have the terms 'even-times even' (dprta dpriaKis), 'odd-
times odd* (irepiTTa TrtpiTT&Kis), ' odd-times even' 
(dpria

and 'even-times odd1 (nepiTTa aprta/as), which
are evidently used in the simple sense of the products of even
and even, odd and odd, odd and even, and even and odd
factors respectively.1 Euclid's classification does not go much
beyond this; he does not attempt to make the four defini-
tions mutually exclusive.2 An ' odd-times odd * number is of
course any odd number which is not prime; but ' even-times
even' (' a number measured by an even number according to
an even number5) does not exclude i even-times odd' (' a
number measured by an even number according to an odd
number'); e.g. 24, which is 6 times 4, or 4 times 6, is also
8 times 3. Euclid did not apparently distinguish, any more
than Plato, between ' even-times odd' and ' odd-times even'
(the definition of the latter in the texts of Euclid was pro-
bably interpolated). 
The Neo-Pythagoreans improved the
classification thus. With them the l even-times even ' number
is that which has its halves even, the halves of the halves
even, and so on till unity is reached' 3 ; in short, it is a number
of the form 2n. The ' even-odd' number (aprioTripiTros in one
word) is such a number as, when once halved, leaves as quo-
tient an odd number,4 i.e. a number of the form 2 (2m+l).
The ' odd-even' number {ir^pKra-dpTLos) is a number such that
it can be halved twice or more times successively, but the
quotient left when it can no longer be halved is an odd num-
ber not unity,5 i.e. it is a number of the form 2n+1 (2m4-1).
The ' odd-times odd' number is not defined as such by
Nicomachus and lamblichus, but Theon of Smyrna quotes
a curious use of the term ; he says that it was one of the
names applied to prime numbers (excluding of course 2), for
these have two odd factors, namely 1 and the number itself.6
Prime or incomposite numbers (777x0709 KOLI ao-vvOeros) and
secondary or composite numbers (Sevrepo? KOU CTVVOZTOS;) are
distinguished in a fragment of Speusippus based upon works
of Philolaus.7 We are told 8 that Thymaridas called a prime
number rectilinear (evdvypa/x/AiKos), the ground being that it
can only be set out in one dimension9 (since the only measure

of it, excluding the number itself, is 1); Theon of Smyrna
gives euthymetric and linear as alternative terms,1 and the
latter (ypafi/iLKos) also occurs in the fragment of Speusippus.
Strictly speaking, the prime number should have been called
that which is rectilinear or linear only. 
As we have seen,
2 was not originally regarded as a prime number, or even as
a number at all. But Aristotle speaks of the dyad as ' the
only even number which is prime/ 2 showing that this diver-
gence from early Pythagorean doctrine took place before
Euclid's time. Euclid defined a prime number as ' that which
is measured by a unit alone V3 a composite number as ' that
which is measured by some number ',4 while he adds defini-
tions of numbers ' prime to one another' (' those which are
measured by a unit alone as a common measure') and of
numbers ' composite to one another' (' those which are mea-
sured by some number as a common measure ').5 Euclid then,
as well as Aristotle, includes 2 among prime numbers. Theon
of Smyrna says that even numbers are not measured by the
unit alone, except 2, which therefore is odd-like without being
prime.6 The Neo-Pythagoreans, Nicomachus and Iamblichus,
not only exclude 2 from prime numbers, but define composite
numbers, numbers prime to one another, and numbers com-
posite to one another as excluding all even numbers; they
make all these categories subdivisions of odd? Their object
is to divide odd into three classes parallel to the three subdivi-
sions of even, namely even-even = 2n, even-odd = 2,(2m+l)
and the quasi-intermediate odd-even = 2W+1 (2m+ 1); accord-
ingly they divide odd numbers into (a) the prime' and
incomposite, which are Euclid's primes excluding 2, (6) the
secondary and composite, the factors of which must all be not
only odd but prime numbers, (c) those which are ' secondary and
composite in themselves but prime and incomposite to another
number/ e.g. 9 and 25, which are both secondary and com-
posite but have no common measure except 1. 
The incon-
venience of the restriction in. (b) is obvious, and there is the

' Perfect' and ' Friendly' numbers.
There is no trace in the fragments of Philolaus, in Plato or
Aristotle, or anywhere before Euclid, of the perfect number
(reXe^oy) in the well-known sense of Euclid's definition
(VII. Def. 22), a number, namely, which is 'equal to (the
sum of) its own parts' (i.e. all its factors including 1),
e.g. 
6 = 1 + 2 + 3; 28 = 1+2 + 4 + 7 + 14;
496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31+62 + 124 + 248.
The law of the formation of these numbers is proved in
Eucl. IX. 36, which is to the effect that, if the sum of any
number of terms of the series 1, 2, 22, 23 
2n~1 (= Sn) is prime,
then Sn. 2n~l is a ' perfect' number. Theon of Smyrnax and
Nicomachus 2 both define a 6 perfect' number and explain the
law of its formation; they further distinguish from it two
other kinds of numbers, (1) over-perfect (vnepreXris or virepre-
Xetos), so called because the sum of all its aliquot parts is
greater than the number itself, e.g. 12, which is less than
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6, (2) defective (eAA*7P7?)> s o called because the
sum of all its aliquot parts is less than the number itself,
e. g. 8, which is greater than 1+2 + 4. Of perfect numbers
Nicomachus knew four (namely 6. 28, 496, 8128) but no more.
He says they are formed in ' ordered' fashion, there being one
among the units (i.e. less than 10), one among the tens (less
than 100), one among the hundreds (less than 1000), and one
among the thousands (less than a myriad); he adds that they
terminate alternately in 6 or 8. They do all terminate in 6 or
8 (as we can easily prove by means of the formula (2n— 1) 2n'l)i
but not alternately, for the fifth and sixth perfect numbers
both end in 6, and the seventh and eighth both end in 8.
Iamblichus adds a tentative suggestion that there may (el
Tvyoi) in like manner be one perfect number among the first
myriads (less than 100002), one among the second myriads
(less than 100003), and so on ad infinitum? 
This is incorrect,
for the next perfect numbers are as follows :4

With these 'perfect' numbers should be compared the so-
called ' friendly numbers '. Two numbers are ' friendly' when
each is the sum of all the aliquot parts of the other, e.g. 284 and
220 (for 284 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11+20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110,
while 220= 1+2+4 + 71 + 142). Iamblichus attributes the
discovery of such numbers to Pythagoras himself, who, being
asked ' what is a friend ? ' said 'Alter ego \ and on this analogy
applied the term ' friendly' to two numbers the aliquot parts
of either of which make up the other.1
While for Euclid, Theon of Smyrna, and the Neo-Pytha-
goreans the * perfect' number was the kind of number above
described, we are told that the Pythagoreans made 10 the
perfect number. Aristotle says that this was because they
found within it such things as the void, proportion, oddness,
and so on.2 The reason is explained more in detail by Theon
of Smyrna3 and in the fragment of Speusippus. 
10 is the
sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 forming the rerpaKrvs (' their
greatest oath', alternatively called the 'principle of health'4).
These numbers include the ratios corresponding to the musical
intervals discovered by Pythagoras, namely 4 : 3 (the fourth),
though he does not give it; it was, however, known, with all its factors,
in the fifteenth century, as appears from a tract written in German
which was discovered by Curtze (Cod. lat. Monac. 14908). The first
eight * perfect' numbers were calculated by Jean Prestet (d. 1670);
Fermat (1601-65) had stated, and Euler proved, that 23l-l is prime.
The ninth perfect number was found by P. Seelhoff, Zeitschr.f. Math. u.
Physik, 1886, pp. 174 sq.) and verified by E. Lucas (Mathesis, vii, 1887,
pp. 44-6). The tenth was found by R. E. Powers (Bull. Amer. Math.
Soc, 1912, p. 162).

was taken up by Eitler, who discovered no less than sixty-one pairs of
such numbers. Descartes and van Schooten had previously found three
pairs but no more.

3 : 2 (the fifth), and 2 : 1 (the octave). Speusippus observes
further that 10 contains in it the 'linear', 'plane1 and 'solid*
varieties of number; for 1 is a point, 2 is a line,1 3 a triangle,
and 4 a pyramid.2
Figured numbers.
This brings us once more to the theory of figured numbers,
which seems to go back to Pythagoras himself. A point or
dot is used to represent 1; two dots placed apart represent
2, and at the same time define the straight line joining the
two dots; three dots, representing 3, mark out the first
rectilinear plane figure, a triangle; four dots, one of which is
outside the plane containing the other three, represent 4 and
also define the first rectilineal solid figure. It seems clear
that the oldest Pythagoreans were acquainted with the forma-
tion of triangular and square numbers by means of pebbles or
dots3; and we judge from the account of Speusippus's book,
On the Pythagorean Numbers, which was based on works of
Philolaus, that the latter dealt with linear numbers, polygonal
numbers, and plane and solid numbers of all sorts, as well as
with the five regular solid figures.4 The varieties of 'plane
numbers (triangular, square, oblong, pentagonal, hexagonal,
and so on)7 solid numbers (cube, pyramidal, &c.) are all dis-
cussed, with the methods of their formation, by Nicomachus5
and Theon of Smyrna.6
(a) Triangular 
numbers.
To begin with triangular 
numbers. 
It was probably
Pythagoras who discovered that the sum of any number of
successive terms of the series of natural numbers 1, 2, 3 . . .
beginning from 1 makes a triangular number. This is obvious
enough from the following arrangements of rows of points;
Thus l + 2 + 3 + ...+7i = | ^ ( ^ + l ) is a triangular number

FIGURED NUMBERS

of side n. 
The particular triangle which has 4 for its side is
mentioned in a story of Pythagoras by Lucian. 
Pythagoras
told some one to count. 
He said 1, 2, 3, 4, whereon Pytha-
goras interrupted, ' Do you see ? What you take for 4 is 10,
a perfect triangle and our oath'.1 This connects the know-
ledge of triangular numbers with true Pythagorean ideas.
(fi) Square numbers and gnomons.
We come now to square numbers. It is easy to see that, if
we have a number of dots forming and filling
up a square as in the accompanying figure repre-
senting 16, the square of 4, the next higher
square, the square of 5, can be formed by adding
a row of dots round two sides of the original
square, as shown; the number of these dots is
2. 4 + 1, or 9. This process of forming successive squares can
be applied throughout, beginning from the first square
number 1. The successive additions are shown in the annexed
figure between the successive pairs of straight
lines forming right angles; and the succes- __J
sive numbers added to the 1 are
3, 5, 7 . .
that is to say, the successive odd numbers.
This method of formation shows that the
sum of any number of successive terms
of the series of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 . . . starting from
1 is a square number, that, if n2 is any square number, the
addition of the odd number 2n + l makes it into the next
square, (n+l)2, and that the sum of the series of odd num-
bers 1+3 + 5 + 7 + .. . + (2TI+1) = (n+l)2, while
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 +. . . + (2TI,- 1) = 
n2.
All this was known to Pythagoras. The odd numbers succes-
sively added were called gnomons; this is clear from Aristotle's
allusion to gnomons placed round 1 which now produce different
figures every time (oblong figures, each dissimilar to the pre-
ceding one), now preserve one and the same figure (squares)2;
the latter is the case with the gnomons now in question.

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
(y) History of the term ' gnomon\
It will be noticed that the gnomons shown in the above
figure correspond in shape to the geometrical gnomons with
which Euclid, Book II, has_ made us familiar. 
The history of
the word ' gnomon' is interesting. 
(1) It was originally an
astronomical instrument for the measuring of time, and con-
sisted of an upright stick which cast shadows on a plane or
hemispherical surface. This instrument is said to have been
introduced into Greece by Anaximander1 and to have come
from Babylon.2 
Following on this application of the word
' gnomon' (a ' marker' or ' pointer', a means of reading off and
knowing something), we find Oenopides calling a perpendicular
let fall on a straight line from an external point a straight line
drawn ' gnomon-wise' {Kara yvdijiova)^ Next (2) we find the
term used of an instrument for drawing right angles, which
took the form shown in the annexed figure. This seems to
be the meaning in Theognis 805, where it is said
that the envoy sent to consult the oracle at Delphi
should be ' straighter than the TO pi/09 (an instru-
I ment with a stretched string for drawing a circle),
the o-rdBfirj (a plumb-line), and the 
gnomon\
It was natural that, owing to its shape, the gnomon should
then be used to describe (3) the figure which remained of
a square when a smaller square was cut out of it (or the figure
which, as Aristotle says, when added to a square, preserves
the shape and makes up a larger square). The term is used
in a fragment of Philolaus where he says that ' number makes
all things knowable and mutually agreeing in the way charac-
teristic of the gnomon1.4" Presumably, as Boeckh says, the
connexion between the gnomon and the square to which it is
added was regarded as symbolical of union and agreement,
and Philolaus used the idea to explain the knowledge of
things, making the knowing embrace the knoivn as the
gnomon does the square.5 
(4) In Euclid the geometrical
meaning of the word is further extended (II. Def. 2) to cover

HISTORY OF THE TERM 'GNOMON'

the figure similarly related to any parallelogram, instead of
a square; it is defined as made up of ' any
one whatever of the parallelograms about
the diameter (diagonal) with the two com-
plements \ 
Later still (5) Heron of Alex-
andria defines a gnomon in general as that
which, when added to anything, number or figure, makes the
whole similar to that to which it is added.1
(S) Gnomons -of the polygonal numbers.
Theon of Smyrna uses the term in this general sense with
reference to numbers: l All the successive numbers which [by
being successively added] produce triangles or squares or
polygons are called gnomons.'2 
From the accompanying
figures showing successive pentagonal and hexagonal numbers
it will be seen that the outside rows or gnomons to be succes-
sively added after 1 (which is the first pentagon, hexagon, &c.)
are in the case of the pentagon 4, 7, 10 , . . or the terms of an
arithmetical progression beginning from 1 with common differ-
ence 3, and in the case of the hexagon 5, 9, 13 . . . . or the
terms of an arithmetical progression beginning from 1 with
common difference 4. In general the successive gnomonic
numbers for any polygonal number, say of n sides, have
(n — 2) for their common difference.3
(e) Right-angled triangles with sides in rational numbers.
To return to Pythagoras. Whether he learnt the fact from
Egypt or not, Pythagoras was certainly aware that, while
32 + 42 = 52, any triangle with its sides in the ratio of the

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
numbers 3, 4, 5 is right angled. This fact could not but add
strength to his conviction that all things were numbers, for it
established a connexion between numbers and the angles of
geometrical figures. It would also inevitably lead to an
attempt to find other square numbers besides 52 which are
the sum of two squares, or, in other words, to find other sets
of three integral numbers which can be made the sides of
right-angled triangles; and herein we have the beginning of
the indeterminate analysis which reached so high a stage of
development in Diophantus. In view of the fact that the
sum of any* number of successive terms of the series of odd
numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 . . . beginning from 1 is a square, it was
only necessary to pick out of this series the odd numbers
which are themselves squares; for if we take one of these,
say 9, the addition of this square to the square which is the sum
of all the preceding odd numbers makes the square number
which'is the sum of the odd numbers up to the number (9) that
we have taken. But it would be natural to seek a formula
which should enable all the three numbers of a set to be imme-
diately written down, and such a formula is Actually attributed
to Pythagoras.1 This formula amounts to the statement that,
if m be any odd number,
Pythagoras would presumably arrive at this method of forma-
tion in the following way. Observing that the gnomon put
round n2 is 2n + l, he would only have to make 2n+l a
square.
If we suppose that 
2n+ I = m2,
we obtain 
n = \ (m2— 1),
and therefore 
n + 1 = \ (m2 +1).
It follows that

RATIONAL RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES 
81
Another formula, devised for the same purpose, is attributed
to Plato,1 namely
(2m)* + (m a-l) a = (m2+l)2.
We could obtain this formula from that of Pythagoras by
doubling the sides of each square in the latter; but it would
be incomplete if so obtained, for in Pythagoras's formula m is
necessarily odd, whereas in Plato's it need not be. As Pytha-
goras's formula was most probably obtained from the gnomons
of dots, it is tempting to suppose that Plato's was similarly
evolved. Consider the square with n dots in its
side in relation to the next smaller square (n— I)2
and the next larger (n -f1)2. Then n2 exceeds
(n— I)2 by the gnomon 2n—l, but falls short of
(n+1)2 by the gnomon 2n + l. 
Therefore the
square (n+1)2 exceeds the square (n— I)2 by
the sum of the two gnomons 2n — 1 and 2n + \, which
is 4n.
That is, 
4?i + (™-l) 2= (n+1)2,
and, substituting m2 for n in order to make 4n a square, we
obtain the Platonic formula
The formulae of Pythagoras and Plato supplement each
other. 
Euclid's solution (X, Lemma following Prop. 28) is
more general, amounting to the following.
If AB be a straight line bisected at G and produced to D,
then (Eucl. II. 6)
which we may write thus:
uv = c2-b2,
where 
w = c + b, v = c — 6,
and consequently
In order that uv may be a square, says Euclid, u and v
must, if they are not actually squares, be ' similar plane num-
bers ', and further they must be either both odd or both even

in order that b (and c also) may be a whole number. ' Similar
plane' numbers are of course numbers which are the product
of two factors proportional in pairs, as mp. np and mq. nq, or

even or both odd,

is the solution, which includes both the Pythagorean and the
Platonic formulae.
(^) Oblong numbers.
Pythagoras, or the earliest Pythagoreans, having discovered
that, by adding any number of successive terms (beginning
from 1) of the series 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \n (n + l), we obtain
triangular numbers, and that by adding the successive odd
numbers 1 + 3 + 5 + ...+(2TI—1) = n2 we obtain squares, it
cannot be doubted that in like manner they summed the
series of even numbers 2 + 4 + 6 + ... +2n = n(n+l) 
and
discovered accordingly that the sum of any number of succes-
sive terms of the series beginning with 2 was an ' oblong'
number (iTepofj.rJKr)$), with e sides ' or factors differing by 1.
They would also see that the oblong number is double oi
a triangular number. These facts would be brought out by
taking two dots representing 2 and then placing round them,
gnomon-wise and successively, the even numbers 4, 6, &c,
thus:
•t
The successive oblong numbers are
2.3 = 6, 3.4 = 12, 4.5 = 20..., 
n(n+l)...,
and it is clear that no two of these numbers are similar, for
the ratio n:(n + l) is different for all different values of w.
We may have here an explanation of the Pythagorean identi-
fication of ' odd ' with * limit' or ' limited ' and of ' evenJ with

OBLONG NUMBERS 
83
* unlimited' * (cf. the Pythagorean scheme of ten pairs of
opposites, where odd, limit and square in one set are opposed
to even, unlimited and oblong respectively in the other).2 For,
while the adding of the successive odd numbers as gnomons
round 1 gives only one form, the square, the addition of the
successive even numbers to 2 gives a succession of ' oblong '
numbers all dissimilar in form, that is to say, an infinity of
forms. This seems to be indicated in the passage of Aristotle's
Physics where, as an illustration of the .view that the even
is unlimited, he says that, Where gnomons are put round 1,
the resulting figures are in one case always different in
species, while in the other they always preserve one form 3;
the one form is of course the square formed by adding the
odd numbers as gnomons round 1; the words KOU \oap(s
({ and in the separate case', as we may perhaps translate)
imperfectly describe the second case, since in that case
even numbers are put round 2, not 1, but the meaning
seems clear.4 It is to be noted that the word irepofjuJKYj^
(' oblong') is in Theon of Smyrna and Nicomachus limited to
numbers which are the product of two factors differing by
unity, while they apply the term Trpo/xrJKrjs ('prolate', as it
were) to numbers which are the product of factors differing
by two or more (Theon makes npoiirfKr}? include irepofjirJKrj^).
In Plato and Aristotle erepofjirJKris has the wider sense of any
non-square number with two unequal factors.
It is obvious that any 'oblong' number 7i(n+l) 
is the
sum of two equal triangular numbers. Scarcely less obvious
is the theorem of Theon that any square number is made up
of two triangular numbers 5 ; in this case, as is seen from the

figure, the sides of the triangles differ by unity, and of course
= n2.
Another theorem connecting triangular num-
bers and squares, namely that 8 times any
triangular number -f 1 makes a square may
easily go back to the early Pythagoreans. It is
quoted by Plutarch* and used by Diophantus,2 and is equi-
valent to the formula
= 4n(n+l) + l =
It may easily have been proved by means of a figure
made up of dots in the usual way. Two
equal triangles make up an oblong figure
of the form n(n + l), as above. Therefore
we have to prove that four equal figures
of this form with one more dot make up
(2n+ I)2. The annexed figure representing
72 shows how it can be divided into four
' oblong' figures 3 . 4 leaving 1 over.
In addition to Speusippus, Philippus of Opus (fourth
century), the editor of Plato's Laws and author of the Epi-
nomis, is said to have written a work on polygonal numbers.3
Hypsicles, who wrote about 170 B.C., is twice mentioned in
Diophantus's Polygonal Numbers as the author of a c defini-
tion ' of a polygonal number.
The theory of proportion and means.
The ' summary J of Proclus (as to which see the beginning
of Chapter IV) states (if Friedlein's reading is right) that
Pythagoras discovered 'the theory of irrationals (TTJV TOOV
a\6y<ov npayiiareiav) and the construction of the cosmic
figures' (the five regular solids).4 
We are here concerned
with the first part of this statement in so far as the reading
dXoycoj/ (' irrationals') is disputed. Fabricius seems to have
been the first to record the variant dvaXoyoov, which is also
noted by E. F. August5; Mullach adopted this reading from

THE THEORY OF PROPORTION AND MEANS 85
Fabricius. 
avaXoycov is not the correct form of the word, but
the meaning would be ' proportions' or ' proportionals ', and
the true reading may be either rS>v avakoymv (' proportions'),
or, more probably, rS>v dva \6yov ('proportionals'); Diels
reads TGOV dva \dyov, and it would seem that there is now
general agreement that dXoycoi/ is wrong, and that the theory
which Proclus meant to attribute to Pythagoras is the theory
of proportion or proportionals, not of irrationals.
(a) Arithmetic, 
geometric, and harmonic 
means.
It is true that we have no positive evidence of the use by
Pythagoras of proportions in geometry, although he must
have been conversant with similar figures, which imply some
theory of proportion. 
But he discovered the dependence of
musical intervals on numerical ratios, and the theory of means
was developed very early in his school with reference to
the theory of music and arithmetic. 
We are told that in
Pythagoras s time there were three means, the arithmetic,
the geometric, and the subcontrary, and that the name of the
third (' subcontrary') was changed by Archytas and Hippasus
to'harmonic'. 1 
A fragment of Archytass work On Music
actually defines the three ; we have the arithmetic 
mean
when, of three terms, the first exceeds the second by the
same amount as the second exceeds the third; the geometric
mean when, of the three terms, the first is to the second as
the second is to the third; the c subcontrary, which we call
harmonic \ when the three terms are such that' by whatever
part of itself the first exceeds the second, the second exceeds
the third by the same part of the third J.2 That is, if a, b} c
are in harmonic progression, and a = b 4- - 3 we must have

Nicomachus too says that the name ' harmonic mean' was
adopted in accordance with the view of Philolaus about the
' geometrical harmony', a name applied to the cube because
it has 12 edges, 8 angles, and 6 faces, and 8 is the mean

TTJV 
apfXOVlKTJl').1
Iamblichus,2 after Nicomachus,3 mentions a special ' most
perfect proportion' consisting of four terms and called
'musical', which, according to tradition, was discovered by
the Babylonians and was first introduced into Greece by
Pythagoras. It was used, he says, by many Pythagoreans,
e.g. (among others) Aristaeus of Croton, Timaeus of Locri,
Philolaus and Archytas of Tarentum, and finally by Plato
in the Timaeus, where we are told that the double and triple
intervals were filled up by two means, one of which exceeds
and is exceeded by the same part of the extremes (the
harmonic mean), and the other exceeds and is exceeded by
the same numerical magnitude (the arithmetic mean).4 The
proportion is
m a + b ^_ 2ab ,
2 
a + b
an example being 12:9 = 8:6.
(j8) Seven other means distinguished.
The theory of means was further developed in the school
by the gradual addition of seven others to the first three,
making ten in all. The accounts of the discovery of the
fourth, fifth, and sixth are not quite consistent. In one place
Iamblichus says they were added by Eudoxus5; in other
places he says they were in use by the successors of Plato
down to Eratosthenes, but that Archytas and Hippasus made
a beginning with their discovery,6 or that they were part of
the Archytas and Hippasus tradition.7 The remaining four
means (the seventh to the tenth) are said to have been added
by two later Pythagoreans, Myonides and Euphranor.8 From
a remark of Porphyry it would appear that one of the first
seven means was discovered by Simus of Posidonia, but
that the jealousy of other Pythagoreans would have robbed
him of the credit.9

The two lists together give five means in addition to the
first six which are common to both; there would be six more

Nos. 4, 5, 6 of the above means give equations of the second
degree, and he concludes that the geometrical and even the
arithmetical solution of such equations was known to the dis-
coverer of these means, say about the time of Plato*; Hippo-
crates of Chios, in fact, assumed the geometrical solution of
a mixed quadratic equation in his quadrature of lunes.
Pappus has an interesting series of propositions with
regard to eight out of the ten. means defined by him.2 He
observes that if a, ft y be three terms in geometrical pro-
gression, we can form from these terms three other terms
a, 6, c, being linear functions of a, ft y wrhich satisfy respec-
tively eight of the above ten relations; that is to say, he
gives a solution of eight problems in indeterminate analysis

Pappus does not include a corresponding solution for his
No. 1 and No. 7, and Tannery suggests as the reason for this
that, the equations in these cases being already linear, there
is no necessity to assume <xy = /32, and consequently there is
one indeterminate too many.1 Pappus does not so much prove

(y) Plato on geometric means between two squares
or two cubes.
It is well known that the mathematics in Plato's Timaeus
is essentially Pythagorean. It is therefore a priori probable
that Plato nvOayoptfa in the passage2 where he says that
between two planes one mean suffices, but to connect two
solids two means are necessary. By planes and solids he
really means square and cube numbers, and his remark is
equivalent to stating that, if p2, q2 are two square numbers,
while, if p3, g3 are two cube numbers,
p3 : p2q — p2q : pq* = pq* : q*y
the means being of course means in continued geometric pro-
portion. 
Euclid proves the properties for square and cube

numbers in VIII. 11, 12, and for similar plane and solid num-
bers in VIII. 18, 19. 
Nicomachus quotes the substance of
Plato's remark as a Platonic theorem', adding in explanation
the equivalent of Eucl. VIII. 11, 12.1
(S) A theorem of Archytas.
Another interesting theorem relative to geometric means
evidently goes back to the Pythagoreans. If we have two
numbers in the ratio known as emfiopios, or sujierpartieularis,
i.e. the ratio of n + 1 to n, there can be no number which is
a mean proportional between them. The theorem is Prop. 3 of
Euclid's Sectio Canonist and Boetius has preserved a proof
of it by ArchytaSj which is substantially identical with that of
Euclid.3 The proof will be given later (pp. 215-16). So far as
this chapter is concerned, the importance of the proposition lies
in the fact that it implies the existence, at least as early
as the date of Archytas (about 430-365 B.C.), of an Elements
of Arithmetic in the form which we call Euclidean; and no
doubt text-books of the sort existed even before Archytas,
which probably Archytas himself and others after him im-
proved and developed in their turn.
The 'irrational'.
We mentioned above the dictum of Proclus (if the reading
akoyav is right) that Pythagoras discovered the theory, or
study, of irrationals. 
This subject was regarded by the
Greeks as belonging to geometry rather than arithmetic.
The irrationals in Euclid, Book X, are straight lines or areas,
and Proclus mentions as special topics in geometry matters
relating (1) to positions (for numbers have no position), (2) to
contacts (for tangency is between continuous things), and (3)
to irrational straight lines (for where there is division ad
infinitum, there also is the irrational).4 I shall therefore
postpone to Chapter V on the Pythagorean geometry the
question of the date of the discovery of the theory of irra-
tionals. But it is certain that the incommensurability of the

THE 'IRRATIONAL' 
91
diagonal of a square with its side, that is, the ' irrationality'
of V2, was discovered in the school of Pythagoras, and it is
more appropriate to deal with this particular case here, both
because the traditional proof of the facb depends on the
elementary theory of numbers, and because the Pythagoreans
invented a method of obtaining an infinite series of arith-
metical ratios approaching more and more closely to the value
of V2.
The actual method by which the Pythagoreans proved the
fact that V2 is incommensurable with 1 was doubtless that
indicated by Aristotle, a reductio ad absurdum showing that,
if the diagonal of a square is commensurable with its side, it
will follow that the same number is both odd and even.1 This
is evidently the proof interpolated in the texts of Euclid as
X. 117, which is in substance as follows :
Suppose AC, the diagonal of a square, to be commensur-
able with AB, its side ; let a : /3 be their ratio expressed in
the smallest possible numbers.
Then oc >/?, and therefore oc is necessarily > 1.
Now 
AC2:AB2=oc2:^2;
and, since 
AC2 = 2 AB2, a2 = 2 /32.
Hence a2, and therefore oc, is even.
Since oc: /? is in its lowest terms, it follows that j3 must
be odd.
Let oc = 2 y; therefore 4 y2 = 2 /32, or 2 y2 = /32, so that /32,
and therefore /S, is even.
But ft was also odd: which is impossible.
Therefore the diagonal AC cannot be commensurable with
the side AB.
Algebraic equations.
(a) 'Side- and 'diameter-' numbers, giving successive
approximations to V 2.
The Pythagorean method of finding any number of succes-
sive approximations to the value of A/2 amounts to finding
all the integral solutions of the indeterminate equations

the solutions being successive pairs of what were called side-

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
and diameter- (diagonal-) numbers respectively. The law of
formation of these numbers is explained by Theon of Smyrna,
and is as follows.1 The unit, being the beginning of all things,
must be potentially both a side and a diameter. Consequently
we begin with two units, the one being the first side, which we
will call av the other being the first diameter, which we will
call dr
The second side and diameter (a2, d2) are formed from the
first, the third side and diameter (a3, d3) from the second, and
so on, as follows:
a2 = a1-\-d1> 
d2 =
a3 = a2 + d2, Aj = 2 a2 + d2,
Since ax = cZx = 1, it follows that
a2 = 1 + 1 = 2, 
d ^ = 2 . 1 + l = 3,
a4 = 5 + 7 = 12, 
d4 = 2 . 5 + 7 = 17,
and so on.
Theon states, with reference to these numbers, the general
proposition that
and he observes (1) that the signs alternate as successive d's
and a's are taken, d1
2 — 2a1
2 being equal to — 1, d2
2 — 2a2
2
equal to +1, d3
2-2a3
2 equal to —1, and so on, while (2) the
sum of the squares oiall the d's will be double of the squares
of all the a's. [If the number of successive terms in each
series is finite, it is of course necessary that the number should
be even.]
The properties stated depend on the truth of the following
identity
for, if x, y be numbers which satisfy one of the two equations
the formula (if true) gives us two higher numbers, x + y and
2x + y, which satisfy the other of the two equations.
Not only is the identity true, but we know from Proclus

' SIDE-' AND < DIAMETER-' NUMBERS

how it was proved.1 Observing that 'it is proved by him
(Euclid) graphically (ypafAfUKoos) in the Second Book of the
Elements'. Proclus adds the enunciation of Eucl. II. 10.
This proposition proves that, if AB is bisected at G and pro-
duced to D, then#
and, if AG = GB = x and BD = y, this gives
or 
(2x + y)2-2(x + yf = 2x2-y2,
which is the formula required.
We can of course prove the property of consecutive side-
and diameter- numbers algebraically thus:
dH* -2an* = (2 an_t + dn_xf - 2 («„
= -(dn_1»-2aw_1
8)
= + {dn-<?—2 an_2
2), in like mariner ;
and so on.
In the famous passage of the Republic (546 c) dealing with
the geometrical number Plato distinguishes between the
'irrational diameter of 5', i.e. the diagonal of a square having
5 for its side, or ^(50), and what he calls the 'rational
diameter' of 5. The square of the ' rational diameter' is less
by 1 than the square of the ' irrational diameter', and is there-
fore 49, so that the 'rational diameter'is 7; that is, Plato
refers to the fact that 2 .52— 72 = 1, and he has in mind the
particular pair of side- and diameter- numbers, 5 and 7, which
must therefore have been known before his time. As the proof
of the property of these numbers in general is found, as Proclus
says, in the geometrical theorem of Eucl. II. 10, it is a fair
inference that that theorem is Pythagorean, and was prob-
ably invented for the special purpose.

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
(/3) The €7rdv6rj/ia ('bloom') of Thymaridas.
Thymaridas of Paros, an ancient Pythagorean already
mentioned (p. 69), was the author of a rule for solving a
certain set of n simultaneous simple equations connecting n
unknown quantities. The rule was evidently well known, for
it was called by the special name of kndvOrifia, the 'flower' or
e bloom' of Thymaridas.1 (The term endi/drj/ia is not, how-
ever, confined to the particular proposition now in question;
Iamblichus speaks of knavOfuxaTa of the Introductio arith-
metica, ' arithmetical kiravOrjixaTa' and inavOrjfiaTa of par-
ticular numbers.) The rule is stated in general terms and no
symbols are used, but the content is pure algebra. The known
or determined quantities (aypia-jxei/oy) are distinguished from
the undetermined or unknown (aopio-rov), the term for the
latter being the very word used by Diophantus in the expres-
sion 7r\rj0o9 fiovaScov dopio-rov, ' an undefined or undetermined
number of units', by which he describes his dpiO/ios x>r un-
known quantity (= x). The rule is very obscurely worded,
but it states in effect that, if we have the following n equa-
tions connecting n unknown quantities x, xlt x2 . . . xn_v
namely
..,+xn^1 = s,
= a2
the solution is given by
Iamblichus, our informant on this subject, goes on to show
that other types of equations can be reduced to this, so that
the rule does not ' leave us in the lurch } in those cases either.2
He gives as an instance the indeterminate problem represented
by the following three linear equations between four unknown
quantities:
x + y =
%+ z =
x + u= c(y + z).

THE 'EIIAN0HMA ('BLOOM') OF THYMARIDAS 95
From these equations we obtain
x+y+z+u 
= (a+1) (z + u) = (6+1) (u + y) = (c + 1)
If now #, 2/, #, u are all to be integers, x + y + z + u must
contain a + l , 6 + l , c + l as factors. If X be the least common
multiple of a+ 1, 6 + 1, c+1, we can put x + y + z + u = L, and
we obtain from the above equations in pairs
while
These equations are of the type to which Thymaridas's rule
applies, and, since the number of unknown quantities (and
equations) is 4, n—2 is in this case 2, and
The numerator is integral, but it may be an odd number, in
which case, in order that x may be integral, we must take 2 L
instead of L as the value of x + y + z + u.
Iamblichus has the particular case where a = 2, 6 = 3, c = 4.
i i s thus 3 . 4 . 5 = 60, and the numerator of the expression for
x becomes 133 — 60, or 73, an odd number; he has therefore
to put 2 i or 120 in place of L, and so obtains 
x=73,y=7,
0=17, u = 23.
Iamblichus goes on to apply the method to the equations

(y) Area of rectangles in relation to perimeter.
Sluse^in letters to Huygens dated Oct. 4, 1657, and Oct. 25,
1658, alludes to a property of the numbers 16 and 18 of
which he had read somewhere in Plutarch that it was known
to the Pythagoreans, namely that each of these numbers
represents the perimeter as well as the area of a rectangle;
for 4.4 = 2.4 + 2.4 and 3.6 = 2. 3 + 2.6. I have not found the
passage of Plutarch, but the property of 16 is mentioned in the
Theologumena Arithmetices, where it is said that 16 is the only
square the area of which is equal to its perimeter, the peri-
meter of smaller squares being greater, and that of all larger
squares being less, than the area.2 We do not know whether
the Pythagoreans proved that 16 and 18 were the only num-
bers having the property in question; but it is likely enough
that they did, for the proof amounts to finding the integral

solutions of xy = 2 (x + y). This is easy, for the equation is
equivalent to (#—2) (y—2) = 4, and we have only to equate
x — 2 and y—2 to the respective factors of 4. Since 4 is only
divisible into integral factors in two ways, as 2 . 2 or as 1. 4,
we get, as the only possible solutions for x, y, (4, 4) or (3, 6).
Systematic treatises on arithmetic (theory of
numbers).
It will be convenient to include in this chapter some
account of the arithmetic of the later Pythagoreans, begin-
ning with NICOMACHUS. 
If any systematic treatises on
arithmetic were ever written between Euclid (Books VII-IX)
and Nicomachus, none have survived. 
Nicomachus, of
Gerasa, probably the Gerasa in Judaea east of the river
Jordan, flourished about 100 A.D., for, on the one hand, in
a work of his entitled the Enchiridion Harmonices there is
an allusion to Thrasyllus, who arranged the Platonic dialogues,
wrote on music, and was the astrologer-friend of Tiberius ; on
the other hand, the Introductio Arithmetica of Nicomachus
was translated into Latin by Apuleius of Madaura under the
Antonines. 
Besides the yApt6fir)TLK7j elo-aycoyrj, Nicomachus
is said to have written another treatise on the theology or the
mystic properties of numbers, called ©eoXoyov/xepa dpL0/xr]-
TiKrjs, in two Books. The curious farrago which has come
down to us under that title and which was edited by Ast1 is,
however, certainly not by Nicomachus; for among the authors
from whom it gives extracts is Anatolius, Bishop of Laodicaea
(A.D. 270); but it contains quotations from Nicomachus which
appear to come from the genuine work. It is possible that
Nicomachus also wrote an Introduction to Geometry, since in
one place he says, with regard to certain solid numbers, that
they have been specially treated (in the geometrical intro-
duction, being more appropriate to the theory of magnitude?2;
but this geometrical introduction may not necessarily have
been a work of his own.
It is a very far cry from Euclid to Nicomachus. In the

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
Introductio arithmetica we find the form of 
exposition
entirely changed. Numbers are represented in Euclid by
straight lines with letters attached, a system which has the
advantage that, as in algebraical notation, we can work with
numbers in general without the necessity of giving them
specific values; in Nicomachus numbers are no longer de-
noted by straight lines, so that, when different undetermined
numbers have to be distinguished, this has to be done by
circumlocution, which makes the propositions cumbrous and
hard to follow, and it is necessary, after each proposition
has been stated, to illustrate it by examples in concrete
numbers. Further, there are no longer any proofs in the
proper sense of the word; when a general proposition has been
enunciated, Nicomachus regards it as sufficient to show that
it is true in particular instances; sometimes we are left to
infer the general proposition by induction from particular
cases which are alone given. Occasionally the author makes
a quite absurd remark through failure to distinguish between
the general and the particular case, as when, after he has.
defined the mean which is ' subcontrary to the harmonic' as
being determined by the relation =- 
= -, where a>b>c,
and has given 6, 5, 3 as an illustration, he goes on to observe
that it is a property peculiar to this mean that the product of
the greatest and middle terms is double of the product of the
middle and least,1 simply because this happens to be true in
the particular case! 
Probably Nicomachus, who was not
really a mathematician, intended his Introduction to be, not
a scientific treatise, but a popular treatment of the subject
calculated to awaken in the beginner an interest in the theory
of numbers by making him acquainted with the most note-
worthy results obtained up to date; for proofs of most of his
propositions he could refer to Euclid and doubtless to other
treatises now lost. The style of the book confirms this hypo-
thesis ; it is rhetorical and highly coloured ; the properties of
numbers are made to appear marvellous and even miraculous 5
the most obvious relations between them are stated in turgid
language very tiresome to read. It was the mystic rather
than the mathematical side of the theory of numbers that

interested Nicomachus. 
If the verbiage is eliminated, the
mathematical content can be stated in quite a small com-
pass. Little or nothing in the book is original, and, except
for certain definitidns and refinements of classification, the
essence of it evidently goes back to the early Pythagoreans.
Its success is difficult to explain except on the hypothesis that
it was at first read by philosophers rather than mathemati-
cians (Pappus evidently despised it), and afterwards became
generally popular at a time when there were no mathemati-
cians left, but only philosophers who incidentally took an
interest in mathematics. But a success it undoubtedly was;
this is proved by the number of versions or commentaries
which appeared in ancient times. Besides the Latin transla-
tion by Apuleius of Madaura (born about A.D. 125), of which
no trace remains, there was the version of Boetius (born about
480, died 524 A.D.); and the commentators include Iamblichus
(fourth century), Heronas,1 Asclepins of Tralles (sixth century),
Joannes Philoponus, Proclus.2 The commentary of Iamblichus
has been published,3 as also that of Philoponus,4 while that of
Asclepius is said to be extant in MSS. When (the pseudo-)
Lucian in his Philopatris (c. 12) makes Critias say to Triephon
(you calculate like Nicomachus', we have an indication that
the book was well known, although the remark may be less a
compliment than a laugh at Pythagorean subtleties.5
Book I of the Introductio, after a philosophical prelude
(cc. 1-6), consists principally of definitions and laws of forma-
tion. Numbers, odd and even, are first dealt with (c. 7)\ then
comes the subdivision of even into three kinds (1) evenly-even,
of the form 2n
} (2) even-odd, of the form 2 (2 n +1), and (3)
odd-even, of the form 2m+1 (2 n+ 1), the last-named occupying
a sort of intermediate position in that it partakes of the
character of both the others. The odd is next divided into
three kinds : (1) ' prime and incomposite', (2) ' secondary and

learn to calculate, for your oath is mere arithmetic and you calculate-

even and not regarded as prime), and (3)' that which is in itself

intermediate class between the two others (cc. 11-13); the
defects of this classification have already been noted (pp. 73-4)
In c. 13 we have these different classes of odd numbers ex-
hibited in a description of Eratosthenes's ' sieve' (KOCTKLVOV), an
appropriately named device for finding prime numbers. The
method is this. We set out the series of odd numbers begin-
ning from 3.
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31,
Now 3 is a prime number, but multiples of 3 are not; these
multiples, 9, 15... are got by passing over two numbers at
a time beginning from 3 ; we therefore strike out these num-
bers as not being prime. Similarly 5 is a prime number, but
by passing over four numbers at a time, beginning from 5, we
get multiples of 5, namely 15, 25 . . .; we accordingly strike
out all these multiples of 5. In general, if n be a prime num-
ber, its multiples appearing in the series are found by passing
over n—1 terms at a time, beginning from n; and we can
strike out all these multiples. When we have gone far enough
with this process, the numbers which are still left will be
primes. Clearly, however, in order to make sure that the
odd number 2 n + 1 in the series is prime, we should have to
try all the prime divisors between 3 and \/(2?i-f 1); it is
obvious, therefore, that this primitive empirical method would
be hopeless as a practical means of obtaining prime numbers
of any considerable size.
The same c. 13 contains the rule for finding whether two
given numbers are prime to one another; it is the method of
Eucl. VII. 1, equivalent to our rule for finding the greatest
common measure, but Nicomachus expresses the whole thing
in words, making no use of any straight lines or symbols to
represent the numbers. If there is a common measure greater
than unity, the process gives it; if there is none, i. e. if 1 is
left as the last remainder, the numbers are prime to one
another.

deficient (eWinrjs), and perfect (rlAetoy) numbers respectively.
The definitions, the law of formation of perfect numbers,
and Nicomachus's observations thereon have been given above
(p. 74).
Next comes (cc. 17-23) the elaborate classification of
numerical ratios greater than unity, with their counterparts
which are less than unity. There are five categories of each,
and under each category there is (a) the general name, (6) the
particular names corresponding to the particular numbers
taken.
The enumeration is tedious, but, for purposes of reference,
is given in the following table:—

In c. 23 Nicomachus shows how these various ratios can be
got from one another by means of a certain rule. Suppose
that
a, b,c
are three numbers such that a:b = b:c = one of the ratios
described ; we form the three numbers
a + b, 
a+2b+c
a,
and also the three numbers
c, 
c + b,
c+2b+a
Two illustrations may be given. Ifc6 = 6 = c = l, repeated
application of the first formula gives (1, 2, 4), then (1, 3, 9),
then (1, 4, 16), and so on, showing the successive multiples.
Applying the second formula to (1, 2, 4), we get (4, 6, 9) where
the ratio is f; similarly from (1, 3, 9) we get (9, 12,16) where
the ratio is f, and so on; that is, from the 7ro\\a7r\d<rioi we
get the kirifiopLoi Again from (9, 6, 4), where the ratio is
of the latter kind, we get by the first formula (9, 15, 25),
giving the ratio If, an €7rifjL€prj$, and by the second formula
(4, 10, 25), giving the ratio 2\, a 7ro\\a7r\a<n€7rifjL6pio$. 
And
so on.
Book II begins with two chapters showing how, by a con-
verse process, three terms in continued proportion with any
one of the above forms as common ratio can be reduced to
three equal terms. If

are the original terms, a being the smallest, we take three
terms of the form
a, 
b — a, 
{c — a — 2(b — a)} = c + a~ 26,
then apply the same rule to these three, and so on.
In cc. 3-4 it is pointed out that, if

then

the vertical rows are successive numbers in the ratio r/(r+ 1),
while diagonally we have the geometrical series 1, r + 1 ,
(r + 1)2, (r+1)3....
Next follows the theory of polygonal numbers. It is pre-
faced by an explanation of the quasi-geometrical way of
representing numbers by means of dots or a's. Any number
from 2 onwards can be represented as a line; the plane num-
bers begin with 3, which is the first number that can be
represented in the form of a triangle; after triangles follow
squares, pentagons, hexagons, &c. (c. 7). Triangles (c. 8) arise
by adding any number of successive terms, beginning with 1,
of the series of natural numbers
1, 2, 3, ... n, ....
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press

106 
PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
The gnomons of triangles are therefore the successive natural
numbers. Squares (c. 9) are obtained by adding any number
of successive terms of the series of odd numbers, beginning
with 1, or
1,3, 5, ... 2^-1,....
The gnomons of squares are the successive odd numbers.
Similarly the gnomons of pentagonal numbers (c. 10) are the
numbers forming an arithmetical progression with 3 as com-
mon difference, or
1,4,7,... l + (^_l)3,...;
and generally (c. 11) the gnomons of polygonal numbers of a
sides are
1, l + (a_2), 1+2 (a-2),... 1+(r-1) (a-2),...
and the a-gonal number with side n is
= n + %n(n-l)(a — 2)
The general formula is not given by Nicomachus, who con-
tents himself with writing down a certain number of poly-
gonal numbers of each species up to heptagons.
After mentioning (c. 12) that any square is the sum of two
successive triangular numbers, i.e.
n* = \(n -1) n + % n (n + 1),
and that an a-gonal number o£ side n is the sum of an
(a—l)-gonal number of side n plus a triangular number of
side n—1, i.e.
n + %n(n-l) (a — 2) = n + %n(n- l)(a-3) + ^n(n-l)J
he passes (c. 13) to the first solid number, the pyramid. The
base of the pyramid may be a triangular, a square, or any
polygonal number. If the base has the side n, the pyramid is
formed by similar and similarly situated polygons placed
successively upon it, each of which has 1 less in its side than
that which precedes it; it ends of course in a unit at the top,
the unit being 'potentially* any polygonal number. Nico-
machus mentions the first triangular pyramids as being 1, 4,
10, 20, 35, 56, 84, and (c. 14) explains the formation of the
series of pyramids with square bases, but he gives no general

formula or summation. An a-gonal number with n in its
side being

it follows that the pyramid with that polygonal number for
base is

A pyramid is KoXovpos, truncated, when the unit is cut off
the top, SiKoXovpos, twice-truncated, when the unit and the
next layer is cut off, rpiKoXovpos, thrice-truncated, when three
layers are cut off, and so on (c. 14).
Other solid numbers are then classified (cc. 15-17): cubes,
which are the product of three equal numbers; scalene num-
bers, which are the product of three numbers all unequal,
and which are alternatively called wedges (o-cfrrjj/io-Koi), stakes
(<r(/)r]Kio'Koi), or altars (ft&fiio-Koi). The latter three names are
in reality inappropriate to mere products of three unequal
factors, since the figure which could properly be called by
these names should taper, i. e. should have the plane face at
the top less than the base. We shall find when we come to
the chapter on Heron's mensuration that true v (geometrical)
ficD/jLio-Koi and cr$r)vi<TKoi have there to be measured in which
the top rectangular face is in fact smaller than the rectangular
base parallel to it. Iamblichus too indicates the true nature
of PoojiicrKoi and acprjvio-Koc when he says that they have not
only their dimensions but also their faces and angles unequal,
and that, while the TTXLVOIS or SOKLS corresponds to the paral-
lelogram, the a(/>r)i/LaKos corresponds to the trapezium.1 The
use, therefore, of the terms in question as alternatives to scalene
appears to be due to a misapprehension. 
Other varieties of
solid numbers are parallelepipeds, in which there are faces
which are erepo^rjKets (oblong) or of the form n(n-\-l), 
so
that two factors differ by unity; beams (8OKL$*$) or columns
(crTrjXiSes, Iamblichus) of the form m2 (on + n); tiles (jrXivOiSes)
of the form m2(m—n). 
Cubes, the last digit (the units) of
which are the same as the last digit in the side, are spherical

(crcjxiipiKoi) or recurring (dTroKaTao-raTiKoi); these sides and
cubes end in 1,5, or 6, and, as the squares end in the same
digits, the squares are called circular (KVKXLKOI).
Oblong numbers (irepofxrJK€Ls) are, as we have seen, of the
form m(m+l); prolate numbers (7rpo/irJK€is) of the form
m(m + ri) where n> 1 (c. 18). Some simple relations between
oblong numbers,* squares, and triangular numbers are given
(cc. 19-20). If hn represents the oblong number n (n+ 1), and
tn the triangular number ^n(n+l) 
of side n, we have, for
example,
hn/n2 == (n + l)/n, 
hn-n2=z 
n} n2/hn^ = 
n/(n-1),
n2±n = A i,
all of which formulae are easily verified.
8um of series of cube numbers.
C. 20 ends with an interesting statement about cubes. If,
says Nicomachus, we set out the series of odd numbers
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ...
the first (1) is a cube, the sum of the next two (3 -f 5) is a
cube, the sum of the next three (7 -f 9 + 11) is a cube, and so on.
We can prove this law by assuming that nz is equal to the
sum of n odd numbers beginning with 2 x +1 and ending
with 2x + 2n — l. 
The sum is (2x + n)n; 
since therefore
n = n3,
and the formula is
By putting successively n = 1, 2, 3 ... r, &c, in this formula
and adding the results we find that
The number of terms in this series of odd numbers is clearly
1+2 + 3 + .. , + r 
or 
| r ( r + l ) .
Therefore 
l3 + 23 + 3 3+...+ r3 = Jr(r+1) (l+r 2 + r - l )

SUM OF SERIES OF CUBE NUMBERS 
109
Nicoinachus does not give this formula, but it was known
to the Roman agrimensores, and it would be strange if
Nicomachus was not aware of it. 
It may have been dis-
covered by the same mathematician who found out the
proposition actually stated by Nicomachus', which probably
belongs to a much earlier time. For the Greeks were from
the time of the early Pythagoreans accustomed to summing
the series of odd numbers by placing 3, 5, 7, &c, successively
as gnomons round 1; they knew that the result, whatever
the number of gnomons, was always a square, and that, if the
number of gnomons added to 1 is (say) r,the sum (including
the 1) is (r+1)2. Hence, when it was once discovered that
the first cube after 1, i.e. 23, is 3 + 5, the second, or 33, is
7 + 9 + 11, the third, or 43, is 13 + 15 +17 + 19, and so on, they
were in a position to sum the series l3 + 23 + 3 3+...+r 3;
for it was only necessary to find out how many terms of the
series 1 4- 3 + 5 + ... this sum of cubes includes. 
The number
of terms being clearly 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + r, the number of
gnomons (including the 1 itself) is -^(r-f-l); hence the sum
of them all (including the 1), which is equal to
is {%r(r+l)}2. 
Fortunately we possess apiece of evidence
which makes it highly probable that the Greeks actually
dealt with the problem in this way. Alkarkhi, the Arabian
algebraist of the tenth-eleventh century, wrote an algebra
under the title Al-Fakhri. 
It would seem that there were at
the time two schools in Arabia which were opposed to one
another in that one favoured Greek, and the other Indian,
methods. Alkarkhi was one of those who followed Greek
models almost exclusively, and he has a proof of the theorem
now in question by means of a figure with gnomons drawn
in it, furnishing an excellent example of the geometrical
algebra which is so distinctively Greek.
Let AB be the side of a square AC; let
AB =1 + 2 + ...+n = %n(n + l)9
and suppose BB' = n, BfBtr = n-1, B"Br" = n- 2, and so on.
Draw the squares on AB', AB"... 
forming the gnomons
shown in the figure.

Then the gnomon

= BB'(BC+CD!).
Now BO =
therefore (gnomon BCD) 
—n.7i2=nz.
Similarly (gnomon B'C'D') = (n-lf, 
and so on.
Therefore l3 + 23 + ... +nz = the sum of the gnomons round
the small square at A which has 1 for its side plus that small
square; that is,
l3 + 23 + 33+... + n3 = square AC = {%n(n + l)}2.
It is easy to see that the first gnomon about the small
square at A is 3 + 5 = 23, the next gnomon is 7 + 9 + 11 = 33,
and so on.
The demonstration therefore hangs together with the
theorem stated by Nicomachus. Two alternatives are possible.
Alkarkhi may have devised the proof himself in the Greek
manner, following the hint supplied by Nieomachus's theorem.
Or he may have found the whole proof set out in some
Greek treatise now lost and reproduced it. Whichever alter-
native is the true one, we can hardly doubt the Greek origin
of the summation of the series of cubes.
Nicomachus passes to the theory of arithmetical proportion
and the various means (cc. 21-9), a description of which has
already been given (p. 87 above). 
There are a few more
propositions to be mentioned under this head. If a—b = b—c,
so that a, b, c are in arithmetical progression, then (c. 23. 6)
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press

NICOMACHUS 
111
a fact which, according to Nicomachus, was not generally-
known. 
Boetius1 mentions this proposition which, if we
take a + d, a, a — d as the three terms in arithmetical pro-
gression, may be written a2 = (a + d) (a — d) + d*. This is
presumably the origin of the regula Nicomachi quoted by
one Ocreatus (? O'Creat), the author of a tract, Prologus in
Helceph, written in the twelfth or thirteenth century2
('Helceph' or 'Helcep' is evidently equivalent to Algo-
riswius; may it perhaps be meant for the Al-Kdf% of
Alkarkhi?). The object of the regula is to find the square
of a number containing a single digit. 
If d= 10 — a, or
a + d — 10, the rule is represented by the formula*
a 2 = 10 (a-d) + d2,
so that the calculation of a2 is made to depend on that of d2
which is easier to evaluate if d<a.
Again (c. 24. 3, 4), if a, b, c be three terms in descending
geometrical progression, r being the common ratio (a/6 or 6/c),
then
a — 6 
a 
b
6 — c ~~ b ~~ c
and 
(«-&) = (r-l)6, 
(6-c) = (r- l)c,
It follows that
6 = a—&(r— 1) = c + c (r— 1).
This is the property of three terms in geometrical pro-
gression which corresponds to the property of three terms
a, 6, c of a harmonical progression
7 
a 
c
6 = a 
= c + -3
from which we derive
n = (a + c) /(a — c).
If a, 6, c are in descending order, Nicomachus observes
(c. 25) that r < = > - according as a, 6, c are in arith-
metical, geometrical, or harmonical progression.

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
The 'Platonic theorem 
(c. 24. 6) about the number of
possible means (geometric) between two square numbers and
between two cube numbers respectively has already been
mentioned (pp. 89, 90), as also the 'most perfect proportion'
(p. 86).
THEON OF SMYRNA was the author of a book purporting
to be a manual of mathematical subjects such as a student
would require to enable him to understand Plato. A fuller
account of this work will be given later; at present we are
only concerned with the arithmetical portion. This gives the
elementary theory of numbers on much the same lines as
we find it in Nicomachus, though less systematically. We
can here pass over the things which are common to Theon
and Nicomachus and confine ourselves to what is peculiar to
the former. 
The important things are two. 
One is the
theory of side- and diameter-numbers invented by the Pytha-
goreans for the purpose of finding the successive integral
solutions of the equations 2 x2 — y2 = ± 1; as to this see
pp. 91-3 above. The other is an explanation of the limited
number of forms which square numbers may have.1 If m2 is
a square number, s&ys Theon, either m2 or m2— 1 is divisible
by 3, and again either m2 or m2— 1 is divisible by 4 : which
is equivalent to saying that a square number cannot be of
any of the following forms, 3n+2, 4TI + 2, 4w, + 3. Again, he
says, for any square number m2, one of the following alterna-
tives must hold:

lamblichns states the same facts in a slightly different form.1
The truth of these statements can be seen in the following
way.2 Since any number m must have one of the following
forms
6/c, 6/c+l, 
6k±2,

and for those of the fourth type — and

Again, if
the four forms of squares be divided by 3 or 4, the remainder
is always either 0 or 1; so that, as Theon says, no square can
be of the form 3^+2, 4^ + 2, or 4w+3. We can hardly
doubt that these discoveries were also Pythagorean.
IAMBLICHUS, born at Chalcis in Coele-Syria, was a pupil of
Anatolius and Porphyry, and belongs to the first half of the
fourth century A.D. He wrote nine Books on the Pythagorean
Sect, the titles of which were as follows: I. On the Life of
Pythagoras; II. Exhortation to philosophy (npoTpenTiicbs
km (f>i\o(ro<piai'); III. On mathematical science in general;
IV. On Nicomachus's Introdilctio Arithmetica; V. On arith-
metical science in physics; VI. On arithmetical science in
ethics; VII. On arithmetical science in theology; VIII. On
the Pythagorean geometry; IX. On the Pythagorean music.
The first four of these books survive and are accessible in
modern editions; the other five are lost, though extracts
from VII. are doubtless contained in the Theologumena
arithmetices. Book IV. on Nicomachus's Introductio is that
which concerns us here ; and the few things requiring notice
are the following. The first is the view of a square number

as a race-course (8(av\o?)1 formed of successive numb ers
from 1 (as start, v<T7r\r)g) up to n, the side of the square,
which is the turning-point (Acaju7rr^p), and then back again
through (w—1), (w — 2), &e., to 1 (the goal, vvcraa), thus:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4... 
(w-l) +
1 + 2 + 3 + 4... (n - 2) + (n - 1 ) +
This is of course equivalent to the proposition that n2 is the
sum of the two triangular numbers %n(n+l) and %(n—l)n
with sides n and n— 1 respectively. Similarly Iamblichus
points out2 that the oblong number
<n(n—l) = (i + 2 + 3 + ...+w) + (w — 2 + n— 3 + ... +3+ 2)
He observes that it was on this principle that, after 10,
which was called the unit of the second course (SevTepo*-
Sovfiivq /jLovds), the Pythagoreans regarded 100 = 10.10 as
the unit of the third course (rpLcoSov/ieprj fiov&s), 1000 = 103
as the unit of the fourth course (reTpcoSov/ievi] fiopas), and
so on,3 since
1 + 2 + 3 + . .. + 10 + 9 + 8 + ...+ 2 + 1 = 10.10,
10+ 20+ 30 + ... + 100+ 90+ 80+ ... + 20 + 10 = 103,
100 + 200 + 300 + ... + 1000 + 900 + ... + 200 + 100 = 104,
and so on. Iamblichus sees herein the special virtue of 10 :
but of course the same formulae would hold in any scale
of notation as well as the decimal.
In connexion with this Pythagorean decimal terminology
Iamblichus gives a proposition of the greatest interest.4
Suppose we have any three consecutive numbers the greatest
of which is divisible by 3. Take the sum of the three
numbers; this will consist of a certain number of units,
a certain number of tens, a certain number of hundreds, and
so on. Now take the units in the said sum as they are, then
as many units as there are tens in the sum, as many units as
there are hundreds, and so on, and add all the units so
obtained together (i.e. add the digits of the sum expressed
in our decimal notation). Apply the same procedure to the

result, and so on. Then, says Iamblichus, the final result
will be the number 6. E.g. take the numbers 10, 11, 12; the
sum is 33. 
Add the digits, and the result is 6. 
Take
994, 995, 996 : the sum is 2985 ; the sum of the digits is 24 ;
and the sum of the digits of 24 is again 6. The truth of the
general proposition is seen in this way.1
Let 
F = n0
be a number written in the decimal notation. 
Let
represent the sum of its digits, -8^(N) the sum of the digits
of S(If) and so on.
Now 
JV->S(iV) = 9 (^ + 11^2 + 11171,3+ ...),
whence 
IT = 8(N) 
(mod. 9).
Similarly 
8(IT) = 8&N 
(mod. 9).
Let 
AS^"1) (IT) = 8<tolT (mod. 9)
be the last possible relation of this kind; fifMjV" will be a
number N' 5j 9.
Adding the congruences, we obtain
N=N' 
(mod. 9), while N' < 9.
Now, if we have three consecutive numbers the greatest
of which is divisible by 3, we can put for their sum
and the above congruence becomes
9p + 6 = iV (mod. 9),
so that 
N' = 6 (mod. 9) ;
and, since N' < 9, N' can only be equal to 6.
This addition of the digits of a number expressed in our
notation has an important parallel in a passage of the
Refutation of all Heresies by saint Hippolytus,2 where there
is a description of a method of foretelling future events
called the ' Pythagorean calculus'. 
Those, he says, who
claim to predict events by means of calculations with numbers,
letters and names use the principle of the pythmen or base,

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
that is, what we call a digit of a number expressed in our
decimal notation ; for the Greeks, in the case of any number
above 9, the pythmen was the same number of units as the
alphabetical numeral contains tens, hundreds, thousands, &c.
Thus the p j / f a ^ of 700 (y\r in Greek) is 7 (£); that of
/y (6000) is 9 (6)> and so on. The method then proceeded
to find the pythmen of a certain name, say 'Ayafxifivcov.
Taking the pyttimenes of all the letters and adding them,
we have
Take the pythmenes of 36, namely 3 and 6, and their sum is
9. The pythmen of 'Aya/iifivcoi/ is therefore 9. Next take
the name "E/crco/); the pythmenes are 5, 2, 3, 8, 1, the sum of
which is 19 ; the pythmenes of 19 are 1, 9; the sum of 1 and
9 is 10, the pythmen of which is 1. The pythmen of "EKTMP
is therefore 1. 'It is easier', says/Hippolytus, fto proceed
thus. Finding the pythmenes of the letters, we obtain, in the
case of "EKT&P, 19 as their sum. Divide this by 9 and note
the remainder: thus, if I divide 19 by 9, the remainder is 1,
for nine times 2 is 18, and 1 is left, which will accordingly
be the pythmen of the name "EKTcop.' Again, take the name
Uar/ooAcXo9. The sum of the pythmenes is
8 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 34:
and 3 + 4 = 7, so that 7 is the pythmen of HarpoKkos.
< Those then who calculate by the rule of nine take one-ninth
of the sum of the pythmenes and then determine the sum of
the pyythmenes in the remainder. 
Those on the other hand
who follow the " rule of seven " divide by 7. Thus the sum
of the pythmenes in Jlarpo/cXoy was found to be 34. This,
divided by 7, gives 4, and since 7 times 4 is 28, the remainder
is 6. . . / 
' It is necessary to observe that, if the division
gives an integral quotient (without remainder), . . . the
pythmen is the number 9 itself' (that is, if the rule of nine is
followed). And so on.
Two things emerge from this fragment. (1) The use of the
pythmen was not appearing for the first time when ApoUonius
framed his system for expressing and multiplying large
numbers; it originated much earlier, with the Pythagoreans.

(2) The method of calculating the pythmen is like the opera-
tion of ' casting out nines' in the proof which goes by that
name, where we take the sum of the digits of a number and
divide by 9 to get the remainder. The method of verification
by c casting out nines' came to us from the Arabs, who may,
as Avicenna and Maximus Planudes tell us, have got it from
the Indians; but the above evidence shows that, at all events,
the elements from which it was built up lay ready to hand
in the Pythagorean arithmetic.
