ABSTRACT
The essence of who we are depends on our brains. They 
enable us to think, to feel joy and sorrow, communicate 
through speech, reflect on the moments of our lives, and to 
anticipate, plan for, and worry about our imagined futures. 
Although some of our abilities are comparatively new, key 
features of our behavior have deep roots that can be traced 
to the beginning of life. By following the story of behavior, 
step-by-step, over its roughly four-billion-year trajectory, we 
come to understand both how similar we are to all organisms 
that have ever lived, and how different we are from even our 
closest animal relatives. We care about our differences because 
they are ours. But differences do not make us superior; they 
simply make us different.

Introduction
A couple of years ago, I came across a quote supposedly attributable to the 
American poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson: “as soon as there is life, there is 
danger.” I think the author was referring to the fact that the moment that 
human life begins in the womb, the baby is at risk, and remains in such 
a condition until the eventuality of death. But for me, it had a different 
meaning. What I took from the Emerson quote is that danger began when 
the first cell managed to survive long enough to divide and start the long 
history of continuous life on earth. Danger is only meaningful in the context 
of life. Non-living things passively change in response to the environment 
over time-water evaporates and rocks degenerate-but living things, organ­
isms, must continuously keep themselves alive. When they no longer can, 
they become non-living matter and passively degenerate.
The Deep History of Ourselves: The Four Billion Years Story of How We 
Got Conscious Brains, was motivated by my long-standing interest in how 
organisms detect and respond to danger, but it was more about the more

general topic of what organisms must do to survive, and how this changed, 
but also remained the same, over the long history of life.
Deep History (which is how I will refer to the book here) consists of 
a Prologue and Epilogue, and sixty-six short (1500-2000 word) chapters 
divided into fifteen parts. My thinking was that this snippet format would 
allow readers to absorb one basic idea per chapter, rather than try to wade 
through single, long chapters with many ideas and no obvious break points. 
I was not an expert on evolutionary history, and this format made it easier 
for me to write the book, and I also think for non-expert readers to consume 
it. Admittedly, I ended with more chapters than I expected, and certainly 
more than my publisher wanted, but that’s how it had to be to complete the 
story. After all, I did cover four-billion years (actually more, since the story 
really starts with the Big Bang, which occurred 13 billion or so years ago).
One way to think about Deep History is that I wrote the first third as 
a science journalist, summarizing facts about evolutionary history, much of 
which I learned doing research for the book. By contrast, I wrote the remain­
der as a working scientist discussing topics I know about from decades of 
research. Some reviewers said I could have skipped the first part, but 
I disagree. Researching these chapters gave me insights into how we and 
our brains came to be, and ignoring this, given the story I wanted to tell, 
would have been like writing a biography of a person starting at age 60 or 70.
Prologue
I am a neuroscientist, not an evolutionary biologist. There are evolutionary 
neuroscientists, but I am not one. I’ve spent most of my career working on 
how the brain detects and responds to danger, working out neural circuits. 
In 2009, I spent some time at Cambridge on sabbatical and re-connected 
with Seth Grant, who I knew when he was a post-doc in Eric Kandel’s lab in 
New York. Seth is a neurobiologist who researches the evolution of genes 
involved in synaptic plasticity to understand better the biological mechan­
isms of learning and memory. In his studies, he found parallels in plasticity- 
related genes between rodents and sea slugs, suggesting that they may each 
have inherited the ability to learn from a common ancestor that lived many 
hundreds of millions of years ago. But even more interesting, some of the 
same genes exist in single-cell protozoa. That’s relevant, since animals and 
current-day protozoa share a common ancestor that lived over a billion 
years ago. Some of the learning-related genes in our nervous system may 
therefore come to us via microbial ancestors that didn’t have a nervous 
system, but were able to learn about danger and avoid it. And since bacteria 
go back to the early days of life, and approach nutrients and avoid danger, 
behavior may be as old as life itself. If so, behavior is not fundamentally 
a psychological process, but is simply part of an organism’s biological

survival kit. From there I climbed back up the tree of life, examining how 
behavior changed as different organisms evolved, and how at some point 
mind and consciousness entered the picture. The bottom line is that the 
roots of behavior are deep, but consciousness has a shallower history.
The Biology of Life
An important theme in the book is how Darwin’s idea of a life as 
a branching tree was preceded by ladder metaphors in which organisms 
are linearly stacked on top of one another. Key to the evolutionary tree 
metaphor is the idea of common ancestry. We have monkeys and apes in 
our past, but not present-day monkeys and apes. Instead, we share 
a common ancestor with present day apes, and they share a common 
ancestor with present day monkeys, and so on, all the way back to the 
earliest cell billions of years ago. That’s the amazing thing. Modern science, 
especially genetics, shows that Darwin’s basic idea was correct. All of life can 
be traced to a common ancestor, a cell living billions of years ago.
So how did that early cell that gave rise to the rest of life come to exist? 
I got really sucked into the fascinating views called “beginning of life 
theories.” There are many such ideas, including the primordial pond struck 
by lightning, sugars from space, chemical evolution resulting in replicating 
molecules, black smokestacks in the oceans, and hydrothermal vents that 
catalyzed life in rock pores where replicating molecules were trapped. My 
research pointed to the latter and I visited one of its major proponents, Nick 
Lane, at University College London. His theory is complex, and I did my 
best to describe it. The bottom line is that the replicating molecules trapped 
in rock pores generated a membrane that encased their innards. Once that 
happened, they were able to survive outside of the pores. One kind of these 
managed to survive long enough to divide, and this kind is said to be the last 
universal common ancestor of all of life (LUCA).
LUCA marks the beginning of life at about 3.7 billion years ago. Its 
descendants included the first bacteria, progeny of which we live with 
today. There are many more bacteria on Earth than humans, and many 
more bacteria in your body than there are human cells.
One of the many kinds of bacteria to diverge from the original one was 
archaebacteria, now known as archaea. They were sufficiently different that 
they and bacteria are now classified as separate Kingdoms of life. The DNA 
of these so-called prokaryotic cells is free floating in the cell body.
The next Kingdom, Protista, arrived about two billion years ago. These 
came about after a bacterial cell ended up inside an archaeal cell, and they 
figured out how to coexist – this is called the theory of endosymbiosis. 
Through division of labor, the archaeal cell’s DNA came to be surrounded 
by a membrane, creating a cell nucleus, and the bacterial cell became the

energy machine (mitochondria). Such cells are referred to as eukaryotes. 
They are famous for having invented sexual reproduction, which contrasts 
with the cell division reproductive method of prokaryotes. Eukaryotes were 
also the first predators.
In a single cell microbe, obviously, all the cell functions have to be taken 
care of by the individual cell. But sometimes microbes of a particular type 
adhere together to form colonies that function like a multicellular organism. 
Through division of labor, some cells take care of reproduction, others 
locomotion, and others feeding. This is achieved by chemical interactions 
that regulate gene expression. Specifically, by turning off all functions but one 
in each cell, different cells become specialists rather than generalists. Unlike in 
a multicell organism though, if the cell defects from the colony, all of its 
functions return. By contrast, in a true multicellular organism, cells come with 
a good deal of genetic specialization. For example, a human reproductive cell 
can’t suddenly become a sensory or muscle cell. Because the cells of 
a multicellular organism are interdependent, they cannot live on their own.
Colonies are not organisms. They are collections of cells with different 
genomes. Multicellular organisms are entities that have a single genome, and 
in which all of the cells work together to keep the entity, the organism, alive.
In a typical colony, the cells are not necessarily siblings and thus do not 
have a common genome. But there is a kind of eukaryotic colony in which 
all the cells have the same parent and genome. These are called clonal 
colonies. Plants, fungi and animals, the three multicellular Kingdoms of 
life, resulted from separate kinds of clonal colonies. Animals, for example, 
evolved from a colony consisting of a kind of protozoa. The present-day 
protozoan called choanoflagellates shares a protozoan ancestor with all of 
animal life. Because the cells of multicell organisms are all eukaryotic, 
multicell organisms are also eukaryotic organisms.
The Arrival and Expansion of Animals
Animals are defined by how they differ from the other multicellular organ­
isms. One way is in terms of energy metabolism. Animals get their energy 
from consuming and digesting carbon-containing compounds and breaking 
it down to make glucose as part of their metabolic process. Fungi digest food 
externally and then absorb it to get fuel from glucose. Plants get energy from 
the sun and use it to make glucose.
Another difference is that animals are “animated” (motile). Plants and 
fungi are mostly stationary, making only slow movements that are best seen 
with slow-motion video. In an animal, stimulus information reaches one 
part of the body to cause a part of the body far away from the point of 
stimulation to react in a fraction of a second. This is because in all of life, 
animals, and only animals, have nervous systems.

J. LEDOUX

Like most things in evolution, nervous systems did not suddenly appear. 
They arose by small changes over time, where existing capacities were co- 
opted to make new capacities. For example, the core signaling mechanism of 
neurons, the action potential, arose in microbes as a way to facilitate the 
repair of damaged parts of the cell wall – electrical sparks at the site of the 
injury attracted healing chemicals.
The first animals, sponges, appeared about 700 or 800 millions of years or 
so ago. Present day ones don’t have a nervous system (early ones may have) 
and as adults they are sessile. But in their larval phase they are, like their 
protozoan ancestors, quite motile. In general, the evolutionary history of an 
organism is better reflected early than in later stages. From the beginning, 
the body unfolds under the influence of natural selection on DNA, but each 
step is more and more influenced by the way genes are expressed as a result 
of individual factors, espeically interactions with the environment.
A major group that evolved from sponges was Cnidaria, which includes 
jellyfish. They have what is called a radial body (top and bottom, but no 
front-back or left-right axis), and possess a nervous system consisting of 
a diffuse net of interconnected neurons. From them bilateral animals, which 
possessed a front-back, left-right, and top-bottom axes, evolved. An early 
kind of bilateral animal was the flatworm. Most animals alive today have 
bilaterally symmetric bodies, and are descendants of flatworms that lived 
about 630 million years ago. In contast to Cnidaira, the flatworm had brain 
that provided centralized control over the nervous system.
The two main bilateral groups that evolved from the flatworm ancestor are 
invertebrates such as mollusks, crabs, bugs, spiders, and so on, and verte­
brates, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. This is a highly 
simplified version of the vertebrate history as there was a transition inverte­
brate group called chordates from which vertebrates evolved. Both inverte­
brates and vertebrates went through explosive evolution during the Cambrian 
period, which started about 540 million years ago, spurred on by predator- 
prey competition and the development of associative learning capacities.
Vertebrates and Their Brains
Jawless fish, lamprey, are the oldest living example of early vertebrates. They 
arrived more than 500 million years ago with skeletons made of cartilage. 
Cartilaginous fish with jaws, such as skates, rays and sharks, came next, followed 
by fish with the kinds of boney skeletons most vertebrates today possess.
Life was aquatic until about 465 million years ago when plants colonized 
the land. Their respiratory output generated an increase in atmospheric 
oxygen, which allowed some invertebrates to transition to the land and feed 
on vegetation. Some 350 million years ago, vertebrates invaded the land in 
the form of amphibians that could live aquatically or terrestrially. Their 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY

land-dwelling descendants, amniotes, spawned reptiles about 300 million 
years ago and mammals about 210 million years ago.
The first mammals were tiny nocturnal creatures. They were preyed upon 
by large, vicious dinosaurs. When dinosaurs became extinct about 
65 million years ago due to climatic changes, the low energy needs of smaller 
mammals allowed them to flourish. Mammals then invaded all areas of the 
earth and all habitats. Primates evolved from early mammals 70 million 
years ago, apes from them 25 million years ago, and humans from apes 
about 8 million years ago.
Despite this diversity of vertebrates, there is a profound similarity in their 
brains. All vertebrate brain consists of three major zones: hindbrain, mid­
brain and forebrain. Of particular interest is the forebrain, which changed 
the most over the course of vertebrate evolution. However, the implications 
of this were misunderstood throughout much of the twentieth century,
The problem began in the early 20th century when the German anatomist 
Ludwig Edinger proposed a ladder metaphor to understand brain evolution, 
arguing that the human forebrain reflects a mélange of ancestral vertebrate 
brains stacked on top of one another – a reptilian brain, an early mamma­
lian (non-primate) brain, and a new mammalian (primate) brain. Edinger’s 
line of thought was adopted by leading anatomists in the early 20th century 
and reached a crescent of popularity the 1950s through Paul Maclean’s 
famous “limbic system” and “triune brain” theories. The over-arching con­
clusion was that “man” reflects the apex or pinnacle of brain evolution – that 
we are the pride and joy of mother nature.
I have long been critical of the limbic system/triune brain theory. One key 
issue, amongst many, is that modern research has shown that lower verte­
brates (fish and amphibians) possess primitive equivalents (precursors) of 
the brain areas that MacLean said were unique inventions of lower mam­
mals (limbic areas) and of primates (neocortex). In fact, fish, amphibians, 
and reptiles have all of the major brain regions that mammals possess, just in 
more primitive forms. Yet, the intuitive appeal of MacLean’s ideas allowed 
the limbic system and triune brain theories to survive both as a scientific 
construct and cultural memes.
One consequence of the popularity of the limbic system theory was that 
the inaccurate portrayal of brain evolution made its way into what is called 
basic emotions theory, a modern day version of Darwin’s 1872 paper on 
emotions in man and animals, which argued that we humans inherited 
emotional states of mind and related body expressions from our mamma­
lian ancestors, by way of having inherited features of their nervous system. It 
has been said that Darwin was a great biologist but not so good 
a psychologist. His ideas about emotions were maenat to help his theory 
of body evolution, which was not doing so well, as it challenged cherished 
religious beliefs of Victorian England’s Protestant populace. He therefore 
6
J. LEDOUX

began to focus on the behavioral and mental implications of natural selec­
tion. He did this by applying common sense (folk psychological) assump­
tions about the mind to explain the evolution of emotions. For example, 
since we feel fear when we flee from danger, an animal fleeing from danger 
must feel fear as well. Why else would they flee? He noted humans could see 
jealousy, scorn, pride and contempt in dogs and other mammals. Elizabeth 
Knoll says he justified this approach by saying it was “a more cheerful view” 
than assuming humans have animal- qualities, and the public was more 
likely to accept it. The numerous examples of anthropomorphic analogies in 
his book, according to Knoll, were indeed a factor that helped Victorian 
England come to accept Darwin’s theory of evolution. But by conflating 
causation with correlation, he set animal psychology on a track that was so 
anthropomorphic that it led early 20th century behaviorists to ban mental 
states from psychology for many decades. MacLean, being a brain scientist, 
was not subject to behaviorist dictums, and placed Darwinian emotions in 
the limbic system. Later basic emotions researchers, such as Jaak Panksepp, 
sustained the out-dated Edinger/Maclean view of brain evolution by pro­
moting the idea that different emotional feelings are the products of limbic 
systems circuits.
Primitive behaviors such as withdrawal and approach are universal, life- 
sustaining capacities of all organisms, from bacteria to people. As a result, 
such behaviors may simply exist as part of the homeostatic survival toolkit 
of cells. All organisms have to manage energy resources, regulate intracel­
lular fluids, defend against harm, and reproduce, but the way any one 
organism does these things depends on the kind of body its species evolved. 
That is, survival requirements depend on the kind of body the organism has. 
For example, different mammalian species flee from danger by running, 
flying, or swimming, depending on the kind of locomotory capacities that 
evolved with their bodies. In other words, behaviors are bauplan-dependent 
(species-specific) survival implementations of universal (species-general) 
survival requirements. And survival circuits are the species-specific neural 
implementation by which the behavioral implementation of the universal 
requirement is achieved in each animal.
All vertebrates have an amygdala. A key, but certainly not the only, role of 
this brain area, and especially its component circuits, is to detect and 
respond to dangers they encounter in the course of everyday life.
While we often hear that the amygdala is the brain’s fear center, I think 
this is incorrect. The defensive survival functions of the amygdala that we 
inherited from our vertebrate ancestors is, I believe, the present-day man­
ifestation of a survival imperative that has existed since the beginning of life. 
Yes, we are often afraid when in danger, but that does not mean fear 
bubbling up out of the amygdala causes the experience. This long history 
strongly implies that defensive behavior evolved to keep early cells alive at 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY

least long enough to replicate, and pass their defensive and other survival 
functions on to their progeny. While we humans, and perhaps our mam­
malian ancestors, and maybe some animals, have some kind of subjective 
experiences of fear when in danger, the implication is the primordial func­
tion of defense was not to make the organism feel fear, but to give it 
a behavioral tool for dealing with danger. The same can be said of the 
pleasure or satisfaction we have when we engage in energy management 
(eating), fluid/electrolyte balance (drinking), and reproduction (sex). I will 
discuss how subjective emotional experiences come about later in relation to 
consciousness.
The Rise of Cognition
Behaviorists, of course, rejected cognition, whether in humans, monkeys, rats 
or pigeons, because it was internal and thus unobservable. But an early 
behaviorist, Edward Tolman promoted the idea that lower mammals are 
purposive or goal directed – that they used cognitive maps to navigate when 
foraging for food or escaping from harm. Hard-core behaviorists clung to the 
idea that learned associations accounted for such actions. The so-called 
cognitive revolution in the mid 20th century freed human researchers from 
behaviorist dogma, and even made Tolman a hero, but animal behaviorists, at 
least initially, clung to non-cognitive, associative explanations. Eventually, 
rodent researchers, using reinforcer devaluation paradigms, showed that 
Tolman was correct. That even lowly rats are not simply stimulus-response 
habit machines but instead are also creatures that chose actions based on the 
value of expected outcomes. This does not mean that non-mammals lack 
cognition, but the evidence, at least at this point in time, suggests that they do 
not seem to have cognition in the way it is usually defined in mammals – in 
terms of internal representations and mental models.
A major development in human cognitive psychology was Alan 
Baddeley’s transformation of short-term memory into working memory. 
That is, a cognitive workspace with executive control over behavior. This 
gave psychology an anchoring point for cognition. Working memory has 
ever since been viewed as ground zero for cognitive models. Even goal- 
directed behavior in rats came to be thought of as being dependent on their 
more limited version of working memory.
The classic view was that working memory was a product of the lateral 
prefrontal cortex (PFC). It receives and integrates inputs from sensory and 
memory cortex and holds the information in temporary storage while 
deciding how to respond to it. A more recent view is that working memory 
involves a collation between PFC, sensory and memory areas that collec­
tively hold information temporarily while the executive memory, which 
includes PFC and parietal networks make decisions.
8
J. LEDOUX

While all mammals have some working memory capacity, the cognitive 
abilities of primates outstrip those of lower mammals, and those of humans 
outstrip those of other primates, including apes. This parallels the expansion 
of the PFC that took place in primates. Lower (i.e., non-primate) mammals 
mainly have medial, agranular PFC areas, while primates added granular 
areas located mostly on the lateral surface of PFC. And in humans the lateral 
granular areas expanded. There is, in fact, a lateral granular region in 
humans that other primates lack. It is a region of the frontal pole, the 
anterior most part of the brain. The reason that this structural feature 
(granulation) is important is that working memory and hierarchical rela­
tional reasoning crucially depend on granular PFC.
While areas are important, they do nothing on their own. Function comes 
from connectivity. An important feature of the granular PFC in primates is 
its wide range of inputs from posterior cortical areas that process sensory 
and memory information. This allows the granular PFC to integrate diverse 
kinds of information in the formation of complex abstract conceptions. In 
humans, this connectivity of granular PFC is even more robust. 
Additionally, all these connections also converge in the frontal pole, which 
is reciprocally connected with lateral PFC, giving the frontal pole unpar­
alleled capacity for conceptualization and reasoning.
Consciousness
I first became interested in consciousness through work I did in the mid 
1970s with my PhD advisor, Michael Gazzaniga. From our studies of human 
patients, we concluded that conscious experiences are the result of cognitive 
interpretation situations in an effort to help maintain a sense of mental unity 
in the face of the neural diversity of non-conscious behavioral control 
systems in our brain. In so doing, we drew heavily from attribution and 
appraisal models in social psychology at the time, in particular Leon 
Festinger’s theory of cognitive dissonance, Stanley Schachter and Jerome 
Singer’s attribution theory of emotion, and Richard Nisbett and Timothy 
Wilsons’ work on “telling more than we can know”.
Contemporary discussions of consciousness often treat it as a single kind 
of thing. But it is not. It is important to distinguish, at the very least, 
“creature consciousness” and “mental state consciousness.” Creature con­
sciousness refers to the condition of being awake and behaviorally respon­
sive to environmental stimuli and applies to the vast majority of animals. 
Mental state consciousness, on the other hand, is the condition of having 
experience with actual content about the world and/or oneself.
Theories of mental state consciousness come in two broad forms. One, 
called first-order theory, assumes that the sensory systems that process 
external events are all that is needed to have mental state experiences 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
9

about those events. Higher-order theories, on the other hand, argue that 
local sensory processing is not sufficient – that the information needs to be 
further processed – to be re-represented. I am a proponent of high-order 
theory and focused on it in Deep History.
In the brain, the hypothetical higher-order network involves regions of 
granular PFC, including dorsal and ventral lateral PFC, and the lateral and 
medial frontal pole. For example, the conscious experience of an apple, in 
this theory, reflects lateral PFC re-representation (in a sense conceptualiza­
tion) of lower-order visual cortex states.
Theories of consciousness, including most higher-order theories, seldom 
consider the role of memory in consciousness. But without semantic memory, 
and especially memory-based schema, the sensory representation of an apple 
is not meaningful (is not conceptualized) as an instance of the fruit of that 
name. Conceptualization occurs in perception independently of whether the 
perception becomes conscious. \. But David Rosenthal’s higher-order thought 
gives conceptualization a key role since thoughts are conceptual in nature.
My multistate hierarchical representation model, which is a variant of 
Rosenthal’s theory, makes memory and conceptualization an essential under­
pinning of higher-order consciousness. This model is based on the connectivity 
of sensory and memory circuits with PFC. One set of connections is with 
granular PFC areas, such as the dorsal and ventral lateral PFC. Another set of 
connections is with agranular medial PFC areas (orbital, ventral medial, medial, 
anterior cingulate and insula cortex). By way of various intra-PFC connections, 
granular and agranular PFC areas interact and, in my scheme, constitute 
a higher-order consciousness network that is crucially conceptual in nature.
So far, I have discussed mental state consciousness as if it were a single 
thing. But I believe that a partition suggested by Endel Tulving can greatly 
facilitate progress. Tulving distinguished between three forms of mental 
state consciousness in humans. These are autonoetic (explicit self-awareness 
of one’s existence over time), noetic (explicit awareness of facts and con­
cepts about the world or one’s self), and anoetic (implicit awareness of the 
world). The first two are based on episodic and semantic explicit memory 
and the third is based on implicit procedural learning. The fact that these are 
each based on a kind of memory that has been extensively studied offers 
important neural anchors for pursuing kinds of consciousness in the brain.
In Deep History, I mainly emphasized autonoetic and noetic. But in more 
recent writings, as discussed later, I have come to understand the crucial role 
of anoetic consciousness.
Emotional Consciousness
If the amygdala defensive survival circuit is not the way the conscious 
feeling of fear comes about, what is? My view is that it comes about much 
10
J. LEDOUX

like any other conscious mental state, as a higher-order interpretation of 
lower-order information.
It is sometimes said that emotions such as fear are universal. But I argue 
that it is danger, not fear, that is universal. I define fear as a personal, 
schema-based, narrative-driven, culturally shaped, subjective experience 
that occurs in a biologically or psychologically significant situation. 
Schemas are collections of memories about specific kinds of situations 
that underlie our thoughts, feelings, and actions in life.
The key idea is that conscious experience, whether emotional or not, is 
always preceded by non-conscious (pre-conscious) cognitive processing of 
sensations and memories, including schema, that results in a mental model 
of the situation. In an emotional situation, such as fear, brain and body 
consequences of threat-elicited survival circuit activation become part of the 
model. The brain becomes aroused in a general way that supports energy 
mobilization but also in specific ways tailored to the situation.
In Deep History, I argued that human emotions could not exist in the 
form we experience them without our early human ancestors having 
evolved language, hierarchical relational reasoning, noetic consciousness, 
and reflective autonoetic consciousness. Our emotions thereby became the 
mental center of gravity of the human brain, fodder for narratives and 
folktales, and the basis of culture, religion, art, literature and relations 
with others and our world – of all that matters in life as we know it.
The picture of emotion and consciousness I painted was extremely human 
centered. Human autonoetic consciousness depends on un-paralleled cogni­
tive processes that are entwined with language and culture, and is enabled by 
circuits with unique properties. The evolutionary past of autonoetic con­
sciousness, in particular, is quite shallow. Yet it did not arise in a void. 
Fundamental cognitive underpinnings of autonoetic consciousness, such as 
episodic-like memory and working memory, were present in our primate 
ancestors. But what seems to be missing is the ability of even our closest ape 
relatives to be robustly self-aware and to engage in mental time travel. But 
even if methodical impediments to measuring these could be overcome, their 
version of autonoetic consciousness would likely pale in complexity to what 
humans experience. The most obvious difference would be how language 
allows us to parse our subjective experiences, but I suspect even without 
language, human cognition would make human consciousness different.
Like all other species, we are special because we are different. Our 
differences are important to us because they are ours. They give us capacities 
that other animals don’t have. But other animals have capacities we lack. As 
I discuss, our differences do not make us superior or better adapted. They 
just make us different. Our differences are mere footnotes in a four-billion- 
year-old saga. Only by knowing the whole story can we truly understand 
who we are, and how we came to be that way.

Epilogue: Surviving Ourselves
Autonoetic consciousness is the basis of the conceptions that underlie our 
greatest achievements as a species – art, music, architecture, literature, 
science – and our ability to appreciate them. But consciousness, especially 
autonoesis, has a dark side – it is the enabler of selfishness and greed, mental 
features that could be our undoing. The Earth has persisted despite geophy­
sical disasters and mass extinctions, and will likely continue to persist as 
a planet in the solar system. But if we don’t make corrections soon, it may 
not persist in a way that will support the current configuration of organisms 
living on Earth, including, and especially, us.
Autonoetic consciousness is about one’s self. It is, by definition, personal, 
and thus selfish, and sometimes narcissistic. And, it may well be our evolu­
tionary Achilles’ Heel. We persist as individuals only if we persist as 
a species. We don’t have time for biological evolution to come to the rescue – 
it’s too slow. We have to depend on the more rapid avenues of change – 
cognitive and cultural evolution, which, in turn, depend on our autonoetic 
brains. Whether we perish or persist is in our hands, and thus in our 
autonoetic minds.
