A sample graph

Define the nodes
graph{
    A B C D E F
    
    

List those who are connected to A
graph{
    A B C D E F
    
    A -- B
    A -- C
    A -- D
    A -- E

List those who are connected to B
graph{
    A B C D E F
    
    A -- B
    A -- C
    A -- D
    A -- E
    
    B -- D
    B -- E

...and so on
graph{
    A B C D E F
    
    A -- B
    A -- C
    A -- D
    A -- E
    
    B -- D
    B -- E
    
    C -- F
    D -- F
    E -- F
}
