INTRODUCTION: ARTIFACTS OF PREDICTION
In the year 1900, a group of Greek sponge 
divers pulled an enigmatic artifact from the 
Aegean Sea: a lump of wood and metal that 
would only many decades later be identified 
as the world’s first-known analogue computer 
(Freeth et al. 2006). The device, approximately 
2,000 years old and called the Antikythera 
mechanism, is of astonishing technological 
complexity (Marchant 2006). Analyses of the 
object in recent decades have revealed that it 
functioned as a predictive machine, used to rep­
resent the future of the heavens: the ­movement 
of the planets, position of the sun, and the 
phases of the moon. Once predicted, this celes­
tial information was enlisted in the service of 
preparation, probably for timing agricultural 
and religious activities. Modern computer 
simulations suggest the device would have suc­
cessfully predicted even recent eclipses, includ­
ing the one whose shadow crossed the United 
States on August 21, 2017 (Wolfram 2017). 
The Antikythera mechanism tells us that for 
thousands of years humans have invested 
enormous effort in an attempt to predict and 
prepare, and, by extension, to engage in prospec­
tion—cognition that represents the future. 
Ancient material evidence suggests that 
the history of human future thinking has a 
far more extensive lineage still. Consider a 
recently reported set of ground-edged hatchets 
from northern Australia (Clarkson et al. 2017). 
At approximately 65,000 years old, they are 
the world’s oldest-known. The tools were long-
lived, and creating their highly polished edges 
required extensive abrasion with other rocks 
(Dickson 1980). They were also ­continually 
Abstract
In psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and philosophy, “prediction” is widely 
recognized as central to cognition. Mental time travel into the future is the form of cogni­
tive prediction (“prospection”) most intimately connected to adaptive human functioning. 
It underpins explicit goal-setting, collaborative planning, and the pursuit of creative inno­
vation. Theories focusing on prediction have a long intellectual history. Broadly construed, 
they offer perhaps the best opportunity yet for a global picture of neural and cognitive 
functioning. Exploiting this opportunity requires building bridges between prediction—as 
instantiated in perception or reinforcement learning—and full-fledged mental time travel 
into the future. The surge of recent work on these topics indicates consensus about the 
promise of prospection for understanding diverse aspects of cognition, but subfields still 
lack theoretical synthesis.

maintained, reshaped, and reworked, with 
worn or damaged edges repaired so they could 
be used again when needed in the future 
(Hiscock et al. 2016). Further back into pre­
history, perhaps some of the earliest evidence 
for prospective cognition in any Homo species 
comes in the form of bifacial hand axes (Hallos 
2005), the oldest of which may be more than 
1.76 million years old (Lepre et al. 2011). 
The complex production process of bifaces 
required more advanced planning than earlier 
tools (Wynn and Coolidge 2016). Moreover, 
they appear often to have been built in one 
location and then transported elsewhere for 
repeated use (Ambrose 2010). 
An ancient stone tool like the biface might 
seem to have little in common with the 
Antikythera mechanism, other than that both 
are the functional end products of human inge­
nuity and the spread of ideas. But both objects 
can also be thought of as extensions of a mind 
fundamentally geared towards the future. Only 
with behaviors enacted in the present moment 
(including the creation of powerful tools) 
can future successes be ensured and disasters 
averted, the crops kept alive, and the predators 
warded off. The same logic applies to a great 
many of the artifacts of humanity fashioned 
over the eons to predict, prepare for, and con­
front possible futures: walls to stop potential 
invaders, writing to remember the debtor, seed 
banks in case our planet begins to expire. These 
artifacts reflect a more general underlying fact: 
many of the mechanisms of human cognition 
are fundamentally future-oriented. The rise 
and growth of this prospective cognition has 
been a critical driver of our evolutionary suc­
cess (Suddendorf and Corballis 2007). On this 
point, at least, most modern thinking about the 
science of human prospection converges. 
The two books under review here repeat­
edly propound the centrality of prospection to ­
adaptive human functioning. Together, the 
books represent a cross section of much of the 
relevant contemporary work, and readers will 
find much creative and fascinating research 
and theory in both. They are good companion 
pieces, together providing an exciting primer to 
the topic and a helpful resource on the array of 
emerging subfields. After surveying the history 
of research on prospection, I shall review these 
major subfields and discuss the major questions 
raised in the books: How do the mechanisms 
of “low-level” prediction relate to mental time 
travel (MTT)? What are the ultimate evolution­
ary origins of prospection? What are the applica­
tions to questions about metacognition, the self, 
free will, and consciousness? How does prospec­
tion as a capacity bear on creativity, innovation, 
and cultural change? Is it fair to conceptualize 
prospection as a paradigm shift in our approach 
to the cognitive sciences (Kuhn 1962)? 
THE CENTRALITY OF PROSPECTION: 
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The contributors to Homo Prospectus herald 
the science of prospection as a revelatory new 
approach for psychology. Seligman and col­
leagues tell us that psychologists, who have 
been long attached to the notion that the past 
and present determine human actions—as seen 
in behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and “most of 
cognitive psychology” (10)—have ignored the 
draw of the future. The authors assert that their 
reconception, which places the future center 
stage, is so radical in its implications that it 
calls for renaming our species “Homo prospec­
tus.” The authors ask us to “take this name 
seriously” and underscore their request by 
making it the title of their book (10). I agree 
that the subject should be taken seriously, but 
the name would probably best be regarded as 
a rhetorical device. After all, “Homo prospec­
tus” joins a long list of other proposed names 
for our species, from “Homo grammaticus” to 
“Homo technologicus” (https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Names_for_the_human_species), all 
of which have gone unadopted since Linnaeus 
called us Homo sapiens (1758). These names

typically emphasize some particular aspect of 
human cognition or behavior that the author 
considers most imperative. “Prospection” has 
great promise as a research program but also 
risks becoming a buzzword. 
In being “drawn into the future” Seligman 
and colleagues—with an unintentional but 
appropriate irony—gloss over the intellec­
tual history that scaffolds the contemporary 
science (Fukukura, Helzer, and Ferguson 
2013). Prospection has been seriously discussed 
by thinkers ranging from the ancient Roman 
philosopher Seneca (65 AD) to the modern 
German philosopher Schopenhauer (1918). 
The seventeenth-century political philosopher 
Thomas Hobbes declared that “the opinions 
men have of the rewards and punishments 
which are to follow their actions are the causes 
that make and govern the will to those actions” 
(1640, 103). 
In the opening pages of their introduction, 
Railton suggests an amendment to a famous 
statement by William James: “My thinking 
is first, and last, and always for my doing.” 
To which Railton would add, “and all of my 
doing extends forward in time, not backward.” 
However, a more complete reading of James 
reveals his already extensive emphasis on the 
future. In Principles of Psychology I (1890), for 
instance, he argues that the fundamental func­
tion of the cerebral hemispheres of an animal is 
to simulate “remote objects” and “distant ends” 
that are not currently available to its senses. 
“[In] the cerebrum itself the same general dis­
tinction obtains, between considerations of 
the more immediate and considerations of the 
more remote. In all ages the man whose deter­
minations are swayed by reference to the most 
distant ends has been held to possess the highest 
intelligence” (1980, 20). 
In Principles of Psychology II, in a chap­
ter dedicated to “the will,” James deals at 
length with deliberation, anticipation, and 
voluntary action. Thus, as is often the case in 
­psychology, James preempted or founded much 
of our current discussion, and it would be dif­
ficult to identify any significant hiatus in the 
interim. Other notable early thinkers on the 
topic include Helmholtz, Bergson, Kohler, 
Tolman, and Craik. Aside from his well-known 
work on “cognitive maps” and latent learning 
(Tolman 1948), Tolman wrote at length, earlier, 
about “purpose” as it related to psychological 
processing. He defined human “thought” as “an 
internal presentation to the organism (on the 
basis of memory and association) of stimuli not 
actually present but which would be present, if 
some hypothesized action were carried out” (my 
emphasis) (Tolman 1920, 230). In his remark­
ably prescient “The Nature of Explanation” 
(1943), English philosopher Kenneth Craik 
paralleled this idea, introducing the concept of 
“mental models” and discussing their potential 
function as tools for organizing behavior in the 
face of upcoming dangers and opportunities. 
In the United States, the concept of “mental 
models” arose at around the same time as 
“cybernetics,” a field that bought together 
control systems theory, information theory, 
neuroscience, anthropology, and psychology to 
study control and communication in the animal 
and the machine—the subtitle of a seminal 
book by Norbert Wiener (1948). Cyberneticists 
examined systems that act as if they have 
goals. (The word “cybernetic” is derived from 
the Greek κυβερνάω [kubernáō], meaning 
“steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder.”) In 
the 1940s and 1950s, cyberneticists placed a 
strong emphasis on prediction and feedback 
in the context of adaptive functioning. Those 
concepts eventually found a home in artificial 
intelligence research (Wiener 1948). A highly 
fruitful bidirectional relationship between the 
cognitive sciences and artificial intelligence 
followed, with search problems, planning, and 
goal-direction being productive areas of joint 
interest (reviewed in Russel and Norvig 2009). 
Plans and the Structure of Behaviour, 
­published in 1960 by George Miller and col­
leagues, applied cybernetics to psychology and

became a founding text of the cognitive revo­
lution (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram 1960). 
Miller et al. argued that complex stepwise 
planning might emerge through the operation 
and manipulation of internal mental models. 
Arguably, then, one of the hallmarks of the cog­
nitive revolution in psychology was the intro­
duction of “prospection” as expressed in the 
goal-directed control of behavior. Around the 
same time, social psychologist Walter Mischel 
had begun to investigate the capacity of young 
children to postpone their immediate gratifi­
cation in pursuit of delayed rewards (Mischel 
1961), though one should note that the con­
cept of delayed gratification has parallel roots in 
sociology and economics (Strotz 1955; Straus 
1962). In the 1970s, the study of “intertempo­
ral choices”—of which Mischel’s iconic marsh­
mallow test can be considered one variant—was 
extended to pigeons (Ainslie 1974), and later to 
many other nonhuman animals (for reviews, see 
Stevens 2010; Redshaw and Bulley 2018). 
Prospection, forecasting and goal-directed­
ness were central to much of Kahneman and 
Tversky’s Nobel Prize–winning research during 
the 1970s (e.g., Kahneman and Tversky 1977). 
At the same time, developmental psychologists 
were using linguistic analyses of young chil­
dren’s vocabulary to track “past” and “future” 
understanding (Harner 1975), and cognitive 
psychologists were beginning to study the mech­
anisms of prospective memory and delayed 
intention-setting (Meacham and Singer 1977). 
Learning theory was also being placed on a 
solid foundation of “expectation” (Rescorla 
and Wagner 1972), and neuroscientists had 
started to consider the role of the frontal lobes 
in executive functions and planning (Nauta 
1971). Endel Tulving’s framework for memory 
(1972) was particularly foundational at this 
time, and would soon be extended to ­encompass 
“future thinking” (Tulving 1985). In the 1980s 
and 1990s, philosophers offered detailed 
treatments of “intention” and “planning” 
(e.g., Bratman 1987). Meanwhile, economists 
continued to investigate the way prospective 
emotions guide decision-making (Frank 1988), 
and clinical psychologists investigated their 
influence on affective disorders (Beck, Emery, 
and Greenberg 1985; MacLeod et al. 1997). 
Studies of patients with frontal lobe damage 
came to corroborate hypotheses about how the 
frontal lobe functions in adaptive goal-directed 
cognition (Ingvar 1985; Damasio 1994). 
In 1997, Suddendorf and Corballis pre­
sented their seminal treatment of MTT, 
describing in detail its possible subcompo­
nent processes. They also fleshed out the link 
between memory and foresight systems and 
discussed the evolutionary origins of MTT. 
Working in parallel, other scientists were inves­
tigating “low-level” sensory and behavioral 
neuroscience and artificial intelligence, devel­
oping arguments supporting the brain-basis of 
learning by prediction error. Those arguments 
led to theoretical models that identified pre­
diction as a key aspect of sensory processing 
and deep learning (e.g., Dayan et al. 1995). 
Models like these, grounded in artificial intel­
ligence research, found substantive empirical 
support in emerging neuroscientific investiga­
tions, including those delineating a key role for 
dopamine in reward prediction (Berridge and 
Robinson 1998; Schultz, Dayan, and Montague 
1997). By the 2000s, the invention of neuro­
imaging led to a series of studies that served to 
corroborate the notion that memory and 
prospection should be thought of as two sides 
of the same coin (e.g., Okuda et al. 2003).
Since the turn of the millennium, a thriving 
research industry has emerged on the back of 
this rich history, much of which I cover in more 
detail below. Some major reviews have recently 
been published (Szpunar and Radvansky 2015; 
Schacter, Benoit, and Szpunar 2017), as have a 
number of books and edited volumes, ­including 
the two under direct consideration here (Bar 
2011; Hohwy, 2013; Suddendorf 2013b; 
Clark 2015; Michaelian 2016b; Macleod 2017; 
Oettingen, Sevincer, and Gollwitzer 2018).

This brief historical sketch should suffice to 
indicate that the significance of prospection 
has long been recognized. Accordingly, claims 
that the current surge of research amounts to a 
radical paradigm shift in psychology need to be 
taken with a grain of salt. Even so, it is undoubt­
edly true that we are witnessing a rapid growth 
in cross-­disciplinary work on such questions. 
The two books under review here are testament 
to that growth. 
Prospection is a term sometimes reserved 
for “higher-order” cognition with a predic­
tive component involving “thinking about the 
future” via explicit planning, foresight and 
­imagination. These topics will be the focus of 
this review. However, the broader definition 
that includes all “predictive” processing in the 
brain and cognition touches a vast array of 
topics in the cognitive sciences. Some authors 
have suggested that there is a harmony at play 
here: that “prospection,” broadly construed, 
might offer us an organizing principle for 
the brain and behavioral sciences (e.g., Clark 
2015). The multiple fields of inquiry reviewed 
in the preceding historical sketch constitute dif­
ferent “levels” of analysis. Building conceptual 
linkages among those levels remains a major 
challenge. 
TRAVERSING THE LEVELS: FROM PREDICTION-
ERRORS TO MTT
“Low-Level” Prediction
In the opening chapters of Homo Prospectus, 
before they scale upwards, Railton (2016) and 
Sripada (2016) make a compelling and neuro­
biologically informed case for the operation and 
mechanisms of low-level prospection. Their 
account dovetails with a recent surge of interest 
related to “predictive processing” (Clark 2013, 
2015; Pezzulo 2016). Predictive processing and 
Bayesian approaches to brain function concep­
tualize neural processing as an ongoing com­
parison between new sensory input and existing 
internal probabilistic models of the causes of 
those sensory signals. In vision, for example, the 
brain is thought to strive toward a ­minimization 
of the prediction error that occurs as the eyes 
gather information from the outside world and 
is compared that information with existing 
mental models. The interacting component 
parts of the visual system use this prediction 
error to update internal probabilistic models 
and thereby create increasingly useful cogni­
tive representations (Dayan et al. 1995; Friston 
2009; Pezzulo, Rigoli, and Friston 2015). In 
STF, Pezzulo (2016) surveys the relevant find­
ings and current theoretical positions (see also 
Bubić, von Cramon, and Schubotz 2010). In 
the predictive processing account, the conflu­
ence of top-down predictions with bottom-up 
sensory input operates at the neural core of per­
ception and action. 
“High-Level” Prediction
Episodic foresight is the capacity to simulate 
future events, embed them in larger narratives, 
and then adjust present decision-making and 
behavior accordingly (Suddendorf and Moore 
2011). Episodic foresight is not a unitary 
cognitive module; it requires a suite of inter­
acting component capacities and operations. 
Neuroimaging while participants simulate the 
future has revealed a wealth of details about 
the possible neural mechanisms of episodic 
foresight. Generally, imagining the future is 
associated with activation in the “default mode 
­network,” so named because it is the activ­
ity also observed during task-­unrelated rest. 
The involved brain regions include the medial 
temporal lobes, midline prefrontal cortex, 
and cingulate cortex (Raichle et al. 2001; 
Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, and Schacter 2008; 
Smallwood et al. 2013; Bubić and Abraham 
2014). Such findings suggest that people may 
often resort to imagining future possibilities 
when external task demands are low (Burgess, 
Dumontheil, and Gilbert 2007; Spreng and 
Grady 2010; Corballis 2013a; Smallwood and 
Schooler 2015).

Building Bridges
How much commonality is there between the 
“prediction” taking place at different levels of 
analysis in the cognitive sciences? Clark (2015) 
makes a rallying call for the utility of the predic­
tive processing account:
Predictive processing offers an attractive 
“cognitive package deal” in which percep­
tion, understanding, dreaming, memory, and 
imagination all emerge as variant expressions 
of the same underlying mechanistic ploy—the 
ploy that meets incoming sensory data with 
matching top-down prediction. At the heart 
of the package lies the ability to use down­
wards connections to self-generate perception-
like states. The very same “perceptual” 
machinery, driven from the top-down but 
insulated from entrainment by the driving 
sensory signal, then accounts for imagery and 
dreaming, and may pave the way for “mental 
time travel” as we assemble cues and contexts 
able to reconstruct the past and preconstruct 
the future. (107) 
This is a notion that receives support else­
where (Pezzulo 2008). In an informative and 
wide-ranging chapter of STF, Pezzulo (2016) 
expresses his broad interpretation of the prom­
ise of predictive processing. Pezzulo’s chapter 
includes an important discussion of findings 
of rodent hippocampus place cell activity 
that “replays” and “pre-plays” physical move­
ment even when the animal is not moving. 
Interpreting these findings has proven con­
tentious (Gupta et al. 2010; Corballis 2013b; 
Suddendorf 2013a; see also Pezzulo, Kemere, 
and Van Der Meer 2017). As Clark (2015) and 
Pezzulo (2016) acknowledge, achieving a global 
synthesis of prediction in the brain presents 
several problems. One is that “future-oriented” 
processing is highly multidimensional at every 
scale, especially the most “higher-order.” Note, 
however, that there have been recent attempts 
to address even “high-level” concepts like “opti­
mistic beliefs” (Sharot and Garrett 2016), and 
explicit “intertemporal choice” at the “low-
level” of reinforcement learning (Lefebvre et 
al. 2017; Solway, Lohrenz, and Montague 
2017). This problem extends to using different 
­terminology for (perhaps?) the same things—
such as the myriad names for episodic foresight/
episodic future thinking/future-oriented MTT/
future simulations, and so forth. Another prob­
lem is that theoretical and mathematical models 
of neural and cognitive mechanisms will only 
get us so far; we need to have an understanding 
that is not only neurobiologically plausible but 
also anchored in specific neural activity while 
simultaneously linking that activity to specific 
behavior. And a third problem: we should have 
a sense of how these mechanisms evolved, and 
on account of which selective pressures—noto­
riously difficult questions for complex cognitive 
processes (Tinbergen 1963). Given problems of 
this magnitude, one can understand the caution 
expressed in the final lines of the introduction 
to STF: “While parsimony is a laudable goal in 
theory construction, it may nevertheless turn 
out to be the case that the search for a common 
mechanism underlying the various forms of 
FMTT is futile” (14). 
The Relationship between Memory and 
Prospection
Several authors have converged on the idea that 
memory is in essence forward-facing. This idea 
builds on early ideas of James (1890) about the 
source of “remote” sensations and also on con­
cepts from cybernetics—for example, that in 
thinking systems “the prediction of the future 
of a message is done by some sort of operator 
on its past” (Wiener 1948). Memory, in this 
view, is a system that empowers an organism 
to imagine, predict, or prepare for the future 
(Suddendorf and Corballis 1997; Suddendorf 
2010; Szpunar and Tulving 2011; Klein 2013; 
Suddendorf and Henry 2013). Information 
accrued and stored through lived experience 
forms the building blocks for prospection. 
The ability to generate novel expectations about 

The History and Future of Human Prospection

future events, especially in the form of narra­
tives, relies in part on the recursive nesting of 
that information (Suddendorf and Corballis 
1997; Schacter, Addis, and Buckner 2007; 
Hassabis and Maguire 2009). 
MTT and semantic knowledge are deeply 
intertwined (Szpunar 2010; Irish 2016). As a 
“time-invariant repository of conceptual knowl­
edge” semantic information provides a crucial 
“ingredient” in the construction of mental sce­
narios and may also guide the construction of 
diverse forms of future-oriented cognition (Irish, 
Piguet, and Hodges 2012; Irish et al. 2016). 
Indeed, researchers have suggested that semantic 
memory underpins episodic processing in both 
memory and prospection (Tulving 1985; Binder 
and Desai 2011; Irish and Piguet 2013) and that 
semantic knowledge is integrated into imag­
ined possibilities during the “scenario building” 
process (Cheng et al., 2016). Szpunar, Spreng, 
and Schacter (2016) suggest that episodic and 
semantic formats of cognition are best thought 
of as lying on a gradient along which different 
“formats” of future thinking are expressed. One 
should recognize that there are also import­
ant differences between episodic foresight and 
episodic memory (Suddendorf 2010). For 
instance, they may differ in their reliance on 
“recombination” (Weiler et al. 2011) and also 
in brain activity (Bubić and Abraham 2014; 
Schacter, Benoit, and Szpunar 2017). See 
also the ongoing debates in philosophy about 
“continuism” versus “discontinuism” as reviewed 
in STF (Michaelian 2016a; Perrin 2016). 
THE UTILITY OF PROSPECTION (AND ITS 
EMERGENCE) 
In seeking a comprehensive account of prospec­
tion, one may usefully invoke Tinbergen’s four 
questions: about mechanisms, development, 
phylogeny, and function (Tinbergen 1963; 
Scott-Phillips, Dickins, and West 2011). Several 
contributors to STF have made good headway 
on these questions. The development of pro­
spective capacities has been discussed at length 
(Gopnik et al. 2004; Suddendorf and Redshaw 
2013; Martin-Ordas, Atance, and Caza 2014; 
Atance and Mahy 2016; Suddendorf 2017). 
An emerging consensus affirms that the capac­
ities come on line piecemeal, with most avail­
able in rudimentary form by around age four. 
Comparing research on children’s episodic 
future thinking to the research conducted 
with healthy adults, Atance and Mahy (2016) 
argue that many assumptions we make about 
how adults imagine the future do not neces­
sarily apply to nonverbal children. We cannot 
assume, for instance, that nonverbal children 
even imagine the future at all.
Many of the difficulties presented by study­
ing prospection in nonverbal infants appear 
also in studying prospection in nonhuman 
animals. Comparative psychologists have had 
a long preoccupation with MTT, and “human 
uniqueness” has remained a major point of 
contention since MTT was originally articu­
lated (Suddendorf and Corballis 1997; Tulving 
2002). Emerging evidence suggests that ani­
mals are capable of considerably more sophis­
ticated future-oriented behavior than was once 
thought possible (Osvath and Martin-Ordas 
2014; Martin-Ordas 2016; Thom and Clayton 
2016; Redshaw and Bulley 2018). Explanations 
for these behaviors remain controversial, but 
in some cases the most parsimonious expla­
nations attribute mental representations of 
an anticipated future to non-human animals. 
(But see Thom and Clayton in STF for an 
insightful critique of the principle of parsimony 
and “Morgan’s Canon.”)
Taking account of the way prospection 
enters into decision-making, most researchers 
agree that it has adaptive functionality (Gilbert 
and Wilson 2007). Its adaptive functionality 
is especially clear in its relationship with emo­
tion. The emotional significance of a particular 
stimulus or event is an indicator of its biolog­
ical value. Consequently, emotional reactions 
can serve as a common appraisal metric for 
environmental occurrences (Panksepp 1998). 
Value, in this biological sense, relates directly 

Adam Bulley

to survival and reproduction. Episodic foresight 
enables the ascription of such value signals to 
imagined future events as well as to events that 
are directly perceived (Suddendorf and Busby 
2005; Damasio 2009; Lin et al. 2015). People 
can thereby “evaluate” a future possibility long 
in advance by the way it makes them feel when 
they imagine it—a process known as “affective 
forecasting” (Wilson and Gilbert 2005). 
Anticipated emotional reactions are com­
monly evoked in decision-making, but the 
role of foresight may be especially important 
in decisions with outcomes that play out only 
over time. Such decisions include intertempo­
ral choices in which present and future conse­
quences are in conflict (Peters and Büchel 2010; 
Benoit, Gilbert, and Burgess 2011; Bulley, 
Henry, and Suddendorf 2016; Jenkins and 
Hsu 2017). Boyer (2008) suggests that imag­
ining future benefits may act as a motivational 
“brake” on the kind of impulsive decision-mak­
ing that sacrifices long-term and cooperative 
effort to individual and immediate gratifica­
tion. The brake works by providing some of the 
motivational salience of a future reward before 
it arises (Pezzulo and Rigoli 2011; Kurth-
Nelson, Bickel, and Redish 2012; Hoerl and 
McCormack 2016; Viganò 2017). In line with 
this perspective, researchers increasingly see 
impaired foresight as a risk factor for addiction 
and a barrier to recovery (Bickel et al. 2017; 
Noël, Jaafari, and Bechara 2017; Terrett et al. 
2017). (For an interesting discussion about the 
relative role of the semantic and episodic sys­
tems in modifying intertemporal choices, see 
Hoerl and McCormack in STF [2016], Kwan et 
al. [2015], and Palombo, Keane, and Verfaellie 
[2016]. The latter two sources also discuss the 
role of the medial temporal lobes among partic­
ipants with amnesia.) 
Evidence suggests that foresight is closely 
associated with the organization of personal 
goals and might thus be a particularly power­
ful tool in decision-making (e.g., Lehner and 
D’Argembeau 2016). Pursuit of these personal 
goals often involves “shaping one’s future 
self” through deliberate practice (Suddendorf, 
Brinums, and Imuta 2016). In STF, Suddendorf 
et al. argue that people can deliberately pursue 
specialization only by identifying a future skill 
set (and the path towards its acquirement), 
and that this deliberate pursuit goes some 
way toward explaining the powerful diver­
sity of expertise that characterizes humanity. 
Metacognition underpins such adaptive fore­
sight in humans: one can only overcome one’s 
cognitive limits by recognizing those limits—
recognizing, for instance that one lacks a certain 
skill, or that one’s predictions could be wrong 
(Redshaw 2014; Redshaw and Bulley 2018).
Impairments and Costs
Life had overshot its target and blown 
itself apart. A species had been too heav­
ily armed — its genius made it not only all-
powerful in the external world, but equally 
dangerous to its own well-being. (Zapffe 1933)
Human MTT has been described as “costly” 
because it probably requires a big, densely 
wired brain, which is slow to develop and met­
abolically “expensive.” The empirical evidence 
about the “metabolic” costs of prospection is 
wanting, but these arguments can be regarded 
as extensions of the common idea that more 
“flexible” cognitive processes are harder to build 
than fixed action patterns of behavior designed 
to activate upon particular stimulus cues in 
the environment (see Dennett 1984). There 
is another potential cost to any highly com­
plicated mechanism with many moving parts: 
it can break down in various ways. Research is 
now accumulating on changes in prospection 
in clinical subgroups, including patients suffer­
ing from dementia, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, 
schizophrenia, and normal aging (see Henry 
et al. 2016 for a special issue on the topic). 
It is difficult to ascertain precisely which sit­
uations are best viewed as “malfunctions”

of the mechanisms, and which are better 
­conceived of as either (1) by-products of other 
­interacting capacities or (2) extreme manifesta­
tions of normal individual-difference variance 
(Nesse and Williams 1994; Zietsch, de Candia, 
and Keller 2015) 
Evolutionary costs and benefits to an organ­
ism are not the same as the costs and benefits 
to its subjective well-being. Peter Zapffe (1933) 
observes that the “genius” of human beings is 
a source also of great suffering. This may be 
true about the “genius” of prospection, which 
provides us not only with extraordinary powers 
of control, but also gives us the best seats in 
the house to mentally access futures we would 
perhaps rather not foresee: those that include 
ruin, suffering, and the death of loved ones 
or of ourselves. Varki (2009) suggests that for 
mechanisms allowing this mental access to have 
evolved at all, simultaneous systems for self-­
deception would have been required to offset 
the negative consequences such existential 
dread would engender for adaptive ­behavior 
(see also von Hippel and Trivers 2011).
Whether or not this is true, the suffering 
brought about by prospection is most obvious 
in the context of depression and anxiety, where 
negatively valenced future simulations are 
common. Of depression, Seligman and Roepke 
declare in STF that “dysfunctional prospec­
tion creates depression” (see also Roepke and 
Seligman, 2015), but this is perhaps a premature 
conclusion given the correlational nature of the 
­majority of the research (reviewed in Miloyan, 
Pachana, and Suddendorf 2014). A long-
running research program by MacLeod and 
colleagues has suggested a more complex rela­
tionship between prospection, well-being, and 
mental health (MacLeod et al. 1997; MacLeod 
2016). Being able to “auto-cue” future threat 
events and narratives without any ­immediate 
sensory threat cues is a powerful adaptive tool 
for managing potential ­dangers (Miloyan, 
Bulley, and Suddendorf 2018), but it is also 
a central feature of clinical anxiety (Miloyan, 
Pachana, and Suddendorf 2014; Bulley, Henry, 
and Suddendorf 2017). As with depression, it is 
still unclear what causal role negative prospec­
tion may play in anxiety. 
PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS 
The Self and the Future 
Cognitive scientists and philosophers have 
begun to address the difficult problem of 
how the current “self” relates to the future or 
possible “selves” into which it may transition 
(Markus and Nurius 1986; Hershfield et al. 
2011; Manning 2016). Empirical advances in 
the form of “thought-sampling” and studies 
of selfhood in amnesic patients have begun to 
trace out what a science of “the self” integrated 
with prospection would look like. In STF, 
D’Argembeau (2016) argues that much of our 
MTT is organized around “self-defining expe­
riences” in memory and “self-defining future 
projections” in foresight. Research on personal 
semantic memory (Renoult et al. 2012) and 
semantic conceptions of the self suggest that 
multiple interacting systems are at play in its 
construction (Klein and Gangi 2010; Conway, 
Loveday, and Cole 2016). 
Predictive processing accounts of the self 
are often tied up with notions of ­embodiment 
and action. “Active” and ­“interoceptive” infer­
ence paint a picture of reciprocal feedback 
between internal predictive models and stim­
uli in the environment or the body (e.g., from 
the viscera), respectively (Clark 2008). Because 
the organism continually engages the world 
via motor planning and behavior to select the 
stimuli that will connect with its sensors, it can 
perform actions that reduce prediction errors 
by bringing sensory states in line with expecta­
tions (Friston 2009; Pezzulo 2012; Seth 2014). 
Newly accrued evidence can thereby update the 
initial models and thus change future learning 
and action (Friston et al. 2017). This process of 
‘“active inference’” inexorably links the organ­
ism and the environment. Related “enactivist”

Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture
or “embodiment” perspectives raise interesting 
questions about where the boundaries of the 
self would best be drawn. Again, this idea traces 
its lineage to cybernetics: 
Consider a tree and a man and an axe. We 
observe that the axe flies through the air and 
makes certain sorts of gashes in a pre-existing 
cut in the side of the tree. If now we want to 
explain this set of phenomena, we shall be 
concerned with differences in the cut of the 
face of the tree, differences in the retina of the 
man, differences in his central nervous system, 
differences in his efferent neural messages, 
differences in the behaviour of his muscles, dif­
ferences in how the axe flies, to the differences 
which the axe then makes in the face of the 
tree. Our explanation (for certain purposes) 
will go round and round that circuit. In prin­
ciple, if you want to explain or understand 
anything in human behaviour, you are always 
dealing with total circuits, completed circuits. 
This is the elementary cybernetic thought. 
(Bateson 1972, 465)
Prospection and Free Will 
In STF, Seligman and colleagues underscore the 
importance of having an “option set” for free 
will. Recent experiments have shown it may be 
possible to increase the cognitive “option set” 
and change the perceived emotionality and 
plausibility of those options (Jing, Madore, 
and Schacter 2017). However, Seligman and 
colleagues disavow any intention of engaging 
the metaphysical debate about free will. The 
reader is then left to wonder why “free will” as 
a philosophical question enters the discussion 
at all. As the authors acknowledge, nothing 
about “prospection” necessarily hints at refram­
ing the free will debate in metaphysical terms. 
(Prospective cognition all takes place “in the 
present,” as a result of whatever processes in the 
universe happen to engender it.) Metaphysics 
aside, the prospection approach is clearly useful 
in the psychology of volition—for instance in 
understanding the psychological determinants 
of choices when options are pitted against 
one another and people must choose between 
them (Berns, Laibson, and Loewenstein 2007; 
Haggard 2008). 
The King of the Questions in the Cognitive 
Sciences
Questions about consciousness have long been 
central to the study of prospection. The famous 
distinction made by Endel Tulving between 
episodic and semantic forms of declarative 
memory placed a special kind of conscious 
awareness center stage. Episodic memory is 
defined by “autonoetic” (“self-knowing”) con­
sciousness that involves the first-person sub­
jective experience of previously lived events. 
Semantic memory represents “noetic” (know­
ing) consciousness that does not require any 
explicit mental simulation (see also Szpunar 
and Tulving 2011). The subjectivity of auton­
oesis has produced much hand-wringing, 
especially in preverbal developmental and 
comparative psychology, where self-report is 
impossible, but the scientific opacity of auton­
oesis has not stopped some interesting specula­
tions about the mechanistic underpinnings of 
conscious prospection. In STF, Sripada (2016) 
invokes conscious broadcasting to explain the 
way episodic memory states disseminate to 
neocortical “deep learning mechanisms,” which 
use them for foresight. This explanation is not 
wholly satisfying. There is no compelling reason 
memory states would need to be distributed via 
conscious means. Baumeister (2016a) suggests 
that the conscious experience of feelings might 
serve a role in affective “evaluations” that are 
useful in learning and prospection rather than 
in immediate action. This is an interesting idea, 
but it too is speculative. 
In STF, Martin-Ordas (2016) takes aim at 
the issue of consciousness in nonhuman ani­
mals. She argues that while we cannot nec­
essarily prove that nonhuman animals have 
subjective experiences, we cannot rule out the

85
possibility, either. Klein (2014) reminds us that 
we cannot define our way out of this ­problem: 
“If our available techniques are unable to 
capture this core feature of memory [and 
foresight], then so much worse for our tech­
niques” (23). For the time being, we seem to 
have reached an impasse on this question. In 
many projects on which scientists of prospec­
tion are engaged, putting consciousness to one 
side seems to be a useful strategy. Nonetheless, 
the scientific study of consciousness has seen a 
herculean surge of research effort over the last 
three decades (Crick and Koch 1990; Edelman 
1992; Chalmers 1995; Dehaene and Naccache 
2001; Tononi 2004; Koch and Tsuchiya 2007; 
Dennett 2017). It remains to be seen what 
potentially fruitful insights the science of 
prospection will provide.
PROSPECTION, INVENTION, CULTURE, AND 
CREATIVITY 
Metacognition allows for the invention of par­
ticular kinds of tools that allow us to “off-load 
cognition” into the environment, for instance by 
writing things down (Risko and Gilbert 2016). 
The writing paper (or computer) and its symbols 
can be considered as part of the extended cog­
nitive system—and in some respects as part of 
the organism’s “extended phenotype” (Dawkins 
1982; Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Clark 2008). 
The creativity that builds these inventions is 
fundamentally imaginative and prospective 
(Dong, Collier-Baker, and Suddendorf 2015; 
Abraham 2016). Any attempt to generate pos­
sible alternatives (e.g., novel “uses” for things) 
involves some flexible recombinatorial thought. 
Foresight also means humans can imagine the 
functionality and aesthetics of potential cre­
ations before any physical manufacture begins. 
Whether a solution to a problem is “figured out” 
or merely stumbled upon by accident, solu­
tions can be recognized as having future utility 
(von Hippel and Suddendorf, forthcoming). 
The new discovery can be spread through 
social networks, amended, changed, borrowed, 
sold, or stolen, all elements in the process of 
“cultural evolution.” 
Corballis and Suddendorf argue that lan­
guage may have evolved, at least in part, because 
it enables the sharing of mental time travels into 
the past and future (Corballis and Suddendorf 
2007). Consider the long-recognized connec­
tions between imagination, MTT, and sto­
rytelling (McBride 2012; Boyer and Parren 
2015; Abraham 2016; Mahr and Csibra 2018). 
With simulations of the future come insights 
about what it might hold. When pooled, those 
insights can be improved in accuracy or ­utility. 
Humans share, discuss, and create collaborative 
plans and socially construct concepts about the 
future, including ideas about what is worth 
striving for (Baumeister 2016b). When cou­
pled with a powerful desire to “connect our 
minds together,” the capacity for simulating 
the future becomes starkly more potent as an 
evolutionary weapon in the ­struggle for sur­
vival and reproduction (Suddendorf 2013b; 
von Hippel 2018). 
The implications of this perspective for 
cultural phenomena are intuitively suggestive. 
Think of the importance of prospection in legal, 
religious, and financial systems. Nonetheless, 
the precise role of episodic foresight in cultural 
evolution remains somewhat opaque (Mesoudi 
2007). Cognitive systems for the regulation of 
collaborative foresight, including those sub­
serving morality, may have piggybacked on 
language-enabled MTT. Recent studies have 
shown that imagining future prosocial actions 
can encourage more altruistic behavior (e.g., 
Gaesser and Schacter 2014): more evidence that 
foresight might reduce the temporal discount­
ing that would otherwise encourage the pursuit 
of “selfish” opportunities (see also Boyer 2008; 
O’Connell, Christakou, and Chakrabarti 2015; 
Hill et al. 2017). Furthermore, as underscored 
in STF, moral attitudes and judgments may 
also track prior transgressions and cooperation 
so that efficient predictions can be made about 
the likely future cooperativeness of conspecifics 
(Railton 2016).

Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture
CONCLUSION 
The science of prospection, broadly construed, 
may offer the best opportunity yet devised to 
find an overarching paradigmatic account of 
cognition. Over the past 100 years, intense 
research on the instantiation of prediction, from 
sensory perception to MTT, has built the foun­
dations for this science. Those foundations have 
been laid in multiple fields: psychology, neuro­
science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. In 
coming years, researchers may successfully bridge 
the levels of analysis in these diverse fields. The 
surge of recent interest in these questions sug­
gests a growing consensus that prospection, in 
its many guises, has a central role in neural and 
cognitive functioning. In its most “higher-order” 
form, prospection manifests as MTT into the 
future, mind-wandering, subjective temporality, 
creativity, and innovation. Whether or not these 
phenomena can be understood as manifestations 
of some underlying general mechanism remains 
to be seen. 
Prospection has been billed as offering a 
framework for big questions about the self, free 
will, and consciousness. Such high claims invite 
skeptical caution. If prospection is to serve as 
an organizing principle for the cognitive sci­
ences, we will need to recognize its limitations. 
Despite these caveats, what is emerging is a 
distinct and valuable conception of the human 
mind as an embodied predictive system with 
complex cultural and material scaffolding. 
Objects like the Antikythera mechanism tell us 
that humans have obsessed over the future for 
thousands of years. The evolutionary lineage 
of this obsession probably runs back into the 
millions. Ultimately, we will continue using 
prospection to survey possible futures, to shape 
ourselves, and to create pathways to bring about 
the futures we desire.
