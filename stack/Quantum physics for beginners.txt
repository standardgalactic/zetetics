Preface
Quantum mechanics is very puzzling.
A particle can be delocalized,
it can be simultaneously in several energy states
and it can even have several diﬀerent identities at once.
—Serge Haroche∗
Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics or quantum
wave mechanics—born in the late 1800s—is a study of the
submicroscopic world of atoms, the particles that compose them
and the particles that compose those particles. In 1800s, physicists
believed that radiation is a wave phenomenon and matter is
continuous; they believed in the existence of ether and had no ideas
of what charge was. A series of the following experiments performed
in late 1800s led to the formulation of quantum physics:
• Discovery of the electron
• Discovery of X-rays
• Observation of photoelectric eﬀect
• Observation of discrete atomic spectra
Especially important among these was the interpretation of the
spectrum of blackbody radiation that led to the breakdown of the
equipartition theorem for electromagnetic radiation.
This textbook covers the background theory of various eﬀects
discussed from ﬁrst principles, and as clearly as possible, to
∗Haroche was granted the Nobel Prize in 2012 for ground-breaking experimental
methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.

Preface
introduce readers to the main ideas of quantum physics and to
teach the basic mathematical methods and techniques used in the
ﬁelds of advanced quantum physics, atomic physics, laser physics,
nanotechnology, quantum chemistry, and theoretical mathematics.
It also describes some of the key problems of quantum physics,
concentrating on the background derivation, techniques, results,
and interpretations. The book can be understood by a reader with
little or even no previous knowledge of modern and quantum
physics. It will help the readers learn how it comes about that
microscopic objects (particles) behave in unusual ways called
quantum eﬀects, what the term “quantum” means, and where
this idea came from. The book makes no attempt to a complete
exploration of all predictions of quantum physics, but it is hoped
that the predictions and problems explored in it will provide
a useful starting point for those interested in learning more. It
intends to explore problems that have been the most inﬂuential
on the development of quantum physics and formulation of what
we now call modern quantum physics. Many of the predictions of
quantum physics appear to be contrary to our intuitive perceptions,
and the goal to which this book aspires is a compact and logical
exposition and interpretation of these fundamental and unusual
predictions of quantum physics. Moreover, it contains numerous
detailed derivations, proofs, worked examples, discussion problems,
and a wide range of exercises from simple conﬁdence-builders to
fairly challenging problems, hard to ﬁnd in textbooks on quantum
physics. A number of problems, singled out as “tutorial problems”,
have been included in the chapters. It is important that the
readers attempt these problems because they provide adequate
understanding of the chapters. Another small set of the problems
has also been introduced as “challenging problems”, which are more
advanced than the tutorial problems and are designed for readers
with a passion for quantum physics.
The author would like to express his thanks to a number of
students from the University of Queensland, King Saud University,
and King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, who made use

Note to the Reader
Quantum physics is the mathematical description of physical
systems. A famous German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld∗used to
say, “If you want to study quantum physics, I give you three advices:
(1) study mathematics, (2) study mathematics, (3) study more
mathematics”.
Calculus has been used extensively in the book, and therefore,
the necessary prerequisites before attempting to study this book are
that the reader should have some familiarity with wave mechanics,
electromagnetism and optics, and a suﬃcient background in vector
algebra, vector calculus, series and limits. In particular, complex
numbers and functions of a complex variable, partial diﬀerentiation,
multiple integrals, ﬁrst- and second-order diﬀerential equations,
Fourier series, matrix algebra, diagonalization of matrices, eigen-
vectors and eigenvalues, coordinate transformations, and special
functions (Hermite and Legendre polynomials).
∗Sommerfeld graduated in mathematics, worked for few years at some technical
universities as an engineer, and next turned to physics. His greatest contribution to
physics was the improvement of the Bohr model of a hydrogen atom. He included
relativistic eﬀects to the motion of an electron that allowed to explain the ﬁne
structure of the hydrogen spectrum. He also extended the model to elliptical orbits
of the electron to describe the motion in terms of three quantum numbers what
allowed to explain the Zeeman eﬀect.

Chapter 1
Radiation (Light) is a Wave
To anyone who is motivated by anything
beyond the most narrowly practical,
it is worthwhile to understand Maxwell’s equations
simply for the good of his soul.
—J. R. Pierce
It is well known from classical optics that the most commonly
observed phenomena with light (optical radiation) are polarization,
interference, and diﬀraction. These phenomena are characteristic
of waves, and some sort of wave theory is required for their
explanation. Maxwell, in 1860, formulated the wave theory of
light. He predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves that
propagate with a speed, calculated from the laws of electricity and
magnetism, similar to the measured speed of light. The prediction
of electromagnetic waves and the subsequent successful use of
Maxwell’s theory in explaining the interference and diﬀraction
phenomena made the theory to be recognized as the fundamental
wave theory of radiation.
We begin our journey through the fundamentals of quantum
physics with an elementary, but quantitative, classical theory of the
radiative ﬁeld. We ﬁrst brieﬂy outline the electromagnetic theory of
radiation, and describe how the electromagnetic radiation may be
understood as a wave that can be represented by a set of harmonic

oscillators. This is followed by a description of the Hamiltonian
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, which determines the energy of the
electromagnetic wave. In particular, we will be interested in how
the energy of the electromagnetic wave depends on the parameters
characteristic of the wave: amplitude and frequency. In our analysis,
we assume that the readers are familiar with vector algebra and with
the basic concepts of electricity and magnetism.
1.1 Wave Equation
We start by considering the time-varying electric ( ⃗E) and magnetic
(⃗B) ﬁelds that propagate in an empty space, i.e., in the space that
does not contain material bodies, but there can be free charges
and currents present. The ﬁelds propagating in the space satisfy
Maxwell’s equations, the fundamental (experimental) laws relating
to the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors assembled together into a
single set of diﬀerential equationsa
∇· ⃗E = ρ/ε0 ,
(1.1)
∇· ⃗B = 0 ,
(1.2)
∇× ⃗E = −∂
∂t
⃗B ,
(1.3)
∇× ⃗B = μ0 ⃗J + 1
c2
∂
∂t
⃗E ,
(1.4)
where ρ is the density of free charges and ⃗J is the density of currents
at a point where the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are evaluated. The
parameters ε0 and μ0 are constants that determine the property of
the vacuum and are called the electric permittivity and magnetic
permeability, respectively. The parameter c = 1/√ε0μ0, and its
numerical value is equal to the speed of light in vacuum, c = 3 × 108
(ms−1).
The symbol ∇is called “nabla” or “del.” It is a vector diﬀerential
operator and, in the Cartesian coordinates, has the form
∇= ⃗i ∂
∂x + ⃗j ∂
∂y + ⃗k ∂
∂z ,
(1.5)
aReaders familiar with the laws of electricity and magnetism should recognize which
of the fundamental laws of electromagnetism are assembled together to form
Maxwell’s equations.

Wave Equation

where ⃗i, ⃗j, and ⃗k are the unit vectors in the orthogonal x, y, and
z directions, respectively. We have much more to say about this
operator, but for the present it is suﬃcient to note that nabla is
incomplete as it stands; it needs something to operate on. In other
words, nabla may be viewed formally as an operator converting a
scalar function into a vector. The dot (·) and the cross (×) symbols
appearing in Maxwell’s equations are the standard scalar and vector
products between two vectors, respectively.
The fact that the numerical value of c is 3 × 108 [ms−1], which
is the velocity of light in vacuum, led Maxwell to propose an
electromagnetic theory of light, one of the brilliant contributions to
physics of the 19th century.
Let us analyze brieﬂy Maxwell’s idea leading to the electromag-
netic theory of light. Suppose, we have electric and magnetic ﬁelds in
the absence of free currents and charges, ⃗J = 0, ρ = 0. In this case,
Maxwell’s equations (1.1)–(1.4) describe a free electromagnetic
ﬁeld, i.e., an electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuum. Of course, there must
be a source of the ﬁelds somewhere, but the region in which we
consider the ﬁelds is free of currents and charges.
With ⃗J = 0 and ρ = 0, we may reduce Maxwell’s equations into
two diﬀerential equations for ⃗E or ⃗B alone. To show this, we apply
∇× to both sides of Eq. (1.3), and then using Eq. (1.4), we ﬁnd
∇× (∇× ⃗E) = −∂
∂t(∇× ⃗B) = −1
c2
∂2
∂t2 ⃗E .
(1.6)
Since
∇× (∇× ⃗E) = −∇2 ⃗E + ∇(∇· ⃗E) ,
(1.7)
and ∇· ⃗E = 0 in the vacuum, we obtain
∇2 ⃗E −1
c2
∂2
∂t2 ⃗E = 0 ,
(1.8)
where the operator
∇2 = ∇· ∇= ∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2 + ∂2
∂z2
(1.9)
is called Laplacian and is a scalar.
Readers familiar with harmonic motion will recognize that
Eq. (1.8) is a form of the well-known diﬀerential equation in physics,

4
Radiation (Light) is a Wave
called the Helmholtz wave equation for a harmonic motion. It is in
the standard form of a three-dimensional vector wave equation.
Similarly, we can derive a wave equation for the magnetic ﬁeld,
and the readers may readily verify that ﬁeld ⃗B satisﬁes the same
equation as ⃗E:
∇2 ⃗B −1
c2
∂2
∂t2 ⃗B = 0 .
(1.10)
The wave equations (1.8) and (1.10) can be solved with a
minor diﬃculty, and the general solution is given in a form of a
superposition of plane harmonic waves, speciﬁed by the symbol k
as
⃗U =

k
⃗Uk e−i(ωkt−⃗k·⃗r) ,
(1.11)
where ⃗U ≡( ⃗E, ⃗B), the parameter ωk is the frequency of the kth
wave, and ⃗Uk is the amplitude of the ⃗E or ⃗B wave propagating in
the ⃗k direction. The solution (Eq. 1.11) represents a set of harmonic
waves of frequencies ωk and propagating with a velocity c in the ⃗k
direction relative to the position ⃗r of an observation point.
The vector ⃗k is called the wave vector that, as we have already
mentioned, determines the direction of propagation of the kth wave.
From the requirement that Eq. (1.11) is a solution to the wave
equation (Eq. 1.8), we ﬁnd that the magnitude of ⃗k as: |⃗k| = ωk/c =
2π/λk, where λk is the wavelength of the kth wave.a
Summarizing brieﬂy: Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism shows
that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds propagate in vacuum as plane
(electromagnetic) waves.
The electromagnetic waves have speciﬁc properties, which are
determined from Maxwell’s equations. It is easy to show that the
divergence Maxwell’s equations (1.1) and (1.2) demand that for all
directions of propagation ⃗k:
⃗k · ⃗Ek = 0
and
⃗k · ⃗Bk = 0 .
(1.12)
This means that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are both perpen-
dicular to the direction of propagation ⃗k, i.e., both ⃗E and ⃗B have no
aThe relationship between wavelength, velocity, and frequency obtained here is
undoubtedly familiar to the readers who have undertaken courses in physics.

components in the direction of propagation. Such a wave is called a
transverse wave.
Maxwell’s equations (1.3) and (1.4) provide a further restriction
on the ﬁelds that
⃗Bk = 1
c ⃗κ × ⃗Ek ,
(1.13)
where ⃗κ
=
⃗k/|⃗k| is the unit vector in the ⃗k direction. This
equation shows that the electric ( ⃗E) and magnetic (⃗B) ﬁelds
of an electromagnetic wave propagating in vacuum are mutually
orthogonal ( ⃗E ⊥⃗B).
In summary: From the foregoing, we see that only transverse waves
are predicted in vacuum, both electric and magnetic ﬁelds being
perpendicular to the direction of propagation and to each other.
1.2 Energy of the Electromagnetic Wave
Electromagnetic waves contain and transport energy. The energy of
an electromagnetic wave is carried in its electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
a result we could well anticipate in view of our knowledge of the
properties of electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
In order to determine the energy carried by an electromagnetic
wave and how the energy depends on the parameters characteristic
of the wave (amplitude and frequency), we consider a simple
example of a plane electromagnetic wave propagating in one
dimension, say the positive z-axis: ⃗k · ⃗r = kz. Suppose that the wave
is linearly polarized in the x-direction. In this case, the wave may be
determined by the electric ﬁeld
⃗E (z, t) = ⃗i Ex (z, t) = ⃗iq (t) sin(kz) ,
(1.14)
where q (t) represents the time-dependent amplitude of the electric
ﬁeld.
The energy of the electromagnetic wave is given by the
Hamiltonian

,
(1.15)
where ε0| ⃗E 2|/2 is the density of energy stored in the electric ﬁeld,
and |⃗B|2/(2μ0) is the density of energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld.

6
Radiation (Light) is a Wave
The integration is to be carried out over the whole length L where
the wave exists.
One can see from Eq. (1.15) that to determine the energy of
the electromagnetic wave, we need the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B. Since we
know the electric ﬁeld, we can ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld from the
Maxwell equation (1.4). For the electromagnetic wave, the magnetic
vector ⃗B is perpendicular to ⃗E and oriented along the y-axis.
Hence, the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld can be found from the
following equation:
∇× ⃗B = ⃗i 1
c2 ˙q (t) sin(kz) .
(1.16)
Since Bx = Bz = 0 and By ̸= 0, and obtain
∇× ⃗B = −⃗i ∂By
∂z + ⃗k ∂By
∂x = ⃗i 1
c2 ˙q (t) sin(kz) .
(1.17)
The coeﬃcients on both sides of Eq. (1.17) at the same unit vectors
should be equal. Hence, we ﬁnd that
∂By
∂x = 0
and
∂By
∂z = −1
c2 ˙q (t) sin(kz) .
(1.18)
Then, integrating ∂By/∂z over z, we ﬁnd
By (z, t) = −1
c2 ˙q (t)

dz sin(kz) =
1
kc2 ˙q (t) cos(kz) .
(1.19)
Thus, the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, given by the
Hamiltonian (1.15), is of the form
H = 1

ε0q2 (t) sin2(kz) +

(1.21)
and μ0 = 1/c2ε0, the Hamiltonian H reduces to
H = 1

ε0
ω2 L(˙q (t))2 .
(1.22)
An inspection of this equation leads us to conclude that the energy
of the electromagnetic wave is proportional to the square of its
amplitude, q (t).

Note that the Hamiltonian (1.22) is in the form of the familiar
Hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator. It is easy to prove. We know
from classical mechanics that the energy of a harmonic oscillator is
given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies as

Summary
We have learned that
(1) The electromagnetic ﬁeld propagates in vacuum as transverse
plane waves, which can be represented by a set of harmonic os-
cillators. Thus, according to Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory,
radiation (light) is a wave.
(2) The energy (intensity) of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is propor-
tional to the square of the amplitude of the oscillation.

Solution
To show that the electric ﬁeld (1.24) satisﬁes the wave equation, we
have to calculate the time and coordinate second derivatives of ⃗E.

Difficulties of the Wave Theory of
Radiation
We have already seen how the fundamental laws of electromag-
netism led to the prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave.
But what properties of light are commonly observed in experiments?
Since light has been recognized as a wave phenomenon, one can say
that we shall observe properties characteristic of waves. Classical
optics provides us with many examples of phenomena reﬂecting the
wave character of light. Typical are polarization, interference, and
diﬀraction phenomena. However, a series of experiments performed
in the late 19th century showed that the wave model predicted
from Maxwell’s equations is not the correct description of the
properties of light. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the
experiments that provided evidence that light, which we have
recognized as a wave phenomenon, has properties that we normally
associate with particles. In particular, these experiments indicated
that in some phenomena, the energy of light does not show up as
being proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation; it is rather
proportional to the frequency of the oscillation. The experimental
results will force us to conclude that the wave theory of light is
simply inappropriate to explain these phenomena. We will discover

Difficulties of the Wave Theory of Radiation
later that to explain these phenomena and to understand the
physical processes involved, some kind of a corpuscular theory of
light is required.
2.1 Discovery of Electron
Let us ﬁrst discuss brieﬂy how the idea of the existence of discrete
(corpuscular) structures has been innovated in physics. The ﬁrst
idea of the existence of discrete structures referred to physics of
materials and their electric properties.a Joseph Thomson, in his
famous q/m experiment performed in 1896, measured the ratio of
the charge q to the mass m of the cathode beam particles.b He found
that the ratio q/m
• Did not depend on the cathode material.
• Did not depend on the residual gas in the tube.
• Did not depend on anything else about the experiment.
This independence, discovered by Thomson, showed that the
particles in the cathode beam are a common element of all
materials.c
In 1910–13, Robert Millikan performed a series of oil-drop
experiments, in which he measured electric charge of individual oil
drops.d In these experiments, he made an important observatione
that every drop had a charge q equal to some small integer multiple
of a basic (elementary) charge e (q = ne), where n is an integer
(n = 1, 2, . . .), and e = 1.602177 × 10−19 [C].
aIn fact, the idea of the corpuscular nature of the physical world, particularly the
corpuscular nature of light, was ﬁrst introduced by Newton. It was abounded when
the wave properties of light were observed experimentally.
bFor a complete discussion of Thomson’s experiment see, for example, R.A. Serway,
C.J. Moses, and C.A. Moyer, Modern Physics (Saunders, New York, 1989), p. 80.
cThomson was granted the Nobel prize in 1906 for his theoretical and experimental
investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.
dFor a complete discussion of Millikan’s experiment see, for example, R.A. Serway, C.J.
Moses, and C.A. Moyer, Modern Physics (Saunders, New York, 1989), p. 83.
eMillikan was granted the Nobel Prize in 1923 for his work on the elementary charge
of electricity.

Discovery of Electron
13
Thus, we may summarize that Thomson’s and Millikan’s experi-
ments clearly indicate that matter is not continuous but composed of
discrete particles. The most important discovery was the existence
of particles that are a common element of all materials! These
particles are electrons, and Millikan’s experiments showed that each
electron carries the same amount of electric charge. Physicists
believe, but not all are convinced, that electrons do not have internal
structure and are the smallest particles (elementary particles) that
exist in the universe. Why there exist the smallest particle remains,
however, one of the unsolved mysteries of physics.
2.1.1 Discovery of X-Rays
In 1895, Wilhelm R¨ontgen was interested in the study of the
passage of a cathode beam through an aluminum-foil window. He
made a classic observation that a highly penetrating radiation of
unknown nature was produced when the cathode beam impinged on
matter. He observed that the radiation traveled in straight lines even
through electric and magnetic ﬁelds. He also found that the radiation
passed readily through opaque materials and exposed photographic
plates for no apparent reason. He called this unknown radiation X-
rays.a
In 1906, Charles Barklab observed a partial polarization of X-rays,
which indicated that they were transverse waves.
If X-rays are transverse waves and are invisible, then an obvious
question arises: What are the wavelengths of X-rays?
To answer this question, let us think how we can measure the
wavelength of X-rays. One possibility, in principle at least, would be
to perform Young’s double-slit experiment. However, any attempt to
measure the wavelength using Young’s double-slit experiment was
unsuccessful with no interference pattern observed.
In 1912, Max Laue got an idea that resolved this problem. He
explained that no interference pattern was observed simply because
the wavelengths of X-rays were too small. To explore his argument,
aR¨ontgen was granted the Nobel Prize in 1901 for his discovery of X-rays.
bBarkla was granted the Nobel Prize in 1917 for his discovery of the characteristic
X-rays of elements.

14
Difficulties of the Wave Theory of Radiation
consider the condition for observation of an interference pattern
2d sin θn = nλ ,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
(2.1)
from which we have
sin θn = nλ
2d ,
(2.2)
where λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the separation between
the slits, and the integer n numbers the successive maxima or
minima in the interference pattern. For λ ≪d, we have sin θn ≈0
even for large n. Hence, to make sin θn ≈1 to see the interference
fringes separated from each other, the separation d between the slits
should be very small.
Laue proposed to use a crystal for the interference experiment.a
This Nobel Prize winning idea was based on the following
observation: In crystals, the average separation between the atoms,
acting as slits, is about d ≈0.1 nm. From the experiment, he found
that the wavelength of the measured X-rays was λ ≈0.6 nm. Typical
X-ray wavelengths are in the range 0.001–1 nm. These are very
short wavelengths well outside the ultraviolet wavelengths. For a
comparison, visible light wavelengths are between λ ≈410 nm
(violet) and λ ≈656 nm (red).
We know how to generate visible light, but how this invisible
radiation of such small wavelengths is generated?
This can be explained as follows: X-rays are generated when
high-speed electrons crash into the anode and rapidly deaccelerate.
It is well known from the theory of classical electrodynamics that
electrons, when deaccelerated, emit radiation. In other words, their
kinetic energy is converted into radiation energy (braking, i.e.,
deaccelerating radiation, often referred to by the German phrase
bremsstrahlung).
The total instantaneous power P radiated by the deaccelerated
electron is given by the Larmor formula:
P = 2
3
e2
4πε0c3 |a|2 ,
(2.3)
where |a| is the magnitude of the deacceleration of the electron.
aLaue was granted the Nobel Prize in 1914 for his discovery of the diﬀraction of X-rays
by crystals.

Photoelectric Effect
15
Hence, due to the continuous deacceleration of the electrons,
the spectrum I(λ) of X-rays also should be continuous. However,
the experimentally observed spectrum of the X-rays is composed
of two pronounced peaks at certain wavelengths superimposed on
a continuous background (see Fig. 2.1). It is observed that the
position of the two peaks depends only on the material of the anode
(characteristic radiation). The origin of the two lines is unknown!
Figure 2.1
An example of experimentally observed spectrum I(λ) of X-ray
radiation.
Yet another unexpected property of the X-rays spectrum is as
follows. For a given potential V , experiments showed that X-rays
of diﬀerent wavelengths were produced, giving the continuous
background seen in Fig. 2.1, but none of the wavelengths was shorter
than a certain wavelength λmin. The minimum wavelength λmin was
observed to depend only on the potential in the tube (λmin ∼V )
and was the same for all target (anode) material. The reason was
unknown!
2.2 Photoelectric Effect
In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the photoelectric eﬀect: emis-
sion of electrons from a surface (cathode) when light strikes on it.
If a positively charged electrode is placed near the photoemissive
cathode to attract photoelectrons, an electric current can be made
to ﬂow in response to the incident light.

16
Difficulties of the Wave Theory of Radiation
Figure 2.2
Photoelectric eﬀect for two diﬀerent intensities I1 and I2 (I1 >
I2) of the incident light.
The following properties of the photoelectric eﬀect were
observed:
1. When a monochromatic light falls on the cathode, no electrons
are emitted, regardless of the intensity of the light, unless the
frequency (not the intensity!) of the incident light is high enough
to exceed some minimum value, called the threshold frequency.
The threshold frequency was found to be dependent on the
material of the cathode.
2. Once the frequency of the incident light is greater than the
threshold value, some electrons are emitted from the cathode
with a nonzero speed. The reversed potential is required to stop
the electrons (stopping potential: eVs = 1
2mv2).
3. When the intensity of light is increased, while its frequency is
kept the same, more electrons are emitted, but the stopping
potential Vs is the same (see Fig. 2.2).
Conclusion: Velocity of the electrons, which is proportional to
the energy, is unaﬀected by changes in the intensity of the
incident light.
4. When the frequency of light is increased, ν2 > ν1, the stopping
potential increased, Vs2 > Vs1 (see Fig. 2.3).
In summary: We see that the results of the experiments on
photoelectric eﬀect are in contradiction to classical wave theory.

These puzzling features of the photoelectric eﬀect suggest that the
energy of light is not proportional to its intensity but is proportional
to the frequency:
E ∼ν
or
E ∼1

ν = c

.
(2.4)
It is impossible to explain the aspects of the photoelectric eﬀect
by means of the wave theory of light that gives no reason why the
energy of a light beam should be proportional to frequency. The
wave theory of light leads one to anticipate that a long-wavelength
light incident on a surface could cause enough energy to be absorbed
for an electron to be released. Moreover, when electrons are emitted,
an increase in the incident light intensity should cause an emitted
electron to have more kinetic energy rather than more electrons of
the same average energy to be emitted.
2.3 Compton Scattering
Compton scattering experiments, named after Arthur Compton
who, in 1924, performed a series of experiments on scattering of

18
Difficulties of the Wave Theory of Radiation
X-rays on free electrons,a provided additional direct conﬁrmation
that energy of light is proportional to its frequency rather than to
the amplitude. In the Compton experiment, the light of a wavelength
λ was scattered on free electrons, as shown in Fig. 2.4.
Figure 2.4
Schematic diagram of the Compton scattering. An incident light
of wavelength λ is scattered on free electrons and the scattered light of
wavelength λ′ is detected in the α direction.
It was observed that during the scattering process, the intensity
of the incident light did not change, but the wavelength changed
such that the wavelength of the scattered light was larger than the
incident light, i.e., λ′ > λ.
Conclusion: From energy conservation, we have
E = E ′ + Ee ,
(2.5)
where Ee is the energy of the scattered electrons.
Since Ee > 0, E ′ < E, indicating that the energy of the incident light
is proportional to the frequency, or equivalently, to the inverse of the
wavelength
E ∼ν
or
E ∼1
λ .
(2.6)
This is another notable departure from the predictions of the wave
theory of radiation.
aCompton was granted the Nobel Prize in 1927 for his discovery of the eﬀect named
after him.

Discrete Atomic Spectra
19
2.4 Discrete Atomic Spectra
In a diﬀerent area of physics, radiation spectroscopy experiments
show that light emitted by a hot solid or liquid exhibits a continuous
spectrum, i.e., light of all wavelengths is emitted. In 1814, Joseph
von Fraunhoﬀer observed that the continuous spectrum of light
coming from the sun also contained some discrete (black) lines
that were later recognized as absorption lines corresponding to the
elements in the outer atmosphere of the sun. Moreover, experiments
showed that the spectrum of light emitted by a hot gas contained
only a few isolated sharp lines (see Fig. 2.5) of the following
properties:
Figure 2.5
An example of discrete radiation spectrum emitted from single
atoms.
• Each spectral line corresponds to a diﬀerent frequency.
• The lines group into separate sequences, called spectral
series.
• Diﬀerent gases produce diﬀerent sets of lines.
• When we increase the temperature of a gas, more lines at
larger frequencies are emitted.
Once again, we are faced with the diﬃculty of explaining
experimental observations using the wave theory of light. Evidently,
these results contradict the prediction of the wave theory of light
since the experimentally observed spectra show that energy is
proportional to frequency, E
∼ν, not to the amplitude of the
emitted light. Moreover, this shows that the structure of atoms is not
continuous.

20
Difficulties of the Wave Theory of Radiation
Then additional questions arise: What is an atom composed of?
How does the discrete spectrum relate to the internal structure of
the atom?
These questions were left without answers at that time.
Summary
A series of experiments on properties of X-rays, properties of
photoelectric eﬀect, Compton scattering and atomic spectra suggest
that energy of the radiation ﬁeld (light) is not proportional to its
amplitude, as one could expect from the wave theory of light, but
to the frequency of the radiation ﬁeld, E ∼ν.
In the next chapter, we consider one more example of unusual
experimental results, the blackbody radiation, which solved the
problem.

Chapter 3
Blackbody Radiation
The radiation emitted by a body that is heated is called thermal
radiation. All bodies emit and absorb such radiation. We have
just seen that hot gases or individual atoms emit radiation with
characteristic discrete lines. In contrast, hot matter in a condensate
state (solid or liquid) emits radiation with a continuous distribution
of wavelengths rather than a line spectrum.
In this chapter, we will consider spectral distribution of the
continuous radiation emitted by a blackbody, i.e., the dependence
of the intensity of the blackbody radiation on the wavelength of
the radiation.a First, we will deﬁne what we mean by a blackbody.
Blackbody is an object that absorbs completely all radiation falling
on it, independent of its frequency, wavelength, and intensity. In
other words, no reﬂections occur from a blackbody.
Examples: Consider a box with perfectly reﬂecting sides and with a
small hole, as illustrated in Fig. 3.1. The small hole, not the box itself,
can be treated as a blackbody. Radiation of an arbitrary wavelength
aIn spectroscopy, the spectral distribution (or spectrum) of a radiation is usually
determined by the dependence of the radiation intensity on frequency rather than
wavelength. Since the blackbody spectrum was ﬁrst analyzed in terms of wavelength,
we will follow this historical development.

that strikes on the hole gets lost inside the box. Thus, no reﬂection
occurs from the hole, which is the property of a blackbody.
Formulation of the correct theoretical approach to calculate
the spectrum of the blackbody radiation was a major challenge
in theoretical physics during the late 19th century. In 1900,
Strutt (Lord) Rayleigh calculated the energy density distribution
I(λ) of the radiation emitted by the blackbody box at absolute
temperature T .
According to Rayleigh, the energy density distribution (spec-
trum) of the blackbody radiation is of the form
I(λ) = Nλ⟨E⟩,
(3.1)
where Nλ is the number of radiating oscillators (modes), per unit
volume and unit wavelength, inside the boxa
Nλ = 8π
λ4 ,
(3.2)
and ⟨E⟩is the average energy of each mode. Note that ⟨E⟩in
the Rayleigh and Jeans formula is the same for each mode. This
is consistent with the wave theory of radiation that the energy
of a radiation wave is proportional to its amplitude, not to the
wavelength λ.
aThe formula for the density of modes derived by Rayleigh missed the factor 8, which
was corrected by James Jeans in 1905. Therefore, the energy density distribution
(3.1) is called the Rayleigh–Jeans formula.

Number of Radiation Modes inside a Box
23
Before discussing the Rayleigh–Jeans formula in details, we will
ﬁrst prove Eq. (3.2) for the number of modes inside the box, and next
we will ﬁnd the average energy of each mode in terms of the absolute
temperature T .
3.1 Number of Radiation Modes inside a Box
Consider an electromagnetic wave conﬁned in the volume V . We
take a plane wave propagating in the ⃗r direction, which in terms of
x, y, z components can be written as
⃗E = ⃗E0 sin (kxx) sin

kyy

sin (kzz) sin (ωt + φ) .
(3.3)
The wave propagating in the box interferes with the waves reﬂected
from the walls. The interference will destroy the wave unless it forms
a standing wave inside the box. The wave forms a standing wave
when the amplitude of the wave vanishes at the walls. This happens
when
sin (kxx) = 0 ,
sin

kyy

= 0 ,
sin (kzz) = 0 ,
(3.4)
i.e., when
kx = nπ
x ,
ky = mπ
y
,
kz = lπ
z ,
(3.5)
where n, m, l are integer numbers (n, m, l = 1, 2, 3, . . .).
The conditions (3.5) are called the boundary condition, i.e.,
condition imposed on the wave at the walls to form standing
waves inside the box. The standing wave condition is common to
all conﬁned waves. In vibrating violin strings or organ pipes, for
example, it also happens that only those frequencies that satisfy the
aforementioned boundary condition are permitted. Thus, inside the
box, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is a combination of standing waves.
Since k = 2π/λ, we have the following condition for a standing
wave inside the box in terms of the wavelength
x = nλ
2 ,
y = mλ
2 ,
z = lλ
2 ,
(3.6)
We see that each set of the numbers (n, m, l) corresponds to a
particular wave, which we call mode.

24
Blackbody Radiation
Figure 3.2
Illustration of the positive octant of k-space. The dots represent
modes of diﬀerent (n, m, l). In the limit of a large number of modes,
the roughness of the edges is insigniﬁcant. Therefore, we can assume a
continuous distribution of the modes and approximate it by a sphere.
To ﬁnd the number of modes inside the box in terms of frequency
or wavelength of the radiation, it is convenient to work in the
propagation k-space spanned on the components kx, ky, and kz of the
⃗k vector, as shown in Fig. 3.2. Each set of the components kx, ky, kz
is represented by the numbers n, m, l.
We will calculate the number of the modes as the ratio of the
volume occupied by all the modes to the volume occupied by a single
mode.
In the k-space, a single mode, say (n, m, l) = (1, 1, 1), occupies a
volume
Vk = kxkykz = π3
xyz = π3
V ,
(3.7)
where V = xyz is the volume of the box.
Since kx, ky, kz are positive numbers, the modes propagate only
in the positive octant of the k-space. The number of modes inside the
octant, shown in Fig. 3.2, is given by
N(k) = 1
8
4
3πk3
Vk
,
(3.8)
i.e., it is equal to the volume of the octant occupied by all the modes
divided by the volume occupied by a single mode. Since k = 2πν/c,

Average Energy of a Radiation Mode
25
we get
N(k) = 8πν3
3c3 V ,
(3.9)
where we have increased N(k) by a factor of 2. This arises from
the fact that the light is assumed to be generated by a thermal ﬁeld
and hence is completely unpolarized. Thus, it may be regarded as a
mixture of waves of two mutually orthogonal polarizations.
In the limit of a large number of modes, we can assume a
continuous distribution of the modes, and then the number of modes
per unit volume and per unit frequency needed for the energy
density distribution is
Nν = 1
V
dN(k)
dν
= 8πν2
c3
.
(3.10)
In terms of wavelengths λ, the number of modes per unit volume and
per unit of wavelength is given by the following conversion formula:
Nλ = 1

dN(k)

 .
(3.11)
Since ν = c/λ and dν = (−c/λ2)dλ, we obtain
Nλ = 8π
λ4 .
(3.12)
This is the ﬁnal formula for the number of modes (allowed standing
waves) inside the box. Note that the number of modes is determined
in terms of wavelength, and Eq. (3.11) must be kept in mind when
translating results for the mode density from a wavelength to a
frequency scale.
3.2 Average Energy of a Radiation Mode: Equipartition
Theorem
We now return to the Rayleigh and Jeans calculations of the energy
density distribution I(λ) of the blackbody radiation:
I(λ) = Nλ⟨E⟩.
(3.13)
The average energy of a radiation mode that appears in Eq. (3.13)
may be found from the so-called equipartition theorem. This is a

26
Blackbody Radiation
rigorous theorem of classical statistical mechanics, which states
that, in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature T , the average
energy associated with each degree of freedom of an oscillator
(mode) is
⟨E⟩= 1
2kBT ,
(3.14)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant. In other words, the equiparti-
tion theorem says that all modes have the same energy, irrespective
of their frequencies or wavelengths.
The number of degrees of freedom is deﬁned to be the number
of squared terms appearing in the expression for the total
energy of the atom (mode).
For example, consider an atom moving in three dimensions. The
kinetic energy of the atom is given by
E = 1
2mv2
x + 1
2mv2
y + 1
2mv2
z .
(3.15)
There are three quadratic terms in the energy, and therefore the
atom has three degrees of freedom and a thermal energy 3
2kBT .
The energy of a single radiation mode inside a box is the energy
of an electromagnetic wave
H = 1

ε0| ⃗E|2 + 1


.
(3.16)
Because this expression contains two squared terms, Rayleigh and
Jeans argued that each mode had two degrees of freedom and
therefore
⟨E⟩= kBT .
(3.17)
Hence, the energy density distribution (spectrum) of the blackbody
radiation is given by
I(λ) = 8π
λ4 kBT .
(3.18)
This is the Rayleigh–Jeans formula, which shows that the energy
density distribution depends linearly on the temperature and
is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radiation
wavelength. It predicts that at any temperature, I(λ) tends to inﬁnity
as λ →0. It is obviously an impossible law, since it predicts an
inﬁnite intensity at any ﬁnite temperature.

Rayleigh–Jeans Formula versus the Experiment
27
Figure 3.3
Energy density distribution (energy spectrum) of the blackbody
radiation. The dashed line shows the prediction of the Rayleigh–Jeans
theory. The dotted line shows the shift of the maximum of I(λ) with
temperature T .
3.3 Rayleigh–Jeans Formula versus the Experiment
Figure 3.3 shows the experimentally observed spectrum of the
blackbody radiation. In this ﬁgure, T3 > T2 > T1. Note that the
maxima of the spectral lines move toward shorter wavelengths as
the temperature increases. This could be expected as a radiating
body changes color when the temperature is raised. However, the
most interesting signiﬁcance, seen in Fig. 3.3, is that the Rayleigh–
Jeans formula agrees quite well with the experiment in the long-
wavelength region but disagrees violently at short wavelengths.
The experimentally observed behavior shows that for some
reason, the short-wavelength modes do not contribute, i.e., they are
frozen out. As λ tends to zero, I(λ) tends to zero. The theoretical
Rayleigh–Jeans formula goes to inﬁnity as λ tends to zero, leading to
an absurd result known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. Moreover, the
theoretical prediction does not even pass through a maximum.
An aside: The Rayleigh–Jeans formula represents something
worse than a disagreement between theory and experiment, namely,
a contradiction within the theory itself. Perfectly logical application
of well-established theory led in this case to results that were not
just wrong but entirely unthinkable.

We can summarize the chapter on the wave theory of radiation as

The experimental results on the spectrum of X-rays, properties
of photoelectric eﬀect, Compton scattering, atomic spectra, and the
spectrum of the blackbody radiation indicate that something is
seriously wrong with the wave theory of light!
In the next chapter, we will show how the lack of any concepts in
classical physics that could explain these results led to new ideas
in physics. We shall see that these results can be explained by
abandoning the classical physics concepts and introducing a new
concept: the particle concept of radiation. In other words, these
experiments led to the failure of classical physics and the birth of
quantum physics.

Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis: Birth of
Quantum Theory
Shortly after the derivation of the Rayleigh–Jeans formula, Max
Planck found a simple way to explain the experimental behavior, but
in doing so he contradicted the prediction of the wave theory of light,
which had been so carefully developed over the previous hundred
years, that energy of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to its
amplitude. Planck realized that the ultraviolet catastrophe could be
eliminated by assuming that the average energy ⟨E⟩depends on
the frequency of a mode and each mode could only take up energy
in well-deﬁned discrete portions (small packets or quanta), each
having the energya
E = hν = ℏω ,

ℏ= h
2π ,
ω = 2πν
	
,
(4.1)
where the constant h is adjusted to ﬁt the experimentally observed
I(λ).
The concept of quanta was considered by many physicists as
a mathematical trick. In a published paper, Planck states: “We
consider, however −this is the most essential point of the whole
aPlanck was granted the Nobel Prize in 1918 for the concept of energy quanta.

Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
calculations −E to be composed of a very deﬁnite number of equal
parts and use thereto the constant of nature h.” If there are n quanta
in the radiation mode, the energy of the mode is En = nhν.
The view that light is composed of small packets of energy
is directly opposed to the wave theory of light. More precisely,
the contrast between the wave and Planck’s hypothesis is that in
the classical case the mode energy is continuous, i.e., can lie at
any position between 0 and ∞of the energy line, whereas in the
quantum case the mode energy can only take on discrete (point)
values.
The assumption of the discrete energy distribution required
a modiﬁcation of the equipartition theorem. Planck introduced
“discrete portions” so that he might apply Boltzmann’s statistical
ideas to calculate the energy density distribution of the blackbody
radiation.
4.1 Boltzmann Distribution Function
The solution to the blackbody problem may be developed from
a calculation of the average energy of a harmonic oscillator of
frequency ν in thermal equilibrium at temperature T .
The probability that at temperature T an arbitrary system, such
as a radiation mode, has an energy En is given by the Boltzmann
distribution
Pn =
e−En/kBT

n
e−En/kBT ,
(4.2)
which assumes an exponential distribution of the energy between
diﬀerent modes. The detailed derivation of the Boltzmann distribu-
tion (Eq. 4.2) is given in Appendix A.
For quantized energy En = nℏω, we ﬁnd thata
Pn =
e−nx
∞

n=0
e−nx
,
(4.3)
where x = ℏω/kBT is a dimensionless parameter.
aWe write the energy in terms of ℏω rather than hν as in quantum physics the form ℏω
is used more frequently.

Planck’s Formula for I(λ)
33
Since the sum ∞
n=0 e−nx is a particular example of a geometric
series, and | exp(−nx)| < 1 for all n’s, we readily ﬁnd that the sum
tends to the limita
∞

n=0
e−nx =
1
1 −e−x .
(4.4)
Hence, we can write the Boltzmann distribution function (Eq. 4.2) in
a simple form
Pn =

1 −e−x
e−nx .
(4.5)
This is a very simple formula, sometimes called the Planck
distribution function. It tells us about the distribution of photons
among diﬀerent modes. We will use this formula in our calculations
of the average energy ⟨E⟩, average number of photons ⟨n⟩, and
higher statistical moments, e.g., ⟨n2⟩.
4.2 Planck’s Formula for I(λ)
Assuming that n is a discrete variable, Planck showed that the
average energy of the radiation mode is

and ﬁnally
I(λ) =
8πhc
λ5 
ehc/λkBT −1
 ,
(4.8)
which is called Planck’s formula, and the numerical constant h,
known as the Planck constant, adjusted such that the energy density
distribution (Eq. 4.8) agrees with the experimental results, is
h = 6.626 × 10−34 [J · s] = 4.14 × 10−15 [eV · s] .
(4.9)
aIn statistical physics, the sum is called the partition function.
bThe details of the evolution of the sum in Eq. (4.6) are left for the readers as a tutorial
problem; see the Tutorial Problem 4.2

34
Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
Remember the importance of Planck’s idea of n being a discrete
variable. Thus, Eqs. (3.18) and (4.8) for the radiation spectrum
contrast the discrete energy distribution with the continuous.
How important for the explanation of the blackbody spectrum
was to assume that n is a discrete variable? To answer this question,
simply check how Planck’s formula ﬁts into the experimentally
observed spectra. There are two interesting limited cases for λ: λ ≫
1 and λ ≪1.
Look carefully at the denominator of Eq. (4.8). For long
wavelengths, (λ ≫1), i.e., for a wavelength range such that
hc/λkBT ≪1, we can expand the exponent appearing in Eq. (4.8)
into a Taylor series and when we neglect powers of hc/λkBT higher
than the ﬁrst, we obtain

ehc/λkBT −1

= 1 +
hc
λkBT + . . . −1 ≈
hc
λkBT .
(4.10)
The Planck spectrum then gives simply
I(λ) = 8πhc
λ5

hc
λkBT
	−1
= 8π
λ4 kBT ,
(4.11)
which is the Rayleigh–Jeans formula. Thus, for long wavelengths
(λ ≫1), Planck’s formula agrees perfectly with the equipartition
theorem. We should point out here that only in the region of long
wavelengths, Planck’s formula and the Rayleigh–Jeans formula give
the same result for the spectrum. Outside this region, discreteness
brings about Planck’s quantum corrections. It is most evident in the
region of short wavelengths.
Let us see what Planck’s formula predicts for short wavelengths.
For short wavelengths, λ ≪1, we can ignore 1 in the denominator
of Eq. (4.8) as it is much smaller than the exponent. Then
I(λ) =
8πhc
λ5ehc/λkBT .
(4.12)
As λ →0, the factor ehc/λkBT →∞, and λ5 →0. It is not clear
that I(λ) will go to zero as λ →0. However, ea/λ function goes to
inﬁnity faster than λ5 goes to zero. Therefore, I(λ) →0 as λ →0,
which agrees perfectly with the observed energy density spectrum
(see Fig. 3.3).

Planck’s Formula for I(λ)
35
4.2.1 Wien and Stefan–Boltzmann Laws
The experimental results show that I(λ) passes through a maximum
whose position depends on the temperature T . Planck’s formula
also shows that I(λ) reaches a maximum whose the position
depends on T and agrees perfectly with that predicted by the
experimental results. The dependence of the position of the
maximum on T is given by the Wien displacement law
λmaxT =
hc
4.9651kB
= constant ,
(4.13)
where λmax is the value of λ at which I(λ) is maximal. The factor
4.9651 is a solution to the equation
e−x + 1
5x −1 = 0 .
(4.14)
The Wien lawa says that with increasing temperature of the
radiating body, the maximum of the intensity shifts toward shorter
wavelengths. In terms of energy, higher temperatures tend to give
higher photon energies.
Moreover, Planck’s formula correctly predicts the experimental
observation, the Stefan–Boltzmann lawb, giving the variation of the
total power per unit area of the emitted blackbody radiation with the
fourth power of its absolute temperature
I = c
4
 ∞
0
I(λ)dλ = σ T 4 ,
(4.15)
where I is the total intensity of the emitted radiation and σ is
a constant, called the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.c The factor c/4,
where c is the speed of light, arises from the relation between the
intensity spectrum (radiance) and the energy density distribution.
The relation follows from classical electromagnetic theory.d
aWien was granted the Nobel Prize in 1911 for his discoveries regarding the laws
governing the radiation of heat.
bThe Stefan–Boltzmann law was found experimentally by Stefan and later deduced
theoretically by Boltzmann.
cDetails of the derivation of the Stefan–Boltzmann law are left as a tutorial problem;
see Tutorial Problem 4.7.
dApart from the factor 1/4, one could have guessed the multiplication by speed of
light using the following analysis: To turn density (energy/volume) into power/area,
we have to multiply by something with units of distance/time, and the only relevant
speed in the problem involving radiation is the speed of light.

36
Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
The Stefan–Boltzmann law is reﬂected in the blackbody spectrum
as the areas under the intensity proﬁle.a As the temperature
increases, the area under the intensity proﬁle increases rapidly
with T .
An interesting observation: Quantum against continuous
To explore the importance of the discrete distribution of the
radiation energy, in other words, the importance to assume that n
is a discrete variable, it is useful to compare Planck’s formula for a
discrete n with that for a continuous n.
Thus, assume for a moment that n is a continuous, rather than a
discrete, variable. Then the Boltzmann distribution takes the form
Pn =
e−nx
∞
0
dn e−nx
,
(4.16)
and hence the average energy is given by
⟨E⟩= ℏω
∞
0
dn ne−nx
∞
0
dn e−nx
= −ℏω (1/x)′
1/x
= ℏω
x
= kBT ,
(4.17)
where ′ denotes the ﬁrst derivative of 1/x with respect to x.
This result is the one expected from the classical equipartition
theorem.
Looking backward with the knowledge of the quantum hy-
pothesis, we see that the essence of the blackbody calculation
is remarkably simple and provides a dramatic illustration of the
profound diﬀerence that can arise from summing things discretely
instead of continuously, i.e., making an integration.
We see from the above that the physical world prefers a
sum over an integration, but why it happens still escapes our
understanding.
aThe thermal radiation from many real materials that are not black is found
experimentally to be very nearly proportional to the fourth power of the absolute
temperature, but with a proportionality constant, which is smaller than σ.

More interesting observations: Energy and mass measured with a
clock
Time is measured by a periodically oscillating device, a clock.
Since, according to the quantum hypothesis, energy of the
radiation depends on time
E = hν = h
τ ,
(4.18)
where τ is the period of oscillation, it also should be measured with
a clock.
Even more, since
E = mc2 = h
τ ,
(4.19)
mass should be measured with a clock as well.

38
Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
In statistical physics, the ratio α is used as a measure of the
departure of photon statistics from a Poissonian distribution: α < 1
means sub-Poissonian, α = 1 means Poissonian, and α > 1 means
super-Poissonian distribution of photons.
Problem 4.3 Suppose that photons in a radiation ﬁeld have a

(b) In part (a), we have obtained λmax by setting dI(λ)/dλ = 0.
Transform Planck’s formula from the wavelength to frequency
dependence and calculate νmax by setting dI(ν)/dν = 0. Is it
possible to obtain νmax from λmax simply by using λmax = c/νmax?
Note, νmax is the frequency at which the intensity of the emitted
radiation is maximal.

4.3 Photoelectric Effect: Quantum Explanation
We have just learned about the spectacular triumph of quantum
hypothesis to be able to explain the experimentally observed
blackbody radiation spectra. The quantum hypothesis of light was
also successful in explaining the photoelectric eﬀect. It was explored
by Albert Einsteina who extended Planck’s hypothesis by postulating
that these discrete quanta of energy hν, which are emitted at time,
can also propagate as individual well-localized quanta (particles of
light), which he termed photons.b
Einstein proposed that the photoelectric eﬀect can be explained
in terms of the energy conservation. The energy of a single photon
is E = hν, and then the photoelectric eﬀect is given by the energy
conservation formula
hν = W + 1
2mv2
max ,
(4.20)
where W is the work function required to remove an electron from
the plate, and vmax is the maximal velocity of the removed electrons.
The photoelectric eﬀect showed that photons of an incident
light of a frequency less than a threshold frequency νT (a cutoﬀ
frequency) do not have enough energy to remove an electron from a
particular plate. From Einstein’s photoelectric formula, we see that
the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the plate
is
aEinstein was granted the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his discovery of the law of
photoelectric eﬀect.
bIn fact, the term “photon” was ﬁrst introduced by Gilbert Lewis in 1926 (Nature
118, 784 (1926)). The term “photon” did not appear in Einstein’s paper on the
photoelectric eﬀect. He used the term “localized quanta of energy.”

40
Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
hνT = W ,
(4.21)
which agrees with the experimental prediction.
The stopping potential—the potential at which the photoelectric
current does drop to zero—is found from
eVs = 1
2mv2
max ,
(4.22)
which gives
Vs =
1
2mv2
max
e
= hν −W
e
.
(4.23)
Thus, we see that the stopping potential is proportional to frequency
and increases with increasing ν, which is in accordance with the
experimental observation.
We may conclude that what we have just shown is an another
example of a remarkable triumph of Planck’s quantum hypothesis.
Einstein’s photoelectric formula (4.20), incorporating the photon
nature of light, correctly explains the properties of the photoelectric
eﬀect discovered by Hertz. It predicts correctly that the photoelec-
tric eﬀect depends on the frequency of the incident light, not upon
its intensity, contrary to what the wave theory suggested.
4.4 Compton Scattering: Quantum Explanation
Another support of Planck’s hypothesis, which gave the most
conclusive conﬁrmation for the corpuscular (photon) aspect of light,
was provided by the Compton scattering eﬀect.
Let us re-examine the Compton scattering experiment, discussed
in Section 2.3, but now we shall assume that the incident X-rays
are composed of particles (photons) that can be scattered from the
electrons as balls. Suppose that the incident photon has momentum
p and energy E = pc. The scattered photon has momentum p′ and
energy E ′ = p′c. The electron is initially at rest, so its energy is
Ee = m0c2, and the initial momentum is zero.
From the energy conservation, we have
E + Ee = E ′ + mc2 ,
(4.24)
where m is the relativistic mass

Compton Scattering
41
m =
m0

1 −(v/c)2 ,
(4.25)
and v is the velocity of the scattered electron.
Since E = pc, E ′ = p′c, and Ee = m0c2, the energy conservation
formula may be written as

pc −p′c + m0c2
= mc2 .
(4.26)
Taking square of both sides of Eq. (4.26), we obtain

pc −p′c + m0c22 = (mc2)2 = (m0c2)2 + (pec)2 ,
(4.27)
where pe is the momentum of the scattered electron. Thus, we can
write

p −p′2 + 2m0c

p −p′
= p2
e .
(4.28)
This energy conservation formula contains the momentum of the
scattered electron. Unfortunately, the momentum of the scattered
electrons is diﬃcult to measure in experiments, as they move
with large velocities. Therefore, we will eliminate pe using the
momentum conservation law:
⃗pe = ⃗p −⃗p′ ,
(4.29)
from which we ﬁnd
p2
e = ⃗pe · ⃗pe = p2 + p′2 −2pp′ cos α ,
(4.30)
where α is the angle between directions of the incident and scattered
photons.
Substituting Eq. (4.30) into Eq. (4.28), we get
2m0c

p −p′
= 2pp′ (1 −cos α) ,
(4.31)
from which, we ﬁnd the momentum diﬀerence
p −p′ = pp′
m0c (1 −cos α) .
(4.32)
This is how far we can get with the analysis of the Compton eﬀect
using arguments of classical physics. To relate this eﬀect to the
wavelength of the radiation, we apply Planck’s hypothesis of the
quantization of energy. In this case, we ﬁnd the following relation
between the momentum and wavelength:
p = E
c = hν
c = h
λ .
(4.33)

42
Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
Using this relation in Eq. (4.32), we ﬁnally obtain
λ′ −λ =
h
m0c (1 −cos α) .
(4.34)
This is the Compton scattering formula.
The quantity h/(m0c) is called the Compton wavelength of a
particle with rest mass m0 (here, an electron)
λc =
h
m0c = 2.426 × 10−12
[m] .
(4.35)
The Compton scattering formula (Eq. 4.34) shows that the change
in wavelength depends only on the scattering angle α. During the
collision, the photon loses a part of its energy and consequently its
wavelength increases. Thus, the quantum theory predicts correctly
that the scattered light has diﬀerent wavelength than the incident
light. The classical (wave) theory predicts that λ′ = λ.
One may notice from the Compton scattering formula (Eq. 4.34)
that the transition from quantum (photon) to classical (wave)
description of the theory is to put h →0. Thus, the Planck constant
distinguishes between quantum and classical, but the presence of
the constant h is not the universal criterion for quantum.
An interesting observation
A signiﬁcant feature of the derivation of the Compton scattering
formula is that it relied essentially on special relativity. Thus, the
Compton eﬀect not only conﬁrms the existence of photons, it also
provides a convincing proof of the validity of special relativity.
Worked Example
A photon collides with a stationary electron.
(a) Show that in the collision the photon cannot transfer all its
energy to the electron.
(b) Show that a photon cannot produce a positron–electron pair.

E f + m0c2 = mc2 =

m2
0c4 + p2ec2 ,
(4.36)
where E f
=
hν is the energy of the photon, and pe is
the momentum of the electron. From the conservation of
momentum, we have
p f = hν
c = pe ,
(4.37)
and substituting Eq. (4.37) into Eq. (4.36), we obtain
hν + m0c2 =

m2
0c4 + (hν)2 ,
(4.38)
which is not true, as the right-hand side is larger than the left-
hand side.
(b) From the conservation of momentum, we have
p f =

m2
0c2 + p2e +

m2
0c2 + p2p ,
(4.39)
where pp is the momentum of the positron.
We see from the above equation that
p f > |⃗pe| + |⃗pp| ≥|⃗pe + ⃗pp| .
(4.40)
Hence
⃗p f > ⃗pe + ⃗pp .
(4.41)
Thus, a photon cannot produce a positron–electron pair.

This formula shows that one can test the Compton eﬀect by
a measurement of the angles α and θ instead of measuring the
wavelength λ′ of the scattered photons, which is diﬃcult to measure
with a large precision in experiments.

Chapter 5
Bohr Model
Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not
understood it.
—Niels Bohr
In 1913, the Danish scientist Niels Bohr used Planck’s concept to
propose a model of the hydrogen atoma that had a spectacular
success in explanation of the discrete atomic spectra.b The model
also correctly predicted the wavelengths of the spectral lines. We
have seen that the atomic spectra exhibit discrete lines unique
to each atom. From this observation, Bohr concluded that atomic
electrons can have only certain discrete energies. That is, the
kinetic and potential energies of electrons are limited to only
discrete particular values, as the energies of photons in a blackbody
radiation.
aThe Bohr model is called “semiclassical” not “quantum” because, as we shall see, it
contains concepts of both classical and quantum physics.

Bohr Model
5.1 Hydrogen Atom
In the formulation of his model, Bohr assumed that the electron
in the hydrogen atom moves under the inﬂuence of the Coulomb
attraction between it and the positively charged nucleus, as
assumed in classical mechanics. However, he incorporated new
ideas. Namely, he postulated that the electron could only move
in certain nonradiating orbits, which he called stationary orbits
(stationary states). Next, he postulated that the atom radiates only
when the electron makes a transition between states.
Let us illustrate Bohr’s ideas in some detail. We begin with
considering the classical equation of motion for the electron in
a circular orbit, which is based on Newton’s laws of motion and
Coulomb’s law of electric force. The electrostatic Coulomb force
provides the centripetal acceleration v2/r that holds the electron in
an orbit r from the nucleus. The condition for orbit stability is
e2
4πε0r2 = me
v2
r .
(5.1)
This relation allows us to calculate kinetic energy of the electron
K = 1
2mev2 =
e2
8πε0r ,
(5.2)
which, together with the potential energy
U = −
e2
4πε0r
(5.3)
gives the total energy of the electron as
E = K + U = −
e2
8πε0r .

From the kinetic energy, we can ﬁnd the velocity of the electron, its
linear momentum, and ﬁnally its angular momentum

Up to this point, the analysis has been classical and as such creates
a problem. The equations (5.4) and (5.5) show that the energy and
angular momentum of the electron depend on the radius of the orbit.
An obvious question arises: How to ﬁnd the radius, since in practice
it is rather impossible to measure r?

5.1.1 Quantization of Angular Momentum
Bohr got the tricky idea to solve this problem. To ﬁnd the radius
of the orbit, Bohr postulated that the angular momentum of the
electron is quantized, i.e., it can only take values that are integer
multiples of ℏ.
Where this idea came from?
It came from the following observation: One can notice from
Planck’s formula E = hν that h has the units of energy multiplied
by time (J·s), or equivalently of momentum multiplied by distance.
The electron in the atom travels a distance 2πr per one turn. Since
the momentum is p = mev, we obtain
(mev)(2πr) = nh ,
(5.6)
which shows that the angular momentum is quantized:
L = nℏ,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
(5.7)
Comparing this quantum relation for the angular momentum with
Eq. (5.5), we can readily ﬁnd the radius of the orbits. Since
mee2r
4πε0
= n2 h2
4π2 ,
(5.8)
we ﬁnd, as a result of the quantization of angular momentum, that
the orbits are quantized:
r = n2 ε0h2
πmee2 = n2ao ,
(5.9)
where
ao =
ε0h2
πmee2 = 5.3 × 10−11 [m]
(5.10)
is called the Bohr radius. It is the radius of the electron’s lowest
energy level and is taken as the length scale in the quantum
description of the hydrogen atom. The result (5.9) is in terms of
known constants and is very diﬀerent from what one could expect
from classical physics. The electron’s orbits cannot have any radius;
only certain radii are allowed. The radius of the electron’s orbit may
be ao, 4ao, 9ao, . . ., but never 2ao or 1.6ao.
By substituting Eq. (5.9) into Eq. (5.4), we ﬁnd that the energy of
the electron is also quantized:
En = −

(5.11)

Bohr Model
The energies speciﬁed by Eq. (5.11) are called the energy levels or
energy states of the hydrogen atom. These levels are all negative,
signifying that the electron does not have enough energy to escape
from the atom. This is the so-called bounding energy. The lowest
energy level n = 1 is called the ground state of the atom and, in
the hydrogen atom, has the energy
E1 = −mee4
8ε2
0h2 = −13.6
[eV] .
(5.12)
This is the energy required to separate a hydrogen atom into a
proton and an electron.
The higher levels n = 2, 3, . . . are called excited states. Note also
that the energy becomes less negative as n increases. At n →∞,
En →0 and there is no binding energy of the electron to the nucleus.
We say the atom is ionized.
5.1.2 Quantum Jumps Hypothesis
How does the electron make transitions between the energy levels?
Bohr introduced another postulate—the hypothesis of quantum
jumps—that the electron jumps (suddenly moves) from one energy
level to another emitting or absorbing radiation of a frequency

where R is the Rydberg constant.
Equation (5.14) states that the radiation emitted by excited
hydrogen atoms should contain certain wavelengths only. The
wavelengths fall into deﬁnite sequences, called spectral series, that
depend upon the quantum number of the ﬁnal energy level. This is
illustrated in Fig. 5.1. Note that the energy levels get closer together
(converge) as the n value increases.
We should point out here that quantum jumps are inconsistent
with any classical picture of radiation and are often regarded as a
quantum eﬀect without classical analog.

Franck–Hertz Experiment

Energy-level diagram for hydrogen atom with possible electron
transitions.
In summary, the Bohr model was very successful in explaining
the discrete atomic spectra of one-electron (hydrogen-like) atoms.
Simply, discrete spectral lines are observed because in order for an
electron to move from one state to another, it must either absorb or
emit exactly the right amount of energy to jump. This puts the model
among the most spectacular achievements in physics.a
5.2 Franck–Hertz Experiment
The Bohr model is, of course, a theoretical model of an atom.
It predicts that the electron in the atom can have only certain
discretely separated energy levels. At this point, we may ask a
question: Do in reality the quantized energy levels really exist? The
observation of the discrete atomic spectra is one of the evidences
of discretely separated energy levels. However, atomic spectra
are not the only means of investigating the presence of discrete
energy levels.
In 1914, shortly after the Bohr model was introduced, James
Franck and Gustav Hertz performed a series of experiments that
provided a direct demonstration that atomic energy levels do indeed
aBohr was granted the Nobel Prize in 1922 for investigating the structure of atoms
and of the radiation emanating from them.

exist. In the experiments, electrons emitted by a heated cathode
were accelerated by a potential V applied between the cathode and
anode plate placed in a tube ﬁlled with a vapor of Hg atoms.
The measurements involved measuring the anode current as a
function of the voltage V . The results of the experiment for the
tube containing mercury (Hg) vapor are shown in Fig. 5.2. As the
accelerating potential is increased, the anode current is increased
as more electrons arrive at the anode plate. It indicates that the
presence of the mercury atoms does not aﬀect the motion of the
electrons and that no energy is transferred from the electrons to
the atoms. However, when V reaches 4.9 V, the current abruptly
drops. This can be interpreted that some interaction between the
electrons and the Hg atoms suddenly begins when the electrons
attain a kinetic energy 4.9 eV. Additional drops of the current are
observed at integer multiplies of 4.9 eV.
To understand why the anode current drastically drops at integer
multiplies of 4.9 eV, Franck and Hertz,a in addition to the current,
observed the emission (ﬂuorescence) spectrum of the Hg vapor.
They observed that the wavelength of the emitted radiation was
2536 ˚A, which for the Hg atoms corresponds exactly to a photon
energy of 4.9 eV. Thus, in a single collision between the electrons

laws governing the impact of an electron on an atom.

and the atoms, the energy of 4.9 eV is transferred from the electrons
to the atoms. The current drops at 9.8 eV, 14.7 eV, etc. correspond to
multiple, two, three, etc., collisions, respectively.
To summarize, the Franck–Hertz experiment provided a proof
that atomic energy states are quantized. It also provided a method
for the direct measurement of the energy diﬀerence between the
quantum energy states of an atom.
5.3 X-Rays Characteristic Spectra
In the study of X-rays characteristic spectra, we observed that the
spectra were composed of two distinctive lines (see Fig. 2.1) whose
origin was not accountable in terms of classical electromagnetic
theory.
In 1913, Henry Moseley studied X-rays characteristic spectra in
detail, and he showed how the X-ray spectra can be understood
in terms of the quantum theory of radiation and on the basis
of the discrete energy levels of atoms in the anode material. His
analysis was based on the Bohr model, and the explanation was as
follows:
In a multi-electron atom, the fast and energetic electrons from
the cathode knock electrons of the anode atoms out of their inner
orbits, as shown in Fig. 5.3. Then, the outer electrons jump to these

empty places emitting X-ray (short-wavelength) photons of discrete
frequencies.
It is interesting to note that generation of X-rays is often called the
inverse photoelectric eﬀect. Energy of moving electrons is converted
into photons.
5.4 Difficulties of Bohr Model
Bohr was able to predict the stationary properties of the hydrogen-
like atom, i.e., the energy levels with great accuracy, but the dynamics
had to be introduced artiﬁcially, by introducing the concept of
quantum (sudden) jumps between the energy states. This ad hoc
assumption, which has no counterpart in classical physics, caused a
vivid controversy in quantum physics. In addition, there were many
objections to the Bohr theory, and to complete our discussion of this
theory, we indicate some of its undesirable aspects:
• The model contains both the classical (orbital) and quantum
(jumps) concepts of motion.
• The model was applied with a mixed success to the structure
of atoms more complex than hydrogen.
• Classical physics does not predict the circular Bohr orbits
to be stable. An electron in a circular orbit is accelerating
toward the center and, according to classical electrodynamic
theory, should gradually lose energy by radiation and spiral
into the nucleus.
• The model does not tell us how to calculate the intensities of
the spectral lines.
• If the electron can have only particular energies, what
happens to the energy when the electron jumps from one
orbit to another?
• How the electron knows that it can jump only if the energy
supplied is equal to Em −En?
• The model does not explain how atoms can form diﬀerent
molecules.
• Experiments showed that some of the lines in atomic spectra
are not singlets but are composed of two or more closely

Difficulties of Bohr Model
53
spaced lines. The lines can be resolved by applying a
magnetic ﬁeld (Zeeman eﬀect), the feature not presented in
the Bohr model.
We see that some of these objections are really of a very fundamental
nature, and much eﬀort was expended in attempts to develop a
quantum theory that would be free of these objections. As we will
see later, the eﬀort was well rewarded and led to what we now know
as quantum wave mechanics. Nevertheless, the Bohr theory is still
frequently employed as the ﬁrst approximation to the more accurate
description of quantum eﬀects. In addition, the Bohr theory is often
helpful in visualizing processes that are diﬃcult to visualize in terms
of the rather abstract language of the quantum wave mechanics,
which will be presented in details in next few chapters.
Tutorial Problems
Problem 5.1 We usually visualize electrons and protons as spinning
balls. Is it a true model? To answer this question, consider the
following example.
Suppose that the electron is represented by a spinning ball.
Using Bohr’s quantization postulate, ﬁnd the linear velocity of the
electron’s sphere. Assume that the radius of the electron is in the
order of the radius of a nucleus, r
≈
10−15 m (1 fm). What
would you say about the validity of the spinning ball model of the
electron?
Problem 5.2 How big is an electron?
Suppose that the electron is a spherical shell of radius re and all the
electron’s charge is evenly distributed on the shell. Using the formula
for the energy of a charged shell, calculate the classical electron
radius. Compare the size of the electron with the size of an atomic
nucleus.
This problem illustrates the discrepancy between the experi-
mentally observed size of the electron and that calculated from the
classical electromagnetic theory.

54
Bohr Model
Problem 5.3 Just for fun with Maxwell’s equations. A spatial
distribution of charges creates the radial electric ﬁeld of the form
⃗E(r) = Ae−br
r2
ˆr ,
where A and b are real and positive constants and ˆr is the unit vector
in the radial direction.
Using the Maxwell equation (1.1), calculate the density of the
charge and show that the ﬁeld is produced by a positive charge
located at the origin, r = 0, and a negative charge continuously
distributed in space. Then, show that the total charge is zero.
This problem illustrates Rutherford’s (classical) model of an
atom, used before the Bohr model was introduced. The positive
charge at the origin represents the charge of the nucleus and the
negative charge symmetrically distributed in space represents the
cloud of electrons.
Problem 5.4 The Bohr model for a hydrogen-like atom
Show that in the Bohr atom model, the electron’s orbits in a
hydrogen-like atom are quantized with the radius r
= n2ao/Z,
where ao = 4πε0ℏ2/me2 is the Bohr radius, n = 1, 2, . . ., and Z is
atomic number. Z = 1 refers to a hydrogen atom, Z = 2 to a Helium
He+ ion, and so on.
Problem 5.5 Magnetic dipole moment of an electron
The magnetic dipole moment ⃗μ of a current loop is deﬁned by ⃗μ =
I ⃗S, where I is the current and ⃗S = S⃗u is the area of the loop, with ⃗u—
the unit vector normal to the plane of the loop. A current loop may
be represented by a charge e rotating at constant speed in a circular
orbit. Use the classical model of the orbital motion of the electron
and Bohr’s quantization postulate to show that the magnetic dipole
moment of the loop is quantized such that
μ = n mB ,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
where mB = eℏ/2me is the Bohr magneton and me is the mass of the
electron.
Problem 5.6 Why we do not see single photons?
Consider an experiment. A student is at a distance 10 m from a light
source whose power P = 40 W.

Difficulties of Bohr Model
55
(a) How many photons strike the student’s eye if the wavelength of
the light is 589 nm (yellow light) and the radius of the pupil (a
variable aperture through which light enters the eye) is 2 mm.
(b) At what distance from the source only one photon would strike
the student’s eye?
Problem 5.7 Stern–Gerlach experiment: Evidence of the quantized
angular momentum (spin) of an electron
(a) Illustrate and explain in a simple way the Stern–Gerlach
experiment.
(b) Explain, using some algebra, why in the Stern–Gerlach experi-
ment the silver atomic beam after passing the magnetic ﬁeld is
not continuously spread, but is split into only two components?
Challenging Problem: Collapse of the classical atom
The classical atom has a stability problem. Let us model the
hydrogen atom as a non-relativistic electron in a classical circular
orbit about a proton. From the electromagnetic theory, we know that
a deaccelerating charge radiates energy. The power radiated during
the deacceleration is given by the Larmor formula (2.3).
(a) Show that the energy lost per cycle is small compared to the
electron’s kinetic energy. Hence, it is an excellent approximation
to regard the orbit as circular at any instant, even though the
electron eventually spirals into the proton.
(b) How long does it take for the initial radius of r0 = 1 ˚A to
be reduced to zero? Insert appropriate numerical values for all
quantities and estimate the (classical) lifetime of the hydrogen
atom.

Duality of Light and Matter
If all this damned quantum jumps were really to stay, I should be
sorry I ever got involved with quantum theory.
—Erwin Schr¨odinger
We have already encountered several aspects of quantum physics,
but in all the discussions so far, we have always assumed that a
particle, a photon in particular, is a small solid object. However,
quantum physics as it developed in the three decades after Planck’s
discovery, found a need for an uncomfortable fusion of the discrete
and the continuous. This applies not only to light but also to
particles. Arguments about particles or waves gave way to a
recognized need for both particles and waves in the description
of radiation. Thus, we will see that our modern view of the “true
nature” of radiation and matter is that they have a dual character,
behaving like a wave under some circumstances and like a particle
under other, but never both simultaneously.
In the last few chapters, we discussed the wave and particle
properties of light, and with our current knowledge of the radiation
theory, we can recognize the following wave and particle aspects of

The fact that the same light beam can behave like a wave and a
particle raises tricky questions.
How can light be a wave and a particle at the same moment?
Is a photon a particle or a wave?
Evidently, we are left with an obvious question: Which theory are
we to believe?
If we accept the duality of light, then another obvious question
arises: Is this dual character a property of light alone or of all
structures in the universe, in particular material particles?
Following this, one may ask: Is an electron really a material
particle or is it a wave?
We have to say that there is no deﬁnite answer to these questions.
We can get a satisfactory answer to these questions, but we must
enter the strange and often deceiving world of quantum wave
physics.
6.1 Matter Waves
The confusion over particle versus wave properties was resolved by
Louis de Broglie. On the basis of the observations that
• Nature is strikingly symmetrical and
• Our universe is composed entirely of light and matter,
he postulated that since light has a dual wave–particle nature, matter
also has this nature.
The dual nature of light shows up in equations
λ = h
p ,
E = hν .
(6.1)
Each equation contains within its structure both a wave concept
(λ, ν), and a particle (p, E). According to this observation, a particle

Matter Waves
59
with energy E and momentum p should have the possibility to
manifest itself as a wave.
The photon also has an energy given by the relationship from the
relativity theory
E = mc2 .
(6.2)
Since E = hν = hc/λ, we ﬁnd the wavelength
λ = h
mc = h
p ,
(6.3)
where p is the momentum of the photon.
This does not mean that light has mass, but because mass and
energy can be interconverted, it has an energy that is equivalent to
some mass.
De Broglie postulated that a particle can have a wave character
and predicted that the wavelength of a matter wave would also be
given by the same equation that held for light, where now p would
be the momentum of the particlea
λ = h
mv = h
p ,
(6.4)
where v is the velocity of the particle, and λ is called the de Broglie
wavelength.
Remember this formula! It is the fundamental matter–wave
postulate and will appear very often in our journey through the
developments of quantum physics.
If particles may behave as waves, could we ever observe the
matter waves?
The idea was to perform a diﬀraction experiment with electrons.
But an obvious question was: How to perform such an experiment?
What wavelengths can we expect? To answer these questions and
gain some appreciation of the de Broglie wavelength, consider ﬁrst
a simple example.
aWave character of particles is often interpreted that particles itself are waves. It is a
wrong interpretation! Quantum physics predicts that particles can behave as waves,
and it does not mean that they are waves in nature.

60
Duality of Light and Matter
Example: What is the de Broglie wavelength of an electron whose
kinetic energy is K = 100 eV?
We ﬁrst calculate the velocity of the electron from which we then
ﬁnd the de Broglie wavelength corresponding to that velocity.
Thus, the velocity of the electron of energy 100 eV is
v =

2K
me
= 5.9 × 103
[km/s] .
Hence, the de Broglie wavelength corresponding to this velocity is
λ = h
p =
h
mev = 1.2
[ ˚A] .
The wavelength is very short; it is about the size of a typical atom.
The aforementioned example shows that the wavelength is very
short. Thus, an obvious question arises: How to detect such short
wavelengths?
We may notice from the aforementioned example that the
wavelength is also of the same order as the wavelengths of X-rays.
Therefore, we immediately conclude that the matter waves can be
detected in the same way that the wave nature of X-rays was ﬁrst
observed: diﬀraction of particles on crystals.
This idea was tested experimentally in 1926 by Clinton Davisson
and Lester Germer,a and independently by George Thompson,b who
performed electron-scattering experiments. They observed that
electrons, after passing through a large nickel crystal (d = 2.15 ˚A),
produced an interference pattern. Using the experimental data, they
found that the wavelength calculated from the diﬀraction relation
nλ = 2d sin θn ,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(6.5)
was in excellent agreement with the wavelength calculated from the
de Broglie relation λ = h/p.
An interference pattern was demonstrated not only with elec-
trons, but also with many kinds of material particles like protons
and neutrons. However, any attempt to observe an interference
aIn fact, Davisson and Germer had done some of these experiments even before de
Broglie’s matter wave postulate was established, but they could not interpret their
results.

experimental discovery of the diﬀraction of electrons by crystals.

pattern with neutral atoms was found diﬃcult by the fact that atoms
carried no charge as electrons do and could not penetrate through
condensate matter like neutrons.
This problem has not been solved until recently, when rapidly
developing laser techniques enabled to create two slits separated by
a very small distance. In addition, laser cooling of atoms has enabled
to increase the de Broglie wavelength of an atom, thereby allowing to
observe interference eﬀects in Young’s double-slit type experiment
with atoms traveling along well-separated paths.
In 1991, Carnal and Mlynek demonstrated that atoms emerging
from the same source and split by two slits produced an interference
pattern at the atomic detector. The source of the atoms in their
experiment was a thermal beam of metastable helium atoms. The
velocity of the atoms was adjusted by setting the temperature of the
source to T = 295 K, corresponding to a mean de Broglie wavelength
of λ = 0.56 ˚A, or to T = 83 K, corresponding to λ = 1.03 ˚A. The
atoms traveled through two slits, burned with a laser beam in a
thin gold foil, and separated by 8 μm. The interference pattern was
monitored by a detection system consisting of a secondary electron
multiplier. The interference pattern of the detected atoms is shown
in Fig. 6.1.
Figure 6.1

experiment with two diﬀerent de Broglie wavelengths (a) λ = 0.56 ˚A and

62
Duality of Light and Matter
In summary of this section, we may conclude that for matter as
well as for light, we must face up to the existence of a dual character:
Matter behaves in some circumstances like a particle and in others
like a wave.
What does it mean by “some circumstances”? One can say that
this is a rather confusing statement. It means that the two models
(particle and wave) complement each other.
6.2 Matter Wave Interpretation of Bohr’s Model
De Broglie’s wave–particle theory oﬀered a much more satisfactory
interpretation of the Bohr atom: Bohr’s condition for angular
momentum of the electron in a hydrogen atom is equivalent to a
standing wave condition. The quantization of angular momentum
L = nℏmeans that
mvr = nℏ
or
mv = nh
2πr .
(6.6)
However, if we employ de Broglie’s postulate that the electron
behaves as a wave, not as a particle
p = mv = h
λ ,
(6.7)
and combine Eqs. (6.6) and (6.7), we ﬁnd
nλ = 2πr ,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
(6.8)
Thus, if one tries to represent the length in terms of wavelengths, the
length of Bohr’s allowed orbits (2πr) exactly equals to an integer
multiple of the electron wavelength (nλ), as illustrated in Fig. 6.2.
Hence, Bohr’s quantum condition is equivalent to saying that an
integer number of electron waves must ﬁt into the circumference of
a circular orbit.
The de Broglie wavelength of an electron in the smallest orbit
turns out to be exactly equal to the circumference of the orbit
predicted by Bohr. Similarly, the second and third orbits are found

to contain two and three de Broglie wavelengths, respectively. From
this picture, it now becomes clear why only certain orbits are
allowed.
Note that de Broglie arrived to this conclusion from the
fundamental matter–wave postulate, whereas Bohr assumed this
property.
We can summarize that according to quantum wave mechanics:
(1) The electron motion in an atom is represented by standing
waves.
(2) Since only certain wavelengths can now exist, the electron’s
energy can take on only certain discrete values.
Tutorial Problems
Problem 6.1 If, as de Broglie says, a wavelength can be associated
with every moving particle, then why are we not forcibly made aware
of this property in our everyday experience? In answering, calculate
the de Broglie wavelength of each of the following “particles”:
(a) A car of mass 2000 kg traveling at a speed of 120 km/h.
(b) A marble of mass 10 g moving with a speed of 10 cm/s.
(c) A smoke particle of diameter 10−5 cm (and a density of,
say, 2 g/cm3) being jostled about by air molecules at room
temperature (27◦C = 300 K). Assume that the particle has the

the ground state, n = 1, is equal to 2πao, where ao is the Bohr radius.
6.3 Definition of Wave Function
The idea that the electron’s orbits in atoms correspond to standing
matter waves was taken by Erwin Schr¨odinger in 1926 to formulate
quantum wave mechanics. He introduced the idea of wave function
(⃗r, t) as the basic quantity in quantum wave mechanics. According
to this idea, the wave function measures the wave disturbance of
matter waves associated with a given system at time t and at a
point ⃗r.
But what exactly is this “wave function” and what is its physical
meaning?
Before we explain the physical meaning of the wave function,
consider a simple but important example in which we will determine
what types of wave functions represent a physical system, and what
are the physical consequences of choosing this particular form.
Suppose we have a free particle of mass m conﬁned between two
walls separated by a distance a. The motion of the particle along the
x-axis may be represented by a harmonic wave
(x, t) = max sin(kx) sin(ωt + φ) ,
(6.9)
where ω = 2πν and k = 2π/λ.
However, only standing waves will exist for all times, and other
waves will destructively interfere and disappear after some time t.
Therefore, only standing waves can represent the particle conﬁned
between the walls. The condition required for a standing wave is
a = nλ
2 ,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
(6.10)

Definition of Wave Function
65
from which we ﬁnd that
k = 2π
λ = nπ
a .
(6.11)
Hence, the wave function takes the form
n(x, t) = max sin
nπ
a x

sin(ωt + φ) ,
(6.12)
where the subscript n has been introduced to indicate that the
particle is determined by an inﬁnite number of separate wave
functions.
Physically, all that Eq. (6.12) says is that a particle in a box
is represented by a set of separate standing waves of diﬀerent
amplitudes. It means that the motion of the particle is quantized and
is represented by an inﬁnite (discrete) number of wave functions
determined by diﬀerent n. However, this is not the whole story.
As a consequence of the quantization of the amplitude, the linear
momentum is also quantized. Since
λ = 2a
n ,
(6.13)
we can replace λ by h/p and obtain
p = n h
2a .
(6.14)
The momentum is related to the energy E, which gives
E = 1
2
p2
m = n2
h2
8ma2 ≡En .
(6.15)
This indicates that the energy of the particle is also quantized. Thus,
a particle conﬁned between two walls cannot have any energy.
In summary, the main consequence of quantum conﬁnement is
that the particle is represented by a set of separate wave functions.
In addition, the continuous energy spectrum of the particle in
free space (unlimited space corresponding to a →∞) is radically
modiﬁed and replaced by a discrete energy spectrum. The energy
levels depend on the distance a and can be modiﬁed by appropriate
choice of the value a.

6.4 Physical Meaning of Wave Function
The aforementioned theoretical analysis and diﬀraction experi-
ments with particles deﬁnitely convinced us that a particle can
behave like a wave. Remember, the particle itself is not a wave, but it
behaves like a wave. If you say that the particle is a wave, then one
may object to this interpretation and may say that it is problematic.
Namely, a particle has mass and some of them have electric charge.
Does this mean that the mass and charge of an electron, for example,
are spread out over the extent of the wave? This would be crazy.
It would mean that if we isolate just a part of the wave, we would
obtain a fraction of an electron charge.
How then should we interpret an electron wave?
The answer is that the wave itself does not have any substance.
It is a probability wave. When we talk about a particle wave, the
amplitude of the wave at a particular point tells us the probability of
ﬁnding the particle at that point.
We may recognize the close analogy between the wave function
and, for example, the electric ﬁeld amplitude. The wave function of a
particle describes the probability distribution of a particle in space,
just as the wave function of an electromagnetic ﬁeld describes the
distribution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in space.
In fact, the idea of the probabilistic interpretation of the physical
phenomena, introduced by Born, Heisenberg, and Schr¨odinger, came
from the probabilistic nature of the interference and diﬀraction
eﬀects. Simply, it is observed in diﬀraction experiments that the
particles randomly distribute to form the diﬀraction pattern on the
screen.
In addition, we know from the interference and diﬀraction in-
volving an electromagnetic ﬁeld that the intensity of the interference
fringes is proportional to the square of the ﬁeld amplitude, or
alternatively to the probability that the waves interfere positively or
negatively at some points.
In analogy to this theory of interference, Max Born suggesteda
that the quantity |(⃗r, t)|2 = ∗(⃗r, t)(⃗r, t) is a measure of the

mechanics, especially for his statistical interpretation of the wave function.

probability density that the particle will be found at time t near the
point ⃗r. More precisely, the quantity |(⃗r, t)|2dV is the probability
that the particle will be found within a volume dV around the point
⃗r at which |(⃗r, t)|2 is evaluated.a
Since |(⃗r, t)|2dV is interpreted as the probability, it is normal-
ized to one as

V
|(⃗r, t)|2dV = 1 .
(6.16)
The probabilistic formulation of quantum physics makes it
completely diﬀerent from classical physics. In classical physics,
everything appears to have a deﬁnite position, a deﬁnite momentum,
and a deﬁnite time of occurrence. The trajectory of a particle and
the future behavior may be predicted with absolute certainty using
Newton’s laws. In other words, in Newtonian mechanics everything
is predictable.
Let us consider two examples that illustrate diﬀerences between
the classical and quantum behavior of a particle.
Example 1: Classical behavior of a particle
Suppose there is a force ⃗F , which might be associated with a
potential energy of a particle, acting on the particle initially at t = t0
located at a point ⃗r0. The particle is moving with an initial velocity
⃗v0.
Using Newton’s second law
⃗F = d⃗p
dt = md2⃗r
dt2 ,
(6.17)
we ﬁnd with absolute certainty the particle’s locality ⃗r(t) and
velocity ⃗v(t) at any future time.
Moreover, we may predict the trajectory of the particle’s motion.
Let
⃗F = m⃗g .
(6.18)
Then
m⃗g = md⃗v
dt ,
(6.19)
aThe wave function  is complex, but the product ∗is always real and a positive
quantity. The function ∗is the complex conjugate of  and is obtained from  by
replacing the complex parameter i by −i whenever it appears in the function.

68
Duality of Light and Matter
from which we ﬁnd
⃗v(t) = ⃗v0 + ⃗gt ,
(6.20)
and
⃗r(t) = ⃗r0 + ⃗v0t + 1
2 ⃗gt2 .
(6.21)
Thus, if we know ⃗r0 and ⃗v0 at time t = t0, we may predict the precise
position ⃗r(t) and velocity ⃗v(t) of the particle at all future times t > t0.
Example 2: Quantum behavior of a particle
Let us consider now the motion of the particle from the point of view
of quantum physics, in which behavior of the particle is described by
a wave function.
Consider the wave function at time t = 0 of a free particle conﬁned
between two walls (Eq. (6.12)). In this case, the probability density
of ﬁnding the particle at a point x between the walls is given by
|(x, 0)|2 = |max|2 sin2 nπ
a x

.
(6.22)
This formula shows that the probability of ﬁnding the particle at the
point x is diﬀerent from 1 (certain) and varies with the position x
and the distance between the walls.
Thus, according to quantum physics, we are not able to predict
with absolute certainty the initial t = t0 position of the particle
between the walls. Hence, we will not be able to predict with
absolute certainty the trajectory of the particle, position ⃗r(t), and
velocity ⃗v(t) at any future time t > t0.
The dependence of the probability density on the position x
between the walls for two diﬀerent values of n is shown in Fig. 6.3. It
is seen that for n = 1, the particle is more likely to be found near the
center than the ends. For n = 2, the particle is most likely to be found
at x = a/4, x = 3a/4, and the probability of ﬁnding the particle at
the center is zero. The strong dependence of the probability on x is
in contrast to the predictions of classical physics, where the particle
has the same probability of being anywhere between the walls.
Such a behavior of the particle is another example of quantum
eﬀect without classical analog.

these quantum ideas. It could be expected, as these quantum ideas

are not easy to grasp as they seem to contradict our intuitive
understanding of the physical world.a It often leads people to
question the physical models developed in physics. The probabilistic
(statistical) nature of quantum physics is in itself a psychological
barrier for many people. Even Einstein was inﬂexibly opposed to this
statistical interpretation, which “leaves so much to chance.” He never
accepted these views and on some occasions dismissed them rather
harshly:
I cannot believe that God plays dice with the cosmos.
—Albert Einstein
According to Einstein, quantum mechanics is an incomplete
theory, fails to provide a complete description of physical reality,
and that there exist certain hidden variables that, if known, would
remove the necessity of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum
mechanics.b
aIf any reader knows why a particle conﬁned between two walls behaves in such an
unusual way, please write to us. We would like to know it, too.
bThis problem is known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox and is the
most famous and powerful attack on the quantum wave mechanics. The detailed
discussion of the paradox requires the knowledge of the advance quantum physics.

on the EPR paradox is referred to a recent review article by A. Zeilinger, Experiments

Duality of Light and Matter
Remember that the wave function of a particle does not tell us
what the particle is, how it looks like, and what is its structure.
The wave function (⃗r, t) tells us about properties of the particle
and how the particle behaves in space and time. Moreover, the wave
function (⃗r, t) is a mathematical construct only. It is a probability
wave, which does not have any physical meaning.
Only |(⃗r, t)|2
= ∗(⃗r, t)(⃗r, t) has physical meaning—
probability density—and |(⃗r, t)|2dV is the probability of ﬁnding
the particle at time t in the volume dV around the point ⃗r.
An interesting comment of a former student
“If only |(⃗r, t)|2dV has physical meaning, why don’t we use this
probability rather than (⃗r, t)? Wouldn’t it be simpler in quantum
mechanics to use only the probability and forget about the wave
function?”
We shall see in the next chapter that the answer to this question
lies in the interference experiments, which show that the wave
function itself plays an important role in the interpretation of many
phenomena in quantum physics. Brieﬂy, (⃗r, t) describes the wave
nature of a particle, and |(⃗r, t)|2dV describes where we might ﬁnd
the particle.

6.5 Phase and Group Velocities of Matter Waves
We have already learned that light has a dual character, and after de
Broglie and the interference experiments with particles, we believe
that matter also has dual character. A particular consequence of this
is that a particle conﬁned between two walls and treated as a matter
wave cannot have any energy. We remember from a previous chapter
that the radiation in a box exhibits a similar property, which led
Planck to introduce the concept of quantization of energy. In this

72
Duality of Light and Matter
chapter, we continue our study of the duality problem and turn our
attention to the following question: What is the velocity with which
the probability moves in space and time? To answer this question,
we shall introduce the concept of phase and group velocities and
will examine the variation of the velocity of matter waves with
frequency of these waves. In the wave mechanics, this eﬀect is called
the dispersion.
We have seen that the radiation and matter contain within their
structures both wave and particle concepts.
Waves concept
λ = h
p = h
mv ,
(6.23)
where v is the velocity of a particle of the mass m.
Particles concept
E = mc2 = hν .
(6.24)
Hence, if we accept that there is an analogy between the matter
waves and radiation, we shall ﬁnd that the velocity of the matter
waves is
u = λν = h
mv
mc2
h
= c2
v .
(6.25)
Since, v < c, we see that the velocity of the matter waves is always
greater than the speed of light in vacuum, i.e., u > c. Thus, u and v
are never equal for a moving particle.
This result seems disturbing because it appears that the matter
waves, if treated as an analog of radiation, would propagate faster
than the speed of light in vacuum and would not be able to keep up
with particles whose motion they govern.
However, the velocity u is a phase velocity of the matter waves,
which is the velocity of the wave front, not its amplitude. The
maximum of the amplitude of a given wave can propagate at
diﬀerent velocities, called group velocity. At this velocity, the energy
(information) is transmitted. Usually, vg = u, but in the case of
dispersion, u(ν), the group velocity vg < u. Thus, the matter wave
should be dispersive to match the requirement of vg < u when u > c.

Phase and Group Velocities of Matter Waves
73
Thus, an obvious question arises from the foregoing: Are the
matter waves dispersive?
Let us answer this by ﬁrst deﬁning the phase and group
velocities.
In order to introduce the concept of group velocity and to
show that matter waves are dispersive, we have to assume that a
matter wave is composed at least of two harmonic waves of slightly
diﬀerent k and ω. We shall explain it later in the book why we have
to assume that a matter wave is composed of a group of harmonic
waves.
Suppose we have two harmonic waves of slightly diﬀerent k and
ω and propagating in the same direction. Let
k1 = k0 + k ,
ω1 = ω0 + ω ,
k2 = k0 −k ,
ω2 = ω0 −ω ,
(6.26)
The resulting wave is obtained by taking a linear superposition of
the two waves
(⃗r, t) = 1
2ei(⃗k1·⃗r−ω1t) + 1
2ei(⃗k2·⃗r−ω2t) .
(6.27)
Then, using Eq. (6.26) and Euler’s formula (e±ix = cos x ± i sin x),
we obtain
(⃗r, t) = 1
2ei[(k0+k)⃗κ·⃗r−(ω0+ω)t] + 1
2ei[(k0−k)⃗κ·⃗r−(ω0−ω)t]
= ei(k0⃗κ·⃗r−ω0t) cos (k⃗κ · ⃗r −ωt) ,
(6.28)
where ⃗κ · ⃗r is the distance the wave propagated, and ⃗κ is the unit
vector in the ⃗k direction.
We see from Eq. (6.28) that in time t, the fast varying function
propagates a distance
⃗κ · ⃗r = ω0
k0
t = ut ,
(6.29)
whereas the envelope propagates a distance
⃗κ · ⃗r = ω
k t = dω
dk t = vgt .
(6.30)
Hence, the envelope propagates at velocity vg = dω/dk, which is
called the group velocity.

74
Duality of Light and Matter
We see from Eq. (6.28) that the probability density |(⃗r, t)|2 is
independent of the phase velocity; it depends only on the group
velocity
|(⃗r, t)|2 = cos2 k

⃗κ · ⃗r −vgt

.
(6.31)
Thus, the probability moves with the group velocity.
The envelope forms a so-called wave packet and, as we have
already seen, the amplitude of the wave packet propagates with
velocity vg.
We are now at the position to answer the main question of
whether matter waves are dispersive or not. To check this, consider
the energy of a particle as
E = 1
2m p2 = ℏ2
2mk2 .
(6.32)
If the energy of the particle is quantized, E = ℏω, and then
ℏdω = ℏ2
2m2kdk ,
(6.33)
from which we ﬁnd that
vg = dω
dk = ℏk
m ̸= u .
(6.34)
Hence, if E = ℏω, then the matter waves are dispersive.
When vg < u, we say that the matter waves exhibit normal
dispersion, whereas vg > u is regarded as anomalous dispersion.
When vg = u, there is no dispersion.
Let us consider two examples that illustrate some of the concepts
just introduced.
Worked Example
What is the group velocity of the wave packet associated with a
particle moving with velocity v?
Solution
From the deﬁnition of group velocity, we have
vg = dω
dk = 2π dν
dk = 2π d(hν)
d(hk) = dE
dp ,
(6.35)

Phase and Group Velocities of Matter Waves

where p = ℏk. However,
E 2 = m2
0c4 + p2c2 .
(6.36)
Thus,
2EdE = 2pc2dp .
(6.37)
from which we ﬁnd that
dE
dp = pc2
E
= mvc2
mc2 = v .
(6.38)
Hence, vg = v, the group velocity is equal to the velocity of the
particle. In other words, the velocity of the particle is equal to the
group velocity of the corresponding wave packet.

k =

(6.41)

76
Duality of Light and Matter
Thus, the group velocity is less than c (vg < c) as it must be
since, according to the theory of relativity, energy or a signal
cannot be propagated with a velocity exceeding c.
In addition, the product
uvg = c2k
ωk
ωk
k = c2
(6.42)
is constant and independent of k. Thus, relativity is still all right.
(b) We see from (a) that in general for dispersive waves for which
u > c, the group velocity vg < c. Only when u = c, the group
velocity
vg = c.
To summarize, we have learned that
(1) Matter waves are dispersive.
(2) The matter wave associated with a particle is in the form of a
wave packet.
(3) The amplitude of a matter wave (wave packet) moves with the
group velocity.
(4) The group velocity of the matter wave associated with a moving
particle travels with the same velocity as the particle.
In the next step of our eﬀorts to understand the fundamentals of
quantum physics, we will explain why in quantum physics a localized
particle is represented by a superposition of wave functions (wave
packet) rather than a single harmonic wave function. Important
steps on the way to understand the concept of wave packets are the
uncertainty principle between the position and momentum of the
particle, and the superposition principle.

6.6 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
In quantum physics, we usually work with the wave function ,
whose ||2dV describes a probability that a given object, e.g., a
particle conﬁned to a volume dV , is moving with a velocity v0.
A probability diﬀerent from 1 (certain) means that we are not
precisely sure that the velocity of the particle is v0. We may say
that the velocity is v0 with some error v0, which is called standard
deviation or variance or simply uncertainty.
The same argument applies to a measurement of position of the
particle. In fact, it applies to the measurement of any quantity in
physics. Measurements of some quantities are independent of each
other, but some are related (correlated), i.e., a measurement of one
of the quantities aﬀects the measurement of the other. We call this
relation the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
The uncertainty principle can be derived in a variety of
ways. It applies in both classical and quantum physics. Let us
obtain it by considering a typical diﬀraction experiment shown in
Fig. 6.4.

interference pattern on the observation screen.
The position of the ﬁrst (n = 1) minimum in the diﬀraction
pattern is given by the diﬀraction formula
sin θ = λ
y .
(6.43)
In order to reach the point A, the particle initially moving in the
x-direction has to gain a velocity in the y-direction, such that
sin θ = vy
v0
,
(6.44)
where vy is a change (gain) of the velocity of the particle in the
y-direction.
By comparing Eqs. (6.43) and (6.44), we ﬁnd that
vy
v0
= λ
y ,
(6.45)
which we may write as
vyy = v0λ .
(6.46)
This relation is often called the classical uncertainty relation. The
uncertainty is limited by the wavelength λ and can be changed by
changing λ.
When we apply the de Broglie postulate
λ = h
p =
h
mv0
,
(6.47)

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
79
we ﬁnd that the relation (6.46) takes the form
pyy = h ,
(6.48)
where py = mvy is the uncertainty in the momentum of the
particle.a
This is the quantum uncertainty relation. The precision of
measurement of a given quantity is independent of any experimental
parameter. It is limited by the Planck constant h.
The relation (6.48) is one form of the uncertainty principle
ﬁrst obtained by Werner Heisenbergb in 1927. It states that it is
impossible to measure the momentum py and position y of a particle
simultaneously with the same precision. If we know more about one
of the two quantities, the less we know about the other. For example,
if the particle is completely unlocalized, y →∞, the momentum
is certain, py →0, and vice versa; if the momentum is completely
random, py →∞, the position is certain, y →0. Two physical
(measurable) quantities related through the uncertainty principle
are called complementary observables.
An aside: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle has created a
long debate on the validity of quantum physics. Most scientists
interpret physical phenomena as events taking place “out there,”
independent of any measurement or observation. At the same time,
quantum theory stands in conﬂict with such naive notions of reality.
As we have already learned, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
sets a limit on the precision with which two complementary
observables can be measured. For example, a measurement of
momentum of a particle disturbs the position of the particle.
To many people, this is an unsatisfactory feature of quantum
physics. The most notable objector, of course, was Einstein, whose
concern about the uncertainty principle is expressed in his famous
statement:
aThe arguments used in the derivation of Eq. (6.48) are somewhat rough. A more
concrete treatment, which will be presented in Section 10.6, results in the following
inequality, called the Heisenberg inequality
pyy ≥h/4π .
Note that the relation (6.48) satisﬁes the Heisenberg inequality as h > h/4π.
bHeisenberg was granted the Nobel Prize in 1932 for the creation of quantum
mechanics.

Duality of Light and Matter
Is the state of the Universe disturbed if a mouse looks at it?.
In summary, remember that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is
not a statement about the inaccuracy of measurement instruments,
nor a reﬂection on the quality of experimental methods. It arises
from the wave properties inherent in the quantum mechanical
description of nature. Even with perfect instruments and techniques,
the uncertainty is inherent in the nature of things and quantiﬁes the
inability to precisely locate them.

Superposition Principle

I cannot deﬁne the real problem therefore I suspect there is

—R. P. Feynman
6.7 Superposition Principle
According to quantum physics, we may associate with each particle
a wave function to determine its position ⃗r at a given time t:
(⃗r, t) = Aei(⃗k·⃗r−ωt) .
(6.49)
Since the probability density |(⃗r, t)|2 = |A|2 = const., i.e., it
is independent of ⃗r and t, we see that the particle is completely
unlocalized in space and can be found anywhere in space with
the same probability. However, we know from everyday life that
particles are localized in space and their position can be given with
some approximation. In other words, particles are partly localized.
Therefore, a wave function such as (6.49) cannot represent a real
physical system.
How to get out of this dilemma?
We may resolve this dilemma by referring to the uncertainty
principle. According to the uncertainty principle, a particle partly
localized in space (⃗r < ∞) has an uncertainty in momentum
(⃗p ̸= 0). Hence, if
1(⃗r, t) = A1ei(⃗p1·⃗r/ℏ−ω1t)
(6.50)
is a wave function of the particle located at ⃗r, then
2(⃗r, t) = A2ei(⃗p2·⃗r/ℏ−ω2t) ,
(6.51)
where |⃗p1 −⃗p2| ≤⃗p is also a wave function of the particle.
Moreover, any linear combination (superposition) of the two
wave functions is also a wave function of the particle,a i.e.,
(⃗r, t) = a1(⃗r, t) + b2(⃗r, t) ,
(6.52)
where a and b are complex numbers.
aWe will see in Chapter 7 that this conclusion arises from the linearity in  of
the Schr¨odinger equation, which determines the wave function of a given particle.
Namely, the linearity simply means that if 1 and 2 are solutions to the Schr¨odinger
equation, then an arbitrary linear combination of 1 and 2 is also a solution.

82
Duality of Light and Matter
Equation (6.52) is an example of the superposition principle,
which, in general, holds for an arbitrary number of wave functions.
Thus, a single wave function cannot represent a particle of a given
momentum. Instead, we expect that the particle is represented by a
superposition of wave functions. Hence, we may conclude that the
wave function of a particle is represented by the sum of sinusoidal
waves exp[i(⃗k · ⃗r −ωkt)]. For a continuous set of wave functions, the
sum is of course an integral
(⃗r, t) =

k
A(⃗k)ei(⃗k·⃗r−ωkt)d3k ,
(6.53)
where d3k is the element of volume in ⃗k-space (momentum space).
In other words, the set contains an inﬁnite number of waves with
continuously varying wave number k.
One can see from Eq. (6.53) that the mathematics used in
carrying out the procedure of obtaining a superposition wave
function involves the Fourier transformation (Fourier integral). If
the superposition function is known, the amplitude A(⃗k) can be

In summary, the superposition principle is at the heart of quantum
mechanics and is referred by many physicists as really “the only
mystery” of quantum mechanics. It is in complete contrast with
classical mechanics, where a superposition of two states would be
a complete nonsense as it would imply that a particle could simulta-
neously occupy two or more points in space. According to quantum
physics, a particle can exist in two or more states at the same time.
Furthermore, if more particles are involved, we encounter the idea
of a multi-particle superposition or non-separability, called quantum
entanglement. Clearly, the superposition principle confronts us with
some basic questions of interpretation of physical reality. The
superposition principle and entanglement have been exploited in
recent years in three important applications. The ﬁrst is quantum
cryptography, where a communication signal between two people
can be made completely secure from eavesdroppers. The second
is quantum communication, where capacities of transmission lines
can be increased in comparision to that of classical transmission

systems. The third is a proposed device called quantum computer,
where all possible calculations could be carried out simultaneously.
6.8 Quantum Interference
A beautiful illustration of the superposition principle is the
interference phenomenon. Although interference is a classical wave
phenomenon, it is also at the heart of quantum mechanics. It is
usually illustrated with Young’s double-slit experiment, in which a
beam of light is divided at two narrow slits into two beams that,
after traveling separately for some distance, are recombined at an
observation point.
If there is a small path diﬀerence between the beams, interfer-
ence fringes are observed at the observation (recombination) point.
A schematic diagram of Young’s double-slit experiment is shown in
Fig. 6.5.
Figure 6.5
Schematic diagram of Young’s double-slit experiment. Two light
beams emerging from the slits S1 and S2 are brought together at the
observing screen and the resulting light intensity is measured at various
positions.
The observed intensity is a pattern of alternating bright and
dark strips, called interference fringes. Understanding the reason for
this interference is not diﬃcult. It may be explained using classical
description of the process. The paths from each slit to a given point
on the observation screen are not necessarily equal, so the beams

84
Duality of Light and Matter
traveling from the slits arrive with diﬀerent phases of propagation.
Due to the phase diﬀerence, the two beams will yield constructive
interference (bright strips) if they are in phase at the observation
point and destructive interference (dark strips) if they are 180◦out
of phase with each other.a
The interpretation of the interference phenomenon becomes
more subtle when the light beams are replaced by individual
photons or particles. What happens is that when single photons
or particles are used and the experiment is repeated many times,
it is observed that the resulting pattern on the screen is identical
to that observed with the light beams. This seems to imply that
the individual photons had passed through both slits at the same
time and interfered with themselves. Dirac ﬁrst noticed this strange
behavior, and his statement is now cited as the famous phrase “each
photon interferes only with itself. Interference between diﬀerent
photons never occurs.”
How could the photon travel simultaneously through both slits?
This confusion is explained in terms of the superposition
principle resulting from the lack of information about the slit
through which the photon has been transferred to the screen. The
interference pattern observed in Young’s double-slit experiment
results from a superposition of the probability amplitudes for the
photon to take either of the two possible pathways. After the
interaction of the photon with the slits, the system of the two slits
and a photon is a single quantum system. In this case, the wave
function of the photon detected at the screen is a sum of two wave
functions corresponding to the two possible pathways the photon
traveled to the screen
(⃗R) = 1(⃗R) + 2(⃗R) ,
(6.55)
where ⃗R is the position of the detector on the screen.
The probability of detecting the photon at R is obtained by
calculating the square of the absolute value of (⃗R):

aCertain fundamental conditions must be satisﬁed to obtain interference fringes: the
beams must have the same intensity, frequency, wavelength, and polarization.

where “Re” denotes the real part. In this equation, the term |1(⃗R)|2
is the probability for the photon to pass through slit 1; the term
|2(⃗R)|2 is the probability for the photon to pass through slit 2; and
the last term is the interference (superposition) between these two
probabilities. Since the wave functions depend on the position of
the slits, i(⃗R) ∼ei⃗ki·⃗R, we see that |(⃗R)|2 is a cosine function of
position ⃗R and the recorded signal will show a spatial modulation
(interference fringes) on the screen.
Note that only the last term in Eq. (6.56) varies with the position
on the screen. Thus, this term is the only one responsible for the in-
terference fringes observed on the screen. It shows that interference
is a clear example of non-separability or entanglement in quantum
mechanics. Of course, the concept of a photon as a discrete localized
object is not helpful in understanding this experiment.
When we close one of the slits, say slit 1, 1(⃗R) = 0, and then the
probability (6.56) reduces to
(⃗R)

2
=
2(⃗R)

2
,
(6.57)
which shows that in this case no interference fringes are observed.
When one of the slits is closed, we deﬁnitely know through which
slit the photon traveled to the screen. This example is a clear
illustration that the observation of interference fringes and the
acquisition of which way the photon (information) was transferred
are mutually exclusive. This problem is often referred to by the
German phrase “welcher weg” (which way). Thus, interference is
always a manifestation of the intrinsic indistinguishability of two
possible paths of the detected photon. This indistinguishability is
an example of Bohr’s principle of complementarity that interference
and which way information are mutually exclusive concepts.a
An aside: The welcher weg problem has created many discus-
sions on the validity of the principle of complementarity. Einstein
proposed modifying Young’s double-slit experiment by using freely
moving slits. A light beam, or a particle, arriving at a point on the
screen must have changed momentum when passing through the

quantum interference, and some interference experiments are referred to a book by

slits. Since the paths of the light beams traveling from the slits to
the point on the screen are diﬀerent, the change of the momentum
at each slit must be diﬀerent. Einstein’s proposal was simply to
observe the motion of the slits after the light beam traversed them.
Depending on how rapidly they were moving, one could deduce
through which slit the light beam had passed and, simultaneously,
one could observe an interference pattern. If this were possible, it
would be a direct contradiction of the principle of complementarity.
However, Bohr proved that this proposal was deceptive in the
sense that the position of the recoiling slits was subject to some
uncertainty provided by the uncertainty principle. As a result, if the
slits are moveable, a random phase is imparted to the light beams,
and hence the interference pattern disappears.
Feynman in his proposal for a welcher weg experiment suggested
replacing the slits in the usual Young’s experiment by electrons.
Because electrons are charged particles, they can interact with
the incoming electromagnetic ﬁeld. Feynman suggested putting a
light source symmetrically between the slits. If the light beam
is scattered by an electron, the direction of the scattered beam
will precisely determine from which electron the beam has been
scattered. In this experiment, the momentum of the electrons
and their positions are both important parameters. To determine
which electron had scattered the light beam and at the same
moment observe interference, the momentum and the position of
the electron would have to be measured to accuracies greater than
allowed by the uncertainty principle.
6.9 Wave Packets
We have already learned that a free particle is not represented by a
single wave function but rather by a superposition of closely related
wave functions. Such a superposition is named a free particle wave
packet. A typical wave packet of a free particle is given by Eq.
(6.53). It also shows that the momentum and then also the position
distribution are roughly pictured by the behavior of |A(⃗k)|2.
We now consider the motion of a free particle wave packet. For
simplicity, we consider the motion in one dimension. In this case,

Wave Packets

(⃗r, t) →(x, t) =
 ∞
−∞
A (k) ei(kx−ωkt)dk ,
(6.58)
where k = kx and the frequency ωk is diﬀerent for diﬀerent k.
Let us assume that A(k) is appreciable only for k values that
lie in an interval k0 −1
2k, k0 + 1
2k, where k/k0 ≪1 and k0
corresponds to the central (maximum) momentum.
Consider ﬁrst the shape of the wave packet at t = 0. For t = 0,
the wave packet (6.58) reduces to
(x, 0) =
 ∞
−∞
A (k) eikxdk .
(6.59)
We see that waves with diﬀerent k have diﬀerent phases.
Is there any relation between diﬀerent phases and diﬀerent
positions of the fronts of the superimposed waves?
If x is the displacement of x from x = 0, we may calculate under
what condition the particle can be found in the region x. Since the
phases of the waves are diﬀerent, calculate the maximal and minimal
phases of the packet:
x

k0 −1
2k
	
,
minimal
x

k0 + 1
2k
	
,
maximal .
Waves with diﬀerent phases will interfere with each other. The
maximum of interference appears for the diﬀerence between the
phases equal to 2π. Thus,
xk = 2π .
(6.60)
Hence, the particle can be found at points for which x = 2π/k,
i.e., determined by the uncertainty relation.
Now we will check how the packet moves in time.
To do this, we may expand the frequency ωk, appearing in
Eq. (6.58), into a Taylor series about ωk0 = ω0 corresponding to the
maximum of the momentum at k = k0. By taking k = k0 + β, where
β is a small displacement from k0, the frequency can be expanded as
ωk = ωk0+β = ω0 +

k0 is the group velocity of the packet.
If we increase x by x, i.e., x →x + x, then
eiβ(x−vgt) = eiβxeiβ(x−vgt) .
(6.63)
Thus, for x = vgt, we obtain the same packet as for t = 0, but
shifted by vgt. The conclusion then is that the group velocity is the
velocity of the packet moving as a whole.
If we include the third term of the Taylor expansion (6.61), we
get

The term vg +

k0 β plays the role of the velocity of the wave
packet, which now depends on β. Thus, diﬀerent parts of the wave
packet will move with diﬀerent velocities, leading to a spreading of
the wave packet. This spreading is due to dispersion that vg depends
on β.
We can now summarize to give the connection between the group
velocity and the phase velocity, and the role of dispersion.
Phase velocity

Hence
vg = dω

(6.65)
Thus, vg depends on k when du
dk ̸= 0, i.e., when the phase velocity
depends on k. The dependence of vg on k is called dispersion.
In addition, we can say that the spread of the wave packet is due
to the dependence of the phase velocity on k [vg ̸= u when du
dk ̸= 0].

Wave Packets
89
Let us summarize what we have learned in this lecture:
(1) In quantum physics, localized particles are represented by a
superposition of wave functions (so-called wave packets) rather
than a single harmonic wave function.
(2) The fact that the wave function of a particle must be represented
by a group of waves of diﬀerent momenta suggests that there is
a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which the momentum
and position of the particle can be measured.
(3) The maximum of a wave packet moves through space with the
group velocity.
(4) The group velocity of the wave packet associated with a moving
particle is the same as the velocity of the particle.
(5) Since the matter waves are dispersive, a wave packet spreads
out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes
more uncertain.

Non-Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
The major problem in quantum physics is to ﬁnd the wave function
of a given physical system and to understand (predict) how the wave
function of the system evolves in time, or how it changes under
external inﬂuences.
In 1926, Erwin Schr¨odinger predicted that the wave function of a
given physical system might be completely determined if the total
energy of the system was known.a He formulated an equation of
motion for the wave function of a physical system, which is called the
Schr¨odinger equation. It is the basic relationship for determining
the evolution of the wave function and possible energies of a given
physical system.
We shall try to ﬁnd a diﬀerential equation for the wave function
of a particle assuming that only the energy of the particle is known.
Since the equation represents a real physical system, it must satisfy
the following conditions:
• The equation must be linear.
• Coeﬃcients appearing in this equation should only depend
on the parameters characteristic of the particle.
aSchr¨odinger was granted the Nobel Prize in 1933 for his discovery of new productive
forms of atomic theory.

Non-Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
We will limit our considerations to the non-relativistic case only.
7.1 Schr¨odinger Equation of a Free Particle
First, we will consider the case of a free particle moving in one
dimension. The wave function of a free particle moving along, say
the x-axis, is given by
(x, t) = maxei(kx−ωt) .
(7.1)
On the other hand, the energy and momentum of a free particle are
related by
E = 1
2m p2
x .
(7.2)
Since E = ℏω and px = ℏk, we can express the energy in terms of
the wave parameters
ω = ℏ
2mk2 .
(7.3)
Note that
(1) Taking the ﬁrst derivative of Eq. (7.1) over x is equivalent to
multiplying the wave function (x, t) by ik.
(2) Taking the ﬁrst derivative of Eq. (7.1) over t is equivalent to
multiplying the wave function (x, t) by −iω.
Thus, from Eq. (7.3), we can conclude that the diﬀerential
equation for the wave function should be the ﬁrst order in t and the
second order in x. The simplest equation of this form is
∂(x, t)
∂t
= 2 ∂2(x, t)
∂x2
,
(7.4)
where  is a parameter, which has to be determined.
To determine , we substitute Eq. (7.1) into Eq. (7.4) and ﬁnd
−iω = −2k2 .
(7.5)
Then, using Eq. (7.3), we ﬁnd that
2 = iℏ
2m .
(7.6)

Schr¨odinger Equation of a Free Particle
93
Hence, the wave function of a particle of the energy (7.2) satisﬁes
the following diﬀerential equation:
∂(x, t)
∂t
= iℏ
2m
∂2(x, t)

(7.7)
or equivalently
iℏ∂(x, t)
∂t
+ ℏ2
2m
∂2(x, t)
∂x2
= 0 .
(7.8)
Equation (7.8) is called the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equa-
tion for a free particle. It is easy to extend the equation to three
dimensions:
iℏ∂(⃗r, t)
∂t
+ ℏ2
2m∇2(⃗r, t) = 0 .
(7.9)
7.1.1 Operators
We can write the three-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation in the
following form:
−ℏ
i
∂
∂t(⃗r, t) = 1
2m
ℏ
i ∇
	 ℏ
i ∇
	
(⃗r, t) .
(7.10)
It shows that the Schr¨odinger equation can be obtained from the
energy (Hamiltonian) of the free particle (E = |⃗p|2/2m) by simply
replacing E and ⃗p, respectively, by
E →−ℏ
i
∂
∂t ,
⃗p →ℏ
i ∇.
(7.11)
These relations show that in quantum physics, the physical
quantities are represented by mathematical operations. We call
them operators.
The quantities ∇and ∂/∂t deﬁne operations or actions to be
carried out on the wave function . The particular operation stated
in Eq. (7.10), ∂/∂t consists of taking a partial derivative of  in
terms of t, and ∇2 consists of taking partial derivatives of  in
terms of Cartesian coordinates. The result is a new wave function,
which may be diﬀerent from the original one or may be equal to
the original wave function multiplied by a scalar. We often say that
operators associate a wave function with another wave function. To
clarify further the action of the operators ∇and ∂/∂t on the wave
function, we will apply them to a speciﬁc example.

94
Non-Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
Worked Example
Calculate (a) ∂
∂t and (b) ∇2, where  = maxei(kx−ωt).
Solution
(a) The partial derivative of  in terms of t is
∂
∂t = max
∂
∂tei(kx−ωt) = −iωmaxei(kx−ωt) = −iω. (7.12)
Thus, the action of the operator ∂/∂t on the wave function  results
in a constant −iω times the original wave function. We shall see
later that such a wave function is called in quantum physics an
eigenfunction or eigenstate of the ∂/∂t operator, and −iω is the
corresponding eigenvalue.
The solution to part (b) is left to the readers.
Important property of operators
In classical physics, the multiplication of two quantities, say x and
px, is immaterial. However, in quantum physics, where physical
quantities are represented by operators, the order of multiplication
is important and, for example, xpx ̸= pxx, where px = −iℏ∂/∂x.
We say that the two quantities
x and px do not commute.a The
readers are familiar with such an ordering through the use of matrix
algebra, where in general the order of two matrices is important,
that is M1M2 ̸= M2M1.
A measure of the extent to which xpx ̸= pxx is given by the
commutator bracket
[ˆx, ˆpx] = ˆx ˆpx −ˆpx ˆx ,
(7.13)
where we have introduced the symbol “ˆ” over the quantities x and
px to indicate that these quantities are operators.
aCommutation consists in reversing the order of two quantities in an algebraic
operation.

Schr¨odinger Equation of a Free Particle
95
Note that the coordinates of ⃗r are the same in operator and
classical forms. For example, the coordinate x is simply used in the
operator form as x.
How to calculate the commutator [ˆx, ˆpx]?
Since operators are “action” operations on functions, we consider
the action of this commutator on a trial function (x):
[ˆx, ˆpx] (x) = x

−iℏ∂
∂x
	
+ iℏ∂
∂x (x)
= −iℏx ∂
∂x + iℏ + iℏx ∂
∂x = iℏ .
(7.14)
Hence
[ˆx, ˆpx] = iℏ.
(7.15)
The result of the commutator is a number iℏ. However, this is not
the general rule that a commutator of two operators is always a
number. We shall see later many examples where the commutator
of two operators is an operator.
We can generalize the commutation relation between the
position and momentum operators into three dimensions and can
readily show that the components of the positions ˆ⃗r and momentum
ˆ⃗p operators satisfy the commutation relations
[ˆrm, ˆpn] = iℏδmn ,
m, n = 1, 2, 3 ,
(7.16)
where
ˆr1 = ˆx ,
ˆr2 = ˆy ,
ˆr3 = ˆz ,
ˆp1 = ˆpx ,
ˆp2 = ˆpy ,
ˆp3 = ˆpz .
(7.17)
The symbol δmn is called Kronecker δ function and is deﬁned as
δmn =
1
if
m = n
0
if
m ̸= n .
(7.18)
The commutation relations (7.16) are called the canonical commuta-
tion relations.
Using the operator representation, the Schr¨odinger equation is
often written as
iℏ∂(⃗r, t)
∂t
= ˆH (⃗r, t) ,
(7.19)
where ˆH = −ℏ2
2m∇2 is the Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the free
particle.

Non-Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
7.2 Schr¨odinger Equation of a Particle in an External
Potential
In physics, we often deal with problems in which particles are free
within some kind of boundary but have boundary conditions set by
some external potentials. The particle-in-a-box problem, discussed
before, is the simplest example.
In the presence of an external potential V (⃗r, t), which may
depend on time, the Hamiltonian of the particle takes the form
ˆH (⃗r, t) = −ℏ2
2m∇2 + ˆV (⃗r, t) ,
(7.20)
which shows that the particle can gain an energy due to the potential
ˆV (⃗r, t).
The wave function of the particle moving in the external potential
can be diﬀerent from that of the free particle. It can be found solving
the Schr¨odinger equation (7.19) with the Hamiltonian (7.20). The
solution, however, must satisfy the following conditions:
(1) The wave function must be determined and continuous at any
point of the space (⃗r, t).
(2) The wave function must vanish at inﬁnity, i.e., (⃗r, t) →0 when
r →±∞.
We will try to solve the Schr¨odinger equation assuming that
the Hamiltonian ˆH (⃗r, t) does not explicitly depend on time, i.e.,
ˆV (⃗r, t) = ˆV (⃗r). In this case, the Schr¨odinger equation contains two
terms: one dependent on time t and the other dependent on ⃗r, i.e.,

iℏ∂
∂t −ˆH (⃗r)
	
(⃗r, t) = 0 ,
(7.21)
where ˆH depends solely on ⃗r.
Since the time- and ⃗r-dependent parts are separated, the solution
to the Schr¨odinger equation will be in the form of a product of two
functions φ(⃗r) and f (t):
(⃗r, t) = φ(⃗r) f (t) .
(7.22)
Substituting this equation into the Schr¨odinger equation, we get
iℏφ(⃗r)df (t)
dt
= f (t) ˆH (⃗r)φ(⃗r) ,
(7.23)

φ
ˆH φ ,
(7.24)
where ˆH ≡ˆH (⃗r), f ≡f (t), and φ ≡φ(⃗r).
The left-hand side of Eq. (7.24) is a function of only one variable
t, whereas the right-hand side is a function of only the position ⃗r,
i.e., each side is independent of any changes in the other. Thus, both
sides must be equal to a constant, say E:
iℏ1

We can easily solve Eq. (7.25), and the solution can be written
directly as
f (t) = Ce−i
ℏEt ,
(7.27)
where C is a constant.
The other part of the Schr¨odinger equation, Eq. (7.26), can be
written as
ˆH φ = Eφ ,
(7.28)
which is called the stationary (time-independent) Schr¨odinger
equation, or the eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian ˆH .
Hence, the complete solution to the Schr¨odinger equation is of
the form
(⃗r, t) = Cφ(⃗r)e−i
ℏEt ,
(7.29)
that is, (⃗r, t) is the product of a time-dependent function and
a position-dependent function φ(⃗r), which satisﬁes the eigenvalue
equation (7.28).
Note that the solution (7.29) leads to the probability density
|(⃗r, t)|2 = |Cφ(⃗r)|2 ,
(7.30)
which is independent of time.
Thus, when the Hamiltonian of a particle is independent of
time, the probability of ﬁnding the particle in an arbitrary point
⃗r is independent of time. Such a state (wave function) is called a
stationary state of the particle.

Non-Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
The existence of stationary states has two very useful practical
consequences. Physically, such states have a permanence in time,
which allows their long-time experimental investigations. Mathe-
matically, they reduce the Schr¨odinger equation to the eigenvalue
equation for the Hamiltonian. Thus, to obtain speciﬁc values of
energy and corresponding wave functions, we operate on the wave
function with the Hamiltonian and solve the resulting diﬀerential
equation. However, not all mathematically possible solutions are
accepted. Physics imposes some limits on the solutions of the
Schr¨odinger equation.
More precisely, the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation must
satisfy the following conditions:
(1) The wave function φ must be ﬁnite in all points of the space and
vanish at inﬁnity.
(2) The wave function φ must be continuous and should have
continuous ﬁrst derivatives.
(3) The wave function φ must be a single-value function at any point
⃗r.
(4) The wave function must be normalized.
These conditions are often called the boundary conditions for the
wave function.
When an operation on a wave function gives a constant times the
original wave function, that constant is called an eigenvalue and the
wave function is called an eigenfunction or eigenstate. Thus, the
wave function that satisﬁes the stationary Schr¨odinger equation is
the eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian ˆH , and E is the eigenvalue of
the Hamiltonian in the state φ.
The complete set of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian ˆH is termed
energy spectrum. The energy spectrum can be non-degenerated
(diﬀerent eigenfunctions have diﬀerent eigenvalues), or degener-
ated (all or few eigenfunctions have the same eigenvalues), but it
is not allowed that one eigenfunction could have a few diﬀerent
eigenvalues.
To solve the Schr¨odinger equation, even in its simpler stationary
(time-independent) form, usually requires sophisticated mathemat-
ical techniques. In fact, for any system, the stationary Schr¨odinger

is in the form of a second-order diﬀerential equation
−ℏ2
2m∇2φ +
 ˆV (⃗r) −E

φ = 0 ,
(7.32)
whose solution depends on the explicit form of the potential ˆV (⃗r).
Thus, we see that the particle is represented by its mass and only
the potential ˆV (⃗r) alters the form of the diﬀerential equation.
Hence, the problem of ﬁnding energies and the wave function
of a particle moving in a potential ˆV (⃗r) is equivalent to solving
the second-order diﬀerential equation for the wave function with a
known speciﬁc form of ˆV (⃗r). In other words, once ˆV (⃗r) is known, the
Schr¨odinger equation may be solved and the wave function φ(⃗r) may
be found. Then the probability density |φ(⃗r)|2 may be determined for
a speciﬁc point ⃗r.
In the next few chapters, we will investigate solutions to the
stationary Schr¨odinger equation for diﬀerent forms of the potential
ˆV (⃗r). More precisely, we will seek energies and wave functions of a
particle subject to diﬀerent constrains on its free motion.
In summary of the chapter on the Schr¨odinger equation, we have
learned that
(1) In quantum physics, physical quantities are represented by
operators.
(2) The operator representing the energy of a system is the
Hamiltonian ˆH .
(3) The eigenvalues of ˆH are energies E.
(4) If the potential ˆV is independent of time, then the separation
of variables is possible and we can write the wave function as
(⃗r, t) = φ(⃗r) f (t).
(5) The wave function φ(⃗r) is the eigenfunction of the time-
independent Hamiltonian ˆH and can be found by solving the
stationary Schr¨odinger equation ˆH φ(⃗r) = Eφ(⃗r).

7.3 Equation of Continuity
We know that the probability of ﬁnding a particle in a volume V is
normalized to 1, i.e.,

V
|(⃗r, t)|2dV = 1.
(7.33)
This normalization condition must be valid for any wave function
evaluated at any point ⃗r and at any time t. We will show that the
Schr¨odinger equation guarantees the conservation of normalization
of the wave function. In other words, if  was normalized at t = 0, it
will remain normalized at all times.
In addition, there is a ﬂow of the probability density or particle
current density associated with a moving particle. Therefore, we will
also deﬁne what the particle probability current density is in terms
of the particle wave function.
Suppose we have a particle described by a wave function  in
a volume V enclosed by a surface S. We will consider the time
evolution of the particle wave function, which is given by the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ∂
∂t = −ℏ2
2m∇2 + ˆV  .
(7.34)
First, we take complex conjugate of the aforementioned equation:
−iℏ∂∗
∂t
= −ℏ2
2m∇2∗+ ˆV ∗.
(7.35)
Next, multiplying Eq. (7.34) by ∗and Eq. (7.35) by , and
subtracting the resulting equations, we get

we ﬁnd that

= ∇∗· ∇ + ∗∇· (∇) −∇ · ∇∗−∇· (∇∗)
= ∗∇2 −∇2∗.
(7.39)
Thus, Eq. (7.36) can be written as

(7.40)
Introducing a notation

ℏ
2im (∗∇ −∇∗) = ⃗J ,
(7.41)
we obtain
∂ρ
∂t + ∇· ⃗J = 0 .
(7.42)
The reader familiar with the theory of ﬂuids and with electricity
and magnetism will immediately recognize that the above equation
is identical in form to the well-known continuity equation, which
shows the conservation of matter or the conservation of charge.
In our case, the continuity equation shows the conservation of the
probability density ρ, and ⃗J is then the probability current density.
To interpret the continuity equation in terms of a ﬂow of the
probability, it is convenient to integrate Eq. (7.42) over the volume
V closed by a surface S, as shown in Fig. 7.1:

S
⃗J · d⃗S .
(7.45)
The left-hand side of this equation is the time rate of increase of
probability of ﬁnding the particle inside the volume V . The integral
on the right-hand side is the probability per unit time of the particle
leaving the volume V through the surface S. This justiﬁes why ⃗J is
called the probability current density. It tells us the rate at which
probability is “ﬂowing” through the surface S.
The scalar product ⃗J · d⃗S is the probability that the particle will
cross an area d⃗S on the surface. When the particle remains inside the
volume for all times, i.e., does not cross the surface ⃗S, then ⃗J ·d⃗S = 0,
and we get
∂
∂t

V
||2dV = 0 ,
(7.46)
which shows that the Schr¨odinger equation guarantees the conser-
vation of normalization of the wave function. In other words, if 
was normalized at t = 0, it will remain normalized at all times.
7.4 Transmission and Reflection Coefficients
Suppose that particles inside the surface are represented by plane
waves
in(⃗r) = Aei⃗k1·⃗r + Be−i⃗k1·⃗r ,
(7.47)
and outside the surface
out(⃗r) = Cei⃗k2·⃗r ,
(7.48)
where ⃗k1 and ⃗k2 are the wave vectors of the particle inside and
outside the surface, respectively. The coeﬃcients A, B, and C
are interpreted as the amplitudes of the incident, reﬂected, and
transmitted particles, respectively.

(7.50)
Inside the surface, the current density is composed of two terms and
can be written as
⃗J in = ⃗J i −⃗J r ,
(7.51)
where
⃗J i = ℏ⃗k1
m |A|2
(7.52)
is interpreted as the incident particle current, and
⃗J r = ℏ⃗k1
m |B|2
(7.53)
is interpreted as the reﬂected particle current. The current density
outside the surface
⃗J t = ℏ⃗k2
m |C|2
(7.54)
is interpreted as the transmitted particle current.
If the number of particles is conserved, i.e., the particles are not
created or destroyed, the current densities inside and outside the
surface should be equal:
⃗J in = ⃗J out .
(7.55)
This equation can be written in terms of the amplitudes as
|A|2 −|B|2 = k2
k1
|C|2 .
(7.56)
We can deﬁne the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the surface
R = |⃗J r|
|⃗J i|
,
(7.57)
which is given by the probability current density reﬂected from the
surface divided by the probability current density incident on the
surface.

104
Non-Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
We can also deﬁne the transmission coeﬃcient of the surface
T = |⃗J t|
|⃗J i|
,
(7.58)
which is given by the probability current density transmitted
through the surface divided by the probability current density
incident on the surface.
Using Eqs. (7.52)–(7.54), we can write the reﬂection and
transmission coeﬃcients in terms of the incident, reﬂected, and
transmitted coeﬃcients as
R = |B|2
|A|2 ,
T = k2
k1
|C|2
|A|2 ,
(7.59)
where k1 = |⃗k1| and k2 = |⃗k2|.
Thus, if |B|2 = |A|2, then R = 1, i.e., all the particles that are
incident on the surface are reﬂected.
It is easy to show from Eqs. (7.56) and (7.59) that
R + T = 1 ,
(7.60)
as it should be, otherwise the particles could be created or
destroyed.

Potential (Quantum) Wells
We have seen that the wave nature of particles plays an important
role in their physical properties that, for example, particles conﬁned
into a small bounded area can have only particular discrete energies.
However, the question we are most interested in is: Can we create an
artiﬁcial structure that exploits discrete energy levels? The answer
is “yes”; we can produce such structures, and they involve potential
barriers. Such one-dimensional structures constructed are called
quantum wells, two-dimensional structures are called quantum
wires, and three-dimensional structures are called quantum dots.
With the current knowledge of quantum physics, this answer
may probably sound rather abstract to the readers, so let us try to
make it more concrete.
To illustrate that in practice, particles may really exhibit unusual
quantum eﬀects when they are located in such structures; we will
solve the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation
ˆH φ(⃗r) = Eφ(⃗r) ,
(8.1)
to ﬁnd the energies (eigenvalues) E and the corresponding eigen-
functions φ(⃗r) of a particle of mass m moving in a potential ˆV (⃗r) that
varies with the position ⃗r.

Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
It is simplest to ﬁrst consider the motion of particles in one
dimension. Therefore, in this and the following chapter, we will limit
our calculations to the one-dimensional case, in which the Hamil-
tonian of the particle moving in one dimension, say x-direction,
is given by
ˆH = −ℏ2
2m
d2
dx2 + ˆV (x) .
(8.2)
With this Hamiltonian, we get from the Schr¨odinger equation a
second-order diﬀerential equation for the wave function of the
particle
d2φ(x)
dx2
= −2m
ℏ2 (E −V (x)) φ(x) ,
(8.3)
which can be written as
d2φ(x)
dx2
= −k2(x)φ(x) ,
(8.4)
where
k2(x) = 2m

E −ˆV (x)

ℏ2
.
(8.5)
Thus, we see that the behavior of the particle, which is
determined by the parameter k2(x), will depend only on three
factors: total energy of the particle, potential barriers, and the mass
of the particle.
When ˆV (x) is independent of x, i.e., the particle is moving along
the x-axis under the inﬂuence of no force because the potential is
constant, the parameter k2(x) = k2, and then Eq. (8.4) reduces to a
simple harmonic oscillator equation
d2φ(x)
dx2
= −k2φ(x) .
(8.6)
This is a linear diﬀerential equation with a constant coeﬃcient.
The solution to Eq. (8.6) depends on whether k2 > 0 or k2 < 0.
For k2 > 0, the general solution to Eq. (8.6) is in the form of an
oscillating wave
φ(x) = Aeikx + Be−ikx ,
(E > V ) ,
(8.7)
where A and B are amplitudes of the particle wave moving to the
right and to the left, respectively.

109
For k2 < 0, the general solution to Eq. (8.6) is in the form
φ(x) = Ce−kx + Dekx ,
(E < V ) ,
(8.8)
that the exponents are real and no longer represent an oscillating
wave function. They represent a wave function with damped
amplitudes.
Important note: The general solution (8.7) with both constants
A and B diﬀerent from zero is physically acceptable. However, the
general solution (8.8) with both constants C and D diﬀerent from
zero cannot be accepted. We have learned that the wave function
must vanish for x →±∞. Thus, if the particle moves in the direction
of positive x, in an unbounded or semibounded space, then only the
wave function with C ̸= 0 and D = 0 will satisfy this condition,
whereas if the particle moves in the direction of negative x, only the
wave function with C = 0 and D ̸= 0 will satisfy the condition of
φ(x) →0 as x →−∞.
Another important observation: The general solutions (8.7) and
(8.8) are single-value solutions for the wave function φ(x). Thus, for
the particle moving in an unbounded area where the potential ˆV is
constant, there are no restrictions on k, which, according to Eq. (8.5),
means that there are no restrictions on the energy E of the particle.
Hence, the energy E of the particle can have any value ranging from
zero to +∞(continuous spectrum). It is also valid for x-dependent
potentials, where V (x) slowly changes with x.a
Having now obtained a general solution to the Schr¨odinger
equation, let us examine a few special cases more closely. We
will consider four cases of a one-dimensional motion of particles
conﬁned in potentials rapidly changing with x:
• Inﬁnite potential quantum well.
• A potential step.
• Square-well potential.
• Tunneling through a potential barrier.
aFor potentials rapidly changing with x, the particle can be trapped in potential holes,
and then E can be diﬀerent.

110
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
Our interest in these four problems is
(1) To understand how the wave function of a particle conﬁned by
a potential V is calculated.
(2) To see how the Schr¨odinger equation is solved when the motion
of a particle is subject to restrictions.
(3) To learn the characteristic properties of solutions to this
equation.
(4) To see diﬀerences between the predictions of quantum mechan-
ics and classical physics.
8.1 Infinite Potential Quantum Well
As the ﬁrst example of the application of Schr¨odinger equation,
consider a particle conﬁned in a one-dimensional structure, an
inﬁnite potential well, as illustrated in Fig. 8.1. The term “well” is
a bit misleading since the particle is actually only trapped in one
direction. It is still free to move in other two directions. However,
the term “well” is commonly used in the literature and we will follow
this terminology.
For the inﬁnite potential well centered at x = 0:
V (x) = 0
for
−a
2 ≤x ≤a
2 ,
V (x) = ∞
for
x < −a
2
and
x > a
2 .
(8.9)
Figure 8.1
An inﬁnite potential well. Outside the region −a/2 ≤x ≤a/2,
the potential V (x) →∞.

Infinite Potential Quantum Well
111
Within the well, there is no potential energy, while outside the
well the potential is inﬁnite, so that the particle cannot exist there
since it would have to have inﬁnite energy. What classical physics
and quantum physics tell us about the behavior of the particle inside
the well?
According to classical physics, the particle trapped between the
potential walls will bounce back and forth indeﬁnitely; its kinetic
energy will be constant E = mv2/2. Moreover, the probability of
ﬁnding the particle at any point between the walls is constant and
anywhere outside the walls is zero. In fact, if we know the initial
momentum and position of the particle, we can specify the location
of the particle at any time in the future. The classical case seems
trivial.
According to quantum physics, the particle is described by a wave
function φ(x), which satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation and some
boundary conditions. One of the boundary conditions says that the
wave function φ(x) must be ﬁnite everywhere. Thus, in the regions
x < −a/2 and x > a/2, the wave function φ(x) must be zero to
satisfy this condition that V (x)φ(x) must be ﬁnite everywhere.
In the region −a/2 ≤x ≤a/2, the potential V (x) = 0, and then
the Schr¨odinger equation for the wave function takes the form
d2φ(x)
dx2
= −k2φ(x) ,
(8.10)
where k2 = 2mE/ℏ2.
Since k2 is positive, the Schr¨odinger equation (8.10) has a simple
solution
φ(x) = Aeikx + Be−ikx ,
−a
2 ≤x ≤a
2 ,
(8.11)
where A and B are constants, which in general are complex
numbers.
To determine the unknown constants,a we will use the boundary
condition that the wave function must be continuous at x = −a/2
and x = a/2.
aUsually, we ﬁnd only one of the two constants in terms of the other, say B in terms
of A. The remaining constant A is readily found from the normalization condition
that the wave function is normalized to 1, i.e.,
 ∞
−∞
dx |φ(x)|2 = 1 .
(8.12)

112
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
Since in the regions x < −a/2 and x > a/2, the wave function is
equal to zero and the wave function must be continuous at x = −a/2
and x = a/2, we have φ(x) = 0 at these points. In other words, the
wave functions must join smoothly at these points.
Thus, at x = −a/2, the wave function φ(x) = 0 when
Ae−ika
2 + Be
ika
2 = 0 .
(8.13)
At x = a/2, the wave function φ(x) = 0 when
Ae
ika
2 + Be−ika
2 = 0 .
(8.14)
From Eq. (8.13), we ﬁnd that
B = −Ae−ika ,
(8.15)
whereas from Eq. (8.14), we ﬁnd that
B = −Aeika .
(8.16)
We have obtained two diﬀerent solutions for the coeﬃcient
B. Accepting these two diﬀerent solutions, we would accept two
diﬀerent solutions to the wave function. However, we cannot accept
it, as one of the conditions imposed on the wave function says that
the wave function must be a single-value function. Therefore, we
have to ﬁnd a condition under which the two solutions (8.15) and
(8.16) are equal. It is easy to see from Eqs. (8.15) and (8.16) that the
two solutions for B will be equal if
e−ika = eika ,
(8.17)
which will be satisﬁed when
e2ika = cos(2ka) + i sin(2ka) = 1 ,
(8.18)
or when
sin(2ka) = 0
and
cos(2ka) = 1 ,
(8.19)
i.e., when
k = nπ
a ,
with
n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
(8.20)
Thus, for a particle conﬁned in the inﬁnite well, a restriction is
imposed on k that k can take only discrete values.

Infinite Potential Quantum Well
113
Figure 8.2
Four lowest energy levels of a particle trapped inside the inﬁnite
potential well. Note that the separation between the energy levels increases
with an increasing n.
8.1.1 Energy Quantization
Since k2 = 2mE/ℏ2, and k is restricted to discrete values, we see
that the energy of the particle cannot be arbitrary; it can take only
certain discrete values!
En = ℏ2
2mk2 = n2 π2ℏ2
2ma2 .
(8.21)
Thus, the energy of the particle inside the well is quantized and
can have only discrete values (discrete spectrum), which depend on
the integer variable n.
We indicate this by writing a subscript n on E. The integer
number n is called the quantum number. A few of the lowest energy
levels are shown in Fig. 8.2. Note from Eq. (8.21) that the energy
levels in a quantum well depend on the dimension of the well and
the mass of the particle. This means that we can build artiﬁcial
structures of desired quantum properties, which could be observed
if the dimensions of the structures are very small.
8.1.2 Wave Functions
Substituting one of the solutions for B, Eq. (8.15) or (8.16) into the
general solution (8.11), we ﬁnd the wave function of the particle


,
with
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
(8.22)
and A′ = A exp(ika/2).
One may notice that the solution for n = 0 is not included. There
is a simple explanation. For n = 0, the wave function φ(x) = 0 for
all x inside the well. Accepting this solution would mean we accept
that the particle is not in the well. Thus, the minimum energy state in
which the particle can be inside the well is that with the energy E1 =
π2ℏ2/2ma2. Since E1 > 0, the particle can never have zero energy.
In other words, the particle can never truly be at rest.
This essentially solves the problem. The remaining coeﬃcient A′
that appears in Eq. (8.22) is found from the normalization condition
 +∞
−∞
|φn(x)|2dx = 1 .
(8.23)
Performing integration with the wave function φn(x) given by
Eq. (8.22), we ﬁnd |A′| = √2/a. The details of the integration are
left as an exercise for the readers.
While φn(x) may be negative as well as positive, |φn(x)|2 is always
positive and, since φn(x) is normalized, its value at a given x is equal
to the probability density of ﬁnding the particle at this point. Figure
8.3 shows the wave function φn(x) of the particle for the ﬁrst three
values of n. At a given x, the wave function is diﬀerent for diﬀerent
n. For example, φ1(x) has its maximum at x = 0, while φ2(x) = 0
at this particular point. For all n’s, the probability is not constant

and, for n > 1, has zeros for some values of x. For example, in the
lowest energy level of n = 1, the particle is most likely to be found in
the center of the well, while being in the ﬁrst excited state of n = 2,
it will never be found there! This is in contrast to the predictions
of classical physics, where the particle has the same probability
of being located anywhere between the walls independent of its
energy. Moreover, the lowest energy (n = 1) is nonzero, which
indicates that the particle can have nonzero energy even if the
potential energy is zero.
The predicted unusual eﬀects: the exclusion of E
= 0 as a
possible value for the energy of the particle, the limitation of E to a
discrete set of deﬁnite values, and the dependence of the probability
on the position of the particle are other examples of quantum eﬀects
without classical analog.
In the next few chapters, we will learn that these unusual
phenomena are not the only quantum phenomena. There is a more
bizarre phenomenon: penetration of the barrier that particles can be
found in the classically forbidden region.
What do we mean by the classically forbidden region? It is the
energy region in which the particles, if found, would have to have
negative kinetic energy.
In summary, we have learned that
(1) The energy of a particle in a quantum well can take only certain
discrete values. All other values of the energy are forbidden. We
say that the energy of the particle is quantized.
(2) The quantization of the energy arises from the condition of
the continuity of the particle wave function at the boundaries
between two regions of diﬀerent potential.
(3) The lowest energy the particle can have inside the well is not
zero.
(4) The probability of ﬁnding the particle at an arbitrary position x
is not constant; it even has zeros.

This is a very low temperature, which is routinely achieved in

Question 2 Explain why zero energy of the particle is excluded from
the solution to the wave function of a particle conﬁned inside an
inﬁnite potential well.
Question 3 Probability of ﬁnding the particle at any point inside the

Tutorial Problems
Problem 8.1 One may notice from Fig. 8.3 that the wave function for
n = 2 is zero at x = 0, i.e., at the center of the well. This means that
the probability of ﬁnding the particle at the center of the well is also
zero. Then, a question arises: How does the particle move from one
side of the well to the other if the probability of being at the center
is zero?
Problem 8.2 Solve the stationary Schr¨odinger equation for a particle
not bounded by any potential and show that its total energy E is not
quantized.
Problem 8.3 Solve the Schr¨odinger equation with appropriate
boundary conditions for an inﬁnite square-well with the width of
the well a centered at a/2, i.e.,
V (x) = 0
for
0 ≤x ≤a ,
V (x) = ∞
for
x < 0
and
x > a .
Check that the allowed energies are consistent with those derived
in the chapter for an inﬁnite well of width a centered at the origin.
Conﬁrm that the wave function φn(x) can be obtained from those
found in chapter if one uses the substitution x →x + a/2.
Problem 8.4 Show that, as n →∞, the probability of ﬁnding a
particle between x and x + x inside an inﬁnite potential well is
independent of x, which is the classical expectation. This result is
an example of the correspondence principle that quantum theory
should give the same results as classical physics in the limit of large
quantum numbers.

Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
Problem 8.5 As we have already learned, the exclusion of E = 0 as
a possible value for the energy of the particle and the limitation of E
to a discrete set of deﬁnite values are examples of quantum eﬀects
that have no counterpart in classical physics, where all energies,
including zero, are presumed possible.
Why we do not observe these quantum eﬀects in everyday life?
Problem 8.6 What length scale is required to observe discrete
(quantized) energies of an electron conﬁned in an inﬁnite potential
well?
Calculate the width of the potential well in which a low-energy
electron, being in the energy state n = 2, emits a visible light of
wavelength λ = 700 nm (red) when making a transition to its
ground state n = 1. Compare the length scale (width) to the size
of an atom ∼0.1 nm.
8.2 Potential Step
In our studies of unusual properties of particles conﬁned to a small
region, we now remove one of the two barriers and make the other
of ﬁnite potential V0. This is called a potential step. Such a potential
energy step very often appears in practice, e.g., at the connection
of two diﬀerent wires or semiconductors. Electrons moving inside
either wire have a constant energy, but it changes very rapidly when
passing from one to the other due to diﬀerent conductivities of the
wires.
Let us deﬁne the potential as
V (x) = V0(x)
with
V0 > 0 ,
(8.24)
where (x) is the Heaviside step function in which (x) = 1 for
x ≥0, and (x) = 0 for x < 0. This is shown in Fig. 8.4.
Thus, the potential has a height of V0 for positive x and is zero for
the negative x. This potential creates a barrier for particles moving
along the x-axis.
An example of such a situation in practice is a junction between
two conductors of diﬀerent conductivities or between two diﬀerent
semiconductors. The junction works as a potential barrier for
electrons on each side. Another practical example of a step potential

Potential Step
119
is the surface of a conductor as the potential energy of an electron
rapidly increases at the surface. Of course a step potential is an
idealization. In real situations, potential does not change abruptly.
Nevertheless, these idealized potentials are used frequently in
quantum mechanics to approximate real situations. Because of
the mathematical simplicity, one obtains the exact solution to the
Schr¨odinger equation with a variety of initial conditions.
Figure 8.4
Potential step at x = 0. The potential is zero for x < 0 (region I)
and V = V0 for x ≥0 (region II). Particles of total energy E travel from −x
toward the barrier.
Suppose that particles of mass m and total energy E travel from
−x toward the potential step (barrier), as shown in Fig. 8.4.
We will calculate the wave function of the particles in both
regions x < 0 and x ≥0 for two cases: E < V0 and E > V0.
The case E < V0.
Since in region x < 0 (we will call it region I), the potential V = 0,
the parameter k2 appearing in the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
is a positive number and, therefore, the solutions to the Schr¨odinger
equation in this region are of the form
I.
φ1(x) = Aeik1x + Be−ik1x ,
x < 0 ,
(8.25)
where k1 =
√
2mE/ℏ.
In region x ≥0 (we will call it region II), the potential V = V0.
Since E < V0, the parameter k2 is a negative number and, therefore,
the solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation in this region are of the

120
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
form
II.
φ2(x) = Cek2x + De−k2x ,
x ≥0 ,
(8.26)
where k2 = √2m(V0 −E)/ℏ.
Since the wave function must be ﬁnite everywhere and must
vanish as x becomes inﬁnite, the coeﬃcient C must be zero.
Otherwise, φ2(x) would go to inﬁnity as x →∞.
We will ﬁnd the coeﬃcients B and D in terms of A, using the
continuity conditions for the wave function, that at x = 0
φ1(0) = φ2(0) ,
dφ1(x)

(8.27)
The above continuity conditions lead to two coupled equations:
A + B = D ,
ik1A −ik1B = −k2D ,
(8.28)
which can be written as
A + B = D ,
A −B = iβD ,
(8.29)
where β = k2/k1. By adding these two equations, we obtain
2A = (1 + iβ)D ,
(8.30)
and by subtracting the equations, we ﬁnd
2B = (1 −iβ)D .
(8.31)
Thus, we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients B and D are given in terms of
A as
D =
2A
(1 + iβ) ,
B = (1 −iβ)
(1 + iβ) A = (1 −iβ)2
1 + β2
A .
(8.32)
Hence, the wave function of the particle with E < V0 is given by
φ1(x) = Aeik1x + (1 −iβ)2
1 + β2
Ae−ik1x ,
(8.33)
φ2(x) =
2A
(1 + iβ)e−k2x .
(8.34)
The coeﬃcient A can be found from the normalization condition.

Having the wave functions available, we can show that in both
regions, x < 0 and x > 0, the probability current ⃗J = 0.

(8.36)
where
γ = (1 −iβ)2

(8.37)

(8.48)
Thus, in both regions the probability current is zero.
The case: E > V0.
We now turn to the case in which the particles have energy larger
than the potential barrier. Since E > V0, one could expect that the
particles should travel freely from region I to region II. This is true in
classical mechanics, but it is not true in quantum mechanics. We will
show that a part of the particles can be reﬂected from the barrier.
First, we calculate the wave function of the particles. Since in
region II the energy E of the particles is larger than the potential
barrier, the parameter k2 is a positive number and, therefore, the
solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation in the two regions are of the
form
I.
φ1(x) = Aeik1x + Be−ik1x ,
x < 0
II.
φ2(x) = Ceik2x + De−ik2x ,
x ≥0 ,
(8.49)
where k1 =
√
2mE/ℏ, and k2 = √2m(E −V0)/ℏ.
The particles, after passing to region II, will continue to move to
the right with no reasons to turn back and move to the left, so we can
put D = 0 in the wave function φ2. Using the continuity conditions
for the wave function, we obtain two equations for the coeﬃcients
A, B, and C:
A + B = C ,
ik1(A −B) = ik2C ,
(8.50)
from which we ﬁnd that
B = 1 −β
1 + β A ,
C =
2
1 + β A ,
(8.51)
where β = k2/k1.

Potential Step
123
Thus, for E > V0, the wave function of the particles is given by
φ1(x) = Aeik1x + (1 −β)2
1 + β
Ae−ik1x ,
x < 0
(8.52)
φ2(x) =
2A
(1 + β)eik2x ,
x ≥0
(8.53)
and, as usual, the coeﬃcient A can be found from the normalization
condition.
It is interesting to calculate the probability current in both
regions, x < 0 and x > 0.
Consider ﬁrst the probability current in region I:

where

we obtain

(8.57)
Hence
J 1 = ℏ|A|2k1
2m
2(1 −u2) = ℏ|A|2k1
m
(1 −u2) .
(8.58)
In region II: x ≥0, the wave function of the particles is
φ2(x) =
2A
(1 + β)eik2x .
(8.59)
Thus,
dφ2
dx = 2ik2A
1 + β eik2x ,
(8.60)
and then
φ∗

dφ2
dx =

(1 + β)2 |A|2 .
(8.61)
Hence
J 2 =
4ℏk2
m(1 + β)2 |A|2 .
(8.62)

124
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
Since
1 −u2 =
4β
(1 + β)2 ,
(8.63)
we see that J 1 = J 2.
Note that the current in both regions is the same, as should be,
otherwise particles would be created or destroyed.
We can ﬁnd the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients.
For E < V0, it is obvious that the transmission coeﬃcient T = 0,
as the transmitted current is zero (see Eq. (8.48)).
The reﬂection coeﬃcient is
R = |B|2
|A|2 = (1 −iβ)2(1 + iβ)2
(1 + β2)2
= 1 .
(8.64)
Thus, the relation T + R = 1 is satisﬁed.
For E > V0, the transmission coeﬃcient is
T = k2|C|2
k1|A|2 =
4k2
k1(1 + β)2 =
4β
(1 + β)2 ,
(8.65)
and the reﬂection coeﬃcient is
R = |B|2
|A|2 = (1 −β)2
(1 + β)2 .
(8.66)
Note that T + R = 1 should be always satisﬁed.
It is interesting that the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients
are independent of the mass of the particles.
To show this, we rewrite the transmission and reﬂection
coeﬃcients in terms of the parameters E, m, and V0. Since
T =
4β
(1 + β)2 =
4k1k2
(k1 + k2)2 ,
R = (1 −β)2
(1 + β)2 = (k1 −k2)2
(k1 + k2)2 ,
(8.67)
we substitute for k1 and k2
k1 =
 
2mE
ℏ2
,
k2 =
 
2m(E −V0)
ℏ2
,
(8.68)
we ﬁnd
T =

R =

√

(8.69)

Potential Step
125
We see that the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients are
independent of the mass of the particles. They depend only on
E and V0. It is interesting—but someone can say very puzzling—
that in some situations, like quantum tunneling (see Eq. (8.125) in
Section 8.4), the coeﬃcients depend on the mass of the particle, but
in some situations, they do not depend on m.
An extra exercise
Just for fun, consider a similar problem as above, but now assume
that the particles of energy E > V0 are moving from +x to −x, as
shown in Fig. 8.5.
Figure 8.5
Potential step at x = 0. Particles of the total energy E > V0
travel from +x toward the potential step.
We expect that in the case of E > V0, the behavior of the particles
at the barrier should be the same, i.e., independent of the direction
of motion of the particles. Is it true?
In order to check it, consider the solutions to the wave function
in both regions. Since in both regions E > V0, the wave functions in
both regions are of the form of traveling waves
I.
φ2(x) = Ceik2x + De−ik2x ,
x ≤0 ,
II.
φ1(x) = Aeik1x + Be−ik1x ,
x > 0 ,
(8.70)
where k1 = √2m(E −V0)/ℏ, and k2 =
√
2mE/ℏ.

126
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
We can put D = 0, as we do not expect the particle to turn back
and move to the right in region I.
Using the continuity conditions for the wave function, we obtain
two equations for the coeﬃcients A, B, and C:
A + B = C ,
ik1(A −B) = ik2C ,
(8.71)
from which we ﬁnd that
B = 1 −β
1 + β A ,
C =
2
1 + β A ,
(8.72)
where β = k2/k1. Thus, the wave function of the particles is given by
φ1(x) = Aeik1x + (1 −β)2
1 + β
Ae−ik1x ,
x > 0
(8.73)
φ2(x) =
2A
(1 + β)eik2x ,
x ≤0
(8.74)
and the coeﬃcient A can be found from the normalization condition.
Note that the wave function (8.74) is the same as in Eq. (8.53).
Thus, nothing is changed physically in this problem. This conﬁrms
our expectation that the behavior of the particle at the barrier
should be the same, i.e., independent of the direction of motion of
the particle.
We can also ﬁnd the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients and
verify the relation T + R = 1.
Using the solutions to the coeﬃcients C and B , we ﬁnd that the
transmission coeﬃcient is
T = k2|C|2
k1|A|2 =
4k2
k1(1 + β)2 =
4β
(1 + β)2 ,
(8.75)
and the reﬂection coeﬃcient is
R = |B|2
|A|2 = (1 −β)2
(1 + β)2 ,
(8.76)
where β = k2/k1. Hence
T + R =
4β
(1 + β)2 + (1 −β)2
(1 + β)2 = (1 + β)2
(1 + β)2 = 1 .
(8.77)
Thus, the relation T + R = 1 is satisﬁed.
Note that the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients are the
same we found before for the case of the particle moving from −x
to +x. Thus, again we can conclude that the behavior of the particles
at the barrier is the same, i.e., independent of the direction of motion
of the particles.

Discussion Problem
Problem D3 We have already illustrated the phenomena of reﬂec-
tion and transmission of a group of particles acting on a potential
barrier. One can notice that these phenomena are independent
of the number of particles, so that the results may as well be
applied to a single particle. Then, an obvious question arises: how
to explain simultaneously that both the transmission and reﬂection
coeﬃcients of the particle are diﬀerent from zero? Does it mean that
a part of the particle is reﬂected and a part is transmitted?

8.3 Finite Square-Well Potential
The inﬁnite potential well, discussed in Section 8.1, is an idealized
example. More realistic problems in physics have ﬁnite energy
barriers, such as the step potential discussed in the preceding
section, or more complicated arrangements composed of two or
multiple potential steps. In such systems, one of the most interesting
diﬀerences between classical and quantum descriptions of behavior
of particles concerns the phenomenon of barrier penetration and
transmission of particles through the barrier from one region to
others.
Figure 8.7
Finite square-well potential.
In this chapter, we will consider a particle moving in a ﬁnite
square-well potential, as shown in Fig. 8.7:
I.
V (x) = V0 ,
x < −a

II.
V (x) = 0 ,
−a
2 ≤x ≤a

III.

(8.78)
In classical physics, a particle is trapped in the well if the energy
E of the particle is less than V0. In this case, the probability of ﬁnding
the particle outside the well is zero. When the energy E is larger

Finite Square-Well Potential
129
than V0, the particle can freely move in all three regions. Let us look
at these situations from the point of view of quantum physics.
Before proceeding to a rigorous calculation of the particle wave
function, we point out that in behavior of the particle in a ﬁnite
square-well potential, it must be recognized that the wave function
of the particle exists in all space, that all regions in space are
accessible for the particle even if the energy E is less than V0. We
have shown before that in the limit of V0 →∞, the wave function is
zero at the walls and in the region of inﬁnite potential. In the present
case, when the conﬁning potential has a ﬁnite value, the particle
wave function does not equal zero at the walls and can be diﬀerent
from zero in the regions where E < V0.
To obtain a rigorous solution to the wave function, we will
consider the Schr¨odinger equation for the wave function of the
particle in all three regions indicated in Fig. 8.7.
In region II, −a/2 ≤x ≤a/2, the potential V (x) = 0, and then
the Schr¨odinger equation reduces to
d2φ2(x)
dx2
= −k2
2φ2(x) ,
(8.79)
where k2
2 = 2mE/ℏ2, and φ2(x) is the wave function of the particle
in region II.
Since k2
2 is positive, the solution to Eq. (8.79) is of the form
φ2(x) = Aeik2x + Be−ik2x ,
(8.80)
that is, the same as for the particle in the potential well. Thus, we
expect that, similar to the case of the inﬁnite potential barrier, the
energy of the particle will be quantized in region II.
In regions I and III, the potential is diﬀerent from zero V (x) = V0,
and then
k2

In this case, the Schr¨odinger equation is given by

(8.82)
Solution to the above equation depends on the relation between V0
and E.
Consider separately two cases: E > V0 and E < V0.

130
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
8.3.1 The case E > V0
For E > V0, the parameter k2
1 is positive, and then the solution to
Eq. (8.82) in regions I and III is of the form
I. φ1(x) = Ceik1x + De−ik1x ,
III. φ3(x) = F eik1x + Ge−ik1x ,
(8.83)
indicating that the probability of ﬁnding the particle in regions I
and III is similar to that in region II. It is not diﬃcult to show that
in this case the energy spectrum of the particle is continuous in all
regions. Thus, one could conclude that there is nothing particularly
interesting about the solution when E
> V0. However, we may
obtain nonzero reﬂection coeﬃcient at the boundaries, which is a
quantum eﬀect. Classically, one would expect that the particle of
energy E > V0 should travel from region I to region III without any
reﬂection at the boundaries, and that the transmission coeﬃcient
should be unity, T = 1. It can be shown that only under a speciﬁc
condition, the transmission coeﬃcient becomes unity.a
8.3.2 The case E < V0
More interesting is the case of E
< V0, i.e., when the particles
have energy smaller than the potential barrier. When E < V0, the
parameter k2
1 is a negative real number. In this case, the solution
to Eq. (8.82) in regions I and III is in the form of nonoscillatory
exponential functions
φ1(x) = Cek1x + De−k1x ,
x < −a
2
φ3(x) = F ek1x + Ge−k1x ,
x > a
2 .
(8.84)
To get φ1(x) and φ3(x) ﬁnite for each |x| > a/2, in particular
at x →±∞, we have to choose D = F
= 0. Otherwise, the
wave function would be inﬁnite at x = ±∞. Hence, the acceptable
solutions to the wave function in regions I and III are
I. φ1(x) = Cek1x ,
for
x < −a
2
III. φ3(x) = Ge−k1x ,
for
x > a
2 .

aThe details of the calculations are left for the readers as a tutorial problem.

An example of the probability function of the particle inside the
potential well.
Assume for a moment that C, G ̸= 0. Then the probability density
|φ(x)|2 has interesting properties, as shown in Fig. 8.8.
Referring to Fig. 8.8, the most striking features of the wave
function φ(x) are the “tails” that extend outside the well. The
nonzero values of φ(x) outside the well mean that there is a nonzero
probability for ﬁnding the particle in regions I and III. In other
words, the reﬂection of the particle takes place within the barriers,
not at their surfaces.
Note that regions I and III are forbidden by classical physics
because the particle would have to have negative kinetic energy.
Since the total energy of the particle E < V0 and E = Ek + V0,
we have
Ek + V0 < V0
in the regions I and III .
(8.86)
Therefore, the penetration of the barrier is a quantum eﬀect
that has no classical analog. It is a strange eﬀect, which makes a
quantum mechanical penetration of the barrier to be regarded as a
paradoxical, controversial, nonintuitive aspect of quantum physics.
How far the particle can penetrate the barrier?
This depends on V0 and the mass of the particle. To show this,
consider the wave function in region III. In this case,
φ3(x) = Ge−k1x ,
x > a

Figure 8.9
The dependence of exp(−k1x) on x for two diﬀerent values of
k1.
Since the parameter k1 is a positive real number, it plays a role of
the damping coeﬃcient of the exponential function. For V0 ≫E, the
parameter k1 ≫1, and then the depth of penetration is very small
(vanishes for V0 →∞). For V0 ≈E, the parameter k1 ≈0, and
then the depth of penetration is very large. These two situations are
shown in Fig. 8.9.
The same arguments apply for the mass m of the particle. For a
heavy particle, m ≫1, the parameter k1 ≫1, and then the depth of
penetration is very small.
To prove that the penetration eﬀect really exists, we have to
demonstrate that the constants C and G are really nonzero.
To show this, we will turn to the details and carry out the
complete solution to the wave function of the particle.
We start from the general solution to the Schr¨odinger equation
for the wave function of the particle inside the square-well potential,
which is of the form:

solution to the constant C in terms of B. Thus, substituting Eq. (8.97)
into Eq. (8.90), we ﬁnd that
C =

134
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
Since B ̸= 0, as the particle exists inside the well, we have C ̸= 0,
indicating that there is a nonzero probability of ﬁnding the particle
in region I. The probability is given by |φ1(x)|2, that is
|φ1(x)|2 = |C|2e−2k1|x| ,
(8.99)
where |x| = −x for x < 0. Thus,
|φ1(x)|2 = |B|2

(8.100)
The probability is diﬀerent from zero and decreases exponen-
tially with the rate 2k1. The remaining constant |B| is found from
the normalization condition of φ(x).
We may conclude that even though the particle’s energy is
smaller than the value of V outside the well, there is still a deﬁnite
probability that the particle can be found outside the well.
8.3.3 Discrete Energy Levels
We now check whether the constant G is diﬀerent from zero and that
the particle can really be found in region III. The calculations will
also give us the condition for energies of the particle inside the well.
To ﬁnd G, we consider the continuity conditions at x = a/2. From
the symmetry of the system, we expect that the constant G, similar
to C, will be diﬀerent from zero and may be found in a similar way
as we have found the constant C.
However, from Eqs. (8.91) and (8.94), and using Eq. (8.97), we
ﬁnd two solutions to the constant G in terms of B:
Ge−1
2 ak1 = B

where
u = (iβ + 1)

(8.103)
Thus, we have two diﬀerent solutions to G. However, we cannot
accept both the solutions as it would mean that there are two
diﬀerent probabilities of ﬁnding the particle at a point x inside
region III. Therefore, we have to ﬁnd under which circumstances
these two solutions are equal.

We see from the relation ϵ = 1
2ak2 that determining ϵ, we can get
the energy E of the particle inside the well. To show this, we rewrite
Eq. (8.105) in terms of ϵ and ξ, and ﬁnd
ϵ tan ϵ =

ξ 2 −ϵ2 .
(8.109)
This is a transcendental equation, which cannot be solved
analytically, but it can be solved graphically as follows. Introducing
the notation
p(ϵ) = ϵ tan ϵ ,
q(ϵ) =

ξ 2 −ϵ2 ,
(8.110)
we ﬁnd solutions to the equation p(ϵ) = q(ϵ) by plotting separately
p(ϵ) and q(ϵ). The functions p(ϵ) and q(ϵ) are shown in Fig. 8.10.
The intersection points of the two curves give the solutions to the
equation p(ϵ) = q(ϵ). We see from the ﬁgure that the equation
p(ϵ) = q(ϵ) is satisﬁed only for discrete (ﬁnite) values of ϵ. Since the
energy E is proportional to ϵ, see Eq. (8.106), we ﬁnd that the energy
of the particle is quantized in region II, i.e., the energy spectrum is
discrete.

The number of solutions, which will give us the number of energy
levels, depends on ξ, but always is ﬁnite. We see from Fig. 8.10 that
we have
one solution
for
ξ < π ,
two solutions

Thus, ξ is determined by the dimensions of the well.
The number of energy levels that the well is capable of binding is
often called the “strength” of the well. It is interesting to note from
Fig. 8.10 that there must be at least one energy level inside the well
and that the number of energy levels can never be zero.
Exercise in Class
Find the number of energy levels and the allowed values of E in a
potential well with ξ = 4.

Since ξ = 4 < 2π, we see from Fig. 8.10 that in this case there
are two solutions to ϵ: ϵ1 = 1.25 and ϵ2 = 3.60. Thus, there are only
two energy levels inside the well.
Once we have the allowed values of ϵ, we can ﬁnd the allowed
values of the energy E. The calculations proceed in the following
way. Since

Fig. 8.11.

Problem D5 In the chapter, we have shown that the phenomenon of
penetration of the barrier would imply that the kinetic energy of the
particle in regions I and III is negative. As a consequence, the particle
would have an imaginary speed.
Attack this problem from the standpoint of Heisenberg uncer-
tainty principle and calculate the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of
the particle in regions I and III. Compare the uncertainty in Ek to the
amount of Ek; we expect it to be negative. How would you comment
on this result?

8.4 Quantum Tunneling
When the potential barrier has a ﬁnite width, an interesting eﬀect
can appear, that the particle with energy E < V0 can not only
penetrate the barrier, it can even pass through the barrier and
appear on the other side, as illustrated in Fig. 8.13.
This phenomenon is known as quantum tunneling. In solid state
physics, this phenomenon is often called cold emission.
How can we understand the process of a particle tunneling
through a seemingly impenetrable barrier? How large is the
probability that the particle passes through the barrier? To answer
these questions, we can use a wave picture of the particle. We have
already learned that the particle wave function does not terminate
abruptly at the edge of the barrier, but actually leaks out of the
barrier. As we will see, the tunneling eﬀect depends on the relation
between E and V0, mass m of the particle, and also on the thickness
of the barrier.

Rigorous calculations
The analytic formulation of the tunneling eﬀect can be obtained
simply as follows: Consider a particle of mass m and total energy E
moving from the left and acting on the rectangular potential barrier,
as shown in Fig. 8.13. Assume that E < V0. According to classical
physics, the particle cannot pass the barrier. What does the quantum
mechanics say about it?
According to quantum mechanics, the particle is determined
by the wave function, which exists in all three regions shown in
Fig. 8.13. The wave function is found from the Schr¨odinger equation,
whose solution for the three regions is

We now have four unknown coeﬃcients to evaluate. But we have
only two equations and a third from the normalization. However, if
we assume that particles travel from the left to the right, we can set
G = 0 as there is nothing in region III that could reﬂect particles

to show that
F

When E > V0, the solution changes only in region II. In this case,
the propagation constant k2 is imaginary, and the new solution can
be readily obtained from the above solution simply by replacing k2
by ik′
2, where k′
2 = √2m(E −V0)/ℏ. So that the expression for T
changes to
T =

.
(8.126)
First, note that if there is no barrier, V0 = 0, and then there is
100% transmission. Thus, there is nothing particularly remarkable
about the solution when V0 = 0. Its physical interest lies in what
happens when V0 ̸= 0.
For V0 ̸= 0, one could expect from the classical physics that there
is no transmission through the barrier, T = 0 for E < V0, and that
the transmission coeﬃcient T = 1 for E > V0. However, Eq. (8.125)
shows that T is not zero for E < V0 (nonzero transmission), and
Eq. (8.126) shows that T < 1 for E > V0 (nonzero reﬂection).
Thus, tunneling eﬀect for E < V0 and partial reﬂection at the
barrier for E > V0 are quantum phenomena. In the classical limit
of ℏ→0, the parameter k2 →∞, and then T →0. Hence, in the
classical limit, there is no possibility of the particle of an energy E <
V0 to pass the barrier. Moreover, since that k2 is proportional to the
mass of the particle, the transmission coeﬃcient (8.125) is large for
light particles and decreases with the increasing m.

Quantum Tunneling
143
There is a further interesting phenomenon for the case of E > V0.
One can see from Eq. (8.126) that if k′
2a = nπ, n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., the
transmission coeﬃcient becomes unity, T = 1, i.e., there is 100%
transmission from region I to region III. Otherwise, quantum eﬀect
(partial reﬂection) appears. The conditions at which there is 100%
transmission are called resonances. This phenomenon is analogous
to the behavior of coated lenses in optics. Another example is the
scattering of electrons by atoms, where it is observed that for
certain energies of the electrons, almost no scattering takes place,
i.e., the atom is almost transparent. These are real examples of the
transmission resonances, and in electron scattering by electrons, it
is known as the Townsend–Ramsauer eﬀect.
Remember: External potential (energy supply) is not required to
tunnel particles through the barrier. Quantum tunneling does not
use energy!
8.4.1 Applications of Quantum Tunneling
Quantum tunneling is important in the understanding of a number
of physical phenomena such as thermonuclear reactions and
conduction in metals and semiconductors. In 1928, Gamov, Condon,
and Gurney used quantum tunneling to explain the α-decay of
unstable nuclei, in which an alpha particle (a helium nucleus) is
emitted from a radioactive nucleus. The alpha particle has an energy
that is less than the high of the potential barrier keeping the particle
inside the nucleus. Nevertheless, alpha particles tunnel through the
barrier and are detected outside the nucleus.
Tunneling has also been used in a number of electronic devices.
One is a tunnel diode in which the current of electrons is controlled
by adjusting the energy E of the electrons. This changes the value of
k2 and thus the rate at which the electrons tunnel through the device.
The most advanced application of quantum tunneling is the
scanning tunneling microscope. A probe needle is held very close
(<1 nm) above a conducting object and scanned across it. The
object is at a positive voltage V with respect to the probe needle.
However, for electrons to pass from the needle to the object, they
have to overcome the work function of the needle material. This
creates a potential barrier through which electrons can tunnel. As

144
Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
they tunnel through the potential barrier, they generate a current
whose variation tells us about the distance between the needle and
the object.
Discussion Problem

of 120 eV. Find the probability that the electron will be found on the
other side of the barrier.

Challenging problem: Quantum tunneling from and into a
semi-ﬁnite well
In the problem discussed in the chapter, we have shown there are
no restrictions on the energy of a particle to tunnel through the
barrier. The explanation of this eﬀect is simple: The particle of an
arbitrary energy can tunnel through the barrier because there are
no restrictions on energies, which the particle can have in region III.
Let us consider the exercise from the preceding section—a rectan-
gular potential well of width a bounded by a wall of inﬁnite high on
one side and a barrier of high V0 and inﬁnite thickness on the other.
We have learned that inside the well in region I, a particle can have
only a limited number of discrete energies.
(a) Now imagine what happens if the thickness of the barrier
(region II) is ﬁnite and the particle of energy E < V0 is inside
the potential well. Do you expect that the energy levels of the
particle in region I are still discrete?

Applications of Schr¨odinger Equation
(b) Suppose that the particle of energy E < V0 is in region III on the
right of the barrier and moves toward the barrier, as shown in
Fig. 8.15.
Figure 8.15
Potential well of semi-inﬁnite depth.
Find the tunneling coeﬃcient and determine whether for each
E, in the range 0 < E < V0, the particle can tunnel to region I,
i.e., determine whether the energy spectrum in region I is discrete
or continuous. Would you expect this result without the detailed
calculations?

Chapter 9
Multidimensional Quantum Wells
In the last three chapters, we have learned about some strange
eﬀects that occur in the one-dimensional quantum world. We have
seen that particles conﬁned into a small region can have quantized
energies, can be found in “classically forbidden” region, and even
can tunnel through this region. Although the one-dimensional case
is very useful in the illustration and understanding of the quantum
eﬀects, we need a full three-dimensional treatment if we want to
illustrate applications of quantum mechanics to atoms, solid state,
nanotechnology, and nuclear physics. The application to atoms is
postponed for last because it is more diﬃcult and will be discussed
in a separate chapter on angular momentum and hydrogen atom
(Chapter 16).
In this chapter, we extend the concept of quantum wells
from one to three dimensions to see how particles behave in
a three-dimensional quantum world. We will consider properties
of particles conﬁned in two- and three-dimensional potential
structures called quantum wires and quantum dots. Determining
energies and corresponding wave functions requires some careful
analysis but is worth the trouble.
We can picture a quantum wire as a pipe, as shown in Fig. 9.1,
and particles moving freely along this pipe, just like water ﬂowing

through a pipe. However, we must be careful when using analogies
to describe quantum phenomena. We expect water to ﬂow along
the bottom of the pipe, but we would be surprised to see the water
ﬂowing through mid-air a few centimeters above the pipe ﬂoor. This
is precisely how the particles appear to behave in a quantum wire.
9.1 General Solution to the Three-Dimensional
Schr¨odinger Equation
Let us ﬁnd the stationary wave function of a particle located
inside a three-dimensional well and its energies. The readers will
immediately notice that the wave function and the energies are
found from the stationary three-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation
−ℏ2
2m∇2 + V  = E .
(9.1)
We see that in Cartesian coordinates, the operator ∂2/∂x2 in
the one-dimensional case is replaced in three dimensions by the
Laplacian
∇2 = ∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2 + ∂2
∂z2 .
(9.2)

General Solution to the Three-Dimensional Schr¨odinger Equation
149
Since x, y, z are independent (separable) variables, the wave
function is also separable into three independent functions x, y,
and z. In this case, we can ﬁnd the solution to the Schr¨odinger
equation in product form
(x, y, z) = x(x)y(y)z(z) .
(9.3)
Substituting this into the above Schr¨odinger equation and
dividing both sides by xyz, we obtain
−
ℏ2
2mx
d2x
dx2 −
ℏ2
2my
d2y
dy2 −
ℏ2
2mz
d2z
dz2 = E ,
(9.4)
where, as before, we have put V = 0 inside the well, but outside the
well we will set V = ∞as a boundary condition.
Since each term on the left-hand side of Eq. (9.4) is a function
of only one variable, each will be independent of any change in
the other two variables. Thus, Eq. (9.4) can be separated into three
independent equations. To illustrate this, we write this equation as
−
ℏ2
2mx
d2x
dx2 = E +
ℏ2
2my
d2y
dy2 +
ℏ2
2mz
d2z
dz2 .
(9.5)
The left-hand side involves all of the x dependence. If we change
x any way we want, the right-hand side is not aﬀected. Thus, it must
be that both sides are equal to a constant, say Ex:
−
ℏ2
2mx
d2x
dx2 = Ex ,
(9.6)
−
ℏ2
2my
d2y
dy2 −
ℏ2
2mz
d2z
dz2
= E −Ex .
(9.7)
Equation (9.7), which depends only on y and z variables, can be
written as
−
ℏ2
2my
d2y
dy2 = E −Ex +
ℏ2
2mz
d2z
dz2 .
(9.8)
Again, both sides depend on diﬀerent variables. The left-hand
side depends only on y and the right-hand side depends only on z;
thus, both sides are equal to a constant, say E y:
−
ℏ2
2my
d2y
dy2
= E y ,
(9.9)
−
ℏ2
2mz
d2z
dz2
= E −Ex −E y .
(9.10)

150
Multidimensional Quantum Wells
Hence, after the separation of the variables, the complicated
diﬀerential equation involving three variables has turned into three
independent equations of one variable each:
−
ℏ2
2mx
d2x
dx2 = Ex ,
(9.11)
−
ℏ2
2my
d2y
dy2
= E y ,
(9.12)
−
ℏ2
2mz
d2z
dz2
= Ez ,
(9.13)
where Ez = E −Ex −E y.
The wave function of the particle inside the well and its energies
are found from these three independent equations. The parameters
Ex, E y, and Ez are separation constants and represent energies of
motion along the three Cartesian axes x, y, and z. It is easy to see
that these three constants satisfy the equation
Ex + E y + Ez = E .
(9.14)
The solutions to Eqs. (9.11) and (9.12) are the same as that for
the inﬁnite square-well in one dimension and are given by
x = A sin
n1π
a x

,
n1 = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
(9.15)
y = B sin
n2π

n2 = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
(9.16)
with energies
Ex = n2
1
π2ℏ2
2ma2
and
E y = n2
2
π2ℏ2
2ma2 .
(9.17)
Thus, the energy of the particle is quantized in the x- and y-
directions.
It is worth noting how inevitably quantum numbers appear in
quantum theories of particles conﬁned (trapped) into a particular
region of space.
9.2 Quantum Wire
The solution to the z-component of the motion, Eq. (9.13), depends
on whether the z sides of the well have zero or inﬁnite potential. For

Quantum Dots
151
zero potential, the z-direction is free for the motion of the particle.
In this way we form a quantum wire. The z component of the wave
function is given by
z = Ceikzz ,
(9.18)
where k2
z = 2mEz/ℏ2 and Ez can have arbitrary values.
Thus, we conclude that for a quantum wire, the three-
dimensional wave functions of the particle are of the form
n1,n2 = D sin
n1π

with
n1, n2 = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
(9.20)
where D = ABC is a constant, which is found from the normalization
condition of the wave function, and Ez can be arbitrary. It is easy to
show that
D = 2

(9.21)
The proof of this formula is left as a tutorial problem for the
readers.
Interesting observation: Since the energy of the particle in the y-
direction can never be zero, the particle will never move at the ﬂoor
of the wire. Because the particle is conﬁned in two directions, it
has only one dimension of freedom. Therefore, a quantum wire is
sometimes referred to as a one-dimensional system.
9.3 Quantum Dots
Can we reduce the freedom of the particle still further? Yes, if the
potential at the z sides is inﬁnite, the particle is conﬁned in every
direction, so we have an example of quantum dot.a In this case, the
solution to Eq. (9.13) is the same as for the x and y components:
z = C sin
n3π
L z

,
n3 = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
(9.22)
aIt would be more correct to call the quantum dot a quantum box, but in many
calculations, quantum dots that have spherical symmetries are approximated by
rectangular boxes.

Ez = n2

(9.23)
Thus, for a quantum dot with L = a, the wave functions of the
particle inside the well are of the form


,
with
n1, n2, n3 = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
(9.25)
Notice that the energy of the particle in a quantum dot is
quantized in all three directions. Because the motion of the particle
is now restricted in every direction (quantum conﬁnement), the
particle has zero dimension of freedom. That is why a quantum dot
is often referred to as a zero-dimensional system. Quantum dots are
also regarded as artiﬁcial atoms.
An obvious question arises: Why are we interested in and what
do we achieve by producing such a structure?
Currently, most physicists say that nothing exciting can be done
with a single dot and it could have a little practical use. One can just
observe discrete energies of the conﬁned electron. This would only
be another conﬁrmation of the quantization of the energy. However,
if a single dot is located on a chip, a set of closely located dots, it could
have many practical uses. The set of quantum dots, composed into a
regular array, can behave as a single macroscopic device performing
a highly complex function. An electron located in one of the dots can
tunnel to another dot and this process can be controlled by varying
the energy levels in some of the dots. Thus, we can aﬀect and control
the ﬂow of the current through the device just by changing energies
of the dots. This is an example of an entirely diﬀerent class of devices
in which the current ﬂow is due to the wave behavior of electrons.
9.3.1 Degeneracy of Energy Levels
One can notice that the results obtained for the three-dimensional
case are similar to that obtained for the one-dimensional case.

Quantum Dots
153
However, there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between these two cases.
Notice from Eqs. (9.24) and (9.25) that in the three-dimensional
case, the wave function and the energy are speciﬁed by the trio
of integers (n1, n2, n3). Thus, there might be few wave functions
corresponding to the same energy. If it happens, we say that the
energy level is degenerate, and the number of degenerate states,
degeneracy.
We can illustrate this on a simple example of energies and the
corresponding wave functions of a quantum dot:
The lowest energy state (the ground state), for which n1 = n2 =
n3 = 1, has energy
E = 3π2ℏ2
2ma2 ,
(9.26)
and there is only one wave function (singlet) corresponding to this
energy. We say that the level has degeneracy 1.
However, for the ﬁrst excited energy level, there are three wave
functions corresponding to energy
E = 6π2ℏ2
2ma2 ,
(9.27)
as there are three combinations of n1, n2, and n3 whose squares
sum to 6. These combinations are (n1 = 2, n2 = 1, n3 = 1),
(n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n3 = 1), and (n1 = 1, n2 = 1, n3 = 2). The three
wave functions corresponding to this energy and speciﬁed by the
three combinations are 2,1,1, 1,2,1, and 1,1,2. In this case, we say
that the level has degeneracy 3.
An interesting observation: It is easy to notice from Eq. (9.25) that
the degeneracy of the energy levels is characteristic of quantum
wells whose sides are of equal lengths. The degeneracy can be lifted,
if the sides of the well were of unequal lengths.
Revision Question
Quantum physics predicts that a particle can behave in unusual
ways, which are regarded as nonclassical or quantum eﬀects without
classical analog.

Chapter 10
Linear Operators and Their Algebra
We leave the stationary Schr¨odinger equation for a few chapters
to learn some operator techniques and state representations
commonly used in quantum physics. We have seen that in quantum
physics, it is frequently required to calculate energy and momentum
of a particle, which are represented by energy and momentum
operators, respectively. In this chapter, we will extend the idea of
representing physical as well as nonphysical quantities by operators
and collect together some frequently used operator techniques. We
will postulate that any quantity in quantum physics is speciﬁed by a
linear operator.
An operator ˆA is linear if for arbitrary functions fi and gi, and
arbitrary complex numbers ci, such that
ˆA f1 = g1
and
ˆA f2 = g2 ,
the linear superposition is
ˆA (c1 f1 + c2 f2) = c1 ˆA f1 + c2 ˆA f2 = c1g1 + c2g2 .

Linear Operators and Their Algebra
10.1 Algebra of Operators
Let ˆA and ˆB are two linear operators. The sum and product of the
two operators ˆA and ˆB are deﬁned as
 ˆA + ˆB

f = ˆA f + ˆB f ,
(10.2)
 ˆA ˆB

f = ˆA
 ˆB f

.
(10.3)
The operators obey the following algebraic rules:
1.
ˆA + ˆB = ˆB + ˆA ,
(addition commutes) ,
2.
ˆA + ˆB + ˆC =
 ˆA + ˆB

4.
 ˆA + ˆB
 ˆC = ˆA ˆC + ˆB ˆC ,
(distributive law) .
(10.4)
The power of an operator and the sum of two operators are deﬁned
as
1.
ˆA2 = ˆA ˆA ,
ˆA3 = ˆA ˆA ˆA ,
etc.
2.

2 =
 ˆA + ˆB
  ˆA + ˆB

= ˆA2 + ˆB2 + ˆA ˆB + ˆB ˆA .
(10.5)
In a manipulation with operators, it is very important to maintain
the order of the operators because operator algebra is not in general
commutative for multiplication. For example, ˆA ˆB ̸= ˆB ˆA in general
and then
 ˆA + ˆB
2 ̸= ˆA2 + ˆB2 + 2 ˆA ˆB ,
(10.6)
as in standard mathematics.
An important concept in quantum physics is a commutator. For
two operators ˆA and ˆB, the commutator is deﬁned as
 ˆA, ˆB

= ˆA ˆB −ˆB ˆA ,
(10.7)
and says that two operators commute if
 ˆA, ˆB

= 0 .
(10.8)
We can also deﬁne anti-commutator as
% ˆA, ˆB
&
≡
 ˆA, ˆB

+ = ˆA ˆB + ˆB ˆA ,
(10.9)
and we say that two operators anti-commute if
 ˆA, ˆB

+ = 0 .

Inverse operator: The inverse of an operator ˆA, if it exists, is deﬁned
by

where ˆ1 is the unit operator deﬁned by
ˆ1 f = f .
(10.12)
Hermitian adjoint: (Hermitian conjugate)
Operator ˆA† is the Hermitian adjoint of an operator ˆA if for two
functions f and g that vanish at inﬁnity

f ∗ˆAgdV =

∗gdV .
(10.13)
There are several important properties of Hermitian conjugate.
Property 1:
 ˆA†† = ˆA.
Proof:

f ∗ˆAgdV =

∗gdV =

Introducing the notation ˆB f = u, we get

∗gdV =

u∗ˆA†gdV =
  ˆB f
∗ˆA†gdV
=

f ∗ˆB† ˆA†gdV .
(10.16)
Thus,
 ˆA ˆB
† = ˆB† ˆA†, as required.

160
Linear Operators and Their Algebra
The above rules of operator algebra show that it is important
to maintain the order of the factors because operator algebra is
not in general commutative for multiplication. Many commonly
used results in mathematics are generally not valid for operators
since these are based on the assumption that multiplication is
commutative. For example, the simple identity written for operators
e ˆAe ˆB = e( ˆA+ ˆB)
(10.17)
is true only if ˆA and ˆB commute. The proof of this identity is left as a
tutorial problem for the readers.
10.2 Hermitian Operators
We now turn to deﬁne a special class of operators called Hermitian
operators. They are distinguished by the relationship of ˆA and
ˆA†. The Hermitian operators are of great importance in quantum
physics, as they represent physical (measurable) quantities.
Deﬁnition
Operator ˆA is called Hermitian if
ˆA† = ˆA ,
(10.18)
i.e., when

f ∗ˆAgdV =
  ˆA f
∗gdV .
(10.19)
In other words, an operator is Hermitian if the Hermitian
conjugate is equal to the operator itself.
10.2.1 Properties of Hermitian operators
There are several important properties of Hermitian operators.
If ˆA and ˆB are Hermitian, then
Property 1. ˆA + ˆB is Hermitian.
Property 2. ˆA2, ˆA3, etc. are Hermitian.

Property 3. c ˆA is Hermitian if c is a real number.
Proof of property 3:

f ∗
c ˆA

gdV =
 
c ˆA f
∗gdV = c∗
  ˆA f
∗gdV ,
(10.20)
as required.
Property 4. The product ˆA ˆB of two Hermitian operators is Her-
mitian only if ˆA and ˆB commute.
Proof:
 ˆA ˆB
† = ˆB† ˆA† = ˆB ˆA .
(10.21)
Hence, ( ˆA ˆB)† ̸= ˆA ˆB, unless ˆA and ˆB commute, as required.
Property 5. From property 4, we ﬁnd that the commutator
 ˆA, ˆB

is
not Hermitian, even if ˆA and ˆB are Hermitian.
Proof:
 ˆA, ˆB
† =
 ˆA ˆB −ˆB ˆA
† =
 ˆA ˆB
† −
 ˆB ˆA

= ˆB† ˆA† −ˆA† ˆB† = ˆB ˆA −ˆA ˆB = −
 ˆA, ˆB

, (10.22)
as required.
Example
Commutator of the position and momentum operators
[ˆx, ˆpx] = iℏ.
(10.23)
The commutator of the two Hermitian operators is a complex
number (nonphysical number).
Property 6. The commutator i
 ˆA, ˆB

is Hermitian.
The proof is left to the readers.

Property 7. For an arbitrary not necessary Hermitian operator ˆA,
the product ˆA ˆA† is Hermitian.
Proof: Take the Hermitian conjugate of ˆA ˆA†:
 ˆA ˆA†† =
 ˆA†† ˆA† = ˆA ˆA† ,
(10.24)
as required.
Property 8. If ˆA is non-Hermitian, ˆA + ˆA† and i
 ˆA −ˆA†
are
Hermitian. Hence, the operator
ˆA can be written as a linear
combination of two Hermitian operators:
ˆA = 1

10.2.2 Examples of Hermitian Operators
Example 1. Position operator ˆ⃗r is Hermitian.
Proof:
Since |⃗r| is a real number and ˆ⃗rg is just a multiplication of the
function g by the vector ⃗r, we have

(10.26)
as required.
Example 2. Potential ˆV (⃗r) is Hermitian.
It is easy to prove. Since ˆ⃗r is Hermitian, an arbitrary function of ⃗r is
also Hermitian.

10.3 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
We have deﬁned before the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the
Hamiltonian of a particle (see Section 7.2). The idea of eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions can be extended to arbitrary operators. Thus, we
can state: If
ˆA = α ,
(10.30)
then  is an eigenfunction of ˆA with eigenvalue α.
Example
Determine if the function 
=
e2x is an eigenfunction of the
operators (a) ˆA = d/dx, (b) ˆB = ()2, and (c) ˆC =

dx.
Solution
(a) Operating on the wave function  with the operator ˆA, we obtain
ˆA = d
dx e2x = 2e2x = 2 ,
(10.31)
which is a constant times the original function. Therefore,  = e2x
is an eigenfunction of the operator ˆA = d/dx with an eigenvalue
α = 2.
Solutions to the parts (b) and (c) are left to the readers.

10.3.1 Eigenvalues of Hermitian Operator
As we have already stated, Hermitian operators play an important
role in quantum physics as they represent physical quantities
(observables). We put this fact as a theorem.
Theorem: Eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real.

10.4 Scalar Product and Orthogonality of Wave Functions
In this chapter, we will deﬁne a very important property of wave
functions: orthogonality. This property, for example, allows to
identify whether the given wave functions belong to the same
operator or not.
We say that two functions 1(⃗r) and 2(⃗r) are orthogonal if
 +∞
−∞
∗
1(⃗r)2(⃗r)dV = 0 .
(10.33)
The orthogonality condition of two functions is analogous to
the orthogonality condition of two vectors. We know from basic
mathematics that vectors are orthogonal when the scalar product
of the vectors is zero. In analogy, we can write a scalar product of
two functions as

i,  j

=

∗
i (⃗r) j(⃗r)dV = ajδi j ,
(10.34)
where aj is a positive constant and δi j is the Kronecker delta
function.

Scalar Product and Orthogonality of Wave Functions
165
When aj = 1, we say that the functions are orthonormal.
The complex functions i form a complex linear vector space.
The inﬁnite-dimensional vector space of orthonormal functions is
called Hilbert space.
The scalar product
(i, i) = ||i|| =

|i|2 dV ,
(10.35)
where i is a square integrable function, is called the norm of
the state (vector) . For a state function that represents physical
quantity, the norm is ﬁnite. If the functions are orthonormal, the
norm ||i|| = 1.
Example of orthogonal functions: Typical examples of orthogonal
functions are sine and cosine functions. Their product with any
other function of the same class gives zero when integrated over all
ranges of variable, unless the two multiplied functions are identical.

(10.37)
 2π

(10.38)
The above orthogonality properties are readily proved by direct
integration.
From the orthogonality of the sine functions, we see that the
eigenfunctions of a particle in an inﬁnite square-well potential,
Eq. (8.22), corresponding to diﬀerent energies (n
̸=
m) are
orthogonal.
Having available the deﬁnition of orthogonal functions, we can
proceed to formulate an important property of eigenfunctions of a
linear Hermitian operator.
Theorem: Eigenfunctions of a linear Hermitian operator be-
longing to diﬀerent eigenvalues are orthogonal.

166
Linear Operators and Their Algebra
Proof:
Consider a Hermitian operator ˆA. Let f and g be two eigenfunctions
of
ˆA corresponding to two diﬀerent eigenvalues α f
and αg,
respectively:
ˆA f = α f f ,
ˆAg = αgg ,
(10.39)
where α f , αg are real numbers.
Since
 ˆA f
∗= α f f ∗, we can write
  ˆA f
∗gdV −

f ∗ ˆAg

dV =

α f −αg
 
f ∗gdV .
(10.40)
However
  ˆA f
∗gdV =

f ∗ ˆAg

dV ,
(10.41)
and therefore the left-hand side of Eq. (10.40) vanishes. Since, α f ̸=
αg, we have
( f, g) =

f ∗gdV = 0 ,
(10.42)
as required.
10.5 Expectation Value of an Operator
In classical physics, an expectation or average or mean value of
an arbitrary quantity A is obtained by weighting each measured
value Ai by the associated probability Pi and summing over all the
measurements N. Thus,
⟨A⟩=

i
Pi Ai
i = 1, 2, . . . , N ,
(10.43)
where Pi is a probability of measuring the value Ai.
How do we calculate expectation values in quantum physics?

exists, then the scalar product

Expectation Value of an Operator

is called the expectation or average or mean value of the operator ˆA
in the state i.
Similarly, as in classical physics, the expectation value can be
calculated from the probability density as

ˆAρ(⃗r)dV =

ˆA |i|2 dV =

(10.45)
where the order of the factors under the integral is not important.

Thus, expectation value of the operator ˆB can depend on time
even if the operator does not depend explicitly on time (∂ˆB/∂t = 0).
When [ ˆH , ˆB] = 0, we have d⟨ˆB⟩/dt = 0, and then the expectation
value is constant in time. In analogy to classical physics, we call ⟨ˆB⟩
a constant of motion.

Since cos(2nπ) = cos 0 = 1, and sin(2nπ) = sin 0 = 0, we ﬁnd that
⟨x⟩= 1

independent of n! Physically, this value results from the fact that the
wave function of the particle is symmetric about x = a/2 for all n.
Note the expectation value is not equal to the most probable value,
which is given by |φ(x)|2.
10.5.2 Useful General Property of Hermitian Operators

operators are real. In terms of the scalar product of two orthonormal
functions, this is characterized by


170
Linear Operators and Their Algebra
The properties (10.48) and (10.49) are very often used to
check whether operators are Hermitian. The following example will
illustrate the procedure.
Worked Example
Consider two operators ˆA = d/dx and ˆB = d2/dx2 acting on two
orthonormal wave functions 1 = a sin(nx) and 2 = a cos(nx),
where n is a real number, a = 1/√π and x ∈⟨−π, π⟩.
Are the operators ˆA and ˆB Hermitian?
Solution
First, consider the operator ˆA = d/dx. Since
ˆA1 = a d
dx sin(nx) = an cos(nx) = n2 ,
(10.50)
and
ˆA2 = a d
dx cos(nx) = −an sin(nx) = −n1 ,
(10.51)
we ﬁnd the following values of the scalar products

1, ˆA1

= −n (1, 2) = 0 ,

1, ˆA2

= −n (1, 1) = −n ,

2, ˆA2

= −n (2, 1) = 0 ,

2, ˆA1

= n (2, 2) = n .
(10.52)
Hence

1, ˆA1

=

2, ˆA2
∗,
(10.53)
but

1, ˆA2

= −an ̸=

2, ˆA1
∗= an .
(10.54)
Thus, the operator ˆA = d/dx is not Hermitian.

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Revisited
171
Consider now the operator ˆB = d2/dx2. Since
ˆB1 = a d2
dx2 sin(nx) = −an2 sin(nx) = −n21 ,
(10.55)
and
ˆB2 = a d2
dx2 cos(nx) = −an2 cos(nx) = −n22 ,
(10.56)
we ﬁnd the following values of scalar products

1, ˆB1

= −n2 (1, 1) = −n2 ,

1, ˆB2

= −n2 (1, 2) = 0 ,

2, ˆB2

= −n2 (2, 2) = −n2 ,

2, ˆB1

= −n2 (2, 1) = 0 .
(10.57)
Hence

1, ˆB1

= −n2 =

2, ˆB2
∗,
(10.58)
and

1, ˆB2

= 0 =

2, ˆB1
∗.
(10.59)
Thus, the operator ˆB = d2/dx2 is Hermitian.

10.6 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Revisited
In Section 6.6, we have shown that the uncertainties in the position
and momentum of a particle satisfy the relation
ypy = h .
(10.60)
This relation says that the position and momentum of a particle
cannot be measured simultaneously with the same precision. This is
known as the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, or the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, and we will show that the relation is a direct

172
Linear Operators and Their Algebra
consequence of the noncommutivity of the position and momentum
operators

ˆy, ˆpy

= iℏ.
(10.61)
In fact, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation can be formulated for
arbitrary two Hermitian operators that do not commute. In other
words, if ˆA and ˆB are two Hermitian operators that do not commute,
the physical quantities represented by the operators cannot be
measured simultaneously with the same precision.
Theorem: The variances ⟨( ˆA)2⟩= ⟨ˆA2⟩−⟨ˆA⟩2 and ⟨( ˆB)2⟩=
⟨ˆB2⟩−⟨ˆB⟩2 of two Hermitian operators satisfy the inequality
⟨( ˆA)2⟩⟨( ˆB)2⟩≥−1
4⟨[ ˆA, ˆB]⟩2 ,
(10.62)
which is called the Heisenberg inequality.
Proof: First, we prove that for an arbitrary operator ˆA, the following
inequality holds:
⟨ˆA ˆA†⟩≥0 .
(10.63)
It is easy to prove the above inequality using the deﬁnition of the
expectation value:
⟨ˆA ˆA†⟩=

∗ˆA ˆA†dV =
  ˆA†
∗ˆA†dV =
  ˆA†
2 dV ≥0.
(10.64)
Now we prove that for two Hermitian operators, the following
inequality is satisﬁed:
⟨ˆA2⟩⟨ˆB2⟩≥−1
4⟨[ ˆA, ˆB]⟩2 .
(10.65)
To prove it, we introduce an operator
ˆD = ˆA + iz ˆB ,
(10.66)
where z is an arbitrary real number. Hence, from Eq. (10.63), we ﬁnd
⟨ˆD ˆD†⟩= ⟨( ˆA + iz ˆB)( ˆA −iz ˆB)⟩
= ⟨ˆA2⟩−iz(⟨ˆA ˆB −ˆB ˆA⟩) + z2⟨ˆB2⟩≥0 .
(10.67)
This inequality is satisﬁed when
−⟨ˆA ˆB −ˆB ˆA⟩2 −4⟨ˆA2⟩⟨ˆB2⟩≤0 .
(10.68)
Hence
⟨ˆA2⟩⟨ˆB2⟩≥−1
4⟨[ ˆA, ˆB]⟩2 ,
(10.69)
as required.

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Revisited
173
Finally, since
[ ˆA,  ˆB] = [ ˆA, ˆB] ,
(10.70)
where  ˆU = ˆU −⟨ˆU ⟩, ( ˆU = ˆA, ˆB), and replacing in Eq. (10.69),
ˆA → ˆA and ˆB → ˆB, we obtain the Heisenberg uncertainty
relation (10.62), as required.
Some of the practical applications of the Heisenberg uncertainty
relation are illustrated in the following examples.
Worked Example
The Heisenberg uncertainty relation for the position and momentum
operators.
Since the position and momentum operators satisfy the commuta-
tion relation
[ˆx, ˆpx] = iℏ,
(10.71)
we obtain by substituting into Eq. (10.62), ˆA = ˆx and ˆB = ˆpx
⟨(ˆx)2⟩⟨( ˆpx)2⟩≥1
4ℏ2 ,
(10.72)
or in terms of the standard deviations (ﬂuctuations)
δxδpx ≥1
2ℏ,
(10.73)
where δx =

⟨(ˆx)2⟩and δpx =

⟨( ˆpx)2⟩.
Similarly, we can show that for the y- and z-components of the
position and momentum
δyδpy ≥1
2ℏ
and
δzδpz ≥1
2ℏ.
(10.74)
Note that Eq. (10.60) satisﬁes the Heisenberg inequality as h >
ℏ/2.
The uncertainty relations (10.73) and (10.74) show one of the
strange quantum behavior. The particle can never truly be at rest.
Even in its lowest energy state, at a temperature of absolute zero,
its position and momentum are still subject to ﬂuctuations, called
quantum ﬂuctuations.

174
Linear Operators and Their Algebra
Worked Example
The Heisenberg uncertainty relation for the components of the
electron spin.
Since the components of the electron spin satisfy the commuta-
tion relationa
[ ˆσx, ˆσy] = 2i ˆσz ,
(10.75)
where ˆσx, ˆσy, ˆσz are the operators corresponding to the three
components of the electron spin, we obtain
⟨( ˆσx)2⟩⟨( ˆσy)2⟩≥⟨ˆσz⟩2 ,
(10.76)
or
δσxδσy ≥|⟨ˆσz⟩| .
(10.77)
The uncertainty relation (10.77) shows that the components of
the electron spin cannot be measured simultaneously with the same
precision. Again, we face a strange quantum behavior. The spin of the
electron, even at a temperature of absolute zero, exhibits quantum
ﬂuctuations.
10.7 Expansion of Wave Functions in the Basis of
Orthonormal Functions
Orthonormal wave functions are very useful in quantum physics,
in particular those of Hermitian operators. They can be employed
to represent an arbitrary wave function. In other words, we may
expand an arbitrary wave function in the basis of orthonormal
functions. This is a very useful property of orthonormal functions,
which, similar to the orthogonality, arises from the properties of
vectors. The reason of using expansions is that it is more convenient
to perform any calculations and mathematical operations on
orthonormal functions, whose properties are completely known,
rather than on non-orthogonal or not completely determined
functions.
aThe proof of the commutation relation is left to the readers as a tutorial problem.

Expansion of Wave Functions in the Basis of Orthonormal Functions
175
To illustrate this procedure, consider a simple example: In the
Cartesian coordinates, an arbitrary vector ⃗A can be written as a
linear combination of the orthonormal unit vectors
⃗A = (⃗i · ⃗A)⃗i + (⃗j · ⃗A)⃗j + (⃗k · ⃗A)⃗k ,
(10.78)
where ⃗i, ⃗j, and ⃗k are unit vectors in the directions x, y, and z,
respectively.
Proof: We know from the vector analysis that in the Cartesian
coordinates, an arbitrary vector ⃗A may be presented in terms
of components Ax, Ay, Az, and three unit vectors oriented in the
directions of the coordinate axis
⃗A = Ax⃗i + Ay⃗j + Az⃗k .
(10.79)
Since the components are the projections of ⃗A on the coordinate axis
Ax = ⃗i · ⃗A ,
Ay = ⃗j · ⃗A ,
Az = ⃗k · ⃗A ,
(10.80)
we ﬁnd that the vector (10.79) can be written in the form
⃗A = (⃗i · ⃗A)⃗i + (⃗j · ⃗A)⃗j + (⃗k · ⃗A)⃗k ,
(10.81)
as required.
We can extend this property to m-dimensional space and state
that an arbitrary vector ⃗A can be written as a linear combination
of the coordinate (basis) orthogonal unit vectors ⃗e as
⃗A =

⃗e1 · ⃗A

⃗e1 +

⃗e2 · ⃗A

⃗e2 + . . . +

⃗em · ⃗A

⃗em =
m

n=1

⃗en · ⃗A

⃗en ,
(10.82)
where (⃗en · ⃗A) is the scalar product of ⃗en and ⃗A, (nth component of
⃗A), and ⃗ei · ⃗ej = δi j.
The norm (magnitude) of the vector ⃗A is
||⃗A||2 = |⃗A| =

n

⃗en · ⃗A
2
.
(10.83)
Thus, we see that an arbitrary vector can be expressed as a linear
combination of the orthonormal vectors ⃗en.
The same ideas carry over to the space of wave functions. Namely,
an arbitrary wave function  can be expanded in terms of
orthonormal wave functions n as
 =

n
cnn ,
(10.84)

176

(discrete spectrum of n), or in the case of a continuous spectrum of
n
(⃗r) =

cn(⃗r)n(⃗r)dVn ,
(10.85)
where cn are arbitrary (unknown) expansion coeﬃcients, and dVn
is the volume element of the space the orthonormal functions n(⃗r)
are spanned.
We can ﬁnd the coeﬃcients cn(⃗r) by multiplying Eq. (10.85) by
∗
m(⃗r) and integrating over all space as follows:

∗
m(⃗r)(⃗r)dV =

cn(⃗r)

∗
m(⃗r)n(⃗r)dV dVn = cm(⃗r) ,
(10.86)
where we have used the orthonormality property of the n functions

∗
m(⃗r)n(⃗r)dVn = δnm .
(10.87)
In general, the coeﬃcients cm(⃗r) are complex numbers and
are called the components of the function  in the basis of the
orthonormal functions m. The components determine the function
completely, and very often the coeﬃcients cm(⃗r) are called a
representation of the wave function  in the basis m.
The coeﬃcients cm(⃗r) satisfy the following relation:

V
|cm(⃗r)|2 dV = 1 .
(10.88)
Proof: Multiplying Eq. (10.85) by ∗(⃗r) and integrating over V , we
obtain

V
∗(⃗r)(⃗r)dV =

V
|(⃗r)|2 dV

Dirac Bra-Ket Notation
Dirac introduced a very useful (compact) notation of state vectors
(wave functions) i in terms of “bra” ⟨i| and “ket” |i⟩vectors. This
notation allows to make the formal expressions of quantum physics
more transparent and easier to manipulate.
For example, a wave function i can be expressed by a ket vector
|i⟩, and ∗
i by a bra vector ⟨i|. This notation can be further
simpliﬁed to |i⟩and ⟨i|, respectively.
Let us illustrate what kind of simpliﬁcations we will get using the
Dirac notation.
In the Dirac notation, a scalar product is written as

i,  j

= ⟨i| j⟩= ⟨i| j⟩,
(11.1)
which is called a bracket.
We note in the bracket expression the double vertical bar is
dropped in favor of a single one.
For orthonormal vectors, we have used the notation

i,  j

=
δi j, which in the Dirac notation takes the form ⟨i| j⟩= δi j.
Since

i,  j

=

 j, i
∗, we have in the Dirac notation ⟨i| j⟩=
⟨j|i⟩∗.
In the bra-ket notation, the deﬁnition of the Hermitian adjoint
becomes
⟨i| ˆA| j⟩=

⟨j| ˆA†|i⟩

Dirac Bra-Ket Notation
or
⟨j| ˆA†|i⟩= ⟨i| ˆA| j⟩∗.
(11.3)
Thus, for a Hermitian operator,
⟨i| ˆA| j⟩= ⟨j| ˆA|i⟩∗.
(11.4)
Expectation value of an operator ˆA in a state |i⟩is given by ⟨i| ˆA|i⟩.
We write a linear superposition of ket states as
|a⟩=

n
λn|n⟩,
discrete states
(11.5)
or
|a⟩=

λ(x)|x⟩dx .
continuous states
(11.6)
The bra-ket notation also extends to action of operators on state
vectors.
A linear operator ˆA associates with every ket |i⟩another ket | j⟩:
ˆA|i⟩= | j⟩,
(11.7)
such that
ˆA (|a⟩+ |b⟩) = ˆA|a⟩+ ˆA|b⟩,
and
ˆAλ|a⟩= λ
 ˆA|a⟩

,
(11.8)
where λ is a number.
Hermitian conjugate of ˆA|i⟩is ⟨i| ˆA†.
An arbitrary ket state |a⟩can be expanded in terms of
orthonormal ket states as
|a⟩=

n
cn|n⟩.
(11.9)
Since |n⟩are orthonormal (⟨m|n⟩= δmn), we get for cn:
⟨n|a⟩=

m
cm⟨n|m⟩=

m
cmδnm = cn .
(11.10)
Thus, we can write the ket state |a⟩as
|a⟩=

n
|n⟩⟨n|a⟩,
(11.11)
from which we ﬁnd a useful property of the orthonormal ket states

n
|n⟩⟨n| = ˆ1 ,
(11.12)
where ˆ1 is the unit operator.

Projection Operator
183
The product ket-bra (|n⟩⟨n|) is called a projection operator, and
the relation (11.12) is called the completeness relation.
The product |n⟩⟨n| is not a product of two functions in the normal
sense. It is a dyadic product: the function |n⟩“stands” at the function
⟨n|.
The completeness relation is very useful in quantum physics as
it provides signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations in calculations involving oper-
ators and state vectors. Examples will be presented in Section 11.2;
see also Tutorial Problem 11.1.
11.1 Projection Operator
In general, we can deﬁne projection operator of two diﬀerent bra-ket
states as
ˆPmn = |m⟩⟨n| .
(11.13)
The term “projection” results from a speciﬁc property of this
operator, that it projects an arbitrary state vector |a⟩onto the ket
state |m⟩:
ˆPmn|a⟩= |m⟩⟨n|a⟩,
(11.14)
i.e., the result of its action is the state |m⟩with the amplitude ⟨n|a⟩.
When m = n, the projection operator reduces to a diagonal
form ˆPnn, which satisﬁes the relation
ˆP 2
nn = ˆPnn .
(11.15)
It is easy to prove. Since ⟨n|n⟩= 1, we have
ˆP 2
nn = ˆPnn ˆPnn = |n⟩⟨n|n⟩⟨n| = ˆPnn .
(11.16)
Thus, the square of ˆPnn equals itself.
Another important property of the projection operator:
The operator ˆPnn is Hermitian, but ˆPmn, (m
̸=
n) is not
Hermitian.
The proof is straightforward. First note that
⟨i| ˆPmn| j⟩= ⟨i|m⟩⟨n| j⟩= δimδnj .
(11.17)
Then, we have ⟨m| ˆPmn|n⟩= 1. However, ⟨n| ˆPmn|m⟩= 0, and then
⟨m| ˆPmn|n⟩̸=

⟨n| ˆPmn|m⟩
∗.
(11.18)
Thus, the operator ˆPmn, (m ̸= n) is not Hermitian.

11.2 Representations of Linear Operators
The projection operator and the completeness relation are very
important quantities in quantum physics. They are very useful
in calculations and are often employed to represent an arbitrary
operator and a wave function (state) in terms of orthonormal states.
As we have already seen, the reason of employing representations
is that it is more convenient to perform any calculations and
mathematical operations on orthonormal functions, whose proper-
ties are completely known, rather than on non-orthogonal or not
completely determined functions. To illustrate the procedure of
representations, we will consider an arbitrary operator ˆA and will
show how to represent the operator in terms of projection operators
of known orthonormal states |m⟩.
To arrive at a representation of the operator ˆA in the basis of the
orthonormal states |m⟩, we make use of the completeness relation
by multiplying the operator ˆA on both sides by unity in the form
1 =

m
|m⟩⟨m| .
(11.19)
This gives
ˆA =

m
|m⟩⟨m|

ˆA

|n⟩⟨n|

m,n

m,n
⟨m| ˆA|n⟩|m⟩⟨n| =

m,n
Amn ˆPmn ,
(11.20)
where Amn = ⟨m| ˆA|n⟩are numbers, which are interpreted as matrix
elements of the operator ˆA in the basis of the states |m⟩.
Thus, this simple application of the completeness relation shows
that an arbitrary operator can be written (represented) as a linear
combination of projection operators ˆPmn of the known orthonormal
states |m⟩. The following example illustrates the concept just
introduced.
Worked Example
Consider an operator ˆA = d2/dx2. Write the operator in terms
of projection operators involving the two lowest energy states of a
particle in an inﬁnite well potential.

Representations of an Expectation Value
185
Solution
We have found before in Section 8.1.2 that the two lowest energy
states of a particle in an inﬁnite well potential are orthonormal and
are given by
|1⟩= φ1(x) =
 
2
a sin
π
a x

,
|2⟩= φ2(x) =
 
2
a sin
2π
a x
	
.
According to Eq. (11.20), an arbitrary operator
ˆA can be
represented in the basis |1⟩, |2⟩as
ˆA = A11|1⟩⟨1| + A12|1⟩⟨2| + A21|2⟩⟨1| + A22|2⟩⟨2| ,
where Amn = ⟨m| ˆA|n⟩, (m, n = 1, 2) are the matrix elements of the
operator. Since
ˆA|1⟩= d2

ˆA|2⟩= d2

|2⟩,
and the states |1⟩and |2⟩are orthonormal, we easily ﬁnd that
A11 = −
π
a
2
,
A22 = −
2π
a
	2
,
A12 = A21 = 0 .
Thus, in the basis of the orthonormal states |1⟩, |2⟩, the operator
ˆA is represented in terms of the projection operators as
ˆA = −
π
a
2
(|1⟩⟨1| + 4|2⟩⟨2|) .
11.3 Representations of an Expectation Value
We have learned that an arbitrary state |a⟩can be expanded in terms
of orthonormal states |n⟩:
|a⟩=

n
cn|n⟩.
(11.21)

186
Dirac Bra-Ket Notation
We will apply this expansion to ﬁnd a representation of an
expectation value ⟨ˆA⟩of an operator ˆA in terms of the orthonormal
states |m⟩. Using Eq. (11.21), we can write the expectation value as
⟨ˆA⟩= ⟨a| ˆA|a⟩=

m,n
⟨n| ˆA|m⟩c∗
ncm .
(11.22)
If |m⟩is an eigenfunction of ˆA, i.e., ˆA|m⟩= Am|m⟩, then
⟨ˆA⟩=

m,n
c∗
ncmAmδmn =

n
An |cn|2 .
(11.23)
Thus, the modulus square of the expansion coeﬃcients is the
probability that the quantity described by the operator ˆA is in the
state |n⟩.
As ⟨ˆA⟩is a weighted sum of the eigenvalues, this suggests that the
eigenvalues represent the possible results of measurement, while
|cn|2 is the probability that the eigenvalue An will be obtained as the
result of any individual measurement.
Thus, in quantum physics, even if a given system is in its
eigenstate, the measurement is not certain.
This is in contrast to classical physics. In classical physics, the
measurement of a physical quantity at any time always leads to a
deﬁnite result. In quantum physics, the measurement of the physical
quantity at any time leads to a range of possible results, each
occurring with a certain probability. In this sense, quantum physics
is probabilistic.
Results of any measurement in physics are real numbers. Since
eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real, we postulate that every
physical quantity that is measurable is speciﬁed in quantum physics
by a linear Hermitian operator ˆA, which is also called an observable.
In quantum physics, the set of possible measured values for a
physical quantity is the set of eigenvalues of a linear Hermitian
operator specifying the physical quantity.
Example
As an example of this procedure, let us consider a particle speciﬁed
by a wave function a, or in the Dirac notation, by |a⟩. Let ˆH

Representations of an Expectation Value
187
be the Hamiltonian (energy) of the particles and |n⟩are known
eigenfunctions of ˆH .
If |a⟩is an eigenfunction of ˆH , then
ˆH |a⟩= Ea|a⟩,
(11.24)
where Ea is the eigenvalue (energy) of the particle. Thus, Ea =
⟨a| ˆH |a⟩.
If |a⟩is not an eigenfunction of ˆH , then we can expand |a⟩in
terms of the eigenfunctions |n⟩as
|a⟩=

n
cn|n⟩,
(11.25)
and ﬁnd that
⟨a| ˆH |a⟩=

n
En |cn|2 .
(11.26)
Hence, the measurement of energy of the particle in the state |a⟩
leads to a range of possible results, each occurring with probability
|cn|2. Thus, |cn|2 is the probability that the measurement of ˆH will
give the value En.
Since, |a⟩=  cn|n⟩, we say that the state of the particle is a
superposition of the eigenfunctions of ˆH .

Chapter 12
Matrix Representations
We have already learned that an arbitrary operator can be
represented in a basis of orthonormal states as a linear combination
of projection operators. In this chapter, we will illustrate how
one can obtain a matrix representation of a state vector, an
operator, and an eigenvalue equation in a basis of orthonormal
states. We will learn that matrix representations are very useful
in calculations of the properties of operators, because algebra of
matrices is very simple and completely developed. Readers familiar
with the algebra of matrices agree that mathematical operations on
matrices such as multiplication by a scalar, addition, subtraction,
multiplication and diagonalization are simple and easy to perform.
In fact, the application of the algebra of matrices to quantum physics
results from the direct relations between operators and matrices
that any mathematical relation that holds between operators also
holds between the corresponding matrices. The eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the matrix representing a given operator ˆA in the
basis of orthonormal states are the same as the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of ˆA.

12.1 Matrix Representation of State Vectors
Using an orthonormal basis, we can represent an arbitrary normal-

|a⟩=

n
cn|n⟩,
(12.1)
where, in general, the coeﬃcients cn are complex numbers, and

n |cn|2 = 1.
The set of the expansion coeﬃcients c1, c2, . . . deﬁnes the state
|a⟩and is called the representation of |a⟩in the basis of the
orthonormal states |n⟩.
We can write the set of the coeﬃcients cn as a column (ket) vector

linear operator ˆA as
|b⟩= ˆA|a⟩.
(12.4)
Let
|a⟩=

(12.7)
Thus, the scalar product (m, ˆAn), or ⟨m| ˆA|n⟩represents a
matrix element of the operator ˆA in the orthonormal basis |n⟩. The
matrix representing the operator is a square matrix of dimension
n × n.
The above procedure is very general and is applicable to any
operator and an arbitrary orthonormal basis.
The following example will illustrate the introduced procedure
of ﬁnding the matrix representation of a given operator in a given
orthonormal basis.
Worked Example
Find the matrix representation of the operator ˆA = d/dx in the
basis of two orthonormal states 1 = a sin(nx) and 2 = a cos(nx),
where a = 1/√π and x ∈⟨−π, π⟩.
Solution
Since
ˆA1 = d
dx a sin(nx) = n2 ,
ˆA2 = d
dx a cos(nx) = −n1 ,
(12.8)

192
Matrix Representations
we ﬁnd that the matrix elements of the operator
ˆA in the
orthonormal basis 1, 2 are

1, ˆA1

= n (1, 2) = 0 ,

1, ˆA2

= −n (1, 1) = −n ,

2, ˆA2

= −n (2, 1) = 0 ,

2, ˆA1

= n (2, 2) = n .
(12.9)
Hence, the matrix representation of the operator ˆA = d/dx in the
basis of two orthonormal states 1 = a sin(nx) and 2 = a cos(nx)
is
ˆA =
 0 −n
n 0
	
.
(12.10)
We can solve this problem in a more elegant way using the Dirac
notation.
Denote
|1⟩= a sin(nx) ,
|2⟩= a cos(nx) .
(12.11)
Since
ˆA|1⟩= n|2⟩,
ˆA|2⟩= −n|1⟩,
(12.12)
the operator ˆA written in the basis |1⟩, |2⟩, has the form
ˆA = n (|2⟩⟨1| −|1⟩⟨2|) .
(12.13)
Hence
⟨1| ˆA|1⟩= 0 ,
⟨2| ˆA|2⟩= 0 ,
⟨1| ˆA|2⟩= −n ,
⟨2| ˆA|1⟩= n .
(12.14)
Note that the operator ˆA is not Hermitian
ˆA† = n (|1⟩⟨2| −|2⟩⟨1|) = −ˆA ,
(12.15)
and, therefore, we can further conclude that the states |1⟩, |2⟩are
not the eigenfunctions of ˆA.

Matrix Representation of Eigenvalue Equations
193
12.3 Matrix Representation of Eigenvalue Equations
We have seen that if we know the explicit forms of an operator ˆA
and a ket vector |a⟩, we can easily determine whether the vector |a⟩
is an eigenvector of the operator ˆA. Namely, the ket vector |a⟩is an
eigenvector of a linear operator ˆA if the ket vector ˆA|a⟩is a constant
α times |a⟩, i.e.,
ˆA|a⟩= α|a⟩.
(12.16)
The complex constant α is called the eigenvalue and |a⟩is the
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue α.
In many practical situations, however, we know the explicit
form of an operator ˆA, but we do not know explicit forms of the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator. Then one can ask: Can
we ﬁnd the explicit forms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
operator ˆA?
We do ﬁnd the explicit forms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
We use the fact that an arbitrary vector |a⟩can always be
expressed in terms of a linear superposition of arbitrary, but known,
orthonormal vectors |n⟩. Since |a⟩=  cn|n⟩, we can write the
eigenvalue equation as
ˆA|a⟩=

n
cn ˆA|n⟩= α

Using the completeness relation to the left-hand side of
Eq. (12.17), we get

Matrix Representations
The left-hand side of Eq. (12.21) is the product of a column vector
composed of the elements cn and a matrix composed of the elements
Amn. Thus, we can write Eq. (12.21) in the matrix form as

This is a matrix eigenvalue equation.
The following conclusions arise from the matrix eigenvalue
equation:
1. When the matrix ¯Amn is diagonal, i.e., Amn = 0 for m ̸= n,
the orthonormal states |n⟩are the eigenstates of the operator
ˆA with eigenvalues αn = Ann.
2. If the matrix
¯Amn is not diagonal, then we can ﬁnd the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ˆA diagonalizing the matrix ¯Amn.
The eigenvalues are obtained from the characteristic equation

This is of the form of a polynomial equation of degree n and shows
that n eigenvalues can be found from the roots of the polynomial.
For each eigenvalue αi found by solving the characteristic equation,
the corresponding eigenvector is found by substituting αi into the
matrix equation.
The following example will help to understand the procedure of
ﬁnding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given operator.

Matrix Representation of Eigenvalue Equations

Worked Example
Consider the example from Section 12.2. In the matrix representa-
tion, the operator ˆA = d/dx has the form given in Eq. (12.10). Since
the matrix is not diagonal, the orthonormal states 1 and 2 are not
eigenstates of the operator ˆA. We can ﬁnd the eigenstates of ˆA in
terms of linear superpositions of the states 1 and 2, simply by the
diagonalization of the matrix (12.10).
We start from the eigenvalue equation, which is of the form
0 −n
n 0
	  c1
c2
	
= α
 c1
c2
	
.
(12.24)
First, we solve the characteristic equation

−α −n
n −α
 = 0 ,
(12.25)
from which we ﬁnd two eigenvalues α1 = +in and α2 = −in.
For α1 = in, the eigenvalue equation takes the form
0 −n
n 0
	  c1
c2
	
= in
 c1
c2
	
,
(12.26)
from which, we ﬁnd that
−nc2 = inc1
⇒
c1 = ic2 .
(12.27)
Hence, the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue α1 is of
the form
α1 =
ic2
c2
	
= c2
 i
1
	
.
(12.28)
From the normalization of α1, we get
1 =

α1, α1

= |c2|2 (−i, 1)
 i
1
	
= 2 |c2|2 .
(12.29)
Thus, the normalized eigenfunction corresponding to the eigen-
value α1 is given by
α1 =
1
√
2
 i
1
	
,
(12.30)
which may be written as
α1 =
1
√
2π
[i sin(nx) + cos(nx)] =
1
√
2π
einx .
(12.31)

196
Matrix Representations
Similarly, we can easily show that the normalized eigenfunction
corresponding to the eigenvalue α2 is of the form
α2 =
1
√
2π
[−i sin(nx) + cos(nx)] =
1
√
2π
e−inx .
(12.32)
In the Dirac notation, the normalized eigenvectors can be written
in a compact form as
|α1⟩=
1
√
2
(i|1⟩+ |2⟩) ,
|α2⟩=
1
√
2
(−i|1⟩+ |2⟩) .
(12.33)
The physical interpretation of the superposition states (12.33) is
as follows: The eigenfunctions |α1⟩and |α2⟩in the form of the linear
superpositions tell us that, e.g., with the probability 1/2, the system
described by the operator ˆA is in the state |1⟩or in the state |2⟩.
In summary of this chapter, we have learned that
(1) In quantum physics, an arbitrary wave function may be
represented by a normalized column vector of expansion
coeﬃcients in the basis of orthonormal states.
(2) In an orthonormal basis, an arbitrary operator ˆA may be
represented by a matrix, whose elements Amn are given by
scalar products (m, ˆAn).
(3) Using an orthonormal basis, an eigenvalue equation of an
arbitrary operator may be written in a matrix form. In this
case, the problem of ﬁnding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
operator reduces to a simple problem of diagonalization of the
matrix.

Chapter 13
Spin Operators and Pauli Matrices
It is well known from atomic spectroscopy and in particular from
the Stern–Gerlach experiment that electrons have a nonzero angular
momentum (spin) and that there exist only two kinds of electrons
with spin ℏ/2 or −ℏ/2. An external ﬁeld or force cannot change the
value of the electron spin; they can only change the orientation of
the spin in space. This means that the projection of the spin on any
of the coordinate axis is always equal to ±ℏ/2. In this chapter, we will
derive the Pauli matrices, the matrix representation of the spin. We
will also demonstrate how the two kinds of spin can be represented
in terms of spin up and spin down operators.
For convenience, the spin of the electron can be written as
⃗S = 1
2ℏ⃗σ,
(13.1)
where from now the new operator ⃗σ will be called the spin operator.
From the above relation, we see that the eigenvalues of the operator
⃗σ are +1 and −1.
Note that the magnitude of ⃗σ, i.e., σ 2 = ⃗σ · ⃗σ = 1. Thus, for any
direction in the cartesian coordinates
σ 2
x = σ 2
y = σ 2
z = 1.
(13.2)
Since the spin is an angular momentum of the electron, it should
satisfy the commutation relations for the components of the angular

momentum
[σi, σ j] = 2iei jkσk.
i, j, k = x, y, z.
(13.3)
Using Eqs. (13.2) and (13.3), we ﬁnd that
2i(σyσz + σzσy) = σy(2iσz) + (2iσz)σy
= σy(σxσy −σyσx) + (σxσy −σyσx)σy
= σyσxσy −σx + σx −σyσxσy = 0.
(13.4)
In the same way, we can show that
2i(σxσy + σyσx) = 0,
2i(σzσx + σxσz) = 0.
(13.5)
These results show that the components of the spin anti-
commute:
[σi, σ j]+ = 0,
i ̸= j,
i, j = x, y, z.
(13.6)
13.1 Matrix Representation of the Spin Operators: Pauli
Matrices
We wish to ﬁnd the matrix representation of the spin operators.
To solve this problem, we use the conditions imposed on the
spin components, the commutation and anti-commutation relations,
Eqs. (13.3) and (13.6).
Note ﬁrst that the trace of the matrices is zero.
Tr σi = 0,
i = x, y, z.
(13.7)
Proof: Using Eqs. (13.2) and (13.6), we ﬁnd
Tr σi = Tr σiσkσk = −Tr σkσiσk = −Tr σiσkσk = −Tr σi,
(13.8)
which is satisﬁed only when Trσi = 0. In the proof, we have used the
cycling property of the trace that TrABC = TrBC A.
Our problem may now be stated as follows: Obtain the matrix
representation of the spin components such that in the basis of the
spin states, spin “up” |2⟩and spin “down” |1⟩, the component σz is
represented by a diagonal matrix
σz =
1 0
0 −1
	
.
(13.9)

Matrix Representation of the Spin Operators
201
Then, what form are the matrices of the other components, σx
and σy? To answer this question, consider the operator σx, which
written in the basis |2⟩and |1⟩has a general matrix form
σx =
a22 a21
a12 a11
	
,
(13.10)
where ai j are unknown matrix elements that we have to determine.
In order to determine the matrix elements, we use the anti-
commutation relations (13.6), from which we ﬁnd that
0 = σzσx + σxσz = 2
a22
0
0 −a11
	
,
(13.11)
which means that a11 = a22 = 0.
Since the spin operator is Hermitian, as it represents an
observable (physical quantity), so then the components of the spin
are also Hermitian. Thus, we have that
σx =
 0 a21
a12 0
	
=
 0 a21
a∗
21 0
	
.
(13.12)
If we take the square of σx, we get
σ 2
x =
a21a∗
21
0
0
a∗
21a21
	
=
 |a21|2
0
0
|a21|2
	
= 1.
(13.13)
Hence |a21|2 = 1, so that a21 = eiα, where α is an arbitrary real
number.
Thus, the component σx may be written in the matrix form as
σx =
 0
iα
e−iα 0
	
.
(13.14)
Similarly, for σy, we may show that
σy =
 0
iβ
e−iβ 0
	
.
(13.15)
In order to determine α and β, we apply the above matrices to
the anti-commutation relation, and ﬁnd
0 = σxσy + σyσx =
ei(α−β) + e−i(α−β)
0
0
e−i(α−β) + ei(α−β)
	
= 2
 cos(α −β)
0
0
cos(α −β)
	
.
(13.16)

202
Spin Operators and Pauli Matrices
This means that
cos(α −β) = 0,
(13.17)
which is met if
α −β = (2n + 1)π
2 ,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(13.18)
If we choose the simplest values for n and α: n = 0 and α = 0, we
then have β = −π/2. Hence, the matrices σx and σy take the form
σx =
0 1
1 0
	
,
σy =
 0 −i
i 0
	
.
(13.19)
Thus, the components of the spin can be represented by matrices
σx =
0 1
1 0
	
,
σy =
 0 −i
i 0
	
,
σz =
1 0
0 −1
	
,
(13.20)
called the Pauli matrices.
The Pauli matrices have many interesting properties. For
example, the reader may immediately notice from Eq. (13.20) that
the trace of the matrices is zero. The detailed study of the other
properties of the Pauli matrices is left for the reader as a tutorial
problem (see Tutorial Problem 13.4).
13.2 Spin “Up” and Spin “Down” Operators
The operators ˆσx, ˆσy, and ˆσz representing the components of the
electron spin can be written in terms of the spin raising and spin
lowering operators σ + and σ −as
ˆσx = ˆσ + + ˆσ −,
(13.21)
ˆσy =

ˆσ + −ˆσ −
/i,
(13.22)
ˆσz = ˆσ + ˆσ −−ˆσ −ˆσ +.
(13.23)
Let |1⟩and |2⟩be the two eigenstates of the electron spin. The
raising and lowering operators satisfy the following relations:
ˆσ +|1⟩= |2⟩,
ˆσ −|1⟩= 0,
(13.24)
ˆσ +|2⟩= 0,
ˆσ −|2⟩= |1⟩.
(13.25)
The relations explicitly illustrate where the meaning of the spin
raising and lowering comes from. The operator σ + turns the “down”
spin into the “up” spin. In other words, it raises the spin. The
operator σ −acts in the opposite direction. It turns the “up” spin into
the “down” spin, that it lowers the spin.

Problem 13.3 Matrix representation of the spin operators
The operators ˆσx, ˆσy, and ˆσz representing the components of the
electron spin can be written in terms of the spin raising and spin
lowering operators σ + and σ −as

ˆσy =

ˆσ + −ˆσ −
/i ,
ˆσz = ˆσ + ˆσ −−ˆσ −ˆσ + .
Let |1⟩and |2⟩be the two eigenstates of the electron spin with
the eigenvalues −ℏ/2 and +ℏ/2, respectively, as determined in
the Stern–Gerlach experiment. The raising and lowering operators
satisfy the following relations:
ˆσ +|1⟩= |2⟩,
ˆσ −|1⟩= 0 ,
ˆσ +|2⟩= 0 ,
ˆσ −|2⟩= |1⟩.
Using these relations, ﬁnd the matrix representations (the Pauli
matrices) of the operators ˆσx, ˆσy, and ˆσz in the basis of the states |1⟩

is what the readers could expect as the operators represent a
physical (measurable) quantity, the electron spin.
(b) Show that the operators ˆσx, ˆσy, ˆσz each has eigenvalues +1, −1.
Determine the normalized eigenvectors of each. Are |1⟩and |2⟩

Chapter 14
Quantum Dynamics and Pictures
We have already learned that to ﬁnd the evolution of a physical
system, we have to specify how state vectors and operators of a given
system evolve in time. In this chapter, we will demonstrate how one
can ﬁnd the time evolution of the operators from the knowledge of
the time evolution of the state vector, and vice versa. We introduce a
unitary operator and discuss the concept of a unitary transformation
to show how one could transfer the time dependence from the
state vectors to the operators. The possibility that either the state
vectors or the operators can depend explicitly on time will lead us
to introduce the Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg, and interaction pictures.
We will discuss the fundamental diﬀerences between these pictures.
Finally, we discuss the Ehrenfest theorem, which shows under
which conditions quantum mechanics predicts the same results for
measured physical quantities as classical physics.

where ˆHt ≡ˆH (⃗r, t). If the Hamiltonian is independent of time, i.e.,
ˆHt = ˆH , the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation (14.1) is of the
form
|(⃗r, t)⟩= e−i ˆH
ℏ(t−t0)|(⃗r, t0)⟩≡ˆU (t, t0)|(⃗r, t0)⟩,
(14.2)
where
ˆU (t, t0) = e−i ˆH
ℏ(t−t0),
(14.3)
is a unitary time-evolution operator.
A unitary operator should satisfy the following property:
ˆU (t, t0) ˆU †(t, t0) = 1, where ˆU †(t, t0) is the adjoint operator of
ˆU (t, t0). For ˆU (t, t0) of the form (14.3), we use the Taylor expansion
and ﬁnd
ˆU (t, t0) ˆU †(t, t0) = e−i ˆH

(14.4)
In a similar way, we can show that
ˆU †(t, t0) ˆU (t, t0)
=
1.
Obviously, ˆU (t0, t0) = 1.
In addition, ˆU (t, t0) satisﬁes the transitive feature
ˆU (t, t1) ˆU (t1, t0) = ˆU (t, t0).
(14.5)
Proof: According to the solution (14.2), we can write for an arbitrary
t > t1 > t0:
|(⃗r, t)⟩= ˆU (t, t1)|(⃗r, t1)⟩= ˆU (t, t1) ˆU (t1, t0)|(⃗r, t0)⟩.
(14.6)
Since |(⃗r, t)⟩= ˆU (t, t0)|(⃗r, t0)⟩, we have that ˆU (t, t1) ˆU (t1, t0) =
ˆU (t, t0).
The state vector (14.2) is given in terms of the initial state
|(⃗r, t0)⟩. If we know the eigenstates |φn⟩of the Hamiltonian ˆH ,

then we can use the completeness relation for the eigenstates,

n |φn⟩⟨φn| = 1, and write the state (14.2) in terms of |φn⟩as

where cn = ⟨φn|(⃗r, t0)⟩is the probability amplitude that at time
t = 0, the system was in the state |φn⟩.
14.2 Unitary Transformation of State Vectors
We can make an arbitrary unitary transformation of the state vector
|(⃗r, t)⟩to a “new” state vector, which will depend on a diﬀerent
time or to a state vector independent of time. For example, if we
make a transformation
ˆU †(t, t0)|(⃗r, t⟩= |(⃗r, t)⟩T ,
(14.8)
the new “transformed” vector |(⃗r, t)⟩T is independent of time. It is
easy to see. If we use the result (14.7), we readily ﬁnd
|(⃗r, t)⟩T = ˆU †(t, t0)|(⃗r, t)⟩=

(14.9)
The transformed vector is equal to the initial vector |(⃗r, t0)⟩.
We can make unitary transformations not only of the state
vectors but also the Schr¨odinger equation. In other words, if we
know the Schr¨odinger equation for the state vector |(⃗r, t)⟩, we can
ﬁnd the evolution of motion of the transformed state vector. To show
this, we start from the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (14.1)
and using the fact that |(⃗r, t)⟩= ˆU |(⃗r, t)⟩T , we ﬁnd

where ˆHT
=
ˆU † ˆHt ˆU −ˆH . We see that the transformed state
satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation with the eﬀective (transformed)
Hamiltonian ˆHT .
14.3 Unitary Transformation of Operators
Let us now illustrate unitary transformations of an arbitrary
operator ˆA(t), which can depend explicitly on time.
Consider the mean value of the operator ⟨ˆA(t)⟩= ⟨(t)| ˆA(t)
|(t)⟩and a transformed operator ˆA′(t) = ˆU † ˆA(t) ˆU . We can make
unitary transformations of mean values of the operator. For example,
the mean value of the transformed operator is
T ⟨(t)| ˆA′(t)|(t)⟩T =⟨(t)| ˆU ˆU † ˆA(t) ˆU ˆU †|(t)⟩=⟨(t)| ˆA(t)|(t)⟩.
(14.15)
We see that the mean value of the transformed operator is the same
as the mean value of ˆA(t).
We can also make a transformation of the equation of motion for
the operator ˆA(t). Calculate a time derivative of ˆA′(t) and ﬁnd

(14.16)
where
ˆH ′
=
ˆU † ˆH ˆU . An important conclusion arises from
Eq. (14.16). We see that the transformed operator ˆA′(t) depends on
time even if the operator ˆA(t) does not depend explicitly on time
(∂ˆA(t)/∂t = 0), unless the commutator [ ˆH ′, ˆA′] = 0, and then ˆA′(t)
is independent of time.
We have shown that the evolution of the transformed state
|(t)⟩T depends on whether the Hamiltonian of a given system
depends explicitly on time or not. There could be situations where
the state vector of a given system depends on time but the operators
of the system are independent of time, and vice versa. Thus,
we can distinguish diﬀerent cases, which are called “pictures.”
Depending on whether states or operators depend explicitly on
time, we distinguish three pictures: the Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg,
and interaction pictures.
14.4 Schr¨odinger Picture
Consider a system whose Hamiltonian ˆHt is independent of time, i.e.,
ˆHt =
ˆH . In this case, only the state vector depends on time. The
dependence arises from the fact that the wave function satisﬁes the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ∂
∂t|(⃗r, t)⟩= ˆH |(⃗r, t)⟩,
(14.17)
whose solution is of the form
|s(⃗r, t)⟩= e−i ˆH
ℏ(t−t0)|(⃗r, t0)⟩.
(14.18)

210
Quantum Dynamics and Pictures
A situation where the operators are independent of time but
the state vectors depend explicitly on time is called the Schr¨odinger
picture. In Eq. (14.18), the subscript “s” indicates that the evolution
of the system is described in the Schr¨odinger picture that the
wave function depends explicitly on time and the operator ˆH is
independent of time.
14.5 Heisenberg Picture
When the state vectors of a given system are independent of time,
but the operators depend on time, we call it the Heisenberg picture.
For example, if in Eq. (14.14), the Hamiltonian ˆHt is independent of
time, i.e., ˆHt = ˆH then ˆHT = 0, which results in
iℏ∂
∂t|(⃗r, t)⟩T = 0.
(14.19)
Thus, the transformed state vector is independent of time.
Consider now the evolution of an operator. Let us introduce a
time-independent operator ˆA and its unitary transformation ˆA′(t) =
ˆU † ˆA ˆU . We have already seen, Eq. (14.16), that the transformed
operator depends explicitly on time as it satisﬁes the Heisenberg
equation of motion

ˆA′(t) = i
ℏ
 ˆH ′, ˆA′
.
(14.20)
The state vector |(⃗r, t)⟩T and the operator ˆA′(t) are called,
respectively, the state vector and the operator in the Heisenberg
picture (|(⃗r, t)⟩T ≡|H (⃗r, t)⟩, ˆA′(t) = ˆAH (t)).
In summary, in the Heisenberg picture, the state vectors are
independent of time, whereas operators depend explicitly on time
and satisfy the Heisenberg equation of motion

ˆAH (t) = i

(14.21)
Note that the transition from the Schr¨odinger to the Heisenberg
pictures is in fact the transfer of the time dependence from the state
vectors to the operators. It should be pointed out that the transfer
of the time dependence does not change measured quantities such

as averages. For example, the average value of an operator ˆA in the
Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures has the same value
⟨s(⃗r, t)| ˆA|s(⃗r, t)⟩= T ⟨(⃗r, t)| ˆU † ˆA ˆU |(⃗r, t)⟩T
= ⟨H (⃗r, t)| ˆAH (t)|H (⃗r, t)⟩. (14.22)
Worked Example
Find the Heisenberg equations of motion for the position ˆx and
momentum ˆpx operators of a single particle of mass m moving in
one dimension in a potential energy ˆV (x).
Solution
The Hamiltonian of the particle moving in one dimension is given by
ˆH = 1
2m ˆp2
x + ˆV (x),
(14.23)
and we have the well-known commutation relations
[ˆx, ˆpx] = iℏ,
 ˆV (x), ˆx

= 0,
 ˆV (x), ˆpx

= iℏ∂ˆV (x)
∂x
.
(14.24)
Assuming that the operators ˆx and ˆpx do not depend explicitly
on time, we have the following equation of motion for the position
operator:

(14.25)
Hence
ˆpx = md ˆx

(14.26)
Notice that the Heisenberg equation of motion for the position
operator is analogous to the classical equation
px = mdx
dt .

second law

(14.29)
where Fx is the force acting on the particle.
14.6 Interaction Picture
We have already demonstrated that when the Hamiltonian of a given
system is independent of time, either the states or operators can
depend explicitly on time. We have distinguished those two cases,
respectively, as the Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures. We have
also seen that the time dependence can be transferred, using a
unitary transformation, from the vectors to the operators, and vice
versa.
When, however, the Hamiltonian ˆHt depends explicitly on time,
the situation is more complicated that both the state vectors and
operators can, in general, depend simultaneously on time and there
is no unitary transformation that could transfer them to either the
Schr¨odinger or Heisenberg pictures.
In many situations in physics, it is possible to write the time-
dependent Hamiltonian ˆHt as a sum of two terms
ˆHt = ˆH0 + ˆV (t),
(14.30)
in which only the second term ˆV (t) depends explicitly on time.
In particular, this can happen in composite systems composed of
two or more subsystems. Usually, in this case the time-dependent
part of the Hamiltonian represents the interaction energy between
subsystems.
In this case, we can deﬁne a unitary operator involving only the
time-independent part of the Hamiltonian
ˆU0(t, t0) = e−i
ℏˆH0(t−t0),
(14.31)

Interaction Picture
213
and a transformed state
|I (t)⟩≡|(t)⟩T = ˆU †
0(t, t0)|s(t)⟩.
(14.32)
Using this transformation, we can transform the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation for |s(t)⟩, given in the Schr¨odinger picture,
into a time-dependent equation for the state vector |I(t)⟩, which
we shall call the Schr¨odinger equation in the interaction picture.
Beginning from Eq. (14.14), which is the Schr¨odinger equation for
the transformed state and using Eq. (14.30), we get
iℏ∂
∂t|I(t)⟩=

ˆU †
0
 ˆH0 + ˆV (t)
 ˆU0 −ˆH0

|I (t)⟩.
(14.33)
Since ˆU †
0 ˆH0 ˆU0 = ˆH0, we then have
iℏ∂
∂t|I(t)⟩= ˆU †
0 ˆV (t) ˆU0|I (t)⟩= ˆVI (t)|I(t)⟩,
(14.34)
where ˆVI (t) = ˆU †
0 ˆV (t) ˆU0. Hence, the evolution of the state vector
|I (t)⟩is solely determined by the time-dependent part of the
Hamiltonian, the interaction part ˆV (t). For this reason, the vector
|I (t)⟩is called the state vector in the interaction picture.
When, for example, ˆVI does not depend explicitly on time, we can
write
|I(t)⟩= ˆU I (t, t0)|I (t0)⟩,
(14.35)
where
ˆU I (t, t0) = e−i
ℏˆVI (t−t0)
(14.36)
is the evolution operator in the interaction picture. Since
|I(t0)⟩= |s(t0)⟩= ˆU †(t, t0)|s(t)⟩,
(14.37)
we get
|I(t)⟩= ˆU I (t, t0) ˆU †(t, t0)|s(t)⟩.
(14.38)
Comparing Eq. (14.38) with Eq. (14.32), we see that
ˆU †
0(t, t0) = ˆU I(t, t0) ˆU †(t, t0),
(14.39)
or
ˆU I (t, t0) = ˆU †
0(t, t0) ˆU (t, t0).
(14.40)

214

Substituting Eq. (14.35) into Eq. (14.34), we get the equation of
motion for the unitary operator ˆU I (t, t0):
iℏd ˆU I
dt
= ˆVI ˆU I .
(14.41)
Similar to the state vector |I (t)⟩, the evolution of the unitary
operator in the interaction picture is determined by the interaction
Hamiltonian ˆV .
In summary, using the unitary operator ˆU0(t, t0) involving only
the time-independent part of the Hamiltonian, we can transform the
state vector of a given system into the interaction picture in which
the evolution if the transformed state is determined solely by the
time-dependent (interaction) part of the Hamiltonian.

(14.43)
Hence, the operator ˆAI (t) evolves in time even if the operator
ˆA(t) does not explicitly depend on time. The evolution of the
operator is solely determined by the interaction Hamiltonian ˆVI .
For this reason, the operator ˆAI (t) is called the operator of a given
system in the interaction picture.

Ehrenfest Theorem
215
14.7 Ehrenfest Theorem
The Ehrenfest theorem says that quantum mechanics must produce
the same result as the classical mechanics for a system in which the
particle can be represented by a well-localized wave function, i.e., the
wave function with ∂(x, t)/∂x = 0. Thus, the Ehrenfest theorem is
an example of the correspondence principle.
According to the Ehrenfest theorem, the equations of motion
for the average (mean or expectation) values of the position and
momentum operators of a particle, which can be represented by
well-localized wave functions, are identical to the classical equations
of motion. Consider the equations of motion for the average values
of the position ˆx and momentum ˆpx operators of a particle of mass
m moving in a one-dimensional potential ˆV :
d

Equation (14.45) can be written as

(14.46)
However, classical physics says that the right-hand side of
Eq. (14.46) is a force Fx not ⟨Fx⟩. To solve the problem, we can use
the assumption that the particle is represented by the well-localized
wave function. Then

Example of a well-localized wave function. The function is
diﬀerent from zero only in a very narrow region around the expectation

Thus, if (x, t) is a well-localized function, then ∂(x, t)/∂x = 0,
and we can write Eq. (14.47) as
'

where (∂ˆV /∂x)⟨x⟩is the value of the derivative at the maximum of
the wave function.
Figure 14.1 shows an example of a well-localized wave function
that is maximal at the expectation value of x and is diﬀerent from
zero only in a very narrow region around ⟨x⟩. Thus, a measurement
of x is almost certain to yield a result, which is very close to ⟨x⟩.
The best shape for the wave function for a perfect correspondence
between the quantum and classical mechanics would be a δ
function, (x) = δ(x −⟨x⟩).
In summary, quantum mechanics produces the same result as
classical mechanics for a system in which particles are represented
by well-localized (narrow) wave functions. In this case, the
expectation values of the operators correspond to the classical limits
of the observables, which is consistent with the correspondence
principle.

Chapter 15
Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
We have illustrated in Section 8.3 the solution to the stationary
Schr¨odinger equation for a particle in a square-well potential, where
V (x) had a special simple structure (step function).
In this chapter, we shall try to investigate a more complicated sys-
tem: the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with the potential
V (x) strongly dependent on x, such that
ˆV (x) = 1
2mω2 ˆx2 .
(15.1)
Readers familiar with harmonic motion will recognize that this is
the well-known potential of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator
of mass m and frequency of oscillations ω. Its dependence on the
amplitude of the oscillation x is illustrated in Fig. 15.1. This is still a
one-dimensional problem but with a complication arising from the
x dependence of the potential.
The study of quantum properties of the harmonic oscillator
is important in physics as many real-world systems oscillate
harmonically. Motion of systems in a conﬁned space is often modeled
as being a quantized harmonic motion or, in ﬁrst instance, is
approximated by a harmonic motion.

Consider a harmonic oscillator composed of an oscillating mass

given by
ˆH = 1
2m ˆp2 + 1
2mω2 ˆx2 ,
(15.2)
where ˆp2/2m is the kinetic energy and mω2 ˆx2/2 is the potential
energy of the mass.
We will ﬁnd energies (eigenvalues) and eigenfunctions of the
harmonic oscillator by solving the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
(eigenvalue equation) using two diﬀerent approaches.
In the ﬁrst, we will solve the equation employing an alge-
braic operator technique, which is based on the Dirac notation.
This approach has several deﬁnite advantages and exploits the
commutation relations among the operators involved and their
properties.
In the second approach, we will transform the stationary
Schr¨odinger equation into a second-order diﬀerential equation and
will ﬁnd the solution to the equation with the aid of a more advanced
mathematical technique that involves special functions.

Algebraic Operator Technique
221
15.1 Algebraic Operator Technique
The algebraic operator technique is based on the commutation
relation of two Hermitian operators involved in the evolution of the
harmonic oscillator: position ˆx and momentum ˆp = ˆpx:
[ˆx, ˆp] = iℏ.
(15.3)
We will introduce a non-Hermitian operator deﬁned as
ˆa =

(15.4)
and the adjoint of this operator

(15.5)
Using the commutation relation (15.3), we ﬁnd that the operators
ˆa, ˆa† satisfy the commutation relation

ˆa, ˆa†
= ˆ1 .
(15.6)
This allows us to write the Hamiltonian ˆH in a compact form

(15.7)
Hence, the eigenvalue equation
ˆH |φ⟩= E|φ⟩,
(15.8)
can be written as
ℏω

ˆa† ˆa + 1
2
	
|φ⟩= E|φ⟩.
(15.9)
Multiplying Eq. (15.9) from the left by ⟨φ|, and using the
normalization ⟨φ|φ⟩= 1, we get
ℏω

⟨φ|ˆa† ˆa|φ⟩+ 1

(15.10)
Since
⟨φ|ˆa† ˆa|φ⟩= (ˆa|φ⟩, ˆa|φ⟩) ≥0 ,
(15.11)
we have that
E ≥1

(15.15)
Introducing a notation |⟩= ˆa†|φ⟩, we see that |⟩is an
eigenfunction of ˆH with eigenvalue E + ℏω.
Thus, the operator ˆa† acting on the state |φ⟩of energy E
transforms this state to the state |⟩of energy E + ℏω. Therefore,
the operator ˆa† is called the raising operator or creation operator.
Now, multiplying Eq. (15.15) from the left by ˆa†, we obtain

(15.17)
Thus, the state ˆa†|⟩= ˆa† ˆa†|φ⟩is an eigenfunction of ˆH with an
eigenvalue E + 2ℏω.
Similarly, we can show that the state |φn⟩= (ˆa†)n|φ⟩is an
eigenfunction of ˆH with an eigenvalue E + nℏω.
Consider now the action of the operator ˆa on the eigenfunctions

Thus, the state |φn−1⟩= ˆa|φn⟩is an eigenfunction of ˆH with an
eigenvalue En −ℏω. Therefore, the operator ˆa is called the lowering
operator or annihilation operator.
Suppose that the state |φ0⟩of energy E is the lowest (ground)
state of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, the energy spectrum
(eigenvalues), shown in Fig. 15.2, forms a ladder of equally spaced
levels separated by ℏω, which one ascends by the action of ˆa†
and descends by the action of ˆa. The quantum harmonic oscillator,
therefore, has a discrete energy spectrum.
Consider the action of ˆa on the ground state

another eigenvalue E −ℏω lower than E. Thus, ˆa|φ0⟩must be
identically zero:
ˆa|φ0⟩≡0 .

We can summarize our ﬁndings that the energy eigenvalues of
the harmonic oscillator are discrete

(15.26)
From the above equation, it follows that starting with |φ0⟩,
we may obtain the complete set of eigenvectors of the harmonic
oscillator by repeatedly applying the operator ˆa† on the eigenstate
|φ0⟩.
However, the eigenstates found in this way are not normalized.

(15.31)
Equation (15.31) shows that an nth eigenfunction can be
generated from the ground state eigenfunction by the n-times
repeated action of the creation operator on |φ0⟩. Thus, it is enough
to know the ground state eigenfunction to ﬁnd all the eigenfunctions
of the harmonic oscillator.
This is the complete solution to the problem. It is remarkable
that the commutation relation (15.6) was all what we needed to deal
with the harmonic oscillator completely. In a very eﬀective way, we
extracted the essential structure of the problem and have founded
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the harmonic oscillator.
Using the deﬁnition of the ground state (15.23), we may ﬁnd the
explicit form of the ground state eigenfunction. Substituting for ˆa
from Eq. (15.4) and using the explicit form of ˆp = −iℏd/dx, we get

Integrating Eq. (15.34), we obtain

from which we ﬁnd
φ0(x) = φ0(0) exp

(15.47)

(15.49)
The maximum of |x| ≡x0 = √ℏ/mω is called the classical
turning point.
Since the wave function ψ0(x) is not restricted to x ≤x0, see
Fig. 15.3, quantum mechanics predicts that the harmonic oscillator
can be in the classically forbidden region.
Another interesting observation: According to classical theory of
harmonic oscillator, the probability of ﬁnding the oscillating mass at
a given position is greatest at the end points of its motion, where it
moves slowly, and least near the equilibrium position (x = 0), where
it moves rapidly.

Exactly opposite behavior is manifested by a quantum oscillator
in its lowest energy state of n = 0. The probability density has its
maximum value at x = 0 and drops oﬀon either side of the position.
15.2 Special Functions Method
We will carry out the solution to the eigenvalue equation of the
harmonic oscillator again, this time using the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation in a form of a second-order diﬀerential equation.
The starting point is the stationary Schr¨odinger equation for the
harmonic oscillator whose Hamiltonian is of the form
ˆH = 1
2m ˆp2 + 1
2mω2 ˆx2 .
(15.50)
Since in one dimension, ˆp = −iℏd/dx, the Schr¨odinger (eigen-
value) equation takes the form

−ℏ2
2m
d2
dx2 + 1
2mω2x2
	
φ = Eφ ,
(15.51)
or multiplying by −2m and dividing by ℏ2, we obtain a second-order
diﬀerential equation

φ = 0 .
(15.52)
This is not a linear diﬀerential equation, and it is not easy to
obtain a solution.
We can proceed in the following way. Introducing new variables
λ = 2m
ℏ2 E ,
β2 = m2ω2
ℏ2
,
(15.53)
we can write Eq. (15.52) in a simpler form
d2φ
dx2 +

λ −β2x2
φ = 0 ,
(15.54)
which is still diﬃcult to solve. Despite the diﬃculty, we will try to
solve the diﬀerential equation (15.54). First, we will ﬁnd the solution
to Eq. (15.54) in the asymptotic limit of large x (x ≫1). In this limit,
we can ignore the λ term as being small compared to β2x2 and obtain
d2φ
dx2 −β2x2φ = 0 .
(15.55)

229
This is a simple diﬀerential equation whose solution is of the
form
φ(x) = C exp

−1
2βx2
	
,
(15.56)
where C is a constant.
Hence, we will try to ﬁnd the solution to Eq. (15.54) in the form
φ(x) = f (x) exp

−1
2βx2
	
,
(15.57)
i.e., in the form satisfying the asymptotic solution (15.56), where
f (x) is a function of x, which remains to be found.
By substituting Eq. (15.57) into Eq. (15.54), we obtain
d2 f
dx2 −2βx d f
dx + (λ −β) f = 0 .

H = 0 .
(15.60)
Having written the Schr¨odinger equation in this form, one can
notice that it is identical to the diﬀerential equation for Hermite
polynomials, Eq. (15.46), with
λ
β −1 = 2n ,
(15.61)
where n is integer.a
aOf course, we can prove by using the standard procedure of solving diﬀerential
equations that the solution to Eq. (15.60) is really in the form of Hermite
polynomials. We leave the details of the solution as a tutorial problem.

Thus, the wave functions of the harmonic oscillator are of the
form
φn(x) = NHn(α) exp

−1

,
(15.62)
where N is a normalization constant.
Since n is integer, we ﬁnd from Eqs. (15.61) and (15.53) that the
energy eigenvalue E is
E =

n + 1
2
	
ℏω .
(15.63)
In summary, from the foregoing treatment of the harmonic
oscillator, we see that the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation given
in the diﬀerential form agrees perfectly with the results obtained by
the algebraic operator technique.
In summary of this chapter, we have learned that
(1) The energy of a harmonic oscillator is quantized, with the
sequence of values
En =

n + 1
2
	
ℏω ,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(2) The energy levels are equally spaced. This is an important point
to remember. The diﬀerence in energy between adjacent energy
levels is equal to the energy of a single photon, ℏω.
(3) The lowest energy the oscillator can have is E0 = 1
2ℏω, which is
nonzero. Thus, the oscillator can never be made stationary.
(4) The oscillator can be found in the classically forbidden region.
This is another example of penetration of a potential barrier or
quantum tunneling.

Calculate the probability that the oscillator will be found in the
classically forbidden region, where the kinetic energy is negative.

and
β = mω

Classically forbidden regions are x ≤−x0 and x ≥x0, where
x0 = √ℏ/mω is the classical turning point (see Fig. 15.3).

forbidden region is

Thus, there is about a 16% chance that the oscillator will be

Chapter 16
Quantum Theory of Hydrogen Atom
In Chapter 5, we have seen how Bohr explained the experimentally
observed discrete atomic spectra. He postulated that angular
momentum of the electron in a hydrogen atom is quantized, i.e.,
L = nℏ,
where
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
(16.1)
However, a careful analysis of the observed spectra showed that
some spectral lines are not singlets but are composed with a few
superimposed lines. Thus, the angular momentum cannot be nℏ, but
rather √l(l + 1), where l = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1.
It follows from the Bohr postulate that energy and also electron’s
orbits are quantized, that the electron can be only at some particular
distances from the nucleus. In other words, the electron is not
allowed to be at distances diﬀerent from that predicted by the
angular momentum quantization. A question then arises: where
really is the electron when it makes a transition from one orbit to
another?
Bohr had discussions with Schr¨odinger on this point, apparently
without agreement. The heat of these discussions is captured in the
famous statement by Schr¨odinger that “If all this damned quantum
jumps were really to stay, I should be sorry I ever got involved
with quantum theory,” after which Bohr reportedly replied, “But we

others are very grateful to you that you did, since your work did so
much to promote the theory”.
In this chapter, we will consider Schr¨odinger’s model of hydrogen
atom and will analyze in details the quantum wave mechanics
approach to the motion of the electron in the hydrogen atom. In this
approach, rather than wondering about the position and motion of
the electron, we will classify the electron in terms of the amount
of energy that the electron has, and will represent the electron by
a wave function (⃗r), which satisﬁes the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation
ˆH (⃗r) = E(⃗r) ,
(16.2)
where the Hamiltonian is given by
ˆH = −ℏ2

∇2 + ˆV (r) ,
(16.3)
with the Coulomb potential energy of the electron
ˆV (r) = −e2

r .
(16.4)
Thus, the potential is spherically symmetric; it depends only on
the distance r of the moving electron from the nucleus (central
force).
16.1 Schr¨odinger Equation in Spherical Coordinates
The motion of the electron in the hydrogen atom is a three-
dimensional problem, and by solving Eq. (16.2), we will ﬁnd the
explicit form of the wave function of the electron and its energy E.
The stationary Schr¨odinger equation (16.2) is not easy to solve
as it stands, and the whole problem looks rather complicated when
expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. The problem is that
the diﬀerential equation (16.2) involves three variables, x, y, z, and
cannot be split into a set of three separate diﬀerential equations,
each involving only one variable.
Since the potential V (r) has a spherical symmetry, the whole
problem becomes considerably easier to solve if we work in
the spherical coordinates. In the spherical coordinates, shown in

equation, when written in terms of the polar variables, takes the
form
∇2 = 1

Equation (16.6) has two separate parts: the ﬁrst part depends
only on the distance r, whereas the second part depends only on the
polar angle θ and the azimuthal angle φ. Thus, the wave function is
of the separable form
(⃗r) = R(r)Y(θ, φ) ,
(16.7)
where R(r) is called the radial part of the wave function, and Y(θ, φ)
is the angular part.

Hence, substituting Eq. (16.7) into Eq. (16.6) and dividing both
sides by R(r)Y(θ, φ), we obtain

Both sides of Eq. (16.8) depend on diﬀerent variables, and thus
are independent of each other and therefore must be equal to
the same constant, say −α. Consequently, we are able to separate
the diﬀerential equation into two independent equations: one
depending solely on r and the other on θ and φ:

(16.10)
We will solve the above diﬀerential equations separately. First,
let us consider the angular part, Eq. (16.10), that depends on the
angular variables θ, φ.
16.1.1 Angular Part of the Wave Function: Angular
Momentum
We will ﬁrst show that Eq. (16.10) is, in fact, the eigenvalue equation
for the square of the angular momentum operator
ˆ⃗L = ˆ⃗r × ˆ⃗p = −iℏˆ⃗r × ∇.
(16.11)
To show this, we rewrite Eq. (16.10) in the form

sin θ ∂

(16.13)
On the other hand, if we write the square of the angular
momentum operator in the spherical coordinates
ˆL2 = ˆ⃗L· ˆ⃗L,
(16.14)

Schr¨odinger Equation in Spherical Coordinates
239
we ﬁnd that in the operator ˆL2 is of the form
ˆL2 = −ℏ2

sin θ ∂Y
∂θ


= −ℏ2 ˆO .
(16.15)
The proof of this relation is left as an exercise for the readers.
Since the eigenvalue equation for ˆL2 can be written as
ˆL2Y(θ, φ) = λY(θ, φ) ,
(16.16)
it then follows that α = −λ/ℏ2, where λ is the eigenvalue of ˆL2.
We now return to Eq. (16.10), which we can write as
sin θ ∂
∂θ

sin θ ∂Y
∂θ
	
−α sin2 θY + ∂2Y
∂φ2 = 0 .
(16.17)
This equation contains two separate parts: one dependent only
on θ and the other dependent only on φ. Therefore, the solution to
Eq. (16.17) will be of the form
Y(θ, φ) = X (θ)(φ) .
(16.18)
Hence, substituting Eq. (16.18) into Eq. (16.17) and dividing both
sides by X (θ)(φ), we obtain
1
X sin θ d
dθ

sin θ dX
dθ
	
−α sin2 θ = −1

d2
dφ2 ,
(16.19)
where X ≡X (θ) and  ≡(φ).
As before, both sides must be equal to a constant, say m2. Thus
1
X sin θ d


sin θ dX
dθ
	
−α sin2 θ = m2 ,
(16.20)


d2
dφ2 = −m2 .
(16.21)
Hence, we have separated Eq. (16.17) into two diﬀerential
equations, that we can solve separately.
16.1.2 Azimuthal Part of the Wave Function
First, we will solve the equation for the azimuthal part of the wave
function, which is particularly simple. We rewrite Eq. (16.21) in the
form
d2
dφ2 = −m2 ,
(16.22)

240
Quantum Theory of Hydrogen Atom
and readily ﬁnd that a general solution to Eq. (16.22) is of the form
(φ) = A exp(imφ) ,
(16.23)
where A is a constant.
Since in rotation, φ and φ + 2π correspond to the same position
in space, we have (φ) = (φ + 2π). Thus
exp(imφ) = exp[im(φ + 2π)] ,
(16.24)
from which we ﬁnd that
exp(i2πm) = 1 .
(16.25)
However, this condition is satisﬁed only when m is an integer,
m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . ..
Hence, the constant m2 is not an arbitrary number and is an
integer.
Using the normalization condition
1 =
 2π
0
|(φ)|2 dφ = 2π|A|2 ,
(16.26)
we can write the ﬁnal form of the azimuthal part of the wave function
(φ) as
m(φ) =
1
√
2π
exp(imφ) ,
(16.27)
where m is an integer, and the subscript m has been introduced to
indicate the dependence of the wave function upon the quantum
number m.
16.1.3 Polar Component of the Wave Function
The next step in the solution is to ﬁnd X (θ), the polar component
of the wave function that is a solution to the diﬀerential equation
(16.20). The solution is rather complicated and is given in terms of
special functions.
The procedure of solving the diﬀerential equation (16.20) is as
follows: If we multiply both sides of the equation by X and divide by
sin2 θ, we obtain after a slight rearrangement

This diﬀerential equation is known in mathematics as the
generalized Legendre diﬀerential equation, and its solutions are the
associated Legendre polynomials. For m = 0, the equation is called
the ordinary Legendre diﬀerential equation whose solution is given
by the Legendre polynomials.
Equation (16.31) has singularities (poles) at z = ±1. However,
the desired solution should be single valued, ﬁnite, and continuous
on the interval −1 ≤z ≤1 to represent the wave function of the
electron.
To ﬁnd the physically acceptable solution to this equation, we will
check what solution could be continuous near the poles.
We ﬁrst ﬁnd a possible ﬁnite solution near z = 1. Substituting
x = 1 −z, we have dx = −dz, and then in terms of x, the diﬀerential
equation (16.31) takes the form
d

(16.32)
The standard procedure for solving diﬀerential equations like
Eq. (16.32) is to assume that X (x) can be given in terms of a power
series in x:
X (x) = xs
∞

j=0
aj x j .
(16.33)
Substituting this into the diﬀerential equation for X , we get

Near x ≈0, we can replace x(2 −x) by 2x and obtain

2s2a0 −m2
2 a0
	
xs−1 + (. . .)xs . . . = 0 .
(16.35)
This equation is satisﬁed for all x only if the coeﬃcients at
xs, xs±1, . . . are zero. From this, we ﬁnd that
s = ±1
2|m| .
(16.36)
We take only s = + 1
2|m| as for s = −1
2|m| the solution to X (x)
at x = 0 would go to inﬁnity. We require the solution to the wave
function to be ﬁnite at any point x.
Thus, the solution that is continuous near x = 0 is of the form
X (x) = x
1
2 |m|

(16.37)
or in terms of z
X (z) = (1 −z)

(16.38)
Using the same procedure, we can show that near the pole


j=0
a′′

(16.39)
Hence, we will try to ﬁnd the solution to Eq. (16.31) in the form
X (z) =

1 −z2 1
2 |m|
∞

j=0
bjzj .
(16.40)
Substituting this equation into the diﬀerential equation for X (z)
and collecting all terms at the same powers of zj, we obtain

j
%
( j + 1)( j + 2)bj+2 −j( j −1)bj
−2(|m| + 1) jbj −(α + |m| + m2)bj
&
zj = 0 .
(16.41)
Hence, we get a recurrence relation for the coeﬃcients bj
bj+2 = ( j + |m|)( j + |m| + 1) + α
( j + 1)( j + 2)
bj .
(16.42)

Schr¨odinger Equation in Spherical Coordinates
243
Thus, if we know the ﬁrst two coeﬃcients, b0 and b1, then we
can determine the whole series. However, there is a problem with
the series. Since bj+2 > bj, the series diverges (logarithmically) for
z = ±1, which means that X (z) is not ﬁnite at z = ±1. But the wave
function must be ﬁnite everywhere, including the polar directions
z = ±1.
There is a simple way out of this dilemma.
If the series representing X (z) terminates at a certain bj0, so that
the coeﬃcients bj are zero for j > j0, the wave function X (z) will
be ﬁnite everywhere. In other words, if X (z) is a polynomial with a
ﬁnite number of terms instead of an inﬁnite series, it is acceptable.
Therefore, we terminate the series at some j = j0, i.e., we assume
that bj0+1 = bj0+2 = . . . = 0. The series terminating at j = j0
indicates that
( j0 + |m|)( j0 + |m| + 1) + α = 0 .
(16.43)
Introducing
l = j0 + |m| ,
(16.44)
we see that l ≥|m|, and
α = −l(l + 1) ,
l = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(16.45)
Hence, we see that the eigenvalues of the angular momentum are
quantized
ˆL2 : λ = ℏ2l(l + 1) ,
ˆL : λ = ℏ

l(l + 1) .
(16.46)
The integer number l is called the angular momentum quantum
number. Since l ≥|m|, the number m is limited to absolute values
not larger than l.
After the termination of the series, we get the solution to the
wave function X (z), which is in the form of polynomials, called the
associated Legendre polynomials
X lm(z) = (1 −z)
1
2 |m|
l−|m|

j=0
bjzj ,
(16.47)
where the subscript lm has been introduced to indicate the
dependence of the wave function on the quantum numbers l and m.

244
Quantum Theory of Hydrogen Atom
Important: In the sum over j, we take either even or odd terms
in zj depending on whether l −|m| is even or odd.
For example, when l −|m| is even, we take b0 ̸= 0 and put b1 = 0,
so that the solution is given in terms of only even j. For l −|m| odd,
we put b0 = 0 and take b1 ̸= 0, so that the solution is given in terms
of odd j.
Why we cannot accept both the even and odd solutions at the
same time?
The answer is as follows: We cannot accept both the even and
odd solutions at the same time because in this case the solution X (z)
would not be a single-valued function.
For example, for b0 ̸= 0, we have α = −|m| −m2, but for b1 ̸= 0,
we have α = −2 −3|m| −m2. If we would accept both the solutions
at the same time, the wave function would have two diﬀerent values.
As an illustration: The ﬁrst few associated Legendre polynomials
are
X 00(z) = b0 ,
X 10(z) = b1z ,
X 11(z) = b0

1 −z2 ,
(16.48)
where the coeﬃcients b0, b1, . . . are found from the normalization of
the wave functions X lm(z).
The ﬁrst few normalized complete angular parts of the wave
function of the electron Ylm(θ, φ) = X lm(θ)m(φ), the so-called
spherical harmonics, are:
Y00(θ, φ) =
1
√

Y10(θ, φ) =

4π cos θ ,
Y11(θ, φ) = −
 
3
8π sin θ eiφ ,
Y1−1(θ, φ) =
 
3
8π sin θ e−iφ .
(16.49)
All the spherical harmonics have basically the same mathemat-
ical structure and are in the form of powers of the sine and cosine
functions.

16.1.4 Physical Interpretation of the Quantum Number m
Before proceeding further with the procedure of ﬁnding the
complete wave function of the electron, let us discuss the physical
meaning of the quantum number m. We have already shown that the
azimuthal part of the wave function is given by
m(φ) =
1
√
2π
exp(imφ) ,
m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , ±l . (16.50)
Consider the z-component, ˆLz, of the angular momentum.
We will try to ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of ˆLz:
ˆLz = μ .
(16.51)
It is convenient to write the operator ˆLz in the spherical
coordinates, where it takes the form
ˆLz = −iℏ∂
∂φ .
(16.52)
Then, we get from Eq. (16.51) a simple diﬀerential equation
−iℏ∂
∂φ = μ ,
(16.53)
whose solution is
(φ) = A exp
 i
ℏμφ
	
,
(16.54)
where A is a constant.
Using the same argument as before that in rotation φ and φ + 2π
correspond to the same position in space, we ﬁnd that
μ = mℏ,
m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
(16.55)
Thus, the azimuthal part of the wave function is the wave
function of the z-component of the angular momentum, and
the number m is the z-component angular momentum quantum
number.
Note that the component ˆLz, whose eigenvalue is mℏ, can never
be as long as the vector ˆ⃗L, whose magnitude is ℏ√l(l + 1). This is
illustrated in the following example.

Angular momentum quantization for l = 1.
Example
Consider angular momentum with l = 1. In this case, the eigenvalue
of ˆ⃗L is
√
2ℏ, and ˆLz can have three values +ℏ, 0, −ℏ. Thus, the
orientation of ˆ⃗Lalong the z-axis is quantized. The vector ˆ⃗Lprocesses
around the z-axis, sweeping out cones of revolution around that axis.
This is shown in Fig. 16.2. The quantization of the orientation of ˆL
along its z-axis is called space quantization.
16.2 Radial Part of the Wave Function
The ﬁnal step in the procedure of ﬁnding the wave function of the
electron is to determine the remaining radial part R of the wave
function (Eq. (16.9)).
We start with a simpliﬁcation of Eq. (16.9) by introducing new
variables
β2 = −2meE
ℏ2
,
λ =
mee2
4πε0ℏ2β ,
ρ = 2βr ,
(16.56)
and substituting the explicit form for V (r) (Eq. (16.4)), and α =
−l(l + 1).

R = 0 .
(16.57)
We begin the solution to Eq. (16.57) by ﬁnding the asymptotic
form that R must have if we want R →0 as r →∞.
In the limit of ρ ≫1, we can ignore in Eq. (16.57) the terms
proportional to 1/ρ and 1/ρ2 and obtain an asymptotic equation
d2R
dρ2 −1
4 R = 0 .
(16.58)
It is a simple second-order diﬀerential equation whose solution
is of the exponential form
R(ρ) = Ae−1
2 ρ + Be
1
2 ρ ,
(16.59)
where A and B are constants.
In the limit of r →∞(ρ →∞), the second term in Eq. (16.59)
goes to inﬁnity and then the wave function R would be inﬁnite. Since
the wave function must be ﬁnite for all r, we ignore the second term,
leaving only the ﬁrst term in Eq. (16.59) as an acceptable asymptotic
solution.
Following this asymptotic behavior, we expect the general
solution to Eq. (16.57) in the form
R(ρ) = e−1
2 ρ F (ρ) ,
(16.60)
where F (ρ) is a function of ρ that remains to be found.
To ﬁnd F (ρ), we substitute Eq. (16.60) into (16.57) and obtain

(16.61)
This equation contains several terms, which become inﬁnity at
ρ = 0. Since the solution must be ﬁnite everywhere including r = 0,
we will look for a solution in the form of a power series in ρ:
F (ρ) = ρs L(ρ) ,
(16.62)
where s and L(ρ) have to be determined.
Substituting Eq. (16.62) into Eq. (16.61), we ﬁnd
ρs+2 d2L
dρ2 + 2sρs+1 dL
dρ + s(s −1)ρs L+ 2ρs+1 dL
dρ + 2sρs L
−ρs+2 dL
dρ −sρs+1L+ (λ −1)ρs+1L−l(l + 1)ρs L = 0 .
(16.63)

248
Quantum Theory of Hydrogen Atom
In order for this equation to hold for all values of ρ, the
coeﬃcients at all powers of ρ must be zero. In particular, the
coeﬃcient at ρs is
{s(s + 1) −l(l + 1)} L,
(16.64)
and vanishes when
s = l
or
s = −(l + 1) .
(16.65)
For s = −(l + 1), the function F (ρ) = ρ−(l+1)L(ρ) diverges as
ρ →∞. Hence, we ignore this solution leaving s = l as the only
acceptable solution to F (ρ).
We have already determined s; what left is to determine L(ρ). The
function L(ρ) is found from Eq. (16.63). When we substitute s = l
into Eq. (16.63) and divide both sides by ρl+1, we obtain a second-
order diﬀerential equation
ρ d2L
dρ2 + [2 (l + 1) −ρ] dL
dρ + (λ −l −1) L = 0 .
(16.66)
The standard procedure for solving diﬀerential equations like
Eq. (16.66) is to assume that L(ρ) can be expanded in a power series
in ρ:
L(ρ) =
∞

j=0
bjρ j ,
(16.67)
and then to determine the values of the coeﬃcients bj.
Substituting Eq. (16.67) into Eq. (16.66), we obtain the recursion
relation for the coeﬃcients bj:
bj+1 =
( j + l + 1 −λ)
2( j + 1)(l + 1) + j( j + 1) bj ,
(16.68)
which enables us to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients b1, b2, b3, . . . in terms of b0.
We now check whether the coeﬃcients converge as j →∞.
For a large j ( j ≫1), we get
bj+1
bj
≈1
j ,
(16.69)
which shows that the coeﬃcients converge as j →∞.
Because L(ρ) is multiplied by the exponential function ρle−1
2 ρ,
the wave function R will vanish at ρ →∞only if
lim
ρ→∞L(ρ) < e
1
2 ρ .
(16.70)

Radial Part of the Wave Function
249
However, the function L(ρ) behaves at ρ →∞as the exponent
function eρ. To show this, expand eρ into a series
eρ = 1 + ρ + ρ2
2! + ρ3
3! + . . . + ρ j
j! +
ρ j+1
( j + 1)! . . .
(16.71)
The ratio of the coeﬃcients at ρ j+1 and ρ j is equal to
j!
( j + 1)! =
1
j + 1 ≈1
j
for
j →∞.
(16.72)
Hence, for large j, the series L(ρ) behaves as eρ. Therefore, the
radial function
R(ρ) = e−1
2 ρρl L(ρ)
(16.73)
would behave as ρle
1
2 ρ, which does not vanish as ρ →∞. This
means that the wave function R(ρ) would not be a physically
acceptable wave function.
As before, we solve this dilemma in the following way. If the series
representing R(ρ) terminates at a certain bj0, so that all coeﬃcients
bj are zero for j > j0, the wave function R(ρ) will go to zero as r →
∞because of the exponential factor e−1
2 ρ.
Therefore, we terminate the series at some j
=
j0, which
according to Eq. (16.68) corresponds to j0 = λ−l−1. In other words,
the condition j0 = λ−l−1 is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for
the wave function R to be continuous for all r and vanish as r →∞.
Next, denoting j0 + l + 1 = n, we have λ = n > 0, i.e., n =
1, 2, 3, . . .. In other words, n can never be zero. Moreover, we see
that n > l. We call the integer number n −the principal quantum
number.
We have found that λ (= n) is a discrete number, so β too is a
discrete number, and from that we ﬁnd the energy of the electron
E = −

called the Bohr radius, and then

Quantum Theory of Hydrogen Atom
Thus, the energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom is
quantized.a Notice that Eq. (16.76) agrees perfectly with the
prediction of the Bohr theory of the hydrogen atom (see Eq. (5.11)).
Hence, we see that Bohr’s concept that the electron can exist only
in discrete energy levels survived the transition to quantum wave
mechanics.
Since ρ = 2βr, and β = 1/(aon), the radial part of the wave
function can be written as

(16.77)

(16.79)
Once the radial part of the wave function is known, the solution
to the problem of the hydrogen atom is completed by writing down
the normalized wave function of the electron
nlm(r, θ, φ) = Rnl(r)Ylm(θ, φ) ,
(16.80)
where the subscript nlm indicates the dependence of the wave
function on the quantum numbers n, l, and m. Thus, for each set of
quantum numbers (n, l, m), there is a diﬀerent wave function nlm.
Summary
The eigenvalues of the energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom
are quantized

aAn interesting observation: The energy E depends solely on the quantum number n,
not on the quantum numbers l and m. Why? I leave the answer to this question for
the reader.

and the corresponding eigenfunctions are
nlm(r, θ, φ) = Rnl(r)Ylm(θ, φ) ,
(16.82)
where the discrete (quantum) numbers are
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , ∞,
l = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1 ,
m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , ±l .
(16.83)
The angular momentum states are often indicated by letters
s, p, d, . . ., such that s corresponds to l = 0 state, p to l = 1, and
so on according to the following scheme:
l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . ,
s, p, d, f, g, h, i, . . .
(16.84)
This particular notation that is widely used in atomic physics
originated from the classiﬁcation of atomic spectra into series called
(s) sharp, (p) principal, (d) diﬀusive, and ( f ) fundamental. Thus, an
s state is one with no angular momentum, a p state has the angular
momentum
√
2ℏ, etc.
The analysis of the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation shows
how inevitably quantum numbers appear in Schr¨odinger’s model of
the hydrogen atom. Namely, the important condition for obtaining
physically acceptable solution to the wave function of the electron
is that n, l, and m are integer parameters. This is in contrast to
Bohr’s model, where the quantization of the angular momentum was
postulated without any evident reasons.

Interesting properties of the probability function Pnlm:
(1) For n = 1, the probability has one maximum exactly at r = ao,
the orbital radius of the ﬁrst energy level in the Bohr model.
(2) For (n = 2, l = 0, m = 0), the probability shows two maxima
located at r ̸= n2ao.
(3) Only for states such that n = l + 1, the probability shows one
maximum located at r = n2ao, the orbital radius of the nth
energy level in the Bohr model.
Remark on the diﬀerence between Bohr’s and Schr¨odinger’s models
of the hydrogen atom: We have seen that according to Schr¨odinger’s
model of the hydrogen atom, the energy of the electron is quantized
and the energy spectrum is exactly the same as that predicted by
Bohr’s model.
An essential diﬀerence between Bohr’s and Schr¨odinger’s mod-
els is that there are three (ignoring spin) quantum numbers, n, l, m,
rather than the one number n describing a state of the electron.
Moreover, in Bohr’s model the atom is, at each instant, in one and
only one energy state, i.e., at each instant, the state of the atom
is deﬁnite, but according to Schr¨odinger’s model, the atom can
exist in a superposition of states. In other words, the atom can be
simultaneously in more than one energy state at a given instant. This
is clearly incompatible with Bohr’s model.

Show the following:

(b) The most probable value of r is r = ao.

⟨r⟩=

∗(r)r (r) dV = 4π A2
 ∞

r3e−2βrdr ,
where β = 1/ao, and we have transformed the integral over dV

Thus, the average distance of the electron from the nucleus in
the state  is 3/2 of the Bohr radius.
(b) The most probable value of r is that where the probability of
ﬁnding the electron is maximal.
Thus, we ﬁrst calculate the probability of ﬁnding the electron at
a point r:
P(r) = 4πr2| (r) |2 = 4πr2A2e−2βr = 4r2

Maximum of P(r) is where dP(r)/dr = 0. Hence

Thus
dP(r)

when
βr = 1 ,
from which, we ﬁnd
r = 1
β = ao .
Note that this result agrees with the prediction of the Bohr
model that the radius of the n = 1 orbit is equal to ao.
The maximum of the probability at r = ao is

In summary of the solution: The expectation and most probable
values of r are not the same. This is because the probability
curve P100(r) is not symmetric about the maximum at ao (see
Fig. 16.3). Thus, values of r greater than ao are weighted
more heavily in the equation for the expectation value than
values smaller than ao. This results in the expectation value ⟨r⟩
exceeding ao for this probability distribution.
Discussion Problems
Problem D7 Explain why an external (static) magnetic ﬁeld aﬀects
the motion of the electron described only by the quantum number m,
i.e., the azimuthal component of the motion, and leads to a splitting
of the energy levels corresponding to diﬀerent m (the Zeeman
eﬀect).
Problem D8 One can see from Eq. (16.49) that the solutions to the
Schr¨odinger equation for the angular part of the wave function

solutions are not spherically symmetric despite the fact that the
potential V (r) is spherically symmetric.

Chapter 17
Quantum Theory of Two Coupled
Particles
In the preceding chapter, we have studied the theory of the hydrogen
atom as a single-particle problem, an electron moving in a spherical
potential. The hydrogen atom can be considered a two-particle
system, an electron and a proton, with the Coulomb potential acting
between them. In this chapter, we will show how to solve the
Schr¨odinger equation for the wave function of the two-particle
system. We will introduce the coordinates of the center of mass,
which will allow us to split the Schr¨odinger equation into two
independent equations, one for the center of mass motion and
another for the relative motion of the electron and proton.
17.1 Center of Mass Motion
Consider a system composed of two particles of masses m1 and
m2 moving in potential forces that depend on the positions of the
particles and time, V = V (⃗r2 −⃗r1, t), where ⃗r2 = (x2, y2, z2) and
⃗r1 = (x1, y1, z1) are position vectors of the particles.

(17.2)
We may introduce coordinates of center of mass, which can allow
us to reduce the wave equation for two particles into the wave
equation for a single (global) particle moving in a potential ﬁeld. The
center of mass coordinates are deﬁned as
X = m1x1 + m2x2
m1 + m2
,
Y = m1y1 + m2y2
m1 + m2
,
Z = m1z1 + m2z2
m1 + m2
,
(17.3)
and a relative (mutual) distance between the particles
⃗r = ⃗r2 −⃗r1,
(17.4)
where x = x2 −x1, y = y2 −y1, z = z2 −z1.
For simplicity of notation, denote by M = m1 + m2 the total
mass of the particles, and (⃗R, ⃗r, t) = (⃗r1, ⃗r2, t) in which ⃗R =
⃗R(X, Y, Z) and ⃗r = ⃗r(x, y, z).
We now transform the Schr¨odinger equation from the ⃗r1 and ⃗r2
coordinates to the center of mass coordinates, determined by ⃗R and
⃗r. This requires to transform the Laplacians ∇2

coordinates. Thus, using the chain rule, we get for the ﬁrst-order

(17.13)
Assume that the potential V is independent of time. Then the left-
hand size of the Schr¨odinger equation depends solely on the spatial
variables, whereas the right-hand size depends solely on time. In this
case, both sizes are independent of each other but are equal to the
same constant, say ET . Each size can be solved separately.
The wave function can be written as a product of the spatial and
time-dependent parts. Thus, it can be written as
(⃗R, ⃗r, t) = (⃗R, ⃗r)(t) = (⃗R, ⃗r)e−i
ℏET t,
(17.14)

(17.15)
It is very similar in form to the Schr¨odinger equation for
the hydrogen atom except it involves two Laplacians. Since the
Laplacians act on separate variables, we may try to solve the
Schr¨odinger equation using the method of separate variables, in
which we write the wave function as
(⃗R, ⃗r) = c(⃗R)r(⃗r).

The left-hand side of the equation depends solely on the center
of mass variables, whereas the right-hand side depends solely on ⃗r.
Therefore, the sides are independent of each other and are equal
to a constant, say Ec. Hence, we can write Eq. (17.17) as two

−ℏ2
2μ∇2r + [V (⃗r) −E] r = 0,
(17.20)
where E = ET −Ec. Let us summarize our ﬁndings.
Equation (17.19) is the equation of motion of a free particle of
mass M. Thus, Ec is the kinetic energy of the center of mass. If the
center of mass is stationary, then Ec = 0.
Equation (17.20) is of the same form as the Schr¨odinger equation
for the hydrogen atom, a single particle of mass μ moving in the
potential V (⃗r). We have solved this equation in the chapter on the
quantum theory of hydrogen atom.

Chapter 18
Time-Independent Perturbation Theory
In many situations in physics, the Hamiltonian ˆH of a given system
is so complicated that the solution to the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation is practically impossible or very diﬃcult. Therefore, some
approximation methods are required. In this chapter, we present
the time-independent perturbation theory, the procedure of ﬁnding
corrections to non-degenerate eigenvalues and eigenvectors to a
part (called unperturbed part) of the Hamiltonian of a given system.
The perturbation theory is appropriate when the Hamiltonian
can be split into two parts
ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV ,
(18.1)
such that we can solve the eigenvalue equation for ˆH0, i.e., we can
ﬁnd eigenvalues E (0)
n
and eigenvectors |φ(0)
n ⟩of the Hamiltonian ˆH0,
and we can treat the part ˆV as a small perturber to ˆH0.
Thus, the problem of solving the eigenvalue equation
ˆH |φ⟩=
 ˆH0 + ˆV

|φ⟩= E|φ⟩
(18.2)
reduces to ﬁnd E and |φ⟩when we know the eigenvalues E (0)
n
and
the eigenvectors |φ(0)
n ⟩of ˆH0.
Since ˆV appears as a small perturber to ˆH0, we will try to ﬁnd E

Equation (18.5) is the stationary Schr¨odinger equation whose

|φ(1)

(18.7)
Assume that the eigenvalues E (0)
n
are non-degenerated, i.e., for a
given E (0)
n , there is only one eigenfunction |φ(0)

Multiplying Eq. (18.7) from the left by ⟨φ(0)

(18.10)
Thus, the ﬁrst-order correction to the eigenvalue E (0)

We ﬁnd the coeﬃcients cmn from Eq. (18.7) by multiplying this

Since

and
⟨φ(0)
m | ˆH0|φ(1)
n ⟩= E (0)
m ⟨φ(0)

The perturbation theory can be applied to analyze the quantum
properties of particles trapped in two closely coupled potential
wells. By closely coupled wells, it is meant that these two wells are
separated by a barrier, as illustrated in Fig. 18.1. This is a typical
situation in the studies of quantum dynamics of Bose–Einstein
condensates. The perturbation theory is particularly useful here, as
the following example will demonstrate.

Worked Example
Consider a particle in an inﬁnite one-dimensional potential well,
as shown in Fig. 18.1. Assume that inside the inﬁnite well there is
a small potential barrier of high V1 and thickness d. Treating the
barrier V1 as a small perturber, ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenstates
of the particle valid to the ﬁrst order in V1.

Chapter 19
Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
In this chapter, we continue our study of perturbation methods for
the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation and turn our attention to
the case where the perturber ˆV depends explicitly on time. Just as
in the case of the time-independent perturbation theory, we ﬁnd
the corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a system
described by a time-dependent Hamiltonian.
19.1 Iterative Method
In the time-independent perturbation theory, we have found
corrections to the stationary (time-independent) eigenvalues and
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian ˆH by solving the stationary part of
the Schr¨odinger equation
ˆH |φ⟩= E|φ⟩.
(19.1)
In the non-stationary (time-dependent) case, in which the
Hamiltonian of the system depends on time, we ﬁnd the time
evolution of the state vector (⃗r, t) by solving the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ∂
∂t|(t)⟩= ˆH (t)|(t)⟩,

Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
where for simplicity of the notation |(t)⟩≡|(⃗r, t)⟩and ˆH (t) ≡
ˆH (⃗r, t).

|(t)⟩= |(0)⟩+ 1

(19.3)
Since the right-hand side of Eq. (19.3) depends on |(t′)⟩, this is
not the ﬁnal solution to |(t)⟩. The ﬁnal solution to |(t)⟩should be,
for example, in terms of the initial state |(0)⟩.
To get the solution in this form, we can use the iteration method.
In this approach, we substitute the solution given by Eq. (19.3) back
into the right-hand side of the Schr¨odinger equation (19.2) and
obtain

Note the time ordering in the integration, t ≥t′ ≥t′′ ≥. . . tn ≥0.
If the time tn is short or the state |(tn)⟩does not change much
under the action of ˆH (t′) . . . ˆH (tn), we can approximate |(tn)⟩by
|(0)⟩. Then, the iterative solution (19.6) can be accepted as the ﬁnal
solution to the wave function of the system.
The iterative solution (19.6) involves the total Hamiltonian of the
system ˆH (t). It may result in complicated expressions to evaluate.

Solution in Terms of Probability Amplitudes
273
A simpler way to proceed, which is a common practice in quantum
physics, is to write the total Hamiltonian as the sum of two terms
ˆH (t) = ˆH0 + ˆV (t),
(19.7)
where ˆH0 is the time-independent (stationary) part of the Hamil-
tonian, and ˆV (t) is the part containing all time-dependent terms,
usually called the time-dependent interaction Hamiltonian or time-
dependent perturber.
If ˆV (0) = 0, the state of the system at t = 0 is determined by the
Hamiltonian ˆH0, which satisﬁes the time-independent Schr¨odinger
equation
ˆH0|(0)⟩= E0|(0)⟩.
(19.8)
In other words, the initial state of the system is given by the
stationary eigenstates of ˆH0.
The splitting of the total Hamiltonian into stationary and time-
dependent parts allows to work in the interaction picture and ﬁnd

19.2 Solution in Terms of Probability Amplitudes
The iterative solution (19.9) for the state vector of a system is
in the operator form. We would prefer the solution in a number
form rather than in the operator form. We can ﬁnd the solution by
ﬁnding ﬁrst the unperturbed state of the system, |0(t)⟩, which is
the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ∂
∂t|0(t)⟩= ˆH0(t)|0(t)⟩.

The solution to Eq. (19.10) is of a simple form
|0(t)⟩= e−i

in which we have used the fact that ˆH0|φn⟩= En|φn⟩.
If we write the Hamiltonian as the sum of two terms, Eq. (19.7),
then the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation can be written as
iℏ∂
∂t|(t)⟩= ˆH0|(t)⟩+ ˆV (t)|(t)⟩.
(19.15)
Since the right-hand side of Eq. (19.15) has two terms and
we know the solution when only the ﬁrst term is present,
ˆH0|(t)⟩, we can solve the Schr¨odinger equation in the manner
one solves an inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation. Namely, we
may treat ˆH0|(t)⟩as the homogeneous part and ˆV (t)|(t)⟩as the
inhomogeneous part of the diﬀerential equation. Then, we can solve
the equation by making the coeﬃcients cn dependent on time and
write the solution as

In general, the set of the diﬀerential equations (19.21) can be

required. In the later case, we may ﬁnd a solution by expanding cn(t)
in powers of Vmn(t):
cn(t) = c(0)

We see that if we know the zeroth-order coeﬃcient c(0)

substitution of the solution to the higher-order coeﬃcient. Let us
illustrate the procedure of the solution to Eq. (19.24) up to the
second order, c(2)

Integrating the diﬀerential equation for c(0)
m (t), we get
c(0)
m (t) = c(0)
m (0),
(19.25)
which is a constant independent of time. Assume that initially the
system was in one of the eigenstates of ˆH0, say |φk⟩. Then
c(0)
m (0) = ⟨φm|φk⟩= δmk.

(19.32)
where α is a small real constant. Find the ﬁrst- and second-order
corrections to the probability amplitude of the transition |0⟩→|2⟩.
Solution
In order to ﬁnd the ﬁrst-order correction to the probability
amplitude, we have to calculate the matrix element V20. From
Eq. (19.32) and using the properties of the annihilation and creation
operators, ˆa|0⟩= 0, ˆa†|0⟩= |1⟩, we ﬁnd
V20 = ⟨2| ˆV |0⟩= α⟨2|(ˆa + ˆa†)|0⟩= α⟨2|1⟩= 0.
(19.33)
Thus, the ﬁrst-order correction to the transition amplitude is
zero.

278
Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
For the second-order correction, we need matrix elements V21
and V10, which are found as
V21 = ⟨2| ˆV |1⟩= α⟨2|(ˆa + ˆa†)|1⟩= α⟨2|2⟩= α,
V10 = ⟨1| ˆV |0⟩= α⟨1|(ˆa + ˆa†)|0⟩= α⟨1|1⟩= α.

Let us look at the transition probability Pk→m(t) more closely.

0). The zeroth of the function are at x = ±nπ, (n = 1, 2, . . .).
The width of the peak is 2π/t showing that the probability depends
inversely on the transition (observation) time. The width of the peak
narrows with an increasing transition time. This is consistent with
the time–energy uncertainty relation.
For short times (x ≪1), sin c2x ≈1, and then
Pk→m(t) ≈|Vmk|2
ℏ2
t2.
(19.43)
Notice the proportionality of the transition probability to t2.
19.3.1 Fermi Golden Rule
The result (19.43) that the probability varies quadratically with time
is not consistent with experimental observations. The experiments
show that the probability is proportional to t rather than to t2.
Where this inconsistency comes from?
In the derivation of Pk→m(t), we have taken into account only two
energy levels, k and m. However, electrons in atoms can be in many

280
Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
energy levels, in fact, in an inﬁnite number of levels. For a short
transition time, the uncertainty of energy to which the transition
occurs is very large. Thus, we cannot be sure to which atomic level
the electron can be transferred over a short time t. In this case, we
have to assume that after an excitation, the atom can be found in one
of the large number of excited levels. Hence, the probability of an
excitation of the atom to one of its energy levels is the sum of the
probabilities of transitions from k to all the excited levels

If the number of energy levels is large, we may approximate them

(19.45)
where dm is the number of energy levels in the energy width dE.
We can express the number of energy levels in the continuum by
the density of energy levels in the continuum
dm = ρ(ωmk)dE = ℏρ(ωmk)dωmk,
(19.46)
where ρ(ωmk) is the density of the energy levels. Hence

Transition Probability

we ﬁnally get the following expression for the transition probability:
Pk→m(t) = 2π|Vmk|2
ℏ
ρ(ωmk)t.
(19.50)
This is the famous Fermi Golden Rule, which shows that in an
atom composed of a large number of energy states, the probability
of a transition is proportional to time. Thus, per unit time of the
transition probability is constant and proportional to |Vmk|2.
An interesting observation: Shift of the energy levels
Consider the probability amplitude of the k →m transition for ˆV
independent of time. To the ﬁrst order that the electron makes, a
transition from k to m is
ck→m(t) = c(0)
k→m(t) + c(1)
k→m(t) = δkm −
Vmk
Em −Ek

eiωmkt −1

.
(19.51)
For short times (t ≪1), the transition amplitude (19.51) reduces
to
ck→m(t) = δkm −i
ℏVmkt.
(19.52)
The transition amplitude exhibits interesting properties. Namely,
the probability amplitude that the system will remain in the state k
is
ckk(t) ≡ck→k(t) = 1 −i
ℏVkkt.
(19.53)
The probability amplitude that the system will make a transition
to a state m is
ckm(t) ≡ck→m(t) = −i
ℏVmkt.
(19.54)
Note that the amplitudes ckk(t) and ckm(t) depend on diﬀerent
matrix elements Vkk and Vmk, respectively. Thus, even if the system
does not make transitions to other states (Vmk = 0), the probability
that the system remains in the state k may change in time.
How to understand it?
In the derivation of ckm(t), we have assumed that ˆV is inde-
pendent of time. Hence, the time-dependent perturbation theory

282
Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
should lead to results one could expect from the time-independent
perturbation theory.
In the time-independent perturbation theory, Vkk contributes to
the ﬁrst-order correction to the energy of the state k. Thus, even if
the system does not make transitions to other states, the perturber
can still perturb (shift) energy of the initial state.
In order to show that there is a shift of the unperturbed energy
Ek, we consider the exact equation of motion for ck(t):
˙ck(t) = −i
ℏ

n
Vkncn(t)eiωknt.
(19.55)
We may extract from the sum over n the term n = k, so we can
write
˙ck(t) = −i
ℏVkkck(t) −i
ℏ

n̸=k
Vkncn(t)eiωknt.
(19.56)
If the system does not make transitions to n ̸= k, i.e., Vkn = 0, and
then
˙ck(t) = −i
ℏVkkck(t).
(19.57)
The solution to Eq. (19.57) is
ck(t) = ck(0)e−i
ℏVkkt.
(19.58)
Substituting the solution (19.58) into the expression for the state
vector, Eq. (19.16), we obtain
|(t)⟩=

n
cn(t)e−i
ℏEnt|φn⟩=

n
cn(0)e−i
ℏ(En+Vnn)t|φn⟩. (19.59)
This clearly shows that the energy of the nth state of the system
is shifted from its unperturbed value En by Vnn.
An useful comment: How do in practice we observe (detect) that an
electron makes transitions between diﬀerent energy states?
When the electron makes a transition from a lower energy state
to a higher energy state, an energy is absorbed from the external
perturber, and vice versa, when the electron makes a transition from
a higher energy state to a lower energy state, an energy is emitted.
In a laboratory, we measure the absorbed or emitted energy. Usually,
the absorbed or emitted energy is in the form of a radiation. A

Transition Probability
283
detector measures the square of the amplitude of the ﬁeld falling on
it, |E|2, whose average value ⟨|E|2⟩is called intensity.
We can show, using the time-dependent perturbation theory, that
the intensity of the absorbed or emitted radiation is proportional to
the probability of the transition between two energy states of the
absorbing or emitting system.
The probability that a system will be found at time t in a state |m⟩
is given by
Pm(t) = |⟨m|(t)⟩|2 ,
(19.60)
where |(t)⟩is the state vector of the system. If the system
interacts with an external perturber described by an operator ˆVI ,
we know from the perturbation theory that to the ﬁrst order in the
perturbation, the state vector of the system evolves in time as
|(t)⟩= |(0)⟩+ 1
iℏ
 t
0
dt′ ˆVI (t′)|(0)⟩.
(19.61)
Suppose that the external perturber is linearly coupled to the
system, i.e., the interaction Hamiltonian is of the form
ˆVI (t) = −iℏ[E(t)Smk −E∗(t)Skm] ,
(19.62)
where E(t) is the amplitude of the external perturber, which by
acting on the system forces the electron to make a transition
between the energy states k and m. The transitions are described
by the transition (projection) operators Smk = |m⟩⟨k| for the “up”
k →m transition, and Skm = |k⟩⟨m| for the “down” transition m →k.
Assume that the initial state of the system plus the detected ﬁeld
is a product state, i.e., the system and the detected ﬁeld are initially
independent of each other
|(0)⟩= |F ⟩|k⟩,
(19.63)
where |F ⟩is the initial state of the detected ﬁeld. Then, we ﬁnd
using Eqs. (19.61) and (19.62) that a projection of |m⟩on |(t)⟩
results in a state
⟨m|(t)⟩= −E(t)|F ⟩t.
(19.64)
Hence, the probability that under the interaction with the
perturber the system makes a transition to the state |m⟩is
Pm(t) = |⟨m|(t)⟩|2 = ⟨F |E∗(t)E(t)|F ⟩t2
= ⟨F ||E(t)|2|F ⟩t2 = IF (t)t2,
(19.65)
where IF (t) = ⟨F ||E(t)|2|F ⟩is the intensity of the detected ﬁeld.
Clearly, the probability of the k →m transition in the system is
proportional to the intensity of the absorbed ﬁeld.

Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
Thus far our principal task has been the development of the
fundamentals of quantum physics for non-relativistic (stationary
or slowly moving) particles. Now we proceed to introduce the
concepts of the relativistic theory to basic problems of quantum
physics, in particular, the extension of the Schr¨odinger equation to
a relativistic form. We will see that this is not an easy task and
faces a considerable complication. We will ﬁnd a controversy of
how to implement the concepts of relativity to derive a relativistic
form of the Schr¨odinger equation. Starting from the fundamental
laws of relativity, we ﬁrst derive the Klein–Gordon equation and
investigate if the equation can be considered a generalization of the
non-relativistic Schr¨odinger equation to the case of the relativistic
energy. We will ﬁnd that the wave function, which is a solution to the
Klein–Gordon equation, cannot be connected with the probability
wave function. For this reason, we will derive the Dirac equation,
which solves the problem faced by the Klein–Gordon equation. The
Dirac equation also includes the spin.

E 2 = c2 p2 + m2c4,
(20.6)
that
E = ±

c2 p2 + m2c4.
(20.7)
The formula (20.7) is not convenient for the quantization
because there is minus sign in the square root. This indicates that
even before the quantization, the classical kinetic energy could be
negative.
Therefore, we consider the square of the energy, as given by
Eq. (20.6), which is positive and write it as
E 2 −c2 p2 −m2c4 = 0.
(20.8)
We now apply Jordan’s rules. Since the relativistic energy formula
involves E 2 and p2, taking the square in Eq. (20.3), we obtain
E 2 = −ℏ2 ∂2
∂t2 ,
p2 = −ℏ2∇2.
(20.9)
Then Eq. (20.8) takes the form

20.2 Difficulties of the Klein–Gordon Equation
A question arises: Can we consider the Klein–Gordon equation as a
relativistic form of the Schr¨odinger equation?
If yes, then ||2 should correspond to the probability density and
then the wave function  could be interpreted as a probability wave
function. Let us check if ||2 could be interpreted as the probability
density.
This would be the case if the Klein–Gordon equation could be
transformed to the continuity equation
∂
∂tρ + div⃗J = 0.
(20.15)
Let us try to transform the Klein–Gordon equation into the
continuity equation. From the Klein–Gordon equation, we get

Note that ρ does not have to be positive. Therefore, ρ cannot be
interpreted as the probability density.

Dirac Equation
289
Therefore, we cannot connect the solution to the Klein–Gordon
equation with probability. The source of this problem is in the fact
that the Klein–Gordon equation is second order in t, whereas the
Schr¨odinger equation is ﬁrst order in t.
Note that the Klein–Gordon equation for a free particle has only
one solution for , i.e., gives only a single value of . For this reason,
the Klein–Gordon equation cannot be an equation for a particle that
has a nonzero spin, e.g., electron, as it cannot take either + or −
value. Therefore, the Klein–Gordon equation can describe particles
without spin.
20.3 Dirac Equation
We now turn to obtain a relativistic wave equation, which could be
applicable for an arbitrary particle that may or may not possess a
spin and the wave function could be interpreted as a probability
wave function.
Consider a wave function of a particle whose spin could have

(20.29)
In quantum mechanics, we require for the Hamiltonian to be
always linear and Hermitian. We may choose the Hamiltonian of the
form
H = c⃗α · ⃗p + βmc2,
(20.30)

290
Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
where (⃗α, β) are four operators acting on the components of
the wave function. The explicit form of the operators has to be
determined such that the Hamiltonian H satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger
equation.
If we now apply Jordan’s rules to the Hamiltonian (20.30), we get

or equivalently

 = 0.
(20.33)
Since in the relativistic theory
E 2 = c2 p2 + m2c4,
(20.34)
we require that the solution to either Eq. (20.32) or Eq. (20.33)
satisfy the relation for E, Eq. (20.34).
How to achieve it?
Let us act on Eq. (20.33) with the operator
E + c⃗α · ⃗p + βmc2,
(20.35)
and get

E −c⃗α · ⃗p −βmc2 
E + c⃗α · ⃗p + βmc2

(20.36)

However,

 = 0.
(20.41)
Comparing terms in Eqs. (20.40) and (20.41), we see the
following.
Since
p2 = p2
x + p2
y + p2
z,
(20.42)
we see that the second term in Eq. (20.40), which is multiplied by c2,
will be equal to p2 if
α2
x = α2

z = 1,
(20.43)
and

αxαy + αyαx


αyαz + αzαy


(αzαx + αxαz) = 0.
(20.44)
The third term in Eq. (20.40), which is multiplied by mc3, is
absent in Eq. (20.41). Therefore,
αxβ + βαx = 0,
αyβ + βαy = 0,
αzβ + βαz = 0.
(20.45)
Finally, comparing the forth term in Eq. (20.40) with Eq. (20.41),
we see that
β2 = 1.
(20.46)
Operators ⃗α and β satisfying the conditions (20.43)–(20.46) are
called the Dirac α matrices. Notice that the conditions (20.43)–
(20.46) are the same as for the Pauli spin 1
2 matrices. The operator β
also satisﬁes the anti-commutation relations, Eq. (20.45) and β2 =
1, so it also represents a spin.

292
Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
The equation

E −c⃗α · ⃗p −βmc2
 = 0,
(20.47)
together with the conditions (20.43)–(20.46) is called the Dirac
equation.
The advantage of the Dirac equation over the Schr¨odinger and
Klein–Gordon equations is that it naturally includes the spin. In the
Schr¨odinger and Klein–Gordon equations, the spin is not present
and has to be added to the wave function manually whenever the
wave function determines a system with the spin. The Dirac equation
involves a system composed of N particles with spin and, as such
mathematically, is in the form of 2N diﬀerential equations.
20.4 Dirac Spin Matrices
Dimensions of the operators ⃗α and β depend on the dimension of
the wave function , i.e., the number of particles (spins) involved
in a given system. Since spin has two values, the operators can be
represented by 2N × 2N matrices.
Let us illustrate this on examples of N = 1 and N = 2 systems.
For a system composed of a single particle (N = 1) with spin up,
|2⟩, and spin down, |1⟩, the components of ⃗α represented in the basis
of the states |2⟩and |1⟩are the Pauli spin matrices
αx =
0 1
1 0
	
,
αy =
 0 −i
i 0
	
,
αz =
1 0
0 −1
	
. (20.48)
What is the matrix form of the operator β?
Since β anti-commutes with all components of ⃗α and β2 = 1, it

commutes, not anti-commutes, with all the matrices of ⃗α.) Therefore,

Consider the Dirac equation in the form

Relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation
Since

∂t||2,
(20.56)
and
∗⃗α · ∇ + ∇∗· ⃗α = ∇· (c∗⃗α) ,
(20.57)
we can write Eq. (20.55) as
∂
∂t||2 + ∇· (c∗⃗α) = 0,
(20.58)
which is in the form of the continuity equation. Hence,
||2 = ρ
and
c∗⃗α = ⃗J .
(20.59)
Notice that both ρ and ⃗J are real and ρ ≥0. Thus, we can
interpret ρ as the probability density. Therefore, we may conclude
that the Dirac equation is a relativistic form of the Schr¨odinger
equation for the probability wave function.

Chapter 21
Systems of Identical Particles
In this ﬁnal chapter, we study the properties of systems of identical
particles. We will ﬁnd wave functions of a system composed of N
identical and independent particles. From the properties of the wave
functions, we will ﬁnd that identical particles can be characterized
by symmetric as well as antisymmetric wave functions. As a result,
we will distinguish two kinds of particles: bosons and fermions.
Consider a system composed of N parts (subsystems), e.g., a
system of N identical and independent particles, whose Hamiltonian
is given by
ˆH =
N

i=1
ˆHi ,
(21.1)
and the wave function is
(r) = φ1(r1)φ2(r2) . . . φN(rN) ,
(21.2)
where φi(ri) is the wave function of the ith particle located at the
point r j, or equivalently we can say that φi(r j) is the wave function
of the jth particle being in the ith state.
However, the wave function (r) is not the only eigenfunction of
the system. For example, a wave function
(r) = φ1(r2)φ2(r1) . . . φN(rN) ,

is also an eigenfunction of the system with the same eigenvalue.

N

i=1
ˆHi(r) =
N

i
ˆHiφ1(r2)φ2(r1) . . . φN(rN) .
Since
ˆH1φ1(r2) = E1φ1(r2) ,
and
ˆH2φ2(r1) = E2φ2(r1) ,
we get ˆH (r) = N
i=1 Ei(r).
Even if
ˆH1φ1(r2) = E2φ1(r2) ,
and
ˆH2φ2(r1) = E1φ2(r1) ,
we get
ˆH (r) =


i=1

(21.4)
as required.
In fact there are N! permutations of φi(r j), which are eigenfunc-
tions of the system. Moreover, an arbitrary linear combination of the
wave functions φi(r j) is also an eigenfunction of the system.
We will illustrate this for N = 2.
21.1 Symmetric and Antisymmetric States
Consider an arbitrary linear combination of two wave functions
(r) =
1

|a|2 + |b|2 [a(r12) + b(r21)] ,
(21.5)

Symmetric and Antisymmetric States
299
where (r12 = φ1(r1)φ2(r2) and (r21 = φ1(r2)φ2(r1). Then
ˆH (r) =
 ˆH1 + ˆH2

(r)
=
1

|a|2 + |b|2 [a (E1 + E2) (r12) + b (E1 + E2) (r21)]
= (E1 + E2) (r) .
(21.6)
We know that in the linear combination, |a|2/(|a|2 + |b|2) is the
probability that the particle “1” is at the position r1 and the particle
“2” is at r2. Equivalently, for r1 = r2, we can say that this is the
probability that the particle “1” is in a state |1⟩, and the particle “2”
is in a state |2⟩.
Similarly, |b|2/(|a|2 + |b|2) is the probability that the particle “1”
is at the position r2, and the particle “2” is at r1.
Note that in general, the probabilities are diﬀerent. However, for
two identical particles, the probabilities should be the same as we
cannot distinguish between two identical particles.
Thus, for two identical particles, |a| = |b|. Hence, the parameters
a and b can diﬀer only by a phase factor: b = a exp(iφ), where φ is a
real number:
(r) =
1
√
2

(r12) + eiφ(r21)

.
(21.7)
If we exchange the positions of the particles (r1 ↔r2) or energy
states (|1⟩↔|2⟩), then we obtain
′(r) =
1
√
2

eiφ(r12) + (r21)

.
(21.8)
Thus, the exchange of r1 ↔r2 or |1⟩↔|2⟩is equivalent to
multiplying (r) by eiφ and taking e2iφ = 1. Hence
eiφ = ±1 ,
(21.9)
and therefore the wave functions of identical particles are either
symmetrical or antisymmetrical
s(r) =
1
√
2
[(r12) + (r21)] ,
a(r) =

[(r12) −(r21)] .

Note that
s(r12) = s(r21) ,
a(r12) = −a(r21) .

Properties of symmetrical and antisymmetrical functions
Property 1. If ˆH = ˆH12 = ˆH21, i.e., the Hamiltonian is symmetrical,
then ˆH (r) has the same symmetry as (r).
Proof: Take (r) = s(r). Denote f12 = ˆH12s(r12), then
f21 = ˆH21s(r21) = ˆH12s(r12) = f12 .
Take now (r) = a(r). Then
f21 = ˆH21a(r21) = ˆH12 (−s(r12)) = −f12 ,
as required.
Property 2. Symmetry of the wave function does not change in
time, i.e., the wave function initially symmetrical (antisymmetrical)
remains symmetrical (antisymmetrical) for all times.
Proof: Consider the evolution of a wave function (t) in a time dt:
(t + dt) = (t) + ∂
∂t dt .
Thus, symmetry of the wave function depends on the symmetry
of ∂/∂t. From the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ∂
∂t = ˆH  ,
we see that ∂/∂t has the same symmetry as
ˆH . From the
property 1, we know that
ˆH  has the same symmetry as .
Therefore, (t + dt) has the same symmetry as (t), as required.
Diﬀerence between symmetric and antisymmetric functions
Antisymmetric function can be written in a form of a determinant,
called the Slater determinant:
a(r) =

√
N!

φ1(r1) φ1(r2) . . . φ1(rN)

φN(r1) φN(r2) . . . φN(rN)

,
(21.12)
where 1/
√
N! is the normalization constant.

Pauli Principle
301
If two particles are at the same point, r1
=
r2, and then
two columns of the determinant (21.12) are equal, giving a(r)
= 0. Thus, two particles determined by the antisymmetric function
cannot be at the same point. Similarly, if two particles are in the
same state, φ1(r1) = φ1(r2), and again two columns are equal giving
a(r) = 0.
A symmetrical function cannot be written in the form of a
determinant. Thus, particles that are determined by symmetrical
functions can be in the same point or in the same state.
Hence, particles can be divided into two types: those determined
by antisymmetric functions (called fermions) and those determined
by symmetrical functions (called bosons).
Examples of fermions and bosons
Fermions: electrons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos.
Bosons: photons, phonons, π mesons, α particles.
From experiments, we know that we can distinguish between
fermions and bosons by looking at their spins. Fermions have half-
integer spin (1/2, 3/2, etc., in units of ℏ), whereas bosons have
integer spin (0, 1, 2, etc.).
Since an arbitrary number of bosons can occupy the same state,
atoms with integer spin (atomic bosons) can abruptly condensate
into a single ground state when the temperature of the atoms goes
below a certain critical value. We call this process Bose–Einstein
condensation.a
21.2 Pauli Principle
In atoms, a limited number of electrons (fermions) can occupy the
same energy level. How many electrons does it take to ﬁll an energy

book by L. Pitaevskii and S. Stringari, Bose–Einstein Condensation (Clarendon Press,
Oxford, 2003).

Systems of Identical Particles
level? The answer to this question is given by the Pauli principle,a
also called exclusion principle.
Pauli principle
No two electrons can have the same quantum numbers
(n, l, m, s) in a multi-electron atom.
It is also known as the exclusion principle, for the simple reason
that if an electron has the quantum numbers (nlms), then at least
one of the quantum numbers of any further electrons must be
diﬀerent.
In an atom, for a given n, there are 2(2l + 1) degenerate states
corresponding to l = 0, 1, 2, . . ., m = −l, . . . , l, and s = −1
2, + 1
2.
Thus, for a given n, the total number of electrons in the energy state
nlm is
l=m

l=−m
2(2l + 1) = 2n2 .
(21.13)
Following the Pauli principle, we can ﬁnd the numbers of
electrons in the energy states
1s,
2s,
2p,
3s,
3p,
4s,
3d ,

The Pauli principle prevents the energy states being occupied by
an arbitrary number of electrons. The state 1s can be occupied by
two electrons. Hence, as more electrons are added, the energy of the
atom grows along with its size. Thus, the Pauli principle prevents
all atoms having the same size and the same energy. This is the
quantum physics explanation of atomic sizes and energies.
Since the number of electrons on given energy levels is limited,
we get diﬀerent ground state conﬁgurations for diﬀerent atoms. The
ground state of a many-electron atom is that in which the electrons
occupy the lowest energy levels that they can occupy.
If the number of electrons for a given nl is 2(2l + 1), we say that
there is a closed shell. Examples: Helium, Beryllium, Neon.
aPauli was granted the Nobel Prize in 1945 for the discovery of the exclusion principle
(also called Pauli principle).

Symmetric and Antisymmetric States of N > 2 Particles
303
Since the chemical properties of atoms depend on the number
of electrons outside the closed shells, the atoms with similar outer
conﬁgurations will have similar chemical properties. Examples:
The Alkali metals: lithium (1s)22s, sodium (1s)2(2s)2(2p)63s, and
potassium (1s)2(2s)2(2p)6(3s)2(3p)64s.
This is the explanation from quantum physics of the periodic
structure of the elements.
21.3 Symmetric and Antisymmetric States of N > 2
Particles
For a system composed of two particles, the question of which of
the two possible functions 12 and 21 should contribute to the
antisymmetric combination with the positive and which with the
negative sign is not a problem. However, for N > 2 particles, it is
a problem which wave functions contribute with the positive and
which with the negative sign. There is a rule for choosing the sign,
which we will illustrate on an example of N = 3 particles.
Consider a system of N = 3 independent particles. The number
of possible permutations is 3! = 6, so that we have 6 possible wave
functions
123, 231, 312, 213, 132, 321.
(21.14)
The symmetric function of the three particles
s =
1
√
3!
(123 + 231 + 312 + 213 + 132 + 321) .
(21.15)
The antisymmetric function of the particles
a =
1
√
3!
[(123 + 231 + 312) −(213 + 132 + 321)] .
(21.16)
For the symmetric function, all six terms have the positive sign so
that they can be added in an arbitrary order. For the antisymmetric
function, three terms have the positive sign and three terms have
the negative sign. A question then arises: Which functions should be
contributing with the positive and which with the negative sign? The
rule of ﬁnding the sign of a particular term is as follows.

304
Systems of Identical Particles
The rule is how many times do we have to change a pair of
numbers until the sequence 123 is obtained. For example:
(231) →(213) →(123)
(21.17)
so that two changes were made to get the sequence (123). Since
the number of changes was an even number, the sign of the term
is chosen (+). If the number of changes is an odd number, the sign of
the term is chosen (−). For example, take the term (321):
(321) →(312) →(132) →(123)
(21.18)
so we had to make 3 changes of the numbers, an odd number of
changes. The sign of the term is, therefore, (−).
21.4 Identical (Nondistinguishable) and Nonidentical
(Distinguishable) Particles: Degeneracy of Wave
Function
Consider a system of N independent particles each of energy Ei
determined by the integer number ni.
For example, if a particle is represented by harmonic oscillators,
then Ei = niℏω = ni E0. Total energy is E = (n1 + n2 + . . .)E0, and
the wave function of the system is
n1,n2,n3,··· = φ1(n1)φ2(n2)φ3(n3) · · ·
(21.19)
We see that the energy E and the wave function  are speciﬁed by
a set of integer numbers (n1, n2, n3, . . .). Thus, there might be few
wave functions corresponding to the same energy E. If it happens,
we say that the energy level is degenerate, and the number of states
corresponding to this energy is called degeneracy.
Worked Example
Consider a system of three identical and independent harmonic
oscillators. If the oscillators are in their lowest energy states, for
which n1 = n2 = n3 = 1, the total energy of the oscillators is E =
3E0 and there is only one combination of the numbers (n1, n2, n3) =

Identical (Nondistinguishable) and Nonidentical (Distinguishable) Particles
305
(1, 1, 1). Thus, there is only one wave function corresponding to this
energy, 1,1,1. We say that the level has degeneracy 1.
If the oscillators have the total energy E = 4E0, there are three
combinations of n1, n2, and n3 which sum to 4. These combinations
are (n1 = 2, n2 = 1, n3 = 1), (n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n3 = 1), and
(n1 = 1, n2 = 1, n3 = 2). Thus, there are three wave functions
corresponding to this energy: 2,1,1, 1,2,1, and 1,1,2. In this case,
we say that the energy level has degeneracy 3.

Final Remark
Although this textbook focused on a small part of quantum physics,
it should nevertheless be appropriate to close by emphasizing the
importance of quantum phenomena in the development of new
areas in science and technology. The predictions of quantum physics
have turned research and technology into new directions and have
led to numerous technological innovations and the development of
a new technology on the scale of single atoms and electrons, called
quantum technology or nanotechnology. The ability to manufacture
and control the dimensions of tiny structures, such as quantum
dots, allows us to engineer the unique properties of these structures
and predict new devices such as quantum computers. A quantum
computer can perform mathematical calculations much faster and
store much more information than a classical computer by using the
laws of quantum physics. The technology for creating a quantum
computer is still in its infancy because it is extremely diﬃcult to
control quantum systems, but it is developing very rapidly with little
sign of the progress slowing.
We have seen in our journey through the backgrounds of
quantum physics that despite its long history, quantum physics
still challenges our understanding and continues to excite our
imagination. Feynman, in his lectures on quantum physics, referred
in the following way to our understanding of quantum physics:
I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics.
In summary of the book, I think I can safely say:
If you think you now know quantum physics, it means you do
not know anything.

Appendix A
Derivation of the Boltzmann distribution
function Pn
Assume that we have n identical particles (e.g., photons), each of
energy E, which can occupy g identical states. The number of
possible distributions of n particles between g states is given by
t = (n + g −1)!
n!(g −1)!
.
(A.1)
For example: n = 3, g = 2 gives t = 4, as it is illustrated in
Fig. A.1.
We will ﬁnd maximum of t with the condition that nE = constant,
where E is the energy of each particle.
Taking ln of both sides of Eq. (A.1), we get
ln t = ln(n + g −1)! −ln n! −ln(g −1)! .
(A.2)
Using Sterling’s formula
ln n! = n ln n −n ,
(A.3)

and assuming that g ≫1, i.e., g −1 ≈g, we obtain
ln t = g ln n + g
g
+ n ln n + g
n
.
(A.4)
We ﬁnd maximum of ln t using the method of Lagrange
undetermined multipliers. In this method, we construct a function
K = ln t −λnE ,
(A.5)
where λ is called a Lagrange undetermined multiplier, and ﬁnd the
extremum
∂K
∂n = 0 .
(A.6)
Thus, we get
ln
n
n + g + λE = 0 ,
(A.7)
from which, we ﬁnd
n =
g
eλE −1 .
(A.8)
This is the Bose–Einstein distribution function. Since n is
dimensionless, λ should be inverse of energy. We choose λ = 1/
(kBT ), where kBT is the energy of free, noninteracting particles.
When g/n ≫1, we can approximate Eq. (A.8) by
n = ge−
E
kB T ,
(A.9)
which is known in statistical physics as the Boltzmann distribution.
This gives the number of particles n of energy E.
If there are particles, among N particles, that can have diﬀerent
energies Ei, then
ni
N = g
N e−
E

(A.10)
is the probability that ni particles of the total N particles have energy

Since the probability is normalized to one (

get
