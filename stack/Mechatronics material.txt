1.0 Introduction to Mechatronics 
The term "mechatronics" was first assigned by Mr. Tetsuro Mori, a senior engineer of the 
Japanese company Yaskawa, in 1969. Mechatronics basically refers to mechanicalelectronic

1.4  Arduino Programming 
Structure: A basic Arduinosketch(Progrm) consists of two functions called setup() and loop(). 
Where setup() is the preparation, loop() is the execution. Both functions are required for 
program to work. The setup() should follow the declaration of any variables at every beginning 
of the program.  It is the first function to ruin in the program, is only run once, and used to set 
pinMode or initialize serial communication 
The loop() follows next and includes the code to be executed continuously- reading 
inputs , triggering outputs etc., this function is core of all arduino programs does bulk of work. 
The setup() Function 
The setup() called once when program starts. Use it to initialize pin modes, or begin 
serial communication. It must be included in program even if there are no statements run. 
The loop() Function 
After calling the setup() function, the loop() function does precisely what its name 
suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing the program to change, respond and control the 
arduino board.

// File: blink.pde 
// Turns on an LED on for one second,  
// then off for one second, repeatedly. Header: • Overview comments • Global variables

1.5 Arduino Basic functions 
1.5.1 Digital I/O:Arduino mega 2560 have 54 digital I/O pins(0-53) 
pinMode(pin, mode): Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output.  
pin is the pin number(0 - 53). Mode specifies INPUT/OUTPUT. 
Ex:   
pinMode(7, OUTPUT);   // sets the “pin 7” as output 
pinMode(1, INPUT);       // sets the “pin 1” as input 
digitalWrite(pin, value): Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin.  
Ex: digitalWrite(14, HIGH);       // write logic 1(5V) on to “pin 14” 
digitalWrite(52, LOW);       // write logic 0(0V) on to “pin 52” 
digitalRead(pin): Reads the value from a specified digital pin(0-53). The result will be either 
HIGH or LOW 
Ex: value= digitalRead(10); 
// reads logic level(0/1) on pin 10 and assigns to  value 
1.5.2 Analog I/O:Arduino mega 2560 have 16analog I/O pins(0- 15) 
analogRead(pin): Reads the value from the specified analog pin with a 10-bit resolution. This 
function works on analog input pins(0 - 15). The resulting integer values from 0 to 1023 to 
represent 0 to 5V. It takes about 0.0001 seconds to read an analog pin.  
Ex:   value=analogRead(0);  // reads analog pin 0, converts 10-bit digital number assigns to  
value// 
Note: Analog pins unlike digital ones do not need to declare as INPUT/OUTPUT. 
analogWrite(pin,value):Arduino mega 2560 have 14PWMs (0- 13) 
Writes analog value using hardware enabled pulse width modulation (PWM) to an output 
marked PWM.  The value can be specified as a variable or constant with a value from 0-255.

Ex:  analogWrite(0,value);  // write value to “PWM0” 
A value of 0 generates a steady state 0V output at the specified pin; a value of 255 generates 
5Voutput at the specified pin. For values in between 0 and 255 the pin rapidly alternate between 
0 and 5V. As value increases duty cycle of the pulse is increased.  
analogReference(type): The default reference voltage is 5V. This can be changed to a different 
type and different resolution using this function.

SENSORS 
2.0 Sensors: A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a 
electrical signal. Examples of sensors are Temperature sensors, Displacement, position, motion 
and velocity sensors, Fluid sensors, liquid flow, liquid level, Light sensors etc., 
2.1 Characteristics of Sensors: Sensor characteristics are of two types  
➢ Static Characteristics 
➢ Dynamic Characteristics  
Static characteristics refer to the steady state relationship between sensor input and output 
Dynamic characteristics refer to the relationship between the sensor input and output when the 
measured quantity is varying rapidly.  
2.1.1 Static Characteristics 
i) 
Range: The range of a sensor indicates the limits between which the input can vary. 
Example: a thermocouple for the measurement of temperature might have a range 
of 25-225 °C.  
ii) 
Span: Span is difference between the maximum and minimum values of the input.  
Thus, the above-mentioned thermocouple will have a span of 225-25=200 °C.  
iii) 
Error: Error is the difference between the measured value and the true value of the 
quantity. Example: A sensor might give a displacement reading of 29.8 mm, when 
the actual displacement had been 30 mm, then the error is 0.2 mm. 
iv) 
Sensitivity: Sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio of change in output value 
of a sensor per unit change in input value. For example, a temperature sensor may 
have a sensitivity of 10 mV/°C. If 1oC raise in temp results in 10mV.  
v) 
Non-Linearity: The nonlinearity indicates the maximum deviation of the actual 
measured curve of a sensor from the ideal curve. It is shown in fig. 2.1 
vi) 
Hysteresis: The hysteresis is an error of a sensor, which is defined as the maximum 
difference in output at any measurement value within the sensor’s specified range 
when approaching the point first with increasing and then with decreasing the input 
parameter. It is shown in fig. 2.2

vii) 
Stability: Stability is the ability of a sensor device to give same output with a 
constant input over a period.  
viii) 
Dead band: The dead band or dead space of a sensor is the range of input values 
for which there is no output.  
ix) 
Repeatability: It specifies the ability of a sensor to give same output for repeated 
applications of same input value under same conditions.    
x) 
Accuracy: This is the closeness to the actual value. 
xi) 
Precision: Precision is defined as the ability of sensor to reproduce a certain set of 
readings within given accuracy. Precision depends upon repeatability.  
xii) 
 Output Impedance: It is the impedance measured at the output of sensor. It is 
necessary to know the output impedance of a sensor because the electrical output 
of sensor is interfaced with an electronic circuit. 
2.1.2 Dynamic Characteristics 
i) 
Response time: This is the time which elapsed by sensor to gives an output 
corresponding to some specified percentage (90-95%) of its steady value after a 
constant input, a step input, is applied.  
ii) 
Time constant: The time constant is a measure of the inertia of the sensor and so 
how it will react to changes in its input. This is the 63.2% response time.  
iii) 
Rise time: This is the time taken for the output to rise from 10% to 90 % of its 
steady value. 
iv) 
Settling time: This is the time taken for the output to settle to within some small 
percentage (2%) of steady state value. 
The Dynamic Characteristics are shown in Fig. 2.3

2.2 Classification of sensors 
In the first classification of the sensors, they are divided in to Active and Passive.  
Active sensors (self-generating): Does not require power for its operation. Ex: Thermocouple 
Passive Sensors (external supply): Require external power for its operation Ex: Photodiode  
In the second classification of the sensors, they are divided in to Analog and digital. 
Analog Sensors: Analog Sensors produce an analog output i.e. a continuous output signal with 
respect to the quantity being measured. Ex: LDR, Strain gauge      
Digital Sensors: Digital Sensors, in contrast to Analog Sensors, work with discrete or digital 
data. The data in digital sensors, which is used for conversion and transmission, is digital in 
nature.  Ex: IR, PIR 
In the third classification of the sensors, they are divided in to primary and secondary. 
Primary Sensor:  Primary transducers contain the mechanical as well as electrical device. It 
usually converts the physical quantity to be measured into a mechanical signal.  
Secondary Sensor: Secondary transducers are deployed in cascade with primary one. This 
converts that mechanical signal into a more comprehensible electrical signal.  
Ex: Bourdon tube (Primary sensor) and LVDT(Secondary sensor). 
2.3 Selection of Sensors 
The following parameters need to be considered while selecting a sensor for a application 
➢ Operating principle

o payment options, Continuation of supply. 
➢ Cost: Cost of sensor itself, delivery cost. 
➢ Performance figures: 
o Range, ease of use, power supply requirements, accuracy, hysteresis effect and 
any other 
2.4 Displacement Sensors: 
Displacement sensors are basically used for the measurement of movement of an object. The 
displacement sensor converts displacement into electrical signal. This electrical signal may 
Rresistance/Capacitance/Inductance. Based on the electrical output, the displacement sensor 
classified into three types:  
➢ Resistive Displacement sensors: Potentiometer, strain gauge 
➢ Capacitive Displacement sensors:  Capacitive element 
➢ Inductive Displacement sensors: LVDT 
2.4.1 Resistive Displacement sensors 
i) 
Potentiometer: 
Construction:  It consist of a resistance element with sliding contact which can be moved 
over the length of the element as shown in fig. 2.4. The resistive element is a wire wound 
track or conductive plastic.  Wire wound track has a resolution of the order of 0.5mm. The 
conductive plastic may have the resolution of about 0.1 µm.

5 | P a g e  
 
Operation: Potentiometer is one of the common sensors for position measurements. It relates 
the change in position (linear or rotary) into the change in resistance, as shown in Figure 2.5 a 
and b. The resistance change is then converted to a proportional voltage change in the electrical 
circuit of the sensor. Hence, the relationship between the measured physical variable, 
translational(linear) displacement x or rotary(angular) displacement θ, and the output voltage 
for a ideal potentiometer is 
𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡= 𝑘𝑉𝑠 𝑥                                     𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡= 𝑘𝑉𝑠 𝜽 
Where  
Vs= supply voltage 
 
 
X= linear displacement 
𝛉= angular displacement. 
Vout = output voltage 
K= Sensitivity of the potentiometer is a function of the winding resistance and 
physical shape of the winding.

ii) Strain gauge: A strain gauge is an example of passive transducer that converts a 
mechanical displacement into a change of resistance. Strain gage is one of the most popular 
types of transducer. It has got a wide range of applications. It can be used for measurement of 
force, torque, pressure, acceleration and many other parameters. The basic principle of 
operation of a strain gage is simple: when strain is applied to a thin metallic wire, its dimension 
changes, thus changing the resistance of the wire. Let us first investigate what are the factors, 
responsible for the change in resistance. 
Based on principle of working:  
a. Mechanical

b. Electrical  
c. Piezoelectric 
Based on mounting:  
a. Bonded strain gauge  
b. Unbonded strain gauge 
Out of these the most commonly used one is the electrical strain Gauge 
Construction of electrical strain Gauge: There are many types of strain gauges. Among them, 
a universal strain gage has a structure such that a grid-shaped sensing element of thin metallic 
resistive foil (3 to 6μm thick) is put on a base of thin plastic film (15 to 16μm thick) and is 
laminated with a thin film and is shown in fig. 2.6 
 
Fig. 2.6 Construction of Metal foil Strain gauge 
Types of electrical strain Gauges: Types of electrical strain Gauges are shown in fig.2.7 
     
 
 
Fig.2.7 (a) Metal wire type      (b) Semiconductor type   
 
       (c)   Metal foil type 
Operation: The strain gage is tightly bonded to a measuring object so that the sensing element 
(metallic foil) may stretch or contract according to the strain on the measuring object. The 
stretching and contraction may result in change length of the strain gauge as shown in fig. 2.8.

The change in length results change in resistance according to following equation 
𝑅= 𝜌𝑙

Where R = Resistance

Hence the applied strain is directly proportional to the change in resistance 
∆𝑅
𝑅= 𝐺∈

➢ Strain measurement 
Displacement Measurement using Strain gauge: One form of displacement sensor has strain 
gauge attached to flexible element in the form of cantilevers, rings and U- shapes. 
Fig.2.9 Shows displacement measurement using cantilever. 
                                
 
Fig. 2.9(a) Cantilever under no displacement          Fig. 2.9(b) Cantilever with displacement 
When strain or force is applied on beam of cantilever, it is displaced, then the strain 
gauges mounted on the cantilever are also strained. which results in one strain gauge is under 
tension and one is under compression as shown in fig. 2.8(b) and give a resistance change 
which can be monitored. The change in resistance is thus measure of displacement of beam of 
cantilever. Such arrangements typically used for linear displacements of the order of 1mm to 
30mm and Have non-linearity error of about ±1% of full range. 
2.4.2 Inductive Displacement sensor: The best example of inductive displacement sensor 
is the Linear Variable Differential Transducer/Transformer (LVDT). 
Linear Variable Differential Transducer/Transformer (LVDT): 
Principle of LVDT: LVDT works under the principle of mutual induction, and the 
displacement which is a non-electrical energy is converted into an electrical energy.  
Construction of LVDT: LVDT consists of a cylindrical former where it is surrounded by one 
primary winding in the centre of the former and the two secondary windings at the sides. The 
number of turns in both the secondary windings are equal, but they are opposite to each other, 
i.e., if the left secondary windings is in the clockwise direction, the right secondary windings 
will be in the anti-clockwise direction, hence the net output voltages will be the difference in 
voltages between the two-secondary coil. The two secondary coil is represented as S1 and S2. 
Esteem iron core is placed in the centre of the cylindrical former which can move in to and fro 
motion as shown in the figure 2.10. The AC excitation voltage is 5 to 12V and the operating 
frequency is given by 50 to 400 HZ.

Working of LVDT: 
The working of LVDT by splitting the cases into 3 based on the iron core position inside the 
insulated former. 
Case 1: When no external force, the core reminds in the null position itself without providing 
any movement then the voltage induced in both the secondary windings are equal which results 
in net output is equal to zero 
V0=V1-V2=0 
Case 2: When an external force is applied and if the steel iron core tends to move in the left-
hand side direction then the emf voltage induced in the secondary coil1 is greater when 
compared to the emf induced in the secondary coil 2. Therefore, the net output will be 
 V0=V1-V2= +ve 
Case 3: When an external force is applied and if the steel iron core moves in the right-hand 
side direction then the emf induced in the secondary coil 2 is greater when compared to the 
emf voltage induced in the secondary coil 1. Therefore, the net output voltage will be  
V0=V1-V2= -ve 
Applications of LVDT:  
➢ LVDT is used to measure displacement ranging from fraction millimetre to centimetre.

2.5 Force Sensor (Load Cell) 
2.5.1 Basic Principle of Strain gauge load cell: When steel cylinder is subjected to a force, 
it tends to change in dimension. On this cylinder, if the strain gauges are bonded, the strain 
gauge also is stretched or compressed, causing a change in its length and diameter. This change 
in dimension of the strain gauge causes its resistance to change. This change in resistance or 
output voltage of the strain gauge becomes a measure of applied force. 
2.5.2 Construction 
The main parts of the strain gauge load cell is shown in fig.211. They are a cylinder made up 
of steel on which four identical strain gauge are mounted and out of four strain gauges, two of 
them (R1 and R4) are mounted along the direction of the applied load (vertical gauges). The 
other two strain gauges (R2 and R3 Horizontal gauges) are mounted circumferentially at right 
angles to gauges R1 and R4. 
 
Fig. 2.11 Construction of Load Cell 
2.5.3 Operation of strain gauge Load cell 
These four gauges are connected in the form of bridge to convert the change in resistance to 
voltage as shown in fig. 2.12.  the output voltage Vout is given by 
 
Fig.2.12 Wheatstone Bridge and is output volage

11 | P a g e  
 
Case 1: When there is no load (force) on the steel cylinder, all the four gauges will have the 
same resistance. Hence the wheat stone bridge is balanced and hence the output voltage will 
be zero. 
Vout =0 
Case 2: Now the load (force) to be measured (say compression force) is applied on the steel 
cylinder. Due to this, the vertical gauges R1 and R4 will undergo compression and hence there 
will be a decrease in resistance. At the same time, the horizontal gauges R2 and R3 will undergo 
tension and there will be an increase in resistance. Thus, when strained, the resistance of the 
various gauges changes. Then the wheat stone bridge is unbalanced and hence the output 
voltage will not be zero. 
Vout  ≠0 
Now the change in output voltage due to the applied load (force) becomes a measure of the 
applied load force when calibrated. 
Applications: 
➢ Vehicle Weigh Bridges 
➢ Too force dynamo meters 
➢ Tension measurement of wires 
2.6 Temperature Sensors 
Detect or measure changes in temperature and converts into electrical signal. The types of 
temperature sensors as follows 
➢ Bi-metallic strips(4200C) 
➢ Thermocouples (-2000C to over +2000oC to be measured.) 
➢ Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) (-200 to +600oC.) 
➢ Thermistors (-50- 200oC) 
➢ Thermodiodes and thermotransistors (-50- 150oC) 
2.6.1 Bi-metallic strips 
Bonding two metals with dissimilar thermal expansion coefficients can produce useful devices 
for detecting and measuring temperature changes. A typical pair is brass and steel with typical 
expansion coefficients of 19 and 13 parts per million per degree Celsius respectively.

This principle is used in many applications. The most important application of bi-metallic strip 
as a thermal switch as shown in fig. 2.13 
 
Fig.2.13 Thermal Switch 
Advantages and disadvantages: 
➢ Power source not required2 
➢ Easy to use and cheap but not very accurate.  
➢ Can be used to 500 °C 
➢ Limited to applications where manual reading is acceptable, e.g. a household 
thermometer 
➢ Not suitable for very low temperatures because the expansion of metals tend to be too 
similar, so the device becomes a rather insensitive thermometer 
2.6.2 Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD) 
RTDs work on the principle that the electric resistance of a metal changes due to change in its 
temperature. On heating up metals, their resistance increases and follows a linear relationship 
as shown in Figure 2.5.2. The correlation is

Where Rt is the resistance at temperature T (°C) and R0 is the temperature at 0°C and α is the 
constant for the metal termed as temperature coefficient of resistance. The sensor is usually 
made to have a resistance of 100 Ω at 0°C

2.6.3 Thermistors 
Thermistor is a type of resistor used to measure temperature changes, relying on the change in 
its resistance with changing temperature. Thermistor is a combination of the words thermal and 
resistor. The symbol of thermistor is shown in fig.2.15

 A simple linear relationship between resistance and temperature is

 ΔR = k Δt 
where  ΔR = change in resistance 
     
Δt = change in temperature 
 
k = temperature coefficient of resistance 
Commercially available thermistors have nominal values of 1K,2K,10K,20K,100K etc,. 
Types of thermistors: 
Negative temperature co-efficient (NTC) thermistors: These are Mixture of metal oxides 
such as chromium, cobalt, iron, manganese and nickel pressed into a bead, disc or rod shape. 
 
Positive temperature co-efficient (PTC) thermistors: Positive temperature co-efficient 
thermistors are made-up of barium, lead and strontium titanite. these have limited use and they 
are particularly used for protection of motors and transformer winding. 
Characteristics of thermistors: Fig.2.16 shows characteristics of thermistors

2.6.4 Thermocouple 
Thermocouple works on the fact that when a junction of dissimilar metals heated, it produces 
an electric potential related to temperature. As per Thomas Seebeck (1821), when two wires 
composed of dissimilar metals are joined at both ends and one of the ends is heated, then there 
is a continuous current which flow in the thermoelectric circuit. Figure 2.17 shows the

schematic of thermocouple circuit. The net open circuit voltage (the Seebeck voltage) is a 
function of junction temperature and composition of two metals. It is given by, 
ΔVAB = αΔT 
Where α, the Seebeck coefficient, is the constant of proportionality. 
 
Fig. 2.17 Schematic of thermocouple circuit 
Generally, Chromel(90% nickel and 10% chromium)–Alumel(95% nickel, 2% manganese, 2% 
aluminium and 1% silicon) are used in the manufacture of a thermocouple. 
Applications of Thermocouples 
➢ To monitor temperatures and chemistry throughout the steel making process  
➢ Testing temperatures associated with process plants e.g. chemical production and 
petroleum refineries  
➢ Testing of heating appliance safety  
➢ Temperature profiling in ovens, furnaces and kilns  
➢ Temperature measurement of gas turbine and engine exhausts  
➢ Monitoring of temperatures throughout the production and smelting process in the steel, 
iron and aluminium industry 
2.6.5 Thermodiodes and thermotransistors 
A junction semiconductor pn junction diode is widely used as temperature sensor. When 
temperature of doped semiconductor changes the mobility of their charge carries changes and 
this effect the rate at which electrons and holes can diffuse across a pn junction. Thus, when 
pn junction diode as potential difference V across it. The current through the junction is a 
function of the temperature and is given by

Where temperature on kelvin scale. 
Thus, for a constant, current we have VD is proportional to the temperature on kelvin 
scale. So measurement of the potential difference across the diode for a constant current can 
be used as measure of temperature, such sensor is compact like thermistor and as the great 
advantage of giving a response which is linear function of temperature. Diodes for use of 
temperature sensor, together with necessary signal conditioning are supplied as integrated 
circuit eg. LM3911 and give very compact sensor. The output voltage from LM3911 is 
proportional to temperature at the rate 10mV/0C. 
In similar manner to the thermodiode, for a thermotransistor the voltage across the 
junction between the base and emitter depend on the temperature and can be used as a measure 
of temperature. A common method is to use two transistors with different collector current and 
determine the difference in the base emitter voltage between them, this difference is 
proportional to the temperature on kelvin scale. Such transistor with necessary signal 
conditioning are supplied as integrated circuit eg. LM35 and give very compact sensor. 
LM35: Integrated-circuit temperature sensor with an output voltage linearly-proportional to 
the Centigrade temperature and is shown in fig. 2.18

2.7 Light Sensors 
Light sensors are devices that are used to convert light energy into electrical energy. The 
commonly used sensors are 
➢ Light Dependent Resister (LDR) 
➢ Photo Diode 
➢ Photo transistor 
2.7.1 Light Dependent Resister (LDR)  
LDR is a device whose resistance is a function of amount of light falling on it. This is 
also called as Photoresistor, Photoconductor, Photoconductive cell or simply Photocells. 
Construction: Made up of with semiconductor materials having high resistance. Like 
cadmium sulphide, lead sulphide (PbS), lead selenide (PbSe), indium antimonide (InSb). 
Cadmium sulphide is used in the manufacture of photoconductive cells because its spectral 
response curve closely matches that of the human eye and can even be controlled using a simple 
torch as a light source. The LDR and its symbols are shown in fig. 2.19

Working principle: Photo conductivity is an optical phenomenon in which the materials 
conductivity is increased when light is absorbed by the material.  When photon of energy ℎ𝑣≥
𝐸𝑔 Incident on the semiconductor material. The electrons in the valance band gains the energy 
and exited to conduction band as shown in fig. 2.20. This process results in a greater number 
of carriers in the conduction band. Hence the conductivity of semiconductor material is 
increased. When there is no light, the resistance on the device is known as Dark Resistance. 
This is of the order of several MΩ.

2.7.2 Photodiode 
A photodiode is a type of photo detector capable of converting light energy into electrical 
energy. It is sometimes referred as photo-detector, photo-sensor, or light detector. The symbol 
of photodiode is shown in fig. 2.22 
 
Fig.2.22 Symbol of Photodiode 
Photodiodes are like regular semiconductor diode except that they may be either exposed (to 
detect UV or X-rays) or packaged with a window or optical fiber to allow light to reach the 
sensitive part of the device.  The made up with compounds of semiconductor materials like 
GaAs and InGaAs 
Photodiodes are classified into three types, they are 
a) PN Photodiode 
b) PIN Photodiode 
c) Avalanche Photodiode. 
PN Junction Photodiode: A photodiode is designed to operate in reverse bias as shown in fig.  
When there is no light a small reverse saturation current is flowing due to thermally generated 
minority charge carriers. The current in the circuit is known as Dark Current.  
When light energy is supplied to photodiode, the valence electrons in the depletion 
region gain the energy and come out from the atom. Hence new electron-hole pairs crated in 
the depletion region. The mechanism of generation of new electron-hole pairs by using light 
energy is known as photo electric effect and the carriers are called Light generated carriers or 
phot carriers. These carriers constitute a current in the external circuit and is known as Photo 
Current. The current flowing through the photodiode is directly proportional to the incident 
number of photons as shown in fig.2.23

2.7.3 Phototransistor 
Phototransistors are either tri-terminal (emitter, base and collector) or bi-terminal (emitter and 
collector) semiconductor devices which have a light-sensitive base region. Although all 
transistors exhibit light-sensitive nature, these are specially designed and optimized for photo 
applications. These are made of diffusion or ion-implantation and have much larger collector 
and base regions in comparison with the ordinary transistors. These devices can be either 
homojunction structured or heterojunction structured, as shown by Fig. 2.25 a and b, 
respectively. 
 
Fig. 2.25 (a) Homojunction   
 
 
Fig. 2.25 (b) Heterojunction   
Applications:  
➢ CD Players 
➢ Smoke detectors

21 | P a g e  
 
➢ Space Applications 
➢ Optical Communication 
In the case of homojunction phototransistors, the entire device will be made of a single 
material-type; either silicon or germanium. However to increase their efficiency, the 
phototransistors can be made of non-identical materials (Group III-V materials like GaAs) on 
either side of the pn junction leading to heterojunction devices. Nevertheless, homojunction 
devices are more often used in comparison with the hetero junction devices as they are 
economical. 
The circuit symbol for npn phototransistors is shown by Figure 2.26 which is nothing 
but a transistor (with or without base lead) with two arrows pointing towards the base indicating 
its sensitivity to light. Similar symbolic representation holds well even in the case of pnp 
phototransistors with the only change being the arrow at emitter pointing in, instead of out. 
 
Fig. 2.26 (a) Tri-terminal  
 
 
 
Fig. 2.26 (b) Bi-terminal 
 
Principle of Working:  The collector current equation of a transistor is given by 
𝐼𝐶= 𝛽𝐼𝐵+ (1 + 𝛽)𝐼𝐶𝐵𝑂 
In phototransistor the base is open that is IB= 0, then above equation becomes 
𝐼𝐶= 1 + 𝛽)𝐼𝐶𝐵𝑂 
In photodetector, ICBO is increased when collector base junction is illuminated by light. 
When ICBO is increased the collector, current is also increased for a given amount of 
illumination. Thus, phototransistor is a light detector which is combines photodiode and 
transistor amplifier. 
Applications: 
1. Monitoring paper position and margin in printers 
2. Punch card readers 
3. CD players 
4. Night vision light systems 
5. Counting coins and other items 
6. Security systems

2.8 Proximity Sensors: 
A proximity sensor is sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical 
contact. Proximity sensors often emits an electromagnetic field or beam of electromagnetic 
radiation(infrared) and looks for change in the field or return signal. The object being sensed 
is often referred to the proximity sensor target. Types of proximity sensors 
➢ Inductive 
➢ Capacitive 
➢ Optical  
➢ Ultrasonic 
2.8.1 Inductive proximity sensor 
An Inductive proximity sensor is a type of non-contact electric proximity sensor that is used to 
detect the presence and position of metallic objects. Inductive proximity sensor is shown in fig. 
2.27.  Their operating principle is based on a coil and high frequency oscillator that creates a 
field in the close surroundings of the sensing surface. The presence of metal in the operating 
area causes a change in the oscillation amplitude. This change is identified by a threshold 
circuit, which changes the output of the sensor. The operating distance of the sensor depends 
on the coil’s size as well as the target’s shape, size and material. The sensing range is rarely 
greater than 6 cm, however, and it has no directionality. 
 
 
Fig.2.27 Inductive proximity sensor 
Applications: 
➢ Common applications of inductive sensors include metal detectors, car washes, and a 
host of automated industrial processes.  
➢ Because the sensor does not require physical contact it is particularly useful for 
applications where access presents challenges or where dirt is prevalent.  
2.8.2 Capacitive proximity sensor 
Capacitive sensors are used for non-contact detection of metallic objects & non-metallic 
objects (liquid, plastic, wooden materials and so on). Capacitive proximity sensor is shown in 

MECHATRONICS                                                UNIT- II SENSORS 
 
23 | P a g e  
 
fig. 2.28.   Capacitive proximity sensors use the variation of capacitance between the sensor 
and the object being detected. When the object is at a preset distance from the sensitive side of 
the sensor, an electronic circuit inside the sensor begins to oscillate. The rise or fall of such 
oscillation is identified by a threshold circuit that drives an amplifier for the operation of an 
external load. 
 
Fig. 2.28 Capacitive proximity sensor 
Applications: 
➢ Capacitive touch sensors are used in many devices such as laptop track pads, digital 
audio players, computer displays, mobile phones, mobile devices and others.  
➢ More and more design engineers are selecting capacitive sensors for their versatility, 
reliability and robustness and cost reduction over mechanical switches. 
2.8.3 Optical proximity sensor 
Optical proximity sensors generally cost more than inductive proximity sensors, and about the 
same as capacitive sensors. They are widely used in automated systems because they have been 
available longer and because some can fit into small locations. These sensors are classified into 
three types 
➢ Through beam 
➢ Diffuse reflective 
➢ Retroreflective 
These optical sensors are shown in fig. 2.29 
 
Fig.2.29 (a) Through beam 
Fig. (b) Diffuse reflective  
Fig. (c) Retroreflective 
In all types of sensor if output is ON only object is present otherwise output is OFF.

2.8.4 Ultrasonic proximity sensor 
Ultrasonic sensors are sometimes used in place of optical sensors. Instead of using an light 
beam, a high frequency sound wave is used. This sound wave is above normal hearing 
frequencies and are called ultrasonic. Frequencies around 40KHz are common. 
 Subsonic sound: 20Hz 
 Sonic Sound :20-20KHz 
 Ultrasonic Sound: > 20KHz 
Working: The sensor first emits a short Ultrasonic Pulse 
 
and waits for the echo. 
 
When echo is retuned, the sensor detects the target is present and by measuring the time delay 
between transmitted pulse and the return echo the sensor calculates the distance between sensor 
and the object. 
 
Applications: 
➢ Ultrasonic sensors can measure the distance to a wide range of objects  
➢ Liquid Level Control/Monitoring 
➢ Trash Level Monitoring 
➢ Uses in Production Lines 
➢ Vehicle Detection for Car Washes, Automotive Assembly, and Parking Garage

to flow through the output circuit.

Solenoid 
Solenoid is a insulated copper coil is wound around some cylindrical cardboard or 
plastic tube such that the length of the coils is greater than its diameter, then it becomes like a 
magnet. 
 
Fig. 3.5 Solenoid working 
 3.2.1 Working 
Solenoid is an electromagnetic device made up of a coil which produces a magnetic 
field when electric current passed through it, then it is energized and attracts the ferrous core 
as shown in figure 3.5(b).  if supply is removed the coil is un-energized and releases the ferrous 
core as shown in figure 3.5(a). Such solenoids are used in relaying energy from one device to 
another. such solenoids are used mainly in opening and closing valves as shown in figure 2. 
Solenoid valves When the solenoid coil is energized, the valve opens, allowing water to flow 
from the reservoir into the fish tank. otherwise, valve is closed.

Solid-State switches are made up of with semiconductor material. The commonly use Solid-
State switches are Diodes, transistors, MOSFETS, thyristors etc,. 
3.3.1 Diode 
A pure silicon crystal or germanium crystal is known as an intrinsic semiconductor. 
There are not enough free electrons and holes in an intrinsic semi-conductor to produce a usable 
current. The electrical action of these can be modified by doping means adding impurity atoms 
to a crystal to increase either the number of free holes or no of free electrons. When a crystal 
has been doped, it is called a extrinsic semi-conductor. They are of two types 
➢ n-type semiconductor having free electrons as majority carriers 
➢ p-type semiconductor having free holes as majority carriers 
A junction is made by joining p-type semiconductor to n-type semiconductor a useful 
device is produced known as diode and it is shown in fig. 3.7. It will allow current to flow 
through it only in one direction. The unidirectional properties of a diode allow current flow 
when forward biased and disallow current flow when reversed biased.  
 
Fig.3.7 PN Junction diode 
Formation of Depletion Region or (Open circuited PN Junction): The open circuited pn 
junction diode is shown in fig. 3.8. In a P-N junction, there exists a concentration gradient near 
the junction. There is large number of holes on N side, near the junction. Those holes start

moving from P side to N side i.e. from high concentration area to low concentration area. This 
is nothing but diffusion of holes from P side to N side. Similarly, the electrons on N side start 
diffusing across the junction into the P region.

As holes enter the N region, they find number of donor atoms. The holes recombine 
with donor atoms. As donor atoms accept additional holes, they become positively charged 
immobile ions. Atoms on P side are acceptor atoms. The electrons diffusing from N side to P 
side recombine with the acceptor atoms on P side. As acceptor atoms accept additional 
electrons, they become negatively charged immobile ions. Such a large number of negatively 
charged ions get formed near the junction on P side.  
As more number of holes diffuses on N side, large positive charge will be accumulated 
on N side near the junction. Eventually in the same way large negative charge will be 
accumulated on P side near the junction. Such a region is depleted of free mobile charge carriers 
and hence it is called “depletion region” or “depletion layer”. The depletion region is also called 
“space charge region” if the depletion region can become widened up to a point where no 
further electrons are holes can cross the junction. Thus, depletion region can acts as the barrier. 
P-N Junction Diode: The P-N junction forms a popular semiconductor device called “P-N 
Junction Diode”. The P-N Junction has two terminals called as electrodes: one each from P 
region and N region. As there are two electrodes, it is called as diode i.e. di + electrode. The 
terminal connected to p-region is called Anode and the terminal connected to n-region is called 
cathode. The symbol of pn junction diode is shown in fig. 3.9

We can connect the diode in circuits in two ways. This is also called as biasing which 
means applying an external voltage. The biasing is of two types 
➢ Forward biasing 
 
➢ Reverse biasing 
Forward Biased PN Junction Diode: 
If an external voltage is connected in such a way that the P region terminal is connected 
to the positive of DC voltage and the N region is connected to the negative of the DC voltage, 
the biasing condition is called forward biasing. The forward biased pn junction is shown in 
fig.3.10. 
 
Fig.3.10 Forward biased PN Junction 
When we apply an external voltage more than the barrier potential, the negative 
terminal of battery pushes the electrons against barrier from N to P region. Similarly, positive 
terminal pushes the holes from P to N region. Thus, holes get repelled by positive terminal and 
cross the junction against barrier potential. This reduces the width of depletion region. As 
forward voltage increased, at a particular value the depletion region becomes zero such that 
large number of charge carriers can cross the junction, hence current starts flowing through the 
diode and it is shown in fig. 3.12. The voltage at which the diode starts conducting is known 
as cut-in voltage or threshold voltage or knee voltage. The cut -in voltage for silicon diode is 
0.7V and for germanium diode is 0.3V. Assuming current flowing through the diode to be very 
large, the diode can be approximated as short- circuited switch. 
Reverse Biased PN Junction Diode: 
When a diode is connected in a Reverse Bias condition, a positive voltage is applied to 
the N-type material and a negative voltage is applied to the P-type material. 
The positive voltage applied to the N-type material attracts electrons towards the 
positive electrode and away from the junction, while the holes in the P-type end are also

attracted away from the junction towards the negative electrode. The net result is that the 
depletion layer grows wider due to a lack of electrons and holes and presents a high impedance 
path, almost an insulator. The result is that a high potential barrier is created thus preventing 
current from flowing through the semiconductor material. But due to minory charge carries a 
small current called reverse saturation current continues to flow in the diode and which is of 
the order of micro-amperes, (μA). This current is negligible; the diode can be approximated as 
an open circuited switch.

3.3.2 Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) 
A transistor is basically a Si on Ge crystal containing three separate regions. It can be 
either NPN or PNP type. The middle region is called the base and the outer two regions are 
called emitter and the collector.  
In transistors, emitter is heavily doped. Its job is to emit or inject electrons into the base. 
These bases are lightly doped and very thin, it passes most of the emitter-injected electrons on 
to the collector. The doping level of collector is intermediate between the heavy doping of 
emitter and the light doping of the base. 
The collector is so named because it collects electrons from base. The collector is the 
largest of the three regions; it must dissipate more heat than the emitter or base. The transistor 
has two junctions. One between emitter and the base and other between the base and the 
collector. Because of this the transistor is similar to two diodes, one emitter base diode and 
other collector base diode. 
 
Operating Modes of Transistors: 
Depends on the biasing conditions like forward or reverse, transistors have three major 
modes of operation namely cut-off, active and saturation regions. 
Active Mode 
In this mode transistor is generally used as a current amplifier. In active mode, emitter-
base junction is forward biased whereas collector-base junction is reverse biased. In this mode, 
the current flows between emitter and collector and amount of current flow is proportional to 
the base current.

9 | P a g e  
 
 
Cut-off Mode 
In this mode, both collector base junction and emitter base junction are reverse biased. 
This in turn not allows the current to flow from collector to emitter when the base-emitter 
voltage is low. In this mode device is completely switched off as the result the current flowing 
through the device is zero. Hence in this mode transistor is acting as open switch. 
 
Saturation Mode 
In this mode of operation, both the emitter base and collector base junctions are forward 
biased. Current flows freely from collector to emitter when the base-emitter voltage is high. In 
this mode device is fully switched ON. Hence in this mode transistor is acting as closed switch. 
 
Characteristics of Transistors: 
The figure 3.13  shows the output characteristics of a BJT Transistor. In the figure 3.13 
cutoff region has the operating conditions as zero collector output current, zero base input 
current and maximum collector voltage. These parameters cause a large depletion layer which 
further doesn’t allow current to flow through the transistor. Therefore, the transistor is 
completely in OFF condition.

Fig.3.13 CE output Characteristics 
Similarly, in the saturation region, a transistor is biased in such a way that maximum 
base current is applied that results maximum collector current and minimum collector-emitter 
voltage. This causes the depletion layer to become small and to allow maximum current flow 
through the transistor. Therefore, the transistor is fully in ON condition. 
Hence, the transistors can be made to work as ON/OFF solid-state switch by operating 
transistor in cutoff and saturation regions. This type of switching application is used for 
controlling motors, lamp loads, solenoids, etc,.

Transistor will become ON (saturation ) when a sufficient voltage V is given to input. 
During this condition the Collector Emitter voltage Vce will be approximately equal to zero, 
i.e., the transistor acts as a short circuit. For a silicon transistor it is equal to 0.3v. Thus, collector 
current Ic = Vcc/Rc will flows. This is shown in fig. 3.14

3.3.3  MOSFET – Metal Oxide Field Effect Transistor. 
The MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) transistor is a 
semiconductor device which is widely used for switching and amplifying electronic signals in 
the electronic devices. The MOSFET is a three terminal device such as source, gate, and drain. 
The MOSFET is very far the most common transistor and can be used in both analog and digital 
circuits

The MOSFET works by varying the width of a channel along which charge carriers 
flow (holes and electrons).  The charge carriers enter the channel from the source and exits 
through the drain. The channel width is controlled by the voltage on an electrode is called gate 
which is located between the source and drain. It is insulated from the channel near an 
extremely thin layer of metal oxide.  
Types of MOSFET Devices 
The MOSFET is classified into two types such as 
➢ Depletion-type MOSFET or DE-MOSFET: The DE-MOSFET can be operated in both 
depletion mode and the enhancement mode. For this reason, it is also called 
depletion/enhancement MOSFET. 
➢ Enhancement-type MOSFET or E-MOSFET: The E-MOSFET can be operated only in 
enhancement mode. 
MOSFET Working Principle: 
The construction of MOSFET is shown in fig. 3.16. The working of MOSFET depends 
upon the metal oxide capacitor (MOS) that is the main part of the MOSFET. The oxide layer 
presents among the source and drain terminal. It can be set from p-type to n-type by applying 
positive or negative gate voltages respectively.  When apply the positive gate voltage the holes 
present under the oxide layer with a repulsive force and holes are pushed downward through 
the substrate. The deflection region populated by the bound negative charges which are allied 
with the acceptor atoms. 
 
Fig. 3.16 Construction of MOSFET  
 
Enhancement Type MOSFET:

13 | P a g e  
 
The Enhancement type MOSFET is also further classified into two types, they are n-
channel and p-channel and symbols are shown in below The figure 3.symbols for n-channel E-
MOSFET and the schematic symbol for p-channel E-MOSFET. 
 
 
The E-MOSFET has no channel between source and drain. The substrate extends 
completely to the SiO2 layer so that no channel exists. The E-MOSFET requires a proper gate 
voltage to form a channel, called induced channel between the source and the drain. It operates 
only in the enhancement mode and has no depletion mode. 
Only by applying VGS of proper magnitude and polarity, the device starts conducting. 
The minimum value of VGS of proper polarity that turns on the E-MOSFET is called threshold 
voltage [VGS(th)]. The n-channel MOSFET requires positive VGS (≥VGS(th)) and the p-channel 
MOSFET requires negative VGS(≥VGS(th)). 
Circuit Operation of E-MOSFET 
The circuit of n-channel E-MOSFE. The circuit action is as under: 
 
(i)  
When VGS= 0V, there is no channel connecting source and drain. The p-substrate has 
only a few thermally produced free electrons (minority carriers) so that drain current is 
almost zero. For this reason, E-MOSFET is normally OFF when VGS = 0V. 
(ii)  
When VGS is positive, i.e gate is made positive, it attracts free electrons into the p 
region. The free electrons combine with the holes next to the SiO2 layer. 

MECHATRONICS                                        UNIT- III ACTUATORS 
 
14 | P a g e  
 
 
If VGS is positive enough, all the holes touching the SiO2 layer are filled and free 
electrons begin to flow from the source to drain. The effect is same as creating a thin layer of 
n-type material i.e. inducing a thin n-layer adjacent to the SiO2 layer. Thus the E-MOSFET is 
turned ON and drain current ID starts flowing from the source to the drain. 
The minimum value of VGS that turns the E-MOSFET ON is called threshold 
voltage[VGS(th)]. 
(iii)  
When VGS is less than VGS(th), there is no induced channel and the drain current ID is 
zero. When VGS is equal to VGS(th), the E-MOSFET is turned ON and the induced 
channel conducts drain current from the source to the drain. 
Beyond VGS(th), if the value of VGS is increased, the newly formed channel becomes 
wider, causing to ID to increase. 
If the value of VGS decreases not less than VGS(th), the channel becomes narrower and 
ID will  decrease. 
Enhancement-mode N-Channel MOSFET characteristics 
 
Depletion type MOSFET: The depletion type MOSFET is also further classified into two 
types, they are n-channel and p-channel and symbols are shown in below 

MECHATRONICS                                        UNIT- III ACTUATORS 
 
15 | P a g e  
 
 
Operation: In a depletion type or DE-MOSFET, a channel for conduction is already 
constructed physically. Due to this, current flows in between the source and drain without any 
gate bias voltage. This means that the channel conducts even when VGS = 0. The fig.3.17 
shown below will help you to understand DE-MOSFET in a better way: 
 
Fig.3.17 N-Channel DE-MOSFET 
DE-MOSFET can be operated with both positive and negative gate potential. When the 
MOSFET is operated with 0 gate voltage it is said that the MOSFET is operating in E-mode. 
In a DE-MOSFET when the gate potential is made negative with respect to the substrate, it 
causes repulsion of negative charge carriers out of the initially formed channel. This increases 
the channel resistance which resultantly reduces the drain current.

3.3.4 THYRISTORS 
Thyristors are basically classified into three types 
➢ Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs) 
➢ DIAC (Diodes as AC Switch) 
➢ TRIAC (Triode as AC Switch) 
Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs): 
The SCR is a four-layered, three terminal semiconductor device, with each layer 
consisting of alternately N and P-type materials. The main terminals, labelled anode and 
cathode, and the control terminal, called the gate, is attached to p-type material near the 
cathode. These simply named as thyristors. 
➢ 
 
The SCR has three p-n junctions (serially named J1, J2 and J3 from the anode). 
➢ 
 
When the anode is at a positive potential VAK with respect to the cathode with no 
voltage applied at the gate, junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased, while junction J2 is reverse 
biased. As J2 is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if VAK is increased 
beyond the breakdown voltage VBO of the thyristor, avalanche breakdown of J2 takes place and 
the thyristor starts conducting (On state). 

MECHATRONICS                                        UNIT- III ACTUATORS 
 
18 | P a g e  
 
If a positive potential VG is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode, the 
breakdown of the junction J2 occurs at a lower value of VAK. By selecting an appropriate value 
of VG, the thyristor can be switched into the on state quickly. 
Once avalanche breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, 
irrespective of the gate voltage, until: (a) the potential VAK is removed or (b) the current 
through the device (anode−cathode) is less than the holding current specified by the 
manufacturer. Hence VG can be a voltage pulse. 
Switching characteristics 
In a conventional thyristor, once it has been switched on by the gate terminal, the device 
remains latched in the on-state (i.e. does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain 
in the on state), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (IL). As long as 
the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls 
below the holding current (IH).  
A thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become 
negatively biased. Fig. 3.19 VI characteristics of SCR 
 
Fig. 3.19 VI characteristics of SCR 
Applications 
Thyristors are semiconductor devices that are specifically designed for use in high-
power switching applications. Thyristors can operate only in the switching mode, where they 
act like either an open or closed switch and once triggered it will remain conducting. Therefore, 
in DC circuits and some highly inductive AC circuits the current has to be artificially reduced 
by a separate switch or turn off circuit.

3.3.5 TRIAC 
TRIAC, from triode for alternating current, is a generic trademark for a three 
terminal electronic component that conducts current in either direction when triggered. It’s 
also called as bidirectional triode thyristor or bilateral triode thyristor. The figure shows the 
circuit symbol for a TRIAC where A1 is Anode 1, A2 is Anode 2, and G is Gate. Anode 1 and 
Anode 2 are normally termed Main Terminal 1 (MT1) and Main Terminal 2 (MT2) 
respectively.  
 
TRIACs are a subset of thyristors. TRIACs differ from SCRs in that they allow current 
flow in both directions, whereas an SCR can only conduct current in a single direction. Most 
TRIACs can be triggered by applying either a positive or negative voltage to the gate (an SCR 
requires a positive voltage). Once triggered, SCRs and TRIACs continue to conduct, even if 
the gate current ceases, until the main current drops below a certain level called the holding 
current. 
TRIAC’s 
bidirectionality 
makes 
them 
convenient 
switches 
for alternating-
current (AC). This is commonly used for controlling the speed of induction motors, dimming 
lamps, and controlling electric heaters. 
Triac Characteristics: 
Typical V-I characteristics of a TRIAC are shown in figure 3.20. The TRIAC has on 
and off state characteristics like SCR but now the characteristic is applicable to both positive 
and negative voltages. This is expected because TRIAC consists of two SCRs connected in 
parallel but opposite in directions. 
TRIAC Applications: 
The TRIAC is most commonly used semiconductor device for switching and power 
control of AC systems as the TRIAC can be switched “ON” by either a positive or negative 
Gate pulse, regardless of the polarity of the AC supply at that time. This makes the TRIAC 
ideal to control a lamp or AC motor load with a very basic TRIAC switching circuit.

"Whenever a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a 
mechanical force". The direction of this force is given by Fleming's left-hand rule and its 
magnitude is given by 
F = BIL 
Where, B = magnetic flux density,  
 
 I = current and  
 
 L = length of the conductor. 
Same magnitude and opposite forces acting on left and right conductors causes 
torque(T=Fxr) is produce at circumference of the conductors. Because of this twisting force 
motor stars rotating in anticlockwise direction as shown in above figure 2. 
The direction of motor can be controlled by simply changing the supply terminals or 
interchanging of south and north poles. 
Back EMF: 
Once motor starts rotating, the conductors cuts the magnetic flux lines causes an emf is 
induced in the armature conductors according to the Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction 
and is given by 
 
Where N- speed of armature 
 
P- number of poles 
 
Φ- magnetic flux lines 
 
A- number of parallel paths 
 
Z- number of conductors 
The induced emf opposes the change cause it, according to Lenz’s Law. Here it opposes 
the supply voltage, hence it is called “Back emf”. 
Significance of Back EMF: Back EMF regulates flow of armature current to meet the load 
requirements. Hence dc motor acting as self-regulating machine. 
Magnitude of back emf is directly proportional to speed of the motor. Consider the load 
on a dc motor is suddenly reduced. In this case, required torque will be small as compared to 
the current torque. Speed of the motor will start increasing due to the excess torque. Hence, 
being proportional to the speed, magnitude of the back emf will also increase. With increasing 
back emf armature current will start decreasing. Torque being proportional to the armature 
current, it will also decrease until it becomes sufficient for the load. Thus, speed of the motor 
will regulate.

On the other hand, if a dc motor is suddenly loaded, the load will cause decrease in the 
speed. Due to decrease in speed, back emf will also decrease allowing more armature current. 
Increased armature current will increase the torque to satisfy the load requirement. Hence, 
presence of the back emf makes a dc motor ‘self-regulating’. 
Types of DC Motors  
DC motors are usually classified of the basis of their excitation configuration, as 
follows - 
➢ Separately excited (field winding is fed by external source) 
➢ Self-excited - 
• Series wound (field winding is connected in series with the armature) 
• Shunt wound (field winding is connected in parallel with the armature) 
• Compound wound -  
Separately excited motor: 
The separately excited motor has separate control of the armature and field currents. 
 
Series-wound: 
With the series-wound motor the armature and field coils are in series. Such a motor 
exerts the highest starting torque and has the gretest no-load speed. Reversing the polarity of 
the supply to the coils has no effect on the direction of rotation of the motor since both the field 
and armature currents have been reversed. 
 
Shunt-wound: 
With the shunt-wound motor the armature and field coils are in parallel. It provides 
lowest starting torque. It provides constant speed regardless of load. To reverse the direction 
of rotation either armature or field supply must be reversed.

Compound-wound: 
The compound motor has two field windings, one in series with the armature and one 
in parallel. The aim is to get the best features of the series and shunt-wound motors, such as 
high starting torque and good speed regulation. 
 
 
3.4.2 AC MOTORS 
3-Ø Induction Motor: 
The main body of the Induction Motor comprises of two major parts: 
1. Stator  
2.  Rotor 
Stator: The stator of an induction motor is in principle, the same as that of a synchronous motor 
(or) generator. It is made up of a number of stampings, which are slotted to receive the 
windings.  The stator carries a 3-phase winding and is fed from a 3-phase supply.  It is wound 
for a definite number of poles; the exact number of poles being determined by the requirements 
of speed.  The number of poles is higher, lesser the speed and vice-versa.  The stator winding, 
when supplied with a 3-phase currents, produce a magnetic flux, which is of constant 
magnitude but which revolves at synchronous speed and is given by 
Ns = 120 x f / p 
Where Ns= synchronous speed 
f = Frequency 
p = no. of poles 
This revolving magnetic flux induces emf in rotor by mutual induction.. Figure 3.23 shows 
construction of stator.

 Phase wound (or) slip-ring Rotor: 
 Squirrel cage Rotor: 
Almost 90 percentage of induction motors are squirrel-cage type, because this type of 
rotor has the simplest and most rugged construction imaginable and is almost indestructible. 
The Rotor consists of cylindrical laminated core with parallel slots for carrying the rotor 
conductors which, it should be noted clearly, are not wires but consists of heavy bars of copper, 
aluminium or alloys. One bar is placed in each slot; rather the bars are inserted from the end 
when semi-enclosed slots are used. The rotor bars are brazed or electrically welded or bolted 
to two heavy and stout short circuiting end-rings, thus giving us, what is called a squirrel cage 
construction and is shown in figure 3.24.

Principle and working: 
Induction motor works on the principle of electromagnetic induction.  When three phase 
supply is given to the stator winding, a rotating magnetic field of constant magnetic field is 
produced.  The speed of rotating magnetic field is synchronous speed, Ns in  r.p.m. 
 Ns = 120 x f / p 
Where Ns= synchronous speed 
f = Frequency 
p = no. of poles 
Now at this instant rotor is stationary and stator flux R.M.F. is rotating. So its obvious 
that there exists a relative motion between the R.M.F. and rotor conductors. Now the R.M.F. 
gets cut by rotor conductors as R.M.F. sweeps over rotor conductors.  Whenever a conductor 
cuts the flux, emf gets induced in it. So emf gets induced in the rotor conductors called rotor 
induced emf. This is electromagnetic induction.  As rotor forms closed circuit, induced emf 
circulates current through rotor called rotor current. 
 Any current carrying conductor produces its own flux. So rotor produces its flux called 
rotor flux. For assumed direction of rotor current, the direction of rotor flux is 
clockwise/anticlockwise. 
 The direction can be easily determined using right hand thumb rule. Now there are two 
fluxes, one R.M.F. and another rotor flux.  Both the fluxes interact with each. On left of rotor 
conductor, two fluxes are in same direction hence added up to get high flux area.  On right side 
of rotor conductor, two fluxes are in opposite direction hence they cancel each other to produce 
low flux area. So rotor conductor experiences a force from left to right, due to interaction of 
the two fluxes.  As all rotor conductor experiences a force, overall rotor experiences a torque 
and starts rotating. 
After rotor starts rotating it try to catch-up synchronous speed. Once rotor speed Nr 
reaches synchronous speed Ns. The relative motion between R.M.F and rotor is zero. Hence 
the rotor always slips by a synchronous speed.

3.4.3 STEPPER MOTOR 
A stepper motor is an electromechanical device which converts electrical pulses into 
discrete mechanical movements. The sequence of the applied pulses is directly related to the 
direction of motor shafts rotation. The speed of the motor shafts rotation is directly related to 
the frequency of the input pulses.

STEPPER MOTOR WORKING 
Stepper motors work on the principle of electromagnetism. There is a soft iron or 
magnetic rotor shaft surrounded by the electromagnetic stators. The rotor and stator have poles 
which may be teethed or not depending upon the type of stepper. When the stators are energized 
the rotor moves. 
TYPES OF STEPPER MOTOR: 
By construction the step motors come into three broad classes: 
➢ Permanent Magnet Stepper 
➢ Variable Reluctance Stepper 
➢ Hybrid Step Motor 
PERMANENT MAGNET STEPPER: 
➢ The rotor and stator poles are not teethed. 
➢ The rotor has alternative north and south poles parallel to the axis of the rotor shaft. 
➢ When a stator is energized, it develops electromagnetic poles. 
➢ The magnetic rotor aligns along the magnetic field of the stator. 
 
Operation:

VARIABLE RELUCTANCE STEPPER: 
It has a toothed non-magnetic soft iron rotor. When the stator coil is energized the rotor 
moves to have a minimum gap between the stator and its teeth. 
 
Operation: 
 
HYBRID STEPPER: 
A hybrid stepper is a combination of both permanent magnet and the variable 
reluctance. It has a magnetic teethed rotor which better guides magnetic flux to preferred 
location in the air gap.

Operation: 
 
If pulse is given to windings of stator, then the rotor teeths are aligned with stator teeth 
as shown in above figure. 
TYPES OF WINDING AND LEAD LEAD-OUT: 
Based on winding arrangement stepper motors are classified into two types. 
1. Uni polar Stepper motor 
2. Bipolar stepper motor 
In unipolar stepper motor pole may have one lead common i.e., center tapped. In bipolar stepper 
motor there is a single winding per phase. The direction of current needed to the changed by 
the driving circuit so that the driving circuit of the stepper motor becomes complex.

3.5 MECHANICAL ACTUATORS 
3.5.1 GEARS 
Gear trains are used to transfer and transform rotational motion. They are used when a 
change in speed or torque of a rotating device is needed. e.g. the car gear box enables the driver 
to match the speed and torque requirements of the terrain with the engine power available. 
Rotary motion can be transferred from one shaft to another by a pair of rolling cylinders. 
The transfer of the motion between the two cylinders depends on the frictional forces between 
the two surfaces in contact. Slip can be prevented by the addition of meshing teeth to the two 
cylinders also gears can be used to transfer rotating motion for shafts which have axis inclined 
to one another, i.e. the two shafts intersect (bevel gears) 
Slip can be prevented by the addition of meshing teeth to the two cylinders 
 
Fig. Two meshed gears 
When two gears in mesh the larger gear wheel is called the spur (or crown wheel), the smaller 
is called the pinion. 
Gears basically classified into two types based on their axes and they are shown in fig. 
3.26 
 
Fig.3.26 (a) Parallel gear axes, (b) axes inclined to one another 
Parallel shaft gears: These are further divided into spur, helical, double helical and Rack and 
penion are shown in fig. 3.27 
Spur gears: have axial teeth with the teeth cut along axial lines parallel to the axis of the shaft  
Helical gears: helical teeth with teeth being cut on helix helical gears have the advantage of 
smoother drive and prolonged life of gears, however, the inclination of the teeth results in an 
axial force component on the shaft bearing which can be overcome by using double helical 
teeth.

Gear ratio: 
Consider meshed wheels A & B. A with 40 teeth and B with 80 teeth. 
 
Wheel B must have twice the diameter of wheel A. Gear ratio is used for the ratio of 
the angular speeds of a pair of intermeshed gear wheels 
Types of gear trains:  
Simple gear train: The simple gear train is shown in fig. 3.28 and this term is used for a system 
where each shaft carries only one gear wheel here we have 
 
 
Fig. 3.28 Simple gear train 
The intermediate wheel B is termed the idler wheel is used to change the direction of rotation 
of the output wheel. 
The compound gear train: The compound gear train is shown in fig.3.29 and this term is used 
to describe a gear train when two (or more) wheels are mounted on a common shaft. When two

wheels are mounted on the same shaft, they have the same angular velocity. Thus, for both 
compound gear trains. 
 
 
Fig. 3.29 Compound gear trains 
3.5.2 BELT & CHAIN DRIVES 
Belt Drives is essentially a pair of rolling cylinders with the motion of one cylinder being 
transferred to the other by a belt. The transmitted torque is due to differences in tension that 
occur in the belt during operation. This difference results in a tight side and slack side for the 
belt. If  the tension on the tight side is T1 and that on the slack side is T2 then: Torque on A 
=(T1-T2)rA Torque on B=( T1-T2)rB 
 
rA and rB are the radius of A and B 
If belt speed is v then angular speed for A and B are: 
 
Power on either pulley is: 
 
If distances between shafts are large, then a belt drive is more suitable than gears. 
Forms of reversing drives: two forms of reversing belt dives are shown in fig. 3.30.

Types of belts: Types of belts are shown in fig.3.31

to keep the belts from running off the pulleys  
Round: Has circular cross section and is used with grooved pulleys  
V belts: Used with grooved pulleys, less efficient than flat belts  
Timing belts: Required toothed wheels; it can run at slow or fast speed, does not stretch or 
slip 
 
Fig. 3.31 Types of belts 
CHAINS 
➢ Slip can be prevented by the use of chains which lock into teeth on the rotating 
cylinders.  
➢ The drive mechanism used with bicycle is an example of a chain drive.  
➢ It enables a number of shafts to be driven by single wheel and so give a multiple drive 
3.5.3 BEARINGS 
The main function of a rotating shaft is to transmit power from one end of the line to the other.  
▪ It needs a good support to ensure stability and frictionless  rotation.  
▪ The support for the shaft is known as “bearing”. 
✓ The shaft has a “running fit” in a bearing. Whenever there is a relative motion of one 
surface in contact with another either by rotating or sliding, the frictional forces 
generate heat which waste the energy and results in wear. 
✓ All bearing is provided some lubrication arrangement to reduced friction between shaft 
and bearing. 
 
Bearings are machine elements which are used to support a rotating member viz., a 
shaft. The bearings are classified based on the type of contact they have between the rotating 
and the stationary member

Sliding contact bearings are classified in three ways.  
 
 
1. Based on type of load carried  
 
 
2. Based on type of lubrication  
 
 
3. Based on lubrication mechanism  
 
Based on type of load carried: 
 
 
     a) Radial bearing  
b) Axial bearing 
 
c) Angular bearing 
➢ Radial bearing carries radial load 
➢ Axial bearing carries axial load 
➢ Angular bearing carries both radial and axial loads.

The type of lubrication means the extent to which the contacting surfaces are separated 
in a shaft bearing combination. This classification includes

c. Boundary lubricated bearings 
d. Solid film lubricated bearings  
 
ROLLING CONTACT BEARINGS 
• 
Rolling contact bearings are also known as anti-friction bearing due to its 
low friction characteristics between ball and inner and outer rings.  
• 
Rolling contact bearings are used for radial load, thrust load and combination of these 
both loads.  
• 
Rolling contact bearings are often used due to its lower price, less maintenance cost and 
easy to operate. 
Parts of Rolling contact bearings 
• Outer race (also called outer ring or cup) 
• Inner race (also called inner ring or cone) 
• Rolling elements (either balls or rollers) 
• Separator (also called cage or retainer) 
Rolling Contact bearings are of two types they are: 
➢ Ball bearing: Point contact between shaft and bearing. 
➢ 
Roller bearing: Line contact between shaft and bearing.

4.1  
SIGNAL CONDITIONING  
In electronics, signal conditioning means manipulating an analog signal in such a way 
that it meets the requirements of the next stage for further processing. Most common use is in 
analog-to-digital converters. 
A basic measurement system consists mainly of the three blocks: sensing element, 
signal conditioning element and signal processing element, as shown in fig.4.1. The sensing 
element converts the non-electrical signal (e.g. temperature) into electrical signals (e.g. 
voltage, current, resistance, capacitance etc.). The job of the signal conditioning element is to 
convert the variation of electrical signal into a voltage level suitable for further processing. 
The next stage is the signal processing element. It takes the output of the signal conditioning 
element and converts into a form more suitable for presentation and other uses (display, 
recording, feedback control etc.).

POWER SUPPLY UNIT 
In most of our electronic products or projects we need a power supply for converting 
mains AC voltage to a regulated DC voltage. For making a power supply following 
components is essential. 
1. Transformer 
2. Rectifier 
3. Filter 
4. Regulator 
The basic block diagram of power supply unit is shown in fig.4.2.

Fig. 4.2 Components of linear power supply 
The Transformer: 
The transformer takes the AC voltage (230V, 50Hz), and supplies AC voltage at required 
level. If we want to obtain a final DC voltage of 12 volts, the secondary windings of the 
transformer must have an AC voltage 16.92V 
Vp = 12 x 1.41 = 16.92 volts. 
This can be achieved by selecting transformer turns ratio, and is given by 
(N1/N2) = (V1/V2) 
Where V1= transformer primary voltage 
V2= transformer secondary voltage 
N1= number of turns of primary 
N2= number of turns of secondary 
The rectifier: 
The rectifier transforms the secondary winding AC voltage into a pulsating DC voltage. (look 
at the diagram. Various forms of rectifier circuit are available.  
 Half-wave rectifier 
 Full-wave rectifier 
 Bridge rectifier 
The Filter: 
The output of rectifier contains DC component as well as Ac component. Filters are used to 
minimise the undesirable AC. Some Important filters are 
 Inductor filter  
 Capacitor filter 
 LC filter 
 CLC filter

The Voltage regulator: 
The output voltage of power supply changes whenever the input voltage and load 
changes. Hence the output of filter is connected to a regulator. A voltage regulator is an 
electronic circuit that provides stable D voltage independent of load, temperature and AC 
input variations. The zener diode normally used in voltage regulators. These available in IC 
forms with different output voltages

OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS (OP-AMP) 
An Operational Amplifier is an integral part of any signal conditioning circuit. Op-Amp is an 
amplifier which will perform analog mathematical operations. The symbol of Op-Amp is shown in 
Fig.4.3. 
 
Fig. 4.3 Symbol of Op-Amp 
Ideal characteristics of Op-Amp: 
 Infinite Open-Loop Gain 
 Infinite Input Impedance

4 | P a g e  
 
 Zero Output Impedance 
 Zero Noise Contribution 
 Zero output Offset 
 Infinite Bandwidth 
 Zero drift 
Op- amps are available in IC form. The most commonly used op-amp IC is IC 741. It has 8 pins as 
shown in fig. 4.4 
 
Fig. 4.4 Pin diagram of IC 741. 
Operation: Ideally the op-amp amplifies only the difference in voltage between the two 
inputs, which is called the differential input voltage. The output voltage of the op-amp Vout 
is given by the equation  
Vout = AOL (V+ - V- ) 
where AOL is the open-loop gain of the amplifier (the term "open-loop" refers to the absence 
of a feedback loop from the output to the input). 
V+  = voltage at non-inverting terminal 
V- = voltage at inverting terminal 
Open loop configuration of Op-Amp: 
 
The magnitude of AOL is typically very large (100,000 or more for integrated circuit 
op-amps), and therefore even a quite small difference between V+ and V− drives the amplifier 
output nearly to the supply voltage. Situations in which the output voltage is equal to or 
greater than the supply voltage are referred to as saturation of the amplifier. This 
configuration is used for realization of Comparator and Anolg to digital converters. 
4.3.1  Op-Amp as a Comparator 
With reference to the op-amp comparator circuit as shown in fig. 4.5, lets first assume 
that VIN is less than the DC voltage level at VREF, ( VIN < VREF ). As the non-inverting 

MECHATRONICS                                     UNIT- IV SIGNAL CONDITIONING CIRCUITS 
 
5 | P a g e  
 
(positive) input of the comparator is less than the inverting (negative) input, the output will be 
LOW and at the negative supply voltage, -Vcc resulting in a negative saturation of the output. 
If we now increase the input voltage, VIN so that its value is greater than the reference 
voltage VREF on the inverting input, the output voltage rapidly switches HIGH towards the 
positive supply voltage, +Vcc resulting in a positive saturation of the output. 
 
Fig. 4.5 Op-Amp as a comparator 
Closed loop configuration of Op-Amp: If predictable operation is desired, negative feedback is 
used, by applying a portion of the output voltage to the inverting input. 
 
This configuration is used for realization of several mathematical operations like 
addition, subtraction, integration, differentiation etc,. 
4.3.2  Inverting Amplifier 
The output of inverting amplifier is 1800 out of phase with respect to input. The circuit

It consists of resistive divider network, comparators and priority encoder. For n-bit 
digital output, the number of comparators required is 2n. This is fastest among all ADCs. The 
circuit diagram of Flash type (parallel comparator) ADC is shown in fig. 4.13.

Advantages:  
 It is simplest in terms of operational theory. 
 Most efficient in terms of speed 
Disadvantages:

 Expensive 
 For each additional output the number of comparators are doubled. 
4.5.2  Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC 
 
Fig. 4.14 Circuit diagram of Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC 
It is most popularly used ADC, it works on the principle of successive approximation 
algorithm. Successive approximation algorithm is a simple code searching algorithm. When 
Start of Conversion (SOC) is given its simply generate MSB=1 remaining all bits equal to 
zero. If comparator output is one it sets next MSB=1 otherwise current MSB=0 next will be 
1. This process is repeated until VA=VD. Once conversion is completed it generate End of 
Conversion (EOC) signal. This algorithm is shown below table for 8-bit output. The circuit 
diagram of Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC is shown in fig. 4.14.

SPEED CONTROL DC MOTOR USING PWM 
Pulse-width modulation (PWM) or duty-cycle variation methods are commonly used 
in speed control of DC motors. The duty cycle is defined as the percentage of digital ‘high’ to 
digital ‘low’ plus digital ‘high’ pulse-width during a PWM period.

ܶைே+ ܶைிி
 
 Fig. 1 shows the 5V pulses with 0% through 50% duty cycle.

The average DC voltage of PWM signal = ܸሺܦݑݐݕ ܿݕ݈ܿ݁ሻ= ܸ൬
ܶைே
ܶைே+ ܶைிி
൰ 
The average DC voltage value for 0% duty cycle is zero; with 25% duty cycle the 
average value is 1.25V (25% of 5V). With 50% duty cycle the average value is 2.5V, and if 
the duty cycle is 75%, the average voltage is 3.75V and so on. The maximum duty cycle can 
be 100%, which is equivalent to a DC waveform. Thus by varying the pulse-width, we can 
vary the average voltage across a DC motor and hence its speed.  
The arduino mega 2560 is having 14 PWM (analog) outputs with 8-bit resolution. 
These pins we can generate variable analog voltages between 0V-5V by using anlogWtite 
(pin,value). Here value is range from 0 to 255. 
 
5.2  
STEPPER MOTOR CONTROL 
  
We can control the stepper motor using stepping modes of stepper motor. The 
stepping mode refers to the pattern of sequence in which stator coils are energized. There are 
three stepping modes for a stepper motor. 
 Wave drive (One phase ON at a time) 
 Full drive (Two phase ON at a time) 
 Half drive (One and two phase ON at a time)

5.3  SPEED CONTROL OF A D.C. MOTOR USING SCR 
In the speed control circuit of Fig.5.2., an RC network is used to control the diac 
voltage that triggers the gate of a thyristor. As the a.c. supply is switched ON, 
thyristor T remains OFF but the capacitor C is charged through motor armature 
and R towards the peak value of the applied a.c. voltage. The time it takes for the capacitor 
voltage VC to reach the breakover voltage of the diac depends on the setting of the variable 
resistor T. When VC becomes equal to the breakover voltage of diac, it conducts and a 
triggering pulse is applied to the thyristor gate G. Hence, T is turned ON and allows current 
to pass through the motor. Increasing R delays the rise of VC and hence the breakover of diac 
so that thyristor is fired later in each positive half cycle of the a.c. supply. It reduces the 
conduction angle of the thyristor which, consequently, delivers less power to the motor. 
Hence, motor speed is reduced. 
If R is reduced, time-con- stant of the RC network is de- creased which allows VC to 
rise to the breakover voltage of diac more quickly. Hence, it makes the thyristor fire early in 
each positive input half-cycle of the supply. Due to increase in the conduction angle of the 
thyristor, power delivered to the motor is increased with a subsequent in- crease in its speed. 
As before D is the free-wheeling diode which provides circulating current path for the energy 
stored in the inductance of the armature winding.
