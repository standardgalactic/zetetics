Annotation
Driven by famine from their home in the Rif, Mohamed's family
walks to Tangiers in search of a better life. But his father is unable to
find work and grows violent, beating Mohamed's mother and killing his
sick younger brother in a moment of mad rage.
On moving to another province Mohamed learns how to charm and
steal, and discovers the joys of drugs, sex and alcohol. Proud, insolent
and afraid of no-one, Mohamed returns to Tangiers, where he is caught
up in the violence of the 1952 independence riots. During a short spell in
a filthy Moroccan jail, a fellow inmate kindles Mohamed's life-altering
love of poetry.
The book itself was banned in Arab countries for its sexual
explicitness. Dar al-Saqi was the first publishing house to publish it in
Arabic in 1982, thirty years after it was written, though many translations
came out before the Arabic version.
Translated by Paul Bowles.
Mohamed Choukri is one of North Africa's most controversial and
widely read authors. At the age of twenty he decided to learn to read and
write classical Arabic. He went on to become a teacher and writer,
finally being awarded the chair of Arabic Literature at Ibn Batuta
College in Tangier.
Paul Bowles, perhaps best known for his novel The Sheltering Sky,
collaborated closely with Choukri on the translation of For Bread Alone.
The story of Choukri's life is continued in Streetwise.

Mohamed Choukri 
For Bread Alone 

Introduction 
Because I have translated several books from the Arabic I want to
make a clear differentiation between the earlier volumes and the present
work. The other books were spoken onto tape and the words were in the
colloquial Arabic called Maghrebi. For Bread Alone is a manuscript,
written in classical Arabic, a language I do not know. The author had to
reduce it first to Moroccan Arabic for me. Then we used Spanish and
French for ascertaining shades of meaning. Although exact, the translation
is far from literal.
It has been my experience that the illiterate, not having learned to
classify what goes into his memory, remembers everything. This too is a
technique. Total recall is like perfect pitch: it means nothing in itself, but
it can be extremely helpful to the writer who uses it professionally. It
seems almost a stroke of good luck that Choukri’s encounter with the
written word should have come so late, for by then his habits of thought
were already fully formed; the educative process did not modify them.
As a writer, then, he is in an enviable position, even though he paid a
high price for it in suffering.
Choukri grew up under conditions of poverty excessive even for
Morocco. Eight of his brothers and sisters died of malnutrition and
neglect. Another brother was killed outright by Choukri’s father in an
access of hunger and desperation. Mohamed and one or two others
managed to survive, even under these worst possible circumstances. For
Bread Alone records his struggle for survival, up to the time the young
man made the resolve to become literate. To have taken and implemented
such a decision at the age of twenty is unusual.
To have passed in the space of five years from learning the letters of
the alphabet to writing poems and stories is even more unexpected.

Surrounded by the other boys of the neighbourhood, I stand crying.
My uncle is dead. Some of them are crying, too. I know that this is not the
same kind of crying as when I hurt myself or when a plaything is snatched
away. Later on I began to see that many people cried. That was at the
time of the great exodus from the Rif. There had been no rain, and as a
result there was nothing to eat.
One afternoon I could not stop crying. I was hungry. I had sucked my
fingers so much that the idea of doing it again made me sick to my
stomach. My mother kept telling me: Be quiet. Tomorrow we’re leaving
for Tangier. There’s all the bread you want there. You won’t be crying
for bread any more, once we get to Tangier.
My little brother Abdelqader was too sick to cry as I did. Look at
your little brother, she told me. See how he is. Why can’t you be like
him?
I stare at his pallid face and his sunken eyes and stop crying. But
after a few moments I forget to be inspired by his silence, and begin once
more to cry.
When my father came in I was sobbing, and repeating the word
bread over and over. Bread. Bread. Bread. Bread. Then he began to slap
and kick me, crying: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! If you’re hungry, eat your
mother’s heart. I felt myself lifted into the air, and he went on kicking me
until his leg was tired.
We were making our way towards Tangier on foot. All along the
road there were dead donkeys and cows and horses. The dogs and crows
were pulling them apart. The entrails were soaked in blood and pus, and
worms crawled out of them. At night when we were tired we set up our
tent. Then we listened to the jackals baying.
When someone died along the road, his family buried the body there
in the place where he had died. After we had set out Abdelqader began
to cough, and the cough grew worse as we went along. Fearful for his
sake and my own, I said to my mother:
Will Abdelqader die too?

No, of course not. Who said he was going to die?
My uncle died.
Your brother’s not going to die. He’s sick, that’s all.
I did not see as much bread in Tangier as my mother had promised
me I should. There was hunger even in Eden, but at least it was not a
hunger that killed. One day when the hunger had grown too strong, I went
out to Aïn Ketiout to look in the garbage dump for bones and ends of dry
bread. I found another boy there before me. He was barefoot and his
clothes were in shreds. His scalp was covered with ringworm, his arms
and legs scarred with sores.
The garbage in the middle of town is a lot better than it is here, he
said. Nazarene garbage is the best.
After that I wandered further afield in search of food, sometimes
alone, sometimes with another boy who was looking for the same thing.
One day I found a dead hen. I seized it and hugged it close, for fear
someone would snatch it away.
Mother in the city, Abdelqader propped against the cushions. His
huge eyes, half shut, watched the entrance door. He sees the hen, and his
eyes open wide. He smiles, his thin face flushes, he moves, coughs. I find
the knife. I turn towards the east, as my mother always does when she is
about to pray.
I said: Bismillah. Allahou akbar. And I kill it as I have seen grown-
ups do it.
I drew the knife back and forth across its throat until its head fell
off. I was waiting to see the blood come out.
I massage the bird a little. Maybe it will come out now.
A few drops of blackish blood appeared in its open gullet. In the Rif
I had watched them kill a sheep. They put a bowl under its throat to catch
the blood. When the bowl was full they gave it to my mother, who was
sick in bed. They held her down and made her drink it. Her face and
clothing were smeared with it. Why doesn’t the blood come out of the
hen the way it did with the sheep?
I began to pull off the feathers.
I hear her voice. What are you doing? Where did you steal that?

I found it. It was sick. But I killed it before it died.
You’re crazy. She pulled it away from me. People don’t eat carrion.
My brother and I exchanged a glance of regret. The hen was lost.
Each afternoon my father comes home disappointed. Not a
movement, not a word, save at his command, just as nothing can happen
unless it is decreed by Allah. He hits my mother. Several times I have
heard him tell her: I’m getting out. You can take care of those two whelps
by yourself.
He pours some snuff onto the back of his hand and sniffs it, all the
while talking to himself. Bitch. Rotten whore. He abuses everyone with
his words, sometimes even Allah.
My little brother cries as he squirms on the bed. He sobs and calls
for bread.
I see my father walking towards the bed, a wild light in his eyes. No
one can run away from the craziness in his eyes or get out of the way of
his octopus hands. He twists the small head furiously. Blood pours out of
the mouth. I run outdoors and hear him stopping my mother’s screams
with kicks in the face. I hid and waited for the end of the battle.
The voices of the night, far away and near. For the first time I
realize that I can hear better at night than by day. I looked up at the sky.
Allah has turned on the lights. Clouds sail across the face of the big lamp.
My mother’s ghost appears. She is calling me in a low voice, searching
for me in the darkness as she sobs. Why is she so weak? Why isn’t she
strong enough to hit him as hard as he hits her? Men hit. Women scream
and weep.
Mohamed! Come here! There’s nothing to be afraid of. Come here.
It gave me great pleasure to see her knowing that she could not see
me. A little god.
After a while I said: Here I am.
Come here.
No. He’ll kill me. He killed Abdelqader.
Don’t be afraid. Come. He’s not going to kill you. Come on. But be
quiet, so you won’t wake the neighbours.
He was in the room taking snuff and sobbing. I was astonished. He

kills Abdelqader and then he cries about it.
They sat up all night, weeping silently. I went to sleep and left them
sobbing together. In the morning we cried again, all of us. It was the first
time I had seen a funeral. My father walked behind the old man who
carried the litter, and I followed at the back, lame and barefoot.
They drop him into the wet hole. I cry and shiver. There is a mass of
coagulated blood beside his mouth.
On the way back home the old man noticed the blood coming up
between my toes, and spoke to me in Riffian. What’s that?
He stepped on some glass, said my father. He doesn’t even know
how to walk. He’s an idiot.
Did you love your brother very much? the old man asked me.
Yes, I said. And my mother loved him more. She loved him more
than she did me.
All people love their children, he said.
I thought of how my father had twisted Abdelqader’s neck. I wanted
to cry out: He killed him! Yes. He killed him. I saw him kill him. He did
it. He killed him! I saw him. He twisted his neck around, and the blood
ran out of his mouth. I saw it. I saw him kill him! He killed him!
To ease the unbearable hatred I felt for my father I began to cry.
Then I was afraid he was going to kill me too. He began to scold me in a
low voice loaded with menace. Stop that. You cried enough at home.
Yes, said the old man. Stop crying. Your brother is with Allah. With
the angels.
I hate even the old man who buried my brother.
Every day he bought tobacco and a sack of white bread. He goes
somewhere far from Tangier to barter with the Spanish soldiers in their
barracks. Each afternoon he comes in carrying uniforms. He sells them in
the Zoco de Fuera to workmen and poor people.
One afternoon he did not come back. I went to bed, leaving my
mother bathed in tears. We waited three days. I wept with her, certain
that I did it only to console her. I did not ask her why she was crying. She
does not love him, I know.
I find out why she is crying only when she tells me. Here we are, all

alone. Who’s going to help us? We don’t know anybody in this city. Your
grandmother Rouqaiya, your Aunt Fatima and your Uncle Driss have all
gone to Oran. Your father deserted from the Spanish army. They were
looking for him. They must have found him.
We learned later that this had been the case. He had refused to sell a
blanket to a Moroccan soldier who wanted it at a very low price, and the
soldier had denounced him to the authorities.
She goes to the city in search of work. She comes back
disappointed, just as my father used to do when we first arrived in
Tangier. She sits biting her nails distractedly. She sobs. Sorcerers make
her talismans to wear around her neck; perhaps my father will get out of
prison and she will find work. She says her prayers and lights candles at
the tombs of the saints. She looks for luck at the fortune-teller’s. There is
no way out of prison, there is no work, no luck, save by order of Allah
and Muhammad his prophet; this is what she says. I began to think: Why
doesn’t Allah give us our good luck the way he gives it to other people?
I passed the question to my mother. That’s something we can’t ask,
she said. He knows much better than we do, and when he wants us to
know, he’ll tell us.
She sold some things we did not need, and sent me with some other
boys of the neighbourhood to pick some rosemary for her. I was afraid
the boys were going to hurt me. There was no friend among them who
would come to my aid if they should all jump on me at once. It had often
happened. I would get into a fight with one, and they would all attack me.
They helped each other.
I stayed well behind them in the middle of the road. Then I turned
and went down to the city. I like the way it moves. In the Zoco de Fuera I
filled my stomach with cabbage leaves and orange peel.
A policeman is chasing another boy, older than I. Not much distance
between them. I imagine I am the boy. I felt myself panting with him.
People were crying: He’s going to catch him! He’s going to catch him!
He’s going to catch him! There he goes! He’s got him!
I trembled. I felt fear, as if I had been caught myself. I would have
asked Allah not to let them catch him. But they have already caught him. I

hate the people who wanted the policeman to catch him.
A breathless European woman arrived and stood behind the small
group of people that had been watching the capture.
It was one like that, she said.
All he left was the handle of the bag, someone was saying.
A second later I felt the blow of a nightstick on my buttocks. I leapt
into the air, crying out in Riffian: Ay mainou! Ay mainou!
I imagined myself cursing the man. There were two other policemen
now, beating the boys and pushing the men. Some of the more poorly
dressed men got blows, too. I had thought that the police beat you and
took you to jail only if you had killed or robbed somebody, or drawn his
blood in a fight.
I went to the graveyard in Bou Araqia. Large bunches of myrtle had
been left on some of the richer tombs. I gathered them up and carried
them to my brother’s grave. There were many graves without tiles
marking them, and without myrtle on them, like my brother’s. A mound of
earth and two stones of different shapes, one for the head and one for the
feet. The sight of the neglected graves hurt me. I thought: Even here in the
cemetery there are rich people and poor people.
I found big clumps of rosemary growing there among the graves.
There were three men passing a bottle from one to the other and drinking
a dark liquid from it. One of them called to me: Hey! Come here, boy!
Agi!
I was afraid. I fled.
At lunch she said to me: That rosemary is very sweet.
We both had good appetites.
Yes, it’s sweet, I said.
Where did you pick it?
In the graveyard at Bou Araqia.
The graveyard!
Yes.
She stares at me open-mouthed.
I went to see Abdelqader’s grave. I put a little myrtle on it. The
mound is not very high now. If it stays the way it is, all the dirt is going to

be gone, and we won’t be able to tell it apart from the others.
She stopped eating and her features froze.
I went on: There’s lots of that rosemary there growing around the
old graves.
Don’t you know you’re not supposed to eat anything that grows in a
cemetery?
Why not?
She looked at me anxiously. I go on eating with relish. She is
worried. Her appetite is gone. I thought for a moment that she was going
to vomit. She seized the plate from which I was eating and took it away,
saying in Riffian: Eat yourself up.
After a moment she asked me: Where did you get the myrtle?
Off some other graves. They had lots of it.
She stared. Tomorrow you’re going back to the cemetery and take
the myrtle to the same graves where you found it. Don’t you know what
graves are? And be careful nobody sees you putting the myrtle back.
We’ll buy our own myrtle for your brother. We’ll make him a beautiful
grave when we’ve saved a little money.
It was a great relief not to have my father in the house, but the small
amount of money he had left there was soon gone. I longed to grow up
quickly so I would be able to do the same sort of work he had done. In
my fantasies it was taken for granted that he would never return. It was
inadmissible that he should ever again have a part in the life I shared
with my mother.
Sometimes she takes me with her to the Zoco de Fuera. We buy a
huge pile of dry bread from the beggars. We take it home to boil in water,
sometimes with a little oil and pepper, sometimes without. Early one
morning she said to me: I’m going to the market to buy and sell
vegetables. You stay here. Take good care of the house. Don’t go and
play with the other boys and leave the door open for thieves to come in.
I began to be aware of certain differences between myself and the
other boys of the neighbourhood, even though some of them were poorer
than I. I had seen one of them pull chicken bones out of a garbage pail
and suck them. The garbage here is good, he had said.

I hear them talking among themselves about me.
He’s a Riffian.
They’re starving to death. They’re all criminals.
He can’t even speak Arabic.
The Riffians are all sick this year.
The cows and sheep they brought with them are sick too.
We don’t eat them. They’re the ones who eat them. Rotten people
eat rotten meat.
If one of their cows or sheep or goats dies, they eat it instead of
throwing it out. They eat everything.
The Djibli boy, as well as the Riffian boy, is an object of this kind
of scorn, but the scorn is not expressed in the same way or with the same
gestures. In general the Djibli is considered an oaf. ‘The treacherous
Riffian and the gullible Djibli.’ I had heard people say it.
Next to our house there is a small orchard. The big pear tree attracts
me to it every day. Early one morning the owner of the orchard caught me
poking a long pole into the tree and shaking the biggest and ripest pears
from the branches. He drags me along the ground and I struggle to get
free. At the moment I gave up hope, I felt the urine begin to run out of me
into my wide Arab trousers. I was crying, even though he was not hitting
me.
His wife had a bright smile.
This is the flea that’s been ruining our pear tree! he cried. He’s like
a rat. He spoils more than he eats.
Where’s your mother, my son? The woman’s voice was sweet, and
it soothed my fear.
She went to sell vegetables in the market, I sobbed.
Stop crying. And your father?
He’s in jail.
In jail! Poor man. Why did they put him in jail?
The question bothered me. She repeated it, caressing my cheek. Tell
me. Why is your father in jail?
I felt that a truthful reply would reflect upon the family name. I don’t
know why, I said. My mother knows.

A conversation followed between the man and his wife. Then their
daughter appeared, barefoot, her head enveloped in a cloth, and her long
fingers dripping with water. They were discussing the possibility of
locking me up until my mother got back. I can see that the two women
feel sorry for me. But the man, half in jest, half in earnest, wants me
punished. He made me go into a dark room piled with old furniture. And
don’t cry, you hear? he said as he shut the door. Or I’ll take this cane to
you.
It was the first time I had been shut into a room. I realized that not
only those of my own family, but other people as well, had power over
me. And then I understood that the big sweet pears belonged to the
people who had imprisoned me. Why did we come all the way from the
Rif when others stayed behind in their own country? Why does my father
go to prison, and my mother go to sell vegetables, leaving me alone and
with nothing to eat, when this man stays at home with his wife? Why
can’t we have what other people have?
Through a hole in the door I watched the girl as she gave the floor a
vigorous scrubbing. She was still barefoot; her flimsy skirts were pulled
up, revealing her thighs. As she bends over, I see her small breasts
shaking back and forth. They appear and disappear inside the low-necked
garment. As they tipped forward, the breasts moved like two bunches of
grapes. The white cloth around her head, stained with henna, was like the
outer leaves of a cabbage. I rapped on the door, softly, for I was afraid. I
watched her, timing my heart to her movements. She turned towards the
door, still bent over, still scrubbing. I imagined myself calling to her:
Come and open this door! And I continued to call silently. Decide to
come.
She dropped the rag on the floor and stood up, shaking her hands.
She put her hands on her hips and bent backwards, and a faint grimace of
pain flickered over her face. Here she is, coming towards the door. My
heart beat faster and I began to tremble. She opened the door. What do
you want? Her voice was friendly.
If my mother comes home and doesn’t find me there, she’s going to
hit me, I began.

She pulled her clothing down to cover her fleshy legs. For a moment
she gazed at me with compassion. I looked back at her humbly. She
buttoned up the neck of her garment and stood erect. I see the two dark
grapelike points of her breasts through the gauzy white cloth.
Are you going to knock the pears off our tree again with your pole?
No. You can kill me yourself if you find me doing it again.
She smiled. I did not dare to smile. She forgave me. Quickly I ran
out. Behind me I heard her voice: Come here! Are you hungry?
I hesitated, torn between two desires. Then I said: No.
She understood the cause of my trembling, and insisted that I wait a
moment. Her parents were not in the house. I looked at the pear tree,
loving it and hating it. I was thinking that from then on I was not going to
have any more of those sweet pears.
She handed me a piece of bread that dripped with honey. Here. If
you’re hungry come back to our house. Haven’t you got any shoes?
No. My mother told me she was going to buy me some.
She continued to look at me, smiling at me from where she stood.
Before I had run out of sight I saw her wave to me. I smiled and waved
back.
Men are harder than women, I thought. I wished that the girl were
my sister, and that the house and the orchard were ours. It also occurred
to me that the man was not as bad as my father.
He follows us wherever we go. He whispers words into her ear, but
I cannot hear what they are. She walks ahead, leaving him behind. We
cross to the opposite pavement, she holding my hand. Sometimes she
pulls me along roughly. I see him, still following us doggedly. He is
laughing. She is angry. I am unhappy.
What does that man want? I asked her.
Shut up!
I look back at him and see him smiling. He goes on following us.
What does this man want of my mother? Does he want to kidnap her? A
kidnapper! No, he’s probably a thief. He looks bad.
I held her hand tightly. Why are you squeezing my hand so hard? she
demanded. I’m not going to run away from you.

Go away! I shouted at him, furious. Allah inaalik!
He’s smiling. He smiles at my mother and me, and I stare angrily
into his face. I told you to shut up, she said.
In my head I grew angry with her too. I try to take care of her and
she tells me to shut up.
She stopped to chat with a woman she knew. I saw the man going
along, farther and farther away from us. The woman patted my head and
ran her rough hand over my face. I let go of my mother’s hand so she
would be free to talk, and wrapped my arms around her legs.
Why is your Mohamed so unhappy? the woman asked my mother.
My mother looked down at me and cupped the back of my neck in
her hand. The gesture made me feel better.
He’s always like this. He’s a strange boy.
They said goodbye to one another. Kiss Lalla el Ouiza’s hand, my
mother told me.
Obediently I kissed the hard hand she held out.
I noticed that my mother’s belly had begun to swell. Some days she
does not go to the market. She stays at home, and she vomits now and
then. She is pale and her legs are swollen. She sobs. Her belly swells
and swells. I began to wonder if it would burst. I no longer noticed her
sobs. Each day I am growing harder and gloomier. Hard, hard. Sad. I
have forgotten how to play.
One night, half asleep, I was carried to another house, where I fell
asleep again in the midst of three other children. In the morning, the
neighbour woman, whose husband had been killed in an accident at work
a few days earlier, came to me and said: Your mother has a baby girl.
Now you have a sister.
Once a week my mother goes to see my father in the jail. Sometimes
she comes back weeping. I began to understand that women cry more than
men. They start and stop easily, like children. Sometimes they are upset
when you think they are going to be pleased. And they laugh when you
think they are going to be angry. And often it’s hard to tell whether they
are sad or happy. When are they going to laugh and when are they going
to cry?

I stay at home to take care of my sister Khemou. I know how to
amuse her, but not how to make her stop crying. It bothers me finally, and
I go outside. I leave her there crying, paddling her crooked arms and
legs, like a tortoise on its back. When I go in the next time I find her
asleep, or merely smiling. Usually asleep, while the flies buzz around her
face, already irritated by mosquito bites. At night the mosquitoes and in
the daytime the flies.
My sister grows. Now my mother does not cry so much. She has
fewer complaints. I am becoming meaner, sometimes with my mother and
sometimes with the boys in the street. When I feel myself overcome,
either by her or by them, I break things, or throw myself down screaming
insults and hitting myself.
She began to take me and Khemou to market with her. Khemou
drinks at my mother’s breast. I usually look for my food far from either of
them. Sometimes I beg and sometimes I steal.
For the first time I dared say to her: If you don’t let me do what I
want, some day I’ll go away from this house, and never come back.
Aha, the beetle talking! If you’re like that already, what will you be
like later?
One morning as we walked through the Zoco de Fuera, my father
bore down on us. He was on his way to find us, and he was with a
woman who was going to show him where we lived now. My mother
began to cry, there in the market. Why is she crying about him? I
wondered. He’s like a wild animal, and he’s always in a bad temper.
That night I fell asleep as they argued and wrangled. In the morning
my mother did not go to the market. Instead she went to the hammam.
Later I found her making up her face. She looked very happy. Then when
my father went out I saw her crying again. I did not know any woman
could cry so much. I decided to ask her what was the matter. She told me
that my father had gone out to look for the soldier who had denounced
him, and now they were going to kill each other.
I hoped he would find the soldier so that we could go on living in
the house without him. One of them would kill the other, and that was all
I wanted. I like it when he’s absent, and hate it when he’s in the house.

In the afternoon he came back dejected, giving off a smell of wine. I
heard my mother say: You’ve been drinking, haven’t you?
He mumbled a few words and sat down exhausted. He is sad
because he has not found his enemy, and I am sad because he has come
back.
I heard them talking about a trip to Tetuan. They were still
discussing it when I went to sleep. I woke in the night with a full bladder.
The sound of kisses, like the clapping of hands. Hard breathing, tender
murmurs. They like each other. I hate their love. Flesh clapping. Pfou!
She tells lies. I’ll never believe her again.
No. Not like that.
What are they doing?
Like this.
No! No! It hurts. Like this. Like this. That’s better. No, no! Like this
Yes, that’s right.
Breathing, kisses, groans, breathing, kisses, groans. They are biting
each other. They are devouring one another, licking each other’s blood.
Mmmmm!
He’s stabbed her.
A long soft moan.
He’s killed her.
I feel my bladder emptying itself. The warm liquid running between
my thighs feels good.
The day before we left for Tetuan I saw the girl who had given me
the bread and honey. I told her about the trip we were going to make. She
took me home to her house with her. There I ate brown bread with butter
and honey. And she gave me a large apple, and filled my pockets with
almonds. She washed my face and hands. Then she combed my hair for
me and cut it, rubbing her fingers over my cheek as she did so, and put
eau de cologne on me. She brought out a small mirror and told me to look
into it. I obeyed, but I looked more intently at her than at myself.
She took my head between her hands, the way I would have taken a
small bird so as not to injure it. First she rubs my cheek tenderly and then
she tickles it with her fingertips. When she said goodbye she kissed me

on the cheek and then on the lips. She was a sister to whom my mother
had not given birth.
The day we left for Tetuan, I remembered Abdelqader’s grave. No
one would put water on it, or sprigs of myrtle, and there were still no
tiles around it. His grave will be invisible among all the others. It will
get lost, the way little things always disappear among the big ones.

We had found a house by an orchard in the quarter of Aïn Khabbès.
My mother went back to selling vegetables in the street. This suited my
father, who liked nothing better than to sit in the garden of the Feddane,
deep in conversation with the wounded veterans of the Spanish Civil
War. I ran errands for our Spanish neighbours. My sister rolled on the
floor and tried to learn to walk. Soon my father found me work in a
nearby café. My day lasted from six in the morning until after midnight.
Each month my father went and collected the thirty pesetas I had earned
with my work. He did not give me any of it. He was using me, and I hated
him for it, as I hated everyone who used others in this way. My father
uses my mother and me. The man who runs the café uses me, too, since he
makes me work longer than I should. But what can I do?
I can steal. I can steal from anybody who uses me.
I began to think of stealing as a way of regaining that which had
been taken from me. The café had two separate clienteles, the daytime
one and the night-time one, but on holidays they mingled. Then those of
the daytime learned what went on at night, and those of the night-time
asked for news of the daytime. I smoked in secret. The first time I ate a
piece of majoun I fainted. Later I vomited what looked like moss. I went
on being sick for several days, and life looked strangely different during
that time. Illness makes one more alone. I understood that I was only I
face to face with myself.
The men in the café encouraged me to smoke kif and eat majoun.
Daytimes it was kif and work, but at night it was majoun and fun. One of
them said: It’s only the first time you take it that you throw up. He was
right. I never felt sick again. Then when I drank wine for the first time,
and was immediately ill, they told me the same thing about wine. The
smokers and drinkers are always right. I had no trouble the second time I
tried wine. The café owner saw nothing strange about a twelve-year-old
boy who got drunk and smoked kif. He too drank and took hashish. I
knew that what interested him was making money.
Some nights I slept on a bench in the café. Other times it was at the

Spanish bakery nearby. One night I watched the workers amuse
themselves. Five or six of them took hold of Yazidi the baker and got him
to the floor. They gagged him with a handkerchief so he could not bite
them. Then one of them let down his trousers and, squatting over Yazidi,
began to rub his buttocks, his scrotum and his sex against Yazidi’s nose.
Since I was afraid they might do the same thing to me, I decided to get out
of the bakery quickly. The dangers of the streets on the way home were
preferable, even though the distance seemed great at night when it was
dark, and I was frightened.
The café owner lived in a house that was built against the café.
Sometimes he would start to get drunk there, and go on to finish his spree
at a brothel in Tetuan where he would stay until the next day, or even two
or three days if he went to a brothel in another town. During this time his
absence made it possible for me to indulge my taste for thievery.
I got into the habit of going into his house whenever I felt like it, and
eating at table with his sons. When I was drunk, I slept at the café,
otherwise I slept in the same room with them. I saw that the man beat his
wife and children the same way as my father did. Even so, he was less
bestial. Several times I saw him kiss his sons, and he held long, calm
conversations with his wife. My father could speak only in shouts and
slaps. Sometimes I did not go home to see my parents for more than a
week. This way I escaped from the discord and wrangling.
I grew very thin and sickly. I saw that my mother’s belly was
swelling again, and I thought to myself: This time I’m not going to stay at
home to take care of the baby that’s going to come out. The belly grows,
the time of screaming comes nearer. One day there it will be. Ouaaaaah! I
stopped working. During the days while I was getting well, I spent my
time catching birds in the orchard. I made a swing out of a heavy rope
and hung it from a tree. Surprise! The swing gives me a delicious
sensation. My sex stands up all by itself when I climb onto the swing. In
the orchard there was a big tank full of water, and there I learned to
swim. Early in the morning I would go out and look for things to steal:
fruit, eggs, or hens. Whatever I found I sold to the baqal in our quarter.
Each day the sight of certain living creatures produced great excitement

in me: hens, goats, dogs and calves. Many hens died as a result of my
experiments. I would have to muzzle a dog, or tie up a calf, but there was
no need to take such precautions with a goat or a hen, and these were
more satisfactory. I began to have pains in my chest, and mentioned them.
They told me: You’re growing up, that’s all. I have a disturbing sensation
in my nipples and in my sex, and when I squeeze the milk out of my sex, I
feel as if I were being torn to pieces inside my body.
One morning I climbed a fig tree, and through its branches I saw
Asiya, the daughter of the man who owned the orchard. She was coming
along slowly towards the tank. Bad luck, I thought. She’s going to see me
up here, and tell that father of hers. He’s like my father; he never smiles.
She looked this way and that, stopped walking, and listened to the sounds
around her. Then she continued hesitantly, looking in every direction as
she went, taking her steps with great care. She untied the sash of her
pyjamas and pulled off the jacket like a bird getting ready to fly. The
whiteness of her skin burst forth. Again she turns and looks around. She
is not in a hurry. She seems to be listening for something. I am overcome
by anxiety. One fig falls out of my hand, and the one in my mouth
suddenly goes down my throat. The basket leans to one side, and half the
figs fall out. The sun has already appeared. The circle of red on the
shining white mist of the sky was like an egg that had been broken onto a
blue plate. The animals and birds and insects have begun their morning
praise of Allah. When a donkey brays, its sound drowns out the
songbirds, doves and roosters. She is undressing. Asiya, she is taking
everything off. Her pyjamas slide down like a curtain falling. She’s all
undressed. Asiya, she’s naked. Asiya’s naked. How bright she is! Full
breasts, their points protruding. Below, black hairs outline a triangle. My
trousers are too tight. They hurt in front. She takes two slow steps
towards the tank. My discomfort in front grows worse and worse. Her
long hair covers her from behind. She stoops over, and I am afraid she
may break in two. Now her hair falls forward over her shoulders and no
longer hides her back. Below the point where her white flesh divides
there is a slight darkness. My mouth tastes as though I had been eating
honey, and every part of me itches. My nipples ache and my trousers hurt.

A sweet seizure, a feeling of release, and then delicious relaxation. I’m
going to fall out of the tree. I almost fell. She still hesitates, then she steps
into the water. The stone steps are slippery. I am afraid she may fall. I
worry. She looks at the water and all around at the orchard. She scoops
up water to her armpits and lets it run down. She lets it run over her
breasts, and splashes a little between her thighs. Then she pours it over
her head and jumps in.
I climb down from the tree and creep along the ground until I reach
the pyjamas, which I seize and quickly hide among the bushes. Then I
crawl again to the tree and climb back up, waiting and grinning. I devour
the figs greedily, delighted with my game. She swims beautifully. The
way she plunges beneath the surface and bobs up again reminds me of a
wild duck. I had heard about the swimming prowess of mermaids, and it
seemed to me that she was like one of them. She is on her belly, her back,
now on one side, now the other. She pushes to the bottom of the pool, and
comes up dancing like an empty bottle on top of the water. What a delight
it is that she should not know I am here, that she should imagine herself
completely alone!
She climbs out shivering, stares in astonishment, and begins to
search wildly for her pyjamas, darting this way and that distractedly.
When she sights them, she puts them on and dashes through the orchard. I
am left laughing in the tree, but once again a donkey covers all sounds
with his braying.
In the night I dreamed of Asiya, still unfastening her belt, still
floating naked and darting like an eel along the bottom of the tank. I was
swimming along with her, above her, below her and on both sides of her.
We stood upright in the water for a moment, kissed and sank.
A little girl named Mounat pulled up her dress, crouched, and made
water. She did not know I was watching. I wondered why her pink thing
had no hairs around it. It was not pretty when she squatted down: it was
as ugly as a toothless old mouth. And I saw our neighbour Saida changing
her clothes. Her belly sticks out, not something you would want to touch.
Her breasts are flabby. So much hanging flesh disgusts me. Things
became clearer. I begin to make comparisons between beautiful things

and ugly ones. It seemed to me that unless women had bodies like
Asiya’s, they were ugly.
I am bothered every day by my sex. I scratch it slowly with my
fingers as if it were a pimple not yet ready to burst. Then it fills and
grows hard, until it is sweating and panting. Unless I reach pleasure
during my reverie, I feel pain like two stones. I conjure up the picture of
Asiya’s body. Never have I seen anything so lovely and desirable. I kiss
her, suck her breasts, and she caresses me with her hands and her lips. I
imagine her, I keep imagining her, I maintain her picture in the dream by
an effort of will, until the liquid is forced out and I disappear into
delight.
When I told Asiya that it was I who had hidden her pyjamas, she
chased me. I can jump over things that she has to go around. I turned to
look. She had almost caught up with me. I stumbled and fell, and she fell
on top of me. I tried to get up, but she had hold of me. Again we rolled on
the ground. Then she stopped the game, looking suddenly ashamed. I
thought: I too am going to be stronger than a woman.
I use up a great many boxes of matches pursuing my newest pastime.
I sit on the edge of the tank and wait for the eels to come out of the
crevices at the bottom of the tank. I twist five or six wax matches
together, light them, and throw them at the moving eels. Still tossing
matches, I follow their frantic course until they wriggle back into their
holes. The sight of the small flames falling in the air together with the
undulating movements of the eels, these things calm my resentment and
anxiety.
I sat there now as usual, tossing bunches of matches into the water.
One bunch fell out of my hand before I was able to throw it. I made
another bunch and lighted it, without looking to see what had become of
the first, which had landed on the ground. Next I heard the sound of canes
crackling. I tried to put the fire out by throwing rocks at it, but it only
blazed higher. Then I ran and hid in the stable. I heard voices crying for
water, and burrowed deeper into the hay, pondering my bad luck. When
night came, I crept into the stall where the cows slept. I made one of them
stand up, and I patted her head and smoothed her hide. Then I rubbed her

udder, and she let me suck on it. After three days of fear and
watchfulness in the lanes and alleys of the quarter, and three nights of
milk-sucking in the security of the stable, I fell into the trap my father had
set for me. The neighbours had to break the bolt on our front door in
order to deliver me and my mother from the blows of his military belt.
My body was covered with bleeding welts, and one of her eyes was
swollen shut. It was many nights before I could find a comfortable
position to sleep in. I longed to be able to sleep in the air. My wounds
hurt, my bones ache, and I can feel the fever burning in my head.
I went back to get drunk and smoke kif in the café. There I saw
Fatima, the café owner’s daughter, bending over as she did the washing,
with her clothing hitched up under her sash in front. She seemed older
now, and bigger and stronger than I, and I looked at her with longing. My
father’s rough treatment of me always served only to increase the rage of
my desire. The girl turned towards me with a smile. I looked at her, and
in my mind’s eye I see a gust of wind arrive, and lift her filmy garments.
Asiya is prettier than she is. But Fatima is in front of me. She stood up
straight and stretched. Then she put her arm behind her back, wincing a
bit. I was staring wistfully at her full bare thighs. Quickly she let her
skirts fall to cover her knees.
I imagined myself going over to her and slapping her in the face.
Then I would pull the skirt up again, and she would yank it down angrily.
I would hit her again and lift it up. She would scream with rage, and I
would set her clothes on fire. The flames as they burned her underwear
delighted me.
Suddenly she demanded: What is it?
Disappointed, I said: There’s no more sugar in the café.
She looked at me piercingly. Don’t you know where we keep the
sugar?
I glared at her.
What’s the matter with you today? she said, staring at me. I did not
reply, and she added: You’re strange today.
I went into the storeroom with my head bent over, and came out with
the sugar. She was still studying me with concern.

I began to invent reasons for going into the house when she was
there alone. Using the fire of my imagination I found that I was able to
undress her whenever I liked. She grew used to my unnecessary arrivals,
and I to her feigned indifference. We hypnotized one another, each
looking into the other’s eyes. At this point we spoke very little. Our
mutual understanding grew, intensified.
One cold night I found my body warming itself beside hers, and she
said nothing. We warmed one another and slid on top of each other, face
over face, face under face. I slap her cheek to hear the sound it makes. I
bite her so her blood will run out. I pretend to stab her, in order to hear
the groan I had heard my mother make. And for the first time I understood
that girls had something wonderful and delicious, and that, whatever it
was, I needed it.
My mother gave birth to a baby. Little sister Khemou was growing
big enough to take care of little brother Achor. One evening at the café I
was smoking kif and getting drunk on wine, sitting outside the door in the
fresh air. When my eyes were open I saw the stars in the sky, and when
they were shut I saw the stars in my head. The café keeper noticed me
sitting there, and said with annoyance: Serve that man a glass of water.
I looked at him dreamily, and in my mind cursed him. The son of a
whore! The stars in my head went out. I said: And you? What are you
doing here? Give it to him yourself.
He slapped my face. Then he spat at me. I began to laugh without
control. One of the kif-smokers cried: Can’t you see he’s kiffed and
drunk?
That was my last night at the café. I went off into the dark with the
night birds whistling in my head, feeling both light and heavy. Walking on
the earth was like flying. I was not afraid of the cane-brakes along the
road, or of the horrors that might be behind them. In order to feel even
drunker I began to sing:
Ya Tetuan, ma ahlak
Tol omri ma ninsak
Tol hayatia ahouak.
I came across a cat, or maybe a rabbit, as I ran in the darkness

through the narrow lanes. It could have been a djinn pretending to be a
cat for all I cared.
About a week after the Aid el Kebir I went with my mother to the
stream that ran at the bottom of the orchard. She wanted to wash the hide
of the sheep we had sacrificed. Later, when we were at home that night,
she exclaimed: Allah! I left the knife down there on the rock. The one I
was scraping the sheepskin with.
I said nothing, but ran out through the orchard to the stream. I found
the knife, and seized it as if I were going to throw it at an adversary, at
the same time glancing across to the other bank of the stream. And I saw
a djinn advancing towards the water. Like everyone else, I knew that if
you see a djinn, you must pierce the earth with a steel blade where you
stand. With a violent gesture, I threw the knife downward. I tried to run,
but my knees failed me. I fell and got up again. I could neither cry out nor
turn my head. It seemed to me that if I turned and looked, I would see the
monster beside me. I kept slipping and falling and getting up again, until I
reached the house, my heart in my throat. As a result I fell ill, got worse,
and actually came near to dying. An old man visited the house, a
specialist in exorcizing evil spirits from human bodies. The old man
accomplished a miracle. He told my mother to sacrifice a black rooster
and to carry me seven times around the well in the courtyard. In this way
I began after a few days to return to my normal self. When I was well
again I told my friends what had happened. All of them believed me
implicitly. Both the older and the younger ones knew all about djenoun.
In those days one thing could all too easily turn into another. Whatever
djinn might appear, or whatever mere hallucination suggest itself to them,
they understood that it came from Allah in direct accordance with their
own personal merit or lack of it.
My father now found me a new job in a brick factory, where I
earned twenty-five pesetas a week, pushing a wheel-barrow full of clay
or bricks back and forth for eight or nine hours a day. At first my hands
were covered with blisters. Later the blisters turned into callouses. My
face became hard and my body strong.
I left the brick factory and went to work at a pottery kiln. It was the

same sort of work, pushing a wheelbarrow, and the work day was just as
long, although this time it was I who collected my wages. I gave half to
my father in return for my food, lodging and laundry. But I was tired of
wheelbarrows. I’m not a donkey, I told my mother when my father could
not hear us. Anybody who goes on all his life hauling loads up and down
must be a donkey.
And what are you going to do?
I know what I’m going to do, I said.
At lunchtime my father told me: Food costs money in this house.
Unless you work, you’ve got no food or bed here. You understand?
I bowed my head and said: Yes. But inside I said: And you? What
do you do? Isn’t it my mother who does the work?
I left the kiln and bought the things I needed in order to be a
bootblack. I frequented cafés and bars, stood outside doorways, and
gathered cigarette butts. I drank the dregs from the wine glasses and ate
the tapas that were left over on the little plates. The men complained that
I gave them a bad shoeshine. It was clear that I had not mastered the craft.
Usually the brush fell to the pavement when I changed hands. And the
hostility of the other bootblacks bothered me. I became friendly with a
newsboy who was about my age. Then I stopped shining shoes and, like
him, began to hawk the daily paper El Diario de Africa.

3 
We moved to the quarter called Trancats, and I began to help my
mother sell her vegetables and fruit. My work consisted of shouting in a
strident voice at the passers-by:
¡Vamos a tirar la casa por la ventana!
¡Quien llega tarde no come carne!
¡De balde! ¡De balde vendo hoy!
Each afternoon I managed secretly to put aside some money with
which to buy majoun and kif. Occasionally I had enough to go to the
cinema. One day my friend Tafersiti and I decided to visit a brothel. We
drank half a bottle of mahia sitting on a wall by the barracks above the
Medina.
Lalla Harouda, considered by the boys to be the best whore from
whom to learn about sex, came up to us. You’ve had a lot to drink,
haven’t you? she said. Tafersiti looked at me. I explained that we were
only a little happy. She examined us, an amused expression on her face,
and we both were afraid she was not going to let us in.
Well, who’s going to go first? she said. I looked at Tafersiti. You go
in, he told me.
She wanted the money in advance. I gave it to her without hesitation;
it seemed natural that she should have asked for it.
She is selling and I am buying.
She began to take off her clothes, a cigarette hanging from her fleshy
lips. The smoke curled upward and made her squint. She turned to me.
Open your mouth, she said. She smiled and thrust the cigarette between
my lips. Then she turned her back on me, and I unbuttoned her brassiere,
my eyes on the sparse hairs in the furrow between her buttocks. She
faced me, still smiling, the brassiere dangling from her hand, and took the
cigarette from my mouth. I smiled back at her, thinking: She used my lips
as an ashtray.
Smoke, she told me. Don’t you smoke? Nervously I pulled out a
cigarette and lit it. Take off your clothes, she said.
My trousers stood out in front. With agitation I unbuttoned my fly.

My heart was pounding. Still no one had a body as beautiful as Asiya or
Fatima, but with them it had been only a superficial and slippery contact.
This one will let me go into her the way a knife goes into living flesh. I
am going to stab what is between her thighs.
She lay back on the bed like a pair of scissors and opened her
blades. It was shaved. I remembered Mounat as she crouched and
piddled. The legs spread wider now. She seized my sex in her hand.
And suppose it has teeth in it, I thought. I approached her openness
with misgivings, then felt the scissors squeezing my legs. She hugged me
to her.
You don’t even know yet how to get into a woman.
She wet her fingers on her tongue and moved her hand down to the
other mouth. Put it in now.
I hesitated.
What’s the matter? Go on.
I thought: And if it should have teeth?
Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to eat you.
Cautiously I entered her, sinking into her slippery mouth. Sometimes
I lost it and could not find it again.
Ay, ay, ay! Not that way!
I remembered my mother telling my father: Not like that! Like this!
So this is the first time you’ve been with a woman!
I get into her once more. I want her lips and she offers me her cheek.
I manage to get hold of her breasts. She objects, and pulls my hand away.
Ah! Ah! Not like that! That’s my flesh you’re squeezing. You’re too
young to try that sort of thing. This is your first time.
Fatima is prettier than Lalla Harouda, who won’t even let me touch
her breasts. She let me have her lips and her breasts too.
The slippery massage by Lalla Harouda did not last very long.
Come on, she said. You’re through. She pushed me away from her. My
sex was still dripping.
Oh, not like that! she cried. You’re messing up my bed. Wait. Let me
show you.
She spread a handkerchief over her wound. I was thinking of her

buttocks. It’s true, I said to myself. She’s a real professor.
There you are. You’ve slept with your first woman. Isn’t that true?
I’m the first, no?
I nodded my head.
You’ll always remember me, she told me.
I smiled at her, feeling that she liked me. My snake was still
standing. I wanted it to leave its venom inside once again.
Well, what are you waiting for? Wash and put your clothes on.
Hurry. Your friend’s waiting for his turn.
I put my trousers on. They pushed against my sex. It lay down and
then stood up again.
How was it? said Tafersiti.
Wonderful! No teeth!
What? She hasn’t any teeth?
I’m not talking about her mouth. Her hole doesn’t bite. You’ll see.
It’s warm and soft.
You there! she shouted from the room. Come on inside.
I was thinking: It’s not good to look at it, but it feels good. It warms
your whole body, and makes you calm and clear-headed. But it’s better
to do it without looking.
Tafersiti and I would go to the brothel three or four times a week to
look for a new woman. Then we would both have her. They all acted
more or less the same way in bed: Come on! Hurry up! We went back to
the ones who would allow us to fondle their breasts and kiss them, and
who would let us take our time.
If they won’t let you do that, I told Tafersiti, you’re only getting half
a piece.
They only let the older ones, he said.
And are we so young?
The women think we are, anyway.
Why don’t we go and look at the Spanish women this afternoon?
Good. We’ll see what it’s like with them.
The first girl we met there would not take us. Uno solamente, she
insisted. Nada de dos.

Only one of us can go, I explained to Tafersiti.
Go in with her, if you want, he told me.
No. We’ll both go, or neither one of us.
She can go take a shit, he said.
She’s young and pretty.
She can still go and take a shit. In her clothes. There are plenty of
others, better than that. You’ll see.
I know.
We spoke to another woman, a little older and calmer than the one
who had refused us. She wasn’t ugly, but the first had been better to look
at. What good is beauty, though, if it has pride with it? I thought.
How does she look to you? I asked Tafersiti.
What’s the difference? She’ll do. The main thing is that she’ll take
us both.
She’s a little fat, I said.
It doesn’t matter. We can use her. Afterwards we’ll look for
something better.
Too much beauty is bad for you, I said.
We tossed a coin to see which one would go first. Tafersiti drew
heads. But he said: It would be better if you went first.
You’re used to it. You always go first.
I went in. ¡Antonio! she called. Trae agua y una toalla.
A handsome boy came to the doorway. Ya voy, he said. His
eyelashes had kohl on them, and his face was covered with pink powder.
He seemed to have breasts, and they stood out. He wore his trousers very
tight.
Give him something, the woman told me. I was confused. I gave him
two pesetas. Then I tried to give the woman her fifteen pesetas.
No, no. Afterwards. Are you going to run away, or what? First we
make love.
She washed my sex with soap and water. She squeezed it and rolled
it. Why is she doing that? I wondered. The Moroccan women don’t wash
it or squeeze it.
I was unable to keep it from growing hard as she worked, and I was

ashamed. She smiled, and I smiled back at her.
¿Eres fuerte, eh? she laughed.
She took off her brassiere and underpants. It was not shaved. I
expected her to wash herself, too, but she lay back on the bed, one leg
across the other, with her hands on her thighs. They all know that the less
they show, the more interesting they are, I thought.
So she did not wash. Perhaps that was because she knew she was
clean. And now, she did not grip me with her scissors, but merely lay
there like a great tuna-fish. I had heard how the Prophet Jonah had been
swallowed by a whale. She folded one leg under the other, and I looked
between them, thinking that this was a strange position for her to take. But
obligingly she let me kiss her lips. They tasted good.
Suddenly she cried: Ay! Ay! Wait! We’ve got some hairs caught in
there. Take it out, and let me move. That wasn’t a good way to lie.
Perhaps this will be better for you.
She changed her position, and I was afraid she was not going to let
me get back in. As far as I was concerned, both positions were good. She
did not mind when I touched her breasts, or when I sucked on her lower
lip. Filling my mouth with one of her breasts gave me a wild desire to
sink my teeth into the flesh. The hairs had caused me some pain as well.
She was in no hurry to finish.
How is she? Tafersiti asked when I came out.
Fine! Wonderful! She lets you have everything. She’s clean, too, and
smells of perfume.
She does?
You’ll see for yourself.
That night I dreamed I was sucking a woman’s breast. The stream of
milk that shot out of it struck me violently in the face.
One day little brother Achor died. His death left me with no feeling
of regret. I had heard him crying and seen him crawling, but I had never
thought of him as another person.
My new pleasures kept me from being submerged by life at home.
Without interest I watched my sister Khemou grow and learn to talk. I
was buried in my own melancholy, intent only upon my own body and the

pleasure it could give me. Each day the world seemed to become a more
complicated place. I slept in the street more often than I slept at home.
My mother lent me some money. Tafersiti and I began to buy fruit
and vegetables from the warehouses and sell them for our own profit in
the street. When grapes came into season, we bought huge quantities of
them and carried them out to sell in the country markets. This did not last
very long, and we spent all we had earned in bars and brothels. When
winter came we regretted our thoughtlessness.
Khemou had begun to go and sit in the street with my mother as she
sold her vegetables, where she could help keep an eye on the small boys
who came to steal. One afternoon Comero, the bully of the quarter,
slapped her. I was smoking kif in a café when a friend came by and told
me.
Comero hit your sister. He was trying to steal a head of cabbage.
Your mother wasn’t there.
I went and found Khemou crying. Some boys I knew came by. He’s
in the Café Bab et Toute! Why don’t you go and beat him up? You can do
it. I know you can. Boras butted him in the face and knocked him out.
Yes! Fight him! We’re all with you. He’ll have nobody on his side.
Who’s as good as you with a razor-blade?
I bought three razor-blades and sent friends to tell Comero I would
be waiting for him outside the walls. We began in the Souq el Berra with
our fists. He was stronger than I was, but I managed to keep out of his
reach. When I saw that he was going to win, I pulled out one of the razor-
blades and began to slash his face and hands and chest. My friends and I
ran off, leaving him yelling and dancing in circles.
My father’s brothers had left the Rif and gone to Oran to live, and he
had been preparing to go and see them. That night, having learned of the
fight, he called in some of the neighbours and got them to help him catch
me. He had been going to make the trip by himself, but now he went and
bought another ticket, and at one in the morning he and I boarded a bus
for Nador. We got down at Ketama for some black coffee. It was the first
time I had walked on snow. The voyage was tiring. We ate dry bread and
hard-boiled eggs, and we crossed the River Moulouya on the shoulders

of the men who always waited there to help those who did not want to
face the police on the bridge. Then we walked on to a place in the road
further ahead, and bought a ride on a truck going past.
We passed a night in Oujda at the house of some friends of my
father’s. I spent the next morning killing the lice that crawled everywhere
in my clothing.

4 
It was night when we arrived in Oran. My father found a man who
spoke Riffian, and he showed us to the house in the New Medina where
my father’s friends lived. There the houses were built into the cliffs like
caves, and dogs ran out at us, barking. One of them tore my trousers. I
was walking ahead of my father while he picked up stones to throw at
them. When they came nearer, he clubbed them with the stick he was
carrying. He swore at the dogs and then he swore at me. Go on ahead,
you coward, damn you!
I stumbled and fell. He pounded me with the stick, and I yelled. As I
continued to walk ahead, he prodded me in the back. The stones under my
feet were pointed, and I was walking through nettles. He hits me and
curses me aloud, and I do the same to him secretly. Without my
imagination I should have exploded.
A man in tattered clothing came out of one of the caves and greeted
us. We went inside. His wife was on the floor praying, dressed in
spotless white.
Presently the woman asked me for news of my mother and my
brothers and sisters who had been born in exile, in Tangier. The only one
she had seen was Abdelqader, and she was sad to hear of his death. I did
not tell her how he had died. The last time I saw you, you were only five
or six years old, she told me. And here it is nine years later.
The following day we met my uncle and my grandmother in Douar
ej Jdid, and then we went to see my aunt in the quarter of Serimine. She
had married a man from Marrakech.
You’ve grown up, my grandmother told me. Soon you’ll be a man.
Then you’ll work and help me to live. Isn’t that right?
Yes. She was thin and sick.
My father left me behind with my aunt, and went on to look for his
brothers in other Algerian cities far from Oran. Three months later a
letter came from him saying that he had gone back to Tetuan, and that it
would be better for me to stay on in Oran.
My aunt got her husband to find me a job, and soon I was working

on the farm of the same French woman in whose stable he worked. I was
in the vineyard from five in the morning to six in the evening. The pause
at midday for eating and resting lasted only an hour, but often we
managed to prolong it another hour more, if nobody came by. My work
consisted in guiding two mules along the ploughed tracks in the earth.
I grew tanned, and the palms of my hand became calloused. The old
farm labourer under whom I worked treated me according to the way he
felt at the moment. Depending on the circumstances he could be kind or
heartless. I learned that his harsh words were only a way of expressing
the frustration he felt at the work he was forced to do. What hurt me in his
behaviour was the fact that he treated me as a peasant.
The country you come from has produced only one man, and that
was Abd el Krim el Khattabi, he would tell me.
I had not yet heard of Abd el Krim, and had no idea who he was.
I continued this backbreaking work for six months. On Sundays I
would go out to catch birds, or walk to the city. One day I tried in vain to
climb a high tree. That leg was tall and smooth. I grew very angry at
being repulsed, and so I went to the shed and filled a can with gasoline. I
doused the tree trunk and lit a match. The flames were beautiful. I said to
the charred tree: Now you’re not so smooth. I can climb you, as high as I
want.
There was no one in sight. The place was hidden from the
farmhouse and its outbuildings. The tree looked like a woman, only it
was without legs, and its branches took the place of a head.
I looked for a smaller tree, and found it, smooth and bright. I
discovered that when I put my arms around it, they met at the back. I cut
the outline of a woman on the trunk, with head and torso, and then I began
the creation. For a full week I was busy cutting out two deep holes for the
breasts, as well as another even deeper one at the meeting of the legs.
And so I made the tree woman. Whenever I wanted to amuse myself I
fastened an orange into each breast-hole, and sucked on them. Sometimes
I substituted apples, so that I could chew pieces out of them. The opening
between the thighs had to be lubricated, and then I was able to transfer
all the images in my memory to the tree woman.

One evening my aunt’s husband told me: Tomorrow you won’t be
going to the vineyard. Madame Segundi, the foreman’s wife, wants to see
you. She may let you work for her in the house. That depends on whether
she likes you.
I was overjoyed. But I was troubled by his final words: If she likes
you.
Madame Segundi was friendly and pleasant. She was also young
and attractive, and the litheness of her body reminded me of Asiya.
Sitting facing her I was humble, even timid. But it was not so in my
fantasies. She would be a marvellous new toy for my dreams; it is best to
change one’s dreams each day. She spoke to me in Spanish, and I tried
desperately to remember the few words I still knew.
Madame Segundi gave me three days in which to prepare myself for
work. I spent them at the circus, the cinema, and the cafés. I carried a
bottle of wine with me wherever I went. At night I would drink it at the
farm in the small hut that stood alongside my uncle’s house. The only one
to witness my nocturnal pleasures was Tigre, the dog.
My pretty mistress taught me how to wash dishes and dry them, and
how to fry eggs and fish. One day I cooked her a Moroccan tajine, and
she was delighted with it. She got into the habit of asking for it each
week. Today we’ll have your Moroccan food. But you’ve got to make it
by yourself.
I enjoyed working for her, and I used her as a dream object
whenever I felt excited. I had begun to miss the whores of Tetuan. Slow
or fast, kissing lips and breasts, or only the cheeks, neck and shoulders, it
did not matter. But in Oran, although I had heard about them, I had no
idea how to find the brothels. Even if I had known where they were, I
could not have gone alone. I should have needed a friend to take me. The
friends I had there in Oran were all very serious-minded. It would have
been unthinkable for me to mention my desires to anyone at the farm.
How could I have brought up the subject, when not one of them ever
smiled? Sometimes I watched Monsieur Segundi kiss his beautiful wife
and lightly run his hands over her body. He did not mind doing it in front
of me. Usually I served them their breakfast in bed, he bare-chested, and

she in her transparent nightgown that showed her nipples, like two
raisins, underneath. Even to think of the space between them filled my
mouth with saliva and made my senses begin to blur.
One day she asked me to wash her husband’s underwear. As I
plunged the garments into the water I thought: What is this? One man
shouldn’t be washing another man’s underwear. Then I said to Monique,
my mistress: No. I’m not going to wash these clothes.
Why not?
These are Monsieur Segundi’s shorts.
And so?
I hung my head and said: A man doesn’t wash another man’s
underwear.
She laughed. And what about women’s underwear?
I hesitated, and then told her: Women’s clothes are different. A man
can wash them for her if she can’t do it herself.
You’re very funny, she said. You’re marvellous! Is that the custom
in Morocco?
I was not certain whether it was a true custom, or only one which I
had just invented. There was no precedent for it in my experience. But I
said: Yes. That’s our custom in Morocco.
It’s very strange, she said.
They laughed together about it, she and her husband. A few days
later it was Monsieur Segundi himself who ordered me to wash his
underpants. I said no. He insisted, and I continued to refuse.
What do you mean, you won’t wash them? he demanded.
That’s what I mean.
Then go home and stay there!
Three days later I was sent back to work by my relatives, who had
the Segundis’ approval. My mistress’s parents came from Sidi bel Abbès
to visit her, and her father talked with me about his Spanish origins. He
pitied me, he said, for not being able to read or write in any language,
and he asked me if they did not teach either Arabic or Spanish in Tetuan.
Yes, I’ve heard they teach both Arabic and Spanish, I said.
They why didn’t you go to school?

Because my father never thought of sending me.
Was it that he didn’t send you, or that you didn’t want to go?
I don’t know, I said. But he didn’t ever take me to any school.
He looked for a moment at my forehead. How did you get that scar?
I was crossing the street and there was a bicycle race going on, I
told him.
I wondered later why some men were so much nicer than my father.
The summer afternoons in Oran are fine and long. The old men play
checkers. The young ones fence with wooden swords. The women are
inside, or talking in their doorways. The children are everywhere,
playing games and fashioning toys out of clay and pieces of wood or
cane.
I went to Sidi bel Abbès with my employers. All the members of
Madame Segundi’s family were good to me, but it was her father who
seemed particularly to like me. I took a walk in the town. It was sad and
sinister, although I liked the main avenue and the cathedral. I heard a lot
of Spanish being spoken in the streets. People passed by me on all sides,
but there was no question of speaking to any of them, nor did they speak
to me. I was among them, but far from them. I came to a street fair. The
circus spectacle began at five, and so I could not see it. I had to be back
at the Segundis’ house before that. I smoked one cigarette after the other,
and drank two glasses of wine in a Spanish bar. Then I went to look at
the circus animals in their cages. I stopped in front of a monkey. There
were some children beside its cage, and they were teasing it. I have no
idea how it happened, but suddenly I felt the monkey’s claws tearing my
face. I yelled and jumped back. The guard came and chased the children
away. Then he looked at my scratches and patted my shoulder, shouting
again at the fleeing children.
I saw something which made me forget the pain in my face for a
moment: a young couple embracing behind the circus tent, all shining in
their satin costumes. Watching their kisses awoke all my senses. I thought
how wonderful circus life must be. And I remembered the orchard at Aïn
Khabbès, Asiya undressing, I sliding on Fatima’s naked body, and the
whores at the brothel in Tetuan who had opened their thighs to me.

When I got back to the house they painted my face with iodine. They
seemed to think the scratches were important. Madame Segundi’s aunt
took care of me, and let me go for a walk in her garden. Spiders’ webs
covered all the plants. Under the dome of the summerhouse I noticed two
dusty wooden benches half eaten away by termites. The sight filled me
with profound melancholy. The garden was lugubrious. Pieces of broken
objects were scattered here and there among the plants. From time to
time in the trees above a bird sang briefly or fluttered its wings. Lime
spattered on my head and shoulders.
We drove back to Oran. The next day the scratches on my face had
turned black. When Sunday came, my employers did not take me with
them when they went for their usual ride. I stayed behind alone in the
house.
I turned on the radio for a moment. Then I shut it off and began to
play the phonograph. I did not understand the words being sung on the
records, but the music and the voices took me off to a world that I saw all
in bluish-green. My mistress Monique knew I liked ‘The Blue Danube’
When she is feeling in unusually good spirits she will say: I’m going to
put on your record.
I took up the photograph album and looked through the family
pictures. There were some snapshots of Monique when she was a little
girl. I spoke to them: Grow up! Grow up right away! As I turned the
pages, she did grow up. I studied the pictures taken at the beach, where
she was coming out of the water, or lying on the sand with her husband,
or alone. There are three colour photographs of her where she is
completely naked. In the first she is standing, leaning forward a little,
with her hands folded below her belly. In the next she is kneeling on a
fur-covered divan, bust erect, arms straight out behind her. I imagined her
asking me: Do you like this pose? And I answered: Beautiful!
Marvellous! In the third picture she is lying back on the couch, her hands
behind her head, one leg slightly turned outward. Come on, said the
picture. You’re mine, I told the silent woman, and I wondered who could
have taken such pictures of her. Her husband, probably. If I had had a
camera that morning long ago, I could have photographed Asiya coming

towards the tank, bathing naked, searching frantically for her pyjamas,
and running away through the orchard in fright.
I went down into the food cellar to celebrate the imaginary nuptials.
First I opened the tap of a barrel and filled a carafe with red wine whose
taste I knew and liked. I put some olives and some Danish Blue cheese
on a plate. Then I ate and drank slowly. Certain images from the time of
Aïn Khabbès activated my memory. From one of the photographs the
lovely Monique was winking at me. I blew some life into it, and she
stretched. She is enjoying herself now with her husband. I got a cake of
hand soap and a glass of warm water from the bathroom. The photograph
set off the thrill of excitement that was necessary for the delicious dream
to commence. I could not have said whether I was imagining the
photograph, or whether it had invented me. The delight in my body
increases. I begin the dragon’s massage. It swells and reddens, and lifts
its head. It sweats and pants, and I taste honey. Colours take over, one
slipping after the other, drowning itself in the other, each changing into
another, without colour, or the colour of all colours. I no longer knew
where I was.
I heard footsteps. Rapidly I closed my fly.
What are you doing here? she demanded.
Tell me. What are you doing down here? And with my photograph
album! What are you doing with that?
She seized the album and started up the stairs. I followed, hanging
my head.
Who gave you permission to take my photograph album? Tell me
that.
She slapped me. The blow brought about the culmination of my
pleasure.
You’re drunk. You’ve been drinking, haven’t you? I forbid you ever
to do such a thing again.
I wandered in a blind rage across the fields. Tigre ran along with
me, sometimes behind, sometimes ahead of me. I suddenly remembered
that I had left the cake of soap and the glass of water in the cellar.
Monique will think: And he uses my soap, too. I felt myself drowning in

shame. Now she’ll know I make love with her by myself.
On my return to the farm I found all the workmen with their families,
standing in a circle around a group of sheep that had been hit by a train.
Some of them had still been alive, and they had had their throats cut
according to holy law. The ones already dead were of no use. That night
the jackals howled and yapped close to the house. They’re eating the
insides now, I thought. If I had been one of those sheep, they’d be ripping
my belly now with their fangs.
Tigre came in, blood bubbling out of him, and began to run in a
circle. Then he runs out and back in, whining the whole time. He is trying
to lick the wounds on his neck. I went to my aunt’s house and woke her.
She put ashes on him and bandaged him. The bites are deep, she said.
Five or six jackals must have attacked him at once.
I tied Tigre up in my cabin for fear he would run out again, and I
watched him die, little by little. He was dead before I went to sleep.
In the morning I put his body into a wheelbarrow and carted it a
long way out into the country, where I buried it beside an olive tree. This
was the first time I had buried a dead body. It gave me a strange feeling. I
began to ask myself: Why did this dog have to die in such a painful way?
And I thought of the sheep that had been mangled by the train. The
shepherd is stupid. Tigre is stupid. If he had known what death was, he
wouldn’t have died like this. But the world is full of stupidity. I am
stupid too.
That day when I buried Tigre, I did not want to go to the main house
and see Madame Segundi. I was still ashamed to face her. If you know
what’s good for you, said my aunt, you’ll go and see your mistress.
You’re supposed to be working.
Monique herself came to see my aunt, and sat down. I began to
translate what one of them said to the other. My aunt knew only Riffian
and Arabic. She used Riffian now, and Monique used Spanish. She was
lovely and full of charm that afternoon. Women are difficult to
understand. When a man is sure he is going to have trouble with a
woman, it often turns out that he is wrong. And when he thinks a woman
has forgiven him, he may be going straight towards the trouble he

originally expected. Salvation and disaster depend upon the way she
happens to feel at the moment. I sensed that Monique did not blame me
for what I had done, but neither could she let it pass unnoticed. And so
she asked me: Are you sick?
No, I’m not sick.
Then why didn’t you come to work today?
I did not answer. Then I said: The jackals killed Tigre last night.
Your uncle told me. Poor dog! He was good and strong. Where did
you bury him?
Under an olive tree.
Your uncle will find another dog. She got up and took my hand. Her
goodwill made me even more ashamed. Allez! Come to the house with
me, she said.
Then she hasn’t told her husband, I thought. Perhaps she was
ashamed to.
I had often dreamed of being able to fly. Likewise I had dreamed of
being in a cave strewn with lengths of silk and rugs, and where the walls
were painted with brilliant designs. I had only to make a gesture, and a
platter would be there, bearing whatever it was that I felt like eating. If I
clapped my hands, a marvellous girl would appear, one who had never
been touched by a man, to dance naked in a fog of incense smoke before
me.
One morning after her husband had gone out, I saw Monique go into
the bathroom with a packet of cotton and a pair of her underpants. In the
garbage pail I had often seen wads of cotton soaked with dark blood. I
wondered where the blood came from.
I walked carefully over to the door and peeked through the keyhole.
She takes off the underwear she has on and sits down on the bidet. She
makes water. Then she washes between her legs. She pats a small towel
into her wound, like the first woman I ever slept with in the brothel in
Tetuan. She seizes a handful of absorbent cotton, pulls out the towel and
examines it, and throws it into the bathtub. Then she puts the cotton into
the wound and pulls on the clean underpants. I wondered if all women
bled like this one, like pretty Monique. If they bleed all the time, it’s

disgusting.
There was a boy who lived nearby, a little younger than I. One day
we took a walk into the country. I told him we were going to catch birds
in the traps we carried with us. The boy was handsome, and delicate as a
girl. He wore shorts that came above his knees. We ate meat and hard-
boiled eggs under the olive trees. Then I persuaded him to smoke a
cigarette and drink a little wine. He coughed when he tried to inhale the
smoke, and after he had drunk from the bottle he shuddered. This is the
first time I’ve smoked or drunk wine, he said, and I told him what they
had told me in Tetuan: You won’t cough or make faces the next time. That
happens only the first time. It was the same way with me.
Do you feel sick? I asked him.
Just a little.
We walked into a field of wheat. To be drunk is relaxing. His
cheeks are pink, his lips bright red. We sat down in the middle of the
wheat, and I lay back. He did likewise. I thought of Tetuan, of a song that
began: I loved a girl in Andalucia. She was young, she was tiny, she
was tanned.
The wine ran through me, and I found myself trembling. My hand
stroked his. He pulled away and sat up, looking at me with an expression
of fear. What do you want? he demanded.
Nothing. What’s the matter? Lie down. I was joking.
I don’t like that sort of joke.
With my eyes I said: I do, with you.
He made as if to rise. I seized his hand. I was still trembling. He
wrenched his hand away and got to his feet. Before he could take his first
step, I wrapped my arms around his legs, so that he fell. I fell partially on
top of him.
I’m going to tell my mother! he cried. And my father too!
First he bites my hand, and then he bites the earth.
That night my aunt scolded me. I was mortified, and denied
everything. I swore I had done nothing to him. Later I saw her kissing the
boy’s mother on the top of her head, begging her pardon. I was ashamed.
Your mother must have suffered when you lived in Tetuan, she told

me. If you go on like this, your whole family will suffer, and so will you.
Behave yourself.
I imagined saying to her: What should I do to behave myself, Aunt?
How?
And I imagined her answering: Don’t do things you know are
wrong.
Then I would have said: But I have to. I like everything that’s
wrong. Those are the best things.
I don’t understand you.
I don’t understand myself.
Madame Segundi began to notice my preoccupied expression and
the slowing down in the tempo of my work. You miss your family in
Tetuan, she said.
I don’t know.
Listen. We’re going to give you a whole month’s vacation. A month
is enough for you to go and visit your family, and get back here.
I agreed to go to Tetuan and return. I saw my grandmother and my
uncle very seldom. Sometimes when they came to the farm to visit my
aunt, I was not there. I felt no particular fondness for them, neither
affection nor dislike.
The only time Oran looked pleasant to me was the day I left. There
is a saying that goes:
Ed dakhel en Oueheran zerbanne,
Ou el harej menha harbanne.
On the way back to Tetuan I tried to decide which was better. Oran
is exile and Tetuan is imprisonment. And since I am happier in Tetuan
than in Oran, that means I prefer jail in my native land to freedom in
exile.
I spent two days in Melilla and one in Nador. I talked about Oran
with people I did not know. One of them said: With everybody trying to
get to Oran, here you are coming away from it!

5 
Once I found myself back in Tetuan, I was sure that I should not be
returning to Oran. My mother had given birth to another girl, but the baby
had died almost at birth. Now her belly was very full again. My father
was still happily unemployed. He spent the greater part of his day in the
Feddane talking to madmen and friends who had been wounded in the
Spanish Civil War. My sister Khemou went on growing, and my mother
already relied upon her help at the vegetable stand. Some friends
arranged a reconciliation between Comero and me. He now had a scar
that ran right along his cheek. At the brothel I found that some of the girls
were gone and new ones had taken their place. Because I enjoyed it, I
formed the habit of sleeping in the alleys along with the other vagabonds.
One morning as I lay asleep in the street a girl woke me up and asked me
if I were not the son of Sida Maimouna. I said I was.
Why don’t you sleep at home, then?
My father threw me out.
The girl was lame. She went and got me a piece of buttered bread
and a glass of coffee. I should have been ashamed to refuse her
generosity. However, I resolved to get up earlier in the future. I was
beginning to distrust people who showed goodwill towards me, whether
they were men or women.
I returned to the bakery where I had so often slept in the past, where
I would roll myself up like a hedgehog, my back pushed against the warm
oven. Whenever I move in the night, or get up to go out and relieve
myself, I find several cats asleep on top of me. Often I enjoyed the sound
of their purring. It reminded me of a motor going in a distant factory. I
loved muted sounds, whether they came from far or near. The songs from
the cafès, heard from far away, were beautifully sad.
Another morning it was a man who woke me up. Aren’t you the son
of Si Haddou?
No, I’m not.
He insisted. Aren’t you his son Mohamed?
No. I’m not his son.

Then what is your name?
Mohamed.
But your father is Si Haddou Allal Choukri. And your mother is
Sida Maimouna.
I told you no.
Who is your father, then?
He’s dead. He died a long time ago.
And what was his name?
I don’t know.
You don’t know the name of your own father?
I did know it, but I’ve forgotten. I was still in my mother’s belly
when he died.
He looked at me a moment, and then said: It looks to me as if there’s
something the matter with your brain.
He held out two pesetas. Here. You must be hungry. Go and buy
yourself some breakfast.
I don’t need anything, I said curtly. I have money.
He seemed mystified. I don’t understand. You have money, and you
sleep here in the corner like a cat. You’re a little crazy.
I was angry. The cat is you, and you’re completely crazy! Suddenly I
howled into his face, like a wolf. Aaaaooou! Then I walked away,
leaving him standing there, saying: Bismillah rahman er rahim! Preserve
me from the young ones of today!
My mother now gave birth to another girl, whom she named Zohra,
after the one who had just died. A rat bit her on the hand one night, and
she died, too.
My father had a habit of stealing up behind me in the street and
seizing my shirt collar. Then with one hand he would twist my arm
behind my back, while with the other he would beat me until the blood
ran. When that happened, I knew the thick military belt was waiting at
home for me. And when his arms and legs were tired from beating and
kicking, he would bite my shoulders and arms, pinch my ears, and buffet
my face with his fists. If he catches me in the street, someone usually
intervenes and sets me free. But he has learned not to do it in the street.

So now, when he grabs me I fall to the pavement and yell as loud as I
can. He will sweep the pavement with me for a moment, kicking me all
the while, until I manage to get out of his grip and go far enough away
from him to be able to curse him.
One morning I sat in a café smoking kif with two pickpockets. We
decided to work together that day in order to spend a night of debauchery
at the brothel. We went to the Plaza Nueva where the crowd was densest.
It was not long before I felt the furious grip of my father’s hand on the
back of my neck. Before I had time to throw myself down, my two
companions had gone at him with their fists and heads. I heard him
shouting for help between groans. As I looked back at him, I saw that he
had both hands over his face, and blood was trickling rapidly between
his fingers.
What was the matter with that son of a bitch? Abdeslam demanded.
Nothing, I said. That was my father.
Your father!
Sebtaoui came up then, exclaiming:
Son of garbage! Son of a whore! What did he want with you?
It was his father.
His father! He turned to me.
Yes, my father. But you should have hit him harder. He’s a pig.
When we got to the end of the alley at El Talaa, I saw a drunk
coming out of a house. It was a cold rainy night.
The rain will cut down the cold, said Abdeslam.
The drunk staggered past us. We heard a thud. He’s very drunk,
Sebtaoui said. Then we saw the man struggling to get up. We went on to
the same doorway he had come out of. A woman appeared, her breath
stinking of alcohol, and showed us into the house. She took Abdeslam’s
head between her hands and kissed him on the lips, slowly and noisily.
What did you bring me today? she began. What have you brought for
your mother?
Anything, he told her. Whatever you want.
Sebtaoui walked into a brightly lit room from which came the sound
of talking and laughter.

Abdeslam introduced me to the drunken woman. Mama, he said, this
is a new friend.
She looked at me between half-shut lids.
He’s going to stay up with us tonight, he went on.
She took my head between her hands gently, and kissed my lips,
making a smacking sound. You’re welcome in our house, she said, still
touching my face, tilting her head back slightly and looking squarely into
my eyes. What does this woman want of me? I wondered. Is she trying to
put a spell on me, perhaps?
Abdeslam watched his mother, smiling. But is she really his
mother? Or is he having fun with me? Perhaps she only brought him up.
Everybody go upstairs, she said.
Sebtaoui and I climbed the stairs to the floor above, leaving
Abdeslam talking to his mother. A small girl came in carrying a tray. She
placed a bottle of cognac on it, and went out. Nothing better than cognac
on a cold night like this, said Sebtaoui.
That’s right, I said.
We had had a delicious dinner. The purse we had finally succeeded
in stealing (thanks to a system whereby Sebtaoui opened the foreign
woman’s handbag, Abdeslam reached in and removed the purse, and I
was left with it) proved to have in it more than three thousand pesetas.
What’s happened to Abdeslam? I said finally.
He’s getting his mother to send out for three girls. A lot of them
don’t whore publicly. They stay home and wait for the madame to get in
touch with them. Some of them are married. Once in a while you’ll even
find a virgin.
How can you sleep with a girl who’s still a virgin?
You can’t. She just comes along with the other girls. When it’s time
to sleep, the madame either sends somebody along with the girl to see
that she gets home, or lets her spend the night with her.
And suppose somebody wants a virgin? I said.
In that case, he pays what it costs.
How much, for instance?
He looked at me. Is that what you want? Do you want to break in a

virgin?
No, I was just wondering.
You’d have to pay at least a thousand or fifteen hundred pesetas.
Doesn’t Abdeslam’s mother have any girls here in the house? I
asked him. I thought I heard some girls talking in that room you went into.
She’s got two professionals here, yes, he said. They’re very pretty,
too. But Abdeslam and I are fed up with them. There are other good ones
who come once in a while. Tonight there’s only one outside girl down
there, and she’s drinking cognac as fast as she can, to kill the pain in her
tooth.
We heard the voices and laughter of girls from below. Here they
are, said Sebtaoui. They’re coming up.
Abdeslam’s mother appeared, wreathed in smiles, and behind her
came three girls wearing caftans. It’s a real wedding, I thought to myself.
The woman poured herself a glass of cognac and went out.
Abdeslam brought in a carton of Virginia cigarettes. With no hesitating
the girls sat down, one beside each of us. That was the first night.
For three days I did not go out into the street. Each morning the girls
walked to the hammam to bathe. They would come back in the afternoon,
clean, perfumed and painted. Sebtaoui and Abdeslam go out together. I
prefer to stay in, asleep, or daydreaming, recalling scenes from Tangier,
Tetuan or Oran. At night, life took on the flavour of eternity. In the three
days I spent only three hundred pesetas. Sometimes Sida Aziza,
Abdeslam’s mother, comes in to see me, to talk and drink and
chainsmoke Virginia cigarettes, or even kif.
The fourth evening neither Abdeslam nor Sebtaoui came back, and
Sida Aziza sent me out to look for them. Two hours later I returned,
having failed to find them, and Sida Aziza sobbed when she saw me.
They’ve been arrested, she declared. I had no idea of how to calm her.
Now and then I murmured: I hope they haven’t caught them.
I thought of the things that could happen to my two companions. Sida
Aziza came and went, back and forth, always carrying a full glass in her
hand, until one in the morning. Sometimes she was sobbing, and
sometimes laughing.

There’s a girl downstairs who’s going to sleep by herself. Do you
want to sleep with her? Don’t give her anything. I’ll fix it up with her
later.
I smiled. She drained her glass at one gulp, and said: You remind
me of my brother Salam who died when he was about your age. He got
hit by a car.
She refilled her glass, walked out of the room, and began to call:
Yasmina! Come up!
I heard the two of them whispering outside the door, and I thought:
She’s arranging it for me. The girl came in, smiling modestly. She wore a
caftan and her perfume was strong.
It’s still very cold out, in spite of all the rain that’s fallen, she said. I
mixed her cognac with limonada. We did not say very much. Her
presence was an antidote to my boredom. I took her hand in mine, and
said with my eyes and my smile:
There are a lot of things I don’t understand. And you, Yasmina?
The same with me. There are many things I don’t understand either,
her eyes seemed to say.

6 
It was the neighbours who forced a truce between my father and me.
I went back to helping my mother run her vegetable stand. But I was
forbidden to go out at night, which was unbearable. Nights were all I
had, since I spent the entire day in the street with my mother.
One morning two secret policemen stood beside the vegetable
stand: a Moroccan and a Spaniard. Come with us, said the Moroccan. I
thought then of Abdeslam and Sebtaoui. Across from our stall Lalla
Kinza sold mint. Her son was there. I asked him to mind the stall for me
until I got back, or until my mother returned from the market.
They took me to the jefatura. Where are Abdeslam and Sebtaoui?
the Moroccan asked me.
I don’t know them.
What do you mean, you don’t know them?
That’s right.
He slapped me twice and seized the front of my clothing with one
hand, twisting it around. Listen! If you don’t tell us the truth, we’re going
to put your face on the back of your head. You understand?
A Spanish policeman put his head out of an office and said: Take
him to Señor Alvarez.
He was looking down when I went in. Then he slowly raised his
head. Aha! So it’s you!
I remembered Aïn Khabbès. In the old days I gave his son Julio all
the birds that had died in my traps, because they were not edible. And his
wife used to send me to the baqal or take me to market with her to help
carry the food back to her house.
Where does your family live now? he asked me.
In Trancats.
Does your mother still sell vegetables?
Yes.
And you. What do you do?
I help her at the stand.
But you also go out with certain pickpockets.

No! I don’t know any thieves.
Don’t you know Abdeslam and Sebtaoui?
Sometimes I see them at the Café Trancats, but I don’t go out with
them.
Have you any idea where they might be?
I don’t know.
How long is it since you saw them?
More than a week.
He looked down briefly at the papers on his desk. Ayayay! he
exclaimed. After a moment, he said: All right. You can go. But be careful
you don’t get caught with thieves some day.
I thanked him and went out. In the street I began to spit out the flecks
of blood that I had been swallowing while I was in the presence of Señor
Alba. (That was the name we used to give him in the old days.) I was
thinking: If there’s anybody in the world I wish would die before his hour
comes, it’s my father. And if there were others, they would surely look
like him. How many times have I killed him in my mind? All that’s
needed is for me really to kill him.
I refused to eat the meal, although it tempted me. I did not want to be
late to the cinema. I had decided to eat chicken and peas in my
imagination that evening. My hand always shakes when I cut a piece of
meat in front of him. He glares at me, so that I eat distractedly, like a
nervous cat. His essence stays with us even when he is not there himself.
None of us had the right to touch anything. His will was necessarily our
choice. Sometimes I ask for my share of the food earlier, so that I can eat
it by myself. But my mother tells me: No. You shouldn’t eat alone. It’s a
bad habit.
My father is closer to Allah than we are, and nearer to the prophets
and saints. Many times I have imagined being able to eat in peace, and all
I wanted. His presence makes me doubt the reality of whatever food is
offered me. My mother tells me: Your father’s not going to eat with us
today. Sit down at the taifor with us and eat.
I don’t want anything.
He is not at home but he is here because I’m afraid of him.

Mohamed! Sit down with us and eat, I tell you!
No! I shout. I’m not going to eat.
Why not?
I’ve already eaten chicken with onions, raisins and almonds.
Where? she demanded.
I tapped my forehead. Here, I told her.
Are you crazy, or what?
I told you, I’m full. You understand?
Don’t let him come in later and find you eating by yourself.
Thus she holds him over my head when she wants her own way. My
glance upwards at her was dictated by my fear. I began to eat without
appetite. My love for her is bound up with my hatred for him. I ceased to
eat. He came in. Now the fear is really with me. An instant ago I was
imagining his existence. But now here he is, as real as the dish of
repulsive tripe on the taifor.
Why aren’t you eating?
I’m full, I told him.
It’s a lie. You’re not full. Not to my way of thinking.
I swear I can’t eat any more.
You’re lying. I know you. You’re the son of this whore here.
I’ve been a whore only with you, she told him. People would know
about it if I’d been a whore.
He hit her in the face.
You always humiliate me like this, she cried defiantly.
He hit her a second time, and bellowed at her and at Khemou: Stop
eating, you two! Then he turned back to me. You’re going to eat it all by
yourself. Just you. He’s going to eat it all, and with no help. By himself!
You’re going to eat it, I tell you. Did you hear me or not?
So that he will not hit me, I say: Yes.
Well, get busy. What are you waiting for?
No! No! cried my mother. You’re going to kill him!
Shut up! What a whore she is! Let him die. After he’s gone, you can
follow him.
She knelt, raising her face to his. He faces her, like a giant looking

down at a midget. The flock is his. He can begin with whichever one he
wants. Her resistance has dissolved into sobs. Khemou is all bent over,
and I can see her trembling.
By himself! Come on! Start! I’ll show you how to eat. From now on
you’re not going to refuse anything that’s offered you. Do you hear?
I looked back at him with tempered revolt on my face.
Don’t look at me that way! He slapped me with all his strength. I
hung my head. With the tip of my tongue I felt along the inside of my
lower lip. There was a painful cut.
You won’t even refuse carrion if it’s given you!
My mouth is slowly filling with liquid, warm, salty, sweet,
delicious. I can feel my stomach swelling. With all my willpower I
forced myself to believe that this was a bet, and that I had to win it.
Chewing was a bloody, salty operation. Each mouthful deepens the
hatred. Why am I always with this man, simply because he happens to be
my father? If I were stronger than he, he would be sitting here in my place
eating. I’d be just as hard and crazy as he is.
I awoke in the Hospital Nacional, breathing slowly. They had
pumped my stomach. I could still feel the cramps.
His voice reminds me of the needle going into the flesh when the
injection is badly given.
Her voice: Asleep.
He’s got to eat with us.
He’s tired. He’s been working very hard with me at the stall.
She puts him off. Which is why I do not hate her as I do him, or wish
for her death as I do for his. When he comes into the house, only he has
the right to exist.
Sometimes I make mistakes. I heard him talking, thought there was
someone with him, went upstairs, and was surprised. I could not go back.
I found him sitting alone, an ominous expression on his face. He frowned
when he saw me. He had been cursing us who were not present, and thus
we were all there around him. He drags back those who are not here, and
pronounces judgement on them. Whatever he pleases. Like Allah.
Where’s your mother?

Buying vegetables. At the wholesale market.
Who’s at the stall?
Khemou.
And you?
Mother didn’t want me to go with her.
And now you’ve come here to eat?
No.
Come on. You thought I’d gone to the Feddane. I know a little about
you, when you come in and go out, you son of a bitch. Tell me. Isn’t that
true? Speak up. I don’t feel like your father. Who knows? Maybe
somebody else was with your mother. You’re nothing like me. More like
her. She spoils you the whole time. You plot together against me. You
defend each other. You never listen to what I tell you. Isn’t it true, what
I’m saying? Speak up, you damned whelp! You hate me so much you
wish I were dead.
I thought to myself: Now you’re beginning to make sense.
You want her all to yourself. She’s the only thing in the world you
care about.
That’s true, I thought. You don’t think I’m going to love a dog like
you!
I can see the love in her eyes, and in yours too. Anybody’d think you
were still sucking her milk.
And you? I thought. I wonder how your mother was with you.
You’ve still got her milk in you. But I’m the one who married her.
She’s your mother, yes. But I’m your father. If there’s anybody you
should listen to, it’s me. Nobody else, just me! Me alone! You obey me,
not her, do you hear?
I hear you perfectly, O Khalifa of Allah on earth, I said without
speaking.
But it’s no good talking to you, he went on. Words don’t mean
anything. Even when I’m in front of you, you don’t believe I’m here. I
want every one of my children to think of me as always in front of him,
whether I’m here or not. Do you hear me, damn you?
I hear, O messenger of Allah!

The only thing you’re good for is to bite your mother’s nipples.
I remained present in front of him as he wanted me to.
Tell me. Just why did you come here now?
Mother told me to come home.
Why?
To clean the room.
You’re all alike, you liars. She doesn’t dare to leave you at the stall
because you steal the money. She doesn’t take you with her to the market
because you eat everything in sight. The vegetable men and the porters
down there have told me all about you. They’ve caught you in the act.
Filling your pockets with fruit and nuts, and insulting them if they say
anything. If only I could find a way to get rid of you once and for all,
damn you!
That’s just how I feel, too, I said silently to the maniac.
I wish I knew why I hate you so much, he went on. Now go out to
the stall. Don’t let the kids steal from Khemou.
I was trembling as I went back down the stairs. I don’t want to be
late to the cinema.
He’s tired. He’s been working very hard with me at the stall. She
puts him off. Which is why I do not hate her as I do him.
I tiptoe carefully up to the roof. He is quiet now because he is filling
his mouth. He eats like an animal. I tie the rope with which I am going to
escape, and look behind me. His ghost is standing there.
Where are you going, damn you? Stay where you are.
Without hesitation I leapt out and caught hold of the thick electric
cables that were strung along the street. I heard him yelling. His hands
reach out into the emptiness to strangle me. I thought to myself: I knew all
along this was going to happen. My intuition didn’t play me false.
You wait, you son of a whore!
Then he was not there. I looked down. It made me a little dizzy.
He’ll go out of the house and try to catch me as I fall, I thought. Then
he’ll grind me to a pulp. He’s very bad tonight.
I breathed deeply, shut my eyes, and let myself drop, landing on top
of a pile of stones and rubbish. As I ran my foot hit something alive and

round.
My head! Who’s that? Grab him! Stop thief! Help!
Everything rolls and slides under my bare feet. I can tell the
difference between melons or watermelons and human heads only when I
hear someone cry out under my feet.
The night-watchman came towards me. Hey, you! Stop! Come here!
The old Spaniard danced about as he shook his club at me. Come here,
boy! Come here, damn you!
I turned to the left, hearing the watchman’s whistle. Someone’s
ghost was running desperately behind me. Five or six figures moved in
the background, gesticulating and pointing. I could hear their faint cries in
the quiet street. I slowed down, but I was afraid one of them might take
another alley, cut me off, and be standing there ahead of me, waiting. And
it might be my accursed father. Again I began to run as fast as I could. I’ll
keep running until I fall, I thought. Until I drop like a balloon that’s had a
pin stuck into it.
In the cinema I lit a cigarette. From time to time I rubbed my
bleeding feet with the tips of my fingers. I imagined my father coming
towards me to seize my neck with his two powerful hands. He has
become the villain in the film. As if I were breaking a feather between
my fingers, I pulled the imaginary trigger. My father dies. The lead is
cooling off in his heart and brain. And the blood runs from him as it runs,
from the villain on the screen. His legs quiver for the last time. I see my
father trembling as my hands tremble when I sit down to eat at his table.
The man is dead now. My father is dead. This is the way I’ve always
wanted to kill him.
From the cinema I walked to the Feddane and sat down on one of
the stone benches. Many of them were occupied by visitors from the
country, now asleep. There were also men from other cities who were
passing through, and people who merely did not want to sleep at home,
like me. Boys, youths and old men were sleeping all over the ground and
on the benches like fish stranded on a beach. Every little while another
arrived and lay down. He would move about for a bit in the spot he had
chosen, getting himself comfortable, and then he would be quiet.

I had seventy-five pesetas on me, and I wanted to hide them. But
where?
I folded the notes tightly and, taking care to see that no one was
watching, buried them in the dirt behind my bench beside a rose-bush.
I slept. My father was chasing me. I felt a hand moving softly in my
pocket, but I did not move. My eyes were half-open. It was a man, much
older than I. I’ll let him look, unless he wants to do more than look. That
would be another story. I changed my position so he could go through all
my pockets. He stopped searching. I waited for him to start again, but he
walked away. I catnapped and had reveries for the rest of the night. One
dream finishes in Tetuan and another begins in Tangier. Still in Tetuan,
but already in Tangier.

7 
Already in Tangier, asleep again in a park. I had arrived that
evening.
I awoke in a fright. The boy was shaking me by the shoulder and
talking to me. Get up! Get up! A raid! The police are coming.
I felt in my back trouser pockets. The sixty pesetas were gone. As
we ran, I said: They stole my money.
How much was it?
Sixty pesetas.
We slowed down. You’re lucky, he said.
We were both panting. What do you mean, lucky?
They didn’t rape you. When there are two or three of them, if they
don’t find anything on you, they rape you.
What’s sixty pesetas? I thought. My arse is worth a lot more than
that.
We were in the neighbourhood of the graveyard at Bou Araqia.
Where are we going?
Follow me and don’t talk. There’s nothing to worry about.
We walked into the world of silence. This was where my little
brother Abdelqader had been buried after my father had killed him. When
my father dies I’ll go to his grave and piss on it. I’ll make his tomb into a
latrine.
We were walking over the graves, and we stopped in front of a
walled-in family mausoleum. The boy leapt over the wall.
Jump. What are you waiting for?
I jumped. In a corner lay a pile of flattened cardboard boxes, and he
began to spread them out on the ground.
Here’s your place, he told me. Then he made his own spot. I sat
down and rested my elbows on my knees. Once he was comfortable, he
said: Where are you from?
The Rif.
So you’re a Riffian, then?
That’s right.

And where are your people?
In Tetuan.
You all live there?
That’s right. We used to live here in Tangier, but then we moved to
Tetuan.
Did you run away?
Yes.
So did I.
Where are you from?
Djebel Habib.
He’s a Djibli, then, I said to myself. Why did you run away?
He began to search in his pockets.
My father’s wife threw me out.
And your mother?
She died. He pulled out two cigarette butts. Before offering me one,
he said: Do you smoke?
Yes.
He handed me one of the butts. I sniffed at it. Virginia tobacco. He
brought out a box of matches and lit it for me. I inhaled a deep breath of
smoke, and let it out. A delicious feeling of peace descended upon me.
Do you know Tetuan well? I asked him.
Not very. I ran away and came here after only about two months.
What does your father do?
He’s a street porter. And yours?
Nothing. He was in the Spanish army and he deserted. They caught
him and gave him two years. He hasn’t worked since he got out of jail.
Who works in your family?
My mother. She sells fruit and vegetables in Trancats.
And you? What did you do?
Sometimes I worked for her at the stall and sometimes I had other
work.
Why did you run away?
Because my father was always beating me up. Sometimes he’d hang
me upside down from the branch of a tree and beat me with his soldier’s

belt. That was when we lived in Aïn Khabbès.
My father beat me every time his wife told him to.
And what do you do here? I asked him.
I’m a street porter. What else do you expect me to do? After a
moment of silence he said: I’m tired. I’m going to sleep.
It was about one in the afternoon when I went down to the port. I felt
very weak. At one of the waterfront cafés I asked for a glass of water.
Nearby was a stand that sold bean soup. Only one peseta, and I could
have a bowl. But where to find the peseta? My life is not worth even one
peseta now. After a few minutes of walking in the strong sun I began to
feel sharp pains in my stomach. This sun will drive me crazy. I picked up
a small fish that lay on the pavement, and smelled it.
The odour was overpowering, unbearable. I peeled off the skin.
Then with disgust, with great disgust, I began to chew it. A taste of
decay, decay. I chew it and chew it but I can’t swallow it. I can’t.
From time to time the small sharp stones hurt the soles of my feet.
They hurt. I went on chewing the fish as if it were a wad of gum. It was
like chewing gum. I spat it out. Its stink was still in my mouth. I looked
down with rage at the mass I had spat out. With rage. I ground it into the
pavement with my bare feet. I stepped on it. I ground it under my feet.
Now I chew on the emptiness in my mouth. I chew and chew. My insides
are growling and bubbling. Growling and bubbling. I feel dizzy. Yellow
water came up and filled my mouth and nostrils. I breathed deeply,
deeply, and my head felt a little clearer. Sweat ran down my face.
Running, running. I thought of the boy who had saved me from the police
last night. Why didn’t he wake me up this morning? Why? Did he try, and
couldn’t because I was sleeping so heavily? Perhaps he tried. I was sorry
we had not given each other our names. I was sorry. The fisherman sat in
his boat, eating his loaf of bread. He eats it, and I, I am eating it too as I
watch. He leans over the gunwale, and I watch him wearily. I watch and
watch, thinking that he may throw something away, something I can eat,
as he is eating. The monkey tied to the mast seizes something, and
nervously cracks it between its teeth. I hoped the fisherman was chewing
without pleasure, the way I had chewed my rotten fish. I watched the loaf

of bread avidly. He was gazing distractedly at the waterfront skyline,
running his eyes vaguely over old Tangier. Throw away your bread now,
the way I threw away my fish, I told him silently. He threw the bread into
the water. A delicious taste of salt filled my mouth. Delicious. A feeling
of pleasure revived my weak body. In spite of being so tired, I felt better.
I stripped off my shirt and trousers, and plunged into the water. I swam
beneath the bread and saw that the slab of meat that had been inside it
had already sunk to the bottom. There goes half my luck, I thought. The
fisherman began to laugh uproariously. I raised my head towards him, my
hand clutching the bread. I looked at him and at the bitten piece of bread.
Lumps of shit floated all around me in the water. Floating, floating. I
squeezed the bread in my hand. It was spongy, and sticky with oil from
the boats. That bear is laughing at me as though I were a big fish he was
going to catch. He’s laughing at me. I’ve swum into his net. Inside. I
began to swim towards the concrete steps, passing other small lumps of
shit and bread bobbing in the water in front of my face, bobbing and
bobbing. I pushed them away as I swam. In my mind they became
connected: bread and shit. Connected. A little water went down my
throat, went down. I choked, choked. There was pain in my head and
chest. I climbed two of the steps. On the third step I slipped and rolled
back down into the water. Again the water ran into my throat. Again. The
idea came to me that I was going to go on for ever, climbing up the steps
only to slip and fall back into the water. On and on. Even as I got to the
highest step, I imagined myself falling backwards into the bay. Falling
again. I was very careful where I placed my feet. My body was covered
with sticky oil. I picked up my shirt and trousers, and started walking. On
my way, I looked behind me and the fisherman waving at me. Laughing.
The sound of the laughing dies away little by little. Dies away. Now he
has stopped laughing. Stopped.
He called after me, wheedling. Hey, boy! Come here! It’s only a
joke. Come on. Here’s another loaf of bread.
Poor kid, said the fisherman in the boat with him.
I did not turn around and go back towards them. The humiliation
was very great. Too great. Ahead of me on the pavement there were some

more small fish that had been trampled on. Trampled underfoot. I raised
my face to the sky. It was more naked than the earth. More naked. The hot
sun struck my face, struck it. I began to tremble with fatigue. I tremble
and shake. I see a cat reclining comfortably in a shady corner. It looks at
me half-asleep, with indifference. Indifferent. Its white and black belly
rises and falls slowly, slowly. I picked up one of the small, dry fish. Dry.
It had a worse stench than the first one. Worse than the first. I began to
vomit yellow water again. That was what I wanted. I wanted it. I vomited
and vomited, until only the sound came out. Only the sound, the tight
sound of retching. That was what I wanted. I walked towards the beach,
feeling empty, weak. Now and then it seemed that I was about to fall and
not get up again. In order not to think about what had happened and what
might be going to happen, I began to look back at the footsteps I was
making in the sand. The waves broke over them shortly after I made them.
I watched my footsteps and the waves. I threw my shirt and trousers
down onto the sand and began to rub my body with seaweed and sand. I
rub and rub. My hair is even stickier than my body. Stickier. I went on
rubbing and rinsing until my skin was red, red. The skin on my body was
still sticky with oil, but not so dirty as before.
In the afternoon, after wandering far and wide, I sat down on some
steps opposite the railway station. I did not manage to carry any suitcases
for the travellers who arrived. I failed. I did not dare approach them. One
of the porters yelled into my face: Get back! Out of here! Go on! This
was a good town until you all landed here like a swarm of locusts!
They swore at me, spat on me, and shoved me away. A muscular
young man gave me a hard kick and chopped me on the back of my neck.
But I was determined to stay there. I stayed there. Later I succeeded in
persuading a European to let me carry his suitcase. It was heavy. As I
was lifting it up to carry it, a big man grabbed me and began to swear at
me. He managed to convince the traveller that he was more capable of
carrying the bag than I was. Violently he yanked the handle out of my
hand. Violently. The situation has not changed at all so far. When I was
seven or eight years old I always dreamt about bread. And here I am at
sixteen still dreaming about it. Am I going to go on dreaming about bread

for ever? The cat on the fishermen’s pier was luckier than I. It can eat
fish out of the gutter without vomiting. Yes, without vomiting. There’s
nothing left but begging or stealing. But it seems to me that a beggar
sixteen years old is not going to collect much. Yes, it is difficult.
Sebtaoui was right: begging is a profession for children and old people.
If a young man can’t find work, it’s more shameful to beg than to steal.
That’s what he used to say. I wonder where they are now, he and
Abdeslam. Who knows?
A young man sat down near me and took out a pack of black
cigarettes. Do you smoke? he said. I turned my head and answered
weakly: Yes.
What’s the matter with you? Are you sick?
No.
He came nearer and I took a cigarette from him. He lighted a match.
Thank you. Not now. Thanks.
He got up, saying: Wait for me. I’ll be back.
I smelled the cigarette. If I smoke it I’ll vomit again without
vomiting anything. The same as at noon. I heard the sound of a plane
flying overhead, and raised my eyes to the sky. The noise slowly grew
fainter, and I did not see the plane. A feeling of sleepiness stole over me.
I heard the young man talking. Here!
The cigarette had fallen from my hand. I must have slept. Yes, I’ve
been asleep.
He was holding out half a loaf of bread stuffed with tinned sardines.
I saw a bottle of wine in his hand. He took a small glass out of his pocket
and filled it. When he had drunk, he refilled it.
Raising the glass to his lips he said: Where are you from?
I answered as I ate. I’m from the Rif. My family lives in Tetuan.
He emptied his glass again and licked his lips contentedly. When
did you come to Tangier?
Yesterday.
And where do you sleep?
In the street.
I was happy eating. I swallowed some mouthfuls without being able

to chew them. He filled the glass and handed it to me. Do you drink?
Yes, I said, and drank it at one gulp.
I began to feel things getter clearer. I smoked the cigarette and had a
second glass. When I had finished the third, he said: Do you want to
sleep at my house?
I looked at him surprised. His expression was not reassuring. He
wanted something of me, and I thought I knew what it was. Yes, his eyes
tell me that’s what he wants.
No. Thank you. Thank you very much.
As you like. He shook a few drops of wine out of the glass and put it
into his pocket. See you again, he said.
Thank you. Goodbye.
I had almost told him that I slept in the graveyard. Luckily I stopped
in time to avoid such stupidity. I walked along the street where the palm
trees grew. The soft breeze revived me, and I saw everything clearly in
my mind. Then I stopped walking. From a car an old man was signalling
to me. What does he want? I went over to the curb and leaned down to
the window. He opened the door and said to me in Spanish: Get in.
I got in and sat beside him. He drove slowly. ¿Adónde vamos? I
asked him. He made a circular motion with his hand. A paseo, he said. A
little paseo.
He wants something different, I thought. But I’m not afraid of him
Just what is it he wants, though?
Are you from Tangier? he asked me.
No. I’m from Tetuan.
We were on the outskirts of town. He’s a maricón. That much is
certain, I thought.
He stopped the car in a dark section of the road. The lights of the
city sparkled in the distance. He turned on the overhead light. So the
short ride ends here. With a caressing movement he runs his hand over
my fly. And the other ride begins. Button by button, very slowly, he
unfastened the trousers, and my sex felt the warmth of his breath. I did not
dare look at his face or even at his hand, whose warm pressure had made
my sex rise up.

¡Bravo! he was saying. ¡Macho bravo!
He began to lick it and touch it with his lips, and at the same time he
tickled my crotch with his fingers. When he pulled half of it down his
throat, I felt his teeth. And if he bites it? I thought. The idea cooled my
enthusiasm. To bring it back, I began to imagine that I was deflowering
Asiya in Tetuan. When I finished, he still had me in his mouth. He took
out his handkerchief and wiped his lips. His face was congested, his eyes
very wide, and his mouth stayed open. I buttoned my fly and folded my
arms over my chest as if nothing had happened. Taking out a pack of
cigarettes, he offered me one and lighted it for me. Then he lit a cigarette
and turned on the radio. A beautiful calm music came over the air. I sat
enjoying it, and was reminded of Oran and my work with the lovely
Monique. Monique! Today it’s only a name, to be remembered or
forgotten.
We did not say a word to one another as we drove back to the city.
He gave me fifty pesetas and let me out near the place where he had
called to me. He shook my hand and said: Hasta la vista. His hand was
warm and smooth. I waved to him. Hasta la vista!
The air was full of smoke from the car.
They suck it for five minutes and they give you fifty pesetas. Do they
all suck, the ones who are like that old man? Are all the maricones as
nice as he was? Do all the ones who suck have cars, and do they all give
fifty pesetas? A new profession, to add to begging and stealing. I must
pick one of the three until a further choice appears. One of the three or all
of them, depending on the circumstances. And why not? I took out the
fifty-peseta note and looked carefully at it. Then I folded it and put it
back into my pocket. I was afraid of losing it. If I had been that old man I
should have vomited. Does he get the same pleasure from sucking me that
I get from sucking a woman’s breast? Does he get excited while he does
it? My sex still felt warm and sticky between my thighs. Suddenly I was
struck by my conscience. What I had done was no different from what any
whore does in the brothel. My upright sex was worth fifty pesetas,
looked at in that light.
I went into a little restaurant in the Zoco de Fuera and asked for a

plate of fried fish and half a loaf of bread. The two men facing me were
masons. On the table stood a one-litre Mobiloil can. The three of us took
turns drinking tepid water from it. Each time I lifted it I smelled the foul
odour it gave off. At the other two tables there were working men, men
out of work, and thieves of various kinds. They all ate in silence. There
were only the sounds of spoons and dishes and kitchenware, and the
voice of the proprietor giving commands to the boy who assisted him.
From time to time one of those who has finished eating emits a loud
belch, followed by a drawn-out exclamation: El hamdoul’ illah! I
handed four pesetas to the proprietor and went out. It had been hot inside
the restaurant. Egyptian and Moroccan music came from the cafés and
restaurants. A young drunk, naked to the waist, stood outside the door of
one café, cursing Allah in a piercing voice. Two other young men came
out of the café, forced him to lean over, and then poured a jar of water
over his head. Then they pushed him back into the café. I noticed that they
too were staggering. I thought again of the boy who had saved me the
night before from the police raid. I wonder if he is asleep in the
graveyard now. If I don’t find him there shall I sleep there alone?
I went into a baqal and bought five Philip Morris cigarettes. I was
approaching the entrance of the cemetery, and it occurred to me that a
graveyard is the only place you can go into at any hour of the day or
night, without having to ask permission. They’re right. Why should they
have a guard here? There’s no money in here. The dead are not afraid.
They don’t get angry or hit anyone. Each dead man is in his place. When
his gravestone crumbles they put another dead one in the same spot.
The cardboard boxes were piled in their place in the corner. Have
they caught him? What has happened to him? I spread out some boxes on
the ground. Perhaps he will come. I lit a cigarette, took three wax
matches and twisted them together to make a torch. Then I held them up to
inspect the writing on the marble plaque. I saw from the numbers there
that the person had lived for fifty-one years. The numbers were all I
could read. He or she, I didn’t know which, was no longer living, and I
was still here. But what does it mean, a man who was alive and now
isn’t? What does it mean, that I should be sleeping here in this corner of a

family grave? From the tiles and the well-kept plot I can see that the
family was a rich one. What does it mean to allow a man sixty or seventy
years old to suck on me and then give me fifty pesetas? There must be
answers to these questions, but I don’t know them yet. The questions
come easily, but I am not sure of the answer to any one of them. I thought
the meaning of life was in living it. I know the flavour of this cigarette
because I’m smoking it, and it is the same with everything. I smoked with
great gusto, and then I threw away the cigarette and went to sleep.
I awoke early. A new boy lay asleep in the place of the other one
who had saved me. Quickly I felt to see if what remained of the fifty
pesetas was still in my pocket. My fortune was there. The boy had been
right when he said there was no safer place than the cemetery. I think the
human race respects its members more when they are dead than when
they are alive.
At Bab el Fahs I bought a pair of rubber-soled alpargatas for
fifteen pesetas. My feet were dirty. I had breakfast in a café and smoked
the first cigarette of the day happily. A new day to live through. What
shall I do during this new day? Will I manage to pick somebody’s pocket
the way Sebtaoui and Abdeslam do in Tetuan? Why not? I must try before
what money I have left gives out.
In the middle of the morning I walked into a market. A European
woman was buying something at a stall. She paid and put her change
purse back into her handbag. Then she caught sight of me, staring fixedly
at the handbag. Her eyes seemed to be saying: Aren’t you ashamed? And
so I felt ashamed, and went out of the market. I spent the whole day
letting the alleys swallow me up and spew me out. In the evening I
discovered that you could sleep in the Fondaq ech Chijra. You paid only
one peseta at the gate in order to get in, and you could sleep where you
liked. There are two levels. The animals sleep below and the people
above. It was nine o’clock when I went in. A café, a restaurant, small
rooms they rented out, shops, fruit and vegetable stands. The Fondaq is
like a city. On the stairway I ran into a drunk. He reached out to touch my
face, saying: Aha, gazelle! Where are you off to, beautiful? I pushed his
hand away violently, ran up two steps and glared at him. He guffawed.

What are you so nervous about? Afraid of me?
In his hand he held an empty bottle. I’m going to fill up this bottle,
he said. I’ll be back.
He went on downstairs, laughing, and I continued up, feeling more
frightened each minute. He called back to me: Wait for me, handsome.
I’ll be right up. I’m not going to let you get away.
There were scores of men on the balcony, some of them already
asleep, but most of them sitting up, drinking, smoking kif, chatting and
singing. I caught sight of a drunk hugging a boy. Then he kissed him on the
cheeks. One of the others cried: Leave him alone! Not now! Later, later.
No. I’m not going to sleep here, I told myself. I’d rather sleep in the
graveyard.
As I started to go back, someone called to me. Hey, beautiful! Come
over here with us and make us happy. I did not turn to look. My heart was
pounding. I must buy a knife or a razor. I ran down the stairs very fast,
stopping only when I got to the animals’ quarters. Luckily human beings
are not the only thing in the world. I walked over to a dark corner and sat
down. Then I smoked a cigarette. Did Allah mean to make the world like
this, with such disorder and confusion? The smell of the beasts was very
strong. A mare stood beside me. I folded my arms on my knees, bent
over, and fell asleep. I slept sitting up because I was afraid of being
raped.
All at once I was being drenched with warm, pungent water. I
jumped up, terrified. What’s that? I cried. The last drops of urine are still
trickling from the mare’s puckering hole. She takes a step backwards.
Quickly I get out of the way, in case she kicks.
At the door the guard asked me if I was coming back.
No! I cried with feeling. I’m not! I’ll never come back!
Why? What’s the matter? Did they do something to you?
Yes. A mare pissed all over me while I was asleep.
What were you doing sleeping down there? Why didn’t you sleep
upstairs on the balcony? Go to a hammam and wash before you go to
sleep, or you’ll be sick.
Keep your advice for yourself, I told him. He slammed the gate after

me.
The air was tepid and the streets were empty. Where to go now? To
the baths? And my clothes? I am soaked through. I began to scratch.
Three drunks sat singing in front of the entrance to the old Jewish
cemetery. As I went past, one of them called to me. Come here! Where
are you going?
I looked over my shoulder and kept walking.
Come on, gazelle! He stood up unsteadily and began to follow me.
One of the others said: Let him go. Come back here.
The street leading up to the Zoco de Fuera seemed to be the best
way out. As I ran I looked back and saw the drunk sitting down again
with the others.
I bought a cake of soap in the Zoco Chico. The square was filled
with drunks, whores, maricones and beggars. In the Calle de la Marina
near the Djamaa el Kbira two Moroccan police stopped me.
Your papers, said the first.
I haven’t got any papers.
Where do you live?
In Tetuan.
Hearing this, the second one demanded: Where in Tetuan?
In Trancats. Behind the Jewish baths.
Do you know Moulay Ali?
He’s a neighbour of ours.
What are you doing here?
Nothing. I came to look for work.
And where are you going now?
I was sleeping in the Fondaq ech Chijra and a mare pissed on me.
A mare!
Yes, a mare. I was asleep downstairs with the animals.
The two men looked at each other, and the second asked me: Do you
know where Dar Debbagh is?
No.
Come with us.
At the corner he pointed out the place, saying: Go in there. You’ll

find a fountain. Wash yourself, and in the morning wash your clothes.
The water at the fountain was warm. After I had bathed, I washed
my trousers and shirt by trampling them underfoot. Now and then from the
nearby café there was the sound of men’s voices as they argued over
their card games. A man staggered out and came over to me.
What are you doing? Are you crazy, washing your clothes at night?
I stopped stamping and explained why I was doing it.
A mare!
Yes. A mare.
Mmmm, he said at length. I see. Well, take a good wash.
When I had finished, there were my wet shirt and trousers on the
ground in front of me. There was no other solution. I wrung them out as
much as I could, and put them back on.
I stopped walking when I came near to the railway station. Shall I
sleep in a freight car or go to the beach? On the sand nobody will ask me
any questions, whereas a guard can come through the freight car. The
main thing is: will I be able to protect myself against someone bigger
than I am?
Again I heard in my head the words of the boy who had taken me to
the graveyard: If they don’t find anything to steal on you they rape you. I
had more than twenty pesetas in my pocket. Will that be enough to protect
me? Maybe the boy was right, but he was talking about what they do in
the middle of the city. On the beach, or in a freight car, though, they could
rob you first and rape you afterwards. They could even cut your throat.
And on the beach who could hear? So it’s the freight car. I climbed the
wall and let myself down. I could feel the sharp points of the gravel
through the soles of my alpargatas, and I worried that they would cut
through. I went along slowly, carefully, until I came to the first freight
car. I climbed into it and lit a match. It was empty.
Suppose someone comes along and attacks me, I thought again. I
jumped down to the ground and picked out the two sharpest stones I
could find. As I climbed back up into the car I heard the soft sound of
cloth ripping. My trousers.
Bad luck! I threw myself down on the floor. One stone was in my

hand and the other lay beside me, near my head. I must buy a knife. Or at
least a razor-blade. And I’ve got to find a friend somewhere in this city.
What has become of the boy who saved me? Is he staying away from the
graveyard on purpose? How long will I have to go on living by myself?
Ought I to go on accepting this life as it comes up each day, or not?

8 
We were in the Café Chato, and I had just lost my last centimo
playing aaita. When we had begun to play, twenty-five pesetas left, and
el Kebdani told me: This isn’t your lucky day. Stop playing.
Don’t worry about me, I told him sharply. I can manage myself and
my money.
Now, a little after noon, el Kebdani had just lent me five pesetas. I
bought three pesetas’ worth of kif and paid two for a glass of green tea.
We were sitting up on the balcony; through the little window I could see
the whole Zoco de Fuera in front of me. It was Sunday. The big square
was crowded with circulating salesmen and buyers, as well as the others
who were walking through without buying anything. The wind had come
up and the sky was dark with clouds. All the Moroccan establishments
were shut — restaurants, cafés and shops. Above each doorway there
was a Moroccan flag, and tacked beside it a black flag. In some cafés the
owners sat playing cards, treating the day as one of leisure. Earlier that
morning I had asked Chato what the holiday meant. It’s a bad day, he
answered in a voice that came half from his mouth and half through his
nose.
And what does a bad day mean?
You don’t know?
No.
I’ll tell you. The thirtieth of March nineteen twelve was the day
when the French began to protect Morocco. That was under Moulay
Hafid. And today’s the thirtieth of March nineteen fifty-two, so it’s forty
years of protection. And that’s why it’s a bad day.
But what do we want the French to do today?
Don’t you know what we want them to do?
No. What?
We want them to get out! The Protectorate was supposed to last
forty years. It expires today.
Do we want the Spanish to get out too?
He looked at me with annoyance. Listen, I haven’t got time to talk

about it now. Go up onto the balcony and ask one of your friends to tell
you all about it.
El Kebdani had won about three hundred pesetas, when he suddenly
announced he was quitting.
Finish the game with us, one of the players said angrily.
Suppose I don’t feel like it? I have to go on playing anyway?
No, but it’s not logical to stop now. You’ve won everything we had.
Finish the game out to the end, since you’re the winner.
I’m hungry, el Kebdani said. I’m going to get some lunch.
We’re all hungry, they told him. Play cards.
If you don’t want to finish the game, divide your winnings.
That’s right. Makes sense. That’s the thing to do, unless you want to
go on with the game.
El Kebdani laughed sarcastically, and took the sebsi I had filled for
him.
I’m warning you. You’d better finish this game.
It looked as if there were going to be trouble. Chato yelled up: I
don’t want noise in my café! Go out into the street if you feel like killing
each other.
When the gamblers had thinned out, Chato had gone back
downstairs. Usually he stayed on the balcony keeping track of the
winnings so he could collect his commission. When he had left, I had
thought to myself: He wants us out of here. The stakes aren’t worthwhile.
Suddenly a furious voice came up from the Zoco de Fuera. People
People! Moroccan patriots! This is a black day. Exactly forty years ago
today, in nineteen twelve, the French signed the treaty of the Protectorate
over Morocco. And we’re still not free.
We all crowded around the window. It’s crazy el Merouani, the one
who sells the pastries in the Zoco Chico, said el Kebdani.
What’s he saying?
What can he say? He’s completely out of his head. He’s just having
some fun with them.
They say he’s an informer for the Spanish.
It wouldn’t surprise me.

You shouldn’t say it unless you’re sure. Where’d you hear that?
I know. He belongs to a secret party run by some Spanish who want
to get rid of the International Zone so they can run Tangier by themselves.
Again Chato yelled from below:
That’s enough up there! I don’t want to hear any politics in this café!
Go out into the Zoco if you feel like talking politics or fighting.
El Merouani went on shouting in his wild voice, shaking his arms
excitedly in the air. Out with colonialism!
Out! Out! shouted the crowd.
Long live free and independent Morocco!
Aache! cried the crowd.
Down with the traitors! screamed el Merouani.
Yasqot!
Holy war, in the name of Allah!
El jihad! El jihad ya ‘ibad Allah!
A Djibliya woman in a straw hat climbed up onto a wooden crate
and began to scream: Youyouyouyouyouyouyou!
We ran downstairs and stood looking out over the barrage of
benches and tables that were stacked in front of the entrance.
In his half-mouth, half-nose voice Chato said: Either go outside or
back upstairs. Out or up!
I leapt over the barricade and stood outside. Are you coming or not?
I called to el Kebdani. He hesitated a moment, and then jumped too.
Come back here! cried one of the players. Don’t listen to fuckface
there.
The fuckface is your mother, I told him.
He spat at me across the barricade, and I spat back at him. Then he
threw a bench out at me. I dodged it, and insulted his mother again.
We’ll see about this later, he said. I’ll show you who’s who. When I
get hold of you I’ll spit up your ass!
I grabbed my groin and shouted: Come and get it!
Kill each other outside, Chato was saying. Go on out, all of you!
El Kebdani pulled me ahead by the arm. Shit on their mothers, I told
him. They want you to stay there. They think maybe they’ll be able to get

some of their money back.
I was born a long time ago, he said. I know what the sons of bitches
want.
They were cheating. Did you notice?
I noticed, yes. But they’re idiots. I could follow everything they
were doing.
El Merouani was beckoning to the excited crowd, trying to make it
go in the direction he wanted. We came nearer to the multitude.
Most of these people are from somewhere else, said el Kebdani.
They’re not from Tangier.
Where do you think they’re from?
The Rif, most of them. Can’t you tell by their faces? Look at them
They’re Riffians! Aren’t they Riffians?
You’re right. They certainly look like it. They’re from our country.
The crowd had begun to run towards the main bus stop.
Piles of stones lay here and there because the street was being
repaved. The men were collecting the stones. Then they went in four
principal directions: up the Calle del Estatuto, down the Cuesta de la
Playa, through the gate of Bab el Fahs, and into the narrow Semmarine
where the money-changers stood. There was another group that ran up to
the police station at the top of the steps and began to throw rocks. El
Kebdani and I followed the crowd that had gone into the Semmarine.
They were stoning a policeman. Some of the stones hit his head. His
white helmet fell onto the pavement. The blood ran down his face. He put
one hand on the top of his head and the other on the holster of his
revolver, and began to run towards the Zoco de Fuera, followed by the
stone-throwers. One of them suddenly turned and hurled a rock at a large
clock that hung over the entrance to an Indian bazaar. The clock said 1.15
when he smashed it. Then they broke the windows of a shoe store and a
camera store beside it.
Let’s get some of those watches and cameras, I said.
No.
Why not?
Because we don’t know yet what’s going to happen. They could

stop us and search us.
But look at them all grabbing the watches over there!
Let them grab, if they want. And if they jump into a well, are you
going to jump in, too?
There was the crash of more plate glass being broken.
You’re crazy, I told him. You’re afraid! I didn’t think you were like
that.
You’re the crazy one. Steal by yourself, if you want.
Shots rang out from the region of the police station.
The police have begun shooting, said el Kebdani. Look at what
they’re doing to the Zapatería Rex!
A group of men came running in our direction, all of them carrying
rocks. Women and children were screaming. The peddlers and stall-
keepers were abandoning their merchandise and fleeing. El Kebdani
pulled my arm. Come on! Run!
We rushed and hid behind the booth of a Jewish money-changer
almost at the entrance of the market. The smashing of the shop windows
continued in the Plazuela Pérez Galdós, and the sound of shooting was
coming closer. Everyone is running and crying out. The shots are very
near. I raised my head and peered out. A man was rolling on the
pavement in front of us, blood pouring from him. A Moroccan policeman
ran behind, nervously brandishing his revolver.
Duck! cried el Kebdani. Do you want them to kill us?
Look through this crack, I told him. Can you see all right?
Yes. I can see.
I think that one’s dead. He’s not moving.
I see him. But shut up.
People run and shout. The rapid gunfire comes closer.
A Moroccan youth tried to crawl in with us. We pushed him away.
Find another place! Yes, get out of here! There’s no room here for you.
Or stay out there where you are until they shoot you, I added.
Three other youths halted in their flight and stood still near us. The
two taller ones helped the shorter one climb up onto the roof of a shop.
Once he was up there, he looked around quickly and called down: Let’s

get out of here fast!
The continuous gunfire was louder. A cry, and there is the thump of
a body falling to the pavement.
They’ve got another, I said.
I’m listening and watching, he told me.
A policeman appeared, carrying a machine-gun. As he passed, the
short youth uttered a cry, and leapt down on top of him from the roof. We
both raised our heads above the booth. The policeman is lying face
down, with the young man on top of him, hammering his head with his fist
as if he were pounding a nail.
Do you know who that policeman is? said el Kebdani.
No.
That’s Inspector Barcia. His father’s Moroccan and his mother
Spanish.
The youth rose and picked up the machine-gun that lay a few feet
away. Jerkily he turned it this way and that, trying to understand how it
worked. But it was no use. He had no idea.
The Inspector lay there unconscious.
Suddenly the young man raised the machine-gun with both hands
above his head and, uttering an oath, threw it to the ground with all his
might.
Inaal dinek!
Then another policeman appeared, firing one shot after another. The
short youth spun around, crying out. The policeman fired again, this time
hitting him in the belly. He fell and rolled into the gutter.
He got it in the back and front, I said.
I’m watching.
I’ve never seen a man shot before, I said. Only in the movies.
Well, now you’re seeing it before your eyes, said el Kebdani.
They must be killing people like this all over town.
What do you expect them to do?
El Kebdani’s forehead was covered with sweat.
Keep calm, I told him.
What are you talking about? he demanded. I don’t need your advice.

You’re trembling, though, I said.
I’m not trembling, he whispered furiously. Can’t you shut up? Do
you want them to spill our guts here, like that one out there?
What a coward you are, I murmured.
All right. I’m a coward. But shut up.
A third policeman came into view, shooting one shot into the air. He
helped the other one lift the Inspector from the ground where he had been
lying. The other picked up the machine-gun and put the Inspector’s cap on
his head for him. How do you feel? he asked him.
I’m all right. Just dizzy.
I got that dog, the policeman told him.
They walked over to the youth. One of them moved him with his
foot. Then they turned and began to run down the hill towards the Zoco
Chico.
Let’s get out of here, whispered el Kebdani.
Where to?
Anywhere. If they find us in here we’re finished.
There was the sound of more shots approaching.
Come on. Fast, he said.
I climbed out first. Look! The boy’s moving. He’s still alive!
Hurry! El Kebdani pulled me by the arm. Do you want them to get us
too?
We saw the three policemen running down the Siaghines. And we
ran down the Calle el Mansour. Halfway down the hill el Kebdani
stopped. Wait a minute. I’ve got to piss.
I felt the need, too. As we stood there leaning against the door of a
shop, people came running by. Ahead of us in the Saqqaya we saw a
young man lurching along, leaning heavily to the right under the weight of
the bag he was carrying. We’re in luck, said el Kebdani. Here’s Qaabil.
We’ll go with him up to his shack at Sidi Bouknadel.
El Kebdani had often spoken about Qaabil and how he had worked
for him as a cargador.
Is that the smuggler you told me about? I said. The one who has so
much money?

That’s the one. He’s got enough to bury you and me from head to
foot.
He doesn’t look as if he had a hundred pesetas in the world, I told
him.
The little square was empty of people. Occasionally a few men ran
across it in one direction or another.
Qaabil! cried el Kebdani.
Qaabil stopped walking and set the bag down on the pavement.
Where are you going? el Kebdani asked him.
To the shack. Come on with me. Sallafa’s there with Bouchra. I’ve
shaved the dirty bitch’s hair and eyebrows.
Qaabil and I carried the bag between us as we climbed the steps in
the direction of Amrah.
What’s going on? el Kebdani asked him.
I don’t know. When I came out of the bodega there was a lot of
running around. I didn’t see anything more.
Didn’t you hear the shots?
I heard a few, but they were a long way off, and I couldn’t find out
what was happening.
The police are shooting at the Moroccans, said el Kebdani.
What for?
It’s the thirtieth of March.
And what are the Moroccans fighting with? asked Qaabil.
Rocks. What do you expect them to fight with?
Are there many dead?
They’re shooting at everybody they see, if he’s a Moroccan.
A voice from behind us shouted: Clear the way!
A man was carrying a wounded friend on his back, while a third
walked behind.
Who’s the friend with you? Qaabil asked el Kebdani. What does he
do?
He used to sell soup and fish in the street, and he worked at a
restaurant in the Zoco de Fuera.
Qaabil’s shack was built at the very edge of the high cliffs above the

Sidi Bouknadel beach. One of its doors opened onto the cliff. The other
gave onto an alley that led downward in the direction of Amrah. It was a
real smuggler’s shack.
When we went in, Sallafa was groaning a song of Farid el
Atrache’s: Forget him who forgets you, and don’t regret his loss . Her
hair and eyebrows had been cleanly shaved with a razor, so that now she
looked like a handsome boy. She wore a lightweight, black and white
striped zigdoun. Bouchra was stretched out on the divan in a red and
gold brocade caftan with a gauzy dfin over it. She had a sebsi in her
hand. The girls put me in mind of the three days I had spent with
Abdeslam and Sebtaoui at Sida Aziza’s house, back in Tetuan. I had a
thousand pesetas in my pocket at that time, I thought. And today, holes in
my pockets and no work.
A tajine of fish and potatoes sat on the taifor, ready to be served.
Sallafa brought us the tas with a kettle of water and a cake of soap, so
we could wash our hands. She nearly lost her balance while she was
pouring the water for el Kebdani. When my turn came she smiled at me.
She poured, smiled, and poured again, holding the kettle unsteadily.
When she got to Qaabil she began to laugh. He seemed annoyed with her,
and pulled the kettle away from her, crying: Let go of that, you dirty
whore!
Always talking about your mother, she said.
He made as if to slap her. El Kebdani intervened, taking up the
kettle and beginning to pour the water over Qaabil’s hands.
The next time I won’t just cut off your hair and eyebrows. I’ll drop
you off the cliff out there.
Try it if you dare, she told him. Just try it, and we’ll see who goes
over the cliff.
Aren’t you two ever going to stop? Bouchra cried.
The tajine was excellent, and very heavily spiced. We sat around
the table afterwards, until five in the afternoon, mainly talking about the
trouble in the streets as we drank our wine, smoked our kif, and listened
to old records by Om Kaltoum.
I had already fallen asleep on the divan, when el Kebdani called out

my name sharply. Mohamed! We’re going out. Stay here with the two
girls until we get back. Go back to sleep if you like.
All right. I’ll sleep a little.
I heard them shut the door and turn the key in the lock. Sallafa and
Bouchra both lay asleep, Bouchra on her right side facing the wall.
Sallafa lay on her stomach, with her face also towards the wall. She lay
like someone who had been dragged out of the sea. It seemed to me that
her buttocks needed to be given first-aid treatment. As I was dropping off
to sleep, I heard her move. Then she said: Has that dog gone out?
Slowly I opened my eyes. She had got up and was turning on the
light. So you weren’t asleep after all, I thought.
She stretched in such a way that she managed to project her bosom
and her buttocks at the same time. Then she stood up straight and looked
at me archly. Her eyes seemed half-asleep.
Are you asleep too? she asked me.
I pulled myself up into a sitting position. I’m just resting a little, I
said.
She lifted the half-empty bottle of wine and indicated the two
glasses on the table. Come into the other room so we won’t wake up
Bouchra.
Shall I go in or not? I said to myself. Why not? She’s the boss here
the mistress of the house.
When I got to my feet I realized that my head was heavy. There was
a dull pain in my right temple. I glanced at Bouchra, wondering if she too
were awake. She’s attractive, but I don’t dare go near her.
What difference does it make? I thought. I’ll follow Sallafa into the
other room. Women have their own system. They know how to act in
such cases.
I walked into the room. It was a completely furnished bedroom, not
at all what I had expected to see in a shack. In one corner there was a
high pile of cartons. Perhaps they contained some of Qaabil’s
contraband. She was sitting on the edge of the bed. I sat down on a couch
facing her.
Sit over here by me, she told me.

I hesitated.
Are you afraid of Qaabil?
It’s not that, I finally said. I just met him. El Kebdani and I were in
the street when they were shooting. We were on our way down from the
Zoco de Fuera to the Saqqaya.
Even if he finds you here with me, he won’t do anything. I know
him. A dog that barks.
He might not do anything, I was thinking, looking at her. He might
just throw me out of the shack and go on living with you, if he loves you.
And there’s no doubt he loves you. From what I’ve seen and heard, it’s
you who manages him, and that means he loves you.
I rose and went to sit beside her on the bed. She filled the two
glasses herself. Then she reached out to the table beside the bed and lit a
cigarette. Her eyelashes were black and her eyes were bloodshot. She
placed the cigarette between my lips and lit a second one. I thought of
Lalla Harouda back at the brothel in Tetuan, and of how she had done the
same thing. Today everything is different. Today is better than yesterday.
And if Bouchra should wake up? I said.
She’s my sister.
Your sister!
Well, like my sister.
Ah! I see.
She smiled as she looked at me. Her lips are tiny, like a ring for the
finger. I had heard that a small mouth on a girl indicated a very tight sex.
I smiled back at her. She finished her drink. I was thinking of the boy
who had been shot by the police. She took my hand and lay back, looking
up at the ceiling as she smoked. From time to time she squeezed my hand.
She too must be thinking of something. Her hand is warm. Her long slim
fingers seem made to nibble on. I lay down beside her and smoked,
staring up at a doll that hung on the wall. I press her fragile hand, thinking
of the boy who had come and tried in vain to get behind the booth with
us. I felt sorry now that we had not let him in.
The short young man sprang, landing on top of the policeman. He
pounds his head as if he were driving in a nail. The second policeman

comes, and he is rolling on the pavement.
We stayed a while quietly, she with her hand in mine. I wondered if
Qaabil enjoyed tranquil moments like this with her. She stirred. So did I.
We looked at each other and smiled.
Wait, she said. I’ll undress. She snuffed out her cigarette in the
ashtray. Ideas of ecstasy tickled the inside of my head as she pulled off
her clothing. Her panties are pink and she wears no brassiere. Her
breasts are tiny, like two lemons. My mind went back to the time when I
had sucked the oranges on the tree woman at Oran.
Get undressed.
It’s better if I keep my clothes on. If Qaabil and el Kebdani should
come back I wouldn’t have time to get dressed.
They won’t be back for another three or four hours, she said.
Where do you think they went?
I don’t know. He never tells me where he’s going. But whenever he
goes out he stays a long time, especially if he has one of his friends with
him, because then he feels more daring and does crazier things. Maybe
they’ve gone to the whorehouse together. That’s what I think, if you want
to know.
Her face was heart-shaped, white, with pink cheeks. It was also the
face of a boy. I shut my eyes and let my head fall onto her warm breast. A
pillow of flesh, I said to myself. I’ve got my head on a pillow that’s
pulsing with life. All I could think of was the cushion under my head, and
how beautifully it calmed the pain in my temple. She buried her fingers
deep in my hair, and I reached out blindly for her head, forgetting that it
had been shaved. The hard short hairs tickled my palm. When I rubbed
them the wrong way they stood up. Why did he shave off her hair and
eyebrows? He must have been jealous. I licked the hard nipples. Then
with delight I began to suck on her right breast, filling my mouth with it. I
could feel the tight hard part in the middle of the softness. When I tried to
do the same with her left breast, she laughed, squirmed, and covered it
with her hand. She tries to direct me back to the right breast, and I keep
insisting on the left one. The left breast must be very sensitive. It
becomes a game, and soon she cannot bear to have either breast touched.

We go on for a little while with the game, both of us laughing.
I’m ticklish on that side.
You’re ticklish on both sides now.
She laughed and pulled off her panties. Then with a smile she
unbuttoned my fly. The blind dragon rose up and stood rigid in her hand.
She smoothed it briefly from its head to its roots, and set to work rubbing
it against the lip between her legs. The hairs of the black triangle there
are as rough as those on her scalp. The dragon feels the roughness as he
scrapes his bald head on them.
I want to go inside, but she wants only to rub. She squeezes it,
chokes it, measuring its size at one end and the other with her hand. I
pulled away from her. Then she let me inside and hugged me with her
arms and legs. I imagined talking to my sex: There you are, dragon! Blind
and bald. This is your first combat in Tangier. Fix it so she’ll never
forget you. Be strong whether you like it or not.
It was Bouchra’s voice that awoke me. Get up, Sallafa! Are you
asleep?
I sat up quickly. Has el Kebdani come back? I asked her.
Not yet.
I went out into the larger room. From there I heard Sallafa saying to
Bouchra: Hasn’t the pimp got here yet?
I’m afraid they may have arrested them and taken them to the police
station, with all the trouble in the street.
They can take them all the way to Hell, Sallafa said.
I went into the latrine. My sex was limp and stuck to my thighs. I
came out and sat down with Bouchra. She seemed preoccupied, even
sad. I watched her. Something was bothering her. Sallafa bustled in, she
looked at me, smiled, and came over to me, leaning above me. Then she
took my face in her two hands, and stroked it. Finally she gave me a
resounding kiss on the lips, the way one kisses a baby. I smiled.
She went into the latrine and shut the door. I remembered the day in
Aïn Ketiout when the girl gave me brown bread with butter and honey
and put perfume on me and kissed my lips, and I told her I was leaving
with my family for Tetuan. Where can she be now? It’s a different

situation here with Sallafa. I looked at Bouchra, sitting dejectedly with
her elbows on her knees and her head between her hands. The way she
sat reminded me of the way my mother had sat after she had heard that
they had caught my father. Presently she got up, went to the phonograph
and put on a record. Oukkeddibou Nafsi it was, with Om Kaltoum
singing. It made me think of Aïn Khabbès in Tetuan and the hashish-
smokers and drunks at the café where I had worked.
The key turned in the door and I sat up. El Kebdani came in first
then Qaabil. They looked tired.
What news? I asked el Kebdani.
He turned down the volume on the phonograph.
It’s all over, he said. A lot of Moroccans are dead or wounded.
Qaabil went into the bedroom. El Kebdani sat down facing me.
Sallafa came out of the latrine.
Where have you been? she asked el Kebdani.
We had something to do.
Why don’t you admit you went to a whorehouse? she said, laughing.
You went to Seoudiya el Kahala’s. Or else it was Zohra el Hamqat’s.
Before el Kebdani could answer, Qaabil shouted: Are you going to
shut that dirty mouth?
Whose dirty mouth? Yours?
She went into the bedroom. El Kebdani got to his feet.
Let’s go out for a little while, he said. We can come back later.
We went out through the other door that gave onto the cliffs and the
beach below. The cold wind slapped my face. We lit cigarettes and
stood there. The lights of the ships anchored in the harbour were
brilliant.
I’ve got something important to tell you, said el Kebdani.
What is it?
Qaabil has agreed to let you work with us tomorrow.
Yes. That is important, I said.
But on one condition. You have to stay up here at the shack tonight
and all day tomorrow. At least, until the time comes to go to work.
I was thinking: That’s just what I want. It’s a condition that’s fine

with me.
To him I said: But why?
I’ll tell you why. Qaabil doesn’t know you yet, and he’s afraid you
might talk to somebody.
And you? You think –
He interrupted me. No! But then, I know you. I told him about you
and that persuaded him. I said you were serious and honest and tough.
Good, I said.
You see, he’s had a lot of trouble with his cargadores. He’s sure
the only reason he had this run-in with the Customs and the secret police
was that he used new cargadores. Half the time it’s the police
themselves who send out the cargadores to work with the smugglers.
That way they find out where the work’s going to be done, what time it’s
going to happen, and even what’s going to be moved in. The police give
them three or four times as much as the smugglers do.
I didn’t know that, I said.
They feel protected, you see. After a pause he went on: Qaabil’s a
good man. The only trouble with him is that he’s stingy. If you want to get
what’s coming to you, you practically have to steal it from him.
I laughed.
He’s only generous with women. With girls like Sallafa, for
instance.
We both laughed. Is he jealous of her? I asked him.
He knows she’ll open her legs to anything. Even a monkey.
And in spite of that he loves her?
That’s right.
But why did he shave off her hair?
He’s crazy about her. He cut off her hair and eyebrows so she
wouldn’t go very far from the shack. Sometimes she’ll wander off and
stay ten days or more, and he’s like a maniac the whole time.
Where does she go when she runs away like that?
She gets drunk and stays with friends. Where would she go?
Do you think she loves him?
He laughed. Yes, she loves him, he said with irony. Does a woman

like that love anybody? All she wants is the cash. I’ve heard her say it
straight out. One day I heard her tell him: You’re wasting your time with
me. Look for another one to love, she said. Get it into your head that I
don’t love you!
And what does he say when she talks to him like that?
What do you expect him to say? Either he doesn’t answer, or he
threatens to beat her up. But I’ve never seen him lift a finger to her.
I’ve noticed. But in spite of all she says, he still loves her. He’s a
strange one.
He thinks she’s worked magic on him.
And you? Do you think she’s got him under a spell?
I don’t believe in spells, he said. He loves her, and that’s all there
is to it.
But how did he ever manage to cut off her hair?
He got her drunk, and then he put hashish in her tea. When she
passed out he got to work on her with the razor.
And when she woke up?
She smashed a few dishes and swore she’d get even with him. But
she’s like him. She won’t do anything.
And Bouchra?
Bouchra’s her best friend. Sallafa goes crazy when she’s separated
from her.
Hasn’t Bouchra got a lover?
I don’t know, he said slowly. I think the only one she likes is
herself. She’s hard to get on with. But she’s a nice girl. Not a mean bone
in her body. She only talks when she has to.
I saw that.
We lighted more cigarettes. I thought of telling him what had
happened between me and Sallafa, but I was afraid he might turn out to
be jealous, or might envy me for my good fortune. Or he might go out of
loyalty to Qaabil and tell him.
When we went back into the shack the penetrating voice of Om
Kaltoum was singing:
I’m jealous of the lucky glass that touches your lips.

And I would stop it from reaching them.

9 
All morning Sallafa and I stayed at the shack. Qaabil and el
Kebdani had gone without giving me any idea of their plans. Bouchra had
decided to visit her mother, whom she had not seen in several days. I
assumed that Qaabil and el Kebdani had gone to arrange for the passage
of the contraband that we would be moving later.
Sallafa was cleaning the bedroom. I reclined in the sala smoking,
uneasy in my mind. I called out to her: Have you got a glass of wine in
there?
She loomed in the doorway. Wait a minute. We’ll open a bottle and
drink it together. She smiled and disappeared.
We’ve really begun a game of love, I said to myself. The present
situation here in the shack made me think of the morning long ago when
the owner of the pear tree in Aïn Ketiout had shut me into his storeroom.
But I also saw differences. At least I am free now to decide whether to
stay or leave, even though leaving would mean breaking down the door.
I rose and stood on the divan, leaning out of the window and looking
down at the sea below. The sky was cloudy and the water was rough. A
few ships, both large and small, were going by. She came up and stood
behind me, putting her hands on my shoulders.
What are you looking at? she murmured. I could feel the heat of her
breath in my ear. Have I become her lover? Poverty and love go together.
What a world!
I’m looking at the ocean. I’ve never been on a ship in my life, have
you?
Who, me? Ask me instead if I’ve ever been outside Tangier. I’ve
never been anywhere at all, either by land or water.
You’ve never been out of Tangier?
Never! Why would I? Where would I go? Who would I go with?
I’ve got a feeling that if I should leave Tangier I’d never come back.
Never! No, I’d never come back.
Why not?
I don’t know.

I turned to face her, and her eyes opened very wide, as if she were
going to say: Isn’t that the right answer?
I could not go on looking at her, and I let my gaze drop. This girl
was beginning to worry me. I looked at the door instead. Then she too
turned towards the door, and said again: What are you looking at?
I’m looking at the door.
Why? What’s wrong with it?
Nothing.
What are you thinking about? You’re thinking of something.
I’m thinking of the door, I said.
What’s the matter with the door?
I don’t like to be locked in.
We sat down. She had put two glasses and a bottle of wine on the
taifor.
It used to bother me to have somebody turn the key on me, but I’ve
got used to it. She smiled.
I’m not used to it, I said. And I don’t want to get used to it, either. I
might as well be in jail.
I was thinking that in the face of that locked door we were equally
powerless, she and I. She’s Qaabil’s girl. And I’m his cargador, but one
he still doesn’t trust. The idea came to me to go over and break down the
door, but that would ruin everything: my friendship with el Kebdani, my
affair with Sallafa, and the possibility of working for Qaabil and perhaps
becoming as trusted a cargador as el Kebdani.
What are you thinking about? That’s enough thinking! Open the
bottle.
I picked up the corkscrew.
I’ve got something to say to you, she went on.
I looked at her. What’s that?
Why don’t we leave Tangier? Run away together?
I looked harder at her. Where to?
Anywhere. Casablanca, for instance.
I thought of saying: What about your hair and eyebrows? But I was
afraid of hurting her, so I said: And what would we do there?

Anything. All sorts of things.
I opened the bottle.
I’m not a skilled worker in anything, I said. And what would you do
in a place like Casablanca?
I can do any kind of work, she declared.
I filled both glasses.
I could work as a maid with a French family, for instance. I have a
friend named Fadila. She went to Casablanca. And in no time at all she
found a job with a French family.
At this point I remembered what el Kebdani had told me the night
before about how Sallafa became whenever she was separated from
Bouchra. What about Bouchra? I asked her.
Oh, she’ll go with us too.
Is this girl out of her mind? I thought.
I see, I said brusquely.
She’s all right, objected Sallafa. What’s the matter with her? Don’t
you think she’s all right?
I stared at her.
I didn’t say anything against her. I just asked you.
You don’t know her yet, she told me. When you get to know her,
she’ll be just like your sister.
The way she is for you, I said to myself. I passed one of the glasses
to her. She took it, and then held it out to my lips for me to drink from. At
the same time, she directed the glass I held in my hands to her own lips.
We drank slowly, our arms hooked. If I had broken down the door and
gone out, I should not have had the pleasure of this moment. Never before
had I drunk in this fashion with anyone. The expression in her half-closed
eyes, plus a slight movement which she made towards me, said clearly
that she wanted my lips. She began to give me, little by little, all the wine
that was in her mouth. That also was something I had not experienced
before. I am discovering all kinds of new things. This time it was I who
led her into the bedroom.
We were already back in the sala when I heard the key turn in the
lock. Farid el Atrache was singing: When will you return, love of my

soul? Sallafa had been sitting pensively, listening, neither happy nor sad.
I understand her only when she is laughing or quarrelling. It had been
good in bed, better than yesterday, or so it seemed to me. Who knows
what’s passing through her head at this minute? Perhaps she’s annoyed
because I gave her no precise answer when she made her suggestion that
we run away together to Casablanca. I watched el Kebdani come in,
carrying a basket of food from the market. He seemed tired and
depressed.
Ah, Qaabil! You’re back? I cried. He stared at me, and I began to
stammer apologies.
I’m sorry. I was thinking of something else. What’s the news?
The news is bad. Terrible!
What? Kheir, insha’Allah!
He set the basket down in front of Sallafa.
Here. Qaabil says to fry all the fish.
She glared at him. Is this a time to be bringing back food for lunch?
she demanded.
We were busy setting up a job.
I don’t care what you were busy doing. One of you could have
brought the stuff back long ago.
Has something happened, or what? I asked el Kebdani.
It’s all clear now, he said. It was the Spaniards who engineered the
riots. They hired the mob and brought it in from outside.
Ah, so what they said about el Merouani at the Café Chato was true
then.
Maybe. Who knows? All we know is that the Spanish started it.
I see! They used the anniversary as an excuse to start things, and
then they used the Moroccans as pawns.
It looks that way.
That’s very bad.
We know dozens of people were killed, and yet only six or seven
funeral processions have gone through the Zoco Chico on the way to the
mosque.
And all the other bodies?

They must be hiding them so the public won’t see how many there
are. Most of the ones who were killed are from out of town. That’s why
it’s so easy for them to bury them in secret.
I thought for a moment. Then I said: Are they letting people walk
freely around the city?
Yes, but there are guards everywhere. It’ll probably go on like this
for several days. The soldiers are working hand-in-hand with the police.
They search anybody they think looks suspicious, and take whoever they
want to headquarters for a grilling.
Where’s Qaabil?
He went to his father’s house. Hasn’t Bouchra come back yet?
Not yet, Sallafa said. Why don’t you go and get her? She may be
afraid to come back alone, with all the police and soldiers in the street.
Go on, Kebdani, she coaxed.
I don’t know where her mother lives, he said.
In Dar el Baroud, near the Café Makina.
But I don’t know the house.
Ask anybody down there. There are always children playing in the
street. They all know her.
Wait a while. She’ll be along. I tell you there’s nobody in the street
to ask. In times like this nobody goes out unless he has to. And as for
children playing in the street, I didn’t catch sight of one anywhere all
morning.
Khlass! she cried. Come on! Life has suddenly changed? It’s the end
of the world? Just say you don’t want to go. That would be enough.
That’s not true, he began.
Don’t try to talk!
After a moment she went on, but as if speaking to herself: I know
what I’m going to do. I swear, if you find me still around here you can
spit on me. You can piss on me!
Everything’s all set, he told me. Expect to work tonight. There’ll be
three other cargadores going with us, and we’ll be using two cars, one to
hold the stuff and the other for the men. I’ll be bringing the stuff in from
the ship in a rowboat. You’ll be on the shore with the other three, and

you’ll carry it up from the beach to the car. You’ll need all your strength,
because you’ve got to move fast the whole time. And you’ll need your
nerve. The Customs men may be there on the shore somewhere, or stop
us at the edge of town. If that happens, you’re to do whatever either
Qaabil or his partner tells you. You’ll meet his partner. The secret police
could come up while you’re emptying the stuff out of the car, once you
get to town. I like to tell you right out. The job is dangerous. It’s a job
where anything can happen. They may shoot at us. You understand that?
Yes. I understand.
Sometimes the leader is able to bribe them. But usually they can’t
get together on the amount, and that’s when the trouble begins. That’s the
point when things begin to get rough.
How rough?
I mean they shoot it out.
So Qaabil has a pistol, I thought. That’s something to know. I must
be very careful with Sallafa. What was there to stop him from firing on
us both if he found us in bed together?
Has Qaabil got a gun? I asked him.
Ah! That’s none of your business. I’m just telling you what may
happen. It doesn’t matter one way or the other to you and me whether
Qaabil and his partner have guns or not. You understand?
I was just asking.
I tell you things I couldn’t tell any other cargador, he said.
I know. And thanks.
He turned and called out: Where’s the sebsi, Sallafa?
She was in the kitchen. I don’t know, she shouted. Look for it.
She’s getting even with him, I thought. I suddenly remembered that
we had smoked a little kif while we had been in the bedroom;
nevertheless I pretended to look for the pipe along with him there in the
sala. Then he went into the bedroom and called out: Here it is! I’ve
found it!
I went and put on a record. It was Mohamed Abd el Wahab singing
‘When Afternoon Comes’.

10 
I got into the car with the three other young cargadores and the old
man who was driving. I was the youngest. In spite of the strong smell of
wine that came from the driver, he drove carefully. The speedometer
never showed more than seventy kilometres an hour, and on curves and
inclines it dropped to forty or thirty. We got to Cape Spartel about two in
the morning, and drew up behind a large black sedan that stood there.
The door of the other car opened, and a tall, powerful-looking man
got out. I guessed that he was about forty-five years old. He came
casually over to our car.
How’s the road? he asked the driver.
Fine. We didn’t see anybody.
We all got out, with the exception of the driver. From their
conversation I understood that they were referring to the police and
Customs men. And I realized that this tall man was Qaabil’s partner.
Now’s the time to be men, he told us. Then he put his hand on my
shoulder and looked intently at me. What part of the Rif are you from? he
said.
Beni Chiker. My name is Choukri.
I know the Chikriyine. The Riffians are tough.
He removed his hand. I know the Riffians, he said again.
I was with them in the Civil War in Spain. I hope you’re a real
Riffian like the others.
I smiled.
He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and held it out to each of us in
turn. It’s a good beginning, I thought. He looks like a good man to deal
with. Compared to him, Qaabil seems like a boy. He too may be a good
man, but you sense his weakness. Whereas it would be easy to feel
loyalty to this man.
Are you ready? he asked us, and we all said: Yes.
The path downward was hard to negotiate. We squeezed between
trees, crashed through bushes, and clambered over boulders. Are we
going to try to carry the stuff back up this same path? I wondered.

Call me Kandoussi if you want to call me anything, said Qaabil’s
partner.
I decided that this was probably not his real name. It might be only
his business name. The path went on being difficult. Several times I
stumbled into holes and scraped myself on the sharp rocks.
You’ve got to be very careful not to fall once you’ve got the stuff on
your back, he said. What we’re carrying is fragile.
What could be in the cartons? I thought. Something breakable. What
could that be?
When we reached the strip of beach at the bottom of the cliffs he
pulled a flashlight out of his pocket and began to make signals with it in
the direction of the water. The signals came back from the darkness out
there.
We found Qaabil sitting alone on the sand. Beside him lay a pile of
sacks and a coil of rope. Ah, you got here! he cried. Everything ready?
Everything’s perfect so far, replied Kandoussi.
Soon we heard the sound of a motor. More messages flashed from
the water. Kandoussi sent back the same succession of flashes. The sea
was rough. The motor came nearer.
Get ready, said Kandoussi.
The sound of the motor stopped.
After a quarter of an hour of silence, there were more signals, which
Kandoussi answered.
The rowboat’s on the way, he said. Get down to the edge of the
water.
Two of the cargadores took off their trousers and sandals. The
rowboat hove into view, rising and falling with the movement of the
waves. The two cargadores waded into the water and guided the craft
inward, one on each side of it. Kandoussi ran down to the water, and they
pulled the boat up onto the beach. There were nine cartons. We began to
carry them to a spot not far from the edge of the water, where we stacked
them on the sand. The cartons were not as big and heavy as I had
expected. Whatever was in them must be very valuable. Watches,
perhaps? Rapidly we emptied the boat.

Can you get back to the ship all right? Kandoussi was saying to el
Kebdani. It’s not too rough?
It’s all right.
If you think there’s any danger, we’ll leave the boat beached here
until the morning and take it back then.
No. I don’t think I’ll have any trouble.
Look out for those rocks.
I know, said el Kebdani. I know the whole place.
See you soon, I said to him.
Ah, Mohamed? B’slemah. I’ll see you back at the shack in an hour.
The two cargadores began to pull the rowboat back out into the
water, with el Kebdani plying the oars. I watched him disappear into the
darkness, riding up and down on the waves.
Working quickly, we put two cartons into each sack. When we had
tied up the openings, Kandoussi came up to me and said: Can you carry
two cartons, or is one enough for you?
I can carry three if you want, I said with great confidence.
Probably he doesn’t believe me. My body is very thin. But I had my
pride. I was thinking: This is better than begging or stealing. And better
too than letting an old man suck on me, or selling harira and fried fish to
the Djebala in the Zoco de Fuera. Better than any of the work I’ve had
It’s an adventure, and I feel like a man. In any case, I am seventeen. I feel
on this early morning that I am entering into a new phase of my life.
We loaded the sacks on our backs, and started up the same path we
had come down. Kandoussi went first, and Qaabil, empty-handed,
brought up the rear. Each one of us cargadores was carrying a sack with
two cartons in it. Kandoussi carried the ninth carton, also wrapped in its
sack.
It was not long before my load began to weigh more and more
heavily on me. The pain hit my spine and the nape of my neck. I must
have placed the sack in the wrong position when I took it onto my back.
But now I did not dare stop and shift it for fear that Kandoussi would
think I was tired, and we were still only about halfway up the path. If I
show signs of weakness now, very likely he will not hire me the next

time he needs a cargador. As for Qaabil, at the moment he seems as
unnecessary to the scene as he is ineffective in his daily life. Should I
even obey his orders if he gives them? Then I wondered why I should be
thinking such things about him. Up to now he has treated me very well. I
must try and get rid of these feelings. I must fight against them, even
while my shoulders shoot pains in every direction and the bones at the
back of my neck go on cracking. I was breathing heavily through my
mouth, and my throat was getting dry. I suppose the trouble came from
having smoked too much Virginia tobacco and kif. But Sallafa also had a
part in my weakness. During the past day I had made love with her four
times. And here I was, thinking of doing it again. Yes, I’m going to make
love with her. There’s no doubt about that, if only everything goes well
here and I manage to get to the shack before Qaabil and el Kebdani.
But the key? Will Qaabil give it to me when we’ve finished here, if
for instance he finds that for some reason he has to stay on longer than he
thought, or if he can’t get back until morning? The idea of getting into bed
with Sallafa at this hour of the morning excites me, and that helps me
forget the pain of the load on my shoulders and the burning shortness of
breath. The money I was going to get for this work meant nothing
compared with what I should find in the shack. Money was only for the
world outside the shack. I wish Sallafa were with us now, just walking
ahead of us without carrying anything. Am I myself beginning to fall in
love with her? Merely to think of her makes my heart beat harder. Then I
feel a wave of hostility towards her. I imagine myself insulting her,
slapping her, trying to work up her temper. Maybe I like her better angry
than calm, better sad than happy. Maybe she means more to me when she
is being crazy than when she is sensible. I like the way she behaves when
she is with Qaabil. Yes, I like to watch her fight with him. I can imagine
myself in Qaabil’s place when she disappears, losing control like him
and waiting desperately for her return. Thus at this point I learn a new
truth about my feelings for Sallafa.
When we got up to the road, the two drivers were there, one
standing beside each car. They helped us pile the boxes into the back seat
of the first car. Kandoussi got into the front of that car and Qaabil got in

with us. We went ahead of Kandoussi, whose car followed always at the
same distance, about a hundred metres behind. We drove so slowly that I
decided this must have been arranged beforehand, perhaps as a way of
protecting the merchandise. I doubt that any of the cargadores knew
exactly where we were going. During the entire ride no one spoke a
word. From time to time the cargador sitting to the right of me coughed
and sniffed violently. We took the road past the animal cemetery by the
river at Boubana. When we got to the crossroads by the Spanish
Cemetery both cars stopped, and Qaabil got out. The driver of the other
car came over.
Qaabil spoke to our driver. Take them wherever they want to go.
He handed me the key. Go to the shack, and don’t open up for
anybody but el Kebdani.
The other driver got in and sat in Qaabil’s seat. Then we drove
down the road towards Dradeb, leaving the other car still parked. The
operation had certainly been very carefully planned. I was sure now that
Kandoussi and Qaabil trusted absolutely no one. After our car is gone
they’re going somewhere that only the two of them know about, to unload
the stuff. Qaabil must have another key, otherwise he would have said
something about my letting him in. He may work all night and not come
back before morning.
We got to the hill at Dradeb. The driver smelled even more strongly
of wine now than he had before. Where do you want to go, brothers? he
asked.
Two of the cargadores wanted to be left in the Zoco de Fuera. I
asked him to take me to the Place de la Casbah.
I know where to take you, he told me.
The one who had been coughing beside me also wanted to go to the
Casbah. I looked at him, and he looked at me, but we said nothing.
The two cargadores got down in the Zoco de Fuera, as two
policemen walked past. The car drove on through the arch of Bab el
Fahs. The streets were empty. Another pair of policemen stood in front of
an apartment house. My fear was that they might stop us and ask to see
our papers. It was then that I realized how much colder the night was

now than it had been earlier. We got out of the car in the Place de la
Casbah, the last cargador and I, leaving the two drivers together.
I’m going down here towards Amrah, I said to the cargador. And
you?
He coughed. I’m going down that way, too, to Oued el Ahardan. We
passed under the arch and started down the hill. I did not dare bring up
the subject of the work we had just done. After a silence he said: Is el
Kebdani a friend of yours?
Yes.
He’s a good man. This is the first time you’ve worked like this?
Yes, it’s the first time.
And Qaabil, is he a friend of yours, too?
No, he’s a friend of el Kebdani’s. I met Qaabil through him. Are you
a friend of Qaabil’s?
No, I only know Kandoussi. He’s a man with a lot of guts. And he’s
serious. He knows what he’s doing. If he tells you he’s going to do
something, he does it. All the cargadores want to work for him.
I feel the same way, I told him. I noticed how he treated us.
When we got part of the way down the hill, I stood still and pointed
up the small street that led off to the left. I’m going up here to Qaabil’s
shack, I said.
Yes, he said. So you live with Qaabil?
No. He just invited me to stay there. I haven’t got my own place to
sleep yet. El Kebdani introduced me to him. I told you.
I know. See you.
B’slemah!
I heard only my own footsteps in the dark, silent street. Then there
was a shrill scream from two cats nearby. One of them ran in front of me,
the other pursuing it. He’s after her, I thought. But she wants to get away
from him. I hoped Sallafa would not refuse me the delight of being with
her at this early hour. To make love early in the morning before dawn!
This will be the first time I shall have gone to bed with a woman at the
hour of the fjer. A first experience.
I got to the shack, and stuck my ear to the door. Once again I heard

the yelling of the cats, but from a distance. I slid the key carefully into the
lock and opened the door.
There was a light in the bedroom. Is she still awake? I shut the door
and turned the key, locking it. Then I gave the key an extra half-turn so
that the door could not be unlocked from the outside. I tiptoed into the
bedroom. A half bottle of wine sat on the taifor, and beside it the sebsi
and the box of kif. She is lying on her right side with her knees drawn up.
It’s sad to see a girl sleeping alone.
I went back into the sala and turned on the light. Two blankets and
two pillows had been tossed onto the couch. Now I understood. A pillow
and a blanket for me, and the same thing for el Kebdani. I took off my
jacket and trousers, remaining in my underwear. There was a sound from
the bedroom. When I went in to look, she had changed her position. She
was still lying with her knees bent, but now she was facing in the other
direction. I sat down on the edge of the bed and put my hand on her
shoulder, hesitant to awaken her. It would be better to get into the bed
behind her, and then run my hands over her until she wakes up and feels
me there beside her. I climbed slowly into the bed.
Then she said very clearly: Your feet are like ice. Get them away
from me.
What’s the matter? Are you angry with me?
She did not reply. My right hand began to touch her body here and
there. It’s like an orchard, I thought. There are apples and oranges up
here, and pears and peaches back here. And here between her thighs are
persimmons. When my hand arrived there, she pushed it away with force.
Don’t touch me, she said. It’s the wrong time of the month. Go to
sleep.
You mean you’ve got blood? I said incredulously.
Yes. Of course I have. What do you think?
I remembered Monique in her bathroom, sitting on the bidet,
washing the blood from between her legs. So now Sallafa is the way
Monique was.
I understand, I said. How long does it last?
Oh, at least three days.

So the hope of making love early in the morning is gone, I thought. I
may have the chance again some time, and I may not. Who knows what
will happen between us in the next few days? My sex is standing alone in
the region of the peaches. When it tried to walk a little back and forth,
she moved suddenly and lay on her back, saying: Haven’t you any shame
at all? That’s something I won’t do with you.
Just a little walk, that’s all.
What are you talking about? she cried. Are you crazy, or what?
I’m going to follow this through to the end, I said to myself.
Why not? I asked her.
Because that’s something you don’t do with women. It’s a sin. Don’t
you know that?
A sin?
Of course. A sin.
I lay on my back now, as she was doing, and looked at the place
where the blanket pointed upward, where my sex stood alone. The
pressure of the blanket hurt a little, and I arranged it so it would lie back
on my belly. How to make it rest? It’s stubborn. This was the first time I
had been made aware of how extremely stubborn it was. I took hold of
her hand and held it for a moment. Then I brought the hand up and placed
it on my sex. She said nothing. At the touch of her hand, the sex grew
even more eager. I waited for her to play with it as she had done the first
night. But her hand merely remained holding it tightly. When I placed my
hand over hers and pushed it back and forth, she pulled away from me.
Leave me alone. Can’t you just go to sleep? Her voice was
plaintive.
This time it was my own hand instead of hers that moved back and
forth. I started to give it a workout and a rubdown.
What are you doing?
Without looking at her I said: Just let me alone. I’ve got to satisfy it
or it won’t ever lie down.
You’re going to get me filthy, she said. Go into the other room and
do whatever it is you want to do.
I got out of bed, imagining that I was about to seize Asiya by the

tank, and walked into the other room holding my sex in my hand so it
would not get cold. But I had to use both hands to cover myself with the
two blankets. I quickly gave it back the warmth of my hand, so it would
not weaken.
About nine o’clock in the morning we had breakfast together in the
sala. We did not speak. She looked pale, sad and dreamy. I too felt tired
and depressed as a result of the imaginary rape. Is it not a kind of insanity
to conjure up the image of a woman and then proceed to rape her? And I
do not even know whether the girl is still living. It would have been
better to have stayed there in bed, warmed by Sallafa’s body, feeling her
alive and moving beside me. I could have touched her and smelled her.
Asiya was only a great void in my imagination, and I had worked myself
into a frenzy of excitement over this nothingness.
Neither el Kebdani nor Qaabil arrived. Could something have
happened to el Kebdani? It was normal enough for Qaabil not to have
appeared, but I was worried that el Kebdani might have fallen into the
hands of the Customs men. He is the best friend I have found so far in this
city.
Is it Sallafa’s bleeding that worries her now? I feel sorry for
women. Sometimes they get raped. Sometimes they have to bear children.
And blood runs from them for several days each month. Perhaps she is
thinking about Bouchra, who still has not come back. It could be. El
Kebdani was right about Sallafa and Bouchra; Bouchra is the point
where Sallafa’s strange sadness begins. I wonder what will happen if
Bouchra stays away much longer. I am certain it is not Qaabil who
preoccupies her thoughts, and I feel a sudden surge of warmth towards
her. It would be good to ask her forgiveness, but I do not dare. I turned
and looked at her: she was totally immersed in her reverie. I liked to see
her in this sad state. Never before had I seen her give in to her
melancholy in this way. She has let something go inside her, and now it is
lost. Perhaps she is thinking that it is lost for ever, or she may be trying to
devise a way of getting it back. It would be better to go out and leave her
to herself. The world is sad and decayed.
I stood up.

I’m going out to see what it looks like in the town. I haven’t seen it
since the day of the trouble.
She glanced up at me for an instant, surprised. Then she bowed her
head, as if she could not bear to be separated from her obsession. She
remained staring into emptiness while I stood there in front of her.
After a moment she raised her head and focused her eyes on mine.
Did Qaabil pay you for your work last night? she asked me.
No. He hasn’t paid me yet.
Wait a minute. She got up and went into the bedroom. Until now I
had not seen her behave in this serious, adult manner. Today she looks
like Bouchra. It was unusual for her to have mentioned Qaabil’s name
and not have followed it up with an insult. She will say of him: I know
that pimp. I understand that rotten mind.
Surely she has a surprise for me, I thought. What can it be? As I
waited I grew more impatient. She came out carrying three watches in
one hand and two hundred-peseta notes in the other. I stared at the pretty
blue foulard she had just wound around her head. Now she looked like an
ancient Egyptian queen whose picture I had once cut out of a magazine. I
went on looking at her in astonishment.
Here. Take these things. Sell the watches and keep the money you
get for them. But don’t mention it to anybody. And when you sell the
watches be sure Qaabil doesn’t find out about it. Smuggling’s not regular
work, and it doesn’t go on long.
Her way of speaking amazed me. The words I meant to say flew off
before I could say them. I took the watches and the banknotes, and stored
them in various pockets of my jacket and trousers. I looked at the key in
the door, and said: Are you going to lock the door from the inside?
Yes.
I opened the door and went out. After a few steps I turned around.
She was standing in the doorway sobbing and wiping her eyes. I stopped
walking. The feeling came over me that she was saying goodbye to me. I
would have sworn that she was taking leave of me for the last time. I may
never see her again. The girl in Aïn Ketiout, Asiya, Fatima, did I ever
see any of them again once they had gone? I started to walk again. It was

impossible to go back. My eyes filled with tears. I could not stop them
from forming. I was certain that she still stood in the doorway watching
me as I walked away. The force that keeps me from turning around and
going back must be the same force that makes her remain standing in the
doorway, unable to come after me. I am leaving the shack for good. A
part of my life is ending, and another part will begin. Perhaps I shall
never see any of them from the shack again.

11 
I was sitting with Laila Bouwala in her room. Sometimes Lalla
Zehor, the proprietor of the house, served us herself. Ever since I had left
the shack, I had been spending my time drinking. There is a continuous
babble of girls’ voices coming up from downstairs. During the past two
nights I have slept with three of the girls. The only one of those whom I
like is Rachida, who squirms in bed like a snake. Tonight here I am with
Laila Bouwala. Hamid Zailachi told me that sometimes she wets her bed
He says it happened once when he was spending the night with her. I’m
going to stay in her bed all night and see if she does it with me.
She poured what was left of the wine into the two glasses. Are we
going to have another bottle, or will this be enough?
Without reflecting, I said: We’ll order another. And another, and
another, until we’re drunk.
She got up and went to the door. She pulled the curtain aside and
pushed the door, which was ajar. Then she called into the corridor: Lalla
Zehor! Agi! She let go of the curtain and turned back to me.
What’s the matter with you? she said. You look sad. Has something
happened? Or don’t you like being with me?
I looked at her and smiled. I’m not sad. I’m just thinking of
something.
Thinking of what? She sat down smiling and lighted a cigarette,
which she then put between my lips. This made me think of Sallafa. I
studied Laila’s figure. It is fuller and better than Sallafa’s. She has long,
smooth black hair. I intend to spread it over me like a blanket. I
continued to run my eyes over her body.
Why are you staring at me that way? Don’t you like the way I look?
I told you I was thinking of something.
Well, stop thinking about it now. It makes you look sad.
Lalla Zehor spoke outside the door: Here I am.
Come in, Lalla Zehor, Laila told her.
She walked into the room, bringing a strong wave of perfume with
her. I’m here, she said.

Bring us another bottle, said Laila.
I’m going to sleep here with Laila, I told Lalla Zehor. How much is
she?
Just give me sixty pesetas, and it’ll be all right, she said. Nobody
else would get her under a hundred.
I handed her the sixty pesetas, and twenty for the new bottle. A girl
was calling up the stairs: Lalla Zehor!
I’m coming, she answered. And turning to us: What a loud voice that
Rachida has! I’ll send the bottle up by her, or else by Alioua Larossia.
There was the sound of footsteps, and then came two knocks on the
door.
Who is it? cried Lalla Zehor.
I recognized the voice. It’s me. Can I come in?
Lalla Zehor raised the curtain, and Kandoussi walked in.
We’re in luck, Lalla Zehor cried. So it’s you? I feel better just
looking at you. Where have you been all this time? You haven’t been
back to see us in I don’t know how long.
I was surprised to see Kandoussi.
So this is where you’ve been hiding out, he said to me. I’ve been
looking everywhere, trying to find you. Come on. Get up.
But Si Kandoussi, aren’t you going to sit down with us?
Lalla Zehor was always hospitable. At least have something to
drink.
You’ll have to excuse me, he said. I can’t tonight. Some other time,
insha’Allah.
I stood up.
Will you be back? Lalla Zehor asked me.
Of course I’ll be back, I said immediately. Haven’t I already paid
you for the night with Laila?
If the door’s locked, just knock, she said.
Now Laila spoke up. What time are you coming back? I looked at
Kandoussi, and he answered for me: He’ll be back whenever he wants to
come back. If he’s late, go to bed. But by yourself, and not with some
other client.

Laila smiled. Lalla Zehor said to Kandoussi: Don’t worry abou
your friend. I haven’t got seven faces. Just the same face for everyone.
Kandoussi and I went downstairs, leaving Lalla Zehor with Laila
On the way down I asked him: Where’s el Kebdani?
This is not the place to talk, he said. I’ll tell you all about it when
we get outside.
Going through the alleys of Bencharqi we ran into a good many
drunks. From time to time Kandoussi stopped to shake someone’s hand.
He seemed to know great numbers of people, and they all looked glad to
see him and treated him with a special respect. We said nothing to one
another as we walked along. He spoke when we got to the Zoco Chico.
What café do you want to sit in? The Fuentes? The Central? The
Española?
Wherever you like.
We went into the Café Central. Before we sat down we ordered a
cognac and a gin. We chose a free corner. Then he said: But where have
you been? I looked everywhere.
Here in Tangier. Where did you think?
I mean, where do you sleep?
I found a place in the Casbah, in Derb ben Abbou.
Is it the house next to the school?
Exactly. That’s it.
You’re living in a nest of thieves and whores, you know.
But they asked for papers at all the other hotels. And I’ve got
nothing.
Fine. We’ll talk about that later, he said.
The waiter came up and poured our drinks for us. After he had gone
away, Kandoussi resumed talking.
Poor Kebdani. He’s dead.
My eyes and mouth opened wide. Dead? I repeated weakly.
Yes, he said. He’s dead. Allah irhamou. May Allah see to it that we
all die as Moslems.
I emptied my glass and called the waiter. Then I lit a cigarette.
Kandoussi drank what was in his glass.

Another round? the waiter asked.
Bring a full bottle of cognac, I told him.
Right, said Kandoussi. Bring a bottle, and I’ll drink that.
But how did he die? I said.
When he rowed back to the ship it wasn’t there. They’d caught sight
of a Customs boat coming their way, and had to get out. He had to row
ashore. The rowboat must have been thrown against a rock. They found
him and the pieces of the boat lying on the beach. Poor Kebdani!
That was the death written for him, said Kandoussi.
Yes, I said sadly. You’re right. It was written that way. But it’s not
right.
Poor Kebdani.
The waiter brought a bottle of Terry and opened it at the table. He
filled the glasses, set the bottle on the table, and went away.
The only things that can happen are those Allah decides must
happen, said Kandoussi.
And Qaabil?
He’s been arrested.
Arrested? For what?
They’re trying to connect him with Kebdani’s accident. They know
Kebdani worked for him.
Did they take the ship? I asked him.
No. They stopped it and went aboard and searched it.
Then they let it go.
Where’s Qaabil now?
The secret police have him.
What has he told them?
So far he hasn’t admitted to anything.
I finished my glass and refilled it.
You’re going to be drunk fast if you go on like that, he said.
I could drink this whole bottle without moving it from my lips, I
bragged. And I put my hand on the bottle. You want me to show you?
Kandoussi also put his hand on the bottle. No! Don’t be crazy. I
know you could drink it. Tell me: why did you leave the key with

Sallafa?
She asked me for it. Naturally I let her have it. She’s the one who
ran the shack.
I know that. But she’s run away.
Run away?
She took everything she could carry with her out of the place, and
disappeared.
Where to?
How should I know? It’s a safe guess she’s left Tangier.
So she’s gone, I said to myself.
It always ends that way if you let a whore into your life, he said.
And Bouchra? Hasn’t she come back yet?
She must have gone with Sallafa. They’ve never been separated, not
since they were kids down in Dar el Baroud.
They’ve gone together to Casablanca, I thought. I looked out into the
Zoco Chico, full of drunks wandering up and down, and said: Well,
things are back the way they were before the trouble.
Things aren’t good, though, anywhere in Morocco, said Kandoussi.
We’re going to see much bigger trouble than that before too long. They’re
going to be demanding independence.
El Kebdani told me that only six funeral processions went to the
mosque, and everybody knows that dozens were killed.
A lot of bodies are beginning to be washed up along the shore, he
said.
I see. They threw them into the ocean afterwards.
They say that even live people got thrown in, sewn up in sacks. And
some of the dead bodies had no bullets in them or any marks on them.
They found one boy on the beach at Larache, with handcuffs still on his
wrists. But no marks on his body anywhere.
Very bad, I said.
They’ll probably keep coming across bodies for a long time. But
you can never get to the bottom of all that. I have five hundred pesetas for
you. Your wages for the work you did the other night. I was going to pay
you tonight, but I think tomorrow would be better, now that I see how you

are tonight.
Whenever, I said. It doesn’t matter.
I’m going to leave the money with Sidi Mustafa at the Café Raqassa
He’s reliable. Do you know him?
Yes. I go there often.
He’s taking care of me, I thought. He doesn’t want me to spend the
money tonight.
I’ve got something else to say to you.
What’s that?
You’re not to tell anybody that you’ve worked for me. The other
three cargadores who worked with us are all reliable. There’s nothing to
worry about there. But you never know what can happen. If they should
arrest you and begin asking questions, deny everything. They may beat
you, but hold on, and don’t be afraid of them.
Don’t worry about me.
There’s one good thing, at least. You’re not known as a cargador.
Wouldn’t Qaabil tell them everything if they tortured him?
I don’t think he would. But who knows? They’ve certainly tortured
him by now.
Is the stuff in a safe place? I asked him.
We delivered it to the Hindu the same morning.
I nodded my head. I see.
You’d better sleep at your hotel tonight. But look for another place
to stay. I’ll find you a place that won’t cost you more than fifty pesetas a
month.
Who’s staying at the shack now?
Nobody. Sallafa left the key at the baqal Qaabil always used. That
shack is no good to anybody now he’s in jail.
You mean the police are watching it?
They may be.
We got up. The bottle was still half full.
Would it be all right if I took it with me? I asked him.
Take it. But be sure you don’t go back to see Laila.
Do you think I’m crazy? I’m tired. I’m going to sleep.

You’re still young, and Allah’s days are long, said Kandoussi.
I went outside to wait for him while he paid the waiter. He came
out. We shook hands.
Can you get to your hotel all right? he said.
Of course. You think I’m two years old?
Remember. Don’t go back to the whorehouse.
No. I told you, I’m not crazy.
I walked down the Calle del Comercio. In the alleys on each side
there were drunks and whores standing around. It was about twelve
o’clock, and I myself was drunk. I staggered along, feeling well able to
protect myself if anyone should attack me.
On my way up the steps at Djenane el Kaptane I came face to face
with a young man who was very drunk. There was no one else in the
street. He turned as I brushed past him.
Where are you off to, handsome?
What do you care where I’m going?
He put his hand on the bottle I was carrying. Can’t we go and drink
this together?
Take your hand off the bottle, I said. Get out of here.
I stepped aside and started ahead, but he blocked my way. I live
near here. In Derb Zeynana. Come on. We’ll stay together all night.
What do you want of me? I cried angrily.
Why are you so skittish, gazelle? he murmured close to my ear,
trying at the same time to stroke my face.
Get out of here! I shouted. What do you want?
You still don’t know what I want of you? he said, leering. I want
you, that’s all. Come on. Spend the night with me.
I gripped the bottle by its neck. Go and spend the night with your
mother or your sister, I told him.
You’re talking about my mother, you little maricón? he roared.
Insulting my mother? I’ll fix you!
I backed up a bit, and he followed. Then he kicked me in the groin. I
bent forward, clutching myself with both hands, while stars of pain
flashed in front of my eyes. He kicked me again in the same spot. I fell

and rolled down a few steps. The bottle smashed, but I went on holding
the neck in my hand. He kicked again, and I ducked so he would not hit
my face. His foot hit my hand instead. He went on kicking with both feet,
furiously, while I made every effort to see that he did not get my face.
A girl’s voice came from a nearby window: That’s enough! Leave
him alone! Don’t kick him like that. He’s younger than you.
I am trying to grab him by the leg. I duck one of his more vicious
kicks, and at that moment he loses his balance and falls backwards onto
the pavement. I made a great effort and got to my feet. Then I kicked him
in the face.
I heard the girl’s voice again. Stop it! You’re going to kill each
other!
He had his face covered. I went on kicking him. When I was tired of
kicking, I used the broken neck of the bottle on the two hands that were
spread over his face. He was bellowing like a beast. My face! My neck!
I ran on and left him there yelling. The girl’s voice cried: That’s
what you wanted, you two. You’ve finally got it.
I fell several times as I ran up the stairs. Blood ran from my face,
my knees, and from the hand that had held the bottle. I could still hear him
bellowing as I went through the arch of Bab el Assa. I took out my
handkerchief and put it to my nose. Blood was coming from my mouth as
well.
At the entrance of Derb ben Abbou I stumbled on one of the steps
and fell, letting go of the handkerchief as well as the broken neck of the
bottle, which I still had in my hand. It took my last remaining strength to
get to the hotel door. The window was open and the light was on. I called
hoarsely: Zailachi! Come down quick!
From the window above he leaned out. With him were Naima and
Faouziya.
Mohamed! What’s the matter?
Come down.
A moment later the door opened, and he stood there barefoot and
with a knife in his hand. What’s happened?
I wiped the blood from my face with the sleeve of my jacket. I got

into a fight with a drunk, I said. I think he’s still after me.
BouChta leaned out of the window. What is it? he said. I’m coming
down.
Come down fast, you pimp, said Zailachi. Then he said to me: Come
on. Follow me. Was he by himself?
I spat out some blood. Yes. He was alone, the son of a whore.
Hurry up.
I slipped again in the street, trying to follow him. Where the alley
turned he slowed down. Then he stopped, and peered cautiously around
the corner. After that he began to run again, and stopped only at the
entrance to the Place de la Casbah.
Where was he?
On the stairs of Djenane el Kaptane, I said.
BouChta caught up with us. He too was barefoot, and he carried a
club.
We did not find him. The same girl was still in the window. He’s
gone, she said. And you go away too. Be sensible. Do you want to wake
up the whole neighbourhood?
She was right. Already a good many men and women were leaning
out of the windows and bending over the balcony railings, to see what
was going on. There was a pool of blood in the place where I had left
him. We followed the trail of blood down the steps for several metres,
until it suddenly ended.
Where’d he go? mused Zailachi.
Come on. Let’s go back. He’s gone, I said.
Lucky for him he got away.
Going back up to the hotel I told them the whole story, from the
moment he had blocked my passage to the point when I cut him with the
bottle and began to run.
BouChta walked along beside us, saying nothing. I knew he was the
sort who would not even dare disturb a sitting hen, but in spite of that, his
presence made us feel better, more ready to deal with whatever trouble
might present itself.
Do you know that girl who was talking in the window? Zailachi

asked me.
No, I said. Who is she?
Her name is Fatiha Cherifa. Her husband was a policeman who got
tuberculosis and tried to cure himself at home. He had a friend who used
to go and visit him, and it seems the friend used to smoke kif and get
drunk with the policeman’s wife. Sometimes the man with tuberculosis
would take a chance and smoke and drink with them, and half the time
ended up vomiting blood. I think he knew his wife was playing with the
other man, but he was patient. One night they drank more than usual, and
the friend began to pay attention to her right in front of him. He went at
the friend with a knife, but the friend pulled out his pistol and shot him.
He stopped talking.
Did it kill him? I asked.
He died when he got to the hospital.
What about her? What did they do to her?
What would they do? They questioned her and let her go.
BouChta spoke up. When women and love get mixed up, the story is
always dirty.
She’s got two baby girls, said Zailachi. The Missionaries adopted
her when she was little, and made a nurse out of her. She speaks three
foreign languages. But her greatest talent is right between her legs, like
all other women.
Naima Mesrara and Faouziya Achaqa were leaning out of the
window above our heads. Naima, open the door, said Zailachi.
Push on it. It’s open.
There was talking and laughing inside. On the second and third
floors some of the roomers were still up and around. The night-watchman
came out of one of the second-floor rooms, a cigarette hanging from his
lips. He must have been having a drink with the people who lived in that
room.
Everything all right? he asked us.
Zailachi said: Yes.
We went upstairs, and he stood looking after us. Our room had been
a very large one. The proprietor had made three rooms out of it by

erecting partitions. It was my section where everyone liked to gather at
night. They sat there even when I was not at home, because it was the
only one of the three rooms that had a window in it. The window looked
out into the alley of Derb ben Abbou.
Faouziya, go down to the kitchen and put some water on to boil,
said BouChta. At that moment Zailachi noticed the rip in my trousers at
the knee.
Come into the other room with me, he told me.
We went into his room. He took a pair of flannel trousers from his
bag and held them out to me. Wait until Faouziya comes and washes your
cuts, he said.
I told him to bring me a glass of cognac. He went back into my
room. The door into the corridor opened, and Faouziya came in carrying
the tea-kettle.
Here’s the cognac, said Naima.
Take off your clothes to wash, Faouziya told me. Are you afraid of
us?
I took my jacket and trousers off in front of them both, and stood in
my underwear. My left elbow was skinned and bleeding. I let the two
girls rub my wounds with hot water and cognac.
Zailachi was busy opening another bottle of cognac. Suddenly there
was a loud knocking on the door. I started to get up to open it. The girls
had finished taking care of me.
Stay where you are, said Zailachi. He set down the bottle and rose.
The knocking went on, very loud.
Who is it? said Zailachi.
A hoarse voice cried: Open the door!
Naima and Faouziya grew pale. The police! murmured Naima. Only
the police knock like that. They’re the only ones who ever pound that
way.
Hide the bottle somewhere, said BouChta.
I was sitting on the couch. I reached out and took the bottle. I sat
there holding it. Then I got up and looked out of the window. Two
policemen in uniform stood in front of the entrance door downstairs.

Zailachi opened the door, and we saw two secret policemen
standing there.
What took you so long? Why didn’t you open up? one of them said.
Well, say something.
He slapped Zailachi. The two came into the room. I still held the
bottle in my hand.
Girls and liquor, is that it? Give me that bottle.
I handed it to him. He looked at it.
So you drink Terry, do you? Your papers.
I have no papers.
He turned to BouChta. And you?
BouChta took out his identity card and handed it to him. The man
glanced at it and slipped it into his pocket. Then he turned to the two girls
and said: Put on your djellabas. Quick!
The other one handcuffed Zailachi and me together.
We all went downstairs to the first floor, where we found three
young men and two girls with another secret policeman. Two of the
young men were handcuffed together, and the third had them hanging from
one hand. The officer shut the open handcuff on BouChta’s wrist. The
four girls walked out first and the rest of us followed. When we were
outside, the police pointed in the direction of the Place de la Casbah,
saying: That way.
Two of the youths were whispering behind us. No talking! yelled a
policeman.
There were two jeeps in the Place de la Casbah. The girls got into
one, and we got into the other.
They’ve caught a lot of game this time, I thought.
We were sitting very close together in the jeep. When we got to the
Souq ez Zra, the other car continued down towards the Zoco de Fuera
Ours stopped there at the Brigada Criminal. There in an office they
searched us one by one, taking away our belts, shoestrings and money.
All they left us was our cigarettes and matches. One of the three other
youths had a small knife in his pocket.
What’s this supposed to be for? asked the policeman who was

searching him. No? All right, we’ll see about that later.
After they had taken down our names they turned us over to a man
with keys in his hand. Zailachi and I followed him down a narrow
corridor until he stopped in front of a door. As he was opening it, one of
the men who had brought us in the jeep came up. He pushed us through a
doorway into a room where a light bulb hung down from the ceiling.
Three other prisoners sat in the room, but one of them was asleep. The
policeman unfastened the handcuffs, stepped outside, and slammed the
door.
Everything they do here is part of the punishment, I thought. My left
wrist hurt a little, and I rubbed it. I looked at the door that was reinforced
with metal plates, and reflected that this door was stronger than any of
the doors that had shut me in before. The doors are getting tighter. Here I
am, finally, in a real prison. Zailachi sat down on the floor with his arms
on his knees. Sit down, he said.
I sat beside him facing the two young men who were awake. The
floor was cold as ice. Great spots of dampness covered the walls and
ceiling. In one corner of the room was a latrine hole with a water tap
directly above it. Whatever they give you here they give in a way that
makes it all a part of the punishment, I thought. I glanced at the hole in the
corner. The stench that came up from it made me feel sick to my stomach.
Zailachi brought out a pack of cigarettes and passed it around. The one
who was sleeping sat bent over with his head resting on his folded arms.
Zailachi pointed in his direction. What’s the matter with him? he
asked the others.
He’s drunk.
He’s better off like that, in this cold, said Zailachi.
The two young men were shivering.
How long have you been in here? Zailachi asked them.
The same one who had spoken before answered now. They arrested
us this afternoon. We were playing cards in the Café Debbou.
The other one smoked silently, looked at the floor. He raised his
head only to take a long pull on his cigarette from time to time. Then
later, his head down, he would exhale, and the smoke would look like

someone’s breath on a cold morning.

12 
By the time morning came, we were all shivering with the cold.
Each time one of us got up to use the latrine the others crouched further
forward, staring at the floor. And the smell grew worse. The young man
who had been asleep during the night drank a great deal of water, the
same as Zailachi and I. It was the great thirst of the morning after
drinking. Zailachi stood up and began to do exercises. He was in a good
mood.
Get up and do this if you want to get warm, he told me.
No, I said.
Each time he made a vigorous gesture the others glanced up. I
watched him during the entire time he did his gymnastics.
Get up! he said. What’s the matter with you? There’s nothing better
if you want to stop feeling the cold.
The cuts on my knee and my elbow hurt. They’ll begin to bleed
again if I start doing that.
He did not say any more. He was beginning to pant, and his motions
were growing slower. He walked over to the latrine hole and spat into it.
He turned on the water tap and washed his hands and face, wetting his
hair and smoothing it back. He squatted, urinated, washed his sex, and
then washed the hand that had washed the sex. He drank a little more
water and came back to sit in his place on the floor with his hands on his
knees. Drops of water ran from his chin and from the tips of his fingers.
He bent his head forward. Little by little he began to breathe normally.
Then he raised his head towards me. We looked at each other smiling for
a moment, and then he burst out laughing. This made me laugh too.
The sons of whores! he said. They caught us the way a cat catches a
mouse.
Where do you think they’ve taken the girls? I said.
The Zoco Chico police station. Where else would they take them?
Do you think it will be a morals charge? I asked him.
I don’t believe so. We weren’t making any trouble. They found us
drinking with two whores, that’s all.

How many days do you think they’ll keep us here?
Not later than Monday or Tuesday, he said. Today’s Saturday. After
a pause he went on: You’re lucky. BouChta too. He’s just a tailor.
I’m lucky? I cried, astonished.
Yes. You’ve never been convicted of anything. You’ve never been
in jail. But I have, and they may accuse me of a new robbery or
something.
I wonder why they didn’t put BouChta in here with us, I said.
They just didn’t happen to. I don’t think there’s any reason. They’ll
let him out too on Monday or Tuesday.
You think they’re going to let BouChta and me off that easily?
You’ll see, he said.
And Naima and Faouziya? I said after a moment.
They’ll be out drinking and whoring again on Monday or Tuesday.
The worst that can happen to them is that they might make them go into a
whorehouse to work, where they can give them a medical examination
every week. Anyway, I think BouChta and Faouziya will be getting
married as soon as they get out of here.
You mean he’s in love with her?
I don’t know. But he wants to live with her.
And you?
What do you mean, and me?
I mean you and Naima, I said.
He put his forefinger to his temple and drew circles with it. Are you
out of your mind? She’s like every other whore I ever knew. I didn’t
come into this world to marry a whore.
I heard the sound of footsteps close by, outside the door. We all
turned in that direction. The little square window in the middle of the
door opened. Then the door swung inward rapidly, making a great noise.
They do it that way to scare us, I thought. Even the way they open
the door is part of the punishment.
Two old men came in, one of them carrying a large tea-kettle and a
basket full of metal mugs to drink out of, and the other a white canvas
sack. They said good morning. Behind them in the corridor stood two

guards. They gave each of us a loaf of bread and a mug of tea.
You’ve got fifteen minutes before they take out the mugs, said one of
the guards.
The two old men went out and the guards shut the door. The little
window remained open. Both the tea and the bread were hot. We ate and
drank without speaking.
Leave half your bread for the afternoon, Zailachi advised me. They
won’t bring anything around again until this time tomorrow.
I nodded my head. After we had finished, Zailachi pulled out a
cigarette and passed it to the others. He and I shared a second cigarette
between us. I noticed that the two youths who had been arrested in the
Café Debbou left none of their bread for later. The third one, like
Zailachi and me, saved the greater part of his. Always when I have drunk
and smoked a great deal, the following day thirst takes the place of
appetite.
We continued to smoke in silence, sipping what was left of the tea.
My body had begun to glow with warmth. The little window stayed open.
It may be because of the window that we remain so quiet. What would
life be like, I wondered, if all of it had to be spent sitting like this here in
this room? We would all have to exist only in our memories, acting out
the parts we play here until we were so bored by both them and the
memories that we came to rest in a silence like this one. We would
disappear one by one, until all of us were gone, and the unluckiest of us
would be the one who disappeared last. I prefer to be with people, even
though they may be my enemies. I would rather be shut up in a place like
this with others than be free and solitary. It would be better to be the first
rather than the last to disappear.
The door opened, and the old man who had brought the tea came in.
A guard stood behind him watching us. We finished off the last drops
quickly, and dropped the mugs into the old man’s basket, on top of those
that were already there, and we thanked him.
May Allah forgive you and us both, he said.
Some of us answered: Amin.
The guard slammed shut both the little window and the door. The

violent sounds were no longer producing their effect. I had become
indifferent to them. With time I should not even notice them, and perhaps
not even notice the fact that I was shut into a room. But I am still not used
to solitude.
Zailachi took out a small pencil and set to work writing on the wall.
What are you writing? I asked him.
I’m writing two lines of a poem by Abou el Qacem Chabbi. He was
from Tunis.
And what did he say?
Here’s what he says:
If some day the people decide to live, fate must bend to that desire
There will be no more night when the chains have broken.
Do you understand?
No, but it’s magnificent. What does it mean?
He’s talking about the desire to live.
And what does the desire to live mean?
It means that if a man or a country is enslaved and decides to try and
get free, Allah will help. He says: the dawn will respond and the chains
will break because men will make it happen.
I see.
Abou el Qacem Chabbi was a great poet, he said. The others were
listening attentively.
You’re lucky, I said to Zailachi.
Lucky? Me? He was surprised.
Yes. You’re lucky.
Why?
Because you know how to read and write.
So I can read and write, he said. What good is it? Here I am in this
room. Who knows what they’re going to accuse me of? Things I’ve done?
Things I haven’t done?
He began again to write on the wall, asking me at the same time as
he formed the first letter: What’s this?
I don’t know.
It’s alif, he said. Then he made another letter. And this?

I don’t know. What is it?
That’s ba. And this?
Tsa, I said.
How do you happen to know that one?
Because I’ve always heard people say: alif, el ba, et tsa. And I
repeated with him the reading of the three letters.
We can make words out of these three letters, like aboun, baboun,
bata, taba.
He stepped away from the wall. Some day I’ll teach you to read and
write, he said. You could learn easily.
Do you think it’s easy?
Why not? Aren’t you a man?
I asked him to repeat the verses by the Tunisian poet several times,
until I had learned them by heart.
During the afternoon the young man who had been asleep the night
before began to pace restlessly, from one end of the room to the other.
The rest of us sat quietly, watching him. At one point he seized the piece
of bread he had saved from the morning, walked over to the latrine, and
crumbled it in his hands, dropping the pieces down the hole. I looked at
Zailachi.
It’s his business, he whispered. Let him do what he likes with the
bread.
The other two glared angrily at the youth. It seemed to me that if he
made one more move, there might easily be a fight.
Why’d you throw the bread down the hole? one of them demanded.
I can do what I want with my bread, he said, glowering.
But you threw away bread, en neama d’Allah!
I tell you I’m free! the other cried.
You’re a pile of shit!
I’m free to do as I like with my bread, and with myself, too!
Yes, but do it when you’re alone.
Suddenly the young man began to pound the wall with his fists, and
soon he was butting it with his head. After a few blows he slid to the
floor unconscious, his hands and forehead running with blood. Zailachi

rose and knocked loudly on the door. The little window opened and a
guard said: What is it?
Somebody hurt himself, Zailachi said. He came back and sat down.
That’s all we can do, he whispered.
The young man who had been objecting now said: That’s what he
gets for doing what he did.
The door opened and two secret policemen entered, accompanied
by the uniformed guard. What’s going on in here?
He crumbled up his bread and threw it down the latrine, Zailachi
said. And then he started to hit the wall.
And before that, what happened? asked the other secret policeman.
Nothing.
You didn’t quarrel first?
Zailachi looked around at all of us.
No, he said. Ask him when he comes to.
One of the policemen walked over and examined the blood stains on
the wall. We’ll see later whether there wasn’t some sort of trouble here
before he began to hit himself, he said.
The youth lay quite still, with the blood coming out slowly from his
cuts. The men went out and shut the door, leaving the window open.
A quarter of an hour later they came back, bringing two attendants
with a stretcher. They lifted the young man onto the canvas and carried
him out, still unconscious. There were puddles and smears of blood
where he had lain. Again the door shut and the window remained open.
There must be something the matter with him, I said.
Let him do what he likes, said Zailachi. He’s either an alcoholic or
he smokes too much kif.
The young man who had been critical added: Or Allah has put a
curse on him. Or his father has.
Of course, said the other. You get punished for whatever you do.
We were silent. Our cigarettes had given out. The butts we had
thrown away were extremely short. I picked one up, however, and
smoked it.
We awoke Monday morning completely exhausted. The two others

merely sat, bent over, and Zailachi did not do his morning exercises. In
spite of the ugly grey pallor his dark skin had taken on as a result of
hunger, he seemed in better condition than the rest of us. I felt only like
vomiting, and I was certain that I should, if anyone used the latrine. I
thought of that noon I had spent on the docks, when the idea of bread
mixed with excrement first flowered in my mind.
The guard threw open the door and called out my name. I stood up,
and found that I was dizzy and that my knees were trembling. I said
goodbye, even though I had no idea whether I was going to be let out or
not. I went along with the guard, and as I climbed the stairs my laceless
shoes flapped. Being out of that hateful cell was like being half-free. We
went into a room where a large camera was set up in the centre, with a
chair in front of it. The guard withdrew, and the photographer told me to
sit down. The room was heated. To remember the cell was like
remembering being shut into a refrigerator. The man came over to me and
arranged my pose. Then he went behind the camera and told me to look
into the lens. He took one full-face picture and two profiles. This must be
for their records, I thought. He asked my name, and showed me how to
push my fingers, one by one, onto the ink-pad and make their marks on a
piece of white paper.
A secret policeman entered and began to speak in French and
Spanish with the photographer, who was a Moroccan. When the work
was finished, the photographer ran his eyes over the paper and asked me
if I knew how to sign it. I said no.
Most of them are like that, said the policeman.
Of course, the photographer said.
Next they asked me to push my thumb again into the ink-pad, and
make my sign with it at the bottom of the paper. I did not dare ask them
what was written on the paper, but I did tell them that I had done nothing.
I have nothing to do with that, said the photographer. Now go down
and report to the guard who brought you up here.
Then the secret policeman, speaking in Spanish, asked me what kind
of work I did. I told him I had no work.
And so what do you live on, if you have no work?

I don’t know. I just live. I do whatever work I can find, wherever I
find it.
I see, he said. Well, go on downstairs.
I left them talking together, and went out, shuffling in my open shoes.
On the floor below I looked in vain for the guard. I stood in the corridor,
with the door into the street open before me. I could see the people going
past. Two men dressed in civilian clothes entered and walked in front of
me. Secret policemen, I supposed. Zailachi was right when he said they
would release me on Monday or Tuesday. It looks as if it were going to
be today. A guard came out of an office.
Have you finished with the photographer? he asked me.
Yes.
Come with me. He took me into his office. There were two other
men inside, both dressed in civilian clothes. They had me put my thumb-
print on another sheet of paper covered with words. I told them my name
and they gave me back my money, belt and shoelaces.
I wondered what they had written about me on this piece of paper.
They can write whatever they want, since I have no idea what the ink
marks mean. Nor do I dare ask them to bring someone who will read it to
me before I sign it.
Get out of here, said one of the secret policemen.
I turned and stepped out of the office, having completely forgotten
my fatigue and my nausea. As I went through the doorway I ran into a man
wearing civilian clothing, and excused myself. He shoved me violently
aside, so that I hit the wall.
Look where you’re going, you halfwit! he said. He went on, and I
stooped to pick up one of my shoes, which had fallen off.
He must be a policeman. Only a policeman could behave like that.
When I got into the street I put the laces into my shoes and attached
my belt to my trousers. It was a clear cold day with a bright sun
overhead, and I breathed deeply as I walked along.
I went into Harouch’s restaurant in the Zoco de Fuera. He sold bean
soup. I was thinking about the money Kandoussi had said he would leave
for me with the owner of the Café Raqassa. And I also was casting about

in my head for an idea for some sort of work. I must find a new way to
live.

13 
The alarm clock began to ring. I reached out into the darkness and
shut it off. Then I got up and turned on the light. It was five o’clock. I
could feel sleep still hanging there deliciously close, just inside my eyes.
The boat will come into port in an hour, I was thinking. I glanced at
Naima. She was sleeping quietly. I hate to live with a girl who never
works. All she ever has to do is open her legs, to me or someone else.
Does she expect me to marry her, the way BouChta did Faouziya? I
haven’t gone that crazy yet.
I dressed rapidly, picked up the market basket, and snapped off the
light. Then I went softly out of the room. Downstairs I washed my face in
water that was like melted snow. I was careful when I woke the night-
watchman. He began to pummel the air with his fists, as he always did
when anyone woke him, and then he stared wildly at me, saying nothing.
Abdeslam! I said. It’s Choukri. I want to go out.
He gave a great sigh and got wearily out of bed. I followed him to
the front door of the hotel. As I went out, he said: May Allah be kind to
you this morning. I nodded at him and went down the silent alley. The
day was violet-coloured now. The signs of poverty, blotted out by night,
were becoming visible once again. The lucky ones are at home in bed at
this hour. They don’t get up to work. They lie there, comfortable as
excrement enfolded in the belly. There are many things for them to rely
upon: Allah, their own personalities, love, power. But I can rely only
upon my own health and the fact that I am young.
I stopped just inside Bab el Assa and looked out over the harbour. I
could see that the water was rough.
When I got down to the waterfront I found Boussouf standing by a
kiosk having a bowl of bean soup. I said hello, and ordered a bowl for
myself. Between us we arranged the price. He would do the work for me
for 3,000 francs.
I heard yesterday that the steerage is going to be full of Jews on
their way to Palestine, said Boussouf.
I’m more interested in the French and Senegalese soldiers on their

way to Algeria, I told him. They don’t bargain so much. But Jews! Mos
of them are businessmen themselves. Even the ones who aren’t know just
how much everything is worth.
But they’re leaving Morocco for good, and they’ll be sure to want
souvenirs from the last port of call.
We’ll see.
We walked out onto the breakwater and got into the rowboat. He
began to row slowly. Watching the oars cut the water put me in mind of
the time when I had been working in the vineyard at Oran with the old
man, I ploughing the earth, he yelling and scolding. Come on! Watch
where you’re going! To the left, you good-for-nothing Riffian! Come on!
You’re still half asleep! I’m going to get Monsieur Segundi to put you in
the kitchen peeling potatoes. Hit the mule harder! That’s all you’re good
for, peeling potatoes and washing dishes.
It was at this hour that we used to go out into the vineyards to work.
The old man complained without stopping, and the sound of his voice
made my hands tighten on the reins. If it had not been for my attack on the
beautiful boy in the field, I should still be there working. I remembered
my mother’s face, my aunt’s face. I now understand why my aunt treated
me with such tenderness. She had no children of her own. And I believe
it was her husband who made her send me home in order to avoid
possible trouble.
Look! said Boussouf. The ship’s coming into the harbour.
I’m looking, I said.
He stopped rowing, pulled one oar out of the water, and dropped
the oarlock into a hole beside the plank where I sat. We began to row
together.
The ship’s full of soldiers, he said.
As we drew near the side of the ship a Frenchman in uniform called
down to us: Hé! Qu’est-ce que tu as là-dedans?
I signalled to him to wait a minute. Boussouf pulled out the coil of
rope and got it ready to throw.
Catch it! I shouted.
Several hands reached out to grab the end of the rope, which was

weighted with knots. Boussouf tossed up the coil with force, and a black
soldier caught it.
Tie it tight! I called to him in French.
Come on. Climb up! cried several soldiers.
I started to climb up the rope, hand over hand.
That’s right! Keep it up! Bravo! Good! shouted the voices. A
Senegalese soldier helped me onto the deck. Boussouf had tied the basket
onto the tail end of the rope once I was aboard. I leaned over the railing
and began to pull it up. Another black soldier approached me and said:
What have you got for sale, brother?
Without turning my head towards him I answered: Swiss watches,
shawls, Japanese handkerchiefs and cigarette-lighters.
It was a French soldier who helped me get the basket over the
railing and onto the deck. Allez! Laisse voir ce que tu as là-dedans.
I took out the carton of watches, leaving everything else in the
basket. Here are the watches, I told them.
How much is this one?
Five thousand francs.
It’s not a fake?
What do you mean? I don’t sell fake watches.
Three thousand.
Four thousand, I said.
No, no! I’ll give you three thousand.
Take it. It’s yours. I was thinking: If one of them buys something,
they’ll all begin.
The watches were disappearing from my hands one after the other,
and my pockets were filling up with banknotes. Suddenly a soldier
appeared and planted himself in front of me. Give me back my money, he
said.
If I do that, I thought, they’ll all start asking for their money back. I
can’t.
Why? I asked him.
They say your watches are no good.
Listen, I told him. Whoever told you that didn’t have enough money

to buy a watch, that’s all.
Are you going to give me back my money?
You picked out the watch yourself. Nobody made you buy it.
Dozens of pairs of eyes were staring doubtfully at me. I heard
throats being cleared. The blond French soldier spoke: Mine’s all right.
I’m going to keep mine.
I went quietly down to the steerage deck where the Jews were
travelling. It smelled of mildew and vomit.
What have you got, boy? asked a Jewish woman in a tired voice.
Japanese shawls and handkerchiefs, I told her.
Several other women gathered around me. Let’s see what you’ve got
in your basket, the first one said.
What a pretty colour that one is! a girl exclaimed to a woman who
was probably her mother. How much is this?
A thousand francs.
Seven hundred.
I was thinking: I’ve got to sell everything fast and get out of here.
A pot-bellied old man with a pointed grey beard suddenly cried:
It’s cheap material! Wash it once and the whole thing is gone. No more
colour.
The woman beside him turned to him. What do you know about it?
she cried. These things are for women.
I know the stuff, the old man said. The Hindus sell it wholesale all
over Tangier.
It’s always hard to sell to old people, I kept telling myself. They
always pride themselves on knowing everything.
The Jewish women around me went on buying, without paying any
more attention to the old man. From time to time he cried at them: You’re
crazy! You’re buying the worst quality! The lowest!
The shawls and scarves were disappearing, but the sharp smell of
the vomit was still there in my nostrils. There was a sudden jolt and the
boat stopped moving. I pocketed the money for the last handkerchief and
began working my way through the shouting women. Bring more stuff!
they were crying.

As I came up on deck a Senegalese soldier some distance away
caught sight of me and began to call out: Hey, you! Wait for me there!
He probably wants me to take back the watch I sold him, I thought. I
hurried through the crowd to the other end of the deck.
There was a circle of soldiers around Rami. That drunken brute,
who practically never gets out of his bed, must be selling them watches
for half the price I charged. I went over to him.
You’re the same old pimp, aren’t you? I said.
Who do you think you’re talking to?
You. Who did you think I was talking to?
Wait till we’re in town. I’ll show you, he said.
I’ll spit up your ass-hole, I told him.
I could see Boussouf rowing rapidly towards the ship. I waited until
he was below, and tossed the basket into the rowboat. Then I began to
climb down the rope, letting myself slide as I went. The rope took the
skin off the palms of my hands. As I went, the taut end of the rope above
me was suddenly cut, and I fell the rest of the way, landing in the middle
of the rowboat.
Pftu! cried Boussouf. This is no way to earn money. You want to
break the boat?
That Senegalese son of a whore must have cut the rope, I said.
To hell with this fucking work, he went on angrily.
Row hard, I told him. They may throw things at us. It wouldn’t be
the first time. I know those soldiers, the sons of whores!
Look out! shouted Boussouf. He and I both ducked as a beer bottle
came down at us.
Take one of the floorboards and ward them off, he told me.
I did what he suggested.
The black man was screaming insults after us, and squeezing an
invisible neck between his two hands. It was as if I could feel him
strangling me. Then two bottles came at once, and I parried them with the
floorboard.
Ow! My hand! Inaal dinhoum! I threw the board far from the
rowboat, and began to lick and suck my wound. It was a wound that

pleased me. Not for a long time had I so enjoyed watching my blood run
out. And the mixture of salt and sweet is pleasant in my mouth. But I
began to feel painful pricklings in the spot on my hip where I had landed.
Boussouf stopped rowing. We were far enough away from the ship now.
He stood up, seized his crotch, and waved it wildly at those standing by
the rail.
What’s that for? I said. Who’s interested in what you’re doing now?
The current’s against us.
We began to row together.
After a moment he said: But what did you do to them?
Nothing. It’s all Rami’s fault.
And what did he do?
He always sells his watches at half price. The next time I see him in
town I’m going to piss on him.
You didn’t talk about the war in Algeria?
Of course not. Are you crazy?
And with the Jews?
No, no. Nothing. What would I tell them? Should I tell the French
and Senegalese soldiers not to go to Algeria and fight? Or tell the Jews
not to emigrate to Palestine?
The tide and the current were very strong, and the wind was coming
up. Suddenly Boussouf’s oar cracked in half. Only the handle remained.
Now we’re in trouble, I said.
Pfu! All this for your three thousand francs! he cried.
It’s not my fault.
The waves had begun to spill into the boat.
Listen, I said. You take care of bailing it out. I’ll tie the other oar at
the stern and try to steer.
The current is taking us towards El Menar. We’ll hit the rocks there
unless we’re lucky.
We’ll take care of that when we get near the shore, I said.
My whole life depends on this boat, Boussouf declared.
The current’s not going to take us any farther than Villa Harris, I
told him.

You’re trying to tell me what the current will do around here? You
don’t know anything about it. But tell me this. How much are you going to
pay me if my boat gets smashed up?
We’ll try not to let that happen, I said.
I want to know now. How much are you going to give me?
I’ll give you twice as much as we agreed on.
What? Six thousand francs?
That’s right.
And for six thousand francs –
The boat tipped violently, and he fell over backwards. Quickly I
brought the oar-handle down on his left shoulder, and then on his right
one.
You damned coward! he roared.
Shut up, or I’ll throw you in.
You’ll see later.
I cupped my groin in my hand and shook the mass at him.
You’ll suck this for me! I cried.
He lay back on the seat-board of the prow, without trying to get up
again. I busied myself taking off my belt, and started to attach it to the
oarlock at the stern. At that moment he came at me with the oar-handle. I
ducked, and the oar slipped out of his hands onto the floor of the boat.
We grappled, and I kneed him in the groin. Then I pushed him
backwards.
I grabbed the oar-handle, and he began to yell: No! No! His eyes
looked as though they would pop out of his head, and his face had turned
very pale.
Sit still, or you go into the water, I told him.
The oar I had been trying to fix to the stern was now floating far
behind us. Keeping the oar-handle in one hand, I began to scoop out the
water with an oil can. The boat was turning round and round as it went
along on the current. After a moment I tossed the can at him.
It’s your turn now.
He took the can and set to work silently bailing out the water. I
thought of Naima. Perhaps she is still asleep. She’s up there dreaming

while I’m here fighting with this bear. I don’t know why I keep her with
me. It’s not love, that’s certain. It may be just habit. Perhaps it’s merely
her indifference. She has no blisters on her palms, no beer bottle has hit
her hand, she does not know the sweet salt taste of her blood in her
mouth. When she wakes up she will wash and go downstairs in her
nightgown to talk with the night-watchman or the proprietor. If one of the
clients of the hotel invites her into his room I think she is not likely to
refuse. She once said: The only excuse for love is marriage. I replied:
I’m afraid marriage would mean the end of love. What keeps us together
is the fact that neither of us belongs completely to the other. Thus there is
always that element of uncertainty between us.
We were drifting nearer to the beach at Villa Harris. The waves
rise and crash before rolling onto the shore. The water is full of sand.
Fishermen have often assured me that sharks never go near cloudy water.
We got ready to jump out. I was the first overboard. I swam underwater
for as long as I could hold my breath. Then I raised my head above the
water and turned. Boussouf was coming close behind me. The waves
would raise me very high, and then let me drop straight down, into what
seemed like an abyss. I’m carrying my death on my shoulders now, I
thought. Once I had gone to visit my friend Manolo in the hospital, and he
had cried out: Oh, my God! Take me out of this suffering! He had tried to
commit suicide, because he had a fatal disease of the lungs. But the nuns
in the hospital had managed to keep him alive.
I swallowed some water, and for an instant began to dog-paddle, as
if I were swimming in a well. I got my breath back, and explored the
bottom to see how deep it was. My feet touched the sand, and I stood up.
A wave pounded over me. I swallowed more water. Then I ran up onto
the beach.
Stand up! I yelled to Boussouf. It’s shallow! I did not know whether
he had heard me or not. He kept swimming until he had landed on the
beach. The boat was grounded a good way down the shore.
Boussouf stood up, looked first at the boat and then at me, frowning.
He’s looking at me now as if I were a lamb he was getting ready to roast.
If I let myself be afraid of him, it’ll be the end of me. If he beats me up

he’ll take everything I’ve got on me. He’ll go off and leave me here
naked.
He came nearer, and I backed up. Let’s go and see how the boat is, I
said.
He began to walk along the beach, a few steps ahead of me. The
boat was touching the sand and moving with the waves. We worked a
while trying to pull it further up onto the sand. It was hard work.
When we had finished, he stood looking down at it. There must be
some broken places, he said.
Where? I don’t see any.
I know! he cried. I know my boat!
What’s the matter now? I said.
This is going to cost you ten thousand francs!
Why should it cost ten thousand francs?
Are you going to pay me or not?
No, I’m not. I told you I’d give you six thousand.
All right!
His fist hit the left side of my face, and bright lights exploded in my
eyes. I backed up a few steps so as not to fall. Then he attacked like a
bull. If I let him get hold of me, he’s going to break my ribs, I thought,
jumping out of his way, so that his attack ended in a clumsy swinging at
the air. It had suddenly begun to rain, and it rained harder each second.
Come here, you son of a whore! he bellowed. Do you think you’re
going to catch me off my guard now? Like you did in the boat? Come on!
I kept ducking his lunges, and he continued to follow me along,
shouting and gesticulating. I mustn’t waste my energy, I thought. I’ve got
to let him be the one to do the attacking.
He had begun to laugh and make gestures to entice me nearer to him,
so that we would fight hand to hand. You’re a coward! he yelled. But
who’s going to help you now?
I did not answer.
Suddenly he sprang forward and grabbed my hips. I seized his neck
between my hands. Then I brought my right knee fast up to his face. He
raised his head. I began to pummel his face. Suddenly he yelled and bent

down. Then he fell over, holding his foot with both hands. The blood ran
not only from his nose, but also from the under part of his foot. Then I
saw something that glistened. It was a broken bottle buried in the sand,
like an artichoke. The cut was very deep. I have no idea why it made me
happy to see the blood being absorbed by the sand in the pouring rain. It
made me feel that the rain itself was the sky bleeding. I thought of the
sheep whose throat they had cut, back in the Rif, when they had filled a
bowl with its blood and made my mother drink it. I counted out 6,000
francs in wet bills, folded them, and tossed them onto the sand beside
Boussouf. Then I turned and walked away. Behind me I heard him crying:
Come back here, you son of a whore! Come back here and I’ll spit up
your ass!
As I got to the highway, I saw the bus from El Menar coming. I
began to wave, and it stopped. The rear door opened. I got in and handed
a wet 1,000-franc bill to the conductor.
What’s the matter? he said. What happened to you?
No. Everything’s all right, I said.
The passengers turned to stare at me as I went forward along the
aisle. There were only seven or eight of them. I looked out of the window
towards the beach. There he is, only now limping towards the rowboat.
After I got off the bus in the Zoco de Fuera I noticed many people
staring at me. Two women walking under one tiny umbrella behind me
were discussing me. One turned to the other. That poor boy, she said.
And the other replied: Yes. What do you suppose could have happened to
him?
They don’t know anything, I thought. All they know is how to be
sorry for people and say hard luck.
At the hotel I found the watchman in the sala, joking with the
cleaning woman as she scrubbed the floor. She dropped her rag, and they
both turned to ask me what had happened to me.
I’m all right, I said, and I went upstairs. The door of my room was
open. My things were not in their regular places. The whore who’s the
daughter of a whore has played a good hand. Everything of any value is
gone: my transistor, my alarm clock, five wrist-watches and a dozen

cigarette-lighters.
I went downstairs to the sala. You didn’t see Naima when she went
out, did you? I asked.
No. Why, is something wrong?
No, nothing, I said. But I think she’s gone for good, and without
telling me goodbye.
But nothing happened?
I shook my head. Nothing’s happened. Then I went back upstairs to
change my clothes. At least she left my clothes behind. Now she’ll
probably begin a new life with another lover somewhere, just as she did
with Hamid Zailachi and others long before that. Only a filthy whore like
her could have done this. And yet, maybe it is just as well. Now I am
forced to find a new pattern in my life, this one being finished.
That afternoon I went to the Café Moh. I had an Egyptian movie
magazine with me, full of photographs of Arab actors and singers. I was
in the habit of buying three or four of these publications each week, to
look at the pictures of film stars wearing Oriental costumes. Sometimes I
masturbated in front of the sexier dancing girls. Hamid Zailachi’s brother
Abdelmalek would read me the captions when he felt in the mood. He
had left his studies in Tetuan and come to Tangier, where he did nothing
but smoke kif, eat majoun, drink wine, and look for whores and
occasional boys. All the other men I knew in the café were illiterate. One
of them could write his name, but with great difficulty. We all considered
Abdelmalek the most important habitué of the café. He reads the Arabic
periodicals to us in a strong, clear voice. If an article deals with the
politics of an Arab country, the owner of the café shuts off the radio, and
everyone listens intently. Sometimes he would stand up, lay aside the
magazine or newspaper, and launch into a speech, merely to show off his
learning. I noticed that he constantly quoted the Koran and the Hadith.
Often one of us would interrupt him and ask for a clearer explanation.
These were occasions for him to hold his knowledge over our heads, and
he would make his explanation still more obscure. While he spoke,
someone would hand him a pipe of kif. He would stop talking for a
moment while he smoked, reach down to the table from where he stood

and take a few sips of tea, and then continue from where he had left off.
When he finished speaking, most of the men would congratulate him on
his performance, and the owner of the café would hand him another glass
of tea and some bread and butter. Some nights I invited him to eat with
me in one of the restaurants. Afterwards we would go to a bar in the
Zoco Chico to get drunk, or go and spend the night together with two
whores in a brothel. I was very proud to appear in public with him.
That afternoon he was sitting with Grida, Mesari, and old Afiouna,
who supplied the kif and majoun to the café. I asked for a glass of black
coffee and bought five pesetas’ worth of kif from Afiouna. They were
discussing King Farouk, Mohamed Neguib, and the actions of Gamal Abd
el Nasser in the July Twenty-Third Revolution. I was interested. I
smoked a pipe of kif, and filled another which I offered to Grida. He
refused it. I held it out to Abdelmalek. He did not take it either.
Put your kif away, he told me. We’ve got plenty of our own.
We want to talk quietly now, without being interrupted, Mesari
added.
I saw that they were excluding me from their company. The
qahouaji set a glass of coffee on the table. I asked Afiouna to sell me
two pieces of majoun, which I ate as I sipped the hot coffee.
Kemal the Turk came through the door, drunk. I tried to get him to sit
with me, but he refused. Then he leaned over and whispered in French
into my ear: I’ve got half a bottle of whisky. I’m going up onto the roof.
Do you want a drink?
You go up first, so Moh won’t notice.
I continued to sip my coffee for a while after he had gone on. Then,
taking the glass of coffee and the pipe with me, I climbed the stairs. I
found him drinking out of the bottle.
Ah! Fill the sebsi for me, he said. I handed him the pipe and the kif
so he could fill it himself. In return he gave me his bottle, and I took two
swallows.
How are things? I asked him.
I’m still waiting for my family to send me the money to go back to
Istanbul. He filled the pipe and handed it to me. I passed the bottle back

to him. We went on drinking, smoking, and discussing our troubles, until
all the whisky was gone.
What are you doing tonight? I asked him.
Nothing.
He hid the bottle under his jacket, and we went back downstairs.
Abdelmalek was standing as usual, lecturing on the afternoon news
broadcast in Arabic from London, which had just finished. My magazine
was still lying on the table. I sat down and asked Kemal to have
something with me. He excused himself, saying that he had an
appointment with Mahmoud the Egyptian at the Café Dar Debbagh.
He’s going to lend me some money, he said.
Moh came up to us suddenly, remarking: I don’t like drunks in this
place. Kemal, not understanding Arabic, answered: Es salaam,
Monsieur Moh.
I burst out laughing. Kemal signalled goodbye and went out.
Abdelmalek glared at me angrily and sat down.
Go on, go on, Si Abdelmalek, urged Afiouna.
How do you expect me to go on with that kid laughing?
I’m not a kid, I told him. And you talk about Mohamed Neguib and
Gamal Abd el Nasser as if you had a conference with them every day.
Where do you get all that stuff about them?
Shut up! Illiterate! he roared, beside himself. You want to talk about
politics, you, when you can’t even write your name?
Mesari was trying to get Abdelmalek’s attention. Don’t listen to
him, he told him. He’s drunk.
It seemed to me that this was a good opportunity to get in a blow at
Abdelmalek and his group of friends. They wouldn’t smoke with me, I
thought, and I began to cast about for the words that would most annoy
him. I could think of nothing to say. My mind was heavy with kif,
majoun, and whisky. I’ll have to ask him to go outside with me and fight.
It’s the easiest way. It involves no thinking of any kind.
I’m illiterate and ignorant, I said. But you’re a liar. I’d rather be
what I am than a liar like you.
Ah, get back to your pimping, he told me.

If you have a sexy sister, send her around. I’ll find her somebody, I
said.
No arguments in this café, Moh cried angrily, looking at me.
Why do you say it just to me? I asked him. Because he’s a great
professor and I’m only a stupid lout?
Come on, that’s enough, said Grida. Get together and cheat the
devil.
But the devil is people, I told him.
Then I turned to Abdelmalek. Listen, Zailachi. Come outside and I’ll
show you who the illiterate pimp is.
He jumped up and ran towards me. The three of them, Grida, Mesari
and Afiouna, blocked his way, but he shoved them aside. I got up,
holding my glass in my hand, and dashed the coffee into his face. He put
his hands over his eyes. Someone grabbed me from behind.
Outside, Zailachi! I cried. The man behind me let me go.
Be sensible, Grida told me. This is no way to behave to somebody
like him.
Who does he think he is here? He’s just a student who couldn’t stay
in school, and now he’s come to Tangier to live like a tramp.
I saw Mesari and someone else going up to the roof with
Abdelmalek. I walked back to my table, and Afiouna sat down with me.
He filled the sebsi, lit it, and handed it to me, saying: Here. Take it and
smoke. It’ll make you feel calmer.
I’m not drunk, and I’m not m’hashish, I told him. This isn’t the first
time I’ve had alcohol or majoun.
Then Grida went upstairs.
Nobody said you were drunk or kiffed, Afiouna said.
They think I am.
We all drink and smoke kif, he said.
I smoked the pipe and coughed a little. Afiouna got up and brought
his glass of tea from the table where they had been sitting. I took a sip
from it, and stopped coughing.
I’ve won the argument, I thought to myself. The other men in the café
were discussing the altercation, and I noticed that certain of them agreed

with me. They must already have felt the same way I did about
Abdelmalek.
Grida came down the stairs, followed a moment later by
Abdelmalek, Mesari, and his friend. Abdelmalek had washed the coffee
from his face and clothes. Grida came over to me. You’ve got to make
peace between you, he told me.
Yes, said Afiouna. Get up and talk to him. We’re all friends here.
They insisted, and I rose. Mesari and his friend pushed Abdelmalek
towards us, and we embraced. I turned to go back to my table, but they
made me sit down with them.
Come on, Si Moh, give us something to drink, said Grida.
Kemal came staggering back into the café. He had a black eye.
Kemal! I said. What happened to you?
Moh stared at him with annoyance.
I got up and went over to him.
There were two of them, he said. They jumped on me. At a
whorehouse in Bencharqi.
Why?
They took me for a Christian. They wouldn’t believe I was a
Moslem. They said how could I be a Moslem if I didn’t speak Arabic?
But why?
I wanted to take a Moroccan girl into bed.
All that trouble for a common whore, I said. Come and sit down
with us.
No. You come with me.
Where?
We’ll go to the Zoco Chico and have something to drink. Mahmoud
lent me a little money.
I excused myself to Abdelmalek and his group, and went out with
Kemal.
We went to the brothel run by Seoudiya el Kahala.
I know the woman who runs the place, I explained. And all the girls.
Hadija Srifiya let us in. She took us into a room and we sat down.
Soon Seoudiya el Kahala came in and greeted me. I introduced her to

Kemal.
Es salaam, he said.
Is he a Moslem? she asked me.
Naturally he is.
Does he speak Arabic?
No. He only knows a few words.
But how can he be a Moslem if he doesn’t speak Arabic?
I told her there were other countries where the people were
Moslems but spoke other languages.
Ana Muslim, Kemal told the two women. Allah oua Mohamed
rasoul illah.
We all laughed. Sit down, Lalla Seoudiya told us. Do you want
Hadija to stay here with you?
I asked Kemal. Of course she should stay, he said. Tell her to bring
another pretty one.
We ordered a bottle of cognac and a bottle of soda water. I told
Hadija to find us a girl who liked to drink and talk. The two women went
out.
Do you like that one? I asked Kemal.
She’s perfect. Moroccan girls look a lot like Turkish girls, you
know.
Hadija came back carrying a tray with the drinks. Sfiya el Qasriya
was with her.
She greeted me. How are you, handsome?
I introduced Kemal, and she sat down beside him.
The drinks are a hundred and twenty-five pesetas, said Hadija.
And if we add you two to the bill, how much will it be? I asked her.
She looked at Sfiya and giggled: Three hundred pesetas.
How much? Kemal asked me.
Three hundred altogether, for them and the drinks.
He pulled out two 100-peseta notes. This is all I’ve got, he said.
I took the two bills and added another. Call Lalla Seoudiya, I told
Hadija.
Give me the money, she said. Don’t you trust me?

It’s not that. I just want to get everything straight with Lalla
Seoudiya.
Ah! I see. Well, do as you like.
Sit down, I said. I’m going to fix it up with her.
I went out of the room in search of Lalla Seoudiya. She was sitting
in a far corner of the patio. I want to pay you now for the drinks and the
girls, I told her.
You know how much it is, she said. Two hundred and fifty pesetas.
That’s the price I make especially for you, because you’re an old client.
I gave her the money, and asked her to have me called at half past
six in the morning. I explained that the four of us would be using the same
room.
When I got back to Kemal, he had Sfiya’s head between his hands,
and was stroking her cheeks and kissing her tenderly. It’s as if he was
afraid she was going to get away, I said to myself. Perhaps some day I’ll
sleep with a Turkish girl.
Hadija wanted to know if I had got everything arranged with Lalla
Seoudiya. I folded a fifty-peseta note very small and slipped it into her
hand, saying: Keep it. It’s for you. Everything’s all settled. She stuffed
the money into her bodice and kissed me on the cheek.
I was just dropping off to sleep when Hadija, lying beside me, said:
Did you hear that? Sfiya says your friend the Turk is licking her with his
tongue.
Let him do what he likes with her, I said.
I’d rather have a tongue lick me than a zib massage me, Sfiya called
out. The two girls laughed.
I want to go to sleep, I told Hadija. I’ve got to get up early and go
down to the port.
Don’t worry, she said. I’ll wake you up as early as you like. I’m a
light sleeper. She turned towards me and hugged me. Then she pushed my
bent knee between her legs and began to rub herself against it. She
wishes it were a zib, I thought.
Sfiya had started to moan, and Hadija increased her efforts against
my knee. Suddenly she pulled at my hair violently. Then she relaxed.

Kemal and Sfiya were laughing together.
Hadija turned over and lay face down. I put out my hand and ran it
lightly over her buttocks. She was still pushing herself slowly back and
forth against the mattress. I became excited again, and jumped onto her
back for a ride. She tried to throw me from my seat, but I held tight and
stayed astride. I pretended to myself that if I were unseated I should fall
into emptiness. I was on a flying she-camel high over the desert, and to
fall off would mean being lost in the wilderness.
In the morning when I returned from the port I went into a bookshop
in Oued el Ahardan and bought a book that explained the essentials of
writing and reading Arabic.
I found Abdelmalek at the Café Moh with his brother Hassan from
Larache. I apologized again for what had happened the night before.
Forget it, he said. I was in a bad mood too.
They asked me to sit down with them, and I showed Abdelmalek the
book I had bought. I’ve got to learn to read and write, I said. Your
brother Hamid showed me a few letters while we were in the Comisaría
together. He said I could learn easily.
Why not?
Would you like to go to school in Larache? asked Hassan.
School? Me? I said surprised. It’s impossible. I’m twenty years old
and I can’t read a word.
That doesn’t matter. I know the head of a school down there. I’ll
give you a note to him. He’ll take you. He has a soft spot for out-of-
towners who want to study. If I didn’t have to go to Tetuan with this
trouble I could take you myself to see him.
He paused, and then said: Why don’t you go and buy an envelope
and a sheet of paper, and I’ll write you the note.
I did not believe in any of this, but I did as he suggested, and hurried
back to the café. He laid the sheet of paper on top of a periodical, and
began to write. From time to time he stopped and smoked a pipe of kif
with us. When he had finished he folded the paper and put it into the
envelope. Then he handed it to me.
When should I go to Larache to see him? I asked Hassan.

Whenever you like. But try and go soon.
It was about noon when Hassan said goodbye to us, and went out to
catch the bus to Tetuan. As he shook my hand he said: Be sure and go to
Larache. I’ll look for you down there in a few days.
When he had gone, Abdelmalek said: I’ve got to go up to the
graveyard at Bou Araqia.
What for? I asked him.
I promised some of my friends here in the café I’d chant some surat
today. One of them is Afiouna. His mother’s buried there.
I’ll go with you, I said. Would you be able to chant a surah at my
brother’s grave?
Your brother?
I have a brother buried there.
We smoked two pipes and then went out. On the way I asked him:
What happened with Hassan? What trouble has he got in Tetuan?
He’s crazy. They found him drinking wine and smoking kif in the
students’ dormitory at the mosque.
Tough luck!
He’s always doing stupid things like that.
As we went through the Zoco de Fuera I bought a bunch of flowers
and at the gateway to the cemetery a sprig of myrtle. Inside we found a
fe w tolba chanting. The relatives of the dead stood listening. We
wandered among the graves.
Do you know where each grave is? Each one you’re going to chant
for?
No, he said. It’s the idea that’s important. I don’t have to be standing
beside a grave to chant to it. Where’s your brother’s grave?
I looked towards the wall at whose base Abdelqader had been
buried.
It’s impossible to find it, I told him. We never made him a
gravestone before we went to Tetuan. There was no money. My father
had just got out of jail, and my mother was selling vegetables in the Zoco
de Fuera.
We climbed to the top of a small hill, and Abdelmalek began to

chant the verses for the relatives of his friends. When he had finished, he
asked me: Which part was he buried in?
Then we walked down towards the ruined wall. Over this way, near
this wall, I said.
He intoned: Ya sin oual Qoran el Hakim… while I laid the flowers
on several nearby graves. My brother is buried somewhere here, I said to
myself. Maybe under my feet, or under Abdelmalek’s feet. And the words
Abdelmalek is chanting, what are they for? My little brother never had a
chance to sin. All he did was to live his illness. The old man who had
helped to bury him had told me: Your brother is with the angels. Has he
become an angel, perhaps? And I, what shall I become? A devil, most
likely. They say the little ones are angels and the big ones are devils, and
it’s too late for me to be an angel.
