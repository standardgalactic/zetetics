CHAPTER 12
Seismic Waves and Seismology
12.1
Elementary Seismographs
The basic idea behind the workings of an elementary seis-
mograph, as described, e.g., in Richter’s text on seismology
(Richter 1958), is the analysis of the changes induced by seis-
mic waves in the behavior of a simple oscillator. As an ex-
ample let the oscillator in question be an ordinary simple
pendulum of length l and mass m. Newton’s law, in the ab-
sence of any vibrational motion of the Earth, says that for
small oscillations
m¨x = −mg
l x,
(12.1)
where x is the deviation from the vertical. When no external
disturbances are present the pendulum oscillates at a natural
frequency ω0 =
p
g/l.
Consider now the case where the pendulum’s support is
attached to the Earth’s surface, which is itself oscillating at a

164
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
frequency Ωbecause of seismic waves. The restoring force on
the pendulum is still given by −mgx/l, but the acceleration
of the mass must now also take into account the acceleration
of the pendulum’s support. Let X be the coordinate of that
support relative to a ﬁxed origin. The total acceleration of
the mass is ¨X + ¨x, and Newton’s law now reads
m( ¨X + ¨x) = −mg
l x = −mω2
0x,
(12.2)
which can be rewritten as
(¨x + ω2
0x) = −¨X.
(12.3)
Setting x(t) = x0(t) + x1(t),where x0(t) is any solution of
Eq. (12.1), and x1(t) is a function that oscillates at frequency
Ω, Eq. (12.3) becomes
¨x1 + ω2
0x1 = −Ω2X(t).
(12.4)
Solving for x1(t), we have
x1(t) =
Ω2
Ω2 −ω2
0
X(t).
(12.5)
Now x(t), the deviation from the vertical of the pendulum, is
expressed as a superposition of an oscillation at the natural
frequency of the pendulum and an oscillation at the frequency
of the seismic wave. Disentangling the oscillation at frequency
Ωis the goal of the device. To facilitate this analysis, damping
of the oscillation at the natural frequency of the pendulum
was introduced in early seismographs. Seismographs of the
twenty-ﬁrst century are much more sophisticated but make
use of these same principles.

12.3. STRAIN AND THE STRAIN TENSOR
165
12.2
Seismic Waves
Having already examined the eﬀects of earthquakes and seen
a very simple example of how the oscillations they generate
are measured, we now turn to the subject of how those waves
are produced and how they propagate, taking note of the
fact that there is more than one type of seismic wave. Prior
to doing so, we review some basic concepts in the theory of
elasticity, a subject often neglected in a common physics cur-
riculum (Landau and Lifshitz 1986; Rawlinson ). There are
two key concepts. The ﬁrst is that of strain, as encoded in
a strain tensor that describes the deformations a body un-
dergoes. The second is that of stress, with the body’s stress
tensor being the indicator of the forces leading to the defor-
mations.
12.3
Strain and the Strain Tensor
When forces act on a solid, a small volume centered at x in
a solid body moves to a new location
x′ = x + u(x).
The fundamental quantity characterizing strain is not the dis-
placement u(x), but the strain, a dimensionless measure of
relative displacement.
Examples
As an example, consider a bar of original length
l, which is extended to length l′ as shown in Fig. (12.1). If x
is the coordinate in the undeformed bar, and x′ is the corre-
sponding coordinate in the deformed bar, we have
x′ = l′
l x.

166
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
l′
l
x
Figure 12.1: Elongation strain
The displacement in the x direction is
ux(x) = (x′ −x) = l′ −l
l
x.
The strain in this case is equal to
∂ux
∂x = (l′ −l
l
).
(12.6)
We will consider only cases where the strain is small, so
quadratic terms can be ignored. For our deformed bar, small
strain means
|l′ −l
l
| << 1.
Another example of strain is shown in Fig. (12.2). Here the
displacement in the x direction depends on y :
x′ = x + ϵ
hy, ux(y) = x′ −x = ϵ
hy.
The strain in this case is
1
2
∂ux
∂y = ϵ
2h.
(12.7)
The reason for the factor of 2 in the denominator of Eq. (12.7)
will become clear below. (See Eq. (12.9).)

General Case
Treating a general case, consider two points
that are very close together in a solid body. Under deforma-
tion their separation ds = √dxidxi becomes
ds′ =
p
(dxi + dui)(dxi + dui).
Setting
dui = ∂ui
∂xj
dxj
in the above equation, we may write
ds′ =
q
ds2 + 2uijdxidxj,
where uij is a tensor, known as the strain tensor. It is easy
to see that it equals
uij = 1
2( ∂ui
∂xj
+ ∂uj
∂xi
+ ∂uk
∂xi
∂uk
∂xj
).
(12.8)
We will consider only cases of small strain,
| ∂ui
∂xj
| << 1.

168
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
Then the terms in Eq. (12.9) that are quadratic in partial
derivatives of the displacement can be ignored and the strain
tensor becomes
uij = 1
2( ∂ui
∂xj
+ ∂uj
∂xi
).
(12.9)
Volume Change
Since strain changes distances between
neighboring points, we also expect it to change small vol-
umes. To see how, note that since uij is a symmetrical tensor,
coordinate axes can be chosen at any point so that only its
diagonal elements are nonzero. In such a coordinate system,
a small volume dV in the undeformed solid transforms to dV ′
in the strained solid. We have
dV = dx1dx2dx3 →dV ′
(12.10)
= dx1(1 + u11)dx2(1 + u22)dx3(1 + u33).
Keeping only linear terms in strain tensor components,
dV ′ = dV (1 + u11 + u22 + u33) = dV (1 + tr(u))).
(12.11)
Due to the invariance of the trace, the last equality in Eq. (12.11)
is true in any coordinate system, whether or not the strain
tensor is diagonal.
12.4
Stress and the Stress Tensor
The total force on a volume V of a solid is the sum of the
forces acting on the individual atoms in the volume. Treating
the solid as a continuum, the total force is expressed as the in-
tegral over V of the force/volume, f(x). There are two types
of terms in f(x), body forces and surface forces. Gravity is

12.4. STRESS AND THE STRESS TENSOR
169
the most important body force.1 Its contribution to f(r) is
ρ(x)g(x), where g(x) is the local acceleration due to gravity.
In Sec. (2.3), Eqs. (2.34)–(2.36) amounted to a calculation of
g(x) for a spherical Earth.
The remaining term in the force/volume is the force on the
material in V due to the material outside V. Using the fact
that interatom forces are short in range, in the continuum
this can be represented as a surface integral over the surface
of V. Let us break f into terms arising from body and surface
forces, f = fb + fs. Doing likewise for the total force on the
volume V, we can write F (V ) = Fb(V ) + Fs(V ). The total
body force is
Fb(V ) =
Z
V
fb(x)d3x.
(12.12)
Likewise, the total surface force is
Fs(V ) =
Z
V
fs(x)d3x.
(12.13)
To see how the volume integral in Eq. (12.13) can be trans-
formed into a surface integral, it is easiest to work with spe-
ciﬁc components,
(Fs)i =
Z
V
(fs)id3x.
(12.14)
By the generalization of Gauss’s theorem, transformation of
the volume integral to a surface integral is only possible if the
integrand is a gradient,
(fs)i = ∂σij
∂xj
.
(12.15)
Using this form for (fs)i in Eq. (12.14), we have
(Fs)i =
Z
V
∂σij
∂xj
d3x =
Z
S
σijdSj,
(12.16)
1For rotating bodies, the centrifugal force is also a body force.

170
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
In Eq. (12.16), dSj is the jth component of the element of
surface dS = ˆndS where ˆn is the outward unit normal. The
tensor σij is known as the stress tensor.
It is symmetric
under interchange of indices, σij = σji, and has the same
dimensions as pressure: force/area. To visualize its action,
suppose a surface element of the body in question has its
normal in the j direction. Regarding i as the “force index”
and j as the “area index,” σij is the force/area in the ith
direction acting on an element of the surface whose normal is
in the jth direction.
Gravity and Stress
In the next section, we will introduce
Hooke’s law for solids and then go on in subsequent sections
to treat seismic waves. Body forces will play no role in this
discussion. The reader may well wonder, what happened to
body forces? Body forces do aﬀect the stress tensor. They
cause an equilibrium or zeroth-order stress. Hooke’s law and
seismic waves involve small oscillations around this state of
stress. Writing the stress as the sum of zeroth and ﬁrst-order
parts, we have
σij = σ(0)
ij + σ(1)
ij ,
(12.17)
the zeroth-order term can be written
σ(0)
ij = −δijp(r),
(12.18)
where the pressure p(r) is the solution to Eq. (2.33). As dis-
cussed in Sec. (2.3), p(r) depends on the entire mass inside
radius r. So only for those displacements which aﬀect the mass
inside radius r does the body force due to gravity come into
the equations of motion. Ordinary seismic waves are unaf-
fected, but for oscillations of the Earth as a whole, the body
force from gravity does come into the equations of motion.
This point is discussed further in Sec. (13.3).

12.6. YOUNG’S MODULUS AND POISSON’S RATIO 171
In the next sections on Hooke’s law and seismic waves, it
is to be understood that the part of the stress tensor being
discussed is σ(1)
ij , and the superscript will be dropped.
12.5
Hooke’s Law
In the case of small deformations, strain is generally propor-
tional to stress , a relation commonly referred to as Hooke’s
law.
Its most familiar example is the harmonic oscillator,
where the force on the oscillator is proportional to the dis-
placement from equilibrium of the oscillator coordinate. The
general statement of the proportionality between stress and
strain is
σij = Cij;klukl,
(12.19)
where the Cij;kl are a set of coeﬃcients that are independent
of stress and strain but may depend on position, temperature,
etc. We will follow Fermi in only treating the simpler case of
a homogeneous deformation, one in which the components of
the strain tensor remain constant throughout the body. In
this case of Hooke’s law, the relation between the stress and
the strain tensor only requires only two constants, Young’s
modulus and Poisson’s ratio.
These are introduced in the
next section.
12.6
Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio
Fig. (12.3) shows a solid block held rigid below and with no
external forces on the sides but subject to a pressure p from
above, so only σ33 ̸= 0. Similarly only the diagonal elements
of uij ̸= 0.
The force/area acting on the top is directed
downward, so σ33 = −p. The block will respond to the ap-
plied pressure by becoming “squished” or compressed, mean-

Figure 12.3: Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio
ing u33 < 0. Young’s modulus E is the coeﬃcient that relates
stress to strain in the 3 direction:
σ33 = Eu33.
(12.20)
Strain is dimensionless, so from Eq. (12.20), we note that
Young’s modulus has the same units as stress or pressure,
namely, force/area. The values of Young’s modulus for solid
materials are usually given in GPa, or 109 Pa. The order
of magnitude of the Young’s modulus of Earth materials ∼
100 GPa, so for such materials even very small strains require
pressures of thousands of atmospheres.
In addition to compression in the 3 direction, the block
will generally expand in the perpendicular directions.
For
a homogeneous solid, the block expands equally in the two

12.7. STRESS AND STRAIN
173
perpendicular directions, so u11 = u22. The ratio of transverse
to longitudinal strain is Poisson’s ratio, σ. (In what follows,
both Poisson’s ratio and the stress tensor involve the Greek
letter σ. They are distinguished by the stress tensor having
two subscripts, while Poisson’s ratio has none.) The deﬁning
equation is
u11 = u22 = −σu33.
(12.21)
The minus sign in this equation makes σ positive for all known
solid materials. A solid with a value of σ = 0.25 is called a
“Poisson solid.”
12.7
The Stress-Strain Relation for a Solid
The components of the stress tensor of a material obeying
Hooke’s law will be proportional to the components of the
strain tensor with the coeﬃcients expressible in terms of Young’s
modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Writing the strain tensor as the
sum of of a trace and of a traceless part is an identity. We
thus write
uij = 1
3δijtr(u) +

uij −1
3δijtr(u)

,
where tr(u) = u11+u22+u33. For a material obeying Hooke’s
law, having stress proportional to strain, we must have sep-
arately that the trace of the stress tensor is proportional to
the trace of the strain tensor and the traceless part of the
stress tensor is proportional to the traceless part of the strain
tensor, so
σij = Kδijtr(u) + 2µ

uij −1
3δijtr(u)

,
(12.22)
where K and µ are constants. We saw earlier in Eq. (12.11)
that a change in volume associated with strain is proportional

174
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
to tr(u). The quantity K is therefore known as the bulk or
compression modulus, while the second term, being traceless,
represents a shear stress; hence µ is known as the shear mod-
ulus.
The two constants K and µ must be expressible in terms
of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. To ﬁnd the relation-
ship, start with the trace of both sides of Eq. (12.22). This
gives
σ11 + σ22 + σ33 = 3K(u11 + u22 + u33).
(12.23)
Let us apply this equation to the situation of a compressed
block, discussed earlier. In that situation, the only nonzero
stress component is σ33. On the right-hand side of Eq. (12.23),
using Eq. (12.21), we can eliminate u11 and u22 in favor of u33.
Eq. (12.23) becomes
σ33 = 3K(−2σ + 1)u33.
(12.24)
Using σ33 = Eu33, we ﬁnd
K =
E
3(1 −2σ).
(12.25)
To determine µ, we write out the 33 component of Eq. (12.22).
This is
σ33 = K(u11 + u22 + u33) + 2µ[2
3u33 −1
3(u11 + u22]. (12.26)
Again using the compressed block situation, we substitute for
K, and using Eqs. (12.20) and (12.21), we see that
Eu33 =
E
3 + 4
3µ(1 + σ)

u33,
(12.27)
or
µ =
E
2(1 + σ).
(12.28)

12.8. NEWTON’S LAW IN A SOLID
175
Since K and µ are both positive we must have
−1 ≤σ ≤1/2.
In practice, since we saw earlier that σ ≥0, our limit is
−0 ≤σ ≤1/2.
Hooke’s law in terms of the constants E and σ now reads
σij =
E
3(1 −2σ)δijtr(u) +
E
(1 + σ)(uij −1
3δijtr(u)). (12.29)
12.8
Newton’s Law inside an
Elastic Solid
Consider a volume V inside a solid. The surface of the volume
is denoted as Σ. Newton’s law for the mass of the solid inside
V is, taking the ith component both of acceleration and of
force,
Z
V
ρ∂2ui
∂2t dV =
Z
Σ
σijdSj,
(12.30)
where ρ is the mass density of the solid. Applying the diver-
gence theorem, the right hand side of Eq. (12.30) becomes
Z
V
dV ∂σij
∂xi
,
and Newton’s law now reads
Z
V
dV

ρ∂2ui
∂2t −∂σij
∂xi

= 0.
(12.31)
This equation must hold no matter what choice is made for
the volume V, so the integrand must vanish, i.e.,
ρ∂2ui
∂2t = ∂σij
∂xi
.
(12.32)
This is the generalization to the interior of a solid of the point
particle version of Newton’s laws, F = ma.

176
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
12.9
The Equation of Motion for Displacement
We want to turn Eq. (12.32) into a partial diﬀerential equa-
tion for the displacement u(x). Since uij is proportional to
derivatives of position, and σij is proportional to uij, the
right-hand side of this partial diﬀerential equation will only
involve second-order spatial derivatives of u. In order for the
right-hand side to also be a 3-vector, it must be a linear com-
bination of the two possible 3-vectors, ∇(∇· u), and (∇2)u.
To discover the coeﬃcients of the two, we return to Hooke’s
law as expressed in Eq. (12.22). Rearranging this equation
slightly, we have
∂σij
∂xj
= (∂tr(u)
∂xi
)(K −2
3µ) + 2µ∂uij
∂xj
.
(12.33)
Now
tr(u) = u11 + u22 + u33 = ∂u1
∂x1
+ ∂u2
∂x2
+ ∂u3
∂x3
= (∇· u).
Furthermore,
∂uij
∂xj
= 1
2
∂
∂xj
(∂uj

) = 1
2(∇i(∇· u) + (∇2)ui).
Returning to the derivative of the stress tensor, we have
∂σij
∂xj
= (K + 1
3µ)∇i(∇· u) + µ(∇2)ui).
(12.34)
Substituting for K and µ from Eqs. (12.25) and (12.28), the
ﬁnal form of the equation of motion is
ρ∂2u
∂t2 =
E
2(1 −2σ)(1 + σ)∇(∇· u)
(12.35)
+
E
2(1 + σ)(∇2)u.

12.10.
LONGITUDINAL AND TRANSVERSE
177
This equation describes the waves that can propagate in
an elastic solid.
12.10
Longitudinal and Transverse Waves
Eq. (12.35) is easy to solve for an inﬁnite medium of ﬁxed
composition.
An arbitrary solution can be expanded into
plane waves of the form
U(k, t)eik·x.
(12.36)
Acting on this functional form, ∇brings down a factor of ik,
reducing Eq. (12.35) to an equation for the amplitude U(k, t),
ρ(d2U
dt2 ) = −
E
2(1 + σ)[
1
(1 −2σ)k(k · U) + (k · k)U]. (12.37)
We resolve the amplitude U into components parallel and
perpendicular to k, or longitudinal (L) and transverse (T)
parts:
U = UL + UT .
(12.38)
Our equation of motion now becomes
ρ(d2UL
dt2
+ d2UT
dt2 ) = −k2
E
2(1 + σ)[2(1 −σ)
(1 −2σ)UL + UT ].
(12.39)
Every term in the equation can be resolved into longitudi-
nal and transverse components. Taking the longitudinal case
ﬁrst, we have
ρ(d2UL
dt2 ) = −k2
E(1 −σ)
(1 + σ)(1 −2σ)UL.
(12.40)
This is just a harmonic oscillator equation whose solution is
UL(k, t) = UL(k)e−iωLt,
(12.41)

178
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
where the frequency satisﬁes
ρω2
L =
E(1 −σ)
(1 + σ)(1 −2σ)k2.
(12.42)
To summarize, a longitudinal plane wave solution of Eq. (12.35)
takes the form
UL(k)eik·x−iωLt,
(12.43)
where k × UL = 0. The velocity of the longitudinal waves,
cL, is given by
c2
L = (ωL
k )2 =
E(1 −σ)
ρ(1 + σ)(1 −2σ).
(12.44)
Proceeding in a similar way, the transverse component of
Eq. (12.39) satisﬁes
ρ(d2UT
dt2 ) = −k2
E
2(1 + σ)(UT ),
(12.45)
which is solved by
UT (k, t) = UT (k)e−iωT t,
(12.46)
with the frequency given by
ρω2
T =
E
2(1 + σ)k2.
(12.47)
A transverse plane wave solution of Eq. (12.35) is
UT (k)eik·x−iωT t,
(12.48)
where k · UT = 0. The velocity of transverse waves is cT ,
where
c2
T = (ωL
k )2 =
E
2ρ(1 + σ).
(12.49)

12.10.
LONGITUDINAL AND TRANSVERSE
179
The ratio of transverse to longitudinal velocities is a di-
mensionless function of Poisson’s ratio.
From Eqs. (12.44)
and (12.49), we have
(cT
cL
)2 = 1 −
1
2(1 −σ).
(12.50)
As we saw earlier, −1 ≤σ ≤1/2, so longitudinal waves
have higher velocity than transverse ones. This also means
they arrive at detectors earlier. causing them to be known
by seismologists as P or “primary waves.” Transverse waves
are accordingly known as S or “secondary waves.” Reﬂect-
ing this choice, the wave velocities are also often denoted
by vP and vS rather than cL and cT . Their typical values
in the Earth’s continental crust are, respectively, of order
5 km/s and 3 km/s (Richter 1958). Using these values and
Eq. (12.50), we ﬁnd that Poisson’s ratio in the Earth’s con-
tinental crust is σ ∼0.22, a conclusion consistent with the
measurements of materials in that crust that generally show
Poisson ratios lying in the range 0.20 −0.30.
The density of the continental crust is ρ ∼2.7 g/cm3. Using
this value, vP = 5 km/s, Eq. (12.44), and taking σ = 0.25, we
ﬁnd an average value for Young’s modulus in the continental
crust of E ∼59 Gpa, about 1/4 the value of Young’s modulus
for iron or steel, and otherwise typical of rocks found in the
Earth’s surface.
Studying deeper regions of the Earth, namely, moving be-
yond the crust into the mantle, we see that P and S wave
velocities both increase. At a depth of around 3000 km, vP =
13.5 km/s and vS = 8 km/s (Richter 1958). Beyond the man-
tle, we enter the Earth’s core, whose outer part is believed
to be ﬂuid. This is in agreement with the observation that
S waves do not penetrate this region,
as expected because
liquids cannot support the shear stress needed for their ex-

180
CHAPTER 12. SEISMIC WAVES
istence. However, longitudinal (P) waves can and do pass
through this region. As for the frequencies of seismic waves,
they are generally in the 1 −10 Hz range, with corresponding
wavelengths ranging from a few hundred meters to several
thousand meters.
12.11
Snell’s Law for Elastic Waves
Seismic waves, like optical waves, are refracted and reﬂected
when they strike a boundary between two media. Their wave
vectors are determined by a generalized form of Snell’s law,
familiar from optics. Suppose the boundary between the two
media is the plane x3 = 0, and the wave vectors of all waves
are in the 1 −3 plane. Fig. (12.4) shows three such waves:
(1) an incident wave at angle φa with respect to the normal;
(2) a reﬂected wave also making an angle φa with respect to
the normal; and (3) a transmitted wave making an angle φb
with respect to the normal. In optics, Snell’s law is usually
expressed in terms of indices of refraction,
na sin φa = nb sin φb.
(12.51)
It can equally well be written using the velocity of light prop-
agation in the media a and b,
sin φa
va
= sin φb
vb
,
(12.52)
where we use va = c/na, vb = c/nb. Fig. (12.4) shows a case
where φb < φa, corresponding to vb < va. This is an illus-
tration of the familiar phrase in optics that “going from a
fast medium to a slow medium, the transmitted wave is bent
toward the normal.”
Seismic waves also obey Snell’s law, but in general seismic
waves cannot be described by the situation of elementary op-

four boundary conditions at the interface. Given an incident

Fig. (12.5) we illustrate the situation for an incident P wave.
The situation illustrated in the ﬁgure is for the case where

locity is greater than the transverse velocity, so transverse
waves are closer to the normal. If vl, vtr are the velocities of
P and S waves in the upper medium, and v′

and reﬂected P waves have the same angle φl. These con-
ditions follow simply, as in optics, from the constancy of the
frequency and of the tangential component of the wave vector
in the two media. The situation depicted in Fig. (12.5) occurs
in a general way in the Earth, with the crust as the upper
medium, and the mantle as the lower medium. The actual
situation in the Earth is more complex due to a break in rock
composition known as the Mohorovic discontinuity. Lying at
the boundary between crust and mantle, this discontinuity is
up to 500 m thick.

Figure 12.6: Paths for P waves
Fig. (12.6) illustrates the pattern of P seismic waves fol-
lowing an earthquake. The focus of the earthquake is at the
top of the graph, and the straight black lines are possible
paths of P seismic waves.2 The large circles represent man-

tle, outer core, and inner core, respectively. Taking the focus
of the earthquake to be at 0◦, the blacked out regions be-
tween 103◦and 150◦are angles between which no P waves
can be received from the earthquake. The explanation is sim-
ply Snell’s law physics. The mantle is the “fast” medium and
the core is the “slow” medium. The ray that just grazes the
core arrives at the surface of the Earth at 103◦. This ray can
also be refracted into the core and after refraction reaches the
Earth’s surface at 150◦. A similar phenomenon would occur
with light if the mantle were replaced by air (fast medium),
and the core (slow medium) by glass.
Another striking phenomenon on the side of the Earth
away from the earthquake is that S waves are not detected
at any angles greater than 103◦. This is very strong evidence
that the outer core is liquid, where transverse waves cannot
propagate.
