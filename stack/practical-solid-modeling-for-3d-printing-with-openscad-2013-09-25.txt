Solid Modeling
... is a consistent set of principles
for mathematical and computer modeling of
three-dimensional solids.
Solid modeling is distinguished
from related areas of geometric modeling and 
computer graphics by
its emphasis on physical fidelity.
Thus sayeth Google
define: “solid modeling”

12/140
Three Dimensional Solid Models

13/140
Emphasis on Physical Fidelity

14/140
3D Printing
Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a 
process of making a three-dimensional solid 
object of virtually any shape from a digital model.
3D printing is achieved using an
additive process, where successive layers of 
material are laid down in different shapes.
Thus sayeth Wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing

15/140
“Fused Deposition” 3D Printing
●Fused Filament Fabrication
●Glorified Glue Gun Technology …
●Beware the trademark & IP minefield

17/140
OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD is a software for
creating solid 3D CAD models.
~
It is ... a 3D-compiler that
reads in a script file describing the object
and
renders the 3D model
Thus sayeth OpenSCAD
www.openscad.org

18/140
OpenSCAD
Thus it might be
the application you are looking for
when you are planning to
create 3D models of machine parts
~
but pretty sure [it] is not ... for
creating computer-animated movies.
Thus sayeth OpenSCAD
www.openscad.org/about.html

OpenSCAD Machine Models

by nophead
“The OpenScad model now includes everything 
in the kit, which is everything needed to build the 
machine apart from some sticky tape”

OpenSCAD (Im)Practical Models
SuperShapes
by WilliamAAdams
“You also get the 
procedural texture 
mapping 
checkerboard 
pattern, thrown in 
for free.”
He also does very 
practical stuff...

22/140
Constructive Solid Geometry
“CSG”

23/140
Constructive Solid Geometry
… an object is constructed from primitives
by means of allowable operations,
which are ... Boolean operations on sets:
union, intersection and difference.
Thus sayeth Wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry

38/140
Essential Transformations
●Translate([x,y,z])
●Rotate([x,y,z])
– Rotate(angle) around Z axis
●Color (“name”) or Color(“name”,alpha)
– “name” not case sensitive!
●Mirror([x,y,z])
– xyz = normal of mirror plane through origin
●Scale([x,y,z])
●Resize([x,y,z])

(Re)Compile: F5
●Fast preview mode
– Simple depth buffer
– No actual 3D model
– Colors as expected
●Not exportable!

48/140
Compile & Render: F6
●Solid Model Generation
– Full 3D rendering
– All geometry resolved
– Single color
●May not be manifold
– If you screwed up
●Exportable!

49/140
STL File Generation
●ASCII file format
– Huge files
●That’s all it takes

50/140
STL File Contents
●Triangle tessellation
– No curves!
– No “model” content
– No smarts
●Surface normals
– For each triangle
– You have no control

64/140
OpenSCAD Non-Bugging
●Use an external editor!
– Hide the OpenSCAD editor pane
●Add / change one tiny little thing at a time
– Editor’s Undo function will be your BFF
●Use what meager assistance you have
– F12: Thrown Together view
– Modifier characters: % and #
– echo(str(“This: ”,name)) shows computed values
●Keep it simple and make it obvious

65/140
OpenSCAD
Is
Not
C

66/140
OpenSCAD Is Not C
●Similar syntax, vastly different semantics
– Declarative, not procedural
– Describes geometry, not process
●Lacks many “high level” features
– This is not a bug
●Probably a write-only language
– Not easy to visualize the effects
– Modules not easily re-usable due to geometry
– Global / local variables vs. parameters

67/140
The better you are
at C / C++ / Java / whatever
~
The more trouble you are
about to have
with OpenSCAD

68/140
Iteration
●for (i = [start:increment:end])
– Don’t get clever with increment value
– Use integers, compute floats in loop
●for (i = [list, of, many, values, in, a, vector])
– Don’t get clever with nested vectors = arrays
●Implicit union() of all objects within loop
– Use intersection_for() for intersections...

71/140
Define the Dimensions!
Code should have only 
the standard magic 
constants
 … 0, 1, and 2
 … 90, 180, 360
 … maybe sqrt(2)

PolySetCache hit: 
cylinder($fn=0,$fa=12,$fs=2,h=5.2,r1=3,r
… snippage ...

75/140
Iterate Over All Rings

76/140
Conditionals
●if (this operator that)
– As in C: double-equal == equality operator
– Use to select objects, not values
●if (this == “string value”)
– Case matters
●value = (this operator that) ? if_true : if_false
– Use to select values, not objects
– Remember: There Are No Variables!

82/140
My “Best Practices”
●OpenSCAD is not a programming language
●Don’t. Be. Clever.
– If you must be clever, preprocess in Python, et. al.
●There Are No Variables
– Only defined constants with global scope
– Get over it
●Have a conditional layout for every module
– Think of it as a unit test harness
●Proceed in tiny steps

83/140
Modeling Printable Objects

84/140
Geometric Requirements
●Closed surface
– “Watertight” objects
●Consistent Normals
– All aimed outward
●2-Manifold
– Exactly 2 faces / edge
●No coincident faces

●Not a closed surface
– Not “watertight”
●Inconsistent normals
●Easy to see?
– Maybe in this model...
– Book version is OK
●CSG = 3D volumes
●Mesh = 2D surfaces

DXF Import & Export
●import_dxf() and projection()

●Good luck...

Outlines From Drawings
●Perimeter → Shape
– Start from EPS
– Limited resolution
– Maintain chirality
●A simple matter of software
– Imagemagick FTW!
– minkowski() sum

135/140
Surface Height Maps
●surface(file=...)
– Very specific file format
●8 bit grayscale → Z height
– Yes, 256 Shades of Grey...
●A simple matter of software
– Imagemagick FTW!
– Bash scripting
– XY resolution limit
http://softsolder.com/2012/11/09/automated-cookie-cutters-putting-it-all-together/

●Start simple
– Keep it simple
●Math is your friend
– Measurements!
– Calculate everything
●Slice & Verify G-Code
– That’s another talk...
– Always verify before printing
●Build Stuff You Need!
