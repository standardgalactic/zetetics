Science museums create fun learning experiences for the public

Science
museums
build trusting
relationships
with the public

How does the
public feel
about
science?

Three sources of data:
Science and the Public: A Review of Science
Communication and Public Attitudes to Science in Britain
Office of Science and Technology and the Wellcome Trust, October 2000
Science and Engineering Indicators 2006
National Science Board, U.S.
Center for Nanotechnology in Society Survey
Preliminary data not yet published, Arizona State University, 2007

Public Attitudes to Science in Britain
are very positive
• 68% agree that science and technology are making
our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable
• 72% agree research that advances knowledge
should be supported by the government even if is
brings no immediate benefits
• 75% are “amazed” by the achievements of science
• 84% think scientists and engineers make a valuable
contribution to society
http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD003420.html

• Only 43% agreed that the benefits of scientific
research outweigh any harmful results.
• 70% agree that rules will not stop researchers from
doing what they want behind closed doors.
• 56% think scientists seem to be trying new things
without stopping to think about risks.
• 69% think scientists should listen more to what
ordinary people think
http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD003420.html
Public Attitudes to Science in Britain
also show reservations

U.S. Science and Technology Indicators
2006 are very positive
• 91% agreed that science and technology are making
our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable
• 83% agree research that advances knowledge should
be supported by the government even if is brings no
immediate benefits
• 86% agreed that because of science and technology,
there will be more opportunities for the next generation
• 84% agreed that the benefits of scientific research
outweigh harmful results.

A sizeable segment of the U.S. population
has some reservations about S&T
• 56% agreed that "we depend too much on science
and not enough on faith,"
• 61% agreed that "scientific research these days
doesn't pay enough attention to the moral values of
society,"
• 51% felt that "scientific research has created as many
problems for society as it has solutions."
• However, this 2004 data shows that agreement with
the last two statements declined from 2001.

In this spot there will be a slide showing
CNS- ASU preliminary data on
public trust of various sources
on benefits and risks of new technologies

Working with scientists to create
experiences for the public

tools of
science

Using new technologies to create engaging
learning experiences about science

Research to learn how well various science
thinking tools work with youth - molecular modeling

Nanotechnology
 Risks, Benefits, and Who Decides
Given the potential benefits as well as
the unknown risks associated with
nanotechnology, who should play the
major role in shaping its future
development and the government
policies concerning its use?
