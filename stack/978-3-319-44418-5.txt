The books in this collection are devoted to challenging and open problems at the
forefront of modern science, including related philosophical debates. In contrast to
typical research monographs, however, they strive to present their topics in a
manner accessible also to scientiﬁcally literate non-specialists wishing to gain
insight into the deeper implications and fascinating questions involved. Taken as a
whole, the series reﬂects the need for a fundamental and interdisciplinary approach
to modern science. Furthermore, it is intended to encourage active scientists in all
areas to ponder over important and perhaps controversial issues beyond their own
speciality. Extending from quantum physics and relativity to entropy, conscious-
ness and complex systems—the Frontiers Collection will inspire readers to push
back the frontiers of their own knowledge.

Foreword
First of all, let me thank Mr. Shyam Wuppuluri for his years of effort devoted to
inspiring, assembling, and editing this volume. Rather than attempting to comment
on the papers in it, I shall try to outline my approach to some issues that the reader
may ﬁnd helpful to bear in mind when reading these papers. Unfortunately, the
concepts needed to discuss these issues are so interrelated that I have not found it
possible to provide a simple, sequential introduction to these concepts. Indeed, they
are inextricably intermingled in my presentation.
Every human community is based on an interrelated complex of labor processes
that enable the community not just to survive but that, if successful, enable it to
grow and thrive. Each such labor process involves three elements: the labor of a
group of people using some tools to act upon the initial objects of labor (the “raw
materials”). The goal of this process is action upon these initial objects in such a
way as to produce ﬁnal objects (the “ﬁnished products”) that will beneﬁt at least
some members of the community.
But not all tools and initial objects are external to the members of the com-
munity. Language—and other symbolic systems that language enables people to
create—allows them to form conceptual systems, some of which in turn become
intellectual tools that can be used to modify the initial conceptual systems and to
create new ones.
In other words, not all labor need to be manual. Just as important is intellectual
labor. Like all forms of labor, intellectual labor starts from some object—in this
case a conceptual object—and works on this object with the aim of modifying it to
produce a new conceptual object (see my paper “Problems not Disciplines”). There
are many types of intellectual tools (art, literature, religion, etc.) but most important
for the questions discussed in this volume are the scientiﬁc disciplines, including
both the so-called natural and social sciences (better called the human sciences—the
Geisteswissenschaften in German).
Why include the social sciences? As in all other forms of labor, a successful
intellectual labor process is ultimately the result of the collective labor of more than
one individual: knowledge is our name for such results. Rather than being an
vii

individual problem, as it has been treated in Western philosophy since the time of
Descartes, the problem of knowledge is a social problem (see my paper Where is
Knowledge?). And it should always be borne in mind that the ultimate goal of all
intellectual labor is to provide additional resources to some human community for
action upon the material world and, intended or not, to produce changes in the
community itself.
As noted already, in the case of intellectual labor the objects of labor are
complexes of concepts; and the collective labor acting upon these complexes is that
of some intellectual community. When it is successful, new knowledge is our name
for the results of such a process of intellectual labor. And it is important to bear in
mind that knowledge itself is indeed a process that will never end as long as
intellectual communities continue to exist. So one should be suspicious of any
proposed axiomatization of some realm of human knowledge, especially if it is
accompanied by claims of the closure of what should be an open, unending process.
An important philosophical issue is the distinction between the conceptual
objects that constitute our knowledge and the objects of that knowledge, and the
relation between these two. Such philosophical doctrines as conﬂicts as empiricism,
rationalism, naturalism, materialism and idealism depend on the answer to this
question. Sufﬁce it to say that I regard the goal of action on the objects of
knowledge as primary. The introduction of a new conceptual object, or the modi-
ﬁcation of an existing one, must make clear its relation to some object(s) of
knowledge. In the case of physical concepts, such as space and time, this means that
their deﬁnition must be accompanied by some account of the means by which an
ideal measurement of this quantity can be carried out.
Let me emphasize: I am not maintaining that it is meaningful because it is
measurable; rather that because it is meaningful it must in principle be measurable.
No one has stated this lesson more eloquently than Gaston Bachelard:
In order to embody new experimental evidence, it is necessary to deform the original
concepts, study the conditions of applicability of these concepts, and above all incorporate
the conditions of applicability of a concept into the very meaning of the concept. … The
classic division that separates a theory from its application ignores this necessity to
incorporate the conditions of applicability into the very essence of the theory (La formation
de l’esprit scientiﬁque. Paris: Vrin. 1938, pg. 61; transl. by J.S.).
Like all tools, intellectual tools themselves may become the object of a labor
process aimed at improving their effectiveness—indeed one tool may even be set
aside totally in favor of some new tool. The prime example is relation between
language, the ﬁrst intellectual tool, and logic. Logic is a tool created for the
improvement of language when it is applied to certain subjects. Indeed, one should
rather say “logics,” since more than one consistent logical system may be employed
in the critical reconstruction of a language. So one might say that logic is about
language and language is about the world. Often this two-step relation is reduced to
a one-step relation: logic is about the world—a view I have criticized for decades
[A] logic always has some language as its object. The more formalized one wants the logic
to be, the more formalized the language must be. … Since a logic presupposes a language,
viii
Foreword

the objects logic studies must be linguistic objects. I believe in the existence of other objects
which are quite independent of language; but such objects, in contrast to linguistic refer-
ences to them, cannot have a logic. Lest this be thought a mere verbal quibble, let me point
out that someone who believed that all reality was fundamentally conceptual in nature
could meaningfully and non-metaphorically speak of the logic of the world.
The doctrine that all relations are fundamentally logical relations and that there is hence no
basic distinction between logic and ontology is not unknown in the philosophical literature.
… It has even been given a name, “panlogism” … However, if one does adopt this position,
it should be done with full awareness, and not tacitly through acceptance of a certain
approach to quantum logic” (excerpts from “Do Quanta Need a New Logic?”).
I maintain that, in this respect, mathematics is similar to logic. Mathematical
structures do not apply directly to the world, but to other conceptual structures that
have been created to apply to some aspects of the world. Again this two-step
relation is often short-circuited with the assertion that mathematical structures apply
directly to the world (see Where is Knowledge?). In the case of physical structures,
the easiest way to see the fallacy of such an assertion is by looking the question of
units. In order to quantify any physical concept, a system of appropriate units must
be introduced; and it is only the ratio of some physical quantity to its unit that is a
pure number, and the usual mathematical relation between two such physical
concepts can only be applied to pure numbers. To deﬁne the distance between two
points, one must ﬁrst specify some unit of distance, and the numerical value of the
distance between these points is then the ratio of that distance speciﬁed in these
units divided by this unit of distance. Given a set of such primary units, secondary
units may then be computed. For example, in order to specify the velocity of some
object one must divide a spatial distance by a temporal interval; so units of space
and time must ﬁrst be speciﬁed.
Finally, let me turn to the concepts of space and time. If we now consider the
objects of the dynamical natural sciences, their objects themselves are processes
(e.g., mechanical, electromagnetic, quantum, etc.). As long as the Newtonian
worldview prevailed, it made sense to consider such processes as composed of a
sequence of states, one for each value of the absolute time. But with the advent
of the special theory of relativity, and even more the general theory of relativity, a
viewpoint based on states is no longer tenable. The processes are primary; and any
introduction of a temporal sequence of states—to the extent that it is possible—is
quite secondary and dependent on additional deﬁnitions. A number of theoretical
physicists have emphasized the primacy of process, including Lee Smolin:
Relativity theory and quantum theory each. tell us—no, better, they scream at us—that our
world is a history of processes. Motion and change are primary. Nothing is, except in a very
approximate and temporary sense. How something is, or what its state is, is an illusion. It
may be a useful illusion for some purposes, but if we want to think fundamentally we must
not lose sight of the essential fact that ‘is’ is an illusion. So to speak the language of the new
physics we must learn a vocabulary in which process is more important than, and prior to
stasis (Three Roads to Quantum Gravity. Basic Books, 2001).

To put it another way, the four-dimensional concept of space–time is primary, its
possible division into three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time is quite
secondary and depends on the introduction of additional concepts.
What about time, the reader may object? Surely this is a primary concept. Here
one must make a distinction between two concepts of time that are often conﬂated:
between what I have called local time and global time (see “Albert Einstein: A Man
for the Millennium”). To clarify what I mean by the concept of the local time
between two events, I often draw an analogy between this concept and the concept
of the spatial distance between two places. It is well known that the distance
between two different places depends on the spatial path between them. The
shortest distance is along the straightest path between them. The local time between
two non-coincident events in space–time depends on the spatiotemporal path
between them. That is the analogy; the difference is that the longest local time
interval between the two events is along the straightest path in space–time has. As
alluded to above in the discussion of units, it is the local time that is measured by
clocks and the spatial distance that is measured by rulers (“measuring rods”).
Clearly, when one speaks of two non-coincident events as “taking place at the
same time,” it cannot be the concept of local time that is involved. Indeed it is here
that the concept of global time enters the story. When the Newtonian worldview
prevailed, the additional concept of the absolute time provided such a deﬁnition
of the global time. Two non-coincident events either occurred at the same absolute
time or one preceded the other, and clocks measured this absolute time in a
path-independent way. Once the concept of absolute time was abandoned, clocks
measured only the path-dependent local time, and two non-coincident events might
or might not be connected by a temporal path. Given an initial event, all events not
connected to it by a timeline path form an entire region of space–time that has been
called the elsewhere of the event. The concept of global time amounts to some
deﬁnition of a three-dimensional slice of this four-dimensional elsewhere; and in
general nothing physically signiﬁcant can depend on this deﬁnition.
The great divide between general relativity and all previous dynamical theories
is that they were all based on ﬁxed and given space–time structures. All dynamical
processes took place on the ﬁxed and given stage provided by these structures. In
contrast, general relativity has no such ﬁxed structures. All space–time structures
are themselves dynamical entities, subject to ﬁeld equations. So that until a solution
to these ﬁeld equations is speciﬁed, no answers to questions about space–time
structures can be given. As I have put it elsewhere: in all the rest of physics,
“where” and “when” are parts of the question; in general relativity, “where” and
“when” are parts of the answer.
I do not expect the reader to uncritically accept my viewpoint on these issues;
but hope that he or she will bear in mind the need for adopting some standpoint
about them when confronting many of the questions discussed in this volume.

Preface
This book offers, to a diverse nonspecialist audience, a panorama of contextual
perspectives on the topics of space and time. Almost every ﬁeld has in its language,
a notion of space and time. This duo is intertwined into the fabric of our existence.
If you are an aﬁcionado of classical music, you would see that absolute music and
programmed music differ not only in their nature but also in purpose. While the
former is composed for its own sake, the latter is composed keeping in mind a
context. Akin to this, space and time, have been analyzed either for their own sake
or to ﬁt a context and thereby to serve some purpose. To each his own.
When this collection was planned, it seemed natural to organize the articles,
written by towering ﬁgures belonging to seven diverse ﬁelds, into various sections
to facilitate a better understanding. And with the hope that a global meaning would
emerge from such contextual viewpoints when the dots are connected. We thus
segregated this volume into various ﬁelds, namely philosophy, physics, mathe-
matics, biology/cognitive science, logic/computer science and a section ‘Miscel-
laneous’ which includes literature, space–time geography and art.
Einstein once remarked, “Space and Time are modes by which we think and not
a condition in which we live.” The Philosophy section is therefore devoted to some
foundational and metaphysical aspects of Space and Time, which are intuitive in
nature. Articles contain views of philosophers like Descartes, Newton, Leibniz,
Hume, Kant, Poincare, Cassirer, Sartre, Husserl, etc., on space and time. In addition
to the western philosophy, two articles are dedicated to elaborating on the views of
space and time of the Indian schools of thought—Vedic and Nyaya. It also contains
a treatise on the nature of space and time.
Thinking often gets translated into a theory after it passes the toll gate of the
scientiﬁc method, which not only veriﬁes the claims experimentally but also checks
their consistency. The Physics section is aimed at providing a clear and precise
account of empirical/physical status of space and time. Its articles cover topics
ranging from relativity theory to quantum theory, ideas of Minkowski, Einstein, and
Hermann Weyl, and others, and some more recent advances in our understanding of
Space and Time.
xiii

The Book of Nature is written in the language of mathematics, as Galileo
remarked. The next section deals with the mathematical foundations of space and
time. Articles address themes such as the nature of metric, manifolds, spatial
relationships, and the nature of the continuum. They draw from the works of Euclid,
Leibniz, Einstein, Hermann Weyl, Grothendieck, and others, thereby trying to
analyze and model the notions of Space and Time from a mathematical setting.
These contributions are both pedagogical and expository in nature.
Space and time are intangible. But our consciousness paints them for us all the
time. Be it when our house is packed with guests or when a deadline is pressing.
But what are these notions produced by our brains? The section Biology/Cognitive
Science deals with spatial and temporal perceptions and how they are grounded in
our cognition, space in biological systems, time in biological systems (circadian
rhythms) and time from an evolutionary perspective.
Merrick Furst once remarked, “The biggest difference between time and space is
that you can’t reuse time.” Within the computational context, we concern ourselves
with storage (space), computing time (time) and their associated complexities. This
section, Logic/Computer Science, deals with topics such as computational com-
plexity, space–time tradeoffs in analytic engines and topics in classical and modern
logic
that
pertain
to
the
second
part
of
the
title,
limits
of
human
understanding/thinking. It offers a concise account of the logician Kurt Godel’s
work which includes his incompleteness theorems, their impact on theoretical
physics and economics and his views on time.
The last section, ‘Miscellaneous’, contains handpicked articles which elucidate
the notions of space and time with in the ﬁelds of literature, space–time geography
and visual arts.
An intriguing foreword by Prof. John Stachel and a captivating afterword by
Prof. Noam Chomsky add icing to the cake. All the 44 authors have taken utmost
care to keep the articles as nontechnical as possible and self-contained. They have
included an appendix with their articles (when needed) to furnish the technicalities
for those keen to explore deeper.
During my undergraduate days, I, like many others, was deeply inﬂuenced by
the fresh worldview found in Douglas Hofstadter’s books. He is in a sense the ‘Pied
Piper’, that Hermann Weyl once addressed David Hilbert as, who seduced many
rats to follow him into the deep river of thinking. His emphasis that analogy making
is at the core of our cognition, motivated me and eventually led to inception of this
volume.
An original thinker belonging to any domain of science should be Sherlock’ian
in many aspects. Just as Holmes decodes the mysterious stick ﬁgures inscribed on
the walls (The adventure of the Dancing Men) by ﬁnding patterns and thereby
extracting meanings, the true pursuit of science begins with decoding such ana-
logical stick ﬁgures painted by Mother Nature on the canvas of perceived reality.
They can be tracks on bubble chambers or patterns within numbers. In such a
xiv
Preface

pursuit, one greatly beneﬁts from knowledge of diverse ﬁelds which can trigger
cross-domain analogies. We sincerely hope, through this erudite volume, that a
symphony of patterns and a tapestry of intuitions will emerge, providing a holistic
insight into the questions: ‘What is Space?’ and ‘What is Time?’

Of course Rome was neither built in a day nor by a single person! I am very
fortunate to ﬁnd a lot of people who went out of their way to support me in this
endeavor. Chronologically, I would like to thank Prof. John Stachel from the
bottom of my heart for agreeing to write a foreword and guiding me patiently all
through since the project’s inception. His support kick-started the project. My
decision to proceed with Springer owed much to the wonderful association with the
editor, Dr. Angela Lahee, who has played a role not less than that of a guardian
angel concerning this project. Her unparalleled expertise, enthusiasm, and patience,
coupled with timely and valuable advice are gratefully acknowledged. The project
could not have been in better hands than hers.
While the overall structure and contents were in place, with 38 authors on board
but still moored in the harbor, I sought a co-editor, who would provide me with
feedback. Little did I know that Prof. Giancarlo Ghirardi, a close associate of Prof.
John Stewart Bell, would be the one to join me in this journey as a co-editor.
Despite his health issues he took out time from his busy academic life and dealt
with the project with care and patience. I have greatly beneﬁted from his associ-
ation, humility, wisdom, and support. Language deﬁnitely fails to translate the
gratitude I have towards him. My heartfelt thanks to Prof. Noam Chomsky, who
does not need an introduction. I am yet to ﬁnd an adjective which has not been used
previously to describe his multifaceted personality. Though I feel guilty that I
cannot take the name of each author, I would like to thank every author, whole-
heartedly, for their efforts and especially those who generously and patiently col-
laborated, incorporating the feedback and customizing the article. I am fortunate to
have such associations. Sadly I must mention that Prof. Jonathan Borwein, who not
only contributed to this volume but also leaves behind a wealth of other intellectual
achievements, died on 2nd August, 2016. Mourning his passing, I would like to
warmly acknowledge his efforts and support. The fact that he will continue to live
through his works offers great solace to all his admirers.
xvii

I would also like to thank people, who though are not directly connected to this
project, have inﬂuenced me, positively, in many ways. After all action at a distance
has its place in physics!
I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart—Prof. Sujatha Ramdorai,
who has been a beacon of support, not just to me but to many others who are
passionate about science. My existence owes a lot to the solacing support she
offered at various times. I would also like to thank Mr. M. G. Subramanian for
teaching me the art of online communication, during my formative years. I would
like to express my gratitude towards the director-principal Mrs. Avnita Bir and
Podar management for always supporting me.
Lastly I would like to thank Prof. R. Sridharan, who, though he never taught me
directly, nevertheless has inspired me deeply through his writings, humanity,
humility, intellect and emphasis on quality. The relationship that I share with him is
that of an arbitrary pebble with an ocean ingente—whose deep bond is both
unbeknownst to the passersby and undisturbed by the chaotic wind.
Such is the stance of unsung bonds and friendships whose existence forms a
fragrant and radiant twine which is stitched alongside with the other dull cords of
humdrum routines into the robe of hermit’s life—which is what makes his life both
interesting and worth living!

Space as a Source and as an Object
of Knowledge: The Transformation
of the Concept of Space
in the Post-Kantian Philosophy
of Geometry
Francesca Biagioli
1.1
Introduction
This paper deals with the transformation of the concept of space in the post-Kantian
philosophy of geometry from the second half of the nineteenth century to the early
twentieth century. Kant famously characterized space and time as forms of intu-
itions, which lie at the foundations of the apodictic knowledge of mathematics. The
success of his philosophical account of space was due not least to the fact that
Euclidean geometry was widely considered to be a model of apodictic certainty at
that time. However, such later scientiﬁc developments as non-Euclidean geometries
and the general theory of relativity called into question the certainty of Euclidean
geometry and posed the problem of reconsidering space not so much as a source of
knowledge, but as an open question for empirical research.
The ﬁrst section offers a discussion of the main objections against Kant’s view of
space as a source of knowledge. The opposed view of space as an object of
knowledge emerged in geometrical empiricism, a tradition that can be traced back to
such mathematicians as Carl Friedrich Gauss, Nikolai Lobachevsky, Bernhard
Riemann, Richard Dedekind, and Felix Klein, and that found one of its clearest
expressions in the epistemological writings of the physiologist and physicist Her-
mann von Helmholtz. The second section provides a general introduction to the new
phase of this debate inaugurated by Einstein’s general theory of relativity of 1915. On
the one hand, Einstein relied on geometrical empiricism for the view that geometry
has an empirical meaning. On the other hand, he distanced himself from the received
view of space by claiming that the general covariance of his ﬁeld equations removed
from space and time the last remnant of physical objectivity. In the third section,

I discuss two different strategies for a philosophical account of the transformation of
the concept of space from a Kantian perspective: (1) Hermann Weyl vindicated the
foundational role of the Kantian concept of space by observing that any coordinate
assignment, even in Einstein’s relativistic space-time theory, presupposes the ideal
perspective of the transcendental subject for its setting; (2) Ernst Cassirer emphasized
the heuristic aspect of the concept of space as a hypothetical system of mathematical
relations. Although both strategies offer a possible philosophical account of space
informed by the sciences, I argue that Cassirer’s focus on the structure of spatial
notions, rather than their subjective origin, had the advantage of reﬂecting a variety of
uses of spatial concepts in human culture and art, which he considered to be no less
essential than scientiﬁc concepts to a philosophical account of the concept of space.
1.2
Three Roads to Geometrical Empiricism
in the Nineteenth Century
1.2.1
The Philosophical
The ﬁrst motivation for geometrical empiricism was to overcome some of the
philosophical difﬁculties of Kant’s account of space in the Critique of Pure Reason.
Kant characterized space and time by distinguishing these concepts from sensa-
tions, on the one side, and general concepts, on the other. The ﬁrst distinction is in
terms of form and matter of appearance: “Since that within which the sensations can
alone be ordered and placed in a certain form cannot itself be in turn sensation, the
matter of all appearance is only given to us a posteriori, but its form must all lie
ready for it in the mind a priori, and can therefore be considered separately from all
sensation” (Kant [1], A20/B34). More speciﬁcally, space and time are forms of
intuition, according to Kant, insofar as the order of appearance is directly present to
the mind in the localization of objects in space and time. Therefore, he claimed that
space is a necessary representation, which lies at the foundation of all outer intu-
itions (A24/B38). Kant went on to argue that space differs from general concepts in
the way in which it is related to its parts: whereas general concepts contain a ﬁnite
collection of possible instantiations under them, any limitation of space, including
inﬁnite division, lies in a single concept of space as one of its parts. Therefore, he
characterized space as an intuition that lies at the origin of knowledge concerning
external reality. The principles of (Euclidean) geometry offered the ﬁrst example of
conceptual knowledge derived from intuition with apodictic certainty (A25/B39).
One classical objection to this view is that it presupposed the syllogistic logic of
Kant’s time, according to which logical reasoning is restricted to ﬁnite domains and
construction in intuition is necessary to justify existential assumptions concerning
inﬁnite domains (e.g., the parallel to a given line from a point outside it and
4

incommensurable magnitudes).1 After the emergence of mathematical logic in the
nineteenth century, it became possible to account for the same distinction in terms
of two different means of logical proof or rules of quantiﬁcation. This approach to
Kant’s intuition, which is known as “logical,” goes back to Cassirer [3] and was
given a modern formulation by Hintikka [4]. Alternative approaches include the
phenomenological approach advocated by Parsons [5], among others, based on the
fact that immediacy is no less essential than singularity to the Kantian conception of
space. But how to accommodate the former feature of intuition with the discovery
of non-Euclidean geometry in the nineteenth century? Not only does such a dis-
covery contradict the view that Euclidean geometry is evidently true, but the
question arises whether geometric knowledge can be true at all.
In order to overcome this difﬁculty, Friedman [6] argued for mediating between
these two approaches in line with Helmholtz’s geometrical empiricism. On the
other hand, Helmholtz ruled out the view of geometrical axioms as evident truths by
explaining how basic geometric notions are derived by observation and experience
of rigid motions. On the other hand, he inferred a naturalized form of intuition by
considering the possible changes of perspective of a perceiving subject. As
Helmholtz [7, p. 162] put it, “Kant’s doctrine of the a priori given forms of intuition
is a very fortunate and clear expression of the state of affairs; but these forms must
be devoid of content and free to an extent sufﬁcient for absorbing any content
whatsoever that can enter the relevant form of perception.” Helmholtz believed that
the form/content distinction deserved a new formulation after the emergence of
experimental psychology of vision, on the one hand, and non-Euclidean geometry,
on the other.
1.2.2
The Natural
Helmholtz’s naturalization of the Kantian theory of perception goes back to his
1855 lecture “Über das Sehen des Menschen.” On that occasion—Helmholtz was
delivering the Kant Memorial Lecture as a Professor of Physiology at the
University of Königsberg—he maintained that Kant’s view that the perception of
physical objects presupposes some subjective forms of intuition received an
empirical conﬁrmation in Johannes Müller’s theory of speciﬁc nerve energies.
Müller showed that sensuous qualities depend not so much on the perceived object
as on the constitution of our nerves in the case of perceptions usually associated
with light. His theory accounted for the fact that the same visual sensation can have
different causes (e.g., an electric current or a blow to the eye). Vice versa, light does
not necessarily cause visual sensations, but, for example, ultraviolet rays cause only
chemical reactions.
1Several examples are discussed in Friedman [2, Ch. 1].

Helmholtz was Müller’s student in Berlin and relied on the same experimental
methodology. However, he developed an original approach to visual perception in
his Handbuch der physiologischen Optik (1867). Helmholtz advocated a theory of
local signs, according to which sensations are signs for their stimuli. According to
him, visual perception depends on our capacity to interpret those signs by drawing
unconscious inferences from nerve stimuli to existing objects. Such a capacity
deserves an empirical explanation in terms of psychological—rather than purely
physiological—processes. Therefore, Helmholtz called his approach “empirist” and
contrasted it with nativist views.2 In this connection, he distanced himself from
Kant’s conception of space and time as pure intuitions, whose form can be deﬁned
independently of any empirical content. Not only did Kant overlook the empirical
conditions for the formation of these concepts, but his theory of pure sensibility led
his followers to assume that there are innate laws grounded in the form of spatial
intuition, that is, the axioms of (Euclidean) geometry (Helmholtz [9], p. 456).
As it emerges most clearly in Helmholtz’s later paper “Die Tatsachen in der
Wahrnehmung” (1878), Helmholtz’s criticism did not rule out the possibility of
generalizing the Kantian notion of form of spatial intuition to all possible combi-
nations of contents. After the passage quoted above, Helmholtz went on to say that
“the axioms of geometry limit the form of intuition of space in such a way that it
can no longer absorb every thinkable content, if geometry is at all supposed to be
applicable to the actual world. If we drop them, the doctrine of the transcendentality
of the form of intuition is without any taint. Here Kant was not critical enough in his
critique; but this is admittedly a matter of theses coming from mathematics, and this
bit of critical work had to be dealt with by the mathematicians” (Helmholtz [7],
p. 162).3 Furthermore, Helmholtz believed that even his empiricist epistemology
relied ultimately on the assumption of a lawful course of nature, which sometimes
he presented as a condition of the possibility of experience in Kant’s sense.4
I turn back to the latter issue in connection with Cassirer’s theory of the sym-
bolic forms of experience. The following section offers a brief overview of different
positions on geometrical empiricism in nineteenth-century mathematics.
2See [8, Ch. 5]. Helmholtz addressed two different questions. The ﬁrst concerned the
two-dimensionality of vision. At the time Helmholtz was writing, the dominant view endorsed by
Johannes Müller, among others, was that a two-dimensional, spatial representation is primitively
given in vision. In this view, only the perceptions of depth and of distance (i.e., the kind of
perceptions that presuppose three-dimensionality) have to be learned. By contrast, Helmholtz
sought to derive all spatial representations from the association of nonspatial sensations. The
second question concerned the singularity of vision. Helmholtz called nativist Müller, Ewald
Hering, and all those who derived the singularity of vision from the supposition of an anatomical
connection between the two retinas.

[10].

Helmholtz’s relation to Kant in this regard. Cf. Hatﬁeld [8] and Hyder [11].

1.2.3
The Mathematical
The third road to geometrical empiricism goes back to the ﬁrst attempts to rethink
the question concerning the form of physical space after the discovery of
non-Euclidean geometry.5 Different hypotheses about the existence and the number
of parallel lines to a given line had been explored in the eighteenth-century by such
mathematicians as Girolamo Saccheri, Johann Heinrich Lambert, and Adrien-Marie
Legendre. However, it was only in the 1820s that János Bolyai and Nikolai
Lobachevsky, independently of each other, developed a system of geometry based
on the denial of Euclid’s parallel postulate. Lobachevsky was also one of the ﬁrst to
address the question whether non-Euclidean theorems (e.g., the proposition that the
sum of the angles in a triangle is less than 180°, which followed from the denial of
the
parallel
postulate)
can
be
tested
empirically
by
using
astronomical
measurements.
Although such an experiment proved to be impractical, much of the debate that
followed from Riemann to Einstein concerned the possibility to explore the link
between geometry and experience. As Gauss (in [13], p. 87) put it in a letter to
Bessel dated April 9, 1830, “the theory of space has an entirely different place in
knowledge from that occupied by pure mathematics. There is lacking throughout
our knowledge of it the complete persuasion of necessity (also of absolute truth)
which is common to the latter; we must add in humility that if number is exclu-
sively the product of our mind, space has a reality outside our mind and we cannot
completely prescribe its laws.” On the one hand, Gauss’s remark is reminiscent of
Newton’s view of geometry as the part of mechanics that deals with measurement
in the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica [14]. On the other hand, by
1830, Gauss had enough knowledge of non-Euclidean geometry to see that there
might be different possible hypotheses when it comes to the laws of space.6
A further development of this tradition is found in Gauss’s student’s, Bernhard
Riemann, habilitation lecture of [17] “Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie
zu Grunde liegen” and in a series of papers published by Helmholtz between 1868
and 1878 and later collected by Paul Hertz and Moritz Schlick in the centenary
edition of Helmholtz’s Epistemological Writings (1977).7 Both Riemann and
Helmholtz started with a general notion of space as a manifold, comparable with
such empirical manifolds as color and tone systems, in order to then pose the
question of the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for introducing metrical rela-
tions. In this regard, Riemann showed the possibility of formulating inﬁnitely many

Engel and Stäckel [12].
6Sartorius von Waltershausen [15, p. 81] reported that even Gauss made an attempt to test the
Euclidean hypothesis during his geodetic work. However, this interpretation is controversial and it
was only after Bolyai’s and Lobachevsky’s works that the question arose whether the geometry of
space could be non-Euclidean (see [16]).

geometrical hypotheses based on Gauss’s geometry of surfaces. Riemann fore-
shadowed Einstein’s general theory of relativity by considering even the hypothesis
of variably curved spaces and by articulating the conjecture of a metric, whose
coefﬁcients would depend on the local distribution of matter and forces.
The greater generality of Riemann’s inquiry notwithstanding (Helmholtz
restricted his consideration to manifolds of constant curvature), Helmholtz was one
of the ﬁrst to draw attention to the possibility of a physical interpretation of
non-Euclidean geometry. He identiﬁed the fundamental precondition for the pos-
sibility of measurement as the requirement that the points of a system in motion
remain ﬁxedly linked or the free mobility of rigid bodies. He considered this to be a
fact ascertained by observation and experiment, beginning with our ability to
localize objects in space by performing congruent displacements. He then showed
that the metrical geometry that is implicit in spatial perception and in measurement
includes both Euclidean and non-Euclidean cases as possible mathematical speci-
ﬁcations. He agreed with the conclusion of Riemann’s inquiry, insofar as he
believed his argument to prove the empirical—rather than a priori—origin of
geometrical axioms.
The standard formulation of geometrical empiricism, in this sense, is found in
Helmholtz’s 1870 public lecture “Über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der
geometrischen Axiome,” which initiated a philosophical and mathematical debate
on the status of geometrical axioms.8 A further development of Helmholtz’s view of
axioms as empirical generalizations is found in Pasch [20], which contains one of
the ﬁrst axiomatic treatments of geometry. The notion of axiom was progressively
weakened with the emergence of the axiomatic method. Both mathematicians and
philosophers called axioms “postulates” to emphasize the conceptual nature of the
axioms and the possibility of formulating different hypotheses when it comes to
physical space (Klein, some of the positions advocated by the Peano School, and
Cassirer). In the twentieth century, it became common usage to refer to axioms as
deﬁnitions in disguise (Poincaré) or implicit deﬁnitions (Hilbert, Schlick) of geo-
metrical concepts as objects, whose existence depends solely on the coherence of
the system of relations established by the axioms.
To sum up, with the advancement of the axiomatic method, geometrical
empiricism lost its signiﬁcance for a clariﬁcation of the questions concerning the
origin and meaning of geometrical axioms. It became ever more clear that an
appropriate understanding of how axioms work in modern mathematics presup-
poses a sharp separation between geometries as axiomatic systems and interpreted
geometry or the theory of space and space-time. However, the tradition discussed
above remained an important reference in the debate concerning physical and
philosophical interpretations of the mathematical structures under consideration.
In order to highlight this point, the following section discusses the related
problem of establishing geometrical and physical invariants.

1.3
Invariants and Symmetries
The ﬁrst characterization of geometrical objects in terms of invariants of transfor-
mation groups goes back to Felix Klein’s “Vergleichende Betrachtungen über
neuere geometrische Forschungen” [21], which is best known as “Erlanger Pro-
gramm,” after Klein’s appointment as Professor at the University of Erlanger in the
same year. An essential contribution to the implementation of such a research
program is found in Sophus Lie’s Theorie der Transformationsgruppen, which
appeared in three volumes between 1888 and 1893.9 The third volume contains a
critique of Helmholtz’s mathematical reasoning, along with the theorem that
became the standard derivation of a metric of constant curvature from a set of
necessary and sufﬁcient assumptions about inﬁnitesimal free mobility.
The fundamental ideas of the group-theoretical approach emerged from the
observation that some geometrical properties are invariant under speciﬁc types of
geometrical transformations. Such congruent displacements as translations, for
example, leave invariant parallelism, lengths and measure of angles. In modern
terminology, these are called the invariants of the Euclidean group. However, the
same invariants might not be preserved by other transformations. Collineations in
projective (and non-Euclidean) geometry, for example, leave invariant such prop-
erties as, of three or more points: to lie on the same line; of curves: to be a conic.
But such transformations are known to alter such invariants of the Euclidean group
as parallelism and absolute measurements.
Klein arrived at the idea of a group-theoretical classiﬁcation of geometry by
applying the basic notions of the algebraic theory of groups introduced by Evariste
Galois and Camille Jordan to projective geometry—which ﬂourished in the nine-
teenth century after the works of Jean-Victor Poncelet, Jakob Steiner, Christian von
Staudt, and Arthur Cayley, among others.10 Transformations form a group if: (i) the
product of any two elements of the group also belongs to the group; (ii) there is in
the group a neutral element (i.e., an element that leaves the other elements
unchanged when combined with them); (iii) for every transformation in the group,
there is in the group the inverse transformation.
Such mathematicians as Klein, Lie, and Poincaré showed that the same notions
offered a general point of view for the comparison of geometrical researches. The
signiﬁcance of their classiﬁcatory ideas lies not least in the fact that the same ideas
offered a point of comparison between different physical theories. Klein [25], for
example, used the same approach to account for the shift from classical mechanics
to special relativity. Whereas Galilean transformations preserve the invariant
quantities of Newtonian mechanics (i.e., acceleration, force, mass, and therefore
time, length, and simultaneity), the Lorentz transformations preserve the velocity of
light, but not length and time (simultaneity).

Rowe [23].

The shift from special to general relativity seems to mark a break with this
tradition, insofar as the space-time of general relativity is variably curved, the local
value of curvature depending on the distribution of mass and energy, as ﬁrst sug-
gested by Riemann’s conjecture. In the context of general relativity, such a cor-
relation between space, time, and matter followed from Einstein’s theory of
gravitation. It is worth noting that, nevertheless, Einstein attached much importance
to Helmholtz’s interpretation of non-Euclidean geometry via the free mobility of
rigid bodies for the development of his own ideas. In Einstein [26] he claimed that,
without the view of geometry set forth by Helmholtz, he would have been unable to
formulate the theory of relativity. But how are we to understand this comparison?
Not only did Einstein’s general relativity presuppose a different mathematical
approach for the determination of the measure of curvature, but it implied a different
concept of space. By considering hypotheses other than Euclidean geometry in the
characterization of physical space, Helmholtz conceived of space as an object of
research, whose properties can be determined empirically, to the required degree of
approximation. In general relativity it became impossible to ask about the geo-
metrical structure of space or space-time per se, insofar as geometrical properties
depend on the distribution of matter. In classical mechanics and special relativity,
the idea of space and time as objects endowed with a particular structure depends on
the fact that inertial systems provide a privileged frame of reference. By contrast,
Einstein’s principle of relativity—in its various formulations—presupposes that the
laws of physics apply to systems in any kind of motion. One of the conditions for
this is that the form of natural laws remains unchanged under arbitrary changes of
space-time values or general covariance. As Einstein [27, p. 117] put it, general
covariance “takes away from space and time the last remnant of physical objec-
tivity.” Space-time coincidences, on the other hand, become fully objective in the
sense of independence from the observer’s perspective.
Einstein’s claim has been much discussed at that time and in more recent lit-
erature.11 The concluding section of this paper deals with Weyl’s and Cassirer’s
interpretations as two different ways to account for the transformation of the con-
cept of space from geometrical empiricism to general relativity and to provide new
answers to the question concerning subjective and objective aspects of knowledge.

Subjectivity and Objectivity
1.4.1
Hermann Weyl
Hermann Weyl was both a great mathematician, whose contributions ranged from
analysis, algebra, topology, differential geometry, and fundamental physics, and
one of the few philosopher-scientists of the twentieth century to defend a Kantian
11For a discussion of different positions, see Norton [28] and Ryckman [29].

F. Biagioli

conception of space in line with Husserl’s phenomenological approach to the a
priori.12 In his main work on the general theory of relativity, Raum-Zeit-Materie,
which appeared in four editions between 1918 and 1921, Weyl [30, p. 98])
accounted for the shift to the new theory by saying that the space of general
relativity “is nothing more than a three-dimensional manifold devoid of all form; it
acquires a deﬁnite form only through the advent of the material content ﬁlling it and
determining its metric relations.” With reference to his metrical inﬁnitesimal
geometry, nevertheless, Weyl argued that the empirical determination of metrical
relations did not rule out the possibility of a priori knowledge, insofar as the
borderline between a priori and a posteriori was set somewhere else. In Weyl’s
account: whereas the metric at a point P, along with the metrical relation of P to its
neighboring points, is everywhere the same and retains the status of an a priori
condition of experience, the mutual orientation of the metrics in different points is a
posteriori.
In Raum-Zeit-Materie, Weyl advocated a phenomenological conception of the a
priori in order to deal with problem of coordination. Referring to Einstein’s remark
about general covariance, Weyl [30, p. 8] wrote: “[T]he objectivity of things
conferred by the exclusion of the ego and its data derived directly from intuition, is
not entirely satisfactory; the co-ordinate system which can only be speciﬁed by an
individual act (and then only approximately) remains as an inevitable residuum of
this elimination of the percipient.” Whereas Einstein focused on the objectivity
achieved in general relativity when it comes to determine space-time coincidences,
Weyl’s emphasis is on the fact that a residuum of subjectivity still plays the role of a
necessary presupposition for the setting of the coordinate system. In other words,
Weyl vindicated the Kantian conception of space as a source of knowledge by
identifying the minimal phenomenological structure that is required for space-time
coordination.
1.4.2
Ernst Cassirer
Ernst Cassirer started his career as one of the leading ﬁgures of the Marburg School
of neo-Kantianism and became known as the founder of the philosophy of symbolic
forms.13 This contained one of the most promising attempts in twentieth-century
philosophy to develop a uniﬁed perspective on human culture, including natural
and social sciences, the humanities, and the arts as different expressions of the
subject/object relation. Cassirer identiﬁed a range of different symbolic forms in
which such a relation can be articulated. The broader scope of this view notwith-
standing, one of Cassirer’s starting point is found in his 1921 book Zur
12See Ryckman [29, Chaps. 5 and 6].

forms, see Ferrari [31].

Einstein’schen Relativitätstheorie. Commenting on the signiﬁcance of general
covariance for the formulation of Einstein’s principle of relativity, Cassirer
observed that general relativity conﬁrmed the tendency of every physical theory to
abstract from what is immediately given in perception in order to gain the appro-
priate conceptual expression and understanding of the facts of experience. As
Duhem [32, p. 322] put it, in order to provide the basis for the development of
physical theory, empirical facts have to be transformed and put into a “symbolic
form.”
Regarding the spatial order of experience as a symbolic form, even before
general relativity Cassirer emphasized that the mathematical concept of space
provides a combination of different hypotheses. He referred, in particular, to the
classic cases of manifolds of constant curvature investigated by Helmholtz, Klein,
and Lie. Despite the difference between these cases and the variably curved
space-time of general relativity, Cassirer argued for a further generalization of the
previous system of hypotheses in order to attain to complete objectivity in facing
the problem of coordination. His interpretation focused on the fact that, by gen-
eralizing the principle of relativity, Einstein needed not single out any privileged
systems of reference.
Without entering into the details of Cassirer’s interpretation, for my present
purpose I limit myself to point out that the example of Einstein’s space-time theory
played an important role in Cassirer’s conception of his own philosophical project.
He wrote in his concluding chapter on the problem of redeﬁning physical reality in
symbolic terms rather than as absolute reality: “It is the task of systematic phi-
losophy, which extends far beyond the theory of knowledge, to free the idea of the
world from this one-sidedness. It has to grasp the whole system of symbolic forms,
the application of which produces for us the concept of an ordered reality, and by
virtue of which subject and object, ego and world are separated and opposed to each
other in deﬁnite form, and it must refer each individual in this totality to its ﬁxed
place” (Cassirer [33], p. 447).
The relevant point for my brief comparison with Weyl is that Cassirer articulated
a different strategy for vindicating the core ideas of the Kantian theory of space.
Instead of identifying the a priori of space as a subjective, but necessary source of
knowledge, Cassirer investigated the different ways in which the concept of a
spatial order is used to articulate the subject/object relation in anthropological,
scientiﬁc, and artistic contexts. A number of examples are found in Cassirer’s main
works on the philosophy of symbolic forms. A very clear characterization of this
approach for a wider audience is found in his 1931 paper [34] “Mythischer,
ästhetischer und theoretischer Raum,” which was delivered during the fourth
Congress für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft in Hamburg. In this paper,
he argued that the variety of spatial concepts notwithstanding, space as a symbolic
form is characterized by its purely relational nature, which is a necessary precon-
dition for the determination of things and meanings. Cassirer referred, for example,
to the mythical signiﬁcance of spatial orientation in ancient myths and in religious
representations of the afterlife. The example of spatial and temporal concepts in the
12

arts shows even more clearly the potential of the symbolic forms in inventing a new
constellation of meanings.
In Cassirer’s view, the clariﬁcation of the symbolic function of space and time in
modern physics opened the door to looking at these concepts from different per-
spectives, while deepening Kant’s insight into the nature of space and time as
orders of appearance rather than perceived objects. However, Cassirer’s proposal is
not to return to Kant’s original view of space as a source of knowledge, but to
investigate how thought can anticipate experience in virtue of the creative and
hypothetical character of our systems of concepts. My suggestion is that the phi-
losophy of symbolic forms offers an original synthesis between the two opposed
ways to consider space as a source and an object of knowledge. As Cassirer [33],
p. 426) put it, empiricism and idealism meet in certain presuppositions with regard
to the doctrine of empirical space and of empirical time: “Both here grant to
experience the decisive role, and both teach that every exact measurement pre-
supposes universal empirical laws.”

Time in Physics and Time in Awareness

2.1
Introduction
Time is a part of our immediate awareness. We come across it as duration without
necessarily attributing a measure to it; as sequencing with the notion of “before”
and “after” between pairs of “events”; as a cyclic variable related to some natural
process like the diurnal cycle—morning, noon, evening, midnight or like the pulse
or heartbeat or the ticking of the clock. The time labelling astronomical events looks
the same whether things are going forward or backward while time labelling the
germination, growth, maturity, decline and perishing of a plant or animal does look
diﬀerent and strange backwards.
This megalomorphian zoology of time is reﬂected both in our language and in
our science. We talk of “this time tomorrow” or “whenever I am afraid I become
confused” in which we embed a cyclic process in a well ordered time. We will return
to cyclic time later.
2.2
Durational Time in Mechanics; Linear and Cyclic Time
In mechanics processes are described in time and the laws of motion pertain to rates
of change with respect to time. While time ab initio is deﬁned in a bizarre fashion by
Newton as “ﬂowing uniformly” it is deﬁnition without content since ﬂowing requires
something else with respect to which this ﬂow is measured! Further how does one

recognize the ﬂow of time? It is like asking “Where does this road go?” meaning
thereby where do people, vehicles and objects traversing the road go—the road does
not go anywhere!
A practical measure of time is obtained by observing the change in conﬁguration
of a physical system that is believed to be “moving” uniformly. It becomes acceptable
since many such physical systems exist and the time as measured by each of these
coincide more or less. It could be the pulsations of a quartz crystal or of radio fre-
quency electromagnetic wave. For longer measures of time we could use the change
of seasons, the ebb and ﬂow of tides, sunrise and sunset. We could use as a rough and
ready reckoning our heartbeats or the hunger or sleep cycle. For precision measure-
ments we could use a precise system like quartz crystal or an isolated atom—to the
extent that these are uniform we could expect that time as measured by them would
all give a measure of “true time”.
The ﬁrst law of motion asserts that an isolated body has a constant rate of change
of position, an uniform motion. So, to the extent that we have isolated bodies and
to the extent that we can keep it in the view, the measurement of time is reduced to
a measurement of distance. The time so measured is a linear time or, rather, only a
segment of it since the uniformly moving body was not in our vicinity either for a
very early time or for very late time. By extending our method of length measurement
to greater distances we could measure a longer segment of time: longer but still ﬁnite.
If the motion is not uniform but still the departure from uniformity is known
we can correct for the variation and determine the “uniformly ﬂowing” time. Use a
sundial shadow to measure time on a sunny day is a familiar example. A cheap clock
gains time in cold weather and loses time in hot weather; if we know the temperature
and thermal expansion of the pendulum suspender we could determine the correct
time.
In contrast to linear time most clocks are cyclic. The ﬁrst example is the motion
of planets around the sun, where the line joining the planet to the sun describes
equal areas in equal times (that is, constant areal velocity). So if we measure the area
described (for a purely circular orbit this is proportional to the angular displacement)
we can measure the time elapsed.
For times longer than a complete revolution we need to count the number of com-
plete revolutions together with the angular displacement. The same is true if we are
using the oscillations of a pendulum (or the days spent in conﬁnement). Now the
counters that we have are usually cyclic, though the complete cycle is a long time.
Most wrist chronometers indicate time in seconds (or fractions thereof), minutes,
hours, days and months. We could build a calender that goes over a century or a mil-
lennium. But eventually, like the odometer of a Volvo, the counter will recycle! We
can extend the period as much as we want by having more digits on the counter; but
any ﬁnite system conﬁguration reading time must be cyclic. Linear time going from
minus inﬁnity to plus inﬁnity is an abstraction. When quantum theory is invoked, this
cyclicity can be proved based on the positivity of the energy of any isolated system.

2.3
Metric Time and Its Relation to Symmetry Principles
The use of linear and of angular motion for measuring time by comparison of con-
ﬁgurations (linear position and angular orientation respectively) is not accidental but
due to certain symmetry requirement on physical laws for an “isolated” system. The
quantity of linear motion (“momentum”) and of angular motion (“angular momen-
tum”) of an isolated body should be unchanged with respect to time if the physical
laws governing the system are to be unchanged by change in spatial location or by
change in angular orientation. These are part of relativity laws of Newton-Galileo
Mechanics. They are based on our ideas of homogeneity and isotropy of our space.
To give a measure of time (“metrizing” time) we need to invoke yet another phys-
ical quantity that is also invariant stemming from another symmetry, that is the irrel-
evance of the epoch in which we study a physical system. For a known “particle” (an
isolated body whose structure can be disregarded for describing the motion) given its
mass and its energy we can determine the momentum which is also mass times veloc-
ity (in non-relativistic theory). Similarly for angular motion, given the “moment of
inertia” of the rotating system and its energy we could determine the angular veloc-
ity. In terms of knowing the angular velocity and the angular displacement we can
measure the time elapsed.
It is interesting to recognize that the determination of time elapsed can be even
more intimately related to the principle of relativity if we have also the requirement
that laws of physics should be unchanged when one goes from one inertial frame
to another inertial frame; including the one which moves uniformly with respect to
another.
The quantity that is associated with this invariance (and in a technical sense,
generating this transformation) is a quantity called the mechanical moment. This
quantity increases linearly with respect to time, the coeﬃcient of increase being the
momentum. Thus time elapsed is the ratio of the change in the mechanical moment
divided by the momentum. This general form of metrization is valid even when Ein-
stein’s relativity has to be used. We can work out a similar relation between the ratio
of the generator of changes in angular velocity and the angular momentum. The times
so deﬁned are the same for all (isolated) systems.
There is thus an intimate relation between elapsed time measured by the compar-
ison of conﬁgurations and the basic principles governing the laws of motion. Since
conﬁgurations (spatial location or angular orientation) involves comparison between
something ﬁxed and something moving, there must be parts, that is structure in a
physical system used as a measuring instrument of time in addition to the instru-
ment for measuring position or orientation. The time measured in all these cases
is “duration” which is metrized as described above. Nothing has “happened”: the
motion could be reversed without our ﬁnding anything diﬀerent from the forward
motion. Forwards and backwards do not have anything intrinsically diﬀerent though
by conventions we could make some distinction as for example a clock that goes
anti clockwise. [Is a clock that goes anticlockwise a clock or an anticlock?] This
mechanical time has no “sense”.

2.4
Irreversibility and Historical Time
Our usual experience (in the waking state!) is with a “sense” of time. In fact much
more than metric time, our time is a directed time in which a temporal order is
imposed on our experiences. We have memory of the past but not of the future; and
we distinguish the distant past from our recent past. Our internal measure of time is
not very reliable but our temporarily sequencing is generally very good. When we
look outside for evidence of this sequencing we ﬁnd many processes with such time
sense. Trees grow, rivers and wind erode land, ice melts and hot coﬀee cools. Light
bulbs and candles shed light, broadcasting antennas and stars radiate, our bodies age.
There is a curious connection with a class of physical processes involving heat.
We know that mechanical energy can be converted into heat: after a cold shower on
a cool day we rub ourselves vigorously with a towel! But if we use heat to do mech-
anised work as in a steam engine we can convert only a part of the heat. Of all such
“heat engines” the most eﬃcient are reversible engines and even they are only par-
tially eﬃcient. The irreversible processes seem to declare that time is some intrinsic
change, a degradation of energy. This is the second law of thermodynamics. The irre-
versible changes increase a quantity called entropy. Thermal equilibrium states have
the maximum entropy under these conditions. All natural evolutions seem either to
increase entropy (irreversible processes) or keep it unchanged (reversible processes).
Natural evolution is towards thermal equilibrium, towards increasing entropy.
Irreversible processes have a sense of time and run backwards they look bizarre
and whether it would be a splash in pond converging towards a point from which
a stone is ejected or a dead body becoming alive and growing younger by the day.
Candles don’t grow absorbing candlelight converging on it (though sometimes we
feel rejuvenated). Time as history relates to irreversible processes and the “second
law of thermodynamics”.
There is now a fundamental problem of relating historical directed time to dura-
tional (mechanical) undirected time. Undoubtedly irreversible process not only take
place but are the very mechanism of metabolism and nourishment for organisms and
lead to pattern formation and structure in physical systems. But if mechanics is at the
basis of all physical laws how can we obtain the observable irreversibility based on
a reversible mechanics? This is an old problem of physics. There has been repeated
attempts at solution, the latest being based on the “mixing” or “chaotic” behavior of
complex dynamical systems.
In an irreversible system as a rule transient structures arise, which are called
“dissipative structures” by Prigogine. Familiar examples are singing telegraph wires
(aeolian tones) arising out of eddy viscosity as wind blows past a highly stretched
wire, the dancing brilliance of gas jet (or candle) that is about to get extinguished or
the wild oscillations of a bridge about to collapse. But the most familiar one is the
generation of metastable states and a deﬁnite lifetime: like the excited states of an
atom or a radioactive nucleus. In the domain of high energy physics most particles

2

19
are unstable. The regularity of decay law tells us that this law itself could be used as
a clock—the fraction of the surviving particles depends experimentally on the time
elapsed. Historical time and durational time can be compared.
2.5
The Birth of Time
Does time have a beginning? In Newtonain physics time has no beginning and
no end. Somewhat like Melchi-Zadek (Who came to bless Abraham and to whom
Abraham paid tithe) had no beginning and no genealogy! But like Newtonian time,
Melchi-Zadek was also an idealization. We must think of Jacob, Abraham’s grandson
who had to operate in the phenomenal world. What about time around us?
All around us we see irreversible processes. Candles burn, food gets eaten and
digested; and most of the phenomena around us are dictated by the generous supply
of energy from the sun. Energy is being continually degraded; entropy is increasing
and all the processes around us are maintained by this steady ﬂow of solar energy.
Has it always been so and will it always be so? Surely not, if we recognize that
the sun will burn down in a ﬁnite time. Even without knowing the mechanism of
the sun’s energy we can conclude, along with Olbers, that if sun and the stars are
uniformly distributed throughout space and they had all existed for an inﬁnitely long
time then the night sky couldn’t be dark. There would be equilibrium. The sun and
stars would not emit or absorb. This simple but profound observation ties time to
Cosmology.
As soon as we talk of cosmology we have to ask are the principles of homogeneity
and isotropy, of time invariance and equivalence of uniformly moving physical sys-
tems really true? Could not, for example, physical laws depend on the cosmological
epoch? Did the universe have a beginning of time? What does it mean? The present
view generally held by cosmologists is that universe is evolving.
If things are changing in time the measurement of time is going to get tricky.
Instead of considering time we can consider its square, its logarithm or any function
that suits our fancy. Milne, in his kinematic relativity chooses the logarithm so that
the origin of the new time has gone to minus inﬁnity. More generally in relativistic
cosmology space and time are not ﬁxed but become dynamical variables: the space-
time manifold obeys equations of motion; and the origin of our present version of
the universe could be explosive singularity called the “Big Bang”.
How does quantum mechanics alter all this? In quantum dynamics also one dis-
tinguishes the reversible evolution for isolated systems and the irreversible processes
of external interference on the quantum system. The measurement of time becomes
somewhat more subtle but it can be done. One conclusion was already mentioned
only cyclic time can be strictly measured by a quantum clock, but survival probabil-
ities do give a measure of linear time in an approximate manner.

2.6
Causation and Time Sequence
Closely related to the idea of temporal succession and temporary duration is the
notion of causation. Causes and eﬀects are interrelated; this interrelation is the
essence of dynamical dependence, of the very notion of describability. But while
this relation is symmetric in reversible processes it is asymmetric and directed in
irreversible processes; the eﬀect is dependent on the cause and later while the cause
is earlier and alterable. It is this scheme of describing nature and the correspondence
with our memory in normal waking state, that makes it natural for us to view time
as being directed and historical.
In this vein, let us ask if our awareness alters the structure of time, clearly when
we are in deep sleep we have no components to our awareness and hence no conﬁg-
uration. Therefore time itself is not! In normal waking state we are generally aware
of historical time but there are contexts in which we are aware of duration but not of
historicity. Times of intense creativity or total absorption in the task, of deep peace
in which we do things like breathing or walking or even driving without the instruc-
tion of historical time, being immersed in music or times of meditative awareness in
which texture of time seems to alter historical and durational times seem to coexist.
And in dreams our experience of time is such that linear and cyclic times, reversible
and irreversible time all coexist. Sometimes it is as if the irreversible sequence of
events have been reversed.
There are some people who say that the “arrow of time” (the directed sense of
time) stems from the expanding universe. The “Big Bang” and the consequent expan-
sion of spacetime dominates the functioning of the physical law and all the universe
and hence each part of it feels this all-pervading time sense. Since the creation of the
perceived physical structures and even the synthesis of chemical elements is subse-
quent to “Big Bang” we may state this as saying the arrow of time is as old as matter
itself; that rather than irreversible time originating in the interactions of complex
systems they all had the same origin, the “Big Bang”. It is reversible mechanics and
its durational time that is the idealization.
2.7
Perception of Time: Archetypes and Artifacts
So far we have talked about the time in the physical sciences. When we come to the
perception of time our archetypes and the very nature of our awareness are relevant.
Three of these archetypes have already been alluded to: That of a “uniformly ﬂow-
ing” linear time and both durational and historical processes embedded in it. This
is at the base of our waking awareness and is the one used in physical science. The
second is closed cyclic loops of time which contain aspects of the waking state but
in which time loses its “sense”. The topology of time and space is altered. This is
the time of our dreams and of our poetry and the ﬁne arts. Third is the structureless
duration of deep (dreamless) sleep in which there are no conﬁgurations to demarcate

2

time. But there is a transcendent fourth, in which all the previous “times” coexist
without clashing and all seen as artifacts. This is the creative time of contemplative
awareness in which the rising and dissolution of historical time, the multiple cycles
of cyclic time and duration itself maybe comprehended. While this is part of every
person’s awareness it has not yet found a place in physical science. To freely adapt a
stanza from Ramayana:
Transcendence of the limited renders time a chariot;
In limitation, are causes and eﬀects;
Know that in harmony is pristine existence;
Go forth in well being and joy!

The earliest source of our knowledge of Ancient Indian perceptions of space and
time is the Ṛgveda, one of the most ancient monuments of Indo-European liturgical
poetry, a collection of hymns dedicated to different deities of the Vedic pantheon,
and the oldest of the 4 Vedas (c. 1200–1000 BCE). In this paper we attempt to
reconstruct Vedic views on time and space (information found in different layers of
Vedic texts is fragmentary and therefore needs to be extracted and systematized)
and then show historical development of these ideas, from the Ṛgveda to the latest
texts of the Vedic tradition (Upaniṣads, c. 500 BCE) and then to the epics (ﬁrst of
all, the Mahābhārata).

3.1
Time in the Ṛgveda
We do not ﬁnd any mention of time in abstracto in the Ṛgveda. The word kāla that
is the most common term for denoting the abstract notion of time in the later
tradition is used in the Ṛgveda only once, in RV 10.42.9,1 a hymn that belongs to a
later stratum of the text. The word kāla (kāle—Loc. Sg. from kāla, “in [a moment
of] time”) in this stanza denotes the proper moment to throw the dice to win the
perfect score (kṛta), i.e., it is rather a speciﬁc “proper instant” than a general/abstract
notion. Another word that means “time” in the later texts—samaya—is not used in
the Ṛgveda at all.
Although the Ṛgveda has no unifying term for time as a general notion, it seems
that all major Indian ideas and concepts of time developed in the later tradition
originate there: ﬁrst and foremost, it is the idea of two types of time or two times—
the ﬁrst is time-eternity, and the second one is transitory, “concrete”, or “profane”
time. The Ṛgveda also has the seeds of a view that time is the Lord of the universe
that regulates and even creates it.
A word that denotes this all-powerful time-eternity in the Ṛgveda is the year
(saṃvatsara). In one of the cosmogonic hymns of the 10th maṇḍala (RV 10.190) it
is stated that “the Year (saṃvatsara) that dispenses days and nights” was produced
“out of the foaming ocean”.2 It is clear from the hymn that this foaming or
undulating ocean is, in fact, cosmic ocean that symbolizes the universe in its
unordered and chaotic state (thus, according to Schayer, the year is “the ﬁrst pro-
duct out of Cosmic Waters”3). Before the cosmic ocean there was only “the kindled
heat” (tapas) that gave birth to the Cosmic Order (ṛta) and Truth/Reality (satya),
and then “the night (rātri) was born”.4 From the night the cosmic ocean is pro-
duced, and then—the year. The night here is not simply a period of day but rather
the impenetrable primordial darkness before creation.
The Year in this hymn is called “the Lord of everything that blinks”,5 i.e., of the
living. After the year is born, the universe changes its state from chaotic into
organized. It becomes ordered; elements of creation—the sun and the moon, hea-
ven and earth, interspace (antarikṣa) and sunlight appear and become properly
arranged “according to the order” by someone who is called “the Arranger”
(dhātṛ).6 This Arranger might be the Year itself or an epithet of one of the Vedic
deities, such as Prajāpati, however, it is clear that only with the creation of the year
there appears a force that organizes the universe and, functionally, creates it.

This hymn is probably one of the earliest mythological expressions of an idea
that time organizes space and arranges phenomena of the created universe.
In the Ṛgveda we also observe the origin of another important concept found in
various later texts, such as the epics and the Purāṇas, that of the wheel of time (kāla-
cakra). In different verses of the famous riddle hymn RV 1.164 (the “asya
vāmasya” hymn) there is a vivid description of a single-wheeled chariot7 of the sun
whose wheel “rolls around heaven” (varvarti … pari dyām). It is stated that the
wheel is “undecaying” (or “unaging”8) and “unobstractable”,9 therefore it simul-
taneously covers both temporal and spatial domain and is unbound in either of
them. It is “twelve-spoked”10 or “ﬁve-spoked”11; it is called “the one [with] twelve
segments or fellies”12 in a different stanza of the hymn; it has “three naves”13; it
bears “pairs of seven hundred twenty sons” and is compared to their “father who
has ﬁve feet and twelve parts, the overﬂowing one in the upper half of heaven”.14
All living beings (or, in a different interpretation, all worlds—bhuvanāni viśvā)
“stand on it” and are “ﬁxed (or dependent) upon it”15; it also has “three hundred …
and sixty pegs”.16
Although the quoted hymn is a riddle and nothing is stated directly, it can be
deduced what different elements of the wheel mean and what the whole wheel
symbolizes. Twelve spokes of the wheel, as well as its twelve segments or fellies
are the twelve months. Five spokes and ﬁve feet signify the ﬁve seasons (Vedic
tradition distinguishes either ﬁve or six seasons); the “three naves” are the three
major seasons (every 4 months), associated with solemn Vedic rituals; “three
hundred … and sixty pegs” are the days of the year, whereas “pairs of seven
hundred twenty sons” are days and nights of the year. The whole wheel hence
represents a year. It is a wheel of the year that rolls in heaven and carries all beings
or worlds. It is closely associated with the sun and the moon (“overﬂowing one in
the upper half of heaven”) and its path is the path of the sun.
Remarkably, this wheel is called in the hymn “the wheel of Cosmic Order
(ṛta)”,17 therefore the year is equated to ṛta—a cornerstone notion of the Vedic
worldview that we provisionally translate as “Cosmic Order”. This term is rather
difﬁcult to translate due to its richness and importance for the Vedic culture: not
only it signiﬁes the Cosmic Order and organizing principle of the universe, but also

the Truth18 and (to some extent) social organization and religious law. If we
consider the functions of ṛta in the Ṛgveda, we can see that, ﬁrst of all, it regulates
and arranges everything and serves as a foundation of the universe. It is said that
Mitra and Varuṇa “govern the universe by means of ṛta” (RV 5.63.7); the gods are
“strong through ṛta” (RV 1.106.3 and in many other verses); rivers ﬂow to Varuṇa’s
ṛta (RV 2.28.4); Varuṇa, the guardian of ṛta, “spread out the threefold earth by
means of ṛta” (RV 4.42.4); Uṣas, the dawn, appears in the sky every day because
she “doesn’t violate ṛta” (RV 1.123.9), she “follows the path of ṛta” (RV 1.124.3);
by ṛta “the nourishments are moved far”, for ṛta “the earth [and heaven] are wide
and deep” (RV 4.23.9-10); “Agni… stretched heaven and earth by means of ṛta”
(RV 5.1.7), and so on. By ṛta the rivers ﬂow, the sun goes up and down, the wind
blows; by means of ṛta it rains; generations of people are born and destroyed; ṛta is
the means to overcome obstacles and achieve success; the day follows the night and
one year follows another one, etc. To sum up, the universe functions because of ṛta.
It establishes the order of events and governs the space-time continuum.
It is germane at this point to note that the word ṛta etymologically stems from the
Indo–European root *-ar that has a wide range of meanings, including “to connect,
to build, to order”; “to ﬁt together”.19 From this root originates a plethora of words
used (usually, in their secondary meaning) to denote various aspects of time in
different Indo-European languages, for example, Avestan ratu—“a period of time”,
Latin articulus—“moment” and artus—“narrow in space or time”, Old Greek ἄρτι
and Armenian ard—both meaning “just now, currently”, Greek ἁμαρτήas—“si-
multaneous”,20 as well as another Vedic word related to time—ṛtu that in the later
tradition means mostly a season but in the Ṛgveda it is rather “proper time/proper
moment” or, speciﬁcally, a “[proper] time of a sacriﬁce”. Signiﬁcantly, from the
same root stems the Sanskrit word ara—a spoke of a wheel or of an altar formed
like a wheel, in the epics—a spoke of the time-wheel, and one of the divisions of
time in the Jaina tradition. All the aforementioned words have meanings associated
with ﬁtting something together (i.e., articulus and artus mean “a joint, connection”,
etc.) and some of them have connotations related to rightness (i.e., Greek ἄρτι).
From these parallels we can conclude that a relationship of Vedic ṛta with time and
the wheel of time (the wheel of year in this case) is not accidental. Although we
cannot say that ṛta is time, it is deﬁnitely on some older Indo–European level
related to time both etymologically and functionally. It organizes the universe,
creates a sequence of events, and exerts its power over all living beings. As we will
see, in the later tradition these are the functions of time. Also, just like the year in
the discussed creation hymn, ṛta is very much connected to the Cosmic Waters.21
Both the Year and Ṛta, the Cosmic Order, represent time-eternity that regulates and
arranges the universe in the Ṛgveda.
18This meaning was proposed by Lüders; see [5], II: 402–406.
19See Watkins [19]: 5.
20See Pokorny [8]: 174–178.
21See Lüders [5], II: 402–406.

N. Yanchevskaya and M. Witzel

Apart from the time-eternity, there are several terms in the Ṛgveda that denote
the “concrete” transitory time and its units. The Ṛgveda contains multiple refer-
ences to the progress of time: again, the year (saṃvatsara, vatsara, etc.), the
seasons (śarad, varṣa, hemanta, vasanta, etc.), month (mās), day, night, lunar
asterisms (nakṣatra) that are used to calculate the lunar months of 27/28 days.
People obviously were very well aware of the passing of time with designations for
dawn, dusk, days and ominous nights (those that are “weaving their cloth alter-
nately”); they were even aware of (undetermined) previous and future “ages”, the
yugas (RV 7.86), and of personal time, including stages of life, especially aging:
one is wished to live “a 100 years,” and indeed, one person is mentioned as having
lived 116 years. Personal time is connected to the “objective” time: for example, it
is said that Uṣas, the dawn, whose daily appearance in the sky signiﬁes the passage
of time, “diminishes human generations”22 and “shortens the lifetime of the
mortals”.23
Accurate observations of the passage of time over the year were necessary to
carry out rituals properly: the technical term for a priest was ṛtv-ij “the one who
offers according to season/at a proper moment”—a derivation from the above-
mentioned ṛtu. The term ṛtu is the closest that the Ṛgveda has to the general
deﬁnition of transitory time (interestingly, Sāyaṇa, the commentator of the Ṛgveda,
in his commentary explains ṛtu by using the word kāla, time24): it can mean a
[proper] moment, or a proper time, a season, a time ﬁt for the sacriﬁce, and so on.
Ṛta and ṛtu being cognates that stem, as explained above, from the Indo-European
verbal root *-ar, make an interesting pair: from one of them (ṛta) probably origi-
nates the idea of time-eternity, while from the second one (ṛtu) likely does the
concept of transitory time whose passage can be observed and calculated.
One of the earliest in the Indian tradition mythological descriptions of creation of
time-space continuum (although, of course, it is not conceptualized in these terms in
the text) is also found in the Ṛgveda, in the famous Puruṣasūkta hymn (RV 10.90)
of the Xth maṇḍala. Cosmic giant Puruṣa is sacriﬁced to himself and/or to the gods
(who are, however, created as a result of this sacriﬁce), and different elements of the
universe are produced out of his body. Puruṣa contains all space (mythological
equivalent of space in this hymn is earth) and even more than that: “Having
covered the earth from all sides, he extended beyond [it] by ten ﬁngers”25; “he
surpassed the earth from front and from behind”.26 Consequently, the whole uni-
verse—all parts of space and all beings in that space—is created from his sacriﬁced
body: the sun and the moon; the wind and the cardinal points; heaven, earth, and
interspace; the gods (Indra, Agni, etc.) and living beings. Vedic hymns, poetic
meters, sacriﬁcial formulas, and the four social classes (varṇa) are also born from
22praminatī manuṣyā yugāni (RV 1.124.2).

Puruṣa’s body. Not only Puruṣa covers all space, but also he encompasses the two
types of time:
Puruṣa alone is all this – what has been and what is to be. And he is lord of immortality,
because he overgrows [the universe] by means of food.27
This stanza demonstrates that Puruṣa contains the past and the future (“what has
been and what is to be”), i.e., all changeable/transitory time. He is also called “the
lord of immortality”, i.e., he belongs to the realm of eternity and transcends passing
time of this world “by means of food”. This expression is a way to show that as an
“eater” of the universe Puruṣa dominates it. Food in this case can be understood as
sacriﬁcial food that feeds the ancestors: Puruṣa is the ultimate ancestor who never
runs out of sacriﬁcial food, because his food is the whole world and he himself is
the whole world, thus he is immortal. Puruṣa is the ﬁrst ancestor, and all future
generations will sacriﬁce and be sacriﬁced to him always while this world exists.
Interestingly, the past and the future in the stanza are clearly contrasted with
immortality: they are mentioned together as items that are related, however, it is
emphasized that they are different and belong to separate realms. In other words,
although there is no clear “philosophical” statement of a concept of two types of
time (transitory time and time-eternity), here we observe its formation by mytho-
logical and poetic means.
Next stanza states that Puruṣa is not only the lord, but also a receptacle of
immortality:
One quarter of him is all beings. Three quarters of him – immortality in heaven.28
Later in the hymn we ﬁnd additional temporal terms (time-divisions) that play a
role in the sacriﬁce of Puruṣa. The seasons are elements of sacriﬁce (sacriﬁcial
butter, wood and oblation) and, because Puruṣa contains everything, they are also
parts of Puruṣa:
When the gods put forth the sacriﬁce with Puruṣa as the offering, spring was its melted
butter, summer was the ﬁrewood, autumn was the oblation.29
Thus, time (in the form of the seasons) is seen as a means of Puruṣa’s sacriﬁce
and, consequently, a means in the act of creation, a power of creation, so to speak.
To sum up, in the form of mythological motifs and poetic expressions, this hymn
introduces the following principal ideas concerning time and space:
• Time and space are interconnected, there is time-space continuum that is
embodied by the Cosmic Giant and created from his sacriﬁced body;

N. Yanchevskaya and M. Witzel

• In accordance with what was shown in our other examples, there are indications
that an idea of two types of time is being developed. Those two are
time-eternity, related to immortality, and transitory time manifested as various
time-units and states-in-time (i.e., past, present, and future);
• Time is necessary for creation. It is possible that time is a means of creation, a
power that creates.
Overall, we can see from the materials of the Ṛgveda that the text has no
designation for a unifying notion of time. However, it can be concluded from the
analysis of the hymns that the Ṛgvedic people were aware of “eternity” and
“temporality” and envisioned the two as both connected and distinct. From the
study of poetic metaphors and mythological motifs and images related to the
“temporal” and the “eternal”, from their position and relationship in the text, it can
be concluded that some kind of a notion that could unify “eternity” and “tempo-
rality” and relate “temporality” to different units and states was emerging, although
probably had not solidiﬁed enough to be used in the Ṛgveda to designate explicitly
a power or a god of ETERNITY/TEMPORALITY; they construed it as connected
with the movement of the sun and as a power that regulates the universe. Later, in
the Atharvaveda, when a uniﬁed designation of time (kāla) is introduced, archaic
myths and ideas expressed in the Ṛgveda become associated with this designation,
and from that period on an elaborate mythology of time rises that is shaped into
various “doctrines of time” during the philosophical period.
3.2
Time-Space Calculations and Ritual Time During
the Vedic Period
From the Vedic texts it is clear that the many solemn Vedic rituals are strictly
time-bound and liminal: they have to be carried out at daybreak, sunset, at new/full
moon, at the three major seasons (every 4 months), and yearly. Some of them
follow the yearly course of the sun from its rising point in the southeast in winter
(mahāvrata) to its rise in the northeast in summer (viṣuvant),30 thus at the time of
the two solstices. This apparent movement of the sun along the eastern horizon is
likened to a voyage of a ship, with resting points, “islands”, in between.
Temporal and spatial calculations (including that of true east) could be per-
formed by very simple means, such as marking the two solstice points by sticks in
the ground and taking half its distance as true east. This is important as the Vedic
sacriﬁcial ground, symbolizing sun (square), earth (round) and moon (halfmoon) as
the three sacred ﬁres, is oriented towards true east. Sacriﬁcial time and space are
thus closely linked.
30On the path of the sun see, for example, RV 5.81.4, cf. 1.115.3, AB 3.44.
3
Time and Space in Ancient India: Pre-philosophical Period
29

Close observations of both sun and moon were necessary to calculate when
various rituals are to be performed throughout the year. The solar year from one
winter solstice to the next, of c. 360 + 5 days with its 12 × 30-day months, does
not correspond to the lunar year of 336 days (28 × 12), with its lunar months
observed from one full moon to the next. A complex system of intercalary months
was soon created, that led to a system of 5-year cycles (samvatsra, idvatsara,
parivatsara, anuvatsara, and vatsara), ﬁrst systematically established in the Jyotiṣa
(date unclear, as it is composed in post-Vedic language, although it is often claimed
to date from around 1300 BCE). Post-Ṛgvedic texts contain standard sentences
such as “the year has 12 months” (of 30 days each) but also “…13 months” (that is
the short “month” of 5 days at the end of the 12 months in the solar year of
365 days.) The concurrent lunar year is divided into months, each of which has
27/28 named Nakṣatra constellations.
The human life cycle is equally bound to ritual time. A boy is initiated in his 7th
year, then studies for 12 years before getting married. Then, he has to perform,
along with his wife, a simpliﬁed set of rituals, notably the New and Full Moon rites,
but also those for the spring and fall harvests (of wheat, rice), others for pregnancy
and the birth of a (preferably) male child, followed by a ﬁxed set of rituals until
initiation.
Most prominent is a long series of death and anniversary rituals (śrāddha); they
begin with the rituals of the ﬁrst 12 days after death and extend to annual ones for
three generations of male and female ancestors. Individual ancestors are no longer
remembered as individuals, though certain famous persons are well recalled and
immortalized in verses. Reference to older and more recent deities, kings, ancestors,
and teachers is often made.
Clearly—different from what is often alleged—a sense of (distant) times is well
established, even though these are not set within a ﬁxed time frame, a (local) era,
like our BCE/CE. Such eras were established only late in the ﬁrst millennium BCE,
probably under Hellenistic inﬂuence, when weekdays were imported as well.
3.3
Space Organization in Vedic Cosmography
In the worldview of the oldest (Vedic) texts the earth is ﬂat, an ancient view that is
reinforced by the almost featureless North Indian landscape, stretching from
Afghanistan to, roughly, Benares. the earth is construed as a ﬂat disk (as easily
visible from a hill or mountain) with heaven (vyoman, rocana, sānu, viṣṭap, pṛṣṭha
—“ridge”) above. Between both there is a wide expanse of the “interspace” (an-
tarikṣa). While more ancient mythology had a binary division of Father
Heaven/Mother Earth (dyāus pitar, pṛthivī mātar), this tripartite structure appeared,
according to a myth, because heaven and earth had been separated from their
primordial union by a god (Indra) or a mountain (like Atlas in Greek mythology) or
(an offering) pole, or by the world tree (Plakṣa) that connects the two at zenith near
the current North Pole, the ‘navel/top’ of sky around which the stars revolve.
30
N. Yanchevskaya and M. Witzel

Replicating the ancient Northern Eurasian pattern favoring a division of the
Universe into 9 levels, the Vedic texts often speak of 3 heavens (highest, middle,
and lowest),31 that is where the gods and ancestors reside, further the three layers of
the Earth, and the three ‘interspaces’ (antarikṣa) between heaven and earth. The
gods are said to have “resorted to heaven and earth, the waters and the sun (svar)…
and the wide interspace”.
Heaven and earth meet at the rim of the horizon: there is a small gap “as thin as a
wing of an insect”, through which one can go outside, mount the back of the sky,
and reach the eternal light beyond it. The sky is thought (as in Iran) to consist of
stone, having holes through which the light beyond shines: the stars.32 A number of
them are mentioned in the Ṛgveda, such as the ancient Seven Bears (as in Greece),
however generally substituted by the Seven Sages (Ṛṣis). Other early Vedic stars
are the Wolf, the Milky Way, and later also the Dolphin. Some of the major
constellations are mentioned as well, such as the old Eurasian Ursa Maior (Great
Bear, Wagon, Dipper) constellation. The pole star (dhruva—“the ﬁrm one”) was at
ﬁrst not yet in its present position, due to precession but it appears in late Vedic
texts. Its position in the nighttime sky is taken by the top of the world tree, around
which the stars revolve.
The earth is circular, like a wheel (RV 10.89.4). However, one’s own territory is
always imagined as occupying its center (as the “Middle country”, like in China).
Though round, the earth is also divided by the 4 quarters (and their additional four
intermediate regions).
The most remarkable feature in the ﬂat lands of Northern India is the rivers that
separate the tribal areas: the seven rivers of the Panjab, to which later the Ganges &
Jamna (Yamunā) were added, along with their intermediate (doab) regions (also
called antarvedi). Another major feature is the “Snow Mountains” (Himālaya) in
the north, and in the post-Ṛgvedic texts also the Indian Ocean (samudra) in the east
and west of the subcontinent. Mythologically, the Earth is perceived as surrounded
by an ocean, and there are also oceans above and below it. In the post-Ṛgvedic texts
it is said that clouds rise from the ocean. There also are mythological references to a
“northern” or mythical “upper” ocean (AV) as well. Toward the end of the Vedic
period, the central Indian mountain ranges (Pariyātra, Vindhya) and some lands
south of it came into view.
The Netherworld—not a hell—appears as some undeﬁned space (nirṛti) below
the “three earths”, is thought of as “deepest darkness”, where only extraordinary
miscreants go after death. Later, the netherworld was thought to be inhabited by
Nāgas (and Piśācas) and some of the human ancestors. Each night the sun passes
through this dark space to merge again in the east:
31RV 5.60.6.
32JUB 1.25, 4.51, cf. 1.3.1.; see Witzel [20]: 620

Time and Space in Ancient India: Pre-philosophical Period
31

You travel, o Savitar, through the three shining realms, you live with the rays of the Sun,
you circumambulate the Night on both sides…33
Very rarely the sun is said to have a bright and a dark side: it ﬂips over at sunset
and moves back through the sky to the east while showing its dark side; in the
morning it ﬂips over again.
In the later Vedic period, exempliﬁed by the Brāhmaṇa texts (before c.
500 BCE), the area of Vedic culture had expanded all over Northern India, up to the
borders of Bengal. As mentioned, the traditional center of the Vedic universe (after
the RV) was the “Middle Country”, roughly extending from Kurukṣetra west of
Delhi to Allahabad. It is regarded as the center of the Vedic peoples (Āryāvarta), the
“middle direction,” or “middle country” (madhyamā dīś, madhyadeśa). This core
area of the Kuru and Pañcāla tribes was surrounded by other, often smaller tribes: in
the west, the Mahāvṛsa, Bahīka, Saindhava, Kamboja, and even the Balhika (Balkh,
in N. Afghanistan), and the Kosala, Videha, and Aṅga in the east. The south, even
the area north of the Vindhya mountains (Cedi, Śabara, etc.), is hardly mentioned
and South India (Āndhra) basically still is out of view. Interestingly, these various
tribes or peoples are described as arranged clockwise in a spatial framework and
enumerated while following the 4 directions. This is an ancient Indo-Iranian
scheme, probably already an Indo-European one.
3.4
Time in the Later Vedic Tradition: Atharvaveda
and Upaniṣads
Time in abstracto (kāla) has been attested since the second oldest Indian text, the
Atharvaveda. In AV 19.53–54 we ﬁnd an elaborate hymn speciﬁcally dedicated to
time. It says that time is the creator of the universe, the highest God, encompassing
everything that exists: “Time created the Earth… in Time are all beings… Time is
the lord of everything… Time created the creatures…” (AV 19.53).34 “This Time
goes on as the ﬁrst god” (AV 19.53.2d).35 According to these hymns, Time creates
the world, puts it in motion, and sustains its existence: “Through Time the sun
rises… through Time the wind blows… upon Time the worlds [are founded]” (AV
19.54).36 Here we can clearly see the parallels with the year—“the Lord of
everything that blinks”—from the hymns of the Ṛgveda discussed above. Addi-
tionally, time, as described in the Atharvaveda, creates, regulates, and organizes the
universe just like ṛta, the Cosmic Order, in the Ṛgveda.

N. Yanchevskaya and M. Witzel

Time in these two hymns is also called a horse that “drives seven wheels”37 and
“carried all beings/worlds”,38 which deﬁnitely corresponds to an image of the wheel
of the year (and of ṛta) in RV 1.164 that “rolls around heaven” and also carries all
beings or worlds (bhuvanāni viśvā).
Interestingly, these hymns give us what probably is the earliest direct indication
of the uniﬁed time’s division into two types. The ﬁrst one—“ﬂuid”, empirical Time,
perhaps of cyclic nature—actively creates and sustains the universe and ﬂows
around the worlds (“this [time] did ﬂow around the worlds”—AV 19.53.4b39). The
second form—Time-eternity, the uncreated Absolute—is shown in AV 19.53.3: “A
full jar [likely, of amṛta,40 the drink of immortality] is placed upon Time. We see it
existing in many forms. It faces all these worlds (beings). It is called Time in the
highest heaven”41. Time-eternity here is symbolized by a full jar (of amṛta);
“eternity”, because amṛta is immortality. The words “we see it existing in many
forms” signify the created world, i.e. our world (the only one we can see), the world
of ﬂuid, empirical time that unfolds from eternity, from the Time in the highest
heaven. This might be another parallel to RV 1.164, where the wheel of the year is
said to be the father of “seven hundred twenty sons” (days and nights of the year)
who “has ﬁve feet and twelve parts, the overﬂowing one in the upper half of
heaven”.42 Apparently, there is the same mythological motif in these two cases: the
one of time-eternity understood as immortality and a drink of immortality (some-
times, like in RV 1.164, associated with the moon: in post-Vedic mythology the
moon is considered to be a receptacle of soma, Vedic sacriﬁcial libation, that—also
in the later tradition—is interchangeable with amṛta) placed somewhere “in the
highest heaven”.
Thus, in the Atharvarveda we see further development of the views that were in
formation in the Ṛgveda. First, it is the idea of all-powerful time that creates and
regulates the universe. Second, a conceptual division of time into two types: one is
beyond this world—time-eternity, located in the realm of immortality; another one
—transitory, ﬂuid, and cyclic time that “ﬂows around the worlds”. Remarkably, it is
the second, “ﬂuid” time that is actively evolved in creation.
Time is also discussed in the Upaniṣads. Mentions are fragmentary and few, and
do not represent a consistent and integral system. A summary can be given as
follows:
37AV 19.53.2.
38AV 19.53.4a.
39sa eva saṃbhuvanāni pary ait |.
40In the previous stanza (AV 19.53.2): sapta cakrān vahati kāla eṣa saptāsya nābhīr amṛtaṃnv

axle).

Time and Space in Ancient India: Pre-philosophical Period

1. Time (kāla) or the Year (saṃvatsara) is considered to be a unifying notion of all
measurable, empirical intervals of time (year, day, hours, etc.) and all time-states
(states-in-time), i.e. past, present, and future (sometimes mentioned as “three
times” or “three divisions of time”).43
2. The Year (saṃvatsara) is said to be the body of the sacriﬁcial horse. Sacriﬁcial
horse is described in this passage as an embodiment of the space-time continuum:
the whole body (ātman) of the sacriﬁcial horse is said to be the year (saṃvat-
sara),44 whereas particular body parts are identiﬁed either with smaller
divisions/intervals of time or with segments of space. Its limbs are identiﬁed with
seasons (ṛtu),45 “its joints are the months and fortnights; its feet are the days and
nights”,46 “its forequarter is the rising sun; and its hindquarter is the setting sun”.47
Its other body parts are identiﬁed with the sun (eye), the dawn (head), the sky
(back), the intermediate region (abdomen), the earth (underbelly), the primary and
intermediate space quarters (ﬂanks and ribs), etc. Grammatically it is interesting
that the horse in the passage is described without verbs and without any markers of
time (“then” and such), the passage uses a verbless series of equivalences between
parts of the horse and parts of the universe. The horse is described timelessly, it is
eternal. When it comes to describing behavior and activities of the horse, verbs do
appear, but the horse’s behavior and natural processes are juxtaposed without any
relation to “external” time, from a point of view of “internal” or relative time, i.e.,
in relation to the horse. This relation is emphasized syntactically by the usage of
the relative–correlative clauses “when-then”/“this-that” (yad-tad): when the horse
does A, then B happens in the world. All verbs are in the present tense, i.e., it is the
“timeless present”:
When it yawns, lightning ﬂashes; when it shakes itself, it thunders; and when it urinates, it
rains. Its neighing is speech itself.48
Therefore, the sacriﬁcial horse, described here as eternal and timeless, consti-
tutes the whole universe, the realms of space and time, and its physical activities
are understood as natural phenomena, speciﬁcally, the thunderstorm, one of
most mythologized natural events in the Indo–European and Indian cultures.
Identiﬁcation of the body of the sacriﬁcial horse with a year has its roots in the
conduct and duration of the aśvamedha (horse sacriﬁce) ritual: the whole ritual
43For the Year (Time) consisting of seasons, periods, and states-in-time see, for example, MU
6.14, MU 6.33, BĀU 3.8.4, BĀU 3.8.6, etc. See also Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1.1, Śvetāśvatara

takes a year during which a sacriﬁcial horse after preparatory rites is allowed to
roam freely (escorted by an army that guards the horse against possible attacks
of neighbors and other incidents). While the horse wanders, “daily offerings
were made to Savitar, the horse being associated or identiﬁed with the sun and
the solar year.”49 At the end of the year the horse returns at the beginning of the
king’s consecration (aśvamedha being a part of the king’s consecration rites) to
be sacriﬁced with elaborate rituals that included the soma pressings, etc.
Another signiﬁcant detail is that during the ritual the sacriﬁcial horse is tied by a
twelve cubits (aratni) long muñja grass rope that represents a year (12 months).
In sum, the considered passage from BĀU is a continuation of an idea that ﬁrst
appears in the Puruṣasūkta: time-space continuum is contained within and
created out of the body of the sacriﬁced.
3. Bṛhadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣad (BĀU 3.8.3-8) states that the time-space continuum of
the universe (“the things above the sky, the things below the earth, and the
things between the earth and the sky, as well as all those things people here refer
to as past, present and future”—BĀU 3.8.350) is “woven back and forth” on
ākāśa, the inﬁnite space (BĀU 3.8.451); and ākāśa in turn is “woven” on the
Imperishable Brahman (BĀU 3.8.8).52 This idea might constitute the origin of a
later view developed by philosophers of the Sāṃkhya school that time is pro-
duced by means of inﬁnite space/ether (ākāśa) out of the ultimate reality (in the
case of the Sāṃkhya—from Prakṛti) and somehow is “part” of ākāśa.
4. It is said in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣad 1.2.4 that Time as the Year (saṃvat-
sara) is the product of an intercourse between the ultimate being (functioning as
Death and Hunger) and Speech. It was also the ultimate being’s sperm, which
was transformed into the Year: “He desired: ‘may my second atman be born’.
By means of [his] mind he, hunger [and] death, copulated with Speech. What
was semen became the Year. For there had been no year before.”53 Schayer
notes: “Time created as a child of Death is itself Death.”54
5. Time is said to be so thin that it cannot be observed directly, but can be
measured by the movement of the Sun: “because of thinness, a measure is this,
by this [i.e., the movement of the Sun] Time is measured” (Maitrī-Upaniṣad,
6.1455).
6. The idea of Time being equal to the Absolute, the eternal Brahman, is expressed in
Maitrī-Upaniṣad, 6.15–16: “Indeed, there are two forms of Brahman: Time and
Non-Time. Then, the one that is before the Sun is non-Time with no parts. And the

one from the Sun is Time with parts. The year is a form of the one with parts. These
creatures are born from the year”.56 The two forms of Brahman—embodied or
formed (mūrta) and non-embodied or formless (amūrta)—are discussed in BĀU
2.3.1, MU 6.3, etc. Signiﬁcantly, in MU 6.14 two forms of Time—
embodied/formed and non-embodied/formless (kālo mūrtiramūrtimān)—are also
mentioned. Thus, as there are two forms of Brahman, there are two corresponding
Times: the absolute non-embodied Time (Eternity-Time, Time which is
“Non-Time”, without parts) and revealed, embodied Time (“concrete” Time of the
phenomenal world, “ﬂuid” and divided into parts—years, days, minutes, etc.). The
Eternity-Time, which parallels the “before-the-Sun”, “Non-time” Brahman,
clearly corresponds to the Atharvaveda’s “Time in the highest sky”.
7. Additionally, in Maitrī-Upaniṣad there are speculations about transient and
transitory nature of everything, which corresponds to one of the major tenets of
Buddhism.
3.5
Time and Space in the Epics
In addition to the above ideas developed in the Upanishads, there existed an ancient
doctrine speciﬁcally dedicated to Time. It is mentioned both in the epics and in the
oldest Buddhist and Jain literature as Kālavāda, i.e., “The Doctrine of Time”.
Because it is referred to quite often, we can say that Kālavāda was widely known,
and the existence of handbooks dedicated to Kālavāda has been reported.57
Unfortunately, information that has survived is very fragmentary and dispersed
throughout texts of different traditions and periods. Thus, we can only reconstruct
the system. According to fragments found in the epics (ﬁrst of all, the Mahābhārata)
and epico-philosophical texts (such as Yogavāsiṣṭha), time is considered the pri-
mary cause of creation, existence and destruction of all beings; it is the absolute
beginning of everything; it is something eternal, all-pervading and permanent:
…everything is born from Time and then is taken away by it (MBh 13.1.4958)
…having pervaded everything, [Time] abides (YV 1.23.759)
Time, having devoured all [the universe] with no remainder, is the essence (ātman) of
everything (YV 1.23.660)
56dve vāva brahmaṇo rūpe kālаścākālaścātha yaḥprāgādityāt so 'kālо 'kalo 'tha ya ādityādyaḥsa

Like the wind turning blades of grass in all directions, all beings are in the power of Time…
(MBh 11.2.761)
Cold, heat and rainy season turn around by [the will of] Time, as well as happiness and
suffering in [the world of] men [do]. (MBh 12.28.3462)
According to the MBh, time controls death and old age. It is compared with the
great ocean that hides these two monsters. It also “cooks” or “ripens” living beings
and devours everything—all worlds and all creatures:
Nobody knows that this world sinks into the Ocean of Time where two monsters are
(hiding): Old Age and Death. (MBh 12.28.4363)
Time cooks beings, Time takes away every living thing, and Time itself that bums living
beings is, in its turn, tamed by Time. (MBh 1.1.18864)
As the ultimate cause of everything in the world, “time establishes everything
and time cooks it”.65
The epics (especially the MBh) describe time, often compared to Yama, the god
of death, as a force demolishing the universe at the end of a world period (kalpa)
and as a devourer of things:
It takes away, destroys … devours and kills (YV 1.23.1166)
Additionally, some texts mention empirical time, which, quite contrary to the
permanent time discussed above, is changeable and consists of intervals. In texts
related to Kālavāda, time can paradoxically possess the opposite qualities (indi-
visibility and being divided into intervals, permanence and impermanence, etc.)
simultaneously, for example:
Isn’t [Time] the most cunning deceiver, o sage? It is divided though indivisible, is being
burnt though never burns out, is seen though invisible (YV 1.23.1667)
One of the most important and typical images of Kālavāda is that of the Wheel of
Time (kāla-cakra). It is described in different parts of the MBh as well as in various
other texts. In MBh 1.3 in the story of Uttaṅka, sage Gautama’s a disciple who
descends to the realm of the nagas (serpents) in the underworld, the wheel of time is
depicted as a part of a loom where two deities—Dhātṛand Vidhātṛ—spin threads of
human destiny:

Then he saw two women at a loom weaving cloth having placed [it on a loom]. And threads
in that loom were black and white. And also he saw a wheel turned by six boys and saw a
handsome-looking man.68
Three hundred and sixty [spokes] are ﬁxed in the middle – in this eternal ever-turning wheel
furnished with 24 parts (parvans) that is turned by six boys. And two young women [are]
weaving [on] this loom always turning around the threads, spinning white and black
[threads], [and] worlds and beings perpetually.69
Those two women are Dhātṛand Vidhātṛ. And those black and white threads are nights and
days. The twelve spokes are the 12 months. As for the twelve spoke wheel turned by six
boys, those are the six seasons (ṛtu) [and] the wheel is a year…70
Although certain details and numbers differ, this wheel is strikingly similar to the
wheel of the year (and of ṛta) in RV 1.164 as well as to the wheel(s) of time in the
Atharvaveda and constitutes a development of the same idea.
During the epic period an elaborate system of world ages and cycles of creation
and destruction of the universe, the so-called system of yugas, took the ﬁnite shape.
This system is connected to the major tenets of Hinduism—the doctrine of karma,
dharma, and transmigration. Sometimes it is called the doctrine of cyclical time. In
this framework, there are three major units of cyclical time: the kalpas, the man-
vantaras, and the yugas. Kalpa is a cycle of creation and destruction of the uni-
verse, also called a day of Brahmā (the creator god). When Brahmā wakes up from
his sleep, the world is created; when he falls asleep it is destroyed. Manvantara (“a
period of Manu”) is a period when a particular progenitor of humans, Manu, rules.
Each manvantara a new Manu is born. A new Indra, king of the gods, is also born
in each manvantara. The yugas are associated with the increase and decrease of
dharma (moral law and rules of conduct for the four social classes). There are 4
yugas: Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara, and Kali. Each of them is related to a particular throw
of a dice: Kṛta is the best throw, and Kali is the worst. Each yuga dharma
diminishes by one forth. Consequently, Kṛta is considered the best age “when
dharma stands on four legs”, and Kali is the worst “when dharma stands on one leg”
(similarly to ages in Greek mythology—from the golden age to the iron one). At the
end of Kali-yuga dharma is at its lowest point, therefore people become immoral,
neglect their religious and social duties, etc. After Kali-yuga, Kṛta-yuga starts again.
Between the yugas there are transitional periods called the saṃdhis. A cycle of the 4
yugas (including all the saṃdhi periods) constitutes a mahāyuga. Each mahāyuga

lasts 12 thousand “years of the gods”, one year of the gods being 360 human years.
A kalpa (one day of Brahmā) lasts 100 mahāyugas, i.e., 12 million “years of the
gods” or 4,320,000 human years. From these calculations we can see that this
system is an elaboration of old Vedic model where the year represents time-eternity
and a cycle of time.
The organization of space (cosmography) in the epics is also different from that
in the Vedas. Generally, cosmological system and space organization as described
in the epics is very close to the accounts found in the Purāṇas. In the Epic-Purāṇic
mythology, a continent or an island called Jambūdvīpa (“Rose Apple continent”) in
the Purāṇas and Sudarśana (“Beautiful”) in the Mahābhārata is situated in the center
of the ﬂat earth. This continent (or an island) is envisioned as circular or having the
form of four-petaled lotus, the four continents spreading in each direction. In the
Purāṇas the Southern continent is called Bharata, whereas in the Bhīṣma Parvan of
the Mahābhārata we ﬁnd two names for it—Bharata and alternatively Jambūdvīpa.
The continent is a disk whose diameter according to the Purāṇas is 100,000 yo-
janas71 (1000 yojanas in the MBh). In the center, in the seed cup of the lotus, there
stands Mount Meru (or Sumeru) whose height according to both MBh and the
Purāṇas is 84,000 yojanas. High above the Mount Meru there is Dhruva, the Pole
Star; celestial bodies move around it in circles. Gaṅgā (the Ganges river) falls on
Meru and runs in four directions. On the top on Mount Meru there is a city of
Brahmā in the center, surrounded by the eight cities of the Lokapālas (guardians of
the cardinal directions)—each of the cities marking one of the main or intermediate
cardinal directions. The continent of Jambūdvīpa (or Sudarśana) is surrounded by a
series of seven concentric oceans (ﬁrst the salt ocean, then oceans of sugar-cane
juice, wine, clariﬁed butter, milk, whey, and fresh water) and seven “continents”
(dvīpa), each larger than the previous one. At the edge of the world (samā in the
MBh) there is a great mountain range Lokāloka that separates loka (world) from
aloka (un-world).72 The Mahābhārata describes four world elephants that dwell on
the world-edge. Each of the elephants marks one of the cardinal points.
Different peoples that inhabit the world and their arrangement in the epic
landscape are also described in the MBh. By the time when the Sanskrit epics were
composed by the wandering bards of Northern India, the geographical horizon had
expanded as to include almost the entire subcontinent. Therefore the epics mention
its actual geographical features and various populations, even the distant Hūṇa
(Huns) and Cīna (Chinese).
Vertically, space is organized into 3 worlds—heaven (the upper world), earth,
and underworld. In different sources it is mentioned that heaven and the nether-
world are divided into seven layers. However, an interesting feature of the epic
71The exact length of a yojana differs in various sources, however, generally, it is a distance
traversed in one harnessing or without unyoking.
72Kirfel [4]: 121.

worldview is that the vertical axis of the universe is much less important and less
described than the horizontal space organization.73 Heroes who are at the center of
attention in the epics mostly act in the world of men (although sometimes they
ascend to heaven or descend to the netherworld), therefore the world of men and the
horizontal domain of space is of the foremost importance. For the epics, the prin-
cipal place is home of the heroes, therefore it is considered to be the “central
country” (madhyadeśa). The farther a place from the central country, the more
dangerous and “demonic” it is depicted in the epics.74
To conclude, in the epic texts we ﬁnd a developed cosmography that has its roots
in the Vedic and Indo-European mythology and a very elaborate doctrine of time.
Kālavāda, the doctrine of time found in the epics, absorbed archaic myths, poetic
metaphors, and pre-philosophical and religious ideas expressed in the Ṛgveda,
Atharvaveda, and the Upaniṣads and supplemented them with other—newer, or
maybe even more archaic—myths and ideas. Later, many of the concepts and even
images of Kālavāda found their way to different philosophical systems of Classical
India. This paper is an attempt to better understand the origins of the notion of time
and structure of space in Ancient India and show the development of the concepts
on all stages from the Ṛgveda to the epics.

Śrīharṣa on the Indeﬁnability of Time
Jonathan Duquette and Krishnamurti Ramasubramanian
Abstract The conception of time as an absolute, eternal and imperishable entity is
commonplace in several religious and philosophical systems. In the context of
classical Indian philosophy, this position was advocated by the Nyāya school of
logic and epistemology. This article presents an outline of the critique of the Nyāya
concept of time put forward by Śrīharṣa, a 12th-century scholar in the Advaita
Vedānta school of philosophical theology. In his philosophical treatise, the Khaṇ-
ḍanakhaṇḍakhādya, Śrīharṣa dismantles the Nyāya position based on a critical
examination of its deﬁnition of causality and time-forms. The dismissal of the
ontological reality of time is also discussed with reference to the works of two later
Advaitins, namely Citsukha and Madhusūdana Sarasvatī.

Introduction
Since Antiquity, thinkers of all civilizations, cultures and scholarly backgrounds
have pondered on questions such as: What is time? How does it relate to the
physical world? It is real or merely a human construct? Is it an object of knowledge,
and if so, how do we apprehend it? What purpose does it serve in the scheme of

reality? Various answers have been given to such questions in different areas of
knowledge ranging from cosmology, physics and mathematics to philosophy,
psychology and theology. The Indian tradition offers a wide spectrum of
well-formulated views about time (kāla1). Brahmanical, Buddhist and Jain schools
all endeavoured to understand the multifaceted nature of time in its metaphysical,
logical and epistemological aspects, and for long debated with each other over such
issues. In this article, we will focus on how one school of thought—the Advaita
Vedānta school of philosophical theology, whose views lean towards metaphysical
idealism—refutes the concept of time advocated by another school, the Nyāya
school of logic and epistemology, which defends a version of realistic pluralism.
Our aim is to provide a ﬁrst systematic outline of the incisive critique of the Nyāya
concept of time put forward by the 12th-century scholar of Advaita Vedānta, Śrī-
harṣa, in his celebrated treatise the Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya (“Edible Pieces of
Refutation,” hereafter KKK). We believe that an examination of Śrīharṣa’s critique
is not only of historical and cultural interest, but also philosophically signiﬁcant
insofar as it stands as one of the most sophisticated attempts in the history of Indian
philosophy to dismiss the ontological reality of time.
In the scholarly tradition known as Advaita (non-dualist) Vedānta, which
ﬂourished most richly after Śaṅkara, a philosopher and theologian who lived around
the 8th century CE, philosophical inquiry starts from the metaphysical premise that
Brahman—the immanent and transcendent “absolute” revealed in the Upaniṣads,
sacred texts of the brahmanical tradition—is the sole reality of everything. In this
view, the individual self is identiﬁed with the transcendental self, Brahman, which
is pure consciousness; as to the world in which dwells the self, it is considered an
apparent manifestation of that unchanging Brahman. In other words, ontological
plurality does not exist in a fundamental sense. It is experienced because of error in
judgements and mistaken cognitions, and vanishes in the wake of the knowledge of
the true nature of the self. Thus the Advaita tradition stands in stark contrast with
the Nyāya tradition as the latter defends a robust realism including a plurality of
selves, universals and substances. Historically, their metaphysical divergences have
led these two schools to engage one another on several philosophical issues; the
ontological nature of time is just one among them.
It is with this dialectical background in mind that one has to approach Śrīharṣa’s
unique contributions to Indian philosophy. One of the greatest scholars and vitally
original thinkers of Advaita Vedānta, Śrīharṣa stands out in the history of Indian
philosophy because of his uncompromising critique of the logical positions
defended by Naiyāyikas (the philosophers of the Nyāya school). In his polemical
treatise, the KKK—the title indicates that the main purpose of the work is a
refutation (khaṇḍana)—Śrīharṣa aims to show that the deﬁnitions (lakṣaṇa) and
means of knowledge (pramāṇa) with the help of which the Nyāya school constructs
its own ontological categories of existence (padārtha), are defective. By showing
that all concepts and categories of human reason are indeﬁnable, Śrīharṣa is able to

dismantle the metaphysical realism of Nyāya and thereby urge that an Advaita
philosophy based on non-distinctness (abheda) is alone coherent and logically
defendable.2 Before examining in detail the crux of Śrīharṣa’s critique of time
(Sect. 4.3), we ﬁrst provide a brief summary of Nyāya views on time and causality
and explain how the reality of time is vital to its entire metaphysical framework. In
a way to complement our treatment of Śrīharṣa, we conclude the article (Sect. 4.4)
with a brief discussion of views on time held by later Advaitins, namely Citsukha
and Madhusūdana Sarasvatī.
4.2
Time in Nyāya
The philosophical position of Nyāya regarding the problem of time derives from the
speciﬁc way in which it understands the world—its constitution, structure and
functioning.3 Nyāya defends a robust realism based on a pluralist metaphysics
framed in terms of “categories of existence” (padārtha, lit. a thing denoted by a
word).4 Substances (one of the padārtha) include perishable (kṛtaka) entities such
as pots and trees, as well as imperishable (akṛtaka) or eternal (nitya) entities such as
atoms, selves and others. Time (kāla) counts among the imperishable substances.
Naiyāyikas deﬁne it so because time is assumed to possess properties that can only
be attributed to an eternal substance. Among those is the fact that time does not
presuppose any substratum for its own existence; it is also all-pervading, uniform
and unchanging. In terms of its function, time is regarded as the locus (ādhāra)
where all contingent (kādācitka) entities come to existence. This function of time
pertains to contingent entities alone because eternal substances do not exist “in
time” according to Nyāya: they are timeless and as such beyond the realm of things
conditioned by processes of production, change and destruction. Hence time itself,
insofar as it is an eternal substance, is timeless. Not unlike the Newtonian absolute
time, time in Nyāya constitutes the static background in which events happen and
from which they derive their chronological order. Since no change in terms of
action, movement or modiﬁcation is conceivable without time, time must be an
objective category of existence. It is not a subjective construction (puruṣabud-
dhiprabhava) but ontologically real.
2For the view that Śrīharṣa’s method of argument was essentially deconstructionist, i.e., aimed at
showing that the opponents’ doctrines contradicted themselves, see Granoff [9]; for the argument
that he had a positive program involving a personal defense of Advaita teachings, see Phillips [15].
3For a general treatment of time according to Nyāya(-Vaiśeṣika), see: Balslev [6]: 25–43, [7, 8]
[10]: 205–228, [12–14]. The following discussion is based especially on the ﬁrst two references.
4Generally speaking, Nyāya accepts seven such categories: 1. substance (dravya); 2. quality
(guṇa); 3. activity (karman); 4. generality (sāmānya); 5. individuator (viśeṣa); 6. inherence
(samavāya); 7. absence (abhāva).

Śrīharṣa on the Indeﬁnability of Time
45

Another fundamental property of time is its unity (ekatva): time is a unitary,
undivided entity. The immediate question is: if time is indeed one single objective
real, how do we account for the experienced plurality of time-forms and temporal
distinctions? For Naiyāyikas, time-forms such as past, present and future, and
temporal distinctions such as posteriority (paratva), anteriority (aparatva), simul-
taneity (yaugapadya), succession (ayaugapadya), etc., are purely conventional and
can be explained on the basis of external factors—that is, factors that are not
inherent to the substance of time. Time itself is not inherently divided into past,
present and future; it is the particular events taking place “in time” that enable us to
speak of time as past, present and future, and this is determined through external
factors such as the motion of the sun, moon, etc. Technically speaking, time-forms
and temporal distinctions result from limiting conditions (upādhi) that are imposed
on the unitary substance of time. Naiyāyikas thus distinguish between two kinds of
time: absolute time (mahākāla), which is eternal and of course real; and empirical
or “conventional” time (khaṇḍakāla), which arises from the association of absolute
time with external limiting conditions.
According to Naiyāyikas, temporal distinctions are the “marks” or “indicators”
(liṅga) on the basis of which they infer the existence of time. In their view, per-
ception (pratyakṣa) cannot reveal the existence of time and much less its properties.
Inference (anumāṇa) alone is the means of knowledge (pramāṇa) to cognize time
as ontologically real. The conceptual problem that naturally poses itself is that
temporal distinctions seem a priori to be based on time—for what means “ante-
riority” if not that something precedes something else in time? If this is the case, it is
difﬁcult to understand how one can infer the existence of time on the basis of
temporal distinctions without falling into circular reasoning. To avoid this problem,
Naiyāyikas explain anteriority and other such distinctions without direct reference
to time. For instance, anteriority is regarded as a quality (guṇa) that inheres in every
substance (recall that every quality must inhere in a substance in the Nyāya
metaphysical framework). In turn, a substance possesses this quality by virtue of its
relation, for instance, to a relatively large or small number of solar revolutions. To
give an example: we cognize that an old man is “anterior” to a young man because
the birth of the former precedes that of the latter by many revolutions of the sun.
The point is that the movement of the sun need not involve any temporal reference
according to Naiyāyikas.
However, how are we to infer the existence of time on the basis of a notion such
as anteriority? If anteriority is a quality that inheres in a particular object A (let’s say
an old man) by virtue of its relation to solar motion, how is the object A in question
connected with solar motion? This is not a trivial question for Naiyāyikas. Since the
motion of the sun is in principle an activity (kriyā, one of the seven categories
mentioned earlier), it must inhere in a substance: namely in the sun, not in the object
A which is located far from it. In other words, there is no relation of inherence
(samavāya) between the motion of the sun and the object A. The way to resolve this
problem is to assume that both entities (the motion and the object A) are indirectly
connected to each other via a mediating substance. Technically, this indirect
connection
is
termed
svasaṃyuktasaṃyuktasamavāya
in
Nyāya:
inherence
46
J. Duquette and K. Ramasubramanian

(samavāya) in a substance which is in conjunction (saṃyukta) with something that is
in conjunction with the individual in question (svasaṃyukta), where the term
“conjunction” (saṃyoga) refers to the particular relation that stands between two
substances (like a table and a book standing on it). That is to say: the object A is
assumed to be in conjunction with a (mediating) substance that is itself in con-
junction with the sun in which solar motion inheres. In this manner, the object A and
the solar motion are connected together. Naiyāyikas aim to prove that the mediating
substance in question can only be time, and nothing else.5 Hence absolute time is
established, through inference, as the ontological basis that makes possible and
meaningful such conventional notions as posteriority, anteriority, etc. and other
temporal expressions. Time accounts for the sequential character of things and
events, yet it is in no way deﬁned or affected by such things and events.
4.3
Śrīharṣa’s Refutation of Time (kālakhaṇḍana)
The Naiyāyika concept of time as a real, unitary and all-pervading substance was
challenged by Buddhist, Jain as well as brahmanical philosophers. In the fourth
chapter (caturthapariccheda) of his KKK, Śrīharṣa offers an incisive critique of this
concept from the perspective of Advaita Vedānta.6 This critique occurs in the
context of Śrīharṣa’s broader refutation of the Naiyāyika deﬁnition of causality
(kāraṇalakṣaṇa). The philosophical realism advocated in Nyāya rests to a great
extent on its view of causality, and causality itself depends upon the implicit
postulate that time is real. By demonstrating that the ontological reality of time
cannot be logically ascertained, Śrīharṣa provides an additional proof that the
time-based deﬁnition of causality advocated by Naiyāyikas is incorrect. As we shall
see (Sect. 4.4), the Advaita defense of the transactional reality (vyāvahārikasattā)
of the empirical world is not reconcilable with a conception of causality that implies
the reality of time.
5For a more detailed discussion of this proof, see [7]: 184–187.
6We must keep in mind, however, that Śrīharṣa does not himself present the Advaita view on the
subject but, given the nature of his work, conﬁnes himself to a critical treatment of other schools.
As far as we know, there exists no detailed treatment of time from the perspective of Advaita
Vedānta in secondary literature. For general treatments, see: [11, 14]. Reference [6] has a short
section on Advaita Vedānta (pp. 57–72) in which he also brieﬂy addresses Śrīharṣa’s rejection of
the Nyāya position.

Śrīharṣa on the Indeﬁnability of Time
47

4.3.1
Preamble [A]
As7 is common in Indian philosophical debates, Śrīharṣa’s argumentation in the
KKK is framed in terms of a dialectical confrontation between the proponent of the
thesis to be defended (siddhānta), Śrīharṣa himself, and an opponent, here a
Naiyāyika. Śrīharṣa ﬁrst points out a problem in the very formulation of the deﬁ-
nition of causality (kāraṇalakṣaṇa) proposed by Naiyāyikas, wherein they state that
the cause must precede the effect in time (prākkālina). Clearly, the word prāk [=
prāñc] in the deﬁnition can only refer to something occurring in the past and as
such must exclude whatever is present and future. The problem with this analysis
(vivecana), according to Śrīharṣa, is that it assumes that time is real and that it is
inherently divided into three time-forms, namely past, present and future. But on
which logical basis are we to distinguish what is past from what is present and
future? What allows the Naiyāyika to assume that time has a fundamental reality
and that its division into past, present and future is meaningful in the ﬁrst place?
Śrīharṣa’s claim that a time-based deﬁnition of causality is impossible without a
prior deﬁnition of time itself serves as the starting point for his refutation of time
(kālakhaṇḍana).
The opponent begins by stating how we can establish that time exists in the form
of past, present and future: the three time-forms exist because we do cognize time as
past, present and future in our everyday experience. The existence of cognitions
(buddhi) such as “it exists”, “it existed” and “it will exist” is itself a proof (pra-
māṇa) that time really exists—independently of these cognitions, as it were—in the
form of past, present and future. This is a realist argument: the very fact that we
cognize various objects proves that the world is really constituted of such objects.
For Śrīharṣa, however, this argument amounts to a logical fallacy. He asks: but
what is the content (viṣaya) of these cognitions of time? The opponent’s answer is
simple: particular time-forms (kālaviśeṣa), i.e., past, present and future. In other
words, when you cognize an external event, you cognize it along with time: time is
an essential component of each and every cognition. The content of the cognition of
something cognized as being present points to the ontological existence of a present
time that is different from past and future times.
4.3.2
Time-Forms as Inherent (svābhāvika) to Time [B]
But what does “particular time-forms” (kālaviśeṣa) really mean from an ontological
standpoint? In the Indian philosophical terminology common to both opponents, a
particularity (viśeṣa) can either be inherent (svābhāvika) to an entity or result from
limiting conditions (upādhi) imposed on this entity. From now on, Śrīharṣa
7The letters in brackets refer to the corresponding sections of the Sanskrit text in the Appendix. We
have introduced these subsections for the sake of clarity.
48
J. Duquette and K. Ramasubramanian

proceeds to show that neither of these alternatives makes sense in the case of time.
First of all, if time-forms such as past, present and future are integral to time, i.e.,
part of his very nature, then their mutual difference (bheda) must also be real. In this
case, the unity (ekatva) of time—a fundamental property of time according to
Naiyāyikas—cannot be maintained. If Naiyāyikas were to uphold the unitary nature
of time and that its unitary form is, say, “present,” then how could they explain the
experienced fact that the time cognized now as “present” was cognized as “future”
yesterday and will be cognized as “past” tomorrow?
If, in order to explain these different cognitions, the opponent were to claim that
the different time-forms result from the threefold nature (trividhasvabhāva) of time
—a claim meaning that time, although unitary, possesses three aspects internal to it
as it were—then he faces two major problems. The ﬁrst problem raised by Śrīharṣa
is of an ontological nature: how do we explain the reality of this division (bheda)
into three aspects? If this is inherent to the nature of time, how again is the unity of
time maintained? The second problem is epistemological. If past, present and future
are merely three aspects of the same unitary time, there is no strict criterion for us to
distinguish the cognition of past from that of present and future. Hence the cog-
nitions “it happened” and “it will happen” could occur at the same time as the
cognition “this is happening.” Technically speaking, this position leads to the
undesirable consequence (prasaṅga) that there is no proper distinction—or vya-
vasthā, a term which recurs in Śrīharṣa’s argumentation—between the three types
of cognitions. Therefore, the difference between the time-forms cannot be
accounted for if we hold that the latter are integral to the nature of time.
4.3.3
Time-Forms as a Result from Limiting Conditions
(aupādhika) [C]
Since it is untenable that time-forms, or any temporal distinction for that matter, are
inherent to time, Naiyāyikas try to account for these on the basis of external factors.
Technically, these external factors are termed upādhi—properties or “limiting
conditions” imposed on a particular entity that pass their own quality to this entity
(e.g., a red ﬂower placed behind a clear crystal which makes the crystal look red). In
the present context, the upādhi is deﬁned by the opponent to be the particular
relation that stands between the cognized event and activities such as the motion of
the sun, etc. Time is not inherently divided into past, present and future; it is the
association of particular activities (kriyāsambandha) with time that make us cog-
nize time as past, present and future. Śrīharṣa disagrees with this explanation and
presents his counterargument as follows. While the cognition of a certain event with
reference to the motion of the sun enables us to deﬁne that this event occurs in the
present, the same solar motion can also be used to describe the same event as past or
future at some other time. For instance, if we were to claim a particular day as
“today” based on a particular displacement of the sun, then the same day could be
4
Śrīharṣa on the Indeﬁnability of Time
49

referred to as “yesterday” (vṛtta; a day has elapsed) or “tomorrow” (vartsyat; a day
that has to elapse). Since solar motion is the common criterion for distinguishing the
three time-forms, it cannot serve as a proper basis for cognizing them separately
(i.e., vyavasthā is not possible).
The opponent tries to avoid this problem by clarifying how the cognized event
relates to the limiting condition. The cognition of an event as present occurs when
the relation (sambandha) between the event and the solar motion is actually “pre-
sent” (svarūpeṇa avatiṣṭhamāna); the cognition of an event as past occurs when that
same relation is no more there (vinaṣṭa); and the cognition of an event as future
occurs when that same relation is yet to be established (anāgata). The distinguishing
criterion here is not merely solar motion but precisely the relation that stands
between it and the cognized event. Śrīharṣa’s reply to this proposition is that this
distinguishing criterion is not adequate either because the relation in question must
itself be located in time. In his deﬁnition of present time, the opponent had used the
present participle avatiṣṭhamāna (from the verbal root ava + √sthā)—meaning “is
taking place” or “is present”—to describe the relation between the cognized event
and the limiting condition, here solar motion. Śrīharṣa’s point is that this verbal form,
insofar as it derives from the present tense (laṭ), semantically involves the notion of
present time. Since the deﬁnition (lakṣaṇa) of the present time (say t2) itself involves
the notion of present time (the object to be deﬁned, lakṣya; say t1), we have a clear
instance of self-dependent reasoning (ātmāśraya). This problem arises if we assume
that t1 is identical to t2. In order to avoid this problem of self-dependency, if the
opponent were to say that t2, conveyed through the verbal form avatiṣṭhamāna, is
different from t1, whose deﬁnition is being attempted, then we land into another
logical problem, namely that of inﬁnite regress (anavasthā). That is to say: to
understand t1 we need to understand t2; and to understand t2 we need to come up with
another deﬁnition for another “present time” t3, etc. The same problem occurs with
respect to past and future times.
4.3.4
Time-Forms as a Consequence of the Presence
and Absence of an External Activity [D]
At this point, the opponent turns to another, more technical deﬁnition of time-forms:
the present corresponds to the time that is delimited (avacchinna) by a certain
activity; the past corresponds to the time that is delimited by the prior absence
(prāgabhāva) of this activity; and the future corresponds to the time that is delimited
by the posterior absence (pradhvaṃsābhāva) of this activity.8 While deﬁning the
8Prior absence means the non-existence (abhāva) of something that is yet to come to existence
(e.g., the absence of a house about to be constructed); posterior absence means the non-existence
arising from the annihilation of something that was existing previously (e.g., the absence resulting
from the demolition of the house).
50
J. Duquette and K. Ramasubramanian

three time-forms in this way, the opponent has recourse to a more abstract termi-
nology based on the presence (bhāva) and absence (abhāva) of a certain activity
(kriyā). When a certain activity is occurring, our cognition of this activity comes
along with the cognition of present time; when this activity has yet to take place, the
cognition of the (prior) absence of this activity comes along with the cognition of
past time; and when this activity has come to completion, the cognition of the
(posterior) absence of this activity comes along with the cognition of future time.
Once again, Śrīharṣa must disagree. First of all, to strictly deﬁne the present as
that which is delimited by an activity (kriyāvacchinna) is too general a deﬁnition—
a fallacy referred to as atiprasaṅga, or over-extensive application of the deﬁnition
—for it applies also to past and future times insofar as these time-forms are also, in
a way or another, delimited by activities. In addition, there are obvious problems
with deﬁning past and future in terms of the prior and posterior absence of an
activity. Firstly, the expression “prior absence” (prāgabhāva) is hard to compre-
hend given that it contains the word “prior,” a time-based notion that is yet to be
deﬁned properly. Secondly, it is difﬁcult to distinguish posterior from prior absence.
Śrīharṣa incidentally challenges the very deﬁnition of prior and posterior absence,
based on which the opponent attempts to deﬁne time-forms. According to the
opponent, prior absence is an absence that eventually gets destroyed (vināśin) and
posterior absence is an absence that is eventually generated (utpattimat). Now, for
Naiyāyikas, the destruction (dhvaṃsa) of the prior absence (prāgabhāva) is in the
form of a counter-positive (pratiyogin) and so also is the prior absence of
destruction.9 Thus Śrīharṣa argues that it is untenable that only prior absence be
vināśin and not posterior absence too, for the counter-positive (e.g., pot, etc.) is the
same in both cases. Śrīharṣa then proceeds to analyze the term utpattimat: (a) if
utpattimat means that something non-existent (asat) comes to existence (sat), and if
this sat is taken in the technical sense of generality (sāmānya, a technical term in
Nyāya), then it is inappropriate to assign it to absence (of any type) since generality
exists only in substances (dravya), qualities (guṇa) and activities (karman), not in
absence; (b) if, on the other hand, sat is taken in the more general sense of mere
existence, then “prior absence” too becomes a candidate for this deﬁnition, for it
also has existence before the pot comes to existence. Thus no counterargument can
hold since the deﬁnitions of the two absences suffer from the problem of
over-applicability of the deﬁnition.
9In Nyāya literature, the term pratiyogin (counter-positive or adjunct) is abundantly used. In the
sentence, “that pot was broken,” the counter-positive of the absence of the pot (as a result of being
broken) is the pot itself. Such type of counter-positive is generally referred to as abhāvapratiyogin
(absential counter-positive) in contradistinction to bhedapratiyogin (differential counter-positive)
and sambandhapratiyogin (relational counter-positive). It is understood here that both the
destruction of prior absence and the prior absence of destruction are essentially counter-positives
themselves. As the saying goes: prāgabhāvadhvaṃsaḥpratiyogirūpaḥ, dhvaṃsaprāgabhāvo ‘pi
pratiyogirūpaḥ.

Śrīharṣa on the Indeﬁnability of Time
51

4.3.5
Time-Forms Are Based on the Relation (apekṣā)
to a Particular Activity [E]
Now that Śrīharṣa has successfully refuted the deﬁnition of time-forms based on the
presence and absence of an activity, the opponent tries to defend his position by
offering yet another deﬁnition of the time-form “present”: the time delimited by a
particular activity is cognized as “present” in relation (apekṣayā) to that particular
activity and not some other activity (anyāpekṣayā). The term apekṣā—which lit-
erally means “with reference to” or “in relation to”—is the key term of this new
deﬁnition, and this is the term that Śrīharṣa questions in the ﬁrst place. What kind of
“relation”
exactly
stands
between
the
cognized
activity
(kriyā)
and
its
“present-ness” (vartamānatā)? Is it a relation where the activity is a limiting con-
dition (upādhi), a boundary-element (avadhi), a counter-positive (pratiyogin) or
something that appears as a qualiﬁer (prakāra) in the cognition? Śrīharṣa takes each
of these separately and refutes them one by one:
• limiting condition: this alternative is quickly rejected on the basis that Śrīharṣa
had already proven earlier that to invoke a limiting condition is problematic to
the extent that the condition too is time-bound;
• boundary-element: an avadhi generally refers to a boundary, limit or reference
point for a certain entity or process. In the cognition “this is long compared to
that,” the word “that” is the avadhi. Śrīharṣa ﬁrst argues that time can be
cognized without relying on such an avadhi. For instance, in the cognition “the
tree exists” (vṛkṣo vartate), the time-form “present” is also cognized as the
verbal form implies the cognition that the tree is “present,” and yet the cognition
does not involve any standard of comparison. Secondly, to postulate the exis-
tence of an avadhi with respect to which we cognize something as present, leads
to the same problem raised earlier in connection with the upādhi: the impos-
sibility to distinguish the cognitions of past, present and future (pratyayāvya-
vasthā). If we assume that a certain reference point in the sky allows us to deﬁne
the day as “today,” the same reference point can be used the next day to deﬁne
“yesterday”;
• counter-positive: Śrīharṣa does not elaborate here and sees the rejection of this
position as a logical consequence of the rejection of the avadhi position;
• qualiﬁer in cognition: if the opponent has in mind that the cognized activity
relates to its “present-ness” through presenting itself as the qualiﬁer (prakāra) in
the cognition,10 then it is tantamount to saying that even cognitions that are
meant to convey past and present by appropriate verbal forms, end up conveying
present-ness, since the criterion used to deﬁne present-ness is common to all the
three time-forms.
10In the cognition of a cow, what is cognized is an entity that is endowed with the general property
of cowness; this cowness is technically referred to as the qualiﬁer (prakāra) in the cognition.

4.3.6
Time as a Simultaneous Object and Locus
of Cognition [F]
The Naiyāyika opponent has up to now been forced to contend with Śrīharṣa’s
arguments. He now attempts to provide a last deﬁnition of the three time-forms:
present time is the object (viṣaya) as well as the locus (āśraya) of a cognition; past
time is the time delimited (avacchinna) by the prior absence (prāgabhāva) of the
limiting condition (upādhi) imposed on present time; and future time is the time
delimited by the posterior absence (pradhvaṃsābhāva) of that same limiting con-
dition. We will focus here solely on Śrīharṣa’s rejection of the deﬁnition of present
time. The opponent understands present time to consist of two aspects—object and
locus. To be the object (viṣaya) of a cognition means that time is cognized along
with the cognition of a certain entity or activity (e.g., when cognizing a book, both
the book and the time at which cognition occurs are objects of the cognition).
However, if present time were deﬁned only in this way, the deﬁnition would be
over-extensive for several things can be objectiﬁed in the process of cognition.
Thus the opponent adds another qualiﬁcation (viṣeśaṇa) to his deﬁnition: present
time is also the locus (āśraya) of the said cognition, which means that it is the
condition sine qua non of its taking place. Just as cognition, according to
Naiyāyikas, cannot take place without a self (ātman) that supports it, in the same
way cognition cannot take place without time as its support. In other words, every
cognition takes place in time. Note that without the ﬁrst qualiﬁer (i.e., viṣaya) the
deﬁnition would also be over-extensive for it would also apply to the self.
In order to refute this deﬁnition based on the twofold function of time in the
process of cognition, Śrīharṣa looks at the speciﬁc way in which Nyāya understands
cognition.
According
to
Naiyāyikas,
every
cognition
is
followed
by
an
“after-cognition”—a process technically referred to as anuvyavasāya, and otherwise
translated as “reﬂective awareness” or “apperception”—in which the ﬁrst cognition
itself becomes an object of cognition. First, a certain entity or activity is cognized;
then, the fact that it is cognized is itself cognized. In other words, cognition is not
self-evident (svaprakāśa) but can only be the object (viṣaya) of another cognition.
The opponent has just argued that time, more speciﬁcally “present-ness,” is such an
object of cognition. Śrīharṣa’s contention is essentially that this process of
“after-cognition” does not take place at the moment of the ﬁrst cognition—namely
at the time when something was cognized as “present”—but only afterwards. The
implication is that present-ness cannot be cognized at the “present” moment.
4.4
The Advaita View of Time: Citsukha
and Madhusūdana
Since the primary purpose of the KKK is to uphold the principle of indeﬁnability
(anirvacanīyatā) dear to the Advaita Vedānta tradition, Śrīharṣa does not explicitly
deﬁne how time is conceived in Advaita Vedānta. As a matter of fact, prior to
4
Śrīharṣa on the Indeﬁnability of Time
53

Śrīharṣa, the Vedānta tradition does not have much to say about time and its
ontological properties. While the various references to space (ākāśa) in the
Upaniṣads—mostly in the context of describing the manifestation of the physical
world (sṛṣṭiprakriyā)—and the exegetical works of Śaṅkara and others, makes it
clear that the early Vedānta tradition accepted space as an entity having empirical or
transactional reality (vyāvahārikasattā), the same cannot be said with certainty
about time, as there is hardly any discussion about it either in the sections of the
Upaniṣads concerned with sṛṣṭiprakriyā or in their commentaries. It is only much
later, well into the medieval period, that Advaitins come to engage the concept of
time from their own perspective. One of the most detailed discussion of time after
Śrīharṣa is found in the Tattvapradīpikā of Citsukha.
4.4.1
Citsukha
Citsukha (13th century) was a proliﬁc writer in the tradition of Advaita Vedānta. In
his most celebrated work, the Tattvapradīpikā, Citsukha engages with the work of
several prominent Naiyāyikas including Śrīdhara (10th century), Udayanācārya
(10th century) and Vallabhācārya (c. 12th century). The Tattvapradīpikā is a sub-
stantial scholarly treatise in four chapters that is thematically akin to the Brah-
masūtras. In the ﬁrst chapter, Citsukha lays down the theoretical tools required for
approaching the teachings of Advaita Vedānta. In the second chapter, he primarily
engages with the views presented by Naiyāyikas; it is in this chapter that he dwells
at length on their view of time. Unlike Śrīharṣa, however, Citsukha presents his
own position while refuting the Nyāya position.
Throughout the Tattvapradīpikā, Citsukha presents succinctly the theme of a
discussion in the form of verses (śloka) on which he then elaborates at great length,
a style generally referred to as samāsavyāsapaddhati. He begins his discussion on
time with the following verse, where he beautifully summarizes the detailed dis-
cussion that he is going to present in prose later on:
Since time is not an object of sense-perception, given that posteriority, etc. are not [proper]
inferential marks (liṅga) [in order to establish its existence]; since it is not a cause on its
own (svarūpataḥ); since [introducing] a limiting condition (upādhi) [in order to establish its
existence] [also turns out] to be futile; and [ﬁnally,] since it is possible [to establish] the
connection between a material entity (piṇḍa) and the motion of the sun [which is the basis
for reckoning time] merely through the all-pervasive conscious [being] (cetana), how is it
that [time, as an independent, ontologically real entity] gets established?11
Of particular importance for Citsukha is how Naiyāyikas establish the reality of
time. Citsukha argues at length that neither perception nor inference are proper

(Tattvapradīpikā: 510).

means of knowledge (pramāṇa) to establish time as an ontologically real entity.
Recalling Vallabhācārya’s realistic treatment of time in the Nyāyalīlāvatī, Citsukha
says that the ontological reality of a substance (dravya) can be established through
perception (pratyakṣa) if and only if the substance in question has a visible form
(rūpa) and/or has the quality of touch (sparśa). However, according to Naiyāyikas
themselves, time is without form and is intangible, and thus cannot be an object of
perception. Time cannot be perceived through the other sense-organs either since it
is understood that the nose, ears and tongue can only sense qualities (guṇa) and not
substances. Nor can time be perceived through internal or mental perception
(mānasapratyakṣa) since internal perception cannot perceive things that are
external to the body without the assistance of the ﬁve sense-organs.
Citsukha then shows that inference (anumāṇa) too is of no avail to prove the
existence of time. We recall from our previous discussion (Sect. 2) that Naiyāyikas
stress inference as the only means of knowing time. In their view, time is inferred
on the basis of such cognitions as posteriority (paratva), anteriority (aparatva),
simultaneity (yaugapadya), etc., all of which serve as inferential marks (liṅga) in
the inferential process. According to them, such notions could not arise unless there
is an entity called “time” which allows for their arising. Now, inference is possible
only when a relation of invariable concomitance (vyāpti) is established between a
probandum (sādhya, here time) and its inferential mark (liṅga). Citsukha refutes all
arguments adduced by Naiyāyikas to ascertain the concomitance between the
probandum and its marks, required for the inference to take place.
He further asks whether posteriority, anteriority, etc. are manifestations (kārya) of
time or are associated with time through certain external factors (upādhi). If one
holds that they are manifestations of time (time being their inherent cause, nimitta),
there is the problem that time, being unitary, cannot be the cause of various temporal
distinctions. If one admits instead that these various temporal distinctions result from
factors such as the motion of the sun, then the latter can just as well be said to be
sufﬁcient in order to account for conventional temporal usages. What need is there,
in this case, to invoke an independent entity called “time”? Challenging this
explanation offered by Citsukha, a Naiyāyika may well argue: temporal distinctions
such as young, old, etc. are well known to be associated with entities (piṇḍa) that are
present here on earth such as buildings, humans, etc. How can these entities be
explained away simply by invoking some sort of activity of the sun, unless we are
able to bring in a connection between that activity that is supposed to be taking place
somewhere in space, with something that is being present here on earth?
At this point of his argumentation, Citsukha introduces the Advaita view.
According to him, the connection in question can be explained by the all-pervasive
(vyāpin) and conscious being (cetana), which is, he argues, well known and
accepted by proponents of all schools. Of course, Citsukha has in mind the uni-
versal self (ātman) of the Vedāntic tradition, identiﬁed with Brahman in Advaita
Vedānta. If the inert, unitary and all-pervasive (vibhu) time, can bring in, with the
help of limiting conditions (upādhi), the necessary connection between the motion
of the sun, etc. and entities on earth, why not the conscious, unitary and
all-pervasive (vibhu) ātman? Thus to an Advaitin like Citsukha, there is simply no
4

55

convincing reason for accepting the ontological reality of time. Not only is there no
proper means of knowledge that can establish its existence, but there is also no
logical ground to postulate its existence as a separate ontological category given
that its only function is fulﬁlled by another principle, namely ātman.
4.4.2
Madhusūdana Sarasvatī
It is quite clear from the previous that Advaitins do not accept time as a separate
ontological
entity.
In
his
Siddhāntabindu,
the
great
16th-century
scholar
Madhusūdana Sarasvatī argues in the same line but provides a different viewpoint
with regard to time, worth mentioning here:
As for time, it is none other than ignorance (avidyā) itself as precisely [ignorance] is the
locus of everything (sarvādhāra).12
Firstly, Madhusūdana identiﬁes time with avidyā, the primeval ignorance, which
in late Advaita is viewed as the metaphysical principle explaining the origin and
manifestation of the world as well as our mistaken cognitions of plurality and
change. Secondly, he explains this identiﬁcation on the basis that ignorance is the
locus of everything. For Madhusūdana too time has no separate existence but unlike
in Citsukha’s view, it is not because it has no role to play in the working of the
world. On the contrary, Madhusūdana identiﬁes time with avidyā and in this sense
time plays a fundamental role in manifesting the world as plural, changing and
limited. It must be noted that the characterization of time as sarvādhāra—a function
which Madhusūdhana here assigns to ignorance—has its equivalent in the Nyāya
tradition. In the Kārikavalī, Viśvanātha Pañcānana (17th century), reiterating a
point already made earlier by Praśastapāda and others, describes time as the pro-
ducer of all the entities that are produced and the locus (āśraya = ādhāra) of the
entire universe.13 Since in Advaita Vedānta, everything, both tangible and intan-
gible, is considered to be an effect of ignorance (avidyākārya), it is only appropriate
that ignorance should be described here as sarvādhāra. However, the way in which
time and ignorance are considered to “contain” all things differ considerably in
Nyāya and Advaita Vedānta respectively. While ignorance is the locus of all that
exists inasmuch as it is the material cause of all changeable entities (par-
iṇāmyupādāna), time is a locus inasmuch as it is the cause for the arising of
cognitions involving time-forms.
Hence time in Madhusūdana’s deﬁnition has a rather different meaning than in
Nyāya. Through being identiﬁed with avidyā itself, time is relegated to the domain
of things that have a transactional reality (vyāvahārikasattā), in contradistinction to
12kālas tv avidyaiva tasyā eva sarvādhāratvāt (Siddhāntabindu: 66).
13janyā nā ṃjanakaḥ kā lo jagatā ṃā śrayo mataḥ (pratyakṣakhaṇḍa, kālanirūpaṇa, v. 45) (Kār-
ikāvalī: 195).
56

Brahman, which alone has absolute reality (pāramārthikasattā). While Brahman is
the only real existent in Advaita, everything that is phenomenal, including time,
falls into the category of what is only apparently real (mithyā), dependent upon the
higher reality of Brahman for its own existence.
4.5
Conclusion
Nothing is more commonplace than time, yet when it comes to conceptualising and
describing it in words, nothing presents a greater predicament. The experience of
time, whatever be its nature, makes us feel that it must be a real entity. Moreover,
time presents itself as an indispensable tool for the description of natural phe-
nomena, including our daily transactions in the world. In this line of thought, the
realist school of Nyāya defends the view that time is an essential component of the
world and classiﬁes it among substances (dravya) in their scheme of categorizing
the various entities that are ontologically real. In contrast to this, Advaitins hold that
time is a phenomenal product and a human construct (puruṣabuddhiprabhava) that
has no ontological reality. For them, what is “real” (sat) is something that cannot be
denied through some other cognition in all three times (trikālābādhya)—past,
present and future. In other words, what “really is” cannot be described as “it is not,
it will not be, it was not”: it is freed from any trace of time, it is pure timeless-ness.
Since the “time” that is being experienced by us can be described as past, present
and future, it cannot be trikālābādhya and hence cannot be given the status of
something “real.”
It is one thing to have a feel for something and claim that it must be real, but
another to deﬁne it and help the other make sense of the deﬁnition. Though the
Naiyāyikas try hard to deﬁne time in various ways, Śrīharṣa does not ﬁnd these
arguments convincing. Realizing the paradoxical nature of time, Madhusūdana
identiﬁed time with ignorance (avidyā) whose delusive and indescribable nature has
been vividly portrayed in the Vivekacūḍāmaṇi:
It is neither existent nor non-existent, nor is it both; it is neither the same nor different, nor
is it both; it is neither with parts nor partless, nor is it both; [ignorance] is a great wonder
and cannot be described in words.14
Thus we ﬁnd both logicians and philosophers struggling hard to come up with a
coherent deﬁnition of time that is at once convincing and can capture what it is
without beating around the bush. However useful the notion of time may turn out to
be in our daily transactions and in the equations of physics, the more deeply we
ponder over it to understand its nature, the more elusive it turns out to be. Hence, it
is no surprise that Śrīharṣa, one of the most brilliant Advaitins of all times, upholds
the view that time is utterly indeﬁnable.

From Time to Time
Nathan Salmon
5.1
I
The apparent verdict of current theoretical physics is that the prospect of time travel
does not violate general relativity. The philosopher interprets this as a judgment that
time travel is, at a minimum, logically consistent with general relativity. It directly
follows from this judgment that general relativity and time travel are each them-
selves consistent, hence that time travel is logically possible. On the other side of
the coin, philosophers have argued that time travel of the sort depicted in the classic
H.G. Wells’ novella, The Time Machine, is inconsistent with common sense—for
example the notion that one who travels to a past time when his paternal grandfather
is alive but has not yet sired his father, could murder his own grandfather at that
earlier time. This is the famous grandfather paradox. If the reasoning is sound, then
Wellsian time travel—as depicted in The Time Machine, in numerous other
science-ﬁction stories, in thought experiments, and the like—is metaphysically
impossible and perhaps conceptually incoherent.
Time travel essentially involves someone or something changing its temporal
location from one time to another in a manner analogous to motion in space, i.e.,
change in spatial location over time. The ﬁrst of these temporal locations is the time
of origin, to, the second is the time of destination, td. Time travel essentially
The thoughts expressed here are a result of ruminations on the ﬁrst (and much better) ﬁlm
adaption of H. G. Wells’ novella The Time Machine and on trenchant observations made by
Hilary Putnam in his paper “It Ain’t Necessarily So”. The essay beneﬁtted from discussions with
C. Anthony Anderson, Mark Fiocco, Stephen Humphrey, Teresa Robertson. Heather Salazar,
and the late Anthony Brueckner.

involves something embarking on a purely temporal voyage, “moving” through
time in a manner analogous to spatial motion. In one sense, mere temporal per-
sistence is a kind of time travel; it is motion from present to immediate future at a
rate of one (second per second), the constant rate of the passage of time. Insofar as
ordinary persistence is a kind of temporal motion, it is arguably impossible not to
travel in time. For what would it be to remain stationary in time?
Wellsian time travel is continuous temporal motion through time that deviates
from standard temporal motion. It is traversing a span of time during some other
interval of time. It essentially involves changing temporal location other than at the
rate by which time passes from to to td—deviating from the timeline segment that
begins with to (without also remaining in that timeline), traveling temporally other
than forward and at the same rate as the passage of time, and ﬁnally “arriving” at
the timeline segment that begins with td. Henceforth I shall normally use the phrase
‘time travel’ and its cognates to mean Wellsian time travel.
I here undertake a philosophical investigation into the concept of Wellsian time
travel. I shall also consider the prospect of backward (or retro-) causation as a
genuine possibility, in the weak sense of mere logical consistency. That is, I shall
assume that there is no formal contradiction in the very idea of A causing B though
B precedes A. Backward time travel, at least taken in conjunction with common
sense, immediately entails backward causation. (The grandfather’s future progeny
causes his own death.) The champion of Wellsian time travel is committed to this
assumption. Gainsayers may object, but they would be mistaken. Experience with
the law demonstrates that the assumption is correct.1
Objections to Wellsian time travel along the lines of the grandfather paradox and
similar bilking arguments typically should be regarded as modal arguments to the
effect that backward time travel has the consequence that someone can do or be
something that it is impossible to do or be (e.g., be sired by a father who never
exists). When the argument’s structure is laid bare, a signiﬁcant weakness is
immediately exposed. The premises do not support the conclusion that Wellsian
time travel is impossible. At most they yield only that backward time travel is
impossible.2 The prospect of forward time travel is left unscathed.
1Backward causation by judicial decree is causation between institutional “events”, not between
brute facts, but backward causation it is. It is not analytic that if A causes B, then B does not
precede A.
2The argument is valid only in modal logics stronger than T. I believe T is the correct logic of
metaphysical modality, so that the argument is fallacious. The argument can be alternatively
formulated so that it is valid even in T.

As David Lewis noted, the concept of time travel presupposes a distinction between
two kinds of time.3 The time traveler is a two-timer (in at least one sense). First,
there is real time, tr, through which the time traveler travels. This is also called
‘common time’, ‘objective’, ‘external’, ‘coordinate’, ‘global’, ‘local’ (yes, both!),
and more. It is also called simply ‘time’. Real time is to time travel as physical
space is to spatial motion: It is the “space” through which the time traveler travels.
In addition there is the time traveler’s proper time (‘rest’, ‘home’, ‘clock’, ‘process’,
‘personal’, ‘time-traveler’, ‘intrinsic’, ‘subjective’), tp. A time traveler’s proper time
is what the traveler’s wristwatch tracks—as with the inattentive globe trotter who
does not diligently readjust a personal timepiece when travelling across time zones.
Proper time is to time travel as real time is to spatial motion. It is the dimension over
or during which the change in location occurs. The real time of origin to coincides
with the proper time of “departure”, immediately after which proper time begins
deviating from real time. The proper time at the real destination time td is the time
traveler’s time of arrival.
Trivially, real time and proper time each ﬂows from past to future at a ﬁxed rate
relative to itself of one (second per second), irrespective of the time traveler’s
circumstances. To that extent, both kinds of time are objective. There is the
mundane circumstance of trivial temporal motion if, and only if, the would-be time
traveler moves forward through real time at the same rate as the passage of real
time, and thus neither gains nor loses any real time over proper time. In it the two
kinds of time coincide exactly; where there is only trivial temporal motion, tp = tr.
There is Wellsian time travel if and only if the intrinsic arrival time is not the real
destination time. The proper time of the Wellsian time traveler gains on real time,
lags behind real time, reverses with respect to real time—or maybe freezes with
respect to real time.
Imagine an amusement-park conveyance ride called Travels through Time. The
rider is seated on a bicycle labeled ‘TIME MACHINE’. The bicycle sits upon the
conveyer belt at an illuminated position labeled ‘HOME TIME’. The conveyance
and illumination each move forward, carrying the rider and bicycle along with
them, at a constant rate of one inch per second. Second by second, inch by inch, the
rider and bicycle move their way through the long, darkened corridor labeled
‘HALL OF TIME’, their changing position constantly illuminated. Through the
mist, to the right and left of the conveyer belt are signs pointing the way ahead and
marked ‘FUTURE’ and other signs pointing backward and marked ‘PAST’, amidst
scenes and photographs from history, all arranged in chronological sequence. The
rider is free simply to maintain HOME TIME position on the conveyer belt, sit
back, allow the conveyance to do all the transporting labor, and enjoy the show.

the rider is encouraged to change position on the conveyer belt by cycling either
forward or backward atop the moving belt. In so doing, the rider moves not merely
relative to the HALL, but also relative to the HOME TIME conveyer position,
which is itself in motion relative to the HALL.
It may be taken as a deﬁnition of ‘time travel’ that there is a process (the
temporal voyage) that something x (the time traveler) undergoes immediately fol-
lowing upon a particular real time to (the time of origin), that has a duration dp (a
positive quantity) in x’s proper time, and as a result of which when x’s proper time
is to + dp (the arrival time), x is at a real td other than to + dp. A time machine is any
device that produces Wellsian time travel. In Wellsian time travel there are no
restrictions concerning the origin time, the proper-time duration, or the real desti-
nation time. These deﬁnitions are satisfactory only to the extent that the presup-
posed notion of proper time is independently and antecedently understood. In
particular, the notion thus deﬁned cannot be invoked to deﬁne proper time. The
latter might be independently understood operationally, in terms of the time trav-
eler’s “clocks,” the temporal order of the time traveler’s intrinsic periodic processes
—circadian rhythm, digestion, growth, sleep, reasoning, learning, other mental
processing, etc., and especially entropy (aging, deterioration, degradation, or
decay).4
Some facts of time travel follow immediately from the concept. Among these
truisms are the following facts about any temporal voyage:
TT1
The time traveler exists at the real time of origin, to.
TT2
The time traveler exists at the real time of destination, td.
Both TT1 and TT2 follow immediately from the fact that the statement ‘At time t,
x is located at ℓ’ analytically entails ‘x exists at t’.5
Assume that the temporal voyage proper-time duration dp is not zero. During the
temporal voyage the rate of the passage of proper time deviates from that of real
time. A single unit of proper time (e.g., 1 min) is of different duration from the
same unit of real time. Without this deviation between intrinsic and real time there
is only trivial temporal motion. There is a temporal exchange rate, which may vary
during the temporal voyage. If 1 min of proper time uniformly buys the time
traveler 1 h of real time, then, assuming there is conservation of time variance,
4The proposed deﬁnition is essentially Lewis’s characterization of time travel (op. cit., p. 145),
which is often taken as a deﬁnition. Since the temporal voyage duration d is a measure of intrinsic
(“personal”) time, not of real time, Lewis’s characterization also presupposes the notion of proper
time, and therefore cannot be used to deﬁne the latter. Lewis proposes that proper time be deﬁned
functionally rather than operationally. (He does not provide an actual deﬁnition.).
5If it is assumed that ‘x moves from ℓ1 at t1 to ℓ2 at t2’ analytically entails ‘Between t1 and t2,
x traverses a path from ℓ1 to ℓ2’, then we might have the further result that the time traveler exists
also during its temporal voyage, if the temporal-voyage duration d > 0. If it is assumed further-
more that motion requires traversing a continuous path, then we might have the further result that
the time traveler exists continuously during its temporal voyage, if the temporal-voyage duration
d > 0.

1 min of real time lasts only one second of proper time. Proper time is therewith
contracted relative to real time. In science-ﬁction stories, proper time is typically
contracted during a temporal voyage rather than dilated, but the reverse is con-
ceptually possible. (Arguably it is even actual.)
TT3
Barring multiple temporal voyages, the time traveler’s proper time, tp,
coincides with real time, tr, at the time of origin, to, and deviates from real
time beginning immediately thereafter.
An object’s (average) rate of time travel over a proper-time interval i is the ratio of
real time spanned during i (a positive or negative quantity) to elapsed proper time
(the positive quantity of time in i), Δtr/Δtp. In Wellsian time travel, the time-travel
rate may be any positive or negative ratio without restriction. Rather than express
Δtr/Δtp as a ratio between interval lengths, I shall convert it to a scalar, e.g., for the
particular time-travel rate spanning backward 4 s of real time for every 3 s of
elapsed proper time I write ‘ttr = –1.33’. If the time traveler is transported to
another time instantaneously, then the ratio of spanned real time to elapsed proper
time is division by zero, hence ttr is undeﬁned. The greater its range of time-travel
rates, the more powerful the time machine.
The average time-travel rate over an entire temporal-voyage v is (td – to)/dp.
A simple relationship thus obtains among the origin time (to), the real destination
time (td), the temporal-voyage proper-time duration (dp), and the temporal-voyage
time-travel rate (ttrv):
td = to + ttrv dp


.
In the special case where ttrv = 1, td = to + dp, i.e., the intrinsic arrival time is
the real destination time. There is Wellsian time travel over the course of the
temporal voyage v if and only if ttrv ≠1. This is the case if and only if there is
non-zero acceleration or deceleration both immediately after the temporal-voyage
origin time to (immediately after which proper time begins to deviate from real
time) and at the proper time of arrival to + dp (when proper time resumes ﬂowing at
the constant real-time rate). A time traveler may also accelerate or decelerate during
a single temporal voyage. An object’s instantaneous time-travel rate during a
sub-voyage is the limit of the average time-travel rate Δtr/Δtp as Δtp approaches 0.
The real time reached during a temporal voyage v is a function of proper time,
tr = ρv(tp). The instantaneous time-travel rate is the ﬁrst time derivative, dtr/dtp. To
simplify discussion we shall assume that the time traveler travels at a uniform
time-travel rate throughout the temporal voyage—no acceleration or deceleration
between the origin and arrival times—so that dtr/dtp remains constant throughout
the temporal voyage (e.g., 60 = 1 h of real time to 1 min of proper time).
The gain of real time over proper time during a proper-time interval i is the total
quantity of excess real time purchased during i, Δtr −Δtp. An object’s (average)
rate of gain, gr, of real time over proper time during a proper-time interval i is the
ratio of gained real time to elapsed proper time, (Δtr −Δtp)/Δtp. This ﬁgure is the
5
From Time to Time
65

difference between the time-travel rate and the constant no-time-travel rate of one
unit of real time per unit of proper time, i.e., gr = Δtr/Δtp – 1. The gain over the
entire temporal voyage is the difference between the quantity of spanned real time
and the proper-time duration, td – to – dp. This is also the difference between the real
destination time and the intrinsic arrival time, td – (to + dp). If the proper-time
duration is 5 min and the average time-travel rate is 12, so that the time traveler
buys one real hour in just 5 intrinsic minutes (arriving 1 h into the future of the
origin time), then there is a gain of 55 min of real time over proper time. By
contrast, if the duration is 5 min and the average time-travel rate is −12, so that the
time traveler arrives one hour into the past after only 5 min, then there is a loss of
65 min (a gain of −65 min) of real time over proper time. Gain rates reﬂect the
asymmetry of time.
The analog of time-travel rate in the amusement-park ride is the rider’s linear
velocity relative to the real HALL OF TIME—the speed at which the rider moves
through the HALL, forward (positive) or backward (negative). The analog of the
gain rate is the rider’s linear velocity relative to the HOME TIME position on the
conveyance—the speed at which the rider moves ahead (positive) or behind (neg-
ative) the HOME TIME position, which is itself in motion relative to the HALL. If
the rider simply maintains position on the conveyance, the former velocity is a ratio
of 1 (inches:seconds), i.e., one inch (representing one second) of progress through
the corridor for every second of rider time, while the latter velocity is 0. If the rider
cycles backward atop the conveyance at two inches per second, the rider therewith
travels relative to the HOME TIME position at a rate of −2. However, since the
HOME TIME position is forging ahead relative to the HALL at 1, the rider therewith
travels relative to the HALL at a ratio of only −1. Backward time travel is harder
work than forward, because of relentless time pressure.
Time-travel rates fall into several categories, each category corresponding to a
unique time-travel orientation. The most distinctive categories are: time-travel rates
greater than 1; 1 itself; negative time-travel rates; those between 0 and 1; and 0
itself. These are collectively exhaustive of all time-travel rates. Among negative
time-travel rates are three distinctive sub-categories: −1; those less than −1; and
those between −1 and 0. Interest is typically focused on time-travel rates that are
either greater than 1 or less than 0. There is forward time travel, whereby the time
traveler gains on real time, if and only if the time-travel rate is greater than 1. If the
time-travel rate is uniformly 1.33, then the time traveler travels forward 1.33 s
through real time for every second of proper time. There is backward time travel,
whereby the time traveler travels in reverse through real time, if and only if the
time-travel rate is negative.
There are three limit rates, at which the orientation of time-travel takes on a very
distinctive character: 1, 0, and −1. As we have seen, the time-travel rate is exactly 1
if and only if there is only trivial time travel. The time-travel rate is exactly 0 if and
only if there is freeze-frame time travel, in which the time traveler remains sta-
tionary with respect to real time. This is the bleak and lonely circumstance in which
time literally stands still for the time traveler, who is stalled at some real time.
(Notice, however, that there is no real-time interval during which the time traveler is
66
N. Salmon

in this peculiar circumstance.) Backward time travel in reverse real time is traveling
to the past at a rate of −1. At this time-travel rate, ten minutes into the temporal
voyage the time traveler travels exactly ten minutes into the past.
The time-travel rate is a positive fraction, more than 0 but less than 1, if and only
if there is lag-behind time travel, in which time traveler moves forward in time but
at a slower rate than the passage of real time. This is a circumstance in which the
real world appears to the time traveler to be moving in slow motion, because a
single second of proper time is of shorter duration that one second of real time.6
Table 5.1 provides various time-travel orientations and their corresponding rates.
At the end of the temporal voyage, the proper and real times are distinct but the
ﬂow of the former re-synchronizes with the latter. Proper time returns to moving
forward at a rate of exactly one real second per time-traveler second. The
time-travel rate returns to exactly 1, the gain-rate to 0.
5.3

What real time is it during the temporal voyage? The narrative of a time-travel story
typically follows proper time. In telling a time-travel story in time-traveler
chronological sequential order, the storyteller implicitly relies on an important fact:
There is a function, tr = ρ(tp), that speciﬁes what real time it is at any particular
proper time. If there is only one temporal voyage v, and the real time reached during
v is given as a function of proper time, tr = ρv(tp), then ρ may be given as follows:
If tp is earlier than the time of origin (tp ≤to), then ρ(tp) = tp;
if tp is within the temporal voyage (to < tp < to + dp), then ρ(tp) = to + ρv(tp –
to) = to + ttrv(tp – to); and

6Special relativity has the conﬁrmed consequence that a dilation of time relative to a frame of
reference is achieved simply by moving about relative to that reference frame. Arguably, anything
that is in motion relative to a reference-frame ipso facto has a time-travel rate less than 1 with
respect to that reference-frame. It is highly relevant, however, that this phenomenon is not typically
thought of or described as a form of time travel. Instead it is thought of and described as a
“slowing” of the traveler’s time relative to a perspective regarded as stationary. The present
discussion envisions that a single frame of reference is held ﬁxed throughout.

if tp is the same as or later than the proper time of arrival (tp ≥to + dp), then
ρ(tp) = tp + td – (to + dp).
Upon arrival and afterward, the real time is the sum of the proper time and the
gained real time. In particular, ρ(to + dp) = td, i.e., when proper time is the time of
arrival, real time is the destination time.
In forward time travel (ttr > 0) there is a 1–1 function, tp = τ(tr), that speciﬁes
what proper time it is at any particular real time. This function is simply the
converse of ρ. It may be given as follows:
If tr ≤to, then τ(tr) = tr;
if to < tr < td, then τ(tr) = to + (tr −to)/ttrv;
and if tr ≥td, then τ(tr) = (to + dp) + tr −td.
When real time tr is later than or the same as the destination time td, proper time
tp is later than the arrival time to + dp by exactly the same interval that tr is later
than the destination time td.
If the temporal voyage is backward, the correspondence of proper time to real
time is one-many, hence not a function. This points to a signiﬁcant asymmetry
between forward time travel and backward. The converse of the one-many corre-
lation is ρ. For times within the negatively spanned real time, there are at least two
different proper times: one before the temporal voyage and one during as seen from
the inside. If the spanned real time is short enough, corresponding to a single real
time tr earlier than to, there can be three different proper times: one before, one
during, and one after the temporal voyage. This correlation between real times and
proper times is also highly systematic.
5.4
IV
The concept of proper time is integral to the concept of time travel. If the primary
philosophical question concerning time travel is whether it is a metaphysical pos-
sibility, then a secondary but important philosophical question concerning time
travel is: What exactly is proper time? What also is the nature of the correspon-
dence between proper and real time? Lewis writes, “I [distinguish] time itself …
from the personal time of a particular time traveler … the time-traveler’s personal
time … isn’t really time, but it plays the role in his life that time plays in the life of a
common person” (op. cit., p. 146). Lewis’s concession that proper time is not
genuinely time is more serious than he recognizes. It would, if correct, exclude the
very possibility of Wellsian time travel. Proper time plays the functional role of
time in the analogy with spatial motion. The time traveler moves from one real time
to another during an interval spanning from one proper time to a later one.
Time-travel rate is deﬁned in terms of elapsed proper time, not elapsed real time;
the instantaneous time-travel rate is the time derivative of ρv with respect to proper
time, not with respect to real time. If time travel, deﬁned as the temporal analog of
68
N. Salmon

spatial motion, is genuine—if continuous nonstandard re-location in real time over
proper time is a possible phenomenon—then proper time must be genuine time of
some kind, and yet not real time. Since real time is just time (simpliciter), the very
notion of time travel requires that proper time be a sub-phenomenon of real time.
Real time is made up of real times, the values of ‘tr’. Proper time is made up of
proper times, the values of ‘tp’. If proper time is time of a certain kind—as it must
be for time travel to be the temporal analog of spatial motion—then proper times
are times of a certain kind. Are the values of ‘tp’ of a different character from those
of ‘tr’? For example, is the intrinsic arrival time, to + dp, metaphysically different in
nature from the real destination time, td? Is proper time a subjective phenomenon of
some sort, a shadow of real time? Is the intrinsic arrival time, or is proper time
while en route, perhaps an alien time, outside and orthogonal to the real timeline?
Proper time is none of these things. It is not subjective in any signiﬁcant sense.
Nor is it an alien time, nor metaphysically peculiar in any way.7 If a time traveler
from to were to arrive at td at an alien time, it would make no sense to attempt to
place the intrinsic arrival time as earlier than, later than, or identical with, any
particular real time. Proper times are times like any other. For each proper time tp,
there is a particular real time tr such that tp just is tr. In particular, the proper time of
arrival is identical with a particular real time, one that is not the real destination
time. It is just the particular real time to + dp that is later than (subsequent to,
downstream on the real timeline from) to by exactly the duration dp of the temporal
voyage. Contrary to Lewis, the proper-time dimension is simply ordinary time.
Even the proper times that elapse during the temporal voyage itself are identical
with particular real times. In fact, despite TT3, the duration of an en route proper
time is exactly the same as that of the real time with which it is identical. They are
the very same thing. Proper times are just the real times from the departed time-
frame—each one shining temporarily in sequence, then replaced, one following
upon another, with real presentness ﬂowing forward in step as if nothing remark-
able has just taken place. Indeed, nothing remarkable happens intrinsically to the
times themselves; it is the time traveler that undergoes a remarkable process. The
time traveler’s proper timeframe deviates from the timeframe of origin. Despite the
time traveler’s deviation from the original timeframe, that timeframe itself is
unscathed; time continues to ﬂow even if un-graced by the time traveler’s presence.
Both during and after the temporal voyage, the departed timeframe is identical with
the traveler’s proper time.
Proper times are also real times. Whether a time is designated ‘real’ or alter-
natively as ‘proper’ depends on whether it is treated as the value or the argument of
7Lewis, op. cit., argues that intrinsic (“personal”) time is not a temporal dimension orthogonal to
real (“external”) time (p. 145). His instinct is correct but his argument is fallacious. Contrary to his
major premise, one who travels backward in time to visit with childhood friends is at the same real
time as his/her friends but his/her proper time is then indeed different from theirs. Lewis’s claim
that proper time “isn’t really time” is also importantly incorrect. What are different are the time
traveler’s relations to time.

ρ. Although every proper time is a real time, if Wellsian time travel is genuine, then
the correspondence ρ between a proper time and a real time is not strict identity.
If proper times are just real times, and yet TT3 is a fundamental truism about
time travel, is time travel then metaphysically impossible? On the other side of the
coin, if time travel is possible and governed by TT3, how can proper times be real
times?
As a prelude to answering these questions, we must ﬁrst engage in a different
line of inquiry. What timeline segment does the time traveler persist in immediately
following the temporal voyage? Is it a proper timeline, to be treated as an argument
to ρ? Is it a real timeline, to be treated as a value of ρ? Or is the time traveler at two
different timelines, both proper and real time simultaneously, i.e., both at a single
real time?
In absolute time—alternatively, within a single frame of reference—the answer
must be that the post-voyage backward time traveler persists in real time and not in
proper time. Otherwise the time traveler would remain in the original timeframe;
there would be no genuine time-travel departure, as such. Proper time is a logical
construct generated by the temporal order and rhythm of the time traveler’s
“clocks” (periodic processes of deterioration and the like)—a genuine timeframe, to
be sure, but one through which the backward time traveler does not persist at all
(unless the time traveler does so independently of the temporal voyage, e.g., by
engaging in a separate temporal voyage). The time showing on the time traveler’s
personal timepiece upon arrival is a reading of his/her proper time.
What timeline segment does the backward time traveler persist in during the
temporal voyage? Here again, the answer has to be that the backward time traveler
is at real time, even if proper time is dilated or contracted relative to real time.
Indeed, each time during the voyage may be seen as a layover arrival/destination
time. The layover is of the best kind: very short but not too short. (It is in fact
instantaneous, but that is long enough.) If the time traveler passes through the
Roaring 20’s on the way to 1,000,000 B.C., then the traveler existed during the
Roaring 20’s, even though (as the traveler might say) “it went by very fast … and
backward”.
This is more or less how time travel is depicted in The Time Machine. The Time
Traveler witnesses the world change (or return to its pre-change state) before his
very eyes. But there is a ﬂaw in Wells’ reasoning about Wellsian time travel. The
Time Traveler is there—or rather, he is then—at each real time through which he
passes. If he is indeed “then”, why is it that the people around him at that very time
do not see him there? He sees them; they should see him as well. Unless something
very strange is occurring, they would indeed see him—and he would appear to be
behaving peculiarly, moving and talking very slowly … and backward.
From to forward, proper time is just the real time of the time-traveler’s original
timeframe. Proper time corresponds to the position marked ‘HOME TIME’ on the
amusement-park ride. Proper time is home time, the very timeframe that the time
traveler left behind. It is analogous to the international traveler who upon arriving at
LAX says “I’m on Asian time”. Proper time is the temporal analog of jetlag. It is
time-machine lag. Proper time is evidently a construct of a certain kind, based
70
N. Salmon

entirely on the progressively changing states of the time traveler’s intrinsic temporal
processes.
In labeling a time ‘proper’ rather than ‘real’, we are not distinguishing it in its
nature from time as we know it. In particular, we are not positing a subjective,
shadowy, parallel temporal dimension orthogonal to real time. Rather, we are
marking time off in terms of the time traveler’s relations to it. The rationale for
calling a time ‘proper’ rather than ‘real’ concerns the relation that the time traveler
bears toward it. The (nontrivial) time traveler is at a particular time, and therewith
bears a different relation to a different time, the latter time being labeled the time
traveler’s ‘proper time’. Let us say that the time traveler is at real time and on
proper time. The time traveler is on one time when at a different time; the time the
traveler is at is called ‘real time’; the time the traveler is on is called ‘proper time’.
Everything is on its proper time. Most of us are also on real time. The backward
time traveler is not at proper time when on it. Asian time is a real time, but the
jetlagged traveler is not at it. Analogously, proper time is time, but the post-voyage
backward time traveler is not at it.
If something is travelling through time at a rate of 60, then one second of proper
time buys 1 min of real time. A second of time lasts exactly 1 s, a minute exactly
1 min, an hour exactly 1 h. One must resist the temptation to think that the time
traveler is at an hour for only a minute. Rather, the time traveler remains on a single
minute while at an entire hour. The time traveler is at a time even if the intrinsic
clocks are on a different timeframe.
5.5
V
Someone who is about to travel back to 1,000,000 B.C. was there already—or
rather, the time traveler was then already. The soon-to-be time traveler already
existed in prehistoric times. The pre-voyage time traveler visited the prehistoric
world in pre-history, when it was present (in the non-indexical sense). The time
traveler is about to cease to be. In general, if a soon-to-be time traveler is “about,” in
proper time, to travel to a past time td, then the traveler was already at td before the
temporal voyage. Moreover, since the soon-to-be backward time traveler is really
about to depart from the current real timeframe, the time traveler is not about to
arrive at td; the traveler is about to cease to exist. Rejecting either of these truisms
leads to a serious misunderstanding of what time travel is supposed to be. More
generally, we have the following additional fact about any backward temporal
voyage:
TT4
The backward time traveler does not exist at the particular time to + dp—
unless the traveler either exists at an earlier time and simply persists to
to + dp, or embarks on a separate temporal voyage and travels to to + dp (or
both).
5
From Time to Time
71

We do not make the claim about forward time travel analogous to TT4.
Real-time to + dp is the time that the time traveler is on upon arrival at td. Where
ttr > 1 and dp > 0, to + dp < td and therefore,
τ to + dp


= to + dp ̸ttr < to + dp.
That is, in forward time travel, if the intrinsic duration dp is non-zero, then to + dp
precedes the destination time td, and therefore the proper time corresponding to
real-time to + dp precedes to + dp itself. The proper time corresponding to to + dp
is still within the temporal voyage.
TT5
The forward time traveler whose time-travel rate is greater than 1 is en route
to the destination time td at the particular time to + dp.
This is in keeping with TT3. The contrast between TT4 and TT5 points to another
asymmetry between forward time travel and backward.
Putting TT2 together with TT4 and TT5, we obtain a puzzling result: At the
proper arrival time to + dp, the fast-forward time traveler is not yet at the real
destination time td; worse yet, the backward time traveler does not even exist at
to + dp (except in special circumstances and for independent reasons). Either way,
the time traveler makes it to the real destination time, but does not arrive there at
the proper arrival time. How is this possible?
The seemingly bizarre fact is made possible by the distinction between being at a
time and being on it. When the time traveler is on t, the traveler is at ρ(t). Whether
the traveler is at a time that the traveler is on is another matter. The time traveler is
on the proper arrival time at the real destination time, but is not then at the proper
arrival time. At the proper arrival time the time traveler is not on it. The backward
time traveler is not at the proper arrival time at all (again, except in special
circumstances).
The phenomenon generally referred to as ‘time travel’ is so-called only insofar
as it is viewed from the perspective of the agent undergoing the process. From this
perspective proper time is time simpliciter. But from the perspective of real time—
the default perspective—it emerges that the phenomenon in question is not
objectively temporal re-location. It is only temporal re-location when seen from the
inside. As seen from the objective observor’s contrasting vantage point, the object
undergoing the process is undergoing a change, but not a change of temporal
location (other than ordinary persistence). Rather, the change is a de-synchro-
nization of the object’s intrinsic temporal processes with the passage of real time.
Viewed from the perspective of spectator, the object’s intrinsic “clocks” (aging,
deterioration, etc.) are running slow, or fast, or backward, or jumping instanta-
neously. Importantly, it is a phenomenon intrinsic to the object undergoing the
process. What looks from the inside like temporal re-location is, as seen by the
spectator, a diachronic recalibration of the object’s temporal processes.
An object’s (average) rate of passage of proper time over a real-time interval i is
the ratio of proper time spanned during i (a positive or negative quantity) to elapsed
72
N. Salmon

real time (the positive quantity of time in i), Δtp/Δtr. Likewise, an object’s in-
stantaneous rate of passage of proper time is the limit of Δtp/Δtr as Δtr approaches
0. The proper-time passage rate is thus the reciprocal of the (so-called) time-travel
rate, the instantaneous proper-time passage rate the reciprocal of the instantaneous
time-travel rate. An object is on real time if, and only if, its proper-time passage rate
is 1. The spectator’s perspective yields an inversion of the time-traveler’s per-
spective. Table 5.2 provides various proper-time orientations with respect to real
time,
their
corresponding
passage
rates,
and
corresponding
“time-travel”
orientations.
From the passive spectator’s perspective, and from the perspective of the non-
participant, so-called time travel is ordinary persistence, or discontinuous persis-
tence, coupled with very peculiar phenomena—walking, talking, processing, aging,
and deteriorating too slowly, or too quickly, or too abruptly, or too backward. In
particular, from the spectator’s vantage point the phenomenon of so-called back-
ward time travel is persistence together with both a reversal of the subject’s intrinsic
processes and a philosophical profanity: backward causation. A backward time
traveller’s presence in 1912 was caused by events that would transpire years later,
well after their effect. The causation is forward in proper time but backward in real
time.
On this re-conceptualization of time travel, the notion of freeze-frame time travel
corresponds to an instantaneous jump in proper time. The corresponding
proper-time passage rate is division by zero, hence undeﬁned. For the freeze-frame
time traveler it is as if time were passing, yet this does not occur during any interval
of real time. In effect, while en route to td the freeze-frame time traveler is ejected
from the ﬂow of time into a temporal limbo.
One possible phenomenon often referred to as ‘time travel’ is perfectly coherent,
including backward time travel. There is no logical inconsistency in the idea of an
individual’s intrinsic temporal processes running backward. However, so-called
backward time travel, construed as taking place over real time, involves an indi-
vidual popping into existence ex nihilo. This conﬂicts with accepted natural laws.
Worse, in some cases, the popping into existence occurs at a time td prior to the
individual’s birth. Even if this is logically coherent, it is arguably quite impossible
metaphysically.

Philosophers debate whether a possible phenomenon should be regarded as time
travel, as normally understood.8 Yet it appears from the foregoing that there is a
single metaphysically possible phenomenon that may be equally legitimately
regarded as time travel or, alternatively, as the de-synchronization of an object’s
intrinsic clocks with real time, depending only on perspective. Whether one
describes the phenomenon in question as a change in real time with respect to
proper time, or instead as a change in proper time with respect to real time, in some
sense the same facts are captured. The two descriptions are equivalent—two sides
of the same coin, six of one and a half-dozen of the other, two inversions of the
same chord, two Sinne converging on the same Bedeutung.
In many contexts, and especially in science ﬁction, the description in terms of
time travel is favored over the other, although the other is generally the less mis-
leading description. With spatial motion—continuous change in position from one
spatial location to another over time—the spatial traveler is at the former location at
one time and at the latter location at a later time, having traversed a path between the
two locations in the interim. This appears to be integral to the very concept of motion
(re-location; change in position). If time travel is the temporal analog of spatial
relocation, then by analogy the time traveler is at one temporal location to at one time
t, and at a different temporal location td at a time t′ subsequent to t. But that much is
true of everything that persists from to to td (or the other way as the case may be),
time traveler or no, since to and td are themselves such a pair of times <t, t′>. If
something x exists at a time t, then at that very time t, x is at t. There is no more
relocation-to-a-different-time occurring with the intrepid time traveler than occurs
with the guy ﬂipping burgers at the local eatery. A so-called time traveler may be on
proper time, but the traveler persists in real time.
As deﬁned, time travel is not the temporal analog of spatial motion. Talk of ‘time
travel’ relies heavily on shifting from real time to proper time at crucial junctures.
We tend to think of proper time simply as time and of the destination time as a
different place. These modes of thinking are confused. The destination time is not a
place; it is a real time. Proper time is also time, but the so-called time traveler is
merely on it. Traveling from a timeline segment beginning with to, to another
beginning with td, the time traveler is at the former timeline segment when on to,
and at the latter timeline segment when on to + dp. But the forward time traveler is
still en route to td when at to + dp and the backward time traveler does not even
exist at to + dp. In either case the time traveler exists at the corresponding real
destination time, td, but in either case the time traveler also persists all the while
from to to td, or from td to to.
Authentic Wellsian time travel requires a more full-blooded, non-metaphorical
notion of two-timing. Insofar as spatial motion is relocation in space over time,
authentic time travel is relocation in time over time at a rate other than 1. What is

commonly referred to as ‘time travel’, both in science ﬁction and in science proper,
is simulated time travel. The simulation is accomplished by treating real time as
space while treating proper time as real time, pretending that the protagonist is at a
time that in fact, or within the story, the traveler is merely on, not at. The storyteller
or theorist completes the charade by letting the narrative follow proper time instead
of (or in addition to) real time, while relegating real time to a kind of spatial
dimension rather than temporal. The subject is depicted as changing “temporal
location over time.” This is not the same thing as the subject’s proper time merely
being out of sync with real time. In authentic Wellsian time travel there must be two
non-overlapping times such that when the time traveler is at one of them, the
traveler is not only on but also somehow at the other. At real time tr, the traveler is
not only on tp, by virtue of the traveler’s intrinsic clocks being set to tp, but also
somehow at tp in addition to being at tr. At one time the traveler is at two times. But
it is unclear what this could be. A new notion of being at a time would be required,
one that allows for something to be at two non-overlapping times at one of them,
and so at one time at a non-overlapping time. But this seems precluded by the very
concept and logic of being at a time. This fact challenges the very conceptual
possibility of Wellsian time travel.

Why Spacetime Has a Life of Its Own
James Robert Brown
Thinking about the nature of space and time goes back to antiquity, but I will start
with Isaac Newton (1642–1727). He famously wrote in his Principia, “Absolute,
true, and mathematical time, in and of itself and of its own nature, without refer-
ence to anything external, ﬂows uniformly and by another name is called duration....
Absolute space, of its own nature without reference to anything external, always
remains homogeneous and immovable.... Absolute motion is the change of position
of a body from one absolute place to another...” (Newton, Principia Scolium to def-
inition 8)
The bucket thought experiment was oﬀered as evidence for this view. In stage I
in the following Fig. 6.1 the water and bucket are at rest with respect to one another
and the water surface is ﬂat. In stage II the water and bucket are rotating with respect
to one another. In stage III the water and bucket are back to being at rest with respect
to one another, but the surface is now concave. How do we explain the diﬀerence
between I and III? The diﬀerence, says Newton, is that the water-bucket system is
at rest with respect to space in I and is rotating with respect to space in III. Thus,
he concludes, space exists. This is a standard form of explanation, used widely in
the sciences. If the germ theory of disease is the best explanation for various forms
of illness, then germs exist. If space is the best explanation for inertial motion, then
space exists.
There are several ingredients involved in Newton’s conception of absolute space
and time.
1. Space (as well as time) is a substance, an entity in its own right. Consider a basket
of apples. The basket is just as real as the apples in it. Space is taken to be a
container, like a basket, and every bit as real. Of course, like any analogy, it can’t
be pushed too far. A basket is a material object like an apple, and one basket could

be put in another. Space is not a material object and is not itself in space. Space
consists of points which are possible locations of bodies, but these points exist
whether they are occupied or not.
2. Every point of space and every point of time is exactly like every other point. As
we move west, for instance, the points of space are identical to those we occupied
earlier—except for their location.
3. Location in space (and in time) is absolute, as is velocity. Thanks to Galilean
relativity, however, the laws of nature are the same in any frame, as long as the
frame is moving inertially.
4. Absolute location and velocity are not detectable. However, acceleration (non-
inertial motion) is observable. Newton’s famous bucket thought experiment is
tied to this and is presented as evidence for the existence of absolute space.
5. Space is the source of inertia. Bodies, according to Newton’s ﬁrst law, tend to
move in straight lines or remain at rest unless acted upon by a force. Space is
causally responsible for inertial motion.
The correspondence between Samuel Clarke (1675–1729) and Gottfried Wilhelm
von Leibniz (1646–1716) is one of the great scientiﬁc exchanges of all time. Clarke
was a close associate of Newton, and it is widely believed Newton had a big hand in
Clarke’s side of the exchange. Leibniz and Clarke argued about many things includ-
ing the principles of dynamics and the nature of God, but the chief topic of interest

79
was the nature of space and time. Clarke upheld Newton’s absolutism while Leibniz
attacked it and oﬀered his relational account in its place. He put his relationalism
succinctly, saying, “I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is; that I
hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions.” (Leibniz,
Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, letter III, Sect. 4, p. 25f)
Leibniz attempted to refute any sort of absolutist view with a remarkable argu-
ment based on symmetry considerations. First he posits the Principle of Suﬃcient
Reason: Nothing happens without a reason why it should be so and not otherwise.
He then points out that there can be no reason why the universe is located where
it is in absolute space and not at some other place, say a meter to the right, since
there could be no reason for one location rather than the other. He takes this to be
a reductio ad absurdum of Newton’s account. Imagine a change of location for the
whole universe, which is sometimes called a “Leibniz shift.”
...if space were an absolute being, there would something happen for which it would be
impossible there should be a suﬃcient reason. Which is against my axiom. And I prove it
thus. Space [according to Newton] is something absolutely uniform; and without the things
placed in it, one point of space does not absolutely diﬀer in any respect whatsoever from
another point of space. Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself,
besides the order of bodies among themselves,) that ’tis impossible there should be a reason,
why God, preserving the same situations among bodies among themselves, should have
placed them in space after one certain particular manner, and not otherwise; why every thing
was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing East into West. (Leibniz-
Clarke Correspondence, III-5, p. 26)
The two universes would be completely symmetrical. There could be no reason
to favour the creation of one over the other, so God would have no reason to choose.
But God only acts for a reason and the universe does exist, so Newton’s claim can’t
be a correct account of how things are. The existence of absolute space leads to
this absurdity. Note that this argument can be run considering absolute location (no
diﬀerence between being located here or there) or considering absolute velocity (no
diﬀerence between moving west with a velocity v or 2v, 3v, etc.) Whether this sort
of argument also works for accelerations is questionable. Leibniz, unfortunately, did
not address this case in any detail before he died.
The problem with Newton’s absolute space, as Leibniz sees it, is easily solved, if
we simply hold that the only thing that exists (and the only thing that matters) is the
set of relations among the bodies.
But if space is nothing else, but that order of relation; and is nothing at all without bodies,
but the possibility of placing them; then those two states, the one such as it now is, the
other supposed to be the quite contrary way, would not at all diﬀer from one another. Their
diﬀerence therefore is only to be found in our chimerical supposition of the reality of space in
itself. But in truth the one would exactly be the same thing as the other, they being absolutely
indiscernible... (Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, III-5.)
Leibniz’s Principle of Suﬃcient Reason may seem inappropriate since it’s based
on religious considerations, which today should play no role in these matters. It could
readily be recast, it should be noted, in the form of a symmetry principle, devoid of
any religious overtones.

J.R. Brown
Like Leibniz, Ernst Mach (1838–1916) is a relationalist, but he comes at it a
diﬀerent way. He holds that all legitimate concepts are acquired empirically and
demands that scientists stick to the “actual facts,” by which he means the facts of
observable experience. Newton’s absolute time, for example, is independent of all
change, so Mach is completely dismissive. “This absolute time can be measured with
no motion; it has therefore neither a practical nor a scientiﬁc value; and no one is jus-
tiﬁed in saying that he knows aught about it. It is an idle metaphysical conception.”
(Mach, The Science of Mechanics, 273).
As for absolute space, it is both philosophically illegitimate and quite unneces-
sary for science: “No one is competent to predicate things about absolute space and
absolute motion; they are pure things of thought, pure mental constructs, that can-
not be produced in experience. All our principles of mechanics are... experimental
knowledge concerning the relative positions and motions of bodies.” (Mach, The
Science of Mechanics, 280) Mach claims that all observable motion is relative. This
is the only type of motion that is comprehensible, and hence, the only type that is
legitimate in science.
Before Mach’s attack on Newton’s absolute space and time, the empiricist George
Berkeley (1685–1753) formulated a similar view. I include mention of Berkeley here,
since his historical importance in these matters is under appreciated.
...it is clear that we ought not to deﬁne the true place of the body as the part of absolute space
which the body occupies, and true or absolute motion as the change of true or absolute place;
for all place is relative just as all motion is relative. But to make this appear more clearly we
must point out that no motion can be understood unless besides the body in motion our own
body also, or some other body, be understood to exist at the same time. For up, down, left,
and right and all places and regions are founded in some relation, and necessarily connote
and suppose a body diﬀerent from the body moved. (Berkeley, “De Motu” §58.)
In replying to Newton’s bucket argument, Mach formulated what is now known
as “Mach’s Principle.” One version of this asserts that only relative rotations are
relevant in accounting for this type of phenomena. The bucket rotating with respect
to the “ﬁxed stars” is equivalent to the ﬁxed stars rotating with respect to the bucket.
His view comes out in the following long passage.
...if we take our stand on the basis of facts, we shall ﬁnd we have knowledge only of
relative spaces and motions. Relatively, not considering the unknown and neglected medium
of space, the motions of the universe are the same whether we adopt the Ptolemaic or the
Copernican mode of view. Both views are, indeed, equally correct; only the latter is more
simple and more practical. The universe is not twice given, with an earth at rest and an earth
in motion; but only once with its relative motions, alone determinable. It is, accordingly, not
permitted us to say how things would be if the earth did not rotate. We may interpret the one
case that is given us, in diﬀerent ways....
Newton’s experiment with the rotating vessel of water simply informs us, that the rel-
ative rotation of the water with respect to the sides of the vessel produces no noticeable
centrifugal forces, but that such forces are produced by its relative rotation with respect to
the mass of the earth and the other celestial bodies. No one is competent to say how the
experiment would turn out if the sides of the vessel increased in thickness and mass till they
were ultimately several leagues thick. (Mach, The Science of Mechanics, 283f.)

6
Why Spacetime Has a Life of its Own
81
Back to Berkeley for a moment. In summing up his view, he remarks that we
ought to “...consider motion as something sensible, or at least imaginable; and to be
content with relative measures. If we do so, all the famous theorems of the mechani-
cal philosophy by which the secrets of nature are unlocked, and by which the system
of the world is reduced to human calculation, will remain untouched...” (Berkeley,
“De Motu,” §66.)
In short, we can have all the glories of Newton’s physics without absolute space.
Everything we want and need in physics is available to us, according to both Berkeley
and Mach, without (as they see it) the metaphysically murky medium of absolute
space and time in which objects exist and events happen. But is this true?
Albert Einstein (1879–1955) certainly thought we could do physics without it. In
the opening pages of his paper on General Relativity (1916) he clearly endorses the
Berkeley-Mach point of view. He begins with the remark that in classical mechanics
there is an “epistemological defect...pointed out by Ernst Mach.” (Einstein, “The
Foundation of the General Principle of Relativity,” Einstein, et. al., The Principle
of Relativity, 1916, p. 112) Einstein then describes a thought experiment with two
globes that are in observable rotation with respect to one another. One is a sphere,
the other an ellipsoid of revolution (Fig. 6.2).
Einstein asks, “What is the reason for the diﬀerence in the two bodies?” He then
sets empiricist—indeed, veriﬁcationist—conditions on any acceptable answer. His
empiricism and veriﬁcationism leads directly to Mach’s principle and the principle
of general covariance.
No answer can be admitted as epistemologically satisfactory, unless the reason given is an
observable fact of experience. The law of causality has not the signiﬁcance of a statement
as to the world of experience, except when observable facts ultimately appear as causes and
eﬀects.
Einstein then declares that classical physics is not up to proper epistemological
standards. That is, it does not comply with a strict Machine empiricism.

Newtonian mechanics does not give a satisfactory answer to this question. It pronounces
as follows:—The laws of mechanics apply to the space R1, in respect to which the body
S1 is at rest, but not to the space R2, in respect to which the body S2 is at rest. But the
privileged space R1 of Galileo, thus introduced, is a merely factitious cause, and not a thing
that can be observed. It is therefore clear that Newton’s mechanics does not really satisfy the
requirement of causality in the case under consideration, but only apparently does so, since
it makes the factitious cause R1 responsible for the observable diﬀerence in the bodies S1
and S2.
By “the privileged space R1 of Galileo,” Einstein means an inertial frame, which
plays a central role in Newtonian physics and in special relativity. But he no longer
considers it satisfactory. Einstein then goes on to say how things should be properly
viewed, introducing both Mach’s principle and the principle of general co-variance.
The only satisfactory answer must be that the physical system consisting of S1 and S2 reveals
within itself no imaginable cause to which the diﬀering behaviour of S1 and S2 can be
referred. The cause must therefore lie outside this system. We have to take it that the general
laws of motion, which in particular determine the shapes of S1 and S2, must be such that
the mechanical behaviour of S1 and S2 is partly conditioned, in quite essential respects, by
distant masses which we have not included in the system under consideration. These distant
masses and their motions relative to S1 and S2 must then be regarded as the seat of the causes
(which must be susceptible to observation) of the diﬀerent behaviour of our two bodies S1
and S2. They take over the role of the factitious cause R1. Of all imaginable spaces R1, R2,
etc., in any kind of motion relatively to one another, there is none which we may look upon
as privileged a priori without reviving the above-mentioned epistemological objection. The
laws of physics must be of such a nature that they apply to systems of reference in any kind
of motion. (Einstein, ibid., 112f. Einstein’s italics throughout.)
In spite of Einstein’s authority, the later years of the 20th century saw a shift
to Newton’s outlook. Not in all aspects, but substantivalism became the dominant
outlook. A strong consideration in favour of substantivalism stems from inertia. It
is related to Newton’s bucket argument in that acceleration and inertial motion are
the key to absolute space. It is general enough to apply to general relativity (GR) as
well. The argument, (here adapted from [1]), runs something like this:
1. Current physical theories employ the notion of inertia, which is of central impor-
tance to them. Thus, both classical mechanics and GR have as a fundamental
principle that bodies move inertially unless acted upon by a force.
2. Inertial motion involves the idea of a straight line (or geodesic). Of course,
“straight line” may have diﬀerent properties in Euclidean and in non- Euclid-
ean geometry. But in any case, the notion of a straight line is needed by various
contemporary theories, including both Newton’s and Einstein’s. Similarly, the
notion of a curved trajectory, one that deviates from straightness or from being a
geodesic, is needed for cases when a force is present.
3. To say there are straight lines or geodesics or that there is an inertial structure, is
to say some thing has these properties. This thing is obviously spacetime itself.
4. Thus, spacetime exists and is represented well in GR by a pseudo-Riemannian
manifold.

6
Why Spacetime Has a Life of its Own
83
Substantivalism asserts the independent existence of this manifold. Arguments
such as the one just sketched carried the day for quite a while, but they were dealt a
body blow by the hole argument [2], which I will now sketch.
Assume that we have a model (M, g𝜇𝜈, T𝜇𝜈), that is, a solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations. Then a new solution can be generated by performing an active diﬀeomor-
phism to generate the solution (M, g′
𝜇𝜈, T′
𝜇𝜈). For a point p in M, it is not the case
that that g𝜇𝜈(p) = g′
𝜇𝜈(p). This is another model of the universe that is empirically
indistinguishable from the original. And yet they are objectively diﬀerent, according
to many substantivalists.
Now imagine a region of spacetime, the hole, that is part of the whole universe.
Next imagine a material object—an atom or a galaxy, it doesn’t matter—moving
through the hole. This will happen in our ﬁrst model, (M, g𝜇𝜈, T𝜇𝜈). The second model
is just like the ﬁrst outside the hole, but inside it is (M, g′
𝜇𝜈, T′
𝜇𝜈). There are two
distinct trajectories through the hole. Which one did the galaxy follow? There is no
empirical test. It gets worse. GR is taken to be a deterministic theory, but it won’t be
if we adopt a substantivalist outlook. Determinism is characterized as follows: Two
models governed by the same laws and having the same initial conditions, will have
the same history. Otherwise the laws and the models are nondeterministic.
Our two models are governed by the same laws, GR, and have the same initial
conditions up to the hole, but they diverge after that. The trajectory through the hole
is not ﬁxed by the laws and initial conditions. According to Earman and Norton, the
price we pay for substantivalism is too high. We must embrace a ridiculous form
of indeterminism. So, they conclude, substantivalism must be abandoned. The two
models of the world, (M, g𝜇𝜈, T𝜇𝜈) and its diﬀeomorphic image (M, g′
𝜇𝜈, T′
𝜇𝜈), should
be taken to be physically the same world, with merely diﬀerent mathematical rep-
resentations. In other words, they uphold so-called Leibniz equivalence and reject
substantivalism.
There have been a number or responses to the hole argument. I will not attempt
to survey them but will mention one. Earman and Norton take the manifold M to be
the obvious counterpart to Newton’s absolute space. If substantivalism is true, then
M must exist in its own right and not be some system of relations. But what about
the metric tensor, g𝜇𝜈? Shouldn’t spacetime be the manifold and the metric tensor,
(M, g𝜇𝜈), not just M alone? After all, Newton’s absolute space included the standard
Euclidean metric, so why not include the metric in the updated GR version? This is
hugely important, since the hole argument will fail without a diﬀerent metric tensor
g′
𝜇𝜈. The diﬀeomorphic copies would be merely diﬀerent mathematical representa-
tions of the same physical situation. Earman and Norton insist on the bare manifold
M alone, arguing that the metric tensor is in an important sense more like a physical
entity, possessing physical properties that make it quite unlike the familiar distance
function of Euclidean space.
They are quite right, the metric is a very diﬀerent thing in the space and time of
Newtonian from what it is in the spacetime of GR. The debate has changed, though
there is still considerable overlap with the pre-GR debates.

84
J.R. Brown
It is important to be completely clear on what is meant by substantivalism, espe-
cially after the hole argument. It was described when discussing the history of the
problem, but now I need to provide more detail, beginning with the common term
“absolutism.” Absolutism about space could in principle include any or all of the
following ingredients, some of which have been overturned by GR.
∙Metric: Distance is independent of the amount and distribution of matter. (Over-
turned by GR; the presence of mass-energy aﬀects distance.)
∙Geometry: Space is Euclidean or some sort of non-Euclidean, but whatever geom-
etry it has is independent of matter. (Overturned by GR; the presence of mass-
energy aﬀects curvature.)
∙Dimension: The number of dimensions of spacetime (four) is independent of mat-
ter. (Possibly correct; it seems independent of mass-energy distribution.)
∙Topology: The universe could be like a four-dimensional sphere, or like a four-
dimensional doughnut, etc., but whatever it is, it is independent of matter. (Possibly
correct; it seems independent of mass-energy distribution.)
∙Substance: Space (or spacetime) is a substance, a thing in its own right. The other
items in this list, metric, geometry, and so on are properties of this substance,
space. These spatial properties might arise due to the amount and distribution of
matter (mass-energy), but space (spacetime) itself has a life of its own, indepen-
dent from everything else.
We are here concerned only with the last listed sense of absolute: Spacetime is
a substance. Is this true? The argument above based on considerations of inertial
structure says yes. The hole argument says no. We seem to be at a standoﬀ. I am
now going to turn to a new consideration, the idea of metric expansion, to see what
answer it might suggest.
It is a generic feature of current cosmological models that the universe we inhabit
is expanding. This is clear already in the traditional FLRW (Friedman-Lemaître-
Robertson-Walker) models of GR. Nowadays it is also commonly believed that at
the very early stages of the universe an even more extreme expansion occurred,
known as cosmic inﬂation [3]. According to cosmic inﬂation, the very early universe
expanded with extraordinary speed. A region around the Planck-scale expanded to
something macro-sized. In a mere 10−36 to 10−32 s the universe grew by a factor of
about 1026. Cosmic inﬂation may be the most dramatic example of the general phe-
nomenon known as metric expansion. Inﬂation is rejected by some critics, but the
more general phenomenon of cosmic expansion is widely accepted; this is the ongo-
ing expansion of the universe. Not only is the universe expanding, but it is expanding
at an accelerating rate. Note that this is the expansion of space, not spacetime.
Since metric expansion is a signiﬁcant feature of GR, associated with dark energy
as well as cosmic inﬂation of the very early universe and even so-called eternal inﬂa-
tion, questions of its consequence for long-standing philosophical issues should be
of interest to everyone.
If we take the claim literally that “space itself is expanding,” then it suggests
that space is a thing in its own right. Physicists speaking in a popular context oﬀer
remarks such as these:

6
Why Spacetime Has a Life of its Own
85
Brian Greene: What Einstein actually theorized is that no object can move through space
faster than the speed of light. But nothing in his ideas prevents objects from riding the swell
of space itself, and in that way, moving apart faster than the speed of light.
Leonard Susskind: If the entirety of space is being swept away from you like the tide going
out, then ripples on space very, very far away from you can appear to be going faster than
the speed of light because all of space is being swept along with the tide. (Both quoted in a
radio broadcast, [4].)
Of course, these are remarks in a popular context; as such they can be no more
than suggestive. But what they do suggest is that: metric expansion implies substan-
tivalism. That is, expanding space must be a substance, an entity in its own right.
The reason is that two particles that are close at some time early in expansion might
turn out to be far apart at a later time, and the time it took to separate them was such
that the speed of separation is much greater than the speed of light. An observer at
particle a watches particle b receded faster and faster until it ﬁnally disappears. The
disappearance is not because the light is too dim, but because the light cones of a
and b will not overlap in the future.
How is this possible, given the correctness of GR with its limiting speed c? The
standard reply is simple: The particles are not moving apart in space; rather it is
space itself that is expanding, so there is no conﬂict with relativity. Once we have
accepted this claim, the conclusion seems inevitable: Space exists independent from
matter.
It should be stressed that not everything expands along with space. There is a
popular pedagogical model of the big bang expanding universe in which we start
with a deﬂated balloon, use a marker to draw ﬁgures of various sizes and shapes on
it. As the balloon is inﬂated, the ﬁgures on it grow at the same rate as the ballon
expands. This is the wrong model of metric expansion. A better model to capture
metric expansion is to glue small objects, say coins, onto the balloon. Now blow it
up. The balloon grows, but the coins remain the same size ([5] suggest this analogy).
This is what happens with metric expansion; space expands, but not the objects in
space. The internal forces holding the objects together are more important than the
expansion of spacetime. Local physics is unaﬀected by expansion. Even for rather
large cosmological structures such as galaxies the gravitational forces holding them
together are more important than the expansion. Hence, structures as large as galax-
ies can maintain their size despite cosmic expansion.1
The argument to follow is adapted from Earman’s argument above. His case for
substantivalism is based on considerations of inertia. The case for a similar substan-
tivalist conclusion is based on metric expansion.
1. Current cosmology employs the notion of metric expansion. This notion is of cen-
tral importance in explaining various features of the observable universe within
the framework of GR (e.g., inﬂation, dark energy).
2. Metric expansion involves the idea of the universe changing size without material
objects themselves changing size. That is, the universe could double while an
atom or a galaxy remains the same size.
1At least, this is the standard view, but it is controversial. See [6] for a brief survey of rival views.

3. If the universe expands but there is no material object expanding and there is no
rearrangement of material objects relative to one another, then something non-
material expands. This something is obviously space.
4. Thus, space exists as an entity in its own right. It is not a system of relations
among material objects, nor is it a mere mathematical representation or some
sort of useful ﬁction. In short, substantivalism is correct.
This is a new argument for substantivalism. It is not based on metaphysical princi-
ples but rather on detailed aspects of prevailing physics. Current cosmological think-
ing is carried out in the framework of GR, which includes metric expansion as an
essential part. This is currently our best bet at how things are. If the universe were
diﬀerent, then the augment could fail.
I should perhaps soften this argument to a disjunction: You can take it as an argu-
ment for substantivalism OR you can take it as a new challenge for relationalists to
overcome. I’m betting on substantivalism. Space is a thing in its own right; it has a
life of its own.

The Phenomenology of Space and Time:
Husserl, Sartre, Derrida
Hans Herlof Grelland
The notions of space and time have been a subject of philosophical discussion since
antiquity. In modern philosophy, Newton’s concepts of absolute space and absolute
time was subject to criticism by empiricists like Berkeley and Hume, who prepared the
ground for Einstein and the ideas behind his theories of relativity. Simultaneously with
Einstein’s revolutionary works in physics, the development of new philosophical
methods by Edmund Husserl and others under the heading of phenomenology opened
for renewed investigations of a broad range of scientiﬁc ideas, among them the con-
cepts of space and time. The phenomenology of space and time is the subject of this
article. I will emphasize that the concept of space to be discussed is the concept of
empty space. Empty space is what people traditionally have thought that spatial bodies
are “in”, and which shows itself where there are no such bodies “ﬁlling” the space. One
of the themes of this article is how to deﬁne a corresponding concept of “empty” time
to obtain a symmetric description of space and time.
One of the lesser known but original phenomenological studies of space is found in
Jean-Paul Sartre’s monumental work, Being and Nothingness (BN) from 1943 [6].
Sartre does not discuss the notion of space extensively, but he brings in some novel and
clarifying ideas, in particular by associating space with the phenomenological concept
of absence or nothingness (néant). In the ﬁrst part of this article I will give a presen-
tation of Sartre’s contribution to the phenomenology of space.
I will then consider the notion of time. Sartre’s treatments of space and time are
quite different. However, to see space and time together is important. When Her-
mann Minkowski suggested the uniﬁed concept of space-time in his famous 1908
paper [4], he made the prediction that “space by itself, and time by itself, are
doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union between the two
will preserve an independent reality” (p. 75). Now, the concept of space-time is
formulated in a mathematical language, and is often considered as an abstract

formalism far removed from our immediate experience of the world. But taken at
face value, Minkowski’s statement implies something more. If only space and time
in combination is to be preserved as independent realities, the ontology and space
and time must be closely related. I will outline how Sartre’s analysis of space can be
transferred to that of time, thus showing the symmetry of space and time and laying
a phenomenological foundation for the notion of space-time.
Then I will compare Sartre’s notion of space to Einstein’s. In The Meaning of
Relativity (MR) [2] Einstein redeﬁnes the concepts of space and time in a way
appropriate for the theories of relativity. He starts with our experience of space in a
way that can be seen as a simple phenomenological analysis, and I will show how a
close reading of Einstein’s text reveals a fundamental similarity to Sartre’s ideas.
When we consider phenomenological description and abstract geometry, one
may question how these combine. For instance, does a geometrical description,
with its idealized concepts, imply an abstraction leading to a loss of meaning
compared to the concrete experience of real bodies in space? Or does the mathe-
matical language reveal some additional meaning which cannot be seen in the
immediate experience, such that we are lead to understand the world better? This
worried Husserl and it was the subject of many of his late works, among them the
article The Origin of Geometry, written in 1936 and published posthumously in
1939. When Jacques Derrida translated this article into French in 1962, he wrote a
introduction which was almost six times longer than the original article, in which he
through a critical reading of Husserl’s text developed his own ideas on mathe-
matics, language, ideality and meaning. In the last part of this article I will give an
outline of this one-way discussion between Husserl and Derrida. I will show how
Sartre’s study provides an illuminating case for this discussion.
Sartre’s treatment of space is found in various places in BN, and none of the
passages are very long. The notions presented are integrated as a part of a com-
prehensive ontological system. A terse statement of the essential idea can be found
on p. 491: “… geometrical space … is a pure nothingness”. To understand this, we
need a brief explanation of Sartre’s notion of nothingness. This is one of the most
important concepts on BN, as seen from its title, and Sartre’s use of the concept
represents one of his novel contributions to phenomenology. BN is, according to its
subtitle, a phenomenological ontology, in which the concept of nothingness plays
an important role.
The core of phenomenology is the idea of intentionality. To be a conscious mind
is always to be conscious of something, to see is to see something, to think is to
think about something, to imagine is to imagine something, to know is to know
something, to understand is to understand something, etc. This “directedness” is
called Intentionality and is, according to phenomenology, the deﬁning property of
consciousness. To see, think, imagine, etc., are called intentional acts. In an
intentional act, we are aware of something, and this something, the object of our
awareness, is called the intentional object. Among intentional acts, the act of
intuition will be particularly important. Intuition in phenomenology is a translation
of German Anschauung, meaning sense perception. To be an intentional object is to
appear to consciousness in some way. It can be something that we see, something
88
H.H. Grelland

that we think about, something that we imagine, etc. This is the way we relate to the
world and the world available for our knowledge and understanding is a world of
intentional objects. It is important to notice that intentional acts also include indirect
observations, abstractions, and symbolic representations, but somehow even our
most abstract theories of the world must be rooted in our experience of the world as
appearance.
Now, Sartre points out that we do not only see what is there, but also what is not
there, for instance because we expected to see something which for some reason
does not appear. The absence which we in this way “see” is for Sartre an example of
a general concept of nothingness. Very often the word nothingness in Sartre can be
replaced by the word absence. It can be a concrete thing (I believed I had put my
keys on the table, but when I look for it I only see no-keys, their absence) or a
person (I had an appointment with Pierre in the café, but when I look for him, I see
only no-Pierre, Pierre’s absence), or a state of affairs (I believed that the sum of the
angels of a triangle was 120°, but found out that it is not the case, that
“sum-equals-120” is not an existing fact, it is absent from all reality). Nothingness
is also a condition for logical negation. When I say that it is not the case that the
Pierre is in the café, it is a statement of Pierre’s absence, and hence of nothingness.
Nothingness is also a condition for the constitution of objects, which appear in
analogy with a paper cut, where what is not the ﬁgure is cut away, and the ﬁgure
itself stands out against this nothingness. This brief sketch should indicate the wide
range of situations where nothingness appears as an element of an intentional act.
Sartre points out that nothingness is both subjective and objective. It is objectively
true that Pierre is not in the café, but his absence “is there” because I, the subject,
am looking for him. Thus, nothingness is a phenomenological concept, it concerns
how the world appears, it is more than just logical negation, for which it is a
precondition. And such is Sartre’s phenomenological concept of space, that it is
pure nothingness, pure absence, in this case absence of things, of bodies.
The concept of space as nothingness is mainly elaborated in BN on p. 20. This
passage is a part of a section describing the kinds of being that includes non-being
as a part of their way of being. Possible examples would be an empty box, where
the empty space within is an essential part of making it a box, or, again, a paper cut
where what is the ﬁgure is there only on the background of what is not there
because it is cut away. In this context, space is introduced. Sartre considers space as
derived from the notion of a spatial distance, exempliﬁed by two points at a dis-
tance. He describes how this situation can be an intentional object in two ways, or,
more precisely, how it can be two different intentional objects or appearances.
There is one in which the distance itself is made into an intentional object, in the
form of being thought of as a line segment connecting the two points and having a
certain length. The other intentional object consists of the two points, where the
distance is just an absence because the two points are not connected. The last
alternative is the intention which gives us the notion of empty space as nothingness.
You cannot see, think of, or imagine both these intentional objects at the same time,
to see one dissolves the other, according to Sartre. The concept of a distance as
absence is an fragment of a full concept of space as a combination of all distances of
7

all spatial objects in a given situation. This means that, properly speaking, one
cannot say that something is “in” space like a ﬁsh is in the water or the wine is in
the bottle. Space is not a being of its own which something can be “in”, but refers to
a relation between the spatial objects.
Now we turn to the question of time. When Hermann Minkowski suggested the
uniﬁed concept of space-time, one was faced with the question: How can the
separate concepts of time and space, each being deeply rooted in our ordinary
experience of the world, possibly “fade away”, to be replaced by space-time, which
is usually regarded as a pure mathematical abstraction? To solve this problem, we
would need a phenomenology of time displaying the symmetry between time and
space. In BN, time is treated quite differently from space. In his treatment of time,
Sartre focuses on the experienced temporality of the subject. The question is if it is
possible to see time as something analogous to space as nothingness. This is what
we will try.
First, we remind ourselves that when considering space, we were talking about
empty space. Empty space is that which shows itself in the nothingness of a
distance. And it is also the notion of empty space which lies behind the traditional
(and Newtonian) notion of a pre-existing space which spatial bodies are “in”. The
space as nothingness in Sartre is also an interpretation of empty space, a different
one from the absolute space of Newton. So, we are looking for a corresponding
concept of “empty” or pure time, not for the concept of the temporality of a process.
This is a precondition for interpreting time as nothingness on par with space.
A distance, as Sartre describes it, is between two points in space. If we take a
step further, we can say that a point in space is a projection into space of a
space-time event. In physics, an event is not something with a content taken place at
a moment in time and at place, it is just the moment and the place as such, but seen
together, disregarding what actually might be happening there and then. In Min-
kowskis formulation of the special theory of relativity, the event is the primary
thing, its division into a time and a space component depends on a frame of
reference. In a phenomenological perspective, the frame of reference is given by the
consciousness for which the described phenomena appear. So we can take a
space-time split as given. As the two points p and q at a distance are the space
projections of two events u = (p, t) and v = (q, s), the two moments s and t are at a
distance in time. And as the distance in space creates space, so the distance in time
creates time, in the meaning of “empty time” or “pure time”, time as such. Pauses,
breaks, intervals of silence, are examples of such pure time, pure nothingness in
time in analogy with the pure nothingness of space between points at a distance.
An apparent problem could be that while to a consciousness two points at a
distance can be experienced in one single experience, two moments do not happen
simultaneously. Thus one would think that the two moments belong to two different
intuitions. Here we need to bring in Husserl’s study of time consciousness ([5],
pp. 127–143). Husserl observes that our experience of temporal objects is not
limited to the factual “now”. His favorite example is a melody. We do not only hear
one tone, and then another tone, the tones just passed is retained in consciousness in
such a way that we actually hear a melody, not only single tones. Gradually the
90
H.H. Grelland

retained tones fade away and disappear from consciousness, but because of the
retention we actually experience also time intervals, like we experience space
intervals. Thus a “Sartrean” phenomenology of time becomes possible, and together
with the phenomenology of space it represents an experiential foundation for the
concept of space-time.
It is interesting to compare Sartre’s concept of space to Einstein’s, which is
expressed in The Meaning of Relativity (MR). This book introduces space-time step
by step, going from the immediate experienced space and time to the mathemati-
cally formulated theories of relativity. Einstein makes a point in going back to the
immediate experience to get free from the heritage of Newtonian mechanics with its
concepts of “absolute space” and “absolute time” given independently of obser-
vation. It is easy to discover the inﬂuence of Hume and Mach in Einstein’s text, but
we have no real indication that Einstein was familiar with Husserl’s philosophy. He
could have been: He was a friend of the mathematician Hermann Weyl, who knew
Husserl and his philosophy very well. Weyl was in Göttingen at the same time as
Husserl, went to some of his lectures and married one of his students. Later Weyl
became a professor in Zürich while Einstein still was there. Moreover, Weyl taught
Einstein’s theory of general relativity in Zürich and published in 1918 the ﬁrst
textbook on this subject, Space Time Matter [7]. This book begins with a presen-
tation of Husserl’s phenomenology, which is used as a philosophical introduction to
the concepts of space and time. It is highly probable that Einstein read the book, but
although MR is based on a general phenomenological perspective, we do not ﬁnd
any speciﬁc phenomenological concepts in the book.
While Sartre starts derives the notion of space from the distance between points,
Einstein starts with the distance between three-dimensional bodies. Thus, like
Sartre, Einstein develops the concept of space from the concept of a distance.
Where there is a distance between two bodies, there is space. To explain the concept
of a distance, Einstein follows an elaborate procedure, beginning with the concepts
of replacement (change of position) of a body and of what he calls a continuation. If
we have given two three-dimensional bodies, we can think of one being moved
relative to another. We can for instance bring one body up to another so that they
are touching each other. By bringing other bodies up to a body A, A is said to be
continued, i.e. extended. If we have another body, X, we can imagine A to be
continued until it is in contact with X, i.e. such that there is no longer a distance
between X and A. Such a continuation of A is something that is imagined, which
has not taken place, but which we assume could be done. Thus, in the terminology
of Sartre (which Einstein, of course, does not use), a continuation is nothingness.
Now, Einstein deﬁnes the space of A as all imaginable (not realized) continuations
of A. Thus, space is in fact an absence, precisely the absence of the continuations of
A. Thus, we see that Einstein’s notion is basically the same as Sartre’s, although
expressed in a slightly different way.
How would space appear to us in ordinary life, in my immediate visual expe-
rience, according to Einstein? Einstein’s suggestion is, as we have seen, that space
is nothing but the lack or absence of a physical body somewhere. Where there is
space, there could have been a body, but it isn’t. As bodies may have shapes and
7

91

dimensions, pieces of space can be said to have the same, inherited from the absent
body which would remove the space by its presence. We say that the body would
replace the (empty) space. If we have a piece of space in front of us, and this piece
of space could be replaced with a cube of length 20 cm in all three directions, then
the space can be said to be cubic with the length 20 cm in the same directions.
Einstein imagines this as taking place in relation to a given body (the body of
reference) which we can imagine being extended, and which deﬁnes space (a piece
of space) as the absence of this extension. Thus, he thinks that this concept of space
always assumes that some body is originally given, to which the space, the absence,
is deﬁned. In ordinary life, he thinks that the earth functions as such a body of
reference, which we are so used to that we never think about it. That is why we
think of space as something that exists by itself, the everyday notion of absolute
space.
Given the Sartre-Einstein phenomenological notion of space as absence or
nothingness, we can now turn to the question of the meaning of the mathematical
concepts of geometry in relation to the phenomenological description of space.
Usually the introduction of the mathematics is considered as adding a “formalism”
representing a new level of abstraction which removes us from the world of
physical meaning, that is, the world appearing in intuition. This point of view is
roughly what we will call intuitionism. It is highly misleading, and misses some
interesting philosophical insights. The main objection to intuitionism is that “ab-
straction” is already implied in any given experience, and what mathematics does is
rather to provide us with a language for unifying an otherwise fragmentary relation
to the intentional object in question. A language displays what Wittgenstein called
the logical structure of the phenomenon, which leads to better understanding, and
hence—in fact—more meaning. And mathematics is nothing but a particularly
sophisticated language.
This was the subject of the historical discussion between Edmund Husserl and
Jacques Derrida taking place in the latter’s translation of The Origin of Geometry
(OG) into French. Derrida wrote an introduction [1] to his translation which was
almost six times longer than Husserl’s original article, and Derrida’s criticism or
“deconstruction” of Husserl’s text and its philosophical assumptions is of profound
interest for understanding what we do when we use mathematics in modern physics,
including in the geometry of space, time and space-time. Husserl was concerned
and worried about the development of science since Galileo into higher and higher
degrees of abstraction and mathematisation. He thought that it was the immediate
experiences and practical applications from which the scientiﬁc theory originated
that gave a theory its fullness of meaning, and that the high degree of abstraction
and the extensive mathematisation of science lead to a gradual loss of meaning. For
Husserl, the development of geometry from a practical tool for design and building
into a purely abstract mathematical science of ideal entities is an example of such a
development. Husserl was not making an empirical historical investigation, what he
presented was rather a reconstruction of what must have been the main steps in this
development.

H.H. Grelland

In his long and detailed introduction to Husserl’s article [1], Derrida pays
attention to the ﬁne points in Husserl’s text, pointing out the unresolved tension
between admitting the necessity of the ideal, as we ﬁnd it in the concepts of a
language, and at the same time criticizing the alienation and degradation following
from the idealization of mathematics in geometry. Derrida points out that what
Husserl says about the ideal concepts of geometry, is true of language in general.
To Husserl, geometry is both a means of expressing timeless truths and an
abstraction hiding “sedimented” and forgotten layers of historical meaning. Thus,
for Husserl, the establishment of ideality trough mathematical concepts and
mathematical notation leads to forgetfulness of the meaning-giving origin in intu-
ition. And at the same time this process is necessary for establishing the timeless
validity of the mathematical theorems. Derrida ﬁnds in Husserl’s text also state-
ments to the effect that language in itself works in a similar fashion as mathematics.
But the ideality of language is liberating meaning just as much as hiding or for-
getting it. To Husserl, writing, notation, and hence language, is a system for rep-
resenting
a
meaning
originating
in
the
immediate
intuition,
or,
for
the
“pre-geometer”, in his practical dealing with speciﬁc spatial problems. In Derrida’s
view, in any knowledge and understanding there are already implied concepts
which are ideal entities established through the sign system of a language. All
concepts are ideal in the sense of being repeatable and recognizable, which is in fact
a condition for being applicable as language. Only through ideal concepts an
experience makes sense, can be understood, repeated in memory and communicated
to others. Thus, the immediacy of intuition imagined by Husserl as being the sole
source of meaning of the ideal concepts is in itself an illusion. Derrida calls it the
myth of the presence. There is no such thing as an immediate presence, untainted by
language and thus ideality. The forgetfulness implied by developing geometry from
a set of practical applications to an abstract theory is an unavoidable part of lan-
guage in general and is not a particular problem for the mathematical concepts of
geometry or other abstract sciences. It is just one side of the process which also
leads to the establishment of meaning through idealization.
The points and straight lines of geometry are ideal entities, and Derrida’s point is
that so are the concepts of language. Any potential loss of meaning following from
introducing such geometrical objects into a world of immediate experiences is
similar to the potential loss of meaning in any language use.
The position that the meaning of language as well as mathematical ideas has its
source an original intuition is called by Derrida intuitionism. Later writers,
including myself, have argued that is possible to distinguish Husserl’s intuitionism
from phenomenology (see e.g. [3]).
We can use Sartre’s analysis of space as an example. As mentioned above, Sartre
considers the situation of having two points at a distance. He identiﬁes two possible
intentional objects which can be associated with this situation. One corresponds to
space as nothingness, in which the end points are the foreground objects being at a
distance. This being-at-a-distance is a lack or absence of material fullness, and this
absence is space. The second intentional object is the distance itself as a line
7

segment connecting the points, and the points are background objects being the end
points of the line segment.
Here we observe that here is no original unmediated presence to relate to which
represents the immediate intuition in Husserl’s sense. In Husserl’s own wording,
the situation as it appears is always constituted, and in this case constituted in one of
two possible ways. It is one of Derrida’s points that there is an opposition between
Husserl’s theory of constitution and his theory of the original unmediated presence
appearing in intuition. This is Derrida’s method “deconstruction”, to reveal the
inner tension in the theory under consideration instead of criticizing from the
outside. In this case the tension between Husserl’s theory of constitution and his
theory of presence.
The two intentional objects outlined above, corresponding to two different acts
of constitution, are relevant here, because the duality of description differentiates
between the notion of empty space, which induces anxiety of heights or open places
and the mathematical space, which is based on the notion of the line segment
between the points. Both descriptions are ideal descriptions, and the last one
includes a concept which is a part of the mathematics of geometry, namely a line
segment. Thus, we have here a simple example of a form of intentionality which
can be developed into something much more complex by applying an elaborate
mathematical structure instead of just a piece of a straight line.
The two ways of constituting the originally given situation are revealing. The
geometrical description of space will never explain the phenomena of spatial
anxieties, while the nothingness description cannot reveal the kind of structured
reality represented by the elaborate geometrical mathematics needed for physics.
We see that we can use a phenomenological analysis against Husserl; more pre-
cisely: against his intuitionism. This is necessary to rescue both the adequacy of
scientiﬁc knowledge in modern physics and the fundamental philosophical and
psychological insights of phenomenology.

Space, Time, and (How They) Matter
A Discussion of Some Metaphysical Insights
about the Nature of Space and Time Provided by
Our Best Fundamental Physical Theories
Valia Allori
Abstract This paper is a brief (and hopelessly incomplete) non-standard intro-
duction to the philosophy of space and time. It is an introduction because I plan to
give an overview of what I consider some of the main questions about space and
time: Is space a substance over and above matter? How many dimensions does it
have? Is space-time fundamental or emergent? Does time have a direction? Does
time even exist? Nonetheless, this introduction is not standard because I conclude
the discussion by presenting the material with an original spin, guided by a par-
ticular understanding of fundamental physical theories, the so-called primitive
ontology approach.
8.1
Introduction
Scientiﬁc realists believe that our best scientiﬁc theories could be used as reliable
guides to understand what the world is like. First, they tell us about the nature of
matter: for instance, matter can be made of particles, or two-dimensional strings, or
continuous ﬁelds. In addition, whatever matter fundamentally is, it seems there is
matter in space, which moves in time. The topic of this paper is what our best
physical theories tell us about the nature of space and time.
I will start in the next section with the traditional debate concerning the question
of whether space is itself a substance or not. Section 8.3 is focused instead on the
question of the dimensionality of space in light of string theory and quantum
mechanics. I will then continue in Sect. 8.4 explaining how quantum gravity may
suggest that space and time are not fundamental but emergent. In Sect. 8.5,
I discuss whether physical theories successfully suggest the passage of time is

illusory, and whether change does not exist. I conclude the discussion illustrating
how the primitive ontology approach to fundamental physical theory can shed some
new light on to the issues discussed.
8.2
Is Space a Substance?
Material things seems to be arranged in space, but is that true? There are two
positions: either there is space, and objects are arranged within it; or there is no
space over and above the spatial relations between the objects. The ﬁrst position,
known as substantivalism, was ﬁrst suggested by Newton and was heavily criticized
by Leibniz. According to Leibniz, there is no absolute ‘here’ or ‘there,’ ‘now’ or
‘then;’ rather there are just spatial and temporal relations between material objects.
This view is known as relationism: all motion is relative motion.
8.2.1
Arguments for Substantivalism
Newton’s suggestion is that space and time are absolute, immutable quantities
which provide the fundamental arena in which matter can exist and evolve. This
view has been developed in the framework of classical (or Newtonian) mechanics
but can also be generalized to other theories. Newton provided an argument, the
bucket argument, to show that only substantivalism is able to account for certain
observations. Consider a bucket of water hanged with a winded up rope. When the
rope is let go and the bucket starts to rotate, the water’s surface becomes concave.
Why? The substantivalist’s response is that it is accelerating with respect to
absolute space. Instead, on the relationist view there has to be a body with respect to
which the water will rotate, and the problem is that there is no such body: it cannot
be the bucket itself (the water and the bucket are at rest with one another at the end
when the water is concave, but also at the beginning when the water was not
concave; the water was in motion relative to the bucket in the intermediate state, yet
the water was not concave); it cannot be motion with respect of the walls of the
room (“put the walls on wheels and spin them around a bucket of water, and the
water will not go concave” [14]).
8.2.2
Arguments Against Substantivalism
Leibniz argued against substantivalism, suggesting that it is fundamentally prob-
lematic. Leibniz observes that a ‘shifted’ world, a world just like ours except that all
matter is shifted in another place in absolute space without any change in the
relations of one object to another, will count as a different world for the
96
V. Allori

substantivalist, even if the two worlds do not differ in their fundamental properties.
The same is true for a ‘boosted’ world, a world just like ours except that all matter is
drifting through space at uniform velocity. Leibniz concludes that this is absurd
because it violates either the principle of sufﬁcient reason or the principle of identity
of indiscernibles, namely that God had a reason to create the world exactly as it is,
and that indiscernible possibilities are identical.
One can easily resist these arguments denying such principles are true, but there
is a stronger argument against substantivalism based on symmetries that generalizes
to theories other than Newtonian mechanics, as we will see. Translations and
rotations are symmetry of shape: they are transformations that leave the shape of an
object the same. Similarly, it is argued that symmetries of a law are transformations
that preserve that law. In classical mechanics, shifts and boosts are symmetries: if
w1 is a classical world, then a world w2 shifted 5 feet to the left will also be
classical; likewise, a boosted world w3. By deﬁnition, F is an invariant feature of a
law if any two worlds related by a symmetry of the law agree on the values of F
[14]. In classical mechanics, only relative (as opposed to absolute) distances and
velocities are invariant: w1, w2 and w3 are governed by the same laws, regardless of
their absolute position and absolute velocity. This suggests that (all things being
equal) invariant features are the only ones we should think of as real: if F is not
preserved in symmetries, then there are systematic ways to alter its values and yet
preserve the law. Tus, they ‘do not make any difference’ in the law, they are
redundant or irrelevant [9, 37]. In addition (or alternatively), non-invariant features
are by deﬁnition undetectable, and thus we do not have any reason to believe they
exist [14]. In both cases, substantivalism is in trouble since according to her
absolute position and velocity are real, even if they are not invariant.
There is consensus among substantivalists that the symmetry argument against
absolute velocity is compelling. Thus they endorse Galilean substantivalism, in
which absolute acceleration is deﬁned without reference to absolute velocity. Like
in Newtonian substantivalism, bodies traveling in straight lines have no accelera-
tion, but differently from it, there is no fact of the matter about absolute velocities: a
vertical straight trajectory in space-time or a tilted one will not be different. A body
is accelerating only if it has a curved trajectory in space-time. The majority of
substantivalists think that the symmetry argument against absolute position instead
does not work. ‘Sophisticated’ substantivalists (see e.g. [12]) argue that they are not
committed to maintain that the shifted and the actual worlds are different, as
claimed by the relationists (see [14]).
The situation does not change much when we consider relativistic physics, in
which we move from space and time to space-time, combined into a unique
manifold. Therefore, space substantivalism arguably transforms into space-time (or
manifold) substantivalism, the doctrine that the manifold of events in space-time is
a substance. The basic idea of general relativity is that matter changes the geometry
of space-time, curving it. Therefore, a crucial element is the metric, which captures
all the geometric structure of space-time. The most famous (symmetry) argument
against substantivalism in this framework is the ‘hole’ argument [18, 44]. Since
there is no privileged coordinate system (the so-called general covariance of general
8
Space, Time, and (How They) Matter
97

relativity), we can ‘spread’ metric and matter in space-time in different ways
without changing invariant properties. For instance, we can have a ‘regular’
translation of matter and metric, or we could have a ‘hole’ transformation: smoothly
joined, we leave matter and metric unchanged outside the hole, and we spread them
differently inside. Since the two distributions agree on all invariant features (i.e. on
coordinate-independent properties such as the distance along spatial curves), they
arguably describe the same physical situation. The problem is that according to
manifold substantivalism they instead depict two distinct physical situations,
characterized by undetectable non-invariant properties.
The most popular response to the ‘hole’ argument is again sophisticated sub-
stantivalism: one can regard these distributions as representing the same physical
possibility (see [40]). Another response is ‘metric essentialism:’ contrarily to
manifold substantivalism, points in space-time possess their relations essentially.
That is, the metric is, so to speak, part of the container [27].
8.3
How Many Dimensions Does Space Have?
Another interesting question is what dimensions space (or space-time) has. In
Newtonian mechanics and relativity theory, matter is represented respectively by
three-dimensional entities evolving in time, or by four-dimensional ‘worms’ in
space-time so it seems obvious that space has three dimensions, and space-time
four. The situation changes in the framework of string theory and non-relativistic
quantum mechanics.
8.3.1
Quantum Mechanics and Wave Function Realism
Classical mechanics dominated physics until the 20th century, when quantum
mechanics and relativity were proposed as more successful alternatives. To get a
clear metaphysical picture of the world out of quantum mechanics is notoriously
difﬁcult and controversial. The problem is that if, as quantum mechanics states, the
complete description of any material object is provided by the so-called wave
function, and the wave function evolves in time according to the equation devel-
oped by Schrödinger, then objects may have contradictory properties, like ‘being
here’ and ‘being not here’ at the same time, which is extremely problematic.
Nonetheless, in the last century few better quantum theories have been developed,
most famously Bohmian mechanics [11], Everettian mechanics [19], and the GRW
theory [20]. Bohmian mechanics avoids the inconsistencies of ‘orthodox’ quantum
mechanics denying that the wave function provides the complete description,
Everettian mechanics that it’s problematic for objects to have contradictory prop-
erties as long as they are instantiated in different words, and the GRW theory denies
that the wave function evolves according to the Schrödinger equation.
98
V. Allori

8.3.2
An Argument for Wave Function Realism
Nevertheless, it is controversial what matter is made of. One possibility is ‘wave
function realism:’ the wave function represents matter in all the three theories
above, even if they differ by either adding something to the wave function (like
Bohmian or Everettian mechanics, which add particles and worlds), or modifying
its dynamics. This view is motivated by focusing on the dynamics [39]: since in
Newtonian mechanics the fundamental equation described the temporal evolution
of
three-dimensional
points,
then
matter
is
made
of
point-particles
in
three-dimensional space. Similarly, since the fundamental equation of quantum
theory, Schrödinger’s equation, describes the evolution of the wave function,
whatever object the wave function mathematically represents it is the fundamental
constituent of matter, and space is whatever space the wave function lives in [3, 26,
33]. This space, introduced in the classical framework, is called ‘conﬁguration
space:’ the space of the conﬁgurations of all the particles in the world (given that
matter is made of wave function, there are fundamentally particles, so the name
‘conﬁguration’ should not be taken literally). Thus, if there are N particles in the
universe (estimated to be 1080), the dimension of conﬁguration space is 3 N. If so,
contrarily to what our everyday experiences suggest, space is a very high dimen-
sional space.
8.3.3
Arguments Against Wave Function Realism
One problem for this view is that it cannot account for our experience of
three-dimensional objects [5, 30, 31]. One could argue that they exist ‘functionally’
rather than fundamentally [2]. The preliminary problem here is that there are inﬁ-
nitely many functions from conﬁguration space to three-dimensional space, and to
select a privileged one amounts to add an ontology, which the wave function realist
denies. Other proposals use symmetries [38], or grounding [39]. These approaches
are all work-in-progress, and the debate over which is more promising is still open.
In addition, wave function realism may not be viable in the framework of
quantum ﬁeld theories [32, 46]. A ﬁrst problem is that the deﬁnition of conﬁgu-
ration space requires that the number of particles does not change in time, contrarily
to what happens in quantum ﬁeld theories, in which particles are created and
annihilated. See most notably [34] for a strategy to address this problem.
Furthermore, some question the motivation for the approach: wave function
realism prescribes that the world is very different from what we perceive it to be.
Before accepting such a revisionary metaphysic, one should rule out the existence
of viable, less counterintuitive alternatives. Since they exist (see Sect. 8.6), it is
8
Space, Time, and (How They) Matter
99

difﬁcult to see the appeal of wave function realism [6, 31]. This is connected with
the so-called problem of empirical incoherence [30]. Loosely speaking, a theory is
supported by observations when it predicts that objects have certain features, and
these features are actually observed. Since our observations are all observations of
three-dimensional
objects
(pointer
pointing
in
certain
directions
in
three-
dimensional space), a theory should make predictions about them. Wave function
realism predicts instead that there are no three-dimensional object, so it cannot be
supported by observations. Wave function realists (see e.g. [35]) respond that they
do not deny three-dimensional object exists, rather they deny that they are funda-
mental, and accordingly they attempt to provide an account of how they emerge
from a deeper reality.
8.3.4
String Theory and Extra Dimensions
Quantum ﬁeld theory, the ﬁrst proposed extension of quantum mechanics in a
relativistic framework, is mathematically ill-deﬁned. In order to overcome such
difﬁculties, string theory, among other theories, has been proposed. In this theory,
matter is described by one-dimensional objects called strings. On distances larger
than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with properties
determined by the vibrational state of the string. Since one of them corresponds to
the graviton, a particle connected to gravity, string theory promises to be a uniﬁed
description of all the fundamental forces. There are several versions of string the-
ory, but for their mathematical consistency, they all require extra dimensions of
space-time: for instance, in ‘superstring’ theory space-time is ten-dimensional.
These extra dimensions are assumed to close up on themselves to form little circles,
so that they are not macroscopically observable, similarly to what happens when we
observe a garden hose from a distance and it appears to have only one dimension
instead of two (this is the so-called ‘compactiﬁcation’). So, just like in the quantum
framework the dimensionality of space is not as it seems, but contrarily to the
quantum case in which the mappings from the high dimensional fundamental space
to the perceived three-dimensional are arbitrary, here the compactiﬁcation mecha-
nism is part of the deﬁnition of the theory.
8.4
Is Space-Time Fundamental?
Many additionally have suggested that recent developments in quantum gravity,
namely the theories that attempt to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics,
imply that space-time is not fundamental but rather emergent.
100
V. Allori

8.4.1
Arguments for Emergence
As we saw, string theory was originally developed assuming a space-time back-
ground (as inert container) but the so-called ‘dualities,’ suggested to some other-
wise. As symmetries relate possible physical description a given theory to one
another, dualities connect different types of strung theories. Two theories are said to
be dual, roughly, whenever they provide the same physics. There are various
dualities. T-duality is a kind of scale invariance. As we saw, the extra dimensions
are compactiﬁed but different theories have different compactiﬁcation mechanisms.
Suppose in a theory T1 a dimension is wrapped around a circle of radius R. It turns
out that, schematically, a theory T2 in which the dimension is wrapped around a
circle of radius 1/R is dual to T1. That is, the transformation R →l/R leaves the
physics invariant. There is no difference between the physics generated by T1, in
which the space is ‘large,’ and by T2, in which the space is ‘small.’ Mirror sym-
metry is the generalization of T-duality: the extra dimensions can be compactiﬁed
so that they form a particular manifold (the Calabi-Yau manifold), which turns out
to be dual to a manifold with a different topology. Then we have S-duality, which
connects theories with different coupling constants (that is, the strength of the
interaction is different): a theory T1 with coupling constant g is dual to a theory T2
with coupling constant 1/g. Another duality is the AdS/CFT (Anti-deSitter/
Conformal Field Theory) duality, which connects a string theory, which includes
gravity and is deﬁned in ten dimensions on an Anti-deSitter space, with a quantum
ﬁeld theory, which does not include gravity, and is deﬁned in three dimensions on
the boundary of the AdS space. Some have argued that the metaphysical lesson we
should draw from dualities is that space-time is emergent. The idea is very similar
to the symmetry arguments we discussed previously, now applied at dualities: if T1
and T2 are dual, they are empirically indistinguishable, and we cannot choose
between them. Only invariant properties describe something real: in the case of
T-duality, for instance, there is no fact of the matter about whether the space is
‘small’ or ‘large:’ space is not fundamental [15, 24, 42].
The ‘rival’ of string theory is quantum gravity, in which general relativity is
quantized. A particular type of quantization leads to canonical quantum gravity,
newer approaches include loop quantum gravity, in which, arguably, space can be
viewed as an extremely ﬁne fabric or network of ﬁnite loops, called spin networks.
The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The spin network
can either persist, fuse or split into several nodes, and “the resulting structure is
taken to be the quantum analogue of a four-dimensional space-time and is called
‘spin foam’” [24]. The theory has not been completely developed but the idea is that
the spin foam represents what is fundamental, rather than space-time, and that the
perceived three-dimensionality thus have to suitably emerge from such structure.

8.4.2
Arguments Against Emergence of Space-Time
The view according to which space-time suitably emerges from a deeper physics
faces very similar problems as wave function realism: ﬁrst of all, how to account for
the appearance of three-dimensional objects evolving in time? Why should we
believe the theory? [23] take on the challenges and sketch possible solutions. The
problem that seems to remain is about the motivation: given that there are alter-
natives, why would one commit to such a radical metaphysical picture?
8.5
What About Time?
So far, we have focused our attention on space, leaving aside many issues regarding
the nature of time. I wish to outline just two connected questions, leaving aside
many other interesting debates, namely whether time passes and whether it has a
direction.
8.5.1
Arguments Against the Passage of Time
The ongoing debate in metaphysics about the nature of time is between those who
believe that the passage of time is objective, and those who believe that this is just
an illusion. Some have argued that in the framework of relativity, in which we go
from space and time to space-time, we should think of time just as another
dimension of a bigger fundamental space, and that the passage of time is just an
illusion (see, e.g. [17]). Others instead argue that it is perfectly coherent to believe
that time passes in a relativistic framework [28, 45].
In addition, there is a tension between microscopic laws and macroscopic
behavior [1, 38]. In fact, on the one hand all macroscopic behavior has a natural
temporal order: eggs break and do not un-break. On the other hand, the microscopic
laws that govern the macroscopic behavior (whether classical, relativistic or
quantum) are time-symmetric. That is, if a process is possible, then so is the process
run backwards. So, why is it possible for the molecules that constitute an egg to
follow both the trajectories corresponding to ‘the egg breaks’ and to ‘the egg
un-breaks,’ while on the macroscopic level we only see eggs that break? The
problem is to explain where the law that describes these macroscopic processes, the
second law of thermodynamics according to which entropy never decreases, is
coming from. Arguably, the puzzle has been solved in the framework of statistical
mechanics by Boltzmann, in which it is overwhelmingly likely for a process to
develop towards maximal entropy, but it is possible that entropy decreases. As
such, eggs can un-break, it is just overwhelmingly unlikely to happen. In order for
the derivation to go through, many, including Boltzmann, believe that it is
102
V. Allori

necessary to assume the so-called ‘past hypothesis,’ the assumption that the uni-
verse started out with an extremely low entropy. Critics of this strategy complain
that this condition calls for an explanation [41], since the probability of the universe
starting in the requisite state is astronomically small (see [13] for a defense).
8.5.2
An Arguments for the Unreality of Time
Similarly to the argument for the emergence of space-time, some have argued that
canonical quantum gravity, one of the contenders to unify general relativity and
quantum mechanics, suggests time does not exist. Canonical quantum gravity gives
rise to the Wheeler-de Witt equation for a universal wave function, the interpre-
tation of which seems to describe a static universe. How can this theory describe a
world like ours in which there is change? This is the so-called ‘problem of time’
(for a review, see [24]). The possible reactions to this problem can be either endorse
timelessness or to attempt to quantize gravity in a different way. For the latter
approach, see [25]. The former path has been taken most notably by [10, 16, 43,
47]. In particular, Rovelli’s basic idea is that we can describe change without time
relating physical systems directly to one another.
8.5.3
Arguments Against the Unreality of Time
Objections to this suggestion are of two sorts: some suggests that the lack of change
in the Wheeler-de Witt equation should not be taken metaphysically seriously, since
it is an artifact of framing the theory in terms of canonical variables [21, 29]. Others
have stressed that it is difﬁcult to see how one can come to believe in a theory in
which time does not exist [22]. As one can see, this is a variety of the problem of
empirical incoherence mentioned above.
8.6
A New Look into the Debates: Primitive Ontology
If the reader has remained with me up to this point, if we set aside the issues
connected with the direction of time, I hope she will be able to see a trend: on the
one hand we have the relationists, the wave function realists, the space-time
emergentists, the antirealist about time, which essentially resort to the intuition that
if something is unobservable then we have no reason to believe it is real; on the
other hand we have the substantivalists, the fundamentalists about space-time (i.e.
the critics of wave function realism and of space-time emergentism), and the realist
about time that instead seem to appeal to the idea that if something has an
8
Space, Time, and (How They) Matter
103

explanatory role then we have reason to believe that it exists, even if it is not
detectable. In fact, many prominent arguments for the former positions are based on
symmetries and invariant features: in classical mechanics, position and velocities
are not invariant, and therefore theory are not real; general relativity is covariant,
therefore space-time points are not real; since there are dualities connecting dif-
ferent string theories, we have no reason to believe one theory over the other.
These, fundamentally, are all varieties of underdetermination arguments, and the
opponents of these views essentially reply that observability is not the only virtue a
theory may possess: explanatory power, in particular, should be taken into account.
The other arguments are slightly different: in quantum mechanics one needs
nothing more than the wave function in order to account for the experimental
results; general relativity suggests that space and time are part of the same con-
tinuum, so space and time are not fundamentally different and time does not pass; in
canonical quantum gravity we have an equation that suggests that noting evolves in
time, so time does not exist. Nonetheless, I think there is still something in common
with the previous arguments: the wave function realist and the antirealist about time
start off the bare formalism of the theory (respectively quantum mechanics, general
relativity and canonical quantum gravity) in order to interpret it. In contrast, their
opponents emphasize that the ‘interpretation’ comes ﬁrst, and the theory should
follow: we make a hypothesis about what the world is made of, and then we
construct a mathematical theory to describe it. In particular, the problems of the
macro-object and of empirical incoherence stem from this reﬂection: one theory
should be able to account for what we experience, they should be able to explain
empirical data, and three-dimensional space (or four-dimensional space-time) seems
to be essential for that.
In this last section, I wish to brieﬂy describe a unifying account of fundamental
physical theory that essentially captures the ideas just outlined: the primitive
ontology approach (for an updated version, see [4]). The main idea is that funda-
mental physical theories are about three-dimensional entities which evolve in time
(the primitive ontology). The prototype of a theory with primitive ontology is
classical mechanics, according to which macroscopic objects are composed of
microscopic three-dimensional point-particles, and the temporal evolution of such
objects is determined by Newton’s equation. The proponents of this view point out
the macro object problem and the problem of empirical coherence in quantum
mechanics and quantum gravity as a motivation for their view: that is, theories with
a primitive ontology are explanatory successful and empirically coherent, in con-
trast with their rival views. Because of these reasons, they propose that not only
Bohmian mechanics, but also GRW and Everettian mechanics are actually theories
about three-dimensional entities, may that be particles, or continuous three-
dimensional ﬁelds, or space-time events (‘ﬂashes’) [7, 8]. The idea is that the wave
function does not describe matter, in contrast to what the wave function realist
believe, but rather should be seen more like a nomological entity, needed to
implement the law of evolution for the primitive ontology. Similarly, in the context
of quantum gravity [21] dissolve the problem of time by arguing that the metric is
104
V. Allori

the primitive ontology of the theory, whose evolution is governed by the wave
function, which obeys to the Wheeler-de Witt equation. When confronted by
dualities in string theory, the primitive ontologist will similarly argue that empirical
adequacy and observability are not the only virtues a theory should have, and that
space-time and objects in it are essential to explain theory experiences. Finally, in
the context of the substantivalism-relationism debate, what does this approach
have to say? At least one thing: in classical mechanics position is fundamental,
being the primitive ontology, and symmetry arguments are completely ineffective
in this context.

Relativity Theory May not Have the Last
Word on the Nature of Time: Quantum
Theory and Probabilism
Nicholas Maxwell
Abstract Two radically different views about time are possible. According to the
ﬁrst, the universe is three dimensional. It has a past and a future, but that does not
mean it is spread out in time as it is spread out in the three dimensions of space.
This view requires that there is an unambiguous, absolute, cosmic-wide “now” at
each instant. According to the second view about time, the universe is four
dimensional. It is spread out in both space and time—in space-time in short. Special
and general relativity rule out the ﬁrst view. There is, according to relativity theory,
no such thing as an unambiguous, absolute cosmic-wide “now” at each instant.
However, we have every reason to hold that both special and general relativity are
false. Not only does the historical record tell us that physics advances from one
false theory to another. Furthermore, elsewhere I have shown that we must interpret
physics as having established physicalism—in so far as physics can ever establish
anything theoretical. Physicalism, here, is to be interpreted as the thesis that the
universe is such that some uniﬁed “theory of everything” is true. Granted physi-
calism, it follows immediately that any physical theory that is about a restricted
range of phenomena only, cannot be true, whatever its empirical success may be. It
follows that both special and general relativity are false. This does not mean of
course that the implication of these two theories that there is no unambiguous
cosmic-wide “now” at each instant is false. It still may be the case that the ﬁrst view
of time, indicated at the outset, is false. Are there grounds for holding that an
unambiguous cosmic-wide “now” does exist, despite special and general relativity,
both of which imply that it does not exist? There are such grounds. Elsewhere I
have argued that, in order to solve the quantum wave/particle problem and make
sense of the quantum domain we need to interpret quantum theory as a funda-
mentally probabilistic theory, a theory which speciﬁes how quantum entities—
electrons, photons, atoms—interact with one another probabilistically. It is con-
ceivable that this is correct, and the ultimate laws of the universe are probabilistic in
character. If so, probabilistic transitions could deﬁne unambiguous, absolute

cosmic-wide “nows” at each instant. It is entirely unsurprising that special and
general relativity have nothing to say about the matter. Both theories are
pre-quantum mechanical, classical theories, and general relativity in particular is
deterministic. The universe may indeed be three dimensional, with a past and a
future, but not spread out in four dimensional space-time, despite the fact that
relativity theories appear to rule this out. These considerations, ﬁnally, have
implications for views about the arrow of time and free will.
9.1
Two Views About the World
Ordinarily we think of the world as a three-dimensional place, with a past and a
future. Things change. Time passes. Future events, after a time, occur now, and then
become a part of the past, but none of this means that we ordinarily think of the
universe as spread out in both space and time, objects having temporal parts and
temporal extension in the same way that they have spatial parts and spatial extension.
Only when we think of the distant past—and perhaps the distant future—is there
a temptation to think of time in spatial terms, so that the distant past is, as it were,
“another place”. Science ﬁction about time travel exploits this tendency. It exploits
our tendency to think of the distant past, and distant future, as distant “places”
which we might travel to, for example in H.G. Well’s Time Machine.
Why are we prone to think of distant times on analogy with distant places? This,
I think, is the reason. When we travel through space, we encounter new objects—
new houses, cities, landscapes. But this is ordinarily hardly the case if we stay in the
same place, and allow minutes or an hour or two to pass. The distant past—or the
distant future—is, however, likely to contain objects quite different from those
around us now (unless, perhaps, we are in some very ancient building). Hence,
there is the temptation to think of distant times as “distant places” which we might
visit if only we could discover how to create a viable time machine.
Much of the apparently bafﬂing nature of time arises, I think, from a common
sense tendency (to which some philosophers seem prone) to try to combine these
two ways of thinking about time—or rather, two ways of thinking about the nature
of the world, the three-dimensional view,1 and the four-dimensional view.2 We
entertain the broadest possible perspective, and consider the entire history of the
1If string theory is correct, there may be 9 or 10 spatial dimensions. The “three dimensional view”
becomes the nine or ten dimensional view. The crucial tenet of this view is, not the number of
spatial dimensions, but rather that the world is not spread out in time in the way in which it is
spread out in space.
2See [7], where I referred to the three and four dimensional views as C2 and C1 respectively, and
brieﬂy made the point that much confusion about time stems from attempting to combine these two
incompatible views. The main point of the article was to argue that necessary connections between
successive states of affairs are possible, despite Hume’s arguments to the contrary, but only if the
three-dimensional, C2, view is true.

universe, from its beginning in the big bang to its end in the big crunch, or from
eternity to eternity (if eternal it should be). There is all of reality stretched out before
the mind’s eye, from the most distant past to the most distant future, and encom-
passing our present existence and time, now. But then we become aware of
something missing: the present. If the universe really is stretched out in time, as it is
stretched out in space, the vital now of present existence seems somehow to be
missing. And so we attempt to add it, by adding a moving “now” along the time
line, a brilliant light of existence, moving steadily from past to future.3
At once a host of bafﬂing questions arise. Why is the dimension of time so
profoundly different from the other dimensions of space? What is it that marks out
“the present moment” from all other moments, past and future? What is it that
causes “the present” to be so different from all other times? Why does “the present”
move as it does, from past to future? What causes it so to move? How fast does it
move? Do we need another dimension of time to mark the movement of the present
along the time line? How long does “the present” endure? Does “the present” exist
objectively, or is it no more than a subjective experience? Is time travel, back into
the past, or forward into the future ahead of the passage of “the present”, possible?
What is it about time that enables it steadily to digest the future, turning it ﬁrst into
the present, and then into the past? What exactly do these mysterious transforma-
tions consist in? What keeps the present remorselessly travelling into the future and
away from the past? There is, in the constitution of things, it seems, a mysterious
process of absolute becoming, when events in the future enter the present and
become actualized; for an instant they blaze into existence before disappearing into
the shadows of the past. But what is this process of absolute becoming? How is it to
be understood?
All these bafﬂing questions only arise because, probably without even being
aware of it, we have tried to combine two views about time, or rather two views
about the nature of the universe, that are in ﬂat contradiction with one another, and
cannot be combined. The two views are the three-dimensional view of the universe,
and the four dimensional view. Granted the four-dimensional view, “now” is like
“here”: it is just where you happen to be. There is no such thing as “the objective
now”—or rather, all moments are equally entitled to be called “the objective now”.
Granted the three-dimensional view, there is no such thing as “the objective now”
either. There is just the three-dimensional universe as it is now. That is indeed all
there is. The past and the future are not “places” separated from us by temporal
“distance”. In speaking of events “that lie in the past”, or “in the future” we are
speaking metaphorically about what has been and what will be: no more. Objects are
spread out in space, but not in time; it is facts about objects, their histories, that can
be represented as being spread out in time. Such space-time representations depict,
3This incoherent view would seem to be implicit in McTaggart’s A-series, according to which
events are initially future, then present, then past, future events being converted into past ones by
the passage of the present along time: see McTaggart (1908). It is explicit in all those attempts to
rectify the perceived inadequacy of the spacetime view (or McTaggart’s B-series) by adding “the
present” to it, or “objective becoming”, which is supposed to move steadily from past to future.

not objects, not the world, but facts about objects, facts about the world. And
whereas the four-dimensional view needs to appeal to distinctive phenomena—
irreversible processes, the second law of thermodynamics—in order to account for
the direction of time, the distinction between the future and the past, the three-
dimensional view does not need to make any such appeal. That time goes by in one
direction, and the future becomes the past, is built into the nature of time, according
to this view. Even if the universe one day degenerates into a state such that no
irreversible processes occur, still time would pass from the future to the past.
9.2
The Impact of Relativity Theory
Up until 1905, it seemed as if science was indifferent between the two views, three
and four dimensional. Then along came Einstein’s special and general relativity, in
1905 and 1915, and it seemed that theoretical physics had declared unequivocally in
favour of the four-dimensional view.4 The three-dimensional view, sometimes
called presentism, was, it seemed, decisively refuted.
Let E1 and E2 be any two events separated in space and time in such a way that
light cannot travel from one to the other. E1 might be the event of me typing “E1”
into my computer, while E2 might be a short-lived ﬂare occurring abruptly on the
surface of the sun at a time that is simultaneous, for me, with me typing “E1”.
Einstein’s theory of special relativity now tells us the following. In some reference
frames, E1 occurs before E2; in other reference frames, all moving with respect to the
ﬁrst set, E1 occurs after E2; and in a third set of reference frames, all stationary with
respect to me, E1 and E2 occur simultaneously, at the same moment. Furthermore,
according to special relativity, all these reference frames are equally viable. No one
reference frame can be picked out as the proper, unique, objectively correct one.
The consequences for the three-dimensional view—presentism—are devastating.
For the three-dimensional view only makes sense if there is, at every instant, a unique,
cosmic-wide “now”—the three-dimensional universe as it is at this instant. If this does
not exist—if there is no such thing as the unique, cosmic-wide “now” at each instant
—as special relativity tells us, then the three-dimensional view becomes incoherent.
What is required to exist for it to be viable does not obtain. The three-dimensional
view is refuted by special relativity. And general relativity just conﬁrms the point.
Modern theoretical physics obliges us, it seems, to accept the four-dimensional view,
with all its disturbing implications. The universe just is. The passage of time is an
illusion. There is no such thing as the objective “now”. All instants, everywhere, at all
times and places, are equally entitled to be regarded as “now”, just as all places are
equally entitled to be regarded as “here”. Free will becomes no more than an illusion
4It is really Hermann Minkowski who ﬁrst interpreted special relativity in terms of the
four-dimensional, space-time view in 1908: see [25]. Einstein’s 1905 paper implicitly takes the
three-dimensional view for granted.
112

since, if everything, past, present and future, just (tenselessly) is, what we do now
cannot affect in any way what will come to be, in the future. Even more seriously,
perhaps, our whole world—or at least the way we ordinarily conceive of the world in
terms of the three-dimensional view—turns out to be an illusion. The four-
dimensional “block universe” (as it is sometimes called) is very different from the
three-dimensional world of human actions, persisting and changing things.
9.3
Special and General Relativity Are Both False
If general relativity is true, then special relativity is false. Special relativity requires
space-time to be ﬂat. General relativity, however, tells us that space-time becomes
curved in the presence of matter, or energy-density more generally—energy associ-
ated with radiation as well as matter. Wherever you go in the universe, however far
from stars and galaxies, the presence of matter, or energy-density, even if distant, still
curves space-time very slightly, according to general relativity. Special relativity is
thus false everywhere; and in some places, near black holes for example, where
space-time is subjected to marked curvature, special relativity will be quite badly false.
But what of general relativity? Is it false? There are three grounds for holding
that it is.
First, general relativity seems to be incompatible with quantum theory. Attempts
to unify the two theories so far have failed. Many theoretical physicists believe string
theory will unify relativity theory and quantum theory.5 Other theoretical physicists
strongly disagree.6 So far, string theory has not been conﬁrmed experimentally.
But even if string theory, or some other theory, does succeed in unifying general
relativity and quantum theory—or the standard model, the quantum ﬁeld theory of
fundamental particles and the forces between them—in all likelihood, the unifying
theory will reveal that general relativity is false. Almost always when two theories,
T1 and T2 are uniﬁed by a new theory, T3, it emerges that T3 is incompatible with the
predecessor theories, T1 and T2, and reveals these theories to be false.7 Here, then,
are grounds for holding that general relativity will eventually turn out to be false.
5For a popular exposition and defence of string theory see [5].
6For criticisms of string theory see [29, 27].
7The ﬁrst great unifying theory in physics was Newtonian theory. This theory uniﬁes Kepler’s laws
of planetary motion, and Galileo’s laws of terrestrial motion. But in doing so, it reveals that both
Kepler’s and Galileo’s laws are, strictly speaking, false. Granted Newtonian theory, planets deviate
from precise Keplerian, elliptical motion because the planets attract each other gravitationally, and
attract the sun, which leads to deviations. Again, granted Newtonian theory, a stone falling near the
earth’s surface does not fall with constant gravitation precisely because, as it falls, it gets closer to
the centre of the earth, and thus the gravitational attraction on the stone increases very slightly,
which means in turn that its acceleration increases very slightly. Newtonian theory explains why
there are deviations from Kepler’s and Galileo’s laws. This almost always occurs whenever a new
theory, T3, uniﬁes two predecessor theories, T1 and T2.
9
Relativity Theory May not Have the Last Word on the Nature …
113

Second, almost all fundamental physical theories so far proposed that have been
accepted because of their immense empirical success, have turned out subsequently
to be, strictly speaking false. This is true of Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, and
Galileo’s laws of terrestrial motion: see note 7. Special and general relativity reveal
that Newtonian theory is false. James Clerk Maxwell’s classical theory of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld reveals that predecessor laws of the electric force between
charged particles, and the magnetic force between magnetic poles, are false.
Quantum theory reveals that the whole of classical physics is false (Newtonian and
Maxwellian theory). Relativistic quantum theory (quantum ﬁeld theory) reveals that
non-relativistic quantum theory is false. It is all too likely, then that current accepted
fundamental theories of physics, general relativity and the standard model, will turn
out to be false too, when a better theory emerges that uniﬁes these current theories.
Third, there is an argument which provides strong grounds for holding that any
dynamical theory of physics, which is about a restricted range of phenomena only,
must be false. It goes like this. Theoretical physics only ever accepts uniﬁed fun-
damental dynamical theories, even though endlessly many empirically more suc-
cessful disuniﬁed rivals are always available. This means that physics accepts a
substantial metaphysical assumption about the nature of the universe: it is such that
all (precise) disuniﬁed dynamical theories are false. The universe is such that some
kind of uniﬁed pattern of physical law runs through all phenomena. Some such
thesis as this is as secure an item of theoretical scientiﬁc knowledge as anything
theoretical can be in physics. It is so secure, indeed, that physical theories that clash
with it are rejected out of hand—not even considered—whatever their empirical
success might be if they were considered.
Despite the validity of this argument, and its widespread dissemination in the
literature since it was ﬁrst published over 40 years ago in 1974,8 it is still almost
universally ignored. This is because it clashes with the orthodox conception of
science ﬁrmly and almost unthinkingly taken for granted by scientists, philosophers
of science and the public alike. This conception holds that, in science, evidence
alone decides what theories are to be accepted and rejected. Considerations that
have to do with simplicity, unity or explanatory power may inﬂuence choice of
theory too, to a limited extent, but not in such a way that the world itself, or the
phenomena, are permanently assumed to be simple, uniﬁed, or comprehensible. The
decisive point is this: no factual thesis about the nature of the universe can be
accepted permanently, as a part of scientiﬁc knowledge independently of, and
certainly not in violation of, the evidence. This orthodox view, widely taken for
granted, I call standard empiricism.
The above argument concerning persistent acceptance of uniﬁed theories
demonstrates, however, that standard empiricism is false. Persistent acceptance of
uniﬁed theories when endlessly many empirically more successful disuniﬁed rivals
8See, for example, Maxwell [9, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23].
114
N. Maxwell

are available means that science does make a big, persistent assumption about the
universe independent of the evidence (even in a sense in violation of the evidence):
the universe is such that some kind of uniﬁed pattern of physical law runs through
all phenomena.
This thesis is, however, profoundly problematic. We have no reason to suppose
that it is true. Even if it is true, the speciﬁc version of it that we hold at any stage in
the development of physics is almost bound to be false. A glance at the history of
physics reveals that we have changed our ideas a number of times as to what kind of
uniﬁed pattern does run through all phenomena. I argue that we need a new con-
ception of scientiﬁc method which facilitates the improvement of the big, prob-
lematic, metaphysical assumption physics is obliged to make. We need to represent
this assumption in the form of a hierarchy of assumptions, these becoming less and
less substantial as one goes up the hierarchy, and so more and more likely to be
true, and more nearly such that the given assumption needs to be true for science, or
the pursuit of knowledge, to be possible at all: see Fig. 9.1. As we descend the
hierarchy, from level 7 to 3, assumptions become increasingly substantial, and
increasingly likely to be false and in need of revision. At levels 6 to 3, we choose
that assumption which (a) accords best with what is above in the hierarchy, and
(b) has led to, or promises to lead to, the greatest empirical growth at levels 1 and 2,
the levels of experimental results and testable theory. As physics advances, and we
improve our knowledge and understanding of the universe, we improve assump-
tions and associated methods at levels 3 and 4; improving knowledge leads to
improving assumptions and methods—improving knowledge about how to improve
knowledge. There is something like positive feedback between improving scientiﬁc
knowledge at levels 1 and 2, and improving knowledge about how to improve
knowledge. Science adapts its nature to what it ﬁnds out about the nature of the
universe—the key to scientiﬁc rationality which helps explain the astonishing,
explosive growth in scientiﬁc knowledge. I call this hierarchical view of science
aim-oriented empiricism.9 One day, aim-oriented empiricism will replace the
untenable but at present orthodox view of standard empiricism. In what follows, I
take aim-oriented empiricism for granted.
At level 4 in the hierarchy of theses there is the thesis that the universe is such
that a uniﬁed pattern of physical law runs through all phenomena. I call this thesis
physicalism. According to aim-oriented empiricism, physicalism is a pretty secure
item of theoretical scientiﬁc knowledge. So secure, indeed, that any physical theory
that severely clashes with it is to be rejected on that account, whatever its empirical
success may be.
Physicalism tells us that, whatever it is that determines precisely the way some
speciﬁc kind of phenomenon evolves in space and time is precisely the same as that
which determines the way all phenomena evolve, whether they be at the centre of

the earth, inside our heads, or inside the sun. This has the consequence that a theory
that is precisely correct about the way any speciﬁc phenomenon, or any limited
range of phenomena, evolve must thereby be correct about the way all phenomena
evolve. This in turn means that a theory that is about a restricted range of phe-
nomena only—so that it cannot be generalized to apply to all phenomena—must
be only approximately valid about the phenomena to which it does apply. That is,
it must be false. As far as fundamental physics is concerned, in order to be true
about anything a theory must be true about everything. The only serious candi-
dates for truth are so-called “theories of everything”—theories about all physical
phenomena.

116
N. Maxwell

All physical theories so far developed (with the possible exception of string
theory) are about restricted ranges of phenomena only. Hence, they are all false—
even if some, such as quantum theory, are incredibly successful empirically, in
making accurate predictions about a vast range of diverse phenomena. In particular,
then, general relativity is false—despite its unity, and its empirical success.
Both special and general relativity are false.
9.4
Is the Three Dimensional View Viable Given
that Relativity Theory Is False?
Does the falsity of relativity theory mean that the three dimensional view can be
salvaged after all? That is by no means obvious. The falsity of relativity theory does
not mean that all the empirical predictions of the theory are false as well. Indeed, we
know that this is not the case. Special relativity is astonishingly successful
empirically, and is integral to quantum electrodynamics, quantum electroweak
theory, quantum chromodynamics, and the so-called standard model that puts these
three theories together. And general relativity has met with predictive success as
well. If special and general relativity imply that the 4 dimensional, spacetime view
is true, then this implication may well be true even though the theories, from which
it is derived, are ultimately false.
Everything depends on how, in what way, relativity theory is false.
Here, I explore the possibility that general relativity is false because it is a
deterministic theory but the basic laws of nature are fundamentally probabilistic.10
9.5
Probabilism, Quantum Theory and the Three
Dimensional View
Orthodox quantum theory (OQT) fudges two basic questions about the quantum
domain:
1. What sort of entities are the objects of the quantum domain: electrons, photons,
atoms?
2. Is the quantum domain fundamentally deterministic or probabilistic?
The ﬁrst problem arises because electrons, atoms and other quantum entities
seem, mysteriously to have both wave-like and particle-like properties. Niels Bohr,
Werner Heisenberg, in developing quantum theory (QT), decided that the quantum
wave/particle problem could not be solved and, as a result, developed QT as a
10For earlier discussion of this idea see [12, 20]. For a much more detailed discussion of the
closely related issue of relativity and quantum non-locality see [6].
9
Relativity Theory May not Have the Last Word on the Nature …
117

theory, not about quantum entities as such, but rather about the results of per-
forming measurements on quantum entities. The version of quantum theory that
emerged—OQT—avoids specifying what sort of entities electrons and atoms are
when not being observed, but pays a very heavy price as a result. OQT is obliged to
call upon some part of classical physics for a treatment of the measuring process.
OQT cannot predict the outcome of measurement without classical physics, for that
would require OQT to be able to specify, in a consistent way, what quantum entities
are, and it is just this that OQT cannot do. (If OQT is applied to the measuring
process, a further measurement must be made before OQT can issue in physical
predictions.) Thus, the theory that makes physical predictions is quantum theory
plus some part of classical physics. And this theory is unacceptably ad hoc and
disuniﬁed, precisely because it is made up of two incompatible parts that are only
rendered compatible by arbitrarily restricting their respective ranges of application
(quantum postulates to quantum states, classical physics to macro measuring
instruments).11 As we saw in Sect. 3 above, a physical theory, in order to be
acceptable, must be (a) sufﬁciently empirically successful and (b) sufﬁciently uni-
ﬁed. OQT satisﬁes condition (a) magniﬁcently, but fails dismally to satisfy con-
dition (b).
Failure to solve the quantum wave/particle problem also leads to the failure of
OQT to answer unambiguously whether the quantum domain is deterministic or
probabilistic. According to OQT, quantum states evolve deterministically, in
accordance with Schrödinger’s time-dependent equation. Probabilism only enters in
when measurements are made. But OQT is wholly ambiguous as to whether
measurement really does involve the occurrence of objective probabilistic events.
On the one hand, OQT in general makes probabilistic predictions about the out-
come of measurements. But, on the other hand, OQT can hardly be interpreted as
asserting that probabilistic events really do occur when, and only when, measure-
ments are made. Is it conceivable that the universe would have had to wait for
billions of years for physicists to make measurements, and thus provoke proba-
bilistic events to occur for the ﬁrst time? Secondly, if Schrödinger’s equation is
applied to the measuring process, everything proceeds deterministically!
In order to develop an acceptable version of quantum theory (QT), the above two
questions must be clearly answered, and not just fudged. Granted that both deter-
minism and probabilism are possible, are there any grounds for favouring one over
the other?
There are. OQT, despite being unacceptably disuniﬁed, is nevertheless quite
astonishingly successful empirically. OQT predicts a greater variety of phenomena
with greater accuracy than any other physical theory. It has never been refuted.
OQT has evidently got a great deal right about the quantum domain; it is just that it
fails to solve the wave/particle problem, and thus must incorporate measurement
into the theory, thus rendering it unacceptably disuniﬁed.
11This argument is spelled out in greater detail in Maxwell [8, 10]. See also [2, 13].
118
N. Maxwell

What all this suggests is that we should, initially, seek to keep as close to the
structure of OQT as possible, and modify the theory just sufﬁciently to eliminate the
devastating defects of the theory: the failure to solve the wave/particle problem, the
resulting need to call upon measurement in an essential way, and the failure to
answer the question: Is nature deterministic or probabilistic?
In order to do this, the decisive step we need to take is to eliminate “measure-
ment” from the basic postulates of the theory.12 That in turn requires that we solve
the wave/particle problem. Probabilism, dramatically, enables us to do both!
OQT says: quantum states evolve deterministically, in accordance with Schrö-
dinger’s equation, until a measurement is made, when (in general) something
ostensibly probabilistic occurs. If we adopt the conjecture of probabilism, we can
modify this very slightly (implementing the above plan), so that QT asserts:
quantum states evolve deterministically, in accordance with Schrödinger’s equa-
tion, until speciﬁc quantum mechanical physical conditions arise, and an objectively
probabilistic event occurs.
At once we have a solution to the wave/particle problem! Given probabilism,
“Are quantum entities waves or particles?” is the wrong problem. Waves (or ﬁelds)
and particles come from deterministic classical physics. If probabilism holds, and
quantum entities interact with one another probabilistically, they ought to be quite
different from classical deterministic entities, such as classical waves or particles.
Granted probabilism, the wrong, traditional question “Waves or particles?” needs to
be replaced by the two correct questions: “What kind of unproblematic, funda-
mentally probabilistic entities are there, as possibilities?” “Can we see quantum
entities as some variety of these possible, unproblematic, fundamentally proba-
bilistic entities?” Fundamentally probabilistic entities may be called propensitons.
Propensitons could be such that probabilistic events occur continuously in time,
or they could be such that their physical state evolves deterministically until speciﬁc
physical states of affairs arise, when and only when a probabilistic transition occurs.
We may call the latter intermittent propensitons. Our strategy is to stick as close to
the structure of OQT as possible. This requires that we hold that electrons, atoms
and the rest are intermittent propensitons.
The simplest, most elementary example of an intermittent propensiton that one
can think of is the following. It is, initially, a tiny sphere, of a deﬁnite radius. This
expands, at some ﬁxed rate until it touches another such sphere. That is the con-
dition for both spheres to shrink instantaneously into the initial tiny spheres, each to
be located probabilistically somewhere within the volume of its big sphere state.
We can now make this intermittent propensiton a bit more interesting by pos-
tulating that each sphere has within it a “stuff”, which varies in density in a
wave-like way. The density of this “stuff” determines the probability of location of
the tiny sphere. Already we have an entity which can begin to mimic the behaviour
of quantum entities. We can imagine sending a stream of these “spheres” at a
12I ﬁrst made this point in [8].
9
Relativity Theory May not Have the Last Word on the Nature …
119

two-slitted screen: most of the sphere’s “stuff” is reﬂected from the screen, but some
passes through both slits. The waviness of the “stuff” then interferes, producing
bands on a second screen, where conditions are such as to localize probabilistically
the spheres. This elementary intermittent propensiton is able to mimic the results of
the two-slit experiment, generally held to illustrate most strikingly the enigmatic
“wave/particle” behaviour of quantum entities.
There is just one ﬁnal modiﬁcation that needs to be made to our elementary
intermittent propensiton, and we have full quantum theory. We specify that the
propensity state of the propensiton is speciﬁed by Ψ(r, t), a complex function that
attributes a complex number to each point in space, r, at a given time, t. We specify
(a) that Ψ(r, t) evolves in time in accordance with Schrödinger’s equation, and
(b) that |Ψ(r, t)|2dV gives the probability of the propensiton being localized in the
volume element dV. We have all but recovered quantum theory, but with this
difference: quantum theory has become a fully realistic, fundamentally probabilistic
theory about the evolution and probabilistic interactions of intermittent propensi-
tons. This version of QT—propensiton quantum theory (PQT) as we may call it—
solves the wave/particle problem by declaring that electrons, photons, atoms, etc.,
are intermittent propensitons.
But a key problem remains to be solved: What is the quantum mechanical
condition for probabilistic transitions to occur? My proposal here, ﬁrst put forward
in 1982, is that probabilistic transitions occur if and only if “particles”, or bound
systems are created or destroyed as a result of inelastic interactions.13 For example
if an electron collides with a hydrogen atom so that the system goes into a
superposition of (a) an electron and hydrogen atom and (b) two electrons and one
proton (the hydrogen atom being dissociated), then, although this superposition
exists, it does not persist. Entirely in the absence of measurement, or interaction
with an external environment, when the interaction is very nearly at an end, the
superposition jumps probabilistically into either (a) the electron plus hydrogen atom
state, or (b) the two electron and one proton state, the probabilities being those
predicted by OQT (if a measurement were made). As I have shown elsewhere, this
version of PQT recovers all the empirical success of OQT but nevertheless differs
from OQT for as yet unperformed experiments.
Some years after I ﬁrst put forward this version of PQT, Roger Penrose proposed
another version. Both versions hold that probabilistic transitions are associated with
superpositions involving mass. But whereas I hold that what is required is a
superposition of states, each with different particles or bound systems associated
with them (of different mass), Penrose’s idea is that what is required is that a
sufﬁciently massive body evolves into a state that is a superposition of different
positions in space.14
Just conceivably, my version of PQT, Penrose’s version, or some other version,
may be correct. Let us, in any case, conjecture that this is so. The quantum domain

is such that, when speciﬁc quantum mechanical conditions arise, quantum states
undergo instantaneous probabilistic transitions.
At once PQT comes into sharp conﬂict with special relativity.15 Probabilistic
changes of quantum state, of the kind required by PQT, will be such that the
quantum state changes instantaneously throughout a region of space. But such a
change will only be instantaneous in one reference frame.16 In all other reference
frames in motion with respect to this one frame, the change of state will not be
instantaneous: it will travel at a faster than light, but ﬁnite, velocity, from one
spatial position to another. If the change of state is caused by an interaction
occurring in a relatively small spatial region, dV, then in some reference frames, a
part of the quantum state far away spatially from dV, will begin to change, and to
travel towards dV, before the event has occurred which causes the probabilistic
transition. In these frames we have the absurdity that changes of quantum states
anticipate future events!
Instantaneous probabilistic changes of quantum state, required by PQT, conﬂict
with special relativity because they pick out a privileged reference frame, in which
the change of state is instantaneous. Special relativity, however, demands that all
inertial reference frames are equivalent, no one frame being uniquely privileged in
representing the laws of nature.
Here, then, is a way in which relativity theory might be false in such a manner
that the three dimensional view of the universe can be salvaged. Instantaneous
probabilistic changes of quantum state pick out the unique cosmic “now” required
to exist by the three dimensional view.
9.6
Ontological Probabilism and Relativity Theory
Reconciled
It may be, however, that probabilism, if true, does not just falsify relativity theory.
There is the possibility that a kind of partial reconciliation can be brought about
between probabilism and relativity theory. Both might, in a sense, be true. Perhaps
we can have our cake and eat it.
Let us conjecture that ontological probabilism is true, and hence the three
dimensional view is true as well. Some version of PQT is correct: probabilistic
changes of quantum state occur instantaneously across vast regions of space. These
15Probabilism and special relativity do not inevitably contradict one another, a point I made in
[12]. This point is borne out by the existence of a fundamentally probabilistic, Lorentz invariant
version of quantum theory developed by Tumulka [28]. This is a version of the theory of [4].
Tumulka’s theory suffers, however, from severe limitations: its ontology is that of discrete
spacetime points, there are no interactions between “particles” and, most serious of all, nothing
corresponds physically, in reality, to the quantum state.
16Here, and in what follows, I take “one rest frame” to mean “one set of reference frames all at rest
with respect to each other”.

spatial regions may, incidentally, be very big indeed. Consider a photon emitted by
an early star some tens of millions of years after the big bang. This has travelled in
opposite directions for some 13 billion years, to be absorbed by the eye of someone
gazing at the night sky. Instantaneously, the photon is annihilated. One instant it
ﬁlls a region of space over 26 billion light years across; the next instant it has
ceased to exist. Such an instantaneous collapse of state picks out a privileged
reference, and an instantaneous “now”, with a vengeance.
But let us suppose that such probabilistic collapses of quantum state are all that
there is in the constitution of things to pick out “the reference frame at rest”, and
thus “the cosmic now”. There is nothing else in the physical constitution of things
that picks out the privileged reference frame to be the frame at rest. In particular,
that which determines how physical states of affairs evolve deterministically in time
in between probabilistic transitions has nothing associated with it which can
determine which frames are at rest, which in motion. As far as deterministic
evolutions of physical states are concerned, any inertial reference frame or, more
generally, any coordinate system, is as good as any other. To a ﬁrst approximation,
special and general relativity are correct. Only probabilistic transitions reveal the
serious inadequacy in relativity theory, in that they pick out the “cosmic-wide now”
at each instant, thus picking out one frame of reference to be the privileged rest
frame.
Our supposition is, then, that this state of affairs will be a feature of the
yet-to-be-discovered true, uniﬁed “theory of everything”—a uniﬁcation of proba-
bilistic quantum theory (or the standard model) and deterministic general relativity
which we may call probabilistic quantum gravity (PQG). This theory comes in two
parts. There is (1) the deterministic part which speciﬁes how physical states of
affairs, propensity states, evolve in time in between probabilistic transitions; and
there is (2) the probabilistic part which speciﬁes the physical conditions that must
obtain if probabilistic transitions are to occur, with the actualization of propensites,
just one of many possible states of affairs becoming actual with such and such
probability.
As far as part (1) is concerned, special and general relativity both hold, to a ﬁrst
approximation; only part (2) reveals the serious inadequacy in both theories.
The viewpoint just outlined is to be contrasted with the neo-Lorentzian view
defended by Craig [3], and very effectively criticized by Balashov and Janssen [1].
According to special relativity, a body, A, set in motion with respect to another one,
B, will be such that lengths in the direction of motion are contracted, clocks go
slow, and masses increase, as measured by B. And all this will be true as well of
lengths, clocks and masses travelling with B, as measured by A. These results
follow from the basic postulates of special relativity: all inertial reference frames are
equivalent, light has the same velocity c in all inertial reference frames, and space is
homogeneous and isotropic. The neo-Lorentzian view supported by Craig rejects
the ﬁrst of these postulates, even as far as the deterministic evolution of physical
states of affairs is concerned. Such evolutions of physical states pick out a unique
reference frame to be the one at rest. Neo-Lorentzianism, as a result, faces two
problems: (1) What exists physically that provides a basis for picking out that
122
N. Maxwell

unique reference frame that is, objectively, at rest? (2) How can the behaviour of
rods, clocks and masses in motion, successfully predicted and explained by special
relativity, be explained by Neo-Lorentzianism? Neo-Lorentzianism fails to answer
these two questions—especially question (2). In connection with question (1), Craig
suggests that, given general relativity, and given the homogeneity and isotropy of
the cosmos, a uniquely natural foliation of spacetime into space and time emerges
which provides a rest frame at each point in space, and a unique cosmic time.17
Neo-Lorentzianism provides no satisfactory answer to (2), no explanation for the
behaviour of rods clocks and masses in motion so beautifully explained by special
relativity. It fails, especially, to explain, given two bodies, A and B, in relative
motion, why A observes B’s lengths to shrink, clocks to go slow, and masses to
increase, and B observes precisely the same of A!
The reconciliation viewpoint, indicated above, faces none of these difﬁculties.
According to this view, only quantum probabilistic transitions determine, physi-
cally, that frame uniquely at rest. Furthermore, as far as deterministic evolutions of
physical states of affairs are concerned, nothing exists that can pick out the rest
frame. All inertial reference frames are equivalent. The postulates of special rela-
tivity hold (to a ﬁrst approximation), and so the consequences of those postulates
hold as well. The problem of explaining why rods, clocks and masses in motion
behave as predicted by special relativity, which poses an insuperable problem for
Neo-Lorentzianism, poses no problem at all for the reconciliation view, indicated
above.
If we are to pursue this “reconciliation” view with complete integrity, we must
acknowledge, it seems, that deterministically evolving physical states, being
inherently indifferent to whether they are moving or at rest (in an absolute sense),
have no way of determining what space-like hyperplane or hypersurface the
instantaneous probabilistic change of physical state occurs, when conditions for it to
occur obtain. The equations of motion, and the conditions for probabilistic collapse
to occur, leave open in what hyperplane the collapse occurs. This is determined by
“the cosmic now” of the three dimensional universe.
Can the hyperplane (or hypersurface) of probabilistic collapse be determined
experimentally? What answer is to be given to that question will depend, I take it,
on the speciﬁc form probabilistic quantum gravity takes.

Nature’s Book Keeping System
Gerard ’t Hooft
Abstract Establishing how one should describe and study nature’s fundamental
degrees of freedom is a notoriously diﬃcult problem. It is tempting to assume that
the number of bits (or qubits) needed in a given Planckian 3-volume, or perhaps 2-
volume, is a ﬁxed ﬁnite number, but this ansatz does not make the problem much
easier. We come not even close to solving this problem, but we propose various
ingredients in phrasing the questions, possibilities and limitations that may serve as
starting points.
10.1
Introduction
When formulating a theory concerning the physical world, one usually just assumes
that the basic kinematical variables are known, and can be enumerated, and studied
by some experimental technique. Think of stars and planets in some star system, a
star or planet itself, or eventually some agglomeration of elementary particles, as the
case may be. The more basic and interesting part of the theory is then the attempt
to explain the behaviour of these variables, in terms of some mathematical scheme,
often using symmetries to make the problem more manageable.
One clearly assumes then that we know what the main variables are, how their
properties, such as coordinates and momenta, can be listed, and most importantly,
how we can maintain a book keeping system such that the results of our calculations
can be checked against experimental observations.
In many practical cases, such a book keeping system appears to be totally under
control, so that it requires little further discussion. Assuming that natural phenomena

have a deductive ordering, we are tempted ﬁrst to focus on nature’s book keeping
system at the tiniest distance scales. Once that it understood, we can go to higher
levels and arrange our schemes for those branches of physics as well.
In this treatise, we focus on the more primary question: what are nature’s most
fundamental kinematic variables, and how do we ﬁnd out about them? In short: what
is nature’s book keeping system at the most fundamental level?
10.2
The Sub-atomic World
Today, the terrain of the tiniest distance scales of physics where things are still pretty
clear, is the world of the sub-atomic particles. How to do the book keeping system
there, and indeed also how to perform the next step, which is the detailed description
of nature’s evolution laws, was unravelled during most of the 20th century.
The way to list the dynamical degrees of freedom for the subatomic particles is
dictated by nature’s symmetry laws, notably special relativity, in combination with
the laws of quantum mechanics. We are in the fortunate situation that this combina-
tion is so restrictive that only one scheme survived, called quantum ﬁeld theory. The
situation still seemed to be so complex that most of the 20th century was needed to
handle all obstacles, but the outcome was crystal clear.
At ﬁrst sight, there appear to be two distinct descriptions for the subatomic par-
ticles, to be referred to as ﬁeld space and Fock space. When we choose the ﬁeld
space option, we register the functional distribution of all ﬁelds in the system, of
which there are three types: the gauge connection ﬁelds Aa
𝜇(⃗x, t), which are vectors
in 4 dimensional Minkowski space-time, the spinorial Dirac ﬁelds 𝜓i
𝛼(⃗x, t), 𝜓𝛼
i (⃗x, t),
which form a Grassmann algebra, and some scalar ﬁelds 𝜙a(⃗x, t). Now by far the
most practical way to register the ﬁelds is to list the values of their Fourier compo-
nents, so that the ﬁelds are expanded in terms of plane waves. Each of these waves
behaves as a harmonic oscillator. One subsequently subjects these oscillators to the
rules of quantum mechanics. In accordance with whatever is dictated by the (rel-
ativistic) ﬁeld equations, the oscillators will be weakly or strongly coupled. The
(multi-dimensional) Schrödinger equations resulting from this can now be handled
by standard methods in mathematical physics.
The Fock space solution may seem to be something altogether diﬀerent. Here,
we do not talk of ﬁelds, but of states with arbitrary numbers of elementary particles
present. These particles, and their anti-particles, may have spin 1, 1∕2, or 0, and we
list which of them are present, and what their coordinates ⃗x are, at the time t. The par-
ticles may form quantum wave functions, and their motion is dictated by relativistic
equations. The particles may interact weakly or strongly, and their energies can be
calculated. During an interaction, particles can be created or destroyed.
Surprisingly, it was found that these two ways to register what is going on, are
diﬀerent sides of the same coin. The operator ﬁelds describing the creation or anni-
hilation of particles, are to be identiﬁed with the ﬁelds mentioned previously, while

10
Nature’s Book Keeping System
129
the energy quanta of these ﬁelds are identiﬁed with the particles. One then discovers
that both descriptions are totally equivalent. They lead to exactly the same predic-
tions for the outcomes of an experiment. Analysing the situation further, one ﬁnds
that both schemes are subject to the energy conservation law: every conﬁguration
has a characteristic energy, and the total energy is a positive, conserved quantity.
This law dictates that simple ﬁeld or particle conﬁgurations also evolve into simple
conﬁgurations. More involved conﬁgurations require more energy. Thus, we should
be aware of the fact that the ﬁeld / Fock space method owes its success to the energy
conservation law.
10.3
Gravitation
All this is not at all the ﬁnal word on nature’s book keeping system. What was kept out
of the picture so-far, was the gravitational force. This force obeys Einstein’s equations
for gravity, but these are subject to a new symmetry: general relativity.
Of course, what physicists in the second half of the 20th century tried to do, is to
adapt the ﬁeld / Fock description of nature’s degrees of freedom to these new ﬁeld
equations, discovering that also new particles are needed: gravitons, which carry
spin 2, and perhaps gravitinos, with spin 3∕2. What went wrong?
Technically, at least two things went wrong. One was that, space and time, or the
coordinates that ought to be used to register our particles and our waves, themselves
become dynamical, due to space-time curvature, as if the books in which we want
to write the whereabouts of our particles, began to lead lives of their own. Closely
related to this was the problem that the new ﬁeld equations, and the particle equa-
tions alike, became non-renormalizable. This means that the ultra-small distance
behaviour runs out of control.
But something else went wrong: something wicked happens with the energy con-
servation law: gravity is an attractive force, and it becomes stronger if mass, or equiv-
alently, energy, conglomerates. Energy increases if we concentrate on smaller dis-
tance scales. The energies of particles, regardless how much mass they have, can
approach to zero and even, in a sense, become negative. The strength of the gravita-
tional force then totally runs out of control.
An other way of saying this is as follows. Since gravity attracts equal sign masses,
while electric and magnetic forces, as well as the weak force, act repulsively when
charges carry equal signs, gravitational ﬁelds carry a negative ﬁeld energy density,
which may compensate for any positive amount of energy that other particles or
ﬁelds might have. This implies that the energy conservation law can no longer be
called upon to keep the laws of physical interactions under control. Nature’s book
keeping rules will here have to be entirely diﬀerent from what we are used to in
particle physics.
In fact, there seems to be no strong impediment against the formation of ultra-tiny
black holes. If two particles approach one another too closely with too much energy,
black hole formation is inevitable. In quantised general relativity, neither Fock space

130
G. ’t Hooft
nor ﬁeld space provide useful lists of all possible conﬁgurations. It should not be a
surprise that we still have not come with credible, let alone complete, laws on how
things evolve at such small distances. The distance scale at which things are sure to
go haywire, is the so-called Planck length,
LPlanck =
√
ℏG∕c3 = 1.6162 × 10−33 cm ,
(10.3.1)
where G is Newton’s constant. This is roughly a billion times a billion times smaller
than the sizes of particles studied in the Large Hadron Collider. Now imagine a vol-
ume of space of just a few Planck units cubed. What can we suggest about nature’s
book keeping system to describe anything one can imagine sitting in such a tiny
region?
10.4
Superstrings and Black Holes
There are numerous clues that may be considered. A very powerful proposal is that
of superstring theory. Representing the tiniest objects in physics as being line-like
instead of point-like, yielded equations that are much more restrictive than the older
relativistic equations for point-like objects, and the renormalization diﬃculties seem
to disappear. Strings refuse to be crammed into tiny volumes because of their sym-
metry constraints.
There is much support for this idea, but I do see various problems with it. One is
that, just because strings cannot be folded into tiny volumes, the notion of locality
seems to be in jeopardy. An other is the lack of a local energy law, which could
destabilise these systems. Then, even if inﬁnities may cancel out, there still seem to
be no obvious bounds as to how much information can sit in a tiny volume. Finally,
there is the issue with the microscopic black holes.
In short, strings seem to be far from orderly book keepers. We should search for
something better. Of course, we do not exclude the possibility that, after ﬁnding a
more satisfactory answer, string theory may return to become the most promising
game in town.
A more systematic attack comes from the black holes themselves. Black holes as
tiny as the Planck scale will be diﬃcult to understand as yet, but when their typical
length scale, the radius r = 2GM∕c2, is more than an order of magnitude bigger,
then standard quantum ﬁeld theory dictates their behaviour: such black holes emit all
sorts of particles, with a an apparently perfectly thermal1 spectrum, called Hawking
radiation [2]. From this calculation, it is easy to derive the entropy of a black hole,
and a little statistical physics then reveals a startling feature: The total number of
distinct quantum states a black hole can be in, is an exponential function of the
horizon area [3].
1This neat picture has recently been questioned; thermodynamics alone does not suﬃce for the book
keeping of particles near a black hole horizon [1].

10
Nature’s Book Keeping System
131
This is only a small number of states, and the fact that it depends on the area
rather than the total volume, came as a surprise. It looks as if black holes require
a very simple book keeping law: one boolean degree of freedom (something like a
spin variable that can only take the values ±1), for every fundamental little square
on the horizon. The fundamental surface of such a square will be
𝛿Σ = (4 log 2) L2
Planck .
(10.4.1)
Since black holes seem to be the most compact form of matter that can exist in
nature, having one boolean degree of freedom per unit of surface area seems to be
an absolute maximum [4]. This is referred to as the holographic principle: nature’s
information content can be measured in terms of bits per cm2, with the inverse Planck
length squared as an absolute bound [5]. One gets the impression that nature might
obey a beautiful book keeping system.
All we have to do now is insert the details, and ﬁgure out nature’s laws about
processing these data.
This turns out to be prohibitively diﬃcult today. One diﬃculty is Lorentz invari-
ance. Suppose we have a situation with the maximal amount of information on a large
surface. Now, perform a Lorentz transformation that keeps the surface in place. We
get an other conﬁguration, which is the previous one, but Lorentz contracted. There
seems to be no limit on how many Lorentz contractions one can perform, but there
should be such a limit, otherwise our book keeping system would not be ﬁnite.
Black holes do suggest what to do here: according to the statistical interpreta-
tion of the Hawking radiation emitted by the black hole, particles going in transfer
their information onto the particles going out. One can calculate how this happens,
by studying the curvature of space-time as caused by the gravitational ﬁelds of the
in- and out-going objects [6]. The longitudinal location of the out-particles turns
out to depend on the momenta of the in-going ones, and this is an important clue:
nature’s book keeper throws in-going particles into the basket of out-going ones, if
only we could understand in more detail how this happens. We calculate how the
gravitational force between in-going particles and out-going particles brings about
this behaviour. These investigations may pay oﬀalready at the domain of the Stan-
dard Model itself: all particles species will have to leave their unique imprints in the
fabric of space and time. Yet, this calculation did not lead to a properly ﬁnite book
keeping device—although we think we came close [1, 7].
In short, the diﬃculty seems to be that Einstein’s gravity equations include ﬁelds
that describe the curvature of space and time. This adds a twist to our story: nature
has to write its book keeping records on crumbled material: curved space-time. How
do we make sense of that?
A daring answer could be that, for putting down information regarding space,
time and matter, one has to replace this folded space-time material by something
that is almost ﬂat. It would be against Einstein’s general invariance principle, but we
may have to prepare for prices of this kind that will have to be paid. Nature might be
giving us clues concerning this point: our universe appears to be almost ﬂat, too ﬂat
to make sense in an uncensored Einsteinian theory.

132
G. ’t Hooft
One guiding principle was strongly adhered to by practically all researchers: any-
thing as small as molecules, atoms, subatomic particles and other energy quanta,
or smaller, always required the language of quantum mechanics to describe their
properties. Most researchers take this to mean that we will need to use this quan-
tum mechanical language no matter which approach we try. Yet, here also, one can
have doubts. To me, quantum mechanics seems to be a tool rather than a theory. This
means that, the most commonly employed interpretation of quantum mechanics, a
discipline that sometimes seems to challenge our sense of logic to the extreme, may
not always be justiﬁed. One can speculate that nature’s ultimate book keeping device
at the tiniest possible scales, must be simpler than any quantum mechanical one [8].
One should immediately add that, giving up general relativity and/or quantum
mechanics, will bestow on us the burden to explain why both principles work so
well in all domains of physics that have been explored at present.
Numerous other schemes have been proposed, over time. As is often the case in
situations such as these, there have been an abundance of completely wild concoc-
tions that serious researchers have come up with. Lack of phantasy is not our problem
[9–11]. The question is rather, how to ﬁnd a direct chain of solid arguments, with
many calculations on the way to corroborate intermediate conclusions, leading to
an unavoidable result that explains how particles, ﬁelds, energy quanta or whatever,
can be listed in any tiny domain of our physical world, such that, when we take into
account the physical laws controlling their behaviour, we ﬁnd out how things behave
at larger scales, until we hit the domain of ordinary quantum ﬁeld theories, with
which we can calculate almost anything we wish to know.
Note our emphasis on scales and sizes of things. In ordinary physics there seems
to be no limit on how small one can imagine fundamental units of matter to be. In
an orderly controlled physical world, there must come an end to these scale transfor-
mations. There is one natural way in which one may imagine such an “end of scales”
to arrive in our book keeping system: scaling symmetry or more precisely, the intro-
duction of exact local scale- and conformal invariance. One can then employ the
same book keeping variables to describe all scales to come. The use of such a sym-
metry, which must be a local symmetry, is quite well-known in theoretical particle
physics, and is called local gauge invariance. Local gauge invariance can be ‘spon-
taneously broken’ (the well-known BEH mechanism). But the known gauge theo-
ries mostly refer to internal rotation groups, not scaling transformations. Again, here
General Relativity may help us to explore new grounds: coordinate transformations
do include scale transformations, and this means that a locally conformal invariant
description of gravitational eﬀects [12, 13] is possible, in principle. It is the present
author’s view that one must look at gravitation from this perspective. General rel-
ativity features an exact local conformal gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously
broken just as in BEH.
Thus, we emphasise, the bookkeeping system that we are after, should be able to
describe literally all states that can occur in the physical world. Without going into
any details, let us brieﬂy recapitulate what we may have arrived at today.

Nature’s Ultimate Book Keeping System
When trying to describe nature’s most general state, we have to ask what the ultimate
state will look like when we squeeze as much matter as is possible into the tiniest
possible volume. One usually expects one or more black holes to form. All presently
known laws of fundamental physics make use of quantum mechanics, so, even if one
is skeptical about this, it is natural ﬁrst to search within the quantum formalism. A
very important notion then is unitarity: two states that start out to be orthogonal and
normalised, evolve into another pair of states that is also orthogonal and normalised.
Laws of gravity, as they are known today, then suggest that all forms of matter
will be geometric: the way they aﬀect the curvature of space and time is the only
form of information that is conserved [1, 6, 7]. We think we drew the important
conclusion that observations of the sort mentioned here, will be the only way to
reconcile ﬁniteness of the degrees of freedom with an unbounded group of local
Lorentz transformations. This is extremely important, if true. It means that Fock
space will not be the appropriate language; rather, we get something that resembles
a bit more string theory, which is also basically geometric. String theories known
today, however, seem not yet to be based on very sound book keeping.
Indeed, for this, and other reasons, string theory has been under attack [14].
According to Smolin, the internal logic in string theories is too hazy to serve as
a sound physical prescription. Consequently, it is all but impossible to extract reli-
able predictions from string theories, other than the claim that everything will soon
be understood. These attacks are understandable, but not totally justiﬁed. String the-
ory is a collection of quite impressive mathematical constructions and theorems. The
feeling, shared by many of its practitioners, is that these mathematical notions must
mean something, and that our physical world is likely to require such ingredients.
String theory tells us that there are not only point particles, described by ﬁelds that
can be used for a Fock space formalism, but in addition, we have stringlike features,
as well as two-dimensional membranes and higher dimensional structures. This is
an important lesson, and it may well be that this idea will be important for our the-
oretical thinking in the future.
The demand from string theory that space and time themselves must feature either
10 or 26 dimensions, however, seems to be too restrictive. If indeed, as we suspect,
physical degrees of freedom form discrete sets, then dimensionality of space and
time may be less well-deﬁned notions, so that such ‘predictions’ from string theory
may well be due to some mathematical idealisation having little to do with reality. All
in all, we are badly in need of a more orderly listing of all conceivable conﬁgurations
of physical variables in a small region of space and time.
As the reader may notice, this demand by itself is also not formulated very sharply.
This is exactly the point we wish to bring forward in this paper. Part of our problem
is the precise formulation of our question or questions. Nature’s book keeping sys-
tem must be outlined together with the answers to the question how the variables
will evolve in time. It is important to observe that the big revolutions in science

134
G. ’t Hooft
often came with improvements in our way to phrase the physical degrees of free-
dom, together with new proposals as to how these evolve. The grand total is what we
call physical law.
Smolin complains that science today is slowing down considerably, and blames
this to the rise of string theory and its staggering promises, at the expense of other
approaches in the basic sciences.
But Smolin forgets that the real revolutions in science are often only recognised
in hindsight. To our judgement, it is quite conceivable that many or all of our ques-
tions concerning nature’s book keeping system will be solved in the not so distant
future. However, the road towards these solutions will consist of very small but math-
ematically precisely formulated steps in our way of thinking. String theory was an
interesting guess, but may well have been a too wild one. We are guessing the math-
ematical structures that are likely to play a role in the future, but we fall short on
grasping their internal physical coherence and meaning. For this, more patience is
needed.

Spacetime and Reality: Facing the Ultimate
Judge
Vesselin Petkov
The views of space and time which I want to present to you arose
from the domain of experimental physics, and therein lies their
strength.
Minkowski [1]
Abstract Over a 100 years ago in his paper Space and Time Hermann Minkowski
revealed the profound physical meaning of the relativity postulate—the experimen-
tal fact that physical phenomena are the same in all inertial reference frames implies
that every inertial frame has its own space and time, which in turn implies that the
Universe is an absolute four-dimensional world in which all moments of time have
equal existence due to their belonging to the fourth (time) dimension. Since then
there has been no consensus on the reality of this absolute world, which we now
call Minkowski spacetime or simply spacetime. One might be tempted to interpret
this situation in a sense that the question of the dimensionality of the world is so
deep that we seem unable to comprehend it fully, which might be a manifestation of
the ﬁrst hints that there might exist some limits of our understanding of the world.
I will argue that human abilities to understand the physical world are much greater
than what most think by examining the issue of the reality of spacetime and show-
ing that none of the experiments which conﬁrmed the kinematic relativistic eﬀects
would be possible if the world were not four-dimensional. Therefore, facing the ulti-
mate judge—the experimental evidence—allows us (i) to realize fully that in 1908
Minkowski had a better (than the present) understanding of the profound physical
meaning of Einstein’s special relativity as a theory of an absolute four-dimensional
world, and (ii) to settle the issue of the reality of spacetime once and for all.

Introduction
Over a century after the publication of Minkowski’s paper Raum und Zeit in 1909
[2] the issue of the reality1 of spacetime (or the absolute world as Minkowski called
it)—whether spacetime is just a mathematical four-dimensional space or it repre-
sents a real four-dimensional world—is still unresolved. What I think is even worse
is that what seems to be the most shared view among both physicists and philosophers
appears to be taking for granted the existence of some kind of objective becoming
(which denies the reality of all events of spacetime) and thus denying the reality of
the four-dimensional world, envisioned by Minkowski when he proposed the uniﬁ-
cation of space and time into an inseparable four-dimensional entity.
Explicitly or implicitly many physicists and philosophers regard spacetime as
nothing more than a mathematical space which does not represent a real four-
dimensional world. This view was explicitly defended by N. David Mermin in a rel-
atively recent article What’s bad about this habit in the May 2009 issue of Physics
Today where he argued that “It is a bad habit of physicists to take their most suc-
cessful abstractions to be real properties of our world” [3]. He gave the issue of
the reality of spacetime as an example—“spacetime is an abstract four-dimensional
mathematical continuum” [3]—and insisted that it is “a bad habit to reify the space-
time continuum” [3]. Mermin appeared to be so certain that the notion of spacetime
does not represent a real four-dimensional world that he was openly lecturing Physics
Today’s readers: “I would urge you to consider that this continuum is nothing more
than an extremely eﬀective way to represent relations between distinct events” and
“The device of spacetime has been so powerful that we often reify that abstract book-
keeping structure, saying that we inhabit a world that is such a four- (or, for some of
us, ten-) dimensional continuum” [3].
A 100 years after the publication of Minkowski’s paper on spacetime it is diﬃ-
cult to explain the continued existence of views so clearly stating that spacetime does
not have an ontological counterpart. By regarding spacetime as an abstract mathe-
matical construction such views eﬀectively ignore the revolutionary contribution of
Minkowski to the advancement of our views of space and time. And indeed, if space-
time were merely a mathematical space with no counterpart in the world, we would
call the uniﬁcation of space and time Poincaré spacetime, not Minkowski spacetime,
because it was Poincaré who ﬁrst noticed in his paper Sur la dynamique de l’électron
(before July 23, 1905 when he submitted the paper) that the Lorentz transformations
had a geometric interpretation as rotations in what he seemed to have regarded as an
abstract four-dimensional space [4, p. 168]. Poincaré appeared to have seen nothing
revolutionary in the idea of a mathematical four-dimensional space since he believed
that our physical theories are only convenient descriptions of the world and therefore
it is really a matter of convenience and our choice which theory we would use. Here
is Poincaré’s own explanation [5]:
1By “reality of spacetime” I mean, following Minkowski, a real four-dimensional world.

It quite seems, indeed, that it would be possible to translate our physics into the language of
geometry of four dimensions. Attempting such a translation would be giving oneself a great
deal of trouble for little proﬁt, and I will content myself with mentioning Hertz’s mechanics,
in which something of the kind may be seen. Yet, it seems that the translation would always
be less simple than the text, and that it would never lose the appearance of a translation, for
the language of three dimensions seems the best suited to the description of our world, even
though that description may be made, in case of necessity, in another idiom.
That Minkowski did not regard the absolute world implied by the relativity prin-
ciple, as he argued, as an abstract four-dimensional continuum is seen even from
the following general argument. Had he believed, like Poincaré, that uniting space
and time into a four-dimensional space was only a convenient mathematical abstrac-
tion, he would not have written a paper whose title and content were devoted to
something the main idea of which had already been published by Poincaré 2 years
(and written more than 3 years) before Minkowski’s talk on space and time given
on September 21, 1908, and would not have begun his paper with the now famous
introduction, which unequivocally announced the revolution in our views on space
and time: “From now onwards space by itself and time by itself will recede com-
pletely to become mere shadows and only a type of union of the two will still stand
independently on its own” [1].
However, the most convincing argument that Minkowski regarded the absolute
four-dimensional world as real was provided by himself—he stressed that the strength
of the new views of space and time he proposed comes from experimental physics
[1]. So a century ago Minkowski was the ﬁrst human (and please note—a mathe-
matician) who faced the ultimate judge—the experimental evidence—on the issue
of the ontological status of space and time. He did that by discussing one of the most
important pieces of experimental evidence in the twentieth century—the negative
result of the “famous interference experiment of Michelson” [1] that was carried out
to detect the motion of the Earth with respect to the aether. Minkowski reviewed
how Lorentz tried to explain it through a hypothesis that the arm of the interfer-
ometer used contracts in the direction of the Earth’s motion due the contraction of
its constituents (Lorentz used electrons to demonstrate the contraction hypothesis).
Here is exactly how Minkowski realized that the experimental evidence forced upon
us the new concept of space and time [1]:
Lorentz called t′, which is a combination of x and t, local time of the uniformly moving
electron, and associated a physical construction with this concept for a better understanding
of the contraction hypothesis. However, it is to the credit of A. Einstein who ﬁrst realized
clearly that the time of one of the electrons is as good as that of the other, i.e. that t and t′
should be treated equally. With this, time was deposed from its status as a concept unambigu-
ously determined by the phenomena. The concept of space was shaken neither by Einstein
nor by Lorentz …
It was Minkowski who ﬁrst made that attack on the concept of space when he real-
ized that the postulated by Einstein equal reality of the time t (of an object believed to
be at rest with respect to the aether) and the time t′ (of an object in uniform motion)
was the profound physical meaning of the experimental impossibility to detect the
motion of the Earth in the aether. Minkowski pondered over the implications of the

140
V. Petkov
fact that objects in relative motion have diﬀerent (equally real) times and arrived at
the inescapable conclusion—if there exist more than one time, there should exist
more than one space as well. Minkowski explained [1] that in the case of two inertial
reference frames in relative motion along their x-axes
one can call t′ time, but then must necessarily, in connection with this, deﬁne space by the
manifold of three parameters x′, y, z in which the laws of physics would then have exactly
the same expressions by means of x′, y, z, t′ as by means of x, y, z, t. Hereafter we would then
have in the world no more the space, but an inﬁnite number of spaces analogously as there
is an inﬁnite number of planes in three-dimensional space. Three-dimensional geometry
becomes a chapter in four-dimensional physics. You see why I said at the beginning that
space and time will recede completely to become mere shadows and only a world in itself
will exist.
There is some irony in Minkowski’s discovery that the world is four-dimensional.
The mathematician Minkowski wanted to understand why physical phenomena are
the same in all inertial reference frames, whereas the physicist Einstein merely postu-
lated that fact and called it the relativity postulate (or the relativity principle) without
explaining it.
That is why, Minkowski ﬁrst realized the important hidden message in the exper-
imental fact that physical phenomena are the same in all inertial reference frames—
the experimental fact implies that the Universe is an absolute four-dimensional world
in which space and time are inseparably amalgamated; only in such a world one can
talk about many spaces and many times. And indeed, physical phenomena are the
same in all inertial reference frames because every inertial observer describes the
phenomena in his reference frame (i.e. in his own space and time) in which he is
at rest. For example, the Earth is at rest with respect to its space and therefore all
experiments conﬁrm this state of rest.
Minkowski noted that “I think the word relativity postulate used for the require-
ment of invariance under the group Gc is very feeble. Since the meaning of the pos-
tulate is that through the phenomena only the four-dimensional world in space and
time is given, but the projection in space and in time can still be made with a certain
freedom, I want to give this aﬃrmation rather the name the postulate of the absolute
world” [1].
Since Minkowski arrived at the new view of space and time—that we live in an
absolute four-dimensional world—when he faced the ultimate judge (a single exper-
iment at that time2), it is diﬃcult to understand how what now appears to be a wide-
spread view could still regard spacetime as nothing more than a mathematical con-
tinuum given the fact that we have at out disposal more experiments that conﬁrmed
2This is the Michaelson-Morley experiment which Minkowski mentioned explicitly and which used
electromagnetic signals (light) to try to detect the Earth’s motion with respect to the aether. That
experiment showed that not only mechanical experiments (discussed and used by Galileo) fail to
discover motion with constant velocity, but experiments involving electromagnetic phenomena fail
too. The expression “physical phenomena are the same in all inertial frames” simply means that
motion with constant velocity cannot be discovered; otherwise, if physical phenomena were diﬀer-
ent in some inertial frames, that would mean that those frames were in a state of absolute motion.

the relativistic eﬀects. A century after Minkowski’s insight I think it will be fair to
take our turn and also face the ultimate judge on the reality of spacetime. We owe
this to Minkowski.
The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the theory of relativity
would be impossible if the world were three-dimensional. Section 11.2 shows how
relativity of simultaneity is possible only in a four-dimensional world. Section 11.3
revisits Minkowski’s explanation of length contraction and discusses a more visual-
ized version of his explanation through a thought experiment involving a meter stick,
which demonstrates that no length contraction would be possible if the meter stick
existed as a three-dimensional body.
11.2
Relativity of Simultaneity
Although no specially designed experiments have been carried out to test relativity
of simultaneity, this major consequence of special relativity can be regarded as an
experimental fact for two reasons:
∙The experimental fact captured in the relativity postulate—physical phenomena
are the same in all inertial reference frames—implies, as Minkowski demon-
strated, that physical objects in relative motion have their own spaces and times,
which can be explained if it is assumed that what exists is a four-dimensional
world. But as a space constitutes a class of simultaneous events, it follows that
relativity of simultaneity is a consequence of the existence of many spaces and
therefore ultimately a consequence of the experimental fact of the invariance of
physical phenomena, which is reﬂected in the relativity postulate.
∙As we will see in Sect. 11.3 length contraction, which have been experimentally
conﬁrmed, is a speciﬁc manifestation of relativity of simultaneity.
In order to understand fully why, unlike Poincaré, Minkowski appeared to have
realized that special relativity would be impossible in a three-dimensional world, is to
ask explicitly the questions that Minkowski appeared to have implicitly considered—
“What is the world?” and “How does the new concept of space and time aﬀect our
view of what exists?”
Concerning the ﬁrst question, it seems we do not have much choice—most of
those who regard spacetime as nothing more than a mathematical device appear
(explicitly or implicitly) to hold the presentist view according to which the Universe
is a single three-dimensional world deﬁned as everything that exists simultaneously
at the constantly changing moment ‘now’. Minkowski might have started with this
view too. Then, the answer to the second question follows naturally—the fact that
objects in relative motion have diﬀerent spaces (i.e. diﬀerent classes of simultane-
ous events) implies that they have diﬀerent three-dimensional worlds. But this is
only possible if these worlds are diﬀerent three-dimensional “cross sections” of an
absolute four-dimensional world; it is impossible to have many spaces and times and

142
V. Petkov
relativity of simultaneity in a three-dimensional world. Indeed, if the world were
three-dimensional (i.e., if spacetime were not representing a real four-dimensional
world and were just an abstract mathematical space), there would exist one space and
one absolute class of simultaneous events (since a three-dimensional space consti-
tutes a single class of absolutely simultaneous events) in contradiction with relativity.
It should be stressed that the above argument is irrefutable only if the existence
of physical objects and the world itself is regarded as absolute—only then the rel-
ativistic fact that observers in relative motion have diﬀerent spaces and therefore
diﬀerent classes of simultaneous events implies an absolute four-dimensional world.
But if existence is relativized, it appears to follow that relativity is possible in a
three dimensional world—every observer would acknowledge the existence of only
his own space (and three-dimensional world) and would deny the existence of the
spaces (and the three-dimensional worlds) of the other observers in relative motion.
So it appears that relativity of simultaneity (and therefore length contraction as well)
can be explained either (i) in terms of absolute existence (in this case relativity of
simultaneity implies a four-dimensional world—Minkowski’s explanation) or (ii) in
terms of relative existence (in this case the three-dimensionality of the world would
be preserved—what exists for each of the inertial observers in relative motion would
be his relativized three-dimensional world).
It might be tempting to take the relativization of existence seriously since it
preserves the pre-relativistic (presentist) view that what exists is a three-dimensional
world;
moreover,
originally
Einstein
formulated
special
relativity
in
a
three-dimensional language. But a careful analysis shows that that option contra-
dicts the experiments that conﬁrmed the twin paradox [6, Chap. 5]. In fact, it can be
immediately shown that the idea of relativization of existence is not a serious alter-
native to the deep intuition that the very essence of existence makes it impossible
to regard it as relative. If we assume that relativization of existence is the correct
interpretation of relativity of simultaneity (which means that for every observer only
his three-dimensional world would exist), we arrive at total nonsense when we ask
what exists for an observer in general relativity.
Let us consider a single inertial observer and assume that what exists relative
to the observer is his three-dimensional world, i.e. his present. In ﬂat spacetime
an inertial observer is represented by a straight worldtube and the presents corre-
sponding to diﬀerent moments of the proper time of the observer are parallel to
one another and do not intersect. In curved spacetime, however, the worldtube of
any observer is curved, which means that the presents at diﬀerent moments of the
observer’s proper time intersect one another. As a result, some events which were
past at a given moment would be future at a later moment. This nonsensical conclu-
sion follows from the assumption that reality for an observer in general relativity is
a three-dimensional world. Therefore considering even a single observer in general

11
Spacetime and Reality: Facing the Ultimate Judge
143
relativity rules out presentism and also its relativized version since the view that exis-
tence should be relativized regards the world of an observer as three-dimensional.3
After ruling out relativization of existence, the only way to interpret relativity of
simultaneity (i.e. the fact that observers in relative motion have diﬀerent spaces and
times) is Minkowski’s interpretation—that the classes of simultaneous events (i.e.
the spaces) of observers in relative motion are “cross sections” of an absolute four-
dimensional world. Let me stress that there is no alternative to this interpretation—if
one assumed that spacetime were a mathematical device and that the Universe were
a three-dimensional world, there would exist one (i.e. absolute) space and therefore
one (i.e. absolute) class of simultaneous events in contradiction with the experimen-
tal evidence that physical laws are the same in all inertial reference frames.
In the sixties [7, 8] pointed out that relativity of simultaneity does imply a four-
dimensional world. In fact, their relativity of simultaneity argument, as we have
seen, follows from the more general analysis (the existence of many spaces) that
led Minkowski to the idea of spacetime. Like Minkowski’s analysis, their argument
has not been fully appreciated. Many physicists and philosophers have been refus-
ing to accept the reality of the four-dimensional world of relativity, but have not
explained how relativity of simultaneity would be possible if the world were three-
dimensional. An example is Stein’s criticism of the Rietdijk-Putnam argument [9,
10]. He correctly pointed out that one could not talk about distant present events in
relativity but seemed to believe that he refuted the Rietdijk-Putnam argument (which,
in essence, is Minkowski’s argument) and some philosophers agreed with him. What
he certainly refuted, however, is the presentist view according to which what exists
is a single class of distant present events. Unfortunately, Stein criticized Rietdijk and
Putnam for arguing that relativity of simultaneity implies a four-dimensional world,
but explained neither how relativity of simultaneity would be possible if the world
were not four-dimensional nor what the dimensionality of the world according to
relativity would be.
So, when one explicitly asks the two questions above—what our view of the world
is and how that view is aﬀected by relativity—it follows that relativity of simultane-
ity is a manifestation of the four-dimensionality of the world (i.e. of the reality of
spacetime) as Minkowski pointed out. Due to the equal existence of all events of
spacetime, observers in relative motion can regard diﬀerent “cross sections” of it as
their classes of simultaneous events (i.e. as their spaces). If there existed just one
class of privileged (due to their existence) events all observers in relative motion
would share that class and no relativity of simultaneity would be possible. When
this is taken into account it becomes evident that the lack of an objectively privi-
leged class of simultaneous events implies not only relativity of simultaneity, but
also conventionality of simultaneity. This should be speciﬁcally emphasized since, I
think, any claim that simultaneity is relative but not conventional would amount to a
contradiction in terms—there exists no objectively privileged class of simultaneous
3This argument can be also explained in the case of accelerated observers in special relativity [6,
pp. 150–152] since an accelerated observer is represented by a curved worldtube in ﬂat spacetime
and therefore the presents corresponding to diﬀerent events of the observer’s worldtube intersect.

144
V. Petkov
events (due to relativity of simultaneity), but there exists an objectively privileged
class of simultaneous events (due to the non-conventionality of simultaneity).
The relativity of simultaneity argument can be also used to rule out a theory
proposed by Broad in 1923, which “accepts the reality of the present and the past,
but holds that the future is simply nothing at all” [11]. Broad’s growing (or evolv-
ing) block universe model of the world has been recently revived by several physi-
cists [12–14] as what appears to be the last remaining alternative to the Minkowski
absolute four-dimensional world. The recent versions of the growing block universe
claim (excluding [13]) that they do not allow any form of a preferred structure. But
if it is explicitly assumed that the existence of physical bodies is absolute, this claim
cannot be supported. The hypersurface on the edge of the growing universe, on which
the birthing (or coming into being) of events happens, constitutes an objectively priv-
ileged class of events (due to the absoluteness of existence), which contradicts rel-
ativity. Also, the growing block universe model leads to the same nonsense when
used to explain what exists for an accelerated observer in ﬂat spacetime or for an
observer in curved spacetime.
11.3
Length Contraction
Length contraction was experimentally tested, along with time dilation, by the muon
experiment in the muon reference frame (see for instance [15]). With this in mind,
let us now ask whether this relativistic eﬀect would be possible if a body, subjected
to length contraction, were what we perceive—a three-dimensional object.
The essence of Minkowski’s explanation of the deep physical meaning of length
contraction of two bodies is that it is a manifestation of the reality of the bodies’
worldtubes (Minkowski called them strips). This can be best understood from Fig. 1
of his paper (the right-hand part of which is reproduced in Fig. 11.1 here)—length
contraction would be impossible if the worldtubes of the two bodies, represented
by the vertical and the inclined strips in Fig. 11.1, did not exist and were nothing
more than “abstract geometric constructions” [3]. To see this even more clearly con-
sider only the body represented by the vertical worldtube. The three-dimensional

cross-section PP, resulting from the intersection of the body’s worldtube and the
space of an observer at rest with respect to the body, is the body’s proper length. The
three-dimensional cross-section P′P′, resulting from the intersection of the body’s
worldtube and the space of an observer moving with respect to the body, is the rel-
ativistically contracted length of the body measured by that observer. Minkowski
stressed that “this is the meaning of the Lorentzian hypothesis of the contraction of
electrons in motion” [1] and “that the Lorentzian hypothesis is completely equivalent
to the new concept of space and time, which makes it much easier to understand”
[1]. The worldtube of the body must be real in order that length contraction be pos-
sible because, while measuring the same body, the two observers in relative motion
measure two three-dimensional bodies represented by the “cross-sections” PP and
P′P′ in Fig. 11.1.
This is not so surprising when one takes into account relativity of simultaneity
and the fact that a spatially extended three-dimensional object is deﬁned in terms
of simultaneity—all parts of a body taken simultaneously at a given moment (so
length contraction is indeed a speciﬁc manifestation of relativity of simultaneity). If
the worldtube of the body were an abstract geometric construction and what existed
were a single three-dimensional body (a single class of simultaneous events) rep-
resented by the proper cross-section PP, both observers would measure the same
three-dimensional body, i.e. the same class of simultaneous events, which means
that simultaneity would be absolute.
That length contraction of a body would be impossible if the body existed as a
three-dimensional object (not a worldtube) can be perhaps better demonstrated by
the following thought experiment, which is a more visualized version of Minkowski
explanation. An ordinary meter stick (Fig. 11.2) is at rest with respect to an observer
A. What is shown in Fig. 11.2 is what we perceive and take for granted that it is what
really exists. According to Minkowski, however, the meter stick exists equally at all
moments of its history and what is ultimately real is the worldtube of the meter stick
as shown in Fig. 11.3.
Assume that another meter stick at rest in another observer’s (observer B’s) refer-
ence frame moves relative to the ﬁrst one at a distance 1 mm above it. Let us assume
that at the event M the middle point of B’s meter stick is instantaneously above the
middle point of A’s meter stick. Imagine also that lights are installed inside A’s meter
stick, which can simultaneously change their color at every instant in A’s frame. At
the event of the meeting M all lights are simultaneously white in A’s frame. At all
previous moments all lights were bright grey. At all moments after the meeting all
lights will be dark grey. When A and B meet at event M this event is present for both
of them. At that moment the present meter stick for A is white (that is, all parts of
A’s meter stick, which exist simultaneously for A, are white). All moments before M

Fig. 11.4
Relativistically contracted meter stick measured by observer B
when all lights of the meter were bright grey are past for A, whereas all moments
when the meter stick will be dark grey are in A’s future.
Imagine that, instead of lights, B’s meter stick contains cameras at every point
along its length. At the event of the meeting M all cameras take snapshots of the
parts of A’s meter stick which the cameras face. At event M all snapshots are taken
simultaneously in B’s reference frame.
Even without looking at the pictures taken by the cameras, it is clear that not all
pictures will show a white part of A’s meter stick, because what is simultaneous for
A is not simultaneous for B. When the picture of A’s meter stick is assembled from
the pictures of all cameras it would show two things as depicted in Fig. 11.4—(i)
A’s meter stick photographed by B is shorter, and (ii) only the middle part of the
picture of A’s meter stick is white; half is bright grey and the other half is dark grey.
So what is past (bright grey), present (white), and future (dark grey) for A, exists
simultaneously as present for B. But this is only possible if the meter stick is the
worldtube as shown in Fig. 11.5. The instantaneous space of B corresponding to the
event M intersects the worldtube of the meter stick at an angle and the resulting three-
color “cross section” is what is measured by B—a diﬀerent three-dimensional meter
stick, which is shorter4 than the meter stick measured by A.
It should be stressed as strongly as possible that no length contraction would be
possible if the meter stick’s worldtube did not exist as a four-dimensional object. If
the meter stick were a three-dimensional object, both observers would measure the
same three-dimensional meter stick (the same set of simultaneously existing parts
of the meter stick), which would mean that the observers would share the same
(absolute) class of simultaneous events in a clear contradiction with relativity [16].
4In Fig. 11.5 the inclined “cross section,” which represents the diﬀerent three-dimensional meter
stick measured by B, appears longer, not shorter, because a fact in the pseudo-Euclidean geometry
of spacetime is represented on the Euclidean surface of the paper.

Conclusion
Minkowski arrived at the new concept of space and time by decoding the hidden
message in a single experiment—the impossibility to detect the motion of the Earth
with respect to the aether implied that observers in relative motion have diﬀerent
spaces (not just diﬀerent times as Einstein postulated), which is only possible in an
absolute four-dimensional world. It was shown that a rigorous analysis, following
Minkowski’s line of thought, demonstrated two things:
(i) Minkowski had a deep understanding of the physical meaning of the experimen-
tal fact that physical phenomena are the same in all inertial reference frames—he
did not postulate (as Einstein did) that that experimental fact should be simply
accepted as a law of nature (the relativity postulate), but explained it: all inertial
observers in relative motion have diﬀerent spaces and times (only possible in a
four-dimensional world) which explains why physical phenomena are the same
for all inertial observers—each observer represents the phenomena in terms of
his own space and time (for instance, the speed of light is the same for all iner-
tial observer since for each observer light propagates in his space with respect
to which he is at rest.)
(ii) The kinematic relativistic eﬀects (here we discussed only relativity of simul-
taneity and length contraction) would be impossible if the world were not four-
dimensional. This, in turn, provides full explanation of the physical meaning of
these eﬀects.
It was shown in the paper how the ultimate judge—the relativistic experimental
evidence—settled the issue of the reality of spacetime once and for all. As the ruling
of the ultimate judge cannot be appealed (that is, it is irrefutable), I believe it is
clear that refusing to face the implications of Minkowski’s view because of the huge
challenges they pose, and trying to squeeze Nature into our pre-set and deceivingly
comfortable views of the world should not be an option for anyone in the 21st century.

The Future’s Not Ours to See

Whatever will be will be
The future’s not ours to see
Que sera sera.
So sang Doris Day in 1956, expressing a near-universal belief of humankind. You
can’t know the future. In this chapter I will trace the diﬀerent forms of this belief,
both pre-scientiﬁc and scientiﬁc, and discuss some diﬀering kinds of scientiﬁc jus-
tiﬁcation for it in physics, culminating in the form of the statement provided by the
best physical theory we have found to date, namely quantum mechanics. I will argue
that quantum mechanics casts doubt on the second line of the song, which suggests
that even if we can’t know it, there is a deﬁnite future (and also that we can’t do
anything to change it—something I will not discuss). This denial is also an ancient
belief: the future is open. If this line of the song expresses fatalism, the denial of it
might be related to the existence of free will, but, again, I will not discuss this.
If it is not quite a universal belief of humankind that we can’t know the future, the
universal experience of humankind is that we don’t know the future. We don’t know
it, that is, in the immediate way that we know parts of the present and the past. We
see some things happening in the present, we remember some things in the past, but
we don’t see or remember the future. But perception can be deceptive, and memory
can be unreliable; this kind of direct knowledge is not certain. And there are kinds
of indirect knowledge of the future which can be as certain as anything we know by
direct perception or memory. I reckon I know that the sun will rise tomorrow; if I
throw a stone hard at my kitchen window, I know that it will break the window. On

the other hand, I did not know on Christmas Eve last year that my home town of
York was going to be be hit by heavy rain on Christmas Day and nearly isolated by
ﬂoods on Boxing Day.
In the ancient world, and, I think, to our childhood selves, it is events like the
York ﬂoods that make us believe that we cannot know the future. I may know some
things about the future, but I cannot know everything; I am sure that some things will
happen tomorrow that I have no inkling of, and that I could not possibly have known
about, today. In the past such events might have been attributed to the unknowable
will of the gods. York was ﬂooded because the rain god was in a bad mood, or felt like
playing with us. My insurance policy refers to such catastrophes as “acts of God”;
when we feel that there is no knowing who will win an election, we say that the result
is “in the lap of the gods”.
Aristotle formulated the openness of the future in the language of logic. Living in
Athens at a time when invasion from the sea was always a possibility, he considered
the sentence “There will be a sea-battle tomorrow”. One of the classical laws of
logic is the “law of the excluded middle” which states that every sentence is either
true or false: either the sentence is true or its negation is true. But Aristotle argued
that neither “There will be a sea-battle tomorrow” nor “There will not be a sea-
battle tomorrow” is deﬁnitely true, for both possibilities lead to fatalism; if the ﬁrst
statement was true, for example, there would be nothing anybody could do to avert
the sea-battle. Therefore these statements belong to a third logical category, neither
true nor false. In modern times this conclusion has been realised in the development
of many-valued logic [1].
But some statements in the future tense do seem to be true; I have given the exam-
ples “The sun will rise tomorrow” and, after I have thrown the stone, “That window
is going to break”. Let’s look at these more closely. In fact, none of these future state-
ments are 100 % certain. The sun might not rise tomorrow; there might be a galactic
star-trawler heading for the solar system, ready to scoop up the sun tonight and make
oﬀwith it at nearly the speed of light. When I throw the stone at the window, my big
brother, who is a responsible member of the family and a superb cricketer, might be
coming round the corner of the house; he might see me throw the stone and catch it
so as to save the window.
We did not know that the sun would fail to make its scheduled appearance tomor-
row morning; I did not know that my naughtiness would be foiled. But this lack of
knowledge is not a speciﬁc consequence of the fact that we are talking about the
future. If the Spaceguard programme had had a wider remit we might have seen the
star-trawler coming, and then we would have known that we had seen our last sunrise;
if I had known my brother’s whereabouts I could have predicted his window-saving
catch. In both these scenarios the lack of knowledge of the future reduces to lack of
knowledge about the present.
The success of modern science gave rise to the idea that this is always true: not
knowing the future can always be traced back to not knowing something about the
present. As more and more phenomena came to be explained in terms of the laws
of physics, so that more and more events could be explained as being caused by
previous events, so conﬁdence grew that every future event could be predicted with

12
The Future’s Not Ours to See
151
certainty, given enough knowledge of the present. The most famous statement of this
conﬁdence was made by Laplace in 1814:
We may regard the present state of the universe as the eﬀect of its past and the cause of
its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in
motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were
also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the
movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an
intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before
its eyes. ([2], p.4)
This idea goes back to Newton, who had a dream:
I wish we could derive the rest of the phenomena of Nature by the same kind of reasoning
from mechanical principles, for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may
all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies, by some causes hitherto
unknown, are either mutually impelled towards one another, and cohere in regular ﬁgures,
or are repelled and recede from one another. [3]
In this view, everything in the world is made up of point particles, and their behaviour
is explained by the action of forces which make the particles move according to
Newton’s equations of motion. These completely determine the future motion of the
particles if their positions and velocities are given at any one instant; the theory is
deterministic. So if we fail to know the future, that is purely because we do not know
enough about the present.
For a couple of centuries Newton’s dream seemed to be coming true. More and
more of the physical world came under the domain of physics, as matter was analysed
into molecules and atoms, and the behaviour of matter, whether chemical, biolog-
ical, geological or astronomical, was explained in terms of Newtonian forces. The
particles of matter that Newton dreamed of had to be supplemented by electromag-
netic ﬁelds to give the full picture of what the world was made of, but the basic idea
remained that they all followed deterministic laws. Capricious events like storms
and ﬂoods, formerly seen as unpredictable and attributed to the whims of the gods,
became susceptible to weather forecasts; and if some such events, like earthquakes,
remain unpredictable, we feel sure that advancing knowledge will make them also
subject to being forecast.
This scientiﬁc programme has been so successful that we have forgotten there
was ever any other way to think about the future. One author writes
In ordinary life, and in science up until the advent of quantum mechanics, all the uncertainty
that we encounter is presumed to be... uncertainty arising from ignorance. [4]
We have completely forgotten what an uncertain world was inhabited by the human
race before the seventeenth century, and we take Newton’s dream as a natural view
of waking reality.
Well, it was a nice dream. But it didn’t work out that way. In the early years of the
twentieth century Ernest Rutherford, investigating the recently discovered phenom-
enon of radioactivity, realised that it showed random events happening at a funda-
mental level of matter, in the atom and its nucleus. This did not necessarily mean that

152
A. Sudbery
Newton’s dream had to be abandoned—the nucleus is not the most fundamental level
of matter, but is a complicated object made up of protons and neutrons, and maybe,
if we knew exactly how these particles were situated and how they were moving, we
would be able to predict when the radioactive decay of the nucleus would happen.
But other, stranger, discoveries at around the same time led to the radical departure
from Newtonian physics represented by quantum mechanics, which strongly rein-
forced the view that events at the smallest scale are indeed random, and there is no
possibility of precisely knowing the future.
The discoveries that had to be confronted by the new physics of the 1920s were
twofold. On the one hand, Planck’s explanation of the distribution of wavelengths in
the radiation emitted by hot matter, and Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric
eﬀect, showed that energy comes in discrete packets, instead of varying continu-
ously as it must do in Newton’s mechanics and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory.
On the other hand, experiments on electrons by Thomson, Davisson and Germer
showed that electrons, which had been ﬁrmly established to be particles, also some-
times behaved like waves. These puzzling facts found a systematic, coherent, uniﬁed
mathematical description in the theory of quantum mechanics which emerged from
the work of theorists after 1926. This theory was itself so puzzling that it is not clear
that it should be described as an “explanation” of the puzzling facts it incorporated;
but an essential feature of it, which seems inescapable, is that when applied to give
predictions of physical eﬀects, it yielded probabilities rather than precise numbers.
This is still not universally accepted. Some people believe that there are ﬁner
details to be discovered in the make-up of matter, which, if we knew them, would
once again make it possible to predict their future behaviour precisely. This is indeed
logically possible, but there would necessarily be aspects of such a theory which lead
most physicists to think it highly unlikely.
The format of quantum mechanics is quite diﬀerent from previous physical theo-
ries like Newtonian mechanics or electromagnetism (or both combined). These theo-
ries work with a mathematical description of the state of the world, or any part of the
world; they have an equation of motion which takes such a mathematical description
and tells you what it will change into after a given time. Quantum mechanics also
works with a mathematical object which describes a state of the world; it is called
a state vector (though it is not a vector in three dimensions like velocity), and is
often denoted by the Greek letter 𝜓or some similar symbol. But this is a diﬀerent
kind of mathematical description from that in mechanics or electromagnetism, which
consists of a set of numbers which measure physical quantities like the velocity of
a speciﬁed particle, or the electric ﬁeld at a speciﬁed point of space; the quantum
state vector is a more abstract object whose relation to physical quantities is indirect.
From the state vector you can obtain the values of physical quantities, but only some
physical quantities—you can choose which quantities you would like to know, but
you are not allowed to choose all of them. Moreover, once you have chosen which
ones you would like to know, the state vector will not give you a deﬁnite answer;
it will only give you probabilities for the diﬀerent possible answers. This is where
quantum mechanics departs from determinism. Strangely enough, in its treatment of
change quantum mechanics looks like the old deterministic theories. Like them, it

12
The Future’s Not Ours to See
153
has an equation of motion which will tell you what a given state of the world will
become after a given time; but because you can only get probabilities from this state
vector, it cannot tell you what you will see after this time.
State vectors, in general, are puzzling things, and it is not at all clear how they
describe physical objects. Some of them, however, do correspond to descriptions that
we can understand. Among the state vectors of a cat, for example, is one describing
a cat sitting and contentedly purring; there is another one describing it lying dead,
having been poisoned in a diabolical contraption devised by the physicist Erwin
Schrödinger. But there are others, obtained mathematically by “superposing” these
two state vectors; such a superposed state vector could be made up of a part describ-
ing the cat as live and a part describing it as dead. These are not two cats; the point
of Schrödinger’s story was that one and the same cat seems to be described as both
alive and dead, and we do not understand how such states could describe anything
that could arise in the real world. How can we believe this theory, generations of
physicists have asked, when we never see such alive-and-dead cats?
There is an answer to this puzzle. If I were to open the box in which Schrödinger
has prepared this poor cat, then the ordinary laws of everyday physics would ensure
that if the cat was alive, I would have the image of a living cat on my retina and in
my visual cortex, and the system consisting of me and the cat would end up in a state
in which the cat is alive and I see a living cat. If the cat was dead, I would have the
image of a dead cat, and the system consisting of me and the cat would end up in a
state in which the cat is dead and I see a dead cat. It now follows, according to the
laws of quantum mechanics, that if the cat is in a superposition of being alive and
being dead, then the system consisting of me and the cat ends up in a superposition
of the two ﬁnal states described above. In symbols,
|
· ·−⟩me
(|alive⟩cat + |dead⟩cat
) ⟶|
· ·⌣⟩me|alive⟩cat + |
· ·⌢⟩me|dead⟩cat.
(12.1)
Here a symbol like |Ψ⟩cat denotes a state vector of the cat, with Ψ varying to describe
diﬀerent states (e.g. Ψ = “alive”), and similarly |Φ⟩me denotes a state vector of my
body and brain, while |Ψ⟩cat|Φ⟩me denotes a state vector of the joint system of the
cat and me. The plus sign between two state vectors denotes the operation of super-
position (mathematically, it is very similar to the process of adding two vectors in
space to give a third vector in between the ﬁrst two).
Look hard at the Eq. (12.1). Nowhere in it is there a state of my brain seeing a
peculiar alive-and-dead state of a cat; there are only the familiar states of seeing a
live cat and seeing a dead cat. This is the answer to the question at the end of the
paragraph before the last one; it follows from quantum mechanics itself that although
cats have states in which they seem to be both alive and dead, we will never see a cat
in such a state.
But now the combined system of me and the cat is in one of the strange super-
position states introduced by quantum mechanics. It is called an entangled state of
me and the cat. How are we to understand it? We can understand the states repre-
sented by |
· ·⌣⟩me|alive⟩cat and |
· ·⌢⟩me|dead⟩cat individually—the cat is alive in one
of them, and dead in the other, and I have the corresponding visual experience—but

154
A. Sudbery
what does this mathematical sum, this superposition, mean? Maybe the mathemati-
cal sign + just means “or”; that would make sense. But unfortunately this meaning,
if applied to the states of an electron, is not compatible with the facts of interference
observed in the experiments that show the electron behaving like a wave ([5], pp.
22–24, 207). Some people think that this + should be understood as “and”: when
the cat and I are in the state (12.1), there is a world in which the cat has died and I
see a dead cat, and another world in which the cat is still alive and I see a living cat.
Others do not ﬁnd this a helpful picture ([5, 6], p. 221). Let us just take it as a true
description of the cat and me, whose meaning is problematic.
Now let us broaden our horizon and consider the whole universe, which con-
tains each one of us considered as a sentient, observing physical system. According
to quantum mechanics this has a description by a state vector like (12.1), with me
replaced by any sentient observer and the cat replaced by the rest of the universe. A
sentient system, like you or me, has a large number of possible experiences, each of
which occurs physically in certain states of the sentient system. These are described
by state vectors of the understandable kind like |
· ·⌣⟩me and |
· ·⌢⟩me. The whole uni-
verse can then be described by a state vector generalising (12.1), in which the states
of the cat are replaced by states of the rest of the universe which go with the possi-
ble experiences of the observer. For those who like equations, the state vector of the
universe is of the form
|Ψ(t)⟩=
∑
n
|𝜂n⟩|Φn(t)⟩
(12.2)
where |Ψ(t)⟩is the state vector of the whole universe at time t, |𝜂n⟩is a state vec-
tor of the observer in which they are having the experience 𝜂n, and |Φn(t)⟩is the
corresponding state of the rest of the universe.
Saying that this is the truth about the universe seems to conﬂict with my knowl-
edge of what I see. Let us suppose that the cat survived when I did Schrodinger’s
experiment. Then I know that my state is |
· ·⌣⟩me and therefore the cat’s state is
|alive⟩cat. The other part of (12.1) is not part of the truth; it describes something that
might have happened but didn’t. In the general case of the whole universe, I know
that I have just one of the experiences 𝜂n and therefore that the state of me and the
rest of the universe is just one of the terms |𝜂n⟩|Φn(t)⟩and not the whole of (12.2).
But this contradicts what was asserted in the previous paragraph. Which of these is
the truth?
This contradiction is of the same type as many familiar contradictions between
objective and subjective statements. It can be resolved in the way put forward by
Nagel [7, 8]: we must recognise that there are two positions from which we can
make statements of fact or value, and statements made in these two contexts are
not commensurable. In the external context (the God’s-eye view, or the “view from
nowhere”) we step outside our own particular situation and talk about the whole uni-
verse. In the internal context (the view from now here), we make statements as phys-
ical objects inside the universe. Thus in the external view, the state vector |Ψ(t)⟩is
the whole truth about the universe; the components describing my diﬀerent possible
experiences, and the corresponding states of the rest of the universe, are (unequal)

12

parts of this truth. But in the internal view, from the perspective of some particular
experience |𝜂n⟩which I know I am having, that experience, together with the corre-
sponding state of the rest of the universe, is the actual truth. I may know what the
other components are, because I can calculate |Ψ(t)⟩from the Schrödinger equation;
but these other components, for me, represent things that might have happened but
didn’t.
We can now look at what quantum mechanics tells us about the future. As we
should now expect, there are two answers, one for each of the two perspectives. From
the external perspective, the universe at any one time is described by a universal state
vector, and state vectors at diﬀerent times are related by the Schrödinger equation.
Given the state vector at the present time, the Schrödinger equation delivers a unique
state vector at any future time: the theory is completely deterministic, in complete
accord with Pascal’s world-view (in a quantum version).
From the internal perspective, however, things are completely diﬀerent. We now
have to specify a particular observer (who has been me in the above discussion,
but it could have been you or anyone else, or indeed the whole human race taken
together), with respect to which we can carve up the universal state vector as in
(12.2); and we have to specify a particular experience state of that observer, say |𝜂0⟩.
From the perspective of that experience, it is by deﬁnition true that the observer
has the deﬁnite experience 𝜂0, and it follows from (12.2) that the universe is in a
product state |𝜂0⟩|Φ0(t)⟩. The Schrödinger equation applies, as before. But with this
initial state the Schrödinger equation will yield a state of the universe at a future
time which, in general, is not a product state; in particular, in situations like that of
Schrödinger’s cat in which quantum eﬀects are ampliﬁed to a macroscopic level at
which they can be seen by our observer, the initial product state will develop into
a superposition like the right-hand side of (12.1). So at the future time there will
be a universal state vector of the form (12.2), in which most terms will be zero but
more than one experience state of the observer occurs with non-zero coeﬃcient. (A
“coeﬃcient” here is a state vector of the rest of the universe, the magnitude being
signiﬁcant.) What is the present observer to make of this? The experience states in
the non-zero components must describe possible experiences of the observer at the
future time t. No one of them is singled out as being what the observer actually will
experience at that time. Some of them, though, loom larger than others, according
to the magnitudes of their coeﬃcients in the universal state vector.
I found this rather startling when I ﬁrst encountered it. I was used to thinking
that there is something awaiting me in the future, even if I cannot know what it is,
and even if there is no law of nature which determines what it is. Whatever will be
will be, indeed. But Aristotle already saw that this is wrong. A statement about the
future, in general, cannot be actually true, even when we are careful to distinguish
being true from our knowing that it is true. But we can say more than that.
Aristotle pointed out that although no one statement about the future is actually
true, some of them are more likely than others. Similarly, the universal state vector at
the time t contains more information, for me, than my possible experiences at time
t. These experience states, occurring as components of the universal state vector,
contribute to it to diﬀerent extents, measured by the magnitudes of their coeﬃcients.

156
A. Sudbery
Such magnitudes are usually used in quantum mechanics to calculate probabilities.
So we can understand the future universal state as giving information, not only about
what experiences are possible for me at that future time, but also about how probable
each experience is.
The nature of probability is a long-standing philosophical problem [9], to which
scientists also need an answer. Many scientists take the view that the probability of
an event only makes sense when there are many repetitions of the circumstances in
which the event might occur, and we count up the number of times that it does occur;
they hold that the probability of a single, unrepeated event does not make sense. But
what we have just outlined does seem to be a calculation of a single event at a time
which will only come once. In everyday life we often talk about the probability that
something will happen on just one occasion—that it will rain tomorrow, or that a
particular horse will win a race, or that there will be a sea-battle. A standard view
of such single-event probability is that it refers to the strength of the belief of the
person who is asserting the probability, and can be measured by the betting odds
they are prepared to oﬀer on the event happening. But the probability described in
the previous paragraph is an objective fact about the universe. It has nothing to do
with the beliefs of an individual, not even the individual whose experiences are in
question; that individual is being told a fact about their future experiences, whether
they believe it or not. What does this probability mean?
The probability that I will have a particular experience tomorrow—that I will
see the cat alive, for example—arose in the context that there is no fact about what
experience I will have tomorrow; the statement “I will see a living cat” is neither true
nor false. In logical terms, its truth value is neither 1 nor 0. But if the probability of
this experience is close to 1, the statement is nearly true; if it close to 0, the statement
is nearly false. This suggests that the truth value of the statement should be identiﬁed
with its probability, and that this tells us what the probability of a single event means.
The probability of a future event is the truth value of the future-tense proposition that
that event will happen. This view of probability, and the associated many-valued
logic of tensed propositions, has been explored in [10].
It has now become clear that the universal state vector plays very diﬀerent roles
in the two perspectives, external and internal. From the external perspective, it is
a full description of reality; it tells how the universe is constituted at a particular
time. This complete reality can be analysed with respect to any sentient system as
in (12.2), yielding a number of components, attached to diﬀerent experiences of the
chosen sentient system, which are all parts of the universal reality. From the internal
perspective of this system, however, reality consists of just one of these experiences;
the component attached to this experience is the complete truth about the universe for
the sentient system. All the other non-zero components are things that might have
happened, but didn’t. The role of the universal state vector at a later time, in this
perspective, is not to describe how the universe will be at that time, but to specify
how the present state of the universe might change between now and then. It gives a
list of possibilities at that later time, with a probability for each of them that it will
become the truth.

12
The Future’s Not Ours to See
157
It might seem that we can at least know these probabilities for the future, being
able to calculate them from our certain knowledge of our present experience, using
the Schrödinger equation. But even this is uncertain. Our present experience could
well be only part of the universal state, and it is the whole universal state vector that
must be put into the calculation of future probabilities. Those things that might have
happened, but didn’t, some of which we don’t even know about, might still aﬀect
the future. This is a further limit to human knowledge. However, if those things
are suﬃciently diﬀerent from our actual experience on a macroscopic scale, then
quantum theory assures us that the eﬀect they might have on the future is so small
as to be utterly negligible. This consequence of the theory is known as decoherence.
Human knowledge of the future, therefore, is limited in a fundamental way. It is
not that there are true facts but the knowledge of them is not accessible to us; there are
no facts out there, and there is simply no certain knowledge to be had. Nevertheless,
there are facts with partial degrees of truth, and our knowledge of them is itself
partial. Our best knowledge of the future can only be probable.

Hermann Weyl’s Space-Time Geometry
and Its Impact on Theories
of Fundamental Interactions
Norbert Straumann
Abstract One of the major developments of twentieth century physics has been the
gradual recognition that a common feature of the known fundamental interactions
is their gauge structure. In this essay the early history of gauge theory is reviewed,
emphasizing primarily Weyl’s seminal contributions of 1918 and 1929, that origi-
nated in a new concept of space-time.
13.1
Introduction
In this contribution we ﬁrst sketch in a non-technical manner Hermann Weyl’s
early attempt to unify gravitation and electromagnetism by extending the space-time
structure of general relativity (GR). Einstein admired Weyl’s theory as “a coup of
genius of the ﬁrst rate...”, but immediately realized that it was physically untenable:
“Although your idea is so beautiful, I have to declare frankly that, in my opinion, it
is impossible that the theory corresponds to nature.” This led to an intense exchange
of letters between Einstein (in Berlin) and Weyl (at the ETH in Zürich), which is now
published in The Collected Papers of Einstein [1]. No agreement was reached, but
Einstein’s intuition proved to be right.
Although Weyl’s attempt was a failure as a physical theory it paved the way for
the correct understanding of what is called gauge invariance, a central symmetry
principle of modern physics. Weyl himself re-interpreted his original theory after
the advent of quantum theory in a seminal paper [2].
Before coming to a description of Wey’s ﬁrst paper early in 1918 [3], we have to
indicate Einstein’s great step from Special Relativity (SR) to GR, in which a com-
pletely novel geometrical understanding of gravity was reached.

From Minkowski’s Space-Time to the Dynamic
Space-Time of General Relativity
The ﬁrst four of his ﬁve papers from March to June of Einstein’ annus mirabilis 1905
were announced in a letter to his friend and member of the Olympia Academy Conrad
Habicht. About the fourth paper Einstein writes: [This] “is only a rough draft at this
point, and is an electrodynamics of moving bodies which employs a modiﬁcation of
the theory of space and time.” This work, soon called relativity theory, attracted also
the great mathematician Hermann Minkowski, one of Einstein’s teachers at ETH in
Zürich. In September 1908, during the annual meeting of the German association
of Scientists and Physicians in Cologne, Hermann Minkowski presented a transpar-
ent geometric interpretation of Einstein’s modiﬁcation of space and time. This far
reaching conception began with the famous sentences: “The views of space and time
which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics,
and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time
by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of
the two will preserve an independent reality.”
The structure of this union is close to that of a 4-dimensional Euclidean space,
with one crucial diﬀerence: From school days we are all familiar with the Euclid-
ean plane, and learned the theorem of Pythagoras, which implies that the distance
between two points can be represented as a sum of two squares. In Minkowski’s
space-time the distance between two localized events is a sum of three squares
minus one square, corresponding to a temporal direction. For this reason we say
that this space-time geometry is pseudo-Euclidean. For sometime Einstein consid-
ered Minkowski’s 4-dimensional geometry as “superﬁcial learnedness” and once
wrote to a colleague: “Since the mathematicians have grabbed hold of the theory of
relativity, I myself no longer understand it.” We shall see that a few years later he
changed this opinion.
With the completion of SR, Newton’s theory of gravity had to be changed, because
the Newtonian law of gravitational attraction is an action -at-a-distance law. We know
from later recollections by Einstein that he was soon convinced that gravitation has
no place in the framework of SR. In the course of a slow process he arrived at the
hypothesis that the rigid pseudo-Euclidean metric of Minkowski had to be gener-
alized to a dynamical ﬁeld, subject to laws, analogous to what was known from
electromagnetism. The physical metric ﬁeld implies that space-time is curved and
that it inﬂuences and is being inﬂuenced by all other physical processes, for instance
the motion of stars. Einstein ﬁnally found the laws of this two-sided interactions, in
particular ﬁeld equations which determine the generation of gravitational ﬁelds by
material sources of all kind.—This is not the place to say more about this greatest
contribution of Einstein, called general relativity theory, that the world celebrated in
November 2015—100 years after Einstein’s completion of the theory.
This essay was begun just a few days after the announcement that gravitational
waves (ripples of the metric ﬁeld) had been recorded, that were created in the coales-
cence of two black holes of about 30 solar masses. In such processes the dynamical
nature of space-time in GR is particularly impressive.

13.3
The Quest for Uniﬁcation
After Einstein had reached his goal of a successful relativistic theory of gravity,
he began to think about the remaining arbitrariness of the new theoretical frame-
work. One of these was the separate existence of gravitation and electromagnetism.
According to his views, they had to be uniﬁed. Furthermore, GR did not impose
any restrictions on the properties of matter. The mass and charge of the electron and
proton, and why there were (at the time) no other particle in nature, appeared to be
arbitrary. A major goal of a uniﬁed theory was to explain the existence and properties
of matter. This search was Einstein’s main pursuit for more than half of his scientiﬁc
life, without real success.
A ﬁrst very interesting uniﬁcation attempt was put forward by another great ﬁgure,
namely Hermann Weyl. Before we come to this, it should be said, that before GR was
born Weyl was exclusively occupied with central problems in pure mathematics. But
with Einstein’s new theory of gravity he became very interested in GR. He wrote
the ﬁrst systematic presentation of the theory with the title “Space-Time-Matter”
(STM) [4], after his lectures on the subject in the Summer Term of 1917 at ETH in
Zürich. In the preface of the ﬁrst (now seven) edition he wrote: “At the same time
it was my wish to present this great subject as an illustration of the intermingling
of philosophical, mathematical, and physical thought, a study which is dear to my
heart.” He continued with: “But I have not been able to satisfy these self-imposing
requirements: the mathematician predominates at the expense of the philosopher.”
Such books are not written any more.
STM fascinated me enormously during the ﬁrst semesters of my studies at ETH.
The preface begins with “Einstein’s Theory of Relativity has advanced our ideas
of the structure of the cosmos a step further. It is as if a wall which separated us
from Truth has collapsed. Wider expanses and greater depths are now exposed to
the searching eye of knowledge, regions of which we had not even a presentiment.”
Unfortunately, I never saw Hermann Weyl; he died in Zürich during my ﬁrst
semester in fall of 1955.

Weyl’s Attempt to Unify Gravitation
and Electromagnetism
On the 1st of March 1918 Weyl writes in a letter to Einstein: “These days I suc-
ceeded, as I believe, to derive electricity and gravitation from a common source...”.
Einstein’s prompt reaction by postcard indicates already a physical objection which
he explained in detail shortly afterwards. Before we come to this we indicate the
main ideas of Weyl’s theory of 1918 [3].

13.4.1
Weyl’s Generalization of Riemannian Geometry
Weyl’s starting point was purely mathematical. He felt a certain uneasiness about
Riemannian geometry,1 as is clearly expressed by the following sentences early in
his paper:
But in Riemannian geometry described above there is contained a last element of geometry
“at a distance” (ferngeometrisches Element)—with no good reason, as far as I can see; it
is due only to the accidental development of Riemannian geometry from Euclidean geom-
etry. The metric allows the two magnitudes of two vectors to be compared, not only at the
same point, but at any arbitrarily separated points. A true inﬁnitesimal geometry should,
however, recognize only a principle for transferring the magnitude of a vector to an inﬁni-
tesimally close point and then, on transfer to an arbitrary distant point, the integrability of
the magnitude of a vector is no more to be expected than the integrability of its direction.
After these remarks Weyl turns to physical speculation and continues as follows:
On the removal of this inconsistency there appears a geometry that, surprisingly, when
applied to the world, explains not only the gravitational phenomena but also the electri-
cal. According to the resultant theory both spring from the same source, indeed in general
one cannot separate gravitation and electromagnetism in a unique manner. In this theory all
physical quantities have a world geometrical meaning; the action appears from the begin-
ning as a pure number. It leads to an essentially unique universal law; it even allows us to
understand in a certain sense why the world is four-dimensional.
For certain readers the following few technical explanations may be useful. (A
detailed description can be found in [5].) In contrast to GR Weyl’s geometry is
equipped not with one, but a class [g] of conformally equivalent metrics This corre-
sponds to the requirement that it should only be possible to compare lengths at one
and the same world point. In addition, the theory contains also a class of vector ﬁelds
[A]. A crucial property is that substitutions of the form
g ↦e2𝜆g,
A ↦A −d𝜆,
(13.1)
where 𝜆is an arbitrary smooth space-time function, do not change the geometry.
Pairs (g, A) related by (13.1) are considered to be equivalent. In Weyl’s application
to physics, they leave the physical laws unchanged. These transformations, called
gauge transformations, play a central role. The ﬁrst of the substitutions is interpreted
by Weyl as a diﬀerent choice of calibration (or gauge). This is accompanied by the
substitution of the vector ﬁeld A, a transformation physicists know since the 19th
century from electrodynamics.
1This is the geometry based on the metric ﬁeld of GR, that provides the mathematical tools for Ein-
stein’s theory of gravity. Einstein learned this (relatively new) mathematics from his friend Marcel
Grossmann, who was professor for mathematics at ETH. The two colleagues had from summer
1912 to spring 1914 a very fruitful collaboration, in which they came close to the ﬁnal theory.

13
Hermann Weyl’s Space-Time Geometry and Its Impact ...
163
13.4.2
Electromagnetism and Gravitation
Turning to physics, Weyl assumes that his “purely inﬁnitesimal geometry” describes
the structure of space-time and consequently he requires that physical laws should
satisfy a double-invariance: 1. They must be invariant with respect to arbitrary
smooth coordinate transformations. 2. They must be gauge invariant, i.e., invariant
with respect to substitutions (13.1) for an arbitrary smooth function 𝜆.
Nothing is more natural to Weyl, than identifying A with the vector potential and
F = dA with the ﬁeld strength of electromagnetism.
Independent of the precise form of the action Weyl shows that in his theory gauge
invariance implies the conservation of electric charge in much the same way as gen-
eral coordinate invariance leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. This
beautiful connection pleased him particularly: “...[it] seems to me to be the strongest
general argument in favour of the present theory—insofar as it is permissible to talk
of justiﬁcation in the context of pure speculation.” Similar structural connections
hold also in modern gauge theories.
13.4.3
Einstein’s Objection
After this sketch of Weyl’s theory we come to Einstein’s striking counterargument
which he ﬁrst communicated to Weyl by postcard. The problem is that if the idea
of a nonintegrable length connection (scale factor) is correct, then the behaviour
of clocks would depend on their history. Consider two identical atomic clocks in
adjacent world points and bring them along diﬀerent world trajectories which meet
again in adjacent world points. Then their frequencies would generally diﬀer. This
is in clear contradiction with empirical evidence, in particular with the existence of
stable atomic spectra. Einstein therefore concludes:
...(if) one drops the connection of the metric to the measurement of distance and time, then
relativity looses all its empirical basis.
The author has described the intense and instructive subsequent correspondence
between Weyl and Einstein elsewhere [6]. As an example, we quote from one of the
last letters of Weyl to Einstein:
This [insistence] irritates me of course, because experience has proven that one can rely on
your intuition; so little convincing your counter arguments seem to me, as I have to admit...
By the way, you should not believe that I was driven to introduce the linear diﬀerential form
in addition to the quadratic one by physical reasons. I wanted, just to the contrary, to get rid
of this ‘methodological inconsistency (Inkonsequenz)’ which has been a stone of contention
to me already much earlier. And then, to my surprise, I realized that it looks as if it might
explain electricity. You clap your hands above your head and shout: But physics is not made
this way! (Weyl to Einstein 10.12.1918).

13.5
Weyl’s 1929 Classic: “Electron and Gravitation”
Shortly before his death late in 1955, Weyl wrote for his Selecta [7] a postscript to
his early attempt in 1918 to construct a ‘uniﬁed ﬁeld theory’. There he expressed his
deep attachment to the gauge idea and adds (p. 192):
Later the quantum-theory introduced the Schrödinger-Dirac potential 𝜓of the electron-
positron ﬁeld; it carried with it an experimentally-based principle of gauge-invariance which
guaranteed the conservation of charge, and connected the 𝜓with the electromagnetic poten-
tials 𝜙i in the same way that my speculative theory had connected the gravitational potentials
gik with the 𝜙i, and measured the 𝜙i in known atomic, rather than unknown cosmological
units. I have no doubt but that the correct context for the principle of gauge-invariance is
here and not, as I believed in 1918, in the intertwining of electromagnetism and gravity.
This re-interpretation was developed by Weyl in one of the great papers of the
twentieth century [8]. Weyl’s classic does not only give a very clear formulation of
the gauge principle, but contains, in addition, several other important concepts and
results.
Much of Weyl’s paper penetrated also into his classic book “The Theory of
Groups and Quantum Mechanics” [8]. There he mentions also the transformation
of his early gauge-theoretic ideas: “This principle of gauge invariance is quite anal-
ogous to that previously set up by the author, on speculative grounds, in order to
arrive at a uniﬁed theory of gravitation and electricity. But I now believe that this
gauge invariance does not tie together electricity and gravitation, but rather elec-
tricity and matter.”
Many years later, Weyl summarized this early tortuous history of gauge theory in
an instructive letter [9] to the Swiss writer and Einstein biographer Seelig [9], which
we reproduce in an English translation.
The ﬁrst attempt to develop a uniﬁed ﬁeld theory of gravitation and electromagnetism dates
to 1918, in which I added the principle of gauge-invariance to that of coordinate invariance.
I myself have long since abandoned this theory in favour of its correct interpretation: gauge-
invariance as a principle that connects electromagnetism not with gravitation but with the
wave-ﬁeld of the electron. —Einstein was against it [the original theory] from the beginning,
and this led to many discussions. I thought that I could answer his concrete objections. In
the end he said “Well, Weyl, let us leave it at that! In such a speculative manner, without
any guiding physical principle, one cannot make Physics.” Today one could say that in this
respect we have exchanged our points of view. Einstein believes that in this ﬁeld [Gravita-
tion and Electromagnetism] the gap between ideas and experience is so wide that only the
path of mathematical speculation, whose consequences must, of course, be developed and
confronted with experiment, has a chance of success. Meanwhile my own conﬁdence in pure
speculation has diminished, and I see a need for a closer connection with quantum-physics
experiments, since in my opinion it is not suﬃcient to unify Electromagnetism and Grav-
ity. The wave-ﬁelds of the electron and whatever other irreducible elementary particles may
appear must also be included.

Matter, Space, Time, and Motion: A Uniﬁed
Gravitational Perspective
C.S. Unnikrishnan
Abstract This article explores the links between space, time, matter and its motion
in the essential context of the universe they constitute. Conventional and standard
physics maintains a nearly dismissive separation between dynamics and the matter-
ﬁlled universe and indeed between cosmic matter and a priori space-time while
asserting their mutual inﬂuence in other physical situations through the Einstein
equations of general relativity. This can be traced to the incompatibility between
the special theory of relativity that rejects a preferred frame and the real situation
of a single matter-ﬁlled universe in which observers in diﬀerent states of motion
have measurably diﬀerent experiences. We will argue that the present position can-
not be maintained consistent with empirical and physico-logical evidence. The his-
torical fact that all our fundamental theories were formulated and completed before
we acquired signiﬁcant and crucial knowledge about the matter content of the uni-
verse and its gravity is contrasted with the unavoidable situation that all our empirical
experience and dynamics happens in the presence of all other matter in the universe.
A careful analysis leads to a new and necessary paradigm in which several of our
notions and even fundamental theories involving space, time and matter need to be
reformulated with cosmic gravity as the determining factor. This, when combined
with some crucial experimental results, answers several open issues that have been
debated for centuries in foundational physics.

Introduction
The central theme of discussion in this paper is the relation between matter and
dynamics and its physical description. Hence we have to deal with the action of
matter on matter and two essential elements in the backdrop, albeit their emergent
nature, are space and time. They are emergent because they are part of our expe-
rience only in the ambience of sensible matter. There is no way to prove that they
are a priori and independent of matter. There is not even a way to prove that they

exist except as relational entities. However, modern theoretical physics, especially
the theories of relativity, treat them as a priori physical entities, ontologically prior
and independent of matter, with an existence of their own. Their status in physics has
evolved considerably, but this evolution is not in the direction that solves the funda-
mental problems that arose in the ﬁrst place, in the context of the formal discussion
of space and time in Newton’s Principia and in its critiques. I hope to address these
very issues and come to deﬁnite conclusions here. I will in fact argue that we are
stuck in square one with regard to the question of the ontological status of space and
time as physical entities due to the single important reason that we have ignored the
matter-ﬁlled universe and its gravity in our ‘completed’ and ‘well-tested’ fundamen-
tal theories. The streak of inner wisdom that could have been integrated into modern
physics starting from the Machian speculation on the origin of inertia and his critique
on the physical reality of space have been ignored with serious implications to the
very basis of modern physics, its consistency, general applicability, and its philoso-
phy. The situation can be saved only by a paradigm change in which space and time
are fully compatible with matter. The core issue is the incompatibility between the
real gravitationally dominant and hence physically preferred cosmic frame, with its
universal time providing an explicit reference for the state of ‘rest’, and the prevalent
concept of a relativistic space and time in modern physics that rejects the physical
prominence of any preferred frame. What is urgent then is to pay attention to logical
consistency and empirical evidence with rigour, avoiding over-interpretations and
focusing on the very postulates on which our fundamental theories are built. This
results in a new theory in which dynamics and relativity and gravitational conse-
quences of the matter-energy in the universe and the cosmic frame playing the role
of an absolute frame for motion and time, all fully consistent with the totality of
empirical evidence.
It is natural in physical vision that what is absolutely transparent remains invisi-
ble. But in the realm of ideas and insights the situation should be exactly the opposite.
For the logical inner eye, a crystal clear evidence should form the basis a theoretical
construction. Yet, it is a disturbing revelation that all of modern physics continue to
base its fundamental postulates on empty space and associated abstract time, albeit
modiﬁable, in spite of our mature knowledge that all physical processes and dynam-
ics happens in the presence of vast amount of matter and its integrated gravity in
a gigantic universe with no empty space. The interaction energy between the earth
and us (or any body) is only a billionth of that between us and the rest of the matter
in the universe. Yet, our experience misses out on cognition of this interaction, and
this has reﬂected in how we formulate and accept our theories of physics.
All our fundamental theories were formulated and completed well before we had
any signiﬁcant knowledge about the matter and its extent in the universe, and hence
with the nonexistent ‘empty space’ as their arena. The consistency of this paradigm
is taken for granted, because of our physical insensitivity to enormous gravitational
potentials of the vast amounts of matter in the Universe and also because of appar-
ent agreement with empirical evidence. However, all experimental tests of any of

14

169
our theories are always done in the presence of vast amounts of cosmic matter and
its gravity, and if cosmic gravity had any eﬀect on dynamics and time, we certainly
have missed it in our fundamental theories. To stress this point, one may note that the
totality of empirical experience unavoidably contains any eﬀect of cosmic gravity,
whereas the theories explicitly assume that such eﬀects are negligible, because the
theories were constructed before we knew about the universe. It is logically imper-
ative that all physical theories dealing with space, time and motion, in particular for
theories of dynamics and relativity, need to incorporate cosmic matter and gravity
in the theory to the extent they have genuine and observable physical eﬀects. That
this is essential is not merely an issue of being logically consistent, but being empir-
ically rigorous, as we shall prove. With this, our notions of space and time also will
naturally need revision because the cosmic gravitational frame assumes the role of a
preferred ‘absolute’ frame and hence compatible notions of space and time inherits
the same features.
Perceptions of space and time are always in association with matter; otherwise
space and time are unobservables. Dynamical space is abstracted out of separation
or interval between discernible matter. Time, in all cases imaginable, is in fact just
motion (evolution) of matter in a generalized sense and not a separate dimension.
Motion in space is then naturally motion in the presence of matter, distributed as
the universe itself. We will see that the conventional ontology of space and time in
modern physics does not go beyond being metaphysical. However, this being at the
very foundation of the theories of relativity and gravity, we need to carefully exam-
ine how a changed perspective modiﬁes standard physics itself, which is considered
robust. A new paradigm has to defend itself while being consistent with all empiri-
cal features of the old view. Rejection of unobservable space and time in favour of
a universe deﬁned by its matter content and gravity not only demands new physics,
but also brings back the idea of absolute space and time in place of Einstein’s rela-
tive space-time, all tied rigorously and consistently with the special reference frame
determined by cosmic matter.
In such a paradigm, which I call cosmic relativity [1, 2], there is indeed a preferred
gravitational frame of the universe, with its unmistakable and incontestable physical
reality. An ontologically and logically robust framework and theory of space, time,
matter and dynamics naturally emerges with the preferred cosmic frame as refer-
ence for motion, and a universally synchronizable time, and yet consistent with all
known empirical results. All relativistic eﬀects and the law of dynamics itself are
derived as gravitational eﬀects of matter in the universe and therefore I call the cos-
mic frame as the ‘determinant frame’, to indicate a deeper meaning than ‘preferred
frame’. Obviously, the relative velocity of light then has to be Galilean, and this is
where the new theory goes well beyond anything that have been attempted in the
Machian spirit (a factual experimental situation which conﬁrms this is discussed in
Appendix E). This will of course go beyond what we accept as a standard theory
of motion and relativity, and key empirical tests where the conventional theory fails
will be highlighted. The strength of cosmic relativity is its experimental support.
Machian speculation cannot be taken forward and implemented without a preferred

170
C.S. Unnikrishnan
and privileged role for the cosmic gravitational frame and this is precisely why Ein-
stein’s general theory of relativity remained non-Machian, with no explanation for
inertia or pseudo-forces. This paradigm then demands a modiﬁed Einstein’s equation
for gravity that includes cosmic matter as a permanent feature in the equation itself,
with the advantage of being Machian and fully consistent with experimental tests,
devoid of pseudo-forces. In such a framework, causality and locality are supreme
and speculations of nonlocality, as in quantum entanglement, have no place. With
inconsistencies and paradoxes that worried philosophers of science eliminated, the
physical theory reclaims its rightful position in natural philosophy.
14.2
The Standard Scenario
The general theory of relativity (GTR) is the standard theory of gravity in which it
deals with space, time and matter in an integrated way. It is built on just two founda-
tional pillars, one is the special theory of relativity (STR) and the other the Einstein
equivalence principle. STR rejects any notion of absolute rest and its fundamental
mathematical structure involves boost transformations that preserves the isotropy
and homogeneity of empty space and time. In fact, only empty space can remain
isotropic in all inertial frames and therefore STR is a false start in a matter-ﬁlled
universe, the only one known. One special feature of STR is that no physical rea-
son (inﬂuence) is ascribable to relativistic changes, like time dilation of a relatively
moving clock. The foundation for GTR is the Einstein equivalence principle that gen-
eralizes the equivalence of the inertial and gravitational mass and asserts the local
equivalence of a uniform gravitational ﬁeld ⃗g and an accelerated frame with accel-
eration ⃗a = −⃗g. GTR does not seek the physical reason for the empirically observed
validity of the equivalence principle in either form. It merely assumes it as a funda-
mental postulate consistent with precision experiments. The most interesting aspect,
in the context of this article, of basing the theory on such a principle is that grav-
ity is treated as equivalent to a pseudo-force. Therefore, the theory goes against its
announced inspiration of Machian ideas on banishing pseudo-forces from physics.
In some sense it is ironical that the GTR that gave rise to modern cosmology is
ﬁrmly built on the idea of empty space and a matter ﬁlled cosmos in just one of
the solutions of Einstein’s equations. This indeed is the statement that GTR does not
incorporate the Mach’s conjecture concerning the Newtonian pseudo-forces [3]. The
non-gravitational inertial forces retain their pseudo-status even within GTR.
The great improvement from Newton’s absolute space to Einstein’s space-time is
that matter-energy modiﬁes the spatio-temporal relations and thus acts on space and
time and the behaviour of clocks and trajectories are in turn modiﬁed by the modi-
ﬁed space and time. The GTR does not get rid of the Newtonian space with its own
physical ontology and reality. It just makes it modiﬁable by the presence of matter.
However, it does not make any diﬀerence if we say that space is modiﬁed and there-
fore all motion are aﬀected, or that there are gravitational ﬁelds that aﬀect length
and time standards. It is in fact an over-interpretation to insist that space and time

14
Matter, Space, Time, and Motion: A Uniﬁed Gravitational Perspective
171
are modiﬁed by the presence of matter because that statement is untestable. What can
be tested is whether relative distances between material particles change and whether
material clocks at diﬀerent positions have diﬀerent rates. The only observables asso-
ciated with space and time are spatial and temporal intervals of binary events marked
by matter, including clocks. The two kinds of intervals (distance and duration) are to
be measured individually and a space-time interval, if created by combining them,
is a synthetic concept. Geometry is the set of relations on distances and durations.
If matter in free motion is taken as reference, their trajectories are modiﬁed in the
presence of other matter. So, are the rates of clocks. The modiﬁcation of distances
and durations in the presence of matter alter the geometric relations, and this is con-
ventionally called the modiﬁcation of the geometry of space-time, whereas in real-
ity modiﬁcations refer to the geometrical relations between separations of material
points and durations of material clocks. Because the modiﬁcations of intervals are
independent of the properties of matter, as embodied in the equivalence principle,
one may drop reference to speciﬁc matter and work legitimately with dynamics in
the modiﬁed geometry of space-time.
However, it is important to understand that the relation between geometry and
matter as speciﬁed by the Einstein’s equations of GTR, equating components of
‘curvature’ of space and time to the components of energy-momentum of matter,
merely relates how spatial and temporal intervals deﬁned by matter vary in rela-
tion to other matter, in the presence of matter. Both the mathematical relation and a
prescription of measurements to test the relations involve only material trajectories
and clocks. The conventional interpretation of the ‘left-hand side’ of the equations
involving the concept of a physical and malleable space-time independent of mat-
ter is just a multi-layer synthetic convenience. Instead of seeing gravity as action of
matter on matter, sandwiching the metaphysical space and time as the dynamical
entities, both of which have no gravitational charge whatsoever (mass or energy), is
an over-interpretation, albeit being very convenient and useful mathematically, and
consistent because of the equivalence principle.
All the modern developments from dynamics to cosmology relied on the theories
of relativity. In fact, the construction of cosmology became possible only because
of the structure of GTR that linked matter and space-time trajectories in a way that
did not need dealing with forces and bounded mass distributions. One could explore
how the ‘metric’ of space and time evolved, which in turn determined how mat-
ter distributions evolved and an entire consistent picture emerged. However, these
very developments bring out deep questions of logical consistency that are power-
ful enough to question and shake the very foundations on which the theory is built.
This may sound surprising, to say the least, but even a superﬁcial examination of
some of the issues may be enough to persuade anybody who insist on both logical
and empirical rigour that this is indeed the case. The cosmological picture we have
today from observations turns out to be that of a preferred frame, conceptually and
practically, with its gravity determining both dynamics and relativity, and providing
the physical reason for the validity of the equivalence principle, thereby rendering
the very theory that initiated and facilitated all these studies incomplete. The uni-
verse is gravitationally self-dynamical and self-determinatory all the way down to

172
C.S. Unnikrishnan
the dynamics of its every elementary constituent. And the standard theory of gravity
does not encompass any of these features.
That this is indeed the situation in GTR is to be stressed and I quote from Ein-
stein’s Nobel lecture [4], “Already Newton recognized that the law of inertia is unsat-
isfactory in a context so far unmentioned in this exposition, namely that it gives no
real cause for the special physical position of the states of motion of the inertial
frames relative to all other states of motion... For this reason E. Mach demanded
a modiﬁcation of the law of inertia in the sense that the inertia should be inter-
preted as an acceleration resistance of the bodies against one another and not against
“space”... This interpretation is even more plausible according to general relativity
which eliminates the distinction between inertial and gravitational eﬀects. It amounts
to stipulating that, apart from the arbitrariness governed by the free choice of coordi-
nates, the g𝜇𝜈-ﬁeld shall be completely determined by the matter. Mach’s stipulation
is favoured in general relativity by the circumstance that acceleration induction in
accordance with the gravitational ﬁeld equations really exists, although of such slight
intensity that direct detection by mechanical experiments is out of the question.”
Einstein reaches so close to the real solution and misses it, proclaiming unde-
tectability of the small GTR eﬀects (as ﬁnally detected in experiments like the Grav-
ity Probe-B), because he could not incorporate the vast amounts of matter in the uni-
verse into his equations as a consistent eternal factor to determine the large cosmic
g𝜇𝜈-ﬁeld responsible for the readily observable inertial forces! In fact, he unwittingly
sacriﬁced forever his original desired program that ‘the g𝜇𝜈-ﬁeld shall be completely
determined by the matter’ by implying that space and time themselves could be grav-
itational sources, by introducing the cosmological constant.
14.3
The New Paradigm for Dynamics and Relativity
14.3.1
A Hypothetical Scenario in Electrodynamics
Imagine a situation where there is a slight charge asymmetry of less than 1 part in
1020 between the proton and electron and that atoms are slightly charged [5]. In the
pre-cosmology era, while Maxwell was completing his theory, no knowledge about
the matter content of the universe was known and such a tiny charge asymmetry in
matter known then (solar system, Milky way, a few nebulae around us and distant
stars) would not make any diﬀerence to experimentally observed features of electro-
dynamics, even if somebody cared to include the background charge in calculations.
However, the true reality would have been the enormously charged universe with a
huge electric potential generated by all the unseen charged matter, but undetectable
in all inertial experiments. In fact, for uniform motion the equations of electrody-
namics, including the Lorentz force law, would work perfectly with only local mag-
netic and electric ﬁelds included. That is because any uniform motion within the
large charged sphere creates only constant four-vector potentials and they cannot be

14
Matter, Space, Time, and Motion: A Uniﬁed Gravitational Perspective
173
locally detected. However, in situations of accelerated motion of the charge, some
extra forces would appear without any identiﬁable sources because the potentials
becomes time dependent. An extra force will be required to accelerated a particle
as if a pseudo-electric ﬁeld is acting against the acceleration of all charges. Charges
in rotation will experience pseudo-magnetic forces, and so on. A magnetic moment
in a rotating frame would feel an anomalous torque, without any identiﬁable source.
The situation would require postulating pseudo-forces in electrodynamics, propor-
tional to the electric charge and one would be faced with an electromagnetic inertia,
in addition to the usual inertia proportional to mass, forcing one to ascribe it as well
to special motion relative to ‘absolute’ space, as Newton did to discuss his ‘water in
a rotating pail’ experiment. A Machian critique would demand looking for an inter-
action involving the electric charge instead of folding one’s tails between the warm
comfort of pseudo-forces. We do not see such forces and the entire electrodynamics
is accounted for with local sources only because the matter in the universe is essen-
tially neutral. Yet, violent and irrational objections that go well beyond scientiﬁc
method are raised when it is pointed out that the origin of the observed inertial (cou-
pling to mass) pseudo-forces is indeed the gravitationally charged universe, with the
huge amount of matter around us compensating for the weakness of the gravitational
constant.
This immediately suggests that we are grossly wrong in ignoring the gravity of
the matter around us in our fundamental theories of dynamics. The gravitational
potential of just the visible matter in the universe adds up to about 108 times the
gravitational potential of the earth in a terrestrial laboratory. It is also well-known
that the Newtonian potential of a near critical-density universe is equal to the square
of the velocity of light (ΦU ≃c2), and should have been taken as the strong clue that
all of relativistic eﬀect are in fact gravitational. A phenomenological claim that all
Lorentz factors are in fact (1 −v2∕ΦU
)1∕2 and has nothing to do with velocity of light
is empirically fully defendable [1]. Motion then generates velocity dependent poten-
tials and acceleration transforms this into a time dependent potential which manifests
as a force that resists motion. The electromagnetic analogy and our present knowl-
edge about the gravitational active matter content in the universe should have been
suﬃcient to see the truth of the claim that conventional pseudo-forces are indeed
gravitational, as researchers like D. Sciama had already shown [6]. They are actually
gravito-magnetic (arising from either the curl or the time dependence of the relative
currents), but opening up to this wisdom is highly resisted without defendable rea-
sons. However, stopping there gives an incomplete and inconsistent story, rejected
several times in the past by the physics community, even though there is no empirical
or logical objection to such a calculation and demonstration. The all-important con-
sequence to realize is that such a framework also demands a preferred reference and
notion of absolute rest, and hence compatible Galilean notions of space and time and
propagation of light, which goes completely against what is accepted as the correct
physics today.

14.3.2
Physics in the Gravitationally Charged Universe
Once we anchor a theory of relativity and dynamics on the matter and gravity of the
real universe, as it is, there are no further freedom to tune any aspect of the theory of
motion. All that we know and see about motion, and evolution and modiﬁcations of
space-time intervals should follow as mere gravitational consequence of interactions
with cosmic matter. There are no additional postulates or principles to depend on.
Matter and its gravity becomes our physical priors, instead of the triad of space, time
and matter and all else should follow from it. Do they? Remarkably so!
Empty space is the same everywhere (homogeneous) and in all directions
(isotropic) for all inertial observers and the measures of spatial and temporal inter-
vals or the metric remain homogenous and isotropic in every moving frame. The
invariant isotropy is a property speciﬁc to the Lorentz transformation (LT) wherein
the metric diag {−1, 1, 1, 1} goes to diag {−1, 1, 1, 1} under motion. This is the very
basis of the special theory of relativity. The matter distribution in the universe is
more or less homogenous and isotropic on very large scales, but only for an observer
who is ‘at rest’ relative to the average matter distribution. It is clear that moving in
matter-ﬁlled universe generates a relative ﬂow of matter opposite to the motion of
the observer and this current of gravitational charge is like any other physical cur-
rent and naturally should generate physical eﬀects akin to magnetic eﬀects in elec-
tromagnetism. The current and magnetic potentials deﬁnes a direction in space and
that makes space and its metric (measuring standards) anisotropic. However, in real-
ity, motion results in anisotropy proportional to the velocity, inducing an anisotropic
metric, which is impossible with Lorentz transformations. Therefore, the real uni-
verse is maximally Lorentz violating, contrary to general belief (the truth is not
visible to two-way experiments, like the Michelson-Morley experiment or its vari-
ations, where this anisotropy cancels to ﬁrst order). The Doppler dipole anisotropy
of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) enables fairly pre-
cise determination of one’s motion relative to the cosmic frame. There is no more an
excuse to claim that uniform motion is equivalent to rest. More serious is the fact
that the monotonically decreasing temperature of the CMB provides us with a univer-
sal absolute clock and time, synchronized everywhere in the universe to a precision
better than a part in 105. This demolishes the arguments for lack of simultaneity of
spatially separated events.
Naturally, one might dismiss the deviation we are suggesting as pointless in spite
of its logical strength because the (only) testable features of Lorentz transformations,
physical eﬀects like time dilation and velocity addition law, relativistic Doppler shift
etc. all are experimentally conﬁrmed. In contrast, absolute preferred frame requires
Galilean transformations for coordinates and how can it reproduce fundamental and
everyday eﬀects like the time dilation?! Well, it turns out to be easier than one imag-
ined, as explicitly shown in the Appendix T. Galilean transformation does indeed
change the metrical measures of space and time and time coordinate picks up a

√
1 −v2∕c2, which is the time dilation, now with v as the absolute veloc-
ity. All experiments are consistent with this and one can trace the well-documented
east-west asymmetry of GPS clocks to exactly this, and also rest with a correct dis-
cussion of twin paradox etc. without raising vague and ﬂimsy arguments about non-
inertial motion etc. [7]. All other important relativistic results then follow, if we
consistently include the fact that the relative velocity of light is also Galilean, as has
been explicitly demonstrated in recent experiments (Appendix E).
14.3.3
The Complete Solution
How is the theory to be reconstructed in way that retains the agreement with all
its impressive precision tests during a century and yet compatible and consistent
with the prior background universe with so much matter and its gravity? This can
be done only by modifying the Einstein equation itself, with cosmic relativity as the
new basis and cosmic gravity incorporated into the equation as its permanent feature.
Fortunately this is easy, maintaining the Bianchi identities and the consistency with
all known experimental tests. The resulting Centenary Einstein’s equation [8, 9] is
Rik −1
2gikR −8𝜋G
c4 Tik(U) = 8𝜋G
c4 Tik
(14.1)
The extra piece on the left is the energy momentum tensor of the universe, included
as the non-removable integral part of the equation itself. Adding this term implies
universe as a preferred frame. We have avoided the cosmological constant term delib-
erately.
Then, laws of motion emerge as a gravitational consequence of cosmic matter.
Exactly the same physical reason then leads us to the principle of relativity, rela-
tivistic modiﬁcation of duration and separation, and to foundations of the theory
of gravity itself, forming one inseparable self-determined physical system. Dynam-
ics acquires a new meaning and even content, purging pseudo-forces and cause-
less eﬀects of motional relativity, from physical theory. This of course regains
the “absolute” and there is indeed preferred space, deﬁned by cosmic matter, and
absolute universal time, synchronized all over the universe, and even practically
available as a universal clock in the slowly decreasing temperature of the microwave
background radiation. The price to pay is the abolition of untested beliefs, like the
invariance of relative one-way velocity of light, held sacred for over a century. Yet,
such a framework is remarkably consistent with all empirical evidence, contrary to
what one might naively expect. After a century, we again have harmony between
philosopher’s time and physicist’s time, and indeed modern common mans’ time.

176
C.S. Unnikrishnan
14.3.4
Matter, Dynamics and Relativity
Here we summarize the relation between matter, dynamics and relativity, as sup-
ported by empirical evidence and logical consistency. In terms of a causal structure,
we conclude that space is not a causal primary element for dynamics or relativity.
Both dynamics and relativistic eﬀects pertains to change in physical states of mat-
ter and requires a fundamental interaction as the cause. Any theoretical paradigm
that does not identify and include the physical interaction responsible for physical
changes has to be considered tentative and incomplete. It is in fact straightforward to
derive the laws of dynamics, like the Newton’s equation of motion, and relativistic
modiﬁcation of spatial and temporal measures (metric) in frames moving relative
to the matter in the universe as due to direct gravitational interaction and since the
matter content in the universe is known to good accuracy now, there is no ambiguity
about these relations. Hence, all motional relativistic eﬀects are gravitational eﬀects,
arising entirely because the gravitational potentials in a moving frame are diﬀerent
from those in a frame at rest in the cosmic frame.
14.3.5
Matter, Space and Time
Now we are in a position to reassess the notion of space and time that is consistent
with gravitationally active matter in this universe. First conclusion is of course that
there is indeed physical justiﬁcation for notion of absolute rest, absolute velocity and
universally synchronized time with the matter-frame of the universe as the preferred
frame. Prevalent notions of space and time in modern physics is undefendable, log-
ically and empirically. Space and time are not physical entities by themselves and
are just convenient proxy elements that represent the features of the gravitational
properties of the underlying matter distributions. The most important conclusion for
physics is that the space-time is Galilean in the coordinate transformational sense and
then spatial intervals and durations correctly show second order relativistic modiﬁ-
cations in motion with the absolute velocity as the deciding factor in the Lorentz-
Larmour formulae. This has been now demonstrated in a number of experiments
(Appendix E).
14.3.6
Universe and Its Space and Time
The expansion dynamics of the universe itself, with a history of over 10 billion years,
is not really visible in the four hundred years of dynamics and relativity in physics.
Yet, we need to mention it because of the current thinking that it is the expansion
of space that is manifesting as the observed recession of matter from matter in the
universe, rather than the real motion of matter. The pictures are equivalent in all

14
Matter, Space, Time, and Motion: A Uniﬁed Gravitational Perspective
177
respects and insisting on one and denying the other as invalid is arbitrary. The picture
of expansion of space also requires that compound matter like atoms do not expand
with space, whereas ‘nearly free’ matter like galaxies expand with the space. So, the
present picture is a mixture of notions in which an expandable space takes with it
‘embedded matter’, as if in a solid expanding framework, while allowing matter to
move through it freely, as if in a frictionless ﬂuid. Also, as we mentioned earlier,
endowing space and time (metric) with properties that make them equivalent to a
source of gravity by adding a cosmological constant term to Einstein’s equations is a
retrograde step in Machian view. We believe that the current physical interpretation
of the expansion dynamics of the universe will change eventually, in favour of motion
of matter determined by matter, instead of expansion of the abstract physical space.
14.4
Philosophers’s Space and Time
A new agenda for dealing with the two fundamental encompassing entities for
physics, space and time, was indicated by logical positivists in the 20th century.
Reichenbach asserted that the philosophy of space and time is essentially the phi-
losophy concerning relativity (theories). O. Neurath, a prominent philosopher of
the Vienna circle wrote [10], “Although what is called philosophical speculation
is undoubtedly on the decline, many of the practically minded have not yet freed
themselves from a method of reasoning, which, in the last analysis, has its roots
in theology and metaphysics. No science which pretends to be exact can accept an
untested theory or doctrine; yet even in an exact science there is often an admixture
of magic, theology and philosophy. It is one of the tasks of our time to aid scientiﬁc
reasoning to attain its goal without hindrance...
Physics has been successfully purged of metaphysical formulas. For example, the
conception of ‘absolute motion’ has been discarded, a conception which acquired
meaning only if one thought of ‘absolute space’ as a gigantic glass case in which
‘coordinates’ were woven like spider webs so that it became possible to determine
whether a body is at absolute rest or whether it is moving about within the case. The
Mach-Einstein conception dispenses with this ‘absolute space’...”
However, it turns out that facts contradict what the logical positivists favoured.
Our discussion (and the reasoning and empirical evidence mentioned in the appen-
dix) clearly demand the return of the absolute into the core of physics and the phi-
losophy of physics has to respond in a logically consistent manner. Given the cosmic
markers, accurately represented by the cosmic microwave background, nobody can
assert the equivalence of rest and motion. Also, the temperature is monotonically
decreasing, as has been for billions of years, and provides a universal time that is
everywhere same in the universe to high accuracy. A local clock of any nature can
be synchronized to the locally measured averaged temperature of the background
and will read the same time as any other clock anywhere else. The new paradigm
with clear ontological priority for matter-energy and its gravity and an emergent and

178
C.S. Unnikrishnan
interpretational space and time is not just a philosophically complete and satisfac-
tory world view; it provides a complete derivation and understanding of dynamics
as entirely gravitational.
14.5
Summary
By recognizing and incorporating the gravitational inﬂuence of all the matter-energy
in the universe in dynamics and relativity, we have completed the theory of dynamics
and relativity in a way that integrates Galileo, Newton, Mach and Einstein, solving
the outstanding problems related to inertia, pseudo-forces, equivalence principle,
principle of relativity and propagation of light. The only consistent paradigm has the
matter-ﬁlled universe as the preferred absolute frame and Einstein equations of gen-
eral theory of relativity is modiﬁed to incorporate this feature. All relativistic eﬀects
and laws of dynamics are gravitational and the notions of space and time is linked and
inseparable from the cosmic frame, providing an ‘absolute’ and universally synchro-
nized reference for motion and time, which is the determinant gravitational frame for
all of physics.
Appendix T
Here we summarize the essential theoretical results [1, 2, 8, 11], outlining the
derivations that support the arguments in the paper. The conventional description
of the properties of space and time under motion is contained in the Lorentz trans-
formations (LT). This rejects Galilean relativity and replaces it with invariance of
the homogeneity and isotropy of space. However this can be maintained only in
empty space. Empty space is isotropic and homogenous and remains so in every
moving frame. So, LT that keeps the isotropic and homogenous metric invariant is
the valid description of motional transformations only in the nonexistent metaphys-
ical empty space. The real space has matter—the charge of gravity—at an average
density of 10−29 g/cc, which becomes a ‘current’ of the charge of gravity in every
moving frame. Space becomes anisotropic with this ﬂow, a physical vector potential
proportional to velocity (which is in fact a part of the full 10-component symmetric
tensor), Ai∕c = g0i = vi∕c is generated, but LT cannot accommodate this anisotropy
(see Fig. 14.1). Note that a similar electromagnetic vector potential would have been
generated if the universe were slightly electrically charged. Not only the geometrical
features, but also the ‘transformational features’ of space and time are to be deter-
mined by the matter around.
This is all we need to see the solution to the age-old problem of pseudo-forces,
inertia etc., and the real source of relativistic eﬀects. The fact that there are no
locally measurable physical eﬀects of a constant vector potential ﬁeld is then the

Motion converts a nearly homogenous and isotropic distribution of matter into a matter-
current generating relativistic anisotropic gravitational potentials or metric components. Only those
motional coordinate transformations that reﬂect this are physically relevant and legitimate
statement of the principle of relativity and it is strongly tied to the observed homo-
geneity of the matter-energy distribution. Surprisingly, the Galilean transformations
(GT) correctly gives us, along with the observed anisotropy, the most important rel-
ativistic feature of motion—time dilation! To illustrate this use a limited version
of the actual Robertson-Walker metric, ignoring the very slow time evolution. GT
speciﬁes the coordinate transformations x′ = x = vt and t′ = t. Physical spatial and
temporal intervals can be deduced by including the metric in the moving frame.
Under GT, the metric coeﬃcients transform from {g00 = −1, g0i = gi0 = 0, gii = 1}
to {g00 = −(1 −v2∕c2), g0i = gi0 = v∕c, gii = 1} . Nonzero gi0, a gravito-magnetic
potential, gives the observed anisotropy. The temporal duration in the moving frame
is now √−g00dt′ = (1 −v2∕c2)1∕2dt. GT indeed contains the physics of time dilation
with v as the absolute velocity or velocity relative to the cosmic frame. Of course,
the relative velocity of light is now Galilean, c′ = c ± v. Therefore, we also get the
length contraction correctly.
This can also be treated in the language of gravitational potentials. It is well known
that the Newtonian gravitational potential Φu at a point in this universe of size Hubble
radius or so, evaluated using the observed matter-energy density, is numerically close
to c2. In moving frames, the relativistic potential will have velocity dependent ‘vector
potential’ component
Ai = viΦu
c
(1 −v2∕c2)−1∕2 = 𝛾viΦu

leading to several large gravito-magnetic eﬀects.
Though gi0 is homogeneous in a uniformly moving frame, which implies the prin-
ciple of relativity, if there an acceleration gi0 becomes time dependent and the phys-
ical eﬀect is a reactive force on the accelerated system,
Fi = −mg

In other words, the vector potential modiﬁes the momentum (enabling generalizing
to quantum theory) as p′ = p −mgAi. We see that accelerating a body requires over-
coming this cosmic gravito-magnetic reaction and hence a force Fi which is the full
relativistic form of Newton’s law of dynamics and the conventional inertial mass
is just mi = mgΦu∕c2. The law of dynamics is indeed gravitational, operative only
because the universe is gravitationally charged, a connection that physics never imag-
ined so far. Newton’s law is a relativistic gravito-magnetic consequence of cosmic
matter and the analogue in electrodynamics is the Lenz’s law. We see that not just
the conventional pseudo-forces in rotation, but also the very fact that a force propor-
tional to mass is required to accelerate an object is a direct consequence of cosmic
gravity, going a step deeper than Mach’s speculation on pseudo-forces in rotation.
Hence the ratio mi∕mg is universal. The equivalence principle is a necessary
implication of cosmic gravity. Therefore, Newton’s law of dynamics and the equiv-
alence principle have the same physical content and one implies the other through
their cosmic gravity connection [11]. Needless to emphasize that both the centrifu-
gal and the Coriolis forces follow as consequences of cosmic gravity, fully satisfy-
ing Machian speculations. The curl of g0i or Ai is 2Ω,which is the cosmic gravito-
magnetic ﬁeld Bcg in any rotating frame and an object moving at velocity v will feel
a gravito-magnetic force Fgm(v) = mgv × 2Ω. Thus Coriolis force is just the gravita-
tional Lorentz force. The particular pseudo-force that Mach addressed, the centrifu-
gal force is from the time dependence of the direction of Ai; Fc = mgAi
d ̂A
dt = mv2∕r.
The other important eﬀect is the coupling of cosmic gravity to spin, both classical
and quantum. Spin is the current of the charge of gravity and all spin dependent
physical eﬀects should be traced to the gravitational interaction. The coupling is
s ⋅Bcg∕2. Cosmic relativity addresses this completely and derives a whole lot of
observed and observable physical eﬀects, ranging from geometric phases and spin
valve eﬀects on particles in chiral motion to purely quantum eﬀects like the fractional
quantum eﬀect and spin-statistics connection [12].
Appendix E
The Relative Velocity of Light
In the context of the debate between absolute and relative, there is in fact just one
crucial foundational postulate we need to test and verify for deciding one way or
other. That is the nature of propagation of light. A paradigm in which there is a pre-
ferred frame that determines the ‘true’ velocity of light, the one-way velocity of light
relative to an inertial observer moving relative to the frame at ‘absolute velocity’ v
is c ± v. In contrast, the prevalent concept of space-time in physics derives from the
postulate of the invariance of the relative velocity of light, which in turn rejects the
idea of absolute rest, preferred frame and universal time. Then light takes the same
duration to travel the relative distance L measured from the observer, independent of

14

181
the velocity of the observer. If this could be directly checked, we can decide with-
out ambiguity on the fundamental debate. The general premise is that this test is not
possible because the measurement of duration requires two clocks separated by dis-
tance L, and their synchronization requires the very feature we are trying to ascertain.
However, it turns out that this problem can be solved in an amazingly simple way
[1, 13], once we break apart from the psychological shackles of classical two-way
experiments like the Michelson-Morley experiment which are not decisive between
the two alternatives. That the M-M experiment cannot decide the issue, contrary to
common beliefs and statements is easy to prove. The expected signal in the M-M
interferometer is proportional to the diﬀerence in two-way light travel time in the
two arms;
𝛿T =
2L1
c(1 −v2∕c2) −
2L2
c(1 −v2∕c2)1∕2
(14.4)
This was observed to be zero. One explanation is that relative velocity of light is
Galilean, but the arm L1 that is along the direction of the velocity has a physical
contraction of L1(1 −v2∕c2)1∕2. The STR explanation is that there is no physical
length contraction (and it is a coordinate eﬀect that depends on relative velocities),
but the relative velocity of light is an invariant constant and hence light takes time
2L∕c in each arm, independent of the velocity of the interferometer. There is no way
to resolve this ambiguity in any variation of the M-M experiment. One needs to ﬁnd
a way to compare one-way relative velocities.
The physical issue to determine by a measurement is the time taken to travel
a distance L relative to the observer. Imagine a pre-deﬁned light path with ﬁxed
length. One counts time when light starts from one end and it is clear that the time
light takes to reach the other end does not depend on the shape of the light path.
However, the second clock at the other end comes close to the ﬁrst one when we
loop around the path and one can dispense with the need for two clocks! If one
chases any moving entity that is moving very fast on a looped one-dimensional path,
one gets a crossing after a duration 𝛿t = L∕c′ where L is the distance around the
loop and c′ is the relative velocity, all measured relative to the observer. This can
be measured with a single clock and the observer can continue to be on a iner-
tial trajectory (unlike in the controversial Sagnac rotating experiment). The cru-
cial point is that correctness of the experimental method can be tested on a known
Galilean wave, like sound and then it becomes simply a comparison between sound
and light in identical conﬁgurations (Fig. 14.2). The experiment with sound returns
the expected result; the duration depends linearly on the velocity of the observer
as 𝛿t = L∕(c −v) ≃L(1 + v∕c)∕c. The experiment with light returns the unexpected
result; the duration, measured interferometrically, depends linearly on the velocity of
the observer as 𝛿t ≃L(1 + v∕c)∕c. Light is indeed Galilean! Its true velocity is deter-
mined in the cosmic rest frame (and not the ether of the 19th century). Irrespective
of what one believes, a direct empirical test falsiﬁes the fundamental postulate of
relativity theories and also supports the existence of a preferred frame. The result
itself cannot pin down what this frame is, but supplementary evidence unambigu-
ously picks the cosmic gravitational frame as the determinant frame.

182

When a wave-pulse is chased by an observer, the relative distance increases progres-
sively, but the time taken to reach any point on the path can be determined with just one clock by
looping the path around, while the observer is in inertial motion. The validity of the idea is tested
by measuring the relative velocity of sound (left panel), which returns the expected Galilean depen-
dence of the time delay on the velocity of the observer. The experiment is repeated with light in the
same conﬁguration and the result is similar, proving without ambiguity that light is indeed Galilean
It is important to mention that we have now completed several other experi-
ments [12] involving currents and magnets in general relative motion and gyroscopes
(gravito-magnets) in rotating frames, apart from analyzing several other experiments
where particles with spin are transported along non-inertial trajectories, all of which
unambiguously and ﬁrmly asserts that “phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of
mechanics possess properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest”.

An Anomaly in Space and Time
and the Origin of Dynamics
Joan A. Vaccaro
Abstract The Hamiltonian deﬁnes the dynamical properties of the universe.
Evidence from particle physics shows that there is a diﬀerent version of the Hamil-
tonian for each direction of time. As there is no physical basis for the universe to
be asymmetric in time, both versions must operate equally. However, conventional
physical theories accommodate only one version of the Hamiltonian and one direc-
tion of time. This represents an unexplained anomaly in conventional physics and
calls for a reworking of the concepts of time and space. Here I explain how the
anomaly can be resolved by allowing dynamics to emerge phenomenologically. The
resolution oﬀers a picture of time and space that lies below our everyday experience,
and one in which their diﬀerences are epiphenomenal rather than elemental.

Introduction
One of the earliest attempts to describe the nature of time and space comes from
Parmenides (∼500 BCE) [1]. He and his pupil Zeno argued for monism—that there
was only a single reality—and so to them time was a complete whole without divi-
sion. They argued that this gives less absurdities than the opposing pluralistic view
where multiple realities catered for diﬀerent modes of being. Zeno’s well-known
paradoxes were attempts to illustrate the absurdities that would follow from plu-
ralism. However, a new way of looking at nature, based on empirical observations
and mathematical calculations, emerged in the European Renaissance period. The
perceived diﬃculties associated with Zeno’s paradoxes were largely swept aside
with the development of calculus. Building on the work of Copernicus and Galileo,
Newton proposed that an absolute time ﬂows uniformly throughout an absolute space
[2]. Newton’s framework represents a kind of pluralism where each moment in time

represents a separate reality. Then, about a century ago, James [3] and McTaggart
[4] resurrected a monist view of time in the form of the block universe, where time
is seen to be one structure without a present, past or future. The block universe rep-
resents, for the most part, the orthodoxy among physicists in modern times [5, 6].
Nevertheless, a new kind of pluralism will reemerge later in this chapter.
The impetus for abandoning Newton’s framework of space and time in physics
came from its failure to account for the propagation of light in the Michelson-Morley
experiments of 1887. This anomaly led Einstein in 1905 to propose a new framework
for space and time in his special theory of relativity. How we think of time and
space today in terms of a background geometry is moulded by Einstein’s relativistic
spacetime—an amalgamation of space and time into a single entity. An interval of
either time or space for one reference frame can be an interval that extends over both
time and space in another reference frame.1 In this sense, one can say that space and
time appear in special relativity on the same footing.
Yet time and space are quite diﬀerent in other respects. For example, matter can
be localised in a region of space but not in an interval of time. That is, a lump of
matter—such as an atom, a coﬀee cup or even a galaxy—can exist in one region
of space and no other, but conservation of mass2 forbids matter from existing at
one time interval and no other. To exist only at one time interval, for one second
after midday say, would mean the matter not existing before midday, existing only
during the second after midday and vanishing at the end of the second. We avoid this
drastic violation of mass conservation in conventional physics by insisting that matter
follows an equation of motion that translates it over all times. The upshot is that
matter is presumed to undergo continuous translation over time (as time evolution)
but there is no corresponding presumption about the matter undergoing translations
over space.
Moreover, the presumed continuous translation over time occurs in a preferred
direction which is described by various arrows of time. The ﬁrst arrow to be named
formally is the thermodynamic arrow [7] which points in the direction of increasing
entropy. Other arrows include the cosmological arrow, which points away from the
big bang, and the radiation arrow, which points in the direction of emission of waves
[6]. In contrast, space is isotropic.
There is another, quite subtle, diﬀerence between time and space that has largely
escaped attention until recently: translations in time and space have very diﬀerent dis-
crete symmetry properties [8–10]. The discrete symmetries here represent an invari-
ance to the operations of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P) and time rever-
sal (T). Although nature respects these symmetries in most situations, exceptions
have been discovered in the last 60 years. The exceptions are observed as violations
of particular combinations of the C, P and T symmetries in certain particle decays
[11–16]. The violations are independent of position in space, and so they occur over
translations in time (i.e. as a decay) and not translations in space.
1Appendix 1 discusses this in more detail.
2The terms mass and matter here can be taken to mean relativistic energy.

The fact that time and space have these diﬀerences does not, in itself, constitute
a problem. On the surface, the diﬀerences don’t appear to be pointing to a glaring
anomaly that requires a reworking of the foundations of physics like the results of
the Michelson-Morley experiment did. Yet there is an anomaly, one that has been
around for so long that it risks being overlooked because of its familiarity. It is to do
with the fact that there is no cause for the block universe to be anything other than
symmetrical in time. In other words, there is no physical basis for one direction of
time to be singled out [6]. This invites the question, so where is the other direction
of time? It may be tempting to speculate that another part of the time axis may carry
arrows pointing in the opposite direction. But this will not do, given the impact the
discoveries of the violation of the discrete symmetries have for the Hamiltonian. The
Hamiltonian is a mathematical object that deﬁnes the dynamics. The violation of
time reversal symmetry, called T violation for short, implies that there is a diﬀerent
version of the Hamiltonian for each direction of time, yet we observe only one version
in our universe and, not surprisingly, only the observed version of the Hamiltonian
appears in conventional theories of physics. Where is the other direction of time
and its concomitant version of the Hamiltonian? The fact that there is no answer in
conventional physics constitutes a basic anomaly which calls for a fundamental shift
in our thinking about time and space.
The purpose of this chapter is to expose the anomaly and then review my recent
proposal [10] to resolve it through restructuring the way time and space appear in
physical theory. The anomaly is articulated more precisely in Sect. 15.2 and then
Sect. 15.3 prepares for the required restructuring in terms of a goal and three basic
principles. Following that, the principles are applied to non-relativistic quantum
mechanics in Sect. 15.4 and the chapter ends with a discussion in Sect. 15.5. Addi-
tional background material and speciﬁc details are left to the appendices: special
relativity in Appendix 1, generators and translations in time and space in Appendix
2, and quantum virtual paths in Appendix 3. Full details of my proposed resolution
can be found in Ref. [10].
15.2
An Anomaly: Missing Direction of Time
and Its Hamiltonian
To expose the anomaly we must ﬁrst lay to rest a common misconception that the
arrows of time are melded in some way into the concept of time itself. In particular,
if the only thing that distinguishes the two directions of time is an increase of entropy
in one direction, then perhaps one could be forgiven for succumbing to a conceptual
shorthand and regarding the entropy increase as somehow causing the direction of
time. But, in truth, the arrows are only evidence that time has a direction and there
is simply no basis for claiming them as the cause of that direction. An analogy will
help make the distinction between evidence and cause clearer. Imagine that the leaves
falling from a tree are blown by a steady wind to land preferentially on the downwind

188
J.A. Vaccaro
side of the tree. The pattern of leaves on the ground would then provide evidence
of the direction that the wind is blowing, but there would be no basis for claiming
that the leaves cause the wind to have any particular direction. The same situation
occurs with the direction of time: the arrows are patterns that provide evidence of the
direction of the translations over time, but those patterns do not cause the translations
themselves nor do they cause the translations to be in a particular direction.
Having laid bare the evidential nature of the arrows, we now examine the thermo-
dynamic arrow in particular. This arrow, like all the arrows, is phenomenological in
origin. It arises because thermodynamics was developed to be in accord with nature
and thus it was intentionally structured to have an increasing entropy in the direction
of time we refer to as “forwards” or the “future”. However, as Loschmidt pointed out
long ago, thermodynamics is consistent with time-symmetric physical laws, such as
Newton’s laws of motion, and so any prediction of an increase in entropy in one
direction of time is, necessarily, a prediction of an increase in the opposite direction
of time. To ignore this and claim that the thermodynamic arrow, or any of the arrows,
explains the direction of time, is to commit what Price calls a double standard fallacy
[6]. Avoiding the fallacy leaves us with the problem of a missing direction of time.
Its resolution calls for a time-symmetric model of nature that accounts for both
directions of time—a model in which there are reasons for arrows to point in both
directions. There have been admirable attempts along these lines by Carroll, Barbour
and their co-workers [17, 18], but there is something fundamental missing from their
analyses because they only consider time-symmetric physical laws. The only funda-
mental law that is not time symmetric is usually dismissed as having little to do with
large-scale eﬀects [2, 5, 6, 19]. It is associated with the weak interaction, and its time
asymmetry is observed as T violation in the decay of the K and B mesons [13–16].
However, despite being previously overlooked, I have shown that T violation is capa-
ble of producing large-scale physical eﬀects [8–10]. Moreover, the experimentally
observed T violation implies that the universe is described by two versions of the
Hamiltonian, one for each direction of time. The double-headed arrows of Carroll,
Barbour and co-workers do not account for this crucial fact.
The problem, then, is not only that there is a missing direction of time, but that the
associated version of the Hamiltonian is missing along with it. The anomaly is the
rather glaring absence of both directions of time and both versions of the Hamiltonian
in conventional physical theories; it can be stated formally as follows.
Anomaly There is no basis for nature to be asymmetric in time. Experiments in par-
ticle physics indicate that there are two versions of the Hamiltonian, one for each
direction of time. A time-symmetric theory of nature must give an equal account of
both directions of time and both versions of the Hamiltonian. Conventional theories
fail in this regard because they can accommodate only one version of the Hamil-
tonian and one direction of time.
The anomaly calls for a restructuring of the concepts of time and space in physics.

15.3
The Goal and Basic Principles
The goal of the restructuring might appear to be to simply ﬁnd a time-symmetric
description that includes both versions of the Hamiltonians. However, aiming the
goal directly at the anomaly like this misses an opportunity for rebuilding from a
deeper level. For example, if Einstein had been satisﬁed with a description of the
propagation of light that was consistent with the Michelson-Morley experiment, he
may have settled on some aether-dragging model. Instead, his search for an indirect,
but deeper, solution led to his special theory of relativity, a natural consequence of
which was the resolution of the light-propagation anomaly. In the same way, we need
to take a step back from the anomaly itself. We have seen that the diﬀerences between
time and space are related by the fact that they involve translations: conservation laws
and the equation of motion represent translations over time, the direction of time
describes an asymmetry in translations over time, and the violation of the discrete
symmetries is observed for translations over time. Our understanding of the relation-
ship between time and space would be advanced signiﬁcantly if all diﬀerences could
be shown to have a common origin. The least understood among the diﬀerences is
the C, P and T symmetry violations. Although the violations are generally consid-
ered to represent profound properties of nature, they don’t play any signiﬁcant role in
conventional physics. Indeed, they stand out as having been overlooked. To address
this situation, we undertake the more ambitious goal as follows:
Goal To treat time and space on an equal footing at a fundamental level, and to
allow their familiar diﬀerences to emerge phenomenologically from the discrete sym-
metry violations.
If the violations deliver the diﬀerences between space and time then we will have
found a theory that incorporates both versions of the Hamiltonian in a way that gives
rise to the familiar direction of time. The anomaly would then be resolved as a natural
consequence of the goal.
Having settled on the goal, we now turn to the basic principles needed to achieve
it. When the C, P and T symmetries are obeyed we want matter to be localisable
both in time and space. This will require a formalism in which conservation laws do
not apply and an equation of motion is not deﬁned—this marks a serious departure
from conventional physics. When the violation of the symmetries are introduced into
the formalism, an eﬀective equation of motion and conservation laws need to appear
phenomenologically as a consequence—only then will it be in agreement with con-
ventional physics. The symmetry violations clearly need to play a signiﬁcant role
in the formalism. The violations manifest as changes due to the C, P and T oper-
ations,3 and so their impact would tend to be greater in a formalism in which the
operations are more numerous. The P and T operations, in particular, are associated
with reversing directions in space and time, respectively. It is clear from this that
3If the C, P and T operations do not change the system then the symmetries are obeyed. Violations
represent the converse situation where changes result from the operations.

we need a formalism comprising paths in time and space which suﬀer innumerably-
many reversals. A stochastic Wiener process involves paths of this kind in space.
Feynman’s path integral method [20] also involves similar kinds of paths over con-
ﬁguration space.
The important point about Feynman’s method is that it underpins analytical
mechanics in the limit that Planck’s constant, ℏ, tends to zero. Indeed, his method
shows that Hamilton’s principle of least action arises as a consequence of destruc-
tive interference over all possible paths in conﬁguration space between the initial
and ﬁnal points. But it stops short of considering paths that zigzag over time of the
kind we need to consider here and, as a consequence, it stops short of considering
the impact of the C, P and T symmetry violations that are the focus here. Nonethe-
less, it does demonstrate the importance of quantum path integrals for describing the
universe on a large scale.
Although the paths need to comprise innumerably-many reversals, there are rea-
sons to believe that there are physical limitations to the resolution of intervals in
space and time [21]. For example, the position of an object can be determined by
observing the photons it scatters, but the accuracy of the result cannot be better than
the Planck length LP = 1.6 × 10−35 m [22]. Correspondingly, the timing of the scat-
tering events cannot be determined any better than the Planck time LT = LP∕c =
5.4 × 10−44 s where c is the speed of light. We will assume that fundamental reso-
lution limits of this kind exist without specifying their value. It would be physically
impossible to resolve the structure of paths with step sizes smaller than the resolution
limit, and so we need to treat such paths as having equal physical status.
With these ideas in mind we formulate three principles on which to base the devel-
opment of the new formalism:
Principle 1 A quantum state is represented as a superposition of paths, each con-
taining many reversals. We call these “quantum virtual paths”.
Principle 2 There is a lower limit to the resolution of intervals in space and time.
Quantum virtual paths with step sizes smaller that this limit have an equal physical
status.
Principle 3 States have the same construction in both time and space. Any diﬀer-
ences between space and time, such as dynamics and conservation laws, emerge
phenomenologically as a result of the violation of discrete symmetries C, P and T.
15.4
Applying the Principles
We shall apply the three basic principles to represent the quantum state of an object.4
The object represents the only matter in space and time and it could be an atom,
planet or galaxy. Its details are not important. We will refer to it as the “galaxy” in
4We only use the static representation of a state from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We do
not apply an equation of motion nor do we impose conservation laws.

the following. The ﬁrst task is to develop the formalism in general terms without
referring speciﬁcally to time or space. For that let w be a generic coordinate which
will later be set to be either time or space. We want the galaxy to be localised with
respect to w such that the spread in w is ﬁnite. The most general probability distrib-
ution with a ﬁnite spread has a bell-shape like P(w) illustrated in Fig. 15.1.
15.4.1
Application of Principle 1
An equivalent representation is given by imagining that the galaxy takes a path that
starts at the origin w = 0 and randomly steps back and forth along the w coordinate a
number of times. Let there be N steps in the path and let the magnitude of each step
be 𝛿w. For the ﬁnal location of the galaxy to any value of w, the step size 𝛿w needs
to be inﬁnitesimally small and N needs to be correspondingly large. By setting
𝛿w =
√
2𝜎w
√
N
(15.1)
and choosing a suitably-large value of N we can make the step size, 𝛿w, as small
as we like, and the maximum length of any path, N𝛿w, correspondingly as large as
we like, while keeping the standard deviation in the possible ﬁnal locations ﬁxed at
𝜎w. It needs to be emphasised that even though temporal references such as “starts”,
“steps” and “ﬁnal” are used here, the paths do not represent actual movement over
a time interval. Rather they represent the galaxy executing a sequence of virtual
displacements along w without any reference to time at all. That is, the galaxy is
considered to be simply displaced from w = 0 to the point represented by the end
of the random path. Virtual displacements arise in analytical mechanics when dis-
cussing constraints on motion [23]; here the accumulation of many random virtual
displacements give the possible values of w.

192
J.A. Vaccaro
For the location of the galaxy to be described by the smooth bell-shaped distri-
bution P(w) we need not just one path and its end point, but inﬁnitely many. We
don’t know which end point describes the location of the galaxy and so we have to
allow for the possibility that it could be the end point of any one of many paths.
Technically, this means we represent the location of the galaxy by a superposition of
the end points of all the paths. The superposition is called a “quantum virtual path”,
where quantum refers to the fact that it is a quantum superposition [10].
One can imagine a quantum virtual path for a speciﬁc value of N, say N = 600,
as the sum of the end points of all the paths illustrated in Fig. 15.2. The step size
𝛿w for each zigzag path in the ﬁgure is given by Eq. (15.1) for some ﬁxed value
of the standard deviation 𝜎w. Another quantum virtual path can be constructed for
N = 601 in a similar way for a correspondingly smaller step size 𝛿w. Imagine that this
has been done for every positive integer value of N. As N increases in this imagined
process, the step size 𝛿w reduces and the quantum virtual path represents an ever ﬁner
description of the state of the galaxy, eventually tending to the bell-shaped dashed
curve shown in the ﬁgure. Each quantum virtual path so constructed represents a
possible state of the galaxy in terms of its location along the w coordinate.
Each step of 𝛿w is produced using a particular operation called a “generator” of
the translation. In particular, ̂WF is the generator for translations that increase the
value of w and ̂WB is the generator for ones that decrease its value, as illustrated in
the inset of Fig. 15.2. If the generators are invariant to reversals of direction then they
are equivalent, i.e. ̂WF = ̂WB. More will be said about this later. A technical review
of generators and translations is given in Appendix 2 and a brief discussion of how
a quantum virtual path is related to the bell-shaped distribution P(w) can be found
in Appendix 3.

15.4.2
Application of Principle 2
As the value of N increases, the step size 𝛿w from Eq. (15.1) becomes smaller. At
some point 𝛿w will be smaller than the resolution limit 𝛿wmin for the w coordinate. All
quantum virtual paths with a step size 𝛿w smaller than 𝛿wmin will give descriptions of
equal status according to Principle 2. For convenience, we shall collect the equivalent
quantum virtual paths in a set called 𝐆. Each quantum virtual path in this set equally
represents the state of the galaxy in terms of its location along the w coordinate.
There are an inﬁnite number of such quantum virtual paths in the set 𝐆.
15.4.3
Application of Principle 3
We now discuss space and time explicitly. First consider the spatial case which, for
brevity, we limit to just the x dimension. In this case the generic coordinate w is
replaced with x and the generator of translations is replaced with ̂px, the component
of momentum along the x axis. There is only one generator for translations in both
directions of the x axis and so ̂WF = ̂WB = ̂px here. Further technical details are given
in Appendix 2. Figure 15.2 with w replaced by x illustrates a quantum virtual path
over the x axis. Collecting the quantum virtual paths with a step size smaller than
some minimum resolution limit yields the set of states of equal status which we will
call 𝚿. All the quantum virtual paths in 𝚿are physically indistinguishable from the
bell-shaped distribution P(x) represented in Fig. 15.1 with w replaced with x.
Next, we repeat the same exercise for time. In this case the coordinate is w = t
and, in general, there are two generators of translations given by the two versions of
the Hamiltonian, i.e. ̂WF = ̂HF and ̂WB = ̂HB corresponding to the “forwards” and
“backwards” directions of time, respectively. Technical details regarding these gen-
erators are given in Appendix 2. As with the spatial case, Fig. 15.2 with w replaced
by t illustrates a quantum virtual path over the t axis, and collecting the quantum vir-
tual paths which have a step size smaller than some minimum resolution limit yields
the set of states of equal status which we will call 𝚼.
In a universe where the T symmetry holds, there is only one version of the Hamil-
tonian and so ̂HB = ̂HF = ̂H. In this case the galaxy is localised in time within a
duration of the order of 𝜎t of the origin and all the states in 𝚼are physically indis-
tinguishable from the bell-shaped distribution P(t) represented in Fig. 15.1 with w
replaced with t. The galaxy only exists in time for a relatively short duration at the
origin t = 0 and does not exist before or after this time. It can be imagined to come
into existence momentarily and then promptly vanish. Clearly, in this case, the galaxy
has the same representation in time as in space—it is localised in both—and the for-
malism places time and space on the same footing in this respect. This is far removed
from conventional quantum mechanics as there is no equation of motion and the mass
of the galaxy is not conserved.

194
J.A. Vaccaro
The converse case, where T symmetry is violated, is deﬁned by ̂HB ≠̂HF. The key
point here is that multiple paths that zigzag in diﬀerent ways from the origin to the
same end point can interfere. The interference can be compared to the way waves
travelling on the surface of water behave; if the trough of one wave occurs at the
same point as the crest of another, the two waves will tend to cancel each other in
a process called destructive interference, whereas if two troughs or two crests meet
they tend to reinforce each other as deeper troughs or higher crests, respectively, in a
process called constructive interference. In a similar way, multiple paths that end at
the same point on the time axis interfere either destructively or constructively. The
result is that instead of the probability distribution having a maximum at the origin,
like the bell-shaped curve in Fig. 15.1, destructive interference reduces the proba-
bility to zero in this region. This is compensated by constructive interference that
yields two symmetrically positioned bell-shaped peaks further from the origin as
illustrated in Fig. 15.3. In other words, each quantum virtual path is now composed
of two bell-shaped peaks that represent the galaxy existing at two diﬀerent times,
+t and −t, say. This situation is like Schrödinger’s cat that exists in a superposition
of being both dead and alive simultaneously, except that here the galaxy is at two
diﬀerent times. As the value of N increases, the two peaks become further separated
as shown in Fig. 15.3, and the galaxy shifts in time accordingly. Each quantum vir-
tual path represents one of the states in the set 𝚼, and according to Principle 2, has
equal physical status. In terms of Fig. 15.3, this means that each double-peaked curve
equally represent the position of the galaxy in time.
The presence of T violation clearly has a dramatic aﬀect on the temporal descrip-
tion of the galaxy. For example, consider the question, where in time is the galaxy
likely to be found? Without T violation, the unequivocal answer is only near the ori-
gin in accordance with Fig. 15.1, whereas with T violation, the answer implied by
Fig. 15.3 would be at any time t.

15.4.4
The Origin of Dynamics
We now focus on the T violation case. According to Principle 2, all states in the
set 𝚼have an equal status in representing the galaxy in time. For any given value
of time, t, there is a corresponding state in 𝚼that represents the galaxy being in a
superposition of the times +t and −t.5 This implies that the galaxy exists at any time
we wish to consider, and so its mass is conserved. This conservation law has not
been imposed on the formalism, as it would need to be in conventional theories, but
rather it is phenomenology arising from T violation.
The corresponding equation of motion is found as follows. The two peaks +t
and −t in each curve in Fig. 15.3 represent time-reversed versions of the galaxy. An
observer in the galaxy would not be able to distinguish between them and so we need
only consider one, at +t say. If the observer makes observations with a resolution in
time that is broader than the width of the peak, the peak will appear to be instan-
taneous and a set of them will appear to form a continuous sequence. Under these
circumstances, the observer would ﬁnd evidence of an equation of motion that is
consistent with the Schrödinger equation of conventional quantum mechanics. This
equation has not been imposed on the formalism but rather it arises as phenomenol-
ogy associated with T violation. This suggests that the origin of dynamics lies in T
violation.
The remaining distinctive feature of time to consider is its direction, and the states
in 𝚼have a time ordering in the following sense. According to the meaning of time
evolution deﬁned in Appendix 2, the peak labelled “d” Fig. 15.3 represents a state
that has evolved in time from the state represented by the peak labelled “c”, and that
state has evolved from the state represented by “b”, which has evolved from the state
represented by “a”, but the converse is not true. This means that there is an arrow of
time pointing in the direction of +t. The same argument applies to the time reversed
states in regards to the −t direction and so the arrow is double headed, like those of
Carroll and Barbour and co-workers [17, 18]. The important point here is that both
versions of the Hamiltonian, ̂HF and ̂HB, are included in the formalism.
We have now achieved our goal: we treated time and space on an equal footing
and found their familiar diﬀerences to emerge phenomenologically from T violation.
15.5
Discussion
We began by identifying a fundamental anomaly in physics, viz. conventional theo-
ries fail to give a time symmetric description that accounts equally for both versions
of the Hamiltonian and both directions of time. We have presented a new formalism
5In principle, the time t could be chosen to be the current age of the universe, 13.8 billion years.
There is a state in 𝚼that represents the galaxy being in a superposition of the times 13.8 and −13.8
billion years.

for quantum mechanics that resolves this anomaly. The new formalism is based on
three principles that allow quantum states in time and space to be treated on an equal
footing in terms of quantum virtual paths. The distinctive features associated with
time, i.e. conservation laws, equation of motion and the direction of time, are not
imposed on the formalism but rather emerge phenomenologically as a result of T
violation. These key diﬀerences between time and space follow from the fact that
the generators of translations in space and time, the momentum operator and the
Hamiltonian, respectively, have diﬀerent symmetry properties: the momentum oper-
ator is invariant to the C, P and T symmetry operations whereas the Hamiltonian is
not. Accounting for these diﬀerences gives the origin of dynamics.
The new formalism also reﬁnes the meaning of time. In conventional theories,
the word “time” refers to both a coordinate of a space-time background as well as
the parameter describing dynamical evolution. Both concepts are ﬁrmly entwined
by conservation laws. For example, the conservation of mass implies that a massive
object will persist over all times and, accordingly, it is represented on a space-time
background as existing at each time. The dynamical evolution of the object becomes
the path of the object on the space-time background. Here, however, the two con-
cepts of time as a background coordinate and as a dynamical parameter are distinct.
Time and space have an equal footing as a background on which quantum states are
represented. The states, as quantum virtual paths, represent objects that are localised
in time and space: each state in the sets 𝚿and 𝚼represents a relatively-narrow bell-
shaped distribution or a sum of two relatively-narrow bell-shaped distributions. In
particular, mass is not conserved and there is no equation of motion for any indi-
vidual state in 𝚼(as illustrated by Fig. 15.3)—time appears only as a background
coordinate. In contrast, mass conservation, the equation of motion and the direction
of time, are properties of the whole set 𝚼where time appears as a dynamical parame-
ter. In other words, time as a background coordinate and as a dynamical parameter
apply to distinct constructs in the formalism.
It might appear unusual that a quantum formalism is being proposed to explain
large scale structure of nature given that quantum eﬀects are typically seen only in
relatively small systems under controlled conditions. However, Feynman’s path inte-
gral method has already demonstrated how quantum phenomena underpins Hamil-
ton’s least action principle in analytical mechanics [20] and thus large scale structure.
In this regard, the new formalism should be considered as an extension of Feynman’s
method to encompass paths over time and the C, P and T symmetry violations and,
thus, to apply to nature on a large scale as well.
Finally, the set of states 𝚼for T violation represents the galaxy at an inﬁnite
sequence of times. Each state in 𝚼may be viewed as representing a diﬀerent reality.
In this sense, the formalism resurrects a kind of pluralism. The monism-pluralism
cycle for time turns once more.

Appendix 1
We brieﬂy review here the Lorentz transformation in special relativity. A point in
spacetime is referred to as an event; it is speciﬁed by four coordinates x, y, z, t
with respect to a reference frame. The Lorentz transformation gives the relation-
ship between the coordinates of two diﬀerent inertial reference frames. In particular,
consider two events that occur a distance of 𝛥x apart along the x axis and separated
by a duration of 𝛥t in time in the x, y, z, t reference frame. In the x′, y′, z′, t′ reference
frame that is moving a constant speed v along the x axis of the ﬁrst, the distance and
duration along the x′ and t′ axes between the events are given by
𝛥x′ = 𝛾(𝛥x −v𝛥t)
𝛥t′ = 𝛾(𝛥t −v𝛥x∕c2),
respectively, where 𝛾=
√
1 −v2∕c2 and c is the speed of light. The important point
here is that for 𝛥t = 0 what is considered to be solely a spatial interval, 𝛥x, in one ref-
erence frame becomes part of a temporal interval 𝛥t′ as well as being part of a spatial
interval 𝛥x′ in the other reference frame. That is, space and time are interchangeable.
Appendix 2
Here, we brieﬂy review translations and their generators. Recall that the Taylor
expansion of a function f(x),
f(x + a) = f(x) + a d
dxf(x) + a2
2!
d2
dx2 f(x) + a3
3!
d3
dx3 f(x) + … ,
can be written compactly in exponential form as
f(x + a) = e−ia(i d
dx )f(x).
When written in this form the diﬀerential operator i d
dx is said to be the generator
of translations in x. The generator of spatial translations along the x axis is ̂px, the
operator representing the x component of momentum. We need only consider one
dimension of space for our purposes here. Thus we write
|x + a⟩x = e−iâpx|x⟩x
(15.2)
where |x⟩x represents a state vector for position x and, for convenience, we assume
units in which ℏ= 1. Similarly, the generator of translations in time t is the Hamil-
tonian operator ̂H and so

198
J.A. Vaccaro
|𝜓(t + a)⟩t = e−ia ̂H|𝜓(t)⟩t
(15.3)
where |𝜓(t)⟩t represents a state at time t and evolving in the +t time direction.
The symmetry operations relevant to these translations are the parity inversion
̂P and the time reversal ̂T operations6 deﬁned by Wigner [24]. Parity inversion
interchanges x with −x, y with −y and z with −z and time reversal interchanges
t with −t. For example, ̂P|x⟩x = |−x⟩x and ̂T|t⟩t = |−t⟩t. The reverse of the transla-
tion in Eq. (15.2) can be written as
|x −a⟩x = ̂P|−x + a⟩x = ̂Pe−iâpx|−x⟩x = ̂Pe−iâpx ̂P−1|x⟩x.
As ̂P̂px ̂P−1 = −̂px we get
|x −a⟩x = eiâpx|x⟩x
as expected directly from Eq. (15.2). This shows that the generator of translations in
either direction of the x axis is the same. The reverse of the translation in Eq. (15.3)
is somewhat diﬀerent, however. Consider
|𝜙(t −a)⟩t = ̂T|𝜙(−t + a)⟩t = ̂Te−ia ̂H|𝜙(−t)⟩t = ̂Te−ia ̂H ̂T−1|𝜙(t)⟩t
= eia ̂T ̂H ̂T−1|𝜙(t)⟩t
(15.4)
where |𝜙(t)⟩t represents a state that evolves in the −t direction and we have made
use of the antiunitary nature of the time reversal operator, i.e. ̂Ti ̂T−1 = −i, in the last
line [24]. In general ̂T ̂H ̂T−1 ≠̂H and so we set, for convenience,
̂HB = ̂T ̂H ̂T−1
̂HF = ̂H
where the subscripts F and B refer to the “forwards” and “backwards” direction of
time corresponding to the +t and −t time directions, respectively. If T symmetry is
obeyed then
̂HB = ̂HF = ̂H,
(T symmetry)
and so there is a unique version of the Hamiltonian, whereas for T violation there is
a diﬀerent version of the Hamiltonian for each direction of time,
̂HB ≠̂HF.
(T violation)
6We use the operator symbols ̂P and ̂T to represent the operations and the letters P and T to represent
the corresponding symmetries. Thus, if the system is invariant to the ̂P operation it obeys the P
symmetry.

15
An Anomaly in Space and Time and the Origin of Dynamics
199
In general, we write Eqs. (15.3) and (15.4) as
|𝜓(t + a)⟩t = e−ia ̂HF|𝜓(t)⟩t
|𝜙(t −a)⟩t = eia ̂HB|𝜙(t)⟩t.
The key point to be made here is that the generator of translations in space, ̂px, is
invariant (up to a sign change) under any of the C, P and T operations. In contrast, the
generator of translations in time, ̂H, is not invariant to the C, P and T operations, in
general. This underlies the statement in the Introduction that the symmetry violations
occur over translations in time and not translations in space.
In the case of T violation we need to take care with using the correct Hamiltonian
associated with each direction of time. In particular, we need to apply the following
principle:
Principle 4 Physical time evolution is represented by the operators e−ia ̂HF and eia ̂HB
for the forward (+t) and backward (−t) directions of time, respectively. The opera-
tions eia ̂HF and e−ia ̂HB represent the mathematical inverse operation of “unwinding”
or “backtracking” the evolution produced by e−ia ̂HF and eia ̂HB, respectively.
For example, eia ̂HF|𝜓(t + a)⟩t = |𝜓(t)⟩t represents unwinding the time evolution
e−ia ̂HF|𝜓(t)⟩t = |𝜓(t + a)⟩t whereas eia ̂HB|𝜓(t + a)⟩t, which is not equal to |𝜓(t)⟩t
in general, represents time evolution of |𝜓(t + a)⟩t in the −t direction. More details
are given in Ref. [10].
Appendix 3
In this Appendix we brieﬂy discuss the mathematical construction of quantum virtual
paths for the generic coordinate w. Let the generators of translations be given by ̂WF
and ̂WB for the +w and −w directions, respectively. A quantum virtual path of the
kind we want is given by [10]
|g⟩N ∝1
2N
(
ei ̂WB𝛿w+e−i ̂WF𝛿w)N
|0⟩w
(15.5)
where 𝛿w is given by Eq. (15.1) and represents an increment in w and |w⟩w represents
a state for which w is well-deﬁned.7 Expanding the power on the right side gives 2N
terms each with N factors. Each term represents a path comprising N steps of 𝛿w
over the w coordinate. For example, a term of the form
… ei ̂WB𝛿we−i ̂WF𝛿wei ̂WB𝛿wei ̂WB𝛿we−i ̂WF𝛿w|0⟩w
7If w represents a spatial coordinate then |w⟩w would be a corresponding spatial eigenstate. For the
case where w represents the time coordinate, however, we only need |w⟩w to represent a well-deﬁned
time. More details can be found in Ref. [10].

represents the object starting at the origin w = 0 and then undergoing virtual dis-
placements to w = 𝛿w, w = 0, w = −𝛿w, w = 0 w = −𝛿w and so on.
It is relatively straightforward to show that the state |g⟩N in Eq. (15.5) approaches
a Gaussian state in the limit of large N when the discrete symmetry holds. To see
this set ̂WB = ̂WF = ̂W and use
exp(−A2∕2) = lim
N→∞cosN(A∕
√
N)
to ﬁnd
lim
N→∞|g⟩N ∝e−̂W2𝜎2
w|0⟩w,
and then, assuming that ̂W has a complete orthonormal basis, rewrite this as the
Fourier integral
lim
N→∞|g⟩N ∝∫dw e−w2∕4𝜎2
we−i ̂Ww|0⟩w
= ∫g(w)|w⟩wdw
where g(w) is given by
g(w) = e−w2∕4𝜎2
w.
The square of this, g2(w), is proportional to the bell-shaped probability distribution
P(w) represented in Fig. 15.1.

Space, Time, and Adynamical Explanation
in the Relational Blockworld
W.M. Stuckey, Michael Silberstein and Timothy McDevitt
The Relational Blockworld (RBW) interpretation [1–3] of quantum mechanics
(QM) was spawned in response to quantum nonlocality, which is summed up nicely
in this Wikipedia quote [4], “the phenomenon by which measurements made at a
microscopic level contradict a collection of notions known as local realism that are
regarded as intuitively true in classical mechanics.” So, what is “local realism” and
what does it have to do with space and time? Let us start with a so-called “delayed
choice” experiment by Zeilinger.
The Zeilinger experiment [5] is shown in Fig. 16.1. The mystery of this
experimental outcome does not require any familiarity with the formalism of
quantum mechanics (QM). A laser beamed into a crystal produces a pair of
entangled photons. “Entangled” simply means that a measurement outcome on one
of the photons (at detector D1 here) is inextricably related to the outcome of a
measurement on the other photon (at detector D2 here), as we will soon see. One of
the photons proceeds down through the double slit to detector D2 while its
entangled partner travels to the right through a lens to detector D1. The experi-
mentalist can decide whether to locate D1 at a distance of one focal length (f, the
“momentum measurement”) or two focal lengths (2f, the “position measurement”)
behind the lens (Fig. 16.1). The photon detected at D2 then produces two different
corresponding patterns, i.e., the upper right pattern (labeled “D1: Position mea-
surement”) and the lower right pattern (labeled “D1: Momentum measurement”).

That the photon at D2 acts like a particle (upper outcome) or a wave (lower
outcome) depending on how its entangled partner is measured at D1 is interesting,
but that’s not the mystery. Notice that the distance from the photon source to D2 is
much shorter than the distance from the photon source to D1. The two photons are
emitted at the same time traveling at the same speed, so the ﬁrst photon to reach a
detector is at D2. But, the photon’s behavior at D2 is supposedly determined by the
experimentalist’s choice of where to locate D1. How does the photon at D2 know
where D1 will be placed? Doesn’t the experimentalist have a real (delayed) choice
that can be made after the photon has been detected at D2 and before the other
photon has been detected at D1? If causal inﬂuences must proceed from past to
future and the outcomes at D1 and D2 are causally related, then we have to
conclude that the photon at D2 determines the experimentalist’s choice of where to
put D1? QM doesn’t care about “choice,” delayed or otherwise, it simply predicts
the correlation in the outcomes without regard for which outcome occurs ﬁrst [6].
We are dynamic creatures, our perceptions are formed in time-evolved fashion,
so
we’re
predisposed
to
think
dynamically
and,
therefore,
we
want
to
understand/explain what we experience dynamically. However, physics may be
telling us that despite our time-evolved perceptions, dynamical explanation is not
fundamental. The Newtonian Schema [7] is the mathematical approach corre-
sponding to “dynamical explanation.” One inputs initial conditions (the initial state
of the system in question) and a dynamical law tells you how that initial state is
time-evolved to some ﬁnal state. Sean Carroll sums it up nicely in this quote [8]:
Let’s talk about the actual way physics works, as we understand it. Ever since Newton, the
paradigm for fundamental physics has been the same, and includes three pieces. First, there
is the “space of states”: basically, a list of all the possible conﬁgurations the universe could
conceivably be in. Second, there is some particular state representing the universe at some
time, typically taken to be the present. Third, there is some rule for saying how the universe
evolves with time. You give me the universe now, the laws of physics say what it will

become in the future. This way of thinking is just as true for quantum mechanics or general
relativity or quantum ﬁeld theory as it was for Newtonian mechanics or Maxwell’s
electrodynamics.
As Carroll points out, all the theories of physics can be written in the Newtonian
Schema. In contrast, the Lagrangian Schema [9] says the behavior of objects isn’t
due to forces governing their behavior instant by instant, but rather their behavior
from start to ﬁnish is the result of a minimal (extremal) action. The action S is the
Lagrangian L integrated over the time interval in question.
S =
Z
L dt
where L is the difference between the system’s kinetic and potential energies, so S is
a spatiotemporally global quantity. The dynamical laws of the Newtonian Schema
follow for each inﬁnitesimal time dt in the Lagrangian Schema when you demand
δS = 0, i.e., that S is extremal. If we are realists about the Lagrangian Schema
approach, which people typically are not, we get the adynamical, spatiotemporally
holistic view called the blockworld (BW). Let us imagine then that the Lagrangian
Schema is not just a calculation device, but represents what we call an adynamical
global constraint (AGC). It is this constraint that ultimately explains the strangeness
of the quantum, as opposed to any dynamical explanation. Geroch sums up the BW
perspective nicely with this quote [10]:
There is no dynamics within space-time itself: nothing ever moves therein; nothing hap-
pens; nothing changes. In particular, one does not think of particles as moving through
space-time, or as following along their world-lines. Rather, particles are just in space-time,
once and for all, and the world-line represents, all at once, the complete life history of the
particle.
Fig. 16.2 A light ray emitted at S will be received at C after being refracted at R. This is the path
of least time. The direct path S to C requires more time, so it is not the path taken. If the water is
not present, the light ray would not be refracted at R and would instead proceed to A http://www-

An easy way to see the difference between the Newtonian Schema (dynamical
view) and the Lagrangian Schema (BW view) is to consider the example of a light
ray emitted from point S in air and arriving at point C in water (Fig. 16.2). The
explanation per the Lagrangian Schema is that the path S to R to C is the path of
least time. The direct path S to C (shown) takes longer, so it’s not the path taken.
The Newtonian Schema explanation is that the light ray emitted from S towards R
proceeds without deviation, since nothing is interacting with it, until it hits the water
at point R. The water then refracts the light towards point C. While both methods
yield the same result, we tend to favor the Newtonian Schema explanation, since the
Lagrangian Schema explanation sounds a bit like the light ray intended to go to C
and calculated its path based on the presence of the water. According to the
Newtonian Schema, the light ray that reached C was refracted at R, otherwise it
would’ve gone to point A, i.e., it didn’t adjust its emission direction with the
intention of reaching C and it certainly doesn’t ‘know’ it will encounter water when
it’s emitted. But the BW view doesn’t attribute any intentionality or prescience to
the light ray, rather it simply relegates dynamical explanation to secondary status a
priori. If you want to know why something happens the way it does, the funda-
mental reason has to do with a spatiotemporally holistic characterization of the
phenomenon under investigation. If the subsequent BW analysis permits it, a
time-evolved story can be told in conjunction with the adynamical explanation.
Otherwise, the fundamental BW perspective just does not permit a dynamical story,
so the adynamical explanation just has to be accepted as the ﬁnal answer. As
Wharton says [9]:
When examined critically, the Newtonian Schema Universe assumption is exactly the sort
of anthropocentric argument that physicists usually shy away from. It’s basically the
assumption that the way we humans solve physics problems must be the way the universe
actually operates.
No counterfactual deﬁniteness is another such violation of our dynamical
experience based in “local realism.” Counterfactual deﬁniteness is the claim that the
particles being measured have a pre-existing value that is recorded faithfully, such
that had you measured otherwise you would have gotten a different value. Let’s
look at a simple example of no counterfactual deﬁniteness due to Hardy as
explained by Mermin [11].
Fig. 16.3 Mermin’s rendition of the Hardy experiment
206
W.M. Stuckey et al.

The Hardy experiment is shown and explained in Fig. 16.3. As with the Zei-
linger experiment, you don’t have to be familiar with the formalism of QM to
appreciate this mysterious experimental outcome. In experimental trials (called
“runs”) where the detector settings are not the same, i.e., left detector set at 1 and
right detector set at 2 (“12” for short) or the converse “21,” you never see both
detector 1 and detector 2 outcomes of green (“GG” for short). So, 12GG and 21GG
never happen. The other two facts are that you occasionally see 22GG and you
never see 11RR. Ok, so what’s so mysterious about that? Well, let’s try to explain
the situation for the particles in a 22GG run. The particles don’t ‘know’ how they
will be measured in any given run, in fact the detector settings can be chosen an
instant before the particles arrive at their respective detectors. And, assuming the
measurements are space-like separated,1 no information about the setting and
outcome at one detector can reach the other detector before the particle is measured
there, i.e., the measurements are said to be “local.” Thus, the particles don’t ‘know’
how they will be measured when they are emitted and they can’t transmit that
information to each other during the run. So, it seems the particles’ possible out-
comes with respect to each possible detector setting must be coordinated to prevent
the proscribed outcomes 12GG, 21GG, and 11RR. Mermin calls the coordination of
outcomes “instruction sets” and the fact that the particles have deﬁnite properties
corresponding to possible measurements whether they are carried out or not is
called “realism” or counterfactual deﬁniteness. The combination of these assump-
tions is often called “local realism.” Both assumptions seem reasonable, locality
because the temporal order of space-like separated events is frame dependent
according to special relativity, which would seem to rule out superluminal infor-
mation transfer, and realism because the particles don’t ‘know’ how they will be
measured until the last moment and they have to avoid proscribed outcomes. So,
let’s continue with the analysis.
Since the result is 22GG we know the particles were both 1X2G at emission
(X = R or G). We know particle 1 wasn’t 1G2G, because had the detectors been set
to 12 we would’ve gotten a 12GG outcome and that never happens. Likewise,
particle 2 couldn’t be 1G2G or a setting of 21 would’ve produced a 21GG outcome
which never happens. Thus, both particles must’ve been 1R2G in order to give the
22GG outcome and rule out the possibility of a 12GG or a 21GG outcome. But,
both particles being 1R2G can’t be right either, because then a setting of 11
would’ve produced a 11RR outcome which never happens. So, what are the states
of the particles when they are emitted in a run giving 22GG? We’ve exhausted all
the logical possibilities and none of them work!
1Space-like separated events means information exchange between the events requires a
faster-than-light (aka superluminal) signal. In special relativity, the order of space-like separated
events A and B depends on your frame of reference. Suppose Bob sees event A happen before
event B. Alice, who is in motion with respect to Bob, can then see event B happen before event A.
This is different than time-like separated events (information exchange between the events can be
done with a slower-than-light signal) where all observers agree on the temporal order, regardless of
their relative motion.

There are only conjectural answers to that question in the foundations of physics
community, but most seem to agree that there is no counterfactual deﬁniteness, at
least for some subset of properties. If there is no counterfactual deﬁniteness, how
does one account for the 22GG outcome of the Hardy experiment? Again, the
mystery arises because we’re looking for a Newtonian Schema (dynamical)
explanation, i.e., a spatiotemporally local, time-evolved story in which the particles
have deﬁnite properties prior to measurement and deﬁnite trajectories. In such a
story, the state of each of the particles is time-evolved instant by instant from
emission to detection, so we’re simply asking for an instant-by-instant account of
the particles in this experiment, as we tried unsuccessfully to provide above. But, if
reality is fundamentally a BW whose observed patterns are governed by an AGC,
e.g., extremal action, then the observed patterns in this experiment are just the
outcomes and the Feynman path integral [12] of QM is the AGC. On this view,
conﬁguration space and the Schrödinger equation are just calculation devices.
Furthermore, we can dispense with counterfactual deﬁniteness or realism and jet-
tison the very idea of particles as entities with autonomous existence and contin-
uous trajectories from source to detector. We can’t observe the particles between
emission and detection, QM tells us and we ﬁnd experimentally that additional
detectors introduced between the source and detectors already in place will change
the ﬁnal outcomes. Thus, we’re forbidden from acquiring such intermediate
information without changing the experimental conﬁguration, i.e., the BW pattern.
The AGC (Feynman path integral) therefore doesn’t have to say anything about
counterfactual deﬁniteness, it only has to account for the actual spatiotemporal
experimental conﬁguration and outcomes. Consequently, in the adynamical
explanation, we’re not concerned with counterfactual outcomes, i.e., BW patterns
that aren’t ‘there’. The BW patterns are 4D involving the experimental conﬁgu-
ration and process in its spatiotemporal entirety. Thus, in RBW the so-called
quantum systems cannot be separated from the experimental set-up, but must
include
it
(ontological
contextuality).
And,
the
quantum
exchange
of
energy-momentum occurs via direct action, meaning it can get from source to
detector without traversing the intervening space.
Price and Wharton may have said it best when they wrote [13]:
In putting future and past on an equal footing, this kind of approach is different in spirit
from (and quite possibly formally incompatible with) a more familiar style of physics: one
in which the past continually generates the future, like a computer running through the steps
in an algorithm. However, our usual preference for the computer-like model may simply
reﬂect an anthropocentric bias. It is a good model for creatures like us who acquire
knowledge sequentially, past to future, and hence ﬁnd it useful to update their predictions in
the same way. But there is no guarantee that the principles on which the universe is
constructed are of the sort that happen to be useful to creatures in our particular situation.
Physics has certainly overcome such biases before – the Earth isn’t the center of the
universe, our sun is just one of many, there is no preferred frame of reference. Now,
perhaps there’s one further anthropocentric attitude that needs to go: the idea that the
universe is as “in the dark” about the future as we are ourselves.
208
W.M. Stuckey et al.

The term “universe” in this quote is the model of objective reality per physics.
And we would clarify Price and Wharton’s claim that we need to abandon the
notion that “the universe is as ‘in the dark’ about the future as we are ourselves,” by
saying “the most explanatorily powerful model of objective reality uses future
boundary conditions that we, as dynamic creatures, experience conditionally as in
the mechanical universe rather than absolutely as in the block universe.” We now
introduce our speciﬁc form of adynamical explanation called the Relational
Blockworld (RBW).
RBW is a unique spatiotemporal form of ontological contextuality. Thus we
reject the idea that reality is ultimately composed of things, i.e., self-subsisting
entities, individuals or trans-temporal objects with intrinsic properties and “primi-
tive thisness,” haecceity, etc. Rather, contexts, constraints and relations are primary
while
relata
are
derivative,
thus
rejecting
“building
block”
atomism
or
Lego-philosophy. Relata inherit their individuality and identity from the structure of
relations such as the experimental set-up.
We do not claim there are relations without relata, just that the relata are not
individuals (e.g., things with primitive thisness and intrinsic properties), but always

Fig. 16.4 Quantum exchange of energy-momentum—The property Y is associated with the
source on the spacetimesource element (rectangle) shared by the worldtubes. As a result, property
Y disappears from Worldtube 1 (Y source) and reappears later at Worldtube 2 (Y detector) without
mediation. That is, there is no third worldtube/line needed to explain the exchange of
energy-momentum associated with property Y between Worldtube 1 and Worldtube 2. While
these properties are depicted as residing in the worldtubes, they don’t represent something truly
intrinsic to the worldtubes, but are ultimately contextual/relational, i.e., being the source of Y only
makes sense in the context of (in relation to) a “Y detector”, and vice versa. The A, B, R, and G

ultimately analyzable as relations as well (Fig. 16.4). RBW already somewhat
violates the dynamical bias by rejecting things with intrinsic properties as funda-
mental building blocks of reality – the world isn’t fundamentally compositional—
the deepest conception of reality is not one in which we decompose things into
other things at ever smaller length and time scales. The RBW ‘beables’, “space-
timesource elements,2” are certainly a violation of a compositional picture of realty,
since their properties are inherited from their classical context.3
For example, let Hardy’s experiment (Fig. 16.2) represent spin measurements
(Fig. 16.5) on a pair of spin entangled particles (Fig. 16.6) with the two settings 1
and 2 of the Mermin device (Fig. 16.2) for the Hardy experiment corresponding to
Stern-Gerlach magnet orientations X and Y (Figs. 16.5 and 16.6). Further, let the
Mermin device outcomes R and G correspond to spin measurement outcomes “up”
and “down,” respectively. The spacetimesource element for any particular trial to
include outcomes is constructed as in Fig. 16.7 (21RG there) and a corresponding
probability amplitude is computed using the path integral without reference to
counterfactuals. Each outcome represents a different spatiotemporal distribution of
mass/energy per this particular quantum exchange, and the probability amplitude
squared gives the relative probability of occurrence. The RBW rule for computing
the action in the path integral for the probability amplitude is an AGC [14]. Thus,
we go even further in rejecting dynamism, not merely because it is a BW, but
Fig. 16.5 Reproduced from Serway and Jewitt, Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Brooks/Cole

Stern-Gerlach magnet are said to have spin “up.” Those deﬂected towards the south magnet pole
are said to have spin “down”
2The term “source” is used here in the quantum ﬁeld theory context, i.e., it refers to sources and
sinks of energy/momentum. We should note that these beables don’t exist autonomously from
measurement as Bell conceived of them.
3By “classical context” we mean the model of objective reality obtained using classical physics,
e.g., general relativity.

because the fundamental AGC is not a dynamical law or even spacetime symme-
tries. The AGC constrains the probability amplitude for our beables, i.e., space-
timesource elements, which are spatiotemporal 4D ontological entities. For example
in the twin-slit experiment, the spatiotemporal distribution of detector clicks is in
accord with the distribution of spacetimesource elements per the probability
amplitude obtained in accord with the AGC. To be clear, a spacetimesource element
is not in spacetime, it is of spacetime, even while a distribution of detector clicks is
viewed in the classical spacetime context of the experimental equipment and pro-
cess from initiation to termination.
RBW gives Rickles and Bloom exactly what they are looking for in the fol-
lowing [15]:
While the basic idea defended here (a fundamental ontology of brute relations) can be
found elsewhere in the philosophical literature on ‘structural realism’, we have yet to see
the idea used as an argument for advancing physics, nor have we seen a truly convincing
argument, involving a real construction based in modern physics, that successfully evades
the objection that there can be no relations without ﬁrst (in logical order) having things so
related.
As they say in the following passage, this idea has the potential to re-ground
physics, dissolve current quagmires and lead to new physics [15]:
Viewing the world as structurally constituted by primitive relations has the potential to lead
to new kinds of research in physics, and knowledge of a more stable sort. Indeed, in the past
those theories that have adopted a broadly similar approach (along the lines of what
Einstein labeled ‘principle theories’) have led to just the kinds of advances that this essay
competition seeks to capture: areas “where thinkers were ‘stuck’ and had to let go of some
cherished assumptions to make progress.” Principle theory approaches often look to general
‘structural aspects’ of physical behaviour over ‘thing aspects’ (what Einstein labeled
‘constructive’), promoting invariances of world-structure to general principles.
Rickles and Bloom lament the fact that views such as ontological structural
realism have yet to be so motivated and they further anticipate RBW almost per-
fectly when they say [15]:
The position I have described involves the idea that physical systems (which I take to be
characterized by the values for their observables) are exhausted by extrinsic or relational
properties: they have no intrinsic, local properties at all! This is a curious consequence of
background independence coupled with gauge invariance and leads to a rather odd picture
in which objects and [spacetime] structure are deeply entangled. Inasmuch as there are
objects at all, any properties they possess are structurally conferred: they have no reality
outside some correlation. What this means is that the objects don’t ground structure, they
are nothing independently of the structure, which takes the form of a (gauge invariant)
correlation between (non-gauge invariant) ﬁeld values. With this view one can both evade
the standard ‘no relations without relata’ objection and the problem of accounting for the
appearance of time (in a timeless structure) in the same way.
For example, consider the particle tracks in a high energy physics detector. The
tracks are worldlines, so they constitute what we mean by time-evolved “classical
objects” and each worldline can be deduced one detection event (click) at a time in
succession using ψ(x, t), as shown by Mott for alpha particles in a cloud chamber [16].
212
W.M. Stuckey et al.

Therefore, a probability amplitude could be computed for each worldline using
spacetimesource elements detection event by detection event with each click providing
empirical evidence of an otherwise unobservable, underlying spacetimesource element.
However, as shown by Mott, after the ﬁrst click the remaining clicks follow a classical
trajectory with high probability, so the only real quantum computation needed is for the
probability amplitude of the spacetimesource element of the set of ﬁrst clicks, i.e., the
ﬁrst click for each worldline in the collection (again, a single spacetimesource element
can have many components and represent many detection events and still be considered
a unity, see Fig. 16.7). And, the properties (mass, charge, momentum, energy, etc.) for
that spacetimesource element would simply be the properties of the subsequent
worldlines (particles) deﬁned relationally in the classical context of the accelerator
source and particle detector. Basically, we are claiming that the worldtube of any
particular classical object in space and time (deﬁned relationally by its surrounding
classical objects) can be decomposed into spacetimesource elements of space, time, and
sources organized per an AGC using the context of those surrounding classical objects.
Accordingly, a particle physics detector event is one giant interference pattern
(interference a la RBW), and the way to understand a particular pattern involving
thousands of clicks can only realistically be accomplished by parsing an event into
smaller subsets, and the choice of subsets is empirically obvious, i.e., spacetime
trajectories. These trajectories are then characterized by mass, spin, and charge. Per
RBW’s adynamical explanation, the colliding beams in the accelerator and the
detector surrounding the collision point form the graphical input that, in conjunc-
tion with the AGC, dictate the spacetime distribution of conﬁgurations of space-
timesource elements responsible for particle trajectories.
This severely undermines the dynamical picture of perturbations moving through
a continuum medium (naïve ﬁeld) between sources, i.e., it undermines the naïve
notion of a particle as traditionally understood. In fact, the typical notion of a
particle is associated with the global particle state of n-particle Fock space and per
Colosi and Rovelli [17] “the notion of global particle state is ambiguous, ill-deﬁned,
or completely impossible to deﬁne.” What we mean by “particle” is a collection of
detector hits forming a spacetime trajectory resulting from a collection of ady-
namically constrained spacetimesource elements in the presence of colliding beams
and a detector. And this doesn’t entail the existence of an object with intrinsic
properties, such as mass and charge, moving through the detector to cause the hits.
Our view of particles agrees with Colosi and Rovelli on two important counts.
First, that particles are best modeled by local particle states rather than n-particle
Fock states computed over inﬁnite regions, squaring with the fact that particle
detectors are ﬁnite in size and experiments are ﬁnite in time. The advantage to this
approach is that one can unambiguously deﬁne the notion of particles in curved
spacetime as excitations in a local (ﬂat) region, which makes it amenable to Regge
calculus (graphical version of general relativity). Second, this theory of particles is
much more compatible with the quantum notion of complementary observables in
that every detector has its own Hamiltonian (different sized graph with different
properties), and therefore its own particle basis (unlike the unique basis of Fock
16

space). Per Colosi & Rovelli [17], “In other words, we are in a genuine quantum
mechanical situation in which distinct particle numbers are complementary
observables. Different bases that diagonalize different HR [Hamiltonian] operators
have equal footing. Whether a particle exists or not depends on what we decide to
measure.” Thus, in our view, particles simply describe how detectors and sources
are relationally co-deﬁned via RBW’s adynamical global constraint.
In conclusion, RBW takes the Minkowskian fusion of space and time one step
further by incorporating sources in its fundamental ontological entity, the 4D
spacetimesource element. This results in a form of Wharton’s Lagrangian Schema
explanation governed by a fundamental adynamical global constraint, rather than
Smolin’s Newtonian Schema explanation of laws governing the behavior of
time-evolved entities. In RBW, ontological contextuality is fundamental just as
envisioned by Bohr and Wheeler. But unlike them, we have shown how to dispense
with realism about the wavefunction along with all the problems it brings. In RBW,
there is no measurement problem and no violation of locality. While it remains to
be seen whether or not RBW is too radical a departure from the Newtonian Schema
Universe, it seems certain that quantum nonlocality in general will entail a serious
revision of our Newtonian mechanistic worldview. So, we close with this quote by
Bertlmann [18]:
I have a confession: I am not the realist one might expect after reading Bell’s article
“Bertlmann’s socks and the nature of reality”; the world in its very foundations is much
more abstract than we think with our “anschauliche” (intuitive) concepts, to borrow Werner
Heisenberg’s term. My personal feeling is that Bell’s theorem, which reveals an apparent
nonlocality in nature, points to a more radical conception whose onset we do not yet have.

Spacetime Is Doomed
George Musser
17.1
Space as Order
Theoretical physicists have not wanted for imagination when it comes to devel-
oping a quantum theory of gravity. String theory, loop quantum gravity, causal-set
theory, twistor theory: the approaches are diverse and the disagreements among
their proponents are often vehement. And yet they have a common feature: that
classical spacetime is not a fundamental ingredient of the world, but a construction
consisting of more fundamental degrees of freedom. Those degrees of freedom
become structured in very speciﬁc ways to give rise to the observed features of
classical spacetime.
This is a radical shift in our conception of physics and its implications have yet
to be fully assimilated. Nearly every physicist and philosopher from Democritus
onward has assumed that space is the deepest level of physical reality. Just as the
script of a play describes what actors do on stage, but presupposes the stage, the
laws of physics have traditionally taken the existence of space as a given. (The
same is true for time, but most of the approaches I will discuss treat space and time
asymmetrically.) Space serves as the organizing principle of the natural world—the
glue that binds the universe together, as the English physicist Julian Barbour has put
it.1 Physical objects do not interact willy-nilly; their behavior is dictated by how
they are related to one another, which depends on where they lie in space at a given

time. This structuring role is easiest to see in the classical laws of mechanical
motion, but also occurs in ﬁeld theories. The value and rate of change of a ﬁeld at
different points in space fully determine what the ﬁeld does, and points in the ﬁeld
interact only with their immediate neighbors.
What the candidate quantum theories of gravity do, in effect, is to invert this
reasoning. Instead of saying that space brings order to the world, they say that the
world is ordered and space is a convenient notion for describing that order. We
perceive that things affect one another in a certain way and, from that, we assign
them locations in space. The nice thing about deﬁning space in terms of structure is
that it sidesteps some of the long-running philosophical disputes over the nature of
space. The ancient atomists (and, later, Newton) conceived of space as a thing in its
own right, whereas Aristotle (and, later, Leibniz) deemed it an abstraction that
describes how the contents of the universe are packed together. Either way, though,
space reﬂects a structure that the natural world possesses. If the atomists were right
and space has an independent existence, it must be highly ordered, like a neatly
woven fabric, so that it can serve the functions that physics demands of it. If space
is merely an abstraction, then the contents of the universe must ﬁt together in just
the right way to give meaning to the abstraction.
Consider, for example, causal-set theory. Theorems in general relativity theory
show that you can map out the entire world from its web of cause-effect relations—
you could put everything in the right place just by knowing what has to give rise to
what.2 (Technically, the web of relations does leave some ambiguity: its tells you
that one event occurs earlier than another, but not how much earlier; it provides no
scale. But causal-set theorists argue that space and time already have a natural scale
if they are built up out of discrete units—“atoms” of space. Distance is then
determined by counting the number of such atoms.)3 The web of cause-effect
relations must be highly ordered if it is to re-create space and time. A generic causal
set does not correspond to a classical spacetime.4
17.2
Quantum Graphity
In many approaches, space is modeled as a network. The concept of space as a
network goes back to the 1960s and the brainstorms of such theorists as John
Wheeler, David Bohm, Roger Penrose, and David Finkelstein.5 Wheeler, for one,
imagined taking a bucket of “dust” or “rings”—primitive grains of matter that do

not exist within space, but simply exist—and stringing them together to form space.
More recently, Fotini Markopoulou and her colleagues developed a toy model of
the stringing-together process, an approach they call “quantum graphity.” Quantum
graphity does not specify what the Wheelerian grains actually are—that is a job for
a full-up theory of quantum gravity such as loop quantum gravity or string theory.
Quantum graphity is a theory-in-miniature that focuses narrowly on what you might
build with those grains.6
Indeed, Markopoulou and her colleagues’ philosophy is that the detailed com-
position should not matter; the principles of organization should be universal. After
all, physicists have found that similar rules govern a huge diversity of complex
systems, from earthquakes to ecosystems to economies.7 On the downside, quantum
graphity is so bare-bones that it faces the problem of meshing with known physics.
The links between the elementary grains are as simple as can be. Two grains are
either connected to each other or not, like Facebook users who can either be friends
or not—just an on-or-off relationship. The resulting network looks like a string-art
craft project in which you hammer nails (representing the grains) into a sheet of
wood and stretch threads (the links) among some of them. Despite the simplicity of
its construction, the network can take on a huge variety of shapes, ranging from
skeletal outlines to elaborate mandalas.
To breathe life into the network—to give it the capacity to transform and evolve—
Markopoulou and her colleagues suppose that the links switch on or off depending on
the amount of available energy. This process is ad hoc, but again the goal is not to
create a bulletproof theory, but to reconnoiter possibilities for how to construct space.
Each link represents a certain amount of energy. Chains of links contain less energy
than an equivalent number of isolated links, so the total energy of a network depends
not only on the sheer number of links, but also on how they are put together. The more
intricate the pattern is, the more energy it embodies.
The energy maxes out in a fully interconnected network, where every grain is
linked to every other grain. In such a network, the principle of locality does not
hold; you can go from any grain to any other grain in one hop, without passing
through any intermediate points. The network lacks the hierarchy of relations—near
versus far, small versus big—which is characteristic of space. You cannot subdivide
it into separate chunks; it is an indivisible whole.
To see why the high-energy network is not spatial, try assigning locations to the
grains. Every grain has to be equidistant (a single hop) from every other. For the ﬁrst
three grains, that is no problem: arrange them in an equilateral triangle. Four can be
stacked in a pyramid. But where does a ﬁfth go? There is nowhere equidistant to the
ﬁrst four points, at least not within ordinary, three-dimensional space. You need a
four-dimensional pyramid. In fact, each additional grain requires a whole new
dimension of space. Before long, you enter an ultra-higher-dimensional realm beyond
our capacity to visualize. And most of that vast venue is wasted: the network is only

one hop wide in any direction and does a good impression of a balled-up spider’s web.
So although you might still talk of the network as existing within space, it is not the
kind of space we want: three dimensions that extend as far as we can see in every
direction and that provide an economical description of the relations among objects.
Lower-energy patterns are a different story. They’re just what we want. Each
grain connects to just a few others, forming a regular grid like a honeycomb or
woven fabric. The notion of distance regains meaning: some grains are close
together, the rest far apart. The network is nice and roomy. The principle of locality
holds: for an inﬂuence to go from one place to another, it cannot hop straight there,
but must work its way through the network. The passage of the signal takes time,
which would explain why the speed of objects through space is limited (by the
speed of light).8
In short, spacelessness and space are just two different phases of the same
network of grains. One can metamorphose into the other; a crumpled wad can
unfurl into a ﬂat expanse. Theorists have proposed a couple of ways this might
happen. The reshaping could be a process that occurs in time. The network starts off
as sizzlingly hot—a highly interconnected pattern containing an enormous amount
of energy. Then it cools off and crystallizes like a tray of water freezing to ice, as
links dissolve and reorganize to create a tidy arrangement. The trick is to explain the
cooling. Things do not just cool down on their own; something must drain them of
heat. Markopoulou and her colleagues have speculated that the energy could go into
the creation of matter. The primordial grains could coalesce into elementary
particles, so that matter emerges hand in hand with space.
Alternatively, the transition may not be a process that unfolds in time, but a
structuring that arises at the quantum level. The network can exist in multiple
conditions at once, a limbo known as superposition. Although most of those con-
ditions are nonspatial, they can fuse together into something that is spatial. The
best-developed account of superposition of space goes by the somewhat unwieldy
name of “causal dynamical triangulations.” Its inventors have shown that nonspatial
geometries neutralize one another, as long as events are highly ordered, with a
distinction between cause and effect built in from the outset.9
17.3
Matrix Models
String theorists have explored ideas similar to quantum graphity. In the 1990s they
pioneered “matrix models.” A matrix in the mathematical sense has nothing to do
with the virtual-reality “matrix” of the movie The Matrix, yet the premise is eerily
similar: the world we experience is a kind of simulation generated by a deeper level
8Hamma and Markopoulou, “Background-Independent Condensed Matter Models for Quantum
Gravity.”

of reality. The best-known matrix model was developed by a quartet of theorists,
Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Steve Shenker, and Leonard Susskind.10 Their model,
like quantum graphity, supposes that the universe is a cat’s cradle of intercon-
nections among grains of primitive matter. Under the right conditions, extraneous
connections rupture and the grains snap into a regular spatial grid.
String theory outgrew its name long ago. It postulates not just one-dimensional
strings, but also two-dimensional membranes and higher-dimensional analogues—
as theorists call them, 1-branes, 2-branes, 3-branes, 4-branes, and so on. Some
branes, designated by D, can act as the endpoints of strings.11 At the bottom of this
pecking order is the humble D0-brane, a type of particle. Being a true geometric
point lacking size or any other spatial attribute, the D0-brane is the perfect building
block for space. Conﬁrming this intuition, theorists calculate that the D0-brane has
the right properties to serve as the graviton, the particle that has been hypothesized
for decades to convey the force of gravity.
Matrix models take this particle as fundamental and construct the universe
entirely from lots of them. Every particle can interact with every particle, and their
interactions are not simply on or off, but can vary in strength and in quality. The
more energy you inject into a pair of particles, the tighter their bond will become.
The namesake matrix of numbers quantiﬁes this web of interactions. For example,
if you read down to the eighth row and then across to the twelfth column, the
number there will tell you how strongly particle number eight interacts with particle
number twelve. To express not just the raw strength but also the quality of the
connection, you need several such matrices.
Each matrix is a square, and running diagonally from the top left corner to the
bottom right is a special set of numbers—where the eighth row meets the eighth
column, the twelfth row meets the twelfth column, and so on. These tell you how much
each particle interacts with itself. Self-interactions are a core feature of matrix models.
The particles are subatomic narcissists, the physics equivalent of Facebook users who
always “Like” their own posts. Their self-interactions have a carefree, unrestrained
quality; you can dial their strength up or down without having to pump in energy.
Whereas the workings of quantum graphity are somewhat ad hoc, the laws
governing D0-branes are dictated by considerations of symmetry. The mathematical
balance of the equations is the organizing principle of this model. Symmetry
ensures that the off-diagonal values in the matrix are yoked to the diagonal values—
in
other
words,
that
the
branes’
mutual
interactions
depend
on
their
self-interactions. Particles that self-interact by comparable amounts forge a bond,
whereas particles with differing levels of self-interaction remain aloof. Put simply,
like attracts like. Consequently, the branes agglomerate into separate clusters like
the social circles in your Facebook network. These clusters constitute the ordinary

17

subatomic particles of physics. Each cluster can be compactly described by a few
numbers—namely, the strength and quality of its constituents’ self-interactions.12
That is how space arises in matrix models. The D0-branes do not live or move
within space. Mathematically they all sit on top of one another at a single point. But
because they are so selective about their interactions, they produce our experience
of living within space. What we call “position” is simply the set of numbers that
uniquely identiﬁes a given cluster. It’s like pigeonholing your friends as “physics
lovers,” “Radiohead groupies,” or “Cuban-style dancers.”
That is just the start. You can take all our familiar spatial notions—movement,
size, locality—and explain them in terms of brane dynamics. Movement: things
shift their position because the D0-branes’ self-interactions are varying. It’s like
saying the Cuban dancers suddenly all get interested in Dominican music. They
“move” as a group to a new passion. Such movement may sound metaphorical, but
in matrix models it is the origin of physical movement. Size: the self-interactions of
the branes in an object are not exactly equal, but have a slight spread, so that the
object spans a range of positions. Locality: clusters at separate locations are inde-
pendent because their self-interactions differ, which suppresses their mutual inter-
actions according to the logic of symmetry. This is like saying that Cuban dancers
and Radiohead groupies never have much to say to each other.
Another departure from spatiality occurs inside clusters. The internal group
dynamics are intense and every brane is interacting with every other. The branes
scramble one another’s self-interactions, and the matrix values representing those
interactions lose the qualities of spatial coordinates. Ordinarily, coordinates are
independent numbers: you can measure the latitude of a city separately from its
longitude. But you cannot do that for branes within a cluster. If you measure the
latitude of a brane ﬁrst, then its longitude, you might get a different result than if
you measured the longitude, then the latitude. This kind of ordering effect is known
mathematically as “noncommutativity.” In effect, the particle seems to be located in
two different places, like Salt Lake City in my cities example. The degree of
ambiguity is a measure of just how nonlocal and nonspatial the system is.
Indeed, the cluster does not really have an “inside”—there is no volume of space
where the D0-branes bustle around. Arguably there are not even any D0-branes
anymore, either, because they surrender their individuality and become assimilated
into the collective. If you look at a cluster from the outside, what you see is not the
outer surface of a material thing, but the end of space; and if you poke your hand
into the cluster, you will not reach into its interior, for the cluster has no interior.
Instead, your hand will become assimilated, too (which can’t be good for it). If you
wisely refrain from touching the cluster and instead throw particles into it, you will
notice that the cluster’s storage capacity depends on its area rather than on its
interior volume—again, for the simple reason that it does not actually have an
interior volume. Space has no meaning at this level.

17.4
Noncommutative Geometry
Some theorists such as Michael Heller have developed noncommutativity into a
stand-alone theory called noncommutative geometry, which is a slightly ironic
name: the aim is actually to do away with geometry and describe the universe as a
big algebraic equation. The equation is formulated in terms of matrices, like those
of matrix models, but given a new interpretation. The matrices are no longer arrays
of numbers describing the connections among building blocks such as D0-branes,
but individual entities in their own right, the primary ingredients from which
everything else is made.
In concrete terms, those pursuing this approach take a top-down view of physics,
in which global structures—ones that span the entire universe—are fundamental,
and local geometric concepts such as “points” and “things” derive from those global
structures, rather than the usual bottom-up view in which the universe is built from
zillions of localized things. By analogy, imagine that instead of deﬁning society as
millions of individuals who assemble into sundry groups, we deﬁne it as millions of
groups and identify each individual as a bundle of group memberships. (This isn’t so
far-fetched: philosophers and sociologists such as Hegel have argued that individual
identity is constructed largely from social identity.13 You could draw a big Venn
diagram of groups and every person would be the unique intersection of some set of
circles. For this top-down deﬁnition to work, groups must overlap in just the right
way. If they don’t, individuals lose their distinct identity; you’d get more than one
person with the same set of group identities and be unable to tell them apart.
Something like this could happen with the global structures of noncommutative
geometry. Under the right conditions, these structures interlock to produce a spatial
universe governed by the usual laws of physics. Under other conditions, they do not
—and their imperfect meshing would produce nonlocal phenomena such as
entangled particles. If two distinct objects are merely different mixes of the same
global entities, it stands to reason that they can retain a connection that transcends
space. What happens in one place will be sensitive to what happens elsewhere, even
without any communication in an ordinary sense.14
17.5
AdS/CFT Duality
Matrix models do have some peculiarities, but they establish a remarkable princi-
ple: a bunch of particles obeying quantum physics can organize themselves so that
you would swear they live and move within space, even if space was not in the

original speciﬁcation of the system. And it turns out that this principle is very
general. Not just a swarm of D0-branes but almost any quantum system contains
spatial dimensions folded inside it like a ﬁgure in a pop-up book. Most such
systems do not bootstrap space from utter spacelessness, as matrix models do, but
prime
the
pump
with
a
low-dimensional
space
in
order
to
generate
a
higher-dimensional one.
The AdS/CFT duality developed by Juan Maldacena is such a system. It starts
with a three-dimensional space and generates a nine-dimensional one. One reason
string theorists like this scenario so much is that it neatly explains the holographic
principle, the idea that the universe can sustain much less complexity than the
principle of locality would lead you to expect. The complexity is reduced by just the
amount you would expect if one of the dimensions of space were illusory. In the
AdS/CFT scenario, that is because the dimension in question is illusory. It can be
collapsed down like an accordion because it was never really there. (“Illusory” is
perhaps the wrong word. “Derived” or “constructed” would be better, if less poetic.
The dimension may not exist at the lowest level, but it is still very real to anything
larger than a brane.)
The disposable dimension reﬂects a particular aspect of order in the underlying
quantum system. In fact, the requisite order is familiar to us from everyday life—
speciﬁcally, the fact that big things and small things live as if in worlds apart. Our
planet trundles around its orbit oblivious to human affairs, just as we spare little
thought for the bacteria that lodge in our skin. Conversely, we have only a vague
awareness of riding on a giant ball of rock, and bacteria know nothing of our daily
struggles. Nature is stratiﬁed by scale.
Sound waves are an especially simple example of this stratiﬁcation. Sounds of
long and short wavelengths are oblivious to each other; if you sound a deep bass
note and a high treble pitch simultaneously, each ripples through the room as
though it were the only sound in the world. Their mutual independence is analogous
to the autonomy of spatially separated objects. Suppose you play two piano keys,
middle C and the adjoining D key. The C key creates a sound wave with a
wavelength of 1 m 32 cm, and D produces one with a wavelength 14 cm shorter.
These waves overlap in the three dimensions of space through which they propa-
gate, yet they are independent of each other, as if they were located in different
places. In a sense, you can think of the sound waves as residing 14 cm apart within
a fourth spatial dimension.
The farther apart the keys are on a piano keyboard, the farther apart they are
within this imaginary dimension; a given distance along the keyboard translates into
a given distance within the dimension. You do not see this dimension as such; to
you, it is an abstraction that captures the acoustical independence of sound waves.
But it is a remarkably ﬁtting abstraction. Musicians call the difference between
pitches a musical “interval,” which has connotations of distance, as if our brains
really do think of the differences between pitches as spatial separation. AdS/CFT
duality takes this abstraction literally and suggests that one of the dimensions of the
224
G. Musser

space we occupy represents the energy or, equivalently, the size of waves within the
underlying system15.
Things of different sizes are not strictly independent; they interact with things of
comparable size, and the effects can cascade from one scale to the next. Consider the
proverb of the nail: for want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe, the horse was
lost; then the knight, the battle, and the kingdom. A nail shortage in a single blacksmith
shop didn’t immediately cause the monarch’s downfall; it exerted its inﬂuence
indirectly, via systems of intermediate scales. Sound waves of different pitches can also
behave like this. A Chinese gong begins rumbling at a low pitch and gradually vibrates
at successively higher pitches.16 The necessity of propagating through scale explains
why spatial locality holds in the emergent dimension.17 What happens in one place
does not jump to another without passing through the points in between.
It is not automatic that the underlying quantum system would possess this kind
of hierarchical order. Just as a painting must be composed in just the right way to
produce the sense of depth, so must the system have a certain degree of internal
coherence to give rise to space. What ensures this cohesion is entanglement among
the system’s particles or ﬁelds. To produce space as we know it, those particles or
ﬁelds must be entangled by scale: each particle with its neighbor, each pair of
particles with another pair, each group with another group. Other patterns lead to
different geometries or systems that cannot be thought of as spatial at all. If the
system is less than fully entangled, then the emergent space is disjointed, and an
inhabitant of the universe would be trapped inside one region, unable to venture
elsewhere. Furthermore, several recent studies suggest you can start with the
constraints on entanglement and derive the general-relativistic equations for grav-
itation. On the face of it, entanglement seems to transcend space. Today, though,
physicists think it might be what creates space.18
17.6
Scattering Amplitudes
In 2013 Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka unveiled a geometric technique
for calculating probabilities, known in the jargon as “amplitudes,” for particle
processes. They gave their technique a suitably funky name: the “amplituhedron.”19
Based on the particles involved in a given process, you draw a polyhedron with one

vertex for each particle. For instance, if you have two incoming particles that create
four outgoing particles, you need a total of six vertices—a hexagon or one of its
higher-dimensional counterparts. The momentum of a particle sets the size of its
corresponding polyhedral face. Having formed this shape, you then calculate its
interior volume, and that quantity, by the rules of the procedure, equals the desired
amplitude.
The polyhedron is not a real object sitting in ordinary space but an abstract
mathematical shape that captures the structure of particles’ interactions. It subsumes
all the previous calculation techniques that physicists have used to compute
amplitudes, including Richard Feynman’s diagrams and Zvi Bern and his col-
leagues’ minimalist alternative20. These different techniques correspond to different
ways to carve up the polyhedron for purposes of calculating its volume. The
polyhedron also exhibits symmetries that nature possesses, but which theorists had
never glimpsed before.
This procedure does not presume that the process plays out in spacetime. The
locality we observe in daily life is a consequence of the way the faces ﬁt together—
speciﬁcally, that they form a closed shape, as opposed to disconnected planes.
Those six vertices link into a hexagon rather than, say, an asterisk. In general, the
faces will not ﬁt together; locality is therefore a special case. The main lesson, as
with the other approaches to emergent spacetime, is that space represents a type of
order in the world, one that you might not expect a priori.

Geometry and Physical Space
Mary Leng
Geometry as a branch of mathematics studies the properties of points, lines, planes,
solids, and their higher dimensional analogues. As applied to physical world,
geometry is the study of ﬁgures in three-dimensional physical space. Until the
mid-nineteenth century, ‘geometry’ meant Euclidean geometry, the axiomatic
theory that forms the basis for the plane geometry will be familiar to most with a
high school education, and the postulates on which this theory is based were
considered to be indubitable truths about physical points and lines. But with the
development of non-Euclidean geometries in the nineteenth century, mathemati-
cians began to distinguish between geometry as a theory of physical space and
geometries as theories of mathematical spaces. Doing so raises the question of the
status of geometry considered as a theory of physical space.
Euclid presented his geometry in the Elements (c. 300 BCE), which gathered
together and systematized the geometrical knowledge of the day. The presentation
is still the paradigm of an axiomatic theory. The Elements starts with 23 deﬁnitions,
ﬁve ‘common notions’ (essentially logical and arithmetical assumptions), and ﬁve
postulates (now more commonly known as Euclid’s axioms), as follows:
1. It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to another point.
2. It is possible to produce a ﬁnite straight line continuously in a straight line.
3. It is possible to describe a circle with any center and radius.
4. All right angles are equal to one another.
5. If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side
less than two right angles, the straight lines (if extended indeﬁnitely) meet on the side
on which the angles which are less than two right angles lie.

Of these axioms, the ﬁrst three can be thought of as idealized claims about what
can be done with a ruler and pair of compasses, if we assume that these instruments
could be arbitrary large. The fourth, though not about our constructing abilities, still
has a very basic and intuitive character that makes it seem appropriate as an axiom
rather than something in need of proof. The ﬁfth postulate (which is equivalent to
the claim that, given a straight line and a point not on that line, there exists one and
only one parallel line through that point), however, was long thought to be different
from the rest, looking much more like the theorems that can be proved on the basis
of these axioms than something so basic as to be axiomatic. So while mathemati-
cians had no doubt that all of these axioms were true of points and lines in physical
space, there were questions about the appropriateness of the ﬁfth axiom as an
axiom, and attempts were made to prove it from the other four.
A standard method of mathematical proof is proof by contradiction, or reductio
ad absurdum: we prove that a proposition P follows from a collection of
assumptions by deriving a contradiction (or absurdity) from those assumptions
together with the negation of P. So in trying to derive Euclid’s parallel postulate, a
reasonable approach to take would be to start by assuming the ﬁrst four axioms and
the negation of the parallel postulate, and show that this combination of assump-
tions leads to a contradiction. This approach was taken by many mathematicians
including Gerolamo Saccheri (1667−1733), who derived sufﬁcient bizarre seeming
consequences from the assumption that the parallel postulate was false that he
published his results under the title Euclides ab Omni Naevo Vindicatus (‘Euclid
Vindicated from All Faults’), declaring that parallel axiom as established [1].
However, Saccheri had not succeeded in proving a formal contradiction from the
negation of the parallel postulate, and mathematicians began to suspect that the
postulate was indeed independent of the other axioms. In the early 19th century
Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevsky independently came to the conclusion that the
assumption that, given a line and a point not on that line there is more than one
parallel line running through it, was logically possible (if not true of physical points
and lines). Later Gauss’s student Riemann explored the hypothesis that there are no
parallel lines, and again came to view this assumption as consistent. The inde-
pendence of the parallel postulate was ﬁnally established in 1868 by Beltrami,
whose ‘Essay on the Interpretation of non-Euclidean Geometry’ presented a model
for a two dimensional non-Euclidean geometry on a three dimensional Euclidean
surface (a pseudosphere). Before long, models had been given for both
Bolyai-Lobachevsky (or hyperbolic) geometry and Riemannian (or elliptic)
geometry, and it was clear that it was consistent to assume exactly one parallel
(Euclid—surfaces of zero curvature); more than one (Bolyai-Lobachevsky—sur-
faces of negative curvature) or no parallels (Riemann—surfaces of positive cur-
vature). Looking back on Saccheri’s book, it could be recognised that his supposed
absurdities derived when assuming the parallel postulate to be false were
straightforward theorems of these new non-Euclidean geometries.
The development of non-Euclidean geometries was of ground breaking impor-
tance in mathematics in allowing the distinction for the ﬁrst time between geometry
as the theory of mathematically possible spaces, and geometry as the theory of
232

physical space. As Michael Scanlan puts it, in a paper on the proof of the inde-
pendence of the parallel postulate, “In the past, mathematical practice did not
involve a distinction between theory and interpretation. In the eighteenth century,
mathematics was seen as the ‘abstract’ study of certain aspects of nature” [2].
Geometry was a body of truths about physical points and straight lines, and it could
reasonably be argued by Immanuel Kant that the truths of geometry are synthetic a
priori, substantial (not merely deﬁnitional) truths about physical space that are
knowable a priori through reﬂection on our intuition of the nature of our experience
of space. The development of non-Euclidean geometries, and their acceptance as
part of mathematics, brought to the fore the question of what the proper subject
matter of mathematics is. While it could be thought that the points and lines of
Euclidean geometry were just slightly idealized abstractions from the physically
inscribed points and lines of the diagrams used to convince us of Euclid’s proofs,
we now had new geometries, with their own terminology of ‘points’ and ‘lines’ but
with different assumptions about parallels. At most one could be true of (idealized)
points and lines in physical space, but all were equally good considered as math-
ematical theories. The distinction between mathematical spaces and physical space
was thus drawn, raising the question of the status of mathematical objects as
nonspatiotemporal abstracta.
What interests me here, though, is not so much the status of geometry as the
theory of mathematical spaces, but the status of geometry as a theory of physical
space. Even once the conceptual possibility of non-Euclidean geometries was
recognized, it remained in theory acceptable still to think that Euclidean geometry
was knowable a priori to be true as a theory of physical points and straight lines.
Beltrami’s and Klein’s models of non-Euclidean geometries showed the consis-
tency of these axiomatic theories by reinterpreting ‘point’ and particularly ‘straight
line’ to apply to things that were not, by our own lights, really straight lines. It
remained then possible to argue that, if by point we mean point in physical space,
and if by straight line we mean straight line in physical space, then the mere
consistency of alternative geometries should in no way shake our conﬁdence in the
truth of Euclid’s axioms when understood as a theory of physical points and lines.
But in fact, Scanlan tells us, “the mathematicians who originally conceived of
non-euclidean geometry, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and to some extend Gauss, seem all
to have conceived of the theory as one which is potentially applicable to physical
space” [2], and while our experience locally is Euclidean, the question was raised as
to whether on a large scale the Euclidean laws continue to hold. The story is told of
Gauss measuring the angles of the triangle formed by three mountain peaks looking
for evidence that on a large scale the angles did not add up to two right angles
(which is equivalent to the falsity of the parallel postulate), though it is unclear that
Gauss’s interest here was testing the possibility of curvature in space, as opposed to
effects on measurements due to the curvature of the earth’s surface. Lobachevsky,
however, explicitly conceived of a test of the geometry of space suggesting that one
might measure a stellar triangle consisting of the distant star Sirius together with
two different positions of the earth at six month intervals, to determine whether the
angles were as predicted in a Euclidean or non-Euclidean geometry (see [3], p. 15).

Geometry and Physical Space

For these mathematicians, then, the question of the correct geometry of physical
space was now an empirical matter, to be determined by experiment.
We now know that our best physical theory of space and time is general rela-
tivity, according to which spacetime has variable curvature (neither Euclidean, nor
elliptic, nor hyperbolic, all of which are geometric theories of constant curvatures).
One major conﬁrmation of this theory was via the measurement of distant stars. In
1919 the physicist Arthur Eddington travelled to the island of Principe, close to the
equator and just off the coast of western Africa, to photograph the solar eclipse of
29 May (see Kenneﬁck [4]). With the sun’s light dimmed by the eclipse, it was
possible to photograph positions of bright stars from the Hyades cluster beyond the
sun, and to achieve measurement results that are generally taken to have conﬁrmed
Einstein’s prediction of a space curved by the presence of the sun over Newton’s
assumed ﬂat Euclidean space.
Should we conclude, then, that the question of whether physical space is
Euclidean is an empirical one, answerable—and indeed answered in the negative—
by experiment? Henri Poincaré argued forcefully against this conclusion, and in
favour of the view that the question of the appropriate geometry of physical space is
not a priori or empirical but rather a matter of convention. Thus at the turn of the
twentieth century, Poincaré, well aware of the proposals for empirical tests of
geometrical hypotheses, though prior to the development and testing of general
relativity, could write:
If Lobatschewsky’s geometry is true, the parallax of a very distant star will be ﬁnite. If
Riemann’s is true, it will be negative. These are the results which seem within the reach of
experiment, and it is hoped that astronomical observations may enable us to decide between
the two geometries. But what we call a straight line in astronomy is simply the path of a ray
of light. If, therefore, we were to discover negative parallaxes, or to prove that all parallaxes
are higher than a certain limit, we should have a choice between two conclusions: we could
give up Euclidean geometry, or modify the laws of optics, and suppose that light is not
rigorously propagated in a straight line. It is needless to add that every one would look upon
this solution as the more advantageous. Euclidean geometry, therefore, has nothing to fear
from fresh experiments. [5]
According to Poincaré, then, the status of geometry as a theory of space is
neither a priori nor empirical, but conventional, simply a matter of how we deﬁne
our terms.
What, then, are we to think of the question: Is Euclidean geometry true? It has no meaning.
We might as well ask if the metric system is true, and if the old weights and measures are
false; if Cartesian co-ordinates are true and polar coordinates false. One geometry cannot be
more true than another; it can only be more convenient. Now, Euclidean geometry is, and
will remain, the most convenient [5].
In stating that, in the light of apparent experimental refutation we could choose
to alter our hypothesis that light propagates in straight lines rather than altering our
geometry, Poincaré’s discussion suggests that his conventionalism is simply an
application of what has become known as the Quine-Duhem thesis, the claim that,
given that no theoretical statement can be tested in isolation, but only against a
backdrop of further theoretical assumptions, it is always possible to hold on to any
234
M. Leng

statement in light of recalcitrant experience, simply by adjusting assumptions in our
background theory: “Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make
drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system.” (Quine [6], p. 43). But if
Poincaré’s claim is simply that we could redeﬁne our terms so that ‘straight line’
doesn’t mean ‘path taken by a light ray’, then this is not a terribly exciting form of
conventionalism: there would still be the empirical question of what paths light rays
take, and it would still be an empirical matter whether the paths taken by light rays
are best described by a Euclidean or a non-Euclidean geometry.
In fact, Poincaré’s conventionalism is about more than simply choosing our
terms, as is seen in a thought experiment he presents of a world enclosed within a
sphere with some rather peculiar properties. In this world, there is a property like
temperature, which varies according to the distance from the centre. If R is the
radius of the sphere and r the distance of a point in the sphere from the centre, the
temperature at this point is proportional to R2 −r2. Bodies in this world expand and
contract at a uniform rate according to changes in temperature, so that a rod that is a
metre long by our standards at the centre will get smaller and smaller as it is moved
away from the centre, approaching but never reaching zero (the world consists of all
points inside the sphere, but not the sphere’s boundary). Imagine a plane in this
sphere consisting of a great circle of the sphere (i.e. cutting through the centre and
with diameter R), and imagine an inhabitant starting at the centre of the plane with a
surveyor’s wheel with circumference 1 m. As they walk along a radius of the
sphere towards the edge, both they and their wheel will contract uniformly. To
them, they will feel as though their universe is unbounded of inﬁnite extent as
however many metres they travel they will be able to continue. From our per-
spective this is an error—the universe has ﬁnite bounds, but the strange behavior of
their measuring instruments mean that the inhabitants are unable to realise this. If
surveyors in Poincaré’s sphere universe continue to take measurements they will
conclude that they are living in a hyperbolic geometry of inﬁnite extent, whereas
from our perspective they are living in a Euclidean sphere with physical features
that affect their ability to measure.
On one reading of this picture, the possibility of the sphere world presents an
epistemic challenge to the claim that the question of the proper geometry of
physical space is an empirical matter. On this view, two accounts are available that
ﬁt the observed phenomena for the inhabitants within the sphere world. One holds
that they and their measuring instruments do not change size as they move around,
and that the geometry of their world is hyperbolic. The other holds that they and
their measuring instruments change size as they move around, and that the
geometry of their world is Euclidean. The inhabitants can’t choose between these
two hypotheses, so for them the question of the ‘true’ geometry of physical space
cannot be determined empirically (even though as a matter of fact the true geometry
is Euclidean). Poincaré’s own view, though, is that the lack of knowledge in this
case is not because the truth is out there but beyond the inhabitants’ grasp, but
rather, that there is nothing ‘out there’ to be known. The epistemic view of the
inhabitants’ predicament holds that there is a fact of the matter about whether their
measuring instruments shrink and grow as they move around or stay the same size,
18
Geometry and Physical Space
235

but that this fact is unavailable to the inhabitants. Poincaré, on the other hand, holds
that the question of whether the inhabitants shrink or not is itself not an empirical
matter, but dependent on a conventional choice for us to make about what we are
going to take as counting as ‘congruence’. There is no ‘God’s eye view’ which
determines what is really going on in this example. The two descriptions: the
measuring instruments stay the same size and the geometry is hyperbolic, and the
measuring instruments change in size and the geometry is Euclidean, are equally
good ways of describing the same basic facts. We can choose to deﬁne ‘congru-
ence’ in terms of the behaviour of measuring instruments (so that lengths that
measure the same when measured by a meter stick that has been transferred from
one to the other are counted as congruent), or we could choose to deﬁne it so that
measuring whether lengths are congruent depends on knowledge of their distance
from the centre. Each choice is a matter of conventional decision, and each leads to
a different conclusion about ‘the’ geometry of the space, so the question of which
geometry is correct turns out to be answered by conventional decision rather than
empirical investigation.
Poincaré’s picture can seem compelling once we consider that we too are in the
position of the sphere dwellers. We assume by and large that our measuring
instruments remain the same size as we move around in our universe, but an
alternative picture according to which we grow and shrink according to location
could also be made compatible with our observations. Should we, then, conclude
that the question of the correct geometry of physical space can only be made sense
of downstream of a conventional decision, and as such, is itself a matter of con-
vention rather than empirical fact? Despite the conventionalist elements of the
aforementioned ‘Quine-Duhem’ thesis, the empiricist response to this conven-
tionalist claim is actually to be found in the work of W.V. Quine. Poincaré’s
conventionalism depends on holding that there are some elements of our theories
that are purely conventional choices about how to set the meanings of terms, that
before we can measure and build theories we have to deﬁne our terms, and these
deﬁnitions are a matter of pure convention. Quine argues forcefully against this
picture, holding that in the web of beliefs that makes up our best empirically tested
theory of the world any element, including those that were originally introduced as
conventional deﬁnitions to get theorizing going, can be amended in the light of
recalcitrant experience. So even though decisions that may seem arbitrary or con-
ventional may need to be made to get theorizing going, those decisions can be
revised in the light of recalcitrant experience, making them as empirical as any
other elements of our theories. Thus, Quine writes,
The lore of our fathers is a fabric of sentences. In our hands it develops and changes,
through more or less arbitrary and deliberate additions and revisions of our own, more or
less directly occasioned by the continuing stimulation of our sense organs. It is a pale grey
lore, black with fact and white with convention. But I have found no substantial reasons for
concluding that there are any quite black threads in it, or any white ones [7].
In Quine’s view, then, the fact that conventional choices about how to use our
terms are made on the way to theorizing does not stop our theories—conventions
236

included—from being empirically tested as a package. Indeed, in special and
general relativity our previous assumptions about congruence and the behaviour of
measuring instruments are challenged; we now adopt a theory according to which
our measurements of length are relative to frame of reference (special relativity) and
relative to our location with respect to the distribution of mass in the universe
(general relativity). In Quine’s view, the success of the theoretical package that
includes these assumptions is conﬁrmation of the package as a whole. All truths
depend in part on the meaning of terms and in part on how the world is, but in this
respect, the claim (supported by general relativity) that the spacetime we inhabit has
a non-Euclidean geometry of variable curvature is as empirical as anything can be.

Introduction
In our contemporary world, we see ourselves immersed in a vast universe ﬁlled with
galaxies,blackholes,darkmatterandotheraspectsofourcosmologicalsurroundings.
Animportantaspecttoallofthisisthatweimagineourselvestobeinavariablycurved
four-dimensional space-time, as ﬁrst put forward by Einstein in his theory of general
relativity in 1916 [8]. In February of 2016, a century after Einstein’s paper appeared,
it was announced [1] by a large team of astronomers that gravitational waves were
ﬁrst detected by amazingly accurate sensors. This result produced headlines around
the world, as did the conﬁrmation of Einstein’s theory by Dyson, Eddington, and
Davidson in their celebrated eclipse paper [7] of 1920 showing that light was bent by
the gravitational attraction of the sun, as was predicted by Einstein. The measurement
of the bending of a speciﬁc star was 1.65′′, which compared favorably with Einstein’s
prediction of 1.75′′.
This four-dimensional space-time is a four-dimensional manifold with a Lorent-
zian metric which satisﬁes the Einstein ﬁeld equations. The question we want to
discuss in this essay is: what are abstract manifolds (four-dimensional or otherwise),
and how did this mathematical concept and its associated geometric ideas arise, so
that it could be used for modeling our universe as Einstein and so many others after
him have done?

The Origins of the Concept of a Manifold
The notion of a manifold is a relatively recent one, but the theory of curves and
surfaces in Euclidean three-space R3 originated in Greek mathematical culture. For
instance, the book on the study of conic sections by Apollonius [18] described math-
ematically the way we understand conic sections today. The intersection of a plane
with a cone in R3 generated these curves, and Apollonius showed moreover that any
plane intersecting a skew cone gave one of the three classical conic sections (ellipse,
hyperbola, parabola), excepting the degenerate cases of a point or intersecting straight
lines. This was a difﬁcult and important theorem at the time. The Greek geometers
studied intersections of other surfaces as well, generating additional curves useful
for solving problems and they also introduced some of the ﬁrst curves deﬁned by
transcendental functions (although that terminology was not used at the time), e.g.,
the quadratrix, which was used to solve the problem of squaring the circle (which
they couldn’t solve with straight edge and compass and which was shown many cen-
turies later not to be possible). See for instance Kline’s very ﬁne book on the history
of mathematics for a discussion of these issues [21].
Approximately 1000years after the major works by the Greek geometers,
Descartes published in 1637 [6] a revolutionary book which contained a fundamen-
tally new way to look at geometry, namely as the solutions of algebraic equations.
In particular the solutions of equations of second degree in two variables described
precisely the conic sections that Apollonius had so carefully treated. This new bridge
between algebra and geometry became known during the 18th and 19th centuries as
analytic geometry to distinguish it from synthetic geometry, which was the treatment
of geometry as in the book of Euclid [17], the methods of which were standard in
classrooms and in research treatises for approximately two millenia. Towards the end
of the 19th century and up until today algebraic geometry refers to the relationship
between algebra and geometry, as initiated by Descartes, as other forms of geome-
try had arisen to take their place in modern mathematics, e.g., topology, differential
geometry, complex manifolds and spaces, and many other types of geometries.
Newton and Leibniz made their major discoveries concerning differential and
integral calculus in the latter half of the 17th century (Newton’s version was only
published later; see [23], a translation into English by John Colson from a Latin
manuscript from 1671). Leibniz published his major work on calculus in 1684 [22].
As is well known, there was more than a century of controversy about priority issues
in this discovery of calculus between the British and Continental scholars (see, e.g.,
[21]). In any event, the 18th century saw the growth of analysis as a major force in
mathematics (differential equations, both ordinary and partial, calculus of variations,
etc.). In addition the variety of curves and surfaces in R3 that could be represented
by many new transcendental functions expanded greatly the families of curves and
surfaces in R3 beyond those describable by solutions of algebraic equations.
Moreover, a major development that grew up at that time, and which concerns
us in this paper, was the growing interaction between analysis and geometry. An
important ﬁrst step was the analytic description of the curvature of a curve in the

plane at a given point by Newton. This was published in Newton’s 1736 monograph
[23] mentioned earlier. In the text of this reference (in a section entitled “To ﬁnd
the quantity of curvature in any curve”) one ﬁnds the well-known formula for the
curvature of a curve deﬁned as the graph of a function y = f (x)
K P = ±

(19.1)
which one learns early on in the study of calculus. Curvature had been studied earlier
quite extensively by Huygens [19], and he computed the curvature of many explicit
curves (including the conic sections, cycloids, etc.). He did not use calculus, per
se, but he used limiting processes of geometric approximations that are indeed the
essence of calculus. Even earlier Apollonius had been able to compute the curvature
of a conic section at a speciﬁc point (see [18] and Heath’s discussion of this point).
The next development concerning analysis and geometry was the study of space
curves in R3 with its notion of curvature and torsion as we understand it today. This
work on space curves was initiated by a very young (16years old) Clairaut [5] in
1731. Over the course of the next century there were numerous contributions to this
subject by Euler, Cauchy, and many others, culminating in the deﬁnitive papers of
Frenet [11] and Serret [32] in the mid-19th century giving us the formulas for space
curves in R3 that we learn in textbooks today. Space curves were called “curves of
double curvature” (French: courbes à double courbure) throughout the 18th and 19th
centuries.
A major aspect of studying curves in two or three dimensions is the notion of the
measurement of arc length, which has been studied since the time of Archimedes,
where he gave the ﬁrst substantive approximate value of π by approximating the arc
length of an arc of a circle (see, e.g., [27]). Using calculus one was able to formalize
the length of a segment of a curve by the well-known formula


ds =
 b
a

(x′(t))2 + (y′(t))2dt,
if  is a curve in R2 parametrized by (x(t), y(t)) for a ≤t ≤b. The expression
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 in R2 or ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 in R3 became known as the
line element or inﬁnitesimal measurement of arc length for any parametrized curve.
What this meant is that a given curve could be approximated by a set of secants, and
measuring the lengths of the secants by the measurement of the length of a segment of
a straight line in R2 or R3 (using Pythagoras!), and taking a limit, gave the required arc
length. The line elements ds2 = dx2 + dy2 and d2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 expressed
both the use of measuring straight-line distance in the ambient Euclidean space as
well as the limiting process of calculus. We will see later how generating such a line
element to be independent of an ambient Euclidean space became one of the great
creations of the 19th century.

The concept of curvature of a curve in R3 was well understood at the end of the
18th century, and the later work of Cauchy, Serret and Frenet completed this set of
investigations begun by the young Clairaut a century earlier. The problem arose: how
can one deﬁne the curvature of a surface deﬁned either locally or globally in R3?
Euler recognized the difﬁculty of this problem, as we see from this quote of Euler’s
from his paper on curvature of surfaces from 1767, “Recherches sur la courbure des
surfaces” [9]:
In order to know the curvature of a curve, the determination of the radius of the osculating
circle furnishes us the best measure, where for each point of the curve, we ﬁnd a circle whose
curvature is precisely the same. However, when one looks for the curvature of a surface, the
question is very equivocal and not at all susceptible to an absolute response, as in the case
above. There are only spherical surfaces where one would be able to measure the curvature,
assuming the curvature of the sphere is the curvature of its great circles, and whose radius
could be considered the appropriate measure. But for other surfaces, one doesn’t know even
how to compare a surface with a sphere, as when one can always compare the curvature of a
curve with that of a circle. The reason is evident, since at each point of a surface there are an
inﬁnite number of different curvatures. One has to only consider a cylinder, where along the
directions parallel to the axis, there is no curvature, whereas in the directions perpendicular
to the axis, which are circles, the curvatures are all the same, and all other obliques sections
to the axis give a particular curvature. It’s the same for all other surfaces, where it can
happen that in one direction the curvature is convex, and in another it is concave, as in those
resembling a saddle.
In the quote above, we see that Euler recognized the difﬁculties in deﬁning cur-
vature for a surfaces at any given point. He does not resolve this issue in this paper,
but he makes extensive calculations and several major contributions to the subject.
In particular, he computes the curvatures at a point of the surface of the curves which
are the intersections of planes passing though a normal vector at the point with the
surface and ﬁnds what are now called the principal curvatures and the principal
directions of the surface at the given point.
19.3
Gauss and Intrinsic Differential Geometry
A major development at the beginning of the 19th century was the publication in
1828 by Gauss of his historic landmark paper concerning differential geometry of
surfaces, entitled Disquisitiones circa superﬁcies curvas [15]. The year before, he
published a very readable announcement and summary of his major results in [14],
and we shall quote from this announcement paper somewhat later, letting Gauss tell
us in his own words what he thinks the signiﬁcance of his discoveries is. For the
moment, we will simply say that this paper laid the foundation for doing intrinsic
differential geometry on a surface and was an important step in the creation of a
theory of abstract manifolds which was developed a century later.
Gauss deﬁned curvature κ of a surface S ⊂R3 to be the derivative of what is now
called the Gauss mapping, which maps a point on the surface to its unit normal vector,
which is a point on the unit sphere in R3. He showed ﬁrst that the curvature (now

19
The Geometry of Manifolds and the Perception of Space
243
called the Gaussian curvature) is the product of the Eulerian principal curvatures at
that point. This deﬁnition of curvature (either via the Gauss mapping or the product
of the principal curvatures) depends explicitly on the embedding of the surface in
R3. They both use the notion of the normal vector at the given point, which depends
very much on the embedding.
Suppose that the surface is described in terms of local coordinates (u, v), i.e.,
x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)
(19.2)
are three smooth functions that represent the surface parametrically, then the line
element
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2
in R3 induces a metric on the surface S of the form
ds2 = Edu2 + 2Fdudv + Gdv2,
(19.3)
where E, F, and G are functions of (u, v) obtained by differentiating the paramet-
rizing functions x(u, v), y(u, v), and z(u, v). One can use the line element ds2 on S
to measure the length of a curve on the surface, to measure the angle formed by two
intersecting curves on S, and to compute other geometric quantities.
The great achievement of Gauss in this paper was to show (his Theorema
Egregium) that the Gaussian curvature could be deﬁned in terms of the ﬁrst and
second derivatives of the coefﬁcients E, F, and G of the line element in (19.3), and
was thus independent of the embedding. A major motivation for Gauss’s work on
curvature in this paper were his parallel experimental geodesic measurements, which
were trying to estimate the curvature of the earth near Gttingen.
Gauss understood full well the signiﬁcance of his work and the fact that this was
the beginning of the study of a new type of geometry (which later generations have
called intrinisic differential geometry). We quote here from his announcement of his
results published some months earlier from pp. 344–345 of [14]:
These theorems lead us to consider the theory of curved surfaces from a new point of view,
whereby the investigations open to a quite new undeveloped ﬁeld. If one doesn’t consider
the surfaces as boundaries of domains, but as domains with one vanishing dimension, and
at the same time as bendable but not as stretchable, then one understands that one needs to
differentiate between two different types of relations, namely, those which assume the surface
has a particular form in space and those that are independent of the different forms a surface
might take. It is this latter type that we are talking about here. From what was remarked
earlier, the curvature belongs to this type of concept; and, moreover, ﬁgures constructed on
the surface, their angles, their surface area, their total curvature as well as the connecting of
points by curves of shortest length, and similar concepts, all belong to this class.
The results described in this short announcement (and the details in the much longer
Latin paper on the subject) formed the basis of most of what became modern differ-
ential geometry.

244
R.O. Wells Jr
An important point that we should make here is that Gauss did signiﬁcant exper-
imental work on measuring the curvature of the earth in the area around Göttingen,
where he spent his whole scientiﬁc career. This involved measurements over hun-
dreds of miles, and involved communicating between signal towers from one point
to another. He developed his theory of differential geometry as he was conducting
the experiments, and at the end of his announcement [14], he summarizes one of his
experiments to say that a geodesic triangle with the longest side 12 miles long has the
sum of its three angles measuring 2′′ greater that 180◦, indicating in a precise manner
the positive curvature of the earth near that triangle. It is interesting to compare these
experiments with those concerning the bending of light one century later and the
measurement of gravitational waves two centuries later.
19.4
Riemann’s Higher-Dimensional Geometry
In mathematics, we sometimes see striking examples of brilliant contributions or
completely new ideas that change the ways mathematics develops in a signiﬁcant
fashion. A prime example of this is the work of Descartes [6], which completely
changed how mathematicians looked at geometric problems. But it is rare that a single
mathematician makes as many singular advances in his lifetime as did Riemann
in the middle of the 19th century. In this section, we will discuss in some detail
his fundamental creation of the theory of higher-dimensional manifolds and the
additional creation of what is now called Riemannian or simply differential geometry.
However, it is worth noting that he only published nine papers in his short lifetime
(he lived to be only 40years old), and several other important works, including those
that concern us in this section, were published posthumously from the writings he left
behind. His collected works (including in particular these posthumously published
papers) were edited and published in 1876 and are still in print today [29].
Looking through the titles, one is struck by the wide diversity as well as the origi-
nality. Let us give a few examples here. In Paper I (his dissertation), he formulated and
proved the Riemann mapping theorem and dramatically moved the theory of func-
tions of one complex variable in new directions. In Paper VI, in order to study Abelian
functions, he formulated what became known as Riemann surfaces and this led to the
general theory of complex manifolds in the 20th century. In Paper VII, he proved the
Prime Number Theorem and formulated the Riemann Hypothesis, which is surely the
outstanding mathematical problem in the world today. In Paper XII, he formulated
the ﬁrst rigorous deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral (the Riemann integral) and applied
it to trigonometric series, setting the stage for Lebesgue and others in the early 20th
century to develop many consequences of the powerful theory of Fourier analysis.
In Papers XIII and XXII, he formulated the theory of higher-dimensional mani-
folds, including the important concepts of Riemannian metric, normal coordinates,
and the Riemann curvature tensor, which we will visit very soon in the paragraphs
below. Paper XVI contains correspondence with Enrico Betti leading to the ﬁrst

19
The Geometry of Manifolds and the Perception of Space
245
higher-dimensional topological invariants beyond those already known for two-
dimensional manifolds (that had been developed by Riemann in Papers I and VI).
His paper [31] (Paper XIII above) is a posthumously published version of a pub-
lic lecture Riemann gave as his Habilitationsvortrag in 1854. This was part of the
process for obtaining his Habilitation, a German advanced degree beyond the doctor-
ate necessary to qualify for a professorship in Germany at the time (such requirements
are still in place at most German universities today as well as in other European coun-
tries, e.g., France and Russia; it is similar to the research requirements in the US to
be qualiﬁed for tenure). This paper, being a public lecture, has very few formulas, is
at times quite philosophical and is amazing in its depth of vision and clarity. On the
other hand, it is quite a difﬁcult paper to understand in detail, as we shall see.
Before this paper was written, manifolds were all one- or two-dimensional curves
and surfaces in R3, including their extension to points at inﬁnity (which was devel-
oped as a part of projective geometry in the ﬁrst half of the 19th century). In fact,
some mathematicians who had to study systems parametrized by more than three
variables declined to call the parametrization space a manifold or give such a para-
metrization a geometric signiﬁcance. In addition, these one- and two-dimensional
manifolds always had a differential-geometric structure which was induced by the
ambient Euclidean space (this was true for Gauss, as well).
In Riemann’s paper [31], he discusses the distinction between discrete and con-
tinuous manifolds, where one can make comparisons of quantities by either counting
or by measurement, and gives a hint, on p. 256, of the concepts of set theory, which
was only developed later in a single-handed effort by Cantor. Riemann begins his
discussion of manifolds by moving a one-dimensional manifold, which he intu-
itively describes, in a transverse direction (moving in some type of undescribed
ambient “space”), and inductively, generating an n-dimensional manifold by mov-
ing an (n −1)-manifold transversally in the same manner. Conversely, he discusses
having a nonconstant function on an n-dimensional manifold, and the set of points
where the function is constant is (generically) a lower-dimensional manifold; and
by varying the constant, one obtains a one-dimensional family of (n −1)-manifolds
(similar to his construction above).
Riemann formulates local coordinate systems (x1, x2, ..., xn) on a manifold of
n dimensions near some given point, taken here to be the origin. He formulates a
curve in the manifold as being simply n functions (x1(t), x2(t), ..., xn(t)) of a single
variable t. The concepts of set theory and topological space were developed only later
in the 19th century, and so the global nature of manifolds is not really touched on by
Riemann (except in his later work on Riemann surfaces and his correspondence with
Betti, mentioned above). It seems clear on reading his paper that he thought of n-
dimensional manifolds as being extended beyond Euclidean space in some manner,
but the language for this was not yet available.
At the beginning of this paper Riemann acknowledges the difﬁculty he faces in
formulating his new results. Here is a quote from the second page of his paper
(p. 255):

246
R.O. Wells Jr
In that my ﬁrst task is to try to develop the concept of a multiply spread-out quantity [he
uses the word manifold later], I believe even more in being allowed an indulgent evaluation,
as in such works of a philosophical nature, where the difﬁculties are more in the concepts
than in the construction, wherein I have little experience, and except for the paper by Mr.
Privy Councilor Gauss in his second commentary on biquadratic residues in the Göttingen
Gelehrte Anzeige [1831] and in his Jubiläumsschrift and some investigations by Hebart, I
have no precedents I could use.
The paper of Gauss that he cites here [13] refers to Gauss’s dealing with the philo-
sophical issue of understanding the complex number plane after some thirty years of
experience with its development. We will mention this paper again somewhat later in
this paper. Hebart was a philosopher whose metaphysical investigations inﬂuenced
Riemann’s thinking. Riemann was very aware of the speculative nature of his theory,
and he used this philosophical point of view, as the technical language he needed
(set theory and topological spaces) was not yet available. This was very similar to
Gauss’s struggle with the complex plane, as we shall see later.
As mentioned earlier, measurement of the length of curves goes back to the Archi-
median study of the length of a circle. The basic idea there and up to the work of
Gauss was to approximate a given curve by a collection of straight line segments
and take a limit. The length of each straight line segment was determined by the
Euclidean ambient space, and the formula, using calculus for the limiting process,
became, in the plane for instance,


ds =
 b
a

(x′(t))2 + (y′(t))2dt,
where ds2 = dx2 + dy2 is the line element of arc length in R2. As we saw in
Sect.19.3, Gauss formulated in [15] on a two-dimensional manifold with coordi-
nates (p, q) the line element
ds2 = Edp2 + 2Fdpdq + Gdq2
(19.4)
where E, F, and G are induced from the ambient space. He didn’t consider any
examples of such a line element (19.4) that weren’t induced from an ambient Euclid-
ean space, but his remarks (see the quote above in Sect.19.3) clearly indicate that
this could be a ripe area for study, and this could well include allowing coefﬁcients
of the line element (19.4) being more general than induced from an ambient space.
Since Riemann formulated an abstract n-dimensional manifold (with a local coor-
dinate system) with no ambient space, and since he wanted to be able to measure the
length of a curve on his manifold, he formulated, or rather postulated, an independent
measuring system which mimics Gauss’s formula (19.4). Namely, he prescribes for
a given coordinate system a metric (line element) of the form
ds2 =
n

i, j=1
gi j(x)dxidx j,
(19.5)

19
The Geometry of Manifolds and the Perception of Space
247
where gi j(x) is, for each x, a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix, and he postulates
by the usual change of variables formula
ds2 =
n

i, j=1
˜gi j(˜x)d ˜xid ˜x j,
where ˜gi j(˜x) is the transformed positive deﬁnite matrix in the new coordinate system
(˜x1, ..., ˜xn).
Using the line element (19.4), the length of a curve is deﬁned by
l() :=
 b
a




n

i, j=1
gi j(x(t))dxi
dt (t)dx j
dt (t)dt.
(19.6)
The line element (19.5) is what is called a Riemannian metric today, and the 2-form
ds2 is considered as a positive deﬁnite bilinear form giving an inner product on the
tangent plane Tp(M) for p a point on the manifold M. This has become the basis for
almost all of modern differential geometry (with the extension to Lorentzian-type
spaces where gi j(x) is not positive deﬁnite, à la Minkoswki space). Riemann merely
says on page 260 of his paper (no notation here at all),
I restrict myself therefore to manifolds where the line element is expressed by the square
root of a differential expression of second degree.
Earlier he had remarked that a line element should be homogeneous of degree one
and one could also consider the fourth root of a differential expression of fourth
degree, for instance. Hence his restriction in the quote above.
The next step in Riemann’s paper is his formulation of curvature. This occurs on
a single page (p. 261 of [31]), It is extremely dense and not at all easy to understand.
Over time, however, it became understood by several generations of mathematicians,
and this became the basis for the work of Einstein.
We summarize brieﬂy what Riemann described on this page. He formulated the
notion of geodesic coordinates, i.e., coordinates (x1, . . . , sn), where the coordinates
are geodesics in the metric ds2 from (19.6), and he expanded the functions gi j in a
Taylor series at the origin and considered the second-order terms as a biquadratic
form
Q(x, dx) =

i jkl
ci jklxkxldxidx j,
(19.7)
and the coefﬁcients ci jkl had certain important symmetry properties and effectively
deﬁned the Riemannian curvature tensor written classically and still today as a tensor
of the form
Rρ
σμν.
How does one deﬁne such a curvature tensor for n-dimensional manifolds with a
Riemannian metric in a general coordinate system? In a quite short paper written in

248
R.O. Wells Jr
Latin for a particular mathematical prize in Paris in 1861, (Paper No. XXII) Riemann
provides the ﬁrst glimpse of the general Riemann curvature tensor. The purpose of
Riemann’s paper was to answer a question in the Paris competition dealing with the
ﬂow of heat in a homogeneous solid body.
Riemann’s ideas in these two papers were developed and expanded considerably
in the following decades in the work of Christoffel, Levi-Cevita, Ricci, Beltrami,
and many others. The main point of our discussion has been that Riemann created
on these few pages the basic idea of an n-dimensional manifold not considered as a
subset of Euclidean space and of the independent concept of a Riemannian metric and
the Riemannian curvature tensor. What is missing at this point in time is the notion
of a topological space on the basis of which one can formulate the contemporary
concept of an abstract manifold or an abstract Riemannian manifold.
19.5
Hermann Weyl: Prelude to the 20th Century
Other major developments in geometry that led to the study of abstract manifolds
in the 20th century, and which we won’t consider in any detail in this paper, are
the creations of complex geometry, transformations groups, set theory and topol-
ogy, among others. Complex numbers were called imaginary numbers (among other
appellations) in the centuries preceding the 19th century. This meant, in the eyes of
the beholders that these were not concrete real (or realistic) numbers (to use a pun!),
but were simply imaginary artifacts that had no real meaning, but were useful in the
way they arose as the would-be solutions of algebraic equations. Gauss, among oth-
ers, used these numbers extensively in his career, for instance in his ground-breaking
work on number theory early in his life, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae [12]. Only many
decades later did he make the case for a deﬁnitive geometric interpretation of what
we call complex numbers today in a brief paper [13], which was a commentary on
some of his earlier work on number theory and which Riemann cited earlier in this
paper as a philosophical work which was a guide for him. Gauss called these numbers
(for the ﬁrst time) complex numbers, with their real and imaginary parts representing
coordinates in a two-dimensional plane—the complex plane. Gauss pleads with his
readers to consider complex numbers and the complex plane to be considered as
a normal part of mathematics, not as something “imaginary” or “unreal.” It’s very
enlightening to read this quite readable short paper. Later in the century, Klein and
others started to consider complex solutions of homogeneous algebraic equations
and thus began the study of complex algebraic manifolds and varieties. Klein along
with Lie fostered the study of transformation groups, and the notion of manifolds as
quotients of such groups became an important development as well. See, for instance,
the very informative book by Klein [20] (ﬁrst published in 1928, but based on lec-
tures of Klein towards the end of the 19th century), which described most of the
developments in geometry in the 19th century in a succinct fashion.
The creation of set theory in the latter half of the 19th century was a singular
effort of Georg Cantor over several decades of work. The ﬁrst article in this direction

19
The Geometry of Manifolds and the Perception of Space
249
was published in 1874 [3]. He then published six major papers in the Mathematische
Annalen between 1879 and 1884, which established the basic tenets of set theory, and
laid the foundation for work in multiple directions for the next century and beyond,
in particular in logic and foundations of mathematics, as well as point set topology,
to mention a particular part of geometry related to our thesis in this paper (see his
collected works [4] for these papers).
After Cantor’s groundbreaking discovery (some aspects of which were very con-
troversial for quite some time) the notion of topological space evolved to its con-
temporary state as a set satisfying certain axioms concerning either neighborhoods
or open sets. This became the development of point set topology, which has its own
very interesting history, and we mention only the fundamental contributions of Frchet
in 1906 [10] (metric spaces, Frchet spaces, in particular in the inﬁnite-dimensional
setting) and Hausdorff in 1914 [16] (which, among other things, deﬁned speciﬁcally
Hausdorff spaces, one of many specialized types of topological spaces used often
in geometry today). In 1895 Poincaré launched the theory of topological manifolds
with a cornerstone paper called Analysis Situs [25], which was followed up by ﬁve
supplements to this work over the next 17years (see Vol. 6 of his collected works
[26] as well as a very nice translation of all of these topology papers of Poincaré
by John Stillwell [24]). This paper and its supplements became the foundation of
what is now called algebraic topology (following the pioneering work of Riemann
[30] on Riemann surfaces and Betti on homological invariants of higher-dimensional
manifolds [2]).
The ﬁnal step in our journey is the book by Hermann Weyl in 1913 [33] entitled
Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche, in which he gives the ﬁrst very speciﬁc deﬁni-
tion of an abstract manifold with more structure than a topological manifold (which
Poincaré and others had already investigated quite thoroughly). His motivation was
to give a better understanding of Riemann surfaces which transcended Riemann’s
original description as a multisheeted covering of the complex plane with branch
points of various kinds. Speciﬁcally, he considered a topological manifold of two
dimensions (locally homeomorphic to an open set in R2) which had a ﬁnite or count-
able triangulation and which had the additional property that there were coordinate
charts mapping to an open disk in the complex plane C whose transition functions on
overlapping coordinate charts were holomorphic. He showed how all of the previous
work on Riemann surfaces ﬁts into this new picture, and he proved a fundamental
existence theorem of global holomorphic or meromorphic functions on such surfaces,
utilizing the Dirichlet principle, that had been ﬁrst used by Riemann in his conformal
mapping theorem from his dissertation [28]. This deﬁnition of a topological man-
ifold with such additional structure became the model for all the various kinds of
manifolds studied in the following century up to the current time. This included, for
instance, differentiable (C∞) manifolds, complex manifolds of arbitrary dimension,
Riemannian manifolds, symplectic manifolds, and real-analytic manifolds, among
many others. Weyl knew that this was new territory, and like Gauss with intrin-
sic differential geometry, and Riemann with n-dimensional manifolds, he carefully
explained to his readers that he was introducing a new way of thinking. Here, in
Weyl’s own words, are what he thought about this ([33], p. V):

250
R.O. Wells Jr
Such a rigorous presentation, which, namely by the establishing of the fundamental concepts
and theorems in function theory and using theorems of the analysis situs which do not
just depend on intuitive plausibility, but have set-theoretic exact proofs, does not exist.
The scientiﬁc work that remains to be done in this regard may perhaps not be particularly
highly valued. But, nevertheless, I believe I can maintain that I have tried in a serious
and conscientious manner to ﬁnd the simplest and most appropriate methods that lead to the
asserted goal; and at many points, I have had to proceed in a different manner than that which
has become traditional in the literature since the appearance of C. Neumann’s classical book
“Lectures on Riemann’s theory of Abelian Integrals” (1865).
As we mentioned in the Introduction, Einstein’s paper utilizing a Riemannian
structure with a Lorentzian metric appeared in 1916. Almost immediately thereafter
in the summer of 1917, Hermann Weyl gave lectures in Zurich on Einstein’s theory,
which appeared in a book published by Springer soon thereafter. The book was
entitled, in German, Raum, Zeit, Materie, and its third edition appeared in 1919
[34] (an English edition, Space, Time, Matter, became available in 1950, Dover
Publications, New York, and is still available today). Weyl gave more mathematical
background for Einstein’s theory and had a major inﬂuence on the propagation of
Einstein’s ideas. Weyl considers arbitrary n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and
the corresponding theory of tensors on such a manifold. The global structure of such
a manifold is not discussed; he concentrates primarily on the local theory for varying
coordinate systems near a speciﬁc point.
If we jump almost a century later, we see that modern string theory considers the
four-dimensional space-time of Einstein, which we can denote by M4, as a basis for a
10-dimensional string-theoretic manifold. This is a four-dimensional space-time M4
with an additional compact three-dimensional complex manifold X3 (a Calabi–Yau
manifold) attached to M4 at each point, and which is extremely small relative to our
usual perception of space around us. See, for example, the very interesting exposition
of Shing-Tung Yau and Steve Nadis [35] for a discussion of this and with many
references to the string-theoretic literature. The notion of an abstract manifold, as ﬁrst
formulated by Hermann Weyl in 1913, is essential for this theory. It is also interesting
to note that Weyl’s book dealt with the important example of Riemann surfaces,
which were one-dimensional complex manifolds (with local holomorphic coordinate
systems) with speciﬁc global properties (for instance, connectivity, which Riemann
had initiated). This is, in fact, part of the nature of Calabi–Yau manifolds, which are
three-dimensionalgeneralizationsoftheonecomplex-dimensionalRiemannsurfaces
of Hermann Weyl, and which have speciﬁc global properties, which distinguishes
them from from other three-dimensional complex manifolds.

Paradox? the Mathematics of Space-Time
and the Limits of Human Understanding
Paul Ernest
There is a paradox in exploring space-time and the limits of human understanding
from the perspective of mathematics. For mathematics provides the language in
which theories of space-time are formulated and yet is understood to be outside of
space and time itself. Thus geometry is the science of space, and yet is itself beyond
space.
A second paradox is that the humanly created science of mathematics is widely
accepted to transcend the limits of human understanding and knowing. It expresses
truths that apply beyond and across all space and time, imposed on all rational
beings by logical necessity. But how can this be as mathematics is itself human
knowledge, and the history of its creation is there for all to see? How can it exceed
the knowledge capacities of its authors? In accounting for the relationships between
mathematics, space-time and the limits of human understanding I suggest a reso-
lution to these paradoxes. However, this requires the Promethean task of bringing
mathematics from heaven back down to earth.
20.1
Mathematics and Space-Time
Mathematics as the science of structure studies those structures underpinning space
and time. Inquiries into the space around us began with mensuration and geometry,
based on our actions in, and ideas about, the physical world. Mensuration addresses
practical problems concerning the measurement of objects in space, including
lengths, surface areas, volumes, capacities, etc. It was developed in Mesopotamia
and Ancient Egypt in the millennia before the Christian era. Deductive geometry
emerged around 500−600 years BCE (Before the Christian Era) in Ancient Greece,

reaching its high point in Euclid’s elegant and systematic text The Elements of
Geometry, compiled around 300 BCE. For nearly two millennia it was believed that
Euclid’s geometry described the true geometric properties of the physical world.
However, doubts emerged about the logical necessity of one of its basic assump-
tions, the parallel postulate, which states that there is one and only one parallel line
at a given distance from any other given line. Rejecting this postulate as a true
axiom led to the emergence of non-Euclidean geometries almost two centuries ago.
In these geometries the sum of the angles of a triangle is not 180° but greater (in
spherical geometries) or lesser (in hyperbolic geometries), showing that many
different geometries of space are possible. Further generalizations of geometry have
been developed, including projective geometry, topology, and ﬁnally set theory in
which all but the last vestiges of space are erased. Projective geometry studies what
is left invariant when shapes are projected onto a surface. Topology, also called
rubber sheet geometry, studies what is left unchanged when shapes are stretched
and distorted but not punctured or cut. Set theory is so abstract that the only
quasi-geometric ideas it models concern boundaries and their relations of con-
tainment, intersection and disjunction.
At the same time as geometry was emerging historically so too was astronomy,
with its models of the heavens and the movements of stars and planets. A great deal
of mathematics including trigonometry was developed to model heavenly motions
and make astronomical predictions. Trigonometry studies the properties of triangles
when one or two sides and angles are known. As well as in astronomy its appli-
cation in navigation has been very important for travel, trade and empire. So
mathematics has helped us conquer space including both the earth we live on and
the skies above and around us.
The role of time in mathematics is less straight-forward. Although written number
and calculation were developed for the purposes of trade and taxation, an important
application is in the marking and measurement of time for calendrical uses. These
include astronomic, ritual and social regulation functions. Some philosophers such
as Kant and Brouwer have suggested that the human experience of the passage of
time provides a basis for counting and numbers. The idea is that numerical suc-
cession (n followed n + 1) models the before-after ordering of time (tick followed
by tock). So one might say that time is included in mathematics in metaphorical
form, because any ordered sequence serves as an analogue for time. This includes the
sequence of Natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …) as well as mathematical proofs represented
as sequences of deductive steps D1, D2, D3, …, Dn, where the Ds stand for the n steps
in a mathematical proof of Dn.1 Proofs embody, in their progress towards the ﬁnal
result, directionality and development, an analogue of time.
A breakthrough in the treatment of space and time came with Descartes’
invention of coordinate geometry. This combines a number of spatial dimensions
1Each proposition Di, for 0 < i < n + 1, is deduced from Di-1 or other preceding propositions in
the proof, or is an axiom. Note that the same analogy applies to a calculation represented as t1, t2,
… , tn, where the ts are the successive terms in a calculation and tn is the ﬁnal answer.

with numerical measures along axes enabling the unique speciﬁcation of locations
(points), as well as lines and planes in mathematical space. For example, the
equation x = y describes the diagonal line that goes through points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3,
3), etc. If time is chosen as one of the axes, then time is represented graphically and
is explicitly related to other variables, such as distance from the origin (the central
point (0, 0) in the Cartesian plane), by means of algebraic equations.
The invention of the calculus by Newton (and Leibniz) provided a model of
dynamical functions representing speed, acceleration of bodies in space, etc., within
the framework of the Cartesian model of space-time. This allowed Newton to
formulate his important theories of motion and gravity. Einstein extended this
model to four dimensions to include both space and time, and by combining it with
the new non-Euclidean geometries was able to formulate his theories of relativity.
These are still accepted as the best current cosmological theories. The extension to
n-dimensional space enables the framework to represent avant garde developments
such as String Theory with its 11 dimensions. Of course mathematics is not limited
by ﬁnitude as the nearby physical world is, and the inﬁnite-dimensioned spaces of
mathematics are now part of the toolbox that science can employ to formulate new
theories of space-time.
Thus since its inception, mathematics has provided the conceptual framework
for physical theories of space-time. Indeed these cosmological theories from Ptol-
emy and Copernicus to Einstein and String Theory could not be conceived let alone
formulated without the ideas and systems of mathematics. The underpinning
mathematical theories have often been developed as internally driven exercises in
pure mathematics, with no idea as to possible applications. For example, with the
invention of non-Euclidean geometries the great mathematician Poincare was able
to say that at last a branch of mathematics had been invented that could never be
applied. Ten years later, in 1905, Einstein published his special theory of relativity,
the greatest breakthrough in physics since the time of Newton. Relativity is based
on non-Euclidean geometry, and could not exist without it.
Because of its dual role mathematics has been described as both the queen and
servant of science [1]. The historical development of the mathematical ideas of
space and time suggests that virtually any idea dreamed up by mathematicians can
be adopted by science as an underlying framework for their theories. As I write this,
perhaps some brilliant young and as yet little known physicist is developing a new
cosmological theory of space and time based on set theory, inﬁnite dimensional
geometry, algebraic cohomology or some other abstruse pure mathematical theory.
As queen of the sciences mathematics conjures up pure crystalline realms of
intricately interwoven structures that stretch off to inﬁnity like diamond spangled
spiders’ webs, the Web of Indra.2 As the servant of science mathematics provides
2The Web of Indra is an image from Hindu scripture of a web that stretches to inﬁnity in all
directions. It has no centre and its strands intersect and at each intersection there is a
thousand-facetted jewel that reﬂects the whole web.

the basic toolbox and language from which scientiﬁc theories are built, including
the basic frameworks of space and time.
However, there is a paradox in exploring space-time from the perspective of
mathematics. For although mathematics provides the language in which theories of
space-time are formulated it is itself understood to be outside of space and time.
Geometry is the science of space, and yet is beyond space. In this respect it differs
from science, for scientiﬁc theories are understood to be part of the world that they
describe. Whether located in the minds of scientists, shared culturally in the
community of scientists, present in published texts, or some combinations of these
three, scientiﬁc theories are understood to be part of the physical world. Admittedly,
a few philosophers of science such as Popper [25] disagree with this perspective
and locate scientiﬁc theories in some objective realm beyond space, time and the
physical world. However, this is a minority view. In contrast, within the mathe-
matics community the positing of mathematical objects and theories as existing in
some non-physical world beyond space and time is the standard view. It is termed
Platonism or mathematical realism and refers to existence in an ideal world beyond
our physical world or reality. In this respect it differs from the use of the term
‘realism’ in the physical sciences which concerns the empirical world.
For the scientist the paradox of geometry is not a paradox at all. Geometry and
other mathematical theories are merely tools available to hand for application, and
are in this world just like any other scientiﬁc theories. However, for many
philosophers of mathematics mathematical objects and theories are ideal objects not
of this world, yet they give us knowledge of all the possible forms of space and time
including those used in current cosmological theories. Thus the paradox belongs to
the philosophy of mathematics, not to the philosophy of science. I shall suggest a
solution to this paradox below by adopting a social constructivist philosophy of
mathematics. This undertakes the Promethean task of bringing mathematical objects
and theories back down to earth.
20.2
Mathematics and the Limits of Human
Understanding
Because of our nature, human understanding is ﬁnite and limited. After all we are
higher primates and our brain capacities although large are necessarily ﬁnite and
limited. Consequently, so is our knowledge and understanding. We inhabit the
Earth, which is but a tiny speck in an unbelievably vast universe. Beyond this
vastness, modern science postulates inﬁnitely many parallel universes existing
alongside our own, which remains the only one we can know anything about. That
part of the universe that we can observe is tiny, and the time span we experience is
so very short, even acknowledging that the light that reaches us from distant
galaxies was emitted millions of years ago.
256
P. Ernest

From a theistic position, what we poor ﬁnite creatures can come to know in an
inﬁnite universe created by an inﬁnitely complex god is necessarily miniscule and
subject to all the errors of our limited and fallible being. Even if god has created a
universe of regularities and patterns we can never be sure we have uncovered them
with our bounded, ﬁnite knowing.
From an atheistic perspective, which is my own position, there is no conscious
author of our world. So we have even less reason to believe that our universe rests
on necessary laws and universally invariant and intelligible structures. Whatever
their faith, there is a consensus among scientists and philosophers of science that
our best scientiﬁc theories must always remain conjectures that can never be proved
true. Conﬁrmation of our theories enables us to keep on using them tentatively, and
only falsiﬁcation provides any certainty about our theories. Unfortunately this is the
certainty that our theories are wrong and that we need to look again for new
working theories of the world. As biological creatures produced by evolution and
chance, we have amazing capacities for making meanings and tools.3 But there is
little reason to believe that we can uncover absolute truths about reality. To believe
otherwise is commit the sin of hubris, to gravely overestimate our capacities as
knowers. It would exaggerate our biologically limited powers.
A more humble view of human knowing capacities ﬁnds validation in modern
scientiﬁc theories. Relativity theory tells us that there is no absolute frame of
reference in space, and that space-time-mass work together to shape what currently
appears to be the non-Euclidean space we inhabit. Quantum theory tells us that
there is a built-in uncertainty in measures of distance and momentum, enshrined in
Heisenberg’s uncertainly principle, so that our knowledge of the physical world can
never be exact. Nor can we predict the future as those who subscribed to a
mechanical model of the universe in the past mistakenly believed. Paradoxes
concerning the dual wave-particle nature of matter remain unresolved, and Einstein
worked on these paradoxes without resolution throughout the second half of his life,
so it seems unlikely that they will be resolved in the foreseeable future. Thus our
current theories of the physical world have the limits of our possible knowledge and
knowing built-in. Of course these theories are themselves only well conﬁrmed
conjectures, but so too must their unknown successors be, in the future.
Does mathematics offer a ﬁrm bedrock, an island fortress in this sea of uncer-
tainty? Mathematics is believed by many to offer objective truths that apply uni-
versally, forced by logical necessity on any rational being, no matter how remote
such beings might be from us in space and time. However, there is an outstanding
controversy in mathematics and its philosophy concerning the certainty of mathe-
matical knowledge and what it means. The traditional absolutist view, going back to
Plato, contends that mathematics provides infallible certainty that is both objective
and universal. According to this view, mathematical knowledge is absolutely and
3Of course Darwin’s theory of evolution, based on the idea that we are biological creatures
produced by evolution and chance, may also be jettisoned in favour of a better biological theory
sometime in the future. But this does not weaken my claims about the fallibility of human
knowing.
20

eternally true and infallible, independent of humanity, at all times and places in all
possible universes. So when correctly formulated, mathematical knowledge would
be forever beyond error and correction. Any possible errors in published results
would be due to human error, carelessness, oversight or misformulation. From this
perspective certainty, objectivity and universality are essential deﬁning attributes of
mathematics and mathematical knowledge.
In contrast, there is a more recent and alternative ‘maverick’ tradition in the
philosophy of mathematics according to which mathematical knowledge is
humanly constructed and fallible [17]. This tradition includes the perspectives
known as fallibilism [11, 21] and my own position of social constructivism [6]. As
Lakatos [20, p. 184] puts it: “Why not honestly admit mathematical fallibility, and
try to defend the dignity of fallible knowledge from cynical scepticism, rather than
delude ourselves that we shall be able to mend invisibly the latest tear in the fabric
of our ‘ultimate’ intuitions.”
The maverick tradition in the philosophy of mathematics rejects the claim of the
absolute and universal truth of mathematical knowledge [5, 6, 11, 27]. It argues that
mathematical knowledge does not constitute objective truth that is valid for all
possible knowers and all possible places and times. In this tradition, the certainty of
mathematical knowledge is acknowledged, but the concepts of certainty and
objectivity are circumscribed by the limits of human knowing.
This ambiguity in the term certainty is best understood in terms of the concept of
objectivity. On the one hand, what may be termed absolute objectivity refers to
knowledge that is validated in the physical world as a brute fact veriﬁable by the
senses, or in the domain of non-empirical knowledge by dint of logical necessity.
Furthermore, the logic underlying such necessity is itself guaranteed to be abso-
lutely valid and above and beyond any conceivable doubt throughout all possible
worlds and universes. On the other hand, what may be termed cultural objectivity
refers to knowledge that has a warrant going beyond any individual knower’s
beliefs and is thus objective in the sense opposite to subjective. Laws, money and
language are culturally objective because their existence is independent of any
particular person or small groups, but not of humankind as a whole. These two
meanings are not the same because, for example, mathematical objects and truths
might exist in the social and cultural realm beyond any individual beliefs, thus
being culturally objective, without having independent physical existence or exis-
tence due to logical necessity, that is, being absolutely objective.
In the second, cultural sense, objectivity is redeﬁned as social, as I argue in
Ernest [6]. There I extend the social theory of objectivity proposed by Bloor [2],
Harding [10], Fuller [7], and others.4 This cultural sense of objectivity is how social
constructivism views mathematical objects and truths. This perspective has a strong
bearing on a discussion of the limits of human understanding and knowing because
it posits that mathematics and mathematical knowledge are wholly located in the
4The social theory of objectivity is also paralleled by the theory of social reality put forward by
Searle [26] and his followers in the philosophy of mathematics such as Cole [3].
258
P. Ernest

cultural domain and are, at least in part, contingent on human history and culture.
Social constructivism does not, however, accept that what any group of people
accept as true is necessarily true. Establishing mathematical truths requires proofs
using accepted forms of reasoning. The methods, rules and criteria used in proofs
have been built up over time by a community that is open to criticism and is self
correcting. We can have faith that accepted mathematical results have been
established with certainty, or at least as close to certainty as humans can get. And
where ﬂaws are uncovered, as was done in the great mathematician Hilbert’s
criticisms of Euclid’s geometry, modern mathematicians rectify them, as Hilbert
did.
The controversy between the traditional absolutist philosophies of mathematics
and the maverick philosophies can be largely captured in terms of these two con-
cepts of objectivity. One consequence is that both of these schools can be said to
acknowledge the certainty of mathematical knowledge although the meaning differs
according to the interpretation of ‘objectivity’. Mathematical knowledge consists of
those mathematical propositions that are objectively warranted as true or logically
valid, and hence can be claimed to be known with certainty.
20.3
The Limits of Mathematical Truth
The key issue concerning mathematical knowledge is that of its truth. What is the
truth status of mathematical knowledge including the theorems of mathematics? To
what extent is mathematical knowledge true with certainty? To answer this question
it is necessary to examine the warrants for mathematical knowledge that establish
their truth. The immediate warranting of mathematical truths by intuition will not
do, for two reasons. First, intuition cannot be shared with others as a public warrant
for truth. Second, intuition varies between individuals as well as by time, place,
culture, and soon, so it is not a reliable warrant. So warrants for the truths of
mathematics must be provided via reason or proof. If reason in the form of proof is
used, then to establish the truth of mathematical knowledge with certainty the
following conditions are needed:
1. A set of true axioms or postulates as the foundation for reasoning;
2. A set of rules (and practices) of proof with which to derive truths;
3. A guarantee that the rules of proof are adequate to establish all the truths
(completeness); and
4. A guarantee that the rules of proof are safe in warranting only truths
(consistency).
However, each of these conditions raises problems.
1. It is not possible to warrant a starting set of axioms or postulates as true directly,
as this leads to an inﬁnite regress [20]. Some assumed truths are required as a
starting point in any proof, and intuition is not enough to guarantee their truth; it
20
Paradox? the Mathematics of Space-Time and the Limits …
259

has misled some of the greatest minds in history. So the axioms and postulates
must be assumed, and mathematical proofs take on a hypothetico-deductive
form. That is, theorem T is true provided assumptions A are true: A entails T.
This is acceptable but it means that mathematical truths are not absolute but
relative to the set of assumptions made. By saying that ‘A entails T’ is our truth
rather than ‘T’, we circumvent this, but it means that we have ofﬂoaded the
assumptions on which mathematical truth rests onto the system of proof itself,
the rules and practices of mathematical deduction and proof. These latter, rather
than axioms or postulates, are assumed to be the certain foundations for
mathematical knowledge.
2. Current mathematical practices exhibit a variety of accepted reasoning and proof
styles. Published proofs are accepted as valid by communities of mathemati-
cians, based on professional expertise rather than explicit rules. In addition,
different mathematical specialisms require different proof styles and levels of
rigour [19]. None of the proofs published are fully explicit or fully rigorous,
even with respect to the relevant sub-discipline standards [18]. My further claim
is that they cannot be made so. Published proofs cannot be translated into fully
rigorous formal proofs [6]. Even if they were so translatable, because of their
sheer size rigorous formal proofs could not be checked for correctness with any
guarantee of certainty [23]. Thus the rules of proof provide practical certainty,
relative to the prevailing accepted proof practices, rather than any absolute level
of certainty.
3. It is accepted following Gödel’s [9] ﬁrst incompleteness theorem that in any but
the simplest mathematical theories the rules of proof are inadequate for estab-
lishing all of the relevant mathematical truths, providing they are self-consistent.
Gödel proved this by constructing a true but unprovable sentence, a formal
version of “This sentence cannot be proven”. If it is true is unprovable. If it is
false then it can be proven, leading to a contradiction. Since sentences like this
can be deﬁned in most mathematical theories, provided they are consistent there
are unprovable truths in them. Thus mathematical provability does not capture
mathematical truth and indeed falls some way short of it [24].
4. It is also well known following Gödel’s [9] second incompleteness theorem that
no guarantee can be given that rules and procedures of proof are safe in war-
ranting nothing but truths of mathematics. It is not possible to prove the con-
sistency of any sufﬁciently complex formal theory using only its assumptions
and axioms. Further assumptions are required for such a proof, and these are
assumptions that exceed those of the formal theory to be safeguarded. For
example, Gentzen [8] proved the consistency of Peano arithmetic but he needed
to use transﬁnite (inﬁnite) induction. This might satisfy a working mathemati-
cian, but philosophically it remains problematic. Using ‘intuitively obvious’
non-ﬁnitistic principles in addition to some of the axioms of the system and
logic means that what has to be assumed exceeds that which is safeguarded.
This cannot be described as an absolute guarantee of consistency and hence of
safety.
260
P. Ernest

What this shows is that the truth of mathematical knowledge cannot be shown
with absolute certainty. It cannot be said, free from caveats, that mathematical
knowledge is absolutely true. Proofs in general constitute the strongest evidence for
the certainty of mathematical knowledge, and mathematical proof lies at the heart of
claims of mathematical certainty. It is the strongest weapon in the armoury used to
persuade others of the certainty of mathematical knowledge. But proof cannot
guarantee the absolute truth of mathematical knowledge.5
The conclusion that mathematical knowledge cannot be claimed with absolute
certainty is agreed by many leading mathematicians, logicians and philosophers,
scores of whom are cited in Ernest [5, 6] and Lakatos [22]. Furthermore, in addition
to the Gödel theorems mentioned above, there are a number of other results about
the limits of what can be known within mathematics. For example, Tarski proved
that truth itself is indeﬁnable within any mathematical theory, on pain of contra-
diction. The Lowenheim-Skolem theorem about the uncontrollable size of models
of theories offers the paradoxical result that even the largest uncountably inﬁnite
sets can be fully and consistently interpreted within countable sets.6 Church’s
theorem reveals that there is no decision procedure to determine whether an arbi-
trary proposition in arithmetic is true or false. Some attempts to so determine the
truth of a claim may continue endlessly without ever reaching a result either way.
Craig’s Interpolation Theorem shows the impossibility of expressing proofs in any
ultimate, ﬁnal canonical form, because a further relevant step can always be inserted
between any two steps in a proof.
Rather than signs of weakness these results should be celebrated as advances in
knowledge that come from an understanding of the limitations of human knowing.
Modern physics has well known analogues including general relativity and quan-
tum theory mentioned above, showing the relative and uncertain nature of our
knowledge. By showing the limits of our knowing such results and theories rep-
resent advances in our knowledge.
In mathematics, as our knowledge has become better founded and we learn more
about its basis, we come to realize that the absolutist view of perfect knowledge is
an idealization, a myth. This new understanding represents an advance in knowl-
edge, not a retreat from what was viewed in the past as a stronger position of
absolute certainty.
5It might be argued that I am assuming the truth of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems to argue for
the fallibility of mathematical knowledge and truth. But virtually all mathematicians of all
philosophical camps accept these results as certain, in the cultural sense. If the objective certainty
of mathematical results like Gödel’s theorem are challenged on general grounds, rather than
because an error is discovered in the proof, then my case is made for me.
6Uncountable sets have more elements in them than can be counted using the usual counting
numbers, whatever order we try to count them. For example, the real numbers (representable as
inﬁnitely extended endless decimals) are uncountable. Cantor’s diagonal theorem shows that any
attempt to enumerate an uncountably inﬁnite set demonstrably leaves out many elements. So the
Lowenheim-Skolem theorem results in the paradox that uncountably inﬁnite sets, no matter how
large, can be fully represented and accommodated in a countably ﬁnite model.
20

The fact that mathematical certainty and objectivity are socially and culturally
deﬁned, does not mean that the fact ‘1 + 1 = 2’ has the same status and objectivity
as ‘Desdemona is the wife of Othello’ or that ‘Paris is the capital of France’. The
fact that 2 denotes two has the same status as these two contingent truths, because
names are arbitrary. But the fact ‘1 + 1 = 2’ is not arbitrary, because in arithmetic 2
is deﬁned as the successor (1’) of 1, and 1 + 1 = 1’ by deﬁnition of ‘+’. In other
words, it follows by logic. Similar but more extended arguments can be used for
‘5 + 7 = 12’, Pythagoras’ Theorem, or Gödel’s ﬁrst incompleteness theorem.
Namely, that there is a logically deductive chain that proves the statement. Such
mathematical truths can be known with certainty, cultural certainty that is, unlike
above the contingent facts from Shakespeare and geography.
Relinquishing the hope of absolute certainties in mathematics does not represent
a loss of knowledge [18]. It was Vico’s (1710) great insight that we only know with
certainty that which we have made. Mathematics is one of the greatest of human
inventions, constructed and reconstructed over millennia. Our certainty in mathe-
matics resides in knowing what we have constructed. Overall, what this means is
that we have to be circumspect in what we claim in terms of mathematical certainty
and objectivity. Mathematical knowledge is known with certainty within the
bounds of what can be humanly known. Mathematical knowledge and mathemat-
ical objects are objective, but in the circumscribed sense of cultural objectivity. We
do not have to relinquish the certainty and objectivity of mathematics. We merely
have to be more circumspect in what we claim by ascribing certainty and objectivity
to mathematics. Thus mathematics is a central case in establishing the limits of
human knowing.
20.4
Knowledge Versus Understanding
In discussing the limits of human understanding I have focussed on knowledge,
both scientiﬁc knowledge made up of theories and observational facts, and more
centrally, mathematical knowledge, which is made up of theorems and theories.7
Although there is an overlap of meaning between knowledge and understanding,
there are also differences. The emphasis with knowledge is epistemological, con-
cerning not only the knowledge claim itself but also the warrant for the claim.
Knowledge is justiﬁed true belief. Understanding, however, concerns meaning,
sense making and explanation. Thus as well as epistemology it concerns rhetoric,
how explanations are formulated, as well as communication and psychology, what
sense is made of propositions and theories and how well they relate to or explain
other phenomena. Thus one might say that human understanding encompasses
more
than
knowledge,

knowledge-related representations we can distinguish between information, belief
and knowledge itself. Information is made up of representations, with signs des-
ignating state of affairs. The designations may be the outcomes of individual or
group intentions, and information per se has no epistemological status beyond being
a representation. Beyond this, beliefs not only designate some state of affairs but
also imply a commitment to their validity by their holders or proponents. Lastly,
knowledge representations are beliefs that are warranted as true. Thus there is an
increasing epistemological strength gradient from information through belief and
then on to knowledge. Likewise, the pool of representations diminishes as we pass
from information through beliefs to knowledge, because all beliefs might be said to
be information representations plus commitment, and all knowledge representations
are beliefs plus warrants and truth status.
Understanding encompasses all of these types, including information, belief and
knowledge. What we are acquainted with, believe or know comprises a wide variety
of suspicions, guesses, rumours, conjectures, desired and inferred connections, as
well as more robust facts, generalizations and theories. Understanding represents
connected and better or worse buttressed claims, ideas, concepts and knowledge.
Thus human understanding is limited in at least two ways. First, there is the
epistemological warrant for what we believe or claim we understand. Even the best
warranted human knowledge has a certainty that is circumscribed by the limits of
our knowledge. Beliefs are weaker in only being guaranteed the commitment of
individuals or groups, and information has no guaranteed warrant at all.
Second, there is the breadth of representational types we weave together in our
understandings of anything and everything. Although information and beliefs add
to our repertoire of representations, there is no reason to believe that we have access
to all possible representations of what can or might be understood. We are ﬁnite and
limited in our understanding. We can never know whether all that makes up reality,
whatever that might be, is susceptible to representation, making it accessible to
human understanding. There is no reason to think that the universe, all that exists, is
neatly bundled and labelled so that it is susceptible to human representation and
understanding. Indeed, given the limitations of our scientiﬁc and mathematical
knowledge acknowledged above, there is every reason to believe that like knowl-
edge, human understanding is limited and fallible. Why should all that exists,
including all the patterns and connections that might possibly be conjectured but
have not been formulated or posited be discernable and comprehensible to human
understanding? Although we can distinguish knowledge and understanding, they
share similar limitations, they are both bounded. Even our best knowledge and
understandings are limited, constrained within the boundaries of what is humanly
representable, understandable and knowable.

Paradox? the Mathematics of Space-Time and the Limits …
263

20.5
Where Is Mathematics? When?
There is an irony in considering mathematics in the context of space-time and the
limits of human understanding. For although mathematics provides the language in
which theories of space-time are formulated it is widely regarded itself to be outside
of space and time. From the time of Plato mathematical concepts, objects and
knowledge have been regarded as existing in a timeless world of their own, quite
distinct from the material world we live in. The argument is that a mathematical
circle is an ideal object and that no circle we draw on earth can be such a perfect
and ideal object. Thus mathematical objects are not to be found in everyday or
scientiﬁc space, but somewhere else. Likewise, mathematical objects are perfect
and beyond the ravages and decay that time brings. So where is mathematics to be
found? Which space, albeit metaphorical, do the problems, truths, theories and the
objects of mathematics inhabit? If they exist in an ideal other space disconnected
from us, how can we know them and how can they inﬂuence our world? But if
somehow they exist in the material human world how can they be ideal and perfect?
This is the paradox of mathematical existence.
My solution to this paradox is to say that the objects and truths of mathematics
exist in cultural space, they are part of social reality. We meet and come to
understand and believe in social reality through our interactions with other people
and with institutions. Language and other signs are used to point to and describe the
elements of social reality, but beyond this, they create social reality [26]. Through
conversational exchanges with other people we learn about the unvarying properties
of the objects that exist in social reality. This covers laws, customs, property,
money and countless other things. But my concern here is with mathematics. We
learn, for example, that a quadrilateral is a plane ﬁgure with four straight line sides.
We have objects in the environment around us pointed out as approximately
quadrilateral in shape, including squares, rectangles, parallelograms, trapeziums,
etc. We learn that most things with quadrilateral shapes maintain such shapes, and
that there is general agreement in the identiﬁcation of shapes as quadrilaterals. If we
misuse such terms, such as claiming that oblongs have rounded corners, we are
soon corrected by those more expert than ourselves. The rough edges of our con-
cepts and their deﬁnitions are rounded off, through conversation. We learn about
elements of social reality such as these, and all the many others, through conver-
sation, even acknowledging that in formal studies these are largely one-sided
conversations. But all formal studies include learner responses via the media of
written work submitted and answers produced in testing. In such assessments we
show what we know, and where we misunderstand properties of the mathematical
objects found in social reality, we are corrected. If we do not take these corrections
on board we fail to progress to the next level of study. Thus there are safeguards in
the form of social institutions that ensure that we learn the same standardized
meanings and properties, in short, the same mathematical objects. Even when we
have idiosyncratic personal associations in our understandings, social mechanisms
ensure we use the terms describing mathematical objects in the same way. This is a
264
P. Ernest

very simpliﬁed account of the mechanisms that ensure that the objects of social
reality are the same for all of us, and these include the objects of mathematics.
Although mathematical objects appear to be universal and timeless, existing
beyond the material human world, this is an illusion. Mathematical objects are
social or cultural objects that have to created anew in the mind of any learner.
Irrespective of whether or not mathematics acquisition is hard-wired into our brains,
it takes an extended exposure to mathematical representations, tasks and conver-
sations for mathematical objects to populate our imaginations. Repeatedly
approaching and using representations of mathematical facts, concepts and rules in
different ways but with an underlying standardization and constancy convinces us
of the invariance and objectivity of mathematical objects. Cognitive psychologist
have documented the human capacity for mentally reifying mathematical processes
into more abstract mathematical objects, and we observe this across the years of
learning. So the gradually increasing abstraction of the mathematical concepts we
encounter across the years of statutory schooling results in personal universes
populated with abstract processes and entities, and these are of course the mathe-
matical objects under discussion.
Thus the paradox of the position of mathematics in space and time is at least
partially resolved. Mathematics is a set of representations and practices embedded
in human culture, in social reality. Although mathematical knowledge and objects
appear to exist beyond time and space this is an illusion. It takes time for the
knowledge and objects of mathematics to develop. We all acknowledge the
extensive period of time it took for mathematics to develop historically. The
invention and discovery of all of the concepts, problems, results and symbolism of
mathematics can be located in speciﬁc historical episodes. Sometimes within an
already elaborate discipline of mathematics the problems and methods of mathe-
matics have cried out for certain solutions, connections and new abstractions,
leading to simultaneous discovery of new ideas and methods, such as the concept of
zero, or the calculus [29]. Paralleling but not recapitulating the disciplinary
development is the growth of mathematical knowledge in the learner. This takes
over a decade of immersion in mathematical activities totalling thousands of hours
and thousand of tasks. Once the objects of mathematics have become real for us we
forget the long processes, both historical and personal, that were necessary for us to
build our understandings. It is illusory for us to ask where mathematics in the
geographical sense. Looking for mathematics in some other world is also illusory
unless we understand this other world as social reality. Of course the Platonist view
that there is an ontologically separate and independent ideal world populated by
mathematical objects is irrefutable, just as is an imagined heaven populated by
millions of angels. Such answers posit imaginary places where mathematics (and
angels) are found. But they leave unanswered the question of how we access them,
how they become real to us, at least in this mortal life.

20.6
Personal Time and Space
All sentient beings including humans live in the moment, in the here and now. This
is the bedrock, the fulcrum, the pivot point of our lived experience. All else is
unreal and secondary, either summoned from memory or imagined for the as yet
unreal future. Living in the here and now is the clarion call of some forms of the
spiritual life, such as Buddhism. This is illustrated in Aldous Huxley’s [13] book
Island, a story of about awakening consciousness in which a Minah bird ﬂutters
from tree to tree calling “here and now”, “here and now” to remind the characters to
be fully awake in their daily lives. But here and now really is the originary point of
all thought, all consciousness and all action. Like the origin point in the Cartesian
plane, (0, 0), or even in the Einsteinian four dimensional space-time, (0, 0, 0, t), this
is the reference point from which all ﬂows or with respect to which all is measured.
Weyl and Rotman liken the Cartesian origin point to the vestigial sign of the self or
ego in mathematical space. But what is the actual link between this moment, the
here and now, and the worlds of mathematics, of science and indeed of all human
knowledge and understanding? The link is the human imagination. Consciousness
allows us in the here and now to weave rich and ornate tapestries of the imagi-
nation. Through weaving the here and now back and forth as a single strand through
such a rich many layered cloth we weave vast empires of the imagination. These
may be intricate castles ﬂoating in the air, but they are shared castles in the air, for
we join with others, through conversation, to weave our individual strands, the
passage of our private present moments, our ‘here and now’s into the great shared
tapestry of human knowledge. These make up the ‘great conversation’ of human
culture and ideas [12]. Our imaginations spin our webs of thought moment by
moment into the rich interlocking web of ideas, more complex than any spider’s
web, and this makes up our shared knowledge and understanding.
Here we have another paradox. Through the tiny atom of experience, the
moment of consciousness, emerges the vastness of all human understanding and
constructed artefacts. Like the tip of a needle, coursing inch-by-inch, up and down,
in and out, within the tiniest of times and spaces, moment by moment, emerges the
vast tapestry of human knowledge and all the material constructions that surround,
shape and enable us to live, eat, travel and work in comfort. Imagination and
planning string these moments of endeavour together, like beads on a never ending
necklace, making the vast intricate cathedrals of human achievement. Many thin-
kers have used the experience of spatial constraint, with almost unlimited time, to
create some of the great cultural artefacts. Cervantes wrote Don Quixote while
imprisoned, as did Dostoevsky with some of his greatest novels. Descartes claims to
have thought best within the conﬁnes of a heated oven, and Gramsci developed his
deep political philosophy in his Prison Notebooks, before his execution. Russell
wrote An introduction to mathematical philosophy in prison. Some great thinkers
lost their visual perception of space, going blind, but went on to create great works,
like Milton’s Paradise Lost and Beethoven’s late symphonies and string quartets,
although conﬁned by the denial of visually perceived space.
266

Here the analogy between space and time breaks down. Although mystics have
written of a moment of enlightenment, in which all things are seen as joined
together as in Indra’s net, and a golden glow of love suffuses the entire universe,
such an experience is not something that can be shared. The intensity felt in the
moment can inspire subsequent life choices and indeed eloquent communications.
But it can only be sketched dimly through analogy, metaphor, parable, pictures, and
so on, that can at best depict some adjunct features of the experience. They can
never capture its transcendent core, the feeling as the spiritual self overﬂows the
bounds of the ego. The Aha! moment, Satori, Nirvana or whatever else the instant
of enlightenment is called, takes place in time, but is beyond time; it takes place in
space, but is beyond space. You do not have to believe in god to accept that such
experiences real events in human consciousness, and that the material basis of mind
does not preclude human spiritual experience.
Among our shared understanding, underpinning its elaborate tapestry of woven
ideas and knowledge, even framing its possibilities, according to Kant [16], are our
ideas of space and time. Our consciousness of the here and now contains within it
the fundamental categories of space and time, we could not experience or perceive
anything unless it was framed by and presented through the categories of space and
time. In addition, our consciousness and experience also contains within it dis-
tinction between space and time. Consider, the bedrock of our experience: it is in
and of the moment. But the moment that we experience is not an instant, it is not the
imaginary zero magnitude point, so useful a ﬁction in mathematics and science.
This moment has a deﬁnite duration of a few seconds, and in our consciousness of
that moment we experience both succession and multiplicity. Succession, as I
discuss above, gives us the awareness of time and number. It is progression across
time. Simultaneity, as in our experience of multiple objects in the realm of our
senses, gives us the awareness of space. For a multiplicity that is simultaneously
present must not only be an array of distinct objects, but logically these must also be
spread out in one or more dimensions of space in order for us to perceive them
simultaneously. Thus a fundamental distinction emerges from our awareness of the
moment, a dichotomy between our awareness of succession and of simultaneity.
These concern the serial relationships of succession (one after the other) versus the
parallel functioning of simultaneity (the coexistence of different parts or processes).
These give rise, in their basic forms, to the distinction between geometry and
arithmetic. This is a deep distinction, resting, as it does on our different and distinct
experience of space and time.
Analogous distinctions are in use in many areas of knowledge, such as lin-
guistics. There is diachrony (historical disposition, with events spread in succession
over time) versus synchrony (simultaneous events). There is the syntagmatic, the
relationship between them in successive sequence of signs, versus paradigmatic, in
which signs are contrasted with other substitutable signs [4]. As literary tropes there
is also metonymy, which works by the contiguity between two terms or concepts,
including taking an attribute to stand for the whole, versus metaphor, which is
based upon the analogous similarity of two concepts. It has been argued that
20
Paradox? the Mathematics of Space-Time and the Limits …
267

different portions of the human brain are devoted to metonymy and metaphor [14].8
So the difference between space and time, if it is not too much of a stretch to point
to these parallel dichotomies as evidence, is a fundamental and deep-seated duality
that runs through almost the whole of human ideas, including mathematics.
Kant’s great insight about consciousness and indeed all knowing and knowl-
edge, is that it is conditioned and constrained by inbuilt cognitive and epistemo-
logical limits. He argued that the categories of time and space are part of the
conditions of cognition, and are not something that we experience.
Space is not something objective and real, nor a substance, nor an accident, nor a relation;
instead, it is subjective and ideal, and originates from the mind’s nature in accord with a
stable law as a scheme, as it were, for coordinating everything sensed externally. [15,
p. 403]
Every experience takes place within space and time, but is not of space and time.
We are unaware of the airy space that surrounds us just as ﬁsh are unaware of the
sea. Only when a change of pressure occurs, when a current within the medium
brushes against us, stimulating our sense of touch, do we become aware of the
‘airiness’ (or ‘wateriness’) of our medium. Space is the invisible medium
throughout which tangible objects are present and arrayed.
20.7
Conclusion: The Limits of Human Understanding
and Knowledge
In this chapter I explore the paradoxes that emerge from the mathematics of space
and time with a focus on the limits of human understanding. For example, I con-
sider how mathematics provides the language of theories of space-time, and yet is
itself understood to be outside space and time. Geometry is the science of space,
and yet is itself beyond space. Mathematics is believed by many to transcend the
limits of human understanding by expressing truths that apply beyond and across all
space and time. Mathematical knowledge is understood to be forced by logical
necessity on all conscious beings. But mathematics is itself human knowledge, and
the history of its creation is there for all to see. So how can it exceed the knowledge
capacities of its authors?
I suggest a resolution to this and the other paradoxes. But this solution depends
on the Promethean task of bringing mathematics from its remote Platonic heaven
back down to earth. My proposed solution is a social constructivist one. Namely,
that mathematics is humanly created, and it rests on a social reality. Thus mathe-
matics is not otherworldly but is embodied in the personal knowledge of persons, in
cultural practices and in texts containing symbols. These are part of what help
8The eminent French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan also argues that the unconscious mind has the
same structure as language, and that Freud’s mechanisms of condensation and displacement in the
unconscious are equivalent to the poetic functions of metaphor and metonymy, respectively.

support and create its social reality, although mathematics is not reducible to any
combination of these. Social reality is real and it supports and constrains our
understandings and actions. But it does not exist apart, beyond space and time.
There is another paradox in considering mathematics in the context of
space-time and the limits of human understanding. Drawing on a social construc-
tivist perspective I argue that mathematical knowledge cannot exceed the knowl-
edge capacities of its authors. The certainty and objectivity of mathematical
knowledge is bounded by the limits of human knowledge and understanding. The
solidity of the objects of mathematics is a social reality which is made real by their
constant properties which are consistent throughout the multiple human presenta-
tions and representations of them. This offers one solution to the mystery of how
mathematical knowledge can be pure and exist in a superhuman domain, yet be so
‘unreasonably effective’ in its worldly applications [28]. For mathematical concepts
and knowledge originate in our attempts to understand the world, and our attempts
to weave patterns to describe our experiences. We abstract and generalize the
concepts, symbolic processes and patterns that we so derive, and should not be
amazed that they ﬁt our human experiences when we reapply them to nature.
Reﬂections on the mathematics of space-time reveals the great breadth of our
knowledge, but examined closely also bring to light a number of paradoxes. A ﬁnal
irony is that mathematics, the most certain and infallible of all of the disciplines of
knowledge, is, its certainty notwithstanding, beset with paradoxes and uncertainties
that very well show up very strikingly the limits of human understanding.

Chapter 21
“Now” Has an Inﬁnitesimal Positive
Duration
Reuben Hersh
Abstract This article offers the nonstandard or “hyperreal” line as a model for
Time, thereby to resolve a persistent controversy of the meaning of “Now.” As a
“monad” in the Leibnitzian time axis, “Now” is a time interval shorter than any
standard positive interval, yet longer than any inﬁnitesimal.
I start out with Aristotle’s Physics.1 In order to separate the past and the future, a
single
point
“now”
sufﬁces.
(This
automatically
invokes
an
image,
the
“straight line”, and brings in the mathematics of Euclid, as modernized of course.)
On the other hand, in order to be faithful to the unbroken connectedness of
experience, we require a “now” that overlaps the past and future, a positive duration
for what is happening “right now.”
Automatically and uncritically we think of time as a straight line, with a positive
direction, inﬁnitely long in both directions. It’s split between the future, a ray
stretching to the right, and the past, a ray stretching to the left. This pair of disjoint
half-lines is separated or joined by a single point, “the present”, “the Now.”
This image, this time line, is not Time. Time itself is not a line, it is the general
phenomenon of change. The time line is just a model of Time, a mathematical
model. It helps us to conceptualize or visualize experience. Like any model, it is not
identical to the object being modeled, which is the Time we live through, either in
ordinary life or in experimental science.
“Now” is a primitive of human language, as when I yell at you, “Do it now!” It is
not a problem in common conversation.
But when Logic sticks in its head, a problem does arise. The book edited by
Durie [5] presents arguments about the Now by distinguished authors, including

Henri Bergson [2] and Gaston Bachelard [1]. Bergson tells us the Present must have
a duration. For anything at all to happen, it takes at least a little bit of time. In zero
time (without duration) we’d be with Zeno [6], stuck in a “place,” unable to move.
But things are happening, we are living and breathing, now! For Bergson, “now”
holds together the past and the future, a duration where the future becomes the past.
To Bachelard, “Now” is merely a point separating the past and the future.
Bachelard claims to settle the argument by pointing to Albert Einstein. The
“event” in Relativity Theory has a time coordinate, a number. End of argument.
And in this regard, not just Einstein, but all of experimental science can be cited.
Isaac Newton wrote that he was calculating velocity at the very instant when the
falling stone hits the ground. Since the work of Newton, observable, measurable
motions have been modeled as “functions” of time. We record observations using
two lines. One is a time axis. The other is an axis of distance, temperature, pressure,
or some other “state variable”. The state variable is called a function of time, which
means merely that a point on the state variable axis corresponds to some point on
the time axis. The use of points or “instants” is taken for granted.
This methodology is so universal, so well established for centuries, that it is
taken as an objective reality, as a real truth, not just a successful model. But it
doesn’t ﬁt well with our subjective time sense, like how long we’ve been waiting in
the doctor’s ofﬁce. Without bringing in any mathematics, we know which things
have already happened (“are in the past”), which ones are going on now (“in the
present”), and which ones haven’t happened yet (they’re “in the future”). That kind
of “experiential time” is not quite the same as Newton’s “everywhere always
equable ﬂow”. Yet they are not unrelated. They have to be compatible in practice.
We manage to shift back and forth between the “independent variable” of physics
and the past, present and future of daily life.
There is the objective, scientiﬁc duration or time, the independent coordinate of
mechanics. And over against it to be reconciled with it, is an internal, subjective
sense of time, a consciousness of time passing either slowly or quickly, the ﬂow of
time that we feel even with our eyes closed in a silent room, that seems entirely
different from the time by which we describe the rising and setting of the sun and
the moon.
We seem to be facing a conﬂict between our lived Now, a brief duration where
Past and Future seamlessly merge, and our scientiﬁc practice, which evaluates an
observable at any given instant [3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 14].
But this opposition is delusional. It is based on the delusion of immaterial
consciousness. Our minds are embedded in our bodies, they are activities or
functions of brains and nervous systems which are not free ﬂoating, they are in our
ﬂesh, our muscles and guts. My heart is beating. My breath goes in and out. My
stomach empties and needs to be reﬁlled. My buttocks weary from long sitting. All
this information available to my brain is somehow combined or condensed into a
sense of time passing. It is time to get up, or to lie down, or to ﬁnd a snack.
The coming and going of daylight, the coming and going of the seasons of the
year, the aging of ourselves and others, impose their own measure of lived
experience, before or without any intervention of clocks. Muscle fatigue, hunger,
272
R. Hersh

heartbeats and breaths in and out, all are different clocks sending signals to our
brain where they are compared, coordinated, and synthesized to give us a subjective
sense of time passing. How long have I been sitting here waiting? How long has it
been since I have heard from so and so? As I stand I feel the passage of time in my
muscle fatigue. Or as I sit, I feel the passage of time in my buttocks and back.
Maybe I even get a backache. All the while of course my breath is entering and
leaving my lungs and my heartbeat is continuing, perhaps at a steady pace, perhaps
with speedups and slowdowns. Fatigue not only of the muscles but of the nervous
system. The detached observer is a myth. We ourselves, as real observers, are
embodied, with stomachs and brains.
There is keeping time, marking time, making time, losing time, but that doesn’t
mean that there is an actual thing that you are marking, or keeping, or losing, or
making, as the case may be.
The “Now” is an old problem in experimental psychology. How long must a
sound or a ﬂash of light persist, in order to be perceived? William James [7] called it
“the specious present” and reported experiments in Germany. The empirical reality
of the “specious present” is the number of milliseconds that a sight or a sound must
endure in order to be perceived.
The empirical Now shrinks as we invent more powerful observing instruments.
On my desk is a calendar with illustrations from high-speed photography.
A bullet is shown in mid-air, just as it has passed through an apple. It was in that
position for “an instant.” But the camera shutter had to stay open long enough for
the photographic chemical process to take place. No photography can be instan-
taneous. If Now takes some time, then how much? Milliseconds? Nanoseconds?
Microseconds?
This empirical and experiential fact seems to ignore a certain logic of past and
future. That little interval on the line, the Durational Now, will have boundary
points where it meets the Future and where it meets the Past. The perceptive time
interval must extend between two instants, a beginning and an end, and we are still
left with the question, what we should mean by “now”. When does the Now begin?
How long does it last? When does it end? In trying to answer these questions, we
seem forced to narrrow the Now back down to a mere point.
To someone not indoctrinated in modern mathematics, not ashamed to use the
word “inﬁnitesimal”, it would be tempting to propose a duration of “Now” that is
neither zero nor positive. Something in between. “Inﬁnitesimal.”
The standard “real line” taught in school is subject to the Axiom of Archimedes:
Any interval, no matter how short, will become longer than any other interval, no matter
how long, if added to itself sufﬁciently many times
This axiom amounts to saying, “There is no inﬁnitesimal,” if by “inﬁnitesimal”
we mean something so short that no matter how many times we add it to itself, the
result will always be less than one unit (inch, mile, whatever you want to choose as
your unit.)
Is this Axiom true? It is true of the standard real line, because it is part of the
deﬁnition of the standard real line. Circular reasoning, irrefutable. Is there any other
21

real line that is not the standard one? Yes! It is called the Nonstandard line! (Also
called the “hyperreal” line.) It has been recognized and accepted into established
mathematics since 1966, when the logician Abraham Robinson published his
famous book Nonstandard Analysis [11].
Already at the foundation of the calculus, in the 17th century, Leibnitz and his
predecessors Cavalieri and others used inﬁnitesimals to calculate areas and vol-
umes. To do so required a certain ﬁnesse, because they were unable to explain
exactly the meaning of the word “inﬁnitesimal”. Roughly speaking, “An
inﬁnitesimal is greater than zero, but smaller than every positive number.” This
deﬁnition
tells
us
that
an
inﬁnitesimal
is
smaller
than
itself!
Blatantly
self-contradictory. Leibnitz explained that although inﬁnitesimals do not actually
exist, still we can think about them as if they did exist. In the 19th century, Cauchy,
Dedekind and Weierstrass showed how to do calculus without saying “inﬁnitesi-
mal.” We use a couple of little extra variables, usually called epsilon and delta.
Against the rules of mathematics, geometers, physicists and engineers continue to
think and talk with inﬁnitesimals.
Robinson the logician was experienced in applied mathematics. He used logic to
construct a continuum, a “line,” where every standard number is surrounded by a
little cloud of inﬁnitely close nonstandard numbers. How did he get away with it?
He had a new tool—modern formal logic, thanks to Frege, Whitehead and Russell.
Mathematical logic describes mathematics formally with precisely stated symbols,
grammar, and deductions. The “standard real line”, that is, the set of standard
numbers, subject to the Axiom of Archimedes, becomes expressed in a deﬁnite
formula. Then it makes sense to talk about nonstandard numbers. An inﬁnitesimal is
a number greater than zero but smaller than every standard positive number. No
more self-contradiction!
I propose the hyperreal or Leibnitzian line as a suitable mathematical model of
time.
Nonstandard analysis is no longer a startling novelty. Half a century has passed.
Nonstandard analysis is in elementary calculus books by Howard Jerome Keisler
and others, that have been used successfully in courses at several universities. It is a
powerful research tool. Although most people go through grad school without
meeting it, it isn’t controversial any more. It is a well established part of mathe-
matics, and a respected research methodology.
In Leibniz’s calculus, velocity was a ratio, an inﬁnitesimal distance divided by
an inﬁnitesimal time interval. Robinson uses this nonstandard ratio, and obtains as a
standard velocity the unique standard number inﬁnitely close to this nonstandard
ratio. In this calculation, time is being modeled by a nonstandard real line. In the
present paper, I point out that this model of time is useful, not only for calculating
velocity, but also for endowing the Present, the Now, with a positive duration,
thereby relieving the tension between the experiential now, which has duration, and
the scientiﬁc now, which must have a deﬁnite location.
The nonstandard real line has a zero, which is a standard real number, and
around it a set of inﬁnitesimals, both positive and negative. Robinson took a word
274
R. Hersh

from Leibnitz and named the cloud of nonstandard numbers inﬁnitely close to any
standard real number a “monad.”
In a hyperreal model of time, we could choose to say, without contradiction, that
past and future overlap or intersect in the present. The present would be a monad, it
would be all the nonstandard points inﬁnitely close to some standard point. “Now”
would be deﬁned as the intersection of past and future. It would have a ﬁnite
positive duration. That duration would not equal any number, either standard or
nonstandard, for it would be smaller than any standard number, yet greater than any
inﬁnitesimal.
The subjective “present” does not have any deﬁnite beginning or end. This
feature is shared by the nonstandard monad, which does not have a ﬁrst or last
element.
One of the difﬁculties of describing time phenomenologically is the impossibility
of assigning any number to the duration of the instant. The monad does not possess
a numerical magnitude. As a model of any instant, including the present instant, it
has positive duration, greater than any inﬁnitesimal, yet still less than any standard.
This paradoxical feature of the hyperreal model ﬁts nicely with phenomenological
introspection.
Intuitively, it makes more sense to think of past and future overlapping than to
think of them as disjoint, separated by an instant (the present) through which they
can never touch each other. How can the future ﬂow into the past, as tomorrow
turns into yesterday, without tomorrow ever being allowed to touch yesterday? The
mystery about the future ﬂowing into the past is an artifact of the standard math-
ematical model. It falls away in the hyperreal model. The future and the past
overlap inﬁnitesimally. The inﬁnitesimal overlap of future and past is the region of
actuality, of things happening and changing.
Of the three pieces of time—past, present, and future—it is the now that is really
real. “Be here now!” That reality requires duration.
Miller [8] presented an exposition of the phenomenological now, according to
Edmund Husserl. Consider how we hear a melody. The melody is a sequence of
tones. We hear one tone at a time, yet we listen to the melody as a whole, not as a
succession of unrelated tones. We remember the tones we have just heard, and we
anticipate the next tone which we expect to come soon. Before the “primal
impression”, then, we have a “protention”, and in passing it leaves behind a “re-
tention”. The connections between these experiential aspects of time permit us to
have a connected experience of the whole melody. In fact, the same analysis applies
even to our experience of each separate tone of the melody, for even a single tone
has a duration, and a “primal experience”, a “protention” and a “retention”.
This analysis of our experience depends on our already accepting the objective
fact–that one tone does really precede or follow another. This amounts to accepting
the objective reality of Time, accepting that things do happen out in the World, that
one happening does precede or follow another.
The difﬁculty is with our picture of time as a Euclidean or Newtonian line. These
lines carry along with them the Archimedean axiom. “Any interval, no matter how
short, can serve to count any epoch of time, no matter how long.” There is another
21
“Now” Has an Inﬁnitesimal Positive Duration
275

kind of line that people have thought with, where inﬁnitesimal intervals are
allowed–“inﬁnitely short,” so to speak. They were part of calculus when calculus
was ﬁrst invented. Velocity at an instant was just the ratio of the inﬁnitesimal
distance traveled to the time elapsed in an inﬁnitesimal time interval.
This made sense, it worked, it was understood, but it was not Aristotelian. It did
not ﬁt into the “yes or no” framework of Logic. With effort, it was abandoned for an
Archimedean framework, that relied on inequalities of two small variables called
epsilon and delta. In modern times, a way has been found to marry the Inﬁnitesimal
to Aristotle. The key was mathematical logic. Once logic became precise and
powerful enough to have its own theorems, one could talk about language and logic
themselves as part of mathematics. Then we could refer to the Archimedean number
system of Euclid and Newton, and call it Standard. We can talk about another kind
of number, a nonstandard one, that is smaller than every standard one, and still
positive. An inﬁnitesimal. That is Robinson’s nonstandard analysis, which is now
established as part of pure mathematics, and tool of applied math. In contrast to the
standard Archimedean or Newtonian line, we call it Leibnitzian, because non-
standard analysis is a rigorous re-establishment of Leibnitz’s inﬁnitesimal calculus.
The nonstandard real line is a better model for Time than the standard one. We
can still think of the present instant as the zero on our time axis. We can associate to
it a duration which is less than any standard positive number no matter how small,
yet still greater than any inﬁnitesimal. This would be what Robinson called the
monad of zero, the set of positive and negative inﬁnitesimals.
It satisﬁes the phenomenological requirement for a Now that is associated with
an instant in time yet has a duration greater than zero. The seeming contradiction is
not in the experience of Time, it is only in the attempt to model time by the standard
line of Euclid and Newton. Robinson’s hyperreal or nonstandard line is a better
model, a better ﬁt or description of time as experienced.
For the purpose of representing physical processes, we can choose either version
of the line. The inﬁnitesimal is closer to naive intuition, and was never really
expelled from applied mathematics.
Aristotle on Now is descriptive, and presents two different understandings of the
word Now. Taking the notions of past and future as basic or elementary, the Now is
constructed in two different ways. It is the instant that SEPARATES the past from
the future. But also, it is the instant that CONNECTS the past to the future.
The ﬁrst meaning we could call the Newtonian Now. In Newton’s mechanics, it
is the initial or ﬁnal time of a process, say when a stone is released to fall or when it
hits the ground. The customary scientiﬁc Now.
We could call the second Now the Bergsonian or Leibnizian Now. It is the
experiential Now, the Now that sees time as a continuous ﬂow, where the future is
connected seamlessly to the past, and is constantly being transformed into the past.
To clarify the second Now, where the future is turning into the past, we could
say it sticks INTO the future and sticks ONTO the past. It comprises not just a
single moment, of duration zero, but also the moments immediately before and after
it, the preceding and succeeding moments. To make this mathematical, we could
say “those moments inﬁnitely close to it, both before and after”.
276
R. Hersh

This is an experiential Now with positive duration. Abraham Robinson dubbed it
the “monad”. It has duration greater than any inﬁnitesimal but smaller than any
standard positive number. It has no deﬁnite beginning or ending, no ﬁrst or last.
This is what we intuitively feel, that the experiential Now should be: open without
boundary.
Thus the hyperreals or nonstandard reals of Abraham Robinson provide a
mathematical model to accommodate the experiential Now.

What’s Wrong with the Platonic Ideal
of Space and Time?
Lorenzo Sadun
To our senses, space is smooth, 3-dimensional, and ﬂat. We move in a continuum
where all points are equal (space is “homogeneous”) and all directions are equal
(“isotropic”, or “round”). If we head oﬀin any direction, we keep on going, with no
curving back on ourselves (“ﬂat”). In short, we seem to live in a universe governed
by Euclidean geometry.
Actually, almost everything I wrote in the previous paragraph was a lie. Our senses
continually detect the diﬀerence between diﬀerent directions. Things fall down, not
up. The sun rises in the East, not in the West. We know that not all points are equal,
and that Hawaii is a lot more pleasant than Antarctica. Curvature is all around us,
from the hill my house sits on to the fact that we can ﬂy around the world.
All the same, most of us still believe in 3-dimensional space, plus an added dimen-
sion (time) that describes how things change. We rely on a mathematical model of
reality in which space is a Platonic ideal: smooth, homogeneous, isotropic, and ﬂat.
Everything that breaks that underlying symmetry is attributed to objects: a planet
whose gravity causes things to fall in a preferred direction, and whose rotation makes
another object appear to move through the sky, the hills and valleys of my home town,
and lovely tropical islands. We think that space is simple, that objects are compli-
cated, and that the job of scientists is to understand the messy behavior of objects
against the perfect backdrop of space.
This idealization of perfect space and imperfect contents makes for a lovely the-
ory, but is it correct? It was accepted almost without question for over 20 centuries,
from the ancient Greeks through the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment. In the late
19th century, however, it started to break down. While the theory works very well
to describe physics on many length scales, it gives results that are nonsensical, or

at least that contradict experiment, when dealing with very big things, very small
things, and very fast things.
In this essay, I’ll touch brieﬂy on the new theories that were developed to deal
with these discrepancies—special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics
and string theory. I’ll then turn to the suggestion, popularized by Stephen Wolfram
[1], that space and time aren’t smooth at all, but come in essentially discrete chunks.
Using recent results from the theory of aperiodic tilings, I’ll argue that this last sug-
gestion is not realistic, and will defend the conventional wisdom that Euclidean space
and time, as modiﬁed slightly by 20th century physics, is still the best way to describe
reality.
22.1
Relativity and the Fall of Euclidean Space
If space and time are absolutes, then how fast are we moving? After all, the earth
rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun, the sun revolves around the center of
the galaxy, and the galaxy tumbles through the universe. We must be moving, but in
what direction, and how fast? In 1887, Michelson and Morley [2] tried to ﬁnd out.
They ﬁgured that light moving in the same direction as us would appear to be moving
slower (since it has to catch up with us), that light moving in the opposite direction
would appear to be moving faster, and that light moving perpendicular to our motion
would have an intermediate speed. With a clever interferometry experiment, they
measured these diﬀerences and got exactly zero, suggesting that we were not moving
at all! How could that be?
Several complicated mechanisms were proposed for why the speed of light
appeared to be the same in all directions. It took almost 20 years, until Einstein’s
1905 Special Theory of Relativity [3], for mankind to realize that the laws of mechan-
ics and electromagnetism, and hence the speed of light, really were the same relative
to the earth, to the sun, and to the distant galaxies. Diﬀerent observers moving rel-
ative to one another have diﬀerent notions of space and diﬀerent notions of time,
but the same laws of physics. Space and time are not absolutes, but are only deﬁned
relative to an observer. Moreover, they are closely linked, and switching from one
reference frame to another is like a rotation in a 4-dimensional space-time1 As such,
it is impossible to speak of the nature of space without also considering the nature
of time, and vice-versa. To know one is to know both.
Einstein took things a step further in his 1915 General Theory of Relativity (GR)
[4]. He proposed that space-time is not ﬂat. Rather, the presence of mass, momentum
and energy causes space to bend, and we perceive this bending as gravity. We can no
longer place perfect space and imperfect matter in separate categories. Matter bends
space and the geometry of space aﬀects matter. If the distribution of matter isn’t
1When you rotate in the x-y plane, the new value of x depends on both the old values of x and the old
value of y. Likewise, when you do a “Lorentz transformation” from one reference frame to another,
the new position depends on both the old position and the old time, as does the new time.

uniform and isotropic, then neither is the geometry of space-time. Matter is lumpy,
so space-time is bumpy.
Since that time, GR has been tested in numerous experiments, and has performed
extremely well, most recently in the 2016 observation of gravitational radiation. GR
may not be the ultimate theory and may require tweaking in the future (In particular,
Sakharov [5] has argued that it is just the ﬁrst term in an inﬁnite series of corrections
to Newton’s Laws), but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that, on extremely large
length scales, the Platonic ideal of space-time just doesn’t work.
22.2
Quantum Mechanics and the Very Small
A diﬀerent challenge to classical physics came when studying very small distances.
According to classical physics, a glowing hot object should emit a certain amount of
long-wavelength infrared light. It should emit more shorter-wavelength visible light,
still more ultraviolet light, yet more x-rays, and so on. Not only is the bulk of the
radiation supposed to be of such high frequency that a coal from your backyard grill
would kill you, but the total amount of energy emitted per unit time is supposed to
be inﬁnite.
To explain why glowing coals aren’t lethal, Planck [6] proposed that light energy
can only be emitted or absorbed in discrete chunks, called quanta. This theory of
light, called quantum mechanics, was soon extended to all forms of matter and energy
and then generalized to ﬁelds that describe the creation and annihilation of particles.
This body of work took care of the “ultraviolet catastrophe” that puzzled Planck, but
created other mysteries.
For one, Heisenberg [7] observed that quantities that were once thought to be
precise, like the position and momentum of a particle, are actually a bit fuzzy. There
is uncertainty to position, there is uncertainly to momentum, and the product of the
two uncertainties is at least Planck’s constant divided by 4𝜋. Likewise, there is uncer-
tainly in energy and uncertainty in the time when things happen. By general relativ-
ity, the curvature of space is a function of mass and energy and momentum, but these
quantities can’t be nailed down. So not only are particles fuzzy, but space-time itself
is fuzzy.
Worse still, the inﬁnities that appeared in the ultraviolet catastrophe aren’t com-
pletely tamed. By the uncertainty principle in energy, particles can blink in and out
of existence. In many problems in quantum ﬁeld theory, the eﬀect of all these “vir-
tual particles” could be inﬁnite, which doesn’t make sense. To avoid these inﬁnites,
the laws of physics, and of geometry, have to become qualitatively diﬀerent at the
scale of the so-called “Planck length”. This is an incredibly small length of around
10−35 m, or about a septillionth the radius of an atomic nucleus. (You could ﬁt more
Planck-length sized particles into a single proton than you could ﬁt protons within a
million-mile diameter ball.)
According to string theory, space-time isn’t 4-dimensional. It’s actually
10-dimensional (or 11-dimensional in some versions), with all but 4 of the dimen-

sions wrapped up in a higher dimensional analogue of a surface, of size comparable
to the Planck length. Just as we can treat a thin 3-dimensional ﬁlament, such as a
human hair, as being eﬀectively 1-dimensional, our thin 10 or 11-dimensional uni-
verse is eﬀectively 4-dimensional.
A very diﬀerent solution has been advocated by Wolfram [1]. He suggests that
at very small length scales the universe is really 0-dimensional! His theory is that
space and time are actually discrete, with the possible points ordered in a neat array.
At each new time step, what is happening at each point in space depends only on
what was happening at that point, and at all adjacent points, an instant earlier. That
is, the universe is like a gigantic array of computers, each one updating based on
what its neighbors are doing.
22.3
Life on the Grid?
Such an array is called a “cellular automaton”. The past decades have seen an explo-
sion of work on cellular automatons, including notable advances by Wolfram him-
self. The most famous example of a cellular automaton is John Conway’s Game of
Life [8]. This game operates on a 2-dimensional grid of square “cells”, and time
advances in discrete steps called “ticks”. At any given time, each cell is either alive
or dead. At each tick of the clock, each live cell either survives or dies, depending
on the number of live cells in the 8 positions around it, and each dead cell either
stays dead or comes to life (“birth”) by a slightly diﬀerent rule. This simple game
exhibits amazingly complicated behavior, with intricate patterns propagating across
the screen.
Could a 3-dimensional version of this sort of game be a model for the complex
behavior of the real world? Wolfram says yes, but I say no. In the Game of Life,
signals propagate at a maximum speed, just like the speed of light, but this speed
depends on direction. Whether a cell at (0, 0) is alive or dead at time 0 aﬀects all
the neighboring cells at time 1, all the cells around those at time 2, and so on. After
n time steps, the cells that are potentially inﬂuenced by the initial situation form a
square with vertices at (n, n), (−n, n), (−n, −n) and (n, −n). Signals propagate fastest
in the diagonal directions and slowest sideways or up-and-down. This contradicts the
experimental fact that the speed of light is the same in all directions.
You might argue that this contradiction resulted from the details of the Game
of Life, and that diﬀerent rules might give a diﬀerent speed of light. It’s true that
more complicated rules can make things a bit more isotropic, but they can’t make
things completely round. As long as each cell has a ﬁnite number of neighbors, there
will always be a ﬁnite number of directions in which information runs fastest, and
intermediate directions in which information runs slower. Put another way, if the
underlying geometry of space-time is a grid, then there will always be physical phe-
nomena that reveal the underlying axes of the grid, in the same way that the facets
of a crystal reveal the underlying arrangement of the atoms inside.

283
(An important caveat: Computers use grids to model continuous and isotropic sys-
tems all the time. However, these numerical models only work well when looking
at patterns that move much slower than the maximum transmission speed of infor-
mation, a.k.a. the speed of light. Cellular automata can accurately model a world
governed by Newton’s laws, and can be very useful in understanding a cold weather
front that is moving at 15 miles per hour, but they can’t handle extreme relativistic
motion.)
22.4
Life in a Raindrop?
The universe isn’t a grid, but can it still be discrete? Just because a crystal can’t
be round doesn’t mean that we can’t make something round (or at least round to
the naked eye) out of atoms. The raindrops falling outside my window say that you
can! If you take a bunch of building blocks and assemble them randomly, as with
the grains of sand in a sand pile or the water molecules in a raindrop, the resulting
structure is unlikely to have any preferred directions.
However, random structures have their own problems. Imagine a small explosion
in the middle of a sand pile. The sound from that explosion wouldn’t go straight to
our ears, but instead would ricochet oﬀof the various grains of sound in random
directions. The sound would go in all directions at essentially the same speed, but
diﬀerent paths would take diﬀerent amounts of time to reach us. What started out
as a sharp BANG! would be heard as a not-so-sharp roar. The wave properties of
sound (constructive and destructive interference) could reduce this eﬀect but can-
not eliminate it. Waves of diﬀerent frequencies work their way through the maze at
slightly diﬀerent rates; in raindrops, this distortion causes rainbows. Waves propa-
gating through random media always get distorted and smeared.
However, signals from distant galaxies do not get blurred as they travel to us
through empty space. The neutrino bursts from a supernova, or the gravitational
waves from the merging of two black holes, travel for billions of years across the
universe and then hit us in an instant. We don’t see any of the fuzziness that would
be expected from random space-time.
In addition to the experimental evidence against random discrete space-time, such
a model would raise as many additional metaphysical questions as it would answer.
What determines the random structure at each point in space-time? The random
arrangements of sand in a sand pile reﬂect the details of how the grains of sand
were dropped and mixed, but there is no process by which space and time are cre-
ated. Space and time just are. Einstein famously objected to the role of pure chance
in quantum mechanics; this would be far worse.

22.5
Life in an Aperiodic Tiling?
Finally, we consider a possibility intermediate between random space-time and a
regular periodic grid. It is possible to have order without periodicity. For instance,
imagine a sequence of + signs and −signs. We start with a + sign and follow it with
its opposite to get +−. We then follow this with the opposite of the pair, namely −+,
to get + −−+. We then follow this with the opposite of + −−+, namely −+ +−,
to get + −−+ −+ +−. Continuing the process forever, we get a inﬁnite sequence,
called the Thue-Morse sequence, with the magical property that no pattern within it
(e.g., + −−+) ever repeats itself 3 times in a row. The Thue-Morse sequence is an
example of aperiodic order, in which the arrangements follow precise rules but are
not just the same pattern repeated over and over and over.
An interesting 2-dimensional aperiodic tiling is the pinwheel tiling [9] invented
by John Conway and Charles Radin. The basic tiles are right triangles with sides of
length 1 and 2 and hypotenuse of length
√
5. You can arrange ﬁve such tiles to make
a bigger triangle of the same shape, which we call a supertile of level 1. We can then
arrange ﬁve supertiles of level 1 to make a supertile of level 2, 5 of those to make a
supertile of level 3, and so on. This design is featured architecturally in Federation
Square in Melbourne, Australia, and in the author’s home (Fig. 22.1).

22
What’s Wrong with the Platonic Ideal of Space and Time?
285
The center tile of a supertile of level 1 is the same shape as the supertile, but
is rotated by the angle 𝜃0 = tan−1(1∕2). If the supertile of level 1 is in the center
of a supertile of level 2, then the center tile is rotated by 2𝜃0 relative to the level 2
supertile. Continuing the process, we get rotations by arbitrary multiples of 𝜃0.
However, 𝜃0 is an irrational number of degrees, so no multiple of 𝜃0 will ever
take you back exactly to the direction you started in. The pinwheel tiling has tiles
pointing in inﬁnitely many diﬀerent directions, and all directions are equally likely.
(In technical language, the distribution of directions is uniform on the circle.) While
the tiles themselves are pointy triangles, the statistical properties of the pinwheel
tiling are rotationally invariant, with no directions preferred over any others. Could
the pinwheel tiling, or something like it, be a discrete model for a seemingly isotropic
universe?
The problem is that the rotational invariance only manifests itself in the limit
of inﬁnite size, and develops incredibly slowly. An nth level supertile has 5n tiles
that appear in only 8n diﬀerent directions, with a still smaller number of directions
accounting for the vast majority of the tiles. If the tiles were the size of the Planck
length, then a Milky Way Galaxy-sized supertile might have 10110 ∼5160 tiles in it,
but the bulk of those tiles would only be pointing in about 100 diﬀerent directions.
Even at astronomical length scales, space would not look isotropic.
Things are qualitatively the same for all 2-dimensional hierarchical tilings, and
only slightly better in 3 dimensions. To get around the 2-dimensional limitations,
Conway and Radin devised a 3-dimensional generalization of the pinwheel tiling,
called the quaquaversal tiling (Latin for “every which way”) [10]. The number of
relevant directions does grow faster than for the pinwheel, but a galaxy-sized super-
tile would still only feature a few thousand relevant directions [11].

Conclusions
The Platonic ideal of perfectly uniform and symmetric 3-dimensional space, cou-
pled with perfectly uniform 1-dimensional time, did not stand up to 20th century
physics. Special relativity shows that we can’t study space and time separately, but
must instead think about 4-dimensional space-time. General relativity shows that
space is not ﬂat, but bends and curves in response to the matter that is in it. Quantum
mechanics says that this matter is fundamentally uncertain, making the structure of
space-time uncertain. Furthermore, something fundamentally diﬀerent has to hap-
pen at the ultra-microscopic Planck length.
String theory says that, at the Planck scale, space-time is actually 10 or 11-
dimensional, with all but 4 dimensions curled up into a tight ball. Many of us are
very skeptical of string theory and open to alternatives, since there is absolutely
no experimental evidence in string theory’s favor. (To be fair, there is almost no
experimental evidence against it, either. We simply don’t know how to probe things
that small.) However, the suggestion that the universe is a gigantic automaton, with
space-time being essentially discrete, doesn’t hold up, either.

If the universe were built on a lattice, then the directions of that lattice could be
detected from physical phenomena occurring near the speed of light, and in partic-
ular by the propagation of light itself. If the universe were built with random local
geometry, then light would not have a precise speed, and diﬀerent parts of a sig-
nal would travel at slightly diﬀerent speeds and directions, much as a prism splits
light into diﬀerently colored beams. If the universe were modeled on an aperiodic
tiling with rotational symmetry in a statistical sense, there would still be preferred
directions at the scale of actual experiments.
All of the simple explanations have failed us. Platonic space-time works very well
for day-to-day life, but the details of the actual universe are more complicated and
mysterious that our human intelligences can currently fathom. Not because humans
are stupid, but because we have the privilege of living in a universe of awe-inspiring
subtlety and splendor.
Enjoy the ride.

The Fundamental Problem of Dynamics
Julian Barbour
Abstract In a world in which all objects are in relative motion, there arises the prob-
lem of equilocality: the identiﬁcation of points in space that have the same position
at diﬀerent times. Newton recognized this as the fundamental problem of dynamics
and to solve it introduced absolute space. Inspired by Mach, Einstein created gen-
eral relativity in the hope of eliminating this controversial concept, but his indirect
approach left the issue unresolved. I will explain how the general method of best
matching always leads to dynamical theories with an unambiguous notion of equi-
locality. Applied to the dynamics of Riemannian 3-geometry, it leads to a radical
rederivation of general relativity in which relativity of local scale replaces replaces
relativity of simultaneity as a foundational principle. Whereas in the standard space-
time picture there is no unique notion of simultaneity or history, if this alternative
derivation leads to the physically correct picture both are ﬁxed in the minutest detail.
New approaches to several outstanding problems, including singularities and the ori-
gin of time’s arrows, are suggested.

Introduction
In his unpublished De Gravitatione [1], Newton addressed what might be called the
fundamental problem of dynamics: if all motion is relative, how can one identify
a point in space that has the same location at diﬀerent times? This is the problem
of equilocality. Because he did not present the problem or repeat his arguments in
the Principia, the issue has attracted little attention. In this paper, I will take direct
resolution of the problem as the basis of an alternative derivation of general relativ-
ity (for a complementary account, see [2]). The main justiﬁcation for this are new
research avenues that are opened up. It is also interesting to see how Einstein’s the-

ory can be derived and radically reformulated following essentially one single idea:
the deﬁnition of position at diﬀerent instants of time.
My starting point is Leibniz’s notion of space. Although it does not solve the
problem, it is a ﬁrst step. I then describe the creation of dynamical theories by best
matching, which always leads to a notion of equilocality. Equations that govern the
evolution of Riemannian 3-geometries are obtained more or less directly by appli-
cation of best matching under the condition that only angles, but not lengths, can be
compared at spatially separated points. This leads to shape dynamics [2]. Remark-
ably, one recovers not only Einstein’s evolution equations in a distinguished foliation
but also, in a single package, a prescription for how the initial-value problem of gen-
eral relativity is to be solved and the resulting Cauchy data are to be evolved. To the
extent the evolution can be continued, this leads to construction of an Einsteinian
spacetime in a foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces of constant mean extrinsic cur-
vature and simultaneously a ﬁbration of the spacetime by timelike curves that pass
through equilocal points deﬁned by best matching. It is in this sense that history is
ﬁxed in minutest detail.
23.2
The Relational Deﬁnition of Position
In his famous correspondence [3] with Clarke, Leibniz rejected Newton’s absolute
space and time, mainly on the basis the principle of the identity of indiscernibles: if
two supposedly distinct things or states are in fact indistinguishable, then they are in
fact one and the same. This led Leibniz to argue that
if space was an absolute being, there would something happen for which it would be impos-
sible there should be a suﬃcient reason... Space is something absolutely uniform; and,
without the things placed in it, one point of space does not absolutely diﬀer in any respect
whatsoever from another point of space. Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be
something in itself, besides the order of bodies among themselves,) that ‘tis impossible there
should be a reason, why God, preserving the same situations of bodies among themselves,
should have placed them in space after one certain particular manner, and not otherwise;
why everything was not placed quite the contrary way, for instance, by changing East into
West.
When Clarke objected that “space and time are quantities; which situation and
order are not” Leibniz responded
I will here show, how men come to form to themselves the notion of space. They consider
that many things exist at once and they observe in them a certain order of co-existence,
according to which the relation of one thing to another is more or less simple. This order,
is their situation or distance. When it happens that one of those co-existent things changes
its relation to a multitude of others, which do not change their relation among themselves;
and that another thing, newly come, acquires the same relation to the others, as the former
had; we then say, it is come into the place of the former; and this change, we call a motion in
that body... And though many, or even all the co-existent things, should change according
to certain known rules of direction and swiftness; yet one may always determine the relation
of situation, which every co-existent acquires with respect to every other co-existent... And

23
The Fundamental Problem of Dynamics
289
supposing, or feigning, that among those co-existents, there is a suﬃcient number of them,
which have undergone no change; then we say, that those which have such a relation to those
ﬁxed existents, as others had to them before, have now the same place which those others
had. And that which comprehends all those places, is called space.
Note, ﬁrst, that Leibniz equates situation with distance without saying how that
is determined and, second, his deﬁnition of space requires “a multitude of others,
which do not change their relation among themselves”. This means that he had not
given a deﬁnition of space applicable to the realistic situation in which all bodies of
the universe are in motion relative to each other. As I noted, Newton had introduced
absolute space precisely to overcome this problem (without explaining the diﬃculty
in the Principia). The comment that if all bodies move relative to each other “yet
one may always determine the relation of situation, which every co-existent acquires
with respect to every other co-existent” is correct at a given instant but does not solve
the real problem: how can one pair up points whose positions are deﬁned relationally
at diﬀerent times and say they are at the same place.
This is the problem of equilocality. Unless it is solved, dynamics (understood as
the evolution of relative conﬁgurations) has no ﬁrm foundation. Consider the prin-
ciple of least action, which plays a truly essential role in both classical and quantum
dynamics. The calculation of the action is impossible if one cannot quantify dis-
placements of particles, which in turn is impossible without a notion of equilocality.
The Leibniz–Clarke correspondence gives no guidance on this. In Sect. 23.4, I will
show how equilocality can be deﬁned provided certain conditions are met. First it
will be helpful to present a notion of space somewhat diﬀerent from Leibniz’s.
23.3
Space as the Order of Coexisting Facts
As we have seen, Leibniz claimed that space is the order of coexisting things and,
when pushed, deﬁned order as the distance between things. However, Leibniz did not
say how distance, which plays a primary role in his notion of space, is to be deter-
mined. I have not researched the history of distance determination, which clearly
involves measurement and is part of the beautiful discipline of metrology. I will
merely note that in the famous lecture given in 1854 in which he introduced his
generalization of Euclidean geometry, Riemann said that “measurement consists of
placing the quantities that are to be compared on top of each other”.
At least since the dawn of agriculture, distance measurement has been been impor-
tant and remarkably easy thanks to one of what I call ‘the gifts of nature’, by which
I mean the ready availability of measuring rods in the form of straight sticks like
bamboo canes or ropes. These have an empirical property of the utmost importance:
to a high degree they remain mutually congruent. I can take one short cane as unit,
use it to mark notches on as many other long canes as I like, move them around indi-
vidually over large distances and then bring them back together. The ratios of their
lengths, as measured by the notches, will not have changed perceptibly. It was surely

290
J. Barbour
thanks to this basic property of rods that Pythagoras’ theorem was discovered by the
ancient Egyptians at the latest about 4000 years ago.
Now consider this scenario. Suppose N, N ≥5, ﬁxed points in our familiar three-
dimensional space. Let the N(N −1)∕2 distances between them be measured, yield-
ing a corresponding number of positive numbers. These numbers, the measured dis-
tances, are empirical facts. A priori, there is no reason why they should bear any
relation to each other. However, it turns out that, provided N ≥5, they will satisfy
certain algebraic relations that will hold to the accuracy with which the measure-
ments have been made and our space is Euclidean. In other words, certain combina-
tions of these distances will, to the corresponding accuracy, be zero. Such a state of
aﬀairs is a profound fact and indicates the existence of a controlling law.
The consequences of the law are remarkable. It makes data compression possi-
ble. Instead of representing the geometrical arrangement of the N points by means
of the N(N −1)∕2 positive numbers, one can express it by means of 3N coordinates,
conveniently taken to be Cartesian (𝐫a, a = 1, … , N). The measured distances, the
separations rab ∶= |𝐫a −𝐫b|, are invariant under the Euclidean translations and rota-
tions that can be applied to the 𝐫a. If N is large, the data compression is very sig-
niﬁcant since the number of distances grows as the square of the number of ﬁxed
points (Leibniz’s coexisting things), whereas the number of coordinates grows only
linearly.
The essential geometry revealed by the possibility of data compression can be
taken one step further by the introduction of the root-mean-square length of the sys-
tem:
𝓁rms ∶=
√∑
a<b
r2
ab, rab ∶= |𝐫a −𝐫b|.
(23.1)
If we now divide all the rab by 𝓁rms, the resulting ̃rab = rab∕𝓁rms still satisfy algebraic
relations analogous to the ones I have already described. However, they are now ‘lib-
erated’ from the arbitrary the unit of length and therefore scale-invariant. The scale-
free separations ̃rab are invariants of the similarity group (Euclidean translations
and rotations augmented by dilatations). In modern terms, Leibniz’s case against
Newton, as applied to a single conﬁguration, is that it is the invariants ̃rab which
deﬁne reality.
In the light of this discussion, what then is space? Intuitively, many people
(including Newton one suspects) think of it as something like a perfectly translu-
cent block of ice. I would argue that this is a mistake. It reiﬁes the data compression
of empirical facts found in observable relations into space. The empirical facts and
the relations they satisfy are all we need. They ensure the data compression and
our intuitive understanding. Here it is worth quoting Piaget [4], who comments that
“space is often conceived as an empty box into which bodies are ﬁtted” but says
space is not a container. It is the totality of the relationships between the bodies we perceive
or imagine, or rather, the totality of the relationships we use to endow these bodies with a
structure. Space is in fact the logic of the apparent world or at least one of the two essential
aspects (the other being time).

23
The Fundamental Problem of Dynamics
291
This seems to me very close to the scenario I described, the only diﬀerence being
the quantitative sharpening made possible by the ‘gifts’ nature gives us in the form
of near perfect measuring rods.
In summary, I replace Leibniz’s aphorism “space is the order of coexisting things”
with space is “the order of coexisting facts”. There is a ‘totality of relationships’. Our
intuition gives us a conceptual space that enables us to understand the logic of the
world and predict its consequences.
23.4
Best Matching
As we have seen, Leibniz failed to give a satisfactory deﬁnition of motion in a uni-
verse in which all things are in motion relative to each other. However, he did point
out that, in any given instant, the distances between all the bodies in the universe
will be well deﬁned. I now want to show how equilocality, and with it motion, can
deﬁned relationally if the number of bodies in the universe is ﬁnite. Ironically, the
key to this is to use the very thing that Leibniz employed to argue against the reality
of absolute space: the possibility, in imagination, to place one and the same rela-
tive conﬁguration of the universe in diﬀerent positions in conceptual space without
changing anything observable. The ‘moving to diﬀerent positions and orientations’
is achieved mathematically by means of the generators of Euclidean translations and
rotations. Scaling (dilation) brings in fascinating issues which I will discuss later.
Best matching does not use the Euclidean generators to move relative conﬁgura-
tions in space but relative to each other. For simplicity, let us suppose the conceptual
space is two dimensional, so we can picture it as a ﬂat table. Let us also consider the
simplest possible non-trivial dynamical situation of three distinguishable point par-
ticles of masses ma, a = 1, 2, 3, interacting through Newtonian gravity.
We start with a single conﬁguration: a triangle with the particles at its vertices. We
can lay the triangle on the table wherever we please and then, like Leibniz, use the
generators to move it anywhere else. We choose one position. Now we take another,
slightly diﬀerent triangle. We can lay it on the table in any position we choose. Each
position will correspond to certain displacements of the particles. Because of the
freedom in the diﬀerent placings, it seems we cannot say there have been any deﬁnite
motions. This is the problem of relative motion. But there is one placing of the second
triangle relative to the ﬁrst that is uniquely singled out.
To see that, suppose Cartesian coordinates on the table and let the positions of
the particles in the ﬁrst triangle be 𝐫a and those of the second in an arbitrary placing
be ̄𝐫a. Now consider the quantity
dstrial =
√∑
a
ma|𝐫a −̄𝐫a|2.
(23.2)

292
J. Barbour
This is a positive deﬁnite quantity and, for some position of the second triangle
relative to the ﬁrst, must have a minimum. Let this best matched (bm) position be
𝐫a + d𝐫bm
a . Then
dsbm =
√∑
a
mad𝐫bm
a
⋅d𝐫bm
a
(23.3)
deﬁnes a metric on the space of relative conﬁgurations (relative conﬁguration space:
RCS) [5, 6]. As I said, best matching keeps Leibnizian displacement of relative con-
ﬁgurations but not to place them diﬀerently in space but relative to each other. The
freedom that created the problem becomes the solution to it. Best matching applies
to any ﬁnite number of particles and has important properties:
∙dsbm (23.3) is independent of the position of the ﬁrst triangle in the conceptual space. The
best-matched pair can be moved around in that space in exactly the way Leibniz imag-
ined moving a single conﬁguration around in absolute space without changing anything
observable. The dsbm are invariants of the Euclidean group.
∙dsbm (23.3) is unchanged under swapping of the ﬁrst for the second triangle. The resulting
dynamics is time-reversal symmetric.
∙Best matching establishes a unique pairing of any one point on the ﬁrst triangle with a
best-matched point on the second triangle. A notion of equilocality is well deﬁned.
∙Best matching brings the centres of mass of the conﬁgurations to coincidence and
‘squeezes’ the relative rotation out of the pair. The instantaneous state of the best-matched
system has vanishing momentum 𝐏and angular momentum 𝐋.
We can now deﬁne best-matched N-body dynamics on the timeless relative con-
ﬁguration space. Suppose two such conﬁgurations A and B and any continuous curve
joining them in the RCS and for it calculate
Atrial = ∫
B
A
√
(E −V)
∑
a
ma(𝐫a + d𝐫bm
a ) ⋅(𝐫a + d𝐫bm
a ),
(23.4)
where E is a constant and V, a potential, is a function on the RCS. For all such
curves, one seeks (as in the standard procedure of the calculus of variations) the one
that extremalizes (23.4).
There is now a very interesting way to ‘stack’ the successive conﬁgurations in
the conceptual space. Place A anywhere. Then move all the conﬁgurations, one
after another, into their best-matched position relative to their predecessors (for
one of the two possible directions chosen for the advance of time). This is called
horizontal stacking in [5] and leads to dynamical best-matched evolution in the
conceptual space with moreover a uniquely preferred time labelling obtained by
vertical stacking [5, 7].
When this is all done, it is found, ﬁrst, that the particles evolve in the stacked con-
ceptual space, which is inﬁnitely many copies of the one needed for a single conﬁg-
uration, exactly as would a system in absolute space and time. Newton’s framework
is not presupposed but derived. Second, the system will have energy E and vanish-
ing angular momentum: 𝐋= 0. This latter condition does not follow from Newton’s

23
The Fundamental Problem of Dynamics
293
equations and is a prediction of the theory. The total momentum 𝐏will also be zero
in the stacked frame, but one can always ﬁnd an inertial frame in which that happens
in Newtonian theory. In [5] it was asserted that in such an approach the constant E
must also vanish, but the argument for that was ﬂawed.
An argument for E = 0 is scale invariance. In Newtonian dynamics both E and
𝐋are conserved. If therefore they vanish at some initial time, they will vanish at all
subsequent times. Now to give magnitude to E and 𝐋one needs an external scale,
which Leibniz would surely reject. However, vanishing of E and 𝐋remains true
whatever the scale (choice of unit). This argument for scale invariance is supported
by the principle of suﬃcient reason: if the energy is to have some value, what reason
can one give for it to have one value rather than another? A reason for zero is that it
alone is independent of the choice of unit.
Although such an argument is not decisive—it would also require a vanishing cos-
mological constant—scale invariance comes into consideration in another way. As
noted in [8, 9], the N-body problem with E = 𝐋= 0 has a very interesting property.
In all of its solutions, except for a set of measure zero, there is a point J at which the
system’s size, as measured by its centre-of-mass moment of inertia, passes through
a unique minimum and rises to inﬁnity in both time directions. In [9], this point is
called the Janus point J by analogy with the Roman god because the two halves of
the evolution curve are qualitatively the same either side of J and deﬁne arrows of
time that point in opposite directions away from J. A further striking property of
the point J is that at it one can specify fully scale invariant ‘mid-point’ data that
determine the evolution in either direction away from J [9]. Thus, all the solution-
determining information that is encoded in the mid-point data (and conserved by the
dynamical evolution) is represented in a form invariant under the action of the simi-
larity group. We recall that this group expresses the essence of Euclidean geometry
and leads to the construction of the conceptual space from the ‘totality of relation-
ships’ that Piaget identiﬁed as the true basis of our notion of space.
It may also be mentioned that throughout the 20th century many physicists,
including Schrödinger, repeatedly rediscovered a relational mechanics of N mass
points based on replacement of the kinetic term ∑
a ma ̇𝐫a ⋅̇𝐫a in the Newtonian action
by
W =
∑
a<b
̇r2
ab
rab
, rab ∶= |𝐫a −𝐫b|.
(23.5)
Such an action, augmented by the Newton potential, leads to a very interesting rela-
tional theory, see [10]. However, it suﬀers from a fatal defect: it predicts anisotropy
of eﬀective inertial masses at a level ruled out to many orders of magnitude by the
most accurate null experiments, of Hughes–Drever type [11], so far performed in
physics. This led Bertotti and myself to abandon our original Leibnizian/Machian
proposal based on (23.5) and replace it by the theory of [5] based on best matching,
in which there is no mass anisotropy. It is well known that Einstein sought to employ
the equivalence principle to implement Mach’s call for the replacement of absolute
motion by relative motion. It is interesting that isotropy of inertial mass, and with

294
J. Barbour
it certain aspects of Lorentz invariance, is now conﬁrmed by generalizations of the
Hughes–Drever experiment to many orders of magnitude better than the equivalence
principle.
23.5
Equilocality in Dynamical Geometry
It is striking that in creating metric geometry in 1854 Riemann did not take into
account his words I cited in Sect. 23.3: “measurement consists of placing the quan-
tities that are to be compared on top of each other”. Indeed, the central section of his
paper is headed Metrical relationships that a n-dimensional manifold can have under
the assumption that any interval can be measured by any other. The ﬁnal words here
mean that intervals have a deﬁnite length whatever their position in the considered
manifold. In other words, intervals at spatially separated points can be said to have
the same length even though there is obviously no way in which they can be laid on
top of each other to conﬁrm that fact.
The analogy between Riemann’s assumption and the implicit assumption of a
universal notion of simultaneity at spatially separated points is obvious. The diﬃ-
culty with simultaneity was ﬁrst clearly noted by Poincaré in 1898 [12] and resolved
in 1905 by him and Einstein. So far as I know, the ﬁrst person to note the signiﬁ-
cance of Riemann’s assumption was Weyl in 1918 [13]. In 1916 Levi-Civita (soon
followed independently by Weyl) had discovered parallel transport. Weyl noted that
parallel transport of a vector in a Riemannian space brings it back to its original posi-
tion with a changed angle but the same length. Weyl called this rigidity of length
and the last vestige of Euclidean ‘distance geometry’ (Ferngeometrie). To elimi-
nate it, he introduced the notion of parallel transport of length by means of a new
1-form ﬁeld, for which he coined the term gauge. Although his idea was later to play
a key role in the discovery of the various gauge theories that underlie the standard
model of particle physics, Weyl’s initial belief in the identity of his 1-form ﬁeld and
the analogous gauge ﬁeld in electromagnetism ran into the well known diﬃculties
that Einstein noted.
In fact, Weyl’s desire to eliminate ‘distance geometry’ can be realized, without
introduction of any auxiliary ﬁeld, at the level of three-dimensional Riemannian, i.e.,
with +++ signature, geometry as opposed to the −+++ Lorentzian four-geometry
with which Weyl worked, no doubt because, as he emphasized in the strongest terms
in his book Space–Time–Matter, he believed there could be no way back from the
four-dimensional world of Einstein and Minkowski.
However, there is a case for taking a step back if one can then take two forward
or, as the French say, reculer pour mieux sauter. The ‘jumping oﬀpoint’ to shape
dynamics [2] is that though lengths at spatially separated points cannot be directly
compared (any more than clock readings can) angles are absolute. Their determina-
tion is purely local. Thus, a radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by
an arc equal in length to the radius, which can be taken inﬁnitesimally small. Such
an angle emerges from an ‘order of coexisting facts’ and truly belongs to a point.

23
The Fundamental Problem of Dynamics
295
Bearing this in mind, consider now a Riemannian metric gab in a three-
dimensional manifold. At any point gab is represented by a symmetric 3 × 3 matrix.
Three of its six coordinates encode coordinate information, two encode information
about the angle between curves in the manifold that meet at the considered point, and
one is a local scale factor. Following Weyl’s argument and by analogy with the objec-
tion to simultaneity at spatially separated points, this is the one datum that needs to
be questioned: two such scales at spatially separated points cannot be compared. It
may already be noted that the two angle degrees of freedom in gab, which constitute
the conformal part of the geometry, match the two degrees of freedom per space
point associated with the gravitational ﬁeld in general relativity.
It is well known that Cliﬀord, who had translated Riemann’s 1854 paper, mooted
the idea that three-dimensional Riemannian geometry could be dynamical (see
[14], p. 1202). If we say that only position-independent aspects of geometry are
real, as opposed to gauge, then we should look to construct dynamics of con-
formal 3-metrics (deﬁned as equivalence classes of a Riemannian 3-metrics with
respect to conformal transformations). If we assume a spatially closed universe, the
dynamical arena will be the space of all conformal 3-geometries on a closed 3-
manifold: conformal superspace, which is obtained by quotienting Riem (the space
of Riemannian 3-geometries) by three-dimensional spatial and conformal transfor-
mations. The resulting group is analogous to the similarity group of Euclidean geom-
etry and may be called the Riemann group.
The question then arises of whether one can create a dynamics of conformal 3-
geometries by best matching with respect to the Riemann group. The answer is yes
[15]. The theory turns out to be vacuum general relativity derived in a manner that
bears only a remote connection with Einstein’s derivation and has some remarkable
additions and restrictions that I will list shortly. The basic idea is already clearly
suggested by the manner in which we imagined slightly diﬀerent triangles ‘placed on
top of each other’ and moved relative to each other into their best-matching position.
In dynamical geometry, we suppose two 3-metrics gab(x) and ̄gab(x),
̄gab(x) = gab(x) + 𝜕gab(x)
𝜕𝜏
that diﬀer slightly and imagine them initially placed ‘on top of each other’ by saying
that points in the two metrics with the same coordinate x are equilocal. As quantity to
be extremalized by best matching, it is natural, without at this stage worrying about
simultaneity at spatially separated points, to take
Atrial = ∫d𝜏∫d3x
√
R G abcd 𝜕gab

𝜕gcd
𝜕𝜏,
(23.6)
where R is the (three-dimensional) scalar curvature and Gabcd = gacgbd −𝜆gabgcd
(𝜆is an as yet undetermined parameter and 𝜏is a time label). I won’t attempt to give
a detailed ﬁrst-principles derivation of the ansatz (23.6) except to say that the square
root ensures reparametrization invariance and hence the absence of an external time.

What is critical is the taking of the square root before the integration over space. This
leads to one quadratic constraint per space point. Its interplay with the constraints
that arise from the diﬀeomorphism and conformal best matching ensures that the
geometry has the two expected dynamical degrees of freedom. Another critical point
is that the conformal best matching is marginally restricted to transformations that
preserve the spatial volume and merely redistribute the local scale factor det gab. The
restriction makes it possible for the universe to expand and necessitates the inclusion
of 𝜆in Gabcd.
As regards the main things that emerge from this shape-dynamic approach, I sim-
ply give the main results with references to their derivations:
∙Best matching creates a succession of conformal 3-geometries that, at least in an open
neighbourhood, stacks by equilocality into a four-dimensional spacetime that satisﬁes
the Einstein equations [15].
∙A point and tangent vector in conformal superspace determine such a succession of con-
formal 3-geometries [16].
∙Best matching also prescribes solution of the initial-value problem of general relativity
by the method that York [17] found by trial and error in 1972. The restriction to volume-
preserving conformal transformations explains York’s hitherto unexplained scaling law
for the trace of the extrinsic curvature [15].
∙Best matching imposes a distinguished foliation of the emergent spacetime by surfaces
of constant mean extrinsic curvature (CMC surfaces) and ensures its propagation by also
requiring a lapse-ﬁxing equation to be satisﬁed [15].
∙The attempt to couple matter ﬁelds to the evolving conformal geometry enforces a uni-
versal light cone (and with it the value −1 of the DeWitt supermetric in (23.6) [18]. The
gauge principle for 1-form ﬁelds is also enforced. The taking of the square root at each
space point in (23.6) is crucial for these results.
I think it must be agreed that the solution to the equilocality problem, which New-
ton so clearly formulated in De Gravitazione perhaps already 20 years before he
wrote the Principia (and which Leibniz manifestly failed to solve), is thought provok-
ing. As Cliﬀord’s reaction showed, once Riemann had at least partially ‘loosened up’
geometry, so that it is only locally Euclidean, the idea of making geometry dynam-
ical was very natural. In fact, Riemann eﬀectively created the ADM phase space of
dynamical geometry and with it the two inﬁnite-dimensional Lie groups (diﬀeomor-
phic and conformal) that act on it. It is especially striking that a theory designed to
ensure that at spatially separated points only angles can be compared, ensuring rela-
tivity of local scale, simultaneously enforces relativity of simultaneity. One gets two
for the price of one—and the gauge principle for good measure. Note that Lorentz
invariance emerges late in the programme and, in contrast to Einstein’s route to gen-
eral relativity, is not a derivational postulate. The status of the equivalence principle
is interesting. Both it and isotropy of inertial mass are strongly suggested on empir-
ical grounds, but the extraordinarily high accuracy of Hughes–Drever type exper-
iments make them an even more powerful guide to theory construction—by best
matching—than the equivalence principle.

Caveats and Conclusions
The attentive reader will have noted the caveats “if this alternative derivation leads
to the physically correct picture” (in the abstract), “to the extent the evolution can
be continued” (in the introduction), and “at least in an open neighbourhood” (ﬁrst of
the ﬁnal set of bullet points). The fact is that the results of [15], including the crucial
unique solvability of the lapse-ﬁxing equation, ensure evolution in conformal super-
space and an emergent CMC-foliated spacetime only in an open neighbourhood. It
is well known that CMC foliations have ‘singularity-avoiding’ tendencies, but there
are solutions of general relativity in which the complete spacetime cannot be covered
by a CMC foliation. The best known example is the Schwarzschild solution.
However, this is not yet a failure of shape dynamics, which rules out all solu-
tions of general relativity for which space, as in a single Schwarzschild solution, is
not closed. It is obvious that the universe contains many collapsed objects. It also
appears to have begun very smooth, without any such objects. If shape dynamics is to
supplant the spacetime representation of gravity, a major (clearly daunting) research
project for it is to establish the extent to which the evolution in conformal superspace,
and with it CMC foliation of an emergent spacetime, can be continued. However, it
is encouraging that shape dynamics and the solution of what I have called the fun-
damental problem of dynamics suggest promising new directions of research, some
more immediately tractable:
∙The various arrows of time may have a dynamical origin and be nothing to do with
special conditions at the big bang [8, 9].
∙Since only shape degrees of freedom are regarded as physical, while scale is gauge,
this suggests reconsideration of the singularity theorems in general relativity. They
are generally held to signal the demise of classical spacetime, but that will not be
so if the shape evolution remains well behaved.
∙Most approaches to quantum gravity assume that space and time become discrete
at the Planck length. If best matching and the underlying assumption of continuity
that goes with it are foundational, the belief in discreteness may be unfounded.
∙In quantization, symmetry with respect to four-dimensional diﬀeo-morphisms
may be inappropriate. Instead, symmetry with respect to three-dimensional dif-
feomorphisms and conformal transformations is suggested.
∙If the approach based on best matching is correct, many solutions allowed in the
spacetime representation are ruled out. For example, spatial closure is required
and could lead to testable predictions.

General Relativity, Time, and Determinism
James Isenberg
Abstract Einstein’s theory of general relativity models the physical universe using
spacetimes which satisfy Einstein’s gravitational ﬁeld equations. To date, Einstein’s
theory has been enormously successful in modeling observed gravitational phenom-
ena, both at the astrophysical and the cosmological levels. The collection of space-
time solutions of Einstein’s equations which have been eﬀectively used for modeling
the physical universe is a very small subset of the full set of solutions. Among this
larger set, there are many spacetimes in which strange phenomena related to time
are present: There are solutions containing regions in which determinism and the
predictability of experimental outcomes breaks down (the Taub-NUT spacetimes),
and there others in which the breakdown of determinism occurs everywhere (the
Gödel universe). Should the existence of these strange solutions lead us to ques-
tion the usefulness of Einstein’s theory in modeling physical phenomena? Should
it instead lead us to seriously search for strange time phenomena in physics? Or
should we simply treat these solutions as anomalous (if embarrassing) distractions
which we can ignore? In this essay, after introducing some basic ideas of special and
general relativity and discussing what it means for a spacetime to be a solution of
Einstein’s equations, we explore the use of spacetime solutions for modeling astro-
physical events and cosmology. We then examine some of the spacetime solutions
in which determinism and causal relationships break down, we relate such phenom-
ena to Penrose’s “Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture”, and ﬁnally we discuss the
questions noted above.

Introduction
Two of the most widely-known eﬀects of relativity involve time. The “Twin Para-
dox” describes the diﬀerence in elapsed time which a pair of twins will record if one
of them travels very fast (close to the speed of light) relative to the other. The “Grav-
itational Time Dilation” also describes a diﬀerence in elapsed time recorded by a
pair of twins; in this case, between meetings, one of them lives in a much stronger
gravitational ﬁeld than the other.
Both of these eﬀects are fairly straightforward predictions of relativistic mechan-
ics. As such, they are necessarily present in any model of the universe which is
consistent with the broad principles of special and general relativity. Not surpris-
ingly, both of these eﬀects have been directly observed in our universe. As well,
although these relativistic time measurement eﬀects were originally perceived as
counter-intuitive and even disturbing (note the name “Twin Paradox”), physicists
now are quite reconciled to their presence in our physical universe.
General relativity predicts the possibility of other strange eﬀects related to time.
Speciﬁcally, there are models of the cosmos consistent with the principles of general
relativity in which observers can move cyclically in time. As well, there are models
in which causal relationships and determinism breakdown. Should such possibilities
be judged as realistic (and fascinating) predictions? Should they instead be judged
as an indication that Einstein’s theory of general relativity is seriously ﬂawed?
To be able to discuss these two alternatives, and to possibly choose between them,
it is important to understand what general relativity is, and what its role is in model-
ing the physical universe. Although a full understanding of general relativity requires
one to know some diﬀerential geometry and to know how to work with partial dif-
ferential equations (PDEs), some of its key ideas can be understood without these
mathematical tools. We present some of these key ideas in Sect. 24.2, including the
notion of a spacetime solution of Einstein’s equations. These ideas are discussed
within the context of the conceptual development of special and general relativity.
In Sect. 24.3, we explore the use of spacetime solutions of Einstein’s equations for
modeling gravitational physics, noting the diﬀerence between the modeling of astro-
physical events and the modeling of the full cosmos. We proceed in Sect. 24.4 to
consider spacetime solutions in which causality and determinism break down. We
note the sense in which these eﬀects are consistent with general relativity, and we
describe the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture and the sense in which this con-
jecture argues that these eﬀects are essentially irrelevant for modeling our universe.
We make concluding remarks in Sect. 24.5.
24.2
Special Relativity and General Relativity
The conceptual framework used by scientists to model the physical world at extreme
scales changed profoundly during the ﬁrst two decades of the Twentieth Century. The
fairly intuitive ideas of Newtonian physics (developed during the late 1600s) work

very well for human-scale physical experiments such as tossing balls and sending
space probes to Pluto. However, to understand the interactions of subatomic parti-
cles, to study the dynamics of objects moving anywhere near the speed of light, and
to predict what happens in the presence of extremely dense concentrations of mass
and energy, it was found that radically new ways of thinking are needed.
We do not explore here the new ideas—quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld
theory—that are needed to work with subatomic and elementary particle physics.
Rather, we focus on special relativity and general relativity, which are needed to
study the behavior of objects which move very fast, and objects which are very mas-
sive and concentrated.
Gedanken (thought) experiments heavily inﬂuenced Einstein’s development of
both special and general relativity. In the case of special relativity (SR), it was think-
ing about electromagnetism that was most inﬂuential. Einstein was driven to under-
stand how the outcomes of Gendaken experiments with moving magnets and moving
conducting coils could be consistent with Maxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld (published in 1865). Einstein found that he could obtain this consistency only if
(a) he treated the speed of light as an observer-independent physical constant, and (b)
he dispensed with absolute measures of space and time, replacing them with locally
determined (observer-dependent) measures of distances and time intervals. Both of
these principles are completely at odds with the foundations of Newtonian theory,
which presumes that all observers (regardless of their relative motion) measure dis-
tances and time intervals identically; and presumes that if two observers measure
the motion of a light ray (or anything else), then their measurements must diﬀer in
accord with their relative motion.
Einstein based his formulation of special relativity on these two principles,
together with the empirically-based idea that to make measurements, an observer
must rely on a personal clock along with a device for emitting and detecting directed
light rays. Thus, to measure the length of a rod some distance away, an observer
bounces light rays oﬀeach end of the rod and uses the clock-measured time interval
between the return of the reﬂected rays to determine this length. Based on this mea-
surement procedure, along with the assumption that the speed of light is identical
for all observers, it is straightforward to calculate familiar SR phenomena such as
the Lorentz length contraction, which relates the measured length of a rod as seen
by two observers who are moving relative to each other.
Special relativity provides scientists with a new way to think about measurements
of time and space which ﬁts beautifully with Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism.
SR does this by prescribing how diﬀerent (relatively moving) observers 1 and 2
measure diﬀerent electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and then showing that the resulting
observations by 1 and 2 of these ﬁelds in the presence of moving magnets and
conducting coils (as per one of Einstein’s Gendaken experiments) are each consistent
with Maxwell’s theory.
Special relativity is not, however, consistent with Newton’s theory of the gravita-
tional ﬁeld. This inconsistency is evident, since Newton’s theory predicts that varia-
tions in the gravitational ﬁeld which are generated by the motion of massive objects
are manifest everywhere immediately, which contradicts the SR principle that no

302
J. Isenberg
signals can be transmitted faster than light-speed. As well, there are no transforma-
tions of the Newtonian gravitational ﬁelds such that the experimental measurements
made by observers in diﬀerent frames (with lengths and time intervals transforming
according to the rules of SR) are each consistent with Newton’s theory.
This inconsistency led Einstein to focus for the next ten years—from 1905 to
1915—on ﬁnding a new theory of the gravitational ﬁeld. Besides requiring this new
theory to be consistent with the principles of special relativity—no signals traveling
faster than the speed of light, and all measurements based on local considerations—
Einstein believed it to be essential that his new theory of gravity incorporate the
Equivalence Principle. In its simplest form, the Equivalence Principle embodies
the experimental fact that if a pair of bodies move in a ﬁxed gravitational ﬁeld—
say, that of the earth—with no other forces present (e.g., no friction or electromag-
netic forces), then their motion is identical, regardless of their masses or composi-
tion. Newton’s theory incorporates the Equivalence Principle in a somewhat ad hoc
way: According to Newton, the acceleration a of a given body is determined by the
imposed force F divided by the mass m of that body, and if the force F is gravita-
tional, then F is proportional to m. Hence for a body moving in a gravitational ﬁeld
the mass factor m cancels, and consequently the acceleration induced by the gravi-
tational force is independent of m. This works. However, Einstein believed it to be
crucial for his new theory of gravity that the Equivalence Principle be built into the
theory in a more essential way.
The most striking feature of general relativity—the name Einstein chose to label
his new theory of gravity—is its introduction of curved geometry into the setup it uses
to model the universe and the motion of bodies contained in it. The idea is simple,
but revolutionary: Instead of thinking about the universe as a ﬂat, featureless, static
background stage in which bodies move in response to imposed forces, one thinks
of it as a dynamic, curved space + time geometry in which the motion of bodies is
determined by this geometry. More speciﬁcally, through each point in the spacetime
and for each choice of a (local) velocity, the geometry determines a unique path. This
path, which is called a geodesic, is the free-fall path that a body with the prescribed
initial velocity passing through the prescribed point will follow, regardless of its mass
or composition. In this way, the use of curved spacetimes allows general relativity
to incorporate the Equivalence Principle in an essential way.
It is important to note that the geometry we are discussing here characterizes the
spacetime as a uniﬁed entity, not just the space as something separate from time.
One of the important innovations of special relativity is the uniﬁcation of space and
time into spacetime. Doing this allows one to recognize the physical equivalence of
diﬀerent frames of reference related by the motion of one of the frames relative to
the other. It also provides a very useful way of visualizing such things as how dif-
ferent observers perceive the simultaneity of spatially-separated events in diﬀerent
ways. The combination of three-dimensional space and time into four-dimensional
spacetime is a key feature of general relativity as well as special relativity. Indeed,
spacetimes with speciﬁed curved geometries (with their corresponding arrays of geo-
desic paths) are the fundamental objects which are studied in general relativity, and
are used to model gravitational physics.

What determines the curvature of a spacetime used to model the universe (or por-
tions of it), according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity? It is often stated that
while the spacetime curvature determines how matter moves, the matter determines
how the spacetime curves. This is only partially true. The key to understanding this
is the Einstein gravitational ﬁeld equation, which takes the form G𝜇𝜈= 𝜅T𝜇𝜈. The
object on the left hand side of this equation represents the spacetime curvature at
any given point in spacetime (it is known as the Einstein curvature tensor ﬁeld). The
important thing to note about G𝜇𝜈is that it controls only a portion of the spacetime
curvature—roughly half of it at each point in the spacetime. Even if the Einstein
tensor is zero everywhere, the spacetime can be very curved. As for what appears
on the right hand side of this equation, besides the constant factor 𝜅(which depends
on the speed of the light and the universal gravitational constant from Newton’s the-
ory) one has the stress energy tensor ﬁeld T𝜇𝜈. This object represents the localized
mass density and momentum density and angular momentum density of matter and
non-gravitational ﬁelds (including, e.g., the electromagnetic ﬁeld) at each point in
the spacetime. So, while the matter and the ﬁelds and the curvature in a general
relativistic spacetime must satisfy Einstein’s equation G𝜇𝜈= 𝜅T𝜇𝜈, this relation by
no means implies that matter determines curvature. If it did, then general relativ-
ity would predict that gravitational radiation does not exist; this of course would be
inconsistent with the recent LIGO observations of gravitational waves.
24.3
General Relativity and the Modeling of Our Universe
General relativity is used to model gravitational eﬀects at three very diﬀerent scales:
(a) Near-earth phenomena, such as the gravitational eﬀects of the earth on GPS sig-
nals; (b) astrophysical events, such as the collision of a pair of black holes; and (c)
cosmological features, such as the production of the cosmic microwave background
by the Big Bang. There is an important conceptual diﬀerence between the modeling
used for cosmological studies as opposed to that used for near-earth and astrophysical
phenomena. Regarding the latter two cases, there is a very wide variety of diﬀerent
physical systems of interest which are expected to exist somewhere in the universe,
and one studies a particular one by ﬁnding a spacetime solution of the Einstein equa-
tions which corresponds to that system. Note that such a spacetime solution is not
expected to describe the entire universe; it is designed to model a local (relatively
isolated) physical system in a very small portion of the universe. Each such spacetime
solution may well be physically relevant, describing physical phenomena in widely
separated portions of our universe.
In contrast, in modeling cosmological phenomena using general relativity, one
works with solutions of Einstein’s equations which are supposed to represent the
entire universe. Since we live in just one universe,1 in principle only one spacetime
1In this essay, we ignore the possibility that we live in a “multiverse”, with regions that will never
be observable.

304
J. Isenberg
solution is needed for cosmology, and only one is completely accurate. The catch is,
we don’t know enough about our universe to narrow down which spacetime solution
to use for cosmological modeling. Consequently, in doing cosmology, we are led to
consider many solutions, hoping that such a wide-ranging study can be useful for
learning about the cosmology of our particular unique universe.
To illustrate the diﬀerence between these two types of modeling, it is useful to
discuss an example of each kind: (i) modeling the gravitational radiation produced
by the collision of two black holes, and (ii) modeling the universe immediately after
the Big Bang.
One of the most exciting developments in physics in the 21st Century thus far is
the direct detection of gravitational radiation for the very ﬁrst time, by LIGO (the
Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory, located both in Washington state
and in Louisiana) [1]. Gravitational radiation is eﬀectively ripples in the curvature in
the spacetime, generated primarily by accelerating concentrations of matter. Though
ubiquitous, such radiation is generally extremely weak, and consequently very dif-
ﬁcult to detect. To enable it to be detected, as well as to be interpreted, it is crucial
to be able to accurately model the gravitational radiation which is expected to be
produced by very strong sources such as a pair of colliding black holes. Based on
its remarkable success in modeling other gravitational eﬀects such as the observed
changes in the light signals emitted from the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar [2], general
relativity is used to carry out this modeling.
Conceptually, the modeling of the collision of a pair of two black holes is sim-
ple: First, one chooses the distinguishing parameters of the collision: the masses
and the spins of each of the black holes, their initial separation and initial relative
velocity, and the relative directions of the spins and velocities. This choice picks out
the one particular black-hole collision of interest. Next, in accord with the choice of
these parameters, one designates the initial data for the collision. This consists of
the snapshot initial geometry and the initial rate of change of the geometry. Besides
matching the choice of the parameters of the particular collision being modeled, the
designation of the initial data must also satisfy a set of initial-data-constraint equa-
tions; corresponding to four of the ten Einstein gravitational ﬁeld equations, these
are analogous to the Maxwell constraint equations ∇⋅B = 0 and ∇⋅E = 4𝜋𝜌charge
which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds must satisfy. After the designation of the initial
data is made, one uses the remaining six of the Einstein gravitational ﬁeld equations
to evolve the geometry into a spacetime which satisﬁes the full system G𝜇𝜈= 𝜅T𝜇𝜈
everywhere. From this spacetime, with a bit of straightforward work, one deduces
such things as how long it takes for the black holes to collide and merge, how much
gravitational radiation is emitted, and what the particular proﬁle of the emitted radi-
ation is.
As noted above, modeling black-hole collisions in the way just described is crucial
to the success of LIGO in detecting and in analyzing gravitational radiation. While
it took well over thirty years to work out the details of how to carry out this sort
of modeling numerically, the process is now to a large extent routine.2 It provides
2Routine, but very time consuming: Numerical runs can take hundreds of hours.

a wonderful example of the role that solutions of Einstein’s equations can play in
astrophysics.
At the time of this writing, Only two black hole collisions have been detected
(and conﬁrmed) by LIGO. One expects, however, that many more such collisions
will soon be detected. Consequently it is very likely that spacetime solutions of Ein-
stein’s equations corresponding to the full range of the parameter space of black-hole
collisions will each be useful in astrophysical modeling.
The use of general relativity to construct models of the full cosmos is very diﬀer-
ent from its use in modeling astrophysical events like black hole collisions. We live
in a unique universe, so in principle just one solution of Einstein’s equations is useful
for modeling it in detail. However, as noted above, since we know so little about the
full cosmos, we can not hope to know which is the speciﬁc spacetime solution which
most accurately models our universe. Consequently we are led to construct a wide
variety of solutions, not knowing which may be useful and which are not.
For example, say we wish to consider the question of how it is that the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation [3], which is believed to be a relic of the
Big Bang over thirteen billion years ago, is observed to be very nearly the same in
all directions, yet not exactly the same in all directions (i.e., nearly isotropic, but not
exactly isotropic). One way to explore this question is to consider all spacetime solu-
tions which evolve from a Big Bang and are broadly consistent with other features
of the universe such as its age and apparent matter content, and then try to show that
some large portion of these solutions produce nearly isotropic CMB radiation. It is
of course impossible to construct all such solutions, even through numerical simula-
tions, One can, however, focus on a subset of them—characterized, for example, by
some symmetry—and examine the generic behavior of solutions in this subset. This
approach played an important role in convincing many that Einstein’s ﬁeld equations
with standard matter ﬁelds are not enough to model our universe. Rather, it appears
that some mechanism for producing inﬂation in such models is likely needed [4].
It is important to note that there are many spacetime solutions of the Einstein
equations which are clearly not expected to be of any direct use for modeling our
universe and the gravitational phenomena which may occur in it. For example, cos-
mological solutions which are static, or which go from a big bang to a big crunch in a
very short time, are useless for modeling. This feature distinguishes general relativ-
ity from other classical ﬁeld theories such as Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism.
In the case of Maxwell’s theory, one can plausibly argue that essentially any solu-
tion might serve to model electromagnetic phenomena somewhere in the universe.
Indeed, if one focuses on solutions of Einstein’s equations which are designed to
model localized astrophysical events, then the same argument for the potential use-
fulness of all such solutions might be made. The feature of general relativity that
leads to clear disqualiﬁcation of some solutions is its service for modeling the entire
cosmos, and not just localized phenomena.

24.4
Causality, Determinism, and Solutions
of Einstein’s Equations
Deeply ingrained in our concept of how science—at least, physics—works is the idea
of the deterministic experiment: One speciﬁes the initial state of the system—say,
the initial position and velocity of a ball near the surface of the earth—and then the
system is compelled by the “laws of physics” to evolve in a unique, prescribed way.
For example, for the ball near the surface of the earth, Newton’s theory prescribes the
acceleration of the ball, and hence (with the initial position and velocity speciﬁed)
it determines a unique subsequent path for the ball.3
While there is nothing that tells us that physics has to work this way, it is a mea-
sure of the success of our science that we have been able to ﬁnd theories which—
at least within the realm of physical phenomena for which quantum theory is not
needed—tell us exactly what “initial data” it is suﬃcient for us to know for a given
system so that we can use the theory to calculate the future evolution of that system
accurately. Notably, this works perfectly for electromagnetic phenomena as modeled
by Maxwell’s theory in the context of special relativity: Presuming that there is no
charged matter around,4 if we choose a global inertial frame5 and if we know the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds everywhere in space at a given moment of time (relative
to this chosen frame), then Maxwell’s equations determine these ﬁelds everywhere
to the future as well as to the past.
If, instead of wanting to determine the electromagnetic ﬁelds everywhere for all
time, we only seek to determine those ﬁelds at some particular point in space6 x
and at some particular time T in the future, do we need to know what the ﬁelds
are now everywhere in space? Presuming for the moment that we are considering
this problem in the ﬂat spacetime of special relativity (known as the “Minkowski
spacetime”), then in fact we only need to know the values of the ﬁelds “now” (which
we label as time t = 0) in a particular region. This region, which we label [x,−T],
consists of all those points y such that a light ray or a material object might travel
from y at time t = 0 to x at time t = T (a path in spacetime which might in principle
be traversed by either a light ray or by a material object going slower than the speed
of light is called a causal path). The values of the ﬁelds at time t = 0 (now) which are
outside [x,−T] are completely irrelevant to determining the ﬁelds at (x, T), because
no signal from this outside region can travel fast enough (faster than the speed of
light) to get to the point x at time T.
Correspondingly, still restricting ourselves to the physics of special relativity, we
see that if we choose a region in space Σ at a time t = 0, then there is a collection of
spacetime points (z, t) to the future of (Σ, t = 0) such that every causal path which
3Einstein’s theory prescribes essentially the same path.
4The presence of charges does not change this, so long as a theory modeling the behavior of charges
is prescribed along with Maxwell’s theory.
5Special relativity allows this.

of coordinates, one needs three letters to label such points.

hits one of the points (z, t) must pass through (Σ, t = 0), and also such that no causal
path which hits these points (z, t) may pass through any points outside of (Σ, t = 0)
at time t = 0. This collection of points is called the future domain of dependence7 of
Σ, and is labeled +(Σt=0). It follows from special relativity and Maxwell’s theory
that the electromagnetic ﬁelds in +(Σt=0) are completely determined by the initial
data of the ﬁelds on (Σ, t = 0).
The ability to determine the future evolution of physical systems from initial data,
and in particular the ability to do this in a localized way as described above via such
constructs as [x,−T] and +(Σt), is a key feature of special relativity. The language
used to aﬃrm this feature is that Minkowski spacetime is globally hyperbolic and
does not violate causality.
Does this same sort of thing work with physical phenomena for which general
relativity is needed? One of the fascinating features of general relativity is that for
certain classes of spacetime solutions it does, while for others it does not.
It is easy to see that there are spacetimes which satisfy Einstein’s equations of
general relativity, yet fail to be globally hyperbolic. To construct an example (which
we label “identiﬁed-Minkowski spacetime”), we take the standard ﬂat Minkowski
spacetime with a standard set of coordinates (x, t), we throw out all of the spacetime
with t > 1 or with t < 0, and then for each choice of the spatial coordinates (x),
we identify the spacetime points (x, 0) and (x, 1). Since the curvature is zero every-
where and since there is no matter around anywhere, the equations G𝜇𝜈= T𝜇𝜈= 0
are certainly satisﬁed everywhere. Furthermore, despite the somewhat bizarre iden-
tiﬁcation of spacetime points which has been made in constructing this spacetime
solution, it does not violate any explicit rules for general relativity. Yet, with a bit
of thought we see that if we choose a point, say (x, 3∕4), in the spacetime and then
seek to identify the region [x,−1∕2] as a subset of the spacetime with t = 1∕4, we are
forced to include all spatial points at that value of t. This is true because for any point
(y, 1∕4), there is a causal path in this bizarre spacetime which connects (y, 1∕4) and
(x, 3∕4) (it may have to pass through the t = 0 ↔t = 1 identiﬁcation several times).
Similar considerations show that for any choice of a spatial region Σ at any time t0,
the domain of dependence +(Σt0) in this spacetime is empty. It follows from these
strange features that deterministic experiments do not make sense in this spacetime,
since there are no sets of initial conditions for the electromagnetic ﬁeld (or for any
other ﬁeld) in some region Σ at some time t0 which determine the behavior of that
ﬁeld anywhere into the future. We also see that this spacetime contains causal paths
which close on themselves; hence the notions of “future” and “past” lose their mean-
ing in this spacetime.
To avoid determinism and causality problems of the sort just described, one might
require that spacetime solutions of Einstein’s equations have the topology of ℝ4.
One of the exciting features of general relativity from its very beginnings [5], how-
ever, has been its opening up of the possibility of working with spacetimes with
topologies more general than ℝ4. Indeed, until fairly recently, many cosmologists
believed that the most useful spacetimes for modeling our universe were likely to

be spatially closed, with a spacetime topology of the form S3 × ℝ(where S3 is the
three-dimensional sphere).
To allow spacetimes with interesting topology, while disallowing fairly contrived
spacetimes such as identiﬁed-Minkowski, one might decide to include in the stipula-
tions of the theory of general relativity the requirement that the spacetime topology
be Ξ × ℝ, where Ξ could be any three-dimensional manifold.8 One might then ask
if this restriction to the theory prevents not just identiﬁed-Minkowski spacetime,
but also throws out every spacetime solution with causality and global hyperbolicity
problems.
In fact it does not. To illustrate this, we discuss two very diﬀerent archetypal
examples here: the Taub-NUT spacetime and the Gödel spacetime. The Taub-NUT
spacetime [6] which has the topology S3 × ℝ, is a solution of the Einstein equations
with no matter present. It contains a spacetime region (the “Taub region”) in which
the spacetime is fully deterministic: Within the Taub region, the spacetime has no
closed (or almost closed) causal paths and therefore does not violate causality. As
well, in the Taub region, domains of dependence can be localized as in special rel-
ativity, and since the Taub region lies inside the union of the future and the past
domains of dependence of any S3 hypersurface labeled with a ﬁxed choice of Taub-
NUT time, the gravitational ﬁeld of the Taub region is determined by gravitational
initial data on such a hypersurface. The same would hold for other ﬁelds (such as
electromagnetic ﬁelds) on a Taub-NUT spacetime background. The Taub region is
thus labeled as “globally hyperbolic”.
The Taub region is bounded by a particular S3 hypersurface (called a “Cauchy
horizon”); passing beyond it into the NUT region, one ﬁnds that causality, global
hyperbolically, and determinism all break down. There are closed causal paths,
domains of dependence become empty, and the evolution of ﬁelds is not determined
by speciﬁed sets of initial data. Indeed there are multiple possible NUT regions which
can be smoothly attached (as solutions) to the Taub region, thus constituting multiple
possible “futures” of the Taub region.
By contrast with the Taub-NUT spacetime, the Gödel spacetime [7] has no region
in which it is causal or globally hyperbolic or deterministic in any sense. A solution
of the Einstein equations with “dust”-type matter (with non-vanishing vorticity) and
with a cosmological constant, the Gödel spacetime is topologically simple: ℝ4. How-
ever, through every one of its points, there are many closed causal paths. Past and
future make little sense, and deterministic experiments cannot be carried out in a
Gödel spacetime.
Are the Gödel and Taub-NUT spacetimes anomalous examples, which should
best be hidden in the closet and ignored? While it is not at all clear if the Gödel
spacetime in any sense exempliﬁes a class of solutions with similar properties, in
fact there is a wide class of solutions with properties very similar to the Taub-NUT
solution [8]. Notably, these “generalized Taub-NUT solutions” are considerably less
specialized than the Taub-NUT spacetime itself, since they are much less symmet-

is an example.

ric.9 There is an inﬁnite dimensional family of them, each one containing a globally
hyperbolic region in which determinism holds, and each one extendible (in multiple
ways) across a Cauchy horizon into a non globally hyperbolic region with closed
causal paths.
Back in the 1960s, after he and Stephen Hawking had proven their celebrated
spacetime incompleteness theorems, Penrose [9] proposed a pair of conjectures
which have become known as Weak Cosmic Censorship (WCC) and Strong Cos-
mic Censorship (SCC). The spacetime incompleteness theorems, often called “sin-
gularity theorems”, show that if a spacetime solution satisﬁes a fairly general set of
hypotheses, then it necessarily contains causal paths which are forced to stop within
a ﬁnite period of (local) time.10 The reason such paths are forced to stop could be
because the spacetime contains a region in which the curvature blows up; the pres-
ence of a Cauchy horizon could cause this as well. Penrose’s Strong Cosmic Censor-
ship conjecture proposes that in almost all such cases, it is curvature blowup rather
the presence of a Cauchy horizon which causes the demise of causal paths.11
If Strong Cosmic Censorship is true, then spacetimes (such as the generalized
Taub-NUT) which contain Cauchy horizons (and the other attendant diﬃculties with
determinism) are a very small subset of the collection of all solutions of Einstein’s
equations. Is SCC in fact true?
Although Strong Cosmic Censorship has often over the past ﬁfty years been cited
as one of the major questions in the mathematical study of general relativity, it is far
from clear whether SCC is true or not. Model versions of the conjecture have been
proven in small families of solutions [10]; there are also recent results which suggest
that SCC is not likely to hold in its strongest form. The verity of the conjecture
remains a wide open question.
24.5
Conclusion
We know two important things about general relativity: (1) Observation and exper-
iment have shown that it is extremely eﬀective for modeling gravitational physics,
from the scale of the solar system to the scale of astrophysical phenomena. (2) It
includes among its spacetime solutions a number of them in which causality and
determinism break down, at least in certain regions.
9The Taub-NUT spacetime is invariant under the action of a three-dimensional isometric group,
while there are known generalized Taub-NUT solutions with only a one dimensional isometric
group.
10A spacetime containing such paths is called “geodesically incomplete”.
11Weak Cosmic Censorship is essentially unrelated to Strong Cosmic Censorship. WCC conjectures
that in essentially all astrophysical-type spacetime solutions which contain unbounded curvature,
distant observers cannot see signals from the region in which this occurs; that is, such regions must
be contained inside black holes.

J. Isenberg
Based on these two facts, one might be led to believe one of the following asser-
tions:
(A) We should expect to ﬁnd causality violations and the failure of determinism
somewhere in our universe.
(B) Since we have not detected any breakdown of causality or determinism in our
universe, and since they are so fundamental to our way of doing science, general
relativity must be seriously ﬂawed as a physical theory to be used for modeling our
universe.
(C) While general relativity includes among its array of solutions some in which
causality and determinism fail, these solutions are irrelevant for modeling physics,
and can be more or less ignored.
All three of these statements are consistent with what we know about general
relativity. Which of them makes the most sense scientiﬁcally?
Since we know already that there are many solutions of Einstein’s equations which
are of no use for modeling physics (see Sect. 24.3), and since we in fact live in just
one universe, it is hard to support statement B. Whether or not one chooses to invoke
a selection principle (e.g., restrictions on topology, restriction to globally hyperbolic
solutions, etc.) to determine which spacetime solutions might be used for modeling
physics, it is straightforward to focus on certain solutions and ignore others in car-
rying out modeling. That this must be done in using general relativity does not, I
believe, harm the usefulness of the theory. One might argue that this makes it more
diﬃcult to believe that Einstein’s theory is right. However, we already know that Ein-
stein’s theory cannot be used to model systems in which quantum ideas are needed,
so this argument is a red herring. As well, it is very likely that no theory that we
know now (or will ever know?) will prove to be right in the sense that it explains and
models phenomena at all scales.
Regarding statement A, it of course makes sense on a grand scientiﬁc scale to
search for situations (as “predicted” by solutions of Einstein’s equations) in which
phenomena corresponding to the breakdown of causality and determinism might be
detected. The predictive solutions could be used as a guide to ﬁnding such phenom-
ena. On the other hand, one might argue that while it would be fascinating to ﬁnd
such phenomena, they are likely to be very diﬃcult to ﬁnd; hence such searches
should be of very low priority.
Statement C is likely the most practical scientiﬁc position to take. A wide range
of spacetime solutions of Einstein’s equations are extremely eﬀective for modeling
and predicting gravitational physics. The existence of other, fairly strange, solutions
is interesting, but perhaps irrelevant scientiﬁcally.
Perhaps; we shall see.

Topos Theoretic Approach to Space and Time
Goro C. Kato
Abstract At the level of the Planck scale (around 10−33 cm) and beyond, i.e., a sub-
Planckian domain (less than 10−43 s after so called big bang), the usual concept of
space and time becomes uncertain where the gravitational ﬁeld might be simply a
quantum ﬂuctuation of a vacuum. Elementary particles or strings, the fundamental
entities for our universe, are diﬃcult to be considered at such a microcosm level.
An emergence occurs when a physical phenomenon is the consequence of organi-
zation from the given local information data. Namely, we cannot tell any diﬀerence
between electrons in a human brain and in an apple. This is just as we cannot tell any
diﬀerence between a note in a piece by Mozart and a note in a piece by Bach. We use
the concept of a sheaf as the device from local to global transition. In order to for-
mulate space and time for those microcosm domains in terms of sheaves providing a
background free notion in the sense of quantum gravity, the notions of the associated
(pre)sheaves of time, space, and matter are introduced in the following sense. For a
particle m, we assign an associated presheaf m with m. A presheaf is by deﬁnition a
contravariant functor from a site (i.e., a category with a Grothendieck topology) to
a product category. This is the notion of the temporal topos theory abbreviated as t-
topos theory developed in [1–5]. For space and time, we associate a combined sheaf
𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) where space sheaf 𝜅and time sheaf 𝜏are considered to be t-entangled in
the sense that both sheaves behave as one sheaf. With the notions of sheaves and cat-
egories, we will give the formulations for the uncertainty principle, particle-wave
duality, and t-entanglement together with the relativistic concept of a t-light cone
(or an ur-light cone) valid in macrocosm and microcosm. As a consequence of the
topos theoretic formulations, the possible scenario of pre and primitive stages of a
universe, i.e., ur-big bangs in terms of t-topos theory will be provided. The main
concepts to formulate these notions are coming from categorical notions of a micro-
decomposition of a presheaf and a micro-covering of a t-site object.

Introduction
Our goal is to study and formulate space, time, and matter in terms of the notions of
categories and sheaves. Hopefully, our attempt to place all the known phenomena of
the macrocosm and microcosm universe within a topos theoretic structural frame-
work will deepen our understanding of space and time. We will focus particularly on
the situation when gravitational ﬁelds are extremely strong and also on the situation
where distance scales are extremely short. How to capture the nature of space and
time is an old problem ﬁrst for philosophers and later for scientists equipped with
suﬃcient mathematics.
During the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries, human beings have made huge
progress in cosmology. Even though we cannot answer such questions as why the
creation of a universe happened and what caused the creation at a particular moment,
we can try to answer how, i.e., in what way such a creation happened. However, for
modern science, it is not enough to just argue about the nature of space and time.
It is necessary for one to give explicit formulations without ambiguity so that peo-
ple with critical minds can point out the ﬂaws in the formulations if they exist. This
level of explicitness is a requirement for twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst century science.
During the last ﬁve hundred years, mathematics has been the device to satisfy the
requirement of explicitness and exactness for formulating theories. Especially from
the early twentieth century, macrocosm and microcosm have been studied and for-
mulated in terms of diﬀerential geometry for a general theory of relativity, and in
terms of functional analysis, in particular Hilbert space and group theory for quan-
tum physics. However accurate those main pillars, relativity theory and quantum
physics of modern sciences might be in macrocosm and microcosm, respectively,
we still live in this undivided world consisting of macro and micro worlds. A new
question appears whether there exists a valid formulation both in macrocosm and
microcosm. Namely, we seek one theory that gives formulations about space and
time of the universe and microscopic world. Meanwhile in modern mathematics of
post WW II, new theories developed in pure mathematics have become available in
the studies of topology and complex analysis in several complex variables. These
new notions are category theory and sheaf theory. For physical applications, we list
the following: the works of Isham and Butterﬁeld on Kochen-Specker Theorem and
consistent histories [6, 7], the works of Mallios, Raptis, and Zaﬁris on Lorentzian
quantum gravity as applications of abstract diﬀerential geometry [8, 9], the works
of Guts and Grinkevich on the topos theoretic general relativity [10], and the work
of the current author on temporal topos. See Bibliography in [8] for further papers
on topos and categorical approaches in quantum gravity research.
The concepts in categories and sheaves will be used as unifying methods to for-
mulate the physical space and time of macrocosm and microcosm in this paper. On
the other hand, another aspect of our universe is the concept of consciousness. One
may say it is a matter of self-awareness. The question is how a collection of elemen-
tary particles, or strings, become organized enough to form a human being or a brain.
The organization and emergence can be captured as a process from local entities to

global entities. The notion of a sheaf provides the global (conscious) entities. But
we will focus on the physical aspects of a sheaf theory in this paper. In what follows
we give our sheaf theoretic approach called the temporal topos theory, abbreviated
as the theory of t-topos. The ﬁrst postulate in the t-topos theory is that for every
particle, whether it is in the particle state or wave state, there exists a corresponding
presheaf associated with the particle. A presheaf is an assignment like a function
or a mapping. Generally, a presheaf is an assignment from objects in a category to
objects in another category. On the other hand, space and time are associated with
sheaves, which are special presheaves satisfying the so called sheaf condition. One
of the reasons to use sheaves instead of presheaves for space and time is that local
data can be pasted together to obtain a familiar smooth global space and time.

“Things” Are Presheaves; The Category of Presheaves
over a Site
The sets ℝand ℂof real numbers and complex numbers, respectively, have been used
very successfully as foundations for diﬀerentiable functions (and more recently for
diﬀerentiable manifolds) in established (macrocosm) physics since Newton’s time.
I. V. Volovich suggested the p-adic number approach to quantum physics in [11]
instead of ℝand ℂ. Several people during the last century including Albert Einstein
and Richard Feynman were aware of the necessity of the introduction of algebraic
methods to deal with the discrete nature of the quantum microcosm. Namely, space
and time seem to be discrete objects in the microcosm near the Planck scale.
Fundamental questions like, “What is the most fundamental entity in the uni-
verse?” and “What is space and what is time?” are the main issues. Philosophers and
scientists over the last two or even three thousand years have given their thoughts at
the levels of available scientiﬁc knowledge.
“We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created
them.” (Einstein)
As mathematical advances have been made throughout history, the languages
used for describing physical phenomena were calculus and diﬀerential equations,
and in the twentieth century, functional analysis, group theory, diﬀerential geome-
try, and near the end of twentieth century, algebraic geometry and algebraic analysis.
As W.W.II ended, a new theory appeared in the area of pure mathematics called cate-
gory theory developed by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane. Another theory
which plays a signiﬁcant role in our theory is the concept of a sheaf. It ﬁrst appeared
in algebraic topology in the work of Jean Leray and also in function theory in several
complex variables in the work of Kiyoshi Oka. However, in algebraic geometry, it
was Alexander Grothendieck who pushed the notion of sheaves to the ultimate level
of simplicity and purity.
Before discussing space and time, we will address matter since space, time, and
matter play roles in this universal treatment. We have a big question: “What is real-

316
G.C. Kato
ity?” It is our belief that reality cannot be described either by waves or particles
as is done in the quantum world, but rather reality should be described in terms of
presheaves over a site. Namely, there is a t-topos behind reality. Let us focus on par-
ticles, e.g. electrons and photons. For such a question as “What are things?” some
people would answer that basic entities should be strings. Pythagoras (572–492 B.C.)
said that things consist of numbers. Our answer would be, “Things are presheaves.”
The notion of a presheaf gives the wave-particle duality of e.g., an electron, which
depends upon the presheaf being reiﬁed or not on an object of a t-site. The deﬁni-
tions of a presheaf and “being reiﬁed” will be given in what follows. The concept of
a presheaf is coming from category theory. A category consists of objects and mor-
phisms satisfying certain conditions. As an example of a category, let us consider
the collection of sets. In the category (Sets) of sets, objects in (Sets) are sets and
morphisms in (Sets) are set-theoretic mappings (functions) from a set to a set. Our
fundamental device is coming from the notion of the category ̃S of sheaves over a
certain site. A general site is a category with a Grothendieck topology, a vast gener-
alization of the notion of a topological space, e.g., a Euclidean space. This category
̃S of sheaves is said to be a topos over a site S. For the deﬁnitions of a site and a
Grothendieck topology, see [12–14].
However, as is often the case of an application of pure mathematics to physics, the
theory of toposes cannot be used without additional conditions. Our t-topos theory
is no exception. We ﬁrst deﬁne a notion of a presheaf over a site or a category S. A
presheaf m is a contravariant functor from S to a category K. We ﬁrst need to explain
what a functor is. A functor m from S to K is an assignment; for an object V in S,
there is the assigned object m(V) in K. This assignment must satisfy the following.
For a morphism V
𝛼
⟶U, there is induced the morphism by m in K as
m(V)
m(𝛼)
⟵m(U).
Notice that the direction of the morphism V
𝛼
⟶U is reversed in K to m(V)
m(𝛼)
⟵
m(U). Let t be the usual time corresponding to 𝜏(V), and e.g., 1 s later t + 1 cor-
responds to 𝜏(U). Then the above V
𝛼
⟶U is said to be a linearly t-ordered mor-
phism, or simply a t-linear morphism. In t-topos theory, we consider non-t-linear
morphisms of t-site, especially for the situations suﬃciently close to a creation of a
universe and a black hole. Namely, there is no concept of “before and after” in the
usual time sense. The concept of a t-light cone will be deﬁned later. When V
𝛼
⟶U
is non-t-linear, m(V) and m(U) are not mutually in t-light cones. That is, m(U) is
outside the light cone of m(V) in the usual sense. The change of direction from right
to left of the induced morphism m(𝛼) by a functor from the original direction of 𝛼,
from left to right in the above, is the contravariantness. Note that for the sake of
consistency only, one can deﬁne that a morphism from V to U does not exist for
a non-t-linear situation; a morphism exists only for a t-linear morphism. A general
presheaf, i.e., a contravariant functor, is deﬁned for any object of a site V; however,
ﬁrst an additional condition for our theory postulates that a presheaf m is only deﬁned

25
Topos Theoretic Approach to Space and Time
317
for certain objects of the site. Such a restricted category of presheaves over a tempo-
ral site S is said to be a temporal topos. We denote the category as ̂S. As mentioned
already, our ﬁrst axiom on the particle associated presheaf m with a particle m is the
following.
Axiom 1 For every particle m, there exists the associated presheaf m in the t-topos
̂S.
Then we also say that m is representing a particle m. Our approach is that all
the physical phenomena, e.g., uncertainty principle, entanglement, etc., should be
formulated in terms of the t-topoŝS and the t-site S, namely in terms of categories and
sheaves. Our theory is an observer-dependent theory in the following sense. When
a particle associated presheaf m is observed (measured) by an observer presheaf P,
we capture the observation (measurement) with the following diagram:
m(U)
SU
V
⟶P(V).
(25.1)
Then the induced morphism SU
V is regarded as a ﬂow of information from the ur-
particle state m(U) of m to the observer in the ur-particle state P(V). We consider
both eﬀects of m and P on e.g., spacetime sheaf 𝜔. For the particle-wave duality, we
introduce the following deﬁnition. A particle associated presheaf m is said to be in
an ur-particle state if there exists an object V in the t-site S so that m(V) is deﬁned.
We also say that the presheaf m is reiﬁed at a t-site object V. An object of the t-
site is also called a generalized time period. For commonly used terminology in this
paper, we refer to [5]. On the other hand, when m is not reiﬁed, i.e., not deﬁned, by
any object of the t-site S, presheaf m is said to be in an ur-wave state. Note that ur-
particle and ur-wave states correspond to the usual particle and wave states. When a
particle is observed (measured), the associated presheaf needs to be in an ur-particle
state. Note that for a reiﬁed presheaf m over V, there does not exist a unique t-linear
morphism from V to another object U at which m is reiﬁed. Namely, t-topos theory
is not deterministic. In a way, the t-topos view is very non-deterministic since for a
reiﬁed object V, there may not exist any morphism at all. In such a case, m will never
again be in an ur-particle state. When there exists a non-t-linear morphism from V
to W, the ur-particle state m(W) is not within the t-light cone with respect to m(V).
Since we deﬁne the sheaf 𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) associated with spacetime as a ﬁnal object
in the t-topos ̂S, for any presheaf m, there exists a unique morphism m
𝜎m
⟶𝜔. This
unique morphism 𝜎m is regarded as the eﬀect of a particle on spacetime. For example,
when spacetime is measured by P over a generalized time period V, we have the
following commutative diagram:
m(W)
W
V 𝜎m
⟶𝜔(V)
↓SV
V′
P(V′)
(25.2)

318
G.C. Kato
The above diagram may be read as follows. By measuring the ur-state of space-
time sheaf 𝜔over V by the observer P over V′, P receives information of the ur-state
of m over W. This formulation, i.e., W, V, V′ and are all diﬀerent, is under consid-
eration when the relativistic situation is non-trivial. Namely, for the case when non-
global consideration is suﬃcient, all the t-site objects W, V, V′ may be the same.
Since 𝜔is a ﬁnal object of the t-topos, there exists a unique morphim 𝜎P ∶P ⟶𝜔
as well.

The diagram (25.3) above is the observer-dependent version of (25.2) in the follow-
ing sense. If P measures the ur-state of spacetime over V, by composing morphisms
from m and P over generalized time periods W and V′′, respectively, P receives infor-
mation over about m and P during the generalized time periods W and V′′. Note that
as for the ur-state of P, V′′ precedes the ur-state over V′ in the above t-linear sense.
Note also that above formulations in (25.2) and (25.3) are in the relativistic form in
the sense that all the states considered are within t-light cones. Here we say that two
ur-particle states m(V) and l(U) of m and l over generalized time periods V and U
are mutually in t-light cones if
1. there exist ﬁnite series of t-linear morphisms
V ⟶V1 ⟶−−−⟶Vi ⟶−−−from V and
U ⟶U1 ⟶−−−⟶Ui ⟶−−−from U, respectively, and
2. there exist i0 and j0 with a t-linear morphism Vi0 ⟶Uj0.
Note that the concept of a t-light cone can be deﬁned in the t-site only. See also
an equivalent deﬁnition of a t-light cone in [5]. As we will explain in Sect. 25.3, the
notion of a micromorphism will show that a t-light cone in microcosm looks like a
discontinuous cone as shown below.

One can formulate the deterministic classical aspect of the universe in terms of
t-topos. Suppose that a particle associated presheaf m is reiﬁed at the generalized
time period V. Then the deterministic view would be that there exists a uniquely
determined t-linear morphism from V to U at which m will be in an ur-particle state

m(U). In t-topos, for such a V, there may not even exist any morphism from V. Even
when there is a morphism from V, the morphism may not be t-linear. The strict
deterministic view would insist that such a t-linear morphism V
≈
⟶U is an isomor-
phism. Namely, knowing the complete information of the state m(V) is equivalent
to knowing the future state m(U) and also its past state, i.e., deterministic. However,
our t-topos view is that the behavior of a particle is fundamentally unpredictable due
to the non-uniqueness of a morphism from V.
Another important notion in the theory of t-topos is that of t-entanglement. For
the t-topos application to a double slit experiment, we refer to [15]. Let p and q be
presheaves representing particles. Then p and q are said to be t-entangled when a
pair (p, q) behaves as one presheaf. That is, when p is in an ur-particle state over a
generalized time period V, then q is reiﬁed over the same V. Namely, we have the
ur-particle state of the pair (p, q)(V) = (p(V), q(V)). For instance, if p is observed
by P over V, then the ur-state of q is determined whether q is observed or not. (Note
that in the relativistic formulation, we need to replace V with V′ for P satisfying
the t-light cone condition as we saw earlier.) This temporal topos simultaneity is
because an observation, i.e., (measurement) p(V)
SV
V
⟶P(V) by P over V forces p to
be in an ur-particle state as in (25.2). Then with the same V, presheaf q is reiﬁed
at V, namely, the state of q over V is determined. Notice also that the notion of t-
entanglement is independent of e.g., the distance between the two particles. Some of
the consequences of our t-entanglement are the following. Let p and q be t-entangled
over V and let V ⟶V′ be a non-t-linear morphism. Then p and q are not in mutually
t-light cones. In spite of that, an ur-particle state of one of the entangled entities can
determine the ur-particle states of all other entangled entities. However, when one
of the entangled entities is in an ur-wave state, one cannot tell whether the entities
are entangled or not since all are in an ur-wave state.
25.3
The Large and the Small
Next we will focus on the microcosm aspect of t-topos theory so that we can dis-
cuss both macro- and micro- aspects of t-topos for space and time during the early
universe. For a morphism V
f
⟶U in the t-site S, we consider a factorization of
V
f
⟶U in the following sense. There exists an object W in the t-site S so that in
the diagram below
V
f0
⟶W
f1
⟶U
or
V
f
⟶
U
↘f0
↙f1

320
G.C. Kato
we have f = f1◦f0. When such a factorization does not exist, V
f
⟶U is said to be a
micromorphism. This concept of a micromorphism is the underlying reason for the
uncertainty principle. For example, let 𝛾be a presheaf associated with a photon and
let V
f
⟶U be a t-linear micromorphism where photon presheaf 𝛾is in ur-particle
states at V and U. Namely we have the following diagram:
𝛾(V)
𝛾f
⟵𝛾(U).
When V
f
⟶U is a micromorphism, by deﬁnition, it is impossible for 𝛾to be in a ur-
particle state, i.e., between the time periods from 𝜏(V) to 𝜏(U), the photon presheaf 𝛾
is always in a ur-wave state. In terms of the position between V and U, positions can
only take place at 𝜅(V) and 𝜅(U). Notice that if V
f
⟶U is not a micromorphism, i.e.,
f can be factored into many micromorphisms, and much more accurate information
about speed can be obtained.
Let m be any presheaf associated with a particle m. Let us assume that m is mea-
sured twice: ﬁrst at V and later at U. Namely, we have a t-linear morphism V
f
⟶U
which induces m(V)
m(f)
⟵m(U) as before. Now we consider a mirofactorization of
V
f
⟶U. Let V
f0
⟶V1
f1
⟶−−−
fn−2
⟶Vn−1
fn−1
⟶U be a microfactorizaiton
of V
f
⟶U. Then the microfactorization number of V
f
⟶U is said to be n.
Macrocosm and microcosm are distinguished by the microfactorization number of
V
f
⟶U. That is, if n is large, V
f
⟶U deﬁnes a macro event. If the microfactor-
ization number n = 1, then V
f
⟶U is a micromorphism.
Next we will introduce the dynamical aspect of t-topos theory. Quantum mechan-
ics is ﬂawless in microcosm even though it ignores the gravitational eﬀect, and gen-
eral relativity is practically ﬂawless in macrocosm. At the beginning of the universe
when the universe was a microcosm, gravity was not to be ignored. What we need is
the notion of the universal gravitational eﬀect in macrocosm and microcosm. For a
given linearly t-ordered morphism V
f
⟶U, let n be the microfactorization number
without the gravity eﬀect. Then the t. g. hypothesis (t-topos theoretic gravitational
hypothesis) says:
the microfactorization number n decreases under a stronger gravitational eﬀect.
This inequality can be viewed as a micro-eﬀect in the sense that for any parti-
cle associated presheaf m, m becomes more likely to be in an ur-wave state. The t.
g. hypothesis implies that entropy deceases. See [3, 5] for the notion of t-entropy.
Namely, m behaves more like a microcosm entity under a stronger gravity. We will
return to this topic. This g. t. hypothesis allows us to describe possible scenarios for
the creation of a universe.
Before we go to the topics of space and time of ultra-early (and possible pre-)
universes and back holes, let us focus on microlocalization of a presheaf in terms of

25
Topos Theoretic Approach to Space and Time
321
the notion of a decomposition of presheaves into subpresheaves. For a macro particle
associated presheaf M, consider its decomposition into presheaves associated with
particles in a microcosm like elementary particles. In terms of categorical notions,
consider a direct product of (sub-) presheaves of M. I.e.,
M =
∏
k∈K
mk,
(25.4)
where K is a ﬁnite index set. Let
M =
∏
k∈K
mk
pk
⟶mk
be the projection morphism. Notice that when a micro object presheaf mk is measured
over a generalized time period V, by an observer P over U (for non-relativistic con-
sideration one may take V = U), as in (25.1), we have a morphism mk(V)
SV
U
⟶P(U).
Since M need not be deﬁned over V (where mk is reiﬁed at V), we cannot com-
pose these two morphisms as SV
U◦pk(V) in the following: M(V) =
∏
k∈K
mk(V)
pk(V)
⟶
mk(V)
SV
U
⟶P(U). Such an impossibility of the composition of the morphisms from
M(V) to P(U) indicates that local information of M, i.e., mk over V, gives no infor-
mation to the observer P about the global object M.
On the other hand, we can consider a reﬁnement for an object V of a t-site. For a
covering
{
V
gi
⟵Vi
}
i∈I of V, we can further consider a covering
{
Vi
gi,j
⟵Vi,j
}
j∈J
of Vi. We deﬁne a microcovering when such a covering morphism gi,j,…,k becomes
an isomorphism after a ﬁnite number of the above processes. See [5] for details.
The main assumption of our theory of temporal topos for our universe is the fol-
lowing:
Temporal Topos Postulate (referred to as t-t-P): the category of presheaves over a t-site exists
independently of time.
The appearance of inﬁnity as a singularity at the very beginning of the universe
is inadequate and unwelcome news for any theory including the big bang model.
Neither density nor temperature is ﬁnite, i.e., the value ∞at the singularity. As one
of the motivations to get rid of meaningless inﬁnity from physical theories, topos-
categorical approaches have been proposed. This theory of t-topos is no exception.
Space and time exist as sheaves even when they are not reiﬁed. A big bang hypothesis
as a cosmic singularity would be a beginning of reiﬁed space, time, and matter. In t-t-
P, the word “existence” is used in the non-physical context, i.e., in the mathematical
context. Namely, “existence” in t-t-P is used without referring to time and location
(i.e., when and where). Nothing is observable until a presheaf is reiﬁed, including
space and time sheaves 𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏). Namely, before any object of the t-topos (includ-
ing space and time) has potential to be measured, temporal topos exists in the above
sense.

322
G.C. Kato
“Before” the beginning of our universe, all the presheaves are (were) non-reiﬁed,
where “before” is deﬁned as “not a single reiﬁed exists.” Namely, this ‘before’ is in
the sense of t-topos, which one may call “Temporal topos theoretic ‘before’ based
on t-t-P.”
The next state would be the case where some presheaves are reiﬁed. Let m be one
of the reiﬁed presheaves over a t-site object V. Several possibilities may be consid-
ered following this state.
Case 1: the presheaf m may never be reiﬁed again. This case will not develop into
any universe.
Case 2: m is reiﬁed at U besides V. Then we can consider two following cases.
Subcase 2.1: V ⟶U is a non-t-linear morphism. In this case, m(V) and m(U) can-
not be in the same universe. Or at least they cannot be mutually in t-light cones.
Since there did not yet exist a measurable universe, this type of ﬂuctuation can pro-
vide multiple universes. Subcase 2.2: V ⟶U is a t-linear morphism. This second
subcase has potential to lead to a genuine universe provided that series of t-linear
morphisms will continue to this day. We do not know what determined the right
dimensions and just right forces for our universe we live in to have evolved as it has.
Particularly, as for space and time 𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) as a ﬁnal object of temporal topos
̂S, we do not know how to postulate:
1. when space and time 𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) turned from a presheaf to a sheaf, or
2. whether space and time are sheaves all the time, and
3. when space and time became t-entangled
so that we can still have consistent and rich enough axiomatic structures in the t-
topos theory. For a presheaf m, there is a unique morphism m
𝜎m
⟶𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) since
the spacetime sheaf 𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) is a ﬁnal object of t-topos ̂S. During those above cases
(corresponding to ultra early stages of the universe), even if m and 𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) are
reiﬁed at objects X and Y of the t-site S, the induced morphism m(X)
(𝜎m)X
Y
⟶𝜔(Y) need
not be t-linear. When spacetime sheaf 𝜔= (𝜅, 𝜏) is to be aﬀected by the reiﬁed ur-
particle state of m(X), the morphism X ⟶Y must be t-linear, i.e., m(X)
(𝜎m)X
Y
⟶𝜔(Y)
needs to be in mutually in t-light cones.
In the formulation of the temporal topos, for such a question as where did space,
time, and matter come from, our answer would be: they came from the (un-reiﬁed)
t-topos ̂S.
25.4
Epilogue
What is an adequate deﬁnition of time after all? Our deﬁnition of time is a sheaf as an
object of t-topos. Our t.t.p. says that space and time associated sheaves always exist
independently of time: maybe not reiﬁed before in the sense of t-topos as described
in the above at the beginning of our universe. We know that space and time are very

Topos Theoretic Approach to Space and Time
323
diﬀerent entities. We can move from one place A at time t to another place B at time
s, and then we can come back from B at time t′ to A at time s′ again. But we cannot
return to the previous time, even though during the ultra early universe, as we saw
in the above via t-topos, the linearity of time is not guaranteed. When time loses
the linearly t-orderedness, a beginning of time becomes ambiguous. A before-after
based big bang singularity relying upon the completeness of the set of real num-
bers has a diﬀerent meaning. Before creation, time sheaf was (is) not reiﬁed. Conse-
quently, there is no reiﬁed time 𝜏(V) to be measured. Just as an image, our beginning
of space and time is similar to the scenario proposed by Alexander Vilenkin, i.e.,
the creation of our universe occurred as a process of quantum tunneling of nothing
in [16]. Namely, our universe may have come out of a quantum vacuum. Our the-
ory may be phrased as follows. Our universe occurred as a process of reiﬁcation of
topos of presheaves. By interpreting “Nothing” as un-reiﬁed presheaves (hence non-
measurable in a t-topos sense), including spacetime sheaf 𝜔, a phrase like a universe
is created from “nothing” is a consequence of our method as well. Ultra locally, our
universe looks like a ﬂuctuating collection of reiﬁed and un-reiﬁed presheaves asso-
ciated with elementary particles and spacetime lasting only sub-Planck length time
by keeping the total energy at almost zero.

Introduction
Space, as they say, is everywhere. Since we are visual creatures and visual experi-
ence is spatial, space (with a visual tinge) dominates our world. While visual per-
ception is enormously useful—it’s the only sensory modality that transcends our
earthly existence; no other sense can grasp stars and galaxies—it also prevents us
from understanding the world of other creatures. In a now infamous article,1 Thomas
Nagel asked what it’s like to be a bat, suggesting that nothing we know about the
anatomy or physiology of a bat prepares us to understand the subjective experience
of bats or, for that matter, whether bats have any subjective experience at all.
This paper starts with a question in response to Nagel: is there a form of sub-
jective space that transcends the particularities of vision or audition? More gener-
ally, what is subjective space?
Of course, vision and audition aren’t the only mutually incomprehensible mental
capacities. Most of us have heard a language we don’t understand. Some of us have
been exposed to languages that we don’t even begin to understand—say, a native
English speaker who travels to Namibia and overhears! Kung speakers in con-
versation. Today it’s increasingly clear that the languages of the world have much
in common.2 What if there is a spatial instinct that was much more primeval than a
language instinct? What would such an instinct look like? One possibility, once
again in analogy with the situation in language, is that there’s spatial syntax that
serves as the ground upon which the different sensory modalities encode space.

The topic of spatial syntax is too vast to address in a single paper or even a book.
My goal here is much more limited: to introduce the idea of syntactic space, to
argue that it’s a viable hypothesis for modeling space that transcends sensory
modalities while being rich enough to capture important aspects of the geometry of
experience. This paper has three parts.
In part one, I introduce the idea of syntactic space with an emphasis on heuristics
that might be the target of future formalization. Part two is an outline of three well
known accounts of perception—Gestaltist, Gibsonian and Enactive—that have
theorized space from an observer’s perspective. In my opinion, these three theories
are our richest sources of insights about the geometry of experience within a
scientiﬁc framework. Finally, in part three, I come back to the original question,
“what is subjective space” and speculate on what a synthesis might look like.
26.2
Syntactic Space
I borrow the notion of syntax from the study of language,3 where syntax denotes
grammatical features that have little semantic content. Syntactic constructions are
compatible with a range of semantic content. For example, the construction “(noun)
X did (verb) V to (noun) Y” can be used to express “John kissed Mary” as well as
“Mary greeted Meera” and any number of other sentences.4
What is spatial syntax? Let me introduce the concept with a couple of examples.
Normal visual experience is rich in content. Consider an image like Fig. 26.1.
We easily recognize a city street with people, buses, ﬂowering trees, street signs
and storefronts of international brands. It’s also clear that some people are crossing
the street and others are walking along the sidewalks. Human beings recognize such
scenes effortlessly and make their way through them when compelled to do so. Now
compare that scene with this one (Fig. 26.2).
Figure 26.2 has as many objects as the previous one, but with much less
meaning. While you can’t permute the objects in Fig. 26.1 (just imagine replacing
the people on the sidewalk with buses and ﬁlling the street with people), there’s no
reason why we wouldn’t accept a ﬁeld of rocks with the individual stones switched
around.
At the same time, we would know how to act when faced with a scene as in
Fig. 26.2. We would know how to pick up a small rock that catches our fancy,
avoid a sharp stone while walking over the terrain or throw a ﬂat one into the
neighboring lake to watch it skip. The skeletal information we perceive from
Fig. 26.2 is enough for many purposes. Most scenes have that information, even if
3Chomsky, Noam. Syntactic structures. Walter de Gruyter, 2002.
4The analogy to space ends with our emphasis on spatial constructions that have wide application,
for the formal study of syntax focuses on features such as recursion that will not concern us here.

they don’t have rich content. By spatial syntax, I mean universal spatial properties
that are available in every scene.
These include features such as visual groups (Fig. 26.3a), topological relations
such as containment (Fig. 26.3b) and features that track physicality such as support
(Fig. 26.3c). Some of these properties are more like to be universal than others; for
example, a deep sea ﬁsh or bacteria in a viscous liquid are unlikely to care much
about support, but containment and grouping ought to matter to them. To sum-
marize, spatial syntax consists of clusters of features that occur repeatedly in
organismic environments. In that, they are like a pattern language for life in a
spatial world.5
Is there a complete catalog of these patterns? Can they be deduced from
underlying principles? I think it’s too early to offer a deﬁnite answer. These
properties don’t have an obvious origin—they mix metric properties (grouping)
with topological ones (containment) and when you add physical-functional prop-
erties such as support, you’re mixing physics, geometry and topology in a manner
that doesn’t have much precedent. The closest we have to a theory of these features
is the notion of an image schema6 but that’s a descriptive account rather than an
explanatory one.
If that isn’t enough reason to be cautious, it becomes clear that we are at an early
stage of our investigation when we start probing how spatial syntactic features
come together to form complex layouts. For example, unlike the case of grammar,
there’s no obvious analog of the sentence. What’s a believable layout? What feels
unacceptable? Our answers to these questions are likely to be statistical.7
Another direction of theoretical progress concerns the origins of spatial orga-
nization. Where do these syntactic features come from? The theories addressing this
question have been among the most inﬂuential in the study of the mind, even

inﬂuencing modern technology via design.8 I am going to focus on three accounts
of perception: gestalt, gibsonian and enactive.
26.3
Three Theories of Perception: Gestalt, Direct
and Enactive
There9 are many problems of perceptual organization, but I am going to emphasize
a core question: why do humans (and other creatures) live in a complete and
coherent world?
All of us have heard of the blind spot in the retina. The input to our eyes is
incomplete, yet we don’t walk around with a hole in our visual ﬁeld. More generally,
the stimulus that enters our sensory receptors is limited, noisy and unstable while our
experience is holistic, coherent and stable. What explains that discrepancy?
Why isn’t our experience a blooming buzzing confusion that William James
imputed to babies?10 Mobile creatures have very limited exposure to the environ-
ment; we can take in only so much in a single gaze and every time we move our
head or saccade our eyes, the input changes, sometimes dramatically. Yet, our
perception of the world is stable. Why is that so?
The gestalt psychologists were the ﬁrst to provide a convincing alternative to the
blooming buzzing confusion. In their view, the mind organizes experience
according to its own principles. Consider the image in Fig. 26.4.
Doesn’t it look like a triangle with white borders obscuring a triangle with black
borders? In principle it could be rather different, i.e., a triangle with three pac-man
ﬁgures surrounding it, but we don’t see it that way. In the Gestaltist account, that
because our minds automatically completes the input to form two ﬁgures. That
completion—called amodal completion in the literature11—is a property of the
mind, not of the stimulus. So if we are to capture the gestalt theory of complete
coherent experience in one line, it is:
Experience is complete because our mind imposes structure upon the incoming
stimulus. Completeness is a property of the mind.
The perceptual scientist J.J. Gibson was greatly inﬂuenced by the gestaltists, but
he ended up with the exact opposite conclusion, that completeness is a property of
the world. How did he come to that conclusion?

alternate accounts of organized experience rather than a full articulation of these theories.

Gibson starts by noticing that the black bordered triangle is hidden behind the
white bordered triangle only if you’re rooted to one spot which no animal ever
expects to do so in an ecologically realistic situation. Moving your head and body
around will quickly convince you that it’s no pac-man biting a triangle, for as you
move, you will notice the hidden parts of the circle. Even better, moving will help
you disambiguate whether the hidden object is a circle or some other continuous
object whose contour matches that of a circle. Gibson’s view12 is radically exter-
nalist, i.e., his theory of perception is about the external world, not our mind/brain’s
representation of it. He’s also the ﬁrst scientist to point out that the basic unit of
perception is an animal that’s moving its eyes, head and body rather than a static
pinhole camera. In summary, here’s Gibson’s explanation for the completeness of
visual perception:
Perceptual experience is complete because the world is complete. The circle is
perceived as a circle because it’s really a circle and it reveals itself to be one.
In other words, Gibson says the world is both coherent and transparent. The
enactive view of perception13 ﬂeshes out Gibson’s emphasis on the mobile animal;
while the enactivists agree with his premise that an animal isn’t a pinhole camera,
they place less emphasis on the informational structure of the external environment
and more emphasis on the sensorimotor coupling of the organism with its
environment.

What does that mean for our understanding of perceptual organization? Let’s take
the circle (Fig. 26.5) that reveals itself according to Gibson. Enactivists point out
that in most views, the circle projects to an ellipse (unless you’re looking straight at
it), and they also argue that looks like a circle precisely because it’s viewed as an
ellipse.14 While Gibson would only focus on the circle, the enactivists claim that we
can explain perception only through the sensorimotor understanding of how ellipses
are generated by an underlying circle as the animal moves around. The world doesn’t
reveal itself in one go; it reveals itself only to the go-getting creature.
To the enactivist, perception is complete because the world is accessible to a
mobile creature.
The Gibsonian and enactivistviews are close to each other—in both cases,theshape
of an object in the world is an invariant revealed by the motions of an animal. Gibson
emphasizes the acquisition of that environment in one shot, what he calls direct per-
ception.15 The enactivists emphasize the agents motions through the environment and
the sensorimotor coupling between the two; the global invariant, i..e, shape, may never
be fully revealed but as long as it’s there in the world, relevant aspects can be accessed
as necessary. I don’t have any idea of the shape of a mountain but I do have an
understanding of its local contours as I hike up its trails. That’s good enough for me.
So we have covered three accounts of completeness: it’s imposed by the mind of
the animal (Gestalt), the world is already complete (Gibson) and the world is poten-
tially complete and every aspect is available to the probing creature (enactive). Note
how all three theories are theories of how the world presents itself to an animal. The

animal world isn’t the same as the material world of physics, for it comes with a point
of view—the animal’s perspective. Where the three disagree is in their explanation of
the source of the organization. The gestaltist believes that the organization is imposed
by the mind of the animal; it’s radically anti-physical. Gibson believes that the world is
intrinsically organized, but even for him, that organization doesn’t consist of the laws
of physics; instead the organism picks up features relevant to its ecological needs. The
fact that chairs are sit-table isn’t a fact of physics but a fact of the human environment.
Finally, the enactivists locates the world’s organization in the interaction between the
organism and its environment. I know that chair is sit-table because I know that if I
position my body just right I will land on the chair’s surface.
They are all compatible with our idea of spatial syntax, though they would each put a
different spin on it; the gestaltists would say that these features are imposed by the mind,
the Gibsonians would say they are directly perceptible and the enactivists would
attribute them to sensorimotor invariants. So would any other theory that imputes some
intrinsic structure to the organismic world. The main contrast is with the blooming
buzzing confusion, i.e., a disorganized chaos. James and other empiricists thought that
humansarebornwithablankslateandacquireknowledgethroughtheircontactwiththe
world. That hypothesis about the fragmented nature of children’s experience has been
convincinglyrebuttedbychildpsychologistssuchasElizabethSpelke.16Wedon’t need
to enter into that debate except to say that whether we start with a blank slate or a full
plate, our experience is never confusing; it’s always whole and complete.
The baby lives in a baby’s world. The adult lives in an adult’s world and the path
between the two is always from one complete world to another. By the way, the
completeness of our world isn’t due to the completeness of our perception;
researchers are increasingly aware that we represent the world in fragments,17
lacking awareness of major changes if they don’t interfere with our task at hand.
Why wouldn’t it be so when the world is there to supply whatever is missing?
Perception isn’t complete but the world we inhabit is complete.
Indeed it’s the completeness of our world that makes it hard for us to imagine
ourselvesintothebat’sworld.Thevisualarrayofcolour,shapeandformissoobviously
the world for us that we have a hard time understanding what it’s like to be an organism
whose world is not made out of visual shape and form. The ‘what it’s like for us to be
human’ is an impediment toward understanding what it’s like for a bat to be a bat.

Conclusion: The Universality of Spatial Syntax
Every animal lives in a world of its own. The world of ticks may be limited,
signaled entirely by butyric acid. The human world is richer, with signs coming
from several senses. However, both the tick and the tyrant are content in their

respective worlds, believing that it has everything one might desire. These worlds
aren’t separate; the tick can suck my blood and I can squash it in return, but there
might not be much else in common. Indeed, we might worry with Nagel that only
features our world shares with the tick’s word are objective features of physics, the
features that make it possible for the tick to bite me and for me to crush the tick.
Does spatial syntax offer a way out of Nagel’s cave? Are there universal features
of the subjective experience that transcend species boundaries? I can only speculate
but let me do so with our account of spatial syntax in the background. If these
features are indeed universal, depending only on being a creature moving in a
spatial environment, then a ﬁrst step toward understanding the world of the bat
would be in testing whether it responds to these features in some sensory modality.
Both bats and humans are mobile, tactile creatures, features we share with every
animal on earth. Tactility is even more general, since we share it with plants as well.
Our exploration of perceptual organization suggests the possibility that the world of
every creature is an organized whole, as hypothesized by Von Uexkull a while
ago.18 He didn’t have the beneﬁt of a formal account that would underlie his theory,
but we can hypothesize that something like spatial syntax must be a building block
of any animal world. Here’s our heuristic:
• Every mobile, tactile creature shares a world with other mobile, tactile creatures.
Put another way, spatial syntax is available to every mobile, tactile creature.
Let me reiterate the claim once again: what it is to be a mobile, tactile creature
is—at some elemental level—like what it’s to be another mobile, tactile creature.
I might be guilty of overreach here—a bacterium chemotaxing its way to food is
as much a mobile tactile creature as I am—but at this preliminary stage it’s better to
be generous and draw the boundary as widely as possible. Then there are other
worries: some robots are also mobile, tactile devices. Is it the same to be me as it is
to be a robot at some level?
These are real worries though not ones we can address in this paper or anywhere
else at this moment. We share a long evolutionary history with ﬂies and ticks and it
might be wise to address the question “what is it like to be a mobile, tactile creature
conditional upon a billion plus years of shared history?” than without assuming that
shared heritage. Then again, intuition suggests that evolutionary history shouldn’t
enter the question at all—if I was imaged in a molecular 3D scanner and that image
was used to print out a replica that moved and talked, I suspect the replica would
share much of my consciousness.
Too many conﬂicting intuitions. All we know is that tactility and motility uniﬁes
much of life from bacteria to blue whales and that’s as good a starting point for an
investigation of shared experience as anything else. A skeptic wouldn’t believe
these arguments, but if you’re inclined to be generous when it comes to a shared
sense of being alive, then here’s a way for us to theorize our common position.

Abstract It is now very well accepted that over the history of life on Earth,
organisms ranging from bacteria to humans have evolved mechanisms that can
quite efﬁciently measure passage of time that help in restricting behavior, physi-
ology and metabolism to certain times of the day, thereby generating overt rhythms.
In this article, we discuss answers to questions that a naïve but interested reader
may ask regarding such intricate biological timing systems. Do we really have
biological clocks? And if so, where are they located? How do they work? More
importantly, why do we have them, and why is it important to study them? In an
attempt to answer these questions, we ﬁrst discuss studies that demonstrate the
endogenous and innate nature of biological rhythms. We then discuss how the
mechanisms that generate such rhythms serve as our very own biological clocks to
keep time efﬁciently. Further, we elaborate on the anatomical location of biological
clocks, and describe the molecular processes underlying them. Penultimately, we
discuss the origins and possible reasons for the existence of such clocks, and ﬁnally
describe the implications of aberrant and misaligned (out-of-sync with the external
environment) clocks on human health.

27.1
Dawn of ‘Time’ in Biology
The concept of ‘time’ has been of profound interest and a topic of debate for
mankind with deep roots in religion and philosophy from ancient times to the
present day, with some philosophers even dismissing time as being a mental
construct and ‘unreal’ [1, 2]. While a debate on the ‘nature of time’ is worthy of a
chapter in itself, here, however, we will discuss ‘time in nature’. Have we ever
wondered why is it that we sleep at certain times of the day and eat at certain times?
Why we work more efﬁciently at some times of the day and less efﬁciently at other
times? Is such a time-dependent phenomenon restricted only to us humans or is it
common to other organisms? This article will discuss efforts of mankind in
understanding time-keeping and temporal order in living systems and its clinical
implications.
Aristotle, as early as ∼4th century BC, observed that several other animals also
sleep at night just like us humans [3]. Although such descriptions of temporal
processes in biology were among the ﬁrst of its kind, eventually a major concen-
tration of the discipline steadily moved into the domain of spatial biology wherein
researchers were busy studying anatomical location of organs, location and function
of cellular components (with the advent of microscopy), geographical distribution
of organisms, and theories of organismal development [4].
The study of ‘time’ in modern biology, a topic that will remain the focus of
this article, however, gained impetus only by ∼18th century AD with a French
astronomer, Jean-Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan, discovering that leaves of the touch-
me-not plant (Mimosa pudica) open and close at certain ﬁxed times of the day [5]
through a mechanism that appeared to be internal to the organism rather than a mere
response to external cycles, thus paving the way for the study of yet another
extraordinary feature of living systems—a biological clock!
27.2
Rhythms of Life
Following de Mairan’s discovery, systematic studies revealed rhythmic processes in
a range of behavioral, physiological and metabolic processes with many different
periodicities, and across several organisms (Table 27.1). For instance, rhythms with
very short periodicities (on the order of seconds to minutes) are observed in res-
piration, electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG) and neuronal
ﬁring. On the other hand, there are rhythms in sleep-wake, foraging, and several
nephrological variables in mammals that have intermediate periodicities (on the
order of hours); while estrous cycles in non-primate mammals and menstrual cycles
in humans, migration and reproduction in birds, ﬂowering of bamboos, and quite
intriguingly suicides in humans have relatively longer periodicities (on the order of
months to years) [3, 6, 7]. Among such rhythms, the most widely distributed and
commonly studied are the ones that have near 24-h periodicities (‘circadian’,
meaning ‘approximately-a-day’) [5, 8].

L. Abhilash and V.K. Sharma

Circadian rhythms are thought to have evolved in almost all life-forms on Earth
as a consequence of the 24-h cycling of its physical environment (such as light and
temperature) caused by Earth’s rotation about its own axis. Skeptical researchers,
for a very long time, dismissed the notion that such rhythms were indeed
endogenously generated by arguing that they are passive responses to unidentiﬁed
geophysical cycles arising due to Earth’s rotation [3]. However, experiments in a
spacelab using a fungus (Neurospora) revealed that the circadian rhythm in coni-
diation (generation of a fungal reproductive unit) persists in the absence of any
earthly inﬂuences thereby suggesting that such rhythms are not passive responses to
physical cycles on Earth [3]. These rhythms, moreover, were also observed to
persist under constant (non-cyclic) conditions of the laboratory with an inherent
periodicity that is close to but signiﬁcantly deviating from 24-h indicating that they

are endogenously generated. Additionally, breeding experiments using ‘pure’ bred
lines with deviant periodicities revealed that such rhythms are indeed innate (ge-
netically inherited) [3].
The presence of such endogenous and innate rhythms that persist under
non-cyclic conditions justiﬁably warrants the notion that there are mechanisms
within organisms that are capable of keeping track of time on a daily scale (cir-
cadian timing system) and drive timed expression of behavior, physiology and
metabolism.
27.3
Circadian Timing Systems as Biological Clocks:
A Time-Keeper Within?
Temporal order can be maintained only if time-keeping is efﬁcient, and this raised
two
major
questions
that
concerned
researchers
regarding
the
nature
of
time-keeping in organisms, (i) ‘do organisms have the ability to measure passage of
time?’ and (ii) ‘can circadian timing systems serve as biological clocks?’
Gustav Kramer, a well-known German zoologist and ornithologist, while
studying bird navigation stumbled upon some remarkable evidence which sug-
gested that organisms may have the ability to measure time. After training birds to
feed at an artiﬁcial feeder, located at a particular angle relative to the sun, he
demonstrated that birds navigate to the same feeder even after several hours despite
the sun being in a different position relative to the feeder, suggesting that birds have
the ability to correct their navigation system for the motion of the sun by measuring
passage of time between the training and test events. This provided evidence
supporting the notion that birds can measure passage of time [5]. Additionally,
experiments by Karl von Frisch, an Austrian ethologist and Nobel laureate
demonstrated that organisms can keep time and that circadian timing systems may
play a key role in doing so. von Frisch and his student Ingeborg Beling marked
individual bees and trained them to feed on sugar solution at an artiﬁcial feeder at
the same time every day (once every 24-h), and on the test day did not provide the
sugar solution, and noted that most individuals arrived at the feeder within the
training time, thereby suggesting time-keeping ability in honeybees. Such training
was not successful when the bees were trained to feed once every 19 or 48-h,
implying that a 24-h timing system was in use for time-measurement [5].
However, rate of biochemical reactions (that may govern circadian rhythms)
vary with changes in temperature akin to early mechanical watches, which had
metal balance springs that would expand or contract depending on the temperature,
thereby providing incorrect estimates of time. Colin Pittendrigh (one of the pioneers
of the study of circadian rhythms) asked if natural selection has solved this problem
of accurate time-keeping under different ambient temperatures in organisms, and
since this aspect would be more relevant to poikilotherms (individuals whose body
temperature changes with changes in environmental temperatures), and not so much
340
L. Abhilash and V.K. Sharma

to mammals such as ourselves, he used the fruit ﬂy (Drosophila) model to address
this question. Pittendrigh demonstrated that the period of circadian rhythms in
Drosophila (and therefore its ability to measure time) under constant conditions
was indeed maintained stably at high and low ambient temperatures, a phenomenon
referred to as temperature compensation [5].
Several such experiments revealed, for the ﬁrst time, that the biochemical sys-
tems that generate persistent, endogenous and innate circadian rhythms could
measure passage of time robustly across temperature ﬂuctuations, thereby sug-
gesting that the functional signiﬁcance of such systems is to appropriately schedule
behavioral, physiological and metabolic activities in-sync with cycling abiotic and
biotic factors of the environment. This synchronization of endogenous rhythms to
the environmental cycles by daily resetting of the underlying ‘biological/circadian
clocks’ in response to time-cues is known as entrainment (described elaborately in
[5]), and is considered to be one of the clock’s most crucial functions.
27.4
Where Are Biological Clocks Located and How Do
They Govern Rhythms?
After identifying the major properties of biological clocks, studies were conducted
in order to locate them and understand how such clocks function at molecular and
physiological levels. However, due to space constraints, we will highlight only the
key evolutionarily conserved features of the anatomy and molecular-physiological
cogs and gears of biological clocks hereon and offer our sincere apologies to others
whose spectacular work we are unable to discuss.
Early studies in cockroaches revealed that their biological clocks comprise a
group of neurons located in the optic lobes, ventrally between the medulla
and lobula, and in similar regions in crickets, grasshoppers and desert beetles [9].
Furthermore, in Drosophila, transplantation experiments along with brain mutants,
mosaics and transgenic ﬂies led to the identiﬁcation of a network of ∼150 lateral
and dorsal neurons in the ﬂy brain that serve as biological clocks [9]. In these insect
models, one of the remarkable features is that similar neurochemicals such as PDH
and PDF (pigment dispersing hormone and factor, respectively) mediate commu-
nication among constituent neurons of the biological clock circuit to bring about
coherent overt rhythms [9].
Additionally, lesioning various parts of the mammalian brain proved to be useful
in identifying the location of biological clocks in mammals, wherein a paired
neuronal structure in the antero-ventral hypothalamus, just above the optic-chiasm
on either side of the third ventricle (Suprachiasmatic Nuclei/SCN) of the brain was
discovered to be the mammalian biological clock [10]. Each unilateral SCN of the
mouse contains ∼10,000 neurons, and is divided into a ventral ‘core’ and a dorsal
‘shell.’ Each of these neurons in the SCN is known to function autonomously to
produce circadian oscillations in spontaneous ﬁring as indicated by multi-electrode
27
Time Measurement in Living Systems …
341

recordings from cultured tissues. Coupling of these individual SCN neurons via
neuropeptide signaling and/or gap-junctions, gives rise to robust circadian rhythms
[10]. At a more gross level, the core receives direct light-input from the eye
(perceived by photoreceptors such as melanopsin) [10], via the retino-hypothalamic
tract (RHT) and produces several neurotransmitters including VIP (vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide), CAL (calretinin), NT (neurotensin) and GRP (gastrin
releasing peptide). The shell, on the other hand, receives inputs from the core and
expresses the neurotransmitters AVP (arginine vasopressin), angiotensin-II and
met-enkephalin [10]. Although it is thought that the SCN core and shell talk to each
other primarily using GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) to produce coherent rhythms,
this model is heuristic and the physiology of biological clocks in mammals may be
much more complex than what is described here [10].
These studies point towards the fact that biological clocks are nervous tissue-
based systems and the fact that, in most cases, biological clocks are in physical
proximity to the eye, or have direct connections to it, suggest that light may be the
primary source of temporal information for them.
Subsequently, several studies demonstrated the presence of not one, but many
biological clocks within an organism, and we will discuss results of some such
experiments here. Hamsters are nocturnal, and display rhythmic activity with higher
and consolidated activity during night-time. Curiously, it was observed that when
these hamsters were moved from light-dark cycles to constant illumination, their
activity bouts tend to split into two or more components with each component often
exhibiting a different period (suggestive of different clocks) [5]. In another study,
human subjects living in isolation in Norway (during the Arctic summer, therefore
constant illumination) were subjected to artiﬁcial light-dark cycles with 16.5-h of
light and 7.5-h of darkness and the rhythms in sodium, potassium and creatinine
excretion were regularly monitored. Once the rhythms stabilized, the light-dark
cycle was reversed. It was observed that the rate at which each of these rhythms
resynchronized to the newly imposed light-dark cycles was different, suggesting
independent control of these rhythms [5]. Such experiments revealed that there
might be more than just one biological clock within organisms such that each of
these activity components in case of the hamsters, and rhythms in case of humans
are regulated by different biological clocks. Astounding progress has been made
over the years, from ancient organisms all the way up to humans, and it has been
demonstrated that there are clocks in multiple peripheral tissues (for instance,
adrenal gland, heart, intestine and liver) that are synchronized by the ‘central’
biological clock in the brain, each of which regulates local rhythmic functions [5],
thereby illustrating the extent to which one can push the frontiers of human
understanding of ‘time’ and ‘time-keepers’ in biological systems.
The most basic thematic understanding of biological clock organization is
described in what is popularly called an ‘Eskinogram’, wherein temporal infor-
mation from the local environment reaches the core rhythm generators (central
biological clocks) via input pathways and the rhythm generator regulates overt
rhythms in behavioral, physiological and metabolic processes via downstream
output pathways (Fig. 27.1, Top). However, at the intracellular level, only

input and core rhythm generators are very well-studied and will be discussed here.
From theoretical predictions on oscillatory systems, it was postulated that positive
and negative feedback loops are at the heart of mechanisms that generate rhythms.
Thus, the wait was only to discover molecules that complete the feedback loop
puzzle in living systems.
Here, we brieﬂy describe the well-studied molecular underpinning of biological
clocks in Drosophila to give the readers a general impression of the molecular
mechanisms that drive circadian rhythms (Fig. 27.1, Bottom). Interestingly, studies
ranging from cyanobacteria to mammals have revealed remarkably conserved
feedback mechanisms (only with different names for the participating genes)
comprising transcription-translation based loops along with post-transcriptional and
post-translational modiﬁcations, and these mechanisms are discussed at great length
in [11]. In Drosophila, the transcription factors CLK (CLOCK) and CYC (CYCLE)
form a heterodimer complex that binds to the promoter region (E-boxes) of the per
(period) and tim (timeless) genes, thereby transcribing per and tim such that the
peak mRNA levels are reached around early-to-midnight. Subsequently, the
respective PER and TIM proteins peak in the cytoplasm. As the PER and TIM
proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm, another protein DBT (DOUBLETIME)
kinase associates with and degrades PER. This degradation of PER is hindered by
interaction of TIM with PER which forms a stable PER-DBT-TIM complex. The
stable PER-DBT-TIM complex is acted upon by yet another set of proteins SGG
(SHAGGY) and CK2α (CASEIN KINASE 2α) which promotes the entry of PER
and TIM into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER and TIM displace the
CLK-CYC heterodimer thereby repressing their own transcription. This entire loop
is completed in ∼24-h thus giving rise to ∼24-h (circadian) oscillations in mRNA
and protein levels of many of these genes. Subsequently, it was found that an
additional feedback loop involving vri (vrille), pdp (PAR domain protein) and cwo
(clockwork orange) genes in addition to the one just described also plays a key role
in the orchestrated generation of rhythms [12]. Moreover, the core loop must be
capable of receiving environmental information that allows biological clocks to
synchronize to the external light-dark cycles. In Drosophila, a dedicated circadian
photoreceptor known as CRY (CRYPTOCHROME) degrades TIM in the cyto-
plasm in the presence of light. Therefore, depending on the time of the day at which
ﬂies are exposed to light, formation of the PER-DBT-TIM complex will be
accelerated or decelerated thereby facilitating synchronization of the molecular loop
with the environmental light-dark cycles. Although, the output pathways are not
characterized as well as the input and core rhythm generators, it is believed that the
core clock genes per, tim, clk, cyc and vri along with other components may play a
role in mediating overt rhythmicity in behavioral, physiological and metabolic
processes (Fig. 27.1, Bottom) [12].
A biological clock can, therefore, be deﬁned as a network of input and output
pathways along with the core rhythm generators that interact in a complex feed-
back, coupled via several neuropeptides/transmitters that ultimately gives rise to
rhythms in different biological processes with the emergent property of the network
being its period (∼24-h) that can efﬁciently keep track of local time.

Why Do We Have Biological Clocks?—Origins
and Evolution
Although justifying the origins and evolution of biological clocks is a herculean
task in itself, here we brieﬂy touch upon tentative answers to the three following
questions, and redirect the interested reader to [13] for a detailed discussion of the
same.
27.5.1
When Did Biological Clocks Originate?
The period of the Earth’s rotation has undergone changes, and it is estimated that
when cyanobacteria (the earliest organism whose biological clocks are well-
studied) originated ∼3.5 billion years ago, the length of one day was ∼8-h. Our
current
understanding
of
biological
clocks
in
cyanobacteria
suggests
a
transcription-translation feedback loop based mechanism comprising the KaiABC
gene cluster with a periodicity of ∼22-h. However, the KaiA, KaiB and KaiC genes
do not appear to have evolved at the same time i.e., during the origin of
cyanobacteria (see Fig. 27.2). Comparative and gene homology studies across
several species suggest that KaiC was the ﬁrst to appear (perhaps providing by itself

a negative feedback loop generating rhythms with ∼4-h periodicity), followed
quickly by KaiB (that may have lengthened periodicity of the clock as day-length
on Earth became longer), and KaiA is thought to be the most recent addition to the
loop (that may have given rise to cyanobacteria’s present day periodicity) and is
found only in Synechococcus spp. (one genus of cyanobacteria). Therefore, our best
guess as to when biological clocks originated is at ∼3.5 billion years ago (Fig. 27.2)
[13]; however, this is only a conjecture.
27.5.2
Why Did Biological Clocks First Originate?
Charles Darwin is thought to have provided the ﬁrst recorded explanation for why
organisms may need biological clocks, and what may have driven the evolution of
the same in the ﬁrst place. Around the late 19th century, he systematically recorded
movements in plants and made detailed observations of several plants that open and
close their leaves at certain times of the day [14]. This led him to believe that some
features in the environment may be deleterious to the plant’s survival, in this case
prolonged duration of light. He argued that in order to avoid such damage, plants
‘choose’ to open and close their leaves at relevant times of the day. Subsequently,
two major theories have been proposed to understand the ﬁrst origins of biological
clocks, both of which are discussed at length elsewhere [13].
Organisms such as cyanobacteria, whose biological clocks are extensively
studied, originated much before the great oxygenation event that occurred ∼2.5
billion years ago (Fig. 27.2) [13]. It is conceivable that organisms that lived on
Earth much before this event would have been exposed to extreme temperatures and
solar radiations (see Fig. 27.2), and these may have been potent factors driving the
origin of biological clocks; the idea being that clocks would help time behavior and
physiology appropriately to avoid harsh conditions to the best possible extent. In
this regard, we have the ‘escape from light’ hypothesis, where it is theorized that
factors such as exposure to UV-radiations (an effect of which is increased errors in
DNA replication and photochemical RNA and protein reactions) may have led to
the origin of biological clocks that may help organisms avoid such harmful effects
of environmental factors.
On the other hand, we have the ‘endosymbiotic coordination’ theory. It is
believed that the origin of eukaryotic life-forms (see Fig. 27.2) lay in multiple
prokaryotes coming together as endosymbionts that form something of a precursor
for the present day cellular organelles. It was thought that along with cellular
compartmentalization of such proto-organelles, temporal coordination of interacting
sub-cellular processes is essential to avoid intracellular chaos [13]. However, nei-
ther of these hypotheses have very convincing data to support them, hence remain
open questions to date.

27.5.3
Why Do We Need Biological Clocks in the Present
Day?
Natural factors that may have driven the origin of biological clocks may not be so
obvious to us today. Then, why do we still have biological clocks? Do we really
need them? What functional role may it have to be still retained by natural selec-
tion? Two major hypotheses have been raised to understand the same.
27.5.3.1
Intrinsic Advantage Hypothesis
As mentioned earlier, although the central rhythm generator for most animals is in
the brain, clocks in peripheral tissues such as adrenal gland, liver, heart and
intestines have also been discovered over the years [5, 8]. An intuitive explanation
for why biological clocks are required can be drawn from the very fact that multiple
clocks co-exist, and temporal harmony within an organism can be maintained only
via coordinated functioning of each of these clocks. This idea is popularly referred
to as the intrinsic advantage hypothesis.
Early experiments were done in order to understand if indeed harmony among
constituent clocks had any noticeable advantage for the organism. Cockroaches
were used elegantly to demonstrate that the suboesophageal ganglia (the clock
regulating activity-rest rhythm) when out-of-sync with other constituent clocks of
the body led to the development of tumors. This was later attributed to desynchrony
among various biochemical oscillations [15]. Additionally, in case of intracellular
metabolism, components of different biochemical pathways may be incompatible
with each other, as is the case with nitrogen ﬁxation and photosynthesis in
cyanobacteria, and it is thought that biological clocks may serve to create separate
temporal niches to avoid such biochemical clashes [13]. Modern lifestyles which
include rapid travel across multiple time-zones, or shift-work schedules have
revealed that different biological rhythms (such as those in body temperature and
psychomotor performance) take different times to re-adjust to the new time-zone,
thereby creating disharmony among constituent physiological processes in humans,
leading to much discomfort, a condition known as jet-lag (discussed in the next
section) [5], and this therefore suggests that synchrony among constituent biolog-
ical clocks is essential for well-being.
Unequivocal evidence for such a hypothesis comes from studies performed in
the laboratory that monitors trajectories of biological clock evolution in real-time
[13]. If the intrinsic advantage hypothesis were not true, one may hypothesize that
biological clocks in populations living under constant (non-cyclic) environments
would gradually regress. Two studies using Drosophila populations that were
reared under constant illumination and darkness for over ∼700 and ∼1000 gener-
ations respectively tested this hypothesis. Both these studies reported the
27
Time Measurement in Living Systems …
347

persistence of robust circadian rhythms in their respective Drosophila populations
despite being reared under non-cyclic environments for several hundreds of
generations [13], suggesting that their biological clocks had not regressed
over time.
Such data from multiple experiments compel us to believe that an evolutionary
advantage of possessing circadian clocks in the present day would be that they
could synchronize and temporally partition internal and incompatible processes,
respectively.
27.5.3.2
Extrinsic Advantage Hypothesis
Variation is the essence of natural systems. Daily variations in physical parameters
of the earth due to its rotation include cycles in light intensity and spectral com-
position, temperature, humidity and barometric pressure among several others.
Such concerted cycling of several parameters gives rise to a complex network of
‘favorable’ and ‘unfavorable’ times of the day for individuals [15]. It is thought that
biological clocks exist to help organisms time their various behaviors to such
ecologically favorable times of the day so that it is in-sync with its environment,
thereby enhancing survival and reproduction.
Evidence for this hypothesis comes from several lines of investigations. Early
studies indicated that in cyanobacteria appropriate timing of events with respect to
laboratory light-dark cycles provided competitive advantage over other strains with
inappropriate timing [16]. Additionally, some interesting experiments were carried
out in the wild to test the extrinsic advantage hypothesis. Antelope ground squirrels
are generally diurnal, but it was observed that when their biological clocks are
removed they become more active in the night, and mortality due to predation in
these animals was 30 % more than the ones with intact clocks [8]. Similar exper-
iments were performed with free-living chipmunks and the results were strikingly
similar [8]. Furthermore, several studies have shown that aberrant or misaligned
biological clocks lead to severe reduction in survival and Darwinian ﬁtness (mea-
sure of an individual’s contribution to the gene pool of the next generation) in
Drosophila [13]. Additionally, several studies have also reported the adaptive
evolution of timing of behavior in real-time [13], thereby suggesting that appro-
priate timing of behavior may be important for survival and reproduction, and
biological clocks help organisms choose favorable times to perform functionally
relevant tasks.
Studies described in this section have led to our understanding of why biological
clocks may have originated, when they may have originated and what functions
they serve today. Although, the present day adaptive functions of biological
clocks are well-studied and agreed upon, the why and when of origins of bio-
logical clocks are still open questions awaiting rigorous experimentation and
unequivocal data.

27.6
Biological Clocks (Rhythms) and Their Clinical
Implications
Understanding biological clocks and thereby rhythms in such great detail with a ﬁne
grasp on their molecular underpinnings brings upon us the responsibility of dis-
seminating the clinical relevance of such research. It is now known that nearly half
of the mammalian genome is expressed rhythmically in one or more tissues [10],
suggesting that most processes in living systems are likely to be associated with
biological clocks. Therefore, the clinical relevance of studying such systems is
enormous. As discussed earlier, the primary function of biological clocks is to
synchronize internal processes with external environments to promote well-being. It
has now been shown that misalignments and/or disorders of biological clocks have
serious consequences on health, one of the most common being the effect on sleep.
Two common pathologies that stem from dysfunctional biological clocks are
advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes (ASPS and DSPS, respectively) [8].
Patients with ASPS, a disorder known to stem from a mutation of a single dominant
autosomal gene on the 2nd chromosome, sleep (∼8 p.m.) and wake (∼3 a.m.) very
early in the day, while patients with DSPS sleep (∼4 a.m.) and wake (afternoon)
very late during the day. Such disorders can be treated both behaviorally and by
using medication. Sleep-time readjustment therapies by controlled sleep-wake
schedules that gradually progress towards the desired sleep-time have been found to
be successful [5]. Moreover, the use of pharmacological agents such as melatonin
that is known to reset biological clocks can also be administered at speciﬁc times of
the day to achieve appropriate sleep-times [8].
Additionally, misalignment of biological clocks (often caused due to rapid travel
from one time zone to another, thereby disturbing the synchrony between internal
and external cycles) induces discomfort associated with disruption of sleep,
gastro-intestinal functions and decreased vigilance and attention-span, collectively
known as jet-lag. A more common form of jet-lag is now referred to as social jet-lag
[17]. This is another common example of misalignment of biological clocks, not
with the environmental cycles but with social time [17]. Social time can be deﬁned
as a collectively agreed upon time of performing certain kind of activity, for
instance, school timing and work-place timing. Human populations are character-
ized by a continuous distribution of chronotypes with the extremes being lark and
owl chronotypes, or in other words, extremely ‘morning’ and extremely ‘evening’
people. Chronotypes are naturally occurring variation in timing of events among
organisms that are mediated by an interaction of underlying biological clocks and
the environmental cycles [17]. It is, therefore intuitive that different chronotypes are
likely to have problems adjusting to different social times [17]. Several forms of
misalignment of biological clocks exist, and these could commonly occur due to
repeated shift-work as is the case with long-distance drivers, factory workers and
ﬂight attendants, and extended work-hours as is the case with nurses, hospital
interns, resident physicians, surgeons and experimental researchers. Such circadian
misalignments are known to have dire consequences such as road and factory
27

349

accidents, improper care for patients, and reduced work-efﬁciency which are
discussed in great detail elsewhere [8, 17]. Thus, circadian discord is a serious
health concern and must be treated with appropriate sleep-time readjustment ther-
apies via imposed sleep-wake schedules combined with, in some cases, appropriate
administration of drugs such as melatonin.
Furthermore, certain associations have been made between biological clocks and
psychiatric disorders albeit the link between the two is still unclear. For instance,
seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a depression like state that often occurs due to
reduced exposure to light and low ambient temperatures (characteristic of winters
and hence referred to as winter depression), is known to be associated with delayed
biological clocks and reduced amplitude of circadian oscillations [8]. Moreover,
biological clock malfunction is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders
such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease causing sleep disruption
in patients [18]. Effects of SAD and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s can
be ameliorated to some extent by imposed sleep-wake schedules and exposure to
bright light (bright light therapy), with good success rates [8].
The study of biological time is at an exciting stage now. Recent work has
focused on understanding the associations between biological clocks and immunity,
metabolism and obesity, cancer chemotherapy, cardiovascular events, and DNA
repair mechanisms. It is now known that several processes of the immune system
such as phagocytosis, proliferative responses to antigenic substances, cytolytic
activity, synthesis and release of cytokines and chemokines, are all rhythmic, and
under the inﬂuence of biological clocks [19]. Moreover, it has been reported that
biological clocks regulate metabolism and energy homoeostasis in the liver, and
have associations with lipogenic and adipogenic pathways, also linking obesity and
other metabolic disorders such as diabetes with inappropriate times of eating [20].
Additionally, many drugs used by humans are known to show daily variation in
efﬁcacy, which has led clinicians to optimize the timing of dosage such that
maximum effectiveness can be complemented with minimum toxicity, in treatments
such as cancer chemotherapy [8]. Furthermore, it is well established that adverse
cardiovascular events take place primarily during early morning, and recent work
has linked higher cardiovascular pathology to misaligned biological clocks [21].
Aziz Sancar, a Nobel laureate, who is recognized for his work on DNA repair
mechanisms also showed that a molecular component of biological clocks (cryp-
tochrome) is closely associated with DNA repair (during replication), thereby
striking an interesting link between biological clocks and DNA repair, a case that
was used to understand the ﬁrst origins of biological clocks (see Sect. 27.5.2) [22].
Such studies thereby highlight the fundamental and integral role of biological
clocks in sustaining health, and that the repercussions of disorders and misalign-
ment of biological clocks may be catastrophic.
Thus, investigations into the nature of biological rhythms have revealed how
rhythm generators serve as biological clocks that are innate. Further, these clocks
are primarily located in neural tissue in metazoans and their molecular physiology is
remarkably conserved across the living kingdom, thereby suggesting that biological
clocks are adaptations to the cyclic nature of life on Earth. Finally, the plethora of
350

functions that biological clocks perform necessitates further research on not only
the medical implications of clock dysfunction but also the nature of treatment of
other non-clock related disorders. We hope that the readers of this discourse imbibe
awareness of such a system into their outlook on biology such that we may better
discern the contours of the interaction of living systems with time. Further, we hope
to ignite interest in the ﬁeld to help resolve the several challenges that still lay ahead
of us in understanding these fascinating timing systems we possess.

The Cellular Space—The Space of Life
Pier Luigi Luisi
It is well known that life is cellular and only cellular: all tissues and organs of all
animals and plants are organized assemblies of cells—so that we can consider the
cell as the elemental constituent of life on this planet. Cells are (more or less)
spherical structures, closed by a membrane, as illustrated by the simpliﬁed
Fig. 28.1. It is in fact a very particular form of space, and in this short article we
would like to discuss why it is so and highlight the particular relation between this
form of space-and life.
The ﬁrst thing that comes to mind is that the cellular membrane, which closes the
spherical structure, permits to clearly discriminate the inside from the outside. This
discrimination between inside and outside, between my world and the environment
outside, is the ﬁrst operational deﬁnition of life’ individuality.
But this is not all. The closed membrane also means a protection, a warranty that
the organized inside is not going to be diluted or poisoned by all agents swimming
outside; and in this way, all what happens inside is going to remain a property of the
internal world. This is important also at the level of evolution: if some positive
mutation or any other chemical change takes place inside, this is going to be of
beneﬁt only for the internal world.
However, the membrane is, and must be, semi-permeable: this means, that some
particular compounds will be allowed to enter, so as to activate the internal
mechanisms of metabolism, while other compounds, no more useful, are going to

be expelled through the membrane. The selection of what may enter, and what not,
is determined by very ﬁne biochemical structural details of the membrane—and of
course different organisms will have different cellular selection criteria.
28.1
Being Open, Being Closed
This entrance of particular substances indicates a general principle: that the cell—
and this is true for any larger living organism—is a system which is thermody-
namically open. The living remains such, living, only if it acts as an open system,
permitting nutrients and energy to enter. In turn, this indicates that the living space
and the environmental space are necessarily linked to each other, and form, in a
kind of complementarity, the entire space of life.
The notion of thermodynamic openness is in apparent contrast with another
general principle of cellular life, commonly referred to as “operational closure”—
as particularly emphasized by the Santiago school of Maturana and Varela.
This means the following: that all what is needed to the liver cell to be a liver
cell, is contained in the cell itself. Or, in other words: the ant does not need any
information from the outside world to be an ant. It is the internal, speciﬁc orga-
nization of the cellular structure’ inside, that fully determines the properties and
behaviour of the organism. There are of course in life all kind of stimuli from the
outside-but, and this is the important point—these act as triggers, but not as
modiﬁers of the internal structure of the living. Thus, if I kick a dog, or I kick a
snake, the dog-and the snake-are going to react on the basis of their dog-ness or
snake-ness, from their internal circuit, from within.

This is in agreement with what we were saying before about the protection of the
internal world, as operated by the membrane. It is indeed an important property of
the circumscribed space: to be such, that the behaviour, namely the “way of doing”,
is due to the organization of the internal world.
This consideration is the basis of the theory of cognition, of Maturana and
Varela, see for that the references indicated below [1, 2, 4].
28.2
The Paradox of the Cellular Space
How large is a cell? The unit of measure is the micron (μm), one thousand of a
millimetre, and the smallest unicellular organisms—bacteria—may have a typical
diameter of a few microns (Escherichia Coli in our intestine is about 2 μm) with the
red blood cell we are at about 9 μm, with the amoeba we are at 90 μm, a human egg
cell is around 100 μm, giant bacteria can reach 600 μm, without forgetting that
nerve cells-the neurons-can reach one meter of length.
Inside this relative small space, there is an incredible chemical activity. In each
of our liver cell, every second there are thousands of transformations: sugars being
oxidized, proteins being hydrolysed, hormones being synthesized, proteins being
made thanks of the information of nucleic acids, nucleic acids being synthesized
thanks to the catalytic power of enzymes (special proteins)…
Figure 28.1, in its simplicity, then, does not yield the real complexity of a cell.
And as soon as one considers the continuous series of transformations taking place
inside each cell of each living organism, one realizes an apparent paradox. The
paradox is given by the fact, that despite all these transformations, a liver cell
remains a liver cell, an amoeba remains an amoeba, and so on… (at least for a long
period of observation, say during the so-called homeostasis).
How is this contradiction possible? How can we have self-maintenance, and
continuous chemical transformations at the same time in the same place?
Here lies the very essence and deﬁnition of cellular life, and life in general. In
fact, the main function of the cell is self-maintenance: the cell maintains its integrity
by re-generating from within all the compounds which are being destroyed. The
cell, as an open system, does so thanks to the nutrients and energy that comes from
the external milieu, so that there is a continuous conversion of these nutrients into
the cell components-so as to maintain a constant concentration of all reagents
inside. The cell, and each living organism in general, can be seen as a factory that
re-makes itself from within. Autopoiesis (self-production) is the term that Maturana
and Varela coined to illustrate this very important principle.
And the collateral principle is the following: that all living cells work in the same
way, autopoietically. Autopoiesis is the invariant property of life. Conversely, the
structure of the various cells in the different organisms is the variable property: the
membrane constituents can be different, there can be in that particular cell more or
less lipids, more or less saccharides, and the concentration of some reagents may
vary accordingly—but there is no cell that does not comply to the general principle
28
The Cellular Space—The Space of Life
355

of autopoiesis-the invariant mechanism. The invariant autopoietic mechanism, and
the variable structure, form the two complementary aspects of life. Note that what it
has been said for a single cell, is also valid for an entire organism—for the whole
elephant or for any human being. I am re-making continuously my haemoglobin, or
my hair, or my tissues, from within. And note also that this “from within”, which
means from within the boundary of the membrane, is equivalent to the notion of
operational closure, in the sense that all takes place thanks to the internal organi-
zation. Autopoiesis is thus a systems property, in the sense that what is important is
the organization of the entire cell, namely the interactions among all cell con-
stituents. This systemic view is in sharp contrast with the reductionist, DNA/RNA
centred view, according to which life is essentially based and due to on one type of
molecule [3, 4].
28.3
Space and Localization
The cell as pictured in Fig. 28.1 does not give a good idea of the great complexity
of the chemical transformations inside the cellular space.
For that, better to consider Fig. 28.2, which gives part-only part-of the meta-
bolism of a bacterial cell: thousands and thousands of reactions, all linked with each
Fig. 28.2 The metabolic scheme (part of it) of a bacterium

other, each reaction being catalysed—i.e. made possible at room temperature—by
the action of a speciﬁc protein—an enzyme; whereby each enzyme originates from
a speciﬁc gene, which in turn is synthetized by a speciﬁc family of enzymes. Really
a picture of great complexity.
But the question that now we would like to ask is the following: where is life
localized?
Well, the answer is obvious: life is not localized-there is not a single spot, a
single reaction, a single metabolic cycle, which may represent that speciﬁc bacterial
life. Life is the entire net of reactions. Life is not, and cannot be localized, as it is a
global, distributed property.
And the same can be said for every living organism. Is there a point, a place,
where the life of an elephant, or, for that matter, the life of a person, is localized? Of
course not.
And this concept, of a systemic space complexity with a distributed quality
without a centre of direction, is an important concept in the modern theory of
complexity. Where is New York localized? Where is the centre of localization of a
bee hive, of a termites’ nest, of a migrating bird formation?
Again, we have a situation as in the cellular space, which reﬂects life, but that
space encompasses the entire network of relations of all components with each
other. In a way, this is a direct consequence of the system’ view of life, whose main
tenet, is the following: that is the entire web of relations that makes up the main
general properties.
28.4
Finale
Let us go back to the principle of operational closure, and to the view from within
of each cellular space, and, from that respect, from the view from within of each
living organism. This view from within has important consequences from the
epistemic point of view, and one has to do with the relation with the environment,
which we have already touched upon, both talking about the thermodynamic
openness, and about cognition.
More generally, the consideration that the environment is seen “from within”,
implies that each organism sees the world in its own way. Clearly the world seen by
the ﬁsh, thanks to its speciﬁc sensorial tools, is different from the world of the bat,
and different from the world of the earth warm. There are all different kinds of
cognition, which means, that the world is not seen as an objective reality, equal for
everyone. There are then as many worlds, as many different organisms.
Now, if we translate this at the level of humankind, we have a similar situation.
My view of a rose, as a western man well versed in romanticism and traditional
European poetry, is different from the view of an Eskimo who may have never seen
a rose. Thus, it is not that the sensorial tools take a picture of the outside world
(what we call “Representationalism”) which is equal for all. Rather, there is a
co-emergence between the inner world and the environment, to form what
28
The Cellular Space—The Space of Life
357

Maturana and Varela call “enacting”, namely the construction of a world. The
world outside is due to the particular internal organization of the observer—but we
are not dealing however with a simple form of constructivism, rather with a
co-emergence between two factual realities.
Clearly, this view from within determines a crisis, or at least a critical discussion,
of the notion of objectivity, and brings in the question of the subjectivity in science
—a theme which we can only point to here. And related to that, still at the level of
human kind, there is the entire question of the consciousness-how and why do we
know that we exist?—which again I like to skip in this particular short assay.
Rather, I would like, on ending, put the attention to another aspect of the
interaction between the living and the environment, which has become so important
in the last decades: the questions of pollution, global warming, deforestation, loss of
biodiversity, the ozone hole, …all phenomena created by humankind, and which
threaten our own existence-or at least that of our future generations. One can say, at
this point, that they are all problems created by our hands and minds, namely
created mostly by us—and then we should be capable to remediate to all these
insults to Nature by going back to a healthier relation to our mind and hands.

The Consciousness of Space, the Space
of Consciousness
Mauro Bergonzi and Pier Luigi Luisi
In this article we intend to discuss some basic aspects of consciousness, focusing at
the end in the relation between space and consciousness. The notion of con-
sciousness in the last couple of decades has been the subject of lively academic and
mass media debates, and is certainly not our aim to review all this. However,
preliminarily, is necessary to somehow characterize the term. To this aim, it is still
useful to refer to the work of the philosopher Chalmers [6].
Accordingly, one should make a discrimination between the ‘hard’ and ‘easy’
problem of consciousness. The easy problem is that of sensorial consciousness (also
called ‘access consciousness’, see for example Thompson [14]), which refers to the
ﬁve perception senses (seeing, hearing, touching, etc.) plus mind/thinking. It is
considered ‘easy’ only in the sense that at least we can see a relation with our
brain–neurons, whose connections are implied in all these aspects of cognition. The
hard problem instead is related to the subjective experience: my feeling of blue, or
my wonder to beauty, which cannot be shared with others—my blue is only my
blue. This cannot be linked to the sensorial perception or to the brain activity:
actually we don’t even know why it is there. So, according to Chalmers’ view, it is
as if there were two different states of consciousness.
Later on we will argue that we do not necessarily agree with this dichotomy, but
for the time being let us go on, focusing on this subjective aspect of consciousness
—and following broadly in that the outline of Bergonzi’s book [1].

29.1
The Intuitive Evidence of ‘Being-Awareness’
In order to introduce the problem with a phenomenological approach, we would
like to ask a question to our readers:
“Right now, are you being aware?”. Or, more simply: “Are you aware?”
Your answer is of course positive: “Yes, I am aware”.
Here is, for us, a very ﬁrst and important point: your answer “Yes, I am aware” is
a thought, but this thought is a consequence of a checking up prior to your thought.
Did you need to think about it, or was the evidence of being aware already there
before any thought?
This elementary, preliminary awareness—namely, the pure and simple fact of
being aware, independently from what one is aware of—is for us the basic essence
of consciousness. In fact, we could have asked “Are you conscious?”
On this topic, many Western philosophers assume that consciousness or
awareness can only be ‘intentional’, i.e. consciousness of something, while the idea
of a contentless awareness is just a delusion. However, Forman [7], in his studies on
mysticism, quotes many reports of meditative experiences that furnish some evi-
dence of a ‘pure consciousness event’ (PCE) without any content at all, which
suggests a wider deﬁnition of ‘consciousness’ ([7], 112):
Thus, a synonym of consciousness should not be something like “awareness of anything
(intentional) at all”, but rather “awareness per se” which can (and usually does) become
aware of things.
Does that mean that you are conscious of your being too? Namely, that there is a
being, distinct from consciousness, which consciousness is aware of?
In order to ﬁnd an answer, let us revert to our phenomenological exploration by
asking our readers another simple question:
“Right now, are you sure that you exist?”
After a short pause, the answer will be “Yes”, beyond any doubt.
Both the question and the answer were thoughts, but in the short gap between
them (that occurred in order to verify directly whether you are present or not), the
undeniable evidence of your being became immediately plain.
Did you need to ponder on the answer, or was the evidence of ‘being’ previously
there, before any thought? If you were not already present, how could you even
think at all?
The very fact that our being is intuitively evident, proves not only that we exist,
but also that we are aware, otherwise our being would be unknown.
So, whenever we ask ourselves “Do I exist? Am I aware?”, we can immediately
ascertain that the answer is “Yes”. During that instantaneous intuitive inspection,
our being-awareness arises not as an object to be known, but as a self-evident fact
that, like light, does not need to be illuminated, because it shines of its own. In this
respect, there is a close similarity between our phenomenological analysis of
360
M. Bergonzi and P.L. Luisi

being-awareness and some current Western offsprings of the ancient Indian phi-
losophy of advaita or non-duality (see for example [12, 13, 15]).
Is being-awareness something that I have, or rather something that I am?
Could I ever exist apart from being-awareness?
Could I ever experience two ‘myselves’ at the same time?
Not at all, there is always only one ‘I’ at a time, which is the same as
being-awareness.
Therefore, if I am only one and I am being-awareness, then being and awareness
cannot be two separate things, but just two aspects of the same identity, or rather
two different ways to describe it.
Consequently, consciousness cannot be aware of ‘being’ as an object, because,
in order to do so, there should be two different things—consciousness (namely the
knowing subject) and being (namely the known object)—while they are just two
aspects of the same thing.
Someone could rebut: “But I am clearly conscious of my existence!”. This is not
entirely correct: one can only be aware of the thought “I exist”, which is not the
actual being, but rather its translation into a mental object made of words, that is a
mere content of consciousness. Being-awareness is not knowable as an object: it
shines as a self-evident actuality.
Note that also the expression “I know to know”, as a reﬂexive level of con-
sciousness, is due to our thinking, and as such is only an object of consciousness.
The sense of being (which the mind translates into the sentence “I am”) is actually
the precondition for everything to appear: if ﬁrst of all I am not here, then no
perception, no sensation, no action, and no thought can be experienced.
So consciousness as being-awareness—i.e. the very root of our identity—is
epistemically and existentially prior to the appearance of anything else. Of course,
here the primacy of consciousness is restricted only to the epistemological and
experiencial domain and does not convey any ontological stance.
This sense of being is an undeniable actuality: even in order to negate it, one
must ﬁrstly be there. We cannot avoid even for one single moment the fact
of existing and being aware, since we do not ‘have’ existence-awareness: we are it.
The sense of being or consciousness as such is a too simple and immediate evidence
for the thought to grasp: it is a non-conceptual awareness.
According to our view, this immediate aware presence is precisely what the term
‘consciousness as such’ points to: namely, the very ground and precondition of any
speciﬁc content that arises in experience.
This basic awareness is at the root itself of our ‘I-experience’, but nevertheless it
cannot properly be regarded as ‘personal’, due to the fact that we use the term ‘I’ as
a pointer to very different aspects of our experience.
For example, when we say “I am tall, fat, sick, old” and so on, the term ‘I’
clearly refers to the physical body. When we say “I am sad, happy, anxious,
intelligent” and so on, the term ‘I’ refers to the mind. At the same time, the term ‘I’
is always pointing to the ‘ﬁrst person’ subject of experience, i.e. consciousness.
These three different meanings of the term ‘I’ cannot be confused with each
other or compacted into one single entity, because all bodily sensations and all
29
The Consciousness of Space, the Space of Consciousness
361

mental thoughts are mere contents of consciousness, namely objects the con-
sciousness is aware of as a subject.
Therefore, since we usually employ the term ‘I’ to mean our ‘personality’, which
is made up of recurring mental patterns that are mere contents of awareness, it
would not be correct to equate tout court consciousness to the ‘I’. Consequently, the
basic consciousness, or presence, does not exactly correspond to the ‘I’, to the ‘me’.
We may in fact agree that it appears as a subjective experience, but this does not
necessarily mean that I can call it ‘my’ consciousness, since it cannot be confused
with the objects which it is aware of. This very point—whether and to what extent
one can talk in terms of ‘my consciousness’—is another intriguing question, to
which we will come back later on in this article.
29.2
Consciousness: A ‘Blind Spot’ for Science
Over the last years, several schools of neurobiology and cognitive science have
turned into the study of consciousness, at the aim of getting a deeper, scientiﬁc
understanding of this concept.
However, as already pointed out by some researchers [2, 3, 4, 5, 14], in our
opinion this kind of approach may be quite problematic.
In fact, most of the explanations or interpretations of consciousness assume that
it is something ‘out there’ that can be studied objectively—for example an emergent
property of the brain, or a quantum state, or a particularly complex brain resonating
structure (for a critical review, see [14]).
To some extent, it is possible to inquire experimentally some correlations
between the brain activities and the contents of consciousness, i.e. the experiences
which we are aware of´(like perceptions, bodily sensations or thoughts): this is what
Chalmers refers to as ‘the easy problem’.
However, consciousness as such—namely the very fact of being aware, a sort of
‘awakeness’, or ‘ﬁrst person aliveness’, or ‘aware presence’ which allows every
experience to appear and as such should not be confused with its own speciﬁc
‘contents’—is, so to speak, the ‘bottom line’ which cannot be consistently
explained as the end result of any physical or mental cause, since no ‘explanation’
nor ‘cause’ could appear without consciousness already being there as a precon-
dition. Using a different language [5] consciousness is not a phenomenon, is the
phenomenology itself.
Therefore, since all phenomena can be observed, studied or explained if and only
if consciousness is already there, it is impossible to regard consciousness as the end
product of any other phenomenon without stumbling upon an epistemological
paradox. This is what Chalmers refers to as ‘the hard problem’.
As already mentioned, David Chalmers’ view of consciousness is essentially
‘dualistic’. Based on the notion of consciousness as discussed above, we tend to
disagree with it. The sensorial aspects have to do with physical perception (e.g. the
vibrations in our ears when we hear a sound), but ultimately consciousness—the
362
M. Bergonzi and P.L. Luisi

‘luminosity’ of awareness, to use the terminology of ancient Indian philosophy—is
always the ﬁnal point. In this sense, there is no difference with the subjective state
of consciousness, and it is confusing to invoke two different kinds of consciousness.
Let us go back to the general question of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness, as
presented mostly by neurobiologists and cognitive scientists. At this regard, we can
highlight that, despite the variety of theories and interpretations, all these scientiﬁc
views generally rely on one basic principle: that consciousness is a ‘secondary’
property that ‘emerges’ from an organic support of biological matter, namely the
brain (once that it reaches a critical level of complexity).
We maintain that this hypothesis is epistemically weak in many respects.
Firstly, as mentioned already, due to some lack of philosophical accuracy,
neuroscientists often confuse the objects or contents of consciousness—thoughts,
sensations, perceptions, images or memories which can be observed and studied
experimentally in connection with the functions of the brain—with the very fact of
being aware (‘consciousness as such’). The latter, as said before, cannot be
observed as an object by science, since it is the source itself of any observation.
Secondly, let us consider the following: the theory of emergence can only
ascertain that from complex interactions between multiple components, some new
‘properties’ can appear that were not previously owned by the original components
and that can be detected by the observation of new qualities or behaviours. How-
ever, consciousness as such is neither a ‘quality’ nor a ‘behaviour’, but rather the
‘ﬁrst person’ awareness that observes the emergence of any possible quality or
behaviour, and as such it eludes the entire range of the observable objects: it eludes
the very phenomena that are consistent with an emergentist interpretation.
Thirdly, the cause/effect theory that regards consciousness as derivative from the
brain presumes a hierarchical causal order ranging from biological matter (the
primary factor) to consciousness (the secondary factor). But how can we assert the
priority of the brain over consciousness, if it is only through the medium of con-
sciousness that it becomes possible to perceive, know and study the brain?
Furthermore, in order to preserve its own objectivity and coherence, the standard
scientiﬁc method must resort to the conventional artiﬁce of studying what is
observed as if it were really independent and separate from the observer: so the
observer must always be kept out of the picture.
However, the price of this unavoidable abstraction is a self-evident epistemo-
logical limitation: its resulting world-view will always be incomplete, exclusively
conﬁned as it is within the range of the observable objects, from which the observer
(i.e. consciousness) remains in any case excluded. In order to preserve its own
validation, any procedure of scientiﬁc investigation can only occur inside the
boundaries of consciousness, which is always epistemically prior to any possible
objectiﬁcation carried out by the scientiﬁc research.
In other words, any observation or theory about the so called ‘objective’ reality
can never include consciousness, that is the very background of all observing and
theorizing activity: consciousness can never be ‘observed’ or ‘known’, because it is
always prior to whatever object is observable and knowable.
29
The Consciousness of Space, the Space of Consciousness
363

The notion of the primacy of consciousness is not yet very popular in our
scientiﬁc world. The main reason is probably due to the fact that in such a case
consciousness is not accessible epistemically to an objective scientiﬁc knowledge,
and therefore it is like a ‘blind spot’ for science: just as the eye cannot see itself, so
knowledge cannot grasp the very source of knowledge. This point has been already
emphasized in the literature (see for example Bitbol [4], Bitbol and Luisi [5],
Thompson [14], Bergonzi [1]). However, already many centuries ago, the Indian
philosopher Ṡaṅkara asserted with keen philosophical arguments that, just as ﬁre
cannot burn itself or a sword cut itself, so consciousness cannot know itself as an
object, since it is always on the side of the subject.
It appears then, that science may be unable to study consciousness ‘objectively’
(i.e. by describing it in ‘third person’), because it is always given to us in ‘ﬁrst
person’, and this is precisely its only distinctive feature: inevitably, whenever
science tries to study consciousness, it is obliged to force it into the range of
observable objects, so as to falsify its very essence of observing subject through an
epistemological inconsistency.
So the scientiﬁc study of consciousness as such seems to be not even a ‘hard
problem’, but actually an unsolvable problem.
How can we avoid this epistemological loop? Chalmers, in addressing this
question, puts forwards the idea that consciousness may be a fundamental property,
just like space or time. Space and time cannot be deﬁned, and we cannot say that
they derive from some other property—they are there and form the fundament of all
our science and our thinking. So should it be for consciousness?
Time does not seem mature enough for science to accept this. However, stran-
gely enough, some authoritative thinkers of quantum physics, coming from a very
particular way of arguments and scientiﬁc knowledge, have been more willing to
take seriously this hypothesis—and already several years ago.
For example, Plank [9] said:
I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness.
We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we
regard as existing, postulates consciousness.
Schrödinger [10] was in total agreement with him:
Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely
fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.
To some extent, even the simple act of thinking about consciousness (which is
not an object), by involving words that are always ‘object-oriented’, unavoidably
engenders a misrepresentation of it as an object.
However, to say that consciousness cannot be known as an object (since it is the
knowing subject) does not mean that subject and object are two separate things,
because both of them entail each other and always appear linked together in
experience.
There is a sound, and you may say: “I hear a sound”. Namely, there is me, and
there is the sound—a duality. However, let us ask you: can you say when or where
364
M. Bergonzi and P.L. Luisi

is it, that the sound ends, and the hearing begins? Can you make a distinction
between these two things? Or is it rather that we should say: “There is a hearing”?.
Actually, one and the same experience can be deﬁned either as ‘hearing’ if
described in terms of the subject who hears something, or as ‘sound’ if described in
terms of the object heard. However, in the actual experience of hearing, one cannot
establish a precise ‘edge’ where sound ends ‘out there’ and hearing begins ‘in here’:
in fact, there is just one, immediate experience and only later on, in order to
describe it, the thinking mind says “I heard a sound”, creating a deceptive
subject/object duality that is only due to some rules of grammar ([12], 67–69). In
fact, the distinction between ‘I’ and ‘external world’ is rather a creation of our
mental habits.
So the ‘boundary line’ that splits experience into two apparent ‘halves’ (subject
and object) is not ‘out there’, but only in our minds: the terms ‘consciousness’ and
‘world’ are just two different descriptions of one and the same indivisible experi-
ence (respectively in terms of the ‘ﬁrst’ or of the ‘third’ person), while the alleged
separation between ‘subject’ and ‘object’ is nothing but an illusory mental con-
struct, just as ‘ascent’ and ‘descent’ are only two different words for the same slope,
depending which way one is going. Schrödinger ([11], 127) expresses this revo-
lutionary idea as follows:
The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object
are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of
recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.
As a matter of fact, in our phenomenological exploration of consciousness (that
partakes to every experience as a knowing subject, but is not a knowable object),
we can safely rely on experience itself, but as soon as we begin to reﬂect on it, we
must never forget that, due to its own intrinsic limitations, thought is to be regarded
only as a preparatory tool for a sort of intuitive understanding of consciousness.
29.3
Consciousness and the Metaphor of Space
In this respect, employing space as a metaphor can perhaps be of some help to get
an intuitive understanding of consciousness.
On considering the similarities between space and consciousness, an interesting
point is this: though we cannot see space (since it is invisible), nonetheless we can
somehow clearly ‘feel’ it as a sort of ‘unlimited openness’ all around us. Actually
the same can be said for silence—again something that nobody can ‘hear’, but that
we all perceive distinctly. How does this perception/non-perception come about? Is
it all this fruit of our thinking mind, or are at work some unknown biological innate
mechanisms?
Those are probably questions we cannot answer, but in this respect the similarity
with consciousness is quite apparent: we cannot know consciousness as an object,
but we can ‘sense’ it as a sort of ‘awake spaciousness’ or ‘alive brilliance’. We
29
The Consciousness of Space, the Space of Consciousness
365

could say that we ‘know’ consciousness by being it, so this is not a subject/object
kind of knowledge, but rather what Forman ([7], 118) calls a ‘knowledge by
identity’:
In knowledge-by-identity the subject knows something by virtue of being it. […] Being
something in this case carries within itself a non-inferential sense of what it is to be it. It is a
reﬂexive or self-referential form of knowing.
Another aspect of the space metaphor which can be useful, concerns the concept
of consciousness’ contents. Someone can try to explain space by pointing at the sky
full of stars, or indicating a far away chain of mountains: there is the space!
But in fact those are only contents of space, as actually the space is what
contains all of that. Likewise, things I can point out to are only contents of con-
sciousness, which is the all-inclusive dimension of experience.
There may be another interesting reason why the metaphor of space can be
properly drawn when talking about consciousness: although we do not have a direct
experience of space as such, this notion is ‘embodied’ in us. In this regard, Lackoff
and Johnson argue [8] that we perceive our own body as having clearly a
front/back, right/left, up/down, or in/out side, and this internal knowledge condi-
tions us to see the external world with the same categories, including the
container/contained one. Likewise, if the notion of consciousness is ‘embodied’,
this can give rise to the metaphor of inner/out, which, in turn, brings about the
dualistic perception of self/other, subject/object and consciousness/external world.
At this regard, one can pose the question: is consciousness localized?
Before examining this question—mentioned already before—we must consider
the following interesting point: most of us, on thinking about consciousness, are
spontaneously brought to assume that its ‘centre’ abides somewhere behind the
eyes, inside the space of the head. However, this cannot be regarded as a proof of its
localization, as there is a simple explanation of this belief. In fact the head contains,
besides the brain (that is unperceivable), all the receptors of the ﬁve senses, plus the
thinking, and is therefore the seat of all perceptions. So it is the common confusion
between perception and consciousness which leads one to assume that conscious-
ness abides in the head, and in particular behind the eyes.
In order to clarify this point, again the metaphor of space can be of some help.
Our thinking mind needs to order events through pairs of opposite concepts, like
here/there or before/after: space is the common ground that enables the difference
between here/there to appear, just as time is the common ground that enables the
difference between before/after to appear.
More speciﬁcally, space allows localization: all objects are located here and
there through the common ground of space. However, space itself is not localized: it
is neither here nor there, because every ‘here’ and ‘there’ can appear only in it. So
space transcends the dualism here/there: a localized object can only be either here or
there, while space encompasses both of them.
Similarly, consciousness is the precondition for everything to appear in expe-
rience, but it is not limited by any speciﬁc object, since every experience arises in it,
as a content of it. So consciousness is the common ground that transcends any
366
M. Bergonzi and P.L. Luisi

difference or separation between one object of experience and another: like space, it
is not localized in a speciﬁc place or time, because every place and time appear in it.
Our exploration of space as a metaphor for consciousness can proceed further by
investigating a simple and ordinary everyday situation: imagine that, while
preparing some tea, besides the noise of the boiling water you happen to hear also
the roar of an airplane passing by. At ﬁrst, just for one instant, there are only two
bare auditory frequencies, but right afterwards the thinking mind identiﬁes their
different sources as ‘boiling water’ and ‘airplane’. Then you would probably think:
“The sound of the boiling water is closer to me than the sound of the airplane”.
Is that statement really true?
It is, if the word ‘me’ means ‘my body’ and the word ‘sound’ means ‘the source
of the sound’: quite obviously the boiling water is closer to my body than the far
airplane, since all the distances between objects that are located in space can be
precisely measured.
But what about the distance between each object and space? Can an object be
closer to space than another one? Indeed, we should say that the distance between
any object and space amounts to zero.
Likewise, getting back to the above-mentioned sentence (“The sound of the
boiling water is closer to me than the sound of the airplane”), if the word ‘me’
means ‘my consciousness’ and the word ‘sound’ means a bare auditory perception,
how can we assert that one hearing perception is closer to consciousness than
another one, since both of them appear in and as consciousness? Just as each
localized object is at a zero distance from space, so the distance between any
perception and consciousness amounts to zero as well ([12], 68).
In the Indian philosophical tradition of advaita-vedãnta, the relation between the
body-mind organism and consciousness is often elucidated by the metaphoric
image of a vase (symbolizing the mind-body organism), from which the thinking
mind easily gets the odd notion that the space ‘inside’ it (the individual con-
sciousness) is separate from the space outside, and that only when the vase cracks
open, the space inside will join up with the space outside.
However, space cannot actually split into separate parts: there are not two spaces
(one inside the vase and another outside it), but rather one and the same indivisible
space incorporates the vase itself. The very notion of a space ‘inside’ the vase is
unsuitable, since it is not so much the space to be in the vase, as the vase to be
totally immersed in space.
Strangely enough, if we rely exclusively on our direct experience rather than on
thought, there is no evidence whatsoever that consciousness should abide inside the
body-mind organism: on the contrary, all the thoughts that we call ‘mind’, all the
physical sensations that we call ‘body’ and all the perceptions that we call ‘external
world’ appear inside the ‘awake space’ that we call ‘consciousness’, and no aspect
whatsoever of reality can arise outside it [1, 12].
From a phenomenological perspective, space appears changeless, and this is the
reason why it can allow any movement or change of the localized objects that arise
and pass away in it. Here the similarity between space and consciousness is quite
close. Time is the measure of change: what we usually call ‘time’ is just a
29
The Consciousness of Space, the Space of Consciousness
367

conventional tool for our thought to ‘translate’ change into numbers. Actually in
our direct experience we do not perceive seconds, hours or years, but only
movement and change. However, to notice change, consciousness must be steady,
as any movement requires a constant background in order to be detected.
For example, when an itch appears for a few seconds, to note the beginning of
the itch, consciousness must be there both before and after its arising, while to note
the end of the itch, consciousness must be there both before and after its passing
away. So in our experience consciousness as such is the changeless background that
allows any perception of movement measured by time. This phenomenological
observation could suggest an intriguing philosophical hypothesis: that the very
perception of time implies a timeless consciousness as an immutable background,
since it is not consciousness to be in time, but rather it is time to appear in
consciousness.
This sheds some light on the question, whether consciousness exists only in
instantaneous ﬂashes, or whether instead is having a continuity. This problem is in
fact linked to the relation between consciousness and time. If one would accept the
view that consciousness lives in time, then the above-mentioned question about
continuous vs. discrete mode of being would have a raison d’être. But if we instead
consider that it is time that lives in consciousness—time as a ‘content’ of
consciousness—then the above question is no longer arguable.
In our experience, indeed, consciousness as such is always here and now, but it
is not localized in space and time, because the ‘here’ of consciousness incorporates
any possible ‘there’, and the ‘now’ of consciousness includes all the thoughts about
past and future: here the word-play between ‘no-where’ and ‘now-here’ is quite
appropriate.
The simile between space and consciousness reaches its limit when considering
that space itself, though not localized, is still an object which consciousness can be
aware of: therefore consciousness encompasses even space, putting an end to the
analogy between them.
When still using the metaphor of space, we could say that consciousness is the
‘aware space’ that ‘contains’ every experience. But, if even space appears only in
and as consciousness, then actually consciousness, far from being a ‘container’ (as
the container/content relationship still implies the metaphor of space), is rather the
intrinsic essence of experience, namely the ‘ﬁrst person aliveness’ that permeates it:
as such, consciousness is a sort of ‘singularity’ without any extension in space or
time.
Unlike space, consciousness cannot be perceived as an object, and here lies its
paradoxical mystery: on the one hand its evidence is undeniable for the very fact
that we are aware of objects, on the other hand it is utterly unknowable, just as the
eye cannot see itself, but its existence is undeniable for the very fact that we can see
objects.
So, at the end of our short inquiry into what we call ‘consciousness’, we are
ultimately confronted with the unknown ‘bottom line’ of any human knowledge.

Abstract At times, people feel something which they would describe as “time
pressure”. But is time really a substance which could put pressure on us? I shall
argue that it is not and that indeed a philosophical revisionism is sought for in this
context; namely the avoidance of the permanent use of such false physical and
economic metaphors like “time pressure”, “time costs”, “loss of time”. Having said
that, the real phenomenon underlying this metaphorical talk is a discrepancy or
dissonance between different time scales: the individual time scale of a person as
structured by her intentions, aims, and goals; and an objective time scale or
intersubjective time scale as structured by (natural or social) events of the world
around her. I will argue that also the so-named “fear of death”—that is, the suffering
resulting from the worry about one’s ﬁnitude—can be classiﬁed as a special type of
such a dissonance; namely as an irreversible dissonance or desynchronization based
on the overall stoppage of one’s individual time. This stoppage, in turn, will be
characterised as the termination point of the ever new and tensed division or
divergence between what is experienced as happening now and as being just past.
Towards the end of the paper I will come back to the question of a philosophical
revisionism—that is, to the cases where discrepancies or dissonances between
individual time and intersubjective time do allow for a “re-synchronization” and,
thus, for an avoidance of suffering.

Introduction: Sufferings and Time Scales
Time can make one suffer. On a general level, one might realise one’s own ﬁnitude
and one might suffer from the fact that there are good inductive reasons to suppose
that the world around will carry on after one’s death. On a more everyday level, one
may suffer from what is often described as “stress” and “time pressure”: myriads of

appointments, deadlines, commitments keeping one busy to an unhealthy extent. In
what follows I will analyse the origins of these two kinds of individual suffering.
(I use the term “individual suffering” because it is related to personal life-worldly
limitations and has to be distinguished from a notion of formal suffering, as related
to the human capacity of receptiveness quite generally, and from a notion of social
suffering, as resulting from shared traumatic experiences of a whole community; cf.
[19, 22]).
Apart from analysing the origins of these time-induced sufferings, I will attempt
to answer the question whether or to what extent they can be avoided or overcome
—that is, I will look at the possibilities and limits of a philosophical revisionism
regarding our awareness and understanding of time.
In order to explicate these phenomena in an adequate fashion, it is helpful to ﬁrst
distinguish between different time scales. Generally speaking, time is a fundamental
dimension of the world we live in. Given that there are different ways in which we
encounter this world, there are also different ways in which one may ascribe a
temporal order to (the objects of) these encounters (cf. [20, 21]). One obvious way
to give a temporal order to events or things is by means of clocks—that is, by
ordering them in relation to periodical physical processes and, thus, by what one
might call physical or “objective” time. Not determined by clocks, but given by the
way we experience the enduring presence and absence of things, is a different time
scale, namely “individual time”. This second time scale might also be described as
“time as perceived” (by an individual subject) and is to be distinguished from a
third scale which might be called “intersubjective” time and which governs our
daily social life—that is, our interaction with others.
All three time scales—physical, individual, and intersubjective—are experienced
as real and usually we are not aware of any dissonances or discrepancies between
them. In fact, the true core of expressions such as “time pressure” is related to the
(unusual or pathological) case of experiencing such a discrepancy or dissonance.
However, before explicating this “true core”, let me start by explaining why
expressions such as “time pressure” and “time costs” are indeed misleading and
might themselves intensify a potential suffering.
30.2
Overcoming False Metaphors Regarding Time
As already mentioned, time is a fundamental dimension of the world, but time is not
a substance. We experience ourselves as living in time (both physically as well as
mentally), but time, especially physical time, is nothing one could collect, gather or
accumulate. Even though this point might seem trivial, it is important to emphasise
that time is not a material or economic resource. It is important because a lot of
contemporary talk about time works as if time was such a resource and because a lot
of suffering is related to taking these false metaphors seriously.
372
N. Sieroka

Given that time is not a material substance, time cannot put pressure on
something or someone. Similarly, there can be no “lack of time” in any literal sense.
Every day lasts 24 h and no day has a leak through which some of these 24 h might
seep away. By the same token, time is not like money. To speak of “time savings”
and “time costs” is to employ bad metaphors, for there is no way in which one
might, for instance, salt away a couple of minutes on Tuesday to then withdraw
them on Saturday.
This is not to deny that there are real phenomena related to the use of expressions
like “time pressure” and “time costs”. But these real phenomena are related to the
durations and relative arrangements of actions and events (and I will come back to
this in more detail below). At this point I merely want to emphasise that this talk
about time itself being a material and economic substance or resource is misleading
in a systematic fashion. It suggests that there are issues with time itself whereas the
issues are really about us and about our organisation of events in time. Today as
well as yesterday and tomorrow we have “all the time in the world”, as it were—
that is, 24 h a day. No more, no less. But as soon as one starts to think that time
works like money, one might start to shove more and more appointments into one’s
datebook because this seems similar to being rich and important. However, whereas
a wallet might indeed stretch as I become richer and put more and more coins and
banknotes into it, a day does not do anything similar … and instead of becoming
rich I merely start being stressed out.
This example might sufﬁce to illustrate how such economic metaphors can have
a negative inﬂuence on human life by decreasing one’s overall well-being.
Accordingly, one would do better by avoiding or revising the use of such meta-
phors. This might be a ﬁrst and indeed important goal of philosophical inquiries
about time: to reveal bad metaphors and to encourage and help overcoming them.
Of course, it is by no means a new idea that a central aim of philosophy is to do
revisionary work on metaphors—this has been argued for in various other contexts
by, for instance, Nietzsche [16] and, more recently, by Lakoff and Johnson [12].
This kind of revisionism, however, can only be a ﬁrst step. Even if one suc-
cessfully overcomes all material and economic metaphors regarding time, one
might still feel some kind of temporal disquietness or urgency. So let me explicate
this urgency more precisely and relate it more speciﬁcally to the different times
scales mentioned above.
30.3
Desynchronized Time Scales
The (temporal) relations on the individual time scale are fundamentally tensed. We
experience things to happen now, we remember certain events to have happened in
the past, and we anticipate certain things to occur in the future. That is, the temporal
order of our immediate encounter with the world is ordered in tensed terms of
30

373

“being present”, “being (more or less) past”, or “being (more or less) future”. In
contrast, objective or physical time is usually described in tenseless terms. That is,
the fundamental ordering relation here is that of “being earlier” or “being later”.
There is a long and ongoing debate about which kind of temporal ordering is
more fundamental on a metaphysical level: the tensed or the tenseless one? This
debate was triggered largely by McTaggart [13] and recent advocates of tenseless
and tensed views include Mellor [14] and Bourne [4], respectively. In any case,
what is important in the present context is the fact that even those philosophers who
defend a tenseless view on the metaphysical level admit that our experiences come
in a tensed order and that there is something like the inescapable presence of
experience (see, e.g., [14]).
When it comes to everyday life, actually both kinds of temporal orderings,
tensed and tenseless, are important. Tenseless orderings are particularly important
for making appointments with friends, authorities, medical practitioners, etc.
Calling my dentist’s ofﬁce, I will arrange for an appointment on April 25th at 8 a.
m., say. And I will talk about this appointment with the receptionist in exactly those
tenseless terms: “April 25th at 8 a.m.”. Our conversation will not include tensed
classiﬁcations about the appointment—that is, there will be no phrasings such as “in
thirty-seven days, twenty-one hours and sixteen minutes from now” … and one
obvious reason for avoiding such tensed talk is that we would have to permanently
update this talk every passing minute.
In contrast, tensed orderings are particularly important in situations where an
immediate action is in demand. To take a simple example: if I intend to cross the
street it is extremely important for me to realise that the black SUV is approaching
me from the left right now … whereas, at that very moment, the tenseless classiﬁ-
cation of the looming accident (i.e. whether it is 3:13 p.m. or 3:16 p.m., say) appears
irrelevant. Similarly, also the (tensed) difference between being past and being future
is relevant in everyday life and makes a huge difference regarding suffering and
overall well-being. Usually we prefer good things to happen in the future rather than
the past, whereas the opposite holds true for adverse events. Parﬁt [17] calls this the
“bias towards the future” and an, again simple, example might be my painful visit at
the dentist which, if I had the choice, I would prefer to have already happened in the
past instead of being the ﬁrst thing to happen tomorrow morning.
To sum up and to relate things to the terminology from above: tensed orderings
are fundamental to what I have called the individual time scale, whereas tenseless
ordering relations provide the basis for what I have called the intersubjective time
scale and the physical (objective) time scale. Note that this is not to claim that
intersubjective time and physical time are the same (cf. [21]). However, at this point
nothing much hinges on this difference. In fact, the “true core” of those afore-
mentioned bad metaphors such as “time pressure” can be uncovered independently
from that distinction.
374
N. Sieroka

What really happens in cases where people claim to be under (temporal) pressure
is a desynchronization between one’s individual time and the time of one’s envi-
ronment; whereby “environment” might refer either to the social reality, and hence
to intersubjective time, or to nature, and hence to physical time. Due to an
upcoming storm-front a ﬁsherman might have to hurry up in order to reach the coast
“in good time”. However, it is not that physical time would put pressure on him.
The concern is about the rhythm of his individual actions in relation to physical
time. And even if there is no upcoming storm: the ﬁsherman still needs to be
synchronized with certain natural rhythms such as given by the cycle of day and
night or maybe the tides.
Structurally, the same holds true for the relation between individual time and
intersubjective time. There is no pressure originating from intersubjective time
itself. Again, the problems of an alleged “time pressure” arise from desynchro-
nization (see [2]). More precisely, the desynchronization is a “running after” of the
individual time: I feel “under pressure” because the others around me are all ahead
of me. As a simple example: having lunch with my colleagues and realizing that I
am the only one who hasn’t ﬁnished his pasta yet makes me feel uncomfortable and
I start to wolf down my pasta because I know that everyone would like to return to
work as soon as possible. This feeling might indeed be described as a kind of social
pressure. However, just to reemphasise this point, this feeling results from a dis-
crepancy or mismatch between my expectations and actions as compared to my
colleagues’ expectations and actions—it is by no means time itself (neither indi-
vidual nor intersubjective time) which is pushing me.
Of course, the pasta example is “harmless” in the sense that one would hardly
speak of a case of (severe) suffering. However, things come in degree here and the
general mechanism is always the same. A repeated or even continuous running
behind of my individual time, as compared to intersubjective time, makes me feel
that I am always too late, that all the important things happen ahead of me, and all
the important decisions are made before I made up my mind. It is for this reason
that scholars from philosophy and psychopathology identify this (pathological) case
of desynchronization between individual time and intersubjective time with
depression (see [7, 24]).
In turn, the pathological occurrence of the opposed desynchronization—that is,
the case in which one’s individual time is permanently ahead of the intersubjective
time—has been identiﬁed with mania (cf. again [7, 24]). So mania is the patho-
logical case of what might start out as a kind of boredom. To use the above example
again: this time I am faster at lunch than my colleagues are and now I am bored
because I have to wait for them to ﬁnish their pasta. Next, my boredom might
change to impatience and then I might become fussy, calling the waiter, carelessly
ﬂicking through the newspaper from the next table, doing a quick call on my cell
phone, starting to agitate my colleagues, counting the cash in my wallet, calling the
waiter again, getting my jacket, doing another quick phone call, etc.
30

375

It is not my point whether this characterisation in terms of doing a lot of
unrelated short-term actions is the correct way to describe the borderline between
agitation and mania (for more details cf. [1, 8, 22]). My aim is simply to illustrate
the fact that both types of desynchronization between individual time and inter-
subjective time can lead to suffering.
30.4
Re-synchronization and Escapism
If the explication from Sect. 30.3 is correct, then it is obvious what a revisionism
has to aim for in order to escape from boredom, impatience, and agitation on the
one hand and stress, grief, and depressiveness on the other: namely to overcome the
desynchronization between individual time and intersubjective time. Here two
broad strategies might come to mind and might be adopted.
First, one might aim at a direct re-synchronization of the two times involved. In
the contemporary literature this has been described as a return to the “virtue of
patience” [7]. Here “patience” does not mean that one simply “waits”. Instead it
means that one feels in accordance—or for that matter: “in resonance”—with one’s
social environment. The aim is to re-achieve a kind of common rhythm in which to
experience the world and the interaction with the people around.
Second, one might aim to overcome the desynchronization between individual
time and intersubjective time by trying to escape from the latter time scale alto-
gether. Surely, as soon as I care only about my individual time, there is no way in
which I could feel a desynchronization. Usually, however, such an escapism will
provide only a short-term solution to the problem. In daily life one depends very
much on other people and, in practice, one might “uncouple” from intersubjective
time only occasionally—maybe by doing meditations in which one forgets about
the world around one.
From a higher point of view, such a meditative uncoupling might also be viewed
as a special case of the ﬁrst strategy. Successful meditations are often described in
terms of an experience of an “eternal now” (cf. also [11]). The experienced present,
as it were, widens beyond all limits. That is, within one’s individual time there
aren’t any tensed distinctions left between events being more or less future or past.
All is experienced to be ordered in tenseless terms and hence no room is left for any
dissonance between subjective and intersubjective (or objective) time.
Various revisionist claims from the history of philosophy hint in a similar
direction. Some variant of the idea of an “eternal now” underlies, for instance,
Spinoza’s claim that (at least “under the dictates of reason”) we should ideally be
always “affected equally, whether the idea be of a thing future, past, or present”
([23]: 4p62). Or think of medieval mysticism and claims such as the following one
by Jacob Böhme ([3]: 20, my transl.): “He to whom time is like eternity, and
376
N. Sieroka

eternity is like time, is freed from all strife.” There is no space left for any kind of
dissonance or discrepancy because the present as experienced has become
all-embracing.
30.5
Finitude and Divergence
A further kind of time-induced or time-related suffering was mentioned at the very
beginning of this essay, namely the worry about one’s own ﬁnitude. This worry
might also be described as the “fear of death”, and its revisionist overcoming, or at
least some kind of adaptation, might be considered, once more, as a central aim of
philosophy. Ever since the days of Plato ([18]: 67e) it has been claimed that
philosophy is meant to help us in coping with our ﬁnitude and with the
inescapability of death. Quoting Montaigne ([15]: 179): “to philosophize is to learn
[how] to die”.
In the light of Sects. 30.3 and 30.4, this worry about one’s ﬁnitude might be
described as a variant of the desynchronization between intersubjective time and
individual time; namely as the fear of an irreversible desynchronization based on
the overall stoppage of one’s individual time. The coming into existence of ever
new and tensedly ordered individual experience supposedly stops, whereas the
intersubjective world of all those other people will continue without any serious
interruption. (Though this is not the topic of the present paper, it is worth men-
tioning that there also exists a complementary worry—namely about the stopping of
intersubjective time due to dramatic changes in the environment, such as through a
nuclear war or severe climate change.)
Thus, in order to explore possible revisionisms, it is important to better under-
stand the internal dynamics of individual time—that is, to better understand the
exact processes involved in the formation of experience and of its inescapable
presentness. The most fundamental characteristic or ingredient here is the ever new
falling-apart or the ever new (tensed) division between what is now and what is just
past. Kant [10] famously described this in terms of what he called the pure form of
inner intuition, Husserl [9] described and analysed it in terms of his concept of a
time halo, and Brouwer [5] termed this ever new divergence of past and present a
“two-oneness” and made it the cornerstone of his intuitionistic foundation of
mathematics.
Given the limited scope and length of this essay, I cannot go into much detail
here (see [21, 22] for that). But maybe I can motivate at least some important
connotations with the help of the following quote from Feuerbach [6]: “Where there
is no time, there is no individual; where there is no individual, there is no expe-
rience, and vice versa”. The claim is that, without time, there is nothing which is not
divisible; without time, there is nothing in-dividual. Or, to put it the other way
round and a little more precisely: where there is something that continuously falls
30
Time and Suffering: False Metaphors, (De)Synchronous Times …
377

apart—something that divides again and again—there is a tensed temporal order. In
fact, the German original makes this close relation obvious even on a verbal level,
since the German term for “experience” is Empﬁnden which derives from ent-
ﬁnden, where the latter means to ﬁnd oneself to be different, to be distinct, from
something. Thus, searching for a single noun describing the experience of a con-
tinuous process of falling-apart, once more words such as “di-vergence”,
“di-remption”, “di-chotomy” or “di-visiveness” might come to mind.
This leads back to the claim from the beginning of Sect. 30.3: individual time or
time as experienced is fundamentally tensed—and this tensedness is a consequence
of the ongoing divergences within this time scale. These scale-internal divergences
are not to be confused with the dissonances or discrepancies between different time
scales which induce suffering. Instead, these scale-internal divergences provide our
encounter with the world with a directedness and it is from here that the talk about
an “orientation” or “sense” of an individual life arises.
Returning to the worry about one’s ﬁnitude, the last question to address then is
that of a possible revisionism. How, if at all, might the fear of death be attenuated?
Some comfort might be gained occasionally by the aforementioned part-time
escapism of meditation. Further relief could be found in the, again previously
mentioned, Spinozist attempt to view all things tenselessly “under the dictates of
reason”—that is, to be affected equally, regardless of whether these things are past,
present or future.
Before criticising this Spinozist attempt, let me brieﬂy describe a related but
milder kind of revisionism—and then turn to a joint criticism afterwards. Instead of
suggesting that one should be equally affected by all things, Parﬁt [17] discusses a
kind of pointwise symmetrisation between the past and the future. That is, one
would aim to overcome the aforementioned bias towards the future and aim to be
equally affected by things which are, say, two weeks past and two weeks future.
(Thus, other than the Spinozist attempt, this Parﬁtian revisionism would still allow
for different attitudes towards what is, say, 5 h in the future in contrast to what is
5 years in the future.) Parﬁt suggests that this would attenuate the fear of death for
the following reason: since one does not fear the event of one’s birth or the time
before, there is then no reason to fear death or being dead.
However, one might object that the latter step in Parﬁt’s argumentation does not
necessarily follow. Even if one admits that such a symmetrisation of past and future
would be possible, it is not at all clear whether the lack of fearing one’s birth will
actually override one’s fear of death. Why might not the exact opposite happen?
Why might not the fear of death override one’s easiness with one’s origins and
thereby lead to an analogous “fear of birth”?
After all, both revisionisms, the Spinozist as well as the Parﬁtian, make very
high demands on human rationality. Even though these revisions may be realizable
“under the dictates of reason”, it seems questionable whether they will ever occur
“under the dictates of immediate experience (or intuition)”, as one might call it.
Fortunately, this is not bad news, since a full neglect or overcoming of the
378
N. Sieroka

differences between past, present, and future is not desirable anyway. For this
would dampen, if not abandon, experience as such, given that experience itself is
fundamentally tensed.
30.6
Conclusion
There are different types of time-induced suffering. First, there is a deceptive one
which has nothing to do with time itself but with the use of false metaphors. Then
there are different genuine (conceptually related) types of time-induced suffering:
stress, impatience, and fear of death. The ﬁrst two, stress and impatience (and their
pathological variants depression and mania), are related to the dissonance or
desynchronization between individual time and either intersubjective time or
physical time. Such desynchronizations are possible because the different time
scales have their individual periodic processes or their particular chains of events
which mark their individual “eigenzeit” (their proper or appropriate time scale).
Thus, what a philosophical revisionism has to seek, in order to avoid stress and
impatience, are strategies for re-synchronizing the different processes and time
scales involved.
The fear of death might be described as a more speciﬁc worry about the stoppage
of one’s individual time, about there being a termination point in one’s continuous
and tensed experience of a falling-apart of things (called “divergence” above). To
attenuate this, several strategies are on offer. First, based on beliefs about, for
instance, metempsychosis or maybe some other religious convictions, one might
simply negate the existence of such a stoppage. Second, and less radically, one
might aim at the aforementioned kind of short-term transcendence of one’s ﬁnitude
by means of the experience of an “eternal now”. Third, there are the aforementioned
attempts of turning humans into perfect rational agents which do not distinguish
between past, present, and future. And fourth, one might attenuate the upcoming
stoppage of one’s individual time by fostering and facilitating an ongoing kind of
“derivative existence” in intersubjective or physical time—for instance by writing
books and articles in order to make one’s ideas and thoughts survive or by having
children in order to also propagate one’s genes.
This is not claimed to be a complete list. The important point is just that, given
that human experience qua experience (ent-ﬁnden) is fundamentally tensed, there
seem to be two general ways in which to attenuate the fear of death: either one has
to deny that there is a stoppage of one’s individual time (ﬁrst strategy) or one has to
follow a rather indirect or short-term strategy. In the latter case (second to fourth
strategy) no full dissociation from the suffering from ﬁnitude can be gained … at
least not without giving up one’s existence as a conscious individual human being.

earlier draft of this paper.

Introduction: Two Bad Habits
I want to make it clear that I have no quarrel with most scientists, but even many
good scientists in general have developed some bad habits in dealing with time
during the last century. These habits are built into the practice of science, but do not
have much bearing on actual results or argumentation. Still, there is room for
discussion about how to think about the way even good science handles time and
temporal unfolding. But scientists in general have an even worse habit in dealing
with the relationship between genuinely scientiﬁc claims and patently unscientiﬁc
philosophical claims, well beyond the limits of the problem of time. It is the former
habit that is destroying our prospects for a greater scientiﬁc progress and I will
address it in this essay. The latter is destroying our public discourse regarding
science, especially in the area of evolutionary theory, and a word or two is due on
that score ﬁrst. As John C. Greene describes the situation:
This paper has beneﬁtted from the criticism of a number of people, and in no way does my
acknowledgement of their help imply their agreement with what I assert here. Joungbin Lim of
Troy University, Jim Shelton of the University of Central Arkansas, John Bickel of Mississippi
State University, and my friend and regular collaborator Gary L. Herstein all criticized an early
version of the paper. I have also beneﬁtted from the comments of the members of the Philosophy
and Biology Departments of Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, and must thank Greg Jesson and
Laura Mueller for arranging the opportunity to pass these ideas through their pleasant gauntlet.
A version of the paper was criticized in its late stages by Bogdan Ogrodnik and Łukasz Lamża,
to the great beneﬁt and improvement of the result.

The predominately deductive approach of the Greek philosophers, says [Ernst] Mayr,
“helped to raise questions which no one had asked before, it led to an ever more precise
formulation of these questions, and it thereby set the stage for a purely scientiﬁc approach
which ultimately replaced philosophizing.” At what point or period in history, one may ask,
did a purely scientiﬁc approach in either physics or biology replace philosophizing? When
Darwin stated that “as natural selection works only by and for the good of each being, all
corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress toward perfection,” was he writing
as a scientist or as a philosopher or as an evolutionary theist?1
Wanting a pure science that replaces philosophizing and having it are two different
things. No one is well served when we pretend, to the public or among ourselves,
that we possess a kind of knowledge and understanding we simply do not have.
Scientists themselves cannot afford to let charlatans like Richard Dawkins (who
now apparently believes himself a competent theologian as well as a philosopher)
run amuck in the public sphere, misrepresenting the important work that science
does. It is time that scientists disavowed car magnets showing ﬁsh with feet and
“Darwin Loves You” bumper stickers.
31.2
Time Won’t Give Me Time
Formal modeling in evolutionary science, such as Ernst Mayr developed in the
early 1940s, and Francis Crick brought with him from his study of physics to the
DNA project, has removed our thinking from immediate observation and direct
(unmediated) application. To reason upon a formal model is to risk making errors
that may not be either self-correcting or even discoverable within the conﬁnes of the
model and the thinking done upon it as a hypothesis about the world. The reason we
take these risks in reasoning (through the creation, adaptation, and rearrangement of
formal models) is that the payoffs have been great in the past and there is reason to
expect more such “progress” in the future. (This assumes that payoff, in terms of
greater control, is progress—an assumption I would question.2) But treating time as
a divisible sequence, T1, T2, … Tn, on a graph (or the like) is, after all, not time at
all. It is a spatialization more closely akin to a wall calendar than even to a
grandfather clock. It is a risky formalization of a ﬂux that may not yield its core to
such a habit of division.

Biology.

Greene and Mayr. See Debating Darwin, chs. 2 and 8–11.

The problem of time in modern science traces back to the days of the ﬁrst
improved chronometers. The ancient world had believed in the immutability and
cyclical character of the structures of nature. But the engagement of scientists with
the ﬂux, as the Renaissance began, was renewed, and with consequences that have
been both enabling and crippling ever since that time. Greene says:
What, then, brought about the gradual erosion of belief in the absolute stability of the basic
structures of nature, species included? Scientiﬁc observations—Tycho Brahe’s new star, the
discovery of extinct volcanoes in the Auvergne region of France, the growing awareness of
fossil remains of organisms apparently no longer extant—played their part, but they were
not sufﬁcient in and of themselves to overthrow the dominant belief in stability. The
scientists themselves found ways of explaining away or sweeping under the rug these
inconvenient evidences of universal mutability. Something more was needed to accomplish
the overthrow of established belief. What was needed was an alternative conception of
nature, which, if pushed to its speculative limits, could make sense of these anomalous
facts.3
The reigning dogmas today in both evolutionary theory (neo-Darwinism) and
physics (the so-called Standard Model of Gravitational Cosmology, i.e., Einstein’s
Spinozistic universe) are cases of scientists still clinging to the stability view. Most
philosophers are just as bad about propagating this unempirical, unscientiﬁc view.
Progress in thought and in science requires that responsible scientists and
philosophers overthrow that dogma. We are in possession of some ideas that help in
framing an alternative, more empirical, and more promising conception of nature.
These alternatives are very serious (even perennial) philosophical ideas and they
will not go away. One day they will possess the whole vineyard of human thought
and we shall make better wine.
In the meantime, the inertia and dullness of the scientiﬁc journalists as they lead,
by the nose, an impressionable but impatient public imagination, is complemented
rather nicely by the evangelism of reductionist throwbacks like Dawkins and E.O.
Wilson—and Hawking, and all the rest who are still dreaming crypto-theological
dreams of a nature governed by “laws,” or mathematical order, whatever that may
mean. But what these laws or regularities or patterns (or whatever other cluster of a
priori concepts they land upon) can possibly be, these dogmatists won’t allow a
philosopher even to comment upon, these days. To be allowed through the door-
way, philosophers must sign a tacit non-aggression pact, or preferably behave like
the sycophants of science who just weren’t quite smart enough to become scientists

themselves (this is the way Hawking speaks of the philosophers, in any case).
Overcoming this anti-intellectual dogma and rejoining spatialized thought (i.e., the
results of formal modeling) to experienced and unexperienced time is even trickier
than I have indicated, since it isn’t clear what can be meant by a “new” concept of
nature.4 I will offer an approach, but ﬁrst I have to describe what time is.5
4I will not here go into a critique of the received approaches to formal models of time, but I will
say that the classic book by Michael Friedman captures well the habits of inquiry of these “normal
scientists” and well summarizes the formal models of time favored by contemporary physics, as
well as their development after Einstein. These have not changed in any signiﬁcant way since the
book appeared, but the whole paradigm of inquiry is currently under serious attack and is, in my
view, collapsing under the weight of incoherencies that it always had. See Michael Friedman,
Foundations of Space-Time Theories: Relativistic Physics and the Philosophy of Science
(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1983). See esp. pp. 309–320 for a summary of the
simultaneity problem raised by Minkowski space and its relation to the conventionality thesis of
Reichenbach. I believe this part of the received formalizations is effectively destroyed by the recent
book by Canales, The Physicist and the Philosopher (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015).
One aspect Canales documents thoroughly was the conscious effort on the part of Einstein and
Minkowski to suppress questions they could not answer, a practice carried forward by Hans
Reichenbach to philosophy in the USA when he immigrated. It is his theories, and the formal
models they embrace, that Friedman concentrates on in his book. But Friedman recognizes the
limitations and describes them well. In addition, see Friedman pp. 317–320 for the real gremlin in
the space-time model of general relativity. Friedman says:
The central problem for both Reichenbach and [Adolf] Grünbaum [who have defended
Einstein’s approach by appealing to conventionalism as the way to understand measure-
ment], then, is that the standard simultaneity relation is much more intimately connected
with the rest of the geometrical structure of Minkowski space-time than they have realized.
In particular, they have not seen that the standard simultaneity relation is an integral part of
the conformal structure of Minkowski space-time. (p. 320)
Friedman is too kind here. I think these philosophers knew very well that the measurement
problem of cosmology went right to the heart of the assumptions of general relativity and its
spatialization of time. They simply buried this problem in modeling it. People were impressed with
the math and were willing to say “close enough,” completely ignoring the fundamental assump-
tions. Canales shows this in historical detail in her book, and Gary L. Herstein shows the structural
and philosophical problems with the standard model of space-time cosmology in his book
Whitehead and the Measurement Problem of Cosmology (Frankfort am Mein: Ontos Verlag,
2006). Unfortunately, the otherwise impressive looking work of Reichenbach, and Einstein’s other
minions, bequeathed to the world of physics and scientiﬁc journalism, and eventually to the life
sciences through former physicists such as Francis Crick, habits of modeling and of thinking about
models that have been nothing short of disastrous for honest inquiry. The disciplines dependent
upon a deep understanding of time have been in the grips of an ideology about the relation of time
to space for almost a century.
5It may be that my sketch here will have signiﬁcant overlap with the current project of John Dupré
at the University of Exeter. From the description available of his current grant, it would appear that
his concerns and sources are quite similar to mine as regards the constructive parts of this paper.

31.3
The Flux
I don’t believe anything in the description I will now provide is seriously debatable,
at least among those willing to be guided by common sense. The fact that my
description runs counter to the prevailing ideology associated with space-time in
physics is not of serious concern, to me at least. The current ideology is both
anti-philosophical and sub-philosophical, and yet depends up patently philosophical
(as opposed to scientiﬁc) assertions. That it has persisted for so long is a testament
to the narrowness of mind and sometimes intellectual dishonesty of those who are
willing to do almost anything rather than acknowledge the legitimate role of
experience as had by humans in modeling the physical world.6
I do not claim my description is perfect or beyond improving, but the basic
points seem to me unavoidable. The basics are built from the philosophies of
Bergson and Whitehead, although I believe my description is developed and
elaborated in ways they did not consider.7 Nor does accepting their ideas wholesale
ﬁgure into what I will say. That is not a requirement, but common sense is. Having
provided this description, I will set out a procedure for formalizing it, in the
broadest sense, that aims to include all the valuable results of past inquiry and to
enable scientists and (I hope) the scientiﬁc journalists, philosophers of science, and
the public to set aside the destructive and needless debates about evolution and time
that contribute nothing to our understanding and much to our unhappiness.
Time is a variable ﬂux. It is not a homogeneous medium “in” which events occur. It
is also not a fourth “dimension.” That is a model. Yes, time is treated as a homo-
geneous medium by those who have already conceptualized, and hence, spatialized
time for the purpose of thinking about it and reﬂecting upon what they have thought.
This treatment is often valuable, but it is only one model and not useful for every
purpose, and indeed, for none beyond a few fairly narrow pursuits within science.
Such models are removed from our actual experience of the passage of time, which is
varied and complex. Yet, the ubiquitous and most damaging assumption made about
time by most scientists (and many philosophers) is that thinking about time (in one of
these spatialized senses) and thinking about the ﬂux are commensurable, either in
terms of a temporal unit of some sort, from the vague “event” to the precise
“nanosecond,” or in terms of a homogeneous medium which will support the seamless
application of closely observed spatialized relations to the ﬂux itself.
6One could spend a good deal of time arguing whether human experience is or is not relevant to a
scientiﬁc conception of time. The claim is a red herring. There is no scientiﬁc conception of time
that is not dependent upon a group of philosophical ideas and assumptions, and these are, man-
ifestly, thoroughly human. The human experience of time is not all there is to time, surely, but
what we experience as temporal change cannot be wisely or even reasonably excluded from the
consideration of scientiﬁc time. See, for example, Charles M. Sherover, in his headers and footers
to The Human Experience of Time (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999).
7A scholarly problem in combining Whitehead’s and Bergson’s ideas is addressed in my article
“Inﬂuence as Conﬂuence: Bergson and Whitehead,” Process Studies, in the special focus section
on “Bergson and Whitehead,” 28:3–4 (Fall/Winter 1999), 267; 301–338; 339–345.

Evolutionary Time and the Creation of the Space of Life
385

The former approach, using units, however vague or precise, is a crypto-
metaphysical atomism, and the latter, “homogeneous medium” view is a
crypto-metaphysical monism. Both are unempirical and have religious hangovers
from the days in which we believed nature was a stable domain of laws. Still, both
atomism and monism “work” as base assumptions for purposive formal modeling,
within limits. The limits are established by the assumptions made in conceptualizing
time. Concepts imply limitation and determination of the phenomena subsumed
under them. These limits and simpliﬁcations, imposed for the sake of thinking,
exclude much that might be considered important about the concrete reality of time,
whatever it is. Concepts of time are thus radical reductions of the ﬂux.
Thinking about time, conceptualizing that activity of thinking, and then reﬂecting
on the results of such conceptualization is a complex and fallible process. Not all of
the structure of thinking is captured and preserved in the result of thinking, the
“thought.” Not all of the thought is preserved in reﬂection upon the thought. The
cognitive operations we can carry out in reﬂection are different, and indeed exhibit
different structures, than those we carry out in the process of thinking.8 By the time we
make the decision to introduce a “unit” of measure to carry us from reﬂection back
through thinking and into the ﬂux, we have engaged in radical, fallible reduction at
least four times (experiencing to thinking, thinking to thought, thought to reﬂecting
upon thought, and results of reﬂection to modeling), and then we ignore the accu-
mulated hazards and assert the accuracy of our models. The model, even if poorly
made, certainly has a constructive and positive relation to the ﬂux, to be sure, and a
range of applicability, in all likelihood, but it is not anything like time as experienced.
It is a created space—indeed, it is a thrice-spatialized and reduced product of
reﬂection. Such is the nature of, for example, the “minute,” or “hour,” and certainly
the “nanosecond.” No one has ever experienced such a unit in the ﬂux and no one ever
will. Whitehead rightly argues that when we transpose efﬁcacious process into pre-
sented space, we always make an “error.” But error is the price of creative advance.
Presentational spaces are the ground of such creativity.9
8Kant’s distinction between determinate and reﬂective judgment, in judgment’s logical function, is
just one example of the different structures, but at the very least, in some cases, thinking begins in
the particular and searches for generals and universals that will ﬁt the experience. In other cases,
we begin with generals or universals and seek particulars that are subsumed under these concepts.
The structures are quite different. See Kant, Critique of Judgment, trans. Werner Pluhar
(Indianapolis: Hackett, 1983), First Introduction.
9See Whitehead, Process and Reality, corrected ed. by D. Sherburne and D.R. Grifﬁn (New York:
Free Press, 1978), pp. 83–129, 168–183, 208–217. The presentational space we create from the
causally efﬁcacious transition underway, the “ﬂux,” is a symbol of that ﬂux. It is analogous to the
ﬂux, but is more stable, obviously, and captures enough of the ﬂux to be useful, at the price of
error. But its creation is “creativity” par excellence. Following Whitehead, Susanne Langer says:
There is a profound difference between using symbols and merely using signs. The use of
signs is the ﬁrst manifestation of mind. It arises early in biological history as the famous
“conditioned reﬂex,” by which a concomitant of a stimulus takes over the stimulus func-
tion. The concomitant becomes sign of the condition to which the reaction is really
appropriate. This is the real beginning of mentality, for here is the birthplace of error, and
386

There are temporal units that are less arbitrary than minutes and nanoseconds.
The “day,” for example, has two fundamental, empirical meanings. One is the
product of reﬂection—24 h and a bit more, as adjusted (as often as needed) for the
small variations in the speed of the earth’s rotation. The other meaning is, roughly,
“and there was evening and there was morning, one day,” to put it in the familiar
language of Scripture. Obviously this varies by season and latitude. Interestingly,
the religious meaning is also closer to the ﬂux. Every human being has experienced
this latter as a transition and as a schema (a thought). The more precise offerings, by
contrast, are reduced and corrected and subjugated to an abstract unit. Human
beings began experiencing reﬂective “minutes” only after the clock was devised.
Before that, it would better be named a “moment.” Both descriptions of a “day”
work, in general, and the abstract version will work better for purposes that require
greater accuracy, such as global day trading and science. The less reﬂectively
mediated version of a “day” will work for knowing when to begin the Sabbath or
when to come in from the golf course. Both versions are artifacts of human
thinking. Some organic beings have “days” while others really don’t—sea creatures
living a mile beneath the surface, or mosses that grow only in dark caves, and so
forth, don’t really have “days.”
There is no reason to become an absolutist about the “day” as a unit of time,
even though it is so generally applicable to life on earth. Nor is there any basis for
becoming intellectually wedded to any other “unit” of time. No matter how well
grounded the unit may be in the regularities we can discern in the ﬂux, there is
always more to the ﬂux than our discernments, in sense experience, in intuition, in
perception, in thinking, or in reﬂection. Our bodies are not suited to the discernment
of all of the temporal patterns in the ﬂux.10 We have, by indirect means, become
(Footnote 9 continued)
therewith, of truth. If truth and error are to be attributed only to belief, then we must
recognize in the earliest misuse of signs, in the inappropriate conditioned reﬂex, not error,
but some prototype of error. We might call it a mistake. Every piano player, every typist
knows that the hand can make mistakes where consciousness entertains no error…. The use
of signs is certainly a mental function.
Langer, Philosophy in a New Key, 3rd edition (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,
1957 [1942]), p. 29. (Langer dedicated this book to Whitehead.) Langer’s ideas come close to a
highly empirical morphological theory. Although I will not be able to discuss it here, it is worth
noting that botanists, as distinct from zoologists, have long discussed and often favored
morphological ideas that follow a different historical course, from Goethe through Schleiden and
into the present; see the work of, for example, the Polish dendrologist Paweł Kojs (a list of papers
is here: https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=eAU98osAAAAJ&hl=pl).
These are, in my view, non-Darwinian evolutionary ideas, and the public and even the sci-
entiﬁc community has been so focused.
10I go into some detail about how our bodied deal with the ﬂux in “In Vino Veritas,” in Southwest
Philosophy Review, 30:1 (January 2014), 39–66; and “Image and Act: Bergson’s Ontology and
Aesthetics,” in Sztuka i Filozoﬁa/Art and Philosophy, 45 (2014), 64–81.

aware of patterns of change in the ﬂux that have both greater regularity (pulsars, the
decay of radioactive isotopes, etc.) than our bodies can conﬁrm, on their own, and
also we have become aware of aspects of the cosmos that currently have no ob-
servable pattern of regularity, even with our most developed instruments of
mediation (empty space, black holes, and other unthinkables). Our bodies are
unsuited to thinking about nothingness, but we must remember that nothingness
cannot mean more than “nothing to us.”11
Our instruments of mediation do make available to our bodies aspects of the
cosmic order that we couldn’t otherwise perceive, but there is no warrant in
imagining that what our instruments, from super-conducting super-colliders to
magnifying glasses, deliver to us the whole ﬂux. Whether the ﬂux is a plenum or
whether there is a universal medium of some sort is a question about whether there
is “something” that is “nothing to us.” It s not a scientiﬁc question and will never
become one, no matter how much of the ﬂux we manage to draw into our thinking
by use of indirect instruments. But the answer is “yes.” Things do exist that are
nothing to us. When we consider the ﬂux as an idea about the cosmos, we have to
acknowledge that the idea of the ﬂux is inexhaustible. It can be conceptualized and
reduced in inﬁnitely many ways, but the idea itself, as a response to the very real
results of our careful observations, thinking, and reﬂecting, should be general
enough to keep us all, and scientists especially, constantly in mind of the fact that
we don’t know all there is to know, and even if we did, and had reached the
completion of human knowing, more would exist than we know, because knowing
is a reduction of the real to those parts we can ﬁt into a knowledge scheme,
developed according to a method or methods, no matter how broadly conceived and
applied.
Now, granting that my idea of the ﬂux is not the ﬂux itself, I still believe that a
constructive, careful, scientiﬁcally valuable description of time can be offered to
those who have settled for either the monistic or the atomistic picture of the
applicability of some unit or common medium across reﬂecting, thinking, per-
ceiving, intuiting, sensing, and acting. Both the monistic and the atomistic
approaches habitually ignore the precognitive experience of time and both exhibit
no curiosity about the ﬂux, or even the idea of the ﬂux, and whether there may be
structure in the ﬂux that is intelligible but, as yet, unthought. Instead, the entrenched
defenders of one approach or the other dig in their heels and insist upon the
sufﬁciency, even the sole sufﬁciency in the case of the most ideological individuals,
of their units and models. The arrogance is unbecoming of science, and many
scientists do not participate, but the loudest and most noxious among them hold
forth without surcease, especially to the scientiﬁc journalists who will convey their
pontiﬁcations to the masses, and these prolix prattlers are not mufﬂed by the more
humble majority of scientists.

31.4
Overlapping Temporal Modalities
The ﬂux is, at the very least, highly variable in its temporal modalities.12 This is not
debatable. Relative to our bodily capacity, we could say, without great distortion,
that these differing, variable realities within the ﬂux exist at different “speeds” or
“velocities.” When we assert this, we use our bodily capacities (including thinking),
and their limitations (including whatever goes unthought), as a unit-marker for what
we take to be a more varied ﬂux than we can actively use or even know about. Our
bodies are, after all, in the world, and as actual as anything else we might use as a
measure. Some particles, such as neutrinos, which travel either near the speed of
light, or faster than light, depending on whom you listen to, have no observable
effect on our bodies, since they leave no energistic traces. It seems that this sort of
particle exists without being experienced in any meaningful sense.
Taking ionizing radiation as an example of experienced particles, we ﬁnd other
particles, such as alpha and beta particles, passing through without our being able to
perceive them, but with some effect upon our bodies (hence, “experienced”). Yes,
we do gradually sense ultra-violet light, for example, by its tendency to cook us, but
still without perceiving it. But the point is that the ﬂux has variable modalities that
interact differently with the human body, making the ﬂux variably relevant. This
process is well described by Ogrodnik applying Feynman to the physical situation:
We can say metaphorically that quantum interference is a special kind of entanglement of
many ‘ﬁbers’, which constitute the subtle ‘tissue’ of reality. If an action in a region is
stationary then there is a constructive interference and the particle runs through the region
along an almost classical trajectory in conformity with the principle of least action. If the
action is non-stationary in a given region, then we obtain a very complicated pattern of
presence for the particle in the region.13
12The best formal description I know of regarding this is Feynman, et al., 1965, summarized by the
physicist Bogdan Ogrodnik in this way:
In classical mechanics, a particle moves along the trajectory on which a variation of action
reaches the minimum. The particle does not ‘see’ or ‘feel’ the neighbouring, possible
trajectories but at once ‘chooses’ the optimum. The situation is completely different from a
quantum point of view. Is it true—asks Feynman—that a particle does not simply follow
the right path but it ‘looks around’ to ‘see’ other possible trajectories? And if it ﬁnds such
obstacles which unable it ‘to look’, does this result in diffraction? The true miracle is that it
is exactly as has been described. It may be seen, however, that the principle of least action
has not as yet been formulated completely, for this is not the way that a particle chooses the
path of least action. Rather it ‘feels’ all the nearby paths and chooses the one the action is
the least. The right path is the one for which there are plenty of neighbouring paths with the
same phase.
See Ogrodnik, “The Metaphysical Dimension of Optimizing Principles,” in Concrescence:
Australasian Journal of Process Thought, 5 (2004), p. 3. He is summarizing Richard Feynman and
A.R. Hibbs, Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965).

Evolutionary Time and the Creation of the Space of Life
389

Here Ogrodnik uses the language of “region,” which betokens a mereotopo-
logical approach that I think is favorable to theorizing the sorts of coordinate spaces
I am describing. The point is that an interpretation of the ﬂux in terms of a modiﬁed
quantum description is adaptable for my purposes.14
Further, as perception goes, within the visible spectrum, our perception of light
almost seems to precede our sensations of light—to have eyes is to reach for light,
physically, to anticipate it, whether it is available or not. In short, we temporally
extend our bodily processes into what the ﬂux may or may not supply, and hence,
we extend our durational feelings and intuitions into the future before it becomes
actual.
These examples are offered as ways we might understand the ﬂux as already
separated into tremendously variable processes. “Speed” relative to our bodies’
capacities for use of the ﬂux is not the only way to analyze the ﬂux.15 It is the
easiest, but all sorts of relations exist in the ﬂux that may not be captured by
thinking according to variable speed, or by the criterion of use. For example, it
doesn’t seem that gravitational inﬂuence is exactly the same thing as speed, which
is usually thought of in terms of electro-magnetic propagation.16 This variability of
the ﬂux is conﬁrmed in a thousand ways and conﬁrmable in a million more. It is not
debatable.
14Other examples of such process-friendly theorizing that would work for a truly general theory of
evolution include Łukasz Lamża, “Six Phases of Cosmic Chemistry,” in Hyle: The International
Journal for the Philosophy of Chemistry (2014), http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11272/1/Lamza_
Six_Phases_of_Cosmic_Evolution_DRAFT.pdf, accessed June 9, 2016.
15The “use” criterion is Bergson’s favorite landing zone for his ﬂights into intuitive temporal
experience. To my mind, he relies on it a bit too heavily. Langer notices, for example, that symbol
formation seems to await useless experience. See Philosophy in a New Key, pp. 116–117.
16Whitehead says:
If we go below the quanta of time which are the successive vibratory periods of the primate,
we ﬁnd a succession of vibratory electromagnetic ﬁelds, each stationary in the space-time
of its own duration. Each of these ﬁelds exhibits a single complete period of the electro-
magnetic vibration which constitutes the primate. This vibration is not to be thought of as
becoming of reality; it is what the primate is in one of the discontinuous realisations. Also
the successive durations in which the primate is realised are contiguous; it follows that the
life history of the primate can be exhibited as being the continuous development of
occurrences in electromagnetic ﬁeld.
See Science and the Modern World (New York: Macmillan, 1925), pp. 137–138. Here we
bring together, of course, what I am calling the space of life and that of mentality as primarily
electromagnetic overlapping of temporal modalities. It is true that the electric and magnetic
character can be divided and there is displacement, so there is no reason to assert an ultimate
simplicity in this mode of the ﬂux, only that the overlap is productive of spaces that include the
space of life. See Ogrodnik, “Towards a Metaphysics of Light: Whitehead’s Metaphysics of
Vibrations”.

31.5
The Creation of Space
What I will say now is debatable, but not easily. Space is the dynamic overlap of
multiple modes of the ﬂux. There is complementarity, tension, and conﬂict in the
overlap, the effect of which is, overall, to slow down various aspects of the ﬂux and
bring them into a transient stability. We call that transient stability “space,” in all of
its forms. In their mutual interactions, multiple aspects of the ﬂux come into such
conﬂict and complementarity along multiple axes. As far as we can grasp it, space
exists only as a generality—that is, as a sort of average among competing and
overlapping modes of the ﬂux. Some spaces are ﬂeeting and unstable, while others
are astonishingly stable, given their complexity. We do not know why some are
stable while others, far simpler, are not, but we can probably make some progress in
understanding that issue—if we could leave behind dogmas that grow from our
failure to understand what we are doing when we use ourselves as a physical and
physiological measuring rod.
At one level we simply have no alternative to positing ourselves, and our actual
experience, as the measuring rod. At some point, no matter what instrument we may
consider, apart from our bodies, someone had to calibrate it by hand and eye for our
perception. That is as true for a useful concept as for an instrument.17 Such indirect
means indicate the intelligibility of what is not part of our experience. We are not
justiﬁed in asserting that there is, in the ﬂux, anything that is unintelligible in
principle, to some experiencer, simply because we cannot ourselves imagine that
experiencer. But we must not go so far as to imagine that we know all of it to be
intelligible to us, even by means of mediation.
Thus, there are spaces throughout the ﬂux of which we are unaware, but there is
no reason to pronounce them undiscoverable in principle. Good physical investi-
gation seeks not just particles and patterns of propagation, but highly deﬁned spaces
of intelligibility (overlap in conﬂict and complementarity of the ﬂux) in which
highly speciﬁed phenomena might appear and leave a trace on our instruments or
our perceptions (including, by implication, our senses). What we learn is not, for
example, that “gravity waves exist,” but rather that a space can be created in which
a contrast in the ﬂux we name “gravity waves” might be indirectly detected, under
extremely limited, very expensive, and highly idiosyncratic circumstances. What
that complex space is really like, and whether we have understood its limits and
conditions is not provided by the experiments by which the trace of its conjectured

actuality is documented. Whether “gravity wave” is an apt name for what has been
discovered is also not provided by the indirect observation.18
We tend to ﬁnd that the hypothetical existences we expect, just as our eyes
“expect” light, and those we ﬁnd require tremendous reﬁnement over our history as
we learn more about the limits and conditions of the spaces in which they are
observable or which they create—the electron of today bears little resemblance (or
none) to its ﬁrst theoretical origins. Phenomena we believed to be different are
gradually seen to be the same, while some phenomena we thought to be the same
come to be distinguished. The “names” we have given them often deceive us and
18In response to Stuart Hameroff’s announcement that LIGO had measured the gravitational
waves, I wrote the following to him, and to the full list of academic discussants on the public
discussion of science among intellectuals on the list called Sadhu Sanga:
“With due respect –and I really mean respect, not merely “due” but in all sincerity: They
[LIGO] are attempting to re-discover or re-insert genuine time (eliminated by the theory of
GR) as wave forms of variable space (also static). They have not even begun to accomplish
the task of temporalizing the standard model of gravitational cosmology. These “mea-
surements” (and they are barely that at all, they admit) are not temporal transformations,
they are whatever of a transformation remaining that can be conformed to wave-shapes.
This is geometry ﬁrst, algebra subordinated, just like all of GR. The LIGO people, in
interpreting their measurements, fail to consider that (1) there is more to time than the
spaces it creates; and (2) all spaces are created by variable time-spans overlapping and
inter-nested. They are only looking for the tiny, tiny aspect of time they can conform to the
static 4D model. They are not interested in time. This isn’t a “direct detection” of anything,
nor does it conﬁrm GR (any more than it conﬁrms any other model of gravitational
cosmology that allows the spatialization of gravitational transformations as wave-forms).”
“Even if the LIGO experiments showed what they claim, there would still be massive,
massive problems with General Relativity. There is a fundamental problem with the form of
the argument itself. Showing x exists in accordance with Theory T's prediction does not
imply the truth of Theory T. It shows that T is not eliminated, and it also shows that and
any other Theory T1, T2, T3, etc., that predicts x exists is also not eliminated. Further, even
if a gravitational wave “exists,” we do not learn from that fact its full character, implica-
tions, effects, or causes. AND, the claims being made completely ignore the measurement
problem of cosmology, and the problem of the cosmological constant, and the reconcili-
ation of GR with quantum phenomena. These are not even addressed by this line of
experimentation, among other things. They simply ignore the problems and make
self-referential, model-centric claims in circles.”
There was some outcry among the scientists at what I said, but nothing that was argued
publicly subsequent to my statement by a number of prominent physicists and philosophers gives
me any cause to think this statement needs revision. A number of scientists agreed with what I
said, in part or whole, including Deepak Chopra of UC San Diego and Stanley Klein of UC
Berkeley. The fact is that when we allow the theoretical model to dictate the terms and evaluations
of the experiment, we are no longer doing reliable science. We can neither conﬁrm the model itself
nor discover its ﬂaws. It is close to what Greene said in the passage I extracted early in this essay.
The formal models developed by Mayr and Crick and others for testing selection are not exactly
“natural” or “science.” The selection they measure, if it occurs (and it does), is “natural” by
courtesy of analogy, tenuous analogy, between any fully formalized model and natural processes.

those names are slow to adapt to our shifting needs. One might use a phrase like
“natural selection,” for example, in such a way that no one could earnestly tell what
it means, even when they think they do. A remark like this applies quite directly to
the term “gravity.” Scientists themselves are apt to become confused and the sci-
entiﬁc journalists and public lag still further behind.
31.6
Evolutionary Time
We are now in a position to address to our main topic: evolutionary time. The
fundamental ambiguity in the word “evolution” must be noted—do we mean
something as broad as “ordered change,” or something as speciﬁc as the “progress” of
biological beings from whatever they were to whatever they are? The latter of these is
a much narrower space than the former. In the ﬂux, numerous spaces could be created
by the conﬂict and complementarity of the variable ﬂux that would fairly be called
“ordered change.” Biological evolution, however, is delicate and, as far as we can tell
at present, quite rare in the cosmos. But we might be wrong about its rarity. It may only
seem delicate and rare due to our limited perspective. Perhaps it is less unusual than
we think, but we are enabled, at all events, to say some things about it here.
It is not difﬁcult to see that if we pushed the orbit of the earth 200 miles closer to
the Sun than it currently is, we would probably still be within a dynamic, created
space that would permit the development of biological life. But whether it would be
the life we see today is very doubtful. The ﬁrst differences would show up in the
ﬂora, and our understanding of the actual delicacy on micro and macro environ-
mental systems that provides just the ﬂora we have would be greatly altered by a
200 mile variance in the constitution of the space. This variance far exceeds the
daunting predictions that climate scientists have provided relative to our current
climate change. Flora are temporal arrestings of the ﬂux that capture a dynamic
tension, a conﬂict and contrast, as well as a complementarity of a tremendous mix
of overlapping modalities in the ﬂux. The ﬂora hold these modalities for a time and
then, as it might be poetically described, they must renew by going to seed—nearly
die in order to live again.19 Any signiﬁcant alteration in the dynamic space might
make that renewal less well accommodated by the created space, but obviously
there are alterations in the space to which the ﬂora respond. It is a dynamic overlap
that permits a disequilibrium (and hence concentration) of energies that wouldn’t
otherwise be concentrated.
Similar thought experiments can be carried out by moving the earth’s orbit back
by 500 miles, or 1000. As the ﬂora vary so will the fauna. Human beings probably
wouldn’t be part of those temporary, dynamic overlappings of the ﬂux if we altered
19I cannot help recommending here Voltairine de Cleyre’s moving description of the dead morning
glory vine that she saw bloom, and her poetic but not altogether unscientiﬁc understanding of how
such things happen, how they are possible. See “The Dominant Idea” (1910), http://www.
voltairine.org/dominantidea.php, paragraphs 2–4 (accessed May 18, 2016).

any of a billion characteristics of the delicate overlap. And indeed, even tiny
variations would endow us with sensation, intuition, perception, cognition, and
reﬂection quite in contrast to that which we currently possess—if those categories
could still be maintained, which is doubtful.
The role of evolutionary theory, far from being the imperative to instruct the
public on the necessities of biological development (as Crick and Watson and
Wilson foolishly hold20), is to examine the ﬂux and to understand how such phe-
nomena as DNA are one sort of overlap of temporal processes, creating a dynamic
space within a range of conﬂicts and complementarities that exemplify—without
determining or exhausting—what is possible for the complex space we call “bio-
logical evolution.” It always could have proceeded in ways other than it did. There
is no predetermined class of variations that are somehow “allowed,” or even
speciﬁed in the presence of our current observations. We know some of what is
actual, but very little about what is possible. Becoming adamant and inﬂexible in
the presence of challenges to a pet model helps no one. It strengthens the spirit of
dogmatism among all the humans, scientiﬁc and religious as well, and blocks the
road of inquiry. The humans are not of great consequence from the standpoint of the
ﬂux, it appears, but to ourselves we are important. We want to live, to ﬂourish, to
thrive, to be at peace without being bored. We want not just a physical or a
biological space, but a cultural space in which the endowments of the ﬂux are
available for our highest aspirations. We want to be good, to enjoy beauty, to tell
the truth—well, many of us want that, at least. These spaces of goodness and beauty
are rariﬁed spaces indeed, so delicate as to come into existence only for the briefest
moments among our hopes and dreams, and never existing at all in our
macro-experience, except perhaps in discovery and such moments as childbirth, or
death, or revelry in nature, or, rarer still, even in worship.
How, then, you might fairly ask, is the theorist, the scientist, the inquirer, the
delicate and temporary wanderer amid the ﬂux, to address himself or herself to the
task of theorizing inquiry? If our older approaches to framing an evolutionary
theory have led us down blind allies and into ideologies that can be avoided, how is
“the avoiding” to be done? I will do my best to explain, but it is important to
remember that if the assertions about variable ﬂux and space creation I have
described are accepted, there is no reason to think that “evolution,” even as applied
to the narrowest sphere of life, i.e., the individual organism, let alone broader
phenomena, such as populations and species, is just one process, to be explained by
a single theory. We must bear in mind the possibility that evolution is a complex of
processes the explanation of which will never be reducible to a single mechanism or
concept or unit of measure.
Not every attempt at sound theorizing has missed the mark as completely as the
neo-Darwinian strategy. For quite a long time there have been evolutionary theories

that were more comprehensive than the problematic “received view.” I would
mention the “emergence” model of Robert G.B. Reid as a ﬁne example of broader,
non-ideological theorizing.21 There is the work by numerous theorists reviving
parts of earlier Lamarckian theories, saltation hypotheses, quantum and thermo-
dynamic processes and other thinking that might easily be described as “process
thinking.” Beyond evolutionary theories themselves, certainly those who have
studied systems theory, bioenergetics, cybernetics, circadian rhythms and other
bio-temporal studies, right down to studies of traditional medicine, are thinking
along temporalist lines. I would think that much of what has been thought, mea-
sured, correlated, and tested from these ways of approaching the question of evo-
lution could be ﬁtted within a broader, genuinely temporal theoretical framework.
Clearly my admonition that the overlap of temporal modalities be considered in
theorizing evolution has been done by numerous theorists, including some who see
themselves as loyal to neo-Darwinism, such as Mayr.22 The fact that these theorists
do not think of created space in the way I have described above may seem
unimportant, so long as they have developed a nuanced sense of the delicacy of the
life-sphere and a sense of all the relevant processes that must be maintained within a
limited overlap of the actual time-processes they are modeling. That demand is
surely met to some degree by the kinds of theories I listed above, as well as by the
standard model. But there is a methodological difference that accompanies my
description of space-creation, and which would be of signiﬁcant value to our future
theorizing, were it considered.
It has to be admitted that, space being already general in its mode of existing, we
must spatialize the phenomena further in order to think about space and, hence,
frame any theory. It is important to bear in mind as we create the spatial framework
for a theory that the theory does not do certain things, and should never be thought
of as doing so. No theory is identical with the existences it intends to describe. No
theory is identical with the phenomena (experience of those existences, whether
21See Robert G.B. Reid, Evolutionary Theory: The Unﬁnished Synthesis (New York: Springer,
1985); and Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment (Cambridge, MA: MIT
Press, 2007). I also recommend as a summary of such literature Pete A.Y. Gunter’s article,
“Darwinism: Six Scientiﬁc Alternatives,” Pluralist, 1:1 (Spring 2006), 13–30. Gunter discusses
quantum evolution, thermodynamic evolution, non-linear evolution, neo-Lamarckian theories, the
revival of the Baldwinian thesis, and the genome capture hypothesis.
22Highly informative in this regard are the debates of John C. Greene with Mayr and Theodozius
Dobzhansky. See Debating Darwin: Adventures of a Scholar (Claremont, CA: Regina Books,
1999). This is Greene’s memoire, dedicated to Ernst Mayr, “in friendship,” but Mayr did Greene a
bad turn in the late 1980s. After they had been debating genially for more than two decades (and
their correspondence bears this out), Mayr published an attack on Greene called “The Death of
Darwin?” which stimulated a good bit of acrimony. In that essay, Mayr was not wholly up front
about the debate as it had existed in both private and public for that extended number of years, and
he labeled Greene with views he knew to be half truths. Greene’s reputation was damaged and he
was obliged (with permission) to publish their correspondence in full, to defend himself, in a major
journal. But then Mayr placed his attack essay, unchanged, in his widely studied collection Toward
a New Philosophy of Biology. Rather than becoming petulant, Greene worked through the prob-
lems with Mayr. Still, in his memoire, Greene gently sets the record straight.
31

considered at the level of sensing, perceiving, or feeling) it intends to describe. No
theory is identical with the actual thinking about the experiences or existences it
describes. Nor is the theory identical with the process of reﬂecting upon that
thinking about those experiences or existences. Rather, the theory presents the
results of reﬂection upon the whole of the existences, experiences, thinking, and
reﬂecting. Its applicability is always impaired by these points of remoteness from
actual experience, but not to the point of uselessness.
There are signiﬁcant transformations when existences are experienced—i.e., as I
said, there is always more in existence than is experienced. What is excluded in the
transformation from existence to experience is nevertheless important to consider
while framing a good theory. It cannot be left aside or ignored. This is part of the
problem with using Mill’s logic of induction in assessing evidence. It is not
designed to help us consider what we are leaving aside. Its value (which is con-
siderable) is limited to the ways it helps us combine and sort and interpret obser-
vations under the assumption that we actually have the important positive pieces of
evidence before us, and on the assumption of the “uniformity of nature” within the
limits of our current inquiry. This sort of uniformity is an undischarged assumption
for all our results. Nature is not in fact uniform in the way we assume. If it were, we
wouldn’t be here. The deviations from such law-like regularity are what produce the
space of life.
Nature then is not uniform in the ways that would be required to generalize
beyond fairly narrow inquiries. It may be uniform enough to apply Mill’s logic, or
the contemporary version of it we ﬁnd in, for example, regression equations. Still,
the hypothesis that nature evolves is the precise contrary of the uniformity
assumption, and the former is the warranted assumption. To put a ﬁner point on it, I
am asserting that “nature evolves” in the sense that we know of no concrete
existences that are unaffected by time, in the sense of the ﬂux, and that among those
we experience, it appears that there is sufﬁcient organization in the processes of
change to use the word “evolution” for all beings we describe as living. We may be
justiﬁed in using the term beyond the living things, but we are certainly justiﬁed in
applying it exceptionlessly to everything we call living. To apply the term “evo-
lution” beyond living things requires a serious discussion that can be set aside at
present. But the term “nature” is inclusive of some temporal modalities that,
overlapping in certain transient and comparatively unstable ways, will evolve. Since
nature includes evolution, it is not misleading to say “nature evolves,” even if not
everything in nature does.
This result may also not seem important at ﬁrst, but it is. It means that whatever
else may be characteristic of nature, nature as a whole is compatible with the reality
of evolution. We cannot responsibly frame accurate conceptions and theories of
physical laws that make evolution a mystery, which, unfortunately, is what all the
reductionists do, both those from physics who defend general relativity, and those
from life science who defend neo-Darwinism. Evolution is not a mystery; it is a
fact. Reductionist views of the sciences that assert the supremacy of physics but
which fail to account for the occurrence, and probably the emergence (since it isn’t
easy to see how life could exist beyond the sorts of transient limitations we
396
R.E. Auxier

currently associate with the incidence of some very complex carbon combinations)
are simply bad theories. They are refuted by the facts. Whatever nature is, it does in
fact happen in the way we experience it. (This is true even if our experience is an
illusion—the illusion is nevertheless part of the process of nature.)
Nature also includes the processes of sensation, perception, thinking, and
reﬂecting. As far as we know, these processes are even more delicate than life, in
terms of the temporal modalities that must overlap to bring them about. These
processes, as far as we have been able to discover, occur only in living beings; we
do not assert it is impossible for them to exist beyond living beings, but I do not see
how we can speak of that possibility in a radically empirical, scientiﬁcally
responsible way, at this point. Even asserting that it is possible that such processes
as thinking and reﬂecting could exist without the occurrence of our kind of
embodiment is unclear to me. My suspicion is that the word “possible” is being
misused when this sort of idea is asserted. But it can be considered without being
asserted, and I see no harm in that. Thus, we conceive of all the temporal modalities
associated with sensing, perceiving, thinking, and reﬂecting as also evolving, at
least to the extent that the organisms exhibiting those processes evolve.
It follows that an adequate theory of evolution has to be broad enough in its
conception of how temporal processes overlap and create spaces to include the
evolution of ideas, and along with these, the residual, coagulated and enduring
products of ideas, such as cultures. This is nothing new, of course—social and
psychological evolution, and even cultural evolution, are topics that reach into the
very beginnings of evolutionary theory. As we know, these domains bring with
them complexities that most life-scientists, and indeed, most neo-Darwinians (but
not Crick and Wilson!) would rather avoid. The problems cannot be ignored,
however. To have an adequate evolutionary theory is to have a theory about how
everything that evolves does what it does.
My assertion that overlapping temporal modalities are creative of spaces, and
that at least some of these evolve. Such an assertion must include the spaces created
by sensing, perceiving, thinking, and reﬂecting, which are clearly embedded in
increasingly rariﬁed modalities of time. When we are thinking, the relevant energy
(itself a very peculiar combination of temporal modalities) moves at a certain speed,
and the contrast of that speed with the speed of the energies surrounding thinking
energies creates a space that is the dynamic space of thinking, while the other
surrounding dynamic spaces are not thinking, but also not preventing thinking. The
same may be said for reﬂecting. Although we do not understand these spaces very
well, we know far more now than we ever have about the conditions that need to be
in place for these spaces to emerge. But we still don’t know very much about what
“thinking” is. We know even less about reﬂecting, since it seems to require
thinking, but not to be reducible to it. We do have fair practice at habituating
thinking and ordering reﬂection, but the relation of these susceptibilities to some-
thing like evolution is barely understood at all, in the present. And our under-
standing of such things will not improve unless we ask the right questions. No
Darwinian is asking the right questions, or, if it could be said that some are, I would
31
Evolutionary Time and the Creation of the Space of Life
397

suggest that the theoretical framework they have preferred will distort the attempt at
interpreting whatever answers may come to those questions.
Time creates spaces. As far as we know, if one could remove all time, one would
destroy all spaces. Variable temporal modalities create different sorts of spaces. To
ask after the origin of variation in temporal modalities is a very important question.
Was there less temporal variation in the past and more in the present? It seems like
that might be true. Are there just a handful of fundamental temporal modalities that
somehow conﬂict and become diffused and hence varied as the universe unfolds?
This is very hard to know. But it is relevant to physics. Could such an unfolding be
called “evolution”? Perhaps. That question will have to be deferred for a future
inquiry.
31.7
Method
But what about method? How are those who want to theorize about evolution to
proceed such that a full appreciation of both the possibilities and limitations, sci-
entiﬁcally and culturally, might be kept before those who are inquiring? I think the
answer exists in Whitehead’s method of genetic and coordinate analysis. With Gary
Herstein, I have written extensively on this topic elsewhere,23 but for this context I
can provide a limited description of the method for evolutionary theory. It is
decidedly non-Darwinian, and the general ﬁeld to which it belongs is a species of
mereotopology. The sense of the term “genetic” here (and henceforth) includes but
is far broader than the typical usages. It certainly is not the adjectival form of the
Dawkinsian “gene.”
The initial move in a method that can accommodate the creation of spaces from
the variable ﬂux is to propose a coordinate whole to which all evolution belongs
and to inquire after the “parts.” There is no reason at all to assume that the parts will
exist in any clean hierarchy of substances and relations or that they will even be
commensurable. Given enough time, irreconcilable phenomena exist at distant ends
of both temporal duration and the spaces it creates. Look to the spaces. The spatial
structure will be a symbol of the temporal structures, no matter how remote from
one another they may be. The temporal modalities belonging to the whole called
“evolution” will need to include agencies of transition that could belong equally to
changing one’s habitat and changing one’s mind. The operational factors will then
surely be very general and perhaps, at ﬁrst, poorly speciﬁed. Their relations will be
discoverable only in part, at the outset. Just as Whitehead proposed eight categories
of existence (entities), some of which were more ﬁnal than others, nine categoreal
obligations and 27 categories of explanation, our ways of creating a genetic
23See Auxier and Herstein, The Quantum of Explanation: Whitehead’s Radical Empiricism
(London and New York: Routledge, forthcoming), esp. chs. 7–9.
398
R.E. Auxier

arrangement of the coordinate whole are both organic and nonlinear—but they must
be able to accommodate linear simpliﬁcations.
In the case of evolution, theorizing the whole of evolving existences may prove to
be beyond our ken, but however we propose the whole, it must be open to the
inclusion of what we have not yet imagined—indeed, it needs to be open to the reality
of what does not yet exist at all and could not be imagined by generalizing responsibly
from what does now exist. I feel conﬁdent that our current peculiarities as existences
would not be deducible as genuine possibilities even by the smartest beings we can
imagine, if we were to retrogress to a time when the earth was young. There is not
much in the primal soup the portends The Beatles. But they were a possibility, were
they not? And there is not much in the soup of the present that portends whatever is
removed from us by 4.5 billion years. Yet, here we are, trying to develop a framework
that stretches from soup to Beatles and from Beatles to … well, whatever. Natural
laws, if there are any, themselves evolve—or if they do not, then we are currently
ignorant of them, since we only experience things that do evolve.
Thus, our evolving whole must be inclusive of possibilities not detectable in or
derivable from our present. This whole must be inclusive of all the known modes of
time which, although they are far too numerous to specify, are not too numerous to
categorize. I believe I have in fact done so, broadly, in distinguishing the spaces of
reﬂection, thinking, perception, sensing, and acting. These spaces can and do exist
together. The aspects of physical time that support the overlap of complementary and
conﬂicting physical time that appears, at this point, necessary for the subtler overlap
and conﬂict of modalities peculiar to life, supply the needed categories. They are,
interestingly, electromagnetic, but not overtly gravitational. The effects of gravitation
upon this overlap remain vague in the present, but it certainly seems to be a
requirement for life. For the present, we treat it as a dynamic constant—earth gravity,
for now, but allowances must be made in the coordinate whole for tremendous
variance in gravitational inﬂuence on life. How much variance? It is impossible to
know for certain. “As wide as possible for our thinking” would be the wise position.
The electromagnetic range of temporal overlap needs, if we would treat it as a
primary basis for the conﬂict and complementarity of the space of life, to include
the life of the senses, and then the synesthetic processes that bring us perception,
and then the temporal modalities that allow perception to function as a feeling of the
world. When we have included these, and the widest range of variation thinkable,
we need to take a close look at the temporal relations and modes that can be sorted
from among those of perception into those of thinking—very difﬁcult work indeed.
And hereafter, we must be able to name and situate the temporal character of
reﬂection in relation to thinking. When we have categorized, named, and sorted
these levels to the best of our ability, we should re-examine their results. The
“ideas” we think with are in contrast to those with which we reﬂect. They may
deserve more speciﬁc terminology, reserving, for example, “images” for the units of
active thinking, and “thoughts” for the units of reﬂecting, both being types of ideas
on different levels of generality and determinate formation. The processes that make
us “live,” including ideas, seem to work against the entropy of physical systems.
For example, I have an idea to exercise and become healthier and by transforming
31
Evolutionary Time and the Creation of the Space of Life
399

the electrochemical processes within my body concentrate a different quality of
disequilibrated localized energies in my body that not only slow its entropic dif-
fusion, but in the case of the idea, taken functionally as the commencement of that
exercise regimen, positively counter-act entropy. The entire temporal system of life
is shot through with contrasts of this kind—anti-entropic, nonlinear. Obviously the
work of Ilya Prigogine is to be treated as a great discovery in this kind of theorizing.
We begin to make progress in evolutionary theory in proportion to our will-
ingness to examine, earnestly and honestly, the difference between what we do
know and what we would like to know in order to have an advanced theory. We can
show serious progress in some areas—for example, in addition to Prigogine’s
discoveries about nonlinear processes and disequilibrium, the workings of time in
the relationship between thinking and reﬂecting has been very thoroughly studied,
by phenomenologists and psychologists (and gurus and wandering monks) for a
very long time. We actually have enough in the way of results, herewith, to
speculate responsibly on the order and operation of time in reﬂecting as it exists in
contrast (that, is, complementarity and conﬂict) with actual thinking. The relation of
time in the life process to sensation is poorly understood, and for all our efforts,
most of our work in relating sensation to perception has been ineffectual. There are
gleanings in, for instance, the psychology of sensation of J.J. Gibson and the
philosophy of tacit knowing of Michael Polanyi, I think. All of their hypotheses and
results can be accommodated by a thoroughly temporal hypothesis about evolution.
I have found in the unpublished work of Ted Calhoun (the Bell Labs experimen-
talist) a number of formulae, expressed in Lie algebras, that may enable a fairly
rigorous speciﬁcation of the most interesting temporal relations between physical
process and life. I hope that some of these results will be published soon.
I could say more, but the truth is that I am not so far down the road as to be able to
offer more than a vague sense of the coordinate whole to which evolutionary theory
should belong. Neither is anyone else. But what I think I do grasp is how the genetic
speciﬁcation of that whole should proceed, in a general but adequately determinate
way. Evolution, if it is to be theorized, presupposes a quantum of explanation (this is
not a unit of measure) that is not itself an actual unit of division in the conﬂicting and
complementary overlap that is the space of life. That space is not divisible in actuality,
only in analysis. If we would understand the “time of life,” or of living, we must be
reconciled to its actual indivisibility. We must not try to quantify what cannot serve
ﬁrst as a quantum. That may sound cryptic, but it means that the interpretation of a
unit in the mereotopological whole precedes the projection of the whole itself. In
short, we project the whole before we can comprehend the whole as the sum of its
(interpreted) parts. Whether a given division in analysis can become a division in the
actual continuum of temporal modalities is a question to be tested, but not to be
insisted upon. And what is divisible now may not be divisible forever, and what is
indivisible now may yield itself to more than mere analysis in some other cosmic
situation. History is an example of the former, and language is an example of the latter.
Hence, the question of genesis (not the gene, not Genesis in the Bible, but in the
Whiteheadian sense) is the question of evolution, and it is particular, while the
question of the coordinate whole is universal in import.

A Computational Mathematics View
of Space, Time and Complexity
David H. Bailey and Jonathan M. Borwein
Abstract Modern computational mathematics requires a philosophical perspective
largely at odds with that of traditional mathematics, since current computational
mathematics (as distinct from computer science) is by its very nature is discrete,
not continuous, and tied to the real world in ways that the more theoretical branches
of mathematics (and computer science) often are not. Indeed, computational math-
ematics provides a means to escape the trap feared by John von Neumann when he
wrote,
[T]here is a grave danger that the subject [of mathematics] will develop along the line of least
resistance, that the stream so far from its source [in empirical reality] will separate into a
multitude of insigniﬁcant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass
of details and complexities.
But even a computational approach to mathematics has limits, not the least of which
are the uncertainties of errors in hardware, software and algorithms that inevitably
are part-and-parcel with computation, although there are ways to limit these uncer-
tainties. In our chapter, bulwarked by concrete examples, we will try to situate past,
present and future mathematical views of space, time, inﬁnity and certainty within
a computational context in which, for example, error due to quantum eﬀects begins
to compete with traditional sources of logical and numerical inaccuracy. We shall
also argue that traditional taxonomies of complexity and completeness are not only
outmoded but actually destructive of progress.

Historical Perspective of Computational Mathematics
In traditional pegagogy, mathematics is taught as a sequence of axioms, deﬁnitions,
theorems and proofs, entirely similar in style to Euclid’s 2300-year-old Elements.
While we in no way wish to disparage the axiomatic approach (and any serious math-
ematician surely must master it), there are downsides to an overly pedantic focus on
purely formal methods.
To begin with, a purely axiomatic approach is historically dishonest, because the
real work of mathematical discovery throughout history has almost always involved
numerical and algebraic experimentation, from which insight is gained and hypothe-
ses formulated. Only later were these hypotheses turned into precisely worded theo-
rems and proofs that we read today in journals and textbooks.
Carl Fredrich Gauss, arguably the 19th century’s greatest mathematician,
explained that his way of arriving at mathematical truths was through “systematic
experimentation” [1]. When just 14 or 15 years old, after computing long tables of
prime numbers, he conjectured that the number of primes less than n is, for large
n, approximately n∕log n, which is now known as the prime number theorem [2,
pg. 13]. On another occasion, while examining tables of integrals provided by James
Stirling, he noticed that the reciprocal of one integral agreed numerically with a limit
of the arithmetic-geometric mean iteration. This purely computational observation
led Gauss to discover and develop elliptic and modular function theory [2, pg. 13].
Indeed many great mathematicians from Archimedes and Galileo—who appar-
ently said All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to
discover them.—to Gauss, Poincaré, and Lennard Carleson, have emphasized how
much it helps to “know" the answer.
More importantly, the axiomatic approach fails to train mathematicians, pure or
applied, in the real work of 21st century mathematical discovery, which, more than
in any previous era, involves substantial amounts of computational experimentation.
Although some of the older generation still say that “real mathematicians don’t com-
pute,” the majority of research mathematicians today are ﬂuent and accustomed to
using a variety of computational tools, such as the commercial products Maple and
Mathematica, as well as any number of custom-written tools for both symbolic and
numeric computing.
This synergy between humans and computers has produced a new set of mathe-
matical results that would not have been possible (or at least not likely) to have been
discovered in an earlier era. As a single example, out of many that could be listed, in
1996 the following formula for 𝜋(known as the “BBP” formula [3]) was discovered
by a computer program:
𝜋=
∞
∑
k=0
1
16k

8k + 1 −

)
.
(32.1)
This formula has the remarkable property that it permits one to calculate, by means
of a surprisingly simple algorithm, binary or base-16 digits of 𝜋beginning at an

arbitrary starting position, without needing to compute any of the digits before the
speciﬁed position. The numerical computation that led to the discovery of (32.1)
certainly does not constitute a rigorous proof of this identity, but once discovered
numerically, the proof turned out to be a relatively simple exercise of calculus [2,
pg. 118].
We are hardly the ﬁrst to observe that discovery is often the more important part
of proof. Two millennia ago, Archimedes wrote, in the Introduction to his long-lost
and recently reconstituted Method manuscript,
For it is easier to supply the proof when we have previously acquired, by the method, some
knowledge of the questions than it is to ﬁnd it without any previous knowledge.
Similarly, as 2006 Abel Prize winner Lennart Carleson described in his 1966 Inter-
national Congress of Mathematics speech on his positive resolution of Luzin’s 1913
conjecture, only after many years of seeking a counterexample, he ﬁnally decided
none could exist. He expressed the importance of this conﬁdence as follows [4]:
The most important aspect in solving a mathematical problem is the conviction of what is
the true result. Then it took two or three years using the techniques that had been developed
during the past 20 years or so [to prove the result].
32.2
Reliability of Computations
Computing in mathematics (or in any other discipline) raises troubling questions
about the reliability of computation. After all, there are many possible sources of
error:
∙The underlying formulas or algorithms used might be incorrectly deduced or
incorrectly transcribed from underlying theory.
∙Computer programs implementing these formulas and algorithms, which often
employ highly sophisticated techniques to accelerate the computation (e.g., FFTs,
parallel programming constructs, etc.), are certainly prone to error.
∙Mathematical and scientiﬁc computing relies heavily on ﬂoating-point calcula-
tions, and the results of these calculations may be numerically unreliable, espe-
cially when performed on a parallel computer system with uncertain order of oper-
ations.
∙All computers rely on a vast infrastructure of system software and compilers that
inevitably contains errors.
∙Hardware errors can and do occur, particularly in large-scale, long-running cal-
culations. Even quantum-level errors are now expected to be a factor in future
computation.
So why should anyone believe the results of calculations? The answer is that most
important calculations are checked with one or more independent calculations done
using a diﬀerent algorithm, software package, precision level, hardware system or
all of the above.

406
D.H. Bailey and J.M. Borwein
For example, ﬂoating-point calculations, as mentioned above, often give slightly
diﬀerent results when run on a diﬀerent computer system or one with a diﬀerent
number of processors. Indeed, ensuring reproducibility of ﬂoating-point results is a
growing challenge in computing in general and mathematical and scientiﬁc comput-
ing in particular [5]. But there are relatively simple ways to ensure reproducibility,
such as by changing the default rounding mode (to see what diﬀerence this makes
in the results), or by employing software-based higher precision. Although one can-
not guarantee absolute integrity in this way, if two calculations using high-precision
arithmetic agree to many digits beyond the level required to discover the phenomena
in the ﬁrst place, this is a pretty strong conﬁrmation that the computation is numer-
ically sound (although see below in Sect. 32.3).
As a related example, 21st century mathematicians, continuing a centuries-old
tradition, have computed large numbers of digits of constants such as 𝜋, in an eﬀort
to explore the long-standing unanswered question of whether and why these digit
expansions are statistically random in a certain sense [6]. As of the present date,
the state-of-the-art in this regard is the computation of over 10 trillion base-16 dig-
its and 12.1 trillion decimal digits of 𝜋, by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo [7].
Their main computation employed the following formula, due to David and Gregory
Chudnovsky [2, pg. 108]:
1
𝜋= 12
∞
∑
k=0
(−1)k (6k)!(13591409 + 545140134k)
(3k)! (k!)3 6403203k+3∕2
.
(32.2)
Using this formula, they computed 10,048,832,487,050 base-16 digits of 𝜋. Then, in
a separate computation, they directly computed 64 base-16 digits of 𝜋, beginning at
position 10,048,832,487,013, using the following variant of the “BBP” formula [2,
pg. 124]:
𝜋= 1
64
∞
∑
k=0
(−1)k
1024k
(
256
10k + 1 +

10k + 9 −

10k + 3 −
4
10k + 5 −
4
10k + 7 −
32
4k + 1 −
1
4k + 3
)
.
In both calculations, the slightest error at any stage almost certainly renders the ﬁnal
results to be utterly and wholly incorrect. Here are the two corresponding sets of
results:
d9ae13df df0c64d9 49bacf10 f55ae963 254699a8 bb24624b d47aea96
8016b052
d9ae13df cf0c64d9 49bacf10 f55ae963 254699a8 bb24624b d47aea96
8016b052
Needless to say, the ﬁnal results dramatically agree, thus conﬁrming (in a convincing
but heuristic sense) that both sets of results are almost certainly correct.
This raises the following question: What is more securely established, the asser-
tion that the base-16 digits of 𝜋in positions 10, 048, 832, 487, 043 through 10, 048,
832, 487, 050 are 8016b052, or the ﬁnal theorem(s) of some very diﬃcult work
of mathematics that required hundreds or thousands of pages, that relied on many

32
A Computational Mathematics View of Space, Time and Complexity
407
results quoted from other sources, and that (as is frequently the case) only a relative
handful of mathematicians besides the author can or have carefully read in detail?
When is computation more reliable than proof?
As another example, when one uses a credit card to purchase an item online,
it is quite likely that the underlying software generates two pseudorandom prime
numbers. To establish that a generated integer is prime, one could use the provable
polynomial-time algorithm recently discovered by three Indian mathematicians [8,
pg. 302], but in practice the Monier-Rabin probabilistic primality test is used instead
[8, pg. 301].
The Monier-Rabin algorithm is not a “provable” test, in the sense of an absolute
guarantee of primality. But if the integer has 500 or more bits (as is typical in e-
commerce) and passes this test once, then we may argue that the ‘probability’ that it is
not prime is less than 1.6 × 10−24. If it passes the test ﬁve times, then the probability
is much less than 10−100. Note that such tiny probabilities are inconceivably smaller
than the chance that an undetected hardware error glitch or quantum-mechanical
ﬂuke occurs during the calculation, not to mention the possibility of a computer
program bug or a human mathematical error in deriving, transcribing or applying the
test. Given these realities, what is the point of distinguishing between a “provable”
primality test (performed either by a human or by a computer) and a probabilistic
primality test (performed by a computer)?
Such considerations have led a growing number of mathematicians to now regard
computation as on a par with formal reasoning, provided calculations are double-
checked by suﬃciently rigorous tests. They have also drawn into question the value,
from a practical point of view, of pursuing algorithms whose only advantage over
other algorithms is that they are “provably correct.”
32.3
Finite Computations
Computation, by its very deﬁnition, is a decidedly ﬁnite and discrete process. There is
no place in real-world scientiﬁc or mathematical computing for actual inﬁnities, nor
can computation deal directly with the uncountably inﬁnite and continuous real line
(or 2-D or 3-D space). It is true that symbolic mathematical software can represent
inﬁnity, and can, for example, symbolically evaluate the integral of a function over an
inﬁnite interval, but beneath the symbolic processing, the software and the computer
it runs on are, of course, discrete, ﬁnite entities.
While in some cases the integral of a function over an inﬁnite interval can be
computed symbolically, evaluation over some ﬁnite interval may well not be possi-
ble symbolically and will require numerical computation to obtain a concrete answer.
As Stanislaw Ulam once said, “The inﬁnite we shall do right away. The ﬁnite may
take a little longer” [9]. On the other hand, the space of functions that can be numer-
ically integrated to any desired accuracy is far vaster than the space of functions that
can be symbolically integrated in closed form. Similarly, the space of ordinary and
partial diﬀerential equations (which are a mainstay of applied mathematics) that can

408
D.H. Bailey and J.M. Borwein
be numerically solved to any desired accuracy is far vaster than the space of such
equations that can be analytically solved by symbolic processing.
It is true that one cannot absolutely rely on numerical computations. For example,
consider the innocent-looking integral [10]
∫
∞
0
cos(2x)
∞
∏
n=1
cos
( x
n
)
dx =
(32.3)
0.392699081698724154807830422909937860524645434187231595926812285162 …
One might ﬁrst be tempted to think that this is equal to 𝜋∕8, namely
𝜋
8 = 0.392699081698724154807830422909937860524646174921888227621868074038 … ,
but note that while two values agree for 42 digits, they diﬀer beginning in the 43rd
digit; they are not equal. As it turns out, the integral (32.3) is merely the ﬁrst term of
a very rapidly convergent series; if two terms are taken, the sum is 𝜋∕8 to over 500
digits; if three are taken, the sum is 𝜋∕8 to over 8,000 digits.
A related example if the following. Consider the following “identity” [11, 12]:
∞
∑
n=−∞
sinc(n) sinc(n∕3) sinc(n∕5) sinc(n∕7) ⋯sinc(n∕p)
?= ∫
∞
−∞
sinc(x) sinc(x∕3) sinc(x∕5) sinc(x∕7) ⋯sinc(x∕p) dx,
(32.4)
where sinc x means (sin x)∕x. Provably, the following is true: This identity is pre-
cisely valid for prime p among the ﬁrst at least 10176 primes; but stops holding after
some larger prime. Thereafter the sum is less than the integral, but they diﬀer by
much less than 10−100.
In short, numerical coincidence is no guarantee of mathematical certainty. On the
other hand, when is a mathematical identity “close enough for government work”?
When can one for all practical purposes replace the inﬁnities in the above formulas
with some large ﬁnite values? Many mathematicians are quite content, say, with 100-
digit agreement, to conclude that the apparent result is worth seeking a proof for, or
at least understanding why the near-identity holds.
32.4
A Finite Universe
As mentioned above, much mathematics from calculus forward (with the exception
of ﬁnite and/or discrete algebraic structures) assumes a continuous, complete, inﬁ-
nite space, so, for example, we can subdivide the real line ad inﬁnitum, the limits of

32
A Computational Mathematics View of Space, Time and Complexity
409
convergent sequences are actual points in the real line, and if a continuous real func-
tion is positive for one argument and negative for another, then there is at least one
real point between these two arguments for which the function is exactly zero. Since
the nineteenth century a careful development of countably inﬁnite limiting processes
has been central to mathematical analysis.
But, one can ask, is nature, at the most basic, fundamental level, really like this?
From several lines of research, the answer appears to be “no.” For example,
the Bekenstein bound, derived from quantum theory by Israeli theoretical physicist
Jacob Bekenstein in 1981, places an upper limit on the number of quantum states
that can be contained within a volume [13]. For a sphere with mass m kg and radius
R meters, the limit is
I ≤2𝜋cRm
̄h log 2
≈2.577 × 1043mR,
(32.5)
where c is the speed of light and ̄h is Planck’s constant. Thus, for example, at most
2.6 × 1042 bits of information are suﬃcient to perfectly recreate any human brain
down to the quantum level [14].
But one can also apply the Bekenstein bound to the entire observable universe.
If this is done, one obtains approximately 10123 bits, so that the maximum number
of quantum states is some 1010123 [15, pg. 108]. These reckonings are tightly con-
nected with the “holographic principle,” in which the information within a sphere is
inevitably limited to the information that can be held on its boundary [16]. What-
ever these values are, they are ﬁnite—the real universe is not the same as the inﬁnite,
continuous space of classical mathematics.
We may then ask how many digits of 𝜋can be stored in the known universe?
Surely it cannot be more than the total number of quantum states, which while enor-
mous is still ﬁnite.
Along this line, physicist Max Tegmark, in his recent book Our Mathematical
Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality [17], argues that at its most
fundamental level, our universe is not merely described by a mathematical struc-
ture; it is a mathematical structure. He points out that only a mathematical structure,
deﬁned by axioms and relations, can qualify for a description of reality that is com-
pletely free from human (or even extraterrestrial) baggage. He further proposes two
additional hypothesis [17, pg. 267]:
∙Computable Universe Hypothesis: Our external physical reality is a mathematical
structure deﬁned by computable functions.
∙Finite Universe Hypothesis: Our external physical reality is a ﬁnite mathematical
structure.
These two hypotheses are explored in Chap. 12 of his book. But whichever of these
one is more inclined to accept, both suggest that fundamental physical reality is dis-
crete, not continuous.

Theoretical Versus Practical
As we noted above, computational mathematics, if performed with suitably rigorous
double-checks, can produce results that are arguably as reliable, in a practical sense,
as formal proofs in many cases, or at least can be thought of as another avenue to
approach secure mathematical knowledge.
But there is one other advantage of modern computational mathematics: It pro-
vides a means to escape the trap feared by John von Neumann when he wrote in
1947,
As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a
second and third generation only indirectly inspired by “reality” it is beset with very grave
dangers. It becomes more and more pure aestheticizing, more and more purely l’art pour
l’art. This need need not be bad if the ﬁeld is surrounded by correlated subjects which have
still closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the inﬂuence of men with
exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop
along the line of least resistance, that the stream so far from its source will separate into a
multitude of insigniﬁcant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass
of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance form its empirical source,
or after much abstract inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. [18,
pg. 291].
Modern computational mathematics provides a medium of communication
between theoretical and applied mathematics, and a route to empirical reality. What
we can compute, we can be fairly certain has some tangible existence and some tan-
gible possibility of leading to greater understanding of both the corpus of modern
mathematics and also the universe around us.
For example, one can argue that the traditional hierarchy of rational, algebraic,
elementary and “advanced” functions was driven by a pre-computer age. Exponen-
tials, logarithms, sines and cosines are all considered “elementary,” yet the elliptic
integral functions
K(x) ∶= ∫
1
0
dt
√
(1 −t2)(1 −x2t2)
E(x) ∶= ∫
1
0
√
1 −x2t2
√
1 −t2
dt
are, from a computational point of view, simpler and easier to compute. This is
because these functions can be quickly evaluated by quadratically convergent
arithmetic-geometric mean calculations, and so for high precision calculations they
are faster to compute than the “elementary” functions. Indeed, K admits of a quadratic
transformation
K (k) = (1 + k1) K (k1
) ,
k1 ∶= 1 −

1 −k2

√
1 −k2
,

as was known already to Landen, Legendre and Gauss. To compute K(𝜋∕6) =
1.699075885 … to ﬁve places requires using (32.6) only twice and then estimating
the resultant integral by 𝜋∕2. A third step gives the ten-digit precision shown.
In fact, the elementary functions can be computed from the elliptic functions. For
example, the logarithm to high precision can be computed as an approximation of K
[2, 8, 19]. Explicitly, [19, Algorithm 7.1] gives for 1∕2 < x < 1 and n > 3 that
||||
log (x) −K′ ( 1
10n
)
+ K′ ( x
10n
)||||
≤
n
102(n−1) ,
(32.7)
where K′(x) = K(
√
1 −x2).
The same can be said of algebraic functions. Even in the case of cubic algebraic
numbers, in practice it is usually more eﬃcient to numerically solve the underlying
polynomial, using Newton iterations, than to use the closed form for a solution due
to Cardano; for higher-degree polynomials it is almost always faster to use numerical
methods (and hardly any analytic solutions exist).
Thus, perhaps the traditional taxonomy of functions and their computational com-
plexity needs to be re-thought in the computer age.
Along this line, it is interesting to compare theoretical mathematics with the
ﬁeld of theoretical computer science. On one hand, some remarkable and signiﬁcant
results have been produced in the ﬁeld. We now know that there are some compu-
tations that are simply not possible—for example, we know that it is not possible
to infallibly determine, by means of a ﬁnite computer program running on a real
computer, whether or not another computer program has an inﬁnite loop (this is a
result originally due to Turing). It cannot, because such a program cannot perform
this diagnosis on itself.
Similarly, the P = NP? problem is as intriguing as it is far-reaching. This prob-
lem is described as follows by the Clay Mathematics Institute, which has oﬀered a
US$1,000,000 prize for its resolution:
Suppose that you are organizing housing accommodations for a group of four hundred uni-
versity students. Space is limited and only one hundred of the students will receive places
in the dormitory. To complicate matters, the Dean has provided you with a list of pairs of
incompatible students, and requested that no pair from this list appear in your ﬁnal choice.
This is an example of what computer scientists call an NP-problem, since it is easy to check
if a given choice of one hundred students proposed by a coworker is satisfactory (i.e., no
pair taken from your coworker’s list also appears on the list from the Dean’s oﬃce), how-
ever the task of generating such a list from scratch seems to be so hard as to be completely
impractical. Indeed, the total number of ways of choosing one hundred students from the
four hundred applicants is greater than the number of atoms in the known universe!
Some problems now known to be in the category NP-complete (and thus pre-
sumed to be not solvable in reasonable computer time) include [20]:
∙The traveling salesman problem. Given a list of cities and distances between each
pair, ﬁnd the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the
start.

412
D.H. Bailey and J.M. Borwein
∙The knapsack problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight (or size) and a
value, ﬁnd how many of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight
is less than a speciﬁed maximum weight, and the total value is as great as possible.
∙The subgraph isomorphism problem. Given two graphs, determine whether one
contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to the other.
However, these lines of research have only had muted impact on the real world
of mathematical and scientiﬁc computing. The main diﬃculty is that NP-complete
considerations are driven by a worst-case analysis of a measure that does not reﬂect
practical usage. After all, providing O(n) bounds on the cost, polynomial or other-
wise, does not say much if we do not know the size of the high-order coeﬃcients of
the polynomial. At a minimum, one must distinguish between questions of the pos-
sibility or impossibility of solving the most general form of these problems and the
practical diﬃculty of obtaining satisfactory practical solutions to real-world versions
of these problems.
For example, while the traveling salesman problem is known to be NP-complete,
problems of this general type are solved routinely, every day, in both scientiﬁc
research and private industry. Airlines, for example, use sophisticated computer pro-
grams running on highly parallel computer systems to schedule their aircraft, logis-
tics and staﬀto the ever-changing requirements of their passenger-destination load.
This is done using linear or semideﬁnite programming techniques, which are special
cases of mathematical optimization. They are known to have eﬀective algorithms in
P, while the classical simplex method, which is still heavily used, does not lie in P.
Relatedly Goemans and Williamson showed for the NP-hard ‘min-cut/max-ﬂow’
problem that a randomized version of a semideﬁnite relaxation after dualization—
which being a semideﬁnite program can be solved approximately in polynomial
time—has expected performance exceeding 0.87856 % of the exact solution [21,
Sect. 3.3].
Even the navigation software now incorporated into virtually all smartphones per-
forms computations of this type to ﬁnd a shortest-time route. For that matter, the C,
C++, Fortran and Java compilers that are used countless times every day by soft-
ware programmers routinely employ similar algorithms to schedule instructions for
optimal performance of the generated code.
It is important to note that in real-world applications, certainly including airline
scheduling, navigation and compilers, it is not necessary to ﬁnd the absolutely opti-
mal solution—a solution that is reasonably close to an optimal solution is entirely
satisfactory. In this regards, the theoretical problems addressed, say, in studies of
NP-complete problems, are of a diﬀerent class and not really applicable.
Similar considerations apply to other arenas of computer science. In parallel com-
puting, for example, thousands of papers have been written presenting algorithms for
the parallel random access (PRAM) model of computing. This model presumes that
each of n processors can either perform one arithmetic operation or read from or
write to any location in a shared memory. However, scientists performing scientiﬁc
computations on parallel computer systems have not found this body of research very
useful, because the model does not match very well the characteristics of real parallel

32
A Computational Mathematics View of Space, Time and Complexity
413
computers. Instead, virtually all computers at the present and foreseeable future time
employ a cache memory system, wherein data access to anything but local registers
requires many more clock periods than arithmetic operations; and accesses to data in
a remote memory node requires many times more clock periods than accessing data
in the local node. For these reasons, today most performance analysis and tuning of
algorithms and applications are today targeted to more realistic models, such as the
log P model developed by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley [22]
and the rooﬂine model developed by Samuel Williams [23].
A related issue in parallel computing is that for many problems of practical, every-
day interest, in mathematical, scientiﬁc or even business applications, considera-
tions of massive parallelism are moot, because the problem to be solved simply does
not possess suﬃcient concurrency to justify parallel processing (a consequence of
Amdahl’s Law [24, pg. 348]), particularly when the ever-present software and hard-
ware overhead of coordinating large numbers of parallel processors is considered. It
is true that some applications do possess very high levels of concurrency; many such
applications are running on large-scale parallel supercomputers operated by univer-
sities and government laboratories. But for the vast majority of applications, only
modest levels of parallelism can be eﬃciently exploited; and for still others, only
single-threaded execution makes practical sense.
One ﬁnal item that should be mentioned is the ineluctable fact that mathemati-
cians, scientists and others who are using computers today in their research often do
their work via heavy-duty software layers, such as the mathematical software envi-
ronments Maple and Mathematica. In such environments it is often not possible to
know what algorithms are really being performed “under the hood.” This fact con-
siderably complicates any attempts by the user to employ advanced algorithms.
32.6
Conclusion
We have observed that computational mathematics is a more honest representation of
mathematics, in that it does not hide or obscure the experimental processes by which
a mathematical hypothesis is discovered. Only later are such discoveries turned into
the polished, axiomatic expositions that we read in textbooks.
We have also observed that computational mathematics leads to interesting and
important considerations of reliability—how to deﬁne and arrive at secure mathe-
matical knowledge, given that computation is inherently subject to errors of many
types, ranging from programming errors to submicroscopic glitches rooted in quan-
tum mechanics. Yet we have also seen that suitably chosen validity tests can mitigate
these errors, turning questionable calculations into extremely reliable mathematical
and scientiﬁc assertions. Indeed, at some point, computations are arguably as reli-
able, if not more so, than formal reasoning.
Additionally, there is considerable evidence that a computational approach to
mathematics permits the ﬁeld to escape the trap, originally highlighted by John
von Neumann, of becoming so isolated from the richer empirical world of modern

414
D.H. Bailey and J.M. Borwein
science that it becomes both sterile and irrelevant. And even in computer science,
connections to real-world mathematical and scientiﬁc computations can help focus
research in the ﬁeld in useful directions and help it avoid similar traps of isolation
and irrelevance.
While we have discussed current computer architecture and not advanced quan-
tum computing, we are relatively sure that even such advances will not entirely
change the situation.
Finally, an expanded reliance on computation in mathematics does need to guard
against a diminution in the reliability of the mathematical corpus. Proofs still need
to be developed when possible and heuristics need to be clearly labeled.

Space and Time in Charles Babbage’s
Calculating Engines
Doron Swade
Computing machines are artefacts of human creativity. Historically such machines
were the most complex artefacts of their time. It was not just a question of structural
complexity—the intricate geometry of components and their spatial organisation—
but time-dependent behavioural complexity. One arena in which time and space
entwine is in design—whether time can be traded for space or vice versa. Another is
that of representation—meeting the unprecedented demands of description and
understanding that complex time-dependent systems present. System and repre-
sentation are not always separable: the languages we use to represent things often
become the terms in which we understand them. We explore here some of the issues
of complexity, time-dependence and representation in the design of the earliest
automatic computing machines.
33.1
The First Computing Engines
The earliest designs for automatic computing machines were those for the vast
mechanical engines of Charles Babbage (1791–1871), English mathematician and
polymath, who devoted the best part of his professional life to designing and
attempting to build computing engines [1, 2]. He conceived and produced advanced
designs for the ﬁrst fully automatic calculating engine, Difference Engine No. 1,
and went on to design the ﬁrst programmable general-purpose computer, the
Analytical Engine, which incorporates just about every logical feature of a modern
electronic digital computer [3]. His tale is one of genius and failure. The designs are
towering intellectual achievements that represent a quantum leap in logical

conception and physical scale in relation to what had gone before. Yet despite
personal wealth, social position, and near-obsessive commitment, he failed to
complete any of his engines in their entirety. The ﬁrst complete calculating engine
built to Babbage’s original designs was not completed till the modern era nearly
150 years after the designs left the drawing board [1, 4].
Babbage’s engines were massively ambitious. Their physical scale was
unprecedented. Difference Engine No. 1, designed during the 1820s, called for
some 25,000 separate parts. A mid-range Analytical Engine called for an estimated
50,000 parts and the complexity of its mechanisms, control, and behaviour continue
to defy complete analysis. The fabrication of parts stretched manufacturing capa-
bility to its limits: intricate shapes, achievable precision, standardisation and
reproducibility were issues that frustrated advancement.
The features embodied in the Analytical Engine designs are simply dazzling. At
an operational level the Engine was capable of conditional branching, iterative
looping, and microprogramming, though neither Babbage nor his contemporaries
used these anachronistic terms. At systems level it had a separate Store (Memory)
and Mill (central processor), a serial fetch-execute cycle, punched card input for
data and instructions, an internal repertoire of automatically executed operations,
and parallel processing using multiple processors. At user-level it was pro-
grammable using punched cards [3, 5].
So how did Babbage represent and describe the unprecedented structural com-
plexity of the mechanisms and their time-dependent behaviour? Other devices of
the day—clocks, steam engines, locomotives, textile machines—were simple in
comparison, and were describable using the established representational forms:
textual description, and conventional pen-and-ink drafting.
33.2
Mechanical Notation
In the case of Babbage’s engines the shape and size of parts, and their organisation
into mechanisms, were depicted in mechanical drawings using contemporary
conventions familiar to us today: plan views, front and end elevations in mainly
third-angle projections [6]. There are some 500 such drawings describing the
Analytical Engine alone [7]. The information content is essentially spatial and
Babbage called these drawings Forms. There is nothing radical or revolutionary
about the Forms—they conform to familiar drafting conventions of the day.
Babbage quickly found that the intricate mechanisms and long trains of action
were impossible to hold in his mind at once. He wrote that keeping track of the
multitude of parts and their relationship to one another ‘would have bafﬂed the most
tenacious memory’ [8]. His solution was the ‘Mechanical Notation’, a language of
signs and symbols of his own devising that he used to formalise the description of
his machines and its mechanisms. He described, in 1826, the need for such an aid,
and its genesis:
418
D. Swade

The difﬁculty of retaining in the mind all the contemporaneous and successive movements
of a complicated machine, and the still greater difﬁculty of properly timing movements
which had already been provided for, induced me to seek for some method by which I
might at a glance of the eye select any particular part, and ﬁnd at any given time its state of
motion or rest, its relation to the motions of any other part of the machine, and if necessary
trace back the sources of its movement through all its successive stages to the original
moving power. I soon felt that the forms of ordinary language were far too diffuse to admit
of any expectation of removing the difﬁculty, and being convinced from experience of the
vast power which analysis derives from the great condensation of meaning in the language
it employs, I was not long in deciding that the most favourable path to pursue was to have
recourse to the language of signs [9].
When it comes to the power and importance of notation, Babbage has form. As a
mathematics undergraduate at Cambridge he was a vigorous advocate of Leibniz’s
notation for differential calculus in preference to Newton’s which was the estab-
lished Cambridge orthodoxy and resolutely resistant to change. His provocative
campaign in 1811 for the adoption of Leibniz’s form was instrumental in the
founding of the Analytical Society the purpose of which was to reform English
mathematics so as to beneﬁt from new Continental theories favoured by Babbage
and several of his contemporaries [2].
The Mechanical Notation starts with the naming of parts. Each part was assigned
a letter of the alphabet. Various typefaces were used—italicised letters for moving
parts, upright letters for ﬁxed framing pieces, for example, and a variety of
alphabets including Etruscan, Roman, and Script. The kind of part, its intended
motion and function, and its spatial relationship to other parts were indicated by a
suite of up to six indices—superscripts or subscripts deployed around each iden-
tifying letter [10, 11]. Figure 33.1 shows the arrangement—a single identifying
letter for the part, the position of the six indices, and some examples of individual
symbols. Two of the indices are non-numerical: the Sign of Form, and the Sign of
Motion. The Sign of Form indicated the kind or species of part—gear wheel, arm,
lever, spring, rack, shaft, pinion…. These symbols are partly pictograms for ready
recognition of function. The Sign of Motion indicated the nature of motion—
reciprocating, linear or circular, or combinations of these as depicted in a particular
view in the Forms—plan, elevation, or end view.
In 1851 Babbage listed ten symbols in the Alphabet of Motion, and some 80
symbols in the Alphabet of Form and wrote that as many as 200 might be needed
[12]. There are eight different symbols for ‘arm’ in the Alphabet of Form, and this
part appears at ﬁrst sight to be over-determined—difference without distinction.
However, the differences are nuanced and meaningful, and allow differentiation
between an arm that is driven or a driver, for example, whether it acts as a stop in
compression or as a pawl in tension, and so on.
The remaining four indices are numerical. The Linear Position index indicated
the order in which parts might be arranged on a shaft. The Circular Position index
indicated the angular relationship of a part to neighbouring parts. So in a regular
helix, for example, made up of arms on a shaft and arranged with a ﬁxed angular
33
‘Photographing the Footsteps of Time’: Space and Time …
419

displacement between them, the Circular Position index and Linear Position index
would increment by 1 for each arm as the arms progress along the helix. The index
of Identity described whether multiple parts were part of the same ‘piece’ where a
‘piece’ was taken as a single part or combination of parts that together acted on, or
were acted upon by, other parts. The New Alphabet index was a contingency in the
event that one ran out of identifying letters. It was rarely if ever used.
By combining these indexed letters using syntactical rules Babbage was able to
describe the complete causal chain between the prime mover and end result—the
species of each part, its physical relationship to other parts, whether driver or
driven, its generic function, and the nature of motion. He called these diagrams
Trains and they represent a symbolic compression of the inﬂuence of parts on one
another in the transmission of motion. An example is shown in Fig. 33.2.
Here connection and mutual inﬂuence of the 4,000 parts required for a printing
and stereotyping apparatus was compressed onto a single sheet. Tracing the chain
of action is aided by the use of ‘working points’—points of action on each part—
represented by lower case letters, italicised for moving parts and upright for
framework. Working points could be annotated with the same index of identity as
the host part and were used liberally to annotate the Forms. The 4,000 parts of the
calculating section of Difference Engine No. 2, which calculates and tabulates any
7th order polynomial to 31 decimal places, were reduced to 5 modest manuscript
sheets. The Trains were clearly an effective tool of representational reduction.

The direction of ﬂow in the Trains is, in general, from left to right (except where
there is feedback). So while time is not explicit, succession in time is implied by the
order in which parts appear in the chain. But the Trains do not contain an exact
description of time-dependent behaviour. There is a third element in the suite of
descriptive tools that does this. Babbage called these timing diagrams Cycles which
show what state any given part is at a particular point in the cycle, what action it is
in the process of performing as well as contemporaneous actions of all other parts
represented.
An example of a Cycle is shown in Fig. 33.3 which depicts the repeated pipe-
lined addition of two multi-digit numbers with conditional carriage of tens. The
operational cycle was typically divided into time units along a vertical axis, and the
name of parts was arrayed horizontally across the heads of columns.
New notational conventions were used to indicate the action of each part and the
timing of actions in relation to other parts. Annotations at the head and tail of an
arrow, for example, indicate features of motion: whether the direction of rotation is
positive or negative, circular or linear, and whether or not the motion returned the
part to its rest position. Other conventions indicate whether motion is continuous or
intermittent, conditional or unconditional, in what time window it can occur, and so
on. The Cycles show the orchestration of the action of individual parts to make a
functioning whole.
Babbage’s son, Henry Prevost, who had mastered the Notation, described the
difﬁculty of grasping the actions of parts too numerous and too fast to follow in real
time. He wrote that “the Mechanical Notation revealed even its most ﬂeeting
movements. It had, as it were, photographed the footsteps of time…” [13].

Earlier, Dionysius Lardner, an indefatigably colourful populariser of science,
captured the idea of the abstractive power of the Notation when he wrote, ‘what
algebra is to arithmetic, the notation… is to mechanism’ [14].
The three elements, Forms, Cycles, and Trains describe, respectively, Space,
Time, and Connection and were collectively, though loosely, referred to as the
Mechanical Notation. They work as does a three-legged stool, each indispensible to
the whole. Babbage made few concessions to his successors, leaving little in the
way of explanatory text. What there is in the way of descriptive commentary is
fragmented, haphazard, and all too often obscure. Instead, our knowledge of his
work is informed largely by the Forms, Cycles and Trains of his Mechanical
Notation and it is on this symbolic encoding of design that we primarily rely for an
understanding of his work.
Babbage was inordinately proud of the Notation which he regarded as his
greatest contribution to knowledge. He saw it as a universal language with appli-
cation beyond science and engineering. Two examples he gave of its extended use
were the circulation of blood in birds and the deployment of armies in battle. The
Notation represented a ﬁrst level of abstraction and he used it extensively as a

design aid—to optimise timing, identify redundancy, derive new motions from
existing ones, and manipulate long chains of events in an abstract shorthand all his
own. However, the fate of the Notation, baroque in its intricacy and idiosyncrati-
cally novel, has been largely one of obscurity. It was used by few others and was
not adopted as the indispensable tool of engineering training that Babbage was sure
it was destined to be.
The Notation pre-echoes what we would now call a ‘hardware description lan-
guage’ (HDL). Such languages rose again to prominence in the early 1970s to
manage complexity in computer circuit and system design, particularly for inte-
grated circuits where higher-order representation was used to manage vast and
complex detail. Babbage had adopted the same route driven by the same imperative
—a symbolic language to manage otherwise unmanageable complexity at the
component level—the same solution to the challenges of complexity 150 years
apart.
33.3
Memory and Time-Dependence
The design of the Analytical Engine was sufﬁciently advanced by 1837 for Babbage
to write ‘programs’ though he did not use that term but referred to his step-wise
sequences of operations as ‘Notations of Calculations’. Between 1837 and 1840
Babbage wrote twenty-four such programs for a variety of problems—solutions for
simultaneous equations of various kinds, and three examples of series calculated
using recurrence relations requiring the iteration of the same set of operations [15].
Number values in Babbage’s machines are represented by the rotation of geared
wheels, called ﬁgure wheels, engraved with numbers 0–9. These wheels are acted
on by the engine’s internal control mechanisms to execute computational rules. It is
the ‘physicalisation’ of quantity in a material medium that allows machines to
compute at all, which they do by manipulating the physical representations of
numbers according to rules. The logical relations in a mathematical statement can
be seen as timeless or, arguably, even atemporal. But once physicalised in a
machine, actions are necessarily subject to physics and mechanics in ways that logic
is not: actions need to be phased in time, measures need to be taken to ensure the
integrity of representation and control, and the algorithmic sequence needs to be a
correct encoding of the problem.
The ‘physicalisation’ of memory had unexpected implications for the earliest
programs. The Store of the Analytical Engine consists of columns of ﬁgure wheels
that represent multi-digit number values with the least signiﬁcant digit at the bottom
and the most signiﬁcant digit at the top. Babbage called these stacks of ﬁgure-wheel
‘Variables’ to convey that the contents of column changed. It is not the case that the
Variable (qua column) is assigned to a ‘variable’ in the conventional mathematical
sense or that this assignment necessarily holds throughout the computation. Rather,
33
‘Photographing the Footsteps of Time’: Space and Time …
423

a Variable is closer to what we would now call a ‘register’—a memory location that
holds changing data. The Variables in the Store are numbered sequentially, V1, V2,
V3, …. Data are directed from the Store to the Mill, operated on, and results
returned to the Store. Where in the store the data is placed is determined by a
Variable Card—a punched paste-board card that indicates in which Store Variable
the data to be operated on is to be found, and in which Variable the results are to be
returned [3, 5].
Babbage’s programs consisted of a numbered sequence of instructions from the
built-in repertoire of operations (the four arithmetical functions) that could be
automatically executed. In using conventional mathematical notation he ran into an
immediate problem. The statement V4 −V1 = V4, for example, meant ‘subtract the
contents of V1 from contents of V4 and put the result in V4’. The operation uses the
value in V4 in a subtraction and overwrites the original value in V4 with the result.
In this way V4 is reused by replacing its contents. The difﬁculty was that ‘V4 −
V1 = V4’ was uncomfortable for mathematicians who would instinctively read it as
a mathematical statement that was patently false for all non-zero values of V1 and
trivial in the case of V1 being zero. To a mathematician the statement seemed an
offence to the notion of mathematical identity denoted by the ‘=’ sign. Babbage’s
solution was to add a leading index to indicate alteration. The statement would then
read, 1V4 −1V1 = 2V4. The leading superscript (index of alteration) indicated that
the value of the Variable had changed during the operation. The trailing index
(index of location) remained as before, denoting the place in the Store of the
Variable in question. Each new reuse of the Variable would increment the index of
alteration by 1 and the history of the contents of the Variable could be traced back
through the chain of program steps.
The need for solution arose because memory, for the ﬁrst time in a computing
machine, had spatial location, and instructions, expressed in standard mathematical
notation, did not reﬂect time-dependence. The very ﬁrst program Babbage wrote,
dated 4 August 1837, has a sequence of instructions for the solution of two
simultaneous equations. It features the double index to show the reuse of Variables
though, strangely, he ﬁrst used Roman numerals for the index of alteration, later
changing these to more familiar Arabic numbers [16, 17]. This ﬁrst program
prophetically ﬂagged a more general ﬁnding—that coding would require new
notational conventions, as indeed turned out to be the case.
33.4
Interplay of Time and Space
The Mechanical Notation, and the notation for the reuse of Variables, were
responses to the need to describe complex time-dependent machine behaviour, and
their purpose is essentially representational. There is interplay of time and space of
a different kind that occurs in design—in the ways in which the physical medium of
devices and systems can be manipulated to perform what it is we wish them to do.
424
D. Swade

In a rare description of the Analytical Engine Babbage wrote:
It is impossible to construct machine occupying unlimited space; but it is possible to
construct ﬁnite machinery, and to use it through unlimited time. It is this substitution of the
inﬁnity of time for the inﬁnity of space which I have made use of, to limit the size of the
engine and yet to retain its unlimited power [18].
Babbage appears to be claiming that he had succeeded in trading off space and
time against each other and that through this exchange the necessary physical limits
of a machine did not compromise the scope of its capabilities. He takes some
trouble to argue the case. Even though the Variables in the Analytical Engine are
limited to 50 digits, he argued, this did not restrict the size of the largest numbers
that can be computed: arbitrarily large numbers could be broken up into 50-digit
segments and distributed across several Variables and operated on to produce
extended-precision results. The price of course is extended computing time and he
calculates the increase in execution time for the compound calculation involving
large numbers expressed in multiple runs of 50 digits.
He also argued that a physical machine did not need inﬁnite memory for
unlimited capacity. With the Store of the Analytical Engine featuring up to 1,000
Variables—a large but ﬁnite number—he argued that Variables that were no longer
required could have their contents printed or even punched and the Variables then
reused—perhaps the ﬁrst description of a memory dump. He also put the case that
the size of a program was not limited by the number of punched cards as the
number of Operation Cards, as he called them, could be indeﬁnitely large and
‘follow each other in unlimited succession’—a remarkable pre-echoing of the
endless tape posited by Turing in his 1936 description of a Turing Machine.
The manner in which Babbage states the space-time trade-off has the ring of
general principle though the case he makes in places is contingent on the particular
features of the Analytical Engine. There are examples of the space-time trade-off
that are less seemingly a priori in several other instances where using a different
mechanical principle reduced execution time. In 1837 Babbage wrote of his Ana-
lytical Engine, ‘the whole history of the invention has been a struggle against time’
[19]. He was not referring to permanent overruns in the delivery date for a working
machine, but to his unrelenting commitment to reducing the time taken to perform a
computational operation, and he went to extraordinary lengths to achieve this.
In the design of Difference Engine 1 and 2 Babbage used a ‘successive carriage’
technique for the carriage of tens in arithmetical addition. In the difference engines
the number value in a complete column of ﬁgure wheels is added to an adjacent
column with the addition taking place for all digits at the same time i.e. simulta-
neous parallel multi-digit addition. However, the carriage of tens is not executed
during this ﬁrst phase of the addition. Rather, if a given digit wheel exceeds ten
during the addition, a latch is set (a one-bit memory) to warn that for that digit there
is a carriage of ten yet to be performed and that the next higher digit needs to be
incremented by 1. In the next stage of the cycle each of the latches is automatically
33
‘Photographing the Footsteps of Time’: Space and Time …
425

polled in turn. If the latch is warned, then the next higher digit wheel is incre-
mented. If the latch is not warned, no action is taken. The polling of the latches
ripples up the ﬁgure wheel stack executing carries as needed in strict serial order
conditional on whether or not the latch is set. Since in this serial process the polling
of the latches is slightly staggered, the time taken for the carriage of tens is pro-
portional to the number of digits in the column i.e. the higher the digit precision, the
longer it takes to perform a full addition. The polling arrangement takes account of
secondary carries—carries that result from carries—without time penalty [6].
The time demands for successive carriage were tolerable for the difference
engines which required only repeated addition to implement the method of ﬁnite
differences. But in the Analytical Engine, where direct multiplication and division
were irreducibly more time-consuming, the successive carriage technique became
an unaffordable extravagance. Babbage set out to design a new mechanism on a
different principle that would make ‘an unlimited number of carriages in one unit of
time’ [20]. The result was his ‘anticipating carriage’ mechanism, akin to a modern
‘carry look-ahead’ technique, which was capable of executing all requisite carries in
a single operation. He recalled that the ‘exhilaration of the spirits’ he felt at his
success could not be rivalled by the excellent champagne of his host with whom he
had later dined on the day he cracked the problem. He regarded the anticipating
carriage mechanism as ‘the most important part of the Analytical Engine’ though it
is arguable whether this was indeed so, given the proliﬁc number of its other
remarkable features [3, 5, 20].
The anticipating carriage mechanism is an example of how a new mechanical
principle and a more ingenious spatial conﬁguration of parts produced economies of
time. There are many other examples in the engine designs and also of trade-offs in
the opposite direction. Babbage’s ‘half zero’ technique, for example, reduced by up
to half the time taken to return a ﬁgure wheel to zero whatever its initial position.
The price was more parts and a more complex control and timing mechanism but
the beneﬁt was found in reduced execution time. The printing mechanism in the
Scheutz difference engine is an inverse example. Scheutz used an eccentric drum to
drive print heads into stiff cardboard to impress numerical results in deep relief to
create a mould from which to make printing plates. The forces are excessive as
required to make deep cuts and Scheutz’s method takes much longer than does
Babbage’s which though quick, is incapable of impressing anything harder that than
soft plaster [4].
These examples suggest that the earliest computing engines stretched our ability
to represent and effectively manage complexity and time-dependent behaviour.
They also remind us that creative ingenuity has a role in trade-offs between space
and time—part of the tantalising appeal of engineering design, and one of its great
rewards.

The Black Hole in Mathematics
Alexander Keewatin Dewdney
The main activity of research mathematicians is to search for new and interesting
theorems. Until 1930 mathematicians had always assumed that if a mathematical
statement was true, there must be a proof for it. But in that year, the logician Kurt
Gödel showed that there exist theorems that, while true, could never be proved.
They exist in a kind of mathematical black hole from which nothing—no proof—
can ever emerge.
Certain mathematical impossibilities are not of this type. For example, squaring
the circle, ﬁnding a ruler-and-compass construction of a square that has the same
area as a given circle, is now known to be impossible.
If a mathematician ever succeeded in squaring the circle, the following statement
would soon appear in a leading journal:
Theorem: Pi is a constructable number.
The term constructable means that the number in question is the length of a line
segment that can be constructed with ruler and compass. Unfortunately, no one has
been able to square the circle. It was the German mathematician, Ferdinand Lin-
demann who, in 1882 proved a theorem that forever ruled out the possibility that pi
is constructable:
Theorem: Pi is a transcendental number.
Another theorem tells us that no transcendental number is constructable.
Transcendental numbers are not algebraic and therefore not constructable, either.
Mathematicians tend to accept such limitations philosophically. After all, a theorem
is a theorem, and once it has been proved, that’s it. But imagine a limitation on our
ability to prove theorems. What if not all theorems are provable?

When mathematicians encounter a statement they think might be true, they call it
a conjecture, then attempt to prove it. Or they may try to disprove it by ﬁnding a
counterexample. If the conjecture says that every object with property A also has
property B, they may hunt for an example of an object with property A that does not
have property B.
Conjectures are both famous and infamous in mathematics. Our inability to
prove them may seem insurmountable until some bright young wizard ﬁnds the
proof that had eluded everyone else—or ﬁnds a counter-example. Conjectures
inspire much research and so play a valuable role in the development of mathe-
matics. But should one of the conjectures currently before mathematics happen to
be true yet have no proof, then a truckload of young wizards would not sufﬁce to
prove it. Yet it would be true.
Perhaps an unprovable theorem would involve concepts far beyond our ability to
understand. (Who knows?) Or perhaps an unprovable theorem would involve
obscure, grotesque, or utterly unappealing content. (Who cares?) Or perhaps an
unprovable theorem might be both easy to understand and involve an interesting
proposition. Perhaps the conjecture made by the German mathematician Christian
Goldbach in 1742 is both true and unprovable. That would be something!
Goldbach’s conjecture declares that every even number greater than 2 is the sum
of two odd prime numbers. Going on 300 years, mathematicians have yet to prove
the conjecture (which would automatically make it Goldbach’s theorem) or to ﬁnd a
counterexample. Yet the conjecture seems to be true. Give me an even number such
as 142 and it will not take me long to ﬁnd two primes that have 142 as their sum.
Let’s see. How about 59 and 83?
What we used to call “Fermat’s Last Theorem” was, until recently, actually
unproven. But in 1998, a young Cambridge mathematician named Andrew Wiles
proved what we may now call a “theorem:” An equation of the form,
xn + yn = zn
has no solution for any value of n > 2.
Will Goldbach’s conjecture go the way of Fermat’s? Or does it lurk somewhere
in a mathematical black hole? Do true but unprovable theorems exist? If such a
thing could be proved, it would be a theorem, to be sure, and a metatheorem, at that.
Such a theorem would have seemed incredible to the Greeks, as well as to the
Indian and Arab mathematicians who followed them, no less to the Europeans up to
the end of the nineteenth century. Yet this is exactly what the twentieth-century
mathematician Kurt Gödel proved in 1930.
There is a back door to Gödel’s theorem: either there exist unprovable theorems
or the standard arithmetic is inconsistent. Gödel’s theorem is about the “standard
arithmetic,” a term I will explain later, but which is merely a formalized portion of
the mathematics we all learned in elementary school. In short, either there are
theorems that our mathematics is simply not capable of dealing with, or our
mathematics is itself inconsistent.

A.K. Dewdney

From the Greeks to the Europeans, to all the world’s mathematicians in the year
1900, nothing would have been more disturbing than the idea of an unprovable
theorem—unless it was an inconsistency within mathematics itself. The story of this
amazing result begins in the year 1900. The setting is Paris, the Second Interna-
tional Congress of Mathematicians. It was an ideal time for one of the world’s
leading researchers to set the agenda for a new century. The German mathematician
David Hilbert challenged his worldwide audience with twenty-three problems. The
ﬁrst two of these would have a profound inﬂuence on Kurt Gödel, whose birth lay
six years in the future.
34.1
The Ghosts of Inﬁnity
The ﬁrst problem was to prove the continuum hypothesis, formulated some sixteen
years earlier by another German mathematician, Georg Cantor. As a result of his
groundbreaking conceptual invasion of inﬁnity during the years 1871 to 1884,
Cantor had formulated a new system of inﬁnite numbers with a strange arithmetic
all their own. The ﬁrst of these was written ℵ0 and called aleph nought. It was the
cardinality (inﬁnite, to be sure) of the natural numbers, or counting integers. If the
members of any inﬁnite set could be paired off with the numbers 1, 2, 3, … and so
on forever, that set has ℵ0 members. The second number, ℵ1 (aleph one), stood for
the cardinality of the set of real numbers. If the members of an inﬁnite set could be
paired off with the real numbers, that set would have ℵ1 members.
The continuum hypothesis, as formulated by Cantor, stated that every subset of
the real numbers either had cardinality ℵ1 or had cardinality ℵ0. There was nothing
in between the two numbers. Every attempt to construct a set of real numbers that
was not in one-to-one correspondence with either the integers or with the real
numbers met with failure.
Thus was born the new ﬁeld of transﬁnite arithmetic, with its ﬁrst two numbers,
ℵ0 and ℵ1. However, it was not until 1891 that Cantor was able to prove that the
transﬁnite numbers ℵ0 and ℵ1 were different! To understand Cantor’s proof of this
result we need one or two mental tools.
The power set of a set is simply the set of all subsets of the set. For example, the
power set of the ﬁnite set A = {1, 2, 3} consists of eight sets, namely {1, 2, 3}
itself, as well as {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1}, {2}, {3}, and the empty set. We can
write the power set of A as 2A.
The new system of transﬁnite arithmetic was justiﬁed, in part, by Cantor’s 1891
theorem, a humble but profound result: Speciﬁcally, he showed that no pairing or
one-to-one correspondence could exist between the real numbers and the integers
themselves. His method of proof involved a type of argument that was new to the
mathematics of the day but that later would play a key role in Gödel’s theorem. His
argument used diagonalization, a process that singled out the main diagonal of
entries in an inﬁnite table. His proof is simple enough to be presented here.
34
The Black Hole in Mathematics
431

Suppose that a one-to-one correspondence could be found between Z and its
power set, 2Z. It could then be written as a function f that, for every integer k, would
produce a set f(k) of integers. As the variable k ran through the integers 1, 2, 3, and
so on, the function f would run through the subsets of Z, all of them, sooner or later.
Cantor then examined a very special set that consisted of all the integers z that were
not members of their corresponding set f(z).
This was a peculiar thing to do. If we made a vast table with the integers down
one side and the subsets of Z across the top, every entry of the table would consist
of a pairing between an integer and a subset of Z. It would be natural, in such a
table, to place the pairs z, f(z) down the main diagonal. That, at least, accounts for
the name “diagonal argument.”
Some of the integers z will appear inside their corresponding subsets f(z) and
some won’t. If we take the set of all integers z that are not members of f(z) and place
them in a special set W, we can ask a very serious question about W: To what
integer does W correspond under this scheme? If we write that integer as w, we can
ask if w belongs to W. If w belonged to W, then w would not be a member of f(w)
by the deﬁnition of W. But wait! This is a contradiction, since W = f(w). On the
other hand, if w were not a member of W, then w must lie in f(w) (i.e., W), another
contradiction.
What has gone wrong? We got into this mess by assuming that there was a
function f with the stated property. The assumption must therefore be wrong. There
is no one-to-one association between integers and all subsets of the integers. Hence
there is no one-to-one correspondence between the integers and the real numbers. It
immediately follows that ℵ0 and ℵ1 cannot have the same cardinality and that the
distinction between them is real. The question that would immediately suggest itself
did so to Cantor. Was there yet another transﬁnite number between ℵ0 and ℵ1? The
“continuum hypothesis remains unresolved to this day.
In his 1900 address to the world mathematical community, Hilbert proposed that
resolving the continuum hypothesis was problem one. He also wished to resolve a
another question that had been simmering on back burners (and a few front ones)
for a decade or more: Could arithmetic be axiomatized in such a way as to guar-
antee the exclusion of any and all inconsistencies?
34.2
Consistency
By the turn of the nineteenth century, mathematicians had become aware that deep
questions attended the simplest-seeming subject: arithmetic. In particular, the
attempt to axiomatize arithmetic had led, in some cases, to the recognition of logical
anomalies.
For example, in 1888 the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano had introduced
a set of ﬁve axioms that characterized the natural numbers (positive integers). They
were nothing if not simple.
432
A.K. Dewdney

1. 1 is a natural number.
2. If a is a natural number, so is a + 1.
3. If a and b are natural numbers and a = b, then a + 1 = b + 1.
4. If a is a natural number, then a + 1 ≠1.
These statements will trouble few readers. From these axioms, with the aid of a
ﬁfth axiom that Peano would employ for the deductive process itself, all the
properties of the natural numbers could be derived.
For example, from these axioms it was possible to prove the associative law that
for all natural numbers a, b, and c, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
This law justiﬁes something that people do all the time: It makes no difference in
what order numbers are added. The ﬁfth axiom would prove troublesome. By
allowing a set to be arbitrary, it implicitly included a very nasty set that consisted of
all sets whatsoever.
5. If A is a set and 1 lies in A, and if for every natural number a in A, a + 1 also
lies in A, then all natural numbers lie in A.
Known as the principle of induction, this axiom was meant simply as a formal
statement of a major tool for working with natural numbers. As long as mathe-
maticians using the axiom of induction do not invoke the monstrous set of all sets,
they are safe. This bizarre object seemed to spew out anomalies and downright
contradictions. The “set of all sets” sounds almost like a spiritual entity.
In 1893, the German logician Gottlieb Frege published the ﬁrst volume of his
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, a rigorous formulation of arithmetic that appealed to
the same concept, the set of all sets. The English logician Bertrand Russell was at
ﬁrst unaware of the anomaly and championed the work of Frege, whose unnec-
essarily difﬁcult book had attracted few readers. But as Frege’s second volume was
about to appear, Russell discovered to his horror that a severe logical ﬂaw underlay
the entire work.
The set of all sets contains some nasty items. My vain attempt to render the
situation graphically appears here.
34
The Black Hole in Mathematics
433

It is surely no more difﬁcult to conceive of sets that are not members of
themselves than it is to conceive of sets that are. I will use my favorite nonsense
word for such sets: “gzernmplatz.” I will go farther and deﬁne G to be the set of all
gzernmplatz sets. Now I come, as Russell did, to the key question: Is G gzernm-
platz? Even an amateur logician could work a proof, perhaps something like this:
suppose G is gzernmplatz. Then G must lie within the set of all gzernmplatz sets,
namely G. Thus G is a member of itself. Whoops! I guess G can’t be gzernmplatz
after all. It follows that G is not in the set G and, therefore, not a member of itself.
So G must be gzernmplatz. Whoops again! Has mathematics suddenly become
inconsistent under my feet? Does a black hole await me?
The impact on Frege’s second volume was devastating, and the Grundgesetze
was nearly forgotten. There was a growing awareness of difﬁculties in axiom
systems, in the tendency for paradoxes to leap out from the shadows of the subject.
It also had been extremely difﬁcult to prove even the simplest of ﬁelds, such as
arithmetic, consistent. No one knew if serious contradictions might someday appear
in our reasoning about numbers.
The dream of a purely logical formulation of mathematics itself, became the
passion not only of Hilbert but also of Bertrand Russell and his English colleague
Alfred North Whitehead. In 1910 Russell and Whitehead published the ﬁrst volume
of Principia Mathematica, a strict formulation of mathematics in terms of a purely
logical system that involved both propositions and predicates.
In the Principia Russell and Whitehead clearly demonstrated that not only could
mathematics—or signiﬁcant portions of it—be reduced to logic, but also that all
mathematical truths were ultimately logical truths. Here was the vehicle that
mathematicians could ride in search of consistency. Simply demonstrate that the
axioms of the Principia could never lead to an inconsistency or contradiction.
In 1923, Hilbert rode forth to the lists with a new program of action that he
called Beweisstheorie, or the theory of proofs. He published the proposal in a paper
and followed up at many talks and conferences to promote the idea. But the current
climate of logical uncertainly had rattled him. Speaking at a conference in June of
that year, he declared paradoxes as “intolerable.”
In a nutshell, Hilbert proposed the reduction of mathematics to a symbolic
script—marks on paper, as it were. A proof would amount to a sequence of for-
mulas, each derivable by purely logical (and symbolic) operations from one or more
of its predecessors, each leading inexorably to the ﬁnal formula, a statement of the
theorem being proved. Following in the footsteps of Russell and Whitehead, he cast
his ideas in predicate logic. Hilbert’s system began with so-called atomic formulas,
the simplest combinations of variables and constants, then proceeded to statements
or well-formed formulas that were themselves composed of atomic formulas, log-
ical connectives, and quantiﬁers of the type discussed above.
434
A.K. Dewdney

An example of a well-formed formula in mathematics would be
∀x ∃y s. t. ðx < yÞ & ðx + 1 > yÞ.
This rather compact notation may be interpreted as follows:
“For all x there exists a y such that x is less than y and x + 1 is greater than y.” The
symbols ∀and ∃are the same quantiﬁers we discussed earlier. Their role is to specify
for each variable under their jurisdiction, whether the formula is to be true for all
values or at least one of them, respectively. The & symbol is an example of a logical
connective, and the expressions “x < y” and “x + 1 > y” are examples of atomic
formulas. The whole point of predicate logic was that it amounted to a language in
which axiom systems and theorems for various areas of mathematics could be
expressed. This language became the focus of interest in the newly emerging ﬁeld that
Hilbert called “metamathematics.” It would interest young Gödel profoundly.
34.3
The Troublemaker
Kurt Gödel was born in 1906, the second son of Rudolph and Marianne Gödel in
Brno, a city in the Moravian part of Czechoslovakia. Although living in Cze-
choslovakia, the Gödels always considered themselves German. Rudolph Gödel
was a successful businessman in the textile industry. In a privileged but highly
structured household, young Kurt ﬂourished academically. He graduated from High
School in 1924 and was sent to study at the University of Vienna.
Gödel began in physics but found himself increasingly attracted to mathematics.
While taking courses in physics, he would read the classic works of Euclid, Euler,
and others. Gödel examined mathematics from a philosophical point of view,
reading Kant and Russell as well. Indeed, his interest in mathematics was sparked
even more strongly by attending a weekly seminar conducted by the philosopher
Moritz Schlick. Sometime that year, Gödel met Hans Hahn, a prominent Viennese
mathematician. Hahn had recently turned his attention to the foundations of
mathematics. It may have been Hahn who suggested that Gödel attend another
special weekly seminar, later to be called Der Wiener Kreis (the Vienna Circle). It
was there that Gödel heard the crucial logical issues of the day discussed.
By 1927, Gödel was hopelessly involved in mathematical issues and questions.
The Vienna Circle had brought him to the heart of difﬁcult and important mathe-
matical questions. He read and attended lectures. He walked the streets of Vienna
alone or with colleagues. He sat for hours in various coffeehouses discussing
mathematics. In 1928 Gödel had ﬁnished his undergraduate work and by 1929 was
already hard at work on his Ph.D. thesis, an attempt to show that predicate logic was
complete. In 1929 Hilbert and his colleague Willheim Ackermann had published
their Grundzuge der Theoretischen Logik. In his thesis, Gödel succeeded in proving
that the logical system suggested by Hilbert and Ackermann was complete. Gödel
showed that every valid formula (true expression) was derivable within the system.
34
The Black Hole in Mathematics
435

He began by reducing the problem of proving completeness to showing that each
formula within Hilbert’s system was either satisﬁable or refutable. He established
the latter result, in turn, by using induction.
It was an impressive performance from someone so young. But the result sur-
prised no one. Everyone expected Hilbert’s system to be complete.
34.4
The Trouble
The “habilitation” denotes a second hurdle that had to be leaped by all aspiring
academics in Continental universities. It was not enough to write and defend a
thesis. If one expected employment at an institution of higher learning, one had to
publish something of note after the thesis. For his habilitation paper Gödel chose to
work on Hilbert’s second problem, that of showing the consistency of arithmetic. It
would undoubtedly be more difﬁcult than the proof that predicate logic was con-
sistent and inﬁnitely more difﬁcult than the proof that propositional logic was
consistent. That result had been achieved by Emil Post, a mathematician at New
York’s City College in 1921. The propositional calculus is the simplest form of
logic, essentially a subject ﬁrst codiﬁed by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C. The
“propositions” are merely symbols such as a, b, and c, which stand for ﬁxed
statements that contain no variables. Two propositions could be conjoined logically
by either the “and” operator or the “or” operator.
In their classic Principia Mathematica, Russell and Whitehead gave axioms for
the propositional calculus. Instead of the “and” connective, however, they used
implication, symbolized by the double arrow, ⇒. The expression a ⇒b, or “a
implies b,” is understood at the outset to be logically equivalent to ∼a v b.
1. (p v p) ⇒p
2. p ⇒(p v p)
3. (p v q) ⇒(q v p)
4. (p ⇒q) ⇒[(p v r) ⇒(q v r)]
Each axiom in this system seems either harebrained or mildly insane. Axiom 2,
for example, says that if a proposition p is true, then either p is true or p is true.
There is, in any event, very little to argue with in the axioms.
The consistency of propositional logic may be proved by supposing that it is
possible to derive two contradictory statements, T and ∼T, from the axioms.
Suppose then that we have discovered a disastrous proposition T such that T
and ∼T are both true. We may use an additional tool of propositional logic, the
principle of substitution, replacing a proposition symbol with T.
T ⇒ð ∼T ⇒qÞ.
Since T is true, we may use the rule of detachment to establish that ∼T ⇒q is
also true. But ∼T is also true, and we may use the rule of detachment to show that q
436
A.K. Dewdney

is also true. But q can be any proposition whatever. The assumption of a contra-
dictory pair of propositions had therefore led to the conclusion that all propositions
are true, including the negations of the axioms themselves. It follows from this
contradiction that no such pair of contradictory statements or propositions can be
derived within propositional logic, and the foundations are secured. It is consistent.
This example also serves to illustrate an important distinction between two kinds
of reasoning. You will notice that our treatment of propositional logic involved
proofs inside the system and proofs outside the system. The derivation of the
theorem p ⇒(∼p v q), like all theorems of propositional calculus, was proved
within the system by applying the rules of substitution and detachment, but the
proof of consistency was proved outside the system. Our reasoning was no less
formal, but there was no way to express it as a sequence of propositions, each
derived logically from previous propositions in the sequence. In short, there was no
way to express the assumption about T. The distinction is fundamental to meta-
mathematics. We will see it made again when we consider Gödel’s amazing
theorem.
It is still a long way from showing the consistency of propositional logic to that
of predicate logic when applied to arithmetic. For one thing, propositional logic is
silent on the subject of arithmetic. Numbers cannot be expressed within it. Gödel
began by trying to prove that arithmetic, as expressed in the logical framework of
the Principia, was consistent. In seeking to express the consistency of arithmetic,
however, he discovered that he could express this consistency within arithmetic
itself. Not only that, but this very expression led directly to a theorem that could not
be derived within the logical system of Russell and Whitehead. After setting up the
axioms of a predicate logic that embodied what is called the standard arithmetic,
Gödel drew up a list of all the symbols used and assigned a special code number to
each symbol, as shown in the following table:
Symbol
Code number
Symbol

The symbol that resembles the letter L rotated on its head stands for implication
in the predicate calculus. Thus A ˥ B means simply that A implies B or that B can
be deduced from A. The symbol s is the successor function. When applied to a
natural number, it yields the next number in sequence. Because each formula would
have to be expressed by a single, unique number, Gödel would need a way of
34
The Black Hole in Mathematics
437

boiling all the numbers that represented a given formula down into one number that
would encode not only all the number symbols of the formula simultaneously, but
also their order.
Gödel achieved this trick by using consecutive prime numbers such as
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, . . .
each raised to a certain power. The power used would depend on the position of the
symbol in the formula. If a symbol x appeared as the seventh symbol in a formula,
for example, it would be represented by a 9 (the symbol for x) raised to the 17th
power (the 7th prime in the sequence).
Thus if Gödel wanted to translate the formula (axiom) into a single number, he
would ﬁrst replace every symbol by its numerical code:
9, 10, 3, 2, 9, 10, 10, 5, 2, 6, 9, 10, 3, 9, 10, 10, 7.
In this case he would obtain the seventeen integers listed above. Next he would
raise the ﬁrst seventeen prime numbers to these powers and multiply them all
together, the raised decimal points representing ordinary multiplication.
29.310.53.72.119.1310.1710.195.232.296.319.3710.413.439.4710.5310.597
The resulting number is huge but ﬁnite. The encoding procedure could be
speciﬁed as a ﬁnite process that would, given enough time, serve to express any
formula whatever by an integer, no matter how large. It was recognized by the early
metamathematicians that in explorations of the inﬁnite, the best way to stay out of
trouble was to use only ﬁnite tools. A proof in Gödel’s system could, be encoded by
a single integer (called its Gödel number). Conversely, given any positive integer
whatever, there was a ﬁnite procedure for producing either a corresponding formula
or sequence of formulas, complete nonsense, or nothing at all, depending on what
symbols were encoded (or not) and in what order. Thanks to an important theorem
within arithmetic itself, any positive integer can be written as the unique product of
primes, which would represent the given number uniquely. The powers of the
primes could then be translated directly into the corresponding symbols—unless
they happened to be larger than 15. The fact that an arbitrary integer might not
represent a formula was not a problem. But when it did, Gödel knew that no other
integer could represent that formula. Gödel had developed a language that linked
two seemingly different universes, the universe of formulas and the universe of
Gödel numbers, a system of huge integers that each represented one of these
expressions. The very process of thought, as embodied in the formulas, had been
reduced to a cloud of numbers.
438
A.K. Dewdney

Among the formulas that Gödel showed how to construct were ones that would
be typical of theorems and proofs. He had shown how formulas could express the
process of checking that a proof really was a proof.
The Gödel numbers were all, of course, natural numbers, and as such formed
part of the standard arithmetic. This meant that he could construct statements about
the Gödel numbers, just as he could for ordinary integers. Within the standard
arithmetic he could frame predicates that took the Gödel numbers as their subject
matter. Of special interest is a rather complex predicate that I will write in a simple
symbolic form:
Proof (x, y, z)
I have used the traditional variable names instead of x1, x11, and x111 to make the
path into Gödel’s mind a little easier to follow. The interpretation of the predicate
called “proof” depends on knowing that X is a sequence of formulas that allegedly
prove something, while x is the Gödel number of the proof X. Another formula, Y,
has only one variable, and y is its Gödel number. With these elements in mind, the
predicate can be described as saying, x is the Gödel number for the proof X of a
one-variable formula Y with Gödel number y and with the integer z substituted into
it.
In other words, Gödel number aside, X is a proof of Y, with z substituted into it.
If the formula Y is true for this value of z, and if the system is complete in that
every theorem can be proved in it, the proof X will exist, x being its Gödel number.
In this case, of course, the formula Y will be the last formula in the string repre-
sented by X. Under these conditions the predicate called “Proof” will be true.

439

The expression “Proof(x, y, z)” does not belong to the system under study, but to
the metalanguage in which truths about the system are expressed. Yet this short-
hand, “Proof(x, y, z),” refers to a series of formulas that express what it means for X
to be a proof of Y with z substituted into it, an encoding, if you like, of the mental
machinery required to check such a proof. For example, the actual expression
would have predicates that checked that each formula in the proof sequence was
derivable from ones earlier in the same sequence. To spell out the proof-checking
procedure, as long as it amounted to a ﬁnite process, was tantamount to an actual
check. All that machinery within the logical system, along with the proof X of the
formula Y, amounted to an extremely long, but ﬁnite, string of formulas. Conse-
quently that string would itself be a formula and would have its own Gödel number.
The next and most important step that Gödel took was to realize that the formula
Y referred to in the predicate Proof (x, y, z) could have its own Gödel number, y,
substituted into it, instead of the more general variable Z- In other words, Gödel’s
attention now focused on the predicate
Proof(x, y, y)
In this form the predicate is true if x is the Gödel number of a proof that the
formula Y is true when its own Gödel number y is substituted into it. In other
words, the predicate automatically symbolizes all formulas Y within the system that
happen to have a proof X when y (the Gödel number of Y) is substituted into Y.
This seems an odd thing to consider.
At this juncture, Gödel’s breath may have caught as he sensed himself on a
collision course with common sense—or about to enter a black hole. What he did
next was to form a new predicate that denied the existence of such a proof:
∼∃x Proof(x, y, y)
This expression formed an element of the metalanguage that Gödel used to
reason about the logical system under examination, the one that contained the
standard arithmetic of integers. Yet by merely appending the same logical symbols
to the extremely lengthy expression inside the logical system, the one represented
by “Proof(x, y, y)” he now had a ﬁrst-class anomaly on his hands.
The new expression denied the existence of a proof X that the formula Y would
be true with its own Gödel number substituted into it. Yet this new predicate,
considered as a lengthy expression within the system, would have yet another
Gödel number all its own—say, g.
What, asked Gödel, is the status of the predicate ∼∃x Proof(x, g, g)? This
expression asserts that there exists no proof of the predicate symbolized by g,
namely the predicate ∼∃x Proof(x, y, y). If ∼∃x Proof(x, g, g) were true, then no
proof could exist. If ∼∃x Proof(x, g, g) were false then the expression
∃x Proof(x, g, g)
would be true and a proof would exist. But a proof of what? It would be a proof
of ∼∃x Proof(x, y, y), because that’s what g stood for. But a proof of this predicate
would hold for all possible values of y including g, leading Gödel to the inevitable
conclusion that ∼∃x Proof(x, g, g) was indeed true.
Here was the crunch. If the predicate ∃x Proof(x, g, g) were both true and false,
then his logical system—and therefore the standard arithmetic—was inconsistent.
440
A.K. Dewdney

The only way out was to assume that the statement symbolized by g was true. And
that statement had no proof. At the time of his discovery of the famous incom-
pleteness theorem, Gödel was twenty-six. Perhaps because he was not then an
established mathematician, news of the result did not exactly spread like wildﬁre.
At the same time, the colleagues and contacts to whom Gödel communicated his
result most frequently expressed confusion rather than admiration. And yes,
resistance grew—to a point.
34.5
The Aftermath
In August 1930, Gödel met his colleague Rudolph Carnap to plan a trip to a
conference in Konigsberg (today Kaliningrad) in one month’s time. Quietly
announcing his result, Gödel was surprised to discover that Carnap did not quite
follow the argument. But he was conﬁdent that the mathematical world would soon
catch up with him. The conference in Konigsberg was attended by no less than John
von Neumann, a world-renowned mathematician who had published in a great
variety of areas and who took a particular interest in the new metamathematics,
having wrestled with the consistency problem himself. After the talk, von Neumann
congratulated Gödel and inquired further into the stunning new result. Once he fully
understood it, von Neumann suffered a slight ﬁt of pique. Yet his admiration was
genuine, and the desire to promote Gödel’s new result was sincere.
Hilbert, who also attended the conference, apparently had no idea of what was
going on. “For the mathematician there is no ignoramibus, and, in my opinion, not
at all for natural science, either - - - The true reason why [no one] has succeeded in
ﬁnding an unsolvable problem is, in my opinion, that there is no unsolvable
problem. In contrast to the foolish ignoramibus, our credo avers: We must know.
We shall know.”
Hilbert apparently was quite upset about the new theorem and probably some-
what depressed as well. After all, his credo that “we must know” had just been
shattered by the knowledge that unless mathematics was inconsistent, there would
be some things that we would never know, namely, which conjectures might turn
out to be unprovable.
In March of 1931 a formal paper by Gödel appeared in the Monatshejte fur
Mathematik und Physik titled “Uber Formal Unentscheldbare Satze Principia
Mathematica und Verwandter System I” (On Certain Difﬁculties of Proof in the
Principia Mathematica and Related Systems). The new paper slowly made its way
into the collective consciousness of the mathematical world. The following
September Gödel attended a meeting of the German Mathematical Union in Bad
Elster. By now news of the result had made the rounds, and Gödel met his ﬁrst real
opposition in the person of Ernst Zarmelo, the mathematician who had ﬁrst
axiomatized set theory, a subject intimately related to logic. When colleagues
proposed getting Zarmelo to lunch with Gödel, Zarmelo at ﬁrst refused on a sus-
piciously wide variety of grounds: he didn’t like Gödel’s looks; he couldn’t walk
34

that far; if he attended the lunch, there wouldn’t be enough food to go around. His
subsequent hour with Gödel seemed outwardly pleasant, but Zarmelo held such
different views of logic that he did not fully grasp the import of the iincompleteness
theorem.
Other notables also found the result difﬁcult to understand, including the
mathematical philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and even Bertrand Russell, who
expressed gratitude that he no longer worked in mathematical logic. By the
mid-1930s there was barely a mathematician alive who did not know of Gödel’s
theorem and its philosophical implications for mathematics. Most preferred to
ignore the other horn of the dilemma in Gödel’s theorem, that mathematics was
privately plagued by monsters of inconsistency.
Even assuming that mathematics was consistent, it would never be quite the
same. The mere possibility of unprovable theorems has added a third potential
outcome (or non-outcome) in the pursuit of conjectures. Someone will ﬁnd a proof,
someone will ﬁnd a counterexample, or no one will ﬁnd anything, thanks to the
black hole.

Abstract We show how widespread are metamathematical phenomena in mathe-
matics and in the sciences which rely on mathematics. We will consider speciﬁc
examples of undecidable sentences in mathematics, physics and economics. Our pre-
sentation is informal; rigorous developments can be found in the references.
35.1
Introduction
The usual version of a mathematical formalism requires it to be recursive, that
is, computable—at least in principle—by a computer program. In particular, the
axioms, logical and speciﬁc, have to be a recursive set,1 and the rules of inference
must also be recursive.
In a nutshell: one such formalism is essentially an algorithm or a Turing machine,
that is, a program. It involves logic and speciﬁc axioms, being, so to say, an inference
device; its proofs and syntactic procedures are all recursively decidable, in the sense
that we are able to verify if they satisfy the conditions of their (in general) inductive
deﬁnitions.
Gödel’s fundamental idea was to view a (mathematical) formalism as part of arith-
metic via the process of arithmetization, and then to take advantage of this move. His
ﬁrst incompleteness theorem says, in outline, that a consistent formalism containing
enough elementary arithmetic is always incomplete: there are sentences 𝜉such that

neither 𝜉nor ¬𝜉(the negation of 𝜉) are provable in the formalism. His second theo-
rem, that can be proved as a corollary to the ﬁrst, asserts that a consistent formalism,
S, encompassing arithmetic, cannot prove a particular arithmetic sentence that con-
structively expresses the consistency of S.
In consequence, all classical, strong and consistent mathematical theories are
incomplete. As a Gödel says,
The human mind is incapable of formulating (or mechanizing) all its mathematical intu-
itions, i.e., if it has succeeded in formulating some of them, this very fact yields new intu-
itive knowledge, e.g., the consistency of this formalism. This fact may be called the “incom-
pletability” of mathematics. On the other hand, on the basis of what has been proved so far,
it remains possible that there may exist (and even be empirically discoverable) a theorem–
proving machine which in fact is equivalent to mathematical intuition, but cannot be proved
to be so, nor even be proved to yield only correct theorems of ﬁnitary number theory ([13],
p. 324).
Anyhow, according to Gödel, we are able to discover new mathematical truths and
intuitively establish them. Actually we are even able to get to know new reasonable
axioms and to continue more or less systematically the search for truth. Gödel wrote
that:
Despite their remoteness from sense experience, we do have something like a perception
of the objects of set theory, as is seen from the fact that the axioms force themselves upon
us as being true. I dont see any reason why we should have less conﬁdence in this kind
of perception, i.e., in mathematical intuition, than in sense perception...The set theoretical
paradoxes are hardly any more troublesome for mathematics than deception of the senses are
for physics... Evidently, the ‘given’ underlying mathematics is closely related to the abstract
elements contained in our empirical ideas. It by no means follows, however, that the data
of this second kind, because they cannot be associated with actions of certain things upon
our sense organs, are something purely subjective, as Kant asserted. Rather, they, too, may
represent an aspect of objective reality, but, as opposed to the sensations, their presence in
us may be due to another kind of relationship between ourselves and reality ([12], p. 272).
So, one could argue that, in the spirit of Gödels stance, it would be acceptable to
extend the notion of mathematical formalism, eliminating some of its (constructive)
restrictions.
35.1.1
Non-constructive Systems
There is a price one has to pay in order to have complete formal systems.
For example, we may add to the system non-constructive rules of inference that,
if intuitively valid, might be acceptable. Let us consider some examples of the use
of non-constructive rules of inference. If we add to Peano Arithmetic (PA) [16, 21]
the 𝜔–rule,
A(0), A(1), A(2), …
∀x A(x)

35
Gödel Incompleteness and the Empirical Sciences
445
where A(x) is a formula and x a variable, then the new formal system PA∗is syntac-
tically complete: given a sentence 𝜉or its negation ¬𝜉, one of them will be provable
in PA∗.
This extended formalism has, as its theorems, all true sentences of PA, that is,
sentences that are true of the standard model of PA and only them.
The two incompleteness theorems proved by Gödel do not apply to PA∗. Although
PA∗has an intuitive appeal, its notion of proof is not decidable (proofs may be of
inﬁnite length). Since the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem is not valid for PA∗, its con-
cept of proof cannot be constructive (recursive, computable—written as a computer
program). Notwithstanding, PA∗possesses an intuitive interpretation and deserves
to be included in the class of (extended) mathematical formalisms.
Let us now present two examples of incompleteness in axiomatic theories, with a
clear mathematical meaning. (We apologize for the brief mathematical sections, but
we believe that the arguments required are quite simple and easily understood.)
35.2
Gödel Incompleteness: Kleene’s Example
It is frequently said that the example given by Gödel of a sentence which is indepen-
dent of the axioms of arithmetic is contrived, artiﬁcial—and without a clearcut math-
ematical meaning. However it is not so for many examples of undecidable sentences.
Gödel published his milestone paper in 1931; in 1936 Stephen Kleene published one
of the major papers of that period, “General recursive functions of natural numbers”
[15]. In it he oﬀers (among other developments) a simple proof of the Gödel phe-
nomenon (incompleteness of the usual mathematical theories) which moreover has
a clearcut, pedestrian, mathematical interpretation.
Kleene’s argument goes as follows: suppose that S is a theory based on the classi-
cal ﬁrst–order predicate calculus; we also require that S contains enough arithmetic
(it must be able to ‘talk’ about the natural numbers, and their sums and products),
and is such that its theorems can be listed by a computer program (the usual mathe-
matical theories satisfy that last condition).
Start the program that lists all theorems of S. Suppose that fn, all n, are functions
(which can be computed by computer programs) deﬁned on all natural numbers, with
values on them. Then among the theorems of S look for those that assert, “fn is total,”
that is to say, fn is deﬁned on all natural numbers. We thus get a list,
f0, f1, f2, …
of all S–provably total recursive functions2 in the theory.
2Recursive: they can be computed by some computer program.

446
N.C.A. da Costa and F.A. Doria
Make the following arrangement:
f0(0), f0(1), f0(2), f0(3), …
f1(0), f1(1), f1(2), f1(3), …
f2(0), f2(1), f2(2), f2(3), …
f3(0), f3(1), f3(2), f3(3), …
...
Now the trick: deﬁne a function F:
F(0) = f0(0) + 1.
F(1) = f1(1) + 1.
F(2) = f2(2) + 1
...
Then F is diﬀerent from f0 at value 0, from f1 at 1, from f2 at 2, and so on.
We can now conclude our reasoning. Recall that the f0, f1, f2, … functions are
said to be provably total in our theory S, as they appear in the listing of the theory’s
theorems. However F cannot be provably total, since it diﬀers at least once from the
functions we have listed. Yet F is obviously computable, and given programs for the
computation of f0, f1, f2, … we can compute F too.
So the sentence “F is total” cannot be proved in our theory.
Also, if we suppose that the theory is sound, that is, if it doesn’t prove false facts,
then the sentence “F isn’t total” cannot be proved too. Therefore “F is total” is an
undecidable sentence within our theory.
Such is Kleene’s 1936 argument.
35.2.1
Theme and Variations
The preceding discussion is almost completely uninformative about 𝖥: which are
the speciﬁc properties, if any, of that function 𝖥? Is it—diﬀerent, peculiar, in some
sense?
Does it appear in a conventional mathematical environment?
Yes. We’ll learn about it if we take an alternative approach in its construction.
Let’s split our argument into a series of steps:
∙Recall that our theory S, supposed consistent, behaves as a computer program
which is able to list all theorems of S—that is, S has a recursively enumerable set
of theorems.
∙Therefore each proof in S is coded by a natural number, its Gödel number.
∙For another function 𝖥, and for an integer n, the value of 𝖥(n) is given as follows:

35
Gödel Incompleteness and the Empirical Sciences
447
– Consider all k ≤n.
– For S–provably total fe, consider all those whose Gödel number of the proofs of
“fe is total” is smaller or equal to n.
(That is to say, the sentence “fe is total” is a theorem of S whose Gödel number
≤n.)
– Consider the maximum of the values of those functions, that is the maximum
value of fe(k), all k ≤n and all e with bounded proofs as speciﬁed.
– Add 1 to that maximum.
– That value is the value of 𝖥(n).
Such a function is diﬀerent (by construction) from each one of the S–provably
total computable functions. And it also tops all such functions. 𝖥is an intuitively total
computable function that dominates all the S–provably total computable functions.
𝖥is a very fast growing function.3 Actually it is easy to see that there are inﬁnitely
many functions like it—with similar properties when it comes to undecidability; 𝖥
is a kind of minimal such function with respect to S. However S cannot ‘see’ that
such functions are total and computable. Growth rate for such functions cannot be
perceived in S. And this is just the beginning. Out of those functions we can concoct
many strange but mathematically meaningful examples.
Yes. Rather weird results that follow out of the existence of functions like 𝖥are,
for instance:
∙There are inﬁnitely many (actually a whole continuum–sized set of) Liouville tran-
scendental numbers which cannot be proved so, or disproved, by the axioms of set
theory (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, or ZFC).
But a subset of that set of transcendental numbers may be even—intuitively—
described by a computer program which however cannot be proved total in ZFC.
So, we cannot prove that the Liouville numbers intuitively described by that pro-
gram are actually described by it!
∙There is an inﬁnite set of (intuitively) poly machines—Turing machines whose
operation time is bounded by a clock that stops in time bounded by a polynomial
on the binary length of the input—which can neither be proved nor disproved, to
be a set of exclusively poly machines. That set can even be explicitly described by
a computer program.
When we consider major open questions such as the P versus NP problem, which
may require that we deal with a set of poly machines in S like the one just described,
we see how catastrophic that particular example of incompleteness can be.
Function 𝖥sort of codes lots of information about axiom system S. For instance,
S proves the following sentence:
[𝖥is total] →Consis(S).
3But it is recursive! Soon we’ll meet nonrecursive examples of fast–growing functions.

448
N.C.A. da Costa and F.A. Doria
(Implication is strict; the converse doesn’t hold.) Here Consis(S) is the usual Gödel
sentence that asserts the consistency of our axiom system S. So, once we add sentence
“𝖥is total” to our system S, we learn that the combined system:
S + “𝖥is total′′
proves the consistency of S, and as such is strictly stronger than S. (The combined
system S + “𝖥is total′′ is consistent once S is consistent.)
What we see here is the following: Axiomatic theories like S have a deﬁnite bound
on the rates of growth that they can recognize, so to say.
Another point: since “𝖥is total” is independent of the axioms of S, then the sys-
tem:
S + 𝖥isn’t total
is consistent. It is a Σ1–unsound system, or 1–inconsistent system, with many coun-
terintuitive properties. The interested reader is invited to search for them; he will
discover an Alice in Wonderland thematic park in the very heart of classical mathe-
matical logic...
Perhaps someday a gifted and imaginative researcher will guide us through the
wilderness of a 1–inconsistent theory—like the so–called Alice–spacetimes, which
are now being explored in general relativity.
(A good and colorful discussion appears in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-
Wikipedia:Reference-desk/Archives/Mathematics/2009-June-1).
35.2.2
The Busy Beaver Function; The Counterexample
Function to P = NP
Is there one such fast–growing function with a pedestrian meaning? With rele-
vance to a mainstream question in mathematics? Well, the ﬁrst example of this kind
of mathematical monster in a quite innocent–looking environment is Radò’s Busy
Beaver function. Why a monster? It is noncomputable, it grows—absurdly, we may
say—fast, and it dominates all total recursive functions, in an intuitive context. We
refer the interested reader to Radò’s 1962 paper [19].
The second example is equally interesting; it is the counterexample function to
the P = NP hypothesis. We may expand our presentation a bit more here.
We quote an anecdote [10] to motivate it. A long time ago we decided to take
a nonconventional look at the P versus NP problem. It begins in a simple, naïve
question:
Mrs. H is a gentle and able lady who has long been the secretary of a large university depart-
ment. Every semester Mrs. H. is confronted with the following problem: there are courses
to be taught, professors to be distributed among diﬀerent classes of students, large and small
classes, and a shortage of classrooms. She ﬁxes a minimum acceptable level of overlap
among classes and students and sets down in a tentative way to get the best possible schedule

35
Gödel Incompleteness and the Empirical Sciences
449
given that minimum desired overlap. It’s a tiresome task, and in most cases, when there are
many new professors or when the dean changes the classroom allocation system, Mrs. H has
to redo everything again; again she has to check nearly all conceivable schedulings before
she is able to reach a conclusion. In despair she asks a professor whom she knows has a
degree in math: “tell me, can’t you ﬁnd in your math a fast way of scheduling our classes
with a minimum level of overlap among them?”
Roughly, Mrs. H’s problem is a problem where:
∙Once we have a solution, it is very easy to test it.
∙But the known general algorithms to look for a solution are hard, as Mrs. H knows
by experience.
We followed a suggestion given by a top–ranking logician4: we should look at the
counterexample function to the P = NP hypothesis. Our expert hinted that it might
be a fast–growing function.
It is, indeed [4, 6].
P = NP means, there is a time–polynomial Turing machine (a poly machine)5 that
settles all instances of a problem in the NP–class—a problem like the one described
by Mrs. H, our gentle lady. Then the counterexample function is given as follows:
∙List in a computable way all Turing machines. We only require that their Gödel
numbering be monotonic on the length of their tables.
∙Let f be the counterexample function. If n is the Gödel number of a poly machine,
then f(n) equals the ﬁrst instance of the input to machine Mn which fails to be a
solution to the problem we are considering, plus 1.
If Mn settles all instances, f(n) is undeﬁned, and we have that P = NP.
∙If Mn isn’t a poly machine, then f(n) = 0.
∙f is total—deﬁned for all n—if and only if P ≠NP.
The references give a proof that f tops in its peaks all total recursive functions. f
is highly oscillating; but it overtakes all recursive fast–growing functions. Therefore
it cannot be a computable function. The main trick in the proof is to show that, given
an arbitrary total recursive function, it can always be embedded in f via a primitive
recursive map. Therefore, if we suppose that there is a computable bound to f, we
can always show (via that embedding) that there are peaks in f that overtake the
supposed bound.
Suppose that we want to check whether our theory S proves that f is total. Pick up
the function 𝖥which cannot be proved total and recursive by the proof machinery in
S. 𝖥can be embedded in f, and we can restrict f to the domain of 𝖥in the counterex-
ample function. If S proves f total, the restricted function is total over its restricted
domain.
But as S cannot prove that 𝖥is total (it is recursive by construction), we reach a
contradiction.6

the length of its binary input.
6This is an informal argument; we must be careful with several technical details in our construction.

450
N.C.A. da Costa and F.A. Doria
Now let us go back to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem and to examples of incom-
pleteness in arithmetic. We will now relate undecidability and incompleteness.
35.3
Undecidability—and Incompleteness, Its Sibling:
Post’s Argument
Recall that a question is undecidable whenever there is no algorithm to settle it. And
a theory S is incomplete if there is a sentence 𝜉that is neither proved nor disproved
from the axioms of S. 𝜉and its negation ¬𝜉are said to be undecidable sentences
within S.
Undecidability (non–existence of algorithms for a given task) and incomplete-
ness (existence of undecidable sentences) are related, as we can see from the next
discussion.
But before we present that discussion, let’s ponder a short tale ([2], p. 23):
In the 1950s computers were mainly built by electrical engineers, and once upon a time a
team of engineers who were working on one of the brand–new “electronic brains” of the
period met some colleagues from the math department at some university’s cafeteria. The
engineers began to discuss their work with their brand new computer and said that they
were trying to develop a kind of test program that would avoid bugs: the test program would
know about the program they were running in the machine and out of that knowledge it
would test beforehand any input to see whether it resulted in an inﬁnite loop — a never
ending succession of operations without any output — or not.
So far they hadn’t been successful.
Then one of the math department people chuckled and started to laugh. What are you laugh-
ing about? complained the engineers. The math guy’s answer: what you are trying to do is
impossible; Turing proved it in 1936, two decades ago.
You are trying to write a program that solves the halting problem, and that cannot be done.
OK. But why can’t it be done?
Here is an argument that shows why such a program cannot exist:
∙List all Turing machines M0, M1, M2, ….
∙Suppose that there is a program g(x, y) that executes the following tasks:
– g(x, y) = 1 if and only if machine of program y stops over input x and gives some
output.
– g(x, y) = 0 if and only if machine of program y enters an inﬁnite loop when it
receives input x.

35
Gödel Incompleteness and the Empirical Sciences
451
∙If g is a program that can be constructed then h which we now describe can also
be constructed:
– h(x) = 1 if and only if g(x, x) = 0.
– h(x) diverges if and only if g(x, x) = 1.
(In order to make h enter an inﬁnite loop we can plug a diverging subroutine to
it at convenient places.)
∙At this point let’s go back to our listing of all Turing machines
M0, M1, M2, …
If h is a program, it can be implemented as a Turing machine, and there is a k so
that Mk = h.
∙Then:
– If h(k) = Mk(k) = 1 we get that g(k, k) = 0, from the deﬁnition of h. Now, from
the deﬁnition of g, Mk(k) must diverge. A contradiction.
– If h(k) = Mk(k) diverges, then g(k, k) = 1, which means that Mk(k) converges.
Another contradiction.
∙Therefore we can neither write a program like g nor one like h.
Now, the related incompleteness theorem, in E. Post’s version.
It’s a quite brief argument. Suppose that we can formalize in our theory S (with
enough arithmetic) the sentence “Turing machine Mk over input m diverges.” (We
can do it.)
Suppose that there is a proof of all such sentences in S, any k, m.
To prove is to compute. If there is one such proof procedure, then we can make it
into a calculation procedure. Thus we would settle all non–halting instances of the
halting problem for k, m.
That’s impossible. Therefore there are k0, m0 so that while it is true that machine
k0 over m0 diverges, we cannot prove within S that in fact machine k0 over input
m0 diverges. Also, as we’ve supposed that S doesn’t prove false assertions, it cannot
prove the negation of the sentence:
Turing machine Mk0 over input m0 diverges.
Thus that sentence is undecidable within S, as well as its negation. And it is an
undecidable sentence with a clearcut mathematical meaning.
This proof of Gödel’s ﬁrst incompleteness theorem is due to Emil Post [18]. It
shows the interdependence between undecidability (the unsolvability of the halting
problem, in this case) and incompleteness (the existence of sentences which one can
neither prove nor disprove within formal systems like S).

452
N.C.A. da Costa and F.A. Doria
35.4
From Logic to Physics
So far we have established that there are mathematical problems which naturally
(if we may say so) arise within logic or computer science (the theory of Turing
machines) and which are undecidable, or are related to undecidable sentences.
How about physics? How about classical mechanics, which is a well–established
domain? Can we ﬁnd undecidable questions in the realm of classical mechanics?
There are quite simple noncomputable expressions for functions within mathematics;
those expressions creep up even within languages close to arithmetic, and lead to
very simple questions such as, “does the integer–valued function 𝜃(n) equal 0 or
1?” which turn out to be undecidable in the general case. Analogous naïve–looking
but intractable expressions for functions can also be found within more elaborate
languages, as classical elementary analysis. With their help we can generate inﬁnitely
many undecidable sentences with a trivial appearance from arithmetic on and all the
way up to the whole of mathematics.
Some of those intractable expressions represent the halting function 𝜃(m, n), that
tells us whether the Turing machine Mm(n) stops over its input n. Once we have
an expression for the halting function, we can obtain explicit expressions for all
complete arithmetic degrees and even beyond. Therefore the associated undecidable
predicates represent problems in all the corresponding degrees of unsolvability, both
inside and outside the arithmetic hierarchy.
The Halting Function
We have seen that there is no computer program that can settle the halting prob-
lem, that is, we cannot devise a program that will tell us, for arbitrary programs,
where they will fail to give some output (that is, where they will enter an inﬁnite
loop). However we can write down an explicit expression for a function that solves
the halting problem (of course no computer program, that is, no mechanical proce-
dure can calculate its values).
We’ll exhibit its looks now.
We will need some notation. Let 𝜎be the sign function, 𝜎(±x) = ±1 and 𝜎(0) = 0.
The halting function 𝜃(n, q) is explicitly given by7:
𝜃(n, q) = 𝜎(Gn,q),
Gn,q = ∫
+∞
−∞
Cn,q(x)e−x2dx,
7Among other expressions.

Let’s explain the notation. First, consider 𝜃:
∙𝜃(n, q) = 1 if and only if Turing machine of code (program) n stops over input q.
∙𝜃(n, q) = 0 if and only if Turing machine of code n enters an inﬁnite loop over
input q and never stops.
Cn,q is obtained from the Feynmann–Richardson transform of polynomial pn,q,
which is the two–parameter universal Diophantine polynomial. Cn,q(x) is diﬀerent
from zero over the reals if and only if machine of program n stops over q. Otherwise
it is zero.
35.4.1
Chaos Is Undecidable
We used those undecidable predicates and noncomputable functions to settle several
open decision problems, mainly in dynamical systems theory. One such problems
dealt with a frequently handled question:
∙Is there a decision procedure for chaos? Chaos theory has been a fast–growing
research area since the early 70’s, a decade after the discovery of (an apparent, but
still unproved) chaotic behavior in a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system by
E. Lorenz (for references see [8]). Chaos scientists usually proceed in one of two
ways: whenever they wish to know if a given physical process is chaotic the usual
starting point is to write down the equations that describe the process and out of
them to check whether the process satisﬁes some of the established mathematical
criteria for chaos and randomness.
However those equations are in most cases intractable nonlinear diﬀerential equa-
tions as they cannot in general be given explicit analytical solutions. Therefore, chaos
theorists turn to computer simulations and for most nonlinear systems one sees a con-
fusing, tangled pattern of trajectories on the screen. The system looks random, and
there are statistical tests such as the Grassberger–Proccacia criterion that guarantee
the existence of randomness in computer–simulated systems, modulo some error. Yet
statistical tests furnish no mathematical proof of the existence of chaos in a dynam-
ical system. There is always the chance that the system is undergoing a very long
and complicated transient state, before it settles down to a nice and regular behavior.
Therefore how can we prove that a dynamical system that looks chaotic is, in fact,
chaotic?
This problem had been around since the discovery and early exploration of what is
now called “deterministic chaos.” In a 1983 conference (published in 1985) Morris
Hirsch stated that time was ripe for a marriage between the “experimental” and “the-
oretical” sides of chaos research and posed the decision problem for chaotic systems
[14].
Now, in a nutshell: let X be a dynamical system that describes a free particle; let Y
be a (proved) chaotic system.8 Then Zn:
8There are inﬁnitely many systems with a proved chaotic behavior.

454
N.C.A. da Costa and F.A. Doria
Zn = 𝜃(n)X + (1 −𝜃(n))Y
is a family of dynamical systems which alternate between a free particle or a chaotic
system, but such that we cannot algorithmically decide which is the case!
We can also concoct an example of Gödel incompleteness out of that one; we’ll soon
consider it.
The preceding discussion allows us to formulate a very general undecidability
and incompleteness theorem for any mathematical theory like our S. Informally, let
P be a property of the objects in S: if P isn’t trivial (it applies to all objects in its
domain, or to no object), then:
P is undecidable — there is no algorithm to test for it — and entails incompleteness, that
is, there is a sentence, for a x that we can explicitly construct, so that neither P(x) nor ¬P(x)
can be proved in S.
This is our general Rice–like theorem.
35.4.2
Gödel Incompleteness in Physics
In order to construct an example of Gödel incompleteness in a physical theory, we
had a blueprint to guide us: Post’s example, which has just been sketched. How-
ever there was a major stumbling block in our way, as incompleteness requires an
axiomatic framework, and the elaboration of such a framework is the challenge
in Hilbert’s 6th Problem. So, the construction of an example of incompleteness in
physics through Post’s technique involved a partial solution to a major problem.
Luckily for us, the domains of physics which interested us—classical mechanics,
Schrödinger’s quantum mechanics, some portions of quantum ﬁeld theory without
Feynmann’s integrals—could be described with adequate mathematical rigor, and
ﬁt nicely within axiomatic set theory plus the axiom of choice. We then used the
so–called Suppes predicates to present our axiomatic theory.
A Suppes predicate is the conjunction of two pieces (let’s leave it vague). One
piece describes the objects we require: manifolds, tensors, etc., for general relativity;
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, for electromagnetic theory, and so on. The second piece
are the axioms that “physically” constrain the objects described in the ﬁrst part; the
second piece also includes the dynamics (or motion equations) for those objects—
Einstein’s equations for general relativity, Lagrangians submitted to a variational
principle, in the case of ordinary classical mechanics, or d’Alembert’s principle, for
more general theories. The construction of a Suppes predicate can be quite cum-
bersome, but for our purposes it was enough to know that an axiomatic framework
existed.
We then applied Post’s trick and got an undecidable sentence in dynamical sys-
tems theory, which was seen as a portion of d’Alembert’s mechanics. We obtained,
for example, the following undecidable sentence:

35
Gödel Incompleteness and the Empirical Sciences
455
Z is a chaotic system.
Z was explicitly constructed; neither that sentence nor its negation could be proved
from the axioms of our theory (supposed consistent). That sentence had a clear ‘con-
crete’ (please allow our abuse of language) meaning, and due to its construction, it
is undecidable within our theory [3]. (For details see the reference.)
35.5
Mathematical Ecology; Economics
The chief explorers of undecidability and incompleteness in the social sciences have
been Alain Lewis and Vela Velupillai. Lewis [17] pointed out that results such as
our general incompleteness theorem (our Rice–like theorem) entail the incomplete-
ness of the theory of Hamiltonian models in economics. Such results also entail the
incompleteness of the theory of Arrow–Debreu equilibria and (what may at ﬁrst look
surprising) the incompleteness of the theory of ﬁnite games with Nash equilibria.
(Assuredly when a ﬁnite game is given through an explicit table of outcomes, it
is always decidable. However for weak extensions of formalized arithmetic we can
exhibit a description for the table of outcomes so that undecidability and incomplete-
ness follows.)
The main result is:
There is no general algorithm to test whether a given set of prices is an equilibrium set of
prices for a competitive Arrow–Debreu market.
We can add similar undecidability (and of course incompleteness) results to pop-
ulation dynamics: an example of an undecidable question in that area is, can we
check whether a given population9 will bifurcate into two separate populations. We
can actually concoct similar results everywhere in theoretical domains which are
described by similar sets of equations.
In fact, we can assert: undecidability and incompleteness do matter in the formal-
ized sciences; they matter a lot. Metamathematical phenomena are commonplace
stuﬀin the sciences which have calculus and extensions as their main language.
We must learn how to deal with it.

Appendix
We have added at this point a rather technical appendix where we give rigorous
statements of the theorems that either bear on, or which imply, the results described
above. It is to be noted that here we even go beyond the arithmetic hierarchy [20]
and show how nasty (or how interesting, it depends on one’s viewpoint...) these
mathematical phenomena can be.
A First General Undecidability and Incompleteness Theorem
Let S be our formal theory and let LS be its underlying formal language. We state
here (without proof) our main undecidability and incompleteness theorems.
Deﬁnition A.1 A predicate P in LS is nontrivial if there are term expressions 𝜉, 𝜁
in S such that S ⊢P(𝜉) and S ⊢¬P(𝜁).
If 𝜉∈LS is any expression in that language (adequately extended), we write ‖𝜉‖
for its complexity, as measured by the number of letters from S’s alphabet in 𝜉. Also
we deﬁne (according to [11]) the complexity of a proof CS(𝜉) of 𝜉in LS to be the
minimum length that a deduction of 𝜉from the axioms of S can have, subject to the
conditions in the Ehrenfeucht–Mycielski paper.
Let P be any nontrivial predicate, and let be an algebra of functions used in our
theory; is a subalgebra.
Then:
Proposition A.2 Within S:
1. There is an expression 𝜉∈⌈⌉so that S ⊬¬P(𝜉) and S ⊬P(𝜉), while there is a
model for our theory with standard arithmetic such that M ⊧P(𝜉).
2. There is a denumerable set of expressions for functions 𝜉m(x) ∈⌈⌉, m ∈𝜔,
such that there is no general decision procedure to ascertain, for an arbitrary
m, whether P(𝜉m) or ¬P(𝜉m) is provable in S.
3. Given an arbitrary total recursive function g ∶𝜔→𝜔, there is an inﬁnite number
of values for m so that CS(P(𝜉m)) > g(‖P(𝜉m)‖).
That result was our ﬁrst general incompleteness theorem [8]; it can be derived
from Rice’s theorem in computer science [20], which is an equally general result,
but the proof we ﬁrst gave for Proposition A.2 is weaker than Rice’s theorem, since
it only leads to unsolvable problems of Turing–degree not higher than 𝟎′. However:
Proposition A.3 We can explicitly and algorithmically construct in LS an expres-
sion for the characteristic function of a subset of 𝜔of degree 𝟎′′.

35
Gödel Incompleteness and the Empirical Sciences
457
That expression depends on recursive functions deﬁned on 𝜔and on elementary
real–deﬁned and real–valued functions plus the absolute value function and an inte-
gration, as in the case of the 𝜃function (the Halting Function).
We simply use Theorem 9-II in [20] (p. 132). Actually the degree of the set
described by the characteristic function whose expression we are going to obtain
will depend on the ﬁxed oracle set A; so, our construction is a general one.
Let A ⊂𝜔be a ﬁxed inﬁnite subset of the integers. An oracle Turing machine
𝜙A
x with oracle A can be visualized as a two–tape machine where tape 1 is the usual
computation tape, while tape 2 contains a listing of A. When the machine enters the
oracle state s0, it searches tape 2 for an answer to a question of the form “does w ∈
A?” Only ﬁnitely many such questions are asked during a converging computation;
we can separate the positive and negative answers into two disjoint ﬁnite sets Du(A)
and D∗
v(A) with (respectively) the positive and negative answers for those questions;
notice that Du ⊂A, while D∗
v ⊂𝜔−A. We can view those sets as ordered k– and
k∗–ples; u and v are recursive codings for them [20]. The Du(A) and D∗
v(A) sets can
be coded as follows: only ﬁnitely many elements of A are queried during an actual
converging computation with input y; if k′ is the highest integer queried during one
such computation, and if dA ⊂cA is an initial segment of the characteristic function
cA, we take as a standby for D and D∗the initial segment dA where the length l(dA) =
k′ + 1.
We can eﬀectively list all oracle machines with respect to a ﬁxed A so that given
a particular machine, we can compute its index (or Gödel number) x, and given x we
can recover the corresponding machine.
Now let us write p(n, q, x1, … , xn) for a 2–parameter universal Diophantine poly-
nomial. We can deﬁne the jump of A as follows:
A′ = {𝜌(z) ∶∃x1, … , xn ∈𝜔p(𝜌(z), ⟨z, dz,A⟩, x1, … , xn) = 0}.
(𝜌is an adequate recursive 1–1 function.) With the help of the 𝜆map [3], we can
now form a function modelled after the 𝜃function; it is the desired characteristic
function:
c∅′′(x) = 𝜃(𝜌(x), ⟨x, dx,∅′⟩).
(Actually we have proved more; we have obtained
cA′(x) = 𝜃(𝜌(x), ⟨x, dx,A⟩),
with reference to an arbitrary A ⊂𝜔.)
We write 𝜃(2)(x) = c∅′′(x).
Let 𝟎(n) be the n–th complete Turing degree in the arithmetical hierarchy.
Corollary A.4 (Complete Degrees.) For all p ∈𝜔, expressions 𝜃(p)(m) can be
explicitly constructed for characteristic functions in the complete degrees 𝟎(p).

General Incompleteness Theorems
Therefore,
Proposition A.5 For every n ∈𝜔there is a sentence 𝜉in S such that a model with
standard arithmetic 𝐌⊧𝜉while for no k ≤n there is a Σk sentence in N demonstra-
bly equivalent to 𝜉.
Let m0(∅(m)) = ⟨𝜌(z), ⟨z, dy,∅(m)⟩⟩(use of the pairing function 𝜏is supposed) such
that
𝐌⊧∀x1, … , xn[p(m0, x1, … , xn)]2 > 0,
for an universal polynomial p.
Let q(m0(∅(m)), x1, …) = p(m0(∅(m)), x1, …))2 be as after Proposition A.5. Then:
Corollary A.6 Within T, for:
𝛽(m+1) = 𝜎(G(m0(∅(n))),
G(m0(∅(n))) = ∫
+∞
−∞
C(m0(∅(n)), x)e−x2dx,
C(m0(∅(n)), x) = 𝜆q(m0(∅(n)), x1, … , xr),
𝐌⊧𝛽(m+1) = 0 but for all n ≤m + 1, S(n) ⊬𝛽(m+1) = 0 and S(n) ⊬¬(𝛽(m+1) = 0).
Then,
Corollary A.7 If LS contains expressions for the 𝜃(m) functions as given in Corollary
A.4, then for any nontrivial predicate P in N there is a 𝜁∈LS such that the assertion
P(𝜁) is S–demonstrably equivalent to and S–arithmetically expressible as a Πm+1
assertion, but not as any assertion with a lower rank in the arithmetic hierarchy.
An extension of the preceding result is:
Corollary A.8 For any nontrivial property P there is a 𝜁∈LS such that the asser-
tion P(𝜁) is arithmetically expressible and for a model with standard arithmetic
𝐌⊧P(𝜁), but it is only demonstrably equivalent to a Πn+1 assertion and not to a
lower one in the hierarchy.
Deﬁnition A.9 ∅(𝜔) = {⟨x, y⟩∶x ∈∅(y)}, for x, y ∈𝜔.
Then:
Deﬁnition A.10 𝜃(𝜔)(m) = c∅(𝜔)(m),
where
c∅(𝜔)(m)
is
obtained
as

Proposition A.3.

We can assuredly obtain arithmetic expressions for the characteristic functions
in those higher degrees. However we are here especially interested in the analytic
expressions for those functions.
Still,
Deﬁnition A.11 ∅(𝜔+1) = (∅(𝜔))′.
Corollary A.12 𝟎(𝜔+1) is the degree of ∅(𝜔+1).
Corollary A.13 𝜃(𝜔+1)(m) is the characteristic function of a nonarithmetic subset
of 𝜔of degree 𝟎(𝜔+1).
In the next results, M is again a model with standard arithmetic for S:
Corollary A.14 Within S:
𝛽(𝜔+1) = 𝜎(G(m0(∅(𝜔))),
G(m0(∅(𝜔))) = ∫
+∞
−∞
C(m0(∅(𝜔)), x)e−x2dx,
C(m0(∅(𝜔)), x) = 𝜆q(m0(∅(𝜔)), x1, … , xr),
𝐌⊧𝛽(𝜔+1) = 0 but S ⊬𝛽(𝜔+1) = 0 and S ⊬¬(𝛽(𝜔+1) = 0)(𝜔+1) = 0).
Details are found in [3]. Let’s go beyond it:
Deﬁnition A.15 ∅(𝜔+1) = (∅(𝜔))′.
Corollary A.16 𝟎(𝜔+1) is the degree of ∅(𝜔+1).
Corollary A.17 𝜃(𝜔+1)(m) is the characteristic function of a nonarithmetic subset
of 𝜔of degree 𝟎(𝜔+1).
In the next results, M is a model (with standard arithmetic) for S:
Corollary A.18 Within S:
𝛽(𝜔+1) = 𝜎(G(m0(∅(𝜔))),
G(m0(∅(𝜔))) = ∫
+∞
−∞
C(m0(∅(𝜔)), x)e−x2dx,
C(m0(∅(𝜔)), x) = 𝜆q(m0(∅(𝜔)), x1, … , xr),
𝐌⊧𝛽(𝜔+1) = 0 but S ⊬𝛽(𝜔+1) = 0 and S ⊬¬(𝛽(𝜔+1) = 0).
Proposition A.19 (Nonarithmetic intractability.) Given any nontrivial P such that
for diﬀerent 𝜉, 𝜒, S ⊢P(𝜉) and S ⊢¬P(𝜒):

1. There is a family of expressions 𝜁m ∈LS such that there is no general algorithm
to check, for every m ∈𝜔, whether or not P(𝜁m).

Gödel, arguably the greatest logician of the 20th century,1 dreamed of establishing
philosophical theses and ontological results with the rigour and precision of
mathematics. His dream was to a remarkable extent fulﬁlled. Despite their technical
sophistication, Gödel’s logical theorems such as the Completeness Theorem [22]
and his Incompleteness Theorems [23] have perennially managed to escape mere
mathematics and shed light on larger philosophical issues. Gödel’s philosophical
arguments for the unreality of time in the Theory of Relativity [1949–1952] and in
his Ontologischer Beweis [*1970] have modal logical structures that mirror his
mathematical reasoning. Gödel’s success has often been attributed to his philosophy
of mathematics, but his success is as much a tribute to his “mathematics of phi-
losophy”, i.e., his ability to formulate philosophical problems in a manner that made
them amenable to mathematical methods.2 We shall set forth two modal principles
that characterize properties of proof, time, and God that reveal logical intercon-
nections among these theorems and philosophical conclusions.

Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem
I have been again concerned with logic recently, using the methods that you so successfully
applied for the proof of undecidable properties. Here I came to a result that seems remarkable
to me. Namely, I was able to prove that the consistency of mathematics is unprovable.
—John von Neumann’s letter to Gödel (Nov. 30, 1930) ([17], 337)
Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems [23] are among the most profound results of
20th century mathematics. Popular accounts state that Gödel’s Theorem shows
there are truths of arithmetic that cannot be proved. This statement is inaccurate on
two counts. First, Gödel’s theorem does not deal with provability in any absolute
sense but only relative to a class of precisely deﬁned formal systems. Secondly,
there are two incompleteness theorems.
On September 7th, 1930, during the roundtable discussion on the foundations of
mathematics that closed the Königsberg conference on the Epistemology of the
Exact Sciences, Gödel quietly announced, in a meticulously crafted sentence, an
early version of his First Incompleteness Theorem:
(Assuming the consistency of classical mathematics) one can even give examples of
propositions (and in fact of those of the type of Goldbach or Fermat) that, while con-
tentually true, are unprovable in the formal system of classical mathematics ([13], 203).
Although leading logical positivists and philosophers of science such as Rudolf
Carnap, Herbert Feigl and Friedrich Waismann attended the Königsberg confer-
ence, Gödel’s concise announcement fell on uncomprehending ears, with one
exception. The single exception was John von Neumann, who had been chosen to
represent Hilbert’s formalist views on the philosophy of mathematics at the con-
ference. Gödel’s remarks had piqued von Neumann’s curiosity, and von Neumann
pressed for a private conversation with Gödel to ﬁnd out more about his
meta-mathematical results.
One of the great ironies in the history of mathematics was that at another
conference in Königsberg on the very next day, David Hilbert gave his famous
lecture triumphantly ending with the credo: for the mathematician there is “no
Ignorabimus…. Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen!” Hilbert not only pro-
fessed his credo that all mathematical truths are knowable but also proposed to limit
the realm of what is mathematically knowable to what could be veriﬁed by a
“mechanical procedure.”3
Several weeks after their discussion, von Neumann sent the letter (quoted above)
to Gödel announcing his remarkable discovery that “the consistency of mathematics
3A mechanical procedure, in contemporary terms, is an algorithm. Today Gödel’s incompleteness
theorems are studied through the perspective of algorithmic complexity. In a letter written in 1956
(but not discovered until the 1990s), Gödel wrote to von Neumann, who was dying from cancer,
hoping to give him something to contemplate other than his impending death. In this remarkable
letter, Gödel discusses what is now known as the P = NP conjecture, one of the most famous
unsolved problem in computer science.

is unprovable.” It must have been a great disappointment to von Neumann when
Gödel informed him that thirteen days earlier he had submitted for publication his
Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter
Systeme, I, which already contained Satz XI, now known as Gödel’s Second
Incompleteness Theorem. The irony was that this theorem shattered Hilbert’s dream
of giving the foundations of mathematics an absolutely reliable justiﬁcation through
a ﬁnitary proof of the consistency of mathematical reasoning.4
Gödel informally explained his First Incompleteness Theorem noting that its
analogy to the antinomy of the Liar (or other epistemological antinomies) “leaps to
the eye ([13], 149).” Whereas the Liar sentence asserts of itself that it is untrue, the
Gödel sentence says of itself that it is unprovable in a precisely speciﬁed formal
system such as Principia Mathematica:
G: G is unprovable in system PM
Supposing G to be provable in PM, then PM would be inconsistent insofar as it
proves a sentence asserting its own unprovability. Supposing ∼G to be provable in
PM, then G is unprovable in PM, assuming PM to be consistent. So neither G nor
its negation is provable in PM, i.e., G is undecidable in PM. Therefore, assuming
PM to be consistent, PM is incomplete.
Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem: if a formal system is consistent and its axiom
system has enough arithmetic so that its theorems can be listed by some mechanical
procedure, then there exists an undecidable sentence in that formal system, which is
therefore incomplete.5
Elegant proofs of Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem were discovered in
modal provability logics, which emerged from the 1950s–1970s. These logics were
anticipated by Gödel’s [24] “An interpretation of intuitionistic propositional cal-
culus.” Gödel’s insight was that intuitionistic truth was characterized in terms of
proof, which is a kind of necessity, and so modal axioms could be used to formalize
the properties of provability:
(T)
□P →P
What is provable is true.
(K)
□(P →Q) →(□P →□Q)
Whatever follows from what is provable is provable.
(4)
□P →□□P
What is provable is provably provable.
Henkin [35] posed the intriguing question whether the positive Gödelian sen-
tence “I am provable” is provable. Löb [37] answered Henkin’s question in the
afﬁrmative by showing that Peano Arithmetic proves a counterpart to Löb’s Axiom:
4Non-ﬁnitary proofs of consistency are possible, see Gentzen [21].
5The formal system is also essentially incomplete, i.e., one can add the undecidable Gödel sentence
as a new axiom and the resulting system will have a new undecidable sentence, which is also
undecidable in the original system.

(L)
□(□P →P) →□P
Löb’s axiom restricts (T) to what is provable
A Gödel-Löb modal probability logic (GL) results from adding (L) to (K) with
the rule of necessitation (i.e., if GL ⊢P then GL ⊢□P), modus ponens, and a rule
for proving all tautologies. (Adding Axiom (4) turns out to be redundant: in 1975
de Jongh proved that Axiom (4) is derivable from Löb’s axiom and (K) using the
substitution of ‘(□P ∧P)’ for ‘P’).
We can sketch an elegant proof in modal provability logic of Gödel’s Second
Incompleteness Theorem. First, we have a modal counterpoint to the ﬁxed-point
theorem that yields the Gödel sentence:
⊢G ↔∼□G.
In his letter von Neumann noted that the consistency of Peano Arithmetic
(PA) can be expressed by the formula that (1 = 2) is not provable:
ConsðPAÞ: = ∼□1 = 2
ð
Þ.
Now the gist of the First Incompleteness Theorem is the demonstration that:
if ⊢G ↔∼□G, then ⊢∼□1 = 2
ð
Þ →∼□G.
By the ﬁxed-point theorem, ∼□G is logically equivalent to G, so we have
⊢∼□1 = 2 →G:
By the rule of necessitation, we may preﬁx a □and then distribute, using (K),
the □over the conditional:
⊢□∼□1 = 2 →□G
According to the First Incompleteness Theorem, the provability of the Gödel
sentence implies the inconsistency of the system, so:
In short, we have:
⊢□∼□1 = 2 →□1 = 2,
464
G. Mar

which, by contraposition, yields:
⊢∼□1 = 2 →∼□∼□1 = 2.
Since ∼□1 = 2, by deﬁnition, is CONS(PA), we have:
Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem. ⊢(CONS(PA) →∼□CONS(PA)), i.e., if Peano
Arithmetic is consistent, then it cannot prove its own consistency.
In a lecture to a joint meeting of the Mathematical Association of America and
the American Mathematical Society, Gödel summarized the signiﬁcance of his
result for Hilbert’s program: the hope of ﬁnding “…a proof for freedom from
contradiction undertaken by Hilbert and his disciples” had “vanished entirely in
view of some recently discovered facts. It can be shown quite generally that there
can exist no proof of the freedom of contradiction of a formal system S which could
be expressed in terms of the formal system S itself ….” ([25] in [15], 52).

Gödel, Einstein, and the Unreality of Time
Time is no speciﬁc character of being. In relativity theory the temporal relation is like far
and near in space. I do not believe in the objectivity of time. The concept of Now never
occurs in science itself, and science is supposed to be concerned with all that is objective.
—Gödel in Conversation with Wang ([46], 320, 9.5.10.)
During the last ﬁfteen years of his life at the Institute for Advanced Studies
(IAS), Einstein sought the company of the younger Gödel (who was born the year
after Einstein’s annus mirabilis in 1905. Einstein told Morgenstern that he went to
the Institute “um das Privileg zu haben, mit Gödel zu Fuss nach Hause gehen zu
dürfen.” A famous photo taken by Morgenstern shows Einstein, causally dressed in
a rumpled sweatshirt with his wildly ﬂowing hair, standing next to Gödel, dressed
in a button-down double-breasted suit and impeccably groomed with every hair in
place. The photo is a portrait of diametrical opposites.6

creates an Escher-like illusion: the arm suspended between the two looks as if it could belong to
either.

Gödel’s Ontological Dreams
465

In order to coax Gödel to publish so he could be advanced to full professor, von
Neumann, as director of IAS, had come up with the idea of asking Gödel to submit
a paper to a Festschrift in honor of his friend Einstein’s 70th birthday. This led to
Gödel’s remarkable contributions to cosmology [26–30].
Gödel’s contribution to physics is perhaps surprising to those who know of him
only as a logician. However, Gödel was a physics student at the university before
switching to mathematics, and his interest in physics was maintained by conversing
with Einstein and attending the physics colloquia at IAS. After Gödel had agreed to
contribute a short philosophical contribution for Einstein, Gödel came across a note
by Gamow [20] in Nature challenging physicists to ﬁnd a rotating universe con-
sistent with general relativity. This convergence of challenges enabled Gödel to
combine his philosophical defense of Kant’s view on the non-objectivity of time
[27] with his mathematical explorations into the cosmology of rotating Gödel
universes in general relativity. Gödel’s philosophical paper contained no mathe-
matical equations but his technical paper [29] that appeared at the same time in a
special issue of the Review of Modern Physics did. Gödel discovered a model in
which the entire universe was rotating, creating time-like loops and making it
possible to travel to the past by travelling into the future.7
Newton in his Principia [1687] ([39]) had postulated the metaphysis of “abso-
lute, true, mathematical time… [which] ﬂows equably without relation to anything
external,” whereas Einstein in his Special Theory of Relativity [10] adopted a
Machian point of view, according to which time is something we abstract from
measurements of time. Beginning with two principles:
[Relativity] The laws of physics are valid for all observers in all inertial frames of reference.
[Constant c] The vacuum speed of light is constant for all observers in all inertial frames of
reference.
Einstein deduced that whether an observer measures two events to be happening
“at the same time” depends on the observer’s position and state of motion. This
Principle of the Relativity of Simultaneity, Einstein [10] noted, undermines the
privileged status of the present: “The four-dimensional continuum is now no longer
resolvable objectively into sections, all of which contain simultaneous events; ‘now’
loses for the spatially extended world its objective meaning.”
Gödel noted, however, that Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity [11] allows
for the reintroduction of a universal cosmic time. If the universe were
non-expanding, Gödel noted, there are distinguished frames of reference which
“follow the mean motion of matter” of the cosmos. Gödel explained in his lecture at
IAS that his search for rotating solutions, or Gödel universes, was prompted by a
desire to counter this objection in order to prove that time is not objective and so
unreal:
7Gödel casually remarks (GCW-III, [27], 271): “This contradicts Mach’s principle but it does not
contradict relativity theory.”
466
G. Mar

This incidentally also was the way in which I happened to arrive at the rotating solutions.
I was working on the relationship… between Kant and relativistic physics insofar as in both
theories the objective existence of a time in the Newtonian sense is denied. On this occasion
one is led to observe that in the cosmological solutions known at present there does exist
something like an absolute time…. So one is led to investigate whether or not this is a
necessary property of all possible cosmological solutions.8
Gödel [27] linked relativity physics with the philosophical tradition of “Par-
menides, Kant, and the modern idealists [i.e., McTaggart] in the common denial of
the “objective existence of … time in the Newtonian sense” ([14], 202). McTaggart
[42] in setting forth his famous philosophical argument in “The Unreality of Time”
enunciated various philosophical dicta, including the following: “If one of the
determinations past, present and future can ever be applied to [an event] then one
of them has always been and always will be applicable, though of course not
always the same one.”
There are various reasons for being interested in tense logic. Ordinary language
is tensed whereas the language of physics is mathematical and untensed, and one
can learn how to translate between the two types of expressions without confusing
them. For example, the connectedness of time, the principle that “for any two
distinct instants of time, one is earlier and other is later,” can be expressed using
modal temporal operators as “whatever is going to have been the case either
already has been or is now or will be.”
Using the modal temporal operators:
McTaggart’s dicta above yield the following temporal principles, here listed
with their corresponding properties of temporal ordering:
The third and four principles are instances of Axiom (5) and the last two prin-
ciples are instances of the Brouwersche axiom. Both Axiom (5) and the Brouw-
ersche axioms play key roles in contemporary explications of the modal ontological
argument.9
8Gödel’s handwritten notes for his May 7, 1949 lecture at the IAS (GCW-III, [15], 274).
9One axiom can be derived from the other by reversing the conditional (taking its converse) and
also reversing the temporal operators.
36
Gödel’s Ontological Dreams
467

Consider the tense logic10 axiomatized by:
Löb’s Axiom deﬁnes the well-foundedness of the past, i.e., there is no inﬁnite
regress of moments of time into the past and the transitivity of “later than.” On
transitive frames, the McKinsey’s Axiom deﬁnes the atomicity of time for the
future, i.e., for any moment of time, there is eventually a maximal moment of time.
This tense logic, therefore, characterizes the intuitive notion of time proceeding in a
linear sequence.
Löb’s Axiom implies the transitivity of “earlier than” and so time in this tense
logic is isotropic: it is transitive independent of temporal direction. However, it is
precisely this transitivity of time that leads to inconsistency with intuitive principles
about time in these Gödel universes. The problem with Special Relativity is that there
is no unique objective way of identifying the present moment, but the problem with
Gödel universes in the General Theory of Relativity that allows for closed time-like
loops through every point, which is incompatible with a tensed theory of time.11
Hence, given the possibility of Gödel universes, time as characterized by the above
tense logic does not exist. Moreover, this modal characterization of temporality yields
other intriguing results: (1) the corresponding relation for the McKinsey Axiom is not
ﬁrst-order deﬁnable and (2) the above logic is modally incomplete (i.e., the tense logic
holds in no ﬁrst-order frame and yet is not inconsistent.)12
10A linguistic motivation would be to combine modal tense logic with other features such as
counterfactuals, modality, and Reichenbach’s [1947] analysis of tense using three points in time.
Given ‘E’ (the event), ‘R’ (a point of reference) and ‘S’ (point of speech) and two ordering
relations, we can give analyses of sentences such as these: “If I had asked Rosemary to marry me
when we ﬁrst met, she would have accepted. If we had married back then, we would have now
been married 28 years. Unfortunately, you can’t change the past.” Another reason concerns
computer science and dynamic logic. “Temporal operators have been used to express such
properties of programs as termination, correctness, safety, deadlock freedom, clean behavior, data
integrity, accessibility, responsiveness, and fair scheduling” (see, Burgess [7], 95).
11Consider a tensed theory of time in which the present and past are real but in which the future is
not yet real. For any two temporal points A and B on a closed loop such A is present and therefore
real, B exists in both A’s past and future and so is both real and not-real. According to presentism
only the present is real. Assuming that A is the present and therefore real, in a closed time-like loop
A would also be in its own past and future and hence unreal.
12See van Bentham [44], 198, 223. Löb’s axiom requires well-foundedness, i.e., that there are no
inﬁnitely descending chains. The McKinsey axiom requires reﬂexive endpoints. But these two
properties are inconsistent on transitive frames since any reﬂexive point implies the existence of an
inﬁnitely descending chain, which is forbidden by well-foundedness. However, the tense logic is
consistent. Consider the collection of all ﬁnite and co-ﬁnite (i.e., a set whose complement is ﬁnite)
subsets of natural numbers. This collection will have all ﬁnite sets and their complements, but not
subsets such as the set of all even numbers, or the set of prime numbers. Let the accessibility
relation on the set of ﬁnite and co-ﬁnite sets be the proper subset relation. The Löb Axiom holds
because the frame is transitive and well-founded. The McKinsey Axiom also holds since its
antecedent says that if any formula denotes a co-ﬁnite set, and this set will have a future stage that
stabilizes, i.e., a set that contains all greater natural numbers. The empty set and the set of all
natural numbers constitute non-reﬂexive “endpoints.” Thomason [43], 153) speculates that the

On March 15, 1951, Einstein handed out the First Einstein Award awarded
jointly to Julian Schwinger and Gödel, saying to Schwinger “you deserve it”13 and
to Gödel “you don’t need it.” On this occasion, it was ﬁtting that von Neumann
[45], the ﬁrst mathematician to grasp the revolutionary signiﬁcance of Gödel’s
Incompleteness Theorems twenty-one years earlier, delivered a tribute to Gödel’s
work hailing it as “a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time.”
Einstein called Gödel’s curious cosmological gift “an important contribution to
the general theory of relativity” but sought physical constraints for ruling out such
universes.14 Gödel himself drew a different conclusion: if time travel in terms of
closed time-like loops is possible, then time itself is unreal. Time, like God, is either
necessary or nothing; if it disappears in one possible universe, it is undermined in
every possible universe, including our own. In other words, if it is possible that the
existence of time is impossible, then time does not exist. This reasoning is an
instance of the logically dual form of the Brouwersche Axiom, (B◊) ◊□∼T
→∼T, which, as we shall see, plays a key role in Gödel’s Ontologischer Beweis.
Gödel’s and Einstein’s belief in the unreality of time seemed to be a defense
against the reality of death. After failing to get his doctorate in physics, Einstein had
worked in obscurity in the patent ofﬁce in Bern with Michele Besso, a friend since
their years together at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. It was Besso who
introduced Einstein to the positivism of Ernst Mach, which was formative in
Einstein’s discovery of relativity.15 When Besso died, Einstein wrote in his letter to
Besso’s wife dated March 21, 1955: “Now he has departed from this strange world
a little ahead of me. That signiﬁes nothing. For those of us who believe in physics,
the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent
illusion.” When it came time for his own death less than two weeks later, Einstein
simply said, “It’s time to go.”
(Footnote 12 continued)
McKinsey Axiom has a “reasonable intuitive meaning” related to the Second Law of
Thermodynamics since it says that “each proposition eventually ceases changing its truth value
with time.”.
13Schwinger went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Richard Feynman and
Shinichiro Tomonaga for work on Quantum Electrodynamics.
14Beginning in 1992, Stephen Hawking [34] postulated “Time Cops” (alluding to Isaac Asimov’s
The End of Eternity) to prevent the appearance of closed time-like curves but subsequently
dropped the proposal as ad hoc. Also see Rindler [41]. The geometry of the multiverse of possible
spacetimes in the Theory of Relativity is a subject of current research. For example, Chaitin et al.
[8], 124: The “typical” spacetime is exotic, without global time, and if properly axiomatized in set
theory with Martin’s axiom, it is set-theoretically generic.
15Wang [46], 176, 5.4.19 reports Gödel’s views: “Positivism is generally not fruitful in scientiﬁc
research although it may have been valuable in the discovery of the special theory of relativity.
Generally speaking, right ideas are fruitful. Positivism is pedagogically better for the special theory
of relativity.”

Gödel’s God
Visited Gödel at the Institute today. A true miracle: he has gained 18 lbs., is in best shape,
sparkling conversation. Lots about politics but then about his ontological proof—he had the result
several years ago, is not happy with it but hesitates over publishing it. It would be concluded that
he really believes in God, whereas he is only undertaking a logical investigation (i.e., he shows
that such a proof, appropriately axiomatized, is possible under classical assumptions—perfections,
etc.). I joked that he should use a pseudonym—but he has already told Hempel and Scott about it
and I said people would recognize ‘the claw of the lion’, as they did with Newton.
—Oskar Morgenstern’s diary entry August 29, 1970 ([9], 307).
Although in his younger days he attended the meetings of the Vienna Circle,
Gödel distanced himself from the Circle’s atheism and positivism. In his popular-
ization of Logical Positivism, A. J. Ayer in Language Truth and Logic [1936]
argued that “God exists” is not even false but cognitively meaningless because there
could be no empirical experiences by which one could verify its truth or falsity.
Gödel, however, regarded this atheism as a “prejudice of the times,” and it was
Gödel’s realism—in contrast to the implicit veriﬁcationism of Brouwer’s intu-
itionism and Hilbert’s formalism—that led Gödel to distinguish between truth and
proof and so discover his Completeness and Incompleteness Theorems.
Gödel, like Leibniz, worked on constructing an ontological modal proof for
God’s existence. Gödel’s handwritten notes for his Ontologischer Beweis
[31] occur in his notebooks c. 1941 preceding his preoccupation with Leibniz from
1943–6. In an unsent response to the famous Grandjean questionnaire,16 Gödel
[1975] wrote: “My belief is theistic; not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than
Spinoza. Spinoza’s God is less than a person. Mine is more than a person….”. 17
However, it wasn’t until February 1970 that Gödel, worried about dying, passed
on his proof to Dana Scott.18 Leibniz had criticized Descartes’s ontological argu-
ment for failing to provide an argument for the possibility premise. Gödel bridges
this gap by axiomatizing the notion of a positive property and then giving a
maximal consistency argument to prove the possibility of the collection of all
positive properties being instantiated. Gödel undoubtedly noticed the striking par-
allels between Leibniz’s argument and his own non-constructive maximal consis-
tency proof of the Completeness Theorem for ﬁrst-order logic.19
16The Burke Grandjean questionnaire, the only ﬁrst-person commentary on Gödel’s early life, was
ﬁrst reported in Wang [47] and appears in GCW-IV, [16], 441ff.
17Wang [47], 16, 19, 21.
18When I asked Dana Scott at the 2014 Vienna Summer of Logic about how it felt to be entrusted
with Gödel’s ontological discovery, Scott said he regretted having to receive a stream of corre-
spondence from religiously inspired admirers, and atheistic detractors, who had little appreciation
for the logical properties of Gödel’s ontological discovery.
19Fitting [18], 115: “Perhaps Gödel had in mind something like the notion of a maximal consistent
set
of formulas,
familiar
from
the
Lindenbaum/Henkin
approach
to
proving
classical
completeness.”

Here we can present the modal core of Gödel’s ontological discovery.20 The
argument requires an Anselmian premise (the converse of the conditional in the
antecedent of Löb’s Axiom). If God exists, then God’s existence would be a matter
of necessity, or, in other words, God’s existence, if God exists, could not be
accidental. The ﬁrst premise states that this conditional itself is a necessary truth.
The second premise asserts that God’s existence is possible, for which Gödel
provided a demonstration. The surprising conclusion is that God actually exists:
Anselmian Axiom:
□(G →□G)
Possibility Premise:
◊G
Actualist Conclusion:
∴G
Using the Leibnizian idea that necessity is truth in all possible worlds and
possibility is truth in some possible world, Kripke [36] showed that the proliferation
of syntactical characterizations of modality elegantly correspond to natural semantic
conditions that could be required of the accessibility relation of “relative possi-
bility” among a set of possible worlds. Although Axiom (5) is used in many
contemporary version of the modal ontological argument, the weaker Brouwersche
Axiom is sufﬁcient:
Brouwersche Axiom:
G →□◊G
Symmetry
We may sketch the modal core of Gödel’s ontological argument using possible
world diagrams. In the actual world α, the two modal premises are true:
If ◊G is true in the actual world α, then in some world β possible relative to α, G
is true:
20See Hartshorne [33], which was praised by Gödel, and also Adams [1, 2] and Mar [38].
36
Gödel’s Ontological Dreams
471

If □(G →□G) is true in α, then in all worlds possible relative to α, including
β, (G →□G) is true. Hence, by modus ponens (since the laws of logic hold in all
possible worlds) □G is true in β:
The Brouwersche Axiom makes the relative possibility relation symmetric, i.e.,
all accessibility arrows between worlds are double arrows. Since □G is true in β,
assuming symmetry, G is true in α.
In fact, the Brouwersche Axiom allows the deduction of the stronger conclusion
□G, namely that God’s existence is necessary. A weaker condition sufﬁces for a
proof of God’s actual existence:
♢G ∧□ðG →□GÞ →G
namely, the principle of “ﬁnite return”,21 i.e., from each successor world we can
always return to α by a ﬁnite chain of successor worlds:
Some critics have accused Gödel of disingenuously distancing himself from his
discovery as an apologetic argument, but we have taken Gödel at his word and
engaged in a logical investigation.22
21See van Bentham [44], 176.
22Benzmüller and Paleo [5] programmed a computer to verify Gödel’s ontological proof. For
discussion of the logical properties of Gödel’s ontological proof see Anderson [3] and Hájek [32].

G. Mar

In conclusion, Gödel had grand ontological dreams. Despite their technical
sophistication, Gödel’s results have managed to escape mere mathematics and shed
light on larger philosophical issues. Why? One reason consists not merely in
Gödel’s judicious choice of problems but also in his virtuosity at mathematizing
philosophical problems. Gödel in his conversations with Hao Wang remarked:
The signiﬁcance of mathematical logic for philosophy lies in its power to make
thoughts explicit by illustrating and providing a frame for the axiomatic method.
Mathematical logic makes explicit the central place of predication in the philo-
sophical foundation of rational thought.23
I have tried to show how deeply interconnected modal principles—such as
variations of the Löb and the Brouwersche Axioms characterizing the properties of
proof, time, and God—played a role in realizing Gödel’s ontological dreams.24

would not have become actual.

The Novel and the Map: Spatiotemporal
Form and Discourse in Literary
Cartography
Robert T. Tally Jr.
There is a moment in Don Quixote where the hero and his squire board an
enchanted ship, in reality a small rowboat lacking oars, and set forth to “such
longinquous ways and regions” as it may carry them. After ﬂoating a few yards
downstream, the knight feels certain that they must have traveled at least two
thousand miles. “If I only had an astrolabe here with which to take the height of the
pole,” he says, “I would tell you how far we have gone; though if I know anything,
we have passed, or soon shall pass, the equinoctial line which divides and cuts the
opposing poles at equal distance.” In response to Sancho Panza’s question about
this “noxious line,” Don Quixote cites Ptolemy, and observes that Sancho knows
nothing of “colures, lines, parallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes,
planets, signs of the zodiac and points, which are the measures of which the
celestial and terrestrial spheres are composed.” In lieu of this scientiﬁc body of
knowledge, the knight proposes another sure-ﬁre test: “that according to the Spa-
niards and those who embark at Cadiz to go to the East Indies, one of the signs by
which they know that they have passed the equinoctial line I mentioned is that the
lice die on everyone about the ship.” Don Quixote entreats Sancho to check his
person for lice, and the squire determines with absolutely certainty that they must
not have yet crossed the equator, “not by many a long mile.”1
As so often occurs in this novel, the humor of the scene lies in the sometimes
violent disjunction between reality and appearance, where rowboats can become
enchanted ships, roadside inns take the form of grand palaces, or windmills in the
shape of giants menace wayfarers with their mighty arms. But the comedy is
heightened in this instance by the dual systems of knowledge by which to perceive
and analyze the putative “reality” in question. That is, Don Quixote’s reference to
Ptolemaic geography and cosmography, complete with an entire vocabulary of

scientiﬁc terms and concepts, is ultimately supported by what would appear to be a
folkloric myth or sailor’s fantasy about the disposition of vermin at a certain lati-
tude. The grand abstractions of geometric ﬁgures and astrological signs yield to the
visceral, earthly experience of lice on a peasant’s thigh.
These two modes, the abstract and the experiential, could be said to reﬂect
the narrative modes of the novel itself, which projects in its totality a vast map of
the world it simultaneously presents and represents, while also carefully tracing the
trajectories of its peregrinating protagonists, whose adventures give ﬂavor—indeed,
meaning—to the places and spaces laid out in this literary cartography. This is not
just the case in Don Quixote, which has long served historians and theorists of the
novel as an exemplary model of the form; arguably all novels, if not all narratives,
are engaged in one type of mapping project or another. The map-like projection and
meticulous description that so frequently characterize the form of the novel interact
with the narrative exploration and movement of the plot, making for a spatiotem-
poral novelistic discourse that serves as a form of knowledge, but also as a form that
troubles systems of knowledge, insofar as its imaginative and ﬁgurative language
can, at times, serve to delegitimize or corrupt ofﬁcial discourses. In its heteroglossia
and multiplicity of styles or forms, which Mikhail Bakhtin famously identiﬁed as
the determining features of novelistic discourse,2 the novel directly addresses basic
concerns of epistemology, while also undermining its own ﬁndings.
In this chapter, I examine the novel as a form of spatiotemporal mapping of a
world system it both mirrors and constructs. The novel, like the map, is a form a
knowledge, registering accumulated information and experience, archiving and
categorizing their relatives signiﬁcance, framing the data and their interpretations,
shaping it all into an intelligible array, and projecting potential future formations.
The novel thus makes possible a visualization of the world system, as with such
classic atlases as Abraham Ortelius’s Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, except that this
“theater” stages historical as well as geographical knowledge, which in turn must
include the social, political, and economic forces that give form to the world system
as it discloses itself in the novel. Formal techniques and narrative conventions help
to deﬁne the world’s spaces. Correspondingly, from the reader’s perspective,
matters of scale affect the perception and the interpretation of space and place, while
the subject’s position within these different scalar diagrams affects her or his ability
to recognize their signiﬁcance. In this sense, the novel’s own theatrum geo-
graphicum sets the stage for a broader consideration of literary cartography of the
world system, of which world literature is a protean counterpart.
Ortelius’s 1570 atlas, titled Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (literally “the theater of
the earthly orb,” but more simply a “world map”), is among the most inﬂuential
works of Renaissance art and science. One of the ﬁrst atlases, collecting and
binding in one volume some 70 maps, later expanded to include 167, the Theatrum
quite literally deﬁned the space of the world for generations. Along with Gerardus

Mercator’s 1569 world map, which had employed Mercator’s innovative projec-
tion, the Ortelius map world map gave form to the continents and seas in a new
way, exaggerating the spaces furthest from the equator, while condensing those
spaces closest to the line. The resulting misrepresentation of space has had noto-
rious ideological uses and abuses, as the Global South could be actually diminished
while the northern territories swell in size and purported value. (Mark Monmonier,
in How to Lie with Maps,3 observed that the cartographers and navigators of the
British Empire embraced the “ﬂattering” Mercator projection, with its use of
Greenwich as the center and its enlargement of Canada, especially.) Ortelius was
also the ﬁrst popular world map to give the continents of the western hemisphere
the label America, thus solidifying the legacy of Vespucci in this name over and
against such rival toponyms as Columbia, New India, and so on. Above all, the new
world map depicted the world as a political and geographical system, one that could
be synoptically presented by the mapmaker and taken in by the user. The whole
world, brought before one’s eyes, in a single, theatrical moment.
When Ortelius’s Theatrum Orbis Terrarum was ﬁrst published, Miguel de
Cervantes Saavedra was a soldier, freshly inducted into the Infantería de Marina
(the Spanish Naval Infantry or Marines, although the phrase is quixotically sug-
gestive of walking on water). It is not clear whether he was able to test the
louse-at-the-equator theory personally, but he would take part in the Battle of
Lapanto in Greece, pitting a “Holy League” against the expanding Ottoman Empire.
Cervantes was wounded in battle and spent time convalescing in Italy, then he
continued ﬁghting elsewhere in the Mediterranean over the next few years.
Sometime afterwards, famously, he was taken hostage by pirates and enslaved for
ﬁve years in Algiers, before returning to Spain. Even if it limited itself to this
period, Cervantes’s biography already makes for the stuff of adventure novels or
romances. His own trajectory from Spain to Italy, thence to the Greek isles and
northern Africa, traced a personal itinerary through a key part of the emergent world
system, that Mediterranean of Fernand Braudel’s “geohistory” and Immanuel
Wallerstein’s sixteenth-century European “core.”4 Even before he began writing his
own works, Cervantes’s adventures placed him squarely on the map, while indu-
bitably highlighting the crucial differences in the speciﬁc places, languages, and
cultures of the various stops along his journeys. The “big picture” vision of the
world ﬁgured on Mercator’s and Ortelius’s maps undoubtedly inﬂuenced the
novelist’s perspective on the new world into which the heroes of his own novels
would move, but his own peripatetic movements, characterized by a good deal of
peripety, certainly colored his understanding of those spaces.
The experience of place, as the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan has repeatedly observed,
comes down to this ﬂuctuating mixture of movement and rest. Tuan has that “Space

is transformed into place when it has acquired deﬁnition and meaning,” at which
point it becomes the subject of interpretation, the traditional purview of literature.5
Yet the more abstract conception of space, as a largely undifferentiated zone in
which the subject moves without awareness or identiﬁcation of discrete places is
also crucial to literary discourses, since the distinction Tuan makes requires a sort of
symbolic or representational activity whereby the individual subject connects his or
her direct experience to a broader system or structure that, in various ways, gives
form to or makes sense of that experience. As Fredric Jameson has argued per-
suasively, narrative is itself a socially symbolic act by which the writer coordinates
the subjective or existential experience with the broader social totality, a national
allegory or world system, that makes possible the “truth” of that experience.6
The grand world maps and atlases of Ortelius and Mercator were both repre-
sentative and productive of the age of exploration that witnessed the rise of car-
tography. One tends to think of mapmaking as an innate, universal, and even
“natural” aspect of human understanding of the world, and undoubtedly certain
forms of primitive geographical sketches, along with the portulans charts and the
medieval T-and-O maps, existed long before the ﬁfteenth century. However, the
explosion of ever more and more elaborate maps and charts in this age indicated
that a revolution, not only in geography, but in the arts, sciences, and culture for
generally, was under way. As Tom Conley has pointed out, “at the beginning of the
ﬁfteenth century, maps were practically non-existent, whereas only two centuries
later they were the bedrock of most professions and disciplines.”7 The advent of this
new age of cartography literally transformed the way we see the world and our-
selves in it.
Recent scholarship on the theory and history of the novel has troubled the ease
with which critics formerly named Don Quixote the ﬁrst modern “novel” or
identiﬁed the “rise of the novel” with sixteenth- and seventeenth-century literature,8
but one may still observe that the novel form rapidly became a dominant genre in
both European and world literature during this epoch. Philosophers as diverse as
Georg Lukács and Michel Foucault have identiﬁed Don Quixote as the turning
point, and the emergence of the novel as the aesthetic form expressing mankind’s

“transcendental homelessness” brings to the fore the fundamentally literary carto-
graphic project of the novel. For Lukács, “The novel is the epic of a world that has
been abandoned by God.”9 Whereas the ancient and medieval epic had somehow
assumed a clear connection between human experience and the world at large, a
metaphysical unity essentially guaranteed by divine providence, the modern con-
dition demands a form that attempts, and likely fails, to make those connections, to
project that “archetypal map,” as Lukács calls it.10 The rise of the novel, not
surprisingly, corresponds to the rise of cartography.
In The Order of Things, Foucault asserts that “Don Quixote is the ﬁrst modern
work of literature,”11 which he explains by distinguishes the novel’s epistemology
from a Renaissance episteme characterizes by similitude. In the Renaissance world
not yet abandoned by God, resemblances in nature could disclose the Almighty’s
signature; thus the natural world could be read like any other text. As Foucault
explains, however,
Don Quixote is the negative of the Renaissance world; writing had ceased to be the prose of
the world; resemblances and signs had dissolved their former alliance; similitudes have
become deceptive and verge upon the visionary or madness; things still remain stubbornly
within their ironic identity: they are no longer anything but what they are; words wander off
on their own, without content, without resemblance to ﬁll their emptiness; they are no
longer the marks of things; they lies sleeping between the pages of books and covered with
dust. Magic, which permitted the decipherment of the world by revealing the secret
resemblances beneath its signs, is no longer of any use except as an explanation, in terms of
madness, of why analogies are always proved false. The erudition that once read nature and
books alike as parts of a single text has been relegated to the same category as its own
chimeras: lodged in the yellowed pages of books, the signs of language no longer have any
value apart from the slender ﬁction which they represent. The written word and things no
longer resemble one another. And between them, Don Quixote wanders off on his own.12
After this moment, the novel will have as its vocation the attempt to give some
sort of reasonable shape to a world no longer guaranteed of its recognizable con-
tours by a transcendent reality. Like the modern map, which uses ﬁguration,
exaggeration, and distortion in attempting to “realistically” represent the spaces on
its surface, the novel cannot simply hold up a mirror to reality, but shapes and
molds the images, characters, events, and places it represents.
The novel is what Lukács calls “a form-giving form,” which also suggests its
epistemological role, since the natural or social world it presents cannot simply be
known objectively. Knowledge had to become the province of the knower, and the
writer cannot be expected merely to reveal the truth, but like the reader must
interpret the world. Hence the novel is an essentially epistemological form, and like

the map, it is a form of knowledge as well as an attempt to know. Bakhtin makes
this very point in contrasting the epic and the novel. Whereas in the epic or ancient
literature in general “it is memory, and not knowledge, that serves as the source and
power for the creative impulse,” writes Bakhtin, “[t]he novel, by contrast, is
determined by experience, knowledge and practice (the future).” Bakhtin concludes
by saying that, when “the novel became the dominant genre, epistemology became
the dominant discipline.”13
The epistemological or scientiﬁc impulse underlying cartographic and novelistic
practice should not be taken in a strictly empirical sense. The will to knowledge in
such work confronts a persistence of ambiguity that ultimately frustrates, but at the
same time sustains, the project. As it becomes apparent that there can be no “true
maps,” as Jameson noted in a “digression on cartography,” since there can be no
perfectly mimetic representation of the spaces depicted on them, “it also becomes
clear that there can be scientiﬁc progress, or better still, a dialectical advance, in the
various historical moments of mapmaking.”14 The knowledge to be gained or
advanced through these practices thus will remain provisional, tentative, incom-
plete, and therefore ultimately erroneous, but this means that the epistemic efforts
can be directed at producing better maps or narratives, with it also understand that
what counts as “better” may vary from time to time and place to place. As I have
put it elsewhere, “[i]f failure is inevitable, the goal must be to fail in interesting
ways.”15
A more recent novel, Daniel Kehlmann’s Measuring the World (2005),
explicitly takes up the epistemological and cartographic projects of the modern
novel. Measuring the World is not exactly a historical novel, but by interweaving
the ﬁctional and real lives of mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and geographer
Alexander van Humboldt, Kehlmann evokes the intellectual fervor of the Goe-
thezeit and its aftermath in Germany and elsewhere. The plot involves the crucial
distinction between the scientiﬁc methods of these giants as they go about their
revolutionary work, each measuring the world, thereby changing it forever, but it
vastly different ways. Gauss rarely left his home in Göttingen, conducting the
occasional experiment and consulting his telescope, but for the most part his labors
involve speculation and deduction. Humboldt, famously, travelled to the Americas,
scaling mountains and descending into volcanoes, exploring the Amazon, inter-
viewing indigenous peoples, and always, taking special care to measure everything
and record his ﬁnding. The abstract mathematical speculation is thus contrasted
with the physically intensive empirical exploration. (Somewhat lesser characters in

the novel, like Gauss’s son Eugen who wishes to study languages or Humboldt’s
gifted brother Friedrich, the philologist and philosopher, provide the barest glimpse
of other forms by which we measure our world.) The two approaches, so different
yet entirely complementary to the impossible project of the novel’s title, also
represent the two discursive modes of literary cartography, as the speculative or
totalizing abstraction of the map provides the necessary framework for an experi-
ential perambulations of the itinerary, which in turn gives shape, texture, color, and
other characteristics to the places ﬁgured on the map.
In the end, this mapping affects the territory, which itself conditions the possible
way in which its maps can be imagined, and so on. Late in Measuring the World,
Kehlmann’s Gauss thinks about this very thing, only he does so while he is engaged
in his own wanderings, and he realizes that the mapping project forever alters the
landscapes.
In the afternoon he [Gauss] took long walks through the woods. Over time he’d ceased to
get lost, he knew this area better than anyone, he’d ﬁxed every detail of it on the
map. Sometimes it was as if he hadn’t just measured the region, but invented it, as if it had
only achieved its reality through him. Where once there had been nothing but trees, peat
bogs, stones, and grassy mounds, there now was a net of grades, angles, and numbers.
Nothing someone had ever measured was now or could ever be the same as before. Gauss
wondered if Humboldt would understand that. It began to rain, and he took shelter under a
tree. The grass shivered, it smelled of fresh earth, and there was nowhere else he could ever
want to be but here.16
Gauss’s surmises, punctuated by the sensual pleasure and homeliness of the
sylvan scene, brings the abstract and the experiential back into amenable rela-
tionship to one another.
The realism of a novel, as with the basic practicality of a map, can lead one to
miss the intensively ﬁgurative, imaginative function of the form. For all their
epistemological value, the novel and the map are far better at reminding us of the
artiﬁciality of representation, of the trickiness associated with languages and ima-
ges, and of the potential for these forms to create radically alternatives visions of the
world. “While the map is never the reality,” the great geographer J. B. Harley once
observed, “it helps us to create a different reality.”17 The various anecdotes and
examples of this essay suggest the ways in which novels and maps, two exceed-
ingly powerful forms of knowledge, give form to or make sense of the world system
presented in and by them. Together, they disclose a theatrum geographicum in
which the places and spaces of our world are made meaningful.

Time, Space, and the Human Geographies
of Opportunity
Donald G. Janelle
Abstract Through space-adjusting technologies and social practices, innovation has
progressively transformed the space and time constraints on the geographical range
and nature of human activities, and on the interactivity of people at local through
global scales. This essay explores explicit measurements and representations of the
time-space convergence and divergence of places and their impacts on individuals,
families, communities, regions, and nations. At such scales, the nature of time-space is
differentially experienced, based on gradations and cleavages in human conditions
that result from socio-economic systems that differentially allocate wealth, education,
infrastructure, and other affordances for breaking down the rigidity and restrictions on
mobility and opportunity. The essay addresses questions regarding the measurement
of time-space convergence at different geographical scales, considers the implications
of convergence processes for human well-being, and explores the use of
time-geography concepts to help reduce constraints on opportunities for people to
engage successfully and equitably in a world where the signiﬁcance of distance can
change rapidly and with uneven impact on places, regions, and nations.

meaning of and control over time and space. As dimensions of human behavioral
spaces (within homes, workplaces, neighborhoods, cities, regions, and the world),
time and space pose fundamental constraints on mobility, location, and accessibility
to the necessities of life. This chapter focuses on the role of space-adjusting tech-
nologies [2] and on how they interactively align with human spatial behavior and
the physical organization of human built environments.
Combinations of space-adjusting technologies (i.e., information and communi-
cation technologies (ICT), and transportation) and strategic tradeoffs between space
and time alter dramatically the potentials for human beings, ﬁrms, and other agents
to expand opportunities for productive engagement over broader spatial domains
(locally, regionally, and globally) and more intensively through time. Conversely,
the affordances for socio-economic development offered by ICT create often
conﬂicting challenges to individual autonomy, protection of privacy, national
sovereignty, and the value of cultural identity. Indeed, the range of discrepancy in
how different regions and social groups take advantage of these technologies and
confront their contingent threats to identity is enormous and difﬁcult to grasp. A key
to recognizing and resolving such problems relates to fundamental conceptions of
time and space—details and examples from a geographical perspective are
reviewed in this chapter.

Time-Space Convergence—Measurements
and Perspectives on a Shrinking World
Imagine Toronto and Montreal (500 km) colliding with one another, or Mumbai
encroaching on Kolkata (1,168 km). Ridiculous? Yes/maybe, but it’s also a matter
of perspective. Distances are indeed real, but their measurement is a product of
human conception. Having agreed on units of measurement (meters and kilometers,
hours and minutes, or some other depiction of the energy and effort required to
move from one place to another), it has been apparent for millennia that human
beings are not content with the state of their distances to other places. Through
invention, investments in new technologies, and expansion of transport infras-
tructure, some places have successfully lessened the aggregate effort required to
achieve levels of utility that far exceed other places. Places that seek economic and
political clout have been, and are, on a mission to be as close as possible to all other
places in their regions and countries, and in some cases, the world.
Time-space convergence (TSC), the rate at which the time required to move
between places changes over historical time, provides a means to measure the
results of innovations in transport and communication technologies. TSC is mea-
sured as TT1–TT2/(Y2–Y1), where TT1 and TT2 are travel times in different years,
Y1 and Y2 [12, 13, 15]. The convergence of Boston–New York, averaging 20 min
per year over 210 years, illustrates the signiﬁcant changes in time-distance that
occur in regions of substantial economic growth based in part on transitions in

ground transportation technologies from horse-drawn stagecoaches to railway and
improved road facilities for automotive and truck transportation (Fig. 38.1). The
inﬂection in the Boston–New York convergence curve in the late 1800s accords
with the asymptotic nature of the convergence process as travel-times approach
technical, ﬁnancial, and geographical limits to further gains from transport speed
and logistic efﬁciencies.

London–Edinburgh, and Boston–New York. Thus, technological improvements on
the St. Petersburg–Moscow line produced an average annual convergence of
6.8 min per year from the introduction of passenger service in 1851 to the inau-
guration of new high-speed trains by 2010. This corresponds with about 3.0 min
per year for rail transportation convergence in similar time frames for London–-
Edinburgh and Boston–New York.
For China, regular railway passenger service for Beijing–Shanghai commenced
in 1913, requiring about 44 h for the journey. With improved ferry crossings over
the Yangtze River, this was reduced to about 36 h in 1933. By the mid-1950s, the
trip was down to 28 h. The bridging of the Yangtze in 1968 saw this decline to
about 22 h. Engine and track improvements and logistical innovations reduced it
further to about 17 h by 1986; but, by 2010, dedicated infrastructure for high-speed
trains traveling 300 km/hr reduced the journey to only 4.8 h. The average annual
convergence through investment in rail passenger services for 1913–2010 equaled
about 24 min per year. Similar investments connecting key economic centers by

highway, rail, and air transportation networks have placed China on a favorable
path to competitiveness in the global economy. For rail passenger service, the
convergence between Delhi and Mumbai equaled about 10.5 min per year from the
early 1870s to 2010. As one of the world’s most railway intensive countries, India
is currently seeking high-speed rail connectivity along major inter-urban corridors,
an initiative to enhance both internal economic integration and access to the global
community.
Some of the general properties of the convergence process are described brieﬂy
in reference to Fig. 38.3. Curve A is a smoothing out of data points based on known
travel-times required for given years, whereas Curve C is the average level of
convergence or divergence over a designated time period.
Curve B represents a more literal description of actual behavior and deserves
more attention. While some processes of improvement occur gradually through
time (road widening, shorter routes, changes in speed limits, better logistical control
over resources, engine efﬁciencies, etc.), convergence tends to occur abruptly based
on investments to enhance facilities through minor improvements and major new
innovations. Such changes can result in a sudden collapse in distance that irrevo-
cably alters the patterns of opportunities for places joined to, or excluded from,
access to the new transportation alternatives. Conversely, failure to maintain
facilities or to meet market demands can lead to congestion and time-space
divergence. Generally, short of major disasters that sever routes temporarily or
permanently, divergence occurs gradually—a situation that is all too common in
large congested urban areas.
There is one other feature of the convergence process that is not illustrated in
Fig. 38.3, namely that places more distant from one another inevitably converge
more rapidly upon each other over time, even if they share the same levels of
Fig. 38.2 Time-space convergence between major national centers by passenger railway.

technological improvement. The same level of improvement over a longer distance
will result in greater levels of convergence than over shorter distances. This
inevitability works to the advantage of a country’s (and the world’s) largest
metropolitan and regional centers, conferring upon them favorable cost and access
beneﬁts for economic development. For example, given the same levels of tech-
nology for their transportation linkages, San Francisco and New York (on the
coastal margins of North America—4,135 km) will converge more rapidly than will
Houston and Chicago (1,518 km). If travel speeds are increased uniformly between
the centers over a 20-year period from 100 km/h to 130 km/h, Houston–Chicago
will converge on average 9.0 min per year, whereas the San Francisco–New York
convergence will average 28.6 min per year.
Removing the distance bias in the convergence measure is possible. Table 38.1
provides alternative measures based on the examples shown in Fig. 38.2. Thus, the
dominant convergence of Beijing–Shanghai according to minutes per year is
stripped of the distance bias by measuring the decline as minutes per 100 km or as
minutes per 100 km per year. These measures elevate the convergence posture of
St. Petersburg–Moscow and illustrate a lag in investment for rail infrastructure
serving Edinburgh–London.
Regardless of the measure selected, the examples shown in Table 38.1 reveal
uneven patterns of convergence across space and time that pose substantive issues
for scientiﬁc interpretation and for evaluation of policy responses to implementa-
tions of space-adjusting technologies [16]. Uneven convergence among different
parts of a city, among places in a region, or cities within a country can have
signiﬁcant implications for the unfolding patterns of economic development,
political cohesion, and opportunity.
An unfortunate attribute of many advanced transportation developments is that
unevenness in accessibility increases as investment requirements for higher speeds

increase. For instance, modern limited-access highways (i.e., freeways and
motorways) have very few points of entry when compared to ordinary streets and
rural roads. Small communities may have no local entry points and must continue
using older systems or travel long distances to enter at freeway interchanges.
Similarly, high-speed rail networks beneﬁt large places, while potential users in
smaller intervening bypassed communities get to watch trains whiz by at 200 km
per hour or more. This pattern also plays out with commercial shipping—large
capital-intensive terminals, such as container ports, are few in number even at
continental scales, further concentrating the spatial patterns of opportunities for
regional economic growth.
Users of maps have traditionally seen the distribution of towns, cities,
metropolitan centers, roads, and railways as ﬁxed geometrical patterns that abide by
Euclidean axioms. However, when the distance metric of the map shifts to func-
tional measures of effort required to move between places (e.g., travel time or cost,
usually over multiple exclusive networks instead of uniform isotropic surfaces),
Euclidean rules prove inadequate and the resulting complex and multiple geome-
tries become difﬁcult to visualize. Cartographers and spatial theorists have grappled
with how to represent such complexity graphically. It is not possible to review such
attempts in this chapter but readers interested in this problem can explore the
innovative work of Spiekermann and Wegener [23], Tobler [24], Axhausen, et al.
[5], and L’Hostis [18]. A broader social contextualization of time-space conver-
gence is provided by Warf [25].
38.3
Human Extensibility in a Shrinking World
The previous section has focused on characteristics and implications of time-space
convergence at levels of cities, regions, and countries. But, it is also important to
address explicitly how convergence and divergence processes relate to human
well-being and to the daily time-geographies of individuals, families, and com-
munities. At such scales, the nature of time-space is differentially experienced,
based on gradations and cleavages in human conditions that result from socio-
economic systems that differentially allocate wealth, education, infrastructure, and
other affordances for breaking down the rigidity and restrictions on mobility and
opportunity. This shift in scale allows for a focused look at how the time-space
shrinkage of functional distances between places can be exploited by individuals,
ﬁrms, and other institutions to reach beyond their actual physical locations—a
concept referred to as human extensibility [14].
For much of human history, communication between individuals across space
required that at least one of the communicants transport himself or herself to the
location of the other person to carry out face-to-face exchanges or that messages be
carried and delivered to recipients. Public presentations in town squares and halls
have long provided for localized mass communication, postal delivery services
have attended to private communications, and newspaper deliveries have addressed
38
Time, Space, and the Human Geographies of Opportunity
493

the needs for broad dissemination. Transportation is a signiﬁcant means of such
extensibility, but emphasis in recent decades has shifted increasingly toward the
importance of ICT in structuring economic and social life, and to the integration of
resources that facilitate the production, analysis, evaluation, packaging, distribution,
and storage of information for diverse uses.
Cell phones, smart phones, and Internet services create opportunities for
engagement with distant locations for family, professional, political, and entertain-
ment purposes. Increasingly, the global Internet and cyber-infrastructure are revo-
lutionizing pathways to communication and creating potentials to greatly
democratize opportunities for human space-time extensibility. Online communica-
tion offers a conduit for human extension and inﬂuence to any geographical scale,
doing so without leaving the comforts of home, school, or ofﬁce―selectively
through email and social networks or, less discriminately, with the broadcasting
capabilities of blog, wiki, and video archive technologies. Nonetheless, there remain
enormous barriers to accessing these tools, limiting use to only those with resources
to cover the costs of equipment, licenses, subscriptions, and user fees, and with the
technical training, time, and commitment for developing effective applications.
Perspectives on both the technical and social issues related to human extensibility
and ICT are addressed in publications by Adams [3, 4], and Kwan [17].
Given a plethora of traditional and ICT-based means for communication in the
current era, it is useful to consider how individuals and collective social agents
select from alternatives. In part, decisions often invoke evaluation of tradeoffs
between the needs to be at the same place at the same time against the cost and
efﬁcacy associated with different means of communication. To help distinguish the
tradeoffs between space and time, Fig. 38.4 provides a categorization of commu-
nication tools according to their suitability for overcoming spatial and temporal
constraints based on requirements for geographical and/or temporal coincidence
among communicants.
Changes in human behavior as a consequence of communication systems
becoming more adaptable to human needs in space and time (e.g., the transition from
station-based landlines to person-based mobile phones) remain difﬁcult to assess at
this early stage. However, scholars have been speculating about the prospects for
some time, even before widespread availability of mobile devices and online ser-
vices. Abler’s [1] polarization conjecture suggested that an increase in the avail-
ability of information from multiple sources coupled with enhanced communication
options could result in like-minded people coalescing on the basis of specialized
interests and biases, contrary to expectations that human extensibility might promote
a more uniform world view. In 2004, Couclelis advanced her hypothesis of activity
fragmentation, suggesting that as ICTs become increasingly widespread, activities
will become more fragmented in space and time and more person-based than
space-based, resulting in situations where the time, duration, and synchronization of
human activities in space will become less predictable and more autonomous. In
combination with time-space convergence, it is also likely that increased access to
494
D.G. Janelle

information resources and virtual connectivity through online services could build
awareness to opportunities elsewhere in the world that increase the desire for, and the
likelihood of, travel and commerce among distant and dispersed locations, contin-
uing the growth in per capita global consumption of distance.
38.4
A Time-Geography Model of Society
Swedish geographer Torsten Hägerstrand (1916–2004), a pioneer in the study of
innovation diffusion and the originator of time geography [11], saw clearly how the
human structuring of time and space can impose constraints on the abilities of
people to engage successfully and equitably in a world where new technologies and
social practices open up possibilities or pose threats to the sustainability of local and
global environments. Time geography provides a set of concepts and a graphical
notation system that integrates time and space and that contextualizes the situations
that people encounter in their interdependent activities of normal daily life and in
projects over extended periods, even a lifetime. Individual human beings are the
basic building blocks of social systems and individual activity behavior is a process,
graphically encoded as a time-space path (Fig. 38.5a). These paths encompass the
set of activity and travel episodes of one or more people over a 24-hour cycle, but

constraints of communicants. Source author

are extendable as lifelines to cover a lifetime. In addition, they are extendable across
space to encompass larger regions and broader social systems. Although this dis-
cussion emphasizes the paths of human beings, time geography also embraces the
movement and ecological realms of material objects and physical resources that are
essential for fulﬁlling many human endeavors.
Time-space paths are constrained by what Hägerstrand referred to as coupling,
authority, and capability constraints.
• Coupling constraints refer primarily to social ties (e.g., the need to join with
others to carry out activities (e.g., a game of basketball, a work task that requires
the sharing of expertise, and essential family obligations, such as caring for a
child, etc.). An activity bundle designates a coupling event involving the delib-
erate engagement of two or more individuals for carrying out a joint task for a
prescribed time at the same location or station (e.g., workplace, gym, home).
• Authority constraints emphasize controls over access to space (e.g., laws
regarding ownership of property, the designated service hours of banks and

b space-time prism and the maximum potential path area as constrained by the need to be at home
during designated periods for personal maintenance (e.g., sleep and household obligations) and the

and potential activity areas associated with different levels of personal mobility and travel mode.

other facilities, and the design of built environments that create physical barriers
or restricted gateways to activity spaces).
• Capability constraints concern human biological needs for daily maintenance
(food, sleep, hygiene, etc.), access to means (and speed) of movement, and the
social capital, personal income, and talents to take advantage of opportunities.
The space-time prism (Fig. 38.5b) delimits the outer-bounds of movement
possibilities and activity choices over a speciﬁed time period, usually constrained
by speed of movement and by coupling constraints (e.g., the obligation to be at
home during certain hours). The prism determines the potential path area, a geo-
graphical area that expands with faster means of travel, opening up a broader range
of opportunities in time and space (Fig. 38.5c). However, participation in activities
that consume time at stations limits the future geographical extent of activities
within the speciﬁed time period. More complete time-geography representations
can model the tradeoffs that individuals, households, businesses, and institutions
make in allocating time for on-site activities versus travel through space.
Time geography constitutes a way of thinking about problems and potential
solutions. Applications in the early 1970s were mostly conceptual but, increasingly,
computational capabilities, new data sources (especially from geo-spatially refer-
enced data generated through online social networks), and visualization capabilities
(e.g., geographic information systems (GIS) and visual animation tools) have
supported expanded research applications in many ﬁelds. Examples are numerous
in the areas of transportation and land use planning—e.g., evaluating policy options
according to how they might enhance or inhibit the range of choices and oppor-
tunities for households in different urban neighborhoods or rural communities,
assessing how social beneﬁts might accrue to households from implementation of
ﬂexible work schedules or telecommuting options; considerations of how land use
patterns in cities encourage or inhibit pedestrian activities and healthy exercise; and
search and surveillance strategies for police protection of neighborhoods and
apprehension of criminals.
All of these examples invoke an understanding of, or a manipulation of, the tem-
poral and spatial dimensions of society. As such, they constitute negotiations over the
meaning of space and time with regard to possible conﬂicting values of different
entities, such as households, private ﬁrms, public institutions, and nations, and
interests (e.g., rich and poor, labor and management, rural and urban, majorities and
minorities, and other possible categorizations) that divide the human community.
Many areas of application of time geography extend spatially beyond local
regions to national and global scales and temporally to document and reason about
human behavioral processes in the distant past and plausible futures. Thus, human
extensibility and time-space convergence processes weigh prominently in how
problems are recognized and addressed. Examples include predicting locations of
archaeological sites and the patterns of movement within ancient settlement sys-
tems; studying economic- and social-beneﬁt tradeoffs between travel events and
virtual substitutes via online services; exploring disease pathways through social
networks in epidemiology; the formation and role of invisible colleges in the history
38

of science; investigating regional and global migration patterns and diasporas; and
the extension of markets and governance systems across space. Time-geography
also lends itself as a supplement to other established research methodologies in the
social sciences and humanities, such as event analysis in historical studies, exter-
nalities in economics, and life-cycle and cohort analyses in demography and related
branches of sociology.

extensions of time geography are encouraged to consult research by Burns [7],

38.5
Conclusions
This chapter has presented geographical perspectives on time and space as basic
dimensions of the human experience, focusing on the role of space-adjusting
technologies in expanding access to resources in support of livelihood and
opportunities for socio-economic development. The basic utility of a place on Earth
is a function, in part, of the ability of its residents to access and communicate with
others elsewhere—locally, regionally, and globally. In an ideal world, we might
hope that such abilities would be distributed equitably and that access and com-
munication would be achievable through minimal expenditures of time and ﬁnan-
cial resources. As seen in interrelated discussions about processes of time-space
convergence and human extensibility, transportation, information, and communi-
cation technologies have enabled substantial mediation of the spatial and temporal
constraints on mobility and human interactions. But, on the other hand, these
processes promote spatial concentrations of development that can aggravate levels
of disparity at local scales within cities and regions, and at national and global
scales. It is argued that greater documentation and understanding of convergence
and extensibility processes are required in order to better direct their consequences
toward more balanced distributions of opportunity.
Negotiations over the meaning of time and space are central to modifying the
basic capability, coupling, and authority constraints over time-space paths,
space-time prisms, and the projects that people and institutions engage in over their
lifespans. Society is still in an early phase of integrating ICT into the functioning of
built environments and local communities, yet this technology is critical to human
extensibility processes that can be channeled into breaking down constraints that
currently limit opportunities for jobs and fulﬁlling lifestyles for many subpopula-
tions (e.g., those with physical disabilities and impaired mobility). An emphasis in
education on critically informed uses of ICT can alert populations to the oppor-
tunities and security threats of integrating online resources and ICT tools into daily
activities and to extending professional and other interactions beyond local com-
munities through virtual contacts in cyberspace.

ICT and transportation are continually evolving new forms and capabilities that
will alter the meaning of space and time in the context of time-geography. A look at
current and emergent practices is instructive. Global positioning systems (GPS) and
tracking technologies are currently common features of transportation vehicles and
mobile phones, and geo-spatial information is increasingly guiding ICT and trans-
portation operations. Location-based services (LBS) exploit information on the
locations of users in real-time for marketing purposes. These technologies can also
alert one to the locations of friends in the immediate vicinity and they can provide
critical information to the public during emergencies. They have also enabled the
creation of new specialized information resources (e.g., details on bird sightings
for bird watchers) and databases through volunteered geographic information
(VGI) [10]. In essence, dense networks of mobile sensors, currently in place, provide
potentials for documenting in real-time the locations and movements of vehicles and
humans at local through global scales. Adding to the mix, autonomous self-driving
vehicles are on the horizon and air-borne drones are in use for surveillance, parcel
deliveries, and agricultural applications. The time-geography landscape is unfolding
in ways to enable new human activity patterns, restructuring of spatial economies,
and continued processes of time-space convergence and human extensibility. Yet,
humankind remains in search of ways to share opportunities for people to engage
successfully and equitably in a world where the signiﬁcance of distance can change
rapidly and with uneven impact on places, regions, and nations.

Losing Time and Space: Experiencing
Immersion
Diana J. Reichenbach
Abstract The sense of immersion—the feeling of losing track of time and space—
is something all of us have experienced. Whether it is through a ﬁlm, an interactive
game, or hiking in a landscape, these immersive experiences have been sought after
since the beginning of humankind to open our minds to new possibilities and
expand perceptions of our world. This article explores the role of art in crafting
immersive experiences and how a variety of mediums activate our senses in very
different ways.
39.1
Introduction
The picture that located the observer in a virtual environment can arouse a powerful
experience. There are metaphors to describe it: one is taken out of oneself, one is trans-
ported… It is not an illusion of reality that is induced in these pictures, but an awareness of
being in the world. This is no illusion. [5, p. 232].
In his article, “The Ecological Approach to the Visual Perception of Pictures,”
James T. Gibson studies how virtual depictions of an environment inﬂuence the
way we see them. What he describes is a moment of immersion for the viewer of an
image; a moment that transports them from the current time and space and results in
an awareness that previously was not perceived. Two elements of this statement:
(1) the feeling of being “transported,” and (2) the resulting “awareness of the
world,” will be recurring themes of this article. These are the elements that deﬁne
the immersive experience of losing time and space and the resulting change in the
way one thinks.
Immersive experiences can be long or short form. Flow, a term coined by
positive psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, is a longer form immersive expe-
rience in which a person is engaged in, “a state of heightened focus in activities

such as art, play and work.” Csíkszentmihályi’s theory asserts a person has a limited
amount of information they can process per second, and that to achieve ﬂow
requires a temporary suspension of existence [4]. Flow is also commonly referred to
as “being in the zone.”
A shorter form immersive experience, and perhaps more common, can be
described as an insight, or a, “sudden awareness of a complex process of interac-
tion.” [8, p. 90]. In Interactive Storytelling, game designer Chris Crawford explains
these insights require a reshaping of our information network, resulting in a radical
change of thought [3, p. 15].
In this article I would like to explore: (1) why immersive experiences are
important, (2) how these experiences relate to art and technology, and (3) ways an
immersive experience can be crafted to reach others.
39.2
Why Are Immersive Experiences Important?
Recently I visited Gettysburg Battleﬁeld, the site of the legendary battle between
the Union and the Confederacy and a turning point in the American Civil War. Like
many children in America, I grew up reading about this battle in school and had
seen it depicted in Hollywood ﬁlms and documentary reenactments. It wasn’t until
visiting the site in person, however, that I had an experience that really changed the
way I looked at the battle.
I was standing on the ﬁeld that day looking at a panoramic painting. This image
was depicting the same scenery in front of me, but with the rage of war inﬂicted
upon it. I glanced at the painting and then the landscape behind it, identifying the
same hills and slant of the horizon line. Then I felt something. It was as if in that
moment the frame of the image faded away and the wounded soldiers, the fallen
horses, and the exploding cannons had taken a presence, once again, in that space.
At that moment, I could feel the sorrow and destruction that had visited this now
very peaceful place. The previously abstract event of “Gettysburg” now had a very
personal and emotional familiarity. I could see that day as clearly as any other in my
own life, and although we were separated by centuries, these soldiers now had a
tangible humanity.
It can be difﬁcult to place yourself in a space and time that feels so disconnected
and foreign from your own; that moment needs translation into a personal form to
take relevance. It is during moments of immersion that these connections take
place. This is the importance of an immersive experience: each new connection
made provides increased empathy and broadens our personal understanding.
So why aren’t we constantly in a state of immersion? Our nervous system is only
capable of processing approximately 110 bits of information per second (as a point
of reference, being in a conversation requires 60 bits per second) and immediate
concerns related to work, family, and basic needs like eating take up most or all of
our available processing capacity [4]. Although this explanation is very calculated,
we can all recognize that our ability to focus has a limit, which is why we shift our
504
D.J. Reichenbach

attention from one thing to another. In order to break us out of these routines and
expand our thinking a trigger is needed, and this trigger can take many forms. One
of these forms is through exploiting the limits of our physical senses.
39.3
Modes of Physical Perception
Before we look at how immersive experiences are created, it’s important to
understand how time and space are interpreted through our physical senses. Each
innovation in art and technology is the result of a new discovery of an ability or,
just as importantly, a limitation which affects how we perceive our surroundings. In
this section, I will focus speciﬁcally on how depth, color and light, and time are
perceived and how those elements are conveyed through art and technology.
39.3.1
Depth
A few years ago, I was teaching a University level image-making course to a
mixture of art and science students. One exercise in the course required students to
manipulate color values and scale in Photoshop to create a landscape scene. After a
few frustrating attempts, a computer programming major reached out for help and
we reviewed his work during a meeting. His image depicted an apple tree and a
house, but there was no depth to the image. For starters, the tree and the house were
similar sizes. Furthermore, all of the colors in his scene had the same value: the
grass and leaves were bright green, the apples were bright red, and the house was a
bright yellow. Lastly, every color was solid with no gradation in value from edge to
edge.
When I asked the student how the different objects in his scene—a tree, a house,
and a ﬁeld—related to each other in terms of depth, he explained that the house was
supposed to be far off in the distance with the tree in the foreground. “Let’s work
with the house ﬁrst,” I said, “and see how making it bigger or smaller affects its
depth in the scene.” As I started to manipulate the house to make it smaller, I could
sense that he was starting to understand the concept. When the house was signif-
icantly smaller than the tree, he stopped me.
“Right there! Wow, that really makes a difference.”
“Next,” I said, “let’s change the color of the grass so that some of it appears
closer and some appears farther away.” I created a gradient for the ground, making
the grass near the tree in the foreground a dark green and with the color growing
increasingly brighter as it got closer to the house. “Finally,” I said, “there is no sky
in this image. Let’s create a horizon line so we can orient where the ground meets
the sky.” His eyes widened.
“That looks amazing!”
39

505

I could sense that at that moment the lesson really clicked. His work improved
over the course of the semester and he was able to critically evaluate visual cues in
an image and apply them to his own work. That had been his “Ah-ha!” moment.
I bring up this example because being able to recognize or create a
three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface is not something we can
inherently do. In fact, it is physically impossible for us to see true three-dimensional
space; the image captured by the retina in each eye is two-dimensional, with the
third dimension being created by the stereoscopic effect of our binocular vision [1,
p. 88].
Recreating this sense of depth had long challenged artists. It wasn’t until the
ﬁfteenth century, when ﬁxed-point perspective was introduced, that we were able to
communicate three-dimensional attributes successfully [1, p. 88]. Fixed-point
perspective and other visual techniques use cues from our own perception to
communicate spatial relationships in a scene. For example, in animation, depth is
often created in a scene by designing the foreground, middle ground, and back-
ground as separate elements. In the foreground, elements appear larger, have a
darker value, and will move faster as we pass by them. Elements in the background
tend to be lighter, smaller, have less contrast, and will move more slowly in the
frame as you travel through a scene.
Stereoscopic ﬁlmmaking, on the other hand, creates depth not from a perceptual
cue but by recreating our binocular vision. In stereoscopic ﬁlmmaking, two cam-
eras, each imitating what the left and right eyes of a person would see, capture the
on-screen subject. Depth is created by the relationship of an object between the left
image and the right image; the greater the difference in its position between the left
and right image, the greater depth the object will appear to have in the stereoscopic
frame. Like ﬁxed-point perspective, however, this method does not create a true
depth, but rather relies on the brain to stitch the two separate images together into a
cohesive whole. Conclusively, if depth is a function of our mind putting together
the two images received from our eyes, do different individuals perceive different
depths? Is there a “true depth”?
An additional nuance is that not everyone interprets information from images in
the same way. In the example with my student, although he could identify that the
image lacked depth he could not identify why. Donald Hoffmann, in his book,
Visual Intelligence, cites a case study about a boy who, after surgery, is able to see
after being blind his whole life from congenital cataracts.
During the study, the boy had problems distinguishing between a cat and a dog
until he was able to identify the animal through touch. In another instance, it was
observed that it took months for him to recognize two-dimensional images as
representing solid structures, considering them to be only abstract, ﬂat planes
comprised of colors. Then after realizing their representation, he was surprised that
although they looked “round and uneven” that they were still ﬂat to the touch [6,
pp. 17–19].
These examples illustrate that visual depictions are not complete replications of
reality, but rather that they simply carry information to communicate attributes of it.
The ability to recognize visual cues and relate them to spatial depth required a
506
D.J. Reichenbach

moment of insight. Through moments of immersion, starting at a young age, we
gain the ability to receive these new discoveries and expand our visual perception.
39.3.2
Light and Color
During my time in graduate school I experienced a transformative moment relating
to light and color. I was taking a video course and we were discussing the additive
color system: the mode of color used in light-based technologies such as projectors
and television monitors. To demonstrate the additive color system, the instructor
held color gels—thin layers of laminate that change the color of a light when
positioned in front of it—up to a spot light projecting onto a nearby wall. He had
three gels on hand: one red, one blue, and one green. “These are the primary colors
of the additive light system,” he announced.
“Green?” I thought. “Aren’t the primary colors red, blue, and yellow?”
After holding each gel up in front of the light, reproducing the red, blue, and
green colors as expected, he started to mix the colors. “Secondary colors,” he said,
“are created when the primary colors are mixed. When red and blue mix, it creates
magenta, and when blue and green mix we get cyan.”
“This makes sense,” I thought, “magenta has some red and blue in it, just as cyan
has a bit of green and blue.”
“Finally,” he continued, “red and green light combine to make yellow.” He held
the red and green gels up against the light and, to my surprise, in the space where
the gels overlapped the light was indeed yellow.
This moment inspired further research into how light is processed by the human
eye. When light waves hit the back of your retina, it activates one of two types of
receptor cells, rods or cones. Rods are active in low light situations and consist of
one type only. Cones become active in well-lit environments and come in three
types that correspond to the colors red, green, and blue [7].
So what about yellow? Actually, we cannot perceive true yellow, as the color we
see is the result of both our red and green cones being stimulated to create the
yellow color we perceive. This is true of all non-red, green, and blue colors; those
three cones, stimulated in different proportions, create the millions of colors we
perceive. This phenomenon is completely perceptual; if our sight were engineered
differently (having instead blue, green, and ultraviolet cones) how might our per-
ception change?
Just as the discovery of depth perception cues inspired ﬁxed-point perspective
and stereoscopic imaging, discoveries in how we perceive light and color have
inﬂuenced our technology. All light-based technology (such as video, computer
monitors, and digital cameras) operate using the same RGB color system as our
eyes, creating all of the colors you see using varied mixtures of red, green, and blue.
By extending our physical sense of light and color into our technology we continue
to create images replicating our own reality.

507

39.3.3
Time
Unlike depth and color, time is a much more difﬁcult concept to perceive in a
physical sense. One can argue that we can detect time through vision, such as when
the changing direction and color of sunlight can signal its passage and duration [2,
p. 312]. In this way, the change in the light is perceived through the contrast of the
images we observe over time; in a sense we say that we move from day to night. Is
time perceived through movement?
I will not delve into the concept of motion perception as an entire ﬁeld of study;
however, I will touch upon the topic of persistence of vision, the phenomenon that
enables us to perceive motion in video and animation. To illustrate persistence of
vision for yourself, hold a pencil or pen in your hand and use it to tap on the table at
a moderate pace. Focus on the tip of the pen and you’ll notice a streaking effect,
which, in video, we call motion blur. What causes this blurring effect? If the tip of
the pen is only in one position at any given time, how do we see it in more than one
place?
Similar to depth and color perception, our eyes and brain have limits in terms of
deciphering visual information related to movement and time. When an image
reaches the back of our retina it takes a moment to fade as the new image is
processed. Motion pictures exploit this latency to create a sense of movement, as it
is presently impossible to display the billions of images required to ﬁll every
nanosecond of a ﬁlm. In fact, the current frame rate for most motion pictures is
much lower, at only twenty-four images per second. It is through persistence of
vision that we are able to stitch these separate images together into one cohesive
whole. Furthermore, this is another example of creating technology that imitates
and leverages our perceptual attributes.
Some of the ﬁrst motion pictures documented everyday events of the human
experience, for example the famous Lumière ﬁlm, L’arrivée d’un train en gare de
La Ciotat (The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station). This short ﬁlm depicted a
train arriving at La Ciotat Station in France, and was shot from a human per-
spective: the lens provided a ﬁeld of vision similar to that of the naked eye, the
camera was set at eye level, and the camera was static—no movement—during the
entirety of the shot.
In the century to follow however, experimentation in camera techniques and
editing expanded the ability of the moving image to communicate. We saw the rise
of the montage, a technique for condensing the passage of time, and the extreme
close-up, which brought us closer to a subject than we could achieve in our physical
lives. Through varying the playback rate, time could move forward, backward, and
at unnatural speeds (like slow motion), and spatial relations could be communicated
by sequencing a series shots from different angles as opposed to showing the entire
scene in one image.
Animation pushed this experimentation further still by enabling abstract char-
acters to exude human characteristics and for stories to be told through movement
and rhythm of color, line, and texture. The addition of sound uniﬁed the visual and
508
D.J. Reichenbach

acoustic spaces, an attribute that distinguished it from previous art forms such as
painting, literature, music, and others.
By leveraging the physical anomaly of seeing sequential images as movement,
we opened a new door of possibilities to how we perceive the world. As with depth
and light and color, we used newfound knowledge of the human perception of time
to develop re-creations of our physical experience. Through expanded technological
advancements in the manipulation of time and space, new mediums of communi-
cation have been developed to enhance our perception and trigger immersive
experiences.
39.4
How Are Immersive Experiences Achieved?
39.4.1
Breaking the Frame
Thinking “outside the box” is a metaphor that is commonly used to describe the
ability to see something from a new perspective. In relation to this essay, it rep-
resents the transformative moment of awareness experienced through immersion.
While these moments of immersion grant us opportunities to see outside the box,
there are barriers in our daily lives that keep us from this expanded perspective,
many of which are literally box-like in shape.
Our workspaces, our modes of transportation, and many of our mediums of
expression have embedded the presence of “the box.” Have a look around. As I
type this I am looking at my box-shaped screen, with a “window” open to a
box-shaped text document, and I am sitting in a box-shaped room ﬁlled with
rectangular books, shelves, tables, and chairs. In fact, the most prominent
non-box-shaped object in the room is a circular clock; what does that say of how we
perceive space versus how we perceive time?
In the theory that, “The medium is the message,” Marshall McLuhan suggests
that it’s not necessarily the content, but rather the form that inﬂuences how a
message is perceived, and ultimately, that each new form of communication shifts
the way in which a culture perceives its surroundings. He also suggests that in each
new situation and technology is the “ghost of the old one,” in that embedded into
these new methods are artifacts of how we previously perceived our experiences [8
p. 83].
In alignment with McLuhan’s research, I believe we are in an age where we have
achieved the medium, namely virtual and augmented reality, to break outside of the
box perceptually. However this medium, as with all other mediums, began by
reﬂecting the past. For example, when cyberspace ﬁrst became accessible to the
public, this virtual space integrated many attributes of our physical space. When
you opened a portal to the Internet, you opened a new “window.” When you
entered a space to connect with others you entered a “chat room.” Although
39
Losing Time and Space: Experiencing Immersion
509

cyberspace has expanded beyond these initial boundaries, it is still restrained by the
spatial qualities of the screen you access it through. The current shift toward virtual
and augmented reality has the power to break the frame, immersing a viewer inside
the medium itself. Of course, content will always play a role in communicating a
message and experience to the viewer, but how will this new medium change the
way in which we perceive? How will this change our awareness of our
environment?
39.4.2
Immersive Mediums
Much of my personal artwork explores breaking the frame, and in the past several
years I have focused on creating ﬁlms for the fulldome, or planetarium, theater.
A predecessor to virtual reality technologies, this venue has offered a space for
experiencing 360-degree immersive ﬁlms, breaking the traditional frame of
ﬁlmmaking.
The planetarium was originally designed to mimic the experience of stargazing,
situating the audience in an immersive physical situation. Through its hemispherical
design, once the show begins the walls of the theater seem to disappear, simulating
a nighttime sky. Much like the early Lumière ﬁlm at the train station, with many
planetarium shows the viewer’s perspective is static and “natural” as it simply
recreates the act of being outside on a perfect night for stargazing. As advancements
were made in projection technology, however, this convex surface could host ﬁlms
that moved the viewer through other environments, both abstract and physical.
In his paper, “The Language of Immersive Cinema,” Daniel Neafus, co-founder
of IMERSA, an organization promoting the advancement of immersive technolo-
gies, explains what this new medium means for viewer experience:
When our audiences are immersed in the seamless enveloping sensations of fulldome, they
can become involved and truly engrossed in the experience. This intellectually stimulating,
virtual reality can fully occupy the attention of participants both physically and emotion-
ally. Audiences today appear to be moving beyond their passive observation of framed
media and are discovering new ways to participate in immersive storytelling [9, p. 2].
Immersive mediums, with their capacity to engage the full attention of their
audiences, have potential to trigger moments of immersion for viewers. These
mediums also have the capacity to expand our perceptual boundaries. In his article,
“Towards an Immersive Intelligence,” author Joseph Nechvatal suggests that
extending the ﬁeld of view to the peripheral not only affects how we view the
frame, but also has power to focus our point of view beyond the edges of our
current concept of time, space, and perception [10, 418]. If this is true, can a
heightened awareness of one’s own perception also lead to an ability to control it?
510

39.4.3
Abstract, but not Too Abstract
One last topic I’d like to touch upon is abstraction, another powerful tool that can
trigger an immersive experience or moment of insight. In sharing my own ﬁlms
with audiences, I have noticed that when the content is too abstract they have a
difﬁcult time connecting to the ﬁlm. As it is a natural tendency for people to want to
connect their present experience to a past one, many viewers lose interest when
what they see and hear has no point of reference to their own personal history.
After creating a handful of ﬁlms that strictly explored combinations of color,
light, and texture in very abstract ways, I decided to put a tangible image in my next
ﬁlm. That ﬁlm, A Moment of Silence, starts as a journey through a forest from the
perspective of a traveller. In the beginning of the ﬁlm, trees move through the
frame, utilizing depth, light, and color cues, to recreate the experience in a natural
way. Slowly, the forest is inﬁltrated by abstract imagery until suddenly it bursts into
complete abstraction of light, color, and movement. Towards the end of the ﬁlm, the
abstract imagery gradually fades away and the forest returns, restoring the natural
viewpoint of the traveller.
The reaction to this ﬁlm was overwhelmingly positive, and many people com-
mented that they felt transported during the screening. What made this ﬁlm more
effective than the others was that it provided viewers with a familiar point of
reference; in this case, the trees and how they moved naturally through the frame.
This grounding in real-world experience gave the abstract section that followed
more prominence. It was only after viewers could place themselves in the ﬁlm that
they were willing to be challenged with something outside of their viewpoint.
Through my experience, I’ve found that as long as this jump from reality to
abstraction is not too far, most viewers are willing to go along with it.
39.5
Conclusion
Immersive experiences challenge our perceptions. These experiences shape how we
engage with one another and our surrounding environment. Shifts in perception
craft new ways of communicating and bring us closer to understanding ourselves
beyond our physical sense.
Examples in this article have demonstrated that by exposing the abilities and
limitations of human perception we are able to conceptualize beyond them. With
each new discovery we advance the methods used to replicate this perception: from
communicating three dimensions on a two-dimensional surface, to manipulating
time through a series of images.
Ultimately we are creating ways to communicate, to both ourselves and to
others, our perception of what is real. This is important because as a collective we
determine the course the future will take and how we ﬁnd our place in it. Through
39

511

innovations in communication mediums such as virtual reality, we are on the brink
of a new development in consciousness that will alter what we are able to perceive
and, as a result, what we understand as reality.

Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding
One of the most profound insights into language and mind, I think, was Descartes’s
recognition of what we may call “the creative aspect of language use”: the ordinary
use of language is typically innovative without bounds, appropriate to circum-
stances but not caused by them—a crucial distinction—and can engender thoughts
in others that they recognize they could have expressed themselves. Given the
intimate relation of language and thought, these are properties of human thought as
well. This insight is the primary basis for Descartes’s scientiﬁc theory of mind and
body. There is no sound reason to question its validity, as far as I am aware. Its
implications, if valid, are far-reaching, among them what it suggests about the limits
of human understanding, as becomes more clear when we consider the place of
these reﬂections in the development of modern science from the earliest days.
It is important to bear in mind that insofar as it was grounded in these terms,
Cartesian dualism was a respectable scientiﬁc theory, proven wrong (in ways that
are often misunderstood), but that is the common fate of respectable theories.
The background is the so-called “mechanical philosophy”—mechanical science
in modern terminology. This doctrine, originating with Galileo and his contem-
poraries, held that the world is a machine, operating by mechanical principles, much
like the remarkable devices that were being constructed by skilled artisans of the
day and that stimulated the scientiﬁc imagination much as computers do today;
devices with gears, levers, and other mechanical components, interacting through
direct contact with no mysterious forces relating them. The doctrine held that the
entire world is similar: it could in principle be constructed by a skilled artisan, and
was in fact created by a super-skilled artisan. The doctrine was intended to replace
the resort to “occult properties” on the part of the neoscholastics: their appeal to
mysterious sympathies and antipathies, to forms ﬂitting through the air as the means
of perception, the idea that rocks fall and steam rises because they are moving to
their natural place, and similar notions that were mocked by the new science.
The mechanical philosophy provided the very criterion for intelligibility in the
sciences. Galileo insisted that theories are intelligible, in his words, only if we can
“duplicate [their posits] by means of appropriate artiﬁcial devices.” The same
conception, which became the reigning orthodoxy, was maintained and developed

by the other leading ﬁgures of the scientiﬁc revolution: Descartes, Leibniz, Huy-
gens, Newton, and others.
Today Descartes is remembered mainly for his philosophical reﬂections, but he
was primarily a working scientist and presumably thought of himself that way, as
his contemporaries did. His great achievement, he believed, was to have ﬁrmly
established the mechanical philosophy, to have shown that the world is indeed a
machine, that the phenomena of nature could be accounted for in mechanical terms
in the sense of the science of the day. But he discovered phenomena that appeared
to escape the reach of mechanical science. Primary among them, for Descartes, was
the creative aspect of language use, a capacity unique to humans that cannot be
duplicated by machines and does not exist among animals, which in fact were a
variety of machines, in his conception.
As a serious and honest scientist, Descartes therefore invoked a new principle to
accommodate these non-mechanical phenomena, a kind of creative principle. In the
substance philosophy of the day, this was a new substance, res cogitans, which
stood alongside of res extensa. This dichotomy constitutes the mind-body theory in
its scientiﬁc version. Then followed further tasks: to explain how the two sub-
stances interact and to devise experimental tests to determine whether some other
creature has a mind like ours. These tasks were undertaken by Descartes and his
followers, notably Géraud de Cordemoy; and in the domain of language, by the
logician-grammarians of Port Royal and the tradition of rational and philosophical
grammar that succeeded them, not strictly Cartesian but inﬂuenced by Cartesian
ideas.
All of this is normal science, and like much normal science, it was soon shown
to be incorrect. Newton demonstrated that one of the two substances does not exist:
res extensa. The properties of matter, Newton showed, escape the bounds of the
mechanical philosophy. To account for them it is necessary to resort to interaction
without contact. Not surprisingly, Newton was condemned by the great physicists
of the day for invoking the despised occult properties of the neo-scholastics.
Newton largely agreed. He regarded action at a distance, in his words, as “so great
an Absurdity, that I believe no Man who has in philosophical matters a competent
Faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it.” Newton however argued that these ideas,
though absurd, were not “occult” in the traditional despised sense. Nevertheless, by
invoking this absurdity, we concede that we do not understand the phenomena of
the material world. To quote one standard scholarly source, “By ‘understand’
Newton still meant what his critics meant: ‘understand in mechanical terms of
contact action’.”
It is commonly believed that Newton showed that the world is a machine,
following mechanical principles, and that we can therefore dismiss “the ghost in the
machine,” the mind, with appropriate ridicule. The facts are the opposite: Newton
exorcised the machine, leaving the ghost intact. The mind-body problem in its
scientiﬁc form did indeed vanish as unformulable, because one of its terms, body,
does not exist in any intelligible form. Newton knew this very well, and so did his
great contemporaries.
514
Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding

John Locke wrote that we remain in “incurable ignorance of what we desire to
know” about matter and its effects, and no “science of bodies [that provides true
explanations is] within our reach.” Nevertheless, he continued, he was “convinced
by the judicious Mr. Newton’s incomparable book, that it is too bold a presumption
to limit God’s power, in this point, by my narrow conceptions.” Though gravitation
of matter to matter is “inconceivable to me”, nevertheless, as Newton demonstrated,
we must recognize that it is within God’s power “to put into bodies, powers and
ways of operations, above what can be derived from our idea of body, or can be
explained by what we know of matter.” And thanks to Newton’s work, we know
that God “has done so.” The properties of the material world are “inconceivable to
us,” but real nevertheless. Newton understood the quandary. For the rest of his life,
he sought some way to overcome the absurdity, suggesting various possibilities, but
not committing himself to any of them because he could not show how they might
work and, as he always insisted, he would not “feign hypotheses” beyond what can
be experimentally established.
Replacing the theological with a cognitive framework, David Hume agreed with
these conclusions. In his history of England, Hume describes Newton as “the
greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the
species.” His most spectacular achievement was that while he “seemed to draw the
veil from some of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the same time the
imperfections of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored [Nature’s] ulti-
mate secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain.”
Modern commentators observe that Einstein’s relativity theory provides a local
interpretation of gravitational attraction, overcoming the non-locality that was an
absurdity to Newton and others. But while the observation is correct, it does not
bear on the recognition that the world is unintelligible to us. Such concepts as
curved space-time are no less remote than action-at-a distance from the mechanical
philosophy that provided the very criterion of intelligibility and understanding for
the great founders of modern science—and that also seems to be basically our
common sense conception of physical reality and the material world.
As the import of Newton’s discoveries was gradually assimilated in the sciences,
the “absurdity’ recognized by Newton and his great contemporaries became sci-
entiﬁc common sense. The properties of the natural world are inconceivable to us,
but that does not matter. The goals of scientiﬁc inquiry were implicitly restricted:
from the kind of conceivability that was a criterion for true understanding in early
modern science from Galileo through Newton and beyond, to something much
more limited: intelligibility of theories about the world. This seems to me a step of
considerable signiﬁcance in the history of human thought and inquiry, more so than
is generally recognized, though it has been understood by historians of science.
Friedrich Lange, in his classic 19th century history of materialism, observed that
we have “so accustomed ourselves to the abstract notion of forces, or rather to a
notion hovering in a mystic obscurity between abstraction and concrete compre-
hension, that we no longer ﬁnd any difﬁculty in making one particle of matter act
upon another without immediate contact,… through void space without any
material link. From such ideas the great mathematicians and physicists of the
Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding
515

seventeenth century were far removed. They were all in so far genuine Materialists
in the sense of ancient Materialism that they made immediate contact a condition of
inﬂuence.” This transition over time is “one of the most important turning-points in
the whole history of Materialism,” he continued, depriving the doctrine of much
signiﬁcance, if any at all. “What Newton held to be so great an absurdity that no
philosophic thinker could light upon it, is prized by posterity as Newton’s great
discovery of the harmony of the universe!”
Similar conclusions are commonplace in the history of science. In the
mid-twentieth century, Alexander Koyré observed that Newton demonstrated that
“a purely materialistic pattern of nature is utterly impossible (and a purely mate-
rialistic or mechanistic physics, such as that of Lucretius or of Descartes, is utterly
impossible, too)”; his mathematical physics required the “admission into the body
of science of incomprehensible and inexplicable ‘facts’ imposed up on us by
empiricism,” by what is observed and our conclusions from these observations.
With the disappearance of the scientiﬁc concept of body (material, physical,
etc.), what happens to the “second substance,” res cogitans/mind, which was left
untouched by Newton’s startling discoveries? A plausible answer was suggested by
John Locke, also within the reigning theological framework. He wrote that just as
God added to matter such inconceivable properties as gravitational attraction, he
might also have “superadded” to matter the capacity of thought. In the years that
followed, Locke’s “God” was reinterpreted as “nature,” a move that opened the
topic to inquiry. That path was pursued extensively in the years that followed,
leading to the conclusion that mental processes are properties of certain kinds of
organized matter. Restating the fairly common understanding of the time, Charles
Darwin, in his early notebooks, wrote that there is no need to regard thought, “a
secretion of the brain,” as “more wonderful than gravity, a property of matter”—all
inconceivable to us, but that is not a fact about the external world; rather, about our
cognitive limitations.
It is of some interest that all of this has been forgotten, and is now being
rediscovered. Nobel laureate Francis Crick, famous for the discovery of DNA,
formulated what he called the “astonishing hypothesis” that our mental and emo-
tional states are “in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells
and their associated molecules.” In the philosophical literature, this rediscovery has
sometimes been regarded as a radical new idea in the study of mind. To cite one
prominent source, the radical new idea is “the bold assertion that mental phenomena
are entirely natural and caused by the neurophysiological activities of the brain.” In
fact, the many proposals of this sort reiterate, in virtually the same words, formu-
lations of centuries ago, after the traditional mind-body problem became unfor-
mulable with Newton’s demolition of the only coherent notion of body (or physical,
material, etc.). For example, 18th century chemist/philosopher Joseph Priestley’s
conclusion that properties “termed mental” reduce to “the organical structure of the
brain,” stated in different words by Locke, Hume, Darwin, and many others, and
almost inescapable, it would seem, after the collapse of the mechanical philosophy
that provided the foundations for early modern science, and its criteria of
intelligibility.
516
Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding

The last decade of the twentieth century was designated “the Decade of the
Brain.” In introducing a collection of essays reviewing its results, neuroscientist
Vernon Mountcastle formulated the guiding theme of the volume as the thesis of the
new biology that “Things mental, indeed minds, are emergent properties of brains,
[though] these emergences are…produced by principles that… we do not yet
understand”—again reiterating eighteenth century insights in virtually the same
words.
The phrase “we do not yet understand,” however, should strike a note of caution.
We might recall Bertrand Russell’s observation in 1927 that chemical laws “cannot
at present be reduced to physical laws.” That was true, leading eminent scientists,
including Nobel laureates, to regard chemistry as no more than a mode of com-
putation that could predict experimental results, but not real science. Soon after
Russell wrote, it was discovered that his observation, though correct, was under-
stated. Chemical laws never would be reducible to physical laws, as physics was
then
understood.
After
physics
underwent
radical
changes,
with
the
quantum-theoretic revolution, the new physics was uniﬁed with a virtually
unchanged chemistry, but there was never reduction in the anticipated sense.
There may be some lessons here for neuroscience and philosophy of mind.
Contemporary neuroscience is hardly as well-established as physics was a century
ago. There are what seem to me to be cogent critiques of its foundational
assumptions, notably recent work by cognitive neuroscientists C.R. Gallistel and
Adam Philip King. The common slogan that study of mind is neuroscience at an
abstract level might turn out to be just as misleading as comparable statements
about chemistry and physics 90 years ago. Uniﬁcation may take place, but that
might require radical rethinking of the neurosciences, perhaps guided by compu-
tational theories of cognitive processes, as Gallistel and King suggest.
The development of chemistry after Newton also has lessons for neuroscience
and cognitive science. The 18th century chemist Joseph Black recommended that
“chemical afﬁnity be received as a ﬁrst principle, which we cannot explain any
more than Newton could explain gravitation, and let us defer accounting for the
laws of afﬁnity, till we have established such a body of doctrine as he has estab-
lished concerning the laws of gravitation.” The course Black outlined is the one that
was actually followed as chemistry proceeded to establish a rich body of doctrine.
Historian of chemistry Arnold Thackray observes that the “triumphs” of chemistry
were “built on no reductionist foundation but rather achieved in isolation from the
newly emerging science of physics.” Interestingly, Thackray continues, Newton
and his followers did attempt to “pursue the thoroughly Newtonian and reductionist
task of uncovering the general mathematical laws which govern all chemical
behavior” and to develop a principled science of chemical mechanisms based on
physics and its concepts of interactions among “the ultimate permanent particles of
matter.” But the Newtonian program was undercut by Dalton’s “astonishingly
successful weight-quantiﬁcation of chemical units,” Thackray continues, shifting
“the whole area of philosophical debate among chemists from that of chemical
mechanisms (the why? of reaction) to that of chemical units (the what? and how
much?),” a theory that “was profoundly antiphysicalist and anti-Newtonian in its
Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding
517

rejection of the unity of matter, and its dismissal of short-range forces.” Continuing,
Thackray writes that “Dalton’s ideas were chemically successful. Hence they have
enjoyed the homage of history, unlike the philosophically more coherent, if less
successful, reductionist schemes of the Newtonians.”
Adopting contemporary terminology, we might say that Dalton disregarded the
“explanatory gap” between chemistry and physics by ignoring the underlying
physics, much as post-Newtonian physicists disregarded the explanatory gap
between Newtonian dynamics and the mechanical philosophy by rejecting the
latter, and thereby tacitly lowering the goals of science in a highly signiﬁcant way,
as I mentioned.
Contemporary studies of mind are deeply troubled by the “explanatory gap”
between the science of mind and neuroscience—in particular, between computa-
tional theories of cognition, including language, and neuroscience. I think they
would be well-advised to take seriously the history of chemistry. Today’s task is to
develop a “body of doctrine” to explain what appear to be the critically signiﬁcant
phenomena of language and mind, much as chemists did. It is of course wise to
keep the explanatory gap in mind, to seek ultimate uniﬁcation, and to pursue what
seem to be promising steps towards uniﬁcation, while nevertheless recognizing that
as often in the past, uniﬁcation may not be reduction, but rather revision of what is
regarded as the “fundamental discipline,” the reduction basis, the brain sciences in
this case.
Locke and Hume, and many less-remembered ﬁgures of the day, understood that
much of the nature of the world is “inconceivable” to us. There were actually two
different kinds of reasons for this. For Locke and Hume, the reasons were primarily
epistemological. Hume in particular developed the idea that we can only be con-
ﬁdent of immediate impressions, of “appearances.” Everything else is a mental
construction. In particular, and of crucial signiﬁcance, that is true of identity
through time, problems that trace back to the pre-Socratics: the identity of a river or
a tree or most importantly a person as they change through time. These are mental
constructions; we cannot know whether they are properties of the world, a meta-
physical reality. As Hume put the matter, we must maintain “a modest skepticism to
a certain degree, and a fair confession of ignorance in subjects, that exceed all
human capacity”—which for Hume includes virtually everything beyond appear-
ances. We must “refrain from disquisitions concerning their real nature and oper-
ations.” It is the imagination that leads us to believe that we experience external
continuing objects, including a mind or self. The imagination, furthermore, is “a
kind of magical faculty in the soul, which…is inexplicable by the utmost efforts of
human understanding,” so Hume argued.
A different kind of reason why the nature of the world is inconceivable to us was
provided by “the judicious Mr. Newton,” who apparently was not interested in the
epistemological problems that vexed Locke and Hume. Newton scholar Andrew
Janiak concludes that Newton regarded such global skepticism as “irrelevant—he
takes the possibility of our knowledge of nature for granted.” For Newton, “the
primary epistemic questions confronting us are raised by physical theory itself.”
Locke and Hume, as I mentioned, took quite seriously the new science-based
518
Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding

skepticism that resulted from Newton’s demolition of the mechanical philosophy,
which had provided the very criterion of intelligibility for the scientiﬁc revolution.
That is why Hume lauded Newton for having “restored [Nature’s] ultimate secrets
to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain.”
For these quite different kinds of reasons, the great ﬁgures of the scientiﬁc
revolution and the Enlightenment believed that there are phenomena that fall
beyond human understanding. Their reasoning seems to me substantial, and not
easily dismissed. But contemporary doctrine is quite different. The conclusions are
regarded as a dangerous heresy. They are derided as “the new mysterianism,” a
term coined by philosopher Owen Flanagan, who deﬁned it as “a postmodern
position designed to drive a railroad spike through the heart of scientism.” Flanagan
is referring speciﬁcally to explanation of consciousness, but the same concerns hold
of mental processes in general.
The “new mysterianism” is compared today with the “old mysterianism,”
Cartesian dualism, its fate typically misunderstood. To repeat, Cartesian dualism
was a perfectly respectable scientiﬁc doctrine, disproven by Newton, who exorcised
the machine, leaving the ghost intact, contrary to what is commonly believed.
The “new mysterianism,” I believe, is misnamed. It should be called “truism”—
at least, for anyone who accepts the major ﬁndings of modern biology, which
regards humans as part of the organic world. If so, then they will be like all other
organisms in having a genetic endowment that enables them to grow and develop to
their mature form. By simple logic, the endowment that makes this possible also
excludes other paths of development. The endowment that yields scope also
establishes limits. What enables us to grow legs and arms, and a mammalian visual
system, prevents us from growing wings and having an insect visual system.
All of this is indeed truism, and for non-mystics, the same should be expected to
hold for cognitive capacities. We understand this well for other organisms. Thus we
are not surprised to discover that rats are unable to run prime number mazes no
matter how much training they receive; they simply lack the relevant concept in
their cognitive repertoire. By the same token, we are not surprised that humans are
incapable of the remarkable navigational feats of ants and bees; we simply lack the
cognitive capacities, though we can sometimes duplicate their feats with sophisti-
cated instruments. The truisms extend to higher mental faculties. For such reasons,
we should, I think, be prepared to join the distinguished company of Newton,
Locke, Hume and other dedicated mysterians.
For accuracy, we should qualify the concept of “mysteries” by relativizing it to
organisms. Thus what is a mystery for rats might not be a mystery for humans, and
what is a mystery for humans is instinctive for ants and bees.
Dismissal of mysterianism seems to me one illustration of a widespread form of
dualism, a kind of epistemological and methodological dualism, which tacitly
adopts the principle that study of mental aspects of the world should proceed in
some fundamentally different way from study of what are considered physical
aspects of the world, rejecting what are regarded as truisms outside the domain of
mental processes. This new dualism seems to me truly pernicious, unlike Cartesian
Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding
519

dualism, which was respectable science. The new methodological dualism, in
contrast, seems to me to have nothing to recommend it.
Far from bewailing the existence of mysteries-for-humans, we should be
extremely grateful for it. With no limits to growth and development, our cognitive
capacities would also have no scope. Similarly, if the genetic endowment imposed
no constraints on growth and development of an organism it could become only a
shapeless amoeboid creature, reﬂecting accidents of an unanalyzed environment,
each quite unlike the next. Classical aesthetic theory recognized the same relation
between scope and limits. Without rules, there can be no genuinely creative activity,
even when creative work challenges and revises prevailing rules.
Contemporary rejection of mysterianism—that is, truism—is quite widespread.
One recent example that has received considerable attention is an interesting and
informative book by physicist David Deutsch. He writes that potential progress is
“unbounded” as a result of the achievements of the Enlightenment and early
modern science, which directed science to the search for best explanations. As
philosopher/physicist David Albert expounds his thesis, “with the introduction of
that particular habit of concocting and evaluating new hypotheses, there was a sense
in which we could do anything. The capacities of a community that has mastered
that method to survive, and to learn, and to remake the world according to its
inclinations, are (in the long run) literally, mathematically, inﬁnite.”
The quest for better explanations may well indeed be inﬁnite, but inﬁnite is of
course not the same as limitless. English is inﬁnite, but doesn’t include Greek. The
integers are an inﬁnite set, but do not include the reals. I cannot discern any
argument here that addresses the concerns and conclusions of the great mysterians
of the scientiﬁc revolution and the Enlightenment.
We are left with a serious and challenging scientiﬁc inquiry: to determine the
innate components of our cognitive nature in language, perception, concept for-
mation, reﬂection, inference, theory construction, artistic creation, and all other
domains of life, including the most ordinary ones. By pursuing this task we may
hope to determine the scope and limits of human understanding, while recognizing
that some differently structured intelligence might regard human mysteries as
simple problems and wonder that we cannot ﬁnd the answers, much as we can
observe the inability of rats to run prime number mazes because of the very design
of their cognitive nature.
There is no contradiction in supposing that we might be able to probe the limits
of human understanding and try to sharpen the boundary between problems that fall
within our cognitive range and mysteries that do not. There are possible experi-
mental inquiries. Another approach would be to take seriously the concerns of the
great ﬁgures of the early scientiﬁc revolution and the Enlightenment: to pay
attention to what they found “inconceivable,” and particularly their reasons. The
“mechanical philosophy” itself has a claim to be an approximation to common
sense understanding of the world, a suggestion that might be clariﬁed by experi-
mental inquiry. Despite much sophisticated commentary, it is also hard to escape
the force of Descartes’s conviction that free will is “the noblest thing” we have, that
“there is nothing we comprehend more evidently and more perfectly” and that “it
520
Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding

would be absurd” to doubt something that “we comprehend intimately, and expe-
rience within ourselves” merely because it is “by its nature incomprehensible to us,”
if indeed we do not “have intelligence enough” to understand the workings of mind,
as he speculated. Concepts of determinacy and randomness fall within our intel-
lectual grasp. But it might turn out that “free actions of men” cannot be accom-
modated in these terms, including the creative aspect of language and thought. If so,
that might be a matter of cognitive limitations—which would not preclude an
intelligible theory of such actions, far as this is from today’s scientiﬁc
understanding.
Honesty should lead us to concede, I think, that we understand little more today
about these matters than the Spanish physician-philosopher Juan Huarte did 500
years ago when he distinguished the kind of intelligence humans shared with
animals from the higher grade that humans alone possess and is illustrated in the
creative use of language, and proceeding beyond that, from the still higher grade
illustrated in true artistic and scientiﬁc creativity. Nor do we even know whether
these are questions that lie within the scope of human understanding, or whether
they fall among what Hume took to be Nature’s ultimate secrets, consigned to “that
obscurity in which they ever did and ever will remain.”
