Abstract. The goal of this paper is to present the methodology of constructing a language 
ontology of ‘coherent relations’. We construct an ontology of more abstract concepts by 
combining an upper-level ontology and a middle-level ontology. At the former we use 
theoretical considerations following Sanders et al. (1992, 1993), and at the latter we use 
lexical items through the substitutability test of Knott and Dale (1994).   
Keywords: ontology, coherence relations, connectives 
 
 
1. Introduction 
1.1.Ontology 
‘Ontology’ has recently become one of the most attractive research areas. Even though the 
notion originates from philosophy, there have been many researches within AI or Computer 
Science. Ontology is usually defined as “an explicit specification of a conceptualization,” where 
a “conceptualization is an abstract, simplified view of the world that we wish to represent for 
some purpose” (Gruber 1993: 199). But many constructed ontologies are not consistent, because 
the conceptualization is different according to the interests of researchers. Therefore most 
ontologists make use of languages which are considered to reflect the objects of 
conceptualization objectively.  
If we consider that an element of conceptualization is a concept, it is followed that the notion 
of ontology is related closely with languages. As we know, the modern linguistics is based on 
the ‘meaning triangle’ (Ogden and Richards 1923). At the triangle, the connection of a symbol 
with an object is mediated by a concept, and each element constructs its own system. So the 
system of symbols, i.e. a network of words, is similar to the system of concepts, i.e. an 
ontology. Therefore we can assume, that an ontology can be constructed indirectly by means of 
words. 
The network of words is often called ‘Language Ontology’. Nickles et al. (2007) considers 
Language Ontology as an answer to the following question: “What kinds of things do people 
talk as if there are?” Further the notion of Language Ontology is defined as “a conceptualization 
or categorization of what normal everyday human language can talk about” (Zaefferer 2002).

1.2. Goals 
The goal of this paper is to present the methodology of constructing the language ontology 
about ‘coherent relations’. Some previous language ontologies such as WordNet, etc. have been 
restricted to the lexical categories such as nouns, verbs, adjective, and adverbs. There were no 
ontologies about abstract notions such as coherent relations which are realized mostly as minor 
categories such as suffixes or connectives.  
For the construction of ontology of coherent relations, we will adopt the following strategy: At 
the upper-level, we will construct the ontology in a top-down manner, reflecting the theoretical 
considerations which are relatively language-independent. But at the middle-level, we will 
proceed with the work in a bottom-up manner. That is we will construct the middle part of the 
ontology by investigating lexical items. Since the construction of all the coherent relations is an 
enormous project, we will focus on the ‘causal relations’ in this paper. 
With the ontology to be constructed we can make a typological analysis about coherence 
relations. For example we can compare the Korean ontology with the English or the Dutch 
ontology presented in Knott (1996). The trend of typological researches is based on the so-
called ‘ontolinguistical’ approach.1
 
2. Coherence 
2.1. Coherence relations 
Discourse is more than a random set of utterances, and shows connectedness. The 
connectedness is captured by the concept of ‘cohesion’ and ‘coherence’. In comparison with 
cohesion, coherence is an abstract concept which language users establish by relating the 
different information units in the text.  
Coherence is divided into ‘referential coherence’ and ‘ relational coherence’ (Sanders and 
Maat  2006). The latter has been investigated under the theme ‘coherence relations’.2 That is, 
under the assumption, that the interpretation of the related segments needs to provide more 
information than is provided by the sum of the segments taken in isolation, text grammarians 
adopt the view that text segments are connected by coherence relations like CAUSE-
CONSEQUENCE between them. Such coherence relations can be made explicit by linguistic 
markers, so-called connectives or cue phrases, but not always, as we see in (1).

It has been disputed, what coherence relations are. Some have insisted that coherence relations 
should be considered as cognitive entities (Hobbs 1979, Mann and Thompson 1988, Sanders et 
al. 1992, 1993). In addition to that, we can find a similar view in Lyons (1977). He divided 
entities into 3 subtypes: first-order entities, second-order entities, and third-order entities. He 
took the third-order entities to be “such abstract entities as proposition, which are outside space 
and time” (ibid. 443p.). Furthermore, he mentioned the possibility of distinction in those 
entities, for example between psychological and non-psychological entities. We think that 
coherence relations in the sense of Sanders et al. (1993) can correspond to those psychological 
third-order entities. 
                                                           
1 “the most reliable basis for any cross-linguistic research lies in the common core of the different 
individual human ontologies. This is the basic tenet of all approaches that can properly be called 
ontology-based linguistics or ontolinguistics for short.” (Schalley and Zaefferer 2007: 3) 
2 The notion is also called as ‘rhetorical relations’ (Mann & Thompson 1988), ‘clause relations’, 
‘discourse relations’, … 
 
246

 
There is no agreement among researchers about the kinds/type of relations and the number of 
relations. For example, Hobbs (1978), Mann and Thompson (1988) etc. hypothesize dozens of 
relations (cf. Hovy 1990).  
With respect to ‘causal relation’, Mann and Thompson (1988) presented a more detailed 
classification by considering speaker’s volition and ordering between two clauses: volitional 
cause, non-volitional cause, volitional result, non-volitional result, purpose. 
 
2.2. Linguistic realizations 
We can sometimes identify the coherence relations at the surface form. In such cases, coherence 
relations can be realized at the sentence level and at the discourse level.  
As for the sentence level, some adverbial/subordinate clauses show the realization of 
coherence relations. According to Thompson and Longacre (1985),  languages of the world use 
3 devices to mark subordinate clauses: (i) subordinating morphemes, (ii) special verb forms, (iii) 
word order. As for the discourse level, discourse markers or cue phrases are typical means to 
represent coherence relations, by which sentences are connected to each other. For example, 
phrases such as as a result, therefore etc. belong to this category.  
In Korean, there are two groups of lexical items which realize coherence relations. The first 
group is a list of suffixes which are attached to the verbal stems of subordinate clauses. The 
concrete coherence relation is determinded by the suffix to be attached. The following shows 
the difference of verbal suffixes at the main clause and at the subordinate clause.  
  
(2) (a) ku-nun   yelsimhi  kongpuha-yss-ta. 
He-TOP  hard      study-PAST-DEC 
‘He studied hard.’ 
(b) ku-nun   yelsimhi  kongpuha-yss-ciman    sihem-ey   tteleci-ess-ta 
He-TOP  hard      study-PAST-although   test-ACC   fail-PAST-DEC 
‘Although he studied hard, he failed the test.’ 
 
The second group is a list of connectives which relate two clauses at the discourse level. The 
example in (3) shows that type.  
 
(3) ku-nun   yelsimhi  kongpuha-yss-ta.  kulemeyto  sihem-ey   tteleci-ess-ta. 
He-TOP  hard      study-PAST        however   test-ACC   fail-PAST-DEC 
‘He studied hard. However, he failed the test.’ 
 
3. Language Ontology 
3.1. Upper-level Ontology 
As we mentioned above, there are a few ontologies about coherence relations. But strictly 
speaking, the ontologies are merely taxonomies which include fewer levels and the smaller 
number of nodes in the hierarchy. Therefore we will try to construct an ontology in the original 
sense.  
As for the upper-lever of the ontology, there is an interesting research which has considered 
some philosophical discussions. Sanders et al. (1992, 1993) presented the classification of 
coherence relations, based on more elementary notions. Following Sanders et al. (1992, 1993), 
we will construct an upper-level ontology. At first we look at their classification. They 
hypothesized four basic notions, each of which can take two alternative values. 
 
z Basic Operation: CAUSAL/ADDITIVE 
CAUSAL relations are those where a ‘relevant’ causal connection exists between the 
spans; all other relations are ADDITIVE. 
 
247

 
z Source of Coherence: SEMANTIC/PRAGMATIC 
It is SEMANTIC if the spans are related in terms of their propositional content and 
PRAGMATIC if they are related because of their illocutionary force. 
z Polarity: POSITIVE/NEGATIVE 
A relation is POSITIVE if its basic operation links the content of the two spans as they 
stand, and NEGATIVE if it links the content of one of the spans to the negation of the 
content of the other span. 
z Order of Segments: BASIC/NON-BASIC 
CAUSAL relations are deemed to have BASIC order if the antecedent is on the left, and 
NON-BASIC order if it is on the right. 
 
Of 4 basic notions, the notion ‘Order of Segment’ is related with the superficial realization. So 
if we neglect the notion and revise the taxonomy of Sanders et al. (1993), we can present the 
upper-level ontology as follows. 
 
CAUSE 
ADDITION 
CAUS-SEM 
CAUS-PRAG 
CAUSE-CONSEQ 
COND-CONSEQ 
ARG-CLAIM 
COND-CLAIM 
ADD-SEM 
ADD-PRAG 
LIST 
OPPOSITION 
EXCEPTION 
ENUMERATION 
CONCESSION
COHERENCE RELATION 
CONTRASTIVE 
CAUSE-CONSEQ 
CONTRASTIVE 
ARG-CLAIM 
 
Figure 1: An upper-level ontology 
 
At first, we can divide coherence relations into ‘cause’ and ‘addition’ according to the ‘source’ 
notion. Next the ‘cause’ is divided into a semantic concept ‘cause-sem’ and a pragmatic concept 
‘caus-prag’ according to the ‘source’ notion. Finally using the ‘polarity’ notion, we can divide 
again the former into ‘cause-consequence/ condition-consequence’ (4ab) and ‘contrastive cause-
consequence’ (4c), and the latter into ‘argument-claim/ condition-claim’ and ‘contrastive 
argument-claim’. We can see the corresponding examples below (Sanders et al. 1993): 
 
(4) (a) Because there is a low-pressure area over Ireland, the bad weather is coming our way. 
  (b) Ready? Then we’re now off on safari. 
  (c) Although the number of similarities between faces is enormous, we do not have the  
    slightest difficulty in distinguishing a very large number of people. 
 
3.2. Middle-level Ontology 
As we have seen above, the upper-level ontology is constructed by philosophical or 
psychological considerations. So the level of the hierarchy and the number of concepts are 
sparse. In this section we try to construct a richer middle-level ontology which is connected 
with the upper-level ontology in Fig. 1.  To simplify the explanation, we restrict ourselves to the 
concept ‘cause-sem’.  
 
248

 
As is well known, the most explicit markers signaling coherence relations are connectives.3 
Although there is no one-to-one correspondence between coherence relations and connectives, 
we can construct the middle-level ontology by examining the distribution of connectives. Knott 
(1996) and Knott and Dale (1994) presented taxonomy of connectives in English and in Dutch. 
As a starting point, let us review their methodology. 
 
3.2.1. Knott and Dale (1994) 
Knott and Dale (1994) classified cue phrases according to their syntactic properties. This 
classification is made by a simple linguistic test, so-called ‘substitutability’. The test calls for 
the judgment of a writer, if a cue phrase can be replaced by another cue phrase.  
 
(5) The bouncers refused us access to the bar,    because          we were wearing jeans. 
                                                     ✓ on the grounds that  
                                                     #  therefore 
                                       
 
In (5), on the grounds that is represented as substitutable for the original cue phrase because, 
whereas therefore is not substitutable for the cue phrase. Seeing concretely, there are 4 
substitutability relationships (Knott and Sanders 1998): 
 
z X is synonymous with Y if in any context where one can be used, the other can also be used. 
z X and Y are exclusive if they can never be substituted for one another in any context. 
z X is a hypernym of Y if whenever Y can be used, so can X; but there are some contexts 
where X can be used and Y cannot. 
z X and Y are contingently substitutable if there are some contexts where they can be 
substituted, other contexts where X can be used and not Y, and still other contexts where Y 
can be used and not X. 
 
Based on that ‘substitutability test’, they presented the taxonomy of cue phrases in English and 
Dutch. But we cannot construct ontology by means of all the 4 relationships. In constructing an 
ontology, we have no means to represent ‘exclusion’ and ‘a contingent substitutability’ 
differently. Therefore we will merge the two relationships into one, and will use in total 3 
relationships in the construction of Korean ontology.  
 
3.2.2. A Korean Ontology 
Next, we illustrate the construction of middle level ontology, using the substitutability test of 
Knott and Dale (1994). 
As we have seen above, coherence relations in Korean are realized by suffixes and 
connectives. For the test we collected such cue phrases from different sources. As for 
connectives, we selected lexical items signaling causal relations from Im et al. (2001), where the 
whole list of Korean connectives is presented. The size of selected connectives is 28 tokens 
which correspond to 20 types. In the case of suffixes, there are no researches which present the 
whole list. Therefore we collected the items from the tagged corpus ‘Sejong corpus’. In details 
we extracted all the items which are tagged with ‘connecting’-suffixes, and selected the suffixes 
showing the causal relation from the items. By this procedure we have gotten 31 connectives 
(19 types). The table 1 shows the whole list we got. 
  
Table 1: The list of Korean cue phrases 
                                                           
3 They are also called as ‘discourse/ coherence/ lexical markers’, ‘discourse operators’, ‘discourse/ 
pragmatic/ sentence connectives’, ‘cue phrases’, ‘clue words’, etc.

-koseya, -nunpa, -may, -layse, -uncuk,  
-nolani/-nolamyen/-nolanika, -koto,  
-nunteyto, -ciman/-cimanun  
 
Now we turn to the construction of ontology through the substitutability test. The middle-level 
ontology to be constructed at this section will be connected to the concept ‘CAUSE-
CONSEQUENCE/ CONDITION-CONSEQUENCE’ at the upper-level ontology (Fig. 1). This 
methodology can be applied to other concepts of Fig. 1 in a similar way.  
As a starting point, we follow Chang (1995) where the suffix ‘-myen’ is considered as the most 
general suffix among the suffixes representing a causal relation. In addition to ‘-myen’, there are 
suffixes ‘-nula’/’-killay’ which represent a causal relation, but behave themselves differently.  
As we see below, the latter group expresses a causal relation on the basis of a temporal 
connection between events.4  
 
(6) (a) syawe-lul    ha-myen    kipun-i      sangkway-ha-ta. 
         shower-ACC  do-SUFF   feeling-NOM  refresh-do-DEC 
         ‘If you take a shower, then you feel refreshed.’ 
(b) # syawe-lul   ha-nula    kipun-i      sangkway-ha-ta. 
    shower-ACC  do-SUFF   feeling-NOM  refresh-do-DEC 
    ‘I feel refreshed to take a shower.’ 
(c) syawe-lul      ha-nula    cenhwa-lul   mos-pat-ass-ta 
shower-ACC   do-SUFF   phone-ACC  not-take-PAST-DEC 
‘I couldn’t answer the phone, because I took a shower.’ 
 
Let us examine the suffix ‘-myen’ in details. If we apply the test of Knott (1996) to Korean, it 
is revealed that there are subordinate connectives ‘-kulayse’ and ‘-lyeko’ under the connective ‘-
myen’. The tests below show such a sub-classification. 
 
(7) (a) 1-e    2-lul   teha-myen   3-i-ta. 
         1-ACC  2-OBJ  plus-SUFF  3-COP-DEC 
        ‘1 plus 2 is 3.’  
(b) 1-e     2-lul   teha-yss-ta.      kulayse  3-i-ta. 
1-ACC  2-OBJ  plus-PAST-DEC.  so      3-NOM-DEC 
        ‘I plus 1 to 2. so it is 3 now.’ 
(8) (a) kongpu-lul   yelsimhi  ha-myen   cohun  sengcek-ul   et-unu-ta. 
         study-OBJ   hard    do-SUFF  good   grade-OBJ   get-PRES-DEC 
        ‘If you study hard, you will get good grade.’  
(b) cohun  sengcek-ul   et-ulyeko   kongpu-lul   yelsimhi   ha-yss-ta. 
good   grade-OBJ   get-SUFF   study-OBJ   hard     do-PAST-DEC 
‘To get the good grade, I studied hard.’ 
 
                                                           
4 According to Yim (1999), suffixes ‘-nula’ and ‘-killay’ show different syntactic distributions. But such 
differences are assumed to be recorded under the individual item.  
 
250

 
From this observation we can conclude that there are sub-concepts such as ‘cause’ with ‘-
kulayse’ and ‘purpose’ with ‘-lyeko’ under the concept ‘condition’ with ‘-myen’. Furthermore, 
the following tests show that the two sub-concepts are inter-exclusive each other.  
 
(9) (a) √ pay-ka        kop-ass-ta.        kulayse  pap-ul    mek-ess-ta. 
 stomach-NOM  hungry-PAST-DEC   so      meal-OBJ  eat-PAST-DEC 
 ‘I was hungry. So, I had a meal,’ 
   (b) # pap-ul    mek-uleko   pay-ka       kop-ass-ta. 
           meal-OBJ  eat-SUFF   stomach-NOM  hungry-PAST-DEC 
        ‘I was hungry to had a meal..’ 
(10) (a) √ pap-ul     mek-uleko   sang-ul    chali-ess-ta. 
 meal-OBJ  eat-SUFF   table-OBJ  set-PAST-DEC 
 ‘I set the table to eat.’  
   (b) #/? sang-ul   chali-ess-ta.     kulayse  pap-ul     mek-ess-ta. 
     table-OBJ  set-PAST-DEC.  so      meal-OBJ   eat-PAST-DEC 
   ‘I set the table. That’ why I had a meal.’ 
 
Finally the concept ‘cause’ can be specified into a more concrete concept, as we see in (11). 
That concept is realized by the connectives such as ‘kyelkwuk’, ‘hanun swu epsi’, etc.  
 
(11) (a) pay-ka       kop-ass-ta.        kulayse  pap-ul     mek-ess-ta. 
stomach-NOM  hungry-PAST-DEC   so      meal-OBJ   eat-PAST-DEC 
‘I was hungry. So, I had a meal,’ 
(b) pay-ka       kop-ass-ta.        kyelkuk   pap-ul    mek-ess-ta. 
stomach-NOM  hungry-PAST-DEC.   finally   meal-OBJ  eat-PAST-DEC 
‘I was hungry. Finally, I had a meal,’ 
 
From the tests above, we can get the following middle-level ontology which is connected with 
the concept ‘cause-consequence’/’condition-consequence’ of the upper-level ontology (Fig. 1).

4. Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented the method of constructing an ontology of coherence relations. We 
could construct an ontology of more abstract concepts by combining an upper-level ontology 
and a middle-level ontology. In case of the former we used the theoretical considerations 
following Sanders et al. (1992, 1993), and in case of the latter we used lexical items through the 
substitutability test of Knott and Dale (1994).  
The resulted Korean Ontology can be used for the typological analysis of coherence relations, 
because the comparison of languages tends to be based on the ontology. In future we will extend 
the ontology into the whole coherence relations and try to do a typological analysis between 
different languages.
