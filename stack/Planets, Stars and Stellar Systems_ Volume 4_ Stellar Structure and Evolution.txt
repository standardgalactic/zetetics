Series Preface
It is my great pleasure to introduce “Planets, Stars, and Stellar Systems” (PSSS). As a “Springer
Reference”, PSSS is intended for graduate students to professionals in astronomy, astrophysics
and planetary science, but it will also be useful to scientists in other fields whose research inter-
ests overlap with astronomy. Our aim is to capture the spirit of 21st century astronomy – an
empirical physical science whose almost explosive progress is enabled by new instrumentation,
observational discoveries, guided by theory and simulation.
Each volume, edited by internationally recognized expert(s), introduces the reader to a
well-defined area within astronomy and can be used as a text or recommended reading for
an advanced undergraduate or postgraduate course. Volume 1, edited by Ian McLean, is an
essential primer on the tools of an astronomer, i.e., the telescopes, instrumentation and detec-
tors used to query the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Volume 2, edited by Howard Bond, is a
compendium of the techniques and analysis methods that enable the interpretation of data col-
lected with these tools. Volume 3, co-edited by Linda French and Paul Kalas, provides a crash
course in the rapidly converging fields of stellar, solar system and extrasolar planetary science.
Volume 4, edited by Martin Barstow, is one of the most complete references on stellar structure
and evolution available today. Volume 5, edited by Gerard Gilmore, bridges the gap between
our understanding of stellar systems and populations seen in great detail within the Galaxy
and those seen in distant galaxies. Volume 6, edited by Bill Keel, nicely captures our current
understanding of the origin and evolution of local galaxies to the large scale structure of the
universe.
The chapters have been written by practicing professionals within the appropriate sub-
disciplines. Available in both traditional paper and electronic form, they include extensive
bibliographicand hyperlink references tothe current literature that will helpreaders toacquire a
solid historical and technical foundation in that area. Each can also serve as a valuable reference
for a course or refresher for practicing professional astronomers. Those familiar with the “Stars
and Stellar Systems” series from several decades ago will recognize some of the inspiration for
the approach we have taken.
Very many people have contributed to this project. I would like to thank Harry Blom and
Sonja Guerts (Sonja Japenga at the time) of Springer, who originally encouraged me to pur-
sue this project several years ago. Special thanks to our outstanding Springer editors Ramon
Khanna (Astronomy) and Lydia Mueller (Major Reference Works) and their hard-working edi-
torial team Jennifer Carlson, Elizabeth Ferrell, Jutta Jaeger-Hamers, Julia Koerting, and Tamara
Schineller. Their continuous enthusiasm, friendly prodding and unwavering support made this
series possible. Needless to say (but I’m saying it anyway), it was not an easy task shepherding
a project this big through to completion!
Most of all, it has been a privilege to work with each of the volume Editors listed above and
over 100 contributing authors on this project. I’ve learned a lot of astronomy from them, and I
hope you will, too!

Preface to Volume 4
Advances in the technology available to modern astronomers have led to a knowledge explo-
sion. The study of the Sun and other Stars has been transformed by astronomers’ access to both
modern, electronically instrumented, telescopes and high-performance computers for theoret-
ical modeling and calculations. Many of the topics we write about now were unknown before
these tools were available. For example, white dwarfs had barely been studied, neutron stars
were just a theoretical idea before the discovery of radio pulsars, and seismology was a topic
confined to the study of the Earth’s interior. Gamma ray bursts were certainly going off, but the
Vela satellites that led to their discovery were a decade away and the release of that “top-secret”
information later yet.
The fundamental aim of this volume is to give a comprehensive overview of the current state
of our knowledge of stars and to provide a reference of broad use to researchers who may not
be experts in a particular subfield. It is hoped that the individual chapters will provide valuable
stepping off points for further reading and pursuit of each topic. There is much more to include
than before and I am grateful to all the authors for their concise and effective writing.
This volume has been divided into three main sections. Part I broadly covers the theory of
stellar structure, while Part II deals with the evolution of stars from their formation through to
their various endpoints: white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. These chapters also deal
with the mechanisms through which these various forms of stellar death are reached. Finally,
Part III does not discuss stars themselves but includes two chapters on their environment and
their influence on it, looking at the local interstellar medium and stellar winds. The subjects
impact on galactic dynamics and galactic evolution, which are dealt with elsewherein the series.
The chapters in this volume were mostly commissioned in 2009, with all the material being
received between 2010 and 2012. Like almost all of astronomy, in the modern era, this is a fast-
moving field. Therefore, the chapters inevitably represent a state of knowledge that will move
on over the next few years.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge the friendly cooperation and patience of the authors
of the chapters in this volume. I have also valued the support of the staff at Springer, both past
and current, in the editorial process and for helping bring this project to fruition. I would also
like to thank Terry Oswalt, for inviting me to become an editor on this exciting enterprise. It
has been a pleasure to work with everyone.

Dr. Oswalt has been a member of the Florida Tech faculty since 1982 and was the first profes-
sional astronomer in the Department of Physics and Space Sciences. He serves on a number of
professional society and advisory committees each year. From 1998 to 2000, Dr. Oswalt served
as Program Director for Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics at the National Science Founda-
tion. After returning to Florida Tech in 2000, he served as Associate Dean for Research for the
College of Science (2000–2005) and interim Vice Provost for Research (2005–2006). He is now
Head of the Department of Physics & Space Sciences. Dr. Oswalt has written over 200 scientific
articles and has edited three astronomy books, in addition to serving as Editor-in-Chief for the
six-volume Planets, Stars, and Stellar Systems series.
Dr. Oswalt is the founding chairman of the Southeast Association for Research in Astron-
omy (SARA), a consortium of ten southeastern universities that operates automated 1-meter
class telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory in Chile (see the website www.saraobservatory.org for details). These facilities,
which are remotely accessible on the Internet, are used for a variety of research projects by
faculty and students. They also support the SARA Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) program, which brings students from all over the U.S. each summer to participate one-
on-one with SARA faculty mentors in astronomical research projects. In addition, Dr. Oswalt
secured funding for the 0.8-meter Ortega telescope on the Florida Tech campus. It is the largest
research telescope in the State of Florida.
Dr. Oswalt’s primary research focuses on spectroscopic and photometric investigations of
verywide binaries that contain known orsuspected white dwarfstars. These pairs ofstars, whose
separations are so large that orbital motion is undetectable, provide a unique opportunity to
explore the low luminosity ends of both the white dwarf cooling track and the main sequence
to test competing models of white dwarf spectral evolution to determine the space motions,
masses, and luminosities for the largest single sample of white dwarfs known; and to set a lower
limit to the age and dark matter content of the Galactic disk.

Dr. Martin A. Barstow received his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of
York (UK) in 1979. From there, he became a member of the X-ray Astronomy group in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester, receiving his Ph.D. in
1983. His Ph.D. work involved the development of a sounding rocket-borne extreme ultraviolet
imaging telescope (jointly with MIT), which evolved into the United Kingdom’s EUV wide-field
camera on board the ROSAT mission. Becoming ROSAT WFC detector scientist in 1984, he
received a NASA Group Achievement award on its launch in 1990 and obtained a prestigious
SERC (later PPARC) Advanced Fellowship for exploitation of the data in 1990.
Dr. Barstow was appointed to lectureship in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in
1994, was promoted to reader in 1998 and became professor of astrophysics and space science
in 2003. He was head of the Physics and Astronomy Department from 2005 to 2009 and is cur-
rently pro-vice chancellor and founding head of the College of Science and Engineering. His
principal research interests are the study of hot white dwarf stars and the surrounding inter-
stellar medium. In addition to ROSAT, he has been involved in many space missions during his
career, including NASA’s Voyager probes, during their interplanetary cruises, the ESA EXOSAT
mission, IUE, HST, and FUSE. Recently he was a member of the Space Telescope Users’ Com-
mittee helping to develop the plans for the final servicing mission, which took place in May
2009. He is continues to fly sounding rockets, be involved in research with Hubble, as well as
leading the Leicester contribution to the ESA Gaia mission.
During the past few years, Dr. Barstow has played an increasingly important role in scientific
funding and advisory structures and has become a member of Science and Technology Facilities
Council in 2009. He has also recently been appointed to membership of the ESA Astronomy
Working Group and Space Programme Advisory Committee of the United Kingdom Space
Agency.

Stellar Structure 1

Abstract:
In this chapter the equations of stellar structure are introduced. Up-to-date descrip-
tions of the most relevant microphysics needed to build reliable stellar configurations are also
provided. These include the equation of state, nuclear reactions, opacities, and other less fre-
quently discussed physical processes, such as diffusion and radiative levitation. The necessary
numerical techniques currently employed to build evolutionary stellar models as well as the
otherwise necessary boundary conditions needed to integrate the equations of stellar structure
are also addressed. Finally, an overview of the current state-of-the-art modeling is given.
Keywords: Stars: evolution, Stars: interiors, Stars: structure

Introduction
Stars are the fundamental blocks upon which galaxies, and by extension the universe, are built.
As such, their study has received continuous interest during several decades. In fact, reliable
and up-to-date stellar evolutionary models are routinely required in several fields of modern
astrophysics. Hence, understanding the structure of stars is a must, and most branches of astro-
physics rely on detailed stellar models. In particular, understanding the structure and evolution
of our galaxy, a prototypical spiral galaxy, requires obtaining significant information from sta-
tistical studies of the several galactic populations (disk, halo, and bulge). Future space missions,
of which Gaia is the archetypical example (Perryman et al. 2001), will obtain an accurate cen-
sus of the stars in our galaxy, will determine three-dimensional velocities for most of them, and
will also quantitatively map its structure. This wealth of information can be accurately and effi-
ciently analyzed only if realistic stellar evolutionary models, based on an accurate description
of the properties of stars, are employed. Thus, understanding in detail the structure of stars is of
crucial importance. Additionally, Galactic satellite galaxies are proving to be the most natural
and successful places where to test and quantify the nature and distribution of dark matter, a
key issue in modern cosmology. A precise understanding of these galaxies is a challenge for
which again accurate stellar models are needed. Also, the origin of the different chemical ele-
ments cannot be assessed without fully understanding the structure and evolution of stars. As
a matter of fact, it turns out that all the elements – but hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium,
and boron – have been synthetized in the deep interiors of stars. Thus, our understanding of
the chemical evolution of the universe relies on our ability to describe the details of the internal
structure of stars. Moreover, due to the extreme pressures and temperatures that are reached in
some of their evolutionary stages, stars can also be used as astroparticle physics laboratories –
see the review of Raffelt (1999) – and provide environments that cannot be attained in terrestrial
laboratories. Also, stars can be used to test alternative theories of gravitation – see the recent
review of García-Berro et al. (2007) – a very hot topic. Finally, a detailed description of stellar
structure is also of primordial importance to understand one the most energetic events in our
universe: supernovae. Although important, these are only a few examples for which a detailed
knowledge of stellar structure is required and there are several other important applications
that are omitted here for the sake of conciseness.
As mentioned, our understanding of stellar structure has been built over several decades.
To the best of our knowledge the pioneering studies were done, among others, by Lane (1869),
Schwarzschild (1906), and Eddington (1916) between the end of the nineteenth century and
the very beginning of the twentieth century. Of course, these initial studies were very crude

and several approximations done in these studies have turned out to be inaccurate. Neverthe-
less, they helped in setting the stage and they contributed to the foundation of a new branch of
astronomy. Since then, the field has experimented notable advances and has reached a degree
of maturity and a predictive power that do not have other fields of astronomy. Big steps forward
were given by renowned astronomers, of which Chandrasekhar, Fowler, Bethe, Schatzman, Sug-
imoto, Iben, and several others are conspicuous examples. Their work settled the basements of
the modern theory of stellar structure. More recently, the advent of computers and of advanced
numerical techniques helped to develop a consistent, coherent, and very detailed theory cor-
pus that nowadays has made possible to compare theoretical models with the extremely large
amount of very precise data that is routinely acquired by modern large telescopes.
The study of stellar structure involves several fields of contemporary physics. In order to
understand the structure of stars several physical inputs are required. Among them nuclear
reactions, which are of fundamental importance to understand the energetics of stars, need
to be mentioned first. In turn, an accurate knowledge of nuclear reactions involves not only
a proper theoretical description of the structure of nuclei, but also large experimental efforts
to measure the cross sections of the most important nuclear reactions. Needless to say that
although there exist accurate determinations for several nuclear reactions there are still sev-
eral others for which reliable determinations are sorely needed. Examples of the former are the
nuclear reaction rates relevant for hydrogen burning, and the most paradigmatic example of
the latter is, perhaps, the C(α, γ)O nuclear cross section. A detailed knowledge of the equa-
tion of state of astrophysical plasmas is also required to accurately model stellar structures. This
includes not only the description of the thermodynamical properties of the ideal plasma for a
wide range of densities and temperatures – see >Fig. 1-1 – but also, if realistic models are to
be computed, several nonideal effects must also be taken into account. Also partial ionization
must be carefully taken into account. Accurate modeling of energy losses via neutrino emission
requires also a good description of weak interactions. Matter at very large densities, like those
found in the interiors of neutron stars, require modeling strong interactions. On the other hand,
opacities and conductivities of matter are also required. Actually, the list of physical inputs is so
large that no attempt is made to be exhaustive at this point, and a detailed discussion of all the
most important physical inputs is deferred to subsequent sections.
Before going into the details of stellar structure modeling it is rather convenient to have an
approximate and simplistic, but rather effective, idea of how typical stars, of which our own
Sun is an example, work. In fact, a main sequence star can be defined as a self-contained, self-
controlled, auto-gravitating thermonuclear reactor – something that nuclear engineers have not
been able to reproduce on Earth yet. Assume that all stars have spherical symmetry. This is not
an unrealisticassumption, because gravityonlydepends on distance, but it has been onlyproved
for the case of the closest star: our Sun. The most important property (besides isotropy) of
gravity is that it is always attractive, contrary to what happens with electromagnetic interactions.
In fact, and as it will be shown in subsequent chapters, the life of a star is a battle against gravity.
Actually, normal stars succeed in winning successive battles but they lose the war, exploding
as supernovae, the most massive ones, or ejecting their external layers and forming compact
objects (either white dwarfs or neutron stars), the less massive ones. Since stars seem to be
in equilibrium, a force must balance gravity. This force, obviously, is pressure or, to be more
precise, the pressure gradient. That is, Archimede’s principle comes at work. Given the densities
and temperatures of main sequence stars – see >Fig. 1-1 – the pressure can be well described
by that of a totally ionized ideal gas. This is the same to say that the pressure is proportional
to the density (ϱ) and the temperature (T). Now, to balance the gravitational force there are

Structure of several stellar conﬁgurations in the density-temperature plane. Note that the loga-
rithms of both quantities are plotted. The most external layers of these stellar conﬁgurations are
not displayed. The dotted line illustrates the structure of a main sequence star of 1 M⊙. For com-
parative purposes the structure of a main sequence star of 30 M⊙is also displayed. Both structures
correspond to the moment at which hydrogen is ignited at the center. That is, at the zero age main
sequence. Note that the 30 M⊙star is considerably hotter than our Sun. Also shown is the structure
of a red giant star of 1 M⊙. As can be seen these types of stars have much wider density and tem-
perature ranges. Actually, the central density of this stellar conﬁguration is rather high. The solid
line shows the stratiﬁcation of densities and temperatures for an otherwise typical white dwarf of
0.6 M⊙. It has been chosen to show the structure at an intermediate evolutionary phase, when the
central temperature is log T ≃7.2. It is important to realize that the central density in this case is
much larger than in the previous examples
two possibilities: either to increase the density or to increase the temperature. As increasing
the density increases as well the gravitational force per unit volume, it is rather evident that the
only possibility that is left to play with is the temperature. This has the consequence that since
gravity is stronger at the central regions of the star, the core of a typical main sequence star must
be hotter. The second consequence is that more massive stars must be hotter as well, because
they need to balance an overall stronger gravitational pull. These two facts can be clearly seen
in >Fig. 1-1. This issue will be addressed again when the virial theorem, in >Sect. 5, and the
equation of state, in >Sect. 6.1, will be discussed.
Now going one step forward, there is no question that stars shine, that is, stars lose energy.
Thus, as they radiate away energy, stars should cool, the pressure should decrease, and, con-
sequently, the radius should decrease as well. But it turns out that this is not the case. Indeed,
it can be easily shown that the gravitational potential cannot supply the required amount of

energy during long periods of time. Actually, the release of gravitational energy is governed by
the Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale:
τKH ∼GM
RL
(1.1)
where G is the gravitational constant, G = .× −dyn cmg−, and M, R, and L are,
respectively, the total mass, radius, and luminosity of the corresponding star. Adopting the solar
values M = M⊙≃.×g, R = R⊙≃.×cm, and L = L⊙≃.×erg s−,
τKH ∼.× years is obtained, much shorter than the age of the Solar System, which is
∼.× years. Thus, gravitational energy cannot be the source of the luminosity of stars.
Therefore, another source of energy must be at work. It took several decades to realize that
this source of energy were nuclear reactions occurring in the deep interior of stars. In fact, an
indication of this is obtained computing the nuclear timescale:
τnuc ∼Mc
L
(1.2)
where c stands for the speed of light, and the rest of the symbols have been already defined.
Adopting again typical values, it turns out that τnuc > years, which comfortably fits within
the age of the Sun. The sketch previously outlined allows to get a preliminary insight of typical
stars that will serve as a guide for more quantitative studies. However, it should be emphasized
that this sketch is not valid for compact objects, either white dwarfs or neutron stars. For these
stars the key control parameter is not temperature, but density, and nuclear reactions become
(in most cases and only as far as it is concerned about isolated stars) irrelevant. This issue will
be revisited when studying the equation of state.
With all these considerations in mind the study of the subject of this chapter in a consistent
manner can be started. The reader should take into account that the purpose of this chapter is
not providing a summaryof the several stellarevolutionary phases. This will be found elsewhere
in this book. Instead, the chapter will focus on detailing all the equations and physical inputs
necessary to compute realistic and up-to-date stellar configurations. Also, the reader should be
aware that the selection of papers for explicit citation is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, and is
the product of the own special research trajectory and interests of the authors.
The chapter is organized as follows. The equations of stellar hydrostatic equilibrium and
energy conservation are first introduced. This will be done in > Sects. 2 and > 3, respec-
tively. The main energy transport mechanisms in stars will be described in > Sect. 4. With
these tools at hand, an overview of the gross properties of a star, the virial theorem, will be
given in >Sect. 5. All the necessary physical inputs (equation of state, nuclear reactions, opac-
ities, and neutrino emission rates) will be provided in >Sect. 6. A brief introduction to other
physical processes relevant for stellar evolutionary calculations, like diffusion and radiative lev-
itation, will be given in >Sect. 7. A discussion of how the boundary conditions are usually dealt
with will be provided in >Sect. 8, and numerical techniques to compute stellar evolution will
be detailed in >Sect. 9. >Section 10 provides insight on modern numerical techniques and
available stellar evolutionary codes. Finally, >Sect. 11 will close the chapter providing a brief
summary.

Hydrostatic Equilibrium
In the absence of rotation and magnetic fields, the only forces acting on a given mass element of
an isolated star made of matter plus radiation result from pressure and gravity. For most stars,
a spherically symmetric configuration can thus be assumed, where functions are constant on
concentric spheres at a distance r from the stellar center. The imbalance between gravitational
and differential pressure forces yields the equation of motion at r:
ϱ¨r = −dP
dr −Gmϱ
r
,
(1.3)
where ¨r is the local acceleration dr/dt, ϱ and P are the local matter density and pressure,
and m is the mass in the sphere interior to r. Generally speaking, and for most phases of stel-
lar evolution, stars evolve so slowly that the temporal evolution of the stellar structure can be
described by a sequence of models in hydrostatic equilibrium. This being the case, the struc-
ture can be assumed to be static. Hence, all time derivatives can be neglected. In this case, the
internal pressure gradient balances gravity everywhere in the star, and the equation of motion,
(> 1.3), reduces to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:
dP
dr = −Gmϱ
r
(1.4)
and mass conservation reads:
dm
dr = πrϱ.
(1.5)
These two expressions allow to derive an estimate of the central pressure, Pc, of our Sun using
dimensional analysis:

R ∼GM⟨ϱ⟩

(1.6)
where ⟨ϱ⟩is the mean density and it has been assumed that the pressure at the surface is much
smaller than at the center, a very good approximation. Adopting typical values, Pc ∼.×
dyn cm−is obtained.
Clearly, the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium means that the pressure decreases
outward. The departures from hydrostatic equilibrium can be characterized using the dynam-
ical timescale τdyn, which can be computed neglecting the internal pressure gradient in a
gravitationally bound configuration. From (> 1.3) it follows that

thus, we obtain

which is essentially the free-fall timescale. For the Sun τdyn is about 30 min, for a red giant with
⟨ϱ⟩= −g cm−about 40 days, and for a white dwarf with ⟨ϱ⟩= g cm−, it is on the order
of a few seconds. This implies that hydrostatic equilibrium is always very quickly attained.

Energy Conservation
Let l be the net energy per second outflowing from a sphere of radius r, that is, the luminosity,
and єnuc the nuclear energy released per unit mass per second. In a stationary situation in which
nuclear reactions are the only energy source of the star, the exceeding energy per second, dl,
leaving a spherical mass shell of radius r, mass dm, and thickness dr is
dl = πrϱ єnuc dr.
(1.9)
However, heating (or cooling) of the mass element,and the work of expansion (or compression)
of the mass shell also contribute to the energy balance. This means that dl can be nonzero even
in the absence of nuclear reactions. Using the first law of thermodynamics, the energy equation
can then be written
dl
dm = єnuc + єg,
(1.10)
where єg is the gravothermal term per unit mass per second

This contribution is usually small for most stages of evolution, as compared to the release of
nuclear energy – see Kippenhahn et al. (1965) – but it is relevant in the case of white dwarf stars
where nuclear reactions are effectively extinguished (Isern et al. 1997). The energy equation,
(> 1.10), then becomes

Integrating (> 1.11) over mass gives the overall gravothermal contributions to the total energy
budget. It is apparent that the integration of the first term in єg yields the time variation of
the total internal energy of the star. As it will be shown later, integration over m of the second
term yields the time derivative of the total gravitational energy (Ω) of the star (Kippenhahn and
Weigert 1990).

Energy Transport
4.1 Radiative Transport
One of the mechanisms by which energy is transferred in stellar interiors is radiation, that is,
by photons. Generally speaking, radiation is the usual process by which energy is carried away
in stars. In stellar interiors, the photon mean free path ℓph is very short compared to the typical
length scale over which the structure changes. The mean free path of a photon can be easily
estimated:
ℓph =

κrad ϱ,
(1.19)
where κrad is the mean radiative opacity coefficient due to interactions of photons with particles,
that is, the radiative cross section per unit mass averaged over frequency. Typical values of κrad
for stellar interiors are κrad ≈1 cmg−. Taking into account the average density of matter in the
Sun, ℓph ≈1 cm. This is much smaller than the stellar radius, thus implying that matter in stellar
interiors is very close to local thermodynamic equilibrium, and that the power spectrum of
radiation corresponds to that of a blackbody. The mean free path of photons is also so small that
the energy transport by radiation can be treated essentially as a diffusive process, introducing
an important simplification in the treatment. In the diffusion approximation, the radiative flux
is given by
Frad = −
π
κrad ϱ∇B = −acT
κrad ϱ ∇T,
(1.20)
here B = (ac/π)Tis the frequency-integrated Planck function, c the speed of light, and a
the radiation density constant (.× −erg cm−K−). In the spherical symmetric case,
Frad has only a radial component, ∣Frad∣= Frad. Thus, l = πrFrad, and the diffusion equation
becomes
dT
dr = −
ac
κrad ϱ

(1.21)
The total energy flux depends on an integral over all radiation frequencies. In the diffusion
approximation, the generalization to frequency-dependence leads to the concept of the Rosse-
land mean opacity, obtained as a harmonic mean of the frequency-dependent opacity. This can

(> 1.21) is recovered. It is worth noting as well that the radiative flux can be cast in the form

(1.26)
where aTis the radiation energy density and D is a diffusion coefficient given by
D =

κradϱ = 

(1.27)
In stellar atmospheres, the mean free path of photons becomes much larger, and the dif-
fusion approximation is not valid. There, a more complete and detailed treatment of the full
radiative transfer problem is required (Mihalas and Mihalas 1984).
4.2 Conductive Transport
Energy can be transferred not only by photons but also by particles via collisions during the ran-
dom thermal motions of the particles. This becomes particularly relevant at the high densities
characteristic of evolved stars, where electron degeneracy increases both the electron veloc-
ity and the mean free path substantially, thus making the diffusion coefficient large. Hence, in
the case of stellar matter where electrons are degenerate, electron conduction results in a very
efficient energy transfer mechanism, superseding in some cases radiative transfer.
The energy flux due to electron thermal conduction can be written in terms of a coefficient
of thermal diffusion, De, and the temperature gradient as
Fcd = −De dT
dr .
(1.28)
It is convenient to define a “conductive opacity” as
κcd = acT
De ϱ ,
(1.29)

Stellar Structure 1

so that the total energy flux carried by both radiation and thermal conduction can be written as
Ftot = Frad + Fcd = −acT
κtot ϱ
dT
dr ,
(1.30)
where the total opacity is expressed as

κtot


κcd
.
(1.31)
Note that when κcd ≫κrad, then κtot ≃κrad, and when electron conduction is very efficient,
κcd ≪κrad, κtot ≃κcd is verified.
It is useful to write the diffusion equation, (> 1.21), for the radiative plus conductive trans-
port in terms of the radiative temperature gradient for a star in hydrostatic equilibrium, ∇rad,
∇rad = (d ln T
d ln P )
rad
,
(1.32)
in the form
∇rad =

πacG
κtot l P
m T.
(1.33)
It should be noted that ∇rad, which is a spatial derivative that relates the variables P and T
in two close mass shells, describes the temperature variation with depth for a star in hydrostatic
equilibrium where energy is transferred by radiation (and conduction).
4.3 Convective Transport
In a stellar interior, energy is transferred not only by radiation and/or conduction, but also by
convection, which is also responsible for chemical element transport. Under certain circum-
stances, small, local perturbations of elements around their equilibrium positions may grow,
thus leading to macroscopic motions. These large-scale motions, or convection, lead to energy
transport from the hottest to the coolest regions due to the rising and falling of mass elements
under the combined action of buoyancy and gravity. The condition for stability of a mass ele-
ment that is displaced around its equilibrium position in a certain region of a star (due to, for
instance, temperature fluctuations) is
(dϱ
dr )
int
> (dϱ
dr )
ext
,
(1.34)
where the subscript “int” denotes the change ofinternal densityofthe mass element while it rises
a distance dr, and the subscript “ext” indicates the spatial gradient in the star. This condition
assumes that the element remains always in pressure equilibrium with the surroundings. That
is, the element moves with a speed lower than the local sound speed. The stability condition
given by (> 1.34) simply states that after moving a distance dr, the element will be denser than
the fluid in its new environment, so the gravitational force will make the element sink back to
its original position.

12 1
Stellar Structure
In order to translate this stability condition into a more tractable form, the equation of state
ϱ = ϱ(P, T, μ) can be used, and can be written as
dϱ
ϱ = P
ϱ ( ∂ϱ
∂P ) dP
P + T
ϱ ( ∂ϱ
∂T ) dT
T + μ
ϱ ( ∂ϱ
∂μ) dμ
μ
(1.35)
= α dP
P −δ dT
T + φ dμ
μ ,
where α and δ are given by ( > 1.16), μ is the mean molecular weight, and φ is the chemical
potential. Hence, the stability criterion becomes
( α

dP
dr −δ
T
dT
dr + φ
μ
dμ
dr )
int
> ( α
P
dP
dr −δ
T
dT
dr + φ
μ
dμ
dr )
ext
.
(1.36)
Since the element is in equilibrium with its surroundings (the pressure is the same), and the
values of α and δ for the fluid element are almost equal to the external ones, the first term on
either side of the inequality cancel each other. Also, (du/dr)int = since the element does not
change its chemical composition while moving, which is the same to say that there is no matter
exchange with the surroundings. Then, (> 1.36) reduces to
( δ
T
dT
dr )
int
< ( δ
T
dT
dr −φ
μ
dμ
dr )
ext
.
(1.37)
After multiplying both sides of this inequality by the pressure scale height
λP = −dr
dlnP ,
(1.38)
which is a measure of the distance over which the pressure is changing by a factor e, the stability
condition becomes
(d ln T
d ln P )
ext
< (d ln T
d ln P )
int
+ φ
δ (d ln μ
d ln P )
ext
.
(1.39)
This condition can be used to test the stability of a layer where all energy is transported by
radiation and/or conduction. If the star is stable the term on the left-hand side of (>1.39) is the
radiative temperature gradient defined by (> 1.32). It will be assumed that the element moves
adiabatically. This is same as assuming that the rising fluid element has no time to exchange its
energy content with the surrounding environment. Thus, the Ledoux criterion for dynamical
stability is obtained
∇rad < ∇ad + φ
δ ( d ln μ
d ln P ),
(1.40)
where ∇ad is the adiabatic temperature gradient and corresponds to the temperature gradient
when the moving element does not exchange heat with the surrounding medium. For a general
equation of state, the adiabatic gradient reads
∇ad =
Pδ
CPϱT .
(1.41)

Stellar Structure 1
13
It is worth mentioning that for the particular case of a chemically homogeneous region of
a star, d ln μ/d ln P = . Therefore, the condition for stability in this case simply reads
∇rad < ∇ad,
(1.42)
which is the Schwarzschild criterion for dynamical stability. In those stellar regions where
nuclear reactions produce heavier elements below the lighter ones, the chemical gradient term
in (> 1.39) favors convective stability since d ln μ/d ln P > . Indeed, in regions of varying μ,
a fluid element moving upward is made of matter with a higher molecular weight than that of
its surrounding medium, forcing the element to sink down as a result of gravity.
The derivation of the condition for stability can be seen from a slightly different point of
view. Assume that a fluid element in a star is displaced vertically and adiabatically from its
equilibrium position with the surroundings at r. It will experience a buoyancy force per unit
volume equal to −g (ϱint −ϱext), where g is the absolute value of the gravitational acceleration
and ϱint and ϱext are, respectively, the interior and exterior densities of the fluid element. In the
absence of viscous effects, the equation of motion of the element is
ϱint
dr
dt= −g (ϱint −ϱext).
(1.43)
For a small displacement (r −r), we obtain
ϱint(r) = ϱint(r) + (dϱint
dr )
r
(r −r),
(1.44)
and the same for ϱext. Since at r, ϱint(r) = ϱext(r), the equation of motion becomes
ϱint
dr
dt+ g (dϱint
dr
−dϱext
dr ) (r −r) = ,
(1.45)
the solution of which is of the form (r −r) = A exp(i N t), with N the oscillation frequency
of the element around its equilibrium position, also called the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, which
is given by
N = g
ϱ (dϱint
dr
−dϱext
dr ).
(1.46)
Note that if (dϱint/dr) > (dϱext/dr), then N > , N is real, and the movement is oscilla-
tory. These oscillations are also known as gravity waves (not to be confused with gravitational
waves in General Relativity) since gravity is the restoring force. Thus, the layer will be stable
against convection. On the other hand, if (dϱint/dr) < (dϱext/dr), then N < , N is imagi-
nary, and then the element will move exponentially from the equilibrium position. Clearly, the
layer will be unstable against convection. Now compare these results with the stability condition
given by (> 1.34).
The actual temperature gradient in a convective region, the convective gradient ∇conv, will
be different from the radiative temperature gradient. It is clear that if a fraction of the total flux
is carried by convection, then ∇conv < ∇rad, where ∇rad represents the temperature gradient
that would be needed to transport the entire flux by radiation and conduction. The total flux
consists of the radiative plus convective fluxes:
Ftot =
l
πr= Fconv + Frad = acGmT
κtot P r∇rad.
(1.47)

14 1
Stellar Structure
If ∇conv is the actual temperature gradient, it is clear then that the flux carried by radiation is
only
Frad = acGmT
κtot P r∇conv.
(1.48)
In a convective zone, the following relations are valid (the second inequality is the criterion
for convection)
∇rad > ∇conv > ∇int > ∇ad.
(1.49)
The calculation of ∇conv remains a serious issue. In fact, a model for convection must be
specified. Convection is essentially a nonlocal and complex phenomenon that involves the
solution of the hydrodynamic equations, and it remains a weak point in the theory of stellar
evolution. In most stellar applications, a simple local formulation (Böhm-Vitense 1958) called
the mixing-length theory (MLT) is used. This crude model assumes that the convective flux is
transported by single size, large fluid elements, which after traveling, on the average, a dis-
tance ℓMLT, the mixing length, break up releasing their energy excess into the surrounding
medium. The distance ℓMLT, which is also the characteristic size of the elements, is parame-
terized in terms of the pressure scale height, ℓMLT = αMLT HP, where αMLT is a free parameter
not predicted by the theory that must be calibrated using observations, and HP is the pressure
scale height. In particular, in the Böhm-Vitense formulation, the MLT involves three length
scales which, in most stellar applications, are reduced to ℓMLT. Usually, αMLT is found fitting the
solar radius (αMLT ≈.), and this value is usually used to model other stars and evolutionary
phases.
In the deep interior of stars, convection results from the large values of ∇rad caused by the
strong concentration of nuclear burning near the stellar center, for instance during the core
hydrogen burning phase via the CNO cycle in stars somewhat more massive than the Sun. The
high densities of these regions make the temperature stratification almost adiabatic, and thus
∇conv = ∇ad. This means that a very small excess of ∇conv over the adiabatic value is enough
to transport all the flux. Consequently, the uncertainties in the MLT theory become irrelevant
and a detailed treatment of convection is not required to specify ∇conv. For the Sun, typical
convective velocities are of the order of 400 cm s−, whereas for more massive stars they are
much larger. Hence, the turnover time, or the travel time of the elements over the distance
ℓMLT, ranges from about 1 to 100 days. This time is far much shorter than the main sequence
lifetime. In fact, during most evolutionary phases convective mixing is essentially an instanta-
neous process, thus leading to chemically homogeneous convective zones. However, this may
not be true during fast evolutionary stages, where the convective timescale becomes comparable
to the evolutionary timescale.
A complete solution of the MLT, with all its associated uncertainties, is required in the
low-density, outermost part of convective envelopes where the temperature gradient markedly
differs from the adiabatic value (Cox and Giuli 1968). In these layers, large values of ∇rad result
from the large opacity values in the ionization zones of hydrogen and helium close to the sur-
face, causing convection in the outer parts of relatively cool stars. Here, the density and the heat
content of matter are so low that a temperature gradient largely exceeding ∇ad is required to
transport energy. Depending on the efficiency of convection, ∇conv will be somewhere between
∇ad and ∇rad. Typical values for the average convective velocity in the solar envelope are about
1 km s−, close the local sound speed, and the turnover timescale is of the order of 5 min.
However, processes such as overshooting, that is, the extension of convective zones beyond
the formally convective boundaries given by ( > 1.40) – at the convective boundaries, fluid

Stellar Structure 1
15
elements have zero acceleration but nonzero velocity – cannot be satisfactorily treated using
a local theory. More mixing than is expected from the MLT treatment is supported by differ-
ent pieces of astrophysical evidence, which suggest that real stars have larger convective cores.
Overshooting – which is critical in determining the total amount of nuclear fuel available for
the star – is a nonlocal process, and its extent depends on the properties of the adjacent lay-
ers. In most studies of stellar structure and evolution, overshooting is simulated extending the
boundaries of the convective layer and mixing material beyond the formal convective bound-
ary. This is known as instantaneous overshooting. A better approach is to treat overshooting
as a diffusion process. This approach enables a self-consistent treatment of this process in the
presence of nuclear burning (Herwig 2000). Here, overshooting parameterization is based on
hydrodynamical simulations (Freytag et al. 1996), which show that turbulent velocities decay
exponentially outside the convective boundaries. This diffusive overshooting gives rise to mix-
ing in the overshoot regions whose efficiency is quantified in terms of the diffusion coefficient
Dos = Dexp(−z
Hv
),
(1.50)
where Dis the diffusion coefficient at the boundary of the convection zone, z is the radial
distance from the edge of the convection zone, and Hv is the velocity scale height of the over-
shoot convective elementsat the convective boundary. Hv is parameterized as a fraction f of the
pressure scale height, Hv = f HP. The parameter f is a measure of the extent of the overshooted
region. Clearly, the larger the f , the extra mixing beyond the convective boundary extends fur-
ther. Usually f ≈.is adopted. This choice of f accounts for the observed width of the main
sequence as well as for the intershell abundances of hydrogen-deficient post-AGB remnants.
Another complication is the occurrence of “semiconvection,” a slow mixing process that
is expected to occur in those regions with an inward increasing value of μ that are unstable
according to the Schwarzschild criterion but stable according to the Ledoux criterion, namely,
those layers where
∇ad + φ
δ ( d ln μ
d ln P ) > ∇rad > ∇ad.
(1.51)
Here, energy losses from the fluid elements (elements are hotter than the surroundings)
will cause them to oscillate around their equilibrium positions (vibrational instability) with
progressively growing amplitudes (Kippenhahn and Weigert 1990). Because of heat losses, the
elements return to the equilibrium position with a temperaturelower than that with which they
started, thus reaching deeper and hotter regions in their downward excursion. The growth of
the oscillation amplitudes is determined by the timescale of thermal adjustment of the fluid
elements. The overstability resulting from these growing oscillations and nonlinear effects is
believed to result in partial mixing of the corresponding layers. Realistic physical models of all
these nonlocal processes require two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of nonlin-
ear hydrodynamic instabilities and turbulent processes (Young et al. 2003). Finally, heat leakage
of the elements is also responsible for another type of instability, thermohaline convection. This
process leads to significant turbulent transport in stable regions with negative chemical gra-
dients – see Traxler et al. (2011) for recent three-dimensional simulations of this process in
stars.
In closing, it is worth mentioning that various attempts to improve the MLT have been
made. In particular, Canuto and Mazzitelli (1991) have considered the full spectrum of turbu-
lence in velocities and sizes of the convective eddies. An extended version of the Mixing Length
Theory of convection, for fluids with composition gradients, has been derived by Grossman and

16 1
Stellar Structure
Taam (1996) in the local approximation. These authors – see also Grossman et al. (1993) – have
developed the nonlinear Mixing Length Theory of double diffusive convection (GNA), where
both the effects of thermal and composition gradients compete to determine the stability of the
fluid. The GNA theory is based on the MLT picture and considers the fluid as an ensemble of
individual elements or blobs. This ensemble is described by a distribution function that evolves
in time according to a Boltzmann-type equation. In its local version, all third-order terms in
the second-moment of the Boltzmann equation are neglected. The GNA theory applies in con-
vective, semiconvective, and thermohaline regimes. According to this treatment, the diffusion
coefficient D characterizing mixing in the various regimes is given by
D = 
ℓσ
(1.52)
where ℓ= αHP is the mixing length and σ the turbulent velocity. The value of σ is determined
by simultaneously solving the equations for the turbulent velocity and flux conservation – see
Grossman and Taam (1996) for further details. In this theory of convection, the standard MLT
for a fluid of homogeneous composition is a limiting case.

The Virial Theorem
Stars are one of the best examples of a virialized system. In fact, it is rather simple to prove this.
Assume that they are in hydrostatic equilibrium – and, hence, that (>1.4) holds – and that they
are made up of an ideal gas. Accordingly, multiplying (> 1.4) by πrand integrating over the
entire star,
∫

is obtained, where R is the stellarradius. The left-hand side of this equation can be easily worked
out. Integrating by parts it is found that

where it has been assumed that the pressure at the surface of the star vanishes, and (> 1.5) has

which is the total gravitational energy. Thus,

P
ϱdm + Ω = .
(1.56)
Quite generally, for an ideal gas, P = (γ −)ϱu, where u is the internal energy and γ is the
adiabatic index. Thus, substituting this relationship in the last equation, a rather general result
is obtained:
(γ −)U + Ω = 
(1.57)
where the total thermal energy, U, has been introduced. On the other hand, the total energy of
a star (the binding energy) is B = U + Ω. Thus,
B = γ −
γ −Ω.
(1.58)

Stellar Structure 1
17
For a perfect gas γ = /. Consequently, U + Ω = and B = Ω/. This means that if a star
contracts – or, equivalently, it releases gravitational energy – half of the gravitational energy is
transformed in thermal energy, whereas the other half must be radiated away. Note as well that
since Ω < , the total energy of the star is also negative, an otherwise expected result that means
that the star is bound. Only in the case in which γ = /, that is, for a completely degenerate
relativisticgas, B = . This last result is of special significance as it is closelyrelated to the concept
of Chandrasekhar’s mass and to the explosion mechanism of thermonuclear supernovae.
The virial theorem can be used to obtain a relation between the stellar mass and the mean
temperature, T. Assume that stars are essentially composed of hydrogen. This assumption is
valid for most stars, for which the hydrogen mass fraction is typically ∼0.75. The total thermal
energy is thus
U ∼
NkBT ∝MT
(1.59)
where N is the total number of particles and kB = .erg K−is the Boltzmann constant.
Since Ω ∝−GM/R and U = −Ω, it follows that T ∝M/R, and thus the more massive a star,
the hotter, in qualitative agreement with arguments put forth in >Sect. 1. This argument can
be pushed forward to obtain a mass-luminosity relationship. The total luminosity of a star can
be expressed as L = πRF, where F is the flux. Using (> 1.20) we obtain:
F ∝
κϱTdT
dr ∼
κϱ
T
R .
(1.60)
Consequently, after some elementary algebra, and taking into account that the virial theorem
states that T ∝M/R, and also considering that ϱ ∝M/Rone arrives at the conclusion that
L ∝M/κ. This is same as saying that more massive stars are not only hotter, but also more
luminous.

Physical Inputs
As has been shown in the previous sections, the basic equations describing the structure and
evolution of stars are relatively simple. To this description the microphysics, that is, the proper-
ties of stellar matter, has to be added. These properties include the equation of state, opacity, and
energy generation rates, among others. The relevant processes occur in an interacting plasma
of ions, electrons, and atoms, and the detailed physics of these processes is still an active field
of research. Thus, some uncertainties still remain. In this section, all the main physical inputs
necessary to model the structure of a star are detailed. These include, of course, the equation
of state, described in >Sect. 6.1, which provides the pressure as a function of the temperature,
density, and chemical composition. Obviously this is needed to solve the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium. The second important input is the nuclear energy generation rate – >Sect. 6.2 –
which, as mentioned, is needed to maintain stable temperatures during long periods of time.
Attention will be paid to only the most important thermonuclear reaction rates, namely, to
those relevant for the hydrogen, helium, and carbon burning phases, and other interesting
nuclear reactions will be briefly mentioned, but the aim of this section is not to be exhaus-
tive. The interested reader is referred to the several recent works on this particular topic –
see, for instance, the detailed and interesting paper of Longland et al. (2010) and subsequent
publications – fordetailed and exhaustive information. As alreadyshown, opacities and conduc-
tivities are crucial in evaluating the rate at which energy is transported, and they are described

18 1
Stellar Structure
in >Sect. 6.3, while >Sect. 6.4 is devoted to describe the most recent neutrino emission rates.
Finally, in >Sect. 7 an overview will be given of the several other physical inputs which are only
required under special circumstances.
6.1 Equation of State
The equation of state describes the thermodynamical properties of stellar matter and relates
density to pressure, temperature, and chemical composition. It is particularly simple in the case
of an ideal gas, but physical processes relevant for stars – that include, among others, ionization,
electron degeneracy, moleculardissociation, radiation pressure, orCoulomb interactions – turn
the treatment of the equation of state into a rather complex issue. In dealing with these effects,
care must be taken to ensure the treatment to be thermodynamically consistent in the sense that
it satisfies the thermodynamical identities between the different quantities. One way in which
this can be achieved consists in deriving the equation of state from the free energy of the gas.
Using this approach, the thermodynamical state of the gas for a given temperature, density, and
composition is derived minimizing the free energy, which yields the occupation numbers and
ionization states. The relevant thermodynamical quantities can be then obtained as derivatives
of the free energy. This is the basis for the so-called chemical picture in determining the equa-
tion of state. The second way to ensure thermodynamical consistency is based on the physical
picture. Within this less used approach, instead of dealing with the chemical equilibrium of a
set of predefined ions, atoms, and molecules, only elementary particles of the problem (nuclei
and electrons) are assumed at the beginning, and composite particles appear as a result of the
interactions in the system.
It is customary to characterize the chemical composition of stellar matter by means of the
mean molecular weight, μ, defined as μ = ϱ/(n mH), where n is the total number of particles
per unit volume and mH the atomic mass unit (.× −g). For a mixture of fully ionized
gases, the molecular weight of the gas is given by the harmonic mean of the molecular weights
of the ions (μo) and electrons (μe):

μ = 

(1.61)
where

μo

(1.62)

μe

(1.63)
with Xi, Ai, and Zi being the mass fraction (normalized to unity), Xi = ϱi/ϱ, atomic weight,
and charge, respectively, of element i. These definitions are apparent by noting that
n =

(1.64)
where ni is the number of ions per unit volume of element i. In the case of a neutral gas, the
molecular weight reduces to μo. For complete ionization, a simple expression for μe is obtained

Stellar Structure 1
19
by assuming that for all elements heavier than helium (Z > ), Ai/Zi ≈. In this case the
molecular weight per electron becomes
μe =

+ XH
,
(1.65)
where XH is the abundance by mass of hydrogen. In this approximation and when there is no
hydrogen, μe = .
6.1.1 Ions
In the absence of quantum effects, and assuming that the potential energy of particle interac-
tions is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the particles, the equation of stateof ions adopts
the simplest form. The particles obey the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, and the equation
of state corresponding to an ideal (perfect) gas results
P =
kB
mHμ ϱ T.
(1.66)
This equation describes the equation of state of fully ionized matter, as found in the deep interior
of stars (note that the electron contribution is through μ), as well as matter where all electrons
are in the atom (no ionization at all).
If photons contribute appreciably to gas pressure, Prad = (/)aT, then the equation of
state becomes (assuming that radiation is in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter)
P =
kB
mH μ ϱ T + 
aT.
(1.67)

case of neutral matter, there are no internal degrees of freedom):

(1.70)

Here, β quantifies the importance of radiation pressure, and is defined as β ≡Pgas/P, where P
is the total pressure due to gas plus radiation. If radiation pressure is negligible, then β →and
Pgas →P, CP →kB/(μmH), and ∇ad →., the well-known values for the ideal gas. For
β →, P →Prad, CP →∞, and ∇ad →..
This simple treatment ignores a number of important effects that are relevant in the astro-
physical context. For instance, at low temperatures, partial ionization of matter must be taken
into account. This changes the mean molecular weight and the energetics of the gas. The treat-
ment of partial ionization is usually done assuming chemical equilibrium between the gas
constituents. In this case, the ratio n j+/n j of atoms j + times ionized to those which are j
times ionized is given by the Saha equation

(1.71)
where u j is the partition function for the ion in the energy state j (which is a function of T), h
is the Planck constant, Pe is the electronic pressure, and χ j is the ionization energy. Note that
ionization is favored at high temperatures and low electronic pressures. Quantities such as CP,
∇ad, and μ are notably affected by ionization. In particular, ∇ad is decreased below 0.4 and CP
markedly increases when compared with the values resulting from fully ionized perfect gas. It
is important to note, however, that the treatment of ionization is a difficult task since it involves
considering the various ionization degrees of all chemical species. The problem is specified by
a full set of coupled Saha equations, the solution of which can only be done numerically.
6.1.2 Electrons
The inner regions of the vast majority of highly evolved stars, including white dwarf stars, are
dominated by degenerate electrons. At very high densities and low temperatures, the de Broglie
wavelength of electrons, h/(mekBT)/, becomes larger than the mean separation of electrons
(d ∼ϱ−/) and, as a result, quantum effects become relevant. Hence, electrons become degen-
erate and quantum mechanics – the Pauli exclusion principle – strongly affects the equation
of state. In this case, the distribution of electron momenta obeys the Fermi–Dirac statistics,
and the average occupation number at equilibrium of a cell in the phase space – actually, the
distribution function of energies – is given by
f (ε) =

+ exp[(ε −μq)/kBT],
(1.72)
where μq is the chemical potential of the gas and ε is the kinetic energy corresponding to the
momentum, p, which is given by:
ε(p) = mec[
√
+ (p/mec)−].
(1.73)
Note that this expression is valid for both relativistic and nonrelativistic electrons – in the
nonrelativistic limit (pc ≪mec), and ε ≃p/me. For noninteracting, degenerate electrons at

a given temperature T, the number density and pressure for the electron gas are, respectively,

(1.75)
In the limit of high temperature and low density, μq/kBT ≪−, and the distribution func-
tion reduces to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, f (ε) →exp[−(ε −μq)/kBT]. In this
case, Pe →nekBT. At very high densities (or very low temperatures), that is, when the de
Broglie wavelength is much larger than the mean separation, the electron gas behaves as a zero-
temperature gas. In this zero-temperature approximation, μq ≫kBT and μq is identified with
the Fermi energy (εF). Hence, the Fermi–Dirac distribution that characterizes electrons reduces
to the step-like function:
f (ε) = { 
if ε ≤εF

if ε > εF.
In this situation, electrons occupy only the energy states up to εF, and not the higher energy
states where the distribution function is zero. In particular, those electrons with energies close
to εF will make the largest contribution to the pressure. In this zero-temperature approximation,
the so-called complete degeneracy approximation, the electron pressure can be easily derived
by considering only the energy states up to εF. Then, ( > 1.74) and ( > 1.75) need only to
be integrated up to pF, the momentum corresponding to the Fermi energy. Using the relation
ϱ = μemHne, the electron pressure and mass density become then

theirusual meaning. Note that this expression is valid foranyrelativisticdegree (Chandrasekhar
1939). Relativistic effects have to be taken into account at very high densities – note that as
the density is increased so does pF. In particular, relativistic effects start becoming prominent
when pF ≈mec or x ≈, which corresponds to a density of ϱ/μe ≈g cm−. This density
corresponds to typical values of the central densities in white dwarf stars. Thus, it is expected
that electrons in the core of white dwarfs are partially relativistic. Expansions of the equation
for the electronic pressure Pe are possible in the limiting cases x →, namely, nonrelativistic,
and x →∞, extremely relativistic. In both cases it is possible to eliminate the variable x, thus
resulting in simple equations for the pressure of a completely degenerate electron gas:

where Pe is in dyn cm−. Although the zero-temperature approximation is an idealized one,
the electron gas in some astrophysical environments behaves as if it were indeed at zero tem-
perature. This is the case of the core of cool white dwarfs, where their structure is supported
entirely by the pressure of an almost completely degenerate electron gas. This becomes clear
by noting that the condition for complete degeneracy, TF ≡εF/kB ≫T, where TF is the Fermi
temperature, can be written in the form (for nonrelativistic electrons):
TF = 

(1.79)
For a typical white dwarf with a central density of g cm−, TF = × K, which is
much larger than the core temperature (typical core temperatures range from to K).
Hence, the electron gas behavesas a zero-temperatureFermi gas. In sharp contrast, at the center
of the Sun ϱ/μe ≈, thus TF ≈× K, smaller than its central temperature (∼K).
Hence, electron degeneracy is not relevant at the center of the Sun. Finally, note the smaller
dependence of pressure on density for relativistic electrons. This relativistic “softening” of the
equation of state is responsible for the existence of a limiting mass for white dwarf stars, the
so-called Chandrasekhar limiting mass (Chandrasekhar 1939).
As noted, the equation of state of white dwarf interiors can be well approximated by that
of an ideal Fermi gas at zero temperature. This has important consequences. In particular, the
pressure only depends on the density and not on the temperature. Consequently, the control
parameter to balance the gravitational pull in this case is ϱ, at odds with what was discussed
in >Sect. 1 for normal stars. It should be reminded that for main sequence stars the control
parameter is the temperature, and hence more massive stars have larger temperatures. This is
not the case for white dwarfs. Massive white dwarfs have larger central densities. It is easy to
also show that more massive white dwarfs have smaller radii and, in the limit, Chandrasekhar’s
mass appears as the limiting mass for which the radius of the equilibrium configuration is zero.
In the case of finite temperature (T ≠), the Fermi–Dirac distribution for electrons cannot
be approximated by a step-like function as in the case in which complete degeneracy is assumed.
Here, TF ∼T and those electrons with energies near εF can occupy levels with energies larger
than εF. This situation is referred to as partial degeneracy, and the number density and electron
pressure are given by (> 1.74) and (> 1.75), respectively. Only the case of nonrelativistic elec-
trons, for which ε = p/(me), will be considered here. Introducing the degeneracy parameter
α = −μq/kBT, these equations become

(1.82)
It should be kept in mind that in the case of partial degeneracy, relativistic effects have to be
considered for temperatures in excess, K. Indeed, it has been shown that relativistic effects
for a degenerate gas become relevant when density exceeds g cm−. At such densities, degen-
eracy will be essentially complete unless T > K. These rather extreme conditions are only
found in some very late stages of stellar evolution. Hence, the equation of state in the case of
relativistic partial degeneracy will not be discussed, instead the reader is referred to the spe-
cialized literature for this specific topic. In particular, it is worth mentioning here that the most
commonly used equation of state is the so-called Helmholtz equation of state. Full details of the
Helmholtz equation of state are provided in Timmes and Swesty (2000). This implementation
of the equation of state includes contributions from radiation, completely ionized nuclei, and
degenerate and relativistic electrons; has perfect thermodynamic consistency; and covers the
density and temperature ranges −≤ϱ (g cm−) ≤and ≤T (K) ≤, respectively.
It is freely available on the Web page of F. X. Timmes,1 where several additional physical inputs
can also be found. Continuing with our treatment, it is immediately clear from ( > 1.80) to
(> 1.81) that
Pe = nekBT [

F/(α)
F/(α) ] .
(1.83)
This equation gives the pressure of a nonrelativistic, partially degenerateelectron gas. Given
ϱ (or ne) and T, the value of α can be found from (>1.80), and F/(α) and Pe can be assessed.
Note that the term in brackets in ( > 1.83) measures the degree to which the pressure of a
degenerate electron gas differs from that of a nondegenerate gas. In the nondegenerate limit,
α →∞, the term in brackets tends to 1, and Pe →nekBT. Even for α > , the electron pressure
is basically the pressure of a nondegenerate gas.>Equation 1.83 also shows that the transition
from the nondegenerate regime to that of complete degeneracy as the density increases is not
discontinuous, but instead there is a gradual transition between those extreme conditions.
These and other concepts become clear when an expansion of the Fermi–Dirac integrals is
considered. This is possible in the limits of weak and strong degeneracy. For weak degeneracy
(α > ) it can be shown that
ne = (πmekBT)/

Note that for very large values of α, only the first term of each series is relevant, and the

to the pressure of an ideal gas due to very weak degeneracy is

which is valid for large enough α. On the other hand, for strong, but not complete, degeneracy
(α ≪−), expansion of the Fermi–Dirac integrals leads to

where E = (/)PeV is the internal energy of electrons. Taking into account that dne = – the

specific heat at constant volume for a almost completely degenerate electron gas is
CV ≈π

εF
≪.
(1.90)
Thus, the specific heat for degenerate electrons is proportional to temperature. In the case
of strong degeneracy, the specific heat of the electron gas is much smaller than that of an ion
gas. This is a somewhat expected result because, as a result of the exclusion principle, only those
electrons with energies near the Fermi energy will be able to change its energy as a result of a
temperature variation.

Note that ions are treated as a Maxwell–Boltzmann gas. This is so because at any given
temperature ions require much higher densities than electrons to become degenerate – because
of their larger mass, the de Broglie wavelength corresponding to ions is much shorter than that
of electrons. For strong degeneracy, ions barely contribute to the total pressure. As a matter of
fact, the stronger the degeneracy, the smaller the contribution of the ion gas to the total pressure.
However, ions mostly contribute to the mass density (note the presence of mH in the equation
for density) and strongly influence the thermodynamic properties of the mixture as well.
6.1.3 Nonideal Eﬀects
The ion and electron equations of state just described have to be modified in the presence of
interactions between particles. In particular, at high densities and low temperatures, Coulomb

interactions modify the thermodynamical properties of the ion gas, and in particular the spe-
cific heat. The strength of Coulomb interactions – relative to the thermal kinetic energy – is
determined by the Coulomb coupling parameter, which is defined as:
Γ = (Ze)
akBT = .Z
T
(ϱ

/
(1.93)
where Tis the temperature in units of K, ϱis the density in units of g cm−, and a is
the radius of the Wigner–Seitz sphere:
a = (π
ni)
−/
,
(1.94)
ni being the number density of ions. For small values of Γ, Coulomb forces are of minor impor-
tance (relative to thermal motions) and the ions behave like an ideal noninteracting gas. But,
once Γ becomes of order unity, ions begin to undergo short-range correlations, eventually
behaving like a liquid. For large enough values of Γ (∼180), as usually found in the core of cool
white dwarfs, they form a lattice structure. Coulomb interactions between the charged particles
of the gas make a negative contribution to the pressure and at low densities affect the energetics
and ionization states. Various types of interactions between the constituents have to be taken
into account in a realistic treatment that eventually leads to “pressure ionization.” Neglecting
these interactions and considering only a simple treatment of ionization given by the Saha equa-
tion – see (> 1.71) – leads to the incorrect prediction that matter at the center of the Sun is far
from being completely ionized. Sophisticated equations of state for solar-type stellar interior
conditions are those of Mihalas et al. (1988) and OPAL (Rogers and Iglesias 1992; Rogers et al.
1996), based on the chemical and physical picture, respectively, whereas for cool white dwarfs
the most up-to-date treatment can be found in Segretain et al. (1994) and references therein.
6.2 Nuclear Reactions
6.2.1 General Concepts
Consider a generic reaction between a particle a and a nucleus X to produce a nucleus, Y and
a particle b. Usually, both a and b can be either another nucleus, a photon, a proton, a neutron,
or an α particle. These are the most common reactions in stellar interiors, although not the
only ones since at very large densities electron captures may also play a role. A symbolic way of
expressing this is
a + X →Y + b
(1.95)
although in a short and more convenient notation this is frequently expressed as X(a, b)Y.
In all nuclear reactions charge, nucleon number, momentum, and energy must be conserved.
However, the sum of the masses of the reactants differs from the sum of the masses of the prod-
ucts. The difference is called the mass excess. The mass excess is linked to the binding energy EB
of the nuclei involved in the nuclear reaction. Consider a nucleus of mass number A, charge Z,
and mass M(A, Z). The binding energy – that is, the energy required to separate the nucleons
against their mutual attraction by the strong nuclear forces – is defined as
EB = [(A −Z) mn + Zmp −M (A, Z)] c,
(1.96)

26 1
Stellar Structure
and the binding energy per nucleon is EB/A. The mass excess is then
ΔM = Ma + MX −Mb −MY = ΔEB/c,
(1.97)
where ΔEB is the difference of binding energy of the reaction products and reactants. This
energy difference is released in exothermic nuclear reactions and is responsible for keeping sta-
ble the temperature in stellar interiors. For instance, when hydrogen is burned to form helium,
four hydrogen nuclei are converted in one helium nucleus. Given the masses of the proton and
of a helium nucleus, 26.5 MeV are released in the process, corresponding to just 0.7% of the
rest mass of the system. The binding energy increases as a function of mass number, peaks for
Fe, and then decreases. Thus, exothermic reactions are either the consequence of thermonu-
clear fusion of light nuclei or of fission of nuclei heavier than Fe into lighter ones. The former
constitutes the main energy source in stars, provided that the temperatures are sufficiently high
to overcome the Coulomb barrier of the interacting particles. On the other hand, endothermic
nuclear reactions are only produced in those environments where an excess of thermal energy
is available.
6.2.2 Thermonuclear Reaction Rates
The nuclear reaction rate between two nuclei can be expressed as:
raX = nanX
+ δaX
⟨σv⟩aX =

+ δaX
ϱN 
AXaXX
AaAX
⟨σv⟩aX,
(1.98)
where the Kronecker δ prevents from counting twice identical particles, na and nX are the
number densities of the reacting particles, Xa and XX are the corresponding mass fractions,
NA is Avogadro’s number, and ⟨σv⟩aX is the product of the nuclear cross section, σ, and the
relative velocity, v, of the intervening nuclei, averaged over the distribution of relative velocities.
At the densities and temperatures typical of stellar interiors the distribution of velocities of the
interacting nuclei can be well approximated by a Maxwellian thermal distribution, because at
the relevant conditions found in most stars ions are nondegenerate:
⟨σv⟩aX =
√

πμ(kBT)∫
∞

Eσ(E) exp(−E
kBT ) dE
(1.99)
where E is the relative kinetic energy, and μ is the reduced mass of the colliding nuclei. For
nonresonant reactions induced by charged particles the astrophysical S-factor, S(E), is usually
introduced instead of the nuclear cross section:
σ(E) = S(E)
E
exp[−πη(E)],
(1.100)
where η(E) = ZaZXα/v is the Sommerfeld parameter, and α is the fine structure constant.
The exponential factor measures the probability of penetration of the Coulomb barrier. This is
done because the S(E) is a smoothly varying function and can be better extrapolated to low
energies, the regions where most of the relevant nuclear reactions occur. Accordingly, after a

(1.105)
and Tis the temperature in units of K. The factor faccounts for the electron screening
and will be discussed later. Hence, the values that need to be measured experimentally (or, in
the cases where this is impossible, theoretically computed) are S(), S′(), and S′′().
This formulation is only valid for nonresonant reactions. However, there are several nuclear
reactions in which there is a resonance. This happens when the energy of the interacting nuclei
is coincident with the energy level of an intermediate nucleus that eventually decays to produce
the daughter nuclei:
a + X →Z →Y + b.
(1.106)
When this occurs, the nuclear reaction rate is enhanced by several orders of magnitude. For the
sake of simplicity, and without any loss of generality, it will be assumed that particle Z has only
one single excited state and that, moreover, can only decay to particles a and X and b and Y.
The probability of these transitions is given by the corresponding lifetimes, τa and τb, which
can be easily expressed by the inverse of the partial widths of the resonance in the incident and
exit channels, Γa and Γb. Thus, the probability of the direct reaction is Γb/Γ, where Γ = Γa + Γb,
while that of the backward reaction is Γa/Γ. In this case it can be shown that the cross section
of the resonant nuclear reaction is given by the well-known Breit–Wigner formula:
σaX(E) = π̵λω
ΓaΓb
(E −E)+ (Γ/),
(1.107)
where ̵λ = ħ/p, p =

is a statistical factor that takes into account the angular momenta of the intervening particles,
J is the total angular momentum of the resonant state, and Ja and JX are the corresponding
angular momenta of particles a and X. Obviously, ( > 1.107) shows that the closer the energy
to the mean energy of the resonance, the more likely the reaction. Thus, averaging over the
Maxwellian distribution, we obtain

(1.111)
which, in combination with (> 1.98), provides the thermonuclear rate.
6.2.3 Electron Screening
The thermonuclear reaction rates previously explained assume that the reacting particles are
isolated. In fact, in stellar interiors this is not true, as the plasma is totally ionized. Thus, around
each nuclei there is a cloud of electrons that shields the positive charges, hence lowering the
Coulomb barrier and enhancing the reaction rates. Consequently, the nuclear reaction rates
derived in >Sect. 6.2.2 must be conveniently modified to account for this. This is done using a
multiplicative factor, f . Here, it will be outlined how this screening factor is computed.
In the weak-screening approximation (valid in the case of low densities) the modified
electrostatic potential is given by (Salpeter 1954):
V(r) = αZaZX
r
e−r/rDH,
(1.112)
where all the symbols but the Debye–Hückel radius have been already defined:

being
ζ = ∑
i
Zi(Zi + )

xi,
(1.114)
where xi is the number abundance of chemical species i, with charge Zi and atomic mass
number Ai.
The weak-screening approximation holds when the average interaction energy between
particles is smaller than the mean particle kinetic energy. In this case the thermonuclear

reaction rate is enhanced by a factor:

,
(1.115)
where Tis the temperature in units of K.
In the case of strong screening (large densities), however, this expression is no longer valid,
and another approximation must be used. For the sake of conciseness the formulation of Itoh
et al. (1990) will be closely followed, and for simplicity a one-component plasma will also be
assumed. For extremely dense stellar plasmas the enhancement factor is computed from two
important parameters that characterize dense plasmas: the Coulomb coupling parameter Γ,
given by (> 1.93), and
τ = [(π

/
,
(1.116)
where mp is the proton mass. This parameter gives the classical turning point at the Gamow
peak r ≃Γ/τ. In this analysis the electrons are assumed to be strongly degenerate. That is, it is
assumed that T ≪TF, where TF is the Fermi temperature, and furthermore the ions are treated
as classical particles. Accordingly, their thermal de Broglie wavelength
Λ =

AmpkBT
(1.117)
verifies the condition niΛ≤. Under these conditions the enhancement factor is given by:
ln f = .Γ −τh(β),

where
h(β) = .β + .β+ .β−.β+ .β

(1.119)
with β = Γ/τ.
6.2.4 Nuclear Networks
Nuclearreactions not onlyrelease energybut alsochange the chemical composition ofthe stellar
interior. This is an important issue as chemical composition changes are an important driver of
stellar evolution. Accordingly, the necessary equations to follow the change of chemical com-
position must be added to the set equations presented in > Sects. 2–4. The change of molar
abundances Yi = ni/ϱNA with time due to nuclear processes is followed using a set of coupled
ordinary differential equations. If N is the number of chemical species, the nuclear network has
a size N . A typical reaction network reads:

⎠.
(1.120)
The first term in (>1.120) corresponds to the net destruction of nucleus i due to its interac-
tion with nucleus j, while the second one corresponds to the creation of nucleus i from nuclear
reactions involving nuclei k and l. The third term in this equation is the spontaneous radioactive

decay of nuclei i with timescale τi. As can be seen the nuclear reaction equations constitute a
set of first-order, nonlinear differential equations. In most stellar evolutionary codes, (>1.120)
is discretized in a convenient way and the chemical changes are obtained inverting a matrix.
For the sake of conciseness, it is assumed that nuclear decays can be neglected. If the beginning
and the end of the time interval are denoted by superscripts n and n + , then (> 1.120) can be
linearized and expressed as (Arnett and Truran 1969)

Nevertheless, adequate time steps must be chosen. Typically,

(1.122)
where η is a constant less than unity. Typical values for this constant range from 0.01 to 0.05.
6.2.5 Hydrogen Burning Reactions
The energy source of main sequence stars is hydrogen burning, and the reaction product is
helium. The total energy yield of this nuclear reaction is 26.73 MeV. Depending on whether
a star occupies the lower or the upper main sequence, hydrogen burning occurs through the
pp-chains or the CNO cycle. For the reader unfamiliar with this terminology, it should be noted
that massive stars are located in the upper main sequence, whereas low-mass stars populate the
lower main sequence. There are three pp-chains, and in all of them the first step involves a weak
interaction to form deuterium and an e−e+ annihilation:
H +H →H + e+ + νe
In a second step an isotope of helium is formed:
H +H →He + γ.
Once enough He is accumulated it follows the so-called pp-I chain:
He +He →He + H.
However, for the temperatures typical of main sequence stars He is also burned through
the pp-II chain:
He +He →Be + γ
Be + e−→Li + νe
Li +H →He
or the pp-III chain, in which an excited state of beryllium decays to form two helium nuclei:
He +He →Be + γ
Be +H →B + γ
B →Be∗+ e+ + νe
Be∗→He.

Stellar Structure 1
31
The pp-II chain starts to be relevant for temperatures above ∼.× K, while the pp-III
chain operates for temperatureslarger than ∼.×K. Finally, it is important to realize that all
the nuclei involved in these chains but helium and hydrogen are very unstable, so the interac-
tions are rather inefficient. Actually, the CNO cycle is a more efficient way to produce helium.
In fact, CNO cycle is a bi-cycle: the CN cycle, which is dominant for relatively low tempera-
tures, and the NO cycle, which operates mostly for larger temperatures. Both cycles need a seed
of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen to be operative, and these nuclei catalyze the conversion of
hydrogen into helium. To begin with, the CN cycle is described next:
H +C →N + γ
N →C + e+ + νe
H +C →N + γ
H +N →O + γ
O →N + e+ + νe
H +N →C +He + γ.
In this cycle the reaction with the smallest cross section, which acts as a bottleneck, is the
fourth one. Thus, in equilibrium the overall rate is governed by the reaction rate of N. Also,
the last reaction of the CN cycle can be substituted by this suite of nuclear reactions:
H +N →O + γ
H +O →F + γ
F →O + e+ + νe
H +O →N +He + γ
which is known as the ON cycle. According to the previous discussion, the equilibrium CNO
abundances are determined by the nuclear cross section of N, and thus the CNO cycle also
converts carbon and oxygen into nitrogen. Perhaps, the most commonly used reaction rates
for all this suite of reactions are those of Caughlan and Fowler (1988), although there are more
recent prescriptions – see, for instance, Adelberger et al. (2011).
6.2.6 Helium Burning Reactions
Once hydrogen is exhausted in the core of a main sequence star, the pressure gradient cannot
be balanced by the energy release of nuclear reactions. Hence, the hydrogen-exhausted core
contracts, and becomes hotter. At the same time a hydrogen burning shell is established, the
envelope expands, and the star becomes a red giant. Moreover, the envelope becomes convec-
tivelyunstable and the products ofnuclearreactions produced deepin the starare dredged-upto
the surface. This is perhaps the most convincing proof of our ability to correctly understand the
fine details of stellar structure and evolution, because the theoretically computed abundances of
most of the nuclear species match those observationally found. When the temperature reaches
T ∼K helium is ignited through the so-called triple-alpha process, and contraction stops.
This nuclear reaction can actually be regarded as a three-body interaction, thereby its name,

32 1
Stellar Structure
and not a normal nuclear reaction. The suite of reactions is
He +He ⇌Be∗
He +Be∗⇌C∗
C∗→C + γ.
Note that the nuclear isotope Be∗is very short-lived at these very high temperatures. This is
the reason why this reaction is usually considered a three-body interaction, and also why as
soon as some carbon is produced α captures on it rapidly set in:
He +C →O.
Thus, the reaction products of helium burning are carbon and oxygen, the ratio between their
abundances being extremely dependent on the temperature at which burning proceeds. As
mentioned previously, the C(α, γ)O reaction rate is the subject of a vivid debate, as it is one
of the most poorly determined experimentally. The nuclear cross section relies on an extrapola-
tion to low energies of the experimental data, which involves several resonances. Since this cross
section is crucial in several stellar evolutionary stages, this constitutes a serious drawback of the
theory. The most commonly employed nuclear reaction rates of this set of nuclear reactions are
those of the NACRE compilation (Angulo et al. 1999).
6.2.7 Carbon Burning Reactions
Once helium is exhausted in the inner regions of the star, its core can no longer support its own
gravitational force, and consequently starts to contract again until the temperatures necessary
to burn carbon are reached. This occurs at T ∼× K. At the same time the star climbs the
so-called asymptotic giant branch in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Carbon burning only
occurs for stars with masses larger than ∼M⊙(García-Berro et al. 1997; Ritossa et al. 1996).
The nuclear reaction network involved in the carbon burning phase is shown in >Fig. 1-2. As
can be seen, the number of nuclear isotopes largely increases, and several isotopes of carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sodium, and magnesium are involved. The most relevant reactions are,
nevertheless, the carbon–carbon reaction, yielding either neon or magnesium, and α and pro-
ton and neutron captures. The most recent and up-to-date nuclear reaction rates for these last
reactions are those of Rauscher and Thielemann (2000, 2001) and Iliadis et al. (2010), whereas
in most stellar evolutionary codes the prescription of Caughlan and Fowler (1988) is usually
adopted for the fusion of two carbon nuclei.
6.2.8 Other Nuclear Reactions of Interest
After carbon exhaustion there are several other nuclear burning stages. These burning stages
only occur for stars with mass larger than ∼M⊙– see, for instance, Ritossa et al. (1999).
These burning stages include neon photo-disintegration, oxygen burning, and silicon burn-
ing. Neon is burned before oxygen because at the very high temperatures required to overcome
the Coulomb barrier of oxygen atoms (∼.× K), Ne is photo-disintegrated:
Ne + γ ⇌O + α.

⊡Fig. 1-2
Nuclear reaction network for carbon burning. From García-Berro et al. (1997)
This reaction occurs at T ∼.× K and is usually followed by an α capture (using the α
particles liberated in the photo-disintegration) on Ne to produce Mg:
Ne + α →Mg + γ.
(1.124)
Consequently, the products of neon photo-disintegration are oxygen and magnesium, plus
some other products (sodium, zinc, aluminum, silicon, etc.) with much smaller abundances.
After neon is exhausted the next nuclear burning stage is oxygen burning:
O + O →Si + α
→P + p
→S + n
plus the corresponding recaptures of p, n, and α particles. The final products are mainly Si
and S, and traces of ,S, ,Cl, ,Ar, ,K, and ,Ca.
Finally, the last major burning stage is silicon burning. This burning stage involves a very
complex network of fast photo-disintegrations, with all sorts of reaction products (protons,
neutrons, and α particles), and the corresponding back-reactions. The main products of silicon
burning are iron-peak nuclei. However, it is worth mentioning that, at odds with all the previous
burning stages, silicon burning occurs at such high temperatures(T ∼.×K) that reactions

34 1
Stellar Structure
are in quasi-equilibrium. This means that the reactions between the intervening nuclei are so
fast that the abundances of such nuclei are close to Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium. Under these
conditions the typical reactions are photo-disintegrations to produce neutrons, protons, and α
particles, plus the corresponding (γ, α), (n,α), (p,α), and (n,p) reactions – that is, a chain of
reactions which are all in equilibrium. Using basic thermodynamical relations the equilibrium
abundances can be obtained:

where g is the nuclear partition function and the rest of the symbols have been previously
defined. To solve this equation the conditions of baryon and charge conservation must also
be added. It turns out that in nuclear statistical equilibrium – see, for instance Bravo and
García-Senz (1999), and references therein – the composition of matter is essentially deter-
mined by the density, the temperature, and the electron fraction, Ye = ne/n, which is basically
the proton-to-nucleon ratio.
6.3 Opacities and Conductivities
6.3.1 Radiative Opacities
As previously discussed in >Sect. 4, in stellar interiors the diffusion approximation is valid and
the temperature gradient is proportional to the Rosseland mean opacity, obtained as a harmonic
mean of the frequency-dependentopacity – see (>1.31). Accordingly, opacity is a crucial physi-
cal property of stellar matter, since it determines the rate at which energy is transferred from the
interior to the outer space. Opacity calculations rely on very detailed descriptions of the inter-
action between the radiation field and the stellar matter. In fact, bound–free, bound–bound,
and free–free interactions between photons and electrons are significant sources of opacity. In
turn, these processes depend on the detailed thermodynamical state of the gas, in particular,
on the detailed distribution of electrons on the energy levels of the atoms. Consequently, the
equation of state plays a major role in the calculation of the opacity.
At high temperatures, when stellar material is almost completely ionized, the main source
of opacity is electron scattering with photons. Under these conditions, the cross section for the
interaction of photons with electrons is that of Thomson scattering:
σe = π
( e
mec)

= .× −cm.
(1.126)
From this equation, the opacity due to electron scattering is computed as κe = σene/ϱ.
Given that ne = ϱ/(μemH) = .ϱ(+ XH)/mH, it follows that
κe = .(+ XH) cmg−.
(1.127)
Note that in the case of complete ionization, this opacity source is independent of the tem-
perature and density. Since κe is independent of frequency, ( > 1.127) provides the Rosseland
mean for electron scattering. However, at high enough temperatures, when photons are suffi-
ciently energetic (kBT ∼mec), the exchange of momentum between electrons and photons
has to be considered, thus reducing somewhat the opacity.

The second important source of opacity are free–free transitions. In this case absorption
of radiation occurs when a free electron approaches an ion of charge Z. The physical principle
operating in this case is quite simple: As an electron passes close to an ionized atom it can be
accelerated or deccelerated, respectively, absorbing or emitting a photon in the process. Since
the photon can be of any wavelength, radiation emitted in this way has a continuous spectrum.
These processes can be studied from a classical point of view. It can be shown that the absorption
coefficient is proportional to Zν−per ion. At a temperature T, the electron thermal velocity
is v∼T. Consequently the time interval during which the electron is close enough to the ion
scales as v−∼T−/. Moreover, at a density ϱ, the number of electron–ion pairs able to take
part in the process scales as ϱ, and therefore the contribution to the opacity scales as ∼ϱT−/.
Since the absorption coefficient per system is proportional to Zν−, it follows that
κν
ff ∼ZϱT−/ν−.
(1.128)
Thus, the resulting approximate Rosseland opacity due to this process only turns out to be
κff = .× (XH + XHe)(+ XH) ϱ T−/cmg−,
(1.129)
which is often referred to as the Kramers opacity. In this expression XHe is the abundance by
mass of helium.
Absorptions of photons by bound electrons with the result that electrons are removed from
the atoms or ions (the so-called bound–free transitions) constitutes another important source
of continuum opacity. In the case of photo-ionization of a hydrogen-like system consisting of
one electron in the field of charge Ze of an ion, the total bound–free absorption cross section
σν for a photon of frequency ν is
σν ∼Z
νncm,
(1.130)
where n is the principal quantum number of the initial state. To compute the total opacity, the
number density of atoms in the n-th excited state, Nn, has to be considered. The result is
κν
bf ∼∑Nnσν
ϱ
cmg−.
(1.131)
From this, the Rosseland mean opacity due to bound–free transitions only can be derived.
An usual approximation is
κbf = .× Z (+ XH) ϱ T−/cmg−,
(1.132)
where now Z is the mass fraction of elements heavier than helium. Note that this opacity is of
the form of Kramers opacity.
Line absorption resulting from photon-induced transitions between bound levels in atoms
or ions, the so-called bound–bound transitions, importantly contributes to the total opacity at
temperatures below ∼K. The bound–bound cross section is given by
σ bb
ν
= πe
mec fi jϕν,
(1.133)
where fi j is the oscillator strength of the transition from state i to j. This coefficient repre-
sents how strongly the line absorbs. Finally, ϕν is the line profile function. Because of the
large number of transitions (typically a few million lines) that must be taken into account,

36 1
Stellar Structure
bound–bound transitions represent a major complication in opacity calculations. Thermal and
pressure broadening effects are important and the total absorption coefficient critically depends
on temperature.
Negative hydrogen ions, H−, provide another source of opacity. The hydrogen atom can
harbor a second electron in a bound state with a binding energy of only 0.7544 eV. This energy
being so small means that the H−ion will be easily ionized if temperatures exceed a few thou-
sand degrees. In fact, all photons with wavelengths λ < .μm have enough energy to ionize
the H−ion back to a neutral hydrogen atom plus a free electron. Additionally, it is clear that the
total opacity must be proportional to the electron density. However, it also has to be taken into
account that the electrons needed to form H−come from ionized metals. According to these
considerations it turns out that in hot stars the H−ion is so rapidly ionized that this source
of opacity is not relevant. On the contrary, in cool stars there are too few free electrons (since
no ionized metals are present) to form H−ions, so the contribution to the opacity is negligible
as well, whereas for solar-like stars the H−ion is the dominant source of continuum opacity
at optical wavelengths. In particular, the opacity due to the negative hydrogen ion is the most
important source of opacity in the solar atmosphere.
For temperatures lower than ≈5,000 K, the contribution from molecules becomes a relevant
opacitysource. The contributions tomolecularopacity arise from transitions between rotational
and vibrational molecularstates, which are veryfrequent at these verylow temperatures, typical,
for instance, of late-type main sequence stars and cool red giants. Also the formation of small
dust grains at even lower temperatures (≈1,700 K) has to be considered in the opacities needed
to compute reliable atmosphere models of cool stars.
As stems from the preceding paragraphs, which is the dominant source of opacity depends
very much on the thermodynamical state of stellar matter. In general, at low temperatures,
bound–bound and bound–free processes totally dominate the opacity. At larger temperatures,
when ionization is almost complete, free–free transitions take over and become the most impor-
tant source of opacity. These processes become less relevant at even larger temperatures, where
scattering by free electrons is the major source of opacity. Needless to say, all opacity processes
contribute simultaneously to the total opacity, and to compute the resulting value of the radia-
tive opacity, κrad, the sum of the contributions of the monochromatic opacities resulting from
all the processes described so far has to be done. After doing that, the integral in ( > 1.24)
must be computed. It is important to realize at this point of our discussion that the sum of the
Rosseland mean opacities of each opacity component is not equal to the Rosseland mean of
the sum. Hence, the Rosseland mean of a given process lacks meaning, except in the particu-
lar case in which the corresponding process dominates by far the rest of the contributions to
the opacity. For typical stellar compositions, the largest values of the radiative opacity occur for
temperatures between ∼and K, corresponding to the temperatures appropriate to ionize
hydrogen and helium, the principal constituents of stellar matter.
Several groups have computed detailed frequency-averaged opacities. Among them the
most reliable and frequently used opacities are those of the OPAL (Rogers and Iglesias 1992)
and of the OP (Seaton et al. 1994) projects. Both projects have presented their calculations in
the form of extensive tabulations for different chemical compositions for a wide range of tem-
peratures and densities. At very low temperatures the most up-to-date and comprehensive set
of opacity data has been assembled by Ferguson et al. (2005). Their opacities cover temperatures
between 30,000 and 500 K, and, in addition to the usual continuous absorbers, include atomic
and molecular line absorption, and grain absorption and scattering (by silicates, iron, carbon,
and SiC). More recently, Lederer and Aringer (2009) have presented calculations of Rosseland

opacities for low temperatures that consider the effects of varied abundances of carbon and
nitrogen for different metallicities.
6.3.2 Conduction
At the high densities found in the core of evolved stars, the main mechanism of energy transfer
is not radiation but conduction by degenerate electrons. For the conditions found in the deep
cores of these stars, the mean-free path of electrons is usually very large. This is so because
after an interaction in which an electron is involved its energy is in most cases below the Fermi
level. Consequently, since below the Fermi energy all the levels are occupied, the electron has
to travel long distances to release the excess energy absorbed in the interaction. Of course, this
only occurs when kBT ≪εF, that is, in conditions of strong degeneracy. Hence, electrons can
transport energy very efficiently and the related opacity is small (κ ∼/ℓ). It can be shown that,
for strong degeneracy, an approximate expression for the conductive opacity is
κcd ∼× −∑Z
j X jθ j/A j
(+ XH)
T

(ϱ/)cmg−,
(1.134)
where θ j ∼./Z/
j , Tis the temperature in units of K, and X j the abundance by mass of
element j. Note that the larger the density, the smaller the conductive opacity. The reason for
this is that, as already explained, for strong degeneracy it becomes very difficult for an electron
to scatter, with the consequent result that the mean-free path becomes very long. For helium
composition and T ∼K and ϱ ∼g cm−, the conductive opacity is two orders of mag-
nitude smaller than the electron scattering opacity (κes). Accordingly, the total opacity given
by (> 1.31) is very small, of the order of −κes. Finally, it is rather evident from the previous
discussion that at low densities, electrons transport little energy compared to photons.
More elaborated prescriptions than that given by (> 1.134) are available in the referenced
literature. In particular, detailed calculations of conductive opacities for a wide range of stellar
conditions have been given by Itoh et al. (1983). This set of conductive opacities is the most
commonly adopted in nearly all the state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes. However, there
are other prescriptions, the most recent one being that of Cassisi et al. (2007). These authors
provide determinations of the conductive opacity covering the entire parameter space relevant
to stellar evolution models (i.e., both the regime of partial and high electron degeneracy).
6.4 Neutrino Losses
Photons are not the only way in which energy is lost from stars. Neutrinos also play an impor-
tant role, especially during the last stages of stellar evolution. These weakly interacting particles
escape freely from the dense cores of evolved stars – except in the case of core-collapse super-
novae, where the densities are extremely high – carrying out copious amounts of energy. This
is because under most circumstances (but in those found in the central very dense regions of
these supernovae) their interaction cross section with matter is extremely small (∼−xcm,
x being the neutrino momentum in units of MeV/c). Thus, their mean-free paths are very large
and, hence, they can be considered as an instantaneous sink of energy for most stellarevolution-
ary stages. According to this discussion, (> 1.18) must be correspondingly modified to include
an additional term −єν, which acts as an instantaneous sink of energy.

38 1
Stellar Structure
Besides the nuclear processes in which neutrinos are produced as a regular product of the
reaction – like electron captures or the several reactions described in > Sect. 6.2, where the
neutrino energy loss is already included in the nuclear energy released – there are four typical
processes in which neutrinos are produced as a result of purely leptonic processes: the pho-
toneutrino, plasmaneutrino, pair annihilation, and bremsstrahlung processes, respectively. In
the photoneutrino process the outgoing photon in a regular Compton scattering is substituted
by the emission of a neutrino–antineutrino pair. In the plasmaneutrino process a photon mov-
ing in the electron gas – the so-called plasmon – is transformed in a neutrino–antineutrino
pair. Pair annihilation neutrinos are produced at very high temperatures (T > K) in the
reaction e−+e+ ⇌νe + ¯νe, instead of a normal photon. Finally, the emission of a neutrino–
antineutrino pair due to the interaction of a high-energy electron with a heavy nucleus is known
as the neutrinobremsstrahlung process, where again the photon is replaced bythe neutrinopair.
Additionally, there is a less common neutrino process, which only occurs for nuclei with rela-
tively large values of Z and at low densities and temperatures – a situation not commonly found
in stellar interiors – which is the recombination neutrino process. In this process an electron in
the continuum makes a transition to a bound state and a neutrino pair is emitted.
Analytic expressions for all these processes as a function of the density, the temperature,and
the chemical composition have been compiled by Itoh et al. (1996). For the sake of conciseness
and given that these analytical expressions incorporate coefficients that depend on the detailed
chemical composition – which are listed in lengthy tables – their results will not be reproduced
here. Instead, the interested reader is referred to their paper. These neutrino emission rates are
the most commonly used in stellar evolutionary calculations. However, other expressions can
be found in the specialized literature – see, for instance, Haft et al. (1994).

Other Physical Processes
During some evolutionary phases there are other physical processes which become of the maxi-
mum importance. This is especially true for compact stars, and specifically for white dwarfs, for
which element diffusion and radiative levitation are crucial. Element diffusion is of the max-
imum importance to understand the observed purity of white dwarf atmospheres. The very
large surface gravities of these stars makes elements heavier than hydrogen to settle down over
timescales shorter than the evolutionary ones, leaving behind pure hydrogen or helium atmo-
spheres. In these stars, the interfaces between the hydrogen (if present) and helium layers, and
between the helium buffer and the core are the product of element diffusion. The study of ele-
ment diffusion processes in white dwarfs dates back to the early studies of Schatzman (1958).
Since then, numerous studies have been devoted to this subject, and have convincingly demon-
strated that gravitationally induced diffusion is an extremely efficient process in the envelopes
of white dwarfs.
Under the influence of gravity, partial pressure, thermal gradients, and induced electric
fields, the diffusion velocities in a multicomponent plasma satisfy a set of N −independent
linear diffusion equations (Burgers 1969):

In addition, the electrical field E has to be determined. The resistance coefficients Ki j, zi j, z′

(1.142)
In the otherwise pure atmospheres of white dwarf stars there are occasional appearances
of other elements. Consequently, a competing mechanism to gravitational diffusion must be at
work. One of these is radiative levitation, especially for hot white dwarfs – those with effective
temperatureslarger than ∼20,000 K. The physical principle operating here is that ions with large

40 1

charges have larger cross sections and, thus, absorb more photons. This is done usually through
bound–bound interactions, the net effect being that these ions acquire momentum from the
radiation field, thus leading to differential accelerations that make them appear on the surface
of the star. In virtually all recent calculations it is assumed that a given levitating element is trace.
That is, it is assumed that its abundance has no relevant influence on the structure of the star.
Additionally, it is assumed that the approximation of equilibrium abundances holds, and thus
that the radiative acceleration can be equated to the local effective gravity at each mass shell of
the envelope. To solve for the abundances the total radiative acceleration for element i through
bound–bound absorption,

of the bound–bound transition from j to k, and ϕ jk
i is the normalized line profile of such tran-
sition. This acceleration must be equated for each ion to the local gravity at each mass shell.
Clearly, computing radiative accelerations requires improved oscillator strengths and reliable
atomic data. Modern calculations (Chayer et al. 1995) rely on the data bank TOPBASE (Cunto
and Mendoza 1992), associated with the Opacity Project (Seaton et al. 1994).
There are other physical processes that affect stellar evolution like mass loss, rotation, and
magnetic fields. Mass loss is relevant in giant and luminous stars and it is important to explain
some observations. On the other hand, stars are observed to rotate. Rotation affects star evo-
lution particularly via the associated meridional circulation and other processes that lead to
chemical mixing – see Maeder (2009). Additional physical processes associated with changes
in the chemical abundance distribution may affect the evolution of evolved star. This is the case
of old and cool white dwarf stars, where the gravitational energyreleased during carbon-oxygen
phase separation upon crystallization constitutes an additional source of energy that markedly
impacts the cooling times of these stars (Isern et al. 2000).

Boundary Conditions and Stellar Atmospheres
As it will be shown below, to integrate the equations of stellar structure, boundary conditions
are needed at both the stellar center and the surface. At the stellar center, that is, at m = , both
the radius and the luminosity vanish. This leads to singularities. It is not difficult to show that
near the center a first-order Taylor expansion of the equations of stellar structure previously
derived in > Sects. 2–4 yields

The treatment of the surface conditions is more difficult, partly because it involves the dif-
ficult issue of how energy is transported in the very outer layers of the star. At the surface,
m = M and l = L, where L is the surface luminosity that has to be determined. Deriving the
boundary conditions at the surface requires the computation of model atmospheres. Usually,
the Eddington gray approximation for radiative transfer in the case of plane-parallel geometry
is used:
dP
dτ =
g
κrad
(1.150)
T= 
T
eff(τ + 
)
(1.151)
where g is the surface gravity and τ is the optical depth, defined by dτ = κrad ϱ dr. The first
of these equations corresponds to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. Integration of these
two equations from starting values (P ≈, T ≈at τ = ) down to τ = /yields Ps. The layer
at τ = /defines the location of the photosphere from which most of the radiation is emitted
into the space. There the temperature is T = Teff, where Teff is the effective temperature of the
star, which is defined by the relation Ls = π Rσ T
eff, σ = ac/being the Stefan–Boltzmann
constant. Note that Teff corresponds to the temperature of a blackbody that has the same energy
flux of the real star. From here, a two-parameter set of boundary conditions between Teff, Ps,
Ls, and R can be cast. For instance, assuming arbitrary values of R and Ls all the other values at
the surface can be obtained. In fact, from the values of R and Ls, the value of Teff is determined.
Also, the value of g is obtained as well, since the total stellar mass is given. This information
together with the chemical composition of the atmosphere (which is assumed to be the same as
the composition of the outer layers, and thus known) allows to integrate the model atmosphere
and to find Ps.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that during certain stages of evolution, a better treatment for
the outer layers than that given by the Eddington approximation is needed. This is the case for
instance in giant stars, where the effects of sphericity are usually considered. In cool and dense
atmospheres, like those of white dwarfs, the results from full non-gray model atmospheres that
take into account convection has to be considered. This is necessary for a proper determination
of the envelope structure as well as the cooling time of such stars.

Numerical Techniques: Modern Implementations
The basic equations that govern the structure and evolution of a spherically symmetric star in
hydrostatic equilibrium have been derived in >Sects. 2–4. In terms of the Lagrangian variable,
m, they can be written as
∂r
∂m =


∂t + δ
ϱ
∂P

(1.154)
∂T
∂m = −GmT
πrP ∇.
(1.155)
To this set of equations, the equation for the variation of chemical composition with time
has to be added. This, for radiative regions, must be done using the set of equations presented
previously in >Sect. 6.2.4 – see ( > 1.120) – whereas if chemical changes are due to different
mixing processes, a diffusion-like set of equations must be used:
( ∂Yi
∂t ) = ( ∂Yi
∂t )
nuc
+
∂
∂m [(πrϱ)D ∂Yi
∂m ] ,
(1.156)
where the first term represents the chemical changes due to nuclear reactions and the sec-
ond one provides the changes of the chemical abundances resulting from mixing processes,
which are characterized by a diffusion coefficient D. In general, the equations for the abun-
dance changes are decoupled from the set of equations providing the thermal and mechanical
changes, namely, ( > 1.152– 1.155). This is a valid assumption only in the case in which the
nuclear timescale is much larger than the other relevant timescales of the star. This allows to
treat the problem by solving first (> 1.152– 1.155) at a given time tand for a given chemical
composition. Then the change in chemical composition during the time step Δt – that is, the
chemical composition at time t+Δt – is obtained using the physical variables determined at t.
Afterward the new chemical compositions are used recursively to find the new physical vari-
ables at t+Δt, and so on. However, in some advanced stages of evolution, where the changes of
chemical compositions occur in timescales comparable to that of the physical variables, decou-
pling the equations for the chemical changes from the other four equations is not a realistic
assumption. The term εν in ( > 1.154) represents the energy losses by neutrino in erg g−s−,
as discussed in >Sect. 6.4. As mentioned, for most stellar conditions, neutrinos do not inter-
act with matter, thus they only act as an energy sink of energy at the location where they are
produced. In ( > 1.155), ∇= ∇rad – as given by ( > 1.33) – if the energy transport is done by
radiation (and conduction). In the case where energy transport is due to convection, ∇= ∇conv,
where ∇conv is specified by the adopted treatment of convection. In addition, the functions that
describe the properties of stellar matter – ϱ, δ, α, CP, ∇ad, εnuc, εν, κtot, and ∇conv – that depend
on P, T, and chemical composition, must be specified.
>Equations 1.152– 1.155 constitute a set of nonlinear, partial differential equations that
have to be integrated numerically. The independent variables are the mass coordinate m, which
runs from zero to the value of the total mass M – the index r is dropped in the notation – and t.

Stellar Structure 1
43
To solve these equations, the total mass M of the star and proper initial values, usually only the
chemical composition at the initial instant t, together with appropriate boundary conditions
at m = and m = M must be specified. These boundary conditions have been discussed previ-
ously, in >Sect. 8. The solution for r, P, l, T, and chemical composition at a given time in the
whole mass interval is named a stellar model.
A standard technique for solving the equations of stellar structure and evolution is based on
an iterative implicit technique, the so-called the Henyey method or relaxation method,in which
the differential equations are replaced by a set of difference equations in a discrete number of
mass shells (or grid). Here, an initial or approximate solution is gradually improved by applying
successive simultaneous corrections to all variables at all points on the grid. The corrections to
the physical variables are applied until they become insignificant and the initial model “relaxes”
to the correct one. To implement the technique, the star is divided into N concentric mass
shells (very few stellar evolutionary codes use the radius as independent variable), each of them
labeled with the lagrangian coordinate m j, where m= and mN = M. In addition, the time
derivatives appearing in (> 1.154) are usually replaced at any point j of the grid by

where r j+/= (r j++ r j)/and m j+/= (m j++ m j)/. For each mass shell j, the resulting
four difference equations (i = , ) can be written in the form
Gi
j ≡
yi
j+−yi
j
m j+−m j
−fi (y
j+/, . . . , y
j+/) = ,
(1.160)
where y= r, y= P, y= l, and y= T. The index j runs from 2 to N −. At the center
(j = ), singularities occur. There, the radius and luminosity vanish, that is, r = and l = . As
already shown – see >Sect. 8 – the boundary conditions at the center (j = ) can be obtained
by performing a Taylor expansion of (> 1.152) and (> 1.153) – see (> 1.145–1.149) – and it
can be easily shown that they adopt the form
Ci(y
, y
, y
, y
, y
, y
) = ,
(1.161)
with i = , . As for the boundary conditions at the surface (j = N) – see >Sect. 8 – the following
equations can be established:
S≡y
N −hs(y
N, y
N) = 
(1.162)

44 1
Stellar Structure
S≡y
N −qs(y
N, y
N) = .
(1.163)
Usually, a linear approximation is considered for the functions hs and qs. Thus, only three inte-
grations of the model atmosphere – ( > 1.150) and ( > 1.151) – are needed to find all the
coefficients that define hs and qs.
Note that the total number of unknowns is N −and the total number of equations is also
N −. Consider now a given time t and assume that (yi
j)with i = , . . ., and j = , . . ., N is
a first approximation to the solution of the set of equations, which as a first guess may be taken
as the solution at the previous time t −Δt. Since the values of (yi
j)are only an approximation
to the solution to the set of equations and not the real one, it is clear that Gi
j() ≠, Ci() ≠,
and S,() ≠. Here, the label “” refers to the initial guess. Let now δyi
j be the corrections to
all variables at all mass points. A second approximation can be then obtained:
(yi
j)= (yi
j)+ δyi
j,
(1.164)
so that now Gi
j() = , Ci() = , and S,() = . If the corrections are small, a first-order
Taylor expansion yields:
Gi
j() +

∑
m=

∑
m=
∂Gi
j
∂ym
j+
δym
j+= 
i = , . . ., j = , . . ., N −,
(1.165)
and similarly for (> 1.161), (> 1.162), and (> 1.163). The derivatives of Gi
j are evaluated using
the first approximation as arguments. From here, the corrections δyi
j can be found after invert-
ing a band-type matrix (Henyey matrix) which has nonvanishing elements only in blocks near
the diagonal (Henyey et al. 1959, 1964; Larson and Demarque 1964; Nobili and Turolla 1988).
Indeed, note that difference equations depend only on variables at adjacent points. This fact
enormously simplifies the inversion technique to find the corrections δyi
j. After consecutive
iterations, the approximate solution can be improved until the absolute value of all correc-
tions drops below a given limit or difference equations are satisfied to the desired accuracy. To
compute an evolutionary sequence, after convergence of the model at time t, a new time step
is determined, the chemical composition for the new time is assessed from the stellar model
converged at t, which is also used as an initial solution for the new time. The Henyey tech-
nique is a relaxation technique, and has proved to be extremely efficient and stable. It should be
stressed, however, that the equations of stellar structure and evolution are strongly nonlinear,
so it is expected that, since the corrections are obtained from linearized equations, the solution
requires several iterations in some cases, particularly if the initial approximation is not a good
representation of the solution or if the time step is not small enough. Nevertheless, in most
cases, only few iterations are needed to find the solution.

State-of-the-Art Modeling
Building a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary code requires large efforts. As has been made
clear in >Sect. 6, detailed physical inputs are required to produce reasonable models. Not only
that, it has also been shown in >Sect. 9 that the system of differential equations that governs the
structure and evolution of stars must be solved using specific techniques. This, as mentioned
earlier, is a tough task as it involves the solution of a boundary problem.

Stellar Structure 1

There are several existing evolutionary codes which incorporate reliable solvers of the equa-
tions of stellar structure and up-to-date physical inputs. Among these it is worth mentioning,
in alphabetical order, the following ones, but the reader should keep in mind that this list is not
intended to be exhaustive whatsoever:
•
ASTEC – Aarhus STellar Evolution Code (Christensen-Dalsgaard 1982)
•
CESAM – Code d’Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (Morel and Lebreton 2008)
•
DSEP – Darmouth Stellar Evolution Program (Chaboyer et al. 2001)
•
EVOL (Blöcker 1995; Herwig 2000)
•
EVOLVE (Iben 1965), which was subsequently modified to follow carbon burning (García-
Berro and Iben 1994)
•
GARSTEC – Garching STellar Evolution Code (Weiss and Schlattl 2008)
•
FRANEC – Frascati Raphson Newton Evolutionary Code, of which there are several ver-
sions, see for instance Pietrinferni et al. (2004)
•
GENEC – Geneva Evolution Code (Meynet and Maeder 2000)
•
KEPLER (Heger et al. 2000; Weaver et al. 1978)
•
LPCODE – La Plata Stellar Evolutionary Code (Althaus et al. 2005)
•
MESA – Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (Paxton et al. 2011)
•
STARS (Pols et al. 1995)
•
STERN (Heger et al. 2000; Langer 1998)
•
TGEC – Toulouse-Geneva Evolution Code (Richard et al. 1996)
•
TYCHO (Young and Arnett 2005)
•
YREC – Yale Rotating Stellar Evolution Code (Demarque et al. 2008).
Fortunately, some of these codes are freely available on the Internet – although, of course,
some work must be done to adapt them to the specific problem under study – whereas others
can be used with permission of the original authors. Finally, others are proprietary codes and
permission to use them is not granted.
Describing in detail the variety of physical inputs adopted in each one of these stellar evolu-
tionary codes is beyond the scope of this chapter, so the interested reader is referred to the cited
literature. However, a few words regarding the general features of these codes are in order. There
are some codes that are specialized at following the initial stages of stellarevolution, for instance
ASTEC. Many others are able to follow only the hydrogen and helium burning phases and the
thermal pulses on the Asymptotic Giant Branch, but are not able to follow in a detailed and
realistic way the carbon burning phase – FRANEC and GARSTEC are good examples, but not
the only ones – however they perform extremely well at producing realistic sets of isochrones,
while others are specialized in following specific evolutionary stages, for instance the white
dwarf evolutionary phase – the leading example is LPCODE – and they produce very accurate
cooling tracks. Other codes (GNEC and YREC) incorporate the effects of slow rotation. Finally,
other codes are more suitable to follow the evolution of massive stars all the way to the super-
nova stage – KEPLER being an example of these type of codes. Also, most of the freely available
stellar evolutionary codes, but a few ones, rely on gray atmospheres and some adaptations must
be made to incorporate non-gray detailed atmospheres.
It is also important to mention that although all these codes are specifically adapted to the
research needs and interests of the authors and, consequently, the physical inputs are, as previ-
ously said, extremely diverse, there are as well a set of basic ingredients which are common to
all of them. One of these is the usage of the OPAL opacities previously discussed in >Sect. 6.3.
The most up-to-date stellar codes use this set of opacities, which are a reference in the field.

46 1
Stellar Structure
However, prescriptions for the convective instability are very different from one another, as
also are other physically interesting inputs. Specifically, most stellar evolutionary codes use the
classical mixing length treatment of Böhm-Vitense (1958) and the onset of convection is deter-
mined according to the Schwarzschild criterion (∇ad −∇rad < ), see >Sect. 4.3, although
some (variable) amount of convective overshooting is allowed to occur, and only very few stel-
lar evolutionary codes incorporate more sophisticated theories of convection. Finally, it is also
important to realize that most of these state-of-the-art codes adopt the nuclear reaction rates
of the NACRE compilation (Angulo et al. 1999), see >Sect. 6.2, although depending on the
size of the nuclear network employed to follow the abundances other sources for the relevant
cross sections are implemented. Thus, the results obtained using these stellar evolutionary codes
differ sizably from one another, although the general characteristics of the different stellar evo-
lutionary phases agree qualitatively. Anyone trying to pursue the hard task of building a stellar
evolutionary code from scratch or to improve a previous version of one of his/her own should
be aware that most of the necessary pieces of computer code needed to produce realistic phys-
ical inputs can be found on the Web page of the IAU Commission 35.2 Also, the exact way in
which the equations of stellar structure are solved is very different in all the numerical codes.
Although all of the previously listed stellar codes share a common feature, namely, that they
use Henyey-type techniques, the way in which the equations of stellar structure are discretized
varies from one to another code. For instance, most commonly the equations of stellar struc-
ture are discretized adopting the interior mass as the independent variable, but some codes
adopt the radius as the independent variable. Additionally, the pressure, temperature, luminos-
ity, radius, and interior mass can be all defined at the zone edges, but in some codes the pressure,
temperature, and, thus, density are defined midway between l, r, and m. To these differences
one must also add the way in which the changes in composition are dealt with, not only in the
convective regions, but also in the radiative ones. The most extensively used stellar evolution-
ary codes employ nuclear networks similar to that introduced in >Sect. 6.2.4, but the variety
of implementations is also very large, as it is also the number of isotopes followed during the
course of stellar evolution. Finally, the way in which zoning and the choice of adequate time
steps is dealt with is also extremely dependent on the particular taste of the programmer. To
put just one example of these procedures, most stellar evolutionary codes introduce new mesh
points to allow a smooth variation of the relevant physical quantities, say the temperature, den-
sity, pressure, luminosity, etc., inside the star. This is done by allowing a maximum fractional
change between adjacent mass shells, η, which is typically of the order of a few percent. Most
stellar evolutionary codes use this strategy to avoid numerical instabilities, except the STAR
evolutionary code, which incorporates additional equations to determine the adequate zoning
(Eggleton 1971). The way in which the boundary conditions are introduced also adds differ-
ences to the results obtained using each of these evolutionary codes, and the way in which the
initial guess for the next time step is computed is very different as well, since in some codes the
initial solution is extrapolated (linear, semilogarithmic, etc.) from the previous one, while in
some others this initial guess is simply the last computed model (absolutely no extrapolation).
Additional fine details include different prescriptions to deal with the boundaries of convective
regions, as in some codes the nature of a given mass shell cannot change once it is determined
from the initial model (it is always convective or radiative), while in some other codes matter
can change from convective to radiative and vice versa in all trials. Finally, it should be men-
tioned that regions in which an adverse and abrupt temperature gradient forms, implying large

negative luminosities, are difficult to deal with, and that sometimes it is highly advisable to
freeze the mesh during certain periods of time to avoid propagation of numerical errors. The
way in which this is done by the different stellar evolutionary codes is highly dependent on the
specific way in which the code has been designed and written.

Summary
In this chapter, our current understanding of stellar structure has been reviewed. A compre-
hensive discussion of the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium was given in >Sect. 2, while in
> Sects. 3 and >4 the energy conservation law and the treatment of energy transport – either
by radiation, conduction, or convection – were extensively discussed. All these otherwise clas-
sical results were treated in detail, and the most commonly used prescriptions were provided.
Also, when necessary, the needed references to construct realistic stellar configurations were
given as well. With these tools, the virial theorem was introduced in >Sect. 5, which helped to
understand the physical behavior of stars.
In the second part of this chapter, the reader was provided with a series of essential physical
inputs needed to build a stellar model. This includes, of course, the equation of state, the nuclear
reaction rates, the opacities and conductivities, and the neutrino emission rates. This was done
in >Sect. 6. Additional physical processes, of special importance for some evolutionary stages,
were discussed in > Sect. 7. When possible, the aim was to provide to the interested reader
with the most commonly used and/or most reliable or recent physical inputs. As mentioned
in >Sect. 1, the intention was to be as complete as possible, without unintentionally missing
any key reference.
The subject of stellar atmospheres was superficially treated in > Sect. 8, and, certainly,
additional details on this topic are needed, as it was only treated here in connection with the
boundary conditions needed to stellar evolution. The reader can find excellent descriptions else-
where. An approximation to the numerical techniques was given in >Sect. 9, where the most
usually adopted technique was described in full detail. To conclude, in > Sect. 10, the most
widely used stellar evolutionary codes were critically analyzed.
To conclude we feel necessary to explicitly mention at this point of the discussion that the
field of stellar evolution is continuously improving, and most probably several advances during
the coming years will be witnessed. More reliable physical inputs will most likely be incorpo-
rated to improved versions of the available state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes. Better
descriptions of convective mixing will become available, an example being the very recent –
and impressive – work of Canuto (2011), and companion papers. Certainly, the next decade
will see an increase of the predictive power of the theory of stellar structure. Clearly, this will
enhance the status of this theory as one of the most important tools for understanding the origin
and evolution of our Universe.

Stellar Atmospheres
Abstract:
Basic concepts of the stellar atmospheres theory are briefly outlined. After dis-
cussing essential assumptions, approximations, and basic structural equations describing a
stellar atmospheres, emphasis is given to describing efficient numerical methods developed to
deal with the stellar atmosphere problem, namely the method of complete linearization and its
recent variants, and the whole class of methods known by name Accelerated Lambda Iteration.
The existing computer codes, and some of the most useful grids of model atmospheres that
are publicly available, are briefly summarized. Some interesting properties of newly computed
NLTE models atmospheres and their comparison to LTE models are shown. Finally, it is briefly
shown how the model atmospheres are used to determine basic stellar parameters.

Introduction
The term stellar atmosphere refers to any medium connected physically to a star from which
the photons escape to the surrounding space. In other words, it is a region where the radiation,
observable by a distant observer, originates. Since in the vast majority of cases the radiation is
the only information about a distant astronomical object that can be obtained (exceptions being
a direct detection of solar wind particles, neutrinos from the Sun and SN1987a, or gravitational
waves), all the information that is gathered about stars is derived from analysis oftheirradiation.
It is therefore of considerable importance to develop reliable methods which are able to
decode the information about a star contained in its spectrum with confidence. Having under-
stood the physics of the problem and being able to carry out detailed numerical simulations
makes it possible to construct theoretical models of a stellar atmosphere and predict a stellar
spectrum. Model stellar atmospheres are one of the building blocks of our understanding of the
radiating objects in the Universe. Modeling stellar atmospheres is one of the most mature fields
that deals with analysis and spectroscopic diagnostics of astronomical bodies. Being a mature
filed, one might not expect any significant new developments. But such a view is completely
wrong. The last decade brought a renewed interest in modeling stellar atmospheres. There are
several reasons for that. The first, more or less obvious, reason is a significantly increased quality
and quantity of observational data that bring new challenges for modelers. For instance, thanks
to Hipparcos, the accurate distances are now known for many stars, which means that the nor-
malization factor to convert the predicted fluxes at the stellar surface to observed fluxes at the
Earth is no longer a free parameter.
The last decade also brought an introduction, after almost a century, of completely new
stellar spectral types – L and T dwarfs (sometimes referred to as brown dwarfs; Burgasser et al.
1999; Delfosse et al. 1997). At present, there is a vigorous debate about the name for a spec-
troscopic class of objects cooler than the coolest T-dwarfs; likely candidate being “Y-dwarfs”,
essentially because there are not many more remaining letters of the alphabet available.
The second reason, or motivation, for a progress in modeling stellar atmospheres is an ever-
increasing computer power, both the memory available, as well as the computer speed. Conse-
quently, much more sophisticated model atmospheres of unprecedented degree of realism may
now be constructed in a reasonable amount of computer time.
However, even with most powerful computers and largest memory chips available, one
would still not be able to compute sophisticated models without employing clever and powerful
numerical methods. Therefore, the third basic reason for a recent progress in modeling stellar
atmospheres is a development of new, very efficient numerical methods for solving the highly
nonlinear and nonlocal problem, which the solution of the structural equations for stellar
atmosphere requires.

Besides being a crucial diagnostic tool for analyzing stellar spectra, the stellar atmospheres
theory provides a guide to the methodology of astrophysical quantitative spectroscopy. Stel-
lar atmospheres are the best-studied example of a medium where radiation is not only a
probe of the physical state, but is in fact an important constituent. In other words, radiation
in fact determines the structure of the medium, yet the medium is probed only by this radi-
ation. Unlike laboratory physics, where one can change a setup of the experiment in order
to examine various aspects of the studied structures separately, one does not have this lux-
ury in astrophysics: all what is available is an observed spectrum, so the information encoded
in it should be extracted as completely as possible. This is exactly what the stellar atmo-
sphere theory is doing for almost a century now. Consequently, it is developed to such an
extent that it provides an excellent methodological guide for other situations where the radi-
ation has the dual role of a probe and a constituent. Examples of such astronomical objects
are planetary atmospheres, interstellar medium, H II regions, and accretion disks, to name
just few.
The main goal of this chapter is to provide a brief introduction to the basic concepts
needed to understand the fundamental physics of stellar atmospheres, as well as the leading
principles behind recent developments. Particular emphasis will be devoted to the classi-
cal plane-parallel atmospheres in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium. Much more mate-
rial on stellar atmospheres is presented in several monographs and conference proceedings.
The fundamental textbook of the field, Mihalas (1978), is still a highly recommended text,
although it does not cover important recent developments, like, for instance, modern numer-
ical methods. The third edition of the book is now in preparation, but it will take some time
before it is available. There is a textbook by Rutten (1995), distributed electronically, which
covers both the basic concepts as well as some of the modern developments and is recom-
mended to the beginner in the field. There are two books edited by Kalkofen which present
a collection of reviews on various mathematical and numerical aspects of radiative transfer
(Kalkofen 1984, 1987). A good textbook that covers both the theoretical and observational
aspects of the stellar atmospheres is that by Gray (1992). Other related textbooks include
Rybicki and Lightman (1979), Shu (1991), and an elementary-level textbook by Böhm-Vitense
(1989). An old but excellent textbook on radiative transfer is Jefferies (1968), an even older
but classical one by Chandrasekhar (1960), and a newer book by Cannon (1985). There are
two excellent books on the topic of radiation hydrodynamics, which contain several chap-
ters related to the present topic, namely Mihalas and Mihalas (1984), and Castor (2004).
Besides these monographs, two recent Proceedings (Hubeny et al. 2003, 2009) contain a
number of excellent review papers covering various topics in theory and modeling of stellar
atmospheres.

Basic Physics of Stellar Atmospheres
From the physical point of view, a stellar atmosphere is generally a plasma composed of many
kinds of particles, namely atoms, ions, free electrons, molecules, or even dust grains. In an early-
type stellar atmospheres, because of the high temperature and strong radiation field, there are
typically no molecules nor dust grains present, at least in the layers that are traditionally consid-
ered as an atmosphere. Molecules are present in the atmospheres of solar-type stars and cooler,
and dust grains (cloud particles) are present in very cool stars and subsolar-mass objects (brown
dwarfs and giant planets).

Stellar Atmospheres
Typical values of temperature range from K (or even much less in atmospheres of plan-
ets and brown dwarfs; say down to 50 K) to a few times K in the hottest stars. Temperature
is even higher, –K, in stellar coronae. The total particle density ranges from, say, 
to cm−. Under such conditions, the natural starting point for the physical description is
the kinetic theory. The physical state of the system is then fully described by a set of kinetic
(Boltzmann) equation for the distribution functions, fi, of all kinds of particles that exist in
the atmosphere (generally, not only for the individual atoms, ions, free electrons, and possibly
molecules, but also for individual excitation states of the atoms/ions),
∂fi
∂t + (u ⋅∇) fi + (F ⋅∇p) fi = (Dfi
Dt )
coll
,
(2.1)
where ∇and ∇p are the usual nabla differential operators with respect to position and momen-
tum components, respectively; u is the particle velocity, and F is the external force. The term
(Df /Dt)coll is the so-called collisional term, which describes creations and destructions of
particles of type i with the position (r, r + dr) and momentum (p, p + dp).
However, the full distribution functions are usually not needed, and in any case the number
of unknowns to be determined would be enormous. The standard procedure to reduce the prob-
lem is to form moments of the kinetic equation that lead to the usual hydrodynamic equations.
The procedure is described in any textbook of kinetic theory or hydrodynamics; in the astro-
physical context, the excellent textbooks are Mihalas and Mihalas (1984) and Castor (2004).
The standard set of hydrodynamic equations are the continuity equation,
∂ρ
∂t + ∇⋅(ρv) = ,
(2.2)
the momentum equation,
∂(ρv)
∂t
+ ∇⋅(ρvv) = −∇P + f ,
(2.3)
and the energy balance equation,
∂
∂t ( 
ρv+ ρє) + ∇⋅[( 
ρv+ ρє + P)v] = f ⋅v −∇⋅(Frad + Fcon) .
(2.4)
Here, v is the macroscopic velocity, ρ the total mass density, P the pressure, f the external force,
є the internal energy, Frad the radiation flux, and Fcon the conductive flux. >Equations 2.2–2.4
represent moment equations of the kinetic equation (>2.1), summed over all kinds of particles.
In addition to classical hydrodynamics, one also considers a zeroth-order moment equation
for the individual kinds of particles in the individual degrees of freedom (excitation states), i.e.,
the conservation equation for particles of type i,
∂ni
∂t + ∇⋅(niv) = (Dni
Dt )
coll
,
(2.5)
which are used for the so-called non-LTE (or NLTE) description – see below. Here, ni is the
number density (population) of the state i.
These equations provide the most general description of the dynamics of a stellar atmo-
sphere. They are still extremely complex to solve in full generality; therefore, one has to resort
to various simplifying approximations, which are briefly discussed next.

2.1 Overview of Basic Equilibrium Conditions: Atmospheric Layers
Traditionally, a stellar atmosphere is divided into several basic layers, depending on what kind
of equilibrium conditions can be reasonably assumed to hold there. In the case of early-type
stars (early A-type and hotter), the two basic layers are the photosphere and the stellar wind.
In the case of solar-type stars and cooler, the layers are somewhat different. Typically, there is
again a photosphere, then chromosphere and corona, and finally a (typically week) wind.
The photosphere is the innermost part of the atmosphere. The mass outflow velocities are
very small there, smaller than the local sound speed, so that they can be neglected. The pho-
tosphere is assumed to be an essentially static region. The radial extent of the photosphere is
typically very small compared to the stellar radius, even for hot massive stars. This region is
very important because most of the observed spectral features originate there. Therefore, it
is fair to say that the photosphere is crucial for determining basic stellar parameters, such as
effective temperature, gravity acceleration, and chemical composition. Stellar photospheres are
characterized by the condition of hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium.
The hydrostatic equilibrium stipulates that the gradient of the total pressure is balanced by
the local gravity acceleration. Because the radial extent of the photosphere is small compared
to the stellar radius, the gravity acceleration is essentially constant. The explicit form of this
equation is (for a spherically-symmetric star):
dP
dR = −ρ GM∗/R≈−ρ GM∗/R
∗≡−ρ g ,
(2.6)
where P is the total pressure, R is the radial coordinate, M∗and R∗are the stellar mass and
radius, respectively, g is the gravity acceleration at the stellar surface, and ρ the mass density.
Notice that (> 2.6) follows from the general momentum equation (> 2.3) by setting ∂/∂t = 
(a stationary situation), v = (static case), and f = −ρg (external force being given by the grav-
ity force; the minus sign reflects the fact that the gravity acts inward, while the radial coordinate
increases outward).
The radiative equilibrium simply states that the total radiation flux is conserved. As follows
from the energy equation ( > 2.4), its reduction to the static case and neglecting conduction
leads to
∇Frad = 
⇒
Frad = const ≡σT
eff ,
(2.7)
where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and Teff is the so-called effective temperature.
As follows from (>2.6) and (>2.7), the gravity acceleration g and the effective temperature
Teff are two basic parameters of the stellar photosphere problem.
The atmospheres of cool stars (late A-type and cooler) contain regions that are unstable
against convection; the unstable regions are those that satisfy the Schwarzschild criterion, (e.g.,
Mihalas 1978),
∇R ≡(d ln T
d ln P )
R
> (d ln T
d ln P )
A
≡∇A ,
(2.8)
where ∇R is the logarithmic gradient of temperaturewith respect to the total pressure assuming
radiative equilibrium, while ∇A is the adiabatic gradient. The latter can be easily evaluated as a
function of temperature and density of the stellar material.
Convection is a transport of energy by rising and falling bubbles of material with properties
(e.g., temperature) different from the ambient medium. It is therefore, by its very nature, a non-
stationary and nonhomogeneous phenomenon. Putting v = and assuming a 1D medium

56 2
Stellar Atmospheres
means, strictly speaking, that convection is a priori neglected in the hydrodynamic equations.
However, most modeling approaches use simplified descriptions, such as the mixing-length
theory (see any standard textbook, e.g., Mihalas 1978), which recasts the problem in the form
of a 1D stationary equation, viz.
Frad + Fconv = σT
eff ,
(2.9)
where the convective flux Fconv is a specified function of basic state parameters (temperature,
density, etc.)
The stellar wind is the region where the outflow velocities are comparable or larger than
the local sound speed. The radial extent of this region may be comparable to or, in some cases,
significantly larger than, the radius of the stellar photosphere.
Stellar winds, as well as stellar chromospheres and coronae, are covered in another chapters.
This chapter concentrates mainly on the stellar photospheres.
2.2 Interaction of Radiation with Matter
From the very nature of stellar atmospheres, it is clear that a detailed description of the processes
of interaction between radiation and matter is a crucial ingredient of the stellar atmospheres
theory. These processes determine (1) how the radiation is transported in the atmosphere and
(2) what is the distribution of the microscopic degrees of freedom of the massive particles (e.g.,
the excitation and ionization states of the individual atomic species, etc.).
The interaction between radiation and matter is described through the radiative transfer
equation, which is generally written as
( 
c
∂
∂t + n ⋅∇) I(ν, r, n, t) = η(ν, r, n, t) −χ(ν, r, n, t) I(ν, r, n, t) .
(2.10)
Here, I is the specific intensity of radiation, defined such that it is the energy transported by
radiation in a unit frequency range at the frequency ν, across a unit area perpendicular to the
direction of propagation, n, into a unit solid angle, and in a unit time interval. The specific
intensity provides a complete description of the unpolarized radiation field from the macro-
scopic point of view. This description can be generalized to an arbitrarily polarized light by
introducing the Stokes vector instead of the scalar intensity (e.g., Chandrasekhar 1960). This
case will not be considered here.
Quantities χ and η are the absorption and emission coefficients, respectively. They are
defined analogously to the specific intensity, namely as the energy removed or added to a beam
of radiation at unit frequency range, solid angle, area, and time.
It is known from the quantum theory of radiation that there are three types of elementary
processes that give rise to an absorption or emission of a photon: (1) induced absorption – an
absorption of a photon accompanied by a transition of an atom/ion to a higher energy state;
(2) spontaneous emission – an emission of a photon accompanied by a spontaneous transi-
tion of an atom/ion to a lower energy state; and (3) stimulated emission – an interaction of an
atom/ion with a photon accompanied by an emission of another photon with identical prop-
erties. In the astrophysical formalism, the stimulated emission is usually treated as negative
absorption.
In thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic detailed balance holds, and therefore the
radiation energy absorbed in an elementary volume in an elementary frequency interval is

Stellar Atmospheres 2
57
exactly balanced by the energy emitted in the same volume and in the same frequency range,
i.e., χ I = η. Moreover, in thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation intensity is equal to the
Planck function, I = B, where
B(ν, T) = hν
c

exp(hν/kT) −.
(2.11)
In thermodynamic equilibrium, one has, therefore, η/χ = B, which is called the Kirchhoff’s law.
The absorption coefficient (or opacity) is given by
χν = κν + σν ,
(2.12)
where κν is the coefficient of true absorption (or extinction coefficient) and σν is the scattering
coefficient. The extinction coefficient is given by
κν = ∑
i
∑
j>i
[ni −(gi/g j)n j] σi j(ν) + ∑
i
(ni −n∗
i e−hν/kT) σiκ(ν)
+ ∑
κ
nenκσκκ(ν, T) (−e−hν/kT) ,
(2.13)
where the three terms represent, respectively, the contributions of bound-bound transitions
(i.e., spectral lines), bound-free transitions (continua), and free-free absorption (also called
brehmstrahlung).
Here, ni is the occupation number (population) of an atom in the energy level labeled i,
gi the corresponding statistical weight, and n∗
i denotes an equilibrium population of level i
corresponding to temperature T, and electron density ne. σ(ν) are the corresponding cross
sections; subscript κ denotes the “continuum,” and nκ the ion number density. The nega-
tive contributions represent the stimulated emission. The relation between the bound-bound
cross section σi j(ν) and the well-known Einstein coefficients for the for the photoexcitation is
σi j(ν) = (hν/π)Bi jϕ(ν), where νis the frequency of the line center, and ϕ(ν) the absorption
profile coefficient, normalized to unity, ∫ϕ(ν) dν = . It represents the conditional probability
density that if a photon is absorbed in the transition i →j, it is absorbed in the frequency range
(ν, ν + dν).
In hot stars, a photon scattering on free electrons – electron scattering, is the dominant
scattering process. Moreover, it is to a good approximation coherent, i.e., without a change of
frequency – Thomson scattering. In this case,
σν = neσe ,
(2.14)
where σe is the Thomson cross section. A more general, incoherent case is called Compton
scattering. The effects of Compton scattering are negligible in the atmospheres of most stars,
with a possible exception of extremely hot subdwarfs, white dwarfs, and pre-white dwarfs. For
cooler stars, the Rayliegh scattering becomes important, and for very cool objects (M dwarfs
and substellar mass-objects) where clouds are formed, the Mie scattering on clouds particles is
important. There is no stimulated emission correction for the coherent scattering, because this
contribution exactly cancels with ordinary absorption.
The absorption coefficient defined by (> 2.13) has the dimension cm−, and its inverse has
a meaning of the photon mean free path. This coefficient is also called opacity per length, in
contrast to opacity per mass which is defined as χν/ρ. The advantage of the latter is that it is
typically much less dependent on mass density, because the atomic level populations and the
electron density roughly scale with mass density, so that these dependencies almost cancel.

58 2
Stellar Atmospheres
Analogously, the emission coefficient is given by
ην = ηth
ν + ηscat
ν
,
(2.15)
where the thermal emission coefficient is given by
ηth
ν = (hν/c) [∑
i
∑
j>i
n j(gi/g j)σi j(ν) + ∑
i
n∗
i σiκ(ν) e−hν/kT
+ ∑
κ
nenκσκκ(ν, T) e−hν/kT ] .
(2.16)
The three terms again describe the bound-bound, bound-free, and free-free emission processes,
respectively.
The scattering part of the emission coefficient is more complex. Generally, it is given by
ηscat
ν
(n) = ∫dν′ ∮dΩ′/(π) R(ν′, n′, ν, n) I(ν′, n′) ,
(2.17)
where R(ν′, n′, ν, n) is the redistribution function that represents a probability density that a
photon in the frequency range (ν′, ν′ +dν′) and in an element of solid angle dΩ′ around direc-
tion n′ is absorbed, and a photon in the frequency range (ν, ν + dν) and in an element of solid
angle dΩ around direction n is emitted in the scattering process. The redistribution function is
usually assumed to be separable into the frequency and the angular part,
R(ν′, n′, ν, n) = R(ν′, ν) g(n′, n) ,
(2.18)
where R(ν′, ν) is called frequency redistribution function, and g the phase function. In the case
of electron (Thomson) scattering, R(ν′, ν) = neσeδ(ν′ −ν), and assuming isotropic scattering,
g(n′, n) = , the scattering emission coefficient is simply given by
ηscat
ν
= neσeJν ,
(2.19)
where J is the mean intensity of radiation – see (> 2.29).
The absorption and emission coefficients are thus described through the corresponding
cross sections, given by the atomic physics, the local thermodynamic parameters, T and ne,
and the atomic level populations for all the levels involved in the microscopic processes that
give rise to an absorption and emission at frequency ν; such a number may be enormous. The
scattering emission coefficient moreover depends explicitly the radiation field. Besides that, the
main difficulty of the stellar atmospheres theory is that the level populations generally depend
(in a NLTE situation) on other state parameters and the radiation field.
It should also be realized that the number of cross sections and other parameters to be sup-
plied by atomic physics is enormous. In fact, once efficient numerical methods for solving the
coupled problem of radiation transport and hydrodynamics are developed, the main limiting
factor in producing realistic model stellar atmospheres is the availability of necessary atomic
data. The most popular large-scale source of data for bound-bound transitions, lines, are the
Kurucz line lists (Kurucz 1993; the latest additions described in Kurucz 2009). In the last two
decades, two major collaborative projects – Opacity Project (OP – OP Team 1995, 1997; Seaton
1987) and its continuation the Iron Project (Hummer et al. 1993; Pradhan et al. 1996), and
the OPAL Project (Iglesias and Rogers 1991, 1996) – have produced accurate atomic data on a
large scale. There have also been a significant progress on the molecular data; for a review, see
Jørgensen (2003) and Sharp and Burrows (2007).

2.3 LTE Versus Non-LTE
It is well known from statistical physics that a description of material properties is greatly
simplified if the thermodynamic equilibrium (TE) holds. In this state, the particle velocity
distributions as well as the distributions of atoms over excitation and ionization states are
specified uniquely by two thermodynamic variables. In the stellar atmospheres context, these
variables are usually chosen to be the (kinetic) temperature (T), and the total particle number
density (N), or the electron number density (ne). From the very nature of a stellar atmosphere,
it is clear that it cannot be in thermodynamic equilibrium – a star is detectable by a distant
observer, so photons must be escaping from it. Because photons carry significant momentum
and energy, the elementary fact of photon escape has to give rise to significant gradients of the
state parameters in the stellar outer layers.
However, even if the assumption of TE cannot be applied to a stellar atmosphere, one may
still use the concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium – LTE. This assumption stipulates that
one may employ the standard thermodynamic relations not globally for the whole atmosphere,
but locally, for local values of T(r) and N(r) or ne(r), despite the gradients that exist in the
atmosphere. This assumption simplifies the problem enormously, for it implies that all the par-
ticle distribution functions may be evaluated locally without reference to the physical ensemble
in which the given material is found. Notice that the equilibrium values ofdistribution functions
are assigned to massive particles; the radiation field is allowed to depart from its equilibrium,
Planckian, distribution function (i.e., I = B is valid only in strict TE).
Specifically, LTE is characterized by the following three distributions:
–
Maxwellian velocity distribution of particles
f (v)dv = (m/πkT)/exp(−mv/kT) dv ,
(2.20)
where m is the particle mass and k the Boltzmann constant.
–
Boltzmann excitation equation,
(n j/ni) = (g j/gi) exp[−(E j −Ei)/kT] ,
(2.21)
where gi is the statistical weight of level i, and Ei the level energy, measured from the ground
state.
–
Saha ionization equation.
NI
NI+
= ne UI
UI+
C T−/exp(χI/kT) ,
(2.22)
where NI is the total number density of ionization stage I, U is the partition function,
defined by U = ∑∞
gi exp(−Ei/kT); χI is the ionization potential of ion I, and C =
(h/πmk)/is a constant. It should be stressed that in the astrophysical LTE description,
the same temperature T applies to all kinds of particles, and to all kinds of distributions,
(> 2.20–2.22).
>Equations 2.20–2.22 define the state of LTE from the macroscopic point of view. Microscop-
ically, LTE holds if all atomic processes are in detailed balance, i.e., if the number of processes
A →B is exactly balanced by the number of inverse processes B →A. A and B refer to any
particle states between which there exists a physically possible transition. For instance, A is an
atom in an excited state, and B the same atom in another state (either of the same ion, in which

60 2
Stellar Atmospheres
case the process is an excitation/de-excitation; or of the higher or lower ion, in which case the
term is an ionization/recombination).
In contrast, the term non-LTE (or NLTE) characterizes any state that departs from LTE. In
practice, this usually means that populations of some selected energy levels of some selected
atoms/ions are allowed to depart from their LTE values, while the velocity distributions of all
particles are assumed to be Maxwellian, all at the same local kinetic temperature, T.
In this case, the number densities (populations) of all energy levels of all atoms and ions
that are important in the atmosphere have to be determined. Equations that describe how the
level populations behave are the statistical equilibrium equations (or rate equations), which are
( > 2.5) reduced to a static case, (Dni/Dt)coll = . More explicitly, they express the fact that
under stationary situation, the total number of transitions into a given level i is equal to the total
number of transitions out of level i,
ni ∑
j≠i
(Ri j + Ci j) = ∑
j≠i
n j (R ji + C ji) ,

where Ri j and Ci j are the radiative and collisional rates, respectively, for the transition from
level i to level j. The left-hand side of (> 2.23) represents the total number of transitions out of
level i, while the right-hand side represents the total number of transitions into level i from all
other levels.
One of the important issues of the stellar atmospheres theory for the last three decades was
whether, and if so to what extent, departures from LTE should be included in numerical model-
ing. Generally, to understand why and where one may expect departures from LTE, it is best to
turn to the microscopic definition of LTE. It is clear that LTE breaks down if the detailed balance
in at least one transition A →B breaks down. There are two types of transitions: the collisional
transitions (arising due to interactions between two or more massive particles) and radiative
transitions (interactions involving particles and photons). Understellaratmosphericconditions,
collisions between massive particles tend to maintain the local equilibrium (because velocities
are Maxwellian). Therefore, the validity of LTE hinges on whether the radiative transitions are
in detailed balance or not.
The fact that the radiation escapes from a star implies that LTE should eventually break
down at a certain point in the atmosphere. Essentially, this is because detailed balance in radia-
tive transitions generally breaks down at a certain point near the surface. Because photons
escape (and more so from the uppermost layers), there must be a lack of them there. Con-
sequently, the number of photoexcitations (or any atomic transition induced by absorbing a
photon) is less than a numberof inverse processes, spontaneous de-excitations (neglecting here,
for simplicity, the stimulated emission).
These considerations explain that departures from LTE are expected if the following
two conditions are met: (1) radiative rates in some important atomic transition dominate
over the collisional rates; and (2) radiation is not in equilibrium, i.e., the intensity does not have
the Planckian distribution. Because the collisional rates are proportional to the particle density,
the departures from LTE tend to be small for high densities. Likewise, deep in the atmosphere,
photons do not escape, and so the intensity is close to the equilibrium value. Departures from
LTE are therefore small, even if the radiative rates dominate over the collisional rates. On the
other hand, departures from LTE are important for low-density media immersed in a strong
radiation field, which are precisely the conditions met in the atmospheres of hot stars.

Model Atmospheres
Model stellar atmospheres are basic tools to analyze observed stellar spectra. By fitting the
observed spectrum by a grid of theoretically predicted spectra, one can derive the basic param-
eters used for constructing the models, i.e., the effective temperature, surface gravity, chemical
composition, and, in the general case, the mass loss rate. From those parameters, one can derive
the fundamental stellar parameters, like the mass, radius, and luminosity. Besides these, there
are a number of secondary parameters, such as the rotational velocity, or auxiliary parameters
describing the nature of atmospheric velocity fields, etc.
By the term model stellar atmosphere, it is understood a specification of all the atmospheric
state parameters as functions of position. These parameters are obtained by solving appropri-
ate structural equations, which, in the case of stellar photospheric models, are the equations of
hydrostatic equilibrium, radiative equilibrium, radiative transfer equation, and the set of statis-
tical equations (rate equations) for the atomic level populations. In the case of LTE models, the
rate equations are not needed because the level populations are given by the Saha–Boltzmann
distribution. Because the problem is very complex, it is impossible to find analytical solutions.
Therefore, one has to resort to numerical simulations. In order to make the overall problem
tractable, it is necessary to make a number of simplifications by invoking various approxima-
tions. The quality of an appropriate model, and consequently its applicability to the individual
stellar types, is closely related to the degree of approximation used in the construction of the
model. Needless to say, the degree of approximation critically influences the amount of com-
putational effort to compute it. It is fair to say that the very art of computing model stellar
atmospheres is to find such physical approximations that allow the model to be computed with
a reasonable amount of numerical work, yet the model is sufficiently realistic to allow its use for
a reliable interpretation of observed stellar data. The adopted approximations are therefore criti-
cal. There are several types of approximations that are typically madein the model construction,
which are summarized below.
3.1 Hierarchy of Approximations
3.1.1 Approximations of the Geometry
What is meant by the geometrical simplification is that either some prescribed geometrical con-
figuration is assumed or some special kind of overall symmetry is invoked. The goal of those
simplifications is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem from a spatially 3D problem to
1- or 2D problem. The most popular approximations are (from simplest to more complex):
–
Plane-parallel geometry, with an assumption of horizontally homogeneous layers. This
decreases the number of dimensions to one: the depth in the atmosphere. This approxima-
tion is typically quite reasonable for stellar photospheres, which indeed are by several orders
of magnitude thinner than the stellar radius, so the curvature effects are negligible. The
assumption of horizontal homogeneity is madefor the sake of simplicity – there is no plausi-
ble verification of this approximation, and, moreover, observational evidence mostly shows
that stellar surfaces are far from being homogeneous (a notorious example being detailed
pictures of the solar surface). Nevertheless, even in the presence of inhomogeneities,

62 2
Stellar Atmospheres
1D modelsstill have their value since, in many cases, one may construct different 1D models
for the individual “patches” on the surface.
–
Spherical symmetry. Again, the problem is one-dimensional. The approach is used for
extended atmospheres, for which the atmospheric thickness is no longer negligible with
respect to the stellar radius. Typically, one has to consider such models for giants and
supergiants, as well as for earliest types of main-sequence O stars.
–
Multidimensional geometry. This field is at its infancy. A numerical solution is extremely
demanding on computer time and memory, and only very recently has the computer power
reached a stage that calculating such models is becoming feasible. Model atmospheres with a
2D and 3D geometry have been constructed for solar-type atmospheres; for a recent review,
see Carlsson and Stein (2003), Stein and Nordlund (2003), and Nordlund and Stein (2009).
3.1.2 Approximations of the Presence of External Forces
In a typical stellar atmospheres, the only external force that is taken into account is the force of
gravity of the star, and its effect (in the case of a photosphere) is described through the hydro-
static equilibrium (> 2.6). Other forces are sometimes taken into account, depending above all
on the nature of the studied object.
–
Centrifugal force. If the star rotates very fast, close to breakup rotation rate, the whole
star becomes distorted. A star is still assumed to be cylindrically symmetric, but the over-
all atmosphere is no longer described by a single model, but instead it is assumed to be
composed of a set of latitudinal belts, each described by a unique model atmosphere. This
approach implicitly assumesthat the physical properties of the atmosphere vary much faster
in the vertical direction (toward the stellar center) than in the horizontal direction. This is
usually an excellent approximation. The centrifugal force thus does not enter the model con-
struction directly, but only indirectly through the need of constructing several models for a
stellar atmosphere instead of one.
–
Magnetic force. Some objects (magnetic Ap stars, magnetic white dwarfs, neutron stars)
possess a strong magnetic field, which needs to be taken into account in model construction.
This topic will not be discussed in this chapter.
3.1.3 Approximations of the Dynamical State of the Atmosphere
This is basically a specification of the realism of the treatment of the macroscopic velocity fields.
From the simplest to the most complex, the approaches are the following:
–
Static models, in which the macroscopic velocity field is set to zero. As discussed above,
these models describe a stellar photosphere.
–
Models with an a priori-given velocity field. In these models, the velocities are taken into
account explicitly, and their influence upon other state parameters, in particular the emer-
gent radiation, is studied in detail. In these models,one can either consider only a dynamical
region (i.e., the wind) and take an incoming radiation from the photosphere as given a pri-
ori – the so-called core-halo model; or a model which treats the photosphere and the wind
on the same footing. Such models are called unified models. The most successful computer

Stellar Atmospheres 2
63
programs for computing such models are cmfgen (Hillier 2003; Hillier and Miller 1998),
Hoeflich’s suite of programs (Hoeflich 1995, 2003), phoenix (Hauschildt et al. 1997),
Munich codes (fastwind – Santolaya-Rey et al. 1997; wm-basics – Pauldrach et al. 2001),
and the Kiel-Potsdam code (Hamann 1985; Koesterke et al. 2002).
–
Models where the velocity field is determined self-consistently by solving the appropriate
hydrodynamical equations. This problem is verycomplicated because the wind driving force
is given by the absorption of photons in thousands to millions of metal lines, so the hydro-
dynamical equations should be solved together with at least an approximate treatment of
radiative transfer in spectral lines.
3.1.4 Approximations of the Opacity Sources
In real stellar atmospheres, there is an enormous number of opacity sources. It is essentially
impossible (or, at least, impractical) to take all of them into account in full detail. The light
elements (H, He, C, N, O) have comparatively a small number of lines per ion (say –)
because of a relatively simple atomic level structure. The number of lines generally increases
with increasing atomic number, and for the iron-peak elements (Fe and Ni being the most
important ones), there are of the order of –spectral lines per ion! Therefore, the opacity
(and emissivity) may be an enormously complicated function of frequency. For cool stars, the
problem is even worse because the number of molecular lines is even larger (for instance, water
has of the order of lines that should be taken into account).
There are several approximations that are meant to reduce this complexity considerably:
–
Models constructed using certain frequency-averaged opacities; these models are called
grey models. The approach is based on the implicit assumption that the behavior of the
frequency-averaged intensity of radiation is well described by means of some frequency-
averaged opacities. There are several possible mean opacities, depending on how exactly the
averaging is done. The most used averaged opacity is the Rosseland mean opacity, defined
by

χR
≡∫
∞
(/χν)(dBν/dT) dν
∫
∞
(dBν/dT) dν
,
(2.24)
where χν is the opacity (per gram of stellar material). Because averaging is done for /χ, the
largest weight is given to regions of lowest opacity, which are the most efficient regions for
the energy flux transport. This explains why the Rosseland mean opacity is well suited for
describing the total radiation flux, and why it is the most appropriate mean opacity to be
used for modeling stellar interiors.
The grey model atmospheres are no longer used for spectroscopic analysis, but they
are useful for providing an initial estimate in any iterative method for constructing more
realistic model atmospheres, and they are very useful for pedagogical purposes becausethey
allow one to understand a rough behavior of temperature and radiation field as a function
of depth in the atmosphere.
–
A possibility is to use stepwise frequency averages for a number of subintervals (frequency
bins), called sometimes multifrequency/multi-grey method. This approach was used in con-
structing model stellar atmospheres only rarely (Anderson 1985, 1987, 1989) but is more
used in other branches of astrophysical and laboratory radiative transfer.

64 2
Stellar Atmospheres
–
A completely different approach is to construct a model atmosphere neglecting the line
opacity completely. Although this may seem very crude, such models may actually provide
reasonable results for very metal-poor stars because, as was pointed put above, H and He
posses only a small number of lines, which occupy only a very small frequency range and
therefore have a small influence on the model structure. (Strictly speaking, this is not
completely true because just three of the most important hydrogen lines – Lα, Lβ, and
Hα – may already have an important indirect effect upon the temperature structure in
the outer layers of early-type photospheres (Auer and Mihalas 1969). In any event, this
approximation was introduced at the early stages of development of the non-LTE model
atmospheres and was motivated by limitations of then available computers and numerical
techniques.
–
An obvious next level of approximation is to consider a small number of lines (typically tens
to hundreds) explicitly while neglecting the bulk of metal lines; the selected lines are those
which presumably have the largest effect upon the atmospheric structure. This approach
was used in early days of NLTE model atmospheres (Auer and Mihalas 1969).
–
Finally, one can take into account, by one way or another, “all” metal lines. Such models are
traditionally called metal line–blanketed model atmospheres. The problem of constructing
such models is computationally very demanding. Under the assumption of LTE, it is, how-
ever, considerably simplified because the opacity and emissivity is a function of only local
temperature and electron density; the only problem is the complicated frequency depen-
dence of the opacity. Without the approximation of LTE, the problem is significantly more
difficult because one has to determine all the atomic level populations and temperature
self-consistently with the radiation field.
There are essentially two possibilities:
•
Opacity Distribution Functions (ODF). In LTE, the use of ODFs is straightforward (Kurucz
1970). In NLTE, this method is used in conjunction with the concept of superlevels.A super-
level is a set of individual energy levels with close energies, and with identical or similar
quantum numbers (e.g., the same spin quantum number S, the same parity) that share the
common NLTE departure coefficient, that is, they are in Boltzman equilibrium within each
other (Anderson 1985). Transitions between superlevels are called superlines. The idea is
to resample a complicated frequency dependence of the superline cross section to form a
monotonic function of frequency; this function is then represented by a smaller number of
frequency quadrature points (Anderson 1989; Dreizler and Werner 1993; Hubeny and Lanz
1995).
•
Opacity Sampling (OS). The idea is a simple Monte Carlo-like sampling of frequency points
of the superline cross sections (Anderson 1989; Dreizler and Werner 1993). The advantage
of this approach is that it can easily treat line blends and overlaps; the disadvantage is that
considering too few frequency points may easily lead to missing many important line cores.
On the other hand, the “exact” method is in fact a variant of the OS with a sufficiently high
frequency resolution.
An explicit comparison between results using the ODF and the OS approaches, and with
various frequency resolutions in the latter, is presented, e.g., in Lanz and Hubeny (2003). With
increasing computational power, both memory and speed, the Opacity Sampling scheme with
high–frequency resolution becomes the method of choice.

3.1.5 Approximations Concerning the Thermodynamic Equilibria
As was discussed above, the issue here is whether the approximation of LTE is adopted or not.
If one assumesLTE, the resulting model atmospheres are called LTE models. Two state parame-
ters, the temperature, T, and density, ρ (or electron density, ne), suffice to describe the physical
state of the atmosphere at any given position. In practice, LTE models may be useful only for
stellar photospheres because for extended atmospheres and/or stellar winds, this approximation
breaks down completely and its application would yield erroneous and misleading results.
The models that take some kind of departure from LTE into account are called non-LTE
(or NLTE) models. This term is rather ambiguous because it is not a priori specified what is
actually allowed to depart from LTE in a given model. In early models, the populations of
only few low-lying energy levels of the most abundant species, like H and He, were allowed
to depart from LTE; the rest were treated in LTE. During the development of the field, progres-
sively more and more levels were allowed to depart from LTE. The situation is similar for stellar
photospheres (static models), as well as for stellar winds and for unified models.
3.2 Basic Equations of Classical Stellar Atmospheres
The basic equations of stellar atmospheres for the case of horizontally-homogeneous, plane-
parallel, static atmospheres, that is, stellar photospheres) are summarized below.
3.2.1 Radiative Transfer Equation
For a 1D, static, planar atmosphere, the general transfer (>2.10) can be considerably simplified
to read
μ dI(ν, μ, z)
dz
= η(ν, μ, z) −I(ν, μ, z) χ(ν, μ, z) ,
(2.25)
where the intensity of radiation is now only a function of the geometrical coordinate z, fre-
quency ν, and the directional cosine μ. Here, μ = cos θ, where θ is the angle between the
direction of photon propagation and the normal to the surface. Defining the optical depth
through
dτν = −χνdz ,
(2.26)
and the source function as
Sν = ην/χν ,
(2.27)
(the functional dependence of position and direction was omitted for notational simplic-
ity, and a dependence on frequency is expressed through subscript ν which is customary in
astrophysical literature), the transfer is rewritten to a usual form
μ dIν
dτν
= Iν −Sν .
(2.28)
It is customary to introduce moments of the specific intensity as

(2.29)

Stellar Atmospheres
where the last term corresponds to the 1D plane-parallel approximation. In this case, the only
nonvanishing component of vector H is the Hz-component, which is written simply as H; anal-
ogously the only nonvanishing component of tensor K is the Kzz-component, denoted as K.
The moment equations of the radiative transfer equation, in a plane-parallel approximation,
are written as
dHν
dτν
= Jν −Sν ,
(2.30)
and
dKν
dτν
= Hν .
(2.31)
The system of moment equations is not closed, i.e., the equation for n-th moment contains
the (n + )-th moment, etc. It is therefore necessary to come up with some kind of closure
relation. In the stellar atmospheres theory, one defines the Eddington factor, f K, by (Auer and
Mihalas 1970)
f K
ν ≡Kν/Jν .
(2.32)
It is clear from the definition of moments that in the case of isotropic radiation, Iν(μ) = Iν
being independent of angle, the Eddington factor f K = /. Assuming the Eddington factor to
be specified, one may combine the two moment (> 2.30) and (> 2.31) together,
d(f K
ν Jν)
dτν
= Jν −Sν .
(2.33)
This equation is very useful. It effectively eliminatesone independent variable, the angle μ, from
the problem. Numerically, it replaces the original transfer equation, which is a first-order linear
differential equation for the specific intensity, Iνμ, by a second-order but still linear differential
equation for the mean intensity, Jν. However, it cannot be used alone because the Eddington
factor is unknown unless the full solution of the transfer equation is known. However, it can
be used to advantage in iterative methods in which the current values of J and K are used to
determine the current Eddington factor f K, which is then kept fixed during the subsequent
iteration step. This form is usually used in constructing model stellar atmospheres.
3.2.2 Hydrostatic Equilibrium Equation
Recalling (> 2.6), this equation reads
dP
dz = −ρ g ,
(2.34)
where P is the total pressure. Introducing the Lagrangian mass m, defined as the mass in the
column of a cross section of 1 cmabove a given point in the atmosphere,
dm = −ρ dz ,
(2.35)
the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is rewritten as
dP
dm = g ,
(2.36)
which, since g is constant in a plane-parallel atmosphere, has a trivial solution, P(m) = mg +
P(). In fact, this is the reason why one usually chooses m as the basic depth variable of the

Stellar Atmospheres 2
67
1D plane-parallel atmospheres problem. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the total
pressure is generally composed of three pars, the gas pressure, Pgas, the radiation pressure, Prad,
and the turbulent pressure, Pturb, i.e.,
P = Pgas + Prad + Pturb = NkT + π
c ∫



(2.37)
where vturb is the microturbulent velocity. The hydrostatic equilibrium equation may then be
written as (neglecting the turbulent pressure)

dm = g −π

(2.38)
The right-hand side of this equation can be interpreted as the effective gravity acceleration since
it expresses the action of the true gravity acceleration (acting downward, i.e., toward the center
of the star), reduced by the radiative acceleration (acting outward).
3.2.3 Radiative Equilibrium Equation
This expresses the fact that the total radiation flux is conserved – (> 2.7),

This equation may be rewritten, using the radiative transfer equation, as

(2.40)
Notice that ( > 2.40) contains the thermal absorption coefficient κν, not the total absorption
coefficient χν. This is because the scattering contributions cancel out. To illustrate this mathe-
matically, let us take an example of electron scattering. The absorption coefficient for the process
(see > 2.13) is given by neσe; σe being the electron scattering (Thomson) cross section. The
emission coefficient is then given by neσeJν. As it is seen from ( > 2.40), these two contri-
butions cancel. This is also clear physically because an absorption followed immediately be a
reemission of a photon does not change the energy balance of the medium, and therefore can-
not contribute to the radiative equilibrium equation. The situation is different for noncoherent,
Compton, scattering. This case will not be discussed here; the interested reader is referred to
Rybicki and Lightman (1979).
3.2.4 Statistical Equilibrium Equations
They are also sometimes called the rate equations. These are given by (> 2.23),

(2.41)
The collisional rates are given functions of temperature and electron density (since colli-
sions with electrons are usually most efficient), assumed to be known from atomic physics
(e.g., Mihalas 1978). The radiative rates are given by:

R ji = A ji + B ji ∫

Jνψ ji(ν) dν →A ji + B ji ¯Ji j ,
(2.43)
where Aand B are the Einstein coefficients. Quantity ¯J is called the frequency-averagedmean
intensity of radiation. ϕi j(ν) is a normalized line profile coefficient for absorption, often called
shortly “absorption profile”. It represents a probability density that if a photon is absorbed in
the transition i →j, it is absorbed at an elementary frequency range (ν, ν+dν). Analogously,
ψ ji is the profile coefficient for emission, which is generally different form ϕ. However, if one
assumes complete frequency redistribution, which is a common approximation in the stellar
atmospheres theory, both profiles are equal, ϕi j(ν) = ψ ji(ν). In other words, absorbed
and reemitted photons are not correlated. A more general situation where the correlation
between an absorbed and an emitted photon is taken into account is usually referred to in
astrophysical literature as partial frequency redistribution. This case will not be considered
here; a review can be found, e.g., in Mihalas (1978), Hubeny (1985), and Uitenbroek (2003).
The last part of (>2.43) corresponds to the complete redistribution.
In the case of a pure Doppler profile, i.e., no intrinsic broadening of the spectral line,
which is broadened only due to the thermal motion of radiators, the absorption profile is
given by
ϕ(x) = exp(−x)/√π .
(2.44)
where x is a dimensionless frequency displacement from the line center, ν, measured in
unites of Doppler widths,
x ≡ν −ν
ΔνD
,
(2.45)
where ΔνD is the Doppler width, given by ΔνD = (ν/c)vth, with the thermal velocity
vth = (kT/m)/, m being the mass of the radiating atom.
In a more general case where there is an intrinsic broadening of lines described by a
Lorentz profile in the atomic rest frame (the most common types of intrinsic broadening
being the natural, Stark, and Van der Waals broadening – see Mihalas 1978, or monograph
by Griem 1974), the profile function is given by
ϕ(x) = H(a, x)/√π ,
(2.46)
where H(a, x) is the Voigt function,
H(a, x) = a
π ∫
∞
−∞
e−y
(x −y)+ ady .
(2.47)
The Voigt function is a convolution of the Doppler profile (i.e., the thermal motions) and the
Lorentz profile (intrinsic broadening). The parameter a is a damping parameter expressed
in units of Doppler width, a = Γ/(πΔνD), where Γ is the atomic damping parameter. For
instance, for the natural broadening of a line originating in a two-level atom, Γ = A.

Ri j = π ∫
∞
ν
σi j(ν)/(hν)Jν dν ,
(2.48)
where σ(ν) is the corresponding cross section, supplied again by the atomic physics.
The set of rate equations for all levels of an atom would form a linearly dependent system.
Therefore, one equation of the set has to be replaced by another equation. Usually, this is
the total number conservation equation (or abundance definition equation), ∑i ni = Natom,
where the summation extends over all levels of all ions of a given species.
3.2.5 Charge Conservation Equation
This equation expresses the global electric neutrality of the medium,
∑
i
niZi −ne = ,
(2.49)
where Zi is the charge associated with level i (i.e., equal to for levels of neutral atoms, for
levels for once ionized ions, etc.). The summation now extends over all levels of all ions of all
species.
3.3 Numerical Methods
The resulting set forms a highly coupled, highly nonlinear system of equations. Even in a
classical case of plane-parallel, horizontally homogeneous, static atmospheres, this presents a
considerable numerical challenge. The basic numerical strategies are described below.
3.3.1 Complete Linearization
The physical state of a 1D plane-parallel, horizontally-homogeneous atmosphere in hydrostatic
and radiative (or radiative + convective) equilibria is fully described by the set of vectors ψd
for every depth point, d, d = , . . . , ND, ND being the number of discretized depth points. The
state vector ψd is given by
ψd ≡{J, . . . , JNF, N, T, ne, n, . . ., nNL} ,
(2.50)
where Ji is the mean intensity of radiation in the i-th frequency point, N the total particle
number density, ne the electron density, and ni the atomic level populations. The structural
equations are discretized, and the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved by
linearization, i.e., by an application of the Newton–Raphson method. This approach was first
used in the context of stellar atmosphere models in a seminal paper by Auer and Mihalas (1969),
who coined the term Complete Linearization (CL).
Writing the complete set of equations schematically as P(x) = , where x is a vector
composed of all state vectors ψd at all depths, the iteration scheme is written as
δx(n) ≡x(n+) −x(n) = −J (x(n))
−P(x(n)) ,
(2.51)

70 2
Stellar Atmospheres
where J is the Jacobi matrix (Jacobian), Ji j = ∂Pi/∂x j, i.e., the ij-element of the Jacobian is the
derivative of the i-th equation with respect to the j-th unknown. Since the system ( > 2.51)
represents a finite difference solution of at most second-order differential equations, the Jaco-
bian J has a particularly simple structure, namely a block-tridiagonal form, and ( > 2.51)
reduces to,
−Adδψd−+ Bd δψd −Cdδψd+= Ld .
(2.52)
Here A, B, C are NN × NN matrices, and Ld = Pd (x(n)) is the residuum vector (of dimension
NN) at depth d; the total number of unknown per depth is given by NN = NF + NL + NC; NC
is the number of constraint equations, in this case NC = .
>Equation 2.52 is solved as a block-tridiagonal system, which means that one is left with
inverting one NN ×NN matrix per depth point. Therefore, the total computer time for ordinary
complete linearization scales roughly as
t ∝(NF + NL + NC)× ND × Niter ,
(2.53)
where Niter is the number of iterations needed to obtain a converged solution, defined through
a suitably selected convergence criterion. It is immediately clear that the original complete lin-
earization, despite its inherent power and robustness, cannot be used as a general numerical
scheme because in realistic calculations, one needs a very large number of frequency points NF
to describe the radiation field with a sufficient accuracy – of the order of –points. Like-
wise, a number of energy levels NL may also be quite large (–levels). Therefore, one has
to seek less global, but faster schemes. The basic options are (1) reducing the size of the prob-
lem keeping the general framework of CL intact, (2) avoiding repeated inversions of a Jacobian
(examples are the Broyden scheme implemented in this context by Koesterke et al. 1992; or Kan-
torovich scheme – Hubeny and Lanz 1992), or (3) using an idea of the so-called approximate
Newton–Raphson method (e.g., Hillier 1990; Hillier and Miller 1998).
The first category of approaches achieve a reduction of computer time by reducing the size
and/or the number of matrices to be inverted, and/or the number of iterations needed. Tak-
ing ( > 2.53) as a guide, in order to reduce the computer time in the most efficient way, one
has to reduce NF or NL. One can trivially reduce these numbers by considering less frequen-
cies (levels), and thus constructing less accurate models, but this ruled out since the goal is to
construct as accurate and reliable models as possible. So, the way to go is keep the necessary
(large) numbers of these quantities, but only to eliminate them from matrices to be inverted.
Since NF is typically the largest contributor to the size of the linearization matrices, reducing
NF is most important. This can be achieved by using an idea of Accelerated Lambda Iteration
(ALI) method, which will be briefly described below. For a detailed discussion of other possible
improvements and modifications of the Complete Linearization scheme, see Hubeny and Lanz
(2003).
For LTE models, an interesting possibility is to linearize radiation intensities in all frequency
points. but to reorganize matrices as first suggested by Rybicki (1971) in the context of two-level
atom. Mihalas (1978) has reformulated the scheme to be applied for constructing LTE model
atmospheres. The schemewas implementedin a stellaratmosphere code tlusty (Hubeny 1988;
Hubeny and Lanz 1995) by Burrows et al. (2006) and Hubeny and Burrows (2007b) and was
used to construct comprehensive grids of model atmospheres for L and T dwarfs. It should
be noted that in order to make this scheme practical, all the structural parameters have to be
expressed as functions of a single parameter, the temperature.

The idea consists in the following: The original complete linearization organizes the master
Jacobi matrix in a block-tridiagonal structure, that is, as an ND × ND grand block matrix,
with inner (NF + ) × (NF + ) matrices. The inner matrices are composed of a diagonal
NF × NF upper left corner (because the individual frequency points are not explicitly cou-
pled), plus a full last row and column (arising from the linearization of the energy equation).
The Rybicki scheme reverses the order of the inner and outer structure: The grand matrix is an
(NF +)×(NF +) blocks matrix with inner blocks being ND × ND matrices. The outer block
structure corresponds to structural parameters (radiation intensities and temperature), and the
inner structure to depth points. The upper part of the NF × NF blocks is a block-diagonal
matrix, with each block being an ND × ND tridiagonal matrix, and the last row and column
of clocks are full matrices. The bulk of work consists in inverting NF tridiagonal ND × ND
matrices, which scales only as ND× NF, that is linearly with the number of frequency points.
The very unfavorable cubic scaling of computer time with the number of frequencies is now
completely avoided and is replaced by a linear scaling. The only cubic scaling is now with the
number of depth points, which is always kept quite low (up to about 100). The method is most
efficient with just one constraint equation; with more constraints the scaling would involve a
term with (NC × ND).
3.3.2 Accelerated Lambda Iteration
Soon after the advent of Complete Linearization, another crucial ingredient of the modern
numerical stellar atmospheres and radiation transfer was introduced, namely the first astro-
physical application of an iteration scheme that later became known as Accelerated Lambda
Iteration, or ALI for short. It was introduced by Cannon (1973a, b) by the name “Operator Per-
turbation” technique. Although recognized for its potential, the method was not widely used
until its reformulation by Scharmer (1981). The first application of the method to NLTE model
stellar atmospheres was worked out by Werner (1986), and the term ALI itself was coined by
Hamann (1985). A historical review is given by Hubeny (1992) and a more recent review by
Hubeny (2003).
The idea of the method is usually explained on a simple case of two-level atom with complete
frequency redistribution. Very briefly, the source function is written as
S = (−є)¯J + єB ,
(2.54)
where ¯J is a frequency-averaged mean intensity of radiation, є is the photon destruction param-
eter, and B the Planck function. In this problem, є and B are viewed as specified parameters.
The unknown quantity ¯J is given by
¯J ≡∫Jνϕν dν = Λ[S] ,
(2.55)
where ϕν is the (normalized) absorption profile coefficient. The second equality in ( > 2.55)
represents the formal solution of the transfer equation, which is essentially a process of obtain-
ing the radiation intensity from the source function. In the case of two-level atom, the Lambda
operator is linear in the mean intensity. The two-level atom problem may be written as a single
integral equation
S = (−є)Λ[S] + єB ,
(2.56)

72 2
Stellar Atmospheres
or, upon discretization, as a linear algebraic equation. Although it may be solved in a single step
without a need to iterate, a matrix representing Λ may be large and thus expensive to invert.
From the mathematical point of view, the ALI scheme is nothing else but an application of
the idea of iterative solution of large linear system by preconditioning, long known in numerical
analysis. The matrix is split into two parts, Λ = Λ∗+ (Λ −Λ∗), and the iterative procedure is
set up as
S(n+) = (−є)Λ∗[S(n+)] + (−є)(Λ −Λ∗)[S(n)] + єB .
(2.57)
The action of the exact Λ operator is thus split into two contributions: an approximate Λ∗oper-
ator that acts on the new iterate of the source function, and the difference Λ −Λ∗that acts on
the old, known, iterate of the source function. The latter contribution may be easily obtained by
a formal solution of the transfer equation. With the choice Λ∗= Λ, one recovers the exact, non-
iterative scheme, while with Λ∗= , one obtains the classical Lambda iteration (e.g., Mihalas
1978) which is known to converge extremely slowly. Thus, in order that Λ∗operator brings an
essential improvement over both schemes, it has to incorporate all the essential properties of
the exact Λ but, at the same time, be easy and cheap to invert. During the development of the
field, several approximate operators were suggested (for a historical review see Hubeny 1992).
In a seminal paper, Olson et al. (1986) performed a rigorous numerical analysis of the problem
and demonstrated that a nearly optimum operator is the diagonal (local) part of the exact Λ
operator. This makes the corresponding matrix inversions particularly easy because they are
reduced to simple algebraic divisions. Such a choice of approximate operator is equivalent to
the Jacobi method.
Finally, it should be noted that the convergence properties of the ALI scheme can be sig-
nificantly enhanced by applying various acceleration techniques, such as the Ng acceleration
(Auer 1987; Hubeny and Lanz 1992; Ng 1974), or methods based on Krylov subspace scheme
such as the Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES) scheme (Auer 1991; Hubeny and
Burrows 2007a; Klein et al. 1989).
In the context of model stellar atmospheres, one does not use the ALI scheme as a means
of evaluating the source function; instead, it is used as a means of expressing current mean
intensities, namely
Jν = Λ∗
ν Sν + (Λν −Λ∗
ν ) Sold
ν
,
(2.58)
where the second term represents a “correction” which is known from the previous iteration.
The source function is a function of other structural parameters (temperature, electron density,
atomic level populations). In the context of a linearization scheme, the first term of (> 2.58) is
easy to linearize in terms of these structural parameters, and the second term is known and need
not be linearized at all. The mean intensities of radiation are thus effectively eliminated from
the state vector. This is essentially the procedure used by Werner and collaborators (Dreizler
and Werner 1993; Werner 1986; Werner et al. 2003).
3.3.3 Hybrid CL/ALI Method
Hubeny and Lanz (1995) developed a variant of this approach, in which one uses ( > 2.58) to
eliminate the mean intensities in most, but not all, frequency points, while the intensities in a
few, most important, frequencies are treated as in original Complete Linearization (cores of the
strongest lines; frequencies just above the ionization thresholds of most important continua).

Stellar Atmospheres 2
73
The method is called hybrid CL/ALI method and offers a wide spectrum of options ranging
from full Complete Linearization to a full ALI scheme. It was demonstrated that the method
combines essential advantages of its both constituents: the computer time per iteration is essen-
tially the same as in the case of full ALI scheme, while the number of iterations needed to get
a converged model is essentially the same as in the original Complete Linearization, i.e., quite
small.
3.4 Available Modeling Codes
There are several publicly available codes for computing model stellar atmospheres. The
following list is by no means exhaustive.
For LTE models, the most popular code is Kurucz’s atlas (Kurucz 1970, 1993) and marcs
(Gustafsson et al. 1975). It should be noted that most of the NLTE codes listed below can be
used to calculate LTE models as well. Appropriately modified versions of phoenix and tlusty
were actually used for generating grids of LTE models – see >Sect. 3.5.1.
In the context of NLTE static models, the first publicly available NLTE model atmosphere
code was the “NCAR code” (Mihalas et al. 1975). More recently, popular and widely used
codes are tmap – Tuebingen Model Atmosphere Package (Dreizler and Werner 1993; Werner
1986, 1989; Werner et al. 2003), and tlusty (Hubeny 1988; Hubeny et al. 1994; Hubeny and
Lanz 1992, 1995). Static models are also being constructed by codes originally designed for
expanding atmospheres (by setting the expansion velocity to a very low value), such as cmfgen
(Hillier and Miller 1998) or phoenix (Hauschildt et al. 1997, 1999a).
It should be noted that besides the codes that solve for the complete NLTE model atmo-
sphere structure, there are several codes that take an atmospheric structure (temperature,
density) given and fixed, and solve for statistical equilibrium + radiative transfer for a selected
chemical element – the so-called restricted NLTE problem. Although recently these codes lost
much of their former appeal because the modern codes are capable of solving the structure
plus detailed NLTE rate equations for many species, they are still being used for analyz-
ing stellar spectra. The most popular codes of this sort are pandora (Avrett and Loeser
2003); detail/surface (Butler and Giddings 1985), and, perhaps the most widely used, multi
(Carlsson 1986).
3.5 Existing Model Atmosphere Grids
3.5.1 LTE Models
The most extensive grid of LTE plane-parallel line-blanketed models is that of Kurucz
(1979, 1993), widely used by the astronomical community. The grid covers effective tempera-
tures between 3,500 and 50,000 K, log g between −and , and for several metallicities. The term
“metallicity” traditionally means that all the chemical species heavier than helium share a com-
mon ratio of their abundance to the solar abundance; this ratio is called metallicity. Numerically,
the metallicity is often taken as a logarithm of the metal abundance ratio.
Using the marcs code, Gustafsson et al. (1975) generated their original grid of models for
cool stars, with Teff between 3,750 and 6,000 K; log g between .and .and metallicities

74 2
Stellar Atmospheres
−.≤[M/H] ≤. Recently, Gustafsson et al. (2008) made public a new, very extensive grid of
marcs model atmospheres, with Teff between 2,500 and 8,000 K, log g between −and , and
metallicities −≤[M/H] ≤. They also include “CN-cycled” models with C/N = 4.07 (solar),
1.5 and 0.5, and C/O from 0.09 to 5, which represents stars of spectral types R, S, and N.
Hauschildt et al. (1999a, b) used their code phoenix to generate a grid LTE spherical mod-
els for cool stars, called NextGen, with Teff between 3,000 and 10,000 K, with step 200 K; log g
between .and ., with step ., and metallicities −.≤[M/H] ≤. Another grid (Allard
et al. 2000) is for pre-main-sequence cool stars with Teff between 2,000 and 6,800 K, log g
between and .with step ., stellar mass M = .M⊙, and metallicities −.≤[M/H] ≤.
The models are available online at www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/EN/For/ThA/phoenix/index.html.
A detailed comparison between the ATLAS and NextGen models was performed by Bertone
et al. (2004).
3.5.2 NLTE Models
During the last three decades, it was amply demonstrated that departures from LTE are crucial
for spectroscopic studies of early-type stars, even the photospheric layers. Early NLTE mod-
els were constructed already in the late 1960s and in the first half of the 1970s by Mihalas
and coworkers (Mihalas 1972; Mihalas and Auer 1972). Nevertheless, the numerical problems
and sheer amount of computer time and memory needed for computing non-LTE metal line-
blanketed model atmospheres have precluded computing such models until the late 1980s.
Thanks to the development of a very efficient numerical methods such as ALI or the hybrid
CL/ALI scheme, this last barrier of the classical stellar atmosphere problem was broken and
non-LTE metal line-blanketed model, including literally millions of spectral lines in NLTE, are
now being constructed more or less routinely.
There are several partial grids of NLTE models for various stellar types mostly of hot stars.
The models constructed by the tmap code for very hot white dwarfs, subdwarfs, and pre-white
dwarfs (also known as the PG 1,159 stars) are available online at http://astro-uni-tuebingen.de/
~rauch/TMAP/TMAP.html. Rauch and Werner (2009) describe the so-called Virtual Obser-
vatory, which is a web-based interface that enables a user either to extract already computed
models, or generate specific model using tmap, for very hot objects (hottest white dwarfs;
super-soft X-ray sources).
The effort of the developers of tlusty culminated in the construction of a grid of
NLTE fully blanketed models atmospheres for O stars (OSTAR2002; Lanz and Hubeny 2003)
and early B stars (BSTAR2006; Lanz and Hubeny 2007). It is believed that these grids,
which each took several years of computer time of several top-level workstations, repre-
sent a more or less definitive grids of models in the context of 1D plane-parallel geom-
etry, with hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium, and without any unnecessary numerical
approximations.
The basic characteristics are as follows: The OSTAR2002 grid contains 680 individual model
atmospheres for 12 values of Teff between 27,500 and 55,000 K, with a step of 2,500 K, and 8
values of log g, and for 10 metallicities: 2, 1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/30, 1/50, 1/100, 1/1000, and 0 times
the solar metal composition. The following species are treated in NLTE: H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, P,
S, Fe, Ni, in all important stages of ionization; which means that there are altogether over 1,000
(super)levels to be treated in NLTE, and about lines, and about 250,000 frequency points to
describe the spectrum.

Stellar Atmospheres 2
75
The BSTAR2006 grid is similar. It contains 1,540 individual models for 16 values of Teff
between 15,000 and 30,000 K, with a step of 1,000 K, and for 6 metallicities: 2, 1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10,
and 0 times solar. The species treated in NLTE are the same as in OSTAR2002, adding Mg
and Al, but removing Ni, which is less important for B stars. There are altogether about 1,450
(super)levels treated in NLTE, about lines, and about 400,000 frequency points. The models
for both grids are available online at http://nova.astro.umd.edu.
Several representative results from the grids are shown below. > Figure 2-1 displays the
temperature structure for three representative effective temperatures of the OSTAR2002 grid.
The temperature distribution nicely illustrates the basic features of line blanketing, namely the
so-called back-warming (line blanketing leads to a heating of moderatelydeep atmospheric lay-
ers between Rosseland optical depths 0.01 and 1), and a surface cooling. The zero-metallicity
and low metallicities models exhibit a temperature rise at the surface, a typical NLTE effect
discovered by Auer and Mihalas (1969) and explained as an indirect heating effect of the hydro-
gen Lyman and Balmer lines. This effect competes with surface cooling caused by metal lines,
and these effects nearly cancel at metallicities 1/50 (for hotter models) to 1/10 (cooler models).
Interestingly, the temperature curves for all metallicities cross in a very narrow range of optical
depths.
From the practical point of view, the most important result of model atmospheres is the
prediction of emergent radiation, which is then compared to the observed spectrum in order
to determine the basic stellar parameters. Also, theoretical predictions are indispensable for
estimating the radiation in unobservable spectrum regions, in particularin the hydrogen Lyman
continuum (wavelength less than 912 Å), which produces ionizing photons, but which cannot
be directlydetected forearly-type stars because ofthe absorption byinterstellarhydrogen. (Only
two early-type stars, є and β CMa, which are relatively close, and which lie in the direction of a
“tunnel” of low density in the local interstellar medium, have detectable Lyman continuum flux
as observed by the EUVE satellite.)
A sensitivity of the predicted spectra to the effective temperature is depicted in >Fig. 2-2,
which shows (from top to bottom) emergent spectra for 50, 45, 40, 35, and 30 kK. Notice a
diminishing Lyman jump at 912 Å when going to higher temperatures; this is a consequence
of increased ionization of hydrogen. A similar sensitivity to metallicity is shown in >Fig. 2-3.
The models with higher metallicities exhibit deeper lines but higher continuum flux.
> Figure 2-4 shows the predicted flux from the OSTAR2002 grid for three solar com-
position model atmospheres with Teff = , K, 40,000 K, and 50,000 K, for log g = ,
degraded to a lower resolution (about 5 Å), compared to Kurucz model fluxes. Differences both
in the continuum level, as well as in the individual line features, are clearly seen. An analo-
gous comparison of the predicted flux from the BSTAR2006 grid for three solar composition
model atmospheres with Teff = , K, 20,000 K, and 15,000 K, for log g = , degraded to
a lower resolution (about 5 Å), compared to Kurucz model fluxes, is presented in >Fig. 2-5.
A similar comparison of high-resolution spectra in several wavelength intervals is presented
in >Fig. 2-6.
As an actual example of a fit of OSTAR2002 models to observations, > Fig. 2-7 displays
a sample of the predicted flux for a model for Teff = , K, log g = ., and a high-
resolution, high signal-to-noise observation of a late-O main-sequence star 10 Lac secured by
the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (Hubeny
et al. 1998; Lanz et al., in preparation). The agreement between observations and predictions
is excellent and demonstrates a power of the present-day model atmospheres of early-type
stars.

Using Model Stellar Atmospheres to Determine the
Fundamental Stellar Parameters
The fundamental stellar parameters to be determined are the stellar mass, M∗, radius, R∗, lumi-
nosity, L∗, and the chemical composition, i.e., the set of abundances (ratios of the total number
of particles of species A with respect to hydrogen). If the distance to the star, d, is not known,
it is added to the list of fundamental parameters to be determined, even if it does not represent
an intrinsic stellar property.
A determination of chemical composition is a subject of a vast volume of literature so that
there is no need to repeat it here. Essentially, they are determined by comparing the observed
line profiles (or integrated quantities, like equivalent widths) with those predicted from model
atmospheres.

in 10−9 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1. Most spectral features are lines of Fe IV, Fe V, Ni IV, and Ni V. A diﬀerence
between theory and predictions is hardly seen on the plots
There are, obviously, other stellar parameters, like the rotational velocity and others, but for
the purposes of this chapter, it is assumed that these additional parameters and the chemical
abundances are determined independently of the fundamental parameters listed above.
The parameters which can be determined directly from observations are the effective tem-
perature, Teff, and surface gravity, g. In addition, one has the measured magnitude, mobs, that

reflects the whole observationally accessible wavelength range. If the flux in the unobserv-
able region is negligible, then this magnitude represents the total, bolometric, magnitude, mbol.
If not, one has to apply the bolometric correction, which follows from the model atmosphere.
In any case, one ends up with three “measured” quantities, Teff, g, and mbol, but there are
four unknown fundamental parameters, M∗, R∗, L∗, and d. The governing relations between
them are
σ T
eff = L∗/(πR
∗) ,
(2.59)
g = GM∗/R
∗,
(2.60)
L∗= L∗[mbol (mobs, Teff) , d] ,
(2.61)
The last relation expresses the conversion of the observed magnitude to the stellar luminosity.
There are thus three relations for four unknowns. In fact, in some cases, the stellar evolution
theory may supply an independent additional relation between the fundamental parameters, for
instance, the mass–radius relation for white dwarfs (Hamada and Salpeter 1961) or the mass–
luminosity relation for central stars of planetary nebulae (Paczynski 1971). However, in the
general situation one does not have such a relation, and, even if so, one may want to check the
theoretically predicted relations observationally.
Therefore, from the photospheric analysis only, one cannot derive all four parameters simul-
taneously. This is easily understoodfrom the physical point of view. A plane-parallel hydrostatic
atmosphere is just a thin layer located on the top of a spherical star. The only information about
a dimension of the underlying star is contained in the surface gravity g which depends also
on the stellar mass. Since the atmosphere is thin, the emergent spectrum does not carry any
independent information about the atmospheric extent.
To remove the radius–mass degeneracy, either an independent geometrical information
(knowing the radius or the distance) or an independent knowledge of the mass is needed. A
typical situation is that the distance d is known (e.g., from Hipparchos parallaxes); then the
other parameters are determined as follows:
1. From known mobs and d (and, possibly, Teff), the absolute bolometric magnitude, Mbol and,
therefore, luminosity, L∗, is determined.
2. From L∗and Teff, the stellar radius, R∗, is determined.
3. From R∗and g, the stellar mass, M∗, is determined.
As it turns out, if the mass of an early-type O stars is determined in this way, the so-called
spectroscopic mass, and if the mass is also determined by comparing the evolutionary tracks
and the position of the star in the H-R diagram, the so-called evolutionary mass, one finds a
significant discrepancy (e.g., Herrero et al. 1992). The sense of discrepancy is that the spectro-
scopic masses are systematically lower than the evolutionary masses. The discrepancy arises
either by inaccuracies of the stellar atmospheres theory, or the stellar evolution theory, or, most
likely, both. From the stellar atmospheres side, there has been a progress in understanding the
reasons for the discrepancy (e.g., Lanz et al. 1996), namely as an effect of a previously neglected
effects of metal line blanketing on the atmospheric structure. However, the problem is not yet
fully solved.

Summary and Outlook
Thanks to the concentrated effort of several groups of researchers, starting with pioneering work
of Mihalas and Auer in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and a continuing effort during the last
three decades, the problem of constructing 1D stationary model atmospheres, even with full
metal line blanketing and in NLTE, is now conceptually solved, although a significant amount
of new models still need to be computed.
Even in the domain of LTE models, new discoveries led to new challenges. In particular, the
rapidly evolving field of modeling atmospheres of substellar-massobjects, such as brown dwarfs
and extrasolar giant planets, provides a natural extension of the traditional stellar atmosphere
theory to new and exciting domains, and contributes to a revival of stellar atmospheres theory
in general.
The next big step will be to go to 3D radiation hydrodynamic models, which will undoubt-
edly be one of the main themes of theoretical astrophysics in the next decade. The effort in this
area is under way, but much remains to be done. The future of the stellar atmospheres theory
thus seems quite bright and exciting.

The Sun as a Star
Abstract:
In this chapter we provide an overview of various observational and theoretical
aspects about the Sun, paying more attention to global ones, i.e., to those where the Sun is con-
sidered as a star, so they can be more or less directly related to those studied for other stars. The
emphasis is on the processes by which energy is transferred to the solar atmosphere and then
flows from the Sun in the form of radiation and particles. The chapter starts with an historical
introduction, and then discusses various subjects, starting with a brief description of the pho-
tosphere, the chromosphere, and the transition region of the Sun. The interior of the Sun is then
introduced, with the standard model and solar neutrinos, and with the observations and the-
ory of solar oscillations. We present some important results from helioseismology, and briefly
discuss the problematics involved with the production and regeneration of the solar magnetic
fields during a solar cycle.
We then discuss the atomic processes which lead to the formation of the optically thin
radiation that is emitted from the X-rays to the UV from the solar corona. In particular, the
spectroscopic diagnostic techniques which are used to determine the physical parameters of a
stellar corona are discussed in some depth.
We describe some of the in situ and remote-sensing measurements and modeling that have
been used to obtain the solar chemical abundances, and how they compare with stellar and
galactic abundances. We then introduce the main features of the solar corona, together with
observations and modeling of flares and coronal mass ejections. We conclude by describing
two subjects of relevance for the entire solar system and in particular for our planet, the solar
wind and the solar irradiance.
For each subject, we provide a brief historical overview, and then refer the reader to standard
textbooks and recent literature. Our knowledge of the Sun as a star has progressed significantly
over the last century, however a clear understanding of the physical processes at work in the
interior of the Sun, in its atmosphere, and in the solar wind is still incomplete, and further
challenges lie ahead. We should be able tounderstand ourSun, before we can attempt a complete
description of other stars and astrophysical objects.

Introduction
The Sun is a typical middle-aged, low-mass star, but it is the only star which can be studied in
great detail, due to its proximity. Viewed in white light, and at low resolution, the Sun might
appear as a featurelessdisk, except for the occasional presence of a few sunspots. However, when
viewed at ultraviolet (UV) or X-ray wavelengths, the hot corona provides a spectacular display,
as shown in >Fig. 3-1.
With the advent of space-borne instrumentation over the past few decades, some fantastic
images and movies have been obtained, together with new insights into the nature of the solar
atmosphere. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray observations of the solar atmosphere from
the most recent solar missions, such as the Yohkoh, SoHO, TRACE, Stereo, Hinode and SDO
satellites, have revealed complex and dynamic structures, which are clearly governed by the
Sun’s magnetic field. The energy channeled by and stored in solar magnetic fields is released in
the solar atmosphere in the form of thermal and kinetic energy, both on small and large scales.

This energy release can be observed in a number of interesting and dramatic phenomena, rang-
ing from small brightenings and jets to huge solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
seen as intense emission in a broad wavelength range: from X-rays down to radio frequencies.
Stimulated by these recent observations, research in solar physics, both observational and
theoretical, has progressed at a rapid pace. Major progress has been made in recent years on
some fundamental issues: the main dynamo responsible for the magnetic field and sunspots
is believed to be based in the tachocline (the thin layer just below the convective zone); mag-
netic fields emerge through the photosphere over a wide range of scales and create many small
regions of opposite polarity magnetic flux in the quiet Sun (forming what is termed the magnetic
carpet); the corona has a highly complex topology and may well be heated by the coronal tec-
tonics mechanism; magnetic flux emergence into the solar atmosphere can trigger large-scale
explosive events (solar flares and coronal mass ejections); the solar wind can be highly variable,
with an as yet unknown acceleration mechanism. Significant advances have been made in the-
ory and modeling but further work is needed. For example, it is only in the last few years that
the process of magnetic reconnection (by which magnetic field lines change connectivity and
energy can be released) has been studied in 3D. It turns out that 3D reconnection is completely
different from 2D reconnection. New insights have been provided concerning the impact of the
Sun on the heliosphere and near-Earth environment, using in situ measurements from SoHO,
Cluster and Ulysses.
The Sun is a yellow dwarf star with a mass of × kg, a diameter of 1,392,000 km (just
over 109 times the diameter of the Earth) and is 149.6 million km from the Earth (termed an
Astronomical Unit, 1 AU). The Sun is 4.5 billion years old, almost half way through its life
cycle. It will eventually grow into a red giant. The color of a star is determined by the surface
temperature, most stars being between 3,000 K (red) and 40,000 K (blue). The Sun appears yel-
low because it has a surface temperature of around 6,000 K, but the temperature of the core is
15 million K. The nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is 4 light-years away (63,240 AU).
Sirius, often called the Dog star, is the brightest star in the sky. It is a blue star with a surface
temperature of 10,000 K and is 9 light-years away. It has a very faint and dense companion, a
white dwarf known as Sirius B, which has the mass of the Sun, but is only the size of the Earth.
The first spatially resolved image which astronomers were able to obtain of another star was

of Betelgeuse, which is a red supergiant in the far-off constellation of Orion. Its mass is about
ten times that of the Sun, but it is 50,000 times brighter than the Sun. If it were in the same
position as the Sun, it would extend almost out to the orbit of Jupiter. When the Sun is about
7 billion years old it will slowlystart tochange and will become biggerand cooler. Bythe time it is
10 billion years old it will have changed into a red giant and its atmosphere will stretch out to
near where the Earth is today. The Sun is just one star in a spiral galaxy, the Milky Way, which
is 75,000 light years across and contains 100 billion stars.
The Sun provides a unique physical laboratory with extreme conditions. The level of detail
which we can now observe is almost overwhelming, from the visible to the X-rays. It is indeed
a challenge to understand and model the underlying physical processes. Studies of the Sun have
helped to deepen our understanding of processes in other stars. Interdisciplinary research in
the solar-stellar connection reveals insights into properties as diverse as astrophysical dynamo
action, starspots, flares, prominences, and variations in elemental abundances. Stellar coronae
seem to be a general phenomena rather than an exceptional occurrence. It has become clear
that all late-type stars share the same basic coronal characteristics: the presence of thermal
plasma at several million degrees, magnetic confinement, the presence of flares, etc. The basic
plasma physics governing coronae is also probably very similar in all of these stars. Otherwise
similar stars may have very different levels of stellar activity, UV and X-ray luminosity, and
starspots. This is believed to be due to very different rotation speeds which probably determine
how effectively the stellar magnetic dynamo generates magnetic fields. One might then expect
that differences between the coronae of late-type stars are just due to rather different regimes of
the dynamo at work inside the stars, while the basic plasma phenomena occurring in the outer
magnetized coronal plasma are probably very similar. EUV and X-ray spectroscopic observa-
tions, such as those from EUVE, FUSE, XMM, and Chandra have progressed our knowledge of
stellar atmospheres enormously.
Listed below are some of the key questions confronting us in solar research in the modern
era, which also relate to other stars and their stellar systems.
•
How are magnetic fields generated and transported in the interior of the Sun?
•
What causes the solar activity cycle?
•
How is the solar corona heated?
•
What is the source of and acceleration mechanism for the coronal mass ejections and the
solar wind?
•
How does the Sun interact with the Earth’s environment?
•
What is the relationship between solar radiation and the Earth’s climate?
In this chapter it is impossible to cover or do justice to the whole spectrum of solar research.
We have therefore chosen to focus primarily on what has been learnt from recent observations
of the Sun and measurements of the solar wind. We relate these studies to theoretical models
where possible, but have left out much of the detailed theoretical work, for example MHD,
dynamo, convection and helioseismology models, which could in themselves comprise a whole
book, or indeed several volumes! Instead, we refer the reader to standard texts in these subjects.
In this chapter we present a historical perspective and the latest solar observations, techniques,
interpretation of these observations linked to theoretical models, concepts and possibilities for
future directions in solar research, in the context of the Sun as a star. The emphasis is on the
processes by which energy is transferred to the solar atmosphere and then flows from the Sun in
the form of radiation and particles. In particular, the spectroscopic diagnostic techniques which

are used to determine the physical parameters of the solar atmosphere are discussed in depth.
They provide a powerful tool for probing the nature of the solar atmosphere. Similar techniques
are now also being applied to the study of other stars and astrophysical objects.
Several excellent books on the Sun have been written in recent years which feature the latest
solar observations and theories (Aschwanden 2006; Foukal 2004; Golub and Pasachoff 2010;
Phillips 1992; Phillips et al. 2008; Priest and Forbes 2000; Thomas and Weiss 2008). Earlier
books, such as Athay (1976), Jordan (1981), Priest (1982), Zirin (1988), Mariska (1992), and
Stix (2002) are timeless. These are highly recommended for further study.

Historic Perspective
Chinese astronomers reported seeing sunspots several thousand years ago. They did not have
telescopes, but when looking through fog or the smoke from forest fires, they noticed that the
Sun had verysmall, dark dots on it. However, it was not until the invention ofthe telescope that it
was possible to study sunspots in detail. The first telescopic observations of sunspots were made
by Galileo and Harriot in 1610. However, Harriot never published his observations of sunspots
so his work was not known about until after his death. Galileo noted that sunspots appeared,
disappeared, and changed their shapes so he deduced that they could not possibly be planets
just passing in front of the Sun. He also noted that the sunspots moved (the Sun’s rotation is
around 25 days in the equatorial region, but slower toward the polar regions). Galileo was not
the first to use a telescope, but he was one of the first to carry out extensive observations of the
skies (day and nighttime) with his telescope.
In 1843, Samuel Schwabe discovered a periodic variation in the average number of sunspots
seen on the disk of the Sun from year to year. By studying these and other observations, Rudolf
Wolf was able to reconstruct the solar cycle back to 1745, eventually pushing these reconstruc-
tions back to the earliest observations of sunspots by Galileo and his contemporaries. Cycles as
short as 9 years and as long as 14 years have been observed, but the average is 11 years. During
the solar minimum, the Sun can go for long periods without any sunspots. During solar maxi-
mum, the Sun is very active, with many active regions (and corresponding sunspots) producing
solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The solar activity cycle can have consequences
for the Earth’s environment, space weather, and the climate. For example, the period between
1645 and 1715, a time during which very few sunspots were observed coincides with the Little
Ice Age. This epoch is now known as the Maunder minimum. However, it should be stressed
that recent (during the last three decades) global warming cannot be attributed to changes in
the solar cycle.
Sir Isaac Newton was fascinated by the nature of light. It was known that when white light
shone through a prism, the colors of the rainbow were produced. However, it was thought that
the nature of light was changed within the prism. Newton took another prism and isolated one
color. This remained unchanged when passing back through the second prism. His work was
published by the Royal Society Opticks: or a Treatiseof the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and
Colors of Light. His interests lay in many fields of science and mathematics, including astron-
omy, and he built the first reflecting telescope, which used mirrors instead of lenses. Hence he
removed the aberrations of colors which were problematic with refracting telescopes. Wollas-
ton in 1802 commented on the gaps in the visible spectrum. Thereafter spectroscopic techniques

developed rapidly. In 1811, Fraunhofer produced a spectrum of the Sun, using a spectrograph
with a slit, showing an array of dark absorption lines (see >Fig. 3-2). The Fraunhofer spectrum
is formed by the continuous spectrum of the photosphere, with a characteristic temperature of
6,000 K, superimposed by absorption lines.
The second half of the nineteenth century saw rapid advances in observations of the solar
corona during eclipses. Pietro Angelo Secchi SJ (1818–1878) was an Italian astronomer who
made fundamental contributions to astrophysics and solar physics. His photographs of the solar
corona taken during the eclipse of 1860 in Spain, together with those of Warren de la Rue,
provided the first proof that prominences are real effects of the solar atmosphere. >Figure 3-3
shows the corona in visible light during a total solar eclipse. Because the corona is a million
times fainter than the solar disk, we can observe it from the Earth only during a total solar
eclipse, or by using a coronagraph which simulates an eclipse by occulting the bright solar disk.
The most striking physical property of the corona is its extent, with streamers stretching out for
great distances.
We now know that the emission from the solar corona is diverse. The dominant contri-
butions are the so-called K- (Kontinuierlich), F- (Fraunhofer), and E- (Emission) corona. The
F-corona is photospheric light reflected by dust particles which are present close to the Sun.
The reflection largely keeps the photospheric emission unmodified. The K-corona is photo-
spheric light scattered by coronal electrons. The scattering polarizes the light and broadens the
Fraunhofer lines so much that they become undetectable.

Spectroscopy techniques were used to analyze the solar atmosphere during eclipses. Janssen
was the first to apply slit spectroscopy during the 1868 eclipse in India, and to observe the chro-
mosphere and solar prominences in emission in the red Hα (line C in the Fraunhofer spectrum)
line. At the 1868 eclipse, as the photosphere was covered, Young attempted to observe the flash
spectrum of the chromosphere. He eventually succeeded in observing it at the 1870 eclipse in
Spain. Young (1870) realized that these emission lines corresponded to the dark absorption
lines seen in the spectrum from the solar disk. The dark Fraunhofer lines in the photospheric
spectrum are in fact due to absorption by chromospheric material. Lockyer was the person who
actually coined the name chromosphere (color-sphere). Both Janssen and Lockyer discovered
a bright yellow line due to an unknown element. This line was close to the sodium doublet
(named D,D), so the new line was named D. Because it was found only on the Sun, the ele-
ment was named helium by Lockyer after the Greek name Heliosfor the Sun. Only later, in 1895,
was helium identified on Earth. We now know that helium is the most abundant element after
hydrogen, and that helium also produces the strongest emission lines in the extreme-ultraviolet.
An image of the Sun in helium emission is shown in >Fig. 3-4.
The 1868 eclipse was also particularly important because the first of the coronal lines, the
green one (5303 Å), was observed by Rayet observing in Siam (now Thailand). The following
year, in 1869, at the US eclipse, Harkness and Young also observed the green coronal emission
line, although they incorrectly identified it with a nearby chromospheric line (5317 Å). It was
only during the 1898 eclipse that these two lines were separated by Lockyer. The observation of
the green coronal emission line provided a weight of evidence that the corona (as seen during
an eclipse) was a characteristic of the Sun rather than the Moon. However, the coronal green
line and other coronal visible emission lines provided astronomers with a major puzzle. This
presented the single most outstanding problem in astrophysics for 50 years. The wavelength of
the green line, 1474 (on Kirchhoff’s scale, 5303 Å) did not match the emission spectrum from
any known element. This presented a serious challenge to the new science of spectroscopy. In
addition, the corona extendedmuch further (by a factor of 100) from the solar disk than seemed

possible. The name coronium was assigned to the unknown element responsible for the coronal
green line. Lyot (1939) used his coronagraph to study the coronal spectrum and found that
the green line was very wide (0.9 Å). A major advance came in 1939 through the meticulous
laboratory work of Edlen, who following a suggestion by Grotrian, assigned the strange coronal
lines to highly ionized stages of iron, calcium and nickel (Edlén 1942). The green line is due
to the forbidden transition in the ground configuration of Fe xiv (Fe+), that is iron with 13
electrons stripped from its outer shells. The red line is due to Fe x and the yellow line to Ca xv.
The identifications of these coronal lines became one of the great triumphs in astrophysics.
Temperatures in excess of 1 MK are needed to produce these ion stages, which also explained
the large extent of coronal emission.
How energy was produced in stars posed another major puzzle for astronomers. In the nine-
teenth century, Lord Kelvin thought that the Sun might be powered by gravity. He suggested
that if the Sun were collapsing and gradually getting smaller, the gravitational potential energy
might be transferred into the heat and light the Sun emits. From the size and mass of the Sun,
Kelvin calculated that the Sun could not be more than 25 million years old. The problem with
Kelvin’s theory was that scientists had already shown that the Earth was at least 400 million years
old (we now know it to be a lot older than that). It hardly seemed likely that the Earth could
be a lot older than the Sun. Bethe finally solved the mystery of the Sun’s energy in the 1930s,
but he based his ideas on the work Einstein had done many years before, when he proposed his
famous formula E = mc, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light. Bethe sug-
gested that if the Sun could change just a small amount of its mass into energy, there would be
enough energy to power the Sun for billions of years. He suggested that a way of doing this was
to convert hydrogen to helium. Bethe won a Nobel Prize in 1967 for his discovery concerning
the energy production in stars. Actually, Bethe’s work was also based on pioneering work by a
famous English astronomer, Eddington who said in 1926 “It is not too much to hope that in the
not too distant future we shall be able to understand so simple a thing as a star”.
At its core, the Sun is dense and hot enough (15 MK) to allow thermonuclear reactions to
occur and to convert hydrogen into helium. The energy generated at the core is transferred by
radiation out to about 0.7 of the solar radius. From this point, the energy is transported to the
photosphere through convection. Through the combined actions of convection and differential
rotation, the Sun operates as an alpha-omega dynamo where the magnetic field is constantly
generated and sustained. The global solar magnetic field, driven by the regenerative dynamo,
oscillates between the poloidal and toroidal components every 11 years, creating what is known
as the solar cycle. The solar tachocline, at the bottom of the convection zone, is now known to
play a key role in the dynamo process (Hughes et al. 2007).
The structure of the solar atmosphere can be crudely divided into different layers of gas and
plasma threaded by magnetic fields. When viewed in white light the Sun appears to have a sharp
edge, suggesting the existence of a solar surface. However, the Sun is a gas (plasma) and this
apparent surface arises because the opacity of the solar plasma rises rapidly with temperature.
The thin layer over which this rapid change from transparent to opaque takes place is termed the
photosphere and has a characteristic temperatureof 6,000 K. In fact, the base of the photosphere
depends on the wavelength of the radiation. A common but somewhat arbitrary definition is
where the optical depth is unity for radiation of wavelength 5,000 Å (Phillips et al. 2008).
Lying above the photosphere, the chromosphere has a typical thickness of 2,000 km and
temperatures up to around 20,000 K (see > Fig. 3-5). The photosphere and lower chromo-
sphere are largely made up of neutral H atoms. In the upper chromosphere, the H atoms begin
to be ionized, and large numbers of free protons and electrons may be found together with the

neutral H and He atoms. The transition region (TR) is a very thin region above the chromo-
sphere, in which the temperature drastically increases to about 1MK. The corona is the very hot,
extended outer layer of the solar atmosphere. At these high temperatures, the coronal plasma
emits radiation strongly in the EUV and X-rays. The unexpected and extraordinarily high tem-
perature of the corona has been one of the main focuses for solar research over the past seven
decades. The heating mechanism for the solar corona remains a hotly debated topic. A great
deal of progress has been made in this regard, but a full explanation still eludes us.
The resolution of the coronal heating problem is likely to involve a mechanism by which
magnetic energy can be dissipated as heat, such as reconnection. The appearance of the solar
corona reflects the geometry and strength of the magnetic fields that are produced and emerge
continuously from below the photosphere. A magnetic field of strength B exerts a pressure
B/π on the plasma, which adds to the gas pressure P. The ratio of the gas pressure P to the
magnetic pressure is known as the plasma β. While in the photosphere the pressure of the ther-
mal gas dictates the behavior of the magnetic field lines, the opposite is true in the solar corona.
Due to the low density, the gas pressure is significantly smaller, so that β << 1, i.e., the magnetic
field dominates the dynamics of the tenuous coronal plasma.
As seen in X-ray emission (> Fig. 3-6) the corona is made up of three main structures:
active regions (ARs), displaying intense X-ray emission; quiet regions, or the quiet Sun (QS),
displaying faint, diffuse emission; and coronal holes (CHs) from which practically no coronal
emission is detected.CHs are regions were the magnetic field is principally of one polarity. They
are often found at the solar poles, but can also appear in other regions. The QS has a mixed-
polarity magnetic field and is peppered with small bright points. A characteristic of ARs is the
presence of hot loop arches (typically 1–4 MK) mirroring the magnetic field configuration and

are frequently observed (in white light) in mature ARs (see >Fig. 3-8). The most tantalizing
aspects of the atmospheric activity such as solar flares, erupting filaments, and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) are often associated with ARs which have a strong magnetic field concen-
tration. These highly energetic manifestations of the solar activity play an important role in
understanding, and ultimately predicting, space weather.

Observing the Solar Atmosphere from Space
The solar corona emits radiation over a very broad range of wavelengths, but because it is so
hot, the UV and X-ray emission is very strong. Observing the Sun in spectral regions outside
the visible, infrared, and radio wavelength ranges is only possible above the Earth’s atmosphere.
3.1 Early Space Missions
The 1970s saw a rapid development in techniques for high spatial resolution imaging of the
X-ray corona. A number of rockets observing the corona with spectrometers in the X-rays and
EUV were launched.
In May 1973, the first NASA space station, Skylab (see >Fig. 3-9), was launched. The Apollo
Telescope Mount (ATM) on Skylab carried several state-of-the-art solar instruments, both

imaging and spectroscopic, observing from the UV to the X-rays. Naval Research Laboratory’s
S082A instrument (often affectionately called the “overlap-ogram”) on the ATM had an excep-
tionally good spatial resolution (better than 2′′) and covered a wavelength range 170–630 Å.
Skylab/ATM was a highly successful mission, followed by several data analysis workshops,
which brought togetherobservers and theoreticians. The qualityand quantityofdata (mainly on
photographic plates) provided a major impetus for space-based solar physics. Three topics were
chosen for study at the Skylab workshops: Coronal Hole and High Speed Wind Streams (Zirker
1977), Solar Flares (Sturrock 1980) and Solar Active Regions (Orrall 1981). These volumes are
an excellent starting point as a foundation for research in these fields.

February 1980 saw the launch of a new solar space satellite, the Solar Maximum Mission,
SMM (cf. >Fig. 3-10), dedicated to the study of the active Sun, active regions, and solar flares.
SMM remained operational until December 1989, with an in-orbit repair by the NASA Space
Shuttle in April 1984. SMM carried instruments to record gamma-rays, X-ray emission (both
hard and soft), together with a UV spectrometer, a coronagraph, and also an irradiance moni-
tor (ranging from UV to infrared). Preliminary results from SMM were published in a special
volume of ApL, 1981, (244) and further results were published in a special NASA publication
NASA, CP-2439, Energetic Phenomena on the Sun (1986).
The SMM X-ray polychromator (XRP) Flat and Bent Crystal Spectrometers (FCS and BCS)
instruments produced excellent X-ray spectra of the solar corona, which remain unsurpassed
even nowadays, three decades later.
> Figure 3-11 shows an XRP/FCS spectrum of a flare,
which is remarkably similar to the X-ray spectrum of active stars such as Capella, also shown
in the Figure. These X-ray spectra are dominated by Fe xvii and Fe xviii lines in the 12–18 Å
range. The XRP/FCS had limited spatial resolution. These data allowed measurements of the

measurements of relative coronal abundances of various elements. The XRP/BCS, which was
full disk, observed X-ray line complexes of high temperature (in excess of 10 MK) coronal lines:
Fe xxvi, Fe xxv, Ca xix, and S xv. The observed spectral range allowed a wide range of plasma
diagnostics to be applied. The He-like ions (Fe xxv, Ca xix and S xv) allowed for example mea-
surements of electron densities and temperatures (Gabriel and Jordan 1969). A sample XRP/
BCS spectrum of a flare is given in >Fig. 3-12. The resonance w line is the strongest transition,
followed by the intercombination z and forbidden x, y. The satellite lines (i.e., those formed by
dielectronic recombination) are indicated with a ’d’. The presence of satellite lines allowed some
important diagnostic measurements (see, e.g., Phillips et al. 2008).
Other solar X-ray missions included the P78-1 satellite launched in 1979 and the Japanese
satellite, Hinotori (meaning firebird) launched in 1981. A good overview of results from SMM
and Hinotori can be found in Culhane and Jordan (1991).
3.2 Yohkoh
Yohkoh (Japanese for sunbeam) was a very successful joint Japanese, UK, NASA satellite
launched in August 1991, which operated successfully for a decade until 2001. The instruments
on Yohkoh were able to observe the Sun in X-ray and Gamma Ray emission. The spacecraft

carried four instruments: the Soft X-Ray Telescope (SXT), the Bragg Crystal Spectrometer
(BCS), the Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS), and the Hard X-Ray Telescope (HXT). The SXT
instrument was widely used to study the plasma properties of active regions and solar flares. The
SXT was a grazing-incidence X-ray telescope capable of imaging the Sun and resolving features
down to 2.5′′ in size (see >Fig. 3-6). Yohkoh/SXT could be used to derive some information
about the temperature and density of the plasma by comparing images recorded using differ-
ent filters. The BCS observed the X-ray H- and He-like line complexes observed by SMM/BCS.
Early results from YOHKOH were presented in a special issue of the Publications of the Astro-
nomical Society of Japan, PASJ, 1992, Vol. 4. There have been many conferences and workshops
dedicated to results from YOHKOH.
3.3 Ulysses
Most satellites have orbits within the ecliptic. The Ulysses mission was the first and only
space probe dedicated to the exploration of the heliosphere out of the ecliptic plane. Indeed,
much of our knowledge about the solar wind comes from this unique mission. Ulysses was
launched in October 1990 and, after an encounter with Jupiter, started on its journey out of the
ecliptic.

3.4 The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory – SoHO
The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory is the most comprehensive and successful solar obser-
vatory ever built. SoHO is a joint NASA and ESA mission, which was launched in December
1995 and is still operational. The scientific objectives of SoHO are to study the solar interior,
using helioseismology; to investigate the heating mechanism for the solar corona, together
with the origin and acceleration mechanism of the solar wind. The SoHO satellite has an
unusual orbit, it orbits the Sun at the first Lagrangian (L1) point, allowing the instruments an
uninterrupted 24 h view of the Sun.
SoHO carries 12 instruments, including 4 EUV/UV instruments for studying the solar
atmosphere. The Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) is a UK-led instrument designed at
the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). CDS has been used to study the relationship of the
transition region and coronal emission – it is designed to determine the physical parameters
of the solar atmosphere. The instrument measures EUV emission lines from the Sun’s atmo-
sphere in the wavelength range 150–800 Å. The instrument comprises two spectrometers: the
Normal Incidence Spectrometer (NIS) and the Grazing Incidence Spectrometer (GIS). The
wavelength range covered by the two detectors contains many emission lines. The NIS detector
can receive radiation in the two wavelength bands, NIS-1, 308–381 Å and NIS-2, 513–633 Å
(see >Fig. 3-13). To construct monochromatic images (rasters) using the emission lines mea-
sured by NIS, a scan mirror is moved across the solar region with a chosen slit (2′′ or 4′′). One
example is shown in >Fig. 3-14. The CDS instrument has a maximum Field of View (FOV) of
× arcminwith a spatial resolution of about 5′′.
The Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) is a high-resolution
(spatial and spectral) instrument covering the wavelength range 500–1,600Å in first and second
order (see
>Fig. 3-15). SUMER can resolve fine structures, with a spatial resolution of about
2′′. As in the case of the CDS, SUMER has been able to scan solar regions to obtain monochro-
matic images in selected spectral lines (see, e.g., >Fig. 3-16). SUMER can also measure Doppler
motions (flows) with an accuracy better than 2 km/s and nonthermal line broadening in the
chromosphere and transition region.
The Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT)has provided superb imagesand movies of
the solar atmosphere with a spatial resolution of 2.6′′ per pixel. The instrument uses multilayer
technology, whereby the reflecting surfaces are coated with layers of various materials. High
reflectivities in the EUV are achieved, but images are formed over passbands which are typically
10–50 Å wide. The EIT has four passbands centered on the following wavelengths: 171, 195, 284,
304 Å (see >Fig. 3-17). In most conditions, the first band is dominated by Fe ix, Fe x formed at
× K. The second band is dominated in active regions by Fe xii, formed around .× K,
but has significant contributions from much lower and much hotter lines. The third band is
dominated in active regions by Fexv at × K, but otherwise by transition-region lines. The
last band is dominated by the He ii chromospheric line 304 Å, but off-limb it is dominated by
the coronal line Si xii.
The Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) can observe the solar corona from its
base out to 10 R⊙. The UVCS spectroscopic diagnostics are based on the measurement of the
intensities and spectral line profiles of resonantly and Thompson scattered H i Lyman-α, the
collisionally excited and resonantly scattered Li-like resonance lines of O vi (1032 and 1037 Å);
it can alsodetect other coronal lines such as Si xii (499 and 521 Å) and Fe xii (1242 Å) andis rich

corona obtained by multiple UVCS slit positions around the Sun.
The Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) is a wide-field, white-light coron-
agraph which has provided images of the solar corona from 1.1 to 30 R⊙with different fields
of view (C1, C2, C3) and in several wavelength bands in the visible 5,300–6,000 Å. LASCO
has provided fascinating observations of streamers, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and many
other large-scale dynamic phenomena. One image is shown in >Fig. 3-19.
In addition, SoHO carries an instrument for studying the photosphere: measuring the pho-
tospheric magnetic field and carrying out helioseismology studies. The Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI) uses a pair of tunable Michelson interferometers to record filtergrams. Polarizers
are inserted to measure the line of sight, i.e., the longitudinal component of the magnetic field
from the Zeeman splitting of the Ni i 6768 Å line with higher resolution (in a central region) or
lower resolution (on the full Sun, cf. >Fig. 3-20 left).
First results from SoHO were published in a special issue ofSolarPhysics in 1997. There have
been many SoHO workshops, focusing on particular topics, during which results from different

instruments have been presented and published, starting with the First SoHO workshop held
in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1992. One of the particularly successful SoHO workshops was held
at St Andrew’s University, Scotland in 2004.
3.5 Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE)
The Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) is a very successful NASA small-
explorer mission launched in April 2001. The instrument comprises a Cassegrain telescope to
observe the solar corona in three EUV wavelength bands (similar to the SoHO/EIT ones), cen-
tered around: 171 Å; 195 Å; 284 Å. It also images the H I Lyman-alpha (1,216 Å), C IV (1,550 Å)
and UV continuum (1,600 Å), and white light (5,000 Å). TRACE’s unprecedented high spatial
resolution (of approximately 1′′, see >Fig. 3-20, right) and cadence (down to 10 s) render this
instrument suitable for observing the detailed dynamics of the solar corona.
3.6 Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is a NASA mission
launched in February 2002 designed to study the particle acceleration and energy release in
solar flares. Since its launch, the mission has been providing ground-breaking imaging and
spectroscopymeasurements from soft X-rays togamma rays. RHESSI’s uniquelyhigh sensitivity
at energies 3–15 keV enables studies of large flares, but also small-scale thermal and nonthermal
emissions to much lower levels than ever before, from features such as micro-flares.
Obtaining images of high-energy emission from solar flares is extremely difficult. Sophisti-
cated software has been developed to enable X-ray images to be reconstructed from the RHESSI
data (see, e.g., >Fig. 3-21). RHESSI also provides high spectral resolution. Spectral fitting tech-
niques enable measurements of the physical parameters (temperature and emission measure)
describing the hottest part of the thermal plasma. RHESSI observes thermal free-free and free-
bound continuum together with emission lines emitted in the X-ray range 5–20 keV by flare
plasmas with temperatures from approximately 7 MK to tens of MK. Furthermore, nonthermal
plasma emission can be characterized by fitting models such as bremsstrahlung from a power-
law mean electron distribution. An example of a RHESSI spectrum acquired during a small
pre-flare brightening is shown in >Fig. 3-22 (Chifor 2008). The ability to measure and image the
Fe line complexes provides an additional powerful plasma diagnostic, needed to help separate
the thermal and nonthermal continuum and obtain accurate energy estimates.
3.7 CORONAS Missions
CORONAS-F, launched in 2001, carried a suite of 15 instruments. It provided XUV monochro-
maticfull-Sun imaging and XUVspectroscopywith the SPIRIT and RESIK suite ofinstruments.
One of the SPIRIT instruments provided images in the Mg xii doublet, formed at a tempera-
ture of about 8 MK. A new class of highly dynamic plasma structures were discovered with
various characteristic sizes and lifetimes, which still await an explanation (Zhitnik et al. 2003).

sons, one being that line-to-continuum measurements can be used for absolute abundance
determinations (see >Sect. 7).
Full-Sun imaging and XUV spectroscopy have also recently been provided by CORONAS-
Photon (launched in 2009) with the THESIS and SPHINX suite of instruments.
3.8 Hinode
On September 23, 2006, a satellite called Hinode was successfully launched. Hinode (Japanese
for sunrise) is a highly sophisticated satellite equipped with three advanced solar telescopes: the
EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), the X-Ray Telescope (XRT), and the Solar Optical Telescope
(SOT). Positioned in a Sun-synchronous orbit, the mission provides continuous monitoring
of the solar activity without interruption for 8 months a year. The instruments mounted on
Hinode are used as an integrated observatoryaimed at understanding the magneticconnectivity
between the photosphere and the corona, with particular emphasis on the phenomena of solar
activity, including structure, dynamics, plasma heating, and transient events.
The Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) is a UK (Mullard Space Science Labo-
ratory) led instrument, and the first EUV solar spectrometer capable of obtaining high spectral
resolution data with both high spatial and temporal resolution. The EIS wavelength bands,
170–211 Å and 246–292 Å, cover a wide range of temperatures, from chromospheric to flare
temperatures (log T (MK) = .−.) with a spatial resolution of about 3′′. The high spec-
tral resolution allows velocity measurements of a few km/s. High spectral resolution images
(maximum FOV: × .arcmin) can be obtained by rastering with one of the narrow slits
(1′′ or 2′′). In addition, monochromatic images at a high cadence can be obtained using a slot
(40′′ or 266′′).
> Figure 3-24 shows a sample average spectrum obtained with EIS for an active region
(Young et al. 2007). EIS contributes to achieving the goals of the Hinode mission by provid-
ing the capability of measuring the physical properties of plasma, such as its temperature and

line widths). The ten times greater effective areas than previous spectrometers, coupled with a
higher data rate than was available from previous SoHO instruments (such as CDS) allow for
high-cadence studies of transient phenomena to be undertaken.
The Hinode/X-ray Telescope was designed to provide an unprecedented combination of
spatial and temporal resolution in solar coronal studies. A primary purpose of the Hinode XRT
is toobserve the generation, transport, and emergence ofsolarmagneticfields, as well as the ulti-
mate dissipation of magnetic energy in forms such as flares and micro-flares, coronal heating,
and coronal mass ejections. High-resolution soft X-ray images reveal magnetic field configura-
tion and its evolution, allowing one to observe the energy build up, storage and release process
in the corona for any transient event. One of the unique features of XRT is its wide temperature
coverage (1–20 MK) through nine X-ray filters, with 2′′ spatial resolution (see, e.g., >Fig. 3-25).
XRT images complement the spectroscopic observations from EIS, by enabling higher cadence
and a wider (up to full-Sun) field of view.
The Solar Optical Telescope was designed to provide photometric and vector magnetic
images of the photosphere and chromosphere with unprecedented high resolution (see,
e.g., >Fig. 3-26) for a long time (ground-based observations can achieve similar resolutions
but are limited by seeing). The instrument comprises the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA)
consisting of a Gregorian telescope, and the Focal Plane Package (FPP) including a narrow-
band (NFI) and a wide-band (BFI) filtergram, plus a Stokes spectro-polarimeter (SP). The time
cadence ranges from tens of seconds for both photometric images and vector magnetograms
in selected NFI lines to a few hours for a wide-field scan with SP. The maximum field of view is

from the Hinode satellite have been published in special issues of the PASJ, Science, and A&A
journals in 2007 and 2008.

The SolarTErrestrial RElations Observatory(STEREO)is a NASAmission launched in October
2006. The mission comprises the two nearly identical observatories – one Ahead (A) of Earth
in its orbit, the other trailing Behind (B), designed to reveal the 3D structure of solar active
regions and CMEs. The two spacecraft were launched together and used gravity assistance from
the moon to slingshot the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit. They drift away from Earth at an
average rate of about 22.5○per year. Mounted on each of the STEREO spacecraft are four instru-
ment packages: SECCHI, SWAVES, IMPACT, and PLASTIC. Sun Earth Connection Coronal
and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) comprises four instruments: an Extreme Ultraviolet
Imager (EUVI), two white-light coronagraphs (COR1 and COR2), and a wide angle imaging
system for viewing the inner heliosphere (HI1 and HI2). EUVI has a field of view out to 1.7
solar radii, and has four channels (similar to the SoHO/EIT ones) (see >Fig. 3-27). The other
instruments on STEREO sample the plasma, solar wind, and CMEs.

3.10 Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched in February 2010 and is providing full-
Sun, multiwavelength observations with excellent spatial and temporal resolution. Full-disk
magnetic field information is provided from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager(HMI). The
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) provides an unprecedented view of the solar corona, tak-
ing images that span at least 1.3 solar diameters in 10 wavelength ranges almost simultaneously,
at a resolution of approx 1′′ and a cadence of about 10 s. One example set of images in four pass-
bands is given in >Fig. 3-28. Combined with spectroscopic data from existing instruments, the
SDO observations promise to advance our knowledge of both small-scale and large-scale solar
activity.
The SDO EVE instrument includes two spectrographs and multiple photometers providing
the solar EUV irradiance with an unprecedented wavelength range (1–1,220 Å) and temporal
resolution (10 s). The EVE spectra are from the Multiple EUV Grating Spectrographs (MEGS)
and have about 1 Å spectral resolution. The MEGS A channel is a grazing incidence spectro-
graph for the 50–380 Å range, and the MEGS B channel is a double-pass normal incidence

on board a rocket on April 14, 2008.
3.11 Imaging Versus Spectroscopic Instruments
In order to understand the physical conditions which lead to small and large-scale features of
the solar atmosphere, it is essential to determine the local plasma parameters (temperature,
density, abundance, flows, magnetic field, etc.) as a function of space and time. This can only be
achieved by combining both multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic observations of the
solar atmosphere.
Imaging observations (from instruments such as SoHO/EIT, TRACE, Hinode/XRT,
STEREO/EUVI, SDO/AIA etc.) generally provide a higher spatial resolution and cadence,
with a wider FOV than spectroscopic observations (e.g., rasters which use a narrow slit when
building up images). On the other hand, spectroscopic observations from instruments such as
SoHO/CDS and Hinode/EIS are capable of observing individual spectral lines which provide
both line profiles and line intensities.
Phillips et al. (2008) provide a recent review of solar UV and X-ray spectroscopy. Spectral
line profiles provide information about the line shift (Doppler motion) and line width (from
which thermal and nonthermal broadenings can be determined). The intensities of the spec-
tral lines from some ions are sensitive to electron temperature or electron density. These may
be used as diagnostics to probe the physical properties of the solar plasma, including tempera-
ture distributions, densities, filling factors (indicating to what extent the observed features are
spatially resolved), and elemental abundances.
The vast array of solar instrumentation over the past three decades has enabled us to exam-
ine the solar atmosphere in microscopic detail, which sometimes seems overwhelming. It is a
great challenge to be able to explain the dynamic and transient nature of the solar atmosphere.

The Lower Solar Atmosphere
4.1 The Photosphere and the Sun’s Magnetic Field
For a detailed description of the photosphere see Thomas and Weiss (2008). The most promi-
nent feature of the photosphere are the sunspots. Detailed observations of sunspots have been
obtained by Zürich Observatory since 1849 and the Royal Greenwich Observatory since 1874.
These records include information on the size and position of sunspots as well as the num-
ber. Various aspects of sunspots have been defined and used as a proxy of solar variability.
The first was introduced by Rudolf Wolf of the Zürich Observatory, the Wolf Sunspot Num-
ber WSN = c(G + N),where G is the number of sunspot groups, N the number of individual
ones, and c a constant factor. Many different observations existed before 1849, and efforts have
been ongoing to build a more complete sample. One noteworthy example is that of Hoyt and
Schatten (1998), who defined a Group Sunspot Number (GSN) and collected all archival data
available at the time.
Heinrich Schwabe in 1844 was the first to indicate the presence of a solar cycle in the
observed variations of the number of sunspot groups. In the second half of the nineteenth

⊡Fig. 3-29
The solar butterﬂy diagram
century it was noted by both Carrington and Spörer that as the cycle progresses, sunspots
appear first at mid-latitudes, and then closer and closer to the equator until solar minimum
is reached. This pattern is best visualized in the form of the so-called butterfly diagram, the first
version of which was elegantly produced by Maunder in 1904, using data he collected together
with his wife. A butterfly diagram obtained from a collection of data (rescaled and adjusted by
David Hathaway.1) is shown in >Fig. 3-29. Sunspots for a new solar cycle tend to appear at
midlatitudes while larger, more isolated sunspots from the previous cycle still persist.
Hale was the first, in 1908, to measure magnetic fields on the Sun (in sunspots where it is
strongest, up to several 1,000 G). He also showed in 1919 that the orientation of the magnetic
field is opposite in the northern and southern hemisphere and that the orientation of the polar-
ities changes every 11 years during a solar cycle. During solar minimum, the solar magnetic
field is approximately dipolar. Sunspots tend to be bipolar and slightly tilted compared to the
direction of solar rotation (approximately east-west). The polar fields were also found to invert
their polarity (Joy’s law).
Magnetic flux emergence occurs continuously everywhere on the Sun. Magnetic fragments
of opposite polarity tend to emerge and separate in the east-west direction. Sunspots normally
form after the coalescence of magnetic fragments, and predominantly in the leading polarity
(the western one). Sunspots appear dark because their temperature is much lower than the
surroundings, an effect caused by the strong magnetic field (convection beneath the sunspot is
inhibited). Most sunspots have an umbra and a penumbra, together with an associated (bright)
plage area. Small bipolar regions continuously emerge at all latitudes on the Sun. This was seen
clearly with the SoHO/MDI observations. The whole magnetic carpet for the quiet Sun was
found to be replaced over approximately 40 h. The better the spatial and temporal resolution
which is achieved in the observations, the more dynamic the Sun appears. For example, the
Hinode/SOT observations show flux emergence and cancellation occurring on spatial scales
smaller than 1′′, and with temporal cadence of minutes or less.
On closer inspection the apparently smooth surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is seen to
actually be made up of many small granules each of around 15–2,500 km across. >Figure 3-30
shows as an example a recent image from the Hinode SOT instrument. Time sequences of
images show that these granules are in continuous motion. Granules last on average 18 min,

and are formed by convection – upward motions of hotter material which then cools and falls
back down in the intergranular lanes (observed as dark channels). Relative velocities of the up-
and down-flows are only about 2 km/s.
There are also large-scale motions that form the supergranular pattern. Slow (0.4 km/s),
almost horizontal flow from the center of cells, which are about 30,000 km in size, brings struc-
tures toward a boundary, where downflows of about 0.1 km/s are observed (Leighton et al.
1962).
The typical strength of magnetic flux elements in the supergranular cell centers is of the
order of 10–20 G. About 90% of the emergent magnetic flux is located in the network, with
discrete elements that have strengths up to two orders of magnitude higher (Stenflo 1989).
The region of the upper photosphere and chromosphere extends up to several thousand
kilometer above the visible surface. Here, the density and pressure decrease with a scale height
of only a few 100 km. The magnetic flux elements naturally expand their horizontal cross section
to keep the pressure balance with the surrounding plasma. Within this layer, it is predicted that
most flux tubes would either merge with flux of the same polarity or connect to nearby flux
elements of opposite polarity to form the so-called magnetic canopy.
A significant amount of information is obtained from imaging and spectroscopy of the pho-
tosphere in the visible light. Some examples (oscillations, chemical abundances) are provided
later in this chapter. However, to achieve a good understanding of what is observed, detailed
modeling which includes radiative transfer effects is needed. This is beyond the scope of this
chapter.

4.2 The Chromosphere
The chromosphere is the thin region above the photosphere, discovered during eclipse observa-
tions through a flash spectrum. Chromospheric jets, spicules, and prominences are often readily
visible to the naked eye at the solar limb during an eclipse, having a distinctive pink-red color,
mostly arising from the strong neutral hydrogen Hα and Hβ lines in emission (see >Fig. 3-31).
In the visible, the chromosphere is observable in the strong neutral hydrogen Hα and
in the singly ionized Ca ii H and K lines, which are formed mostly in the middle/higher
chromosphere. These lines, in on-disk observations, show wide absorption profiles, which are
occasionally self-reversed (e.g., in emission) in the core. A detailed understanding of the Ca ii
H and K line profiles requires in-depth modeling which takes into account radiative trans-
fer, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), and nonequilibrium ionization effects, not
discussed in this chapter. Further recommended reading is Athay (1976), Athay and Thomas
(1961), Judge (2006), Rutten (2007).
In on-disk observations, these lines show an extremely fine structure, organized in a super-
granular cell-network pattern (see >Fig. 3-32), and also very dynamic small-scale activity. At
the limb, spicules are observed (see, e.g., > Figs. 3-33, and >3-34).
Father Secchi SJ was the first one to make regular spectroscopic observations of the Sun, in
particular of the chromosphere. He discovered the solar spicules, dynamic jets about 10,000 km
long and 500 km wide, with short lifetimes (10–20 min), and with upward velocities of about
20 km/s (although even higher velocities, up to 100km/s, have been recently reported using new
high-resolution HINODE observations). These spicules tend to either fall back or fade from
view. The entire chromosphere is dominated by them, indeed it is estimated that at any one
time there are 70,000–400,000 spicules on the Sun. This is the reason why Secchi termed them
prateria ardente (burning fields). Since Secchi, the dynamical character of the chromosphere has

been explored extensively, for example, by Hinode/SOT (see >Fig. 3-34). The chromosphere in
coronal holes is similar, although there is the tendencytohave a few macro-spicules, i.e., spicules
much more extendedin length. Interestingly, the thickness of the chromosphere increases at the
poles during solar minimum conditions.
Cool “chromospheric” material is often found also at coronal heights, the most prominent
example being quiet Sun or active region filaments, seen in absorption in on-disk observations,
and in emission when observed above the limb called prominences (see >Fig. 3-35).
Nowadays, the chromosphere is believedto be the fundamental supplier of mass and energy
to the corona, and is also the place where large part of the coronal thermal energy, transferred
via thermal conduction and enthalpy, is radiated.
In the UV, observations of the continuum and emission lines provide detailed information
about the chromosphere. The H i Ly α alone radiates most of the energy emitted at chromo-
spheric temperatures, which is an enormous amount, about 100 times the total energy required
to power the extended solar corona. Other EUV-UV emission lines from neutral and singly
ionized elements, in particular He, O, C, and Si, also contribute significantly.
In broad terms, chromospheric emission from the Sun arises from plasma at temperatures
between 7,000 K and 25,000 K. The chromosphere is a complex region where hydrogen and
the other elements become ionized (hydrogen becomes fully ionized around 20,000 K), and
where chemical fractionation processes occurs (see the chemical abundance > Sect. 7). The
lower chromosphere has a similar behaviour to the photosphere, being mostly dominated by

⊡Fig. 3-35
The “grand dad”prominence eruption as seen in 1945 in hydrogen Hα
hydrodynamics. The upper chromosphere (above 1,300 km), on the other hand, is more like
the corona, in that the morphology and dynamics of structures (mostly spicules) appear loop-
like, being dominated by the magnetic fields. In fact, chromospheric emission is much brighter
at the supergranular cell boundaries, where magnetic elements converge, having been advected
by the supergranular flows (see >Sect. 4.1).
Unfortunately, because of the many observational and theoretical complexities, a unified
physical explanation ofthe chromosphere in general, and ofspicules in particular, is still lacking.
Many theories have been proposed for the formation of spicules, such as shocks resulting from
the granular buffeting of flux tubes (e.g., Roberts 1979) and of course magnetic reconnection
(e.g., Pikel’Ner 1969; Tziotziou et al. 2003). Another addition to the formation theories is the
suggestion (see, e.g., De Pontieu et al. 2004; Suematsu 1990) that spicules form as a result of
shocks which arise from the leakage of 5-min p-mode oscillations along tilted field lines in the
Sun’s surface.
Waves with periods of about 3 min are present in the chromospheric inter-network regions
(see >Sect. 5.2). It was originally proposed that these are standing acoustic modes reflecting
within the walls of a cavity formed by the temperature structure of the chromosphere. It was also
thought that these p-modes in the chromosphere are not important because the waves could
not propagate outside the cavity, howevera clear relation between photospheric and lower chro-
mospheric oscillations is observed. Also, some evidence for the presence of traveling waves was
found in Skylab data (see the review in Mariska 1992). SoHO SUMER has provided a wealth of
observations of photospheric and chromospheric lines and oscillations, which have stimulated
modeling. For example, Carlsson and Stein (1997) developed a 1D hydrodynamic model where
they studied the response of the lower chromosphere driven by a piston calculated to match
the observed variations in a photospheric line. The piston induces the upward propagation of

122 3

3-min compressive waves and a shock near 1,000 km above the photosphere. As a result, the
inter-network chromosphere below 1,300 km oscillates in response to the p modes. The results
of the modeling are in agreement with chromospheric observations, which is a significant
progress.
4.3 The Transition Region
In the quiet Sun, the transition region (TR) is clearly observed in emission lines formed between
0.3 and 0.9 MK. The upper TR is the region where lines between 0.6 and 0.9 MK are formed.
The emission is optically thin in lines formed above 0.4 MK. Eclipse and spatially resolved
observations have shown that the thickness of the TR in the quiet Sun is only about 2,000 km.
Observations at the solar limb clearly show the limb brightening, an increase in intensity (den-
sity), due to the increased line of sight across the transition region. Limb observations show
that lines formed at higher temperatures have peak emission at progressively greater heights.
Observations on the solar disk instead show that the TR emission is mostly concentrated in the
supergranular network, where photospheric magnetic fragments of opposite polarity continu-
ously coalesce. This has been known for a long time (see, e.g., the Skylab ATM observations,
Reeves 1976) and has been very clearly shown from SoHO observations (see, e.g. >Fig. 3-36).
On-disk observations also show that emission from the quiet Sun at higher temperatures
becomes more and more diffuse, until it reaches 1 MK when it becomes totally unresolved
at the best spatial resolution (1′′). Interestingly, there is no significant difference between the
transition region in the quiet Sun and in coronal holes.
Some authors (e.g., Feldman1983 and subsequent papers) have argued that the TR is mostly
composed of unresolved fine structures (UFS) which do not physically connect the chromo-
spheric structures with the coronal ones. This view is hotly debated,and future instrumentation
with veryhigh spatial and temporal resolution might be needed toclarifythis issue. It is however
clear that the majority of lower-temperature structures appear to be low-lying, as also shown
in Landi et al. (2000), where more details of the quiet Sun TR in the supergranular network
can be found. It is also interesting to note that the only coronal structures easily resolvable in

the corona, such as coronal hole plumes and coronal loops, do show a clear connection from
chromospheric to coronal temperatures (Del Zanna 2003; Del Zanna et al. 2003).
At high resolution, the TR emission is structured in fine-structure emission similar to the
chromospheric plasma (spicules). Dere et al. (1987) used HRTS measurements to show that
chromospheric and TR spicular structures are the same, however this does not seem to always
be the case. Dere et al. (1987) also measured very small filling factors for the TR at 10K of the
order of 10−(see >Sect. 6.9), which is interpreted by many as evidence that this region has a
filamentary structure.
Early static models of the solar atmosphere (see, e.g., the book by Mariska (1992)) pro-
posed a plane parallel model with the existence of a thin layer, the transitions region (TR), with
the presence of constant conductive flux from the corona toward the chromosphere, covering
temperatures between say 0.3 and 1 MK. The first more physically realistic model of the TR was
that of Gabriel (1976), as shown in >Fig. 3-37. The strong magnetic fields at the supergranular
boundaries exert a strong magnetic pressure, which naturally forces a very large expansion of
the strong field, which occupies the majority of space in a small height (1,500 km). The model
had various assumptions, one of which was that the supergranular cell had a unipolar mag-
netic field, something not confirmed by observations. A more refined model was proposed by
Dowdy et al. (1986), where only a fraction of the lower-lying magnetic structures would reach
the corona.
Models of a static plane parallel TR have now become obsolete, mainly because the TR is
now known to be very dynamic, in terms of line intensity variations and Doppler motions.
However, a clear physical picture of the TR has still not fully emerged.
Transition region spectra are characterized by line profiles much broader than their ther-
mal width. The excess broadening varies with the temperature of formation of the line
(see > Sect. 6.12). Observations have been obtained by Skylab (Kjeldseth Moe and Nicolas
1977), rocket instruments (e.g., HRTS, see Dere and Mason 1993), and more recently with
SoHO SUMER. The nature of this excess broadening puts constraints on possible heating
processes.

Dopplershifts measured in the transition region
At transition-region temperatures, lines appear red-shifted (see, e.g., >Fig. 3-38), as shown
from the spectrometers aboard OSO 8, the HRTS flights, Skylab, and more recently from the
CDS and SUMER aboard SoHO and EIS on Hinode. Stellar UV spectra show the same pat-
tern, which has been considered a puzzle for a long time. Many solar measurements were
limited because either did not have good spatial resolution, or they were confined to small
regions (Sunspots), or only considered the center-to-limb behavior of the quiet Sun (see, e.g.,
Peter and Judge 1999). It was only with routine measurements from EIS on Hinode that it
became clear that almost all active region loops exhibit strong redshifts in both legs (Del Zanna
2007, 2008).
>Figure 3-39 shows one example. The redshifts at below 1 MK are ubiquitous,
sustained, and become stronger toward the footpoints of the loop structures.
These redshifts are possibly the signature of plasma that is cooling and flowing back toward
the chromosphere. Indeed, from theoretical considerations, the lifetime of a plasma that is cool-
ing is much longer than the lifetime of a low-density plasma that is suddenly heated. Cooling
plasma in the corona is dense and therefore readily observable. The cooling is mostly due to
energy lost by radiation that freely escapes and by the enthalpy flux. In fact, the enthalpy flux
(Bradshaw 2008; Pneuman and Kopp 1978) is a considerable mechanism by which energy
can be transferred from the corona to the chromosphere. Indeed the energy transferred by
thermal conduction is estimated to be a small fraction of the energy required to sustain the
chromospheric radiative losses.

The Interior of the Sun
5.1 The Standard Model and the Solar Neutrinos
The standard solar model assumes that the Sun is a spherically symmetric nonrotating star. The
energy produced by nuclear fusion in the core is transferred by radiation until it reaches the
outer 30% region of the solar interior. In this region, the radiative gradient exceeds the adia-
batic one, and the gas becomes unstable to convection. The convection is observed in the solar
photosphere in the form of the granular and the supergranular motions.
The standard model equations are integrated in time from a set of initial conditions in
order to match the observed mass, luminosity, diameter, and chemical composition of the Sun
at this time. The five structural variables are pressure, opacity coefficient, energy production
rate, entropy, and adiabatic exponent, all of which are functions of density, temperature, and
chemical abundance.
The age of the Sun is estimated to be 4.6 billion years. Knowledge of the chemical com-
position of the Sun and stars is nontrivial as discussed in >Sect. 7. In particular, the helium
abundance of the Sun is not well known. Moreover, it is not clear if the chemical abundances
measured at the photosphere are representative of those inside the Sun. The convective motions
should maintain sufficient mixing, however diffusion and gravitational settling are also present
and could alter the internal composition. The current mass loss of the Sun through the solar
wind and eruptions such as coronal mass ejections is negligible, however it is unclear how this
has changed with time. The Sun is a relatively slow rotator, however it is likely that this is due
to loss of angular momentum via the solar wind, magnetically coupled to the outer convection
zone (see the book by Mestel 1999). In fact all young stars are fast rotators.
The rate of energy generation depends on the various ways in which hydrogen is converted
into helium by fusion:

for interaction with matter. The energy carried away by the neutrinos is small (about 3%)
compared to the total energy released. The neutrinos offer a beautiful link between different
branches of physics. The standard hydrodynamic equations, together with atomic physics cal-
culations which provide the opacity term, can predict the status of the solar interior, defining
its overall characteristics. Nuclear physics can predict the energy released by fusion and the
number of neutrinos produced. We cannot easily measure the status of the solar core; however
measurements of neutrinos can confirm the predictions of the various theories. Details about
the observations of neutrinos and their relevance for the solar standard model can be found in
the book Neutrino Astrophysics by J.N.Bahcall.
The most efficient path is the pp chain, where a continuum of low-energy (<0.4 MeV) neu-
trinos is produced. In the Be chain, mono-energetic neutrinos are produced. In the B chain,
a continuum of high-energy neutrinos is produced. The number of neutrinos at 1 AU is about
×cm−s−. Over the last four decades, various experiments have measured the number of
solar neutrinos. Results are normally summarized in terms of the Solar Neutrino Units (SNU),
which correspond to 10−reactions per target atom per second. The first experiment was in
the Homestake Gold Mine, South Dakota, and led by R. Davis and J.N. Bahcall, following a
suggestion from B. Pontecorvo to use chlorine: νe+Cl→Ar+ e−. The first measurements
in 1968 gave 3 SNU. The average of results from 1970 to 1995 gave 2.56±0.16SNU. This exper-
iment is sensitive to high-energy neutrinos, and hence sensitive to the central temperature in
the core of the Sun. Standard models predict about 8 SNU for the high-energy neutrinos. This
large discrepancy was termed the “solar neutrino problem”.
The Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments, which measured neutrino scatter-
ing on electrons in water, also only detected the high-energy neutrinos. The result was a flux
smaller by about a factor of 2 than that predicted by the standard model.
Detection of the lower-energy neutrinos has been made possible by using gallium as a target.
The GALLEX/GNO (Gran Sasso laboratory, Italy) and SAGE (Baskan underground laboratory,
Caucasus) experiments have yielded values of 77.5/62.9 and 70.8 SNU respectively, again much
lower (by almost a factor of 2) than estimated for lower-energy neutrinos (see the review of
Dore and Orestano 2008).
A possible solution to the problem came with the idea first introduced by B. Pontecorvo in
the 1950s that neutrinos might have mass, and interact with matter by oscillating between the
three different types, the electron, muon, and tau neutrino. Details ofthe oscillation as neutrinos
interact with matter were published in the 1970s and 80s.
In 2001–2002, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (Ontario, Canada) measured high-
energy neutrinos interacting with deuterium and producing Cherenkov radiation. The exper-
iment can measure processes which are sensitive to the different neutrino flavors. Results
confirm the predictions based on the neutrino oscillation theory. The same holds for recent
measurements from the Borexino experiment (Dore and Orestano 2008). It therefore appears
that the solar neutrino problem has been solved. The missing neutrinos were electron neutrinos
which had changed to other types on their way to Earth. They therefore escaped detection.
5.2 Solar Oscillations
The first complete observations of solar oscillations were obtained by Leighton et al. (1962).
Oscillations with periods of about 5 min in the local Doppler velocity in photospheric
absorption lines were observed. The amplitude of the velocity oscillation was about 0.5 km/s,

which is the result of a random combination of a large number (10) of individual modes, with
a large degree of spatial and temporal coherence. Single modes have tiny velocity amplitudes of
less than 20 cm/s. In terms of the relative intensity variation, this corresponds to a few part per
million, hence is very difficult to observe. The same observations revealed the supergranular
scales in the photosphere.
Ulrich (1970) proposed that these oscillations were due to standing acoustic waves in the
solar interior. The theory was further developed by Stein and Leibacher (1974). Deubner (1975)
found the predicted ridges in the wavenumber frequency diagram. Each ridge corresponds to a
fixed number of nodes in the radial direction (n, see below). Claverie et al. (1979) first reported
the 5-min oscillations at low angular, l, degree from full-Sun Dopplergrams.
Solar-like oscillations in other stars are very difficult to observe because of their very small
amplitudes. However, significant advances in instrumentation have been achieved in the search
for extrasolar planets. Accurate radial-velocity measurements are now routinely carried out,
to search for signals caused by the motion in the star induced by the gravitational effect of
a planet. A number of ground-based observations have found that stars other than the Sun,
as expected, also exhibit oscillations. New spacecraft have been launched or are planned in
this field of astrophysics. For example, the French-led ESA satellite Convection, Rotation and
planetary Transits (CoRoT) has been obtaining data since 2007 from a number of stars and has
been measuring stellar oscillations.
Chromospheric lines also show oscillations, clustered around 3 min. These oscillations are
characteristic of propagating waves rather than the evanescent waves observed in the pho-
tosphere. The modes are spatially coherent and long lasting, hence observations are needed
over extended periods of time. Various ground-based networks have been established to study
solar oscillations. They often observe the Sun as a star, revealing truly global oscillations.
The Birmingham Solar Oscillation Network (BiSON) was established in 1981 and carries out
disk-averaged velocity observations by means of potassium-vapor resonant-scattering cells.
This provides very accurate measurements of the low degree modes. An example of a power
spectrum is shown in >Fig. 3-40. The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) has been
operational since 1995. Other important observations of low-l modes have come from the
LOWL instrument. These ground-based observations are important because they provide long-
term records. From these measurements, it has been found that the frequencies of oscillations
vary with the solar cycle, for reasons yet to be understood.
SoHO carries three helioseismic instruments. GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Fre-
quency)was designed as a resonant scattering Doppler-velocityinstrument using sodium vapor,
but has suffered some technical problems. VIRGO (Variability of solar Irradiance and Gravity
Oscillations) measures disk-integrated and low-resolution intensities in three different wave-
length regions. SOI/MDI (Solar Oscillations Investigation Michelson Doppler Imager)provides
observations of Doppler velocities over the entire solar disk with a spatial resolution of 2′′.
SDO/HMI is now providing measurements with a spatial resolution of 0.5′′.
The theory of solar oscillations is complex, however the basic characteristics can be
obtained by adopting some basic approximations. Readers are referred to Leibacher and
Stein (1981), Christensen-Dalsgaard (2002), Stix (2002); and references therein for more
details.
To a first approximation, the rotation and small asphericity of the Sun can be neglected. We
know that the timescales for the oscillations are very short when compared to the timescales
for energy transport, even the fast timescales given by convection. So, a common assumption
is for the oscillations to be adiabatic.

The amplitude of the oscillations is really tiny, when compared to the size of the Sun, so we
are only interested in the linear variations of density and pressure, i.e., small variations around
equilibrium. The basichydrodynamicequations are linearized and a search is made fora station-
ary solution. The equations become greatly simplified when the approximation due to Cowling
(1941) is adopted. Cowling’s idea was that the effect of the oscillations on the gravity can be
neglected.
During the analytical derivation, three fundamental frequencies are found. The first is the
acoustic cutoff frequency ωa = γg/cs, where γ = /for a perfect fully ionized, g is the local
gravity, and cs the sound speed. The second is the frequency of the gravity waves ωg (known
as Brunt–Väisälä frequency), which is the natural frequency of oscillation of a plasma element
displaced from equilibrium in the presence of gravity. The third is the Lamb frequency ωL, the
frequency of a horizontally propagating sound wave.
By searching for a local solution in terms of a plane wave for the velocity ⃗υ ≃ei(⃗k⋅⃗r−ωt),
dispersion relations can be found between the frequency of oscillation ω and the wavenum-
ber k. Different dispersion relations are obtained when e.g., radial or oblique oscillations are
considered.
>Figure 3-41 (left) presents a diagnostic diagram obtained for a simple isothermal atmo-
sphere, i.e., frequencies versus the horizontal wavenumber kx. Shaded areas are regions where
waves can propagate. For ω > ωa > ωg we have acoustic waves that propagate radially, named
p-modes by Cowling. They are fundamentally acoustic waves modified by the gravity field.
These waves can propagate radially only if their frequency is higher than ωa. In other
words, acoustic waves that oscillate too slowly are not allowed to propagate because of
the presence of the density stratification created by the gravity. At large wavenumbers, the

p-modes are bound by the asymptotic Lamb frequency ωL = cskh. The propagation speed for
the high-frequency p-modes is the sound speed cs. Since their discovery on the Sun, p-modes
have received much attention, because it was thought that they could significantly contribute
to the heating of the chromosphere.
For ω < ωg < ωa we have the g-modes, which are internal gravity waves, i.e., waves for which
the restoring force is the Archimedean buoyancy (still, modified by the fact that the gas is com-
pressible). At large wavenumbers, the g-modes are bounded by the Brunt-Väisälä ωg frequency,
and by the Lamb frequency ωL = cskx at low wavenumbers. The g-modes are essentially trans-
verse waves, like the waves on the surface of the sea. There have been contradicting reports
about observations of g-modes, and no convincing evidence has yet been found, because of the
great difficulty in observing them.
The fundamental modes (f-modes) are located in the evanescent-wave region, between the
p- and g-modesand are essentially surface gravity waves, i.e., modes without compression. They
are observed at large wavenumbers and their dispersion relation is ω≃gskx where gs is the
local surface gravity and kx the horizontal wavenumber. They are indicated in >Fig. 3-41 (left)
as the divergence-free modes, because ∇⋅⃗υ = .
The sound speed is directly related to the temperature (cs ∼
√
T for an isothermal
atmosphere), so the rapid changes of the temperature with height across the photosphere–
chromosphere produce large variations in the sound speed, hence in the acoustic cutoff and
Lamb frequencies. As shown in the diagnostic diagram, this in turn can affect the propaga-
tion of the acoustic waves. The lower photosphere and upper chromosphere act as two cavities
where the acoustic waves become significantly trapped (see >Fig. 3-41, right). The tempera-
ture reaches a minimum at around 4500 K, and acoustic modes with periods larger than 3 min
and large l become trapped in the photosphere. Acoustic waves also become trapped in the
chromosphere when they have periods of 3 min or longer.
The stationary solutions (modes) are uniquely characterized by their frequency ω and by
their spatial distribution, i.e., their different pattern on the surface of the Sun. This is character-
ized by two integer numbers, n, l. n is the radial order and represents, to a first approximation,
the number of nodes of the radial part of the solution, while the degree l the number of nodes
of the angular part on a sphere. When solar rotation is introduced, a third azimuthal num-
ber m is required to characterize the solution, and a splitting in the frequencies occurs. Radial
modes, with l = , penetrate to the center, whereas the modes of highest degree observed in the
Sun, with l = , (see >Fig. 3-42), are trapped in the outer shell of the Sun, which occupies
only a small fraction of a percent of the solar radius. In other words, oscillations of different
frequencies probe different layers of the solar interior and carry a great deal of information.
5.3 Some Results from Helioseismology Inversions
The observed frequencies depend on the local values of quantities such as density and temper-
ature in the Sun, and so offer an opportunity to learn more about the solar interior. Densities
and temperatures in turn depend on the local opacity and chemical abundances, as well as the
details of the energy transport. It is therefore possible, with some assumptions and modeling,
to obtain a variety of information from the observed frequencies. The methods and theory are
quite involved, see for example Gough and Toomre (1991), Stix (2002), Christensen-Dalsgaard
(2002); and references therein. The inversion to obtain the internal solar rotation is the simplest
case, since it is linear with the observed splittings in the frequencies.

It has long been known, since the tracking of sunspots (after Galileo), that the solar sur-
face has a differential rotation, with the equatorial regions spinning much faster than the poles.
Inversions of ground-based observations (e.g., BBSO) of oscillations did indicate that the dif-
ferential rotation continued down to the base of the convection zone, but large uncertainties
were present in the interior. SoHO/MDI has confirmed that the change in rotation occurs in
the zonal belts and extends deep into the convection zone.
An important discovery from SoHO/MDI has been that the Sun rotates almost rigidly in the
radiative zone (cf. > Figs. 3-43, and >3-44). These observations were totally unexpected from
previous models,and have recently transformed our understanding on the internal rotation in a
star (see the review of Thompson et al. 2003). The region where strong shear is present, known as
the tachocline, is close to the base of the convection zone (as estimated from inversion methods).
It is now thought to be the region where magnetic fields are created via hydromagnetic dynamo
processes and then transported to the surface by the convective motions. See Tobias and Weiss
(2007), Miesch (2005), Charbonneau (2005), Weiss and Thompson (2009) for details.
SoHO/MDI also confirmed the presence of a meridional flow, from the equator to the poles.
It was previously deduced from ground-based observations, but thanks to MDI it is now clear
that it affects a significant depth of the outer layer of the Sun, down to 10,000 km. The velocity

whilst in the outer layer there is a marked diﬀerential rotation, with the equator rotating faster

of the meridional flow is very slow (about 1%), when compared to the rotation speed, but is
fast enough to recycle material within 1 year, a relatively short timescale, compared to the solar
cycle. Note that the velocity of this flow is opposite to the changes in magnetic field emergence
along the cycle (from high latitudes toward the equator), and it is still not clear what happens

to the flow when it reaches the poles. However, it is clear that the flow must have an important
role for the solar cycle.
Helioseismological inversions to obtain information on the solar structure are more com-
plex, because the relation between frequencies and structural quantities is highly nonlinear.
The inversion methods are normally based on linearizing the equations for the oscillations
(often assumed adiabatic) around a known reference model. The differences between the
observed and computed frequencies are then related via some kernels to two model parameters,
for example density and sound speed. Various inversion techniques are applied to obtain the
variation of the model parameters with radius. The helioseismology results are often presented
as the relative differences between the observed and predicted ones.
One parameter, the sound speed, can be measured accurately and does not depend greatly
on the solar model used. Accurate measurements were obtained from early ground-based
observations, but more accurate ones come from SoHO/MDI. > Figure 3-45 shows the dif-
ference in the square of the sound speed between that obtained from 2 months of MDI data
and the reference solar model “S” of Christensen-Dalsgaard of 1996. These types of differences
are very small but are nonetheless significant, and models are being continuously refined to
reduce them.
Another important parameter for the solar structure that is obtained from helioseismology
is the location of the bottom of the convective zone.
5.4 Abundances and Helioseismic Models
Parameters such as the chemical abundances are more difficult to derive from helioseismology.
The sound speed is directly related to the chemical composition, hence it should possible to
assess whether or not the adopted solar abundances are correct by comparing the variation
of the sound speed as predicted by solar structure models with the observed one. However,

the methods are complex and depend on several physical assumptions, in particular on the
calculation of opacities. For a recent review see Basu and Antia (2008).
Until recently, the predicted sound speed (as a function of depth) from standard solar
models showed very good agreement with the helioseismic values. However, adopting the
reduced photospheric abundances obtained from the new 3-D simulations causes the opacity to
decrease, which in turns reduces the depth of the convection zone, to a level inconsistent with
the seismic estimate. See, for example, Serenelli et al. (2009). It appears that the discrepancies
cannot be resolved, even with the most recent opacity calculations from the Opacity Project,
see Badnell et al. (2005). The He abundance from the latest solar structure modelsis also at odds
with the value inferred from helioseismology. More work is needed in this important area of
research.
5.5 Local Helioseismology
Recent helioseismic techniques such as Ring-analysis, Time-distance and Acoustic-holography
(see review by Gizon and Birch 2005) measure large-scale flows and sound speed perturba-
tions in and around magnetically active regions (see, e.g., >Fig. 3-46). The interaction of flow
fields and observed magnetic fields are important for understanding the stability and long-
term evolution of the active regions. It was also established from the innovative work of Braun
and coworkers (see Braun and Birch 2008 and references therein) that the sunspots and plages
absorb 50–70% of the acoustic power. Unfortunately, it is not clear what changes magnetism
causes to the helioseismically determined flows and sound speeds near and within the active
regions. Some modeling efforts to assess these have only just begun (e.g., Jain et al. 2009).
With the much awaited high-resolution data from the HMI instrument of the Solar Dynamics
Observatory, these are exciting times for local magnetic helioseismology.

5.6 The Solar Dynamo
The issue of the continuous regeneration of the solar magnetic fields is too extensive to be cov-
ered in detail in this review chapter. Readers are referred to reviews such as Weiss (1994), Tobias
(2004), Miesch (2005), Charbonneau (2005), Solanki et al. (2006). As with the coronal heating
problem, many ideas and models have been put forward, but a comprehensive coherent model
based on solid physical grounds is still needed. Even the most advanced computations are still
not sufficient to model both the fine and large-scale structures in the convection zone. The
majorproblem is how toexplain the observed cyclicbehaviorofmagneticfluxemergence on the
Sun. During solar minimum conditions, the solar magnetic field is mainly bipolar (poloidal).
The differential solar rotation stretches the magnetic field lines and creates a toroidal com-
ponent. This occurs because the magnetic field is expected to be frozen-in with the plasma
motions. In the 1950s, E.N. Parker suggested the idea of a turbulent dynamo, i.e., that within
the convection zone, up-flowing volumes of plasma would rotate because of the Coriolis force.
This would twist the toroidal field to produce loops in the poloidal plane. Dynamo mean field
theory was subsequently developed and became very popular. This theory later failed to explain
a variety of features, most importantly the migration patterns and the internal solar rotation as
inferred from helioseismology.
In different approaches, the rearrangement of the solar magnetic fields in the solar corona
plays a major role. In the Babcock–Leighton (Babcock 1961; Leighton 1964, 1969) mechanism,
toroidal field is still produced by the differential rotation of the Sun in the convection zone.
This toroidal component creates largely bipolar sunspots that emerge through the photosphere
by magnetic buoyancy. It is known (Joy’s law) that bipolar sunspots are normally tilted, so when
they decay they tend to create a diffuse poloidal component of the field. The pattern is opposite
in the two hemispheres. One current idea is that these weak diffuse poloidal fields are advected
toward the poles by the meridional circulation and regenerate the solar poloidal field. There is
little doubt now that this occurs on the Sun. What is still not clear is if this is a key component
of the dynamo cycle, or just a consequence of it.
In recent years, the importance of considering further effects occurring in the corona has
been recognized. For example, Fisk and Schwadron (2001) proposed a theory for the evolution
of “open” magnetic flux, by which open field lines continuously reconnect with closed struc-
tures, and are subject to the convective diffusive motions on the solar surface. These diffusive
motions can explain the accumulation of open flux in the polar regions of the Sun during min-
imum, and their reversal from cycle to cycle. As a by-product, the reconnection provides mass
and acceleration to the solar wind. Another process which is clearly occurring on the Sun is
the generation of Coronal Mass Ejections, CMEs, which are global coronal events and can sim-
ilarly rearrange the large-scale solar fields and become important contributors to the 11-year
solar cycle (see, e.g., Low 2001).

Radiation from the Solar Corona: Atomic Processes and Plasma
Diagnostics
Emission lines result from the spontaneous decay of an excited electron within an ion to a
lower energy state, the excess energy being carried off by a photon. The intensity of a par-
ticular emission line as measured by an observer clearly depends on the number of emitting

ions in the line of sight and the fraction of these ions that are in the particular excited state
that gives rise to the spectral line. We are thus interested in both the ionization state of the
plasma and the level balance within an ion. For each atom there is an ongoing competition
between processes changing the ionization state of the ions and processes changing their energy
state.
The outer solar atmosphere consists of a hot, low-density plasma. The corona is a fully ion-
ized plasma, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium fully stripped of their electrons,
while heavier elements are at least partially ionized. Hot coronal plasma itself gives rise to line
as well as to continuum radiation in the UV to X-ray wavelengths. One can also detect the
visible and UV radiation from the lower atmospheric layers, since the low-density corona is
optically thin.
The EUV spectral range (see >Fig. 3-47) is rich in chromospheric lines from He ii, lines
from the transition region, and coronal lines. It also has continuum emission from hydrogen
and helium. The far UV has strong chromospheric lines, the brightest ones being those from
H i, but also lines from the transition region, and a few coronal lines.
In principle, knowing the relevant atomic parameters, at a given temperature and electron
density, one can determine both the ionization state and the energy level balance within an ion.
From this, the intensity of the emission lines and continuum due to bound-bound (from one
energy to another within an atom), bound-free, and free-free electron processes, can be pre-
dicted. In practice, however, the calculations represent a very complex task. For each atom,
there is an ongoing competition between processes changing the ionization (charged) state of
ions (ionization/recombination)on one hand, and processes changing theirenergystate (excita-
tion/decay) on the other hand. All atomic processes are required to balance their corresponding
inverse processes, according to the principle of detailed balance.
Reviews of atomic processes and spectroscopic diagnostics for the solar transition region
and corona are provided by Dere and Mason (1981), Foukal (2004), Gabriel and Mason (1982),
Mariska (1992), Mason and Monsignori Fossi (1994), Del Zanna et al. (2002b), and Phillips
et al. (2008).

6.1 Line Flux and Intensity
When the Sun is observed as a star, the spectral flux (i.e., total irradiance in a line), FT(λ ji), for
an optically thin line of wavelength λi j (frequency νi j =
c
hλi j , where h is Planck’s constant) is
defined as:
FT(λ ji) =

πd∫V Pji dV
(erg cm−s−)
(3.2)
where d is the Sun/Earth distance, Pji = N j(X+m)A ji hν ji is the power emitted (erg cm−s−)
in the line per unit volume (also called the line emissivity). Here i, j are the lower and upper
atomic levels, A ji is the spontaneous radiative transition probability, and N j(X+m) is the num-
ber density of the upper level j of the emitting ion. The integral is over the volume V of the
emitting plasma.
Most solar observations are spatially resolved, so what is measured is the radiance, or
intensity I(λi j), of an optically thin spectral line emitted from a volume V, which is:
I(λi j) = hνi j
π ∫V N j(X+m) A ji dV [ergs s−sr−]
(3.3)
In practice, the spatial resolution of the instrument defines the volume of plasma, V = Sh,
where S is the projected area of the instrument aperture, the solid angle and h is the line of sight
through the emitting plasma.
There are many processes that cause changes in the energy state for an emitting ion, due
to its electrons transitioning between different energy levels. For instance, an ion in its ground
state configuration becomes excited when one of its electrons makes a transition to a higher
energy level. Similarly, the same ion may return to the ground state configuration when the
excited electron falls back down to the ground energy level.
Generally, the processes that populate/depopulate the excited levels ofan ion are much faster
than the processes affecting the charged state of the ions (ionization/recombination). Thus, the
problem of calculating the excited level populations can be separated from that of calculating
the ionization state. The population of the level j is then often expressed as:
N j(X+m) = N j(X+m)
N(X+m)
N(X+m)
N(X)
N(X)
N(H)
N(H)
Ne
Ne
(3.4)
•
N(X+m)/N(X) is the ionization ratio of the ion X+m relative to the total number density
of element X
•
A(X) = N(X)/N(H) is the chemical abundance of element X relative to hydrogen (N(H)
or NH);
•
N(H)/Ne is the hydrogen density relative to the free electron density. In the literature,
it is often assumed to be equal to 0.83 (assuming fully ionized plasma and assuming
N(H)/N(He) = 10.), however this value depends on the ionization state and helium abun-
dance.
•
The fraction Nj = N j(X+m)
N(X+m) of ions X+m lying in the state j.
In this case we can express the line intensity as:
I(λ ji) = ∫h N eN HA(X) G(Ne, T, λ j,i)dh
(3.5)

where G(Ne, T, λ j,i), sometimes denoted as G(T), the contribution function is calculated from
atomic parameters for that spectral line. G(T) has a very strong dependence on tempera-
ture, through the ionization balance calculations, and a weak dependence on electron number
density, Ne.
6.2 Diﬀerential Emission Measure and Emission Measure
If a unique relationship exists between N e and T, a differential emission measure DEM(T), a
function of only the plasma temperature, can be defined (Withbroe 1978):
∫
T
DEM(T)dT = ∫
h
Ne NHdh
(3.6)
i.e.,
DEM(T) = NeNH dh
dT
[cm−K−]
(3.7)
For example, if we assume that the plasma pressure, P, along the line of sight is constant,
then from the perfect-gas law N 
e ∼(P/T), and the electron density is only a function of
temperature, and the DEM(T) can be defined.
The DEM gives an indication of the amount of plasma along the line of sight that is emit-
ting the radiation observed and has a temperature between T and T + dT. For a plane parallel
atmosphere, the DEM can be related to the conductive flux and can give information about the
structure of the atmosphere. With this definition, the intensity integral becomes
I(λi j) = A(X)∫
T
G(T) DEM(T) dT,
(3.8)
where the abundance of the element A(X) is assumed to be constant along the line of sight.
We therefore have a system of Fredholm integrals of the first species to be inverted, in order
to deduce the DEM from a set of observed intensities. This inversion procedure is notoriously
difficult (see, e.g., Craig and Brown 1976).
Once the differential emission measure DEM is known, the total column emission measure
EMh can be calculated by integrating the DEM over the whole temperature range:
EMh ≡∫h NeNHdh = ∫T DEM (T) dT
[cm−]
(3.9)
When fluxes are observed, instead of intensities, the volume emission measure EMV =

6.3 Atomic Processes Aﬀecting the Ion Excitation

Ce (cm−s−) are the electron collisional excitation rate coefficients. N eCi, j gives the num-
ber of electron collisional transitions per unit time such that an ion changes its state from
i to j.
The proton collisional coefficient can be considered as an additional term. Proton col-
lisions are important when excitation energies are small, ΔEi, j ≪kTe. This happens, for
instance, for transitions between fine structure levels within the ground configuration of an ion
at high temperatures, as for example the Fe xiv transition in the ground configuration: 3s3p
(P/– P/) as explained in Seaton (1964a).
∗
A j,i (s−) are the spontaneous radiation transition probabilities.
∗
R j,i (s−) are the stimulated absorption rate coefficients, proportional to the mean inten-
sity of the radiation field. Photoexcitation and stimulated emission are important processes
which also need to be included in the level balance equations. It is possible to show that this
can be simply done by replacing the Ai, j value with a generalized radiative decay rate.
In practice, because of the short timescales of the relevant processes, for the solar corona it
is normally assumed that the plasma is in a steady state (
dN j
dt = ). The set of equations> 3.10 is
then solved for a number of low-lying levels, with the additional requirement that N(X+m) =
∑j N j.

bution with a temperature Te(K), is given by

Here the collision strength (Ω) is a symmetric, dimensionless quantity, which is related to the

energy state of the ion. The electron de-excitation rates are obtained by the application of the
principle of the detailed balance.

The solution of the electron-ion scattering problem is complex and takes a great deal of com-
puting resources. The accuracy of a particular calculation depends on two main factors. The first
is the representation which is used for the target wavefunctions, the second is the type of scat-
tering approximation chosen. The collision strengths usually have a slowly varying part and
spikes that are due to resonances (dielectronic captures). The theory on electron-ion collisions
has been developed by Seaton (1964b). Calculations can be very accurate (better than 10%),

140 3
The Sun as a Star
but are not trivial for many ions. The target must take account of configuration interaction and
allow for intermediate coupling for the higher stages of ionization. The main approximations
used for electron-ion scattering are Distorted Wave (DW), Coulomb Bethe (CBe) and the more
elaborate Close-Coupling (CC) approximation. In the CC approximation, the scattering elec-
tron sees individual target electrons, the channels are coupled and a set of integro-differential
equations are solved.
There are an abundance of electron scattering calculations for individual ions in the lit-
erature. The complexity of iron ions leads to many spectral lines and useful diagnostics, but
also means atomic calculations are difficult. The Iron Project, an international collaboration of
atomic physicists, was set up to calculate electron excitation rates for all the iron ions (Hummer
et al. 1993). A series of Iron Project papers have been published in Astronomy and Astrophysics.
A large set of excitation data have also been produced recently by the UK Rmax and APAP net-
works. The most accurate calculations for coronal iron have been performed by P.J.Storey and
collaborators. Other international groups, for example at Queen’s University of Belfast, have
also produced extensive atomic data. Atomic data has been assessed and gathered in various
databases, for example the CHIANTI database discussed below.
6.4
Atomic Processes Aﬀecting the Ion State
Since the coronal plasma is optically thin, most of the radiation escapes, the plasma is not in
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and the main processes that regulate the ionization
balance are spontaneous radiative recombination, di-electronic recombination, photoioniza-
tion, and collisional ionization. By considering the detailed balance equations that relate
successive ionization stages for these processes and requiring that the population of ions in a
given state is constant with time, it is possible to derive for each state the ratio of two successive
ionization stages N(X+m+)/N(X+m), which is mainly a function of the temperature,and only
slightly depends on the electron density. With the additional condition N(X) = ∑m N(X+m),
it is possible to derive the ionization ratio.
In the case of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), if we write the detailed balance
including photoionization and radiative recombination we obtain the Saha equation. At low
densities, the plasma becomes optically thin and most of the radiation escapes, therefore pro-
cesses like photoionization and radiative recombination are attenuated and the plasma is no
longer in LTE.
If the timescales of the observed phenomena in the coronal plasma are longer than those for
ionization and recombination, ( dN(X+m)
dt
= ), the degree of ionization of an elementis obtained
by equating the ionization and recombination rates that relate successive ionization stages:
N(X+m)(qcol + qau + qct) = N(X+m+)(αr + αd + αct)
(3.14)
The dominant processes in optically thin plasmas are collisional ionization – direct ionization
from the inner and outer shells (qcol) and excitation followed by autoionization (qau); radiative
recombination (αr) and dielectronic recombination (αd); and charge transfer (αct, qct).
The process of dielectronic recombination was shown by Burgess (1964, 1965), and
Seaton (1964b) to be a very important effect for the solar corona. >Figure 3-48 shows the effect
that inclusion of dielectronic recombination has on the ion abundances. Dielectronic recombi-
nation occurs when a free electron is captured into an autoionization state of the recombining

ion, the ion can then autoionize (releasing again a free electron) or produce a radiative transition
into a bound state of the recombined ion. The transition can only occur at specific wave-
lengths. There are many diagnostic applications using these satellite lines, which we cannot
describe here. See, for example, Gabriel and Mason (1982), Phillips et al. (2008); and references
therein. A significant number of recombination rates have been calculated by N.R.Badnell and
collaborators.
Most ion abundances are calculated in the low-density limit, assuming that all the popu-
lation in an ion is in the ground state. This is a good approximation for many ions, but not
those which have metastable levels. The ion population slightly depends on the electron density
through the rate coefficients, as shown by Burgess and Summers (1969). An example of how
different ion abundances can be obtained using different rates is shown in >Fig. 3-49.
6.5 Coronal Model Approximation: Two-Level Ion
In the low-density corona, radiative decay (spontaneous emission with Einstein coefficient A ji)
occurs much more often than collisional excitation processes, and, in general, one can neglect
the population of higher excited states,j, relative to the ground state, g. Under this so-called
coronal-model approximation, it is only the electron collisional excitation from the ground state

sion rate may be inferred from the equilibrium between the excitation/de-excitation processes
expressed by the following equation:

(3.15)
If the coronal approximation breaks down, if for example A jg is small (a forbidden or
intersystem transition), then collisional de-excitation can compete with radiative decay as a
depopulating mechanism.
6.6 Emission Measure Approximations

removing an averaged value of G(T) from the integral:
Ith = A(X) < G(T) > ∫

NeNHdh
(3.16)
A line emission measure EML can therefore be defined, for each observed line of intensity Iob:

(3.17)

where < G(T) >= .G(Tmax). The method assumesthat each line is mainly formed at temper-
atures close to the peak value Tmax of its contribution function, G(Tmax), and produces plots
of the line emission measures (multiplied by the corresponding abundance value)
A(X) EML =

as a function of Tmax.
The method was developed to measure the relative abundances of elements contributing to
the observed lines. The relative abundances of the elements are derived in order to have all the
line emission measures of the various ions lie along a common smooth curve. One example is
given in >Fig. 3-50, obtained from the original data as in Pottasch (1963).
Many other approximations and methods have been proposed. One approximation widely
used and originally proposed by Widing and Feldman (1989) was to define a line differential
emission measure DEML value:

The Sun as a Star
The above methods are limited because ofthe assumption that the bulk ofeach line is formed
at the Tmax temperature. This is broadly correct if the plasma is uniformly distributed in tem-
perature, but if not, most of the intensity in each line could come from either lower or higher
temperatures. Another problem is that many ions (e.g., He i-like, Li i-like) have broad contri-
bution functions, so are naturally formed over large temperature ranges. The major problem,
however, lies in the assumption that the plasma is uniformly distributed in temperature. There
are many cases on the Sun (e.g., coronal loops, coronal hole plumes) where the distribution
is actually nearly isothermal. In these case, it has been shown by Del Zanna et al. (2001), Del
Zanna (2003), and Del Zanna et al. (2003) that the method seriously overestimates the relative
chemical abundances.
Another way to estimate the EM(T) is the Emission Measure Loci method, by which the
loci of the curves Iob/(A(X) × G(T)) as a function of temperature are considered. In fact,
for each line and temperature T∗, the value Iob/(A(X) × G(T∗)) represents an upper limit to
the value of the emission measure EM(T∗) at that temperature, assuming that all the observed
emission Iob is produced by an isothermal plasma at the temperature T∗. The EM Loci method
was first introduced by Strong (1978) and later applied by Veck et al. (1984) to the analysis of
solar X-ray flare spectra (see >Fig. 3-51) and by Del Zanna and Mason (2003) to solar active
regions.

6.7 A Word of Warning: Problems with Emission Measures
The Li- and Na-like ions give rise to some of the strongest lines in the UV. However, it has long
been known (see, e.g., Burton et al. 1971) that the emission measures for lines from ions of the
Li- and Na-like isoelectronic sequences are at odds with those of the others. This fact has been
largely neglected or underestimated in the literature.
Del Zanna (1999) reanalyzed Skylab data using up-to-date atomic data to show the extent
of this anomalous behavior. Li-like N V and C IV are underestimated by factors of 3 and 10,
while those of Ne VIII and Mg X are overestimated by factors of 5 and 10, respectively.
Del Zanna et al. (2002b)showed, forthe first time, that the same problem occurs when stellar
emission measures are considered (see >Fig. 3-52). This was only possible by combining UV
observations from different instruments (FUSE, HST/STIS). All previous literature considered
stellar observations at wavelengths where by far the brightest lines are those from Li- and Na-
like ions (e.g., IUE and HST/STIS). As a consequence, results in previous literature should be
revised.
6.8 Electron Density Determination
The electron (number) density can be defined as the ratio of the emission measure (EM) to the
volume (V) of the emitting plasma: N e= EM/V. This approximation is reasonable under the
assumption of plasma being distributed homogeneously throughout the emitting volume. To
determine the electron density using this method, assumptions about the element abundance
and ionization balance are also needed.
A more reliable diagnostic method for measuring density is the use of density-dependent
line ratios from a single ion which has metastable levels. A metastable level, m, within an ion is
defined as a level that has a small radiative decay rate, so that collisional de-excitation competes
with radiative decay as a depopulating process. Metastable levels could for example be excited
levels within the ground configuration which can only decay via forbidden transitions. The ion
population is shifted from the ground level into the metastable(s) as the electron density of the
plasma increases. Therefore, two lines principally excited from the ground and the metastable
levels, respectively, have different dependencies on density.
For simplicity we again consider a two-level model. For forbidden and intersystem tran-
sitions the radiative decay rate is generally very small (Am,g ≃−sec−), and collisional
de-excitation then becomes an important depopulating mechanism (Am,g ≃Ne Ce
m,g) and may
even be the dominant mechanism; moreover the population of the metastable level becomes
comparable with the population of the ground level and we have:
Nm =

For small electron densities, Ne →, Am,g ≫NeCe

The intensity ratio of a forbidden to an allowed transition (IF/IA) for different spectral lines
from the same ion can be used to determine an average electron density for the emitting volume.
This value is independent of the elemental abundance, ionization ratio, and any assumptions
about the size of that volume.
If the population of a metastable level (m) is comparable with the ground level (g), then
other excited levels (k) can be populated from this metastable level as well as from the ground
level and the dependence of the intensity on electron density becomes
Ik,m ≃N β

(3.25)
Taking Fe xiv as an example (> Fig. 3-53), the ground configuration 3s3p has two
levels: P/and P/; the transition between these two levels gives rise to the coronal green
line at 5303 Å. The metastable level is actually the upper level in the ground configuration
(3s3p P/). Its transition probability to the ground level is in fact only 60 s−. For low electron
densities (10cm−), almost all the population for Fexiv is in the ground level, but as electron
density is increased (10cm−), the upper level begins to have a significant population as well.
The spectral line at 334.2 Å is excited from the ground level (3s3p P/), whereas the line at
353.8 Å is excited from the upper level in the ground configuration (3s3p P/). The intensity
ratio of these two lines (>Fig. 3-53) varies with electron density, reflecting the level population
changes in the ground configuration. For active region observations, the [353.8/334.2] ratio
gives electron densities varying from around cm−in the quiet part to around .cm−
in the core (Mason et al. 1999).
The CDS and SUMER instruments on board SoHO have provided a wide range of density
diagnostics, but density measurements from these two instruments are generally only accurate
to the 30–40% level at best. The high sensitivity of the EIS instrument on board Hinode now
allows electron number density measurements to an unprecedented precision of up to 5% in
active regions.

Electron density sensitivity for a pair of Fe XIV lines
which the path length dh can be estimated once the electron density N e is measured from,
e.g., a line ratio. Dere et al. (1987) used HRTS transition region C iv intensities and densities
form a line ratio of O iv (both formed at around 10K) to obtain path lengths of 0.1–10 km,
which was much smaller than the observed sizes of the spicular structures (2,400 km). This is
often interpreted as due to the transition region having a filamentary structure, so that most
of the plasma occupies only a small fraction (0.01–0.00001 – the filling factor) of the observed
volume. However, translating the spectroscopic measurments into a geometrical filling factors
is not straightforward (see, e.g., Judge 2000).
6.10 Electron Temperature Determination
One way to measure the electron temperature is to consider the intensity ratio of two
allowed lines excited from the ground level, g having significantly different excitation energies.

where j and k denote the excited levels; Υ is the thermally averaged collision strength, and kB is
the Boltzman constant. The ratio becomes sensitive to changes in the temperatureif the thermal
energy of the electrons is much smaller than the difference between the excitation energies
ΔEg,k −ΔEg, j
kBT

(3.27)
assuming that the lines are emitted by the same isothermal volume with the same electron
density.
Such spectral lines are normally far apart in wavelength and it is often necessary to use
observations from different instruments, which can lead to inaccuracies (e.g., O vi 1032, 173 Å
lines observed by SoHO SUMER and CDS/GIS). Be-like ions offer a good opportunity for diag-
nostics, as the ratios of the strong resonance and intercombination lines are good temperature
indicators. Of all the Be-like ions, Mg ix is that one formed closest to the average coronal T
(1 MK). The atomic structure of Be-like ions is such that the resonance line in second order is
very close to the intercombination line. For Mg, the resonance 368.07 Å line has been routinely
observed in second order by the SoHO/GIS close to the 706.06 Å intercombination line. The
368.07, 706.06, and 749.55 Å lines are basically density-insensitive but have a different temper-
ature dependence. Therefore, any combination of two of these three lines is a good temperature
diagnostic. The 706.06, and 749.55 Å lines have been observed with SUMER and used as a tem-
perature diagnostic in coronal holes. Del Zanna et al. (2008) have calculated the atomic data for
Mg ix, and revised previous electron temperature measurements.
6.11 Continuum
The continuum emission can be significant in the UV, but diminishes in the EUV. Free-free
emission is produced when an electron interacts with a charged particle X+m+and makes a
transition from an energy E to an energy E′ releasing a photon of energy hν: X+m++e(E) ⇒
X+m++ e(E′) + hν For a Maxwellian velocity distribution of electrons the process is called
thermal bremsstrahlung. The formulation for the emitted energy per unit of time and volume is
based on the mean Gaunt factors computed by Karzas and Latter (1961). Free-free emission is
the main radiative loss mechanism for low-density plasmas at T > K.
Free-bound emission is produced when a free electron of energy E is captured by an ion
(X+m+) into a bound state of X+m:
X+m++ e(E) ⇒X+m

+ hν
(3.28)
a photon of energy hν = E + In is emitted and In is the ionization energy of the bound state n.
For a Maxwellian electron velocity distribution, the continuum emission is characterized by
discontinuities at the ionization thresholds. The process is called radiative recombination. The
free-bound emission depends on the chemical abundances.
For hydrogen and helium-like ions, another continuum (two-photon) is important, in par-
ticular at T ≤3 10K. The metastable 2s state of hydrogenic and helium-like ions depopulates
via collisional excitation to the 2p level and by the two-photon decay process.

6.12 Line Widths, Ion Temperatures, and Doppler Motions
Spectral line profiles give information about the dynamic nature of the solar and stellar atmo-
spheres. The Dopplershift Δλ in a spectral line is directly proportional to the line-of-sight
velocity υ of the plasma element emitting the line: Δλ/λ = υ/c, where c is the speed of light.
A blueshift indicates plasma moving toward the observer. Naturally, different plasma veloci-
ties along the line of sight can be present. These would modify the line profile from the simple
thermal broadening of the line.
An emission line has a natural width (called the thermal width) that is characteristic of the
temperature of formation of the emitting ion and is due to the Doppler motions of the emitting
ions. An additional broadening is also introduced by the observing instrument and depends on
the quality and alignment of the optical components. If a line width is found to be broader than
the combined thermal and instrumental widths, then we refer to the additional component as
the non-thermal width. The line width of an optically thin spectral line has a Gaussian profile
and is expressed mathematically in terms of three components.
The intensity per unit wavelength Iλ is defined as
Iλ =
I
√
πσ
exp[−(λ −λ)/σ ]
(3.29)
where I = ∫Iλdλ is the integrated intensity and σ is the Gaussian width given by
σ = λ
c(kTi
M
+ ξ) + σ 
I
(3.30)
for a Maxwellian velocity distribution for the ion emitting the line at a temperature Ti. Here M
is the ion mass, σI is the Gaussian instrumental width, and ξ is the most probable nonthermal
velocity ntv. Nonthermal velocities can be obtained by assuming that Ti is the temperature
corresponding to peak abundance of the ion (see >Fig. 3-54). Conversely, if assumptions are
made on the nonthermal velocities, the ion temperature Ti can be obtained.
Several coronagraph experiments (e.g., Spartan, SoHO/UVCS) have provided information
on hydrogen atom and electron temperatures from H i Lyα profiles (see, e.g., the review of Kohl
et al. 2006). The spectral line profiles, at the distances observed by these instruments, have two
components. The resonantly scattered, relatively narrow component provides empirical con-
straints on the electron and proton temperatures. The weaker, electron scattered component is
wider and related to the electron density and temperature.
6.13 The CHIANTI Atomic Package
Quantitative modeling of the EUV and soft X-ray plasma emission provides a powerful tem-
perature and density diagnostic of the coronal plasma. However, to calculate optically-thin
synthetic spectra and to apply spectral analysis and plasma diagnostics to solar EUV and soft
X-ray emission, data from thousands of atomic energy levels are required. For this purpose,
the CHIANTI atomic database (Dere et al. 1997), which was first released in 1996, provides a
comprehensive dataset covering the UV and X-ray wavelength ranges. The database contains
state-of-the-art energy levels, radiative data, and electron and proton collisional data for the
majority of astrophysical ions of interest. Furthermore, the CHIANTI codes represent a diag-
nostics toolboxforastrophysical and solarplasmas. In CHIANTI, the atomicdata (energylevels,

wavelengths, radiative transition probabilities and excitation data) are stored in ASCII files. The
wavelengths are based on experimental data. Lines for which only theoretical energy levels are
available are also provided. The radiative data are taken from published literature and, where
necessary, supplemented by new calculations. CHIANTI also includes ancillary data such as
standard differential emission measures, elemental abundance, and ionization fraction files.
In the CHIANTI database, the assumption of Maxwellian electron distributions is implicit
through the storage of Maxwellian-averaged electron collision strengths. However, recent
observations of the small-scale transient solar activity have shown that the solar atmosphere
is dynamic and nonthermal (e.g., Dzifˇcáková et al. 2008). Therefore, to progress our knowledge
of the solar atmospheric activity, nonequilibrium and nonthermal spectral plasma emission
models are required in the future.

6.14 Benchmarking the Atomic Data
Ongoing work has been carried out to benchmark the atomic data against observations. A large
part of the work is done as part of the assessment for each CHIANTI release.
The atomic data, identifications, and diagnostics from the X-rays to the visible for the most
important lines on an ion by ion basis have been assessed against laboratory ad astrophysical
observations in a series of papers published in Astronomy and Astrophysics. The assessments
include atomic calculations and provide the most accurate identifications to date. The first paper
in the series is on Fex (Del Zanna et al. 2004).

Chemical Abundances
An accurate knowledge of the chemical composition of the Sun is of paramount importance for
a variety of reasons, the most important one being to obtain an accurate model of the Sun as a
Star (the standard model). Chemical abundances have been measured in a variety of ways, from
samples of meteoritic materials, to remote-sensing of the photospheric (visible) and coronal
(XUV) emission of the Sun, to helioseismology and to in situ measurements of the solar wind
and of the solar energetic particles (SEP). Gamma-ray spectroscopy is another powerful tool
for measuring the abundances of various elements, as described in the review from Ramaty
and Murphy (1987). The drawback is that very few observations of strong flares which produce
gamma-rays are available. One was observed on April 27, 1981, and a few have been observed
more recently with RHESSI.
The photospheric and coronal abundances of many elements are still uncertain, because
they depend critically on the spectral resolution, the method adopted, and the accuracy of
atomic physics calculations. Some useful review articles on elemental abundances are Anders
and Grevesse (1989), Meyer(1985), Bochsler(2007), Asplund et al. (2009), Lodders et al. (2009).
Various review articles can also be found in Wimmer-Schweingruber (2001), the proceedings
of a joint SoHO/ACE workshop on solar and galactic composition in 2001.
Elemental abundances, A, are normally provided as number densities relative to hydro-
gen (often as log(dex), i.e., assuming log(A(H)) = ). In terms of number densities, the
Sun and its neighborhood are composed primarily (90%) of hydrogen, with significant (10%)
helium, but with only about 0.1% of the remaining elements. Abundances of Li, Be, and B are
very low. The Li abundance is an interesting proxy for estimating the age of a star.
J. von Fraunhofer (1787–1826) was the first to observe the dark lines in the visible spectrum
of the Sun. G. Kirchhoff (1824–1887) correctly proposed that these were due to absorption of
light by cooler, overlying layers of the solar atmosphere. Russell (1929) produced a pioneering
piece of work, establishing the photospheric abundances of a large number of elements from
the visible spectrum of the Sun.
Goldschmidt (1938) compiled chemical data for terrestrial rocks and meteorites in a pio-
neering piece of work. Along with others, he suggested that the abundances of non-volatile
elements in the CI carbonaceous chondrites meteorites should be representative of the aver-
age values for our solar system. Among the many types of meteorites, the CI carbonaceous
chondrites (CC) are thought to originate from asteroids which were formed at the same time
as the rest of the planets in the solar system, but that were not subject to the many changes
which occurred during the evolution. Indeed, there is a remarkable agreement between CC

The Sun as a Star 3
153
and the most up-to-date photospheric abundances of non-volatile elements. A recent review
on abundances in chondritic meteorites is given by Lodders et al. (2009).
The solar (photospheric) abundances of non-volatile elements such as Mg, Si, Ca, Fe, Ni,
can be established from the absorption lines in the visible spectrum, or obtained from mete-
oritic samples. The abundances of volatile elements such as H, C, N, O can in principle also be
obtained from photospheric spectra, but not from meteoritic samples because they are not fully
retained. The abundances of the important noble gases He, Ne, Ar cannot be obtained either
way, in the first instance because these elements do not produce usable absorption lines, and in
the second case because they are volatile elements.
Detailed examination of the Sun’s upper atmosphere reveals that elementalabundances vary
from the photospheric values between different solar regions. In addition, measurements of
the solar wind composition differ from photospheric values. There is a correlation between
the abundance and the first ionization potential (FIP) of the different elements. In particular,
the low-FIP (≤eV) elements are more abundant than high-FIP in the slow solar wind (SSW)
and in coronal loop plasma.
7.1 Photospheric Abundances
Many semiempirical 1D models adopting LTE have been developed to study the photosphere.
Sophisticated model atmospheres include departures from LTE and, in general, comparisons
between observed high-resolution spectra and theoretical ones are very satisfactory.
In recent years, it has become possible to perform 3D time-dependent hydrodynamic sim-
ulations of solar convection, where the hydrodynamic equations are solved together with 3D
radiative transfer equations (for a review see Nordlund et al. 2009). The calculations are car-
ried out adopting a limited set of opacities when computing the radiative heating/cooling rate
in the energy equation. These models successfully reproduce the main features of the solar
granulation, in terms of spatial, temporal, and velocity scales. These new models produce sig-
nificantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, compared with the widely used
earlier values.
Oxygen is the most abundant element after H and He. The derived “photospheric” abun-
dance of oxygen has changed from 10.(Anders and Grevesse 1989) to 10.(Asplund et al.
2009). The latest result is based on the analysis of forbidden and permitted O i transitions
as well as vibration–rotation and pure rotation lines of OH. Various discrepancies that have
been present for a long time appear to have been resolved, once severe blending and the new
simulations are taken into account.
An up-to-date review on photospheric abundances is given by Asplund et al. (2009), where
references to recent work can be found. There is still a debate in the literature about the accuracy
of these new abundances. If confirmed, they have far-reaching implications in a variety of fields.
As most previous measurements have been carried out relative to oxygen, for example, a large
part of literature may need to be revised. The revised abundances have important implications
for the standard solar model, as discussed for example by Basu and Antia (2008).
7.2 Coronal Abundances
For a review of some of the uncertainties related to abundance determinations derived from
UV and X-ray spectra, see Mason (1995). A vast literature exists on abundance measurements

154 3
The Sun as a Star
using various techniques from the Skylab, Yohkoh, and SMM missions. Only some examples
are given here. Pottasch (1963) applied an approximate method (see >Sect. 6.6) to show that
the abundances in the solar corona are different from those of the photosphere. Walker et al.
(1974) used the intensities of resonance lines of hydrogen-like and He-like ions in the X-rays
to obtain relative chemical abundances for a number of elements. Interestingly, for the active
regions and flares that they studied, they found near-photospheric abundances.
An extensive literature based on Skylab EUV observations exists. For example, Widing and
Feldman (2001)used Skylabspectroheliographs and measured the rate ofchange ofthe radiance
ratios of Mg/Ne lines of active regions as they evolved with time, as a proxy for the FIP effect.
Interestingly, at birth of an active region, they measured ‘photospheric’ composition, while after
2–3 days after the emergence of the active region, the relative abundance changes by factors
of 4–5. However, most results from Skylab need to be revisited, since the Widing and Feldman
(1989) approximation (see >Sect. 6.6) which was used extensively may have some limitations.
This approximation tends to overestimate the FIP effect when the plasma distribution is not
multi-thermal, as is the case of active region loops (as discussed in Del Zanna 2003). For exam-
ple, the EM Loci method, applied to a Skylab observation, was shown by Del Zanna (2003) to
be consistent with an FIP bias of 3.7, rather than a large FIP bias of 14 obtained previously.
Some results based on EUV SoHO CDS spectra exist, and tend to indicate that the Mg/Ne
abundances in quiescent 1 MK loops have near-photospheric abundances (cf. >Fig. 3-59 and
Del Zanna 2003; Del Zanna and Mason 2003). On the other hand, Young and Mason (1997)
studied the Mg/Ne abundance ratio in an active region and found that emerging flux regions
had photospheric abundances in contrast to longer-lived active region loops which showed a
large FIP bias.
UV measurements in the outer corona have been obtained by SoHO UVCS. Raymond et al.
(1997) analyzed SoHO UVCS spectra where lines from hydrogen and other elements were
observed at a radial distance R = 1.5 R⊙. In the core of a quiescent equatorial streamer dur-
ing solar minimum, high-FIP elements were found to be depleted by an order of magnitude
(compared with photospheric abundances), while low-FIP were also depleted by about a factor
of 3. Along the edges of a quiescent streamer, and in a streamer associated with an active region,
high-FIP elements were found to be depleted by a factor of 3. The abundances along the edges
of the streamer legs were similar to those measured in the slow solar wind, which would be an
important indication that these are the source regions for the slow wind. Different streamers
observed when the Sun was more active, however, have shown different abundances and much
reduced depletion.
Feldman et al. (1998) report an analysis of SoHO SUMER spectra very close to the solar
limb, at a radial distance R ≤1.03 R⊙in a quiet Sun region and above the north polar coronal
hole. Low-FIP elementswere found to be enriched by about a factor of 4 in the corona above the
quiet equatorial region, but not in the coronal hole. One significant problem is that the Ne viii,
Na ix, Mg x lines, all of which belong to the Li-like isoelectronic sequence, appear to indicate a
systematic lower effective FIP bias value than the restofthe lines. The authors used the Ovi 1032 Å
to normalize all the other lines, and since O vi is also in the same isoelectronic sequence, the
results are quite uncertain. The same issue applies to the interpretation of SoHO UVCS spectra,
and is related to the problem of anomalous ions in emission measure analyses (see >Sect. 6.7).
Various spectral measurements in the EUV and UV from the SoHO CDS UVCS and
SUMER instruments as a function of height from the solar limb have now indicated the pres-
ence of gravitational settling in the sense that emission lines from elements with larger atomic
weights such as Fe have radiances which decrease much rapidly than lines which should be
formed at similar temperatures but are from lighter elements (e.g., Mg, Si). Feldman et al. (1998)

The Sun as a Star 3
155
found evidence of gravitational settling and suggested that the Raymond et al. (1997) results
may just be caused by gravitational settling. This is reasonable, if the streamer core is formed
of quiescent closed structures so gravitational settling acts in reducing the abundances of the
heavier elements, a fact that is not yet well established.
7.3 Abundances from In Situ Measurements
In situ chemical composition measurements are now available for over 25 years, from foil collec-
tions during the Apollo missions (and Genesis), to mass spectrometers such as the Solar Wind
Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) on Ulysses and CELIAS on SoHO, and more recently
from the ACE and the STEREO missions.
In situ observations of the SW and of solar energetic particle (SEP) have shown that elemen-
tal abundances are highly variable. SEP events are transient and are now known to be associated
with acceleration processes within CME-driven shocks and flares. SEP events are extremely
variable and are therefore not suitable for determining the bulk of the solar composition. See
Reames (1999) for a review of the characteristics of SEP events.
For many years, in situ measurements have indicated a FIP effect of about 4–5 in the slow
SW, while the fast SW does not seem to have a significant FIP effect (as shown e.g., by Ulysses
observations of a proxy, the Mg/O ratio). In the slow and fast SW, the He abundance is very
variable but on average it is 2–3 times lower than the photospheric value.
von Steiger et al. (2000) adopted an improved analysis technique to measure the average
solar wind charge state and chemical composition of about 40 ion species of He, C, N, O, Ne,
Mg, Si, S, and Fe observed with the SWICS on Ulysses. The FIP effect was confirmed, however
it was found that on average the differences between slow and fast SW were only about a factor
of 3, much lower than what was previously found. >Figure 3-55 shows as an example the Fe/O
relative abundance as it varies with the solar wind speed. It is evident that during the polar
passes at solar minimum (1994, 1996, fast solar wind), the variability is much reduced and the
relative abundance of Fe/O is lower.
Genesis was a NASA mission devotedto the collection of solar wind data at L1 from Decem-
ber2001 toApril 2004. Initial results show results consistent with othermeasurements. Accurate
values, in particular for isotopic composition, should soon be available.
7.4 Depletion, Enhancement or Both?
It is still unclear whether the low-FIP elements such as Fe are enhanced in the corona, or high-
FIP ones such as O are depleted, relative to their photospheric values, or if a “hybrid” solution
such as that one proposed by Fludra and Schmelz (1999) applies.
Veck and Parkinson (1981) were the first to measure elemental abundances from line-to-
continuum X-ray measurements from OSO-8. They found that the low-FIP elements seem to
have photospheric values, and that high-FIP elements seem to be depleted. Since then, a large
body of conflicting evidence on the subject has been presented. However, most direct remote-
sensing measurements seem to confirm the early results from Veck and Parkinson (1981).
For example, Fludra and Schmelz (1995) applied a DEM and line-to-continuum analysis on
flare observations with the SMM Bent Crystal Spectrometer, and found high-FIP elements
depleted, compared with their photospheric values. Direct measurementsof inner-shell Fe lines
formed during large solar flares by fluorescence of X-rays exciting photospheric iron, observed

with various crystal spectrometers on Yohkoh, SMM, and P78-1 are consistent with the coro-
nal Fe abundance being equal to the photospheric value, within a factor of 2 (Phillips et al.
1995). The RESIK crystal spectrometer on board the CORONAS-F spacecraft has also allowed
line-to-continuum analyses of solar flares in the X-rays. For example, Chifor et al. (2007)
found near-photospheric abundances for K, Si, and Ar and S abundances consistent with older
measurements from SMM.
>Figure 3-56 shows a sample of a few abundance measurements, some in situ (in red), and
some from remote sensing. For the in situ, we show measurements of Solar Energetic Particles
(SEP) gradual events, which are thought to be associated with ejecta from the solar corona. We
also show two average Ulysses solar wind measurements, one from the fast solar wind (FSW)
from Gloeckler and Geiss (2007), and one from the slow solar wind (SSW) during maximum
(von Steiger et al. 2000). All these in situ measurements were relative ones, and are plotted here
taking the Oxygen abundance as a reference. The Figure also shows two measurements from
X-ray observations of active regions (AR), again rescaled to the Oxygen abundance. Finally,
we have added two sets of “absolute” abundances obtained from X-ray spectra of flares, and
a line-to-continuum (L/C) analysis. All the measurements are plotted as a ratio relative to the
“photospheric” abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). There is a clear trend for low-FIP elements
to be overabundant and for high-FIP ones to be underabundant; however the scatter, mostly
due to real solar variability, is large.
7.5 Helium, Neon, and Argon

He lines are the strongest lines in the XUV. The Coronal Helium Abundance Spacelab Exper-
iment (CHASE) on the Spacelab 2 Mission was specifically designed to determine the helium
abundance from the ratio of the scattered He II 304 Å to Lyman-α 1218 Å, on the disk and
off the limb. A value for the He/H abundance of 7.0±% for the quiet corona was deduced by
Gabriel et al. (1995).
Helium abundance measurementshavealso been indirectly obtained from helioseismology.
A variety of measurements exist in the literature. For example, Basu and Antia (2004) obtained
a value of 10.93 dex, equivalent to 8.5% by number, using OPAL opacities. This is close to the
value of 8.3% predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis theory.
The modeling for all He lines needs detailed radiative transfer calculations, taking
into account many effects, such as photon scattering, or the so-called photoionization–
recombination mechanism, whereby coronal radiation can be a significant source of photoion-
ization for neutral helium. Another complexity relates to the fact that all He lines have high
excitation energies, which makes them very sensitive to non-thermal electron velocity distri-
butions and other non-equilibrium effects. For a discussion of some of these effects, see e.g.,
Andretta et al. (2003), Jordan et al. (2005). In general, the EUV radiances in quiet Sun for all
He lines are much stronger than realistic models predict.
Andretta et al. (2008) devised a new technique which involved modeling and observations
from SoHO instruments of a C-class flare to obtain the first accurate measurement of the He
abundance in the chromosphere, 7.5±%, a value in marginal agreement with the helioseismic
value.

158 3
The Sun as a Star
In situ measurements of the relative abundance of helium to hydrogen show a very low
abundance, less than 5%, with a large variability which is partly correlated with the solar wind
speed and partly with the solar activity and cycle.
Neon and argon photospheric abundances are not directly measured, but have been inferred
relative to oxygen or other elements from XUV spectra. They are also measured in situ.
Gloeckler and Geiss (2007) suggest that Ulysses SW observations of Ne and Ar can be used
to provide reliable “photospheric” abundances. They suggest a Ne/O abundance of 0.078 and
an Ar/O one of 0.0018.
7.6 Modeling
The presence of an FIP effect implies an ion-neutral fractionation, which probably takes place
low down in the solar atmosphere, possibly in the chromosphere at T ≤10K, where the ions
start to become ionized. The ionization is mainly by the coronal EUV photons, but the low-FIP
elements are more easily ionized by electron collisions. It was proposed some time ago (see, e.g.,
Geiss 1982) that once the fractionation has taken place in the chromosphere, the ions then drift
up into the corona, guided by the magnetic field, to become ions of higher stages. The amount
of the FIP effect would depend on how ions drift up into the corona, hence on the topology of
the magnetic field. The key factor is the Coulomb drag of the ions with the protons. Low-FIP
elements are more easily ionized and have a stronger coupling with the proton flow.
The issue is complex, and there are various physical processes at work that need to be studied
in detail. On the one hand there are the ionizing/recombining processes. In the chromosphere,
the H i Lα is by far the strongest contributor to ionizing UV photons, and is able to ionize
all neutrals from elements with FIP ≤13.6 eV. Then, there are the collisions between all the
particles, which produce charge exchange and diffusion, for example. In addition, gravitational
settling is also present. In hydrostatic equilibrium, each ion is distributed in the corona with
a pressure scale height which is proportional to its mass. Heavier ions tend to accumulate at
lower heights, unless mixing due to e.g., flows is present.
Thermal diffusion is also strong for ions (see, e.g., Geiss and Buergi 1986), and occurs in
the presence of a steep temperature gradient. This drags ions of heavier elements toward higher
temperatures. In the transition region, temperature gradients are large and positive, and thermal
diffusion acts in the opposite direction to gravitational settling.
Many models, based on first principles, have been proposed. Various authors followed von
Steigerand Geiss (1989)byassuming that diffusion processes in the upperchromosphere are the
main factors. Recently, Laming (2004) have presented an unified picture of the FIP and inverse
FIPeffects based on the action ofthe ponderomotive force ofAlfven waves in the chromosphere.
The model simulations reproduce some of the main observational features (i.e., overabundance
of low-FIP and underabundance of high-FIP), which is very encouraging.
7.7 Stellar and Galactic Abundances
The solar metallicity is quite typical when compared to nearby stars of similar spectral type (G).
Accurate measurements have recently been obtained as a by-product of the search of extraso-
lar planets. It turns out that the majority of planet-bearing stars are metal-rich by 0.1–0.3 dex
compared to the Sun, which in turn is metal-rich by about 0.2 dex compared to stars with no

159
planets (see, e.g., Butler et al. 2000). A recent compilation from Fuhrmann (2008) of nearby
stars (within 25 pc) confirms that the Sun has an average metallicity.
When chemical abundances within our Galaxy are studied, a large scatter is normally found,
but also an overall gradient, as a function of galactocentric distance. The latest measurements
indicate that the Sun has quite typical photospheric abundances. This can be seen e.g., in Hou
et al. (2000), with recently compiled chemical abundances obtained from H ii regions, planetary
nebulae, and B stars.
In contrast, the situation regarding stellar coronae is not clear. Some early measurements
from the EUVE satellites provided chemical abundances for a few stars which showed a solar-
like FIP effect (see, e.g. Drake et al. 1997), but it has only been since the launch of the
XMM-Newton, Chandra satellites in 1999 that systematicmeasurements in the X-rays have been
obtained. Some line-to-continuum measurementshave been obtained, however in the majority
of cases simple emission measure analyses have provided relative abundances between low-
FIP elements (mainly iron) and high-FIP ones (mainly oxygen, neon). A complex picture has
emerged, with many active stars and binaries showing an inverse FIP effect, with low-FIP ele-
ments being a lot more depleted than the high-FIP ones (both compared to hydrogen). This
effect becomes more prominent with increasing activity of the star (see, e.g., Güdel and Nazé
2009 and references therein). These results have been puzzling, however some caveats apply.
First, measurements of photospheric abundances have often been lacking, due to the strong
stellar rotation which broadens the spectral lines. It is often assumed that stars have the same
photospheric composition as the Sun. In only a few cases the inverse FIP effect seems to be con-
firmed. Second, the emission measure methods provide meaningful results only if the emission
in lines emitted by different ions/elements is co-spatial, something very difficult to ascertain.
Third, density effects and departures from ionization equilibrium may play a role.

The Solar Corona
8.1 Solar Features as Seen in X-rays and EUV
The most dramatic change in our perception of the solar atmosphere in the past few decades
is due to X-ray and EUV observations from space. It is now evident how dynamic and active
the solar atmosphere is, both on small and large temporal and spatial scales. Early concepts
of relatively uniform, plane parallel models for the solar atmosphere are no longer sustain-
able. The structured and dynamic nature of the solar corona was first evident from the Skylab
X-ray telescope observations. Spectacular observations were then made over an extended
period with YOHKOH/SXT, showing dramatic changes from solar minimum to solar maxi-
mum, later shown in more detail with SoHO EIT and CDS observations (see >Sect. 11.3.1).
The SoHO/EIT observations showed the dynamic nature of the solar corona in the EUV,
while the SoHO/MDI observations showed changes in the photospheric magnetic field over
short timescales, even in the quiet Sun regions. TRACE has provided some stunning EUV
images and movies of solar features, especially active regions.
When viewed in X-ray emission (> Fig. 3-6) the structures on the Sun can clearly be
divided into different characteristics. Coronal hole areas are dark with quite well-defined
boundaries. This occurs because the averaged density is about half the density of the averaged
quiet regions, and because there is hardly any plasma at temperatures above 1 MK (see, e.g.,

160 3
The Sun as a Star
results from SoHO CDS: Del Zanna and Bromage 1999). During solar minimum coronal holes
are apparent at the north and south poles, but during solar maximum, coronal holes frequently
extend down to lower latitudes. Coronal holes represent areas in the solar atmosphere where the
magnetic field is predominantly unipolar and is “open”, that is goes out into the heliosphere. The
fast coronal wind flows from these regions. Coronal holes contain sub-features, long plumes of
bright emission, bright points (small bipolar regions), and dynamic jets.
The quiet sun is the more diffuse area of weak X-ray emission. On closer inspection, even
the quiet sun regions are covered by a multitude of small transient brightening (and small bipo-
lar regions), due to the constant motion of the photospheric footpoints of the magnetic field.
Other solar features include prominences, seen in the quiet Sun and active regions. These can
sometimes erupt and can be associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) which shoot out
from the Sun.
In this section we discuss the characteristics and properties of the solar corona, in particular
with regard to active regions. We pay particular regard to the measurements of plasma prop-
erties: temperature, electron density, flows etc, which are an essential requirement to constrain
heating models.
8.2 Solar Active Regions
Solar active regions (ARs) are areas of enhanced UV and X-ray emission that lie directly above
areas of enhanced magnetic field, sometimes with associated sunspots. The heliographic posi-
tion of active regions is typically confined within latitudes of ±40○from the solar equator, as is
the case of the sunspots. ARs typically exhibit a strongly concentrated leading magnetic polar-
ity, followed by a more fragmented trailing group of opposite polarity. Because of this bipolar
nature, active regions are mainly made up of closed magnetic field lines. Due to continuous
magnetic flux emergence, and reconfiguration, a number of dynamic processes such as plasma
heating, flares, and coronal mass ejections occur in active regions. Active regions have the famil-
iar appearance of numerous filled loops, which are hotter and denser than the background
corona, producing bright emission in soft X-rays and EUV wavelengths (see >Fig. 3-6). It is
normally accepted that loops trace out the magnetic field structure in the corona.
The Monograph from the Skylab Workshop III on Solar Active Regions (Orrall 1981) is
a good starting point for the study of solar active regions. In particular, the S082A instru-
ment provided some good observations of active regions and flares. The S082A observations
indicated that the hot core loops (seen e.g., in Fe xvi and X-rays) were mostly low lying, com-
pact and closely packed (unresolved). They seemed to connect across the magnetic neutral
line. The cooler warm loops (seen in Ne vii) seemed better defined, were larger and slender.
There were also many bright patches of emission or kernels in strong magnetic regions on either
side of the neutral line (corresponding to the bright chromospheric plage areas). These kernels
could be identified as the footpoints of the Fe xvi and X-ray loops. Dere and Mason (1981)
provided a summary of electron density values derived for active regions, which ranged from
0.7–6.0×cm−for a temperature range of 1.2–2 MK.
After Skylab, the YOHKOH/SXT instrument was widely used tostudy the plasma properties
of active regions and solar flares, as well as SoHO/EIT, TRACE, and other broadband imagers
in the X-rays and EUV.
A specific type of emission known as active region moss was clearly visible in the 173 Å
passband of TRACE. Although this type of emission was mentioned in early observations taken

The Sun as a Star 3
161
by Skylab, TRACE provided the first detailed observations of moss. It is currently thought that
the moss emission corresponds to the footpoints of the hot loops seen e.g., in the Yohkoh/SXT
images (see, e.g., Martens et al. 2000).
8.2.1 Active Regions Observed with SoHO CDS
Monochromatic imaging in spectral lines emitted in a wide range of temperatures became
routine with the SoHO/CDS instrument. Active regions appear very different at different tem-
peratures. Mason et al. (1999) studied an active region at the limb using CDS observations.
The core of the active region was found to be very hot in comparison to the surroundings. The
density map of the active region derived fromSi x line ratio shows that the density is highest
(greater than .×cm−) in the hot core of the active region. Further studies with CDS, and
later Hinode/EIS gave similar results.
Del Zanna and Mason (2003) used both imaging (TRACE) and spectroscopic (CDS) obser-
vations to show that the dominant EUV emission in active regions is multi-thermal and
unresolved even at 1′′ resolution (TRACE). Its peak emission is around 1.5 MK where Fe xiii
is formed (cf. >Fig. 3-57). This diffuse emission forms a background and foreground which
needs to be taken into account when analyzing loop structures.

The Sun as a Star
The SoHO/CDS instrument also allowed measurementsof EM and DEM from the observa-
tion of several spectral lines. These can be compared with simulated emission measures derived
from theoretical models. >Figure 3-58 shows a sample DEM for an active region. The peak
emission is at log T[K] ≃., (2 MK) compared to the quiet Sun which has peak emission at
about 1.5 MK, and coronal holes where there is hardly any emission above 1 MK.
The large, quiescent 1 MK loops are best seen in the TRACE 173 Å band, sensitive to
Fe IX/Fe X emission, and a considerable number of studies has been published. Early results
from TRACE indicated that these warm loops were almost isothermal along their length and
“over dense”, compared to what expected in hydrostatic equilibrium However, TRACE mea-
surements of temperature and density along and across coronal loops have severe limitations,
which only spectroscopic measurements can resolve. SoHO/CDS showed that these quiescent
warm (1 MK) coronal loops are nearly isothermal at each location along their length (e.g., Del
Zanna 2003, see >Fig. 3-59), but are not isothermal along their length, something later con-
firmed with Hinode/EIS observations (Tripathi et al. 2009). With CDS, it was also possible to
follow the coronal loops down to the chromosphere (Del Zanna 2003).
SoHO/CDS also showed (Del Zanna et al. 2006b) that hot and cool loops are intermin-
gled and tend to keep their characteristics, in particular the temperature, for a very long time
(>Fig. 3-60). In essence, most structures must continuously be heated in a steady way to main-
tain their temperatures. These results radically changed our knowledge of loops, given that it
was widely thought that cooler loops naturally form via cooling of the hotter ones.
8.2.2 Active Regions Observed with Hinode EIS
A major advantage of the Hinode/EIS instrument over previous ones is the ability to mea-
sure Dopplershifts and line widths in coronal lines emitted above 1 MK. New features have
emerged. EIS observations of active regions have shown a clear pattern of blueshifts (Del Zanna
2007, 2008; Doschek et al. 2007), increasing at higher temperatures. The blueshifted areas are
always in low-density, low-emission regions, and have associated large line widths, indicating
that they are places where strong heating is taking place. > Figure 3-61 shows one example,
from Del Zanna (2008).
Some signatures of blueshifted emission in “coronal” (T > 1 MK) lines were previously
obtained from SMM/UVSP, SoHO/CDS, and SUMER, but most observations had a poor spatial
coverage and/or resolution. Perhaps surprisingly, loops tend to have smaller line widths.
Hinode/EIS has also shown that almost all active region loops exhibit strong redshifts in
both legs, with increasing values toward the footpoints, in progressively cooler emission lines
(Del Zanna 2007, 2008), as described in >Sect. 4.3.
8.3 Coronal Heating
The amount of energy required to sustain and heat the corona is very small, compared to
e.g., the total energy radiated from the Sun. However, a well-accepted explanation of how the
corona is heated is still lacking. Different coronal features might also be heated by different
processes. A great variety of mechanisms for coronal heating have been proposed over the last
70 years. Most theories can be grouped into two categories, one hydrodynamic and the other
magnetic. In the first one, purely hydrodynamic effects are important, for example, heating by

The warm loops (green) are clearly seen in TRACE; however there are cooler (blue) and hotter (red)
loops as well. Cooler and hotter loops are intermingled and ﬁll the entire AR volume. They are also
nearly isothermal at each location
the acousticwaves which are observed in the photosphere and chromosphere. In the second one,
energy is channeled via the magnetic fields, for example via microflares, current dissipation, or
magnetic wave dissipation. Within the above categories, theories can be further grouped into
DC and AC processes. With the AC processes, waves are generated and then dissipated to heat
the plasma. With the DC mechanism, stresses in the magnetic structures are slowly built up,
until a point is reached when instability occurs and a relaxation process releases the energy. For
recent reviews on the subject, see Narain and Ulmschneider (1996), Klimchuk (2006), Erdélyi
and Ballai (2007).
Current efforts are both on the observational side, to measure plasma properties, and on the
theoretical side. Modeling entire active regions is computationally very intensive and complex.
Three-dimensional MHD codes have begun to produce interesting results, however they still

gradients in density and temperature occur.
8.3.1 Coronal Heating in Loops
Active region loops are the brightest and geometrically simplest structures observed in the solar
corona. They have been studied extensively, in an attempt to better define the coronal heating
mechanism. It is well established that loops are arch-like structures of nearly constant cross
section which are connected to the photosphere where strong magnetic fragments of opposite
polarity are located. The pressure exerted by the magnetic field present in the corona is much
stronger than the dynamic pressure of the plasma, so loops can be considered as magnetic flux
tubes. In these conditions, the magnetic field is known to be frozen in with the plasma, i.e.,
magnetic fields always move with the plasma. Vice versa, plasma elements can freely move along
field lines but not across. It is also known that thermal conduction across magnetic field lines is
many orders of magnitude lower than conduction along field lines, so effectively coronal loops
can be modeled to a first approximation as one-dimensional flux tubes.
8.3.2 Hydrostatic Models and the RTV Scaling Laws
Historically, the first attempts to model coronal loops was with hydrostatic models. Rosner et al.
(1978) [RTV] studied observations recorded by the X-Ray Telescope aboard Skylab and devel-
oped a model of the solar corona, based on coronal loops. Rosner et al. (1978) extended the

166 3
The Sun as a Star
coronal loop model of Landini and Monsignori Fossi (1975) to study the relation of the physi-
cal quantities in the case of static equilibrium of a symmetric loop having constant cross section.
The equation for energy conservation then becomes
d
ds (κsT/dT
ds ) = ER −EH(s)
(3.31)
where s is the spatial coordinate along the loop; ER = N eΛ(T) are the radiative losses; EH is the
volumetric heating rate; T is the temperature; and κs is the coefficient for thermal conductivity.
The assumption of symmetry means that the heat flux should vanish at the loop top (s = L):
dT
ds ∣
s=L = , and the equation can be integrated by prescribing boundary conditions at the foot-
points and the form of the heating function EH(s). With the assumption that EH(s) and the
pressure are constant along the loop, and using an approximation for the radiative losses, RTV
showed that the maximum temperature Tmax (at the apex) is related to the pressure and the
semi-length L by the scaling law:
Tmax ≃.×(PL)/
(3.32)
and showed that, within a factor of 2, it appeared to fit the Skylab observations of the X-ray
loops well. RTV also derived a second scaling law:
EH ≃.×P/L−/.
(3.33)
Loops having the same pressures but longer lengths require less energy input. These scaling laws
have been applied for a long time in solar and stellar physics, however solar observations have
clearly shown that loops are very dynamic structures and detailed hydrodynamic modeling is
needed.
8.3.3 Hydrodynamic Models of Active Region Loops
It is common to neglect the details of the effect of the magnetic field on the heating by defining
a general heating function EH (the volumetric heating rate) and to solve the 1D hydrodynamic
equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation for a single-fluid loop, which in their
Eulerian form are:

where E = /ρυ+ /N e kT is the total energy, kinetic and internal of the fluid element;
s is the spatial coordinate along the loop; ρ is the mass density; g∥is the component of gravity
along the loop axis; T is the temperature.
The use of a single-fluid approach is only valid if all particles are thermalised. For the low
solar corona in quiet conditions, the thermal assumption (i.e., that particles follow a Maxwellian

distribution function) is not very stringent, since the relaxation time for e-e collisions is
τee ≃.T/N e−s = .s for T = and Ne = . After a time longer (mi/me)/≃,
the ions also become thermal, and after the same time factor, both species are thermalized, and
only one temperature can be used: T ≡Te = Ti.
Given its high temperature and low density, the coronal plasma follows the perfect gas law,
which can be written, once a single temperature is defined, as P = (R/μ)ρT = k(NeTe+NiTi) ≃
NkT.
Coronal plasma is mostly composed of protons, helium nuclei and electrons, hence the
temperature can be thought of an average value. P = N e kT is the total pressure, where N e
is the electron number density. k is Boltzmann’s constant. υ is the bulk velocity along the
loop; κs = .× −(cgs units) is the coefficient of thermal conduction, assuming classical
conductivity, see Spitzer (1965).
Λ(T) is the optically thin radiative loss function, i.e., is the sum of all the emissivities of
the lines and continuum (total power per unit emission measure). It is a function strongly
dependent on the temperature and the chemical abundances. > Figure 3-62 shows that the
main contributions are from oxygen, silicon, iron. The radiative losses also depend on the ion
abundances within each element.
The heating function EH is an often prescribed function of space and time, and the hydro-
dynamic response of the plasma is studied in detail and compared to observations. Priest et al.
(1998) attempted to match models with a specific set of X-ray observations. They showed that

the footpoint to apex temperature profile, calculated under the assumption of static equilib-
rium within the loop, is highly sensitive to the spatial distribution of heat deposition along
the loop. They compared predicted intensities from various theoretical models with specific
Yohkoh observations and found that a uniform heating model was most appropriate. Even
though their analysis was later shown to have some severe limitations, it did start a long and
fruitful debate on the heating mechanism for coronal loops, with further attempts to match
theory and observations.
To this purpose, several hydrodynamic codes have been developed to model the response
of coronal loops to different heating functions. For example, the HYD(rodynamic) and
RAD(iation) code (HYDRAD) (Bradshaw and Mason 2003) is a hydrodynamics code which
incorporates time-dependent ionization and forward modeling of emission from the solar
atmosphere. The predicted intensities for the spectral lines are critically dependent upon the
population of emitting ions and in traditional hydrodynamic models, these have been assumed
to remain in equilibrium throughout the evolution of the plasma. However, the timescale
for ionization in the solar atmosphere can be on the order of minutes. Thus, given activity
timescales on the order of seconds in solar loops, it is easy to see that the assumption of equi-
librium ion populations may not be valid (see, e.g., >Fig. 3-63). This has extremely important
consequences for the correct interpretation of observations, the accurate treatment of optically-
thin radiation in numerical models and forward-modeling studies derived from model results.
HYDRAD handles non-equilibrium ion populations in the solar atmosphere and the conse-
quences for optically-thin radiation, in a self-consistent way. The equations of hydrodynamics
and ionization balance are coupled together at each time step during the evolution of the
plasma.

8.3.4 Microﬂares and Nanoﬂares
Small flares with an energy content of −to −of a typical large flare are classified into
microflares and nanoflares. Microflares are observed not only in ARs but also in the QS regions.
Small-scale coronal activity is believed to be of importance for solving the coronal heating
problem. Parker (1988) was the first one to suggest that frequent small-scale magnetic recon-
nections producing nanoflares could be responsible for heating the solar corona. The idea was
further developed by Cargill (1994) and others. Basically these small-scale magnetic reconnec-
tions prevent indefinite tangling of coronal field lines and help dissipate the magnetic energy
stored in the magnetic field lines due to photospheric motions. Magnetic reconnection would
lead to particle acceleration. When the particles hit the loop footpoints, this would lead to the
evaporation of material. Searching for evidence of upflows (blueshifts in spectral lines) could
confirm such models. We do have some observational evidence for magnetic reconnections
in the corona and dissipation of magnetic energy into thermal energy in form of micro-flares,
flares, and CMEs. However, detection of nanoflares has so far been elusive. Although TRACE,
with its 1′′ spatial resolution, seems to resolve loops, it is possible that these loop structures
could be made up of many bundles of magnetic flux tubes (strands), each of which could be
heated separately.
One prediction from nanoflare heating models is the presence of plasma in the corona with
temperatures in excess of 5 MK. Various studies based on broadband imaging have suggested
the possibility that this hot plasma is present. However, spectroscopic measurments have so far
not shown conclusive evidence, and further studies are needed. With Hinode/EIS one can study
high-temperaturecoronal emission from Fe xvii and Ca xvii ions formed at peak temperatures
of log T = 6.6 and 6.7, respectively. Maps made in Fe xvii and Ca xvii emission indicate that
the hottest portions of the active region are localized at low heights in the active region core,
while further out the emission from hot material is much weaker (O’ Dwyer et al. 2010).
The solar corona exhibits a plethora of transient energy releasesovermany scales, from large
solar flares down to microflares. Active region microflares (or active region transient brighten-
ings)were first identified in X-rays with YOHKOH/SXT, possiblyassociated with the emergence
of new magnetic flux. About 1–40 of these events per active region per hour have been observed,
lasting a few minutes and reaching high temperatures (up to 10 MK) and electron densities
(10cm−). Microflares have about a million times less energy than a large flare. Microflares
have also been observed in EUV, however, five times as frequent as X-ray microflares.
Microflares originating from active regions seem from RHESSI observations to have a non-
thermal electron spectrum with a low energy cutoff.
Drake (1971) first noted that the distribution of flare energies W can be fit by a power law
function:
dN = AW−α dW
(3.37)
with a slope of α = .–1.8. Similar power laws were found in the radio and soft X-ray regions by
Lin et al. (1984), with α about 2. These authors pointed out that one may integrate this power law
distribution to determinethe total power emitted in transient brightening or micro-flare events.
If the slope is steep enough (α > ), these transient events would be sufficient to explain the qui-
escent heating of the solar corona. Many authors have found power law indexes lower or higher
than two, depending on which instrument was used. One example is given in >Fig. 3-64. One
major problem in these types of studies is the fact that what is often observed is a by-product
of the primary energy release, not the actual energy, as shown for example with a simulation by
Parenti et al. (2006).

Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections
9.1 Solar Flares
Solar flares are violent explosions in the solar atmosphere involving the sudden release of
energy: bursts of particle acceleration, plasma heating, and bulk mass motion (for reviews, cf.
Aschwanden 2006; Culhane and Jordan 1991; Phillips 1992; Sturrock 1980; and the living review
by Benz 2008). Over periods of less than an hour, a flare can release energy of up to ergs,
emitting high levels of radiation in wavelengths ranging from radio to short wavelength X-rays
and even gamma rays during large events. The energy range of flares extends over many orders
of magnitude. The currently accepted classification of flare size is based on the power irradiated
in the 1–8 Å channel of the Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellite (GOES) family. The
events are classified as belonging to class A, B, C, M, or X, if their peak emission increases over
10−, 10−, 10−, 10−, 10−W m−, respectively.
The first observations of solar flares were taken independently by R. C. Carrington and
R. Hodgson in 1859 (Carrington 1859). Carrington said “While engaged in the forenoon of
Thursday, Sept 1, in taking my customary observation of the forms and positions of the solar
spots, an appearance was witnessed which I believe to be exceedingly rare.” He goes on to
describe the appearance of “two patches of intensely bright and white light”, which we now
associate with the flare ribbons (footpoints of post-flare loops).

When observed at different wavelengths, flares have a very different temporal evolu-
tion. > Figure 3-65 (left) shows a typical example. Hard X-rays normally show an impulsive
behavior, the same observed in microwave radio emission, and thought to be related to nonther-
mal processes. The EUV emission also shows some impulsive behavior, due to low-temperature
line emission, however the bulk of the emission is thermal and occurs during the gradual decay-
ing phase (see >Fig. 3-65, right). Soft X-ray emission normally shows peak emission after the
hard X-ray peak, and is followed by the gradual phase.
During a solar flare, the temperature can rise in excess of 10 MK, so that the plasma emits
strongly in the EUV and X-rays. A typical two-ribbon flare is characterized by morphologi-
cal features which include separating ribbons of chromospheric Hα emission (>Fig. 3-66, lhs)
joined by a rising arcade of hot but rapidly cooling EUV loops (>Fig. 3-66, rhs), with hard X-ray
emission at their summits and at their feet (as seen by RHESSI). Many events are normally asso-
ciated with large flares, for example, filament eruption, acceleration of large numberof particles,
triggering of vast ejecta (Coronal Mass Ejections, see below).

Flares are believed to be driven by stored non-potential magnetic energy and triggered by
an instability in the magnetic configuration. This sudden release of energy and the transport of
this energy are still not well understood. There is evidence (for example from the hard and soft
X-rays) that both thermal and nonthermal processes occur in flares.
As described in >Fig. 3-67, a general interpretation of the observed flare features is that
particles are somehow accelerated by the magnetic energy released higher up in the corona
and are transported down to the footpoints of the loop structures. The energetic electrons then
loose all their energy in Coulomb collisions with the dense ambient cold plasma (thick-target
nonthermal bremsstrahlung, see, e.g., Brown 1971), giving rise to strong radio, hard X-ray, UV,
and even white light. The thick-target nonthermal bremsstrahlung is however very inefficient,
and far too many electrons (compared to those available in the corona) need to be accelerated
to high energies. Other theories still accept the presence of coronal reconnection in the corona,
but advocate the presence of Alfvén waves to transport the energy down (see, e.g., Fletcher and
Hudson 2008 and references therein).
Although not all flares can be explained by a single model, it is generally accepted that a
standard model for the gradual phase that fits most observations and that is theoretically well
understood exists. The most widelyaccepted flare model is known as the CSHKP standard model

(based on the original work of Carmichael, Sturrock, Hirayama, Kopp and Pneuman). In this
scenario, an instability causes a filament to rise, which, in turn, causes the magnetic field to
be opened up (> Fig. 3-68). The rapid temperature increase during the impulsive phase pro-
duces an enhanced pressure in the heated region. This overpressure drives downward-moving
cool plasma and evaporation from the lower solar atmosphere (chromosphere) during the flare
gradual (or decay) phase. This results in a hot (over 10 MK) plasma filling the magnetic loop
structures in the corona which have several thousand kilometers altitude. This plasma then
cools by conduction and radiation forming post-flare loop structures.

The Sun as a Star
One of the limitations in testing theoretical predictions of chromospheric evaporation and
cooling has been a lack of spectroscopic measurements that cover a broad range of tempera-
tures during the lifetime of a flare with sufficient spatial resolution. Earlier observations have
been performed with various instruments, but there were limitations mainly in their spatial
capability. Blue-shifted components of a few hundred km s−have been reported in H- and
He-like lines observed in the X-rays, for example, with the SMM X-ray polychromator (XRP)
Bent Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) (see, e.g., Antonucci et al. 1982) which did not have spa-
tial resolution. The blueshifted components were thought to be located at the footpoints of the
X-ray loops. Some spatial resolution was obtained with the SMM Ultraviolet Spectrometer and
Polarimeter (UVSP, see Mason et al. 1986) and XRP Flat Crystal Spectrometer (FCS) observa-
tions, however it was only with SoHO CDS observations that more information was obtained.
Czaykowska et al. (1999) confirmed that strong blueshifts in hot Fe xvi (× K) and Fe xix
(×K) lines were located at the outer edges of the flare ribbons, as expected with the CSHKP
model. Del Zanna et al. (2002a) presented the first spatially resolved spectral observations of
the entire evolution of a small flare, where long-lasting (over an hour) blueshifts of 30 km s−
at the footpoints of a small flare (T = 9 MK) loop were present. Del Zanna et al. (2006a) con-
firmed expectation from theory that at the flare kernels, during the impulsive phase of an M1
class flare, strong upflows, progressively larger at higher temperatures (reaching 140 km/s for
T = 9 MK) are seen together with small downflows in the cooler lines. Important contributions
in this field are expected from Hinode EIS observations.
9.2 Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), often associated with solar flares, are also spectacular and
violent phenomena in the solar atmosphere which propagate through the heliosphere and can
impinge on the near-Earth environment. The flare which was observed by Lord Carrington in
1859 led to a gigantic CME, large enough to have serious consequences had it happened in
the modern-day technology-based era. Remote sensing and in situ measurements from vari-
ous spacecraft over the past decade or more have revealed that CMEs are the prime agents for
interplanetary shock waves, solar energetic particle events, and geomagnetic storms.
A CME is defined as an observable change in the coronal structure which occurs on a
timescale between a few minutes and several hours, and also involves the appearance and out-
ward motion of a new, discrete, bright, white-light feature in the coronagraph field of view
(Hundhausen et al. 1984). CMEs consist of clouds of hot plasma expelled from the Sun with
propagation speeds of up to 3,000 km s−, and with a mass of 10kg or more. Both flares and
CMEs can accelerate electrons and ions which travel through interplanetary space as far as the
Earth’s orbit and beyond. The CME is often preceded as a shock front which, when it reaches
the Earth, may result into a magnetic storm. Therefore, flares and CMEs can influence the space
weather and human activities both in space and on the ground.
CMEs were systematically observed with coronagraphs aboard Skylab (1973–1974), SOL-
WIND on board P78-1 and the Corona/Polarimeter on board Solar Maximum Mission (SMM,
1984–1989). Since 1996, the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) aboard SoHO
has provided unique observations of CMEs. An example of a spectacular CME is shown
in >Fig. 3-69 as a sequence of four images obtained by LASCO on Apr-20-1998. In the fig-
ure the white solid circles indicate the solar limb in the shadow of the coronagraphic occulting

outward in the following images. This feature moved outward through the corona with a speed
of about 1,863 km s−. A recent collection of reviews and papers can be found in ‘Coronal mass
ejections’ (Kunow et al. 2006). The recent launch of the STEREO spacecraft has provided more
CME observations.
The identification of the source regions, the triggering and acceleration mechanisms of
CMEs have been the subject of intensive research in solar physics since their detection in the
1970s. Many features have a close but not unique association with CMEs and are still not well
understood. For example, solar flares are often observed in close association with CMEs. It is
generally believed that both flares and CMEs are triggered by a common magnetic instability,
the details of which remain unknown.
Filaments (also referred to as prominences if observed as bright features over the solar limb)
consist of cool material at chromospheric temperatures of about 60,000 K (>Fig. 3-70 - right).

Filaments are often observed to erupt during a flare or CME process. Very often, filaments dur-
ing the pre-eruption phase slowly rise into the corona. During the eruption, the height normally
grows exponentially, and both the filament and the filament-carrying field move together (e.g.,
Rust 1976). When erupting filaments are associated with a CME, they are sometimes recog-
nized as a bright core in white light images, following a leading edge and a dark cavity, as shown
in >Fig. 3-71. However, many CMEs do not show this structure.
Other features associated with CMEs are coronal dimmings (temporary darkenings in
the corona) and apparent “waves” (EUV brightenings that are seen propagating outward).
The brightening in X-rays of S-shaped (∼2×K) coronal loop structures, called sigmoids
(see > Fig. 3-72), has been found to frequently precede CMEs. The sigmoid structures are
probably the result of twisted magnetic fields. Shearing and stressing of magnetic field lines
above the magnetic neutral line may lead to the helical structure which are S-shaped in pro-
jection. When the helical twist exceeds a critical value, the structure might become unstable,
producing a disruption of the magnetic field leading to the expulsion of a filament or CME. The
S-shaped structure may flare and transform itself into a set of bright loops during the launch of
a CME. The active region itself evolves from a sheared sigmoid seen in X-rays to a potential-like
post-eruption arcade, as shown in >Fig. 3-72.
Several studies have found preflare activity such as small X-ray and EUV brightenings at
the onset of the filament’s slow rise, which could trigger the eruption. These brightenings are
often associated with emerging magnetic flux.
9.3 Theoretical Concepts of CME Initiation
The driver in the CSHKP model is a rising filament, but the magnetic pre-evolution that leads up
to the flare and CME instability is not quantified in the various concepts of the CSHKP models.

Several eruption models proposed in the literature involve emerging flux. A review of the ideas
to date for the initiation of solar eruptions may be found in Moore and Sterling (2006). They
described each of the three basic triggers models (internal tether-cutting (>Fig. 3-73), external
tether-cutting, and an ideal MHD [e.g., kink]instability) for the case when the erupting filament
sustained by a sheared core field is situated in the central lobe of a quadrupolar magnetic field
configuration.
Breakout models (e.g., Antiochos 1998) predict that reconnection occurs high above the
prominence before the eruption, while tether-cutting mechanisms imply that reconnection
beneath the prominence unleashes the explosion. Prior to the explosion, the core magnetic field
suspending the filament is in force-free equilibrium (Moore and Sterling 2006), the magnetic
pressure being balanced by the field’s own magnetic tension as well as tension and pressure
from surrounding fields. An evolutionary model that starts with a stable (force-free) magnetic
field configuration, then applies converging flows as a continuous driver, and demonstrateshow

The exponential growth in the early phases of filament eruptions associated with CMEs
naturally invokes the presence of some MHD instability. Various successful models of filament
eruptions include the helical kink instability of the filament/flux rope (Kliem et al. 2004) and
the torus instability (Kliem and Török 2006).
9.4 Flares on Other Stars
Stellar flares have been observed in the visible since the late 1930s in active M-type stars. There
is a strong nonthermal continuum in the UV which contributes significantly to the ultraviolet
broadbands used in ground-based observations. The dMe stars are the most active and flare-
productive stars in our neighborhood. Stellar flares were later observed at all wavelengths, in
the radio and with satellites from the UV to the X-rays. As we have seen, one key feature of
flares is the sudden heating to temperatures greater than 10 MK, giving rise to strong emission
in the EUV and X-rays.
The EXOSAT carried Transmission Grating Spectrometers (TGS) which recorded XUV
(50–400 Å) spectra for a few stars. EINSTEIN carried three spectrometers with different

resolutions which alsoobtained X-rayspectra ofa few sources. ROSAT carried broadband X-ray
instruments, which was of limited use for diagnostics. All these early X-ray satellites showed the
presence of hot plasma up to a few times 10K in many stellar sources.
The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and later
FUSE have provided the capability of observing UV emission with spectroscopic instrumenta-
tion. With the exception of a few weak forbidden lines formed at flare temperatures, the UV is
dominated by emission lines formed in the stellar chromospheres and transition regions.
The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) satellite carried three grazing incidence spec-
trometers which observed (in three bands)the 70–760Å wavelength region. These observations
are very rich in diagnostics for flares, in particular with regard to the measurement of elec-
tron densities. Temperature sensitivity is also provided, but only by observations of lines from
different ions, e.g., Fe xviii, Fe xx, Fe xxi, Fe xxiii. The sensitivity of EUVE allowed the first
time-resolved spectroscopy of a flare in the EUV (Del Zanna 1995, later published in ApJ,
see > Fig. 3-74), indicating, as in the solar case, that high temperatures and densities were
reached during the peak phase.

XMM-Newton RGS spectra during quiescence and a ﬂare in Proxima Centauri (Adapted from Güdel
et al. 2004, courtesy of M. Güdel)
The XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites, launched in 1999, carried X-ray spectroscopic
instruments and have been used to observe many flares in a few nearby stars. The X-rays are
rich in strong lines emitted at high temperatures (cf. >Fig. 3-75), but are comparatively poor in
diagnostic capabilities, except for the He-like ions. The spectral resolution of the XMM-Newton
and Chandra instruments is much lower than that attained with solar instruments, so diagnostic
capabilities are more limited. The next generation of X-ray instrumentation (IXO) should allow
more detailed studies of stellar flares, having much higher spectral resolution and sensitivity.
Time-resolved spectroscopy of flares is still largely beyond the current instrumental capa-
bilities, although some diagnostics based on a few of the strongest lines have been obtained.
For example, a large flare in Proxima Centauri allowed the measurement of flare lines
(see >Fig. 3-75, Fe xxiv, Fe xxiii) and of changes in He-like lines (Güdel et al. 2004).
In the large majority of cases, stellar flares have similar characteristics to the solar ones,
with the main difference being that luminosities and temperatures are often much larger. For
some large stellar flares, temperatures of 100 MK or more have been reported (see the review of
Güdel and Nazé 2009), however direct measurements were not obtained and did not take into
account the large nonthermal effects which occur in large flares. In the Sun, larger flares have
the tendency to have larger emission measures and temperatures, however direct measurements
(from line ratios) of temperatures from high-resolution X-rays rarely indicated temperatures
above 15 MK (see the review of Doschek 1990).

Young stars have veryhot and dense coronae (typical oflarge solarflares)even in quiescence.
The strong magnetic fields measured in these stars suggests that the quiescent state is actually
due to continuous flaring, an issue which has not yet been confirmed unambiguously. It has
been known for a long time that there is a correlation between estimates of magnetic flux and
X-ray luminosity, and that this extends from solar active region core loops to the largest stellar
flares, as >Fig. 3-76 shows.
A large number of open questions about the X-ray quiescent and flaring emission are still
present. It is not clear yet what dynamo mechanism is active in different stars. It is not known
if stars have active regions as is the case of the Sun, and if flares are really similar and can be
explained with the same models as the solar ones.

Solar Wind
By the late nineteenth century, there was substantial evidence of terrestrial effects (magnetic
storms and aurorae) being correlated with solar activity (e.g., flares), so it was clear that the
Sun had a direct influence on a variety of terrestrial phenomena. An obvious candidate was the
direct irradiance from the Sun, but other suggestions soon emerged. As early as 1900, Birke-
land proposed that aurorae were due to particles (electrons) emanating from the Sun. The idea
was superseded in the 1930s with Chapman and Ferraro’s explanation in terms of solar plasma
clouds, which is close to our present understanding.
Observations of the tails of comets (Biermann 1951) also suggested the presence of a solar
wind (SW) emanating from the Sun in all directions, with velocities of 500–1,000 km/s. From
1939, it was also known that the solar corona had a temperature of 1 MK. S. Chapman in 1957

The Sun as a Star 3
183
suggested that the solarcorona was made upofionized gas in a stationarycondition. At that time
the heat flux for thermal conduction by a cloud of electrons and protons was known, the main
conductors being the electrons. By assuming spherical symmetry and a static corona, as well as
a constant conductive flux, it was straightforward to show that Chapman’s modelwas unrealistic
because it predicted finite pressures and divergent densities toward infinity. E.N. Parker knew
that the energy in a gas naturally goes into an ordered flow (kinetic energy) and a disordered
one (pressure), so it was sufficient to introduce an ordered flow (a coronal expansion) to fix the
problem. Parker (1958) brilliantly explained that Biermann’s suggestion was perfectly consistent
with the natural thermal expansion of the solar corona, a plasma at 1 MK.
To understand Parker’s solution it is necessary to simplify the hydrodynamic equations, by
considering spherical symmetry, with a stationary (∂/∂t = ) and adiabatic (d S/d t = , where
S is the entropy of the gas) flow for a perfect gas (single fluid). The equations for conservation
of mass, momentum, and energy can then be written in radial coordinates:

cs = γP/ρ. γ is the ratio of specific heats, and P = R/μT/ρ is the perfect gas law, with R
the Avogadro number and μ the mean molecular weight. The solutions of the equation (mass
loss) can be grouped into four types, and are shown in the >Fig. 3-77. The profile of the velocity
as a function of radial distance is shown in terms of the Mach number, the ratio of the velocity
υ to the sound speed cs. There are subsonic solutions (the breezes, region I in the figure), where
the velocity is always below the sound speed. These lie below the two transonic solutions, which
are the curves that intersect at Mach number = 1. The transonic solution that has a very large
velocity close to the Sun is not physical, and is not supported by observations. The accelerating
transonic solution is of particular interest not only because the velocity starts from zero at the
Sun, but also because the density and pressure tend to zero at infinity. This behavior close to
and very far from the Sun represents not only a physical solution for the solar case, but also the
only one which is stable. This solution also implies that the velocity of the solar wind has to be
supersonic near Earth.

zero for large values of r. The same is true for the pressure, since P ∼ρT. For an isothermal
temperature of 10K, the simple model predicts a velocity of 100 km/s at 1 AU, a value which
is of the same order as the measured one.
The idea that a supersonic solar wind could exist was not initially accepted by the majority
of researchers; however very soon Parker’s predictions were confirmed. The Soviet Lunik 1 and
2 missions were launched in 1959, and made the first measurements of the solar wind. The
definitive proofofa supersonicsolarwind was made publicafterthe measurements ofthe NASA
Mariner 2 satellite which flew to Venus in 1962. Velocities of 300–700 km/s were measured. It
has been clear from the first solar wind measurements that Parker’s idea was correct. Indeed,
Parker’s model explains quite well the mainstream slow component of the solar wind, which
has a velocity of about 400 km/s and is predominant within the ecliptic.

10.1 The Heliosphere
Parker also suggested that a radial flow of the SW, combined with the solar rotation, would pro-
duce a spiral heliospheric magnetic field in the solar equatorial plane, which is what is observed.
A good review of the heliosphere near solar minimum (1996) with significant Ulysses contri-
butions is the book by Balogh et al. (2001). A more recent review of the heliosphere through
the last activity cycle is the book edited by Balogh et al. (2008). A recent review on the structure
of the global heliospheric field and its connection, both observationally (Ulysses, SoHO) and
theoretically, is given by Zurbuchen (2007).
The heliospheric magnetic field is weak (about 5nT) but omnipresent and has the important
effect of shielding the solar system from cosmogenic cosmic rays (GCR). The charged energetic
particles are deflected when strong magnetic fields are present. Indeed, there is a clear rela-
tion between solar activity (hence heliospheric magnetic field density) and the flux of GCRs
observed within the solar system. This was already suggested by Davis (1955) even before the
presence of the solar wind was proposed.
It is well known now that a vast number of stellar classes have a hot corona similar to the
Sun, so it is natural to expect that stellar winds are a common feature. P Cygni line profiles have
been observed in hot stars, and are thought to be caused by radiation-pressure-driven winds.
Also red giants and supergiants produce massive winds. Winds in solar-like stars are difficult
to observe, and it is only since HST observations of H i absorption in the Lyα line that indirect
evidence was provided for stellar winds similar to those of the Sun (see the review by Wood
2004).
One subtle issue is that the external pressure of the interstellar medium is not zero. It would
not require a strong pressure to actually inhibit the solar wind and to have a static corona. For
example, a pressure of 1.24 10−dyne cm−would be enough to confine a 4 10K static corona
with a density of 10cm−. The dependence of the solar wind on the external conditions has
been studied in detail by Velli (1994).
Several satellites have orbited nearby planets, but others have gone further afield, to the edge
of the solar system, for example Pioneers 10 (launched in 1972) and 11 and the Voyager 1 and 2,
launched in 1977. By 1997, the Pioneer missions were terminated, while the Voyager missions
are still operating.
At the edge of the Heliosphere, the solar wind must encounter and interact with the local
interstellar medium (LISM). (see Zank (1999) for a good theoretical review). It was once
thought that the boundary was very distant, about 100 AU or more. It was expected that there
should be a termination shock followed by a region, called the heliosheath, where the solar wind
is slowed down by the pressure of interstellar gas. Indeed Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 crossed the
termination shock in 2004 in 2007 and are currently inside the heliosheath, continuing their
amazing journey. The data from these crossings suggest the presence of an unexpectedly strong
interstellar magnetic field of about 5 μG.
10.2 Physical Characteristics of the Solar Wind and Models
A great deal is known about the solar wind from a range of satellites, in particular from the two
German Helios satellites, which were launched in 1976 and which observed the inner Helio-
sphere between 0.29 and 1 AU for many years, providing a wealth of data. For a summary
of early results from these two missions, see the two books by Schwenn and Marsch (1990)
and Schwenn and Marsch (1991). Peculiar aspects of these satellites were their closeness to the

186 3
The Sun as a Star
Sun, and the ability to measure the particle distribution functions. Anisotropic (i.e., far from
Maxwellian) distributions have been found, in particular in the fast SW. More recently, a large
number of satellites with in situ instruments have been operating, for example, the Advanced
Composition Explorer (ACE), Wind, SoHO, and STEREO.
The properties ofthe solarwind close tothe Sun are alsoobtained byindirect measurements,
by the scintillation of the radio signals from distant objects such as quasars when their line of
sight is close to the Sun. The signal is modulated by the density and flow velocity fluctuations,
and with many line-of-sight measurements it is possible to construct a map of the solar wind
speed, which appears to increase very close to the Sun (within 20–30 R⊙). The first array of
detectors were build by A. Hewish at Cambridge University, and nowadays many such arrays
exist over the world.
The particle velocity is radial, with values in the range 300–800 km s−. Note that the wind
needs about 4–5 days to reach Earth, and a few months to reach the outermost planets. The
main plasma constituents (95%) are protons and electrons, with the rest mainly α particles. The
Coulomb drag is caused by the interactions between ions and protons, and results in all minor
ions (i.e., ions form all elements except H, He) to move at equal speeds with the protons, a fact
which is observed in the SW. The velocity distribution is mainly bimodal, with a highly variable,
slow component around 400 km s−, and a fast one, more steady around 750 km s−.
Close to Earth, at 1 AU, the characteristics of the slow SW are: the mean temperatures:
Te ≃.× ; Tp ≃× ; Tα ≃× K; the intensity of the magnetic field is in the range
−× −G; the plasma β is typically around 1–2, though becomes larger than 3 in the fast
SW; the sound speed is about 40 km/s, of the same order of the Alfvèn speed. So the solar wind
is not only supersonic, but also super-Alfvènic. The number density is very low, of the order of
15 particles cm−.
The fast SW has lower densities by about one third, similar electron temperatures but much
higher proton and α-particle temperatures, by a factor of 4.
Close to the Sun, the atmosphere can be approximated quite well to first order with a hydro-
static solution, which predicts that the density falls off exponentially with an hydrostatic scale
height H = RT/μg. The approximate exponential drop off in density has been confirmed by
observations. The very low density close to the Sun means that at just two solar radii the plasma
is not collisionally dominated, i.e., the electrons and protons do not exchange sufficient energy
to thermalise. As a consequence, electrons and protons can have very different temperatures.
Considering a 2-fluid plasma composed of electrons and protons, it is expected that the proton
temperature would decrease much faster than the electron temperature, given that the thermal
conduction for the electrons is about (mp/me)/≃times larger. The first two-fluid model of
the solar wind, by Sturrock and Hartle (1966), produced Te quite close to the observed values
at 1 AU, but Tp was about an order of magnitude lower than observed. The predicted plasma
velocity was about 250 km/s at 1 AU.
Clearly, the simple thermal expansion idea from Parker was able to explain the gross prop-
erties of the solar wind, but in reality there must be some acceleration processes that increase
the velocity of the particles and heat them (in particular the protons). The situation is even more
complex in the case of the high-speed component which cannot be explained by Parker’s model.
The presence of a high-speed solar wind creates compression regions corotating with the
Sun, as slow and fast wind streams originating from the same solar latitude, but from different
longitudes interact dynamically.
The discovery of Alfvèn waves appeared to provide a way to solve the problem of the heat-
ing and acceleration of the solar wind. Belcher and Davis (1971) used data from Mariner 5 to

The Sun as a Star 3
187
show that for a large fraction of the time Alfvèn waves are present and dominate the microscale
structure of the wind, in particular of the high-speed one. The waves are of large amplitude
and propagate outwards from the Sun, with long periods (hours). They have energy densities
comparable both to the unperturbed magnetic field energy density and to the thermal energy
density. Wave-driven wind models started to be constructed, by including a wave pressure and
dissipation/plasma heating. These models were successful in explaining the fast solar wind, but
only far from the Sun. Subsequent models assumed that close to the Sun Alfvèn waves of high
frequencies are created, which in turn would preferentially heat the protons via the cyclotron
resonance (when the wave frequency matches the cyclotron frequency). According to these
models, the solar wind would mainly be driven by the hot protons. Details and references can
be found in a recent review by Hollweg (2008).
The solar wind is a highly turbulent medium. For a review of the observational and the-
oretical aspects, see the living review by Bruno & Carbone (2005). One major new findings
from the SoHO UVCS spectrometer was the very large widths in the H i and O vi lines above
coronal holes. By assuming that nonthermal broadening due to waves or turbulence is negligi-
ble, very large ion temperatures were found. For example, × K at 3.5 R⊙from O vi. Many
authors now regard these measurements as proof that preferential heating due to ion-cyclotron
resonance is occurring, however more measurementsof different ions would be needed to con-
firm this, and a theory of how high-frequency Alfvèn waves can be generated close to the Sun
needs to be developed. For observational aspects, see the review by Kohl et al. (2006), while for
theoretical considerations see the living review by Marsch (2006).
10.3 The Sources of the Solar Wind
Coronal holes as the source of the fast solar wind was first established from Skylab X-ray obser-
vations and in-situ measurements by Krieger et al. (1973). This is now well-accepted. Doppler
measurements by SoHO/SUMER clearly show blueshifted emission in coronal holes at the net-
work boundaries (see, e.g., Hassler et al. 1999, and >Fig. 3-78), confirming the source of the
fast solar wind.
Whether or not coronal hole plumes and jets contribute to the fast solar wind is still a matter
of hot debate.Opposite arguments, mainly based on SoHO and Hinode observations, have been
put forward. The difficulty lies in mapping back the in situ measurements,mainly velocities and
magnetic fields, onto the Sun’s surface.
It is still not entirely clear where the slow SW originates from. Many believe that comes
from the boundaries between coronal holes and large streamers that undergo strong super-
radial expansion in the corona, while others believe that it comes from narrow plasma sheets
that extend out from the tops of streamer cusps.
One major contribution from the SoHO LASCO coronagraph has been the finding of the
continuous large number of bubbles leaving the lower corona all the time. The plasmoids are
observed to accelerate to an average velocity of about 300 km/s between 5 and 25 R⊙. The aver-
age velocity profile is consistent with an isothermal solar wind at 1.1 MK and a sonic point near
5 R⊙, in good agreement with the simple original Parker’s model.
LASCO has also shown that CMEs provide an important contribution to the solar wind (in
terms of mass and magnetic field), in particular during high solar activity, when many CMEs
occur per day. During minimum conditions, the rate of CME production is about one order of
magnitude lower.

10.4 Ulysses
Ulysses encountered the fast SW streaming out from the polar holes in 1992–1993. It crossed
the south pole in June–November 1994 and the north pole in June–September 1995. During this
time, the Sun was in solar minimum conditions for cycle 22. Extended polar coronal holes were
present and symmetric, well-defined, streamers were present. Ulysses showed that the solid
angle occupied by the fast SW is much larger than the solid angle occupied by the coronal hole
at the solar surface, an indication of super-radial expansion. It also showed that the heliospheric
magnetic field was mainly symmetric and dipolar. Pressure-balance (a decrease of magnetic
pressure balanced by an increase of plasma pressure) structures were observed in the fast SW
and were interpreted as the interplanetary manifestations of polar plumes.
Contrary to expectations, and Parker’s model, the radial magnetic field strength was found
to be nearly constant with latitude. Indeed the magnetic flux density rBr was found to be
constant with latitude by Ulysses. Ulysses clearly showed that the magnetic field embedded
in the fast solar wind originates in coronal holes and fills over 60% of the heliosphere near
solar minimum. Ulysses performed its second polar pass during the rise and peak phase of the
solar maximum for cycle 23. It showed a complex, highly variable structure at all heliolatitudes,
composed of flows arising from different sources (streamers, coronal mass ejections, coronal
holes, and active regions). Ulysses has also provided important chemical abundance measure-
ments, discussedin the abundance section, and empirical constraints on the temperaturesat the
freezing-in radius. The freezing-in radius is the distance from the Sun center where the expan-
sion time of the solar wind equals the exchange time between the ions. Various assumptions
have to be made, in order to deduce these kinds of temperatures, e.g., the expansion model, the
charge state distribution, the elemental abundance, the distribution function of the electrons,
the relative flow speeds of the different charge states. Different values are present in the litera-
ture. For many years, it seemed that a large discrepancy between results from the in situ and the
remote-sensing observations was present, with the freezing-in temperatures being 2–3 times
larger. Gloeckler and Geiss (2007) have recently re-evaluated Ulysses SWICS measurements to

Polar plot of the solar wind speed as a function of heliographic latitude observed by Ulysses during
the two/three polar passes during minimum and maximum (From McComas et al. 2008)
find a freezing-in temperature in fast SW from coronal holes of only 1.1 MK, in relatively good
agreement with recent remote-sensing measurements at the base of the corona (cf. Del Zanna
et al. 2008). The plasma freezing-in temperature, calculated from the observed O+/O+ ratio
by Ulysses, correlates well with the solar wind speed, confirming that the fast SW originates in
low-temperature regions of the corona.
Another important result from Ulyssesis that, unexpectedly, the number of GCRs measured
did not increase at higher latitudes. A North-South asymmetry in the radial field component,
with the field being stronger in the South was another key discovery. These types of asymmetries
have recently received a great deal of attention, because they might be related to the overall
change in the heliosphere which started around 2004, just after the last peak of activity (2001–
2002). The polar fields also appear to be significantly lower than expected.
Ulysses completed a third polar pass during its third orbit in 2007. Preliminary results are
presented in McComas et al. (2008) (see >Fig. 3-79). The last pass showed that the fast solar
wind occupied a much reduced solid angle, compared to the previous minimum conditions,
where the heliospheric magnetic field was closer to dipolar. The third orbit also showed that the
fast wind was slightly slower and significantly less dense and cooler, when compared to the 1996
solar minimum. This resulted in much lower dynamic (by 22%) and thermal (by 25%) pressures.
The significant, long-term trend toward lowerdynamicpressures means that the heliosphere has
been shrinking. This could possibly be the cause of the early crossings of the termination shock
by Voyager 1 in 2004 and Voyager 2 in 2007. After more than 18 years of operation, the Ulysses
mission terminated on June 30, 2009.

Solar Irradiance
11.1 Introduction
No one can deny the crucial influence that the Sun has on the Earth’s climate. The total
amount of solar radiation reaching unit area of the Earth’s atmosphere is called the total solar

190 3
The Sun as a Star
irradiance (TSI). The TSI is the main heating input to our climate, and directly affects the sur-
face temperatures, given that the bulk of the photons are emitted at visible wavelengths, hence
are not significantly absorbed by the atmosphere.
The solar irradiance is of particular importance for the study of the Sun as a star, since it is
the only case where detailed information about the distribution of the sources on its surface is
available. Hence, it is the only case where predictions of the irradiance can be tested in detail.
The only drawback is the fact that all the measurements to date have been done within the
ecliptic.
The variations in the solar influence on our planet are not simply due to inherent varia-
tions in solar energy. Actually, significant variations in solar forcing on our planet are due to
the Milankovitch cycles, i.e., changes in the eccentricity (∼100,000 years), the obliquity (angle
between the equator and the orbital plane) (∼40,000 years) and the precession of the Earth’s axis
(∼20,000 years).
Aside from the total solar irradiance, there are three other key mechanisms which might
impact the Earth’s climate: (1) Solar UV and X-ray irradiance, which directly affects the tem-
perature and composition of the upper and middle atmosphere (e.g., the amount of Ozone).
Changes in UV, X-ray, and total solar irradiance vary in phase with the 11-year solar cycle.
When the Sun is active, there is higher solar irradiance, with large increases in UV and
X-ray emission. (2) Solar energetic particles, which ionize constituents of the middle and upper
atmosphere, affecting atmospheric chemistry and temperature. (3) Galactic cosmic rays, which
ionize constituents of the lower atmosphere and may thereby seed the formation of clouds.
The linkages between total solar irradiance (the dominant mechanism) and climate are
included in climate models, but the other three mechanisms are generally not included. Some
models do include changes in UV, but not the associated effects on atmospheric chemistry. It
is important that sophisticated, integrated models are developed, in order to fully understand
and predict the complex interaction between the Sun and the Earth.
11.2 Total Solar Irradiance, TSI, and Surface Temperature
The TSI was once known as the solar constant. It has been measured on the ground for a long
time. An extensive set of measurements were obtained by Langley and others (Smithsonian
Institution of Washington) from 1902 until the 1960s, with an averaged value of 1,353 W m−.
Large (50% or so) corrections due to atmospheric absorption are required, and therefore some
uncertainties are present.
More accurate measurements have been carried out with instruments in space. The Earth
Radiation Budget (ERB) cavity instrument on board the NASA Nimbus satellite, launched in
1978, started to obtain irradiance measurements from space. The Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) instrument aboard SMM provided data between 1980 and 1989.
These instruments were very precise and detected variations on all timescales, from daily ones
of 0.01% or so, to weekly ones of up to 0.25%, and long-term ones of about 0.15% along the
solar cycle [see Fröhlich and Lean (2004) for a review of measurements of the solar irradiance].
It soon became clear that the dips in the total irradiance which lasted a few days were related to
the meridian passage of large Sunspot groups. On the other hand, general variations are due to a
fine balance between the decrease in irradiance due to cooler (darker) emission in Sunspots and
the bright UV emission in plage/faculae areas. One interesting fact is that the areas covered by

The Sun as a Star 3
191
faculae vs. sunspots grows with activity relative to sunspots. It is still unclear how this relation
applies to active stars.
Many other instruments have measured the TSI, including the Earth Radiation Budget
Experiment (ERBE), the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), the European Retriev-
able Carrier (EURECA), the SoHO VIRGO (with two instruments), ACRIMSAT, and most
recently the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE), with the Total Irradiance
Monitor (TIM).
>Figure 3-80 (left) shows a composite of some of the measurements. The Nimbus, SMM,
and UARS data were obtained from the US National Geophysical Data Center at NOAA. The
SoHO VIRGO data are the version 2, which includes various corrections for instrument degra-
dation. They were obtained from PMOD/WRC, Davos, Switzerland. The SORCE/TIM data
were obtained from the instrument database. Large uncertainties in the absolute value of the
solar constant exist, given that over the last 30 years there has been a large scatter of values.
The latest measurements from SORCE are not consistent with previous ones but are thought
to be the most accurate, providing a value of about 1361 W m−during the period of low solar
activity in 2007–2009. The long-term trends due to the solar cycle are evident. >Figure 3-80
(right) shows a composite of the TSI values. It seems that the latest minimum was significantly
lower than previous ones (Fröhlich 2009).
Further measurements will be obtained in the future. For example, PICARD is a new space
mission dedicated to simultaneous measurements of the solar diameter, and of the spectral and
total solar irradiance.
The issue as to whether the characteristics of the regions of the Sun with small magneticfield
density are changing with the cycle is a complex one. Radiance measurementsfrom space in the
EUV and UV suffer from instrument calibration issues. Ground-based measurementsof equiv-
alent widths (EW) are independent from radiometric calibration issues, hence are very reliable.
The EW of photospheric and chromospheric lines (e.g., Ca ii) over the “quiet Sun” (often Sun
center) have not changed over the last three solar cycles (Livingston et al. 2007), thus providing
evidence that the basal photospheric–chromospheric emission has been relatively constant over
this period.
In the last decade, some effort has gone into modeling the solar irradiance. The reasons are
twofold. One goal is to provide reliable input to climate models. Currently, most climate models
use various proxies for the solar activity and some use averaged spectral irradiances. Another
goal is to model the effects of the magnetic activity in young stars (including the young Sun)
on planets. Recently, there has been particular interest in predicting the environment in which
young planets were formed. The strong UV and EUV irradiance in young stars is an important
factor for the development of life. The same is true for the Sun.
Models of solar irradiance are inherently semiempirical and have large uncertainties, given
that are based upon a large number of assumptions and indirect measurements (i.e., on proxies
of solar activity). One proxy widely used is the sunspot number. In fact, records of sunspots
exist from the early seventeenth century, for example, from Galileo Galilei. This sunspot proxy is
rather crude, given that various visibility effects are present (see, e.g., Dalla et al. 2008; Maunder
1907). >Figure 3-81 (top) shows the Group Sunspot Number, obtained by Hoyt and Schatten
(1998) from a vast collection of archival data.
For a recent example of irradiance reconstruction see, e.g., Krivova et al. (2007), who esti-
mated, based on the ideas developed by Solanki et al. (2002), the total irradiance since 1611
using the Group Sunspot Number. The data are displayed in
>Fig. 3-81 (middle). Many such
reconstructions exist in the literature, each differing in some respect. Large uncertainties are

in TSI in the last 400 years.
It has been suggested (cf. Eddy 1976) that a relation exists between total solar irradiance
and surface temperatures in the northern hemisphere. The most famous example is the Maun-
der Minimum in sunspot numbers, which occurred during the second half of the seventeenth
century, and coincided with a period, known as the Little Ice Age, during which temperatures
in the Northern Hemisphere (Europe in particular) were exceptionally low.
Direct surface temperature measurements are available only from the late nineteenth cen-
tury. However, various proxies are used to estimate surface temperature variations, all with a
significant degree of uncertainty, given that temperature variations are not the sole driving fac-
tor. Among the various methods, one uses tree rings. Another method is to look at isotopic
concentrations in ice cores, obtained form Greenland and Antarctica. Another method uses

(latitudes between ○and ○) from Jones and Moberg (2003). The reconstructed ones are land
temperatures for the northern hemisphere obtained by Jones et al. (1998). The temperatures are
displayed as “anomaly”, i.e., as the variation with respect to the average temperatures recorded
during the 1961–90 period. The data were obtained from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)
of the Working Group 1 on paleoclimate, for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). The timings of large-scale volcanic eruptions (Tamboora, Coseguina and Krakatoa),
known to cause short-term global decreases in temperature, are also shown in >Fig. 3-81.
As is the case of TSI reconstructions, a number of temperature reconstructions exist, all
differing quite significantly. However, some correlation between solar activity and surface tem-
peratures appears to exist. However the recent global warming, the sharp rise in the Earth’s
surface temperatureover the past 50 years, cannot be explained by the Sun’s influence. The solar
irradiance, although varying with the solar cycle over the past 50 years, has increased but not
dramatically. The vast majority of scientists are convinced that global warming is man-made
and is due to the increase in the amount of “greenhouse gases” in the Earth’s atmosphere.
One major problem in accepting a link between total solar irradiance and surface tempera-
tures has been the fact that global temperatures show little correlation, and that the forcing due
to the small irradiance variations is too small to have a direct effect. However, there is ample
evidence for solar forcing on global circulation patterns and pressures (e.g., the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) which has a strong influence on the climate of Northern Europe), and there
is growing consensus that even a small variation of the solar energy output could produce sig-
nificant effects on some local climate patterns. For a review of some of these issues, see, e.g.,
Haigh (2007).
One interesting question is whether the Sun’s variability on long timescales is peculiar or
not. This issue is not yet resolved. Baliunas and Jastrow (1990) used the Mount Wilson Ca ii
H&K survey on what was believed to be a good sample of solar analogs, to find that a significant
number of K,G stars had activity levels significantly below that of the Sun at solar minimum.
Some of the findings have been subsequently questioned; however, it is quite evident that cycle
variations are present in many stars. One puzzling issue is that a large number of stars have
not shown cyclic variations so far. Stars that have cyclic variations are generally more active.
One problem with the use of Ca ii H&K observations is that the excess flux in the cores of
these absorption lines only varies by small (10% or so) amounts during the solar cycle, and it
decreases with stellar age, hence it is not a very sensitive proxy. Much better proxies would be
fluxes in the EUV and X-rays, however most observations (e.g., ROSAT) have been carried out
in broadbands, which, even in the X-rays, can be contaminated by emission formed in very
different atmospheric layers.
A significant amount of data are now available since 1999 from the XMM-Newton and
Chandra X-ray missions, and a more complete picture of stellar variability in the X-rays
will become available. Missions such as Kepler, Corot, GAIA are going to give a substantial
contribution with more accurate measurements of stellar characteristics (e.g., age, size, mass,
rotation), so more detailed comparative studies with the Sun as a star will be possible.
It is also possible to look back in time and see if the past few centuries were typical or not.
This is done by using cosmogenic isotopes as proxy indicators of past variations in solar irradi-
ance on long timescales. These isotopes are spallation products of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs)
impacting Earth’s atmosphere, and then absorbed and deposited into e.g., ice sheets, tree rings
etc. The number of GCRs is strongly reduced during periods of solar activity, given that the
heliospheric magnetic fields act as a shield. Therefore, GCRs are actually a proxy of heliospheric
magnetic fields and not directly of the photospheric ones which modulate the solar irradiance.

The Sun as a Star 3

The cosmogenic isotopes Be (polar ices) and C are mostly used. Their variations follows to
some degree the long-term variations in solaractivity(e.g., Sunspot numbers), and the Maunder
minimum is clearly visible. The records show that Maunder-like minima have occurred quite
frequently. See, e.g., Beer et al. (2006) for a recent review based on Be measurements.The Be
records also show that the Sun has been unusually active in the last 50 years or so, although this
is not uncommon within the last 10,000 years (see, e.g., Abreu et al. 2008). The increased solar
activity in the last 50 years has led to suggestions that global warming could also be related to
the Sun’s activity. However, anthropogenic forcing remains the dominant effect.
11.3 Irradiance in the UV
Variations with the solar cycle occur at all wavelengths and are up to 20%, depending on which
UV wavelength is considered. The neutral hydrogen Ly-α is by far the strongest transition
in the UV. It is mainly absorbed in the upper mesosphere. The neutral hydrogen Ly-α varies
significantly (see Woods et al. 2000), as >Fig. 3-82 shows.
UV light controls the amount of stratospheric ozone through a series of reactions. The most
important one is the photodissociation of O, which occurs at wavelengths less than 2420 Å
in the stratosphere (cf. >Fig. 3-83). The oxygen atoms then react with oxygen molecules to
produce ozone molecules. Various other processes are at work, at different heights in the atmo-
sphere, the net effect being a peak in ozone around 25 km in equatorial regions. Stratospheric
ozone abundance increases during periods of higher solar activity, although other effects such
as global circulation and energetic particles change its abundance. Energetic particles from cos-
mic rays or from solar events such as flares or CME tend to reduce on short timescales the ozone
abundance. The ozone concentration, among other parameters, is predicted to have important

The Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) and the Solar Ultravi-
olet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) on UARS have been providing UV measurements
of the UV spectral irradiance since 1991. Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) also monitored
the UV irradiance form 1981 until 1989. The Solar Euv Experiment (SEE) aboard the Ther-
mosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Dynamics, and Energetic (TIMED) satellite, have made
measurements since 2002.
Broad-band measurements have also been done, recently by Lyra aboard Proba2, which
measures the UV irradiance in 4 UV passbands. Variations on all timescales have been
observed, from short ones due to flares to those lasting a few days and related to the merid-
ian passage of solar features. Plage areas are much brighter than sunspots in the UV, compared
to the difference in the visible, which explains why larger variations are observed. How such
variations produce some effect – however small – on Earth’s climate is still unclear. The same
applies to the EUV radiation.
11.3.1 Irradiance in the EUV and X-rays
Some effects of the EUV radiation on Earth’s atmosphere – particularly on the Thermosphere –
are well known. The solar EUV radiation is the dominant factor in the formation of our
ionosphere via photoionization and molecular photo-dissociation. EUV photons with wave-
lengths shorter than the neutral hydrogen Ly-α are absorbed in the Thermosphere and are

those which ionize neutral oxygen and N, as well as Oand other molecules. Variations in the
EUV irradiance directly affect the density of the ionosphere and have a significant impact on
satellite drag.
Only a few measurements are available, from occasional sounding rockets, which give only
a snapshot of the solar irradiance, or cover less than one solar cycle or partial spectral ranges.
Continuous measurements have only been carried out since 2002 with the NASA TIMED SEE
experiment, that has provided EUV spectra with a coarse spectral resolution.
SoHO has been observing the Sun since 1996. Apart from the broadband measurements of
EIT (see >Fig. 3-84) and the CELIAS/Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor (SEM), the Coronal
Diagnostics Spectrometer (CDS) has been routinely observing the full solar disc in the ranges
31–38 and 51.5–63 nm with its Normal Incidence Spectrograph (NIS). The CDS instrument has
been radiometrically calibrated using sounding rockets and by studying the long-term trends
in the quiet Sun radiances. The calibrated radiances have been converted to irradiances (Del
Zanna and Andretta 2010). Lines formed in the low transition region show relatively modest
changes (by 50% at most). Lines forming around 1 MK change during the cycle by a factor ∼;
for hotter lines (2.5 MK) the variability reaches factors of the order of 40 (see >Fig. 3-85). The
presence of active regions during the solar cycle has a strong influence even in regions of the
more “quiet corona” which change considerably with the cycle, in particular for lines formed
above 1 MK.

The extreme ultraviolet variability experiment (EVE) on board the NASA Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), the first mission of the NASA Living With a Star (LWS) programme, is
measuring the solar EUV irradiance from 1 to 1050 Å with medium spectral resolution (1 Å)
and high temporal cadence (10 s).
Many observations in the XUV have been done with photometers or broadband instru-
ments; hence no calibrated irradiance measurements are available, in contrast with the stellar
case where spectroscopic observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton are available since
1999. The solar observations include X-ray Sensors (XRS) aboard the NOAA GOES spacecrafts,
the SoHO solar EUV monitor (SEM), the solar XUV photometers (SXP) on the Student Nitric
Oxide Explorer (SNOE). X-ray broad-band images from Yohkoh SXT obtained in the 1990s
(see >Fig. 3-86) showed variability by two orders of magnitude.

Future Prospects
The future couple of decades offer an exciting prospect for solar physics. Various new satel-
lites are being proposed and built. A follow-up of the successful Solar-A (Yohkoh) and Solar-B
(Hinode) is being proposed. New missions to probe the inner heliosphere are being designed:
the Russian InterHelios and the ESA-NASA Solar Orbiter satellites will go close to the Sun and
above the ecliptic. The NASA solar Probe+ will go even closer to the Sun.
Besides the new observatories, many smaller rockets and SMEX (small explorer missions)
are planned. The level of detail we shall be able to measure and see in the solar atmosphere
continues to increase dramatically. The challenge is for the theory and models to keep up with
these observations. Increases in the size and capacity of computers helps in this regard, but the
modeling codes (MHD, kinetic, hydrodynamic etc.) require faster and larger processors. To
date many codes have been developed independently, but the theoretical challenge is to bring
all these codes (MHD + kinetic theory + hydrodynamic processes) together. This is likely to
need the modeling of nonequilibrium processes (non-Maxwellian velocity distributions, two
fluid models, time-dependent ionization and recombination, radiative transfer in the lower
atmosphere).
The great challenge as always in solar physics is to keep pace with the complexity of the
observations, to develop new theoretical techniques to accurately model the phenomena which

200 3

the Sun exhibits. The Sun, our nearest star, does not make this challenge easy. However, unless
we can understand the physics of the Sun we have little chance of understanding the complex
processes in other stellar atmospheres. Observations of other stars do however also provide a
spectrum of stellar conditions in which we can place the Sun. In this regard, studies of the Sun
and other stars go hand-in-hand.
12.1 Solar Orbiter
Solar Orbiter is one of ESA’s candidates for a medium-class mission part of the Cosmic Vision
programme to be launched no earlier than 2017. The orbit of the Solar Orbiter is unique in
that is highly elliptical with perihelion as low as 0.23 AU and with increasing inclination up
to more than 30○with respect to the solar equator over the years, obtained with Venus flybys.
This is technically very challenging, in particular with the temperature extremes which will be
experienced.
The main goal of Solar Orbiter is to address the following questions:
•
What are the origins of the solar wind streams and the heliospheric magnetic field?
•
What are the sources, acceleration mechanisms, and transport processes of solar energetic
particles?
•
How do coronal mass ejections evolve in the inner heliosphere?
•
Explore, at all latitudes, the energetics, dynamics, and fine-scale structure of the Sun’s
magnetized atmosphere.
This will be achieved with a suite of instruments, built in collaboration with NASA. The primary
ones will be the in situ ones, which will measure the solar wind close to the Sun, a fundamental
requirement. The main advantages over previous missions are: close-up view point; out-of-
ecliptic view point; near corotating orbital phases; multi-point in situ observations by Solar
Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus. The close-up view point will provide unprecedented spatial reso-
lution, although it should be noted that the same could be achieved by Earth-orbiting satellites.
The key advantage is the near corotating orbital phases, i.e., it should be possible to relate the
in situ measurements with the sources, as observed with remote sensing (EUV imaging and
spectroscopy). A coronagraph will provide unprecedented details about the inner corona.
12.2 Solar Probe+
The Solar Probe+, now scheduled for launch in 2015, is a modification of a previous NASA
mission. It is designed to approach the Sun as close as 8.5 radii from its surface with a number
of flybys over a period extending over both solar minimum and solar maximum. The mission
will be highly complementary to Solar Orbiter and will make measurements of the solar wind
plasma within its birthplace. Its baseline payload is an integrated package of in situ instruments
and a white-light Hemispheric Imager (HI) for imaging coronal structures. Its scientific goals
are similar to the Solar Orbiter ones:
•
To determine the structure and dynamics of the magnetic fields at the sources of the solar
wind.
•
To trace the flow of energy that heats the corona and accelerates the solar wind.

The Sun as a Star 3
201
•
To determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles.
•
To explore dusty plasma near the sun and its influence on solar wind and energetic particle
formation.
A quote from E.N.Parker, the father of the solar wind:
▸
“It is ironic that voyaging spacecraft haveroughed out the general picture of the solar wind region-
the heliosphere-with its spiral magnetic ﬁeld and the fast and slow stream interaction regions all the
way out to the termination shock at 100 AU, while the heat sources that create the wind are still poorly
understood.Weexpectthatthecoronalheatingisacomplexphenomenon,diﬀerentoverthequietand
active regions of the Sun. The ideal space mission to explore this problem would involve detailed in-situ
investigation of plasma temperature, composition, and bulk motion; fast particle populations; mag-
netic ﬁeld; and wave motions from the base of the corona out to 1 AU at many locations around the
Sun at times of both high and low activity. Such a space mission is impossible, of course, because the
Sun, being a star, is not readily approachable, but we would like to approach it as closely as money and
technology permit. ”

Asteroseismology
Abstract:
Asteroseismology is the determination of the interior structures of stars by using
their oscillations as seismic waves. Simple explanations of the astrophysical background and
some basic theoretical considerations needed in this rapidly evolving field are followed by intro-
ductions to the most important concepts and methods on the basis of example. Previous and
potential applications of asteroseismology are reviewed and future trends are attempted to be
foreseen.

Introduction: Variable and Pulsating Stars
Nearly all the physical processes that determine the structure and evolution of stars occur in
their (deep) interiors. The production of nuclear energy that powers stars takes place in their
cores for most of their lifetime. The effects of the physical processes that modify the simplest
models of stellar evolution, such as mixing and diffusion, also predominantly take place in the
inside of stars.
The light that we receive from the stars is the main information that astronomers can use to
study the universe. However, the light of the stars is radiated away from their surfaces, carrying
no memory of its origin in the deep interior. Therefore, it would seem that there is no way that
the analysis of starlight tells us about the physics going on in the unobservable stellar interiors.
However, there are stars that reveal more about themselves than others. Variable stars are
objects for which one can observe time-dependent light output, on a time scale shorter than
that of evolutionary changes. There are two major groups of variable star, extrinsic and intrinsic
variables.
Extrinsic variables do not change their light output by themselves. For example, the light
changes of eclipsing binary stars are caused by two stars passing in front of each other, so that
light coming from one of them is periodically blocked. The individual components of eclipsing
binary stars are not necessarily variable. By analyzing the temporal light variations and orbital
motion of eclipsing binaries, one can determine their fundamental properties, and by assum-
ing that their components are otherwise normal stars, determine fundamental properties of all
stars, most importantly their masses. In this way, stars and stellar systems can be understood
better.
Intrinsic variables, on the other hand, change their light output physically. Supernovae,
which are stellar implosions/explosions, can become brighter than their host galaxies because
of the ejection of large amounts of material. Even more revealing are stars that vary their sizes
and/or shapes: pulsating variables.
The first pulsating star was discovered more than 400 years ago. In 1596, David Fabricius
remarked that the star o Ceti (subsequently named “Mira”, the wonderful) disappeared from the
visible sky. About 40 years later, it was realized that it did so every ∼11 months; the first periodic

Asteroseismology 4

variable star was known (although we know today that in this case, the term “periodic” is not
correct in a strict sense).
In 1784, John Goodricke discovered the variability of δ Cephei, and in 1914 enough evi-
dence had been collected that Harlow Shapley was able to demonstrate that the variations of
δ Cephei and related stars (also simply called “Cepheids”) were due to radial pulsation. Also in
the teens of the previous century, Henrietta Leavitt pointed out that the Cepheids in the Small
Magellanic Clouds follow a period-luminosity relation, still one of the fundamental methods to
determine distances in the visible universe – and one of the major astrophysical applications of
pulsating stars.
With the ever increasing precision in photometric and radial velocity measurements,a large
number of groups of pulsating stars are nowadays known. >Figure 4-1 shows theoretical (in the

years ago and today. >Table 4-1 gives a rough overview of the classes of pulsator contained
in >Fig. 4-1.
The different types of pulsator have historically been classified on a phenomenological basis.
The separation between those types has usually later turned out to have a physical reason.
The individual classes are different in terms of types of excited pulsation mode (or, less physical,
pulsation period), mass and evolutionary state, hence temperature and luminosity. The names
of these classes are assigned either after the name of a prototypical star or give some description
of the type of variability and star.
It must be pointed out that the present overview does by far not contain all types and
subgroups of pulsating star that have been suggested. The Cepheids are subdivided accord-
ing to population and evolutionary state, into δ Cephei, W Vir, RV Tau, and BL Her stars.
Jeffery (2008) proposed a number of types of evolved variable, there are the Luminous Blue
Variables, and there may be new classes of white dwarf pulsator, oscillating red and brown
dwarfs, etc. Furthermore, some of the instability domains of different pulsators overlap and
indeed, some objects called “hybrid” pulsators that show oscillations of two distinct types, have
been discovered. Also, the instability boundaries of some of these variables may need to be
(considerably) extended and/or revised in the near future. For instance, there may be super-
giant SPB stars, and solar-like oscillations are expected in all stars having a significant surface
convection zone.
Whereas the classification of and distinction between the different classes of pulsating stars,
which are historically grown and modified designations, can in some cases be called arbitrary
today, one recognizes an important fact: pulsating stars populate almost the entire HR diagram,
and this means that they can be used to learn something about the physics of most stars.

Astrophysical Background
2.1 Driving Mechanisms
What can make a star oscillate? After all, stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium: the gravitational
pull on the mass elements of normal stars is balanced by gas pressure. If something would
hit a star, the inward moving regions will be heated, and the increased heat loss damps the
motion. Consequently, self-excited pulsations require a driving mechanism that overcomes this
damping and results in a periodic oscillation.
Four major driving mechanisms have been proposed. The є mechanism (Rosseland and
Randers1938)assumes a variation in the stellarnuclearreaction rate: ifa nuclearburning region
is compressed, the temperature rises and more energy is produced. This causes expansion, the
pressure drops, and so does the energy generation: the motion is reversed and oscillations
develop. The є mechanism (where є is the usual designator for the nuclear reaction rate in
formulae), that operates similar to a Diesel engine, has been proposed for several different
types of pulsating star, such as our Sun and pulsating white dwarfs, but observational proof
for oscillations driven by it is still lacking.
Considerably more successful in explaining stellar oscillations is the κ–γ mechanism
(Baker and Kippenhahn 1962 and references therein). In layers where the opacity κ increases
and/or the third adiabatic exponent Γdecreases with increasing temperature, flux coming from
inner layers can be temporally stored. Such layers in the stellar interior are generally associated
with regions where (partial) ionization of certain chemical elements occurs.
The energy accumulated in this layer during compression is additionally released when the
layer tries to reach its equilibrium state by expanding. Therefore, the star can expand beyond its
equilibrium radius. When the material recedes, energy is again stored in the stellar interior, and
the whole cycle repeats: a periodic stellar oscillation evolves. This mechanism is also called the
Eddington Valve, and it explains the variability of most of the known classes of pulsating star.
The classical pulsators in the instabilitystrip, ranging from the δ Cephei stars tothe RR Lyrae
stars and the δ Scuti stars draw their pulsation power from the Heii ionization zone, whereas
the oscillations of the roAp stars are believed to be excited in the Hi and Hei ionization zones,
those of the Mira variables in the Hi ionization zone, and those of the β Cephei and SPB stars
are triggered in the ionization zone of the iron-group elements.
A very similar mechanism, in the sense that it is also due to a region in the star behaving like
a valve, is convective blocking (or convective driving). In this scheme (e.g., Brickhill 1991), the
base of a convection zone blocks the flux from the interior for some time, releasing the energy
stored during compression in the subsequent expansion phase. The pulsations of white dwarf
stars of spectral types DA and DB as well as γ Doradus stars are thought to be excited (at least
partly) via this mechanism, which may also be of importance in Cepheids and Mira stars.
Finally, the pulsations of the Sun and solar-like stars, that are intrinsically stable and
therefore not called self-excited, are stochastically excited due to turbulence in their surface
convection zones. The vigorous convective motion in the outer surface layers generates acous-
tic noise in a broad frequency range, which excites solar-like oscillation modes. Due to the
large number of convective elements on the surface, the excitation is of random nature, and the
amplitudes of the oscillations are temporally highly variable.
Given the physical nature of these driving mechanisms, the existence of the different insta-
bility domains in the HR diagram (cf. > Fig. 4-1) easily follows. A star must fulfill certain
physical conditions that it can pulsate, as the driving mechanism must be located in a specific

212 4
Asteroseismology
part of the star to give rise to observable oscillations. More physically speaking, in the case of
self-excited pulsations the driving region must be located in a region where the thermal, and/or
convective, time scale closely corresponds the dynamical (pulsational) time scale.
The consequence of the previous requirement is a constraint on the interior structure of
a pulsating variable: if the instability region of some class of pulsating variable is accurately
known, models of stars incorporating its excitation mechanism must be able to reproduce it. In
this way, details of the input physics describing the interior structures of stars can be modified
to reflect the observations.
However, this is not the only method available to study stellar structure and evolution from
stellar pulsation. Models also need to explain the oscillation properties of individual stars. We
are fortunate to be in the presence of stars having very complex pulsation patterns, multiperi-
odicradial and nonradial oscillators. The research field that determines the internal constitution
of stars from their pulsations is called asteroseismology.
It is now due to make clear that the star whose interior structure is best known is the star
closest to us, the Sun. Its surface can be resolved in two dimensions and millions of pulsation
modes can be used for seismic analyses. The related research field is helioseismology, and it has
been extensively reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Christensen-Dalsgaard 2002; Gizon et al. 2010). The
present chapter will not touch upon helioseismology.
2.2 Asteroseismology
The basic idea of asteroseismology (see Gough 1996 for a discussion of why “astero”) is anal-
ogous to the determination of the Earth’s inner structure using earthquakes: these generate
seismic waves that travel through rock and other interior structures of our planet, which can
then be sounded. Today, the Earth’s interior has been completely mapped down to scales of a
few hundred kilometers.
The strongest earthquakes can even cause normal mode oscillations(e.g., see Montagner and
Roult 2008), that is, the whole planet vibrates with its natural frequencies (also called eigenfre-
quencies in theoretical analyses). These normal modes are most valuable in determining the
deep interior structure of the Earth. Asteroseismology does just the same: it uses the frequen-
cies of the normal modes of pulsating stars (that may be seen as “starquakes”) as seismic waves.
The eigenfrequencies of stellar models, that are dependent on their physical parameters and
interior structures, are then matched to the observed ones. If a model succeeds in reproducing
them, it is called a seismic model.
The pulsation modes are waves in the stellar interior, just like the waves that musical instru-
ments resonate in. Popular articles often compare the frequency pattern of stellar oscillations
to the sounds of musical instruments. The superposition of the normal mode frequencies in
which a star oscillates can therefore be seen as its sound, although it generally does not involve
frequencies the human ear is susceptible to.
There is a large variety of normal modes that stars can pulsate in. The simplest are radial
modes: the star periodically expands and shrinks, and its spherical symmetry is preserved.
The mathematical description of the displacement due to the oscillations results in differen-
tial equations of the Sturm–Liouville type that yields discrete eigensolutions: the radial mode
frequencies of the given model.

Asteroseismology 4
213
Pulsation in nonradial modes causes deviations from spherical symmetry: the star changes
its shape. Mathematically, this no longer results in an eigenvalue problem of the Sturm–
Liouville type, and a large number of possible oscillation modes originate. The eigenfunctions
are proportional to spherical harmonics:

l is a normalization constant and l and m are the spherical degree and
azimuthal order of the oscillation. With

we obtain

(cosθ −)
P
(cos θ) = −cos θ sin θ
P
(cos θ) = sinθ
etc. etc.
(4.5)
What does this mean in practice? Nonradial pulsation modes generate distortions on the
stellar surface described by these spherical harmonics. The oscillations separate the stellar sur-
face into expanding and receding as well as heating or cooling areas. A graphical example of
these is shown in >Fig. 4-2.
Between the expanding and receding surface areas, no motion takes place. The lines along
which this is the case are called the node lines; the nulls of the previously specified associated
Legendre polynomials specify the locations of these node lines in polar direction. The total
number of node lines on the stellar surface is the spherical degree l, which must in all cases
be larger than or equal to zero. The number of node lines that are intersected when traveling
around the stellar equator is the azimuthal order m. l and m are the quantities that appear in
the expressions for the eigenfunctions and for the associated Legendre polynomial given above,
and they are used for the classification of the pulsation modes.
Pulsation modes with m /= are traveling waves (as can also be seen in the defining
>Equation 4.1 for spherical harmonics), and as they can run either with or against the rotation
of the star, m can lie in the interval [−l, l]. Modes with m = are called axisymmetric, modes
with ∣m∣= l are named sectoral, and all other modes are referred to as tesseral modes.
The third quantity needed to describe pulsation modes is the radial overtone k (sometimes
also denoted n in the literature), which is the number of nodes in the stellar interior. A mode
that has no node in the interior is called a fundamental mode. A mode with one interior node is
called the first overtone, modes with two interior nodes are the second overtone, etc. An accurate
account ofmode classification from the theoretical point ofview is given byDeubnerand Gough
(1984).
Historically, observationally, and inconsistently with the theoretical definition, radial over-
tone modes have also been called the first and second harmonics, respectively, and have been

abbreviated with F for the fundamental, as well as 1H (or 1O), 2H (or 2O), etc. for the over-
tones. Radial pulsations can be seen as modes with ℓ= (remember that P
(cos θ) = ); all
other modes are nonradial oscillations. Modes with l = are also called dipole modes; l = 
modes are quadrupole modes.
There are two major restoring forces for stellar oscillations that attempt to bring the star
back in its equilibrium configuration: pressure and buoyancy (gravity). For radial motion, the
gravitational force in a star increases during compression, so it would actually accelerate, and
not restore, the oscillation. Therefore, pressure must be the restoring force. On the other hand,
for a predominantly transverse motion, gravity restores the motion through buoyancy, similar
to what can be observed when throwing a stone into a pond. Therefore, aside from their identi-
fication with the pulsational quantum numbers k, l, and m, nonradial pulsation modes are also
classified into p pressure (p) modes and gravity (g) modes. These two sets of modes thus differ by
the main direction of their motion (radial/transverse), and their frequencies. Pulsation modes
with periods longer than that of the radial fundamental mode are usually g modes, whereas
p modes have periods equal or shorter than that; radial pulsations are always p modes.
The different modes are often labeled with their radial overtone number, for example, a p
mode is a pressure mode with three radial nodes, and a gmode is a gravity mode with eight
radial nodes. Modes with no interior nodes are fundamental modes, or f modes. Note that the

Asteroseismology 4
215
f mode for l = does not exist, as a dipole motion of the entire star would require a movement
of the stellar center of mass, which is physically impossible.
The propagation of pulsation modes in the stellar interior is governed by two frequencies.
One of these is the Lamb frequency Ll, which is the inverse of the time needed to travel one
horizontal wavelength at local sound speed. The other frequency describes at what rate a bubble
of gas oscillates vertically around its equilibrium position at any given position inside a star; it
is called the Brunt-Vaisälä frequency N. These two quantities are defined as:

l = l(l + )c
r
N = g (

pγ
dp
dr −

dr ),
(4.6)
where l is the spherical degree, c is the local velocity of sound, r is the radius, g is the local
gravitational acceleration, pand ρare local pressure and density in the unperturbed state,
respectively, and γ= (ρdp/pdρ)ad is the first adiabatic exponent.
The Lamb and Brunt-Vaisälä frequencies have the following implications: an oscillation with
a frequency higher than both experiences pressure as the main restoring force in the corre-
sponding part of the star. On the other hand, a vibration with a frequency lower than both Ll
and N is restored mostly by buoyancy. In other words, if we have a stellar oscillation with an
angular frequency ω, it is a p mode wherever ω > Ll, N, and it is a g mode wherever ω < Ll, N.
In stellar interior regions where ω lies between the Lamb and Brunt-Vaisälä frequencies, the
amplitude of the wave decreases exponentially with distance from the p and g mode propa-
gation regions; such parts in the stellar interior are called evanescent regions. A propagation
diagram aids the visualization of this discussion (>Fig. 4-3).

quency is a p8 mode. The oscillation with intermediate frequency is a mixed mode (Data kindly

Asteroseismology
Whereas the Lamb frequency decreases monotonically toward the model’s surface, the
Brunt-Vaisälä frequency shows a sharp peak near the model’s center and then rapidly drops to
zero. This is because this model possesses a convective core, where N < , and the spike in N
is due to a region of chemical inhomogeneity. Over a range of stellar models, the behavior of Ll
in the interior is usually simple, whereas N may show considerable changes with evolutionary
state and mass. However, N is always zero in the stellar center.
In >Fig. 4-3, the g mode is confined to the innermost parts of the star. It is trapped in the
interior, and therefore unlikely to be observed on the surface. The p mode is concentrated near
the stellar surface and may be observable. The intermediate frequency mode shows remarkable
behavior: it has three nodes in the outer regions of the star, but also one node in the g mode
propagation region. This particular mode is capable of tunneling through its narrow evanescent
region; it is a g mode in the deep interior, but a p mode closer to the surface. Such modes are
called mixed modes.
As mentioned before, stellar pulsation modes can be excited in certain parts of the stellar
interior and they can propagate in some regions, whereas in other regions they are damped.
The work integral is the energy gained by the pulsation mode averaged over one oscillation
period. An evaluation of the work integral from the stellar center to the surface is used to
determine whether or not a given mode is globally excited in a stellar model. For excitation
to occur, the exciting forces must overcome those of damping and the work integral W will be
positive.
The growth rate γ = W/πωI, where ω is the pulsation frequency and I is the mode inertia,
parameterizes the increase of oscillation energy during a pulsation cycle, and also indicates
how rapidly the amplitude of a given mode increases. The normalized growth rate (or stability
parameter) η, which is the ratio of the radius-integrated work available for excitation to the
radius-integrated total work, is used to evaluate which pulsation modes are excited in the given
model. If η > , a mode is driven and may reach observable amplitude; if η = , a mode is
driven in the entire stellar model, and if η = −, a mode is damped everywhere in the model.
The most widely used application of this stability parameter is the comparison of the excited
modal frequency ranges as determined from observations and those predicted by theory.
>Figure 4-4 shows how the frequency domains predicted to be excited change with the
evolution of a 1.8 M⊙main sequence model. On the Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS), only
pure p modes of high radial overtone, and corresponding high frequencies, are excited in the
model. Later on, some of these become stable again, but modes with lower overtone become
excited. At the end of main sequence evolution, a large range of p modes, mixed modes, and
g modes is predicted to be excited, and the frequency spectrum becomes dense (and even denser
as the model leaves the main sequence). The range of excited frequencies is an observable that,
when compared with models, can give an estimate of the evolutionary state of the star.
The reason for the evolutionary change in the pulsation frequencies is that as the model
evolves, its convective core, in which the g modes are trapped at the ZAMS, shrinks and the
g mode frequencies increase. At the same time the envelope expands due to the increased
energy generation in the contracting nuclear burning core, causing a decrease of the p mode
frequencies.
At some point, some p and g modes attain the same frequencies, and the modes begin to
interact: they become mixed modes, with g mode character in the core and p mode character
in the envelope (see also >Fig. 4-3). The frequencies of these modes never reach exactly the
same value; the modes just exchange physical properties. This effect is called avoided crossing
or mode bumping (Aizenman et al. 1977).

circles, stable modes with open circles. The types of mode on the Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS)
are given. Note the g modes intruding into the p mode domain
Of the individual modes, particular astrophysical potential is carried by the mode that orig-
inates as gon the ZAMS, as pointed out by Dziembowski and Pamyatnykh (1991). This mode
is mostly trapped in the shrinking convective core (for stars sufficiently massive to possess a
convective core), because the rapid change in mean molecular weight at its edge causes a spike
in the Brunt-Vaisälä frequency (cf. >Fig. 4-3). The frequency of this mode is thus dependent
on the size of the convective core.
The most important parameter determining the evolution of main sequence stars is the
amount of nuclear fuel available. Stellar core convection can mix material from the radiative
layer on top of the core intoit, providing more nuclear fuel. This mixing (or penetration) is often
named convective core overshooting and parameterized in theoretical models.Overshooting also
decreases the gradient in the mean molecular weight at the edge of the core, which means that
the frequency of the mode that is gon the ZAMS measures the convective core size, a most
important quantityforastrophysics in general. Toemphasize its sensitivitytothe extent ofstellar
core convection, this mode has also been named gc mode.
In the following, only p and g modes, and mixed modes of these types will be considered.
Other types of modes, such as r modes (torsional oscillations that may occur in rotating stars),
g−modes (convectively excited g modes in rotating stars), strange modes (showing up in cal-
culations of highly nonadiabatic environments) or gravitational-wave w modes, will not be
discussed as they have been of little practical importance for the seismic sounding of stars at
the time of this writing.
The frequencies of the p and g modes of pulsating stars depend strongly on their structure.
However, when high radial overtones are considered, some simple relations between mode

218 4
Asteroseismology
frequencies emerge. These are derived from asymptotic theory. The classical reference on the
subject is Tassoul (1980), the instructive is Gough (1986). In the high-overtone limit one finds
ωn,l ≃Δω(n + l
+ є) −Dl(l + )
(4.7)
for p modes, whereas for g modes
Pn,l ≃P(n + δ)
√
l(l + )
,
(4.8)
where Δωis the inverse sound travel time through the center of the star, Dis a frequency
separation dependent on the stellar evolutionary state, Pis the asymptotic period that is pro-
portional to the integral of the Brunt-Vaisälä frequency throughout the star, l and n are the
spherical degree and radial overtone, respectively, and є and δ are stellar structure parameters,
respectively.
These relations have important consequences: low-degree p modes of consecutive high
radial overtones of the same spherical degree are equally spaced in frequency, whereas low-
degree g modes of consecutive high radial overtones of the same spherical degree are equally
spaced in period. Furthermore, if the parameter Dwere zero, ( > 4.7) indicates that the fre-
quencies of high-overtone p modes of even and odd degrees would be the same, respectively,
and odd-degree modes would have frequencies intermediate between those of even degree.
In realistic stellar models, these relations hold approximately, but not exactly.
In a nonrotating star, the frequencies of modes with m ≠are the same as those of the
m = modes. However, as the m ≠modes are traveling waves, their frequencies sepa-
rate in the observer’s frame when looking at a rotating star: the mode moving with rotation
appears at higher frequency, the mode moving against rotation appears at lower frequency
and the frequency difference to their nonrotating value is m times the rotation frequency
(e.g., see Cox 1984). This effect is called rotational frequency splitting, and is one basic tool
of asteroseismology: if such splittings are observed, the rotation frequency of the star can be
determined.
Unfortunately, reality is not quite as simple as that. The Coriolis force acts on the traveling
waves and modifies their frequencies. In addition, the m ≠modes cause tidal bulges, on which
centrifugal forces act. Therefore, the frequencies of these modes are often expressed as
ωk,l,m = ωk,l,+ m(−Ck,l)Ω + mDk,lΩ
ω
(4.9)
in case of (moderately) slow stellar rotation (Dziembowski and Goode 1992). ωk,l,m is the
observed frequency of the mode k, l, m, Ω is the stellar rotation frequency, and Ck,l and Dk,l are
constants that describe the effects of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, respectively; they are
also called Ledoux constants. These constants are usually determined from stellar model calcu-
lations. The rotational splitting constant Ck,l also approaches asymptotic values for high radial
overtones. For g modes, Ck,l becomes (l(l + ))−, and for p modes Ck,l = in the asymptotic
limit.
It should be made clear that the previous formula is only an approximation for the case that
rotation can be treated as a perturbation to the equilibrium state: stellar rotation distorts the
spherical shape of a star. As a consequence, the individual modes can no longer be described
with single spherical harmonics. For instance, radial modes receive contamination of l = and
other modes with even l. Vice versa, l = modes obtain some l = , l = , etc. contributions.

In the previous formula, this means that for rapid rotation higher order terms may be added, but
to arrive at reliable results, two-dimensional numerical calculations are really required. Rota-
tional mode coupling can affect the properties of oscillation modes with close frequencies (e.g.,
see Daszy´nska-Daszkiewicz et al. 2002). Furthermore, the rotational distortion causes the stellar
temperature to increase at the flattened poles and to decrease at the equatorial bulge. It follows
that asteroseismology of rapidly rotating stars has additional degrees of complexity.
Even more complexity to the theoretical treatment of stellar pulsation is added by the
presence of a magnetic field. A weak magnetic field would generate a second-order pertur-
bation to the pulsation frequencies, just like the centrifugal force in case of rotation, but with
opposite sign, that is, the observed oscillation frequencies would increase with respect to the
non-magnetic case (e.g., Jones et al. 1989).
In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the effect would be more severe: if the field was
oblique to the rotation axis (just like the Earth’s magnetic field!), the pulsation axis would align
with the magnetic axis, and no longer with the rotation axis, as implicitly assumed so far. This
means that an observer would see each pulsation mode at a varying angle over the stellar rota-
tion period, creating amplitude and phase variations with exactly that period, and therefore
separable from the effects of rotational m-mode splitting. A star oscillating in this way is called
oblique pulsator (Kurtz 1982). We note for completeness that the most general case of rotational
splitting is the nonaligned pulsator (Pesnell 1985), where (l +)components of a given mode
appear, with frequency separations proportional to the rotation period and to the angle between
the rotation and pulsation axes.
To summarize, different stellar pulsation modes propagate in different interior regions, and
their energy within those regions is not equally distributed. Each single pulsation mode has a
different cavity, and its oscillation frequency is determined by the physical conditions in its cav-
ity. This means that different modes are sensitive to the physical conditions in different parts
of the stellar interior. Some modes teach us more about stellar envelopes, whereas other modes
tell us about the deep interior. The more modes of different type are detected in a given star, the
more complete our knowledge about its inner structure can become.
Some stars do us the favor to oscillate in many of these radial and/or nonradial modes simul-
taneously. Interior structure modelsof the stars can then be refined by measuring the oscillation
frequencies of these stars, identifying them with their pulsational quantum numbers, and by
reproducing all these with stellar models. This method is very sensitive because stellar oscilla-
tion frequencies can be measured to extremely high precision, up to one part in 10(Kepler et al.
2005). In the following it will be described what observables are available to base asteroseismic
models on, how the measurements can be interpreted, and how observations and theory are
used to develop methods for asteroseismic interpretations.

From the Telescope to a Seismic Model
3.1 Basic Methods for Analyzing Asteroseismic Data
Because stellar oscillations generate motions and temperature variations on the surface, they
result in observable variability. The interplay of these variations causes light, radial veloc-
ity, and line profile changes. Pulsating stars can thus be studied both photometrically and
spectroscopically, via time series measurements.

220 4
Asteroseismology
These time series are subjected to frequency analysis, meaning that the constituent signals
are extracted from the data. In many cases, this is done by harmonic analysis, transforming
the time series into frequency/amplitude space, for example, by using the Discrete Fourier
Transformation

of the input function x(tk), corresponding to the time series of the measurements. Peri-
odograms, amplitude, or power spectra are means of visualizing the results; an example is given
in >Fig. 4-5.
The amplitude spectrum in >Fig. 4-5 can be used to estimate the frequencies of the domi-
nant signals in the time series. In many cases, the analysis is carried forward by fitting sinusoids
to the data, determining and optimizing their frequencies, amplitudes and phases, often by
least squares methods. It has also become common practice to subtract this optimized fit from
the data and to compute periodograms of the residuals, a procedure called prewhitening. This
process is repeated until no more significant signals can be found in the data (a most delicate
decision!). Depending on the specific case and requirements of the data set, a large number of
alternative frequency analysis methods can also be applied, such as phase-dispersionminimiza-
tion, autocorrelation methods, wavelet analysis, etc. Care must be taken to keep the limitations
of the data sets and of the applied methods in mind. Periods no longer than the data set itself
can be reliably determined, and adjacent frequencies spaced no more than the inverse length of
the data set can be resolved. Nonsinusoidal signals cause harmonics and combination frequen-
cies in Fourier amplitude spectra that must not be mistaken for independent mode frequencies.

No frequencies shorter than the inverse of twice the median distance between consecutive data
points can be unambiguously detected; the highest frequency that can be retrieved in a given
set of measurements is also called its Nyquist frequency.
Having determined the frequencies characterizing the stellarvariability, the next stepis their
interpretation. Measurements of distant stars have an important limitation: nonradial oscil-
lations create patterns of brighter and fainter, approaching and receding areas on the stellar
surface. However, as a distant observer can usually not resolve the stellar surface, she or he can
only measure the joint effect of the pulsations in light and radial velocity. As a consequence, the
effects of oscillations with high spherical degree average out in disk-integrated measurements,
and their observed amplitudes are reduced with respect to the intrinsic value. This effect is
called geometric cancellation (Dziembowski 1977). Calculations show that the amplitude drops
as ≈/
√
l for high l. In ground based observational studies it is mostly assumed (and often
confirmed) that only modes with l ≤are observed in light and radial velocity, with a few
exceptions of l up to 4. Radial velocity measurements are somewhat more sensitive to higher l
than observations in integrated light.
Once the oscillation frequencies of a given star have been determined, how can they be
made asteroseismic use of? As an example, high-precision radial velocity measurements of the
close-by star α Centauri A showed the presence of solar-like oscillations; the power spectrum
(square of amplitude vs. frequency) of these data is shown in >Fig. 4-6.
This graph contains a series of maxima equally spaced in frequency: a high-overtone p mode
spectrum, as predicted by asymptotic theory. The mean frequency spacing is 106.2 μHz. How-
ever, it is obvious that only every other of the strongest peaks conforms to this spacing; there are
other signals in between. The signals halfway between the vertical lines in >Fig. 4-6, denoting
modes of spherical degree l, are a consequence of (> 4.7): these are modes with l ±. Given the
effects of geometrical cancellation, it is straightforward to assume that these are the modes of
lowest l, viz. l = and 1.
However, there is more information present. A close look at >Fig. 4-6 reveals that many of
the strongest peaks seem to be split. Again, the explanation for this finding lies within (> 4.7):
the close neighbors are modes with l + . These frequencies no longer have the same values as
those with degree l because the stellar interior has structure.
As stars evolve on the main sequence, theirnuclearburning cores shrink, increase in density,
and change in chemical composition as evolution progresses. This alters the acoustic sound

speed in the core and is reflected in the frequency differences between modes of degrees l, l +,
also called the small frequency separation δν. On the other hand, evolution causes expansion
of the outer regions of stars that become more tenuous, which increases the sound travel time
through the star. This is measurable via the frequency difference between consecutive radial
overtones and is called the large frequency separation Δν.
The large and the small separations can be computed fora range oftheoretical stellarmodels.
It turns out that a plot of δνvs. Δνallows an unambiguous determination of stellar mass and
evolutionary state, and this method works particularly well for models with parameters similar
to our Sun (main sequence, M <∼.M⊙). This diagnostic is called an asteroseismic HR diagram
(Christensen-Dalsgaard 1988).
Another important tool to analyze high-overtone p mode pulsation spectra is the Echelle
diagram. This diagram plots the oscillation frequencies versus their modulus with respect to
the large separation. >Figure 4-7 shows the Echelle diagram for α Cen A constructed from the
frequencies of the signals apparent in >Fig. 4-6.
The frequencies fall onto four distinct ridges, corresponding to modes of the same spherical
degree l. In this way, l can be identified. From left to right, the ridges correspond to l = , , 
and 1, respectively, and it can be seen that, within the errors, δν= /δν, consistent with
( > 4.7). The scatter in this diagram is due to a combination of the temporal resolution of the
data and, more importantly, the finite lifetimes of the stochastically excited modes.
The example of α Cen A shows that once a sufficient number of intrinsic pulsation frequen-
cies of a given star has been determined, one may identify their spherical degrees by pattern
recognition. This method is also applicable to the oscillation spectra of pulsating white dwarf
stars, as exemplified in >Fig. 4-8.
The series of peaks discernible in > Fig. 4-8 does not form a pattern of equally spaced
frequencies, but of equally spaced periods. This is the signature of a high-overtone g mode pul-
sation spectrum (> 4.8). In this case, all the strong peaks are roughly aligned with the vertical
lines; there are no strong modes in between. Some of the expected signals are missing, but in

High-overtone g mode spectrum of the pulsating DB white dwarf star GD 358 (Winget et al. 1994).
The vertical dotted lines denote periods with an equal spacing of 39.5s
most cases only apparently: they are just much weaker in amplitude. A mean period spacing of
39.5 s has been determined from this analysis, and the obvious identification of the strongest
modes is l = . > Equation 4.8 then results in P= .s. For pulsating white dwarf stars, Pis
a measure of the stellar mass, which was consequently determined.
Furthermore, several of the strongest peaks in >Fig. 4-8 are split into triplets. These triplets
are equally spaced in frequency, and they are the signature of rotationally split m modes (>4.9).
The rotation period of GD 358 could therefore also be determined, just from an inspection of
the power spectrum of its photometric time series, and basic application of theory. The fact
that the m-mode splitting only results in triplets strengthens the previous identification of the
spherical degree as l = . The relative amplitudes within those triplets are dependent on the
inclination of the stellar pulsation axis ( > 4.4), which may then be determined, but in reality
there are other, presently unknown, effects that modify the relative multiplet amplitudes.
There is even more information present. It is noticeable that the peaks in the amplitude
spectrum do not perfectly conform to their asymptotically predicted locations. This is a sign
of mode trapping. White dwarf stars consist of a degenerate core, with subsequent outer lay-
ers of different chemical elements. The transition regions between these layers create spikes in
the Brunt-Vaisälä frequency. The pulsation modes prefer to place their radial nodes in these
transition regions, and be standing waves to both sides of the nodes. This modifies their fre-
quencies compared to the case of homogeneous interior structure and gives rise to the observed
deviations from equal period spacing.
The observant reader will have noticed three apparent inconsistencies in the previous para-
graphs. How can two stars with similar oscillation frequencies be high-overtone p and g mode
pulsators, respectively? How does one know that 106.2 μHz is the mean frequency spacing for
α Cen A, and not half this value? Why can the claimed small frequency separation not be the
effect of rotation?
This is because some additional constraints are available that help in the interpretation of
pulsational mode spectra. As the p mode pulsation periods depend on the sound travel time

224 4
Asteroseismology
through the star, they must be related to its size, or more precisely, to its mean density. The
pulsation constant
Q = P
√¯ρ⊙
¯ρ ,
(4.11)
where P is the pulsation period and ¯ρ is the mean stellar density, is a useful indicator of what
type of mode one sees in a given star. Over the whole HR diagram, the Q value for the radial
fundamental mode is between 0.03 and 0.04 days; for the Sun, it is 0.033 days (0.8 h). As men-
tioned before, radial modes can only be p modes, (pure) p modes always have frequencies of
the same order or larger than that of the radial fundamental, and (pure) g modes always have
frequencies lower than that.
Because GD 358 is a white dwarf star and therefore has high mean density, its radial fun-
damental mode period would be of the order of 4 s. On the other hand, α Cen A, a little more
massive and more evolved than our Sun, has a radial fundamental mode period of about 1 h.
Therefore, the similar 5–10 min pulsation periods of the two stars correspond to completely
different types of mode.
The asymptotic p mode frequency separation also relates to the stellar mean density
Δν= Δν, ⊙
√ρ⊙
ρ ,
(4.12)
where Δν,⊙= μHz. Given the knowledge on the mass and evolutionary state of α Cen A,
it immediately be inferred that 106.2 μHz must be the large frequency spacing. Finally, the
rotation period of α Cen A is much too long to generate m-mode splitting with the observed
δν.
Apart from these examples, there is another clue toward the nature of observed pulsation
modes just from observed frequency spectra. Radial modes are global oscillations that may
reveal themselves because the period ratios of consecutive overtones are well known. On the
main sequence, the period ratio of the radial fundamental mode and the first overtone is around
0.773, and the period ratio of the first to second overtone radial modes is 0.810. For more
evolved stars, such as the δ Cephei stars, these ratios change to 0.705 and 0.805, respectively.
Such period ratios are therefore suggestive to correspond to radial modes.
3.2 Methods for Mode Identiﬁcation
It is now clear that besides the pulsational mode spectra of stars themselves, the incorporation of
other constraints is useful for their interpretation. This is particularly important for oscillation
spectra that do not show obvious imprints of the underlying modes, like those of stars pulsat-
ing in high radial overtones. Examples are pulsations of low radial overtone or stars rotating
so rapidly that the rotational splitting is of the same order as the frequency spacing of con-
secutive radial overtones of the same l or of modes of the same k, but different l. In practice,
most observed stellar oscillation spectra are incomplete, either because the star chooses so or
because the observations do not have sufficient sensitivity, which makes it even more difficult
to recognize patterns in the observed frequencies or periods and to type the modes accordingly.
Therefore, mode identification methods have been developed, of which a variety is available.

The first method uses photometric data only. The flux change for nonradial pulsation in the
linear regime can be expressed as (Watson 1988)
Δm(λ, t) = −.єP∣m∣
l
(μ)((T+ T) cos(ωt + ψT) + (T+ T+ T)cos(ωt)),
(4.13)
where Δm(λ, t) is the time and wavelength dependent magnitude variation of an oscillation,
−.є is an amplitude parameter transformed from fluxes to magnitudes, P∣m∣
l
is the associ-
ated Legendre polynomial, μis the cosine of the inclination of the stellar pulsation axis with
respect to the observer, ω is the angular pulsation frequency, t is time, and ψT is the phase
lag between the changes in temperature and local geometry (mostly originating in convection
zones near the stellar surface). The term Tis the local temperature change on the surface, T
is the temperature-dependentlimb darkening variation, Tis the local geometry change on the
stellar surface, Tis the local surface pressure change, and Tis the gravity-dependent limb
darkening variation.
The Ti terms can be determined for different types of pulsator from theoretical model atmo-
spheres, and the observables best suited to reveal the types of mode present can also be deduced.
These would for instance be the photometric amplitude ratios or phase shifts between differ-
ent filter passbands, but also the optimal passbands themselves. An example of such a mode
identification is shown in >Fig. 4-9.
From photometry alone, only the spherical degree of a given pulsation mode can be iden-
tified. The method can be supported by adding radial velocity measurements, which increases
its sensitivity (Daszy´nska-Daszkiewicz et al. 2005), but still does not supply a determination of
the azimuthal order. To this end, high-resolution spectroscopy must be invoked.
The lines in a stellar spectrum are broadened by rotation through the Doppler effect: the
intrinsic line profile is blueshifted on the parts of the stellar surface approaching the observer,
and redshifted on the areas moving away. The effect is strongest on the stellarlimb and decreases
towards the center. As a consequence, a rotationally broadened line profile contains spatial
information of the stellar surface. For instance, in a dark starspot flux is missing, and a spike
will move through the line profile as the spot rotates over the visible disk. The method to recon-
struct stellar surface structure from line profile variations is called Doppler Imaging (Vogt and
Penrod 1983).

Line proﬁle variations due to stellar pulsation. The upper parts of the graph show the shape of the
oscillation mode on the surface, whereas the thin lines in the lower halves represent the unper-
turbed rotationally broadened line proﬁle, and the thick lines are the superpositions with the
pulsation. Each individual mode (from left to right: l = 4, m = 0; l = 5, ∣m∣= 3; l = ∣m∣= 7)
generates a diﬀerent distortion of the line proﬁle (Adapted from Telting and Schrijvers (1997))
Apart from radial velocity changes, stellar oscillations also cause variations in rotationally
broadened line profiles. The areas on the stellar surface that have an additional approaching
component to their motion with respect to the observer have their contribution to the line
profile blueshifted, whereas the receding parts are redshifted by the corresponding amount of
pulsational Doppler velocity. The net result of all these motions is bumps traveling through
the line profile, and their shapes are governed by the oscillation mode causing them (e.g., see
Telting 2003 for a review). Examining stellar line profiles, pulsation modes of up to l ≈can
be observed and identified, a vast extension in l compared to photometric and radial velocity
techniques. Some examples of pulsational line profile variations are shown in >Fig. 4-10.
The task now is to extract the correct values of l and m from the observed variations.
The principle is to fit the theoretically calculated 3-D velocity field to the observed line profiles,
and a wide range of spectroscopic mode identification methods is available. Some of the most
commonly used are the Moment method (most suitable for low l), the pixel-by-pixel method,
the Fourier Parameter Fit method, or Doppler reconstruction of the surface distortions. High-
resolution spectroscopy is better suited for the determination of m rather than l which makes
it complementary to photometric and radial velocity methods.
When resorting to photometric or spectroscopic methods, it is not required to arrive at
unique identifications of all observed pulsation modes in each given star. What is needed is
the secure identification of a sufficient number of modes to rule out all possible alternative
interpretations. An example will be presented later.
3.3 Asteroseismic Modeling
The observed pulsation frequencies and their identifications are then matched to theoretical
models (see Kawaler, this volume, for details). These would ideally be full evolutionary models
with pulsation codes operating on them, although a few codes based on envelope models are
still in use.

Asteroseismology 4
227
Most pulsation codes use the linear approximation, which means that the oscillations are
treated as linear perturbations around the equilibrium state. This allows the evaluation of the
excitation of oscillation modes and thus the computation of theoretical domains of pulsation
in the HR diagram. Nonlinear computations, that would allow predictions of oscillation ampli-
tudes, are still rather the exception than the rule because they are, even today, expensive in terms
of computing time, as are numerical hydrodynamical simulations.
Many stellar pulsation codes employ the adiabatic approximation (sometimes called isen-
tropic approximation) to compute oscillation frequencies, which is the assumption that no
energy exchange between the oscillating element and its surroundings takes place. Other codes
perform nonadiabatic frequency computations. A wide variety of stellar oscillation codes is
available, and most theory groups use their own routines, optimized for the application to their
objects of main interest.
There are several strategies to find seismic models from observations. Some compare the
observed oscillation frequencies with those of a grid of stellar models and perform automatic
matching between them. This is computationally extensive, which means that supercomput-
ers or parallel processing are invoked, or that intelligent optimization methods such as genetic
algorithms are employed, or both.
Other strategies start with first imposing observational constraints. Besides the observed
oscillation frequencies themselves and the identification of the underlying pulsation modes,
these would often be estimates of the objects’ positions in the HR diagram. As an example,
these are shown for the β Cephei star ν Eridani in >Fig. 4-11.

and SPB star (dashed lines) instability strips are also shown

Asteroseismology
The detection of a radial mode in the frequency spectrum is an asset for asteroseismic stud-
ies of this star: there are only three possibilities for the value of its mean density. These depend
on whether its frequency corresponds to the fundamental, the first or the second radial over-
tone (>4.11). A comparison of the observed position of the star in the HR diagram (right panel
of >Fig. 4-11) with its error bars leads to the rejection of the second overtone hypothesis, and
to the elimination of models with masses below 8.5 M⊙.
Now the l = modes come into play: moving along the lines of constant mean density in the
HR diagram, a comparison between their observed and theoretically predicted frequencies can
be made. This is done on the left side in >Fig. 4-12. Given the uncertainties and assumptions
in the asteroseismic model construction, all l = modes are reproduced by models between
9.1 and 9.8 M⊙that have the radial mode as the fundamental. However, the frequency of the
highest-overtonedipole mode cannot be explained within the errors for the models that assume
the first overtone for the radial mode. This interpretation can therefore also be rejected. The
modal assignment to the observed frequencies is now unambiguous, and the range of models
to be explored for seismic fitting is severely reduced.

Asteroseismology 4
229
The reason why this way of mode identification was successful is that the gmode and its
respective p mode neighbor are in the process of avoided crossing in the parameter space of
interest. Small changes in the evolutionary states of the models depending on mass therefore
lead to significant changes in their frequencies. The observed l = mode has been excluded
from the mode identification procedure as all models in the parameter domain under consid-
eration reproduce its frequency correctly: it is nearly a pure p mode and its frequency hardly
changes in models of the same mean density.
In this restricted parameter space, an interesting observation can be made: the observed
l = m-mode splittings do not agree with those predicted by uniformly rotating models
(>Fig. 4-12, right-hand side). Fitting the rotational splitting for the gmode, that samples the
deep stellar interior, results in predicted splitting about 30% larger than that observed for the
pmode, which is concentrated closer to the surface. This means that the star’s rotation rate
increases toward its interior, as predicted bytheory(Talon et al. 1997). In addition, as the l = , g
mode frequency is sensitive to the size of the convective core (it is the gc mode!), a constraint
on the convective core overshooting parameter was also obtained (Pamyatnykh et al. 2004).
This example shows the potential of asteroseismology, even when only few pulsation modes
are available. Radial pulsation modes are quite valuable in the identification process as they
immediately result in accurate constraints on the stellar mean density, that can become unam-
biguous when the radial overtone of the mode can be inferred, supported by other estimates
such as on effective temperature and luminosity. Theory and observations work hand in hand.
Once a unique identification of the normal modes is achieved, some firm results on stellar
structure can be obtained, even given uncertainties in the modeling procedure.
In the case of ν Eridani, the most severe problem is that the l = , pmode is hard to be
excited and accurately matched in frequency given the observed effective temperature of the star
and its chemical surface composition. Only changes to the input physics would solve this prob-
lem. This is just the goal of asteroseismology: to improve our knowledge about stellar physics.
Such an improvement can only be achieved using observational results that present models
cannot account for!

Applications
4.1 Pulsating White and Pre-white Dwarf Stars
The first pulsators that could be studied asteroseismicallywere white dwarf and pre-white dwarf
stars, pulsating in high-overtone low-degree g modes. A remarkable initial result was the the-
oretical prediction of a then new class of pulsating white dwarfs of spectral type DB, and
their subsequent observational confirmation (Winget et al. 1982). Upon the realization that
some pulsating white dwarf stars have very complicated frequency spectra, and having a well-
developed theory of white dwarf pulsation available, the main obstacle to extracting correct
mode frequencies from observational data was the daily interruptions of the measurements by
sunlight. >Figure 4-13 explains why.
The interruptions cause ambiguities in the determination of the frequencies of the signals
present in the data: a frequency different by one cycle per sidereal day from the real oscillation
frequency would fit the data to comparable precision. In the presence of complicated variability

Simulation of observations from a single astronomical site. The ﬁlledcircles represent the measure-
ments, including noise. The full line is a ﬁt with the correct frequency present in the data, and the
dotted line is a ﬁt with a frequency diﬀerent by one cycle per day. The two ﬁts represent the data
almost equally well. However, they would be completely out of phase, and the correct one imme-
diately obvious, if measurements were available in between the present data, from a site 180○
diﬀerent in geographical longitude. This led to the setup of multisite telescope networks
and most notably for signals of low signal-to-noise this could lead to erroneous frequency
determinations. Any seismic model based on incorrect observational input is misleading.
The solution to this problem is to avoid, or at least minimize, daytime gaps in time resolved
measurements. This can be accomplished by concerted observational efforts, involving inter-
ested colleagues over the whole globe, passing on the asteroseismictarget from one observatory
to the next. The best known of these collaborations is the Whole Earth Telescope (WET, Nather
et al. 1990), invented for the study of pulsating white dwarf stars.
One of the first WET runs was devoted to the prototypical pulsating pre-white dwarf star
PG 1159-035 = GW Vir. It resulted in the detection of over 100 g mode frequencies of l = 
and l = modes of high radial overtone, leading to precise determinations of the stellar mass
and rotation period, an asteroseismic detection of compositional stratification, and an upper
limit to the magnetic field strength (Winget et al. 1991). Subsequent WET observations of the
prototypical pulsating DB white dwarf star GD 358 = V777 Her showed a mode spectrum dom-
inated by high-overtone l = g modes (cf. >Fig. 4-8), resulting in determinations of its total
and surface Helium layer mass, luminosity, and rotation rate (Winget et al. 1994).
The evolution of white dwarf stars is dominated by cooling, at (nearly) constant radius. As
they cool, they pass through a number of instability strips. Evidence is that all white dwarf
stars located in such instability domains in the HR diagram do pulsate. This has an important
consequence: the interior structures of the pulsators must be representative of all white dwarf
stars. Thus asteroseismic results for white dwarf pulsators can be extended to the stars that do
not oscillate.
Cooling of pulsating white dwarf stars changes their oscillation periods, and the rate of
period change is directly related to their energy loss. The hottest DB pulsators have reason-
ably high neutrino emission rates, and their evolutionary period changes may be able to tell
us whether their neutrino emission is compatible with the standard model of particle physics
(Winget et al. 2004). Measurements to detect such a period change are ongoing. On the other
hand, the period changes of DA pulsators (some of which are the most stable optical clocks in
the Universe, Kepler et al. 2005) could reveal the masses of axions, if the latter existed (Kim
et al. 2006).

Asteroseismology 4
231
Asteroseismology of white dwarf pulsators does not only allow to detect stratification in
their chemical profiles near the surface, it also gives evidence of their core composition. This,
in turn, is dependent on their history of evolution on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and
can be used to obtain constraints on the nuclear reaction rates in AGB stars. Present results
(Metcalfe 2005) indicate consistency with evolutionary models.
As white dwarf stars cool, their cores become crystallized. Being composed mainly of car-
bon and oxygen, such cores can be seen as giant diamonds! Massive white dwarf stars begin to
crystallize when still in the DAV (ZZ Ceti) instability strip, and asteroseismic investigations of
one such massive pulsator have proven substantial crystallization in its interior (Brassard and
Fontaine 2005; Metcalfe et al. 2004).
The light curve shapes of pulsating white dwarf stars of spectral types DB and DA are often
nonsinusoidal. The nonlinearities originate in their convection zones, that cannot instantly
adjust to the pulsational variations (the g mode pulsations of pulsating white dwarf stars are
almost exclusively due to temperature changes; Robinson et al. 1982). As the light curve shapes
of such pulsators depend on the thermal response time of the convection zone, the latter
parameter can be determined from nonlinear light curve fits (Montgomery 2005).
As a final example, there are pulsating white dwarf stars in mass accreting close binary sys-
tems. If the mass transfer rate is in a certain range, the surface temperature of the accreting white
dwarf places it in an instability strip. A handful of such oscillators is known to date (Mukadam
et al. 2007), but attempts at asteroseismology have proven difficult due to low amplitudes and
unstable mode spectra.
Among all classes of pulsating star (aside from the Sun itself), asteroseismology of pulsat-
ing white dwarf stars is certainly in the most advanced state. A new class of such oscillators
has recently been proposed, hot DQ stars with carbon-dominated atmospheres and tempera-
tures similar to that of the DB pulsators (Dufour et al. 2009; Montgomery et al. 2007). There
is little doubt remaining that the variability of these stars is due to pulsation. Theory predicts
yet another new type of white dwarf oscillator, DA white dwarf stars somewhat hotter than
the DB pulsators, but observational searches for them have so far been inconclusive (Kurtz
et al. 2008). We refer to Montgomery (2009), and references therein, for more information on
asteroseismology of pulsating white dwarf stars.
4.2 Delta Scuti Stars
At about the same time when the necessity for worldwide observing efforts for pulsating white
dwarf stars was realized, the same conclusion was reached for δ Scuti stars, some of which also
exhibit complex oscillation spectra, but in this case composed of g, p, and mixed modes of low
overtone. The Delta Scuti Network, founded over 25 years ago, was the first multisite observing
collaboration for these stars, followed by a number of others such as STEPHI or STACC; also a
few WET runs were devoted to δ Scuti stars.
The asteroseismic potential of δ Scuti stars is enormous, but could so far not be fully
exploited. Part of the reason is visible in >Fig. 4-4: the pure p mode spectrum on the ZAMS
mainly allows a determination of the stellarmean density. When the scientifically more interest-
ing mixed modes appear, the frequency spectrum is fairly dense and requires a large amount of
data and long time base to be resolved observationally. However, the real stars seldom cooper-
ate in showing many of the potentially excited modes at observable amplitude, inhibiting mode

232 4
Asteroseismology
identification by pattern recognition. In addition, mode amplitudes are often small, counter-
acting reliable identifications of many modes by applying the methods discussed before. Even
though dozens or even hundreds of pulsation modes have been detected in some δ Scuti stars,
little has been learnt on their interior structures from asteroseismology so far.
Pulsational amplitude limitation of δ Scuti stars is a major problem for theory: what makes
the star excite only certain modes, which modes would these be and what determines their
amplitudes?
For slowly rotating δ Scuti stars gravitational settling and radiative levitation give rise to
chemical surface peculiarities and are believed to deplete the pulsational driving regions. Con-
sequently, Am and Ap stars are not expected to pulsate, although a few of them do (Kurtz 2000).
This also means that many δ Scuti stars rotate rapidly, which requires special calculations to
extract information from their distorted pulsation modes, a field that has made considerable
progress in the recent past (Reese et al. 2009).
Some pre-main sequence stars cross the δ Scuti instability strip on their way to the ZAMS,
and consequently pulsate. The interior structures of these stars are fairly simple, which may
make them more accessible to asteroseismic investigation compared to their main sequence
counterparts. The oscillation spectra of pre-main sequence and main sequence δ Scuti stars
in the same position in the HR diagram are predicted to be different, which may allow an
asteroseismic separation (Suran et al. 2001).
4.3 Slowly Pulsating B and Gamma Doradus Stars
These two classes of high-overtone g mode pulsator, although well separated in effective tem-
perature, share most of their asteroseismic characteristics. They also share the problems with
respect to observations, caused by their long periods: resolving their oscillation spectra requires
measurements over a long time baseline, possibly many years. It is therefore no surprise that
most of the known members of these two groups of pulsator were discovered with the HIP-
PARCOS (HIgh Precision PARallax COllecting Satellite) mission from its data set spanning
over 3 years (Handler 1999; Waelkens et al. 1998).
As in pulsating white dwarf stars, effects of inhomogeneities in stellar structure would man-
ifest themselves in mode trapping and thus in oscillatory behavior in the g mode periods with
respect to their radial overtone (Miglio et al. 2008). The dominant inhomogeneity is the change
in mean molecular weight at the edge of the convective core, whose size can therefore be mea-
sured. This is a method alternative to measuring the frequency of the gc mode in p mode
pulsators.
Several of the SPB and γ Doradus stars rotate with periods comparable to their oscillation
periods. This, again, calls for models that take rotation into account with a more sophisticated
approach than perturbation theory; the corresponding work is in progress.
The γ Doradus stars are located in a domain where the influence of convection on the pul-
sations is significant; convection is also responsible for the red edge of the δ Scuti instability
domain. Modeling with a time-dependent convection approach allowed Dupret et al. (2005) to
reproduce the observed boundaries of these instability strips, and also to perform predictions
of mode excitation in these stars. The situation for the SPB and γ Doradus stars with respect
to asteroseismology is therefore the same as for δ Scuti stars: the basic theory is in place, the
difficulty remains to find stars permitting the extraction of the required information from the
observations.

Asteroseismology 4
233
4.4 Beta Cephei Stars
The β Cephei stars are massive (∼9–17 M⊙) early-B main sequence stars that oscillate radially
and nonradially in p, g, and mixed modes of low radial overtone. This is roughly the same type
of modes as excited in the δ Scuti stars, but asteroseismology has been more successful for
β Cephei stars in the recent past due to several reasons.
The observed frequency spectra are simple enough to provide initial clues for mode iden-
tification, yet complicated enough to reveal information about the stars’ interior structures.
Photometric and spectroscopic mode identification methods (and combinations of both) could
be applied successfully to some β Cephei stars (e.g., De Ridder et al. 2004), additionally aided by
the large radial velocity to light amplitude ratios (of the order of several hundreds km/s/mag)
of their pulsation modes. Sufficient information for unique identifications of all modes was
obtained; an example was shown earlier.
Asteroseismic modeling was also eased for β Cephei stars, as radial modes have sometimes
been identified ( > Sect. 3.3, > Fig. 4-11). This immediately reduces the parameter space in
which a seismic model must be sought by one dimension. Due to the evolutionary state of
β Cephei stars (near the center of the main sequence), a few of the observed nonradial modes
are of mixed p/g type, which has provided information about the convective core size and/or
differential interior rotation in a number of stars (e.g., Aerts et al. 2003; Pamyatnykh et al.
2004).
Apart from learning about stellar interiors, asteroseismology of β Cephei stars has inter-
esting astrophysical implications. Given their high masses, they are progenitors of supernovae
of Type II which are largely responsible for the chemical enrichment of galaxies. The evolution
of massive stars is strongly affected by rotational mixing and angular momentum transport
(Maeder and Meynet 2000); their internal rotation profile is testable by asteroseismology of
β Cephei stars.
However, the field has not yet matured to a point where we can claim satisfactory under-
standing of all aspects of the physics governing the interior structures of massive main sequence
stars. Several questions may be answered by seismic sounding of β Cephei stars, such as: How
strong is their differential interior rotation? How efficient is internal angular momentum trans-
port (Townsend 2009)? How strong is convective core overshooting? Can all stars between
∼9–17 M⊙be modeled with the same convective overshooting parameter?
There are additional questions related to the pulsation physics of β Cephei stars that need
to be addressed. Only the center of the theoretically predicted β Cephei instability strip is pop-
ulated by observed pulsators. Is this an observational shortcoming or a weakness of theory?
What is the upper mass limit of the β Cephei stars? Are there post-main sequence β Cep stars,
contrary to theoretical predictions?
Five different observables strongly depend on the opacities and element mixtures used
for theoretical modeling of β Cephei stars: the radial fundamental to first overtone period
ratio, the excited range of pulsation modes, the frequencies of p modes with radial overtones
larger than two, the dependence of bolometric flux amplitude on the surface displacement
(Daszy´nska-Daszkiewicz and Walczak 2009), and in case of a “hybrid” pulsator (see below)
the excited range of g modes. Most of these observables are largely independent of each other;
modeling of some stars shows that no standard input opacities and element mixtures can
explain the pulsation spectra in detail. Therefore, the last question that may be answered from
asteroseismology of β Cephei stars is: where must we improve the input physics for stellar
modeling?

234 4
Asteroseismology
Some β Cephei and SPB stars have emission-line spectra and are thus Be stars. These objects
rotate rapidly and have circumstellar disks, occasional outbursts, etc. They may also be studied
asteroseismically, but their oscillations are hard to be detected and identified, and their rapid
rotation requires special theoretical treatment – that is underway.
4.5 Pulsating Subdwarf Stars
Three types of pulsating subdwarf stars are known: long-period subdwarf B (sdB) stars that
oscillate in high-overtone g modes (V1093 Herculis stars), short-period sdB stars pulsating in
low-overtone p and g modes (V361 Hydrae stars), and the only oscillating subdwarf O (sdO)
star known to date, a low-overtone p mode pulsator.
Although their g modes would allow the sounding of deep interior regions, their faintness,
long periods, and low amplitudes made V1093 Herculis stars escape asteroseismic study so
far. Theoretical studies of the sdO pulsator have so far been focused on the problem of mode
excitation. Therefore, the only subdwarf pulsators that have been asteroseismically modeled are
among the V361 Hydrae stars.
This is no easy undertaking as the problem with mode identification and mostly sparse (but
for a few stars rich and highly variable) frequency spectra again occurs. It is possible that these
objects have steep interior rotation gradients. Pulsation models must also be built upon evolu-
tionary modelsincluding the effects of gravitational settling and radiative levitation. In practice,
modeling is carried out by surveying parameter space in effective temperature, gravity, mass and
hydrogen mass fraction, and by seeking best agreement between observed and theoretically pre-
dicted oscillation frequencies. Results have been obtained on about a dozen of those stars, and
a mass distribution consistent with that expected from a double star evolutionary scenario has
been obtained. Charpinet et al. (2009) elaborated on many aspects of asteroseismic modeling
of pulsating subdwarf stars.
4.6 Rapidly Oscillating Ap Stars
The rapidly oscillating Ap (or short: roAp) stars are special among the pulsating stars because
their high-overtone p mode oscillations are predominantly governed by a magnetic field that
aligns their pulsation axis with the magnetic, and not with the rotation, axis of the stars. The
magnetic field also distorts the pulsations modes, so they can no longer be described with a
single spherical harmonic.
Because of their short periods and very low amplitudes (below 1%) these stars have for
many years been studied photometrically only; an extensive review was given by Kurtz and
Martinez (2000). Spectroscopic observations of roAp stars, however, provided a new level of
insight, particularly into atmospheric physics of these pulsators.
The reason is that the vertical wavelength of the pulsation modes is shorter than or about
the same order of the layer thicknesses of the chemical elements in their atmospheres that are
highly stratified by radiative levitation. Therefore the radial velocity amplitudes of the oscilla-
tions change with line depth and from one chemical species to the other. The chemical elements
are also inhomogeneously distributed over the surface, allowing three-dimensional studies of
the abundances and pulsational geometry (Kurtz 2009).

Asteroseismology 4
235
Because of the unique possibilities offered by the atmospheric structure of roAp stars, spec-
troscopy is also much more sensitive in detecting oscillations compared to photometry. As an
outstanding example, Mkrtichian et al. (2008) detected a complete l = –2 mode spectrum for
Przybylski’s star over 3–4 radial orders and performed some initial seismic modeling.
4.7 Solar-Like Oscillators
The low amplitudes of the stochastically excited oscillations of solar-type stars made their obser-
vational detection elusive for a long time. In retrospect, the first detection was made by Kjeldsen
et al. (1995), but confirmed only several years later. Meanwhile, the observational accuracy
has improved to an extent that detections were made in hundreds of stars (mostly giants), and
seismic analyses of several were performed.
The potential of solar-like oscillations for seismic sounding is large. Once detected, the
pulsation modes are rather easy to be identified because they are high-overtone p modes;
see
> Sect. 3.1 for an example. So are the large and the small frequency separations (if
detectable), immediately placing main sequence stars on the (asteroseismic) HR diagram.
Most interesting, as for all pulsators with nearly-asymptotic frequency spectra, are irregu-
larities in the latter, caused by features in the stellar interiors. These would for instance be the
base of their envelope convection zones, or the helium ionization region. Houdek (2009) gave an
overview of the expected seismic signatures of such features and their astrophysical importance.
The phenomenon of avoided crossing (> Fig. 4-4) also takes place in solar-like oscillators
once they have reached the subgiant stage, and it makes itself obvious in Echelle diagrams
(Bedding et al. 2007). As for other types of pulsator, this would allow an asteroseismic deter-
mination of the convective core size (for stars sufficiently massive to possess a convective
core).
The limited lifetimes of the intrinsically damped solar-like oscillations enable inferences
concerning pulsation mode physics. The observed power spectra at individual mode frequen-
cies show a multitude of peaks whose overall shape would correspond to a Lorentzian. The
half-widths of these Lorentzians yield a determination of the mode damping rates; the mode
lifetimes are inversely proportional to those. The mode lifetimes are in turn dependent on
properties of the surface convection zone.
Theoretical predictions of the amplitudes of solar-like oscillators are important not only for
understanding their physics, but also for planning observational efforts. After years of predic-
tions resulting in amplitudes larger than were observed, the incorporation of the mode lifetimes
and subsequent computation of mode heights appear to result in a scaling law that estimates
observed amplitudes well (Chaplin et al. 2009), and seems in agreement with measurements up
to oscillating giants (Hekker et al. 2009).
Finally, it is worth to note that as all cool stars possess a convective envelope, it can be
expected the solar-like oscillations are excited in all of them, up to red supergiants (Kiss et al.
2006).
4.8 Hybrid Pulsators
Some of the pulsational instability strips shown in >Fig. 4-1 partly overlap. It is therefore logical
to suspect that stars that belong to two different classes of pulsating stars, having two different

236 4
Asteroseismology
sets of pulsational mode spectra excited simultaneously, may exist. Indeed, a number of those
have been discovered. This is good news for asteroseismology as the information carried by
both types of oscillation can be exploited. The confirmed cases have so far always been high-
overtone g modes and low-overtone p modes, as evaluations of the pulsation constants of the
oscillations show. Mixed-mode pulsations by themselves are not “hybrid” pulsations because
they occupy the same frequency domain as pure p modes.
There are δ Scuti/γ Doradus stars, β Cephei/SPB stars, and long/short-period subdwarf B
pulsators. The main physical difference between the B-type and A/F-type “hybrid” pulsators is
that in the first group the same driving mechanism excites both types of oscillation, whereas
in the δ Scuti/γ Doradus stars two main driving mechanisms are at work. The cooler δ Scuti
stars and all γ Doradus stars should have thin surface convection zones that would support the
excitation of solar-like oscillations (e.g., Samadi et al. 2002).
The revision in our knowledge of the solar chemical element mixture (Asplund et al. 2004)
resulted in the prediction of a much larger overlap region between β Cephei and SPB stars
in the HR diagram, and the frequency ranges of the excited long- and short-period modes
in “hybrid” B-type pulsators suggest that the heavy-element opacities used for stellar model
calculations are still too low (Dziembowski and Pamyatnykh 2008; Handler et al. 2009). Intrigu-
ingly, a similar conclusion has been independently obtained from helioseismology (Guzik et al.
2009).
One of the first hybrid pulsators reported in the literature (HD 209295, Handler et al. 2002)
turned out to have its g mode oscillations tidally excited by another star in a close eccentric
orbit. The changing gravitational influence of the companion gives rise to forced oscillations
with frequencies that are integer multiples of the orbital frequency. The tidal deformation of
the pulsating star is similar to a sectoral l = mode, and such modes are therefore most eas-
ily excited. There are also several known cases of pulsation in ellipsoidal variables. Whereas
close binarity represents an additional complication for theoretical asteroseismic studies due to
the gravitational distortion of the pulsator, some other cases of binarity can be used to obtain
additional constraints for seismic modeling.
4.9 Pulsation in Eclipsing Binaries and Open Clusters
The fundamental way to determine stellar physical parameters, in particular masses,is the anal-
ysis of detached eclipsing binary systems whose components can be assumed to have evolved
as if they were single (Torres et al. 2010). Such constraints are most welcome for asteroseismol-
ogy and therefore it is self-evident that pulsators be sought for in such binaries. To date, several
dozens of such systems are known. Most of these would be δ Scuti pulsators, some are β Cephei
stars, but the best studied case is a short-period sdB pulsator.
These objects provide another possibility for mode identification (Nather and Robinson
1974): Throughout the eclipse, different parts of the stellar surface become invisible. In case
of nonradial oscillations, only part of the pulsation mode is seen, and the light amplitudes and
phases change according to the type of mode. In this way, the oscillation mode can be identified,
a method known as eclipse mapping or spatial filtration (e.g., Reed et al. 2005).
Another way to gain support for asteroseismic modeling is to study pulsators in stellar clus-
ters. Besides the possibility to observe several objects simultaneously (e.g., via CCD photometry
or multifiber spectroscopy), cluster stars can be assumed to have originated from the same

Asteroseismology 4
237
interstellar cloud. Therefore, they should be of the same age and chemical composition. These
parameters can be well determined from the properties of the cluster itself, and be imposed as
a constraint on the seismic modeling procedure of all pulsating cluster members, also known
as ensemble asteroseismology.
4.10 A New Era in Precision
Most observational results reported in this chapter so far were based on classical ground based
observing methods, such as single- and multisite photometry and spectroscopy. However, a new
era in observational asteroseismology has begun.
Asteroseismology requires knowledge about as many intrinsic stellar oscillation frequen-
cies as possible, and these often have low amplitude, calling for measurements with the highest
accuracy. As this is also a requirement for the search for extrasolar planets, synergies between
the two fields have emerged.
Spectroscopically, asteroseismology has benefited from high-precision radial velocity tech-
niques, such as the iodine cell method, originally invented to find extrasolar planets. Mea-
surements of oscillations in distant stars with amplitudes down to 20 cm/s, about one-tenth of
human walking speed, have become possible in that way. Only about a dozen spectrographs
worldwide are capable of reaching the required precision. Such observations are still there-
fore expensive in terms of observing time and complexity of data analysis, but new observing
networks, such as the Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG, http://astro.phys.au.dk/
SONG/) aim at achieving similar precision on a regular basis. SIAMOIS (Sismomètre Inter-
férentiel À Mesurer les Oscillations des Intérieurs Stellaires, Mosser et al. 2009) is expected to
work at the same precision and duty cycle with its single node placed in Antarctica.
Concerning photometry, the main problem of ground based observations is scintillation,
irregular changes in the measured intensity due to anomalous atmospheric refraction caused
by turbulent mixing of air with different temperatures. The solution to this problem is to observe
stellar variability from space. Here the synergy with extrasolar planet research is that the mea-
surements have sufficient precision to detect the signature of transits of planets when they pass
in front of their host star.
Aside from fine-guidance sensor Hubble Space Telescope photometry, the first astero-
seismic data from space were due to an accident. The main science mission of the WIRE
(Wide-Field Infrared Explorer) satellite failed due to loss of cooling fluid for the main instru-
ment, but the star trackers, of 52 mm aperture, were consequently used for time-resolved
photometry. An overview of the results can be found in the paper by Bruntt and Southworth
(2008); WIRE has fully ceased operation in October 2006.
The first dedicated asteroseismic space mission that was successfully launched is MOST
(Microvariability and Oscillations of STars, http://www.astro.ubc.ca/MOST/, Matthews 2006;
Walker et al. 2003). The spacecraft is in orbit since June 2003 and still continues to provide
asteroseismic data with its 15-cm telescope as main instrument. One of the most interesting
results from MOST was the discovery of high-overtone g mode oscillations in a supergiant B
star (Saio et al. 2006), suggesting an extension of the SPB star instability domain to the highest
luminosities.
The CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and Transits, Baglin 2003) mission was successfully
launched in December 2006 and hosts a 27-cm telescope. It observes two fields of × ○on

238 4
Asteroseismology
the sky each, one devoted to asteroseismology of a few bright stars, and the other searching for
planetary transits in many stars, at the same time performing a high-precision stellar variability
survey. A special volume of Astronomy & Astrophysics (2009) reports some of the early CoRoT
science.
Asteroseismically, the detection of solar-like oscillations in almost a thousand giant stars
is remarkable (Hekker et al. 2009). In addition, one of the most intriguing CoRoT results was
the detection of large numbers of variability frequencies in two δ Scuti stars. Interpreted as
independent pulsation modes, these would supply hundreds of oscillations to be asteroseis-
mically modeled, reverting the basic problem for the study of these objects: first, there were
too few modes available, now there would be too many! However, doubts have been raised
whether all the frequencies extracted from those data would really correspond to normal modes
of pulsation, or would rather be a signature of granulation (Kallinger and Matthews 2010).
Originally designed for the search for earth-like planets in the habitable zone, the latest
addition to the asteroseismicspace fleet became Kepler (http://www.kepler.nasa.gov), launched
in March 2009. Asteroseismology can measure the radii of solar-like oscillators, among which
should be planet-hosting stars, to a relative accuracy of 3%. Thus, the radii of transiting plan-
ets would be known to 3%. Therefore, it was decided to devote a small percentage of the
observing time of this space telescope with an effective 95-cm aperture to asteroseismology.
Kepler is the most powerful photometry tool for asteroseismology to date and observes a
∼× ○field for 3 years, practically without interruption, providing a time base considerably
longer than all other present missions. Initial results of the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation,
based on the first 43 days of science operations, were summarized by Gilliland et al. (2010).
A possible shortcoming of all these asteroseismic space missions is that they observe in
only one passband. Therefore, all information that is available for seismic modeling are the tar-
gets’ oscillation frequencies, unless mode identifications are provided by ground-based support
observations. These are often difficult because the larger space telescopes mostly observe faint
targets. The BRITE-Constellation (BRIght Target Explorer, http://www.brite-constellation.at)
mission therefore adopts quite a different strategy. BRITE consists of three pairs of nanosatel-
lites hosting a 3-cm telescope each that will observe in at least two different passbands (one per
satellite), facilitating mode identification with the photometric method. BRITE-Constellation
will preferentially observe stars brighter than fifth magnitude and has a large × ○field
of view. Given the brightness of the science targets, mode identification from high-resolution
spectroscopy can also easily be done. The first pair of satellites is to be launched in early 2012.
Finally, PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations, http://sci.esa.int/plato) is a mission
designed to provide a full statistical analysis of exoplanetary systems around nearby and bright
stars. Currently in the definition phase, it will host 28 telescopes of 10 cm aperture that will
observe two 557 sq. deg fields for 2.5 years each. It is intended to observe 100,000 stars to a
precision of 1 ppm per month and 500,000 stars to somewhat poorer accuracy to determine
stellar and planetary masses to 1%.
4.11 Prospects and Problems
Asteroseismology is a research field evolving so rapidly that some of the results reported here
will already be outdated when this book appears in print. Given the ∼30-year headstart of
helioseismology in comparison, the field now is in its teenage years, but matures rapidly.

Asteroseismology 4
239
The theoretical basis for asteroseismic studies is laid, although far from being perfect. Some
of the problems that require solution comprise improved treatment of magnetic fields, con-
vection, internal flows, and fast rotation. It is still poorly known what causes stellar cycles, and
what makes certain classes of pulsator select the types of mode they oscillate in. Some asteroseis-
mic results point toward a requirement of still higher heavy-element opacities, which current
calculations do not seem capable of providing.
Observationally, pulsating white dwarf stars, β Cephei stars, and solar-like oscillators have
been studied asteroseismically, and continue to be. There are high hopes that present asteroseis-
mic space missions will open the δ Scuti, SPB, γ Doradus, and V1093 Herculis stars for interior
structure modeling, and further improve the situation for V361 Hydrae stars. Future high-
precision radial velocity networks and sites will improve our knowledge mostly for solar-like
oscillators and roAp stars, with the latter guiding theory of stellar pulsation under the influ-
ence of rotation and magnetic fields. The Kepler mission will provide asteroseismic results for
solar-like oscillators en masse, and a large number of massive stars are expected to be stud-
ied with BRITE-Constellation. The Gaia mission (http://www.rssd.esa.int/gaia) is expected to
provide accurate luminosity determinations for a vast number of asteroseismic targets, tightly
constraining the modeling.
It is therefore only appropriate to finish with a quote by Eyer and Mowlavi (2008): now is
the time to be an asteroseismologist!

Star Formation 5
245
Abstract:
Stars are one of the most important constituents of the Universe, and understanding
their formation is crucial to many areas of astrophysics. Stars form from dense molecular gas,
and they tend not to form in isolation. Stars often form in binary and multiple systems, and
these systems tend to form in clusters with –members. Stars also form with a wide range
of masses, from substellar brown dwarfs with masses <.M⊙to massive stars >100 M⊙, and
wherever stars form the distribution of their masses seems always to be the same. This chapter
will review our current understanding of star formation from cold gas to young star clusters.
Keywords: Initial mass function, Molecular clouds, Stars, Star formation, Star clusters

Introduction
How stars form is one of the big questions in modern astrophysics. Stars are, in many ways, the
fundamental (baryonic) components of the Universe. Most of the electromagnetic radiation
detected by our telescopes comes directly or indirectly from stars, they are the basic visible
components of galaxies, they are the crucibles in which heavy elements are produced, and they
are the hosts of planetary systems and even, in at least one case, life.
Understanding star formation requires us to understand gravity, turbulence, magnetic
fields, chemistry, thermodynamics, and radiative transfer processes, all acting together with
extremely complex interactions and interdependencies. The study of star formation involves
understanding physical processes that work on galactic kpc-scales, star clusterformation on pc-
scales, and star (and planet) formation on au- and stellar-scales, with mass ranges from whole
galaxies of >M⊙to Jupiter-sized planets of only −M⊙.
The enormous range of scales which need to be probed to understand star formation make
it extremely challenging. Only in recent years have computers become powerful enough to start
dealing with the problem of star formation, informed by observations which are now available
(often only from space) across the whole electromagnetic spectrum.
This chapter will not even attempt to cover much of the theory and observations of star
formation (entire books are not enough). Rather, it will give a general overview of some of the
more important processes and our understanding of them.
1.1 The Basic Model of Star Formation
The basic theory of star formation datesback to 1734 when EmanuelSwedenborg first proposed
the Nebula Hypothesis: that the Sun and the Solar System formed from a rotating cloud of gas
that collapses under gravity to form the Sun at the center and a disk around it from which the
planets formed. This model was expanded later in the eighteenth century by Immanuel Kant
and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Perhaps surprisingly, the basic idea of the nebula hypothesis is still
the basis of our understanding of star formation. Current thinking is that star formation can be
divided into several main stages.
Molecular cloud formation. A large (–M⊙) cloud of gas forms within the interstellar
medium. The high column and volume densities allow the cloud to cool, and remain cool, and
molecular hydrogen (and other molecules) to form.

Star Formation
Prestellarcore formation. The molecular cloud fragments into self-gravitating condensations
known as “clumps” and, on smaller scales, “cores.” “Prestellar cores” of roughly a solar mass are
the birth places of stars.
Embedded star formation. Prestellar cores collapse and form a protostar (actually, often a
binary or multiple system) surrounded by a disk of gas near their centers. Initially these pro-
tostars are large (AU-size) hydrostatically supported objects deeply embedded in the gas of
the core.
Pre-main sequence stars. Once most of the mass in the core is accreted onto the star(s), and
young stars on the pre-main sequence are observed to be surrounded by massive disks. These
disks may well be in the process of planet formation and fairly rapidly disappear. Eventually the
star will reach the main sequence and become a “normal” main sequence star.
Star clusters. A molecular cloud usually fragments into many cores, forming a star cluster
of between (arguably even just ten stars can comprise a “cluster”) and stars in only a few
pcin a few Myr.1 The extreme densities in star clusters result in frequent encounters between
stars and multiple systems which can destroy young multiple systems and disrupt circumstellar
(and planet forming) disks.
The end of star formation. Once one or more massive (>10 M⊙) stars form, the input of
energy from their UV radiation fields (and associated HII regions), stellar winds, and even-
tual supernovae will expel any gas that has not already formed stars. This prevents more star
formation and often results in the destruction of the star cluster.
These stages do not necessarily happen one after the other. Obviously stars cannot form
before a molecular cloud has formed, but prestellar cores and pre-main sequence stars are often
observed in the same cluster, while at the same time massive stars may have started to clear some
regions of the cluster of gas so stopping star formation while star formation is still occurring
in other regions (indeed, the removal of gas from one part of a cloud may well induce star
formation in another).
1.2 What Is a Star?
Before proceeding, it is useful to define what is meant by a “star.” Formally a star is defined as
an object that will, is, or has produced energy through hydrogen fusion in its core. This is any
object with a mass in excess of the hydrogen-burning limit of ∼0.08 M⊙. For the purposes of this
chapter, the “will” in this definition is crucial as many of the young objects that are discussed
are far from reaching the main sequence and beginning core hydrogen burning.
A brown dwarf is an object too small to fuse hydrogen, but large enough to undergo
a short-lived deuterium-burning phase (which produces very little energy as deuterium is
very rare). Brown dwarfs span the mass range between −M⊙(about ten Jupiter masses) to
∼0.08 M⊙. Planets are therefore objects with masses<−M⊙, but this chapterwill be generally
unconcerned with planets and objects of even lower mass.
While this formal distinction between stars and brown dwarfs exists, throughout this chap-
ter we will generally assume that brown dwarfs and stars are fundamentally the same type of
object. Star formation should have no reason to draw a distinction between brown dwarfs and
1The difference between a massive star cluster and a small dwarf galaxy is that a star cluster forms all of its
stars at roughly the same time with roughly the same metallicity (a “simple stellar population”), while a dwarf
galaxy has many episodes of star formation over many Gyr.

stars. Only the most massive objects in young star forming regions have yet fused hydrogen
to generate energy (even if they eventually will), and the physics of star formation should find
nothing special about the hydrogen-burning limit. Therefore every statement about the forma-
tion of low-mass stars (especially very low-mass stars) should also apply to the formation of
brown dwarfs.
The most massive stars that are forming now have masses of –M⊙. It is difficult to
estimate the masses of the most massive stars as young, massive stars are deeply embedded in
gas. By the time the most massive stars are easily observable, after 1–2 Myr, they have evolved
significantly and may have lost >50% of their initial mass.
1.3 Open Questions
There are a number of critical open questions in star formation:
Thenatureof molecular clouds. Stars tend toform in massive gas and dust clouds with sizes
of 10s pc and masses up to M⊙. These clouds appear to contain high levels of turbulence
which drives and controls star formation. What is the source of their turbulence and what is the
lifetime of molecular clouds?
The origin of the initial mass function (IMF). Observations suggest that stars form with
the same distribution of masses everywhere. There are very few brown dwarfs, and very few
very high-mass stars. Most stars (90%) are M-dwarfs with masses in the range .–.M⊙.
Interestingly, and strangely, the IMF appears almost universal – observations of star forming
regions show that their IMF always seems to be approximately the same. Why is it universal?
And why is the typical mass always around .M⊙?
The origin of multiple systems. Many (possibly most) stars do not form as single, isolated,
objects, but in multiple systems with two or more members. The distribution of separations
between members of multiple systems is extremely wide, with some companions almost touch-
ing, while others have orbits of millions of years. Why do stars form in multiple systems? And
how do they produce such a wide range of separations between companions?
Is star formation universal? Do stars everywhere form in the same way? Star clusters range
in mass from to M⊙. Do more massive clusters just form more stars, or is there a fun-
damental difference in how they form stars? Do some regions form more or different binaries
to other regions, or is it always the same?
There are many good reviews of, and introductions to, star formation, in particular: the Pro-
tostars and Planets V volume from 2007, and many articles from Annual Reviews of Astronomy
& Astrophysics (especially recently McKee and Ostriker 2007, and Zinnecker and Yorke 2007),
as well as the textbook The Formation of Stars by Stahler and Palla from 2005.

From Gas to Stars
Stars form from the gravitational fragmentation of cold gas. In the early Universe there were
no stars; as the Universe cooled and the first dark matter halos formed, gas was able to collapse
and cool in these halos. The formation of the first stars in a zero metallicity environment was
probably very different to the formation of stars today, and they were probably very massive,
short-lived stars (this is beyond our remit, but see Stacy et al. 2011 and references therein).

248 5
Star Formation
The introduction of metals to the interstellar medium (ISM) by the first generation of stars
created dust and massively increased the efficiency of cooling, and later generations of stars
were able to form in much the same way that stars currently form.
2.1 Star Forming Regions
Stars usually form in large complexes. In >Fig. 5-1 we see the Carina Nebula, a massive star
forming complex. The image is about 20 pc across and illustrates almost every feature of star
formation. One of the most obvious features is the complex and filamentary nature of the gas
throughout the region. This is due to a combination of supersonic turbulence in the gas and
the feedback of energy from the most massive stars. Stars are forming throughout the region
including many very massive stars. η Carina is a ∼100 M⊙star found at the far left as a bright
blob just to the left of the Keyhole Nebula.2 To the middle right is the star cluster Trumpler
14, while to the far left is the cluster Trumpler 16 (less easily visible but containing η Carinae)
which are only a few Myr old. Along the bottom is a molecular ridge with very obvious dust
pillars carved by the feedback from massive stars in Trumpler 14.
The Carina Nebula is a particularly extreme star forming region forming some M⊙of
stars in several clusters. Many stars also form in midrange clusters such as the Orion Nebula
Cluster (the fuzzy blob in Orion’s sword) with massesof M⊙, and manyin very small clusters
with only around members such as the Taurus star forming region. As is described later,
each of these types of star cluster contribute roughly the same mass of stars to the general field
population of galaxies.

2.2 Molecular Clouds
The most abundant element in the Universe is hydrogen. Hydrogen is most often found in one
of three forms: ionized (HII), atomic (HI), and molecular (H). The interstellar medium (ISM)
can be broadly divided into three phases: the hot ISM with temperatures >K which contains
mainly HII, the warm ISM with temperatures between about and K containing HI, and
the cold ISM at <K containing mainly H.
Stars form in the cold phase in clouds of gas and dust known as molecular clouds (MCs).
Most molecular gas is found in Giant Molecular Clouds which typically have sizes of 10–100 pc,
and masses of –M⊙, but some molecular gas is found in smaller clouds known as Bok
Globules. MCs have high column densities, shielding them from the interstellar radiation field
and cosmic rays. This means that their temperatures can become very low (only 10s K) which
means that they can form molecular hydrogen and many other molecular species.
2.2.1 Observations of MCs
Clouds of molecular hydrogen are unfortunately remarkably hard to observe. In the optical they
are only observable as “dark clouds” as MCs can have tens of magnitudes of optical extinction
meaning it is impossible to see their contents or anything behind them (which is how they were
first discovered). Observations in the IR are able to see embedded (proto)stars within MCs, but
not the MCs themselves.
Obviously it would be extremely useful to observe the structure and kinematics of the gas
within MCs. But molecular hydrogen in MCs is most often unobservable: at the low (10s K)
temperatures of MCs Hhas no easily excited states. The only possible way of observing cold
Hdirectly is to use UV absorption along the line of sight from a massive star, unfortunately
there are very few of these lines of sight available, and almost never where you would like them
to be. Therefore “tracers” must be used: other molecules or dust in the MC which are assumed
to trace the underlying Hdistribution.
For a far fuller description of the physics and techniques of MC observations see Evans
(1999) and early chapters of Stahler and Palla (2005).
2.2.2 Molecular Tracers
Even though His not excited at low temperatures, many other molecular species are, and
these are observable at radio (and mm) wavelengths. Molecular lines can be extremely use-
ful as line ratios can provide information on the local (kinetic) temperature, and line widths
provide information on bulk flows and nonthermal motions.
The emission of a particular line from a molecule depends on both the temperature and
volume density (i.e., collision rate). However, the strength of the emission also depends on the
column density of material.
Probably the most common tracer is CO which has a number of easily excitable lines at low
temperature in the radio. CO is destroyed at low column densities by UV radiation and cosmic
rays and so it can only exist in high (column) density environments such as MCs, and the CO
column density is assumed to trace the Hcolumn density, therefore allowing CO to be used to
map H. Due to its relatively high abundance CO lines can saturate at high column densities.

250 5
Star Formation
In such situations isonomers of CO can be used (such as CO) which are less abundant and
so do not saturate. However, CO freezes-out onto dust grains at very low temperatures (<K),
forming an ice mantle around the dust grain.
Other molecules are used to trace regions of high volume density, for example, CS, HCN,
NH, and many others. Different molecules (and lines) can be used to trace regions of different
density. NHis a particularly common tracer for densities of ∼cm−, while HCN traces vol-
ume densities of –cm−. Line profiles can also be used to detect signatures of outflows
and infall; however, the details of using and interpreting molecular tracers are quite complex
and involved and the reader is referred to Evans (1999) for more information.
The power of using several molecular tracers in tandem is that the general column density
structure of molecular clouds can be mapped (usually in CO), and regions of high volume den-
sity can be located using other tracers. In addition, the thermal and kinetic properties of the gas
can be determined.
2.2.3 Dust as a Tracer
MCs contain significant quantities of dust (estimated to be roughly 1% of their mass). Unlike
molecular tracers, dust does not emit line radiation, rather dust particles are large enough to
emit a thermal continuum. The dust has the same kinetic temperatureas the surrounding gas as
collisions with gas particles are able to keep the dust and gas in thermal balance. At the typical
temperatures of MCs of 10–100 K the peak thermal emission from dust lies in the sub-mm at
wavelengths of hundreds to tens of microns.
Thus the total sub-mm flux in a region provides a measure of the column density of dust
(which is converted into a gas column density using a gas-to-dust ratio that is usually taken to
be 100-to-1), and the spectral energy distribution provides the gas (kinetic) temperature.
Unfortunately from the ground there are only a few atmospheric windows in the sub-mm,
most notably at 450 and 850 μm, and so the whole sub-mm is not available (obviously this
is not a problem from space and the Herschel mission is able to observe the whole of the
sub-mm).
2.2.4 The Appearance of Star Forming Regions
In >Fig. 5-2 the gas and young stellar distribution in the Taurus star forming region is shown.
The left panel from Kirk et al. (2005) shows the CO emission contours mapping the underly-
ing Hdistribution, while the color table shows the dust temperatures from dust continuum
observations, from about 10 K for dark blue, to 200–300 K for yellow/red (e.g., at the top left).
The black points show the positions of prestellar cores that are thought to be just about to form
stars.
The right panel from Parker et al. (2011) shows the positions of the young stars in Taurus.
Blue circles show the positions ofbrown dwarfs and verylow-mass stars, red points the positions
of stars >1 M⊙, and the black points the positions of intermediate-mass stars.
There are several things to note about these figures which will become important in our
discussions below. Firstly, the gas is not distributed evenly, it is clumpy and substructured with
regions of very low density and filamentary structure in the gas. Secondly, prestellar cores –
the sites of new star formation – are distributed in a similar way to the gas, generally forming

where the gas is densest. Thirdly, young stars also follow the gas distribution, but less closely as
they have had some chance to disperse from their formation sites, or for gas to clear from their
formation sites.
That cores, and therefore stars, form where the gas is densest should not be a surprise. If the
gas is substructured, then the initial stellar distributions in clusters will also be substructured.
However, substructure does not remain for long. Most young clusters appear relatively smooth
and circular which suggests that some process occurs very rapidly to remove the memory of the
initial distribution of the stars/gas.
2.2.5 The Structure and Kinematics of MCs
Almost every MC is observed to have a large degree of internal density and kinematic struc-
ture down to the resolution limits of the observations. All MCs appear similar to Taurus
(see >Fig. 5-2) with clumps and filaments on all scales (Williams et al. 2000).
Often the structure in MCs is divided into “clouds,” “clumps,” and “cores”:
Clouds are the largest structures representing the whole molecular cloud with typical sizes
of pcs, masses of –M⊙, and densities of ∼100 cm−.
Clumps are denser regions within clouds which are associated with star cluster forma-
tion. They have sizes of around a pc, masses of a few hundred M⊙, and typical densities of
–cm−.
Cores are the sites ofstarformation in single ormultiple systems with sizes of<.pc, masses
of around a M⊙, and densities of >cm−.
It should be noted that most of the mass in MCs is at relatively low density, clumps and cores
only makeup a few percent of the total mass of a MC. The distinctions between clouds, clumps,
and cores are rather arbitrary, and in many ways the structure in MCs appears scale-free which
has led to suggestions that the structure of MCs is fractal (e.g., Elmegreen 2002).
This of course raises the question as to why MCs have such complex (fractal even?)
structure? The answer is probably that MC structure is created and maintained by turbulence.
Observations of molecular line widths are a probe of the velocity dispersions of MCs. Line
ratios show that the kinetic temperatures of MCs are fairly uniform, and very low, with typ-
ical temperatures throughout a MC of <K, down to only 10–20 K. However, line widths
show significant supersonic motions in MCs. At 10–20 K, the sound speed of the gas is around
0.2 km s−; however velocity dispersions of many km s−are not unusual in MCs.
Larson (1981) found that the velocity dispersions of clouds as measured from the line widths
σ are proportional to the size of the region observed L
σ ∝Lβ
where β ∼.. Thus the larger the region that is observed, the larger the velocity dispersion.
This relationship has been ascribed to turbulence, which has become a major factor in modern
theories of star formation.
Turbulence is a rather complex subject with a huge literature on both terrestrial and astro-
physical turbulence. Turbulence is a process by which energy on one scale can be transferred
to smaller scales through a series of “eddies” where an eddy is a local vorticity.3 Turbulence
proceeds through a “cascade” where energy on large scales can be transferred to smaller scales,
3Energy is transferred through vortex stretching in which local velocity gradients can amplify the vorticity.

Star Formation 5
253
and then to smaller scales still through eddies. Eddies are not isolated, larger eddies will contain
smaller eddies, which can contain still smaller eddies.
Importantly, turbulence is a dissipative process. Energy is transferred from the largest scale
downward and eventually the scale will be such that the energy is able to dissipate. At the
smallest scales, turbulence will dissipate due to molecular viscosity, although in astrophysical
turbulence the scale on which self-gravity dominates adds a somewhat larger scale on which
the behavior of turbulence changes.
In supersonic turbulence energy is also dissipated by shocks. Supersonic collisions cause
shocks which are discontinuities in the gas properties, usually seen as a strong density jump
across the shock. The strong enhancement of density in shocks provides the initial conditions
for self-gravitating fragments to form which will eventually become stars.
Turbulence can be described by examining the relationship between the wavenumber
(scale−) κ of the turbulence, and the energy contained on that scale E(κ)
E(κ) ∝κn
where n measures the spectrum of the turbulence. For pressureless turbulence, the turbulence
is expected to have the Kolmogorov–Burgers spectrum of n = .(Boldyrev 2002).
It is hopefully obvious that if there is more energy on larger scales, the observed velocity
dispersion would increase with the size of the region observed as seen by Larson (1981). Indeed,
the linewidth-size relation with β ∼.that is observed in MCs is what would be expected from
a Kolmogorov–Burgers spectrum (McKee and Ostriker 2007).
2.2.6 The Formation of Cores in Molecular Clouds
In shocks and clumps the increased density can form gravitationally bound prestellar cores.
Prestellar cores are the basic unit of star formation as they will each produce an individual stellar
system (a single star, or often a binary or multiple system) typically with a size of <, AU.
Prestellar cores may form in relative isolation (such as Bok Globules), or in their hundreds of
thousands to make massive clusters.
An object will collapse if its mass exceeds the local Jeans mass. The Jeans mass MJ is given
by
MJ = π

c
s
G/ρ/
(5.1)
where cs is the sound speed of the gas, ρ is its density, and G is the gravitational constant. For
a typical molecular cloud with a temperature of around 10 K the sound speed is ∼0.2 km s−,
and the typical number density in a clump is n = –cm−and so the Jeans mass can be
rewritten in more useful units as
MJ ∼(M⊙) (
cs
.km s−)

(
n
cm−)
−/
Therefore the Jeans mass in a typical molecular clump in a cloud is roughly a solar mass. This
is remarkably close to the mean mass of a star of ∼0.4 M⊙.
A prestellar core can be created if around M⊙of gas can be compressed to n
>
cm−which shocks from supersonic turbulence can easily manage. It should be noted for
later that to make a core of .M⊙the density needs to be roughly 100 times greater, and that
cores of M⊙will typically contain 100 Jeans masses of material.

2.2.7 The Formation of Molecular Clouds
The mechanism by which MCs form is unclear. Opinion is split on whether MCs are long-lived
and virialized (Mouschovias et al. 2006; Tan et al. 2006) or transient, nonequilibrium struc-
tures (Ballesteros-Paredes 2006; Elmegreen 2000). This has important consequences as to the
timescale of star formation: Is it long-lived and quasi-static, or rapid and dynamic? The fun-
damental question is whether star formation occurs on only one or two crossing times (rapid)
or many crossing times (quasi-static). (See also reviews by Mac Low and Klessen 2004, and
Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007).
Because turbulence is dissipative (see above), it does not last forever. Turbulence will decay
on roughly the crossing time of the system, where the crossing time, tcross, of the system is
tcross ∼L/cs.
where cs is the (kinetic) sound speed, typically ∼0.2 km s−.
Therefore if supersonic turbulence is observed it means that either (a) the MC is less than a
few crossing times old, or (b) the turbulence is being “driven” (i.e., energy is being added to the
MC) to maintain it. Which of these is occurring is unclear, and the timescale of star formation
is somewhere between one and ten crossing times (roughly between 1 and 10 Myr for a typical
pc-scale clump).
An obvious way to determine the timescale of star formation is to measure the age-spread
of stars within a cluster. However, this is extremely problematic. For example, Palla et al. (2005)
claim a 10 Myr age-spread amongst stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Given that the Orion
Nebula Cluster is only about 1 pc in size with a crossing time of around 1 Myr this would seem
to argue for quasi-static star formation. However, Burningham et al. (2005) and Mayne and
Naylor (2008) show that at least some (but possibly not all) of the age-spread may be accounted
for by binarity, variability, and photometric errors. Rather worryingly, Naylor (2009) suggests
that the ages of young clusters have been under-estimated by a factor of 2 due to uncertainties
in PMS tracks.
Another clue might be from the formation mechanism of MCs. If the initial conditions of
MCs are known, then how star formation will then proceed in the cloud may become clearer.
Unfortunately, the formation mechanism(s) of MCs are unknown. It is thought that dense
molecular gas forms when the warm neutral medium that makes up the majority of the volume
of a galaxy is compressed or overrun by a shock; however, many possible mechanisms for this
exist and there is little agreement on which are most important (see, e.g., Vázquez-Semadeni
et al. 2007 and references therein).
2.3 Low-Mass Star Formation
Once a bound prestellar core has formed within a MC it will collapse to form a star or stars.
Before proceeding it is useful to define the two classes of young stars: protostars and pre-
main sequence (PMS) stars. Usually “protostar” is used for very young stars before they have
collapsed to stellar densities when they have radii of order 1 AU. A “PMS star” is a star that has
collapsed to stellar densities but has not yet started to produce energy through hydrogen fusion
at its center.

2.3.1 The Physics of Core Collapse
As described above, star formation typically begins with a prestellar core of mass ∼1 M⊙at a
temperature of ∼10 K. Initially, the Hin the core loses energy by being in thermal balance with
the dust. Impacts with dust grains transfers thermal energy from the gas to the dust which is
then able to radiate that energy away as a blackbody. At the typical densities of a prestellar core
of ∼−g cm−the core is optically thin to this radiation with a peak wavelength of ∼μm
and the core temperature remains constant.
As the core collapses it is initially able to retain this thermal balance and the dust is able
to radiate away the kinetic energy released by the collapse and so the temperature remains
at ∼10 K and the collapse is isothermal.
At a critical density of ρcrit ∼−g cm−the combination of accelerating release of grav-
itational energy and the increasing column density of the gas mean that it is no longer able
to radiate away the heat of the collapse efficiently. At this point the core begins to increase in
temperature and the collapse becomes adiabatic, and it is around this point that the first proto-
star(s) will form. Protostars initially have a size of order 1 AU and remain at this size for some
time as they are only able to radiate on a Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale. This situation continues
as protostars accrete more material and increase in temperature.
The thermal behavior of gas in a core can be simply described by a barytropic equation of
state of the form

where P is the pressure, ρ the density, cs is the general isothermal sound speed, and c∼

for a monotomic gas, and /for a diatomic gas. >Figure 5-3 shows the temperature–density

Star Formation
A consequence of this thermal behavior is that the Jeans mass of the core changes in an
unusual way. A core is supported against collapse by thermal energy (cs), and encouraged to
collapse by its mass/density (ρ). The effect of the thermal behavior of the core is to lower the
Jeans mass during isothermal collapse (ρ increases while cs remains constant), before increas-
ing it during adiabatic collapse (as the c
s term dominates over ρ−/). This means that there is a
minimum Jeans mass during core collapse that is reached at a density of around −g cm−of
around −M⊙(roughly ten Jupiter masses). > Figure 5-4 shows the behavior of the Jeans
mass with density for barytropic equation of state with γ = /and /. The Jeans mass
has a lower minimum when γ = /as the temperature rises more slowly with density. The
minimum Jeans mass that is reached during core collapse is known as the opacity limit for
fragmentation and is the minimum mass that any object can have if it forms by gravitational
fragmentation.
Note that there is another minimum during the second collapse as molecular hydrogen
dissociates which is potentially lower; however, it is unclear if fragmentation can occur during
this phase, and it would onlyproduce objects within 1 AU ofeach other. It could possiblyexplain
some close binaries.
This situation continues until the temperature of the protostar reaches ∼2,000 K at which
point enough energy is available to dissociate molecular hydrogen. This dissociation provides a
heat sink for the protostar and it rapidly (and almost isothermally) collapses to stellar densities
(approaching g cm−).
After all of the molecular hydrogen has been dissociated, the (PMS) star then slowly con-
tracts again until the central density and temperature are high enough to start hydrogen fusion
and the star joins the main sequence.
It is an interesting coincidence that the opacity limit for fragmentation of ∼−M⊙is also
the point at which the planet-brown dwarf distinction is drawn. The planet-brown dwarf limit
is usually taken to be the deuterium burning limit; however, the opacity limit for fragmentation
might provide a far more physical distinction between planets and brown dwarfs – planets
form by core accretion, while brown dwarfs form by gravitational fragmentation. The lack of

masses, and the difficulty of creating a brown dwarf right at the lower limit of gravitational

2.3.2 The Stages of Star Formation
The evolution of a star forming core and then a young star is divided into four stages
(classes). >Figure 5-5 illustrates schematically how the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a
low-mass core and/or star evolves during star formation (from Lada 1999).

Star Formation
Class 0. The very earliest stage of star formation is the almost free-fall collapse of the prestellar
core and the formation of a class 0 object. In this stage the center of the core forms a protostar,
but the majority of the mass of the core is still in the envelope. As the protostar is still heavily
embedded in its natal envelope, it is optically invisible and is usually only seen as an IR point
source. The emission from a class 0 core is a blackbody from to cold (few 10s K) dust with a
peak in the sub-mm at around 100 μ due to the low gas temperature.
During the class 0 phase jets and outflows may also be visible. The protostar will have a
strong magnetic field that is able to launch a small amount of material at high velocities along
open magnetic field lines. This creates strong bipolar outflows which may be visible in a class
0 source. (The details of jet formation are extremely complex and well beyond the remit of this
chapter, see the chapter on PMS stars for details).
The lifetime of the class 0 phase is extremely short as it occurs on roughly a free-fall time of
the prestellar core which is <years.
Class I. The embedded protostar continues to accrete material from the envelope and also
develop a massive disk. At the same time the protostar is heating the surrounding envelope
by radiating the gravitational potential energy released by the collapse as well as potentially
very significant energy input from increasingly prominent jets and outflows.
Once around half of the initial core mass has been accreted onto the protostar (and its mas-
sive disk) it enters the class I phase. Observationally the start of the class I phase is when the
temperature of the envelope reaches 70 K as the protostar is still embedded and optically invisi-
ble. In the second panel of >Fig. 5-5, the dashed line at the bottom right shows the contribution
of radiation directly from the star to the SED, but most of the radiation is reprocessed by the
envelope with a peak at a few tens of microns.
The class I phase lasts a few ×years, maybe years, and usually it is at some point in
the class I phase that the protostar collapses down to become a PMS star (this depends on the
protostellar mass).
Class II/Classical T Tauri. By the end of the class I phase the bulk of the envelope has been
accreted onto the (now) PMS star and its disk. The class II phase is now optically visible and
is commonly known as a Classical T Tauri star (CTTs, named after the first object of its type
T Tauri in the Taurus star forming region). As can be seen in the third panel of > Fig. 5-5,
the dominant contributor to the SED is radiation directly from the (PMS) stellar photosphere.
However, CTT stars show evidence for their disks through an IR excess where radiation from
the star is reprocessed by the cool disk and reradiated creating an excess of long wavelength
radiation as seen in >Fig. 5-5. As CTT stars continue to accrete material from the disk onto
the star they show strong Hα and X-ray emission as that material collides with the surface
of the star in an accretion shock. CTT stars also have strong jets and magnetically driven
outflows.
The class II/CTT phase lasts for a few ×years until the disk is largely depleted (by a
combination of accretion onto the star, planet formation, and evaporation by stellar radiation).
Class III/Weak-Lined T Tauri. Once the disk is depleted of gas the strong signatures of accre-
tion and outflow that characterize the CTT phase also disappear. In the weak-lined T Tauri
(WLTT) phase only very weak spectral signatures and a slight IR excess from the disk remain.
This phase is observationally difficult to distinguish from a main sequence star except that the
star is rather over-luminous for its color as it has a larger radius than a main sequence star of
the same mass as it is still contracting. During this phase the rest of the disk dissipates (leav-
ing only a debris disk in some cases). Depending on the mass of the star this phase can take a
few ×years.

2.3.3 Diﬀerent Types of Young Stars
The most common type of PMS star is a (classical or weak-lined) T Tauri star which is a typical
PMS phase of stars <M⊙, that is, the typical PMS phase of well over 90% of stars. But there
are other classes of PMS stars.
Some <M⊙stars are classed as FU Orionis stars which are variable, with outbursts leading
to increases of up to six magnitudes in a few months. Such stars are thought to be a subclass
of T Tauri stars in which the accretion rate onto the star increases hugely. Typical T Tauri stars
have accretion rates of −M⊙year−, while FU Orionis stars are estimated to be as high as
−M⊙year−. With such high accretion rates FU Orionis stars cannot last very long (as a
.M⊙disk would be depleted in only years). It may be that many T Tauri stars undergo a
very short-lived FU Orionis phase at some point in their lives, or that very few do, but that they
last longer and they rapidly deplete their disks.
The PMS phase of stars of 2–8 M⊙are known as Herbig Ae/Be stars. They share most of
the properties of T Tauri stars: IR excess (disks), Balmer emission, X-ray emission, and often
variability.
The PMS phases of stars more massive than about 8 M⊙are not observed as such massive
stars are able to reach the main sequence while still in the deeply embedded (class 0/I) phase.
The formation of massive stars will be discussed in more detail later.
2.4 The Initial Mass Function
The initial mass function (IMF) is the distribution function of individual stellar masses at birth.
There are many ways of parameterizing the IMF, probably the most popular (certainly the-
oretically) is the Kroupa (2002) three-part power-law illustrated in >Fig. 5-6 which has the
form
N(M) ∝
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩
M−α
m< M/M⊙< m,
M−α
m< M/M⊙< m,
M−α
m< M/M⊙< m,
This parameterization usually divides the IMF into three regions.
Firstly, a low-mass (substellar) regime between .and .or .M⊙with declining
numbers of stars with mass with a slope of α= ..
Secondly, a roughly flat intermediate-mass region which covers M-dwarfs and the bulk of
stars by a number between around .and .M⊙with a slope of α= ..
Thirdly, a high-mass regime in which the numbers of stars by mass decline with a slope of
α= ., also known as the Salpeter slope after the first determination of the IMF by Salpeter
(1955).
It should be noted that recently Chabrier (2003) has proposed a log-normal-like parame-
terization which is becoming increasingly popular as well.
The number of stars by mass drops rapidly (seemingly as a power-law), and extremely
high-mass stars >10 M⊙which become core collapse supernovae are very rare. Below
∼0.08 M⊙objects are too small to burn hydrogen in their cores (brown dwarfs). While brown
dwarfs are relatively numerous (one for every five or six stars), there is again a rapid decline in
their numbers with decreasing mass, and they only contribute negligibly to the total mass in
stars.

Salpeter 1955 slope) when M > 0.5 M⊙
Before proceeding it is worth emphasizing two points about the IMF.
Firstly, the IMF is the initial mass function which is the mass function that stars have at birth.
Stellar evolution (such as the supernovae of the most massive stars) will remove massive stars
over time, and dynamical evolution will tend to eject low-mass stars from star clusters. Both
of these processes turn the IMF into a present day mass function (PDMF) which may be very
different from the original IMF. But different PDMFs do not necessarily mean different IMFs.
For example, old globular clusters and very young star clusters have very different mass
functions (e.g., old globulars completely lack stars larger than ∼1 M⊙due to stellar evolution).
In old globulars observations are of a population that has had 12 Gyr of stellar and dynamical
evolution, while in very young clusters an unevolved IMF is seen. But simulations of the evolu-
tion of globular clusters suggest that to have the PDMF that is observed today, they must have
started with an IMF very similar to that of very young star clusters (Vesperini and Heggie 1997).
Secondly, the IMF is the mass function of individual stars. Many stars form in binary and
multiple systems and the construction of a true IMF involves correcting for these multiple sys-
tems. A G-dwarf-M-dwarf binary should contribute a single G-dwarf and a single M-dwarf to
the IMF. In practice this is often impossible to achieve as many multiple systems may not be
known to be multiple systems (especially if the companions are of low-mass and relatively close
to the primary star) and so cannot be included as two systems. Therefore what is often presented
as an IMF is often a primary star IMF (i.e., many companions are missed), or a system IMF (i.e.,
companion masses are merged with the primary mass).
These problems notwithstanding, the IMF is an extremely useful tool for examining star
formation.
The form of the IMF suggests that the vast majority (90%) of stars are M-dwarfs, with the
mean mass of a star being ∼0.4 M⊙, and the median mass of a star being .–.M⊙.
Surprisingly, the IMF seems to be remarkably universal. Wherever we observe the same
basic form to the IMF is seen – few brown dwarfs, a peak at .–.M⊙, and a decline to higher
masses with a slope of roughly .(Salpeter). Kroupa (2002) compiled a large database of IMF

Star Formation 5
261
(and PDMF) determinations for clusters and regions in the Milky Way and LMC of different
ages and metallicities and found no significant variations from a “standard” IMF. More recently
Bastian et al. (2010) have examined many claims for nonstandard IMFs and found no strong
evidence forsignificant deviations from a universal IMF (often while a different IMF can explain
unusual observations, many other more reasonable explanations can be found such as different
extinction laws).
2.4.1 The Origin of the IMF
There is no a priori reason why stars forming in M⊙proto-globular clusters with metallicities
of only −solar should have the same IMF as stars forming in M⊙loose associations with
solar metallicity. Indeed, it might be expected that the IMFs should be different, the physics of
star formation appear to depend on the thermodynamics of the gas and the opacity limit for
fragmentation which should depend on metallicity and density. So what is the origin of the
IMF and why is it apparently universal? For more details the reader is directed to Bonnell et al.
(2007) and Bastian et al. (2010).
2.4.2 The IMF from Cores
Stars are seen to form in dense molecular cores. Presumably the mass of the core and the massof
the star (or stars) that form in them is related to the mass of the core; therefore, the distribution
of stellar masses could well be related to the distribution of core masses. In such a scenario, the
universality of the IMF may well just reflect the universality of the core mass function (CMF).
This picture is supported by observations of the CMF in different regions where the CMF
is seen to have an IMF-like shape. In >Fig. 5-7 the log-normal-like CMF in the Orion B region
is shown (as observed by Nutter and Ward-Thompson 2007) compared to a standard Kroupa
IMF which has been shifted in mass by a factor of 8 (Alves et al. 2007 find a very similar result
in the Pipe nebula). Quite clearly the shapes of the two mass functions are very similar, with
the CMF just shifted in mass relative to the IMF. This shift might be reflecting that each core
does not just produce one star, and that not all of the mass in the core ends-up on a star (due
to feedback from jets and outflows). Therefore it might seem reasonable to conclude that each
core forms two or three stars with only around 50% of the mass in the core eventually being
accreted by the stars and so the form of the IMF is just set by the form of the CMF (Goodwin
et al. 2008).
In many ways this may seem to be just shifting the question of the origin and universality of
the IMF back one stage to the question of the origin and universality of the CMF. However, it is
probably far less surprising that the CMF is universal as its origin lies in the nature of turbulence
in MCs.
As described earlier, MCs are dominated by supersonic turbulence with apparently a uni-
versal power spectrum. Dense cores are formed in colliding/converging regions within MCs
and the mass spectrum of cores will depend on the power spectrum of the turbulence and
its strength. A core will collapse to form a star if it exceeds the local Jeans mass. The Jeans
mass in a MC is ∼1 M⊙at a density of about −g cm−, and so to form a prestellar core of
M⊙turbulence needs to compress M⊙of gas to a density of −g cm−– only a compres-
sion of a factor of about or above the average density in a MC. However, to make a

et al. 2008)
.M⊙prestellar core the compression required is an extra factor of . Much larger cores,
even though they require lower densities will be far larger in extent and expected to fragment
into smaller cores unless they start at relatively higher densities (i.e., very super-Jeans).
Therefore very low-mass cores are expected to be rare as they require very high compression
to reach the densities required for them to collapse, while cores of ∼1 M⊙should be typical, and
there should be few high-mass cores as they will fragment into smaller cores unless significantly
compressed. This is exactly the form seen in observed CMFs and in the IMF (see Hennebelle
and Chabrier 2008; Padoan and Nordlund 2002 for a far more detailed discussion of the cre-
ation of CMFs from turbulence). However, as is discussed later, the picture is far more complex
than this.
2.4.3 Competitive Accretion
Competitive accretion (Bonnell et al. 1997, 2001, 2007)is the main competitortocore formation
as the origin of the IMF. In competitive accretion stars form in cores which follow some CMF,
but it is not the initial mass of the core that is important in setting the final mass of the star.
Rather, cores, and later stars, continue to accrete gas as long as there is gas in the cluster to
accrete (i.e., before it is blown away by feedback from massive stars).
Thus there is no such thing as a “core mass” which sets the mass of stars which form within
it. The observed CMF is just the instantaneous amount of gas in dense condensations. Many of
these condensations will collapse and form a star following the classical class 0 through class III
evolutionary path. However, some stars will continue to accrete gas and continue to grow.
A key element of competitive accretion is that not all stars are equally successful in accret-
ing material. More massive stars will be more successful in accreting material due to their

Star Formation 5
263
larger gravitational influence, but more importantly some stars will just be “lucky” in that
they happen to be in regions where there is a lot of gas to accrete, while other stars will be
in “unlucky” regions. Thus what becomes a massive star has no need to start as a particularly
massive star. The protostar which forms the most massive star eventually can begin life in a
small core.
2.4.4 The CMF Verus Competitive Accretion
Given that CMFs are observed to have a form that is very similar to the IMF it might be thought
that this scenario is the most natural. However, there are a number of problems associated with
the CMF-to-IMF model.
Firstly, the peak and width of the CMF should depend strongly on the Mach number of
the turbulence. More energy in turbulence means stronger compression and a lower peak
and more low-mass cores. Therefore the IMF should depend on the Mach number (Hen-
nebelle and Chabrier 2008; Padoan and Nordlund 2002). MCs with Mach numbers ranging
between around 5 and 20 have been observed (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007), but the IMF is
universal.
Secondly, it is uncertain how the observed CMF is related to the final IMF. It is often not
clear which cores will collapse to form a star and which are transient density enhancements (i.e.,
which cores are really prestellar and which are not). In addition, cores of different massesevolve
at different rates, and so any snapshot observation of a CMF is not a snapshot of the full range
of cores that will eventually form stars (Clark et al. 2007). In addition, cores are often difficult
to identify, and different methods can find different cores and different CMFs in the same data
(Smith et al. 2008).
Indeed, it is not clear that the observed cores are the precursors of many stars. The typical
cores that are observed have a size of roughly .pc. However, most stars form in dense clusters
which contain (to take the example of the well-studied Orion Nebula Cluster) about stars
in a cubic pc. At such densities, the average distance between stars is the size of a core and so
the filling factor of cores in the proto–Orion Nebula Cluster must have been unity which seems
unlikely (Goodwin et al. 2007).
Thus the cores which form stars in dense clusters must have significantly smaller sizes, but
the same mass spectrum as the more isolated cores with which CMFs are constructed. There
is clearly an observational bias here, as the sizes of cores that can be observed are set by the
resolution limits of the instruments used to observe them. There are no dense proto-clusters
close enough to resolve many very small cores, and in more distant dense proto-clusters small
cores would be unresolved. Indeed, it is found that the typical core mass increases with distance
(resolution)which suggests that observers are unable toresolve smallerstructures in these larger
“cores.” It may be that all of the substructure cannot be resolved, even in nearby prestellar cores,
and that they may contain substructure below current resolution.
It is likely that both the CMF and competitive accretion play a role in star formation and
establishing the universal form of the IMF. Given the apparent link between the CMF and the
IMF in diffuse regions where competitive accretion is likely to be less effective, it would appear
that the CMF does largely set the form of the IMF. However, in dense environments it is difficult
to imagine that cores and protostars could avoid accreting at least some of the large amounts of
ambient gas around them.

2.5 The Formation of Massive Stars
The typical mass of a star of about .M⊙is probably set by the typical mass of a core of about
M⊙, which is itself probably determined by the Jeans mass in a MC. However, the origin of
stars significantly more massive than M⊙is very uncertain (see Zinnecker and Yorke 2007 for
a detailed review of massive star formation).
There is a major theoretical problem in forming stars in excess of ∼10 M⊙, despite observa-
tions of many stars that appear to have masses well in excess of M⊙, possibly up to M⊙.
As soon as a star reaches a mass of ∼10 M⊙its central temperature and pressure will be high
enough to begin core hydrogen burning. More massive stars evolve at a much faster rate than
low-mass stars, a star >40 M⊙will evolve through the main sequence and post-main sequence
to become a core collapse supernova in only a few Myr. And during their rapid evolution they
have extremely strong stellar winds and UV fluxes. The question is then, if a star of ∼10 M⊙is
producing strong winds and a strong ionizing UV field, how does more material accrete onto
the star to produce a star of , , or even M⊙?
It is extremely difficult to observe young massive stars as they are always deeply embedded,
and once theyreach the main sequence, theyproduce an HII region. Theirevolution can in some
ways be tracked through the properties of the HII regions. Initially, a massive star will produce
a hypercompact or ultracompact HII region which is less than .pc in size with densities of
cm−. As the HII region evolves it will increase in size and decrease in density toward a
classical HII region of pc-scale as the radius of its Strömgren sphere increases. Once a massive
star (or often stars) have ionized a large region, they begin to stop star formation locally. But
it is in the hyper- and ultracompact phases that massive star formation is occurring and it is
extremely difficult to observe the processes that are occurring.
In order to build a massive star accretion must overcome the force of radiative (UV) and
mechanical (winds) feedback. Massive stars can have luminosities of >L⊙and mass-loss
rates of >−M⊙year−which is a significant load to be overcome. By far the best way to do
this seems to be via a disk. Even if feedback from the star is initially isotropic the presence of
a disk means that it rapidly becomes anisotropic and escapes preferentially toward the poles
allowing accretion through the disk (see Zinnecker and Yorke 2007 for details).
If it is possible to overcome feedback (and it must be as very massive stars exist), the for-
mation of a massive star requires a large amount of gas to be available to accrete. There are two
theories as to the origin of this huge reservoir of gas.
Possibly most obviously given our discussion of the core mass function is that massive stars
form from massive cores (McKee and Tan 2003). Given the large amounts of feedback from
a massive star, the core mass presumably needs to be significantly greater than the mass of the
final star, and a M⊙star will need a ≫M⊙core from which to form. Such massive cores are
observed (as “clumps,” see above), but it is very unclear why a massive core should produce only
one or two stars. A M⊙core contains many Jeans masses of material, and might be expected
to form a small cluster rather than a single massive star. In addition, massive stars tend to be
found in groups near the centers of clusters. For example, the Trapezium in the Orion Nebula
Cluster contains four of the six most massive stars in the cluster in a region only around .pc
across. But massive cores are by definition large, and so are not expected to form in the centers
of clusters.
The alternative scenario for massive star formation is competitive accretion (see above).
Here there is no need to form a massive core, rather massive stars begin as “normal” mass
stars. A lucky few “normal” stars will sit in the deep potential where gas can be directed toward

Star Formation 5
265
them from which they can accrete. Thus they need no large initial reservoir of gas as the gas
is channeled toward them. This has the advantage of automatically producing massive stars
toward the centers of clusters where the potential is the deepest. However, it is not clear if a
constant infall of gas can be maintained through the feedback from the most massive stars. Gas
must accrete onto the massive star from a disk which can channel the feedback around it. If
the inflow of gas into the center of the cluster is low-density then it could well be disrupted by
feedback.
2.6 The Formation of Brown Dwarfs
At the other end of the mass spectrum from massive stars are very low-mass stars and brown
dwarfs, and, as with massive stars, theirformation is ratherdifficult toexplain. The most obvious
way in which brown dwarfs (and very low-mass stars, typically anything with a mass <.M⊙)
is in low-mass cores in a very similar way to stars. Young brown dwarfs appear very similar to
young stars (Whitworth et al. 2007), and so their formation mechanism might well be exactly
the same.
However, it may be difficult to form cores of a low enough mass to form brown dwarfs.
To become bound a .M⊙core must be times denser than a M⊙core (due to the ρ−/
dependency of the Jeans mass). This implies that very low-mass cores should only form where
there is a strong shock which is able to increase the local density significantly. In particular, it
implies that low-mass cores should form when the turbulence is strong (high Mach-number
turbulence), and not when it is relatively weak. A problem arises in that the substellar IMF
appears to be the same in all regions, even in low-density, relatively low-turbulence star forming
environments such as Taurus.
In addition, very few very low-mass cores are observed. But for every very low-mass core
which is able tobecome bound around should be formed which just fail toreach the required
densities and then disperse (Goodwin and Whitworth 2007). Therefore, huge numbers of very
low-mass cores should be observed and they are not.
An alternative is to form brown dwarfs in higher-mass cores which we know to exist in
significant numbers. However, the problem is that once an object has formed at around the
opacity limit for fragmentation of ∼−M⊙if there is a significant amount of gas present, then
it will accrete that gas (as happens in a “normal” star). Therefore some mechanism is required
to stop the object accreting and to keep it at brown dwarf masses.
The first suggestion toaccomplish this was the ejection scenario(Reipurth and Clarke 2001).
In this scenario several very low-mass objects form at roughly the same time in a core. Systems
with N > are generally unstable and will rapidly decay and will usually eject the lowest-
mass member of the system. Thus, brown dwarfs can be ejected from cores shortly after their
formation and once they have left the core they have no more gas available for them to accrete.
The problem with this model is that brown dwarfs are typically ejected with speeds of a
few km s−. This means that in a Myr an ejected brown dwarf could travel a few pc, and so
clustersshould have a halo of ejected brown dwarfs and the distribution of brown dwarfs should
be different to that of stars. However, brown dwarfs and stars appear to have the same spacial
distribution which suggests that violent ejection cannot be the answer (Luhman 2004).
Other possibilities have been suggested, such as forming brown dwarfs in massive extended
disks around solar-type stars which can then be gently liberated (Stamatellos et al. 2007),
or that brown dwarfs form as wide companions to M-dwarfs which are then disrupted

266 5
Star Formation
(Goodwin and Whitworth 2007). But every formation model has some problems, and the
formation mechanism of brown dwarfs remains uncertain (indeed, they may form from a
combination of all the processes that have been suggested).
2.7 Star Formation Eﬃciency
How much of its gas does a MC convert into stars? This may appear to be a simple question to
answer: simply observe the total mass of gas Mg in a MC and the total mass of stars M⋆, and
the star formation efficiency (SFE) is then SFE = M⋆/Mg. However, in practice this is rather
difficult to do.
In order to measure the total mass of gas in a MC, there must obviously be gas present. This
means that some (many? most?) of the stars will be embedded, either in their natal core or in
the general cloud making them difficult to observe, therefore it is often not clear if the observed
stellar mass is the total stellar mass.
That gas is still present means that star formation is ongoing. In particular more stars will
form increasing the stellar mass, and the masses of stars already present will increase. If com-
petitive accretion is occurring in the cluster the mass in stars could increase very significantly.
Therefore, even if the current mass in stars is known exactly, the SFE is an instantaneous value,
and not the final SFE (e.g., Evans et al. 2009). If more stars form from the same mass of gas
the SFE will increase, but if more gas is channeled into the region, by turbulent flows or along
filaments, for example, then the SFE could decrease.
Over whole galaxies the SFE (usually quoted as a star formation rate) can be calculated.
The gas content (HI + H) of entire external galaxies can be observed (usually through 21 cm +
CO). In addition, the massive star content of external galaxies can also be seen (either from HII
regions/H-α emission or naked O-stars) which, with an assumption of a standard IMF, gives
the mass of young stars in that galaxy. Interestingly, the SFE in Happears roughly constant in
spiral galaxies at a few % (Leroy et al. 2008).
The SFE is observed to decrease with increasing scale. In prestellar cores the SFE is probably
around 50% (Goodwin et al. 2008), in clumps 30–50% (Lada and Lada 2003), and in typical
spiral galaxies as a whole it is usually a few percent (Leroy et al. 2008). Thus the majority of gas
in a galaxy is not forming stars, and the majority of gas only ends up on a star when it reaches
prestellar core scales of <.pc.

Multiple Stars, Star Clusters, and the End of Star Formation
Stars do not form on their own. Many (possibly most) stars form as binary and multiple systems
in which each core produces two or more stars on scales of a few hundred AU. In addition, most
stellar systems (singles or multiples) form in star clusters of hundreds to millions of members
on scales of roughly a pc.
3.1 Binary and Multiple Systems
In the discussions previously it has tended to be implicitly assumedthat a single core produces a
single star. However, it is known that this simplification is certainly not always true, and maybe
wrong most of the time.

Star Formation 5

Observations of old main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood show that many stars
are in binary and multiple systems. The numbers of stars in binaries is usually quantified by the
binary fraction fbin
fbin =
B + T + Q + ...
S + B + T + Q + ...
(5.3)
where S, B, T, Q, etc., are the numbers of single, binary, triple, quadruple, etc., systems (a single
system has one star, a binary system contains two stars, etc.,). (There are numerous differ-
ent ways of quantifying the binary fraction, see Reipurth and Zinnecker 1993 for a detailed
description of many.)
For massive >5 M⊙stars the binary fraction in the field appears to be unity (i.e., all massive
stars are in a binary or multiple system). For solar-type stars the fraction appears to be ∼60%
(Duquennoy and Mayor 1991), falling to around % for M-dwarfs (Fischer and Marcy 1992;
see also Lada 2006), and % for brown dwarfs (Burgasser et al. 2007). It should be noted though
that these numbers are probably lower limits as it is generally very difficult to detect companions
with a significantly lower mass than the primary star.
It seems to be impossible to make binaries in the numbers seen by dynamically combin-
ing initially single stars (Kroupa and Burkert 2001) and so the vast majority of the binary
stars must have formed as binaries. In fact, the situation is even more extreme for young stars.
>Figure 5-8 shows the fraction of solar-type stars with companions at different separations for
the field (solid line), and for a selection of young stars in different regions compiled by Patience
et al. (2002). There are clearly far more binaries with separations of around 100 AU amongst
young stars than in the field. Indeed, the binary fraction of young solar-type stars appears to be
close to 100%.
This suggests that most stars, at least >1 M⊙(the situation is unclear for lower-mass stars),
form as binaries.

Star Formation
3.1.1 Binary Formation
If binary and multiple formation is an extremely common (possibly the major) mode of star for-
mation then it is important to ask how they form. It is thought that multiple systems form by the
fragmentation of circumstellar disks during the class 0 (possibly class I) phase of star formation.
Prestellar cores are observed to have at least some angular momentum (Goodman et al. 1993),
probably due to small (subsonic) levels of turbulence (Burkert and Bodenheimer 2000). Low
angular momentum material will form a central protostar, but high angular momentum mate-
rial will form a circumstellar disk around the protostar. If this disk is massive and cool enough
it will be able to fragment, forming a multiple system (see Goodwin et al. 2007 for details).
The Toomre (1964) criteria describes if a disk is unstable to gravitational fragmentation.
The Toomre Q-parameter at a radius R in a disk is given by
Q(R) = c(R) κ(R)
πG Σ(R)
where c is the isothermal sound speed, κ is the epicyclic frequency, and Σ is the surface density,
all at radius R. If Q < , a disk is unstable to gravitational fragmentation (the numerator is a
measure of thermal and rotational support against fragmentation, the denominator is a measure
of the gravitational attraction of a region).
However, in order to form a new protostar, an unstable fragment must be able to cool on a
dynamical timescale (otherwise the fragmentwill heat as it collapses and bounce); this is known
as the Gammie (2001) criterion. Therefore the cooling time tcool must be less than
tcool < γtorb
where torb is the orbital timescale at whatever radius R, and .< γ < is the adiabatic index
(see Stamatellos and Whitworth 2008 for details).
Whitworth and Stamatellos (2006) use reasonable values for disk parameters and find that
these conditions are only met if the radius is greater than a minimum radius Rmin
Rmin > ( M⋆
M⊙
)
/
AU
where M⋆is the mass of the star around which the disk is attempting to fragment. The depen-
dence of the fragmentation radius on the central stellar mass is due to the irradiation of the
disk by the central star. The more massive the central star, the higher its luminosity, and so the
greater the temperature of the disk.
Interestingly, this value of ∼150 AU is very close to the peak of the T Tauri binary separa-
tion distribution. However, it does suggest that binaries should not form within Rmin. However,
inspection of >Fig. 5-8 shows immediately that there are many binary systems with compan-
ions at distances <Rmin. The critical point is that companions should not form below Rmin, but
they may later move to smaller radii due to energy conservation during an ejection if there are
more than two bodies in the system (although this should not happen too much, Goodwin and
Kroupa 2005), or due to interactions with the disk analogous to planetary migration (e.g., Lin
and Papaloizou 1979).

3.1.2 Binary Destruction
Observations and theory both suggest that binaries are the major mode of star formation (at
least >0.5 M⊙, Goodwin and Kroupa 2005; Lada 2006). This raises the obvious question of why
there are fewer old binaries than young binaries. At some point many young binaries with sep-
arations of >100 AU must be destroyed in order to produce the old population that observed in
the solar neighborhood.
Binaries can be destroyed by dynamical interactions with single stars or other binaries. How
easy it is to destroy a binary depends on two factors: the strength of an encounter, and the
frequency of encounters which may destroy the binary (see Heggie 1975 and Hills 1975 for a
detailed analysis).
The potential of an encounter to destroy a binary depends on the binding energy E of a
binary which depends on the masses mand mof the components, and their separation a
E = −Gmm
a
and the energy of the perturbing star which will depend on its typical mass < m >, and its
typical velocity σ (which will be the velocity dispersion of the system). If ∣E∣/ < m > σ ≫the
binary is said to be “hard” and is difficult to disrupt, if ∣E∣/ < m > σ ≪the binary is “soft”
and easy to disrupt.
For a typical binary in a fairly typical cluster < m > = m= m= .M⊙, and σ = km s−.
This would place the hard-soft boundary at a separation of a ∼AU. Therefore encounters
would be expected to destroy binaries with separations ≫AU, and have no effect on binaries
with separations ≪50 AU. In the intermediate regime around AU encounters may or may
not destroy binaries (this regime can only be probed by numerical simulations).
However, the encounter rate also plays a crucial role in determining binary survival. The
velocity dispersion in the Galactic disk is ∼30 km s−which gives a hard-soft boundary of only
a few AU. But there are many binaries (in fact most) in the field with separations ≫–AU.
While these binaries are soft they are able to survive because the encounter rate in the field is
so low.
The rate R at which a star will have an encounter within a distance b depends on the number
density n and velocity dispersion σ of the environment
R ∼nσb(+ Ω)
where Ω is the Safranov number and is a measure of gravitational focusing which increases the
encounter rate. For the situations that are of interest here Ω is generally <1 and may be ignored.
For an encounter with an impact parameter of b = AU in the Galactic field with a
typical number density of star pc−and velocity dispersion of ∼30 km s−(∼30 pc Myr−), the
encounter rate is roughly once every 5.5 Gyr. However, in a cluster with star pc−and σ ∼
km s−, the encounter rate is once every 5.5 Myr. Therefore encounters that would be expected
to destroy binaries with separations greater than about AU are very rare in the field, but are
expected to have occurred in even very young star clusters.

Star Formation
3.2 Binaries or Singles?
That so many stars form in binaries shows that binary formation is a major mode of stars for-
mation. But is it the main mode of star formation? Most stars (around 90%) are M-dwarfs,
and the binary fraction of M-dwarfs is low. A binary fraction of only 40% suggests that most
M-dwarfs are single. However, the binary fraction is for systems. Of every 100 M-dwarf systems
40 are binary systems, and 60 are single. Of the 40 binary systems, each contains 2 M-dwarfs,
meaning that by number 80/140 M-dwarfs are in a binary system, and 60/140 are singles. This
now suggests that most M-dwarfs are in binary systems. However, the 40 binary systems pre-
sumably formed as binary systems and so only 40% of low-mass stars are known to form as
binaries, while 60% are currently singles. If all the single field M-dwarfs formed as singles this
tells us that single star formation is the major mode of star formation, but if many formed as
binaries which were later destroyed then binary formation is the major mode of star formation.
Sadly, observations of low-mass binary fractions in clusters cannot currently distinguish these
possibilities.
3.3 Star Clusters
Around 75–90% of stars form in clusters of hundreds to millions of stars (Lada and Lada 2003).
A particularly interesting observation is that the mass function of these star clusters appears to
be N(M) ∝M−(Lada 2010; Lada and Lada 2003). This is interesting because it means an
equal mass of stars forms in each equal logarithmic mass interval. Therefore there are as many
star forms in Taurus-like associations with mass ∼M⊙, as in Orion-like clusters with mass
∼M⊙, as in massive starburst clusters like Westerlund 1 with a mass of ∼M⊙. Therefore all
masses of clusters are equally important, and there is no such thing as an “average” or “typical”
star cluster.
Ourmental image ofstarclusters is set bypictures ofold globularclusters, which are remark-
ably spherical, smooth, and dynamically relaxed. This is not, however, how star clusters form.
MCs are complex, hierarchical structures, and they form stars in the same complex structures
(see >Fig. 5-2). Star clusters also appear to form highly out-of-equilibrium, with velocities well
below what would be expected for virial equilibrium (see Allison et al. 2009 and references
therein).
Any clumpy, out-of-equilibrium system will rapidly attempt to reach equilibrium and it
appears that star clusters rapidly collapse and smooth-out their initial clumpiness. This has two
important consequences when attempting to interpret observations of clusters.
Firstly, clusters change their appearance rapidly and can appear very different on timescales
of just years. While this is extremely rapid on astrophysical timescales, it is somewhatlonger
than the average baseline of our astronomical observations. Therefore only a single snapshot in
the evolution of a star cluster is observed. Two star clusters of different ages that appear very
different might well just be very similar objects at different points in their evolution. Equally,
two objects that appear very similar might be seen at different points in their evolution and will
result in very different objects. In addition, the evolution of star clusters occurs far faster than
our ability to accurately date star clusters (at best to about a Myr), so it is impossible to tell if
two young clusters are really the same or of significantly different ages.
Secondly, our observations beyond ∼100 pc are only two-dimensional projections of com-
plex, three-dimensional objects. A clumpy, hierarchical cluster can look very different from

Star Formation 5
271
different viewing angles. This should improve with the advent of GAIA which will provide accu-
rate distances to many objects (the brightest objects in the sky) and also proper motions to
give us detailed kinematic information. However, GAIA will not be able to observe the earli-
est embedded stages of star cluster formation and evolution during which much of the rapid
evolution occurs.
Clusters that are initially dynamically cool and clumpy will attempt to reach an equilibrium
which is virialized and smooth. Following Allison et al. (2009), if the initial virial ratio of a
cluster is Qi = −Ti/Ωi, where Ti is the initial kinetic energy and Ωi is the initial potential
energy (and Qi = .is virial equilibrium), then the total energy of a cluster is
E = Ti + Ωi = (−Qi)Ωi
the initial potential energy is
Ωi = −ηi GM
Ri
where M is the mass of the cluster, Ri is a characteristic radius, and ηi is a structure parameter.
The cluster will virialize and erase its substructure resulting in a cluster where
E = Ω f
= −η f
GM
R f
with a new distribution and so a new structure parameter η f , and a new radius R f . The degree
to which the cluster has collapsed is
Ri
R f
= ηi
η f
(−Qi)
Typical values for these parameters are an initial virial ratio of Qi ∼., an initial clumpy
structure parameter of ηi = ., and a final smooth structure parameter η f = .(clumpy
distributions have a higher η as clumps contain more potential energy than if they were
smoothed-out). This means that clusters will typically collapse by a factor of about .. After
collapse clusters will tend to “bounce,” rapidly increasing their radii (Allison et al. 2009).
An interesting consequence of this collapse and bounce is that the dynamical timescales of
clusters will change significantly during their early life. The crossing time/dynamical time4 of a
cluster can be calculated if the size R and the velocity dispersion σ of a cluster are known
tcross = R
σ
The crossing time gives the shortest timescale on which the cluster can be expected to change,
in particular the timescale on which dynamical interactions and the destruction of binaries will
occur. From the crossing time the two-body relaxation time of the clustercan also be calculated,
which is the timescale on which the velocities of stars will significantly change.
The size of a cluster is relatively simple to observe, but the velocity dispersion of a cluster
is often unknown. To observe the velocity dispersion of a cluster either detailed spectroscopy
of many stars (which may be contaminated by binary motions) or long-baseline proper motion
determinations are required. Very often these are not available and so the velocity dispersion is
estimated by assuming that the cluster is virialized. This is probably a very poor approximation
4For our purposes the terms are interchangeable.

272 5
Star Formation
in young clusters as it is found that when the actual velocity dispersion is known, many clusters
appear to be out of virial equilibrium (Goodwin and Bastian 2006).
However, determinations of the crossing times of clusters are instantaneous values. If a clus-
ter has undergone a collapse and a re-expansion, then R mayhave changed by a factor of several,
and σ may well have changed as well (although probably less than R) and therefore the cluster
may be many more crossing times older than the instantaneous value might suggest, and so the
cluster may be far more dynamically evolved than one might think.
As an example, the current half-mass radius of Orion is .pc, and its mass is about M⊙.
If Orion were virialized this would suggest a velocity dispersion of σ ∼km s−, and a crossing
time of about a Myr giving a dynamical age of Orion of 2 or 3 crossing times. However, Orion
is not virialized, and its velocity dispersion is actually observed to be σ ∼km s−, implying a
crossing time of only half the virialized value. But, if the velocity dispersion of Orion is signifi-
cantly super-virial, then Orion must be expanding, and so its size must have been significantly
smaller in the past as well. Therefore Orion is probably tens of crossing times old, rather than
the 2–3 implied by assuming it is virialized, or the 4–6 from using the actual velocity dispersion,
but only the current (larger) size.
3.4 The End of Star Formation
Star formation ends when there is no (dense molecular) gas remaining from which to form
stars. It is thought that the feedback of energy from massive stars – winds, radiation, and even-
tually supernovae – stop star formation by heating and then removing gas from the star forming
region. Massive stars begin to feedback energy while they are still forming, and so the formation
of the first massive star(s) marks the beginning of the end of star formation.
Stars >30–40 M⊙will feedback around J of energy in winds and UV radiation during
their lifetimes, and another J when they become supernovae. Their prodigious energy out-
put ionizes the gas around the stars preventing it from forming new stars and expels the gas
from around them. But the expulsion of gas from a central cluster of massive stars can also
trigger star formation in surrounding gas that is dense enough, and/or far enough to escape
being ionized. Observations of young star clusters find that there are no star clusters older than
3–5 Myr which have gas associated with them (e.g., Lada and Lada 2003) suggesting that gas
loss occurs at around this age.
It is also found that there are far fewer star clusters older than 10 Myr than would be
expected from the number of young clusters we see (Lada and Lada 2003). >Figure 5-9 shows
the observed numbers of clusters within 2 kpc of the Sun of different ages (solid line) against
the expected numbers of clusters for a constant cluster formation rate (dotted line), and the
expected number corrected for luminosity evolution (dashed line). If the cluster formation rate
were constant, each equal logarithmic age bin should contain increasing numbers of clusters
(as it covers a larger span of linear time).
The observations of clusters have some problems. Firstly, aging the youngest clusters is
rather problematic, and so the differences between the first two bins should not be taken too
seriously. Secondly, less massive clusters are expected to dissolve due to internal two-body
effects and so cluster numbers will fall with time. However, the lack of older clusters com-
pared to younger clusters is dramatic and inexplicable by either internal dynamics or errors
in the observations. This tells us one of two things: (a) the cluster formation rate has not been
constant over the past few hundred Myr, or (b) many (most) clusters are destroyed.

The solid line shows the observed number of clusters with age within 2 kpc of the Sun. The dotted
line shows the expected number of clusters if the cluster formation rate has been constant over
this period and no clusters have been destroyed, the dashed line shows this number corrected for
luminosity evolution (Adapted from Lada and Lada 2003)
The favored interpretation is that clusters are destroyed. There is noevidence that the current
cluster formation rate is vastly (factors of 10) higher than in the recent past. In particular, there
is absolutely no evidence that the cluster formation rate has vastly increased in the past 10–
20 Myr as would be needed to explain the difference between the model and the second and
third age bins.
Clusters are thought to be destroyed by two mechanisms. Most (up to 90%) clusters that
form are thought to be destroyed by the rapid expulsion of gas by massive stars. And many of
those clusters that do survive are destroyed by evaporating.
3.4.1 Gas Expulsion
As noted before, the star formation efficiencies of star clusters are low, only 10–30%. There-
fore star clusters at the point at which massive stars begin to remove gas are gravitationally
dominated by that gas. Therefore, the removal of the gas removes the largest contributor to the
binding energy of the cluster (see Goodwin 2009 and references therein).
Assuming that a cluster of total mass M has formed stars with an efficiency є, the stellar
mass is єM and the gas mass is (−є)M. For a cluster of size R and velocity dispersion σ the
initial energy Ei is
Ei = 
Mσ −GM
R
and if it is in virial equilibrium then
Ei = −GM
R .

274 5
Star Formation
If all of the gas is expelled instantaneously (in this case, this means in less than a crossing time),
then R and σ for the stars do not change, but the gas mass is removed meaning that the final
energy E f is
E f = 
єMσ −єGM
R
It is easy to show that if є < ., then the cluster is now unbound and has been destroyed by the
gas expulsion.
In practice, gas expulsion is rather more complex than this as gas expulsion can be adi-
abatic rather than instantaneous (i.e., it takes longer than a crossing time) which somewhat
alleviates its effects, and also even if it is instantaneous a much smaller bound core may be
retained. But even taking these effects into account, star clusters cannot survive gas expulsion
if their star formation efficiencies are less than –% (Goodwin and Bastian 2006). Such star
formation efficiencies are at the upper end of those observed, and so it would be expected that
many star clusters would be destroyed by gas expulsion after only a few Myr in keeping with
the observations of cluster numbers with age.
3.4.2 Dynamical Evolution
Even if a star cluster is able to survive gas expulsion, many will not survive for long. Two-body
interactions between stars alter the velocity dispersion of the stars in a cluster driving it toward
a Maxwellian. Stars in the tail of the Maxwellian with greater than the escape velocity of the
cluster are able to escape, which lowers the mass of the cluster, which lowers the escape velocity,
which makes escape easier. Thus a cluster will evaporate over time.
The timescale over which the velocity distribution changes significantly (and a Maxwellian
is established) is the relaxation time trelax given by
trelax ∼
N
lnN tcross
where N is the number of stars in a cluster(see Binney and Tremaine 2008 for a derivation), and
clusters can survive for roughly ten relaxation times before dissolving, although this depends
strongly on the strength of the external tidal field (see Spitzer 1987). Lamers et al. (2005) provide
a semi-analytic formulation of the survival time of a star cluster in a galaxy.
Therefore, low-mass (low-N) clusters will not survive for long, even if they do manage to
survive gas expulsion. It is no surprise that the only extremely old clusters that are observed
are very massive globular clusters, as they are the only clusters that could have survived for a
Hubble Time, even if many low-mass clusters also formed 12 Gyr ago.
3.5 Is Star Formation Universal?
The final question is that of the universality of star formation. Do all stars form in roughly the
same way, or does the environment in which stars form play a crucial role? Are the stars that
form in Taurus-like associations the same as those that form in very massive clusters? And do
all clusters of the same mass form stars in the same way? While this might seem like a fairly
simple question, the answer is far from clear.

Star Formation 5
275
The form of the IMF might well be expected to vary with environment and thus provide
important clues as to the universality or otherwise of star formation. However, the IMF is sur-
prisingly invariant (Bastian et al. 2010). It is unknown why the IMF is universal, but it might
suggest that star formation is everywhere the same.
Are there are any other clues as to the universality of star formation? Many (most?) stars
form as binary and multiple systems and these provide additional information on the star for-
mation process in a region. For example, if one region produces many wide binaries with very
different masses, while another region produces fewer binaries which are all close equal-mass
systems, then star formation in those two regions must have been very different, even if the
IMFs are the same (Goodwin and Kouwenhoven 2009).
Observationally the binary fractions and wide binary populations of different star forming
regions are different. For example, Taurus has a binary fraction of almost unity (Leinert et al.
1993; Patience et al. 2002), while the binary fraction of Orion is more like the field with very
few wide binaries (Reipurth et al. 2007; Scally et al. 1999).
So, do different binary populations imply different star formation? The answer is maybe,
but maybe not. Taurus is dynamically young and has little time to process its initial binary
population so it should be close to its birth population. However, Orion is dynamically old and
so the birth population may have been significantly altered (Parker et al. 2009). It is possible to
model the current binary population of Orion as initially Taurus-like and evolved, or as initially
different and less evolved (see Goodwin 2010).
Therefore the crucial question of the universality of star formation is unclear. Different
regions may form stars in very different ways, or it may always be basically the same.
4
Conclusions
How stars form is an extremely complex problem. Extremely good progress has been made
observationally and theoretically over the past few years, but even some quite basic issues in
star formation are far from being understood.
The IMF appears universal, but its origin and why it is universal are unknown. The basics
of low-mass star formation seem relatively well-understood, but initial binary fractions and
distributions and the origin of binarity are unclear. High-mass star formation is very uncertain,
and it is not understoodhow high-mass stars are able to overcome feedback to accrete to masses
as high as are observed.
While the lack of understanding of many basic aspects of star formation is rather annoying,
it does mean that star formation is an area that has a vast potential for new and exciting science
in the coming decades.

Young Stellar Objects and Protostellar Disks
Abstract:
Stars form out of molecular clouds with densities of 10cm−and temperatures of
10 K. Clouds fragment into molecular cores covering a broad range of masses that give rise to
the formation stellar associations, clusters and single stars. High mass star formation rapidly
removes the environmental gas and dust having a large impact into cloud evolution. Low mass
star formation is less aggressive with the environmental cloud. Young stellar objects (YSOs)
display a wide range of properties depending on their mass, age and star forming environment.
Very massive YSOs generate ultracompact HII regions embedded in the cores of molecular
clouds. Their key observational properties are related with the action of strong and highly pho-
toionizing radiation fields in the surrounding molecular cloud. They evolve in time scales of few
Myrs into the main sequence. Low mass YSOs progress to the main sequence at a slower pace;
the gravitational collapse is slowed down bythe action ofthe molecularcloud magneticfield and
their most conspicuous observational properties are related with dissipation of the magnetic
energy carried out during star formation and enhanced by shear during the star building up.
Protostellardisks are a by-product ofstarformation. Theyare formed as angularmomentum
reservoirs during the gravitational accretion process that gives rise to the formation of new stars.
They are observed around all types of YSOs however their properties and evolution depend on
the nature of the parent star/stars. The opacity of the disk and its selfshielding properties against
the stellar and the environmental radiation field determine the lifetime of protostellar disks that
end as debris disks and planetary systems. Disks play a key role in the generation of the powerful
bipolar outflows observed during star formation. Bipolar outflows are observed from the very
early stages (10years) of star formation and from all the mass spectrum of YSOs.
This chapter attempts to summarize our current understanding of single star formation and
the joint evolution of the star-disk system towards the main sequence.

Introduction
Stars form out ofdense gas in molecularclouds. Clouds fragment intomolecularcores that after-
ward contract gravitationally to form either single or multiple stellar systems. Fragmentation
requires rapid cooling, faster than the relevant dynamical timescales of the system, and depends
on the physical properties and chemical composition of matter as described in detail in
> Chap. 4. Most of the stars are formed in multiple systems where the angular momentum
of the original cloud is stored in a coupled spin-orbit system with a fraction of the angular
momentum going into the orbits of fragments and another fraction into the collapsing frag-
ments themselves. During star formation, the specific angular momentum decreases several
orders of magnitude from j ≃cms−in molecular cloud material (scales of about 1 pc) to
j ≃cms−in molecular cores (scales of about 0.1 pc) to reach finally j ≃cms−in the
young stars entering the main sequence. During this process angular momentum conservation
leads to the formation of angular momentum reservoirs, the protostellar disks, that grow as the
stellar embryo does it and that have their own evolutionary scales.

Young Stellar Objects and Protostellar Disks 6
281
The term Young Stellar Object (YSO) is introduced to define astronomical sources in this
evolutionary phase from contracting objects within opaque dust cocoons to pre-main sequence
(PMS) stars close to the zero age main sequence. Three major evolutionary phases can be
defined in the formation of stars:
•
Phase I: Protostellar core evolution: The evolution of gravitationally bounded molecular
cores into protostellar cores. The evolution timescale is controlled by the turbulence field
in the core.
•
Phase II: Main accretion phase: The main accretion phase begins when turbulence sup-
port is overcome and non-homologous gravitational collapse produces a differentiation
between the stellar embryo and the surrounding envelope. At the end of this phase, a cen-
tral source that contains about half of the mass of the core is formed. Simultaneously a
large protostellar disk is formed. During this evolutionary phase YSOs are denoted as class 0
YSOs (see Froebrich 2005 for a catalog). The stellar birthline is defined by the end of this
phase.
•
Phase III: PMS stellar evolution and planetary disk formation: Hydrostatic equilibrium evo-
lution from the stellar birthline to the main sequence. At the same time, the protostellar
disk evolves from a massive structure channeling the accretion flow into a passive plane-
tary disk. During this process the disk luminosity varies several orders of magnitude. At the
first stages, the stellar atmosphere is occulted by the heavy excess produced by the accretion
flow and the remnant extinction of the envelope. As these decrease, the stellar atmosphere
becomes recognizable. Finally, the young planetary disk is formed and the stellar evolution
is decoupled from the disk evolution. Objects in these three phases are named as Class I,
II, and III YSOs, respectively. These three classes trace mainly the evolutionary state of the
disk (see Herbig and Bell 1988 for a catalog).
This chapter is aimed at describing the last two evolutionary steps: the properties and evo-
lution of protostellar disks and their interaction with the growing star. This interaction is a rich
source of physics being the most conspicuous in the creation of gravitational engines able to
accelerate part of the accreting matter and eject it forming large bipolar outflows. The physics of
pre-main sequence evolution is very complex and competing simple scenarios have been devel-
oped to tackle the different aspects of the problem. For this reason, this chapter has been divided
into three sections dealing with the evolution of the three main components of YSOs: star, disk,
and outflow. This division mimics the physical systems involved and the main areas of theo-
retical work; however, it is worth to remark that these three components are strongly coupled
through gravity, radiation and magnetic fields. In addition, the identification of the contribution
from each component to the observed radiation is not always straightforward leading to uncer-
tainties in the interpretation of the data within a given theoretical framework. The spectrum of
the prototypes to low mass and intermediate mass PMS stars, T Tau and AB Aur, respectively,
are displayed in >Fig. 6-1; the physical components that dominate the radiative output at each
wavelength are indicated. A sketch of the structure of the inner ∼1 AU of low mass YSOs is
outlined in >Fig. 6-2.

free-fall times1 (.−.× years) suggesting some degree of support during this phase. The
support is most likely provided by turbulence. Molecular line emission from protostellar cores
is very broad, typically 1–4 km s−, thus highly suprathermal for the low temperatures of the
cores.2 As magnetic fields pervade the InterStellarMedium (ISM) HydroMagnetic (HM) turbu-
lence is a natural source of support. In fact, the line broadening after subtraction of the thermal
component scales with the cores’ mean magnetic field (Myers and Goodman 1988). Molecu-
lar cores are weakly ionized3 thus a strong coupling between ions and neutrals is required to

where ni is the ions’ particle density in the core and < V > is the characteristic velocity of the
gas motions and γn,i the rate coefficient for ion-neutral collisions (Braginskii 1965). This fre-
quency defines the ambipolar diffusion threshold. HM waves with frequencies higher than νn,i
only operate on a small fraction of the massof the core, the ionized component, and cannot sup-
port the core against collapse. HM waves with frequencies shorter than νn,i are able to support
molecular cores against collapse. HM waves with frequencies ∼νn,i dissipate by the neutrals’
drag force heating the cores by ambipolar diffusion. The ambipolar diffusion timescale or the
timescale for momentum transfer between ions and neutrals in molecular clouds was derived
by Arons and Max (1975) to be,

with μn,i = mi/(mi + mn), n(H) the density of the molecular gas, χi the ionization fraction
(ni/nn), and P the characteristic timescale of the propagating mode. τAD depends on the ioniza-
tion fraction of the cores and thus on the strength and penetration of high-energy (ultraviolet,
X-ray) radiation. This timescale is comparable to the protostellar cores’ lifetime determined
from observations confirming that pseudo-hydrostatic contraction is a good approach to model
the first evolutionary stages of star formation. For this reason, Bonnor–Ebert spheres are often
taken as the departure point for dynamical calculations of the gravitational collapse from core
to class 0 YSOs.
Hydrostatic contraction of self-gravitating spheres was first studied by Bonnor, Ebert, and
McCrea in the late 1950s. Virial equilibrium in a self-gravitating molecular cloud leads to a
modified equation of state of the form pV = (M/μmH)kBT + (/)єg, where p, V, M, μmH,
and T are the cloud pressure, volume, mass, mean molecular weight, and temperature, respec-
tively; єg is the potential energy of the self-gravitating cloud, and kB the Boltzmann constant.
The hydrostatic evolution of the gas leads to a modified Emden equation whose solution departs
from the isothermal ideal gas law, that is, gravity prevents the volume to decrease smoothly as
pressure rises; instead, there is a critical volume (radius) above which self-gravitation drives the
object contraction. This critical radius is given by rc = .pc × (T/K)/(n/cm−)−/
where T and n are the temperature and particle density of the self-gravitating cloud (see
Bonnor 1957 for a discussion on the relation between this critical length and the Jeans length).
A critical mass can also be defined, the so-called Bonnor–Ebert mass, given by MB−E =
.M⊙(T/K)/(n/cm−)−/.
YSOs begin their life as the dynamical collapse begins. Gravitational infall is nonhomolo-
gous regardless of the choice of initial or boundary conditions; a stellarembryo rapidly develops
in the center of the core; free fall depends inversely on the density and the collapse proceeds
more rapidly in the center where the density is the highest. The density profile adopts the form
outlined in >Fig. 6-3 with a central plateau of uniform density (the rapidly contracting inner
part of the core) and an envelope with density distribution ρ(r) ∝r−p with p ∼in the outer
parts of the contracting core (Larson 1969). Density gradients measured in isolated low mass
protostellar cores follow closely this distribution though the slope is slightly shallower with
p ∼.−over the external .× −AU (Shirley et al. 2000, 2003). When the central
density rises above some 10cm−the heat generated by the release of gravitational energy
in the contraction is not any longer freely radiated away and compression becomes adiabatic

The evolution of core-envelope diﬀerentiation during the gravitational collapse is displayed in the left panel for a self-gravitating solar mass protostellar
core with initial uniform density (from Larson 1969). The molecular core central density rises. The envelope density decreases as “∼1/r2.”There is a turnover
point in the density distribution that shiftsto smaller radii asthe collapse progressesas shown in the upperinset. The observed density radial distribution for
the cores mapped by Kirk et al. (2005) is plotted in the rightpanels. The measured surface densities have been converted into volumetric densities assuming
that the emitting cores are Bonnor–Ebert spheres with the radii derived by Kirk et al. (2005)

in the stellar embryo. The inner core contracts slowly hydrostatically alike while the remnant
envelope keeps free-falling. Several readjustments of the protostellar core take place during this
period caused mainly by the variations in the internal energy of the embryo associated with
Hdissociation, dust processing, and the physics of the boundary layer and the shock front
between the infalling external layers of the protostellar core and the growing embryo. The main
accretion phase starts when the kinetic energy of the infalling material is negligible compared
with its thermal energy and ends when approximately half of the total mass has fallen into the
core. At this point the kinetic energy influx begins to decrease since the rise in the infall velocity
(Vff = (GM/R)/) cannot compensate the decrease in the density of the infalling material.
Observationally, objects during this period are named class 0 YSOs and are classified as
such by either having a central compact centimeter radio source or by displaying extended and
centrally peaked submillimeter continuum emission from the protostellar core. Additional cri-
teria are a high ratio of submillimeter to bolometric luminosity (Lsmm/Lbol > .with Lsmm
measured longward of 350 μm) which basically measures the mass ratio between the embryo
and the rest of the core (Andre et al. 2000). Young embryos can also be detected by means of
the powerful bipolar outflows they generate. A good catalog of class 0 YSOs has been compiled
by Froebrich (2005).
Accretion causes a variation of the Kelvin–Hemholtz timescale, τK−H = GM
∗/R∗L∗=
.× year(M∗/M⊙)(R∗/R⊙)−(L∗/L⊙)−, the timescale on which the star can radiate its
thermal energy. τK−H increases as the star grows, and the growth rate is set by matter infall.
After the main accretion phase, the temperature of the surface layers of the embryo decreases,
as well as its luminosity, and the energy radiated from the surface of the embryo comes primar-
ily from the interior instead of from the kinetic energy inflow. A convection zone develops and
the star enters into the convective phase of the pre-main sequence (PMS) evolution (the so-
called Hayashi track in low mass stars PMS evolution). At this point, the stellar PMS evolution
begins. Hydrostatic equilibrium is appropriate to describe the main physics; accretion is often
included as an external parameter that mildly affects the stellar structure.
Modeling of this evolution often begins assuming central temperatures low enough to
guarantee that nuclear energy generation rates are negligible relative to gravitational energy
generation rates but high enough to guarantee that hydrogen and helium are ionized through-
out most of the star (Iben 1965). Central-outward integrations are matchedwith surface-inward
integrations. PMS evolutionary tracks are computed from an uncertain initial mass–radiusrela-
tionship. Key ingredients are the equation of state (Mihalas et al. 1988; Pols et al. 1995; Rogers
et al. 1996; Saumon et al. 1995), the opacity tables (Alexander and Ferguson 1994; Iglesias and
Rogers 1996), and the reaction rates (Caughlan and Fowler 1988). Most of the models assume
gray atmospheres and adopt the standard Mixing Length Theory (MLT) treatment (Boehm-
Vitense 1958) in which the free parameter, αMLT, measures the ratio between the mixing length
and the pressure scale height; this parameter is tuned in a range between 1 and 2. D’Antona and
Mazzitelli (1997) have introduced a different formalism to describe turbulent convection in the
models that takes into account the energy redistribution among different size eddies within the
turbulence cascade, following the Kolmogorov prescription based on Canuto and Mazzitelli
(1991) treatment. Direct attempts to include the effect of accretion have been led by Siess and
Forestini (1996) and Behrend and Maeder (2001). Accretion implies a flow of fresh deuterium
into the star; the rapid rate of the reaction H(p,γ)→He (barely few hundred years) and the
fast penetration of deuterium are able to influence the global stellar evolution (Siess et al. 1997).
PMS evolutionary tracks from non-accreting PMS stars (D’Antona and Mazzitelli 1997) and
accreting PMS stars (Siess et al. 2000) are plotted in >Fig. 6-4.

They include the eﬀect of fresh deuterium accretion during the PMS evolution
A fundamental calibration of the PMS evolutionary tracks is difficult. The amount of
sources with known dynamical masses is small: four PMS eclipsing binaries – RS Cha (Ander-
sen 1991), TY CrA (Casey et al. 1998), V1174 Ori (Stassun et al. 2004) and RXJ0529+0041
(Covinoet al. 2004), and three spectroscopicbinaries – AK Sco(Andersen et al. 1989), UZ Tau A
(Simon et al. 2000) and RXJ0529+1210 (Mace et al. 2009). Keplerian disks orbiting around PMS
stars also provide dynamical measurementsof the stellar mass. Spatially resolved CO molecular
emission has been detected from nine of them (MWC 480, LkCa 15, DL Tau, GM Aur, DM Tau,
CY Tau, BP Tau, GG Tau A, and UZ Tau E) by Simon et al. (2000). The mass–luminosity rela-
tionship derived from these few observations is compared with that derived from the theoretical
tracks in >Fig. 6-5. There is not a clear mass–luminosity trend and the deviations between the
dynamical masses and the ones derived from evolutionary tracks fitting are about a 10–50%.
This comparison can be further extended including double PMS stars and early-main sequence

(2004), there is generally good agreement between predicted and dynamical masses both for
PMS and early main sequence stars in the mass range 1.2–2 M⊙. Below this threshold, models
underestimate the stellar masses, being the trend more significant for the lower mass end, from
early M-type stars to 0.1–0.2 M⊙stars. At this end of the mass spectrum, the role of accretion
disks in PMS evolution extends longer in time.

PMS Evolution: The Disk
Disks form because free fall drives rotating cores to its minimum energy configuration, where
most of the mass is concentrated in the center and most of the angular momentum is stored in
a distant reservoir of negligible mass, as in the Solar System. They are observed around YSOs
independently of their mass and evolutionary phase with the only possible exception of early
O-type stars. As early as a free-fall time, a flattened structure forms around the growing stellar
embryo. In this lapse, material with negligible angular momentum has already been accreted

Young Stellar Objects and Protostellar Disks 6

onto the stellar embryo and the envelope material begins to feed massively the flattened reser-
voir in centrifugal equilibrium around the star. About this time, a “mechanism” sets in the disk
that allows transporting the high angular momentum material from the disk into the star, cou-
pling stellar growth to disk evolution. This mechanism acts efficiently on the gas component
and, as disks loose gas, the accretion rate decreases. In about few Myrs, the gas to dust mass den-
sity ratio falls from 100, the fiducial ISM value, to less than 4 in transitional disks (see Collins
et al. 2009) and later to values <<1 in debris disks as, for instance, β Pic disk (Roberge et al.
2006). In >Fig. 6-6 (from Looney et al. 2007), both components of the disk (gas and dust) are
displayed for a class 0 YSO: L1157. The extinction of the environmental infrared radiation by
the dust in the disk produces the dark lane. The molecular (CO) gas radio emission from the
disk is also plotted as a contour map in the lower left inset. Perpendicular to them, there is a
prominent bipolar outflow, mainly constituted of molecular gas with two clear components:
the hot shocked gas, at temperatures ≥2,000 K, radiating in the infrared Hlines and the cold
(<100 K) entrained gas radiating at radio frequencies in the CO line. As the radial extent of
disks is some thousands of AU, they are less conspicuous than the outflows that may extend
over more than a parsec. As other astrophysical disks, protostellar disks are associated with the

formation of powerful bipolar outflows which are often the earliest observational signature of
star formation. The connection between disks and outflows is described in >Sect. 4.
There are two main differences between protostellar and other types of astrophysical disks
such as the disks around active galactic nucleii or white dwarfs. Firstly, the thermal properties of
the disk are controlled by the dust and depend strongly on the optical properties and thickness
of their icy coatings as well as on the dust grains’ size distribution. As a result, radiative processes
are significantly more difficult to constraint than in the usual astrophysical disks made of simple
atomic gas. Secondly, protostellar disks are not formed by smooth mass transfer between binary
companions but as a result of gravitational collapse. Early stages, when the disk grows out of
the envelope can be observed opening the way to the study of the physics of disk formation.
Disks are observed around YSOs at all evolutionary stages from the early class 0 stages to
the late class III sources. This sequence traces the history of accretion and disk evolution. In this
section, the current knowledge on the properties, structure, and evolution of protostellar disks
is reviewed.
3.1 Morphology of Protostellar Disks
The nearest star forming regions are in a ring of radius 140 pc around the Sun. This ring marks
the molecular walls of the Local Bubble in the ISM and forms part of a local kinematical and
physical structure in the Galaxy known as the Gould’s Belt (see Appendix A). Only very few
and low mass class III YSOs are placed closer to the Sun, namely, TW Hya at 56 pc or the more
evolved AB Dor at 15 pc. Thus, the distance of 140 pc sets the target angular resolution for
disks’ studies: 7 mas to resolve 1 AU scales or 0.07 mas to resolve the boundary between the
star and the disk. Currently, the only way to achieve such a high resolution is by means of inter-
ferometry at optical and infrared wavelengths. Typical facilities have baselines of about 100 m
and probe wavelengths of 1–13 μm providing spatial resolutions of 2–10 mas or 0.25–1.25 AU.
These wavelengths trace hot dust emission (300–1,800 K) from the disk inner AU. The main
structural properties of protostellar disks are described below.
3.1.1 The Inner Cavity Filled in with Hot Gas
The best studied targets are the Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBe stars). Herbig stars are YSOs in
Phase III with masses of 2–10 solar masses that correspond to spectral types A to B. They are
more luminous than the low mass (<M⊙) YSOs also known as T Tauri Stars or TTSs. Disks
show as extended ellipses due to the projection of the circular disk on the plane of the sky.
At 1–4 μm, disk emission is expected to be dominated by hot dust at the disk surface that scat-
ters the stellar radiation. In fact, there is a strong correlation between the measured disk radii
(r) and the luminosity of the central stars (L∗): r ∝L/
∗
(Millan-Gabet et al. 2007) as shown
in >Fig. 6-7. The observed disks radii are too large for the inefficient grazing incidence illu-
mination of the disk surface. Direct illumination by the star is required instead, i.e., an inner
disk cavity devoid of dust must exist around the star. Measured radii are consistent with the
dust sublimation radii of relatively large dust grains (≥μm) with sublimation temperatures in
the range 1,000–1,500 K. The existence of this dust sublimation ring has been independently
inferred from the bump in the near infrared energy distribution of Herbig stars (Natta et al.

mation radii for dust directly heated by the central luminosity (solid and dashed lines) and for the
oblique heating of ﬂaring disks (dotted line) after Millan-Gabet et al. (2007)
2001). The inner rim of the dusty disk is expected to be puffed-up by hydrostatic equilibrium
but its vertical structure is still unclear.
The inner cavity of the disk is filled in with hot gas that is well traced by the CO funda-
mental (Δν = ) ro-vibrational transition at 2.3 μm. CO is an abundant molecule with high
dissociation energy that can survive to temperatures of 4,000–5,000 K and is observed in nearly
all CTTS (Najita et al. 2003). Many line profiles show the classic double-peaked profile pro-
duced in rotating rings. The location of the emission region can be derived assuming Keplerian
rotation in a thin disk. The profile also contains information on the radial variation of the gas
emission. Radial variation of the gas temperature and column density can also be constrained
if the first overtone band (Δν = ) at 4.7 μm or other transitions from the same molecule are
detected. The inner gas radius peaks about 0.04 AU and it is generally smaller than the corota-
tion radius,4 while the inner rim in the dust distribution is above this value. In addition, strong
continuum emission has been detected in the far ultraviolet (1,300–1,700 Å) from some TTSs
with bright molecular disks and inner disk gaps of few AU (Ingleby et al. 2009). This emission
is likely due to energetic photoelectrons mixed into the molecular layer, providing additional
evidence on the existence of a hot component in the inner disk.
4Corotation radius is the disk radius at which the Keplerian frequency equals the angular velocity of the
star. Typical rotation velocities of YSOs range between 2 and 15 km s−; thus, the corotation radius is: rcorot =
.AU(M∗/M⊙)/(P/d)/, with P the rotation period of the star.

3.1.2 Disks Are Flared
The infrared spectrum of disks depends on the geometry of the disk and the composition of the
dust. “Bowl-shaped” flared disks are much more efficient at capturing stellar photons than flat
disks since (1) the geometrical covering factor of the stellar radiation field is higher and (2) the
radiation incidence angle is closer to the normal to the disk surface.
Disk flaring is required toexplain the spectral energydistribution (SED)ofTTSs and HAeBe
stars. In the 1–10 μm range, SEDs can be fitted by power laws (νSν ∝νs) with slopes, s, that
range between 0.6 and 1 for the TTSs and between –1 and 1 for HAeBe stars. These slopes
are softer than those expected from standard irradiated disks (s = /) suggesting that the
outer rings of the disk, the ones that radiate at the longest wavelengths, are capturing the stellar
photons more efficiently than expected, i.e., disks are flared.
The upper, atmospheric disk layers can be mapped directly by means of the 8–13 μm radia-
tion produced by the warm dust; infrared interferometers allow to probe scales of 1–4 AU. The
radius of the region radiating at 8–13 μm is larger in HAeBe stars with strong flux in the far
infrared5 (Leinert et al. 2004) that are expected to have more flared disks. The measured radii
are however, smaller than predicted by simple flared disk models (Millan-Gabet et al. 2001)
suggesting an extra shadowing of the stellar radiation illuminating the puffed up inner rim of
the dusty disk, as the despicted in >Fig. 6-2.
In addition, radio interferometry at millimetric wavelengths allows to explore the gas dis-
tribution as traced by the CO emission at scales >50 AU. CO(J = −) emission is produced
at the disk surface and the radial distribution of CO kinetic temperature also agrees with the
expectations of flared disks.
3.1.3 Dusty Atmospheres and Warps
At 0.4–1 μm scales, high resolution direct imaging is feasible with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) and Adaptive Optics from the ground. The stellar radiation scattered by the circumstel-
lar dust allows mapping the distribution and properties of the dust in the inner 500 AU with
spatial resolution of about 100 mas (14 AU). Class I and II YSOs have thick dust disks that
absorb the stellar radiation producing a dark lane in the images when disks are observed close
to edge-on (see >Fig. 6-8). This lane also acts like a natural coronograph that blocks direct
stellar light providing high contrast for direct imaging. Further information is obtained from
highly disturbed disks detected by their blockage of the environmental radiation, the so-called
silhouette disks. Coronographs have also been used to block the stellar radiation and increase
the dynamical range in the images; they typically block the inner, and more interesting, 0.”5
(70 AU). However, despite all the efforts, most of the YSOs disks remain undetectable.
There are about 15 edge-on systems known with outer radii6 ranging from 30 AU in
IRAS 04325+2402 (Hartmann et al. 1999) to 620 AU in Orion 114–426 (Shuping et al. 2003).
The vertical distribution of dust in the disks is derived from these images (see details in Watson
et al. 2007). Disk scale heights are larger in systems with outflows like HH 30 where it reaches
6.3 AU at 50 AU from the star. Scattering dust grains are dominated by small particles that have

excess and Group II with s = .−and weak far infrared excess (Meeus et al. 2001).

much higher scattering cross section at shorter wavelengths. There is also evidence of grain size
growth toward the disk midplane. Remnant circumstellar dusty envelopes have been detected
in several systems. Occasionally, morphological variations are detected in the images. The most
intriguing ones have been observed in HH 30; the reflection nebula varies on timescales ≤1
year that cannot be accounted by variations in the large-scale structure of the disk but rather
on the illumination from the inner 1 AU. Whether this is yet another manifestation of the vari-
able extinction events produced at the inner rim of the disk or in disk warps (as the detected in
AA Tau by O’Sullivan et al. 2005) is still under debate.
3.2 Disk Mass
Molecular emission provides direct measurements of the gas content of the disk and its velocity
pattern. The gas to dust mass ratio is not constant in YSOs’ disks; close to the disk midplane most
of the gas is frozen out into dust grains while dust grains are melted in the surface areas (Rettig
et al. 2006). On average, the dust to gas mass ratio in protostellar disks is considered to be about
a hundred, similar to that observed in the ISM. For this ratio, the column densities of YSOs
disks can be approximated to be Σ(r) = .gcm−(r/AU)−.from CO interferometric
measurements (Dutrey et al. 2007).
Disk rotation has been investigated in a limited amount of YSOs’ disks since CO interfer-
ometry is required to resolve the disk rotation curve (Mannings and Sargent 2000; Simon et al.
2000). The sample is biased to disks with strong CO emission that are found to have a large outer
radius: 200–1,000 AU. However, smaller (and less massive) disks are detected around some
heavily accreting TTSs, as BP Tau: the CO disk radius is ∼120 AU and its mass ∼.× −M⊙
(Dutrey et al. 2003). All disks are found in Keplerian rotation with the exception of AB Aur that
also shows a prominent spiral pattern in the optical and near infrared (Grady et al. 1999; Lin
et al. 2006).
The main discriminating feature between disks around high and low mass PMS stars is
the ratio between the disk and the stellar mass, Md/M∗. In low mass stars Md/M∗< ., in
massive B-type stars Md/M∗≤, and Md/M∗>> in O-type stars. The stability and life-
time of high mass YSOs’ disks is uncertain. Typically, the massive rotating structures observed
in YSOs with luminosities ≥L⊙have radii of 4,000–30,000AU, masses of 60–500 M⊙,
and rotation speeds of a few km s−. For these parameters, the accretion rate would be about
× −−× −M⊙year−(Zhang et al. 2005) corresponding to timescales for the whole
disk depletion of 10year, i.e., an order of magnitude smaller than the rotation period at the
outer disk radius. This indicates that these very massive rotating structures cannot be centrifu-
gally supported and should be considered as transient, nonequilibrium evolving structures; they
probably host a stellar cluster. Most of the bona fide candidates to disks around high mass YSOs
orbit about ∼10 M⊙stars, with luminosities typical of B-type ZAMS stars. In these objects, the
estimated lifetime of the disks is about 10year that it is comparable to the free-fall time of the
mother molecular core. The most convincing disk around a high mass YSO has been detected
in the Orion KL region through OH maser emission: IRAS 20126+4104 (Edris et al. 2005).
The temperature law in the disk seems to follow T(r) ∝r−/and the rotation to be Keplerian
(Cesaroni et al. 2005).
Identifying candidate disks around very massive protostars requires a careful selection of
targets and tracers, to overcome the problems related toobservations of massive YSOs. The most
important of these are the large distance (a few kpc i.e. about ten times farther than the Gould’s

Young Stellar Objects and Protostellar Disks 6
295
Belt) and the confusion caused by the fact that massive stars form in rich clusters. In spite of the
numerous attempts, no disks have been detected about early O-type stars (see Cesaroni et al.
2007 for a detailed analysis on possible observational biases).
3.3 Composition of Protostellar Disks
Disk composition is dominated by molecular hydrogen while the thermal properties of disks are
controlled by dust that acts as the main coolant. A thin layer of atomic gas is also detected at the
disk atmosphere caused by the photodissociation cascade activated by the stellar UV photons.
3.3.1 Dust
Dust composition and mixture is best investigated in the infrared spectrum of the PMS stars.
The strong resonances of abundant dust species both O-rich (silicates either amorphous or crys-
talline) and C-rich (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons or PAHs) are observed in the 8–13 μm
range. The broad 9.7 μm amorphous silicate (Si-O stretching)feature dominates this wavelength
regime and evolves from absorption in young, embedded sources, to emission in optically visi-
ble stars and to complete absence in debris disk systems both for TTSs and HAeBe stars (Furlan
et al. 2006; Kessler-Silacci et al. 2005).The presence of PolyAromatic Hydrocarburs (PAHs) (6.2,
7.7, 8.6, 11.3 μm) has been reported in the spectra of only some TTSs (Geers et al. 2006).
A typical model of dust grain composition in protostellar disks consists of a mixture of three
main components: small amorphous carbon grains, large silicate grains (in two basic com-
pounds olivine and orthopyroxene), and silicate grains coated with “dirty ice.” “Dirty ice” is
mainly constituted of HO, CO, and other simple molecules though the exact composition is
very uncertain and depends on the physical conditions and the local star forming history in
the parent molecular cloud. The most abundant ice in protostellar disks is HO ice that plays
a major role in the opacity of disks at temperatures below its vaporization threshold (Preibisch
et al. 1993).
Grain growth in the dense protostellar disks modifies the size distribution with respect to
that observed in the ISM7 increasing amax up to several microns and producing variations in
the power index. Disk opacity is very sensitive to the fraction of dust grains with sizes compara-
ble to the local thermal wavelength: a ∼λ = .μm/T(K). Ice and silicates behave like good
dielectrics; following Mie theory, absorption and scattering efficiencies are weakly wavelength
dependent if a/λ > but below this value they drop rapidly to 0. As shown in > Table 6-1,
the fraction of the disk mass in silicates and water ice is about a 64% while refractory organ-
ics account for 25% of the total mass of the disk in dust. Strongly absorbing materials (with
imaginary refraction index), such as iron or fractals made of highly conducting materials (e.g.,
graphite), represent a small fraction of the total dust mass of the disk (Pollack et al. 1994).
There are clear indications of dust evolution from the molecular cores to the protostellar
disks. In addition to the coagulation of 0.1 μm to micron-sized dust grains that modifies the
size distribution, dust observed in disks is crystallized resulting in an increasing fraction of
crystalline silica, forsterite, and enstatite with respect to the amorphous pyroxene and olivine.

aAfter Table 2 in Pollack et al. 1994. About 10% of the silicateswere later found to be in crystallineform (Sargent
et al. 2009), see text
In HAeBe stars, silicate emission provides evidence of stellar heating of the disk atmosphere
in the inner ∼10 AU. In fact, there is a very high fraction of crystalline dust in the central
1–2 AU around HAeBe stars. This decreases toward 2–10 AU but still is significantly higher
than in the ISM, even at stages as early as 1 Myr, well before the onset of planet formation (van
Boekel et al. 2004). This is surprising since the temperature in these areas ofthe disk is well below
the glass formation temperature (about 1,000 K) but could be explained by chemical models of
protoplanetary disks that include effects of radial mixing and local processes in the outer disk
(Gail 2004). Crystalline silicate emission has been detected from TTSs; however, there is no
evidence of a radial gradient in the mass fraction of crystalline silicates (Sargent et al. 2009).
As YSOs’ disks evolve, their mid/far-infrared spectrum becomes more similar to that
observed in comets. There is also a radial gradient in dust chemistry and in the grain size with
large grains being more abundant in the inner disk.
3.3.2 Molecular Gas
His the main component of protostellar disks (the gas to dust mass ratio is ∼100 and CO/H∼
× −) and does not freeze-out onto grains. Though the molecule is effectively photodissoci-
ated through absorption of UV radiation in the Lyman and Werner bands (912–1,100 Å range),
Hself-shields efficiently against photodissociation. Unfortunately, the pure rotational lines in
the infrared are intrinsically weak and difficult to detect. The strong electronic transitions at
ultraviolet wavelengths are pumped by the stellar UV photons and are good tracers of the disk
atmosphere and innermost region.
After CO and H, the most abundant gas molecules are: HO, OH, SH, HCO+, CN, CH,
CS, HCN, HCO, and DCO+. The sensitivity of radio-interferometers has been too low to map
their spatial distribution in disks. Simple molecules such as CO, CO, HCO+, CN, and HCN
are detected from single dish observations. Line ratios indicate that the molecular emission
arises from dense (−cm−) and moderately warm (T ∼−K) intermediate height
regions of the disk atmosphere between the midplane and the disk upper layer, in accordance
with the predictions from models of disk chemistry. Molecular gas abundances are lower in the
YSOs than in the molecular prestellar cores. This is caused by gas freezed out into dust grains in
the cold midplane and molecules’ photodissociation in the upper disk layers. CN is very strong
in all disks. The CN/HCN abundance ratio toward the HAeBe stars is even higher than that

found in galactic photon-dominated regions, pointing out to the relevance of photodissociative
processes in the upperlayers ofthe disk. NoCHOHhas been detected toabundances −–−
with respect to H.
3.3.3 Disk Chemistry
Understanding disk chemistry requires to consider both gas phase and dust grain-surface pro-
cesses. Dust grains are key ingredients in the disk chemistry since they control the degree of
ionization in the most opaque areas of the disk; dust is an efficient electron donor for recombin-
ing ions and a sink for neutrals. At low temperatures (T ≃K) large molecules are stationary
on the grain surface and grow by reaction with mobile species like hydrogen. However, as the
temperature rises, diffusion and thermal evaporation produce desorption of the light species
such as hydrogen, thus braking the hydrogenation-driven chemistry on the surface. Later, heav-
ier compounds move from the grain surface to the gas phase. Desorption processes depend
exponentially on the grain temperature, gas phase abundances, and chemistry; thus chemical
modeling is very sensitive to the processing of the grain mantles. Surface reactions are com-
piled by Hasegawa et al. (1992) and Hasegawa and Herbst (1993) into the Ohio State University
(OSU) gas-grain chemical model.
Gas phase reactions and their rate coefficients are available in the UMIST RATE06 database
(Woodall et al. 2007) that includes about 420 species involving 13 elements: H, He, C, N, O, F,
Na, Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, and Fe. Uncertainties in the chemical reaction rates (RATE06 contains about
4,800 chemical reactions) may lead to ill-determined gas columns by as much as a factor of ∼4,
for some species. This is mainly caused by the large uncertainties in about a hundred chemi-
cal reactions (Vasyunin et al. 2008). Species such as CO, H+
, HO, NH, NH+, and HCNH+
seem to be rather insensitive to these uncertainties while other relevantspecies such as CS, CO,
HCO, CN, HCN, and HNC are sensitive to them. Further uncertainties in the chemical mod-
eling of disks are introduced by the difficulties to identify the precise route to the formation of a
given molecule, especially when dealing with large molecules that form both through gas phase
and grain surface reactions. As an example, the theoretically derived abundance of HCOOCH
gas in class 0 YSOs (hot cores) through the gas-based formation route is roughly a third of the
total abundance derived including both gas and grain routes (Garrod and Herbst 2006).
In general, chemical models of disk structure and evolution are developed with reduced sets
of equations that are defined selecting only those species necessary to compute the abundances
ofthe compounds understudy. As an example, todetermine the ionization degree ofprotostellar
disks, Semenov et al. (2004) worked with a reduced network of chemical reactions selected
according toa cutoffdefined bythe requested accuracyofthe final model. The numberofspecies
included in the reduced chemical networks to study the disk ionization fraction ranged from
four in the disk midplane at 1 AU from the star to some 50 at intermediate layers between the
irradiated atmosphere in the opaque interior. The integration of gas phase and grain surface
processes in chemical modeling of protostellar disks is hampered by the different nature of both
processes. Gas phase chemistry can be simulated using rate equations;however, grain chemistry
requires taking into consideration the availability of reacting particles in the grain. Some recent
approaches have been taken introducing modified rate equations to grain surface reactions that
include the probability of each reactant being available in the grain surface (Garrod et al. 2009).
Unfortunately, there is not yet a fully consistent disk model that solves for the chemical
and dynamical structures simultaneously. As the chemistry of the disk evolves on timescales
comparable to the dynamical timescale, this is a relevant source of uncertainty.

3.4 Disk Formation
During Phase II, accretion proceeds directly from the envelope of the molecular core onto the
stellar embryo and the flattened structure that sets the seed of the disk. After roughly a free-fall
time, material with negligible angular momentum has already been accreted onto the stellar
embryo, the disk begins to develop and channels the mass flow onto the star.
The formation of an equilibrium disk requires that self-gravity balances gas pressure at any
given point in the rotating disk. This balance is measured by the Toomre parameter,8 Q, that
must be larger than 1 for disks to remain stable. Disturbances on scales above Λc = GΣ/κ
are stabilized by the shear setting a maximum size of the unstable regions (Lynden-Bell and
Pringle 1974). At smaller scales, instabilities develop, accompanied of local heating and angular
momentum and mass transport.
Numerical simulations of the early gravitational collapse and disk/star differentiation are
displayed in > Fig. 6-9 from Yorke and Bodenheimer (1999). Let us use them as a depar-
ture point to describe disk formation. Departing from an initial configuration ρ(r) ∝r−,
a total mass of 2 M⊙, and a specific angular momentum of ∼cms−, Phase II ends in about
10years, just one free-fall time, since no hydromagnetic support is taken into account in this
simulation. Afterward, the disk seed begins to grow radially. It is necessary to prescribe the
radial transport of mass through the disk to the star to avoid mass accumulation in the disk,
i.e., to evolve the flattened structure into an accretion disk. The pace at which matter flows onto
the star is controlled by angular momentum conservation and thus, it is set by prescribing the
angular momentum transport within the disk. This is often done by introducing the parameter
α that scales the mass flow with the local sound speed in the disk. In this approach, transport
within the disk is not a conservative process and a fraction of the gravitational energy is lost
into disk heating and radiation. In the bottom panel of > Fig. 6-9, it is shown how α needs
to be modified for this particular simulation to keep the disk stable (according to Toomre’s
criterium). Major variations need to be introduced during the first free-fall time, after that α
only needs to be varied mildly. Once transport is prescribed, the evolution of the disk during
Phase II depends on the mass of the core (the larger the mass the earlier it ends) and on the
initial specific angular momentum of the core (the smaller the angular momentum, the larger
the amount of low angular momentum material available for direct accretion and so the dura-
tion of this phase). After the end of Phase II, the disk grows radially out to several thousands
of AU and accretion shocks develop as the kinetic energy of the infalling material is released.
The layered structure of the protostellar disk and the central force exerted by the star favors
kinetic energy dissipation in two major steps. Firstly, an external shock front forms where the
diffuse core material encounters the outer vertical edge of the disk. This material is later accel-
erated by the stellar gravitational field reaching highly supersonic velocities giving rise to the
formation of a second inner shock front. The simulations represented in the figures are based
on a simple treatment of angular momentum transport and ignore the presence of magnetic
fields and the effect of outflows; as a result, after a little over three times the original free-fall
scale, still 40% of the core mass is in the disk and the disk-to-mass ratio is 0.8, much larger
than observed. In fact, values typically inferred from observations indicate that the disk-to-star
mass ratio in low mass stars at protostellar stages is about 0.1 (Beckwith et al. 1990). Notice that
8Rotating, thin, gaseous disks are stable against gravitational perturbations if, Q = csκ/πGΣ > , where cs is
the sound speed, κ is the epicyclic frequency that measures the shear locally in the disk, G is the gravitational
constant, and Σ is the surface density of matter (Toomre 1964).

if disks were to absorb directly all the angular momentum of the core, their radius would be
j/GM = .AU × (j/)(M/M⊙)−and star formation would be a rather inefficient
process since a fair fraction of the mass of the core would be kept stored in the disk. Angular
momentum transport during disk formation is still an open problem.
3.5 Protostellar Disks and the α-Prescription Paradigm
The Toomre parameter is derived from pure hydrodynamical, linear theory; it cannot be applied
to turbulent or magnetized disks. In 1973, Shakura and Sunyaev, showed that a simple prescrip-
tion, the α-prescription, can be used to describe angular momentum transport and heating in
disks. In this approach, disks are treated as a set of nested rings with surface density Σ(r) that
rotate at different angular velocities. The friction between adjacent rings generates a tangential
stress −αΣc
s that produces an inward flow of matter to the central object. The name of the pre-
scription comes from the α parameter used to scale the stress with the local pressure. Each ring
radiates through the disk face roughly as a blackbody with a temperatureT(r) given by equating
the gravitational energy dissipation rate to the blackbody flux:

−/
f (r)
where ˙M is the accretion rate, M⊙and R⊙are the solar mass and radius, respectively, and
f (r) = (−(r/R∗)−/)/. The magnitudes are scaled to typical values for TTSs: accretion rates
of −M⊙year−, stellar masses of 1M⊙, and inner disk radius, rin, of about R⊙= .AU.
Henceforth, according to Wien’s law, disk radiation should peak at the near infrared and, the
higher the accretion rate, the higher the disk temperature should be. YSO’s infrared SED is well
fitted within this prescription that drove to the first classification of YSOs into class I, II, and III
(Adams et al. 1987). The SED slope in the range 1–100 μm varies from < s ≤in class I sources,
to −≤s ≤in class II sources, to −< s ≤−in class III sources. In class I sources, the infalling
envelope still has a non-negligible contribution to the infrared SED producing an excess toward
lower energies and longer wavelengths. In class II sources, SEDs depend directly on the accre-
tion rate following the α-prescription. Finally, the SED of class III sources is dominated by the
reprocessing of the stellar radiation on the disks (see also >Sect. 3.6).
In spite of this success, it is still unclear why the α-prescription works in protostellar
disks. The α-prescription is tied to the definition of a kinematical viscosity, ν, such that ν =
αcs(r)H(r) with H(r) being the maximal scale of the flow circulation cell, considered to be of
the order of the disk thickness (Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974), in a disk analogue to the mixing
length theory for stellar convection. In steady accretion disks, the radial mass flow is constant
and the radial distribution of matter is prescribed by the disk viscosity, ν, as:
Σ(r) =

ν(r)
˙M
π f (r)
with Σ(r) being the disk surface density. However, hydrodynamical turbulence cannot feed
this viscosity since Keplerian disks are stable to the Rayleigh criterion (angular momentum
increases radially outward). Magnetohydrodynamical turbulence could play this role if the disk
conductivity is high enough to allow the MagnetoRotational Instability (MRI) to set in and feed
the turbulence cascade. To operate, MRI requires that the disk is magnetized so the field creates
a stress, −BrBϕ/π, that couples fluid elements at different radial distances from the star and
forces them to exchange angular momentum (Balbus and Hawley 1991). The transfer of angular

Young Stellar Objects and Protostellar Disks 6

momentum from the inner element to the outer element permits the inner element to move to
lower orbits while the outer element moves to higher orbits. The magnetic tension acts like a
spring that has as rest length the wavelength of the most rapidly growing mode. In principle, this
scale corresponds to the length traveled by an Alfvén wave in one orbital period: πva(r)/Ω
where Ω(r) is the ring’s angular velocity and vA = B/(πρ)/is the Alfvén velocity. The finite
thickness of the disk sets a vertical cutoff making the longest wavelength equal to H(r), the disk
thickness.
If the gravitational field is dominated by the star, the disk thickness can be readily derived
as H(r) = cs(r)/Ω(r) (or H(r)/r = cs(r)/(rΩ(r))) where Ω(r) is given by the third Kepler
law9. As cs = γkBT/μmH, with γ the adiabatic index; μ the mean molecular weight, 2.4 as for a
molecular Hdisk; and mH the mass of a hydrogen atom,

This would set the basic scale for angular momentum transport at any given radius and thus,

Numerical simulations have been run to track down the nonlinear evolution of the MRI-
driven cascade and the energy released into disk heating. The local physics of the disk is
simulated in Cartesian boxes sheared by differential rotation where both tidal and Coriolis
forces are taken into account, the so-called shearing box. Regardless of the initial field geometry
and strength, even for weak field seeds, the simulations show that the magnetic and kinematic
fluctuations transport angular momentum at a rate proportional to the magnetic pressure thus,
the magnetic stress, −BrBϕ/π = αmagρv
A, with αmag ≃.−.. This prescription is consistent
with the α-prescription with α ∼.(Hawley et al. 1995). The effects on the MRI evolution
of the disk resistivity, the detailed analysis of the interaction between ions and neutrals in the
fluid or the Hall currents have been studied in the shearing box approach (see Hawley 2009 for
a recent review). Numerical simulations show that the turbulence depends on the sign of the
magnetic field threading the disk and that quiescent and MRI-active regions may coexist in a
complex dynamical structure that depends on the disk ionization degree.
The growth of MRI requires that the disk resistivity, η, satisfies η ≥vAH. In turn, η depends
on the electron fraction as: η = T/χ−
e cms−. Thus, the MRI is approximately suppressed

i.e., when the electron fraction is roughly below −or the magnetic Reynolds number
RM = vAH/η < (Gammie 1996). This electron fraction depends on the main ionization
sources and on the disk opacity to the environmental radiation. It is still unclear whether the
MRI can be supported over the full disk extent or whether dead zones do exist. The high
mass column of the dusty protostellar disks (≥1,000 g cm−) and the absence of strong inter-
nal sources of ionization may cause that dead and undead zones coexist. The ionization rates
expected from the various possible contributors are shown in > Fig. 6-10 from Turner and

above the disk on the axis. The disk coronal particle estimate corresponds to a fraction of 10−4 of
the energy released by mass accretion at a rate of 10−8M⊙year−1
Drake
(2009)
for a uniform gas column of 8 g cmas a function of the distance to the star. Cosmic ray prop-
agation provides uniform ionization rates across the disk that can be enhanced by as much as a
factor of a thousand in the proximity of a supernova remnant. The decay of radionuclides’ con-
tribution is negligible even for short-lived species (primarily Alwith half-life 0.717 Myr). The
main source of ionization within the inner 100 AU is the radiation released in the high-energy
processes associated with the star and the disk–star interaction region that penetrates through
the disk atmosphere toward the midplane.
Thus, the ionization degree of disks depends on their vertical structure that it is still poorly
constraint (see
>Sect. 3.6.2). There are, however, indications that turbulent mixing may be
able to prevent the formation of dead zones (Ilgner and Nelson 2008).

3.5.1 The α-Prescription and Angular Momentum Transport by
Gravitational Waves
Once massive disk-like structures form (in 1–3 free-fall times), they are especially prone
to gravitational waves and instabilities. Gravitational waves can effectively transport angular
momentum in a conservative manner, without dissipation, and they are a global phenomenon
that propagate over the whole disk as opposite to the α-disk model that is based on the
properties of turbulence, i.e., on the local dissipation of disturbances.
Gravitational instabilities and waves are a well-studied mean for angular momentum trans-
port via tidal torques (see Lin and Papaloizou 1996 for a review on angular momentum
transport mechanisms in disks). The simplest modes are one-armed spirals built from a pro-
gressive tilted sequence of elliptical orbits (Adams et al. 1989); however, they do not play a
dominant role in YSOs’ disks (Durisen et al. 2007). In general, non-axisymmetric disturbances
grow as multi-armed spirals that become unstable for Q < .(see >Fig. 6-11). Dissipation
is driven by compression and subsequent heating/cooling of the gas that can be enhanced by
shocks driving to a local dissipation of energy. Nonlinear wave coupling produces a wide spec-
trum of waves resulting in a cascade from single gravitational modes to a broad variety of
wavelengths and arms. Disks evolving under self-gravity tend to keep around Q ≃(Laughlin
and Bodenheimer 1994) and anomalous energy transport terms related with the gravitational
shear can become negligible supporting the use of the α-prescription to track the radial angular
momentum transport (Balbus and Papaloizou 1999). In this case a gravitational turbulence (or
gravito-turbulence) αg parameter can be defined. As an example, the tuned α-prescription used
to treat gravitational collapse in >Fig. 6-9 is set to keep Q between 1.3 and 1.5 assuming that
the disk evolves toward marginal gravitational instability and maintains it during its evolution.
This gravitational α or αg needs to be submitted to rapid variations during the beginning of
the gravitational collapse due to the rapid compression; however, after this period αg stabilizes
around 0.05 for a solar mass core.
The αg parameter can also be used to evaluate the disk stability against fragmentation; gravi-
tational waves can drive local compression that for a given disk opacity renders the disk unstable
producing disk fragmentation into protoplanets or brown dwarfs (see Goodwin’s chapter). In
thermal equilibrium, αg can be evaluated from the disk cooling time, τc, as:
αg =

γ(γ −)Ωτc
(6.1)
(Gammie 2001). Numerical simulations by Rice et al. (2005) suggest that only if αg < .
angular momentum transport is viable without driving to disk fragmentation.
In general, the disk dispersal timescale would be around 10years if only gravitational insta-
bilities are considered; however disk dispersal timescales derived from the observations are
significantly shorter ∼5 Myr (Haisch et al. 2001). MRI and gravitational instabilities have com-
plementary properties and their joint action, together with the disk irradiation and outflow,
could explain the main observed properties of protostellar disks.
3.6 Disk Structure: The Eﬀect of Stellar Irradiation

gravitational instabilitiesthat hasreached an asymptotic stateof thermal self-regulation. Themass
of the disk is 0.07 M⊙and it is orbiting around a 0.5 M⊙star
surface by the two main compounds of disks: dust and gas. Dust grains efficiently absorb UV
photons through the photoelectric effect, gas particles do it through the resonance transitions
of both molecules and atoms. A PhotoDissotiation Region (PDR) forms at the surface that has
its own dynamics and carves the disk surface producing photoevaporative flows. The penetra-
tion of the ionizing radiation toward the disk midplane depends on the disk opacity that is
dominated by dust grains at temperatures below 1,500 K (i.e., over most of the disk volume).
According to the penetration of the stellar high-energy radiation protostellar disks are divided
into three basic layers (see >Fig. 6-12):
•
Dense midplane: which is opaque to both X-ray and UV radiation and is ionized primarily
by cosmic ray particles.
•
Intermediate layer: which is opaque to UV radiation. The bottom of this layer will be defined
by the height at which fractional ionization begins to grow due to the stellar X-rays photons.
•
Atmosphere: which is transparent to the stellar UV radiation. The bottom of this layer will
be defined by the height at which fractional ionization begins to grow due to the stellar UV
photons.
The thickness of these layers and the location of the frontiers depends on the details of the
protostellar disk model: irradiation field, dust opacity, density, and temperaturelaws in the disk.

into the disk. Radiation impinging at the disk surface drops by a factor of 10−6 at the location of
the lines: top (UV), bottom (optical) (from Van Zadelhoﬀet al. 2003)
Solving the full structure of the disk is thus, a complex problem since many different processes
are coupled.
3.6.1 YSOs’X-ray and UV Radiation Field
The observed X-ray luminosity of YSOs is on average about erg s−and the energy distribu-
tion is well fitted by the thermal radiation of optically thin plasmas at temperatures of ∼5–30MK
(see i.e. Guedel 2008); for comparison the Solar X-ray luminosity is about 10erg s−and
the plasma temperatures 1–2 MK. In class I and II YSOs, the X-ray spectrum often shows the
contribution of two unrelated components subjected to very different absorption: a soft com-
ponent from a cool (1–2 MK) plasma that is barely absorbed and a much harder component
(10–30 MK) subjected to about ten times higher absorption. X-ray-induced iron Kα emission
from the disk has been detected from some YSOs, tracing directly the effect of X-ray irradiation
on the disk surface (Giardino et al. 2007).
The main effect of X-rayphotons is to ionize atomic hydrogen that ends shielding the disk to
the penetration of the X-ray radiation. Also, X-ray-induced photons produce the desorption of
formaldehyde (HCO)from grain surfaces. Chemical evolution models show that this process is
fundamental for the disk ionization (and coupling to the magnetic field) since HCO+ becomes
the dominant ion in the intermediate layer of the disk in timescales comparable to the disk
evolution timescales (about 10years).

Young Stellar Objects and Protostellar Disks
The UV luminosity of YSOs is ill determined. During the early phases heavy dust extinction
prevents measuring directly the UV radiation field and only indirect measurements are avail-
able based on the chemical modeling of disks. The radiative UV output from massive YSOs
(O to A spectral types) can be modeled using blackbody spectral energy distributions but the
UV spectrum of low mass YSOs is dominated by the extended magnetosphere/atmosphere
and it is poorly constraint from the observations. Typically, line fluxes of TTSs are a factor
of 50 stronger than their main sequence analogues (see Gómez de Castro 2009 and references
therein). Accretion also contributes to the UV excess of TTS and HAeBe stars (see >Sect. 4).
UV radiation interacts strongly with matter in the disk. Hdissociates through absorption
in the Lyman and Werner bands (912–1,100 Å range). As His the main component of proto-
stellar disks, its response to the UV radiation field etches the surface of the disk. Unfortunately,
very few observations are available of TTSs (Herczeg et al. 2002; Wilkinson et al. 2002) and
Herbig stars (Martin-Zaidi et al. 2008) in the 912–1,100 Å range. The absorption of UV pho-
tons is followed by UV and IR fluorescence that has been detected from the disk of several TTSs
(Herczeg et al. 2004). Only about 15% of the photons lead to Hphotodissociation. The neutral
gas is ionized by the Lyman continuum radiation that heats it to some 10,000 K surpassing the
escape velocity from the disk surface (see >Sect. 3.8).
UV photons are also absorbed/scattered by the dust and dust grains get charged through
the photoelectric effect releasing high-energy electrons that heat collisionally the plasma. The
kinetic energy of the photoelectrons depends on the hardness of the illuminating UV spectrum
since the dust absorption cross section covers a broad spectral range; dust extinction peaks at
about 750 Å and declines toward X-rays (Laor and Draine 1993)with a characteristic absorption
cross section in the Lyman continuum as ∼.× −cm−. The photoelectric charging of the
dust grains produces a population of secondary fast photoelectrons in the atmosphere of the
disk whose characteristics depend on the illuminating radiation field. In >Fig. 6-13a, the most
characteristic ionizing spectra in the YSO’s environments are plotted. Blackbodies at 50,000 and
10,000 K represent roughly the energy distribution of O-type and A-type YSOs. The fit to the
galactic UV background based on early UV missions (Draine 1978) is also plot. Finally, a high-
energy spectrum has been built by assuming that the X-ray radiation of the TTSs is produced
by magnetic reconnection in a clumpy corona. The interaction of the X-ray photons with the
dense (∼cm−) clumps produces the UV spectrum plotted. The charging profiles of the dust
grains are shown in >Fig. 6-13b.
3.6.2 The Vertical Structure of Disks
The innermost region of the YSO’s disk is heavily disturbed by the interaction with the stellar
magnetospherein TTSs (see
>Sect. 4) and by the stellar radiation field in HAeBe stars. Further
out, disks can be treated as rather simple structures. In the absence of dead zones, most of
the accretion energy is expected to be released at the disk midplane that cools mainly by dust
continuum radiation in the infrared range. At the same time, the disk is heated from above
(from the atmosphere to the midplane) by the high-energy radiation produced in the inner
region (star, magnetosphere, inner outflow).
In a first approach, D’Alessio et al. (1998) computed the vertical structure of an stationary
α-disk irradiated by a TTS with effective temperature 4,000 K. Cosmic rays and radioactive
decaywere alsoconsidered as sources ofdisk ionization. At everygiven radius, the disk is treated
as a stratified, plane-parallel atmosphere. Viscous dissipation in the α-disks occurs locally, and

the energy rate generated per unit volume is computed assuming α = .and an accretion
rate of −M⊙year−. Stellar photons are assumed to enter in the disk at grazing angles as in
a flared disk.10 A fraction of the stellar radiation is scattered at the upper boundary of the disk
creating a diffuse field at the disk surface; it is assumed that gas and dust are thermally coupled
in the disk.
With this provision, this simple model already shows that irradiation from the central star
is the dominant heating agent farther than some 5 AU. As a result the temperature distribution
of the disk changes from T(r) ∝r−/to T(r) ∝r−/and the disk becomes less dense than in
the purely viscous case. In this model, the disk temperature has a vertical inversion caused by
the properties of the dust opacity. Dust is more opaque to the optical stellar spectrum than to the
infrared radiation produced by itself to release the viscous heating. This creates a superheated
layer above the disk photosphere where most of the stellar radiative energy is spent into dust
heating. In >Fig. 6-14, the temperature law, surface density, and scale height are compared for
irradiated and nonirradiated accretion disks.
The D’Alessio et al. (1998) model has been extensively used as a baseline to study disk chem-
istryand ionization state. Forinstance, Van Zadelhoffet al. (2003)used the densityand tempera-
ture structure of the disk derived from 1-D modeling to compute in more detail the propagation
of UV radiation into the disk interior. From this, the vertical distribution of molecules is com-
puted for different disk radii and stellar irradiation fields. As shown in >Fig. 6-15, the vertical
distribution of some molecules is very sensitive to the UV irradiation field. In the absence of a
significant UV radiation field, the CO photodissociation rate becomes small and the molecule
survives further in the disk atmosphere. As a result, the column densities of abundant radicals
such as CN or CN decrease in the inner regions due to the smaller supply of atomic carbon.
The chemical timescale is very short in the disk midplane since adsorption on dust grains dom-
inates the chemistry ∼yr (cm−/nH); however, in the intermediate layer steady state is

Vertical distribution of molecules at R = 105 AU and t = 1 Myr structure of an irradiated disk (after
Van Zadelhoﬀet al. 2003). Top, the disk is assumed to be irradiated by the spectrum of a TTS from
1,000 to 10,000Å. Bottom, the disk is assumed to be irradiated with Draine’s (1978) spectrum
reached in 10–10years for many organic molecules and this timescale is significantly larger
than the UV flux variability timescales (days to years).
The ionization structure of the disk has also been calculated based on this simple 1-D model
(Semenov et al. 2004) who found a dead region between 2 and 20 AU where the ionization
fraction is not high enough tokeepthe gas coupled tothe magneticfield. In this area, MRI would
not grow keeping the disk midplane cooler than in the standard α-model and preventing mass
transport. This raised concerns on the applicability of the MRI to the cool and dense protostellar
disks and drove to the development of new disk models that take into account vertical mixing
between the midplane and the irradiated disk surface. Ilgner and Nelson (2008) have made use
of a simplified chemical model for the gas phase chemistry to code in the ionization fraction
evolution in a sheared box–based model of a magnetized accretion disk. The chemical model
is based on charge exchange reactions between Hand Mg (Oppenheimer and Dalgarno 1974)
that are well suited to follow the electron fraction in the disk (Ilgner and Nelson 2006). For a
fiducial temperature of 100 K, the charge transfer reaction (H+
+ Mg →H+Mg+) occurs at a
rate that is about 1% of the H+
recombination rate. As the recombination rate of Mg+ is five
orders of magnitude lower than of H+
, a Mg-rich gas will sustain better a higher ionization
fraction favoring MRI development. The model does not take into account the ionization of the
disk surface by UV radiation and considers a Mg abundance slightly below the solar. With these
provisions, the numerical calculations led to a fully turbulent disk with no dead zones.
A full disk modeling including the MRI cascade to turbulence, disk irradiation, and the
microphysics of the dissipative processes is yet to be done.

3.7 Disk Stability
Some TTSs are observed to suffer nova-like outburst. They are named FUOrs as the proto-
type of the class: FU Ori. During the outburst, the system brightens by several magnitudes
(≥4 magnitudes in V) followed by a decade-long fading (see Abraham et al. 2004 for a compila-
tion of these sources). The transport rate typically rises to 10−M⊙year−during the outburst
(Hartmann and Kenyon 1996).
Disk emission dominates at all the wavelengths during outburst suggesting that YSOs’ disks
are prone to strong instabilities. Disk instability triggering can be intrinsic to the disk or extrin-
sic. Extrinsic instabilities are driven by the close passage of nearby stars or the presence of
a companion in a wide, highly eccentric orbit. Accretion disks may also render unstable by
thermal instabilities and frontier instabilities related with the coexistence of two transport
mechanisms (MRI and gravitational waves) in the disk.
Thermal instabilities are driven by strong enhancements of the disk opacity as the tem-
perature rises locally. The α-prescription relates the accretion rate with the local disk tem-
perature; thus, as the temperature rises, the effective local mass flux also increases and the
hot regions begin to propagate radially through the disk on a timescale τp
∼r/αcs
∼
year(r/.AU)/(cs/kms)−years for α = −. During the outburst, the ionized regions
deplete on the viscous diffusion timescale, ∼r/ν ∼(Ω/cs)τp, that is about ten times the prop-
agation timescale. The opacity of protostellar disks is not a smooth function of the temperature
but shows strong jumps between the dust melting point and the onset of scattering by atomic
hydrogen as the main source of opacity. After dust grains melting (above ∼1,500 K), the opacity
drops by about four orders of magnitude; however as the temperature increases from 2,000 to
10,000 K the opacity rises by eight orders of magnitude(!) by the onset of hydrogen scattering.
Thus, a variation on the accretion rate enough to drive the inner disk to the dust melting point
have strong effects on the disk structure. Bell and Lin (1994) developed the first models for
this process based on work done for outburst generation in accretion disks within cataclysmic
variables. However, the model requires very high accretion rates and very low α(≃−) to
reproduce the observations that are unusual for protostellar disks (see Bell and Lin 1995; Turner
et al. 1997 for later developments).
Another unstable regime can be built in the disk if there is a physical boundary separating
an MRI-dominated accretion flow in the inner disk from a gravitational instability–dominated
flow in the outer disk. Material could pile up at this border and cause the temperature in the
inner disk to rise to remain gravitationally stable (to keep Q ∼). Once hot enough, the increase
of the ionization fraction would onset the MRI producing an accretion outburst (Armitage et al.
2001).
3.8 Disk Evolution
Two competing scenarios have been proposed to drive disk evolution:
•
Cool evolution driven by gravity
•
Hot evolution that takes into account the effect of the stellar radiation field into disk
photoevaporation
Cool evolution is driven by the exhaust of remnant material in the molecular core to feed the disk
with fresh gas for accretion. Typical models follow the evolution of the rotating protostellar core

under self-gravity with some simplifying assumptions to make the problem tractable (Yorke and
Bodenheimer 1999; Yorke and Sonnhalter 2002; Young and Evans 2005). The energy sources
are identified: star (accretion and deuterium burning), disk (accretion, direct infall of gas from
the envelope), and star–disk boundary layer. Radiative transfer within the dusty envelope is
computed and from that, the main observables are determined. The two main observables are
the so-called bolometric temperature of the YSO and its bolometric luminosity. The bolometric
temperature is defined as the temperature of a blackbody with the same flux-weighted mean
frequency as the source:

Tbol tracks the evolution of the SED, from the heavily weighted to the far infrared SEDs of class 0
YSOs, to the optically weighted SEDs of class III YSOs, already very close to the zero age main
sequence (ZAMS). The boundaries of the YSOs’ classes were redefined according to Tbol (Chen
et al. 1995) as follows:
Class 0: Tbol < K
Class I: 70 K ≤Tbol ≤K
Class II: 650 K < Tbol ≤, K
Class III: Tbol > , K
The evolutionary tracks and the class boundaries are plotted in >Fig. 6-16 as well as the
ZAMS (from Dunham et al. 2010). The 1,024 YSOs detected in a major infrared survey of
star forming regions (Evans et al. 2009) is overploted. The evolutionary tracks for 1 M⊙and
3 M⊙protostellar cores are represented for two families of models, Young and Evans (2005)
and Myers et al. (1998), where accretion rates are prescribed to decrease exponentially with
time. The low luminosity of class 0 sources evidence unexpectedly low accretion rates ≤10−M⊙
year−suggesting that accretion could be episodic in nature since the very early phases.
Hot evolution: the impact of the stellar radiation field into disk evolution is taken into
account. UV radiation is very efficient at etching the disk surface by producing a thermal
flow. The tenuous gas in the disk atmosphere is ionized and heated to temperatures of ∼10K.
The thermal velocity of the gas reaches typically Vth ∼.km s−leading to a slow photoevap-
orative flow at radii, rs, where the thermal speed surpasses the escape velocity from the disk
surface: rs = .AU M∗
M⊙(Vth/.kms−)−. When the dynamics of the process is analyzed, it
is shown that the flow crosses the sonic point if r > .rs (Font et al. 2004). The mass-loss rate
in photoevaporative outflows can be roughly estimated as:

where CLyc is the count ratein the Lyman continuum (Hollenbach et al. 1994). However, as soon
as hydrogen recombines, the flow itself may shield the upper layers of the disk atmosphere to
the UV radiation. A measure of the opacity of the photoevaporative flow to Lyman continuum
photons can be given by the parameter:

Once the irradiation field photoevaporates the inner disk, viscous spreading tends to move
matter to this area accelerating disk dissipation. The evolution of disks is modeled through the

where the vertical structure is neglected and an extra term is added to the initial Lynden-Bell
and Pringle (1974) formulation to account for the impact of photoevaporative flows. As shown
in > Fig. 6-17 from Alexander et al. (2006), there is a rapid transition in the disk structure
at ∼6 Myrs. Once the inner hole is excavated the spread of the inner cavity drives to full disk
photoevaporation in few 10years.

PMS Evolution: The Outﬂow
Outflow is the first signature of star formation however, no theory anticipated it prior to the
discovery of the bipolar molecular outflow from L1551 by Snell et al. 1980. A decade later,

outflows are ejected as early as during Phase II. The collimation and mechanical power of the

in 6 Myr, the area at R = 1 AU is evacuated
outflows decreases as stars approach the main sequence and protostellar disks evolve into debris
disks as shown in >Fig. 6-18.
The tracers of the outflows depend on the degree of evolution of the parent source. Flows
from young class 0/I sources often contain molecules such as H, CO, and SiO. Later on, they
tend to be dominated by HI and low-ionization metals that show as prominent large-scale
jets detected at optical wavelengths ([S II], [N II], or Hα lines). Mass-loss rates decline from
∼−M⊙year−in the class 0 YSOs, to ∼−M⊙year−in class I, and ∼−M⊙year−in
class II. Typically, the outflow mass-loss rate is about a 10% of the accretion rate and the velocity
about few hundred km s−.
The main mechanical properties of bipolar outflows have been recently redetermined from
the large data base of known CO outflows (Wu et al. 2004):
•
The mass carried out by the outflows, Mw,CO, correlates strongly with the bolometric lumi-
nosities of the outflow powering source, Lbol. The flow mass increases with the luminosity
as a power law: log Mw,CO = (−.± .) + (.± .) log Lbol.
•
The mechanical force needed to accelerate the outflow (Fw,CO =
˙Mw,COVw,CO) is larger
than the radiative force from the parent YSO: Lbol/c. There is, however, a clear correlation
between mechanical and radiative power from the source: log Fw,CO = (−.± .) +
(.± .) log Lbol.
These relations (see >Fig. 6-19) indicate that accretion, the major source of energy during star
formation, powers the formation of outflows. Moreover, these relations hold from low mass

masses.
YSOs’ outflows transfer momentum and entrain material from their surrounding molec-
ular core/cloud by means of shock waves that propagate into the medium. Typical velocities
are about few hundred km s−and produce prominent shock-excited nebulosities known as
Herbig–Haro objects (or HHOs, see Reipurth 1999 for a catalog). HHOs are classified according
to their electron temperature into two main groups: low excitation HHOs with log(Te(K)) ≤
and high excitation HHOs with log(Te(K)) ≥..
Low excitation HHOs are the result of mild oblique shocks mainly produced along the jet
beam, as material from the surrounding cloud is entrained into the flow (see > Fig. 6-20).
HHOs’ gas enters the shock front at several tens of km s−and most of the kinetic energy is
damped into the excitation of the Hvibrational bands (in the infrared) as well as in radiation

from the neutral/singly ionized species ([O I] and [S II] are among the most prominent opti-
cal tracers). The electron densities are 10–10cm−and the gas is only partially ionized with
typical electron fractions of 0.1. Most of the molecular emission in the large-scale CO flows
is also produced by gas entrained and accelerated in mild shocks. However, it is still unclear
whether there is an additional, large scale, slow component made of rarified gas to the bipolar
flow (Bachiller and Tafalla 1999).
High excitation HHOs mainly trace the bow shock or the working surface of the jet in high
density environments. The kinetic energy of the jet is damped into heating producing very high
temperatures that may reach ∼10K as observed in HH 2 (see >Fig. 6-21). They may radiate
from X-rays, in the most extreme cases, to the high excitation lines in the ultraviolet (i.e., He II
o N V) and in the optical (i.e., [O III]). The electron densities are typically 10–10cm−and
the gas is fully ionized. However, the predictions of strong radiative shock models are unable to
reproduce fully the observations (Raymond et al. 1997), though this could be caused by the poor

spatial resolution of the UV spectroscopic observations and the high clumpiness of HHOs. As
an example, the UV-optical monitoring of HH 29 allowed to measure the inhomogeneity of the
flow (Liseau et al. 1996) driving to a two-phase model of HHOs with a hot and dense component
with T = K and ne = cm−embedded into low excitation component at T = K and
ne = cm−. The estimated filling factor of the high excitation component was very small,
barely ∼0.1–1%.
Jets as large as 1–10 pc have been observed (i.e., the 10 pc flows detected in Orion; Reipurth
et al. 1998). They provide the chance to study the midterm evolution of outflow (and accretion)
on timescales of 5–50 × year with a time resolution of ∼10 years. As shown in >Fig. 6-21,
episodic ejections are common to all the YSOs’ outflows. In fact, the collimated jets seem to
result of the overlap of several shocked structures or knots. High activity and quiescent periods
alternate during the flow evolution. Precession has been detected in a few sources (i.e., Cep E,
Eisloffel et al. 1996) as well as bendings and misalignments suggesting variations in the outflow
ejection direction. There are also indications of outflow rotation (Coffey et al. 2004). Evidence
of magnetic fields have been reported for the outflow from T Tau S (Ray et al. 1997) and from
several radio sources (Curiel et al. 1993).
4.1 First Steps to a Mechanism for Outﬂow Generation: Disk Winds
The high kinetic energy of the outflow requires an efficient launching mechanism that acts from
the beginning of Phase II powered by accretion. The low effective gravity of the disk, the increas-
ing centrifugal force as the stargrows, and the disk ionization bythe radiation from the accretion
shocks creates the ideal environment to develop centrifugally driven outflows from the disk
along the magnetic field lines permeating it.
Centrifugally driven outflows were first proposed in the context of Solar System research.
The Sun is able to accelerate outflows from its slowly rotating atmosphere to ∼400 km s−at
the Earth orbit. These outflows depart through open holes in the magnetic configuration of
the Sun. As the solar material is magnetized and, hence, firmly attached to the field lines, it
leaves the Sun speeding up along the field lines like the water drops ejected from the nozzles of
a rotating sprinkler. This magnetized outflow rotates rigidly with the Sun as far as the Alfvén
radius, where the flow speed surpasses the Alfvén speed, i.e., the velocity at which information is
transported in the magnetized flow (Weber and Davis 1967). Afterward, the flow evolves freely
at this high speed. An important aspect of centrifugally driven winds is that they transport
angular momentum away from the star. As the gas is forced to corotate with the star up to the
Alfvén radius, rA, it transports a specific angular momentum, lA = Ω∗r
A.
Blandford and Payne (1982) developed a version of centrifugally driven MHD winds for
accretion disks. In their model, each ring of the disk is treated as a separate entity that rotates
with Keplerian velocity. The disk is assumed to be permeated by an external field entering the
disk in grazing incidence, as shown in the >Fig. 6-22. Matter is loaded onto the lines and accel-
erated by the centrifugal lever arm. As the Solar MHD centrifugally driven winds, disk winds
also carry a specific angular momentum for each ring given by lA = κΩK,Ar
A, where ΩK,Ar
A is
the specific angular momentum at the Alfvén point and κ is a factor that depends on the pre-
cise geometry of the solution and ranges between 14 and 19 for simple self-similar solutions.
Notice that the lever arm for angular momentum removal by MHD centrifugally driven winds
is rA, significantly larger than the level arm for viscous dissipation within the α-prescription,

ﬁeld line is larger than the gravitational force, matter leaves the disk along the ﬁeld lines and it is
accelerated as far as the Alfvén radius
just αH. As a result, disk winds are an efficient mean to transport angular momentum and build
up rapidly transport in YSOs’ disks.
Disk winds extend the nested rings set up of the α-prescription for YSOs’ disks into a nested
Russian-dolls scheme that includes the large-scale outflow as a set of plasma sheets anchored
in each ring (see >Fig. 6-23). The velocity of matter flowing along this plasma sheet is usually
projected into the three cylindrical components: rotation around the disk axis, expansion away
from the rotation axis, and collimated motion along the axis. These components and their man-
ifestation into unresolved line profiles are shown also in the figure. The dominant kinematics
at the base of the outflow is radial expansion that produces very broad double-peaked profiles,
rotation is only dominant very close to the Alfvén point and produces narrower double-peaked
profiles, and further up, the dominant velocity is motion along the disk axis with a velocity
∼ΩK,ArA.

An interesting outcome is that outflows can only be generated in a very narrow range of plasma

MRI ceases for β > .
The temperature of the outflow is regulated by three processes: (1) the rapid adiabatic radial
expansion at the base, (2) heating by ambipolar diffusion, and (3) photoionization by the star.
Ambipolar diffusion heating depends on the electron fraction of the wind. The higher the
electron fraction, the smaller the heating. In YSOs’ outflows, this results in an equilibrium tem-
perature of about 10,000 K similar to that observed in the optical jets (Garcia et al. 2001; Safier
1993). However, if wind photoionization by the stellar X-ray photons is taken into account, the
base of wind can reach temperatures of few thousand Kelvins (Ferro-Fontán and Gómez de Cas-
tro 2003). As shown in the >Fig. 6-24, disk winds shield effectively the disk surface, protecting
it from the high-energy X-ray photons from the star. In fact, they act as a protective layer that
transforms the hard energy from the star into a milder (1,000–3,000 K) radiation field before it
can reach the disk surface providing a wide spread source of heating of the disk atmosphere.
Disk winds are kept collimated by the pinching stress derived from the Lorentz force ⃗J × ⃗B,
where ⃗J is the current driven by the flow, mainly along the disk axis, and ⃗B is the magnetic
field in the flow, mainly toroidal around the disk axis. This is a rich source of possible plasma
large-scale instabilities, especially as flows depart from several radii in the disk. Pelletier and
Pudritz (1992) showed that if the magnetic flux in the disk goes like r−/, disk winds are stable
since the same current is carried at all radii.12 Typically the mass-loss rates estimated from disk
winds modeling are about 10% of the accretion rate, in good agreement with the observational
estimates.
YSOs’ observations show that jets are not smooth laminar flows; instead, they show vari-
able structures and knots. Some attempts were made in the past to reproduce this behavior
through disk winds. Gómez de Castro and Pudritz (1993) showed that the unresolved forbid-
den line emission from jets could be produced by shocks at the magnetic refocusing points
of disk winds. Garcia et al. (2001) and Ferreira and Casse (2004) attempted to reproduce the
large-scale properties of jets by warm disk winds. In general, the coexistence of flows at differ-
ent velocities from different disk radii, the interaction with the environment, and the pinching
stresses are a rich source of oblique shocks and nonlinear interactions, especially amenable to
numerical simulations, that can reproduce a large wealth of the observed phenomenology (see
Pudritz et al. 2007 for a recent review in the field).
However, the observations clearly show that YSOs’ bipolar outflows have a strong episodic
component. The recognition that the interaction between the magnetosphere of a TTS and the
disk would generate in a natural manner episodic ejections drove to the current paradigm for
YSOs’ outflow generation.
4.2 The Star–Disk Interface: The Jet Engine
Monitorings to derive the rotation rates of YSOs during Phase III revealed the existence of hot
spots at temperatures of about K on the surface of some TTSs (Bouvier 1990). This was
further confirmed by UV monitorings (see Gómez de Castro 1998 for a review) raising the
temperature of the spots to some , K upon the detection of the flux modulation in the
CIV line. In 1991, Koenigl showed that hot spots would be naturally produced if the accretion

flow from the disk is channeled by the stellar magnetic field onto the star. The stellar field is
assumed to be anchored in the inner part of the disk creating a sheared layer between the rigid
body rotation of the star and the Keplerian rotation of the disk. This interaction has a profound
influence on the star and the accretion flow but also acts as a dynamo that transforms part of the
angular momentum excess in the inner disk into magnetic field amplification that self-regulates
through quiescent periods of field building up and eruptions when the energy excess is released.
The basic physics is rather simple: the stellar magnetic field acts like the magneto in the
dynamo that is able to drive currents by means of the Lorentz force into the material falling
under the action of gravity. There are, however, a great number of uncertainties in the way the
system self-regulates and also on the dependence of the engine details on the initial condi-
tions such as the effective gravity of the star, the role of stellar radiation and magnetic field on
the engine performance, and the role of the ionizing radiation produced by the engine on the
evolution of the mass storage, the disk.
Going forwards on time: the Sun, itself, provides important clues to understand the physics
of this gravito-magnetic engine and its evolution. At the base of the Sun convective layer, the
tachocline marks the location of the shear layer between the rigid body rotation of the radia-
tive core and the differentially rotating convective envelope. The radial gradient of the angular

velocity changes sign becoming negative for latitudes >35○and positive above this latitude. This
latitude marks the limit of the two latitude belts where the overwhelming majority of sunspots
occur. There are also some indications of the meridional flow moving equatorward below this
latitude and poleward above it (see Miesch 2005). The Solar wind is (magnetic) latitude depen-
dent during solar minimum; above ∼35○is fast (1,000 km s−) and thin, below ∼35○is slow
(300 km s−) and dense (see > Fig. 6-25 from Ulysses data). The current paradigm for how
solar dynamo operates includes: (1) field amplification in a turbulent downflow (α effect) that is
pumped downward by convection and accumulated in the overshoot region and the tachocline;

tion in the tachocline; (3) magnetic instabilities (buoyancy) drives the field to the surface, and
(4) the Coriolis force acting on the rising structures to produce a latitude-dependentemergence
of bipolar magnetic structures.
Going backward in time, during star formation, there is an “external tachocline” or differ-
entially rotating region attached to the stellar surface (the outer part of the convective layer).
This external tachocline connects the star with the accretion disk which rotates significantly
more slowly than the stellar surface; rotation periods of TTSs are about 7–8 days (Ω∗= .−.

uncertainties in the physics, namely, the ratio between the toroidal and the poloidal components
and the relative thickness of the external tachocline, are enclosed in this factor.
As in the Solar interior, the shear region is fed by turbulent, magnetized material, though in
YSOs, this comes from the accretion disk. Shear amplifies the field producing a strong toroidal
component and a dynamo sets in an extended stellar magnetosphere. This toroidal field and the
associated magnetic pressure push the field lines outward from the disk rotation axis, inflating
and opening them in a butterfly-alike pattern reminiscent of the helmet streamers in the solar
corona. As a result, a current layer is produced between the region dominated by a hot and
thin stellar wind and the area where the disk wind is ejected from as displayed in >Fig. 6-26.
Magnetic field dissipation in the current layer produces high-energy radiation and particles.
The magnetic link between the star and the disk is broken and reestablished continuously by
magnetic reconnection as shown in the figure. The opening angle of the current layer, as well
as its extent, depends on the stellar and disk fields, the accretion rate, and the ratio between the
inner disk radius and the stellar rotation frequencies. Hot, pressure-driven outflows are pro-
duced from the region closer to the rotation axis while centrifugally driven flows are produced
by the disk; plasmoids are ejected from the current layer generating a third outflowing episodic
component.
Disk–star interaction has been investigated since the early concepts of X-winds (see Shu
et al. 2000 for a review) to the numerical simulations by Goodson et al. (1997) and the last

The interaction between the stellar magnetic ﬁeld and the disk twists the stellar ﬁeld lines due to
the diﬀerential rotation. The toroidal magnetic ﬁeld generated out of the poloidal ﬂux and the
associated pressure tends to push the ﬁeld lines outward, inﬂating them, and eventually brak-
ing the magnetic link between the star and the disk (boundary between Regions I and II). Three
basic regions can be deﬁned: Region I dominated by the stellar wind, Region II dominated by the
disk wind, and Region III dominated by stellar magnetospheric phenomena. The dashed line traces
the boundaries between these three regions. The continuous lines indicate the topology of the
ﬁeld and the shadowed areas represent regions where magnetic reconnection events are likely to
occur, producing high-energy radiation and particles. UV radiation released by the plasma heated

results (i.e., von Rekowski and Brandenburg 2006). They show that the fundamental mechanism
for disk winds formation is robust; numerical simulations with different parameters (disk/star
fields) and initial conditions produce disk winds. Stellar winds are much more sensitive to the
physical conditions and, especially, to the stellar field. The characteristics of the accretion flow
and the winds (dominant driver, temperature, terminal velocity, density, variability) depend
on the physical properties of the system such as the degree of magnetization of the disk, the
characteristics of the disk dynamo, and the stellar field. During Phase III, the bulk of the energy
losses of the engine are radiated at UV and X-ray wavelengths as in the Sun atmosphere (though
a large fraction of the high energy radiation is reprocessed to longer wavelengths in the YSOs
environment at early stages).
This paradigm is based (and inspired) in the Sun thus, naturally, applies to low mass
YSOs with well-defined stellar fields; it is yet unclear how to adapt it to HAeBe stars and,
in general, to massive YSOs. However, Ae Herbig stars have a rich UV emission-line spec-
trum consistent with the presence of a chromosphere above the photosphere (Brown et al.
1996; Deleuil et al. 2005). Also, overionized species (transition region or corona-like) are
observed. Magnetic field dissipation seems the most likely source for the radiative losses in
the chromosphere/wind that represent 4–8% of the stellar bolometric luminosity according
to Bouret and Catala (1998), although accretion flows may be a non-negligible energy source
(Blondel et al. 1993). Marginal detection of magnetic fields has been reported for HD 104237
(Donati et al. 1997).
Further evidence to the presence of magnetic fields in the Ae Herbig stars atmospheres
comes from the detection of azimuthal structures in the wind of AB Aur (Praderie et al. 1986).
They are best interpreted resourcing, again, to the Solar wind and assuming that the very hot
clumps are produced in the shocks between a “high” velocity component made by streamers
of magnetically confined gas and a dense and “slow” outflow driven by radiation. In this sense,
the hot clumps would be tracing a PMS analogue to the Solar Corotating Interaction Regions
(CIRs). Evidence of such a class of structures has also been found in a Class III TTS: AB Dor
(Gómez de Castro 2009).
Though observations suggest that fields are present in Ae Herbig stars, at least, during the
first ∼5 ×years of their PMS evolution, the ultimate source of the field remains unidentified.
Turbulence and rotation could set up a dynamo in the outer stellar layers. Turbulence can be
generated by stellar pulsation; radial and nonradial modes have been detected with periods
from some tens of minutes to hours (see Catala 2003 for a review). Also, the rotational braking
produced by the strong stellar wind could induce turbulent motions below the stellar surface,
forcing magnetic fields into the outer stellar layers (Lignieres et al. 1996).
Accretion is not expected to be the only driver of the outflow in these luminous sources.
Radiatively driven winds are also able to produce collimated outflows provided there is a
magnetic field (Rotstein and Gimenez de Castro 1996).
4.3 The Stellar Magnetosphere
The stellar magnetosphere is the key structure in the engine. Magnetic fields of few kG have been
detected in the surface of the TTSs (Guenther et al. 1999; Johns-Krull et al. 1999). The surface
field is not bipolar but has a rather complex structure as in the Sun (Johns-Krull et al. 2004).
Higher order multipolar components fall off more rapidly with radius than the dipolar field
hypothesized for the engine, making extremely difficult to track the path followed by matter

327
from the inner disk border to the stellar surface. In addition, the magnetosphere has its own
dynamics and forcing due to the interaction with the disk.
4.3.1 Accretion Shocks and Funnels
The accretion flow has a clearly identifiable episodic component produced by the capture of
material from the inner border of the disk into magnetic loops or funnels that drive it into the
stellar surface. The kinetic energy of the infalling material is released into heating at the impact
point. As matter infall occurs along the field lines, all the gravitational energy is damped into
heating and the gas may reach temperatures as high as ∼10K. The dominant output radiation
is produced by the photoionized preshock infalling gas radiating mainly in the UV range; the
shock front itself radiates in soft X-rays (Gullbring et al. 2000; Lamzin 1998). As the density of
the infalling gas column is high (ne ≃−cm−) the thickness of the radiating column is
expected to be negligible compared with the stellar radius; thus, accretion shocks are observed
as hot spots on the stellar surface. As such, they are expected to produce a rotationally mod-
ulated signal at high energies that is especially strong at the shortest wavelengths (see Petrov
et al. 2001 or Bouvier et al. 2003 for optical monitorings and Gómez de Castro 1998 for UV
monitorings). A soft X-ray excess is reported for actively accreting TTSs that would trace the
location of the ∼10K shock front (Guedel and Telleschi 2007). The presence of infalling gas
cloudlets is detected in the redwing of the line profiles of many species tracing warm plasma
(Hα, Mg II, Ca II, etc.); however, there are very few monitorings tracking the motion of gas
parcels as they fall onto the star, and when this is done, a correlation is found between accretion
and outflow (RU Lup: Stempels and Piskunov 2002; RW Aur: Gómez de Castro and Verdugo
2003 and AA Tau: Bouvier et al. 2007). Four interesting features have been derived from the
observations:
1. The interaction between the magnetosphere and the disk may drive to the formation of
warps in the inner disk as reported for AA Tau (Bouvier et al. 2003).
2. The end points of the accretion funnels cover just a few percent of the stellar surface (Bouvier
et al. 2007).
3. Accretion flows may switch on or switch off on timescales of a few years without large vari-
ations in the overall properties of the star or the disk as observed in RY Tau (Gómez de
Castro 2009).
4. The hot plasma (< log Te(K) < ) tracers registering the accretion shocks, as for instance
the He I 10830 (Fischer et al. 2008) or the UV lines, indicate that there is an extended mag-
netospheric component in addition to the accretion shock emission. Only ∼50% of the UV
continuum excess is rotationally modulated (Gómez de Castro 2009).
4.3.2 General Magnetospheric Properties
Unfortunately, the characteristics of the TTSs extended magnetospheres are still escaping the
diagnosis (see Hartmann 2009). Further to some qualitative properties as that outlined in
the sketch in
> Fig. 6-26, little is known about TTSs magnetospheres apart from having
a density of about –cm−and an electron temperature between some few thousand
Kelvin and 100,000 K. The line widths of typical atmospheric/magnetospheric tracers are about

328 6
Young Stellar Objects and Protostellar Disks
200–300 km s−that exceed by far what was expected from thermal broadening or from rota-
tional broadening even if the lines are assumed to be formed in a corotating magnetosphere
that extends to some 4–5 stellar radii.
The source ofthese large broadenings remains evasive since the verybeginning ofthe studies
of TTSs atmospheres. In the 1980s, line broadening was modeled with macro turbulence fields
in a very massive outflow (Calvet et al. 1985). Later on, magnetospheric accretion was proposed
to explain the large broadening of the TTSs Hα lines (Muzerolle et al. 1998). Infall adds an extra
radial velocity component to the rotation of the radiating gas that has an effect in the line pro-
files somewhat similar to that shown in >Fig. 6-23 for the outflow. As free-fall velocities are
comparable to the broadening13, the observe profile widths can be reproduced without diffi-
culty tuning the curvature of the plasma trajectory from the inner disk into the stellar surface.
However, there must be a dependence on the inclination that has not been clearly identified on
the spectrally resolved observations of magnetospheres. As of today, it is still unclear whether
the broadening is produced by unresolved macroscopic flows or by magnetic waves propagat-
ing on the magnetospheric field. In general, the broadening of magnetospheric tracers does not
vary significantly pointing out that the average motions are rather stable. The combined effect
of funnel flows and inclined magnetic rotators as simulated by Romanova et al. (2004) is the
current baseline for the numerical simulation of TTSs magnetospheres.
Magnetospheres are assumed to produce the truncation of the inner disk producing the
observed holes in the molecular gas distribution (see >Sect. 3). As the disk is not unlocked
from the magnetosphere, it is expected to be subjected to the propagation of the Alfvén waves,
shear waves, and global alfvén oscillations driven from the interface. The inner rim of the disk
is expected to be hot with temperatures of about K. Evidence for such a structure has been
found only in RW Aur (Gómez de Castro and Verdugo 2003).
5
Some Final Thoughts and Conclusions
Star, disk, and outflow are the three components of a basic gravitational engine. The star grows
out of the accretion flow and it is the most stable element of the system. After reaching a critical
mass, the spheroid reaches hydrostatic equilibrium and any collision or dramatic event lead-
ing to the partial or total disruption of the disk will just reduce its final mass making the star
formation process just more inefficient. Thus stars and disk ages do not always match.
Disks have a profound effect on stellar evolution since the magnetic interaction between the
star and the disk controls the evolution of angular momentumduring star formation. As soon as
the star–disk locking is released,YSOs follow the hydrostatic contraction to the ZAMS speeding
up as the radius decreases and the mass distribution in the star gets more centrally peaked. As a
result, the Class III TTSs rotate faster than the Class II (see Choi and Herbst 1996) and a broad
distribution of rotation periods is expected among stars of the same mass in the same molecular
cloud depending on the timing of the disk unlocking.
There is, however, a link between the age of young associations as a whole and the rotation
spread of their member stars. As an example, the spread of velocities observed in αPer (a 50 Myr
old stellar association) is 150 km s−for G-type stars (0.8–1.0 M⊙) (Prosser 1992). However no

Top, YSOs’ components; middle, only stelar illumination is switched on; bottom, full illumination,
including the jet. The density in the disk is simulated by seven nested surfaces that act as bound-
aries to volumes ﬁlled with 106 particles each, up to a grand total of 7×106 particles in the disk. The
surfaces have been selected from the ﬁnal density distribution in the gravitational collapse simu-
lations of >Fig. 6-9 (bottom panel of >Fig. 6-9a). The density levels correspond to Δ log ρ = 0.6.
The optical performance of the particles is characterized by an albedo of 57 ± 2%
spread is observed among G-type stars in the older Pleiades association (100 Myr old) while K
dwarfs still display a broad dispersion in rotation velocities (Mayor and Mermilliod 1991) that
is lost in the even older Hyades association (Stauffer et al. 1997). This indicates that once the
disk locking is lost, a Solar-like wind develops braking the stellar rotation. As the total angu-
lar momentum of the system ought to be conserved, the angular velocity of the star decreases
at a rate of roughly lA ˙Mw, where ˙Mw is the wind mass-loss rate (for the Sun currently is
∼(−) × −M⊙year−). As the lever arm (the Alfvén radius) is larger for faster rotators,
they brake more efficiently than the slower ones reaching an equilibrium configuration in some
tens of Myrs.
Stars and the accretion engine control the irradiation of the disk and its lifetime. The base of the
outflow and the reconnection at the star–disk interface is an abundant source of hard UV radi-
ation that has a profound impact into disk evolution and chemistry. The geometrical location of
the illuminating source is relevant to determine the flux that reaches the disk surface. As shown
in >Fig. 6-27, the effect of the outflow and the inflated magnetic structure on the disk irradi-
ation ought to be taken into account. High latitude illumination facilitates energy absorption
by the disk. The simulation shown in the figure is made with ray-tracing algorithms. The YSO’s
environment is simulated assuming a density law as in Yorke and Bodenheimer(1999) to model
the protostellar disk. The disk is irradiated by three sources (star, extended magnetosphere, and
jet). The luminosity of the star is assumed to be L⊙, the luminosity of the extended magneto-
sphere to be 10% of this value, and the luminosity of the jet .L⊙. The system was scaled to

ing the two lower panels where the jet contribution to the disk illumination is switched on/off.
Unfortunately, the current uncertainties on the inner structure of the engine and the properties
of the magnetosphere make this kind of studies extremely model dependent.
In the coming years, the understanding of YSOs and protostellar disks evolution will suf-
fer a major revolution due to the impact of the new facilities, now under development, for
(1) high spatial resolution (1 AU scales) mapping of the molecular emission of protostellar disks
and (2) dedicated monitorings of the YSOs high-energy output at UV wavelengths to map the
magnetospheric structure and the inner engine.
Acknowledgments
Writing this review has been a challenge given the enormous amount of information to be sum-
marized in a meaningful text. Detailed reviews on the specific topics addressed in this chapter
can be find in the Protostarsand Planetsseries. During the writing, I have enjoyed conversations
with Javier López-Santiago, Ralph Pudritz, José Cernicharo, and Rafael Bachiller that I wish to
acknowledge. A most rewarding experience was building the last figure in the article. The tools
developed for movie and game makers are becoming increasingly and amazingly sophisticated.
I would like to thank Victor Rodrigo for introducing me to this field. I wish also to thank Fátima
López-Martínez for her assistance with the figures.
Appendix A: The Gould’s Belt
The Gould’s Belt is the local super association of star formation and has characteristics similar
to a starburst. Molecular gas, early B to A stars, star forming regions, and young associations as
the Pleiades or the Hyades form part of the belt. The extent of the belt is about 800 pc and
the Sun is located at about 160 pc of its innermost border (see Poeppel 1997 for a review).
Around the position of the Sun, there is an inner belt of radius 140 pc where the main star form-
ing regions are located: Taurus-Aurigae, Ophiuchus, Lupus, Chamaleon, Sco-Cen, and Serpens
(see >Fig. 6-28). There are not very massive O-type stars in the belt. The origin of the Gould’s
Belt is unknown. The constituents of the belt share a common kinematics and are located in a
plane inclined with respect to the galactic plane by 16○. Three main formation scenarios have
been proposed to explain its characteristics: a supernovae explosion (Perrot and Grenier 2003),
the impact of a high velocity cloud from the halo (Comerón and Torra 1994), and the formation
of a corrugated galactic disk due to the onset of the Parker instability (Gómez de Castro and
Pudritz 1992).

Brown Dwarfs
Abstract:
Brown dwarfs are celestial objects that form in the same manner as stars, but which,
due to their low mass, fail to generate sufficient energy during the initial collapse to achieve
central temperatures that are capable of igniting hydrogen fusion. Lacking a long-lived energy
source, brown dwarfs cool and fade to extremely low-luminosities on timescales that are short
by astronomical standards. After a long drought, many examples have been discovered over the
past 15 years, both as isolated objects in the field and as companions of known nearby stars.
Most have extremely low surface temperatures, complex molecule-dominated atmospheres,
and populate the new spectral classes L and T. This chapter summarizes our current knowl-
edge of the basic characteristics of these low-mass objects and gives brief consideration to likely
developments in the near future.

Introduction
The likely existence of star-like objects with insufficient mass to trigger hydrogen fusion was first
postulated in the early 1960s (Kumar 1962). Originally tagged as “black dwarfs,” these substellar
dwarfs resisted discovery for more than a quarter of a century, and were represented by a mere
smattering of much-debated candidates until the mid-1990s. During that interim period, brown
dwarfs acquired their name (Tarter 1974), and, for a limited time, were in vogue as a potential
candidate for dark matter.
Prior to their discovery, the broad characteristics of brown dwarfs were anticipated theo-
retically, from models, and observationally, from measurements of low-mass stars. The models
(e.g., Grossman et al. 1974) predicted that the mass-limit for hydrogen burning fell at
≈0.075 M⊙, corresponding to luminosities less than 10−L⊙and temperatures below ≈2,400 K.
At those temperatures, the bulk of the radiation is emitted at infrared wavelengths, as empha-
sized by observations of the archetypical late-type dwarf, VB 10 (van Biesbroeck 1944). With a
photospheric temperature of ≈2,500 K, VB 10 has a luminosity L ∼× −L⊙, corresponding
to a bolometric magnitude of ∼13.5, or δMbol ∼magnitudes relative to the Sun. The absolute
visual magnitude is MV = ., almost a million times fainter than the Sun at those wave-
lengths, but the K-band (2.2 μm) magnitude is MK ∼, or ∼500 times fainter than the Sun.
The only wide-field surveys available in the 1970s and 1980s were based on photographic plates,
which are most sensitive at blue and optical wavelengths. Thus, searches for field brown dwarfs
were limited to sources within a few parsecs of the Sun.
Given those technical constraints, it is not surprising that the first brown dwarfs were
detected as companions to low-luminosity stars already known to lie within the Solar Neigh-
borhood, rather than in the field. The key discovery was Gl 229B (Nakajima et al. 1995), the
low-luminosity companion of an early-type M dwarf within 6 parsecs of the Sun. Prior to its
discovery, a handful of other candidates had been identified (see > Sect. 5.1) but none was

unambiguously substellar.1 In contrast, Gl 229B has a very distinctive spectral energy dis-
tribution, with strong near-infrared absorption due to methane, leading to extremely blue
near-infrared colors.2 Those features indicate a photospheric temperature close to 1,000 K,
substantially cooler than any star. Gl 229B provided unequivocal evidence of the existence of
substellar brown dwarfs.
Advances in detector technology in the 1980s and early 1990s led to the development
of large-format arrays, sensitive at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. The latter develop-
ments enabled initiation in the mid-1990s of the first deep, wide-field surveys at near-infrared
wavelengths, the southern Deep Near-Infrared Survey (DENIS; Epchtein et al. 1994) and the
2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006). At optical wavelengths, the Sloan Dig-
ital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) covered a quarter of the sky to flux levels 10 to 100 times
fainter than the photographic Palomar and UK Schmidt surveys.
Combined, data from these new sky surveys have led to an avalanche of discoveries. There
are now several thousand dwarfs known that are as cool or cooler than VB 10, including ≈1,000
dwarfs that are sufficiently cool that they required the establishment of two new spectral types,
L and T. The expression ultracool dwarfs has been coined to describe all dwarfs with spectral
types M7 or later. A quick note on terminology is in order here: All save the youngest brown
dwarfs are ultracool dwarfs, but a significant number of ultracool dwarfs, at least at spectral type
M, are very low-mass stars. From the observer’s perspective, it is often impossible to distinguish
whether a particular dwarf is above or below the hydrogen-burning limit. Thus, throughout
this chapter, the noun “dwarf” is often prefaced with the neutral adjective “ultracool,” reserving
“brown” for unambiguous situations.
This inherent ambiguity in observational properties raises an important issue with regard to
how brown dwarfs fit within the broader astrophysical context of stars and extrasolar planets.
Brown dwarfs and stars are labeled separately based on their internal energy sources. How-
ever, the physical laws governing energy generation are entirely independentof those governing
fragmentation, collapse, and accretion within gaseous clouds. Thus, while brown dwarfs receive
particular attention in the literature, largely because of their ability to disappear, it is generally
more appropriate that they are viewed as the low-mass extreme of a continuous distribution.
On the other hand, while giant extrasolar planets are likely to have apparent characteristics that
resemble cool brown dwarfs, planets form within a distinct environment, circumstellar disks.
To borrow from life science, giant planets and brown dwarfs are more appropriately viewed as
separate species with shared characteristics.
The overwhelming majority of ultracool dwarfs are isolated objects in the general field,
with minorities drawn from clusters and as companions to main-sequence or evolved stars.
The brightest ultracool dwarfs have been scrutinized through spectrophotometry, mapping the
spectral energy distributions; high angular resolution imaging, to search for resolved lumi-
nous companions; and detailed spectroscopy at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, probing
chemical compositions, chromospheric activity, and searching for velocity variations charac-
teristic of close companions. Theoreticians have built on those results to model atmospheric
structure, opacity sources, and dust formation and destruction. At the same time, deep imag-
ing of young clusters and associations at far-red and near-infrared wavelengths has illuminated
1For a more extensive historical discussion of brown dwarf discoveries, see Reid and Hawley (2005), Chapter 6.
2It is probably fair to say that these colors came as a surprise to most observers, who were generally focused
on searching for objects that were extremely red at all wavelengths. This should not have been a surprise, since
Tsuji (1964) predicted exactly these characteristics almost three decades before the discovery of Gl 229B.

frequency of brown dwarfs relative to stars.
This chapter provides an introduction to the nature and characteristics of brown dwarfs.
At the appropriate junctures, parallels are drawn and connections made with higher-mass stars
and lower-mass planetary objects. Given the page limits, it is not possible to cover all aspects
of brown dwarf research within this single chapter. Cross-references are provided to selected
articles from the literature and, where appropriate, to other chapters in this volume. The final
section lists suggestions for further reading of review articles and textbooks.

Formation and Evolution
2.1 The Hydrogen-Burning Mass Limit
The absence of long-lived hydrogen fusion is the defining characteristic that sets brown
dwarfs apart from stars. Stars and brown dwarfs form by gaseous collapse within molecu-
lar clouds. During the collapse, potential energy is released, leading to an increase in the
core temperature, TC. At the same time, the central density, ρC, rises. If TC is driven above
Tcrit ∼× K (the exact value is pressure dependent), then hydrogen fusion is initiated, pro-
viding a long-lived energy source that establishes hydrostatic equilibrium and supports the star
against further collapse.
The energy injected into the core to raise the central temperature is a product of the total
mass and the distance collapsed. Consequently, low-mass protostars have to undergo a higher
degree of collapse than high-mass protostars. As a guide, in the perfect gas régime,
GM

∼NkT , and
M
R ∼constant , so
⟨ρ⟩∝M−
Thus, a 0.1 M⊙M dwarfs must achieve core densities that are a factor of a hundred higher than
those present within solar-type G dwarfs before hydrogen fusion can be initiated. The exis-
tence of a lower mass limit to the hydrogen-burning main sequence stems from the onset of
degeneracy in the core.
As core densities increase, particles are placed in closer proximity. Electron degeneracy
pressure is a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two fermions can-
not simultaneously occupy the same quantum state. That pressure is governed by the following
relation
Pd =
h
mem/
p
( 
π)
/
( ρ
μe
)
/
Where me and mp are the mass of the electron and proton, h is Plancks constant, ρ is the den-
sity, and μe = Ne
Np is the ratio of electron number to proton number. As ρ increases, more energy
must be devoted into overcoming this pressure rather than transformed to thermal energy
and contributed to heating the core. There are two major consequences: First, as originally
pointed out by Kumar (1963), degeneracy can prevent the central temperature rising above the

critical level for hydrogen burning in low-mass dwarfs; second, degenerate incompressibility
prevents low-mass dwarfs contracting to radii smaller that ∼.R⊙, comparable to the size of
Jupiter.
Evolution: The detailed evolution of a low-mass dwarf depends critically on its mass, M.
However, the stellar/brown dwarfdivision is shaded in gray. There are fourscenarios toconsider,
as illustrated in >Fig. 7-1, which uses theoretical models from Burrows et al. (1993). Taken in
order of decreasing mass, they are as follows:
•
The central temperature rises above the critical threshold for hydrogen fusion, TH,crit, and
the core is nondegenerate. The temperature remains above the threshold and fusion is
maintained. The star settles onto the main sequence and evolves with a lifetime exceeding
10years.
•
The central temperature peaks above TH,crit, but core degeneracy is sufficient that TC is
reduced below that peak, although not to the extent that it falls below the TH,crit. The object
achieves a main-sequence configuration, albeit at lower luminosities than the initial values.
•
The central temperature rises above TH,crit and initiates fusion, but degeneracy within the
core is sufficient to drop TC below that value. As a result, these objects achieve stellar status
for a limited time and eventually cool into oblivion as brown dwarfs.
•
The central temperature never rises above TH,crit; hydrogen fusion is never established, and
the object “cools like a rock” (Burrows and Liebert 1993).
Scenarios 1 and 2 produce stable hydrogen-burning stars; the fourth scenario leads to a
brown dwarf; and the third scenario corresponds to a transition object, with a mass balanced

on the threshold of the hydrogen-burning limit. Kumar originally placed that limit as MBDcrit
∼.M⊙(or ∼MJup). More recent models, such as those illustrated in >Fig. 7-1, predict
that a solar-metallicity object with a mass of ∼0.078 M⊙will meet scenario 2 and eventually
settle onto the main sequence as a low-luminosity, but long-lived, late-type star; a ∼0.075 M⊙
dwarf will become a transition object; and the brown dwarf limit is MBDcrit ∼.M⊙.
Chemical abundance plays a secondary role in defining the mass threshold that separates
brown dwarfs and stars. Higher helium abundance, Y, leads to higher mean molecular weight,
smaller radii, and higher TC and ρC for the same mass; consequently, the critical mass for
H-burning decreases as Y increases. Lower metallicity dwarfs have lower atmospheric opacities,
which produce shallower temperature gradients and higher luminosities (less efficient energy
retention) and correspondingly lower TC. As a result, decreasing [M/H] leads to higher brown
dwarf mass limits, and higher luminosities and temperatures at the H-burning limit. As an
example, at zero metallicity, MBDcrit ∼.M⊙, and the H-burning limit lies at Teff ∼, K.
In comparison, the same models predict effective temperatures of ∼, K for solar abundance
brown dwarfs at the H-burning limit (Burrows et al. 2001).
Other fusion sources: Hydrogen is not the only source of fusion energy in low-mass dwarfs.
Trace quantities of primordial lithium and deuterium can add to the energy budget if the
core temperature rises sufficiently. Lithium fusion is triggered at temperatures above TLi,crit ∼
.×K, with the element burning to form helium (one of the later steps in the extended P–P
chain, see >Chap. 6). This temperature is achieved in the cores of solar-metallicity dwarfs with
masses exceeding ∼0.06M⊙. Late-type dwarfs are fully convective, so all material is exposed to
those temperatures. Primordial lithium has a low abundance, [Li]=3.3 on a logarithmic scale
where [H]=12.0, and the available fuel is quickly consumed: An .M⊙dwarf is expected
to deplete lithium fully in ∼10years, by which time it has cooled to photospheric tempera-
ture of ∼2,800 K, corresponding to spectral type M5. This behavior permits the lithium test
(Rebolo et al. 1992; >Sect. 3.4), one of the few observational methods of unambiguously iden-
tifying (low mass)brown dwarfs. Ultracool dwarfs that exhibit Li I absorption at 6,708 Å have at
most partially depleted the primordial lithium. Therefore, they have achievedcore temperatures
exceeding TLi,crit for a limited period of time, at most, and must have masses below ∼0.06M⊙.
Deuterium fusion is triggered at temperatures as low as ∼4×K, and consequently occurs
in lithium-rich brown dwarfs. Indeed, the mass threshold for deuterium burning, ∼0.012 M⊙
(at solar metallicities), has been proposed as the lower boundary of the brown dwarf régime.
In principle, one might envisage an observational test comparable to the lithium test that could
distinguish these very low-mass dwarfs, but deuterium has only a few weak spectroscopic signa-
tures at mid-infrared wavelengths, making any observations exceedingly challenging (Chabrier
et al. 2000). The primordial deuterium abundance is [D]∼−4.7, or 17 orders of magnitude
lower than hydrogen. Thus, as >Fig. 7-2 shows, deuterium provides only a brief spike in energy
production during the earliest stages of brown dwarf formation.
2.2 Formation Mechanisms
Star formation is a complex process (see
>Chap. 6 of this volume). This section focuses on
brown dwarf formation which, in conventional theories, is characterized as the low-mass tail
of a process of collapse and fragmentation that spans at least four orders of magnitude in mass.

The fractional luminosity contributed by nuclear fusion reactions in low-mass dwarfs. As
in >Fig. 7-1, the models are from Burrows et al. (1993). The initial energy burst is contributed by
deuterium and lithium fusion, persisting longest in the lowest-mass model
The Jeans mass is a key parameter in many of those theories, representing the mass where grav-
itational forces in a cloud core just overcome the internal pressure, precipitating collapse. The
Jeans mass is given by
MJeans = ( kT

where T and ρ are the average temperature and density of the gas cloud, mH is the mass of the

/

where n is the number density in molecules cm−, P is the core pressure, and k the Boltzmann

The Jeans mass sets the lowest-mass star-like object that can form in an ideal gas cloud.
Typical temperatures for giant molecular clouds are close to 10 K, while pressures range
from ∼10k for low-density star-forming regions, such as Taurus, to ∼10k for the cores
of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). These values correspond to Jeans masses from ∼1.1 to
∼.M⊙. In contrast, brown dwarfs with masses as low as ∼0.005 M⊙(∼MJup) are known
to exist ( > Sects. 3.3 and >5.2). Only a fraction, perhaps as little as 10%, of the material in
the cloud core contributes to the star or brown dwarf that is the final product of the forma-
tion process. Even so, this suggests that low-mass brown dwarfs require cold, very high density
environments that are rarely observed in GMCs.

344 7
Brown Dwarfs
The Jeans mass is an idealized concept, and real GMCs are subject to shocks, magnetic fields,
turbulence, and ordered motions due to stellar winds and cloud–cloud collisions that can lead to
significant density inhomogeneities. However, the large numbers of brown dwarfs discovered in
the field have led some to explore alternative formation scenarios. In particular, brown dwarfs
(and, by extension) low-mass stars have been identified as interrupted stars, embryos ejected
part way through the formation process.
The ejection hypothesis is founded on theories of star formation through competitive accre-
tion (Bonnell et al. 1997). Those theories envisage stars forming in small groups, with two to
four stars per cloud core. Each star within that group is competing for material from the same
reservoir, but they are not competing on an equal footing (see >Sect. 5.1). Gravity follows the
principle that to those that have, more shall be given, and, as a consequence, the most mas-
sive object quickly grows to dominate the group, to the extent it may acquire a circumstellar
disk of sufficient mass that they can support formation of brown dwarf mass objects. Dynami-
cal interactions within the group can lead to rapid ejection of the lowest-mass object, which is
therefore no longer able to accrete significant mass. If those ejected objects have masses below
the hydrogen-burning limit, then they will evolve to form brown dwarfs (Bate et al. 2002).
This model makes several predictions: First, the velocity dispersion of brown dwarfs should
be higher than stars within the cluster; second, the brown dwarf binary fraction should be
extremely low (<5%), since wider binaries are expected to be disrupted dynamically; and, third,
brown dwarfs are expected to possess highly truncated circumstellar disks. None of these pre-
dictions are supported by observations: Brown dwarfs continue to reside within clusters, so any
dynamical accelerations must be limited to less than 1–2 km s−; the brown dwarf binary frac-
tion is closer to 20% ( >Sect. 5.2); and observations of brown dwarfs in young clusters reveal
infrared excess radiation, suggestive of the presence of cool material in a surrounding disk, and
Hα emission, indicating ongoing gas accretion. Thus, while the embryo ejection model is attrac-
tive in that it avoids the Jeans mass problem for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, it has little
direct observational support.
2.3 Brown Dwarf Evolution
The fundamental parameter governing brown dwarf evolution is mass. Mass determines the
energy generated in the initial collapse, sets the maximum possible central temperature, and
hence defines whether any nuclear fusion occurs. Brown dwarf radii are set primarily by degen-
eracy ( > Sect. 2.1); consequently, all brown dwarfs, regardless of mass, have similar radii,
and similar surface area. This has two consequences: First, irrespective of mass, all brown
dwarfs follow similar evolutionary tracks in the (L, Teff) HR diagram; second, since the rate
of energy depletion is essentially independent of mass, higher-mass brown dwarfs, with a
larger store of energy, evolve and cool at a slower rate that lower-mass brown dwarfs. These
broad characteristics have been codified by Burrows et al. (2001) in the following approximate
relations:
L ∝τ−.M.
Teff ∝τ−.M.
R ∝g−.T.
eff ≈RJup
where τ is age in Gyrs, and g is the surface gravity.

models span a range of masses, from 0.15 M⊙low-mass stars through the brown dwarf
re´gime to 0.009 M⊙(∼MJup) planetary-mass objects, and show the rapid convergence in
radius. The initial radii, at τ ∼, years, range from 0.3 to 2.4 R⊙, but within ten mil-
lion years all dwarfs have radii between 0.15 and 0.3 R⊙, and the dispersion is less than 25%
at τ = Gyr.
>Figure 7-3 shows that contraction pauses at ages of a few million years for masses exceed-
ing 0.012 M⊙. This stems from additional energy provided by fusion of lithium and deuterium
(see >Fig. 7-2). There is a corresponding standstill in luminosity and temperature (> Figs. 7-4
and > 7-5). Indeed, > Fig. 7-5 shows that the surface temperature for higher-mass dwarfs
(M > .M⊙) is actually rising at ages between 1 and ∼10 million years. Thus, the significant
decline in luminosity at those ages is driven by contraction and decrease in surface area. As
dwarfs age beyond 1 Gyr, the bifurcation between hydrogen fusion-supported stars and brown
dwarfs becomes apparent. Stars settle onto the main-sequence at constant temperature and
luminosity; transition objects, with masses in the range .<
M
M⊙< ., achieve tem-
porary core fusion that slows the descent before degeneracy drops the core temperature below
TH,crit; and brown dwarfs fade and cool monotonically.
As the surface temperature changes, the chemical species present in the atmosphere also
change, leading to evolution of the electromagnetic energy distribution, the photospheric spec-
trum, and spectral type. In the last context, the approximate temperature boundaries between
spectral classes are marked on >Fig. 7-5. Clearly, all brown dwarfs are classed initially as mid-
type M dwarfs, but as they age and cool they evolve through late-M and L to T. >Figure 7-6
reinforces this conclusion, demonstrating how the evolutionary tracks for different masses run

brown dwarfs: There is no simple mass-luminosity (or mass-temperature) relation. In main
sequence stars, the energy generated is dependent directly on the total mass, with L ∝M.for
M > M⊙and L ∝M.at lower masses (Smith 1983). As a consequence, the mass of an indi-
vidual star can be inferred if there are measurements of its apparent magnitude and distance,
and hence its luminosity. In contrast, an age measurement is essential to break the inherent
degeneracy in the brown dwarf tracks plotted in >Fig. 7-6, and derive a mass estimate for an
individual object.
Two further broad conclusions can be drawn from >Fig. 7-5 that inform any analysis of
brown dwarf demographics. First, regardless of mass, the rate of evolution scales with the tem-
perature; as a result, brown dwarfs spend least time as M dwarfs, a relatively short period as
an L dwarf, and the bulk of their visible lifetime as T (and then Y) dwarfs. Second, higher-
mass objects evolve more slowly, so they have longer residence times within each spectral type,
and they therefore dominate in any sample drawn from the field. Thus, a volume-limited sam-
ple of late-type M dwarfs is comprised predominantly of low-mass stars, while the majority of
late-type L dwarfs in the same volume are high-mass brown dwarfs, with masses in the range
0.06–0.072 M⊙. The latter prediction is confirmed by the scarcity of L dwarfs with detectable
lithium absorption.

2.4 Brown Dwarfs and the Mass Function
Individual brown dwarfs are of very low mass and each makes a correspondingly small contri-
bution to the global mass density. However, intermediate-ageand old brown dwarfs can achieve
mass-to-light ratios exceeding 10, and, collectively, have the potential to make major contribu-
tions to the mass density without producing a visible signature. As a consequence, brown dwarfs
and, to a lesser extent, low-mass stars have long been regarded as dark matter candidates. The
crucial parameter for determining their viability in this respect is the number of dwarfs as a
function of mass, the mass function.
The concept ofdark matterfirst appeared in the astronomical literature (albeit, largelyunno-
ticed) in the 1930s with Fritz Zwicky’s observations of velocity dispersions and luminosities of
galaxy clusters. The first widespread recognition of the potential presence of substantial quanti-
ties of nonluminous material came with Oort’s (1932) identification of “missing mass” (actually,
missing light) in the local Galactic disk. A comparison between estimatesof the local mass den-
sity derived from a census of local constituents (gas, dust, and stars), and from the gravitational
field inferred from the vertical motions of disk stars at moderate heights above the Plane implied
that visible matter accounted for less than half the gravitating material in Solar Neighborhood.
Recent analyses have shown that the Oort-limit missing mass stems primarily from the
complex nature of the Galactic disk, notably the dominance of thick disk stars at ∣z∣> kpc,

⊡Fig. 7-6
Evolutionary tracks for very low-mass dwarfs in the HR diagram. As in previous ﬁgures, the data are
from the Burrows et al. (1993, 1997) model calculations. As in >Figs. 7-3–7-5, the models span the
mass range 0.15 M⊙to 0.09 M⊙. Lower-mass dwarfsare more luminous at a given temperature due
to their larger radii. Solid points mark the 100-Myr isochrone and triangles the 1-Gyr isochrone
rather than dark matter in the disk (Crézé et al. 1998). Nonetheless, Oort’s conclusions perme-
ated Galactic structure investigations until at least the early 1980s and stimulated considerable
interest in determining the local number density of red dwarf stars. The apparent deficit led to
numerous investigations of the stellar mass function at low masses that continued through the
1980s and 1990s (see Reid and Hawley 2005, Chapter 8). Observations focused on two tactical
approaches: A complete census of the stellar constituents in the immediate Solar Neighbor-
hood, within 8–10 parsecs of the Sun (e.g., Reid and Gizis 1997; Reid et al. 2008b); or exhaustive
surveys for low-mass members of nearby open star clusters, such as the Hyades and Pleiades
(e.g., Bouvier et al. 2008; Stauffer et al. 2007).
The results from these investigations have converged to give a consistent picture of the initial
mass function (IMF). Introduced by Salpeter (1953), the IMF describes how gas redistributes
itself as stars and brown dwarfs within a star, forming region. This fundamental parameter has
received considerable observational and theoretical attention in the succeeding half century.

Brown Dwarfs 7
349
The IMF is often characterized as a power-law,
Ψ(M) = dN
dM ∝M−α
and can also be cast in logarithmic units
ξ(M) =
dN
dlog M ∝M−α+
It is important to be clear on which formalism is adopted in a given analysis. The power-law is
described as “steep” forlarge values of α (i.e., rapidlydecreasing numbers ofstars with increasing
mass) and “flat” for α = . An α = IMF has the interesting characteristic that each decade of
mass (0.01–0.1 M⊙, 0.1–1 M⊙, etc.) contributes the same total mass to the local mass density.
Observations show that the IMF increases steeply with decreasing mass for high-mass stars
with a power-law slope close to Salpeters original index, α = ., at masses M > M⊙. The IMF
flattens at masses below ∼M⊙, and can be matched as a power-law with α ∼(Kroupa 2002).
These results demonstrate that low-mass stars are not present in sufficient numbers to make a
significant contribution to dark matter (Reid and Gizis 1997).
As an alternative to a power-law, the stellar IMF can be represented in the log-normal form
originally proposed by Miller and Scalo (1979),
ξ(M) = const. exp−log M −log MC
σ 
where Mc is the characteristic mass and σ in the variance in log M. These values define the peak
and the width of the mass distribution. The log-normal distribution is often grafted onto a
Salpeter-slope power-law at high masses. Chabrier (2003) favors Mc ∼.M⊙and σ = ..
It is important to emphasize that both the power-law and the log-normal distributions are fit-
ting functions, and, as yet, neither is tied to a physical model for the star formation process.
Nonetheless, these two mathematical representations have different implications with regard to
the expected number-mass distribution when extrapolated below the hydrogen-burning limit
into the brown dwarf domain.
Main-sequence stars follow (metallicity-dependent) mass-luminosity relations, allowing
masses to be estimated on a star-by-star basis. The same situation does not hold for brown
dwarfs, as outlined in >Sect. 2.3. Strategies for estimating the parent mass function need to
adapt accordingly. In the case of analyses of star clusters and young associations, the observed
parameters (magnitudes, colors) are matched against theoretical models for the appropriate age
and metallicity. Ideally, one would like to concentrate on the youngest systems, with ages less
than 10–20 Myrs, since brown dwarfs are more luminous at young ages, and observations can
therefore reach lower masses. The complications, however, are that ages for those clusters have
uncertainties of at least 20%, models are less reliable at very young ages, and individual objects
can still be surrounded by detritus from the star-forming region and cocooned in circumstel-
lar disks that can influence the measured parameters (see >Sect. 3.3). Moreover, the nearest
substantial star-forming regions lie at distances of ∼150 parsecs, complicating the detection of
low-luminosity members and, particularly, binary companion at even modest separations.
Theoretical models are more reliable for intermediate-age systems such as the Pleiades
(∼120 Myrs) and the Hyades (∼600 Myrs), but dynamical relaxation and energy equipartition
within the cluster lead to significant mass segregation, distributing lower-mass stars and brown
dwarfs toward the cluster outskirts where they are more vulnerable to stripping. As a result, the

350 7

present-day mass functions of those clusters can be significantly depleted at low masses relative
to the initial mass function. These issues are discussed in more detail by Bastian et al. (2010),
who provide an extensive review of analyses of the IMF in a wide range of environments.
Brown dwarfs and stars in the Solar Neighborhood have ages that span the full lifetime of
the Galactic disk, and many have migrated to this locale from widely different initial Galactic
radii (Reid et al. 2002). As a result, the local population can be taken as characteristic of much
broader swathe of the disk. >Figure 7-7 shows the luminosity function of nearby red dwarfs,
plotting numbers as a function of spectral type. The parent sample is complete statistically for
spectral types K through M to mid-type L dwarfs, but likely underestimates numbers at later
types. The latest L-type dwarfs and early-T dwarfs have colors that overlap with those of main-
sequence stars (> Figs. 7-15 and >7-17), while the low intrinsic luminosities of late-type T

dwarfs render them detectable within a very limited volume. Nonetheless, the overall form of
the luminosity function is clear, with the densities peaking at mid-type M dwarfs (M3, M4),
dropping sharply to a minimum at late-L and rising through T0 to beyond T5.
The morphology of the luminosity function reflects how spectral types map onto the under-
lying mass distribution. Qualitatively, the distribution can be understood in the following
terms:
•
Spectral types M3 to M8 are dominated by stars. The mass-luminosity relation steep-
ens beyond ∼M4, leading to later spectral types sampling a smaller mass range and a
corresponding decline in numbers.
•
Early-type L dwarfs are a mix of long-lived, very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The
latter spend a relatively short time (< f ew × yrs) in this temperature range (>Fig. 7-5).
•
Late-type L dwarfs and early-type T dwarfs are exclusively brown dwarfs (> Fig. 7-7).
The relative numbers therefore drop further, since the residence times at the appropriate
temperatures are significantly less than 1 Gyr for even the most massive brown dwarfs.
•
Number densities increase through mid-type and late-type T dwarfs since the rate of
evolution slows, and brown dwarfs of all masses start to pile up at those temperatures
(>Fig. 7-5).
Brown dwarfs in the field lack individual age estimates; consequently, statistical analysis
must be applied to derive constraints on the mass function from data such as those plotted
in > Fig. 7-7. Coupling an assumed star formation history with evolutionary models allows
one to define probability distributions for mass and age in the temperature range that cor-
respond to different spectral types. > Figure 7-8 shows predictions for models that assume a
constant star formation history in the disk over the last 10 Gyrs. This model predicts relatively
narrow mass distributions within each range of spectral types, and the resultant age distribu-
tions depend on the lifetimes of dwarfs of those masses. Thus, in this model, M dwarfs are
dominated by stellar masses,and therefore have a flat age distribution that matchesthe assumed
star formation history. Brown dwarfs make an increasing contribution at later types, although
longer-lived transition objects still make the largest contribution even in later-type L dwarfs.
Turning this analysis around, one can use these mass and age distributions to predict the
expected luminosity function as a function of the mass distribution, and match those predic-
tions against the observations. Initial analyses focused on the dark matter issue, and whether
there evidence for steepening mass function at brown dwarf masses. The conclusion was that the
observational data could be matched by a power-law mass function with < α < ., consistent
with extrapolating the stellar mass function below the hydrogen-burning limit, but eliminating
brown dwarfs as likely dark matter (Reid et al. 1999). Subsequent investigations, based on more
extensive samples, suggest that the mass function is significantly flatter. >Figure 7-9 matches
model predictions against the Solar Neighborhood luminosity function, plotted against J-band
(1.2 μm) absolute magnitudes; adopting a power-law representation, the data suggest α < .
in the substellar régime. Similarly, analysis of T dwarf statistics from SDSS results in an inferred
local number density of .± .pc−(Metchev et al. 2008). That sample is likely to be
incomplete to some degree, so this represents a lower limit. Nonetheless, the derived value is
consistent with a power-law index of α ∼, again suggesting that the mass function flattens at
very low masses.
Observations of star clusters lead to similar conclusions. >Figure 7-10 shows a compilation
of results for systems including the IC 348 and the Orion Nebula clusters (both τ ∼1–2 Myrs),
the much sparser λ Orionis association (τ ∼Myrs) and the more mature Pleiades cluster

The expected age and mass distribution of ultracool dwarfs in the general Galactic ﬁeld as a func-
tion of spectral type. The predictions assume a constant birthrate, a ﬂat mass function (α = 1) and
an age of 10 Gyrs for the Galactic disk, and use the Burrows et al. (1993, 1997) models to predict
the temperature/spectral-type distribution (From Allen et al. 2005)
(τ ∼120 Myrs). Despite the range in ages and environmental properties, these clusters have
mass functions with broadlysimilarcharacteristics, including a significant downturn in number
densities below 0.1–0.15 M⊙. The data are well matched by either a broken power-law with
α ∼.for M < .M⊙, or by a log-normal distribution (e.g., Chabrier 2003). By and large,
there is little evidence that these characteristics vary in a systematic way with the star-forming
environment (Bastian et al. 2010).

function (From Allen et al. 2005)
explanation for the overall morphology of the IMF has yet to emerge. Nor is there consensus
on whether there is a formal low-mass cutoff to the IMF, although observations of individual
objects, such as the wide binary 2M1207-39B (>Sect. 5.2), show that brown dwarfs can form
with masses as low as ∼0.005 M⊙. However, even if brown dwarf formation spans almost two
decades in mass, and the IMF is extrapolated to sub-Jovian mass, the net result is that brown
dwarfs are less common than stars by number, and contribute less than 10% of the mass density
due to stars with masses between 0.1 and 1.0 M⊙. Brown dwarfs have now been eliminated as
viable candidates for dark matter.

Observational Properties of Brown Dwarfs
Almost two decades have elapsed since the discovery of the first brown dwarf. Those years have
not only seen the identification of several thousand ultracool dwarfs, many likely of substellar
mass, but also compilations of the first local census and extensive observations over a wide range
of wavelengths of the brightest representatives. This section summarizes the key observational
characteristics of those dwarfs.

It is important to recognize that, while brown dwarfs are defined as a class by their mass,
their appearance depends primarily on their effective temperature. Thus, a 75 Jupiter-mass
brown dwarf with a photospheric temperature of 3,000 K is observationally remarkably sim-
ilar to a ∼0.2 M⊙M5 star, and a 1,600 K brown dwarf will be characterized as spectral type
L4 regardless of whether the mass is MJup or MJup, although there are subtle spectral
differences in both cases.
3.1 Spectroscopic Properties
Spectral types provide astronomers with a shorthand method of describing the overall char-
acteristics of a particular star in a manner that is immediately understandable by other

Brown Dwarfs 7
355
astronomers. The MKK spectral sequence, OBAFGKM, runs from high to low temperature.
Within that sequence, spectral types are defined in a qualitative, rather than quantitative, man-
ner, assigned by comparison with standard stars. In the case of classes K and M, classifications
are based on the appearance in the far-red of the optical spectrum, at wavelengths from 6,000
to 10,000 Å. For more than 50 years, M dwarfs represented the lowest extreme of the hydrogen-
burning main sequence, but the discovery of GD 165B and a few other dwarfs demonstrated
that an extension to the classical sequence was required.
Optical spectral classification: M dwarf spectra are dominated by molecular absorption,
notably TiO, although metal hydrides such as CaH, MgH, and FeH are also prominent and VO
absorption appears in the latest types. The initial optical/red spectra obtained of GD 165B, the
L dwarf archetype, show strong hydride absorption, but, confusingly, only weak TiO. As more
sources were identified and spectroscopic observations were acquired, clear patterns emerged
in the appearance and disappearance of individual features. These systematicchanges permitted
the definition of two new spectral classes, type L and T. The gross characteristics are illustrated
in >Fig. 7-11, which shows spectra at far-red optical wavelengths of representative dwarfs from
spectral type M8 to T8.
Qualitatively, the prime distinction between spectral classes M and L is the diminishing
strength of TiO absorption. VO persists among the earliest-type L dwarfs, but decreases rapidly

in strength, disappearing by type L2. Metal hydrides are the dominant molecular features,
including CaH, CrH, and FeH in the far red, and MgH shortward of 6,000 Å supplemented by
water absorption near 9,400 Å in the later L dwarfs. In addition, resonance lines due to alkaline
atoms, K I, Cs I, Rb I, and the Na I D lines, become increasingly prominent in the spectrum. The
behavior of the D lines and K I 7,665/7,699 Å doublets are particularly notable. Pressure broad-
ening within an increasingly transparent atmosphere leads to their forming features with full
width of almost 1,000 Å in the latest-type L dwarfs. These trends continue in far-red spectra of
T dwarfs, with the metal hydride and atomic absorption features weakening as HO absorption
strengthens from T0 through T5.
The spectral-type sequence can be quantified using a number of narrowband indices,
designed to measure the relative strengths of the more prominent features. A full discussion
of the definition of those indicators is given by Kirkpatrick et al. (1999) and Kirkpatrick (2005).
The physical causes for the changes in spectral appearance are discussed in >Sect. 4.
Infrared spectral classification: Spectral types for M and L dwarfs are generally derived based
on the appearance at far-red optical wavelengths. The keydiscriminatorbetween spectral classes
L and T, however, lies at near-infrared wavelengths. L dwarfs, like M dwarfs, exhibit broad
absorption bands at 1.4, 1.8, and 2.4 μm due to HO. The latter coincide with water bands in
the terrestrial atmosphere, but the higher temperaturesand pressures in the stellar atmospheres
broaden the wings, and the full line profiles can be mapped from high, dry sites, such as Mauna
Kea. Other absorption features are present, including features due to CO at 2.3 μm, and FeH and
atomic lines (Na I, K I, Fe I, Mg I) in the 1.1–1.2 μm region. The hydrides and atomic features
mirror the behavior of those species at optical wavelengths, weakening in later-type L dwarfs.
Collisionally induced Habsorption appears at 2.2 μm in the latest-type L dwarfs, flattening the
flux distribution shortward of the CO feature (>Fig. 7-12).
The most pronounced change in the near-infrared spectrum occurs with the appearance of
overtone bands of methane absorption at 1.6 and 2.2 μm. Their appearance marks the transition
from type L to T, and they rapidly grow in strength from T0 to ∼T6, where they saturate. At the
same time, the HO band at 1.1 μm strengthens. That band provides a cleaner determination
of spectral type for late T dwarfs (see Burgasser et al. 2001, for a thorough description of near-
infrared classification criteria).
Spectral features due to molecular species are also present at mid-infrared wavelengths,
a region that can be observed imperfectly through the atmosphere even from high, dry sites
such as Mauna Kea or Paranal. Nonetheless, ground-based observations through the 3 μm win-
dow demonstrated that the CH3.3 μm fundamental band first becomes apparent in mid-type
L dwarfs. IRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and ISO, the Infrared Space observatory,
opened up these wavelengths in the 1980s and 1990s, but neither satellite had sufficient sensi-
tivity to detect the relatively few ultracool dwarfs known at the time. Widespread photometric
observations of such objects became possible with the Spitzer observatory, launched in 2002,
although only the brighter L and T dwarfs proved accessible to spectroscopy.
>Figure 7-13 presents low-resolution 5.5–14.5 μm spectra of L and T dwarfs obtained with
the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on Spitzer. This wavelength range includes absorption features
due to HO, the νfundamental band at 6.27 μm and the ν−νband at 6.42 μm, which com-
bine to give an absorption feature at ∼6.5 μ; the νCHband at 7.65 μm, which first becomes
evident in mid-type L dwarfs; and the νfundamental band of NH, which strengthens in late-
type T dwarfs. All these features are characteristic of temperatures significantly cooler than the
formal photospheric temperatures for the target ultracool dwarfs, and therefore provide insight
into the properties of the atmosphere at higher levels. Spitzer spectra of mid- and late-type L

in >Fig. 7-11, the most prominent spectral features are labeled. Note, in particular, the onset of
methane absorption bands that deﬁne spectral type T
dwarfs also show evidence for broad absorption at 10 μm that might be attributed to silicates
and dust formation in those cool atmospheres. These observations give pointers to the likely
appearance of dwarfs cooler than type T, the Y dwarfs discussed in >Sect. 4.3.
3.2 Photometric Properties
Spectral types provide one means of characterizing brown dwarfs; broadband photometry pro-
vides another. >Figure 7-14 shows how the standard photometricpassbands sample the spectral
energy distribution of late-type dwarfs. The spectral energy distribution peaks strongly near
1.2 μm, demonstrating why near-infrared surveys were crucial in searching for cool dwarfs.
Integrating the flux distribution, less than 0.5% of the total energy emitted by an M8 dwarf
emerges shortward of 7,000Å and that fraction decreases sharply at later spectral types. The
near-infrared photometric passbands are chosen to avoid HO absorption bands in the terres-
trial atmosphere, but intersect with the broader steam bands in M and L dwarf spectral energy
distributions.

Low-resolution mid-infrared spectra of L and T dwarfs obtained with the Spitzer Infrared Spectro-
graph; the most prominent spectral features are identiﬁed (From Cushing et al. 2006)
The evolution in broadband colors of ultracool dwarfs is driven primarily by the changing
temperature and corresponding spectral evolution. >Figure 7-15 presents representative far-
red optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams for M, L, and T dwarfs with trigono-
metric parallax measurements. Optical/far-red colors generally become monotonically redder
with later spectral type for M dwarfs, reflecting the overall steepening of the spectral energy
distribution at those wavelengths. There is a noticeable steepening in optical color-magnitude
relations at M7. Similar behavior is seen in colors that span far-red to near-infrared wave-
lengths (e.g., (I–J)), and there is significantly higher dispersion in the T dwarf colour-magnitude
distribution.
The near-infrared (J–K) colors show the most dramatic variations. In M0-M7 dwarfs, the
J and K passbands both lie longward of the peak spectral energy distribution and are relatively

unaffected by absorption features, with the result that those dwarfs all have (J–K) ∼0.8 magni-
tudes. As the energy peak moves through the J band, an increased proportion of the total flux
shifts to the K band, and (J–K) becomes redder with later spectral type, albeit with increas-
ing dispersion for mid- and late-type L dwarfs. That trend reverses near the L/T transition as
methane absorption eats into the flux emitted within the H and K bands. Consequently, early-
type T dwarfs have near-infrared colors that are comparable with main-sequence FGK stars in
the JHK plane, rendering their detection extremely difficult without optical/far-red data to sup-
plement near-infrared colors. As the (I–J) color-magnitude relation shows, the latter data need
to have high sensitivity if surveys are to be extended beyond a few parsecs from the Sun. This
is the key factor that has enabled the identification of so many T dwarfs from SDSS data.
The first generation of surveys for ultracool dwarfs focused primarily on selecting objects
with extreme colors. Any surveythat uses color selection as a criterion runs the risk of introduc-
ing bias in the color distribution of the final sample; indeed, this is inevitable, unless the targets
have colors that are distinct from any contaminant. Such is not the case for ultracool dwarfs.
Fortunately, SDSS included both photometric and spectroscopic surveys, and the spectroscopic
data provide a means oftesting forbiases in the photometricselection. Schmidt et al. (2010)have

Representative color-magnitude diagrams for late-type stars and ultracool dwarfs. In each ﬁgure,
M dwarfs are plotted as crosses, L dwarfs as solid points, and T dwarfs as 5-point stars. Optical
photometry of T dwarfs is scarce, even in the I passband
analyzed the izJK color distributions of ultracool dwarfs identified within the SDSS (the Sloan
z passband has an effective wavelength of ∼9,000Å), and the results are shown in >Fig. 7-16.
These data show a broader spread in color, particularly to bluer (J–K) colors for L dwarfs, than in
photometrically selected samples. However, current indications are that this selection bias has a
relatively small impact on quantitative calculations, such as the Solar Neighborhood luminosity
function plotted in >Figs. 7-7 and >7-8. Nonetheless, further investigations of the implications
of these and other potential biases clearly need to be undertaken.
Absolute luminosities can also be estimated for individual objects based on their spec-
tral types. M dwarfs span such a wide range of properties within a given spectral subtype
that this method offers a poor means of estimating absolute magnitudes and distances. How-
ever, >Fig. 7-17 shows that the near-infrared absolute magnitudes, particularly MJ, are well
correlated with spectral types, at least for L dwarfs. Indeed, the color distributions plotted in
> Figs. 7-16 demonstrate that, unless one has I-band (or i-band) photometry, spectral types
offer the most effective means of estimating absolute magnitudes for L and T dwarfs. However,
the relations are not single-valued, with distinct flattening in both J and K near the L/T transi-
tion. The MJ-spectral-type distribution even suggests a reversal, with ∼T2 dwarfs brighter than

The absolute-magnitude/spectral-type relations at near-infrared wavelengths for M, L, and T
dwarfs (From Leggett et al. 2010); lighter points are known binary systems. All passbands show
a distinct ﬂattening through the L/T transition, with a suggestion of an upturn in MJ; that is, early-
type T dwarfs appear to be brighter than late-type L dwarfs at 1.2 μm. Unrecognized binaries
contribute to this feature, but, as discussed in the text, are unlikely to account fully for the feature
the latest-type L dwarfs. This behavior must at least partly reflect the onset of methane absorp-
tion, which reduces the luminosity at K and potentially redistributes flux from the H and K
windows to the J passband.
A secondary effect, which may contribute significantly to the apparent flattening in MK,
is unrecognized binarity. As discussed further in > Sect. 5, low-mass binaries tend to have
components with near-equal masses. Both evolutionary models and the luminosity function
(> Fig. 7-7) indicate that there is rapid evolution through the L/T transition. That evolu-
tion is accompanied by radical changes in the spectral energy distribution at near-infrared
wavelengths. Brown dwarf binaries are therefore likely to go through a phase where the two
components have similar J-band luminosities, but the more massive component has spec-
tral type late-L while the lower-mass component has evolved through the L/T transition. If
those components are unresolved, the composite spectrum will be approximately consistent
with an early-type T dwarf, albeit with somewhat unusual bandstrengths, but the measured
near-infrared absolute fluxes are enhanced compared with a single dwarf. Consequently, if the
parallax is known and the combined data are plotted in the HR diagram, the system will appear
to be overluminous, particularly in MJ. Observational support for this hypothesis comes from

Brown Dwarfs 7

indications of significantly higher binary fractions at spectral types L8-T4, and binarity likely
accounts for almost all of the effect in MK (Burgasser 2007). However, photometry of resolved
binary components suggests that even removing unresolved systems leaves a residual “bump”
in the mean relation in the MJ/spectral-type plane.
Photometric data provide a reliable means of estimating bolometric luminosities and effec-
tive temperatures. In the case of ultracool dwarfs, observations are required that extend to
mid-infrared wavelengths. Ground-based observations longward of 3 μm are possible for only
the brightest ultracool dwarfs. In general, (K–L) colors ([2.5–3.8] μm) increase almost linearly
with spectral type from ∼0 at M0 to ∼2.0 magnitudes at T5; (L–M) colors ([3.8–4.75] μm)
trend blueward from ∼0 at M0 to ∼−0.5 mag. at L5, but reverse to reach ∼0.5 mag. for the
latest T dwarfs. Initial ground-based data have been supplemented by extensive mid-infrared
observations with Spitzer, permitting calibration of absolute magnitude/spectral-type rela-
tions at mid-infrared wavelengths. Those relations show a distinct steepening as one moves
from spectral L to T, reflecting the onset of significant absorption at mid-infrared wavelengths
(> Fig. 7-18). Combined, the near- and mid-infrared data allow bolometric corrections to be
derived for a representative set of late-M, L, and T dwarfs (>Fig. 7-19).

where σ is Stefan’s constant. In the case of M dwarfs, radii have been measured from eclips-

derived temperatures span a range of ∼1,400 K, from ∼3,800 K M0 dwarfs to 2,300–2,400 K
ultracool M9s. Spectral types L and T extend the sequence to lower temperatures. Deriving
quantitative temperature estimate for ultracool dwarfs is simplified by the fact that they show
little variation in radius with mass range, except at very young ages (> Fig. 7-3). All dwarfs
plotted in > Figs. 7-17 and >7-19 are drawn from the field, and can therefore be expected
to have ages of a few Gyrs (> Fig. 7-8). Theoretical models can be used to provide estimates
of their radii. > Figure 7-19 shows the resulting effective temperature/spectral-type relation.

Brown Dwarfs 7
365
The inferred temperatures range from ∼2,200 K at L0 to ∼1,400 K at the L/T transition, with the
latest-type T dwarfs assigned temperatures below 700 K. The physical causes for the changes in
spectral appearance over this temperature range are discussed in >Sect. 4.
As in the MJ/spectral-type plane, the temperature/spectral-type distribution exhibits a
pronounced flattening from ∼L5 to ∼T4. This is not coincidental: The inferred temperatures
scale with the bolometric luminosity, and the near-infrared is the dominant contributor to the
total flux (> Fig. 7-14; thus, similar near-infrared absolute magnitudes (> Fig. 7-17) lead to
similar temperature estimates. The observations suggest that L5 to T4 dwarfs have tempera-
tures in the range 1,250–1,500 K. Theoretical models predict monotonic temperature evolution
through this temperature range (>Fig. 7-5). Thus, these results strongly suggest that the onset
of methane absorption, and evolution through the L/T transition, is a relatively rapid process.
There is an important caveat tobearin mind in interpreting >Fig. 7-19. In deriving the effec-
tive temperature, one is making the implicit assumption that the spectral energy distribution,
and hence the measured luminosity, is generated at an approximately uniform depth within
the atmosphere. This is unlikely to be the case for at least T and Y dwarfs, as discussed further
in >Sect. 4.1. Consequently, the effective temperature scale is likely to be more figurative than
literal for the coolest dwarfs.
To date, surveys for ultracool dwarfs have relied on ground-based technology, progressing
from red-sensitive photographic plates to search for late-type M dwarfs, through near-infrared
sky surveys to search for L dwarfs, to combinations of deep, far-red CCD data and near-infrared
surveys to search for T dwarfs. Each step required increased sensitivity to probe sources of
fainter intrinsic luminosity. Deep near-infrared ground-based surveys, such as the UKIRT
Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS; Lawrence et al. 2007), are currently underway to find
even cooler dwarfs, sub-500K “Y dwarfs,” which are expected to be characterized by ammonia
absorption (see >Sect. 4.3). Those surveys are just starting to reveal interesting sources, with
close to a dozen dwarfs classified as T8 or T9. Most recently, UKIDSS has resulted in the iden-
tification of several dwarfs with spectral types later than T7. Those include the nearest brown
dwarf to the Sun, with a preliminary spectral type estimated as T10, a temperature close to 500K
and a distance of ∼2.9 parsecs (Lucas et al. 2010).
The future, however, maywell lie with space-based mid-infrared surveys. Analyses ofSpitzer
data (Leggett et al. 2010) and predictions based on theoretical models (Saumon and Marley
2008) suggest a number of color combinations that might prove effective in finding very cool
dwarfs. In particular, the ([3.6–4.5] μm)/([4.5–5.8] μm) two-color plane may act as an effective
means of segregating extremely cool dwarfs from other sources. Observations show that late-
type T dwarfs, which are extremely red in the former color, but blue in the latter. The Wide-
field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), launched in December 2009, was designed to survey
the whole sky at those wavelengths, and may prove responsible for the first identification of a
room-temperature (300 K) brown dwarf.
3.3 Observations of Young Brown Dwarfs
Youthful brown dwarfs are scarce in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, as might be inferred
from >Fig. 7-8. However, within the last decade it has become apparent that a number of rela-
tivelysparse groups and associations ofyoung stars lie within 50 to100 parsecs ofthe Sun (Zuck-
erman and Song 2004). Those include the TW Hydrae Association (d ∼–100 parsecs, τ ∼
Myrs), β Pictoris moving group (∼20–40 parsecs, ∼12 Myr), Tucana/Horologium Association

366 7
Brown Dwarfs
(∼40–60 parsecs, ∼30 Myr), and AB Doradus moving group (∼20–50 parsecs, ∼50 Myr). Several
nearby late-M and L dwarfs have been identified as likely members of these groups (Kirkpatrick
et al. 2008), and provide crucial insight into the properties of such systems. In particular, these
dwarfs serve as templates for the gravity-dependent features described in the following section.
At larger distances lie younger, active star-forming regions, such as Chamaeleon (d ∼
parsecs, τ ∼Myrs), the Scorpius-Centaurus Association (∼150 parsecs, ∼5–15 Myrs), ρ Ophi-
uchi (∼140 parsecs, ∼0.3 Myrs), and the low-density Taurus cloud (∼140 parsecs, ∼5 Myrs). The
Orion Nebula Cluster, at a distance of ∼400 parsecs, is the nearest dense star-forming cluster.
Those associations and clusters are all sufficiently young that the hydrogen-burning limit falls
within spectral type M; as a guide, the stellar/brown dwarf boundary is generally placed at spec-
tral type M5/M6 in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys have
identified numerous later-type dwarfs in these regions, including ultracool M dwarfs that are
brown dwarfs with inferred masses as low as 0.01M⊙the youngest regions, such as ρ Ophi-
uchi. Those substellar-mass dwarfs have broad characteristics that closely match those of older,
stellar-mass dwarfs of comparable spectral type. As an example, chromospheric and coronal
activity is prevalent among late-type M dwarfs (see >Sect. 3.7). Observations of M5–M8 brown
dwarfs in very young clusters (e.g., Orion: Preibisch and Feigelson 2005) find that they have X-
ray properties that are indistinguishable from field dwarfs of similar type. This strongly suggests
that temperature, rather than mass, is the controlling factor governing such properties.
Young brown dwarfs differ from field dwarfs in one important respect: Like higher-mass T
Tauri stars, they show clear evidence for the presence of circumstellar disks. Photometric obser-
vations reveal infrared excess radiation consistent with the presence of cool dust, and Spitzer
mid-infrared spectroscopy confirms the presence of silicates. Moreover, optical spectroscopy
reveals emission lines that are strongly suggestive of gas accretion (see Pascucci et al. 2009, for
a comparative review of stellar and brown dwarf disks). This raises the extremely interesting
possibility of planet formation around substellar-mass brown dwarfs. Clearly, the disk mass is
sufficiently low that there is little potential for forming gas giants. However, models suggest that
there should be sufficient material to form terrestrial planets (Payne and Lodato 2007). This is
clearly an extremely interesting area that is likely to receive substantial attention in the near
future.
3.4 Lithium Absorption and Other Mass-Dependent Spectroscopic
Phenomena
Brown dwarf spectral evolution is driven largely by changes in temperature.There are, however,
a few features that are sensitive to other physical parameters. The presence of lithium absorption
at 6,107 Å offers a straightforward means of segregating lower-mass brown dwarfs (with an
important caveat, outlined later in this section). As outlined in > Sect. 2.1, models indicate
that primordial lithium remains undepleted in solar-metallicity dwarfs with masses below MLi
∼.M⊙. This mass limit rises with decreasing metallicity, reaching ∼0.06 at [M/H]=−, since
metal-poor dwarfs have higher densities and therefore higher degeneracy and lower central
temperatures at a given mass.
Dwarfs with masses exceeding MLi can sustain lithium fusion, and therefore deplete lithium
at a rate that increases with increasing mass. As a guide, a ∼.M⊙star depletes ∼50%
of the primordial lithium in ∼25 Myrs, while a 0.1 M⊙star requires ∼70 Myrs, a 0.08 M⊙

Brown Dwarfs 7
367
star ∼130 Myrs and a .M⊙brown dwarf ∼250 Myrs. At these junctures, all of these dwarfs
have temperatures Teff > , K, corresponding to spectral types earlier than M5. Thus, a field
dwarf with spectral type later than ≈M5 and substantial lithium absorption meets the lithium
test (Rebolo et al. 1992), and can be identified as a brown dwarf with a likely mass M < .M⊙.
Similarly, this behavior can be applied to derive age estimates for relatively young star clusters
by identifying the location of the lithium depletion boundary along the main sequence: the
spectral type/absolute magnitude that marks the boundary between cluster members with and
without detectable lithium absorption (Burke et al. 2004).
Brown dwarf masses can also be constrained to some extent through measurement of sur-
face gravity. As a reference, mid-type M dwarf stars have surface gravities of log g ∼, or
g ∼g cm−s−. Electron degeneracy constrains mature brown dwarfs to have radii within
∼% of Jupiter’s radius (>Sect. 3.4); thus, low-mass brown dwarfs can have surface gravities
more than an order of magnitude lower than transition objects at the same temperatures. More-
over, young brown dwarfs with ages less than ∼100 Myrs are still in the process of contraction,
and have radii of 3–5 RJup (see >Fig. 7-3). Thus, while a mature .M⊙dwarf has a surface
gravity log g > ., young .M⊙(∼MJup) brown dwarfs can have gravities less log g ∼..
Differences in surface gravity at this level have observational consequences. A compari-
son between spectra of dwarfs and giants provides insight into the likely differences at spectral
class M. Ultracool companions of young field dwarfs and the low-mass members of nearby
young (τ < Myr) associations (>Sect. 3.3) have allowed coverage to be extended to spectral
class L. At optical wavelengths, the most significant effects are weaker absorption features due
to the alkaline metals (Na I, K I, Cs I, Rb I, Li I) and the metal hydride bands (CaH, FeH, CrH),
but stronger absorption features due to metal oxides (VO, TiO) (>Fig. 7-20). Similar effects are
present at near-infrared wavelengths, and appear to be coupled with strengthening of the water
bands in dwarfs later than ∼L2.
Metal hydrides are absent from giants because they require high pressures for their for-
mation, and the lower pressures in lower gravity atmospheres inhibit formation. Similar cir-
cumstances likely apply in low-gravity brown dwarfs. The atomic alkaline lines are heavily
pressure broadened in ultracool dwarfs, and they also become weaker at lower gravity. These
effects are likely enhanced by the presence of stronger oxide absorption, which results in higher
atmospheric opacities and effectively raises the physical level of the photosphere. Interestingly,
lithium is one of the alkaline species affected and, as a result, can be difficult to detect in brown
dwarfs younger than ∼100 Myrs (Kirkpatrick et al. 2008).
Photometric observations of moderately young M and L dwarfs show that there are also
effects in broadband colors. Low-gravity L dwarfs, for example, have redder (J–K) colors than
the average for a given spectral type. It is not yet clear whether this reflects depressed flux in the
J-band or enhanced emission at K. Note also that dust in L dwarfs can lead to redder (J–K) col-
ors. Thus, a red (J–K) color appears to be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for identifying
low-gravity field dwarfs. Low-resolution spectrophotometry also suggests a significant change
in the energy distribution in the H-band in L and T dwarfs, with the overall profile becoming
more peaked at lower gravities. Again, the origin of that effect remains unclear at present.
Efforts are currently underway to quantify these effects using an appropriate set of nar-
rowband spectral indices. As a first step, a broad classification scheme is being introduced that
will designate “normal” ultracool dwarfs as class α, moderately low-gravity dwarfs as class β,
and extremely low-gravity dwarfs as γ (Cruz et al. 2009). As yet, this proposal is still under
consideration by the broader community.

3.5 Metallicity and Ultracool Subdwarfs
The overwhelming majority of brown dwarfs identified in the immediate Solar Neighborhood
are drawn from the Galactic disk population. These dwarfs therefore have chemical composi-
tions that are within a factor of 2 of solar abundance. However, a limited number of ultracool
dwarfs have been identified that have characteristics suggestive of significantly lower metallic-
ities. Moreover, these dwarfs tend to have higher space motions relative to the Sun, as might be
expected for metal-poor members of the thick disk or Galactic halo.
The lower opacities present in metal-poor dwarfs produce higher internal pressures and
lower central temperatures at a given mass. As a result, the hydrogen-burning mass limit
increases with decreasing metallicity (see >Sect. 3.1). At the same time, the lower atmospheric
opacities lead to higher photospheric temperatures, higher luminosities, and bluer colors. Thus,
while the subdwarf sequence appears to lie below the main sequence in the HR diagram,
constant mass lines actually run up and to the left from solar abundance reference points.
Metal-poor K and M-type subdwarfs have been known for many years. The original K
subdwarf is Kapteyn’s star (Gl 191), catalogued by Jacobus Kapteyn in 1898. Their spectra
are characterized by enhanced absorption by metal hydrides (MgH, CaH, FeH) and weaker
oxide absorption (TiO, VO) at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, coupled with enhanced
absorption due to collisionally induced Hthat suppresses the flux in the H- and K-bands,

Brown Dwarfs 7
369
and correspondingly bluer near-infrared colors. These late-type subdwarfs are characterized as
either intermediate subdwarfs, identified with the prefix “sd” (e.g., sdM6) and estimatedto have
average metallicities [m/H]∼−1.3, or extreme subdwarfs, identified as esdM dwarfs and with
average metallicities closer to [m/H]∼−.
In recent years, observations have been extended to significantly cooler dwarfs, including
L-type subdwarfs. Those new discoveries were enabled by more sensitive proper motion surveys
that utilized digital scans of photographic plate material, pushing the detection limit to fainter
apparent magnitudes than was possible with hand-and-eye surveys (Lépine and Shara 2005).
Those data can be matched against 2MASS to determine the optical-infrared colors, and segre-
gate candidate subdwarfs. Similarly, cool subdwarfs can be selected using photometric criteria
that combine optical data from SDSS and near-infrared data from 2 MASS.
Spectroscopic observations of the resulting sample show that, like sdM dwarfs, sdL dwarfs
have enhanced metal hydride absorption bands at optical wavelengths, and they also possess the
broad atomic alkaline absorption features present in L dwarfs. Unlike L dwarf, however, sdLs
continue to show weak TiO absorption at λ < μm, indicating the continued presence of that
compound in gaseous form. The near-infrared spectral energy distributions are radically differ-
ent from L dwarfs with similar optical spectra (>Fig. 7-22). The spectra are almost featureless
in the H and K bands, and the overall flux levels at those wavelengths are severely depressed
due to strong collisionally induced Habsorption. There is also no evidence for any absorption
due to the CO band at 2.3 μm. Consequently, these dwarfs have photometric properties that
are qualitatively similar to T dwarfs, with steep spectra and red colors shortward of ∼1.2 μm
(T dwarfs are redder), but extremely blue near-infrared colors, (J–H) ∼(H–K) ∼0.0. Indeed,
several ultracool subdwarfs were uncovered in the course of T dwarf-focused surveys.
The spectroscopic characteristics of L-type subdwarfs are well illustrated in 2M0532+82,
the latest-type subdwarf yet discovered at type sdL7 (> Fig. 7-21, Burgasser et al. 2003). With
an estimated distance of 20 parsecs, this dwarf has a velocity of ∼320 kms−relative to the Sun
and is clearly a member of the Galactic halo. As such, it has a likely age of 11–13 Gyrs. The
temperature remains uncertain, but is probably close to 2,000 K. The mass is estimated as less
than 0.08M⊙, placing 2M0532+82 very close to the hydrogen-burning limit for metallicities of
[m/H]∼−. Thus, 2M0532+82 may well be the first known halo brown dwarf.
3.6 Brown Dwarf Kinematics and Brown Dwarf Rotation
The overwhelming majority of stars and brown dwarfs in the Galactic disk are born in dense
clusters like the Orion Nebula (Lada and Lada 2003). The internal velocity dispersion within
those clusters in extremely low (∼0.2 kms−), but, over time, clusters disperse as the individual
members acquire energy through gravitational interactions with massive objects in the Galactic
disk. The increase in peculiar velocities leads to a statistical correlation between the velocity
dispersion of a group of objects drawn from the Galactic field and the average age of that group.
The velocity distribution of field dwarfs is usually modeled as either a single Gaussian or as a
sum of Gaussians. In general terms, the overall velocity dispersion increases at τ/, where τ is
age (Wielen 1977).
Computing space motions requires measurements of proper motion, distance, and radial
velocity. In recent years, it has become possible to obtain those data for increasingly larger sam-
ples of late-M, L, and T dwarfs in the immediate Solar Neighborhood. Initial investigations
suggested that ultracool dwarfs had velocity distributions that were similar to those measured

for chromospherically active M dwarfs (dMe stars), significantly lower than the overall popu-
lation of local M dwarfs. This would imply a statistical age in the range 1 to 4 Gyrs. However,
those studies were limited to samples of less than 50 dwarfs. More recent analyses, based on
samples that are an order of magnitude larger, show that field L dwarfs have kinematics that are
indistinguishable from M dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood (Schmidt et al. 2010). This result
is consistent with the expectation that local field samples of ultracool dwarfs are dominated by
the longer-lived low-mass stars and high-mass brown dwarfs.
The high-resolution spectra used to measure radial velocities also provide information on
the rotational velocities ofultracool dwarfs. At stellarmasses, observations ofmembers ofyoung
clusters show that most stars have high initial rotation velocities (>km s−. Those velocities
decline fairly rapidly with time, as the stellar magnetic field interacts with circumstellar mate-
rial, and angular momentum drag leads to magnetic braking. Observations of nearby early- and
mid-type M dwarfs show that most have rotation velocities of a few km s−. Such is not the case
for ultracool dwarfs, where the average rotation velocity is closer to 20 km s−and can exceed
80 kms−. These observations strongly suggest a significantly longer timescale for rotational
damping, perhaps stemming for less efficient magnetic braking due to a higher degree of con-
finement of the magnetic field. This hypothesis is also relevant to observations of magnetically
driven activity, as discussed in the >Sect. 3.7.
3.7 Chromospheric and Coronal Activity in Brown Dwarfs
Magnetic fields on the surface of stars make their presence known in a variety of ways, includ-
ing chromospheric line and continuum emission at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths, radio
emission, X-ray radiation, spots, and flares. These phenomena are referred to collectively as
stellar activity, and are the subject of
>Chap. 4 in this volume. Stellar activity is driven by an
internal dynamo. In solar-type stars, the magnetic field is believed to be generated by an αΩ
shell dynamo in the boundary layer between the radiative core and the convective envelope
(Babcock 1961; Parker 1955). This mechanism persists through K and early- M-type dwarfs,
but stars become fully convective at a spectral type of ≈M3/M4, removing the physical basis for
a shell dynamo. This prompted expectations of a corresponding change in the magnetic proper-
ties at that spectral type, but no such change is observed. However, there is growing evidence for
a significant change in both the observed properties and the underlying atmospheric structure
in ultracool dwarfs with spectral types M8 and later.
Activity manifests itself in two forms in stars and brown dwarfs: At an approximately con-
stant level, generally referred to as quiescence, monitored through line emission and, to a lesser
extent, photometric variability; and in bursts of activity, known as transients or flares, marked
by strongly enhanced flux levels, particularly at high energies (blue, ultraviolet, and X-ray
wavelengths).
Quiescent activity: M dwarf atmospheres are generally believed to have overall structures
that are similar to those of solar-type stars. Observations of the Sun (see
> Chap. 6 in this
volume) show that while atmospheric density drops monotonically above the photosphere, the
temperature profile reverses ∼600 km above the visible surface, and rises sharply thereafter,
reaching 10,000 K at a height of 2,000 km and 10K at 5,000 km. The inner regions above the
reversal are the chromosphere, and the outer, verylow-density, veryhigh-temperature gas forms
the corona, with a narrow transition region lying between. The optical emission line cores in

372 7
Brown Dwarfs
alkaline elements (Cal, K, Na) and the hydrogen Balmer series are generated by the ∼10K gas
in the chromosphere.
Activity in late-type dwarfs is generally tracked using Balmer line emission, specifically Hα
emission, rather than the Ca II H and K emission employed to survey late-G and K dwarfs.
Recent years have seen extensive surveys of activity in late-type dwarfs. These surveys usually
measure equivalent widths, a parameter that depends on the contrast between the emission line
and the continuum. Since the continuum flux at 6,500 Å decreases with decreasing temperature,
lower emission fluxes are detectable in cooler stars and these raw measurementsare not suitable
for a comparison of activity across a range of spectral types. Consequently, the overall activity
level is generally quantified by measuring Fα/Fbol, the ratio between the Hα line flux and the
measured bolometric flux (Reid et al. 1995). This uses the Hα emission as a proxy to measure
the proportion of a cool dwarf’s energy budget that is devoted to chromospheric activity. This
measurement is independent of spectral type.
>Figure 7-22 shows the distribution of the Hα activity index as a function of spectral type
(Liebert et al. 2003). The mean level of activity is approximately constant at
Lα
Lbol ∼−.for
spectral types M0 to ∼M6, although the dispersion clearly increases toward the latter types.
Some of the scatter is likely due to intrinsic variability, since repeated observations indicate that
most active stars exhibit night-to-night variability by up to a factor of 2. The overall frequency
of active dMe dwarfs, defined as dwarfs with Hα emission exceeding an equivalent width of
1Å , rises from ∼% at M0 through 25–30% at M4 to over 60% at M6 and close to 100% at M8.
Interestingly, observations of M dwarfs at significant distances above the Galactic Plane reveal
lower dMe/dM ratios at these spectral types, with the active fraction peaking closer to 75% at
M8 (West et al. 2008).
Observations of late-type dwarfs in young open clusters (α Persei, IC 2391, Pleiades,
Praesepe, Hyades and M67) show that activity is correlated with age, in the sense that emis-
sion becomes apparent at earlier spectral types in younger clusters. Thus, late-type K dwarfs
in the ∼120 Myr Pleiades exhibit Hα in emission, while emission appears at ∼M2 in the 600-
Myr Hyades and closer to M4 in the ∼4 Gyr-old M67. This indicates that later-type, lower-mass
dwarfs have longer lifetimes as active stars than earlier-type, higher-mass stars, accounting for
the higher fraction of activity at later spectral types among field dwarfs. The level of activity,
however, does not show a corresponding correlation: M4 dwarfs in the Pleiades have similar
Hα equivalent widths to M4 dwarfs in the Hyades. As noted in >Sect. 3.2, this similarity in
level of activity at a given spectral type extends to very young brown dwarfs, indicating that
activity is tied to atmospheric structure (i.e., temperature) rather than mass.
The correlation between the presence of activity and age likely accounts for the decreased
proportion of active dwarfs at large distances above the Plane. Younger stars have smaller
velocity dispersions, and therefore tend to concentrate near the Plane, leading to a growing
preponderance of older, less active stars at increasing height. From the brown dwarf perspec-
tive, even the most massive substellar dwarfs have evolved to spectral types later than M5 by an
age of 200 Myrs. Consequently, all M-type brown dwarfs are expected to exhibit Hα emission.
It is clear from >Fig. 7-22 that there is a precipitous drop in activity as one moves beyond
spectral type M7 into the ultracool régime. The mean flux ratio drops by an order of magnitude
or more, and the activity fraction drops through ∼60% at M9 to less than 30% at L2. Emission
has been detected in a very limited number of later-type L and T dwarfs. There are a few very
active brown dwarfs, notable examples being the peculiar M9 dwarf, PC0025+0447, and the
T5 dwarf, 2MASS 1237+6526, both of which have maintained Hα emission at a near-constant

Activity in ultracool dwarfs, as measured by the presence of detectable Hα emission. There is
a substantial drop in the average level of activity as one moves from spectral type M7 to L0, a
characteristic that is mirrored by the behavior at X-ray wavelengths. Individual objects of partic-
ular interest are identiﬁed, including the unusual M9 dwarf PC0025+0447 and the active T dwarf
2M1237+6526 (From Liebert et al. 2003)
level for several years, but they are the exception rather than the rule. The potential physical
mechanisms driving this behavior are discussed further below.
Quiescent activity in cool dwarfs has also been detected at X-ray wavelengths; indeed, the
initial detections with the Einstein satellite triggered the realization that magnetic fields per-
sisted beyond the M3/M4 boundary, where stars become fully convective (Rosner 1980). This
high-energy radiation is generated by the extremely hot gas in the stellar coronae and gener-
ally correlates well with the mean chromospheric activity. Subsequent X-ray satellites, notably
XMM, ROSAT, and Chandra Observatory, have extended observations to later spectral types
and lower luminosity dwarfs.
As with chromospheric indicators, the activity level across different spectral types can be
compared using the flux ratio LX/Lbol. The overall behavior is similar to that seen in Hα, with
an average flux ratio

cal Hα flux), coupled with a significant decline in activity among ultracool dwarfs. As a result,

even with the Chandra Observatory. These include a number of young brown dwarfs (e.g.,
Stelzer et al. 2006), all with spectral types in the range M6 to M9; their X-ray fluxes are consistent
with stellar-mass M dwarfs, suggesting that atmospheric properties such as temperaturegovern
activity, rather than mass. A number of L dwarfs are known to flare at X-ray wavelengths, but to
date quiescent emission has been detected from only one L dwarf, the binary system Kelu 1AB
(L2/L3.5). No T dwarfs have been detected at X-ray wavelengths.
Moving to the opposite end of the electromagnetic spectrum, a number of the nearest K and
M dwarfs have been known as radio emitters for more than 30 years (Gudel and Benz 1993).
Observations are at Ghz frequencies, notably 4.88 and 8.44 GHz, and a very small fraction of
total luminosity is emitted at those wavelengths: Flux ratios of LR
LX ∼−.Hz are typical for
K and M dwarfs. Clearly, observations are limited to the immediate Solar Neighborhood, but
the Arecibo and VLA telescopes have been used recently to extend observations to a few of
the nearest ultracool dwarfs. Close to a dozen have been detected, and their luminosities are
10–10higher than those predicted by the canonical relation for mid-type M dwarfs (Berger
2006). The detections include the archetypical fast rotator BRI 0021 (M9.5), the brown dwarf LP
944-20 (M9.5), 2MASS 0523-14 (L2.5), and 2M0036+1820 (L3.5). In several cases, a significant
component of the radiation is circularly polarized. Several dwarfs exhibit systematic variations
with periodicities that are consistent with the likely rotation period (see further below).
Spots and pulsations: Sunspots form as opposite-polarity pairs where magnetic flux tubes
break through the solar photosphere, producing large active regions with reduced temperature,
and lower flux levels.Star spots are common in young, active G and K dwarfs, and can introduce
periodic photometric modulations of a few percent as they rotate in and out of the line of sight
(see
>Chap. 4 of this volume for further discussion). Young, active brown dwarfs are likely to
show similar behavior, and, consequently, one might expect significant photometric modula-
tions. Brown dwarfs have typical rotation velocities between 10 and 80 km s−. For a radius of
0.1 R⊙, this corresponds to rotation periods between ∼12 h and ∼100 min. A number of photo-
metric campaigns have been carried out with the aim of detecting variations on this timescale,
but so far they have registered limited success. Variability has been detected,but repeated obser-
vations show that observations lose phase after only a few days. This suggests that the variability
stems from relatively short-lived phenomena, and the suspicion is that the observations are
detecting changes in cloud cover (brown dwarf “weather,” akin to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot)
rather than magnetically related activity. These results are discussed further in >Sect. 4.2.
One of most interesting developments in recent years is the detection of periodic variations
in the radio emission from a small number of ultracool dwarfs. In some cases, such as the M8.5
dwarf 2M1835+32 (> Fig. 7-23), the dwarf exhibits strong, short-lived pulses of highly circu-
larly polarized radiation. Other dwarfs, such as 2M0036+1820 (L35), exhibit variations that are
broader in scale and are detected in both polarized and unpolarized light. In both cases, the
variability is on a timescale of a few hours, matching the expected rotational periods of ultra-
cool dwarfs. The behavior is generally consistent with beamed radiation, presumably associated
with the magnetic poles, sweeping across our line of sight as the ultracool dwarf rotates on its
axis. This is directly analogous to classical neutron star pulsars; indeed, these objects have been
termed “ultracool pulsars.”
Flares: Stellar flares are an extreme example of magnetic activity that occurs on a subset of
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. During a classical flare, the blue and ultraviolet flux increases
by orders of magnitude, and this variability is accompanied by substantial brightening at X-ray
and/or radio wavelengths. Individual flares evolve on extremely rapid timescales, with the dwarf
brightening by5–7 magnitudes at blue and UVwavelengths in a matterofseconds, and decaying

Periodic ﬂuctuations in the radio emission from the nearby M8.5 dwarf, 2M 1835+32. The observa-
tions reveal strong periodic pulses (P∼2.84 h) with a very strong circularly polarized component in
addition to continuous quiescent emission (From Hallinan et al. 2008). The upper plot shows the
light-curve in intensity (Stokes parameter I) and the lower plot shows the temporal variation in
circular polarization (Stokes parameter V). The magnetic ﬁeld strength is estimated as 3 KG
to its quiescent level over a matter of minutes to hours. The continuum flux is generally con-
sistent with a 9,000–10,000 K blackbody (Hawley and Fisher 1992), and is accompanied with
flaring at X-ray wavelengths. These variations are accompanied by strengthened emission line
fluxes in the Balmer lines, Ca II H and K and, in many cases, He I and He II.
Flares in M dwarfs are generally believed to originate through mechanisms that are simi-
lar to those operating on the Sun, although there are significant differences in behavior. In the
Sun, the energyis releasedthrough reconnection between magneticflux tubes, producing a cur-
rent sheet. That sheet provides a means of rapidly accelerating electrons along magnetic field
lines into the lower atmosphere where collisions with ions produce hard X-rays via nonther-
mal bremsstrahlung, enhanced activity through heating of the chromosphere, and white-light
continuum due tohydrogen recombination. Evaporated chromosphericmaterial leads tohigher

coronal densities, and direct coronal heating byelectrons, which, in turn, leads tosoft X-raypro-
duction. The corona and the chromosphere cool as the electrons dissipate, and the star returns
to its quiescent state.Flares in late-type dwarfs differ from solar flares in showing much stronger
production of white-light continuum, and evidence for other continuum processes in addition
to hydrogen recombination.
The best studied flare stars are mid-type dMe dwarfs, such as EV Lac and AD Leo (Hawley
et al. 1995); these are stars, not brown dwarfs. However, optical flares have also been observed
in a number of ultracool dwarfs, including VB 10 (M8), BRI 0021 (M9.5), 2MASS0149+2956
(M9.5), and 2MASS0144-0716 (L5). Those flares can attain extremely high luminosities, some-
times approaching the bolometric flux during quiescence (e.g., >Fig. 7-24, Liebert et al. 1999).
Flares have also been observed at X-ray and radio wavelengths on ultracool dwarfs, including
a handful of brown dwarfs (e.g., LP 944-20). As with quiescent emission, the overall character-
istics of individual objects are tied to their temperature, not the mass: An M9 dwarf does not
care whether it falls above or below the hydrogen-burning limit.
Combined, those observations are among the strongest evidence that magnetic activity
remains present in those extremely cool dwarfs, which often lack quiescent Hαemission and are
not detected at X-ray wavelengths. Repeated observations of active ultracool M dwarfs indicate
a duty cycle of ∼5%; that is, those dwarfs spend approximately 5% of the time in outburst. As
yet, there are insufficient observations of multiple flares in L or T dwarfs to provide a reasonable
estimate of the frequency of flaring, and whether that frequency varies with spectral type.
Magnetic dynamos: Thirty years ago, theoretical modelswere predicting a significant change
in magnetic activity as dwarfs made the transition to full convection at spectral types M3/M4.
That prediction was not supported by observations (Rosner 1980). It is now becoming appar-
ent from X-ray, UV, emission line, and radio data that there is a significant change in the
observational characteristics of low-mass dwarfs, but that change occurs at spectral type ≈M8.
Early-type M dwarfs, whether stellar or substellar, have the same internal structure as solar-
type stars, with a convective envelope surrounding a radiative core. An initial poloidal field is
subject to shear at the base of the convective envelope, generating a toroidal field (the Ω effect)
which is itself modified by small-scale motions (the α effect) to general new poloidal fields. This
αΩ dynamo maintains quiescent levels of activity in those stars. Both effects are a consequence
of stellar rotation, and, as a result, there is a correlation between magnetic field strength (and
the level of activity) and rotation in early-type M dwarfs. This correlation naturally leads to a
correlation between age and activity for these stars, since the rotational velocities of single stars
decreases with age as angular momentum is lost through interactions between the global mag-
netic field and circumstellar gas. Stellar rotation can be maintained against angular momentum
loss in close binary systems, where tidal locking matches the individual stellar rotation rates to
the orbital period. This can lead to enhanced magnetic activity.
The αΩ mechanism breaks down at spectral type ≈M4 when dwarfs become fully convec-
tive. The radiative core, and the convective/radiative boundary, disappear. The magnetic field
in later-type dwarfs is believed to be generated by a turbulent dynamo (Browning 2008), driven
by currents generated by shear produced from convective motions. In consequence, there is
no clear correlation between stellar rotation and the level of activity in later-type M dwarfs.
There have been suggestions that active dwarfs require a threshold rotational velocity, although
observations place that threshold at only a few kms−.
Activity and global properties: Surveys of field dMe stars show that they can exhibit sig-
nificantly different bandstrengths than inactive M dwarfs (Reid and Hawley 2005, Chapter 5).
Further evidence of global effects prompted by enhanced activity is presented by the eclipsing

top four spectra show the rapid decline in strength of the emission line ﬂuxes and the enhanced
continuum emission at shorter wavelengths; the lowest spectrum shows the star in quiescence. It
is estimated that the total luminosity increased by ∼10% at the peak of the ﬂare activity
binary, 2MASS0535-0546. This binary comprises a pair of brown dwarfs in the Orion Nebula
Cluster. The two dwarfs have dynamically measured masses of 56±4 and 36±3 MJup, spectral
types of ∼M7 and radii of 0.67±0.03 and 0.49±0.02 R⊙respectively, all consistent with member-
ship of the ∼1 Myr-old Orion Nebula Cluster. Contrary to expectations, the lower-mass dwarf
has the higher surface temperature. Detailed observations show that the higher-mass dwarf is

rapidly rotating and is significantly more active, and the current hypothesis is that strong mag-
netic fields inhibit convection on this dwarf, leading to a cooler surface temperature.The system
is too young to have achieved tidal locking, but over time one would expect a closer balance in
activity levels as the rotation rates of the two brown dwarfs converge.
Activity in ultracool dwarfs: Magnetic fields are clearly still present in the very low-mass
stars and brown dwarfs that populate the ultracool régime, even if they are manifested in a
much lower level of quiescent activity and less frequent flares. Direct estimates are available for
a few dwarfs, either through measuring Zeeman splitting of the FeH Wing-Ford bands (Reiners
and Basri 2007) or radio emission, and they indicate field strengths of a few kiloGauss. Those
values are comparable with measurementsof classical field stars such as AD leo (∼4 kG) and EV
Lac (∼3.8 kG). What, then, leads to the significant change in observational properties between
spectral types M6 and M9?
Theoretical analyses are just starting to probe this question. Initial investigations suggest
that the effect is tied to the conditions within the upper atmosphere rather than reflecting sub-
stantial changes in the interior structure. In brief, the behavior is ascribed to the increasingly
neutral state of the atmosphere. The combination of a low ionization fraction and high density
leads to strong resistivity and efficient diffusion of magnetic fields, making it difficult for the
atmosphere to sustain significant field strength at the surface (Mohanty et al. 2002).
Radio observations are further illuminating the nature of activity in these very cool dwarfs.
In mid-type M dwarfs, emission at these wavelengths is largely ascribed to gyrosynchroton radi-
ation, generated by electrons spiraling around magnetic field lines within the stellar coronae.
However, the highly directional and strongly polarized nature of the radio emission from ultra-
cool dwarfs points to generation through a more coherent process. Current analyses (Hallinan
et al. 2008) suggest that electron cyclotron maser(ECM) instability (Treumann 2006) is a strong
candidate. The process requires a population inversion in the electron distribution in a magne-
tized plasma that has high field strength and/or low electron density. Within the Solar System,
the ECM instability is known to be responsible for generating radio emission from planets with
magnetic fields, and is also responsible for the Jovian and Saturnian auroral glows.
As noted above, the periodic variations observed at radio wavelengths are explained nat-
urally if the emission is generated within a restricted region that moves in and out of the
line of sight as the ultracool dwarf rotates on its axis. The presence of strong, narrow pulses
indicates that the radiation is beamed. The magnetic poles are obvious locations for these
active regions, and there is some evidence for dipolar structure in mid-type M dwarfs. The
ECM instability produces emission that has 100% circular polarization. Polarized radiation
is detected intermittently from dMe flare stars, such as AD Leo, and the ECM instability
may make a minor contribution to radio emission from those stars, although gyrosynchroton
dominates.
Circumstances appear to be reversed in cooler dwarfs, with the ECM instability as the
dominant source. Most observations of ultracool dwarfs are consistent with partially polar-
ized radiation, but close to 100% polarized light has been observed during outburst in the M8.5
dwarf TVLM 513-46546. The unpolarized radio emission present at other times maystem either
from secondary scattering that processes the ECM radiation or from lower-level gyrosynchro-
ton coronal radiation. In either case, radio observations provide an intriguing link between
brown dwarfs and the likely characteristics of giant exoplanets. Further observations, and more
detailed modeling, are required to further elucidate how magnetic fields affect the properties of
these very low-mass objects.

Brown Dwarf Atmospheres
4.1 Atmosphere Structure
Cool dwarfs have complex atmospheres with a significant complement of molecular species.
The relative distribution of elements between various species, and their consequent spectral
prominence, depends on gas-phase chemistry and the temperatures and pressure structure of
the atmosphere. Thus, most carbon is sequestered in CO at high temperatures and low pressures,
but resides in CH(methane) at lower temperatures and higher pressures. Similarly, oxygen is
predominantly in CO at high temperatures and low pressures, but transitions to HO (steam)
at low temperatures and high pressures, while nitrogen moves from Nto NH(ammonia).
Oxygen is approximately twice as abundant as carbon, so water vapor remains an important
opacity source even when all of the atmospheric carbon is locked up in CO.
Schematic temperature/pressure profiles for a late-type M dwarf, a mid-type L dwarf and a
Gl229B-like T dwarf are shown in >Fig. 7-25. The photospheric temperatures are ∼2,500 K,
∼1,500 K, and ∼1,000 K, respectively. A representation of the Jovian atmospheric profile is

objects. This partly reflects the greater physical depth sampled within each object, but also the
greater impact of degeneracy pressure within brown dwarfs. Superimposed on this diagram
are lines that indicate the equal-abundance boundaries for CO/HO, CO/CH, and N/NHin
solar-metallicity dwarfs. Those boundaries map the physical basis for the transition from CO-
dominated to methane-dominated atmospheres that account for the observed transition from
spectral type L to T. Moreover, they illustrate the complexity within individual atmospheres. As
an example, methane is associated with T dwarfs. However, the temperature/pressure relation
for L dwarfs indicates that methane predominates in the upper atmosphere, and the 3.3 μm
CHfeature has indeed been detected in L4/L5 dwarfs.
This highlights the non-gray nature of L and, particularly, T dwarf atmospheres. In mid-
type L dwarfs at 3.3 μm, the photosphere (at optical depth τ = ) lies at a relatively shallow
physical depth within the atmosphere. In contrast, at optical wavelengths, as discussed further
in >Sect. 4.2, dust condensation has eliminated the dominant opacity sources at optical wave-
lengths, leading to high transparency, and a substantially deeper photosphere. Structure within
the atmosphere, such as banding orpatchycloud cover, mayfurthercomplicate the issue, adding
spatial variations. The net result is that atmospheric transparency is both wavelength and spa-
tially dependent, leading to substantial variation in the physical location of the photosphere
within the atmosphere; that is, the emergent spectrum samples a range of different physical
depths at different wavelengths.
The strong wavelength dependenceof photospheric depth in ultracool dwarfs warns against
simplistic interpretation of global parameters, notably effective temperature. As defined via
Stefans law, the effective temperature carries the implicit assumption that the measured lumi-
nosity originates from uniform depth in the atmosphere. Thus, while the derived value of Teff
can be taken as an approximate measurement of surface temperature for solar-type stars, this
parameter is more akin to a weighted average of atmospheric properties in T dwarfs.
4.2 Dust and Clouds in Brown Dwarf Atmospheres
Dust formation plays an important role in the spectral evolution of brown dwarfs. TiO and
VO absorption bands weaken in the latest-type M dwarfs. Tsuji originally suggested that these
spectral changes might reflect the formation ofsolid condensates (dust)within cool dwarfatmo-
spheres (Tsuji et al. 1996). > Figure 7-25 includes the approximate condensation thresholds
for several common condensates, including enstatite (MgSiO), forsterite (MgSiO), and iron
hydroxide (Fe(OH)). The formation of those condensates, together with corundum (AlO),
perovskite (CaTiO), and solid vanadium oxide, removes metallic elements from the gaseous
state and reduces the atmospheric opacity.
The detailed mechanism(s) for formation and growth of dust grains in cool dwarfs and the
resulting cloud structure are still subjects of extensive theoretical investigations. However, there
is general agreement in the overall process. Once formed, grains settle gravitationally to lower
layers within the atmosphere and form cloud-like structures. The lower boundary to the cloud
layer is set by the point within in the atmosphere where the partial pressure of the condensates
exceeds their saturation vapor pressure. Condensates that sink below this level reach higher
temperatures,and evaporate,but are replaced by material borne upward on convective updrafts.
As the temperature decreases through late-type M dwarfs, dust formation becomes more
efficient, and, in consequence, the atmospheric transparency increases, particularly at optical
wavelengths. The net result is depletion and eventual elimination of absorption due to TiO
and VO, and the transition from spectral type M to type L. In contrast, metal hydride lines

Brown Dwarfs 7
381
strengthen, as in low metallicity halo subdwarfs, since the available metals are preferentially
found in these species in higher pressure atmospheres. At the same time, the increased atmo-
spheric transparency pushes the photosphere deeper within the atmosphere in the optical,
resulting in extremely broad alkali lines, such as the Na D lines and K I 7,600 Å doublet, due to
the increased column through the atmosphere and substantial pressure broadening at τ = .
Dust also plays a significant role in determining the spectral energy distribution at longer
wavelengths in late-M and L dwarfs. Energy absorbed at shorter wavelengths heats the dust,
leading to reradiation at longer wavelengths and backwarming in the upper atmosphere. Back-
warming dissociates HO in late-type M and L dwarfs, producing shallower steam absorption
bands at near-infrared wavelengths. The details of these processes depend crucially on where
dust resides within the atmosphere, whetherit forms clouds, and on the covering factors ofthose
clouds. L dwarfs exhibit substantial dispersion in their near-infrared and mid-infrared colors
at a given spectral type, and this probably reflects differences in the detailed dust distribution
within their atmospheres.
There is general consensus that the cloud layer lies deeper within the atmosphere in T
dwarfs. As a consequence, dust should play a lesser role in influencing their spectral energy
distribution and photometric properties. However, the detailed behavior depends on the exact
structure (depth, thickness, and covering factor) adopted for the cloud layer within the atmo-
sphere model, and different models predict 10–20% bandstrength differences in spectral fea-
tures at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. These predictions have been constrained to some
extent by observations from Spitzer, but a more thorough understanding must await higher res-
olution, higher signal-to-noise spectroscopy with other large telescopes, particularly the James
Webb Space Telescope.
Brown dwarfs have substantial rotational velocities. Consequently, the coolest T dwarfs
might be expected to develop spatial structure within their atmosphere, possibly including the
latitudinal banding and large-scale cloud features that are evident in Solar System gas giants,
notably Jupiter. Such features might give rise to systematic photometric variations as they are
carried in and out of the line of sight by the brown dwarfs rapid rotation. As with starspots, sig-
natures of chromospheric activity, searching for such features requires coordinated photometric
monitoring campaigns, but in this case observations need to be made at near- and mid-infrared
wavelengths where the effects ofclouds are most prominent. Afew investigations have been con-
ducted to date, and short-lived photometric variability at the ∼0.5% level has been detected in
a handful of late-L and early-T dwarfs (e.g., Artigau et al. 2009; Morales-Calderon et al. 2006),
while spectroscopic monitoring suggests that some features (including FeH, VO, K I, and the
water bands) may be vary in strength by 2–10% (Bailer-Jones 2008).
The observed modulations have periodicities of a few hours, consistent with rotation, and
may well be a consequence of variations in cloud cover within the atmosphere (brown dwarf
weather). Further observations, spanning longer time series for individual dwarfs and a wider
sample of targets, are required to probe the spectral characteristics and lifetimes of these fea-
tures. In principle, these observations offer the potential to probe the temperature structure of
brown dwarf atmospheres, and perhaps provide insight into the intrinsic properties of gas giant
exoplanet atmospheres.
4.3 Y Dwarfs
The coolest T dwarfs, and hence the coolest brown dwarfs, currently known have effective tem-
peratures that are estimated as below 700 K (Burgasser et al. 2006a). However, >Fig. 7-5 shows

382 7
Brown Dwarfs
that low-mass brown dwarfs are predicted to achieve much lower temperatures at ages of a few
Gyrs, and modeling of the likely brown dwarf luminosity functions (> Fig. 7-9) suggests that
“room-temperature” 300 K dwarfs should be common in the Solar Neighborhood. Such objects
have extremely low luminosities, less than × −L⊙, and none have yet been detected. How-
ever, theoretical models have been used to predict their likely photometric and spectroscopic
properties.
> Figure 7-26 shows the predicted spectral energy distributions for brown dwarfs at tem-
peratures of ∼600, 425, and 225 K. As the temperature drops, the broad atomic features due to
alkaline metals weaken and disappear, and features due to new molecular species appear. In

particular, absorption bands due to ammonia (NH) become evident at temperatures below
500 K, particularly at 1.5, 1.95, ad 2.95 μm. These bands are likely to become the spectral sig-
nature for spectral class Y. At the same time, methane absorption strengthens at 2.2, 3.3, and
7.8 μm, and the HO steam bands continue to be prominent features at near- and mid-infrared
wavelengths, notably at 1.5 μm.
The overall spectral energy distributions steepen sharply at optical wavelengths with
decreasing temperature. At 600K, the flux decrement between the H-band (1.6 μm) and R-band
(0.65 μm) is ∼10; by 225 K, the offset has risen to ∼10. The numerous molecular absorption
features tend to concentrate the emitted energy within a few relatively transparent windows,
notably the JHK bands at near-infrared wavelengths, and at 4 μm and 10 μm in the mid-
infrared. The peak energy in those windows is relatively flat at 600 K, but the shift in the overall
energy distribution at cooler temperatures pushes the peak flux distribution into the M-band.
The spectra plotted in > Fig. 7-26 are all scaled to the same distance (10 parsecs) and
emphasize the low luminosities of the coolest brown dwarfs. As a guide, the peak flux in the
H-band decreases by a factor of ∼10as the effective temperature drops from 600 K to 226 K;
this corresponds to a decrease from MH ∼to MH ∼. The flux decrement is less in the
M-band, but still corresponds to close to a factor of 10. Thus, these models suggest that high
sensitivity wide-field surveys at 5 μm are likely to be a powerful means of finding old, cool
brown dwarfs.
Ground-based surveys in the mid-infrared are rendered extremely difficult by the poor
transparency and highly variable behavior of the terrestrial atmosphere at those wavelengths.
Space-based surveys avoid those issues. The Wide-field Infrared SurveyExplorer(WISE: Wright
et al. 2010) carried out such a survey, imaging the full sky in several passbands between 3
and 24 μm. Although a relatively small-aperture telescope, WISE is capable of detecting room-
temperature brown dwarfs within a few parsecs of the Sun. Examples of Y dwarfs may also turn
up in focused searches for cool companions to known nearby stars, a search technique discussed
further in >Sect. 5. As of mid-2011, both approaches have been successful in identifying dwarfs
with effective temperatures cooler than 400 K and spectra consistent with those expected for Y
dwarfs. Those objects and further examples will be studied in detail by the James Webb Space
Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2018, which is equipped with cameras and spectrographs
that cover near- and mid-infrared wavelengths.

Brown Dwarfs as Companions
Binarity is a key characteristic of stellar and substellar systems, as discussed in detail in
>Chap. 16 of this volume. Properties such as the overall frequency and the distributions of
mass ratio and semimajor axis can give crucial insight into the star formation process, and
into the subsequent evolution of the circumstellar environment. In the case of brown dwarf
companions, higher-mass, main-sequence primaries can supply crucial, and otherwise unob-
tainable, constraints on the space motions, composition, age, and mass of these cool systems.
Brown dwarf binaries provide vital information on the origins of very low-mass systems.
Finding low-mass companions: A wide variety of complementary techniques have been
employed in searching for low-luminosity, brown dwarf binaries. Direct imaging is most effec-
tive for systems with large separations, particularly when coupled with either astrometric or

384 7

multicolor photometric information. The initial forays into this area were based on photo-
graphic data, notably the Lowell Observatory proper motion survey by H. Giclas and his
coworkers, and on Luytens extensive analyses of plates taken by the 48-inch Schmidt at Palomar.
Those observations are not well suited to detecting extremely cool brown dwarfs, although the
nearest early-type L dwarfs are visible on the red-sensitive Schmidt plates. More recent investi-
gations have focused on CCD data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and near-infrared imaging
from the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey.
Direct imaging from wide-field surveys is limited to detecting binary systems with angular
separations exceeding 2–3 arc seconds, more in the case of binaries with bright main-sequence
components. Ultracool L and T dwarfs are readily observable to distances of 20–30 parsecs, so
this resolution corresponds to linear separations of tens of Astronomical Units (AU). Direct
imaging at smaller separations (∼0.1 arc seconds) is possible either using the Hubble Space
Telescope at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, or with large ground-based telescopes
employing adaptive optics (AO) techniques at near-infrared wavelengths. Those observations
push the linear resolution to a few AU for the nearer systems.
Completeness limits for direct imaging surveys can be specified in a relatively straight-
forward fashion as magnitude limits, usually with some radial variation close to the primary.
Binary systems at smaller separations are detectable through a number of indirect techniques
that also offer lower completeness. Photometric catalogues can be used to identify systems
whose components have very different temperatures by searching for objects with anomalous
colors. White dwarf/brown dwarf systems, for example, are blue at optical/ultraviolet wave-
lengths, but extremely red at far-red and near-infrared wavelengths. This technique is useful
only for systems with similar luminosities, but was responsible for the discovery of the first L
dwarf, GD 165B (as discussed further below). Time series photometry is required to identify
eclipsing binaries. Such systems are rare, but offer a treasure trove of information.
Radial velocity monitoring is a powerful method for searching for close binary companions.
Recent years have seen extensive use of this technique to search for very low-mass (specifically,
planetary mass) companions of the nearest stars. Such systems, with components of unequal
luminosity, are identified as single-lined binaries (SB1), where the spectral line of the primary
show periodic velocity variations with amplitude K∝Msini
M
P/. The period is measured directly,
and one can infer the mass of the primary component from its luminosity and spectral type.
However, the mass of the companion is determined uniquely only if the orbital inclination is
known. That parameter is known for eclipsing systems, where the orbit must be aligned close
to i = .
Inclinations can be derived for SB1 systems if an astrometric orbit can be measured for
the primary star. This was the method employed by Friedrich Bessel to infer the existence of Sir-
ius B in the 1840s, but the technique has a chequered history in searches for low-mass compan-
ions. In particular, planetary-mass companions have come and gone around nearby late-type
dwarfs, such as Barnard’s star, as astrometric analyses have first identified periodic wobbles, and
then resolved such variations as systematic instrumental effects. Reliable astrometric data for
low-mass systems is scarce and, to be fully effective, must be obtained at the microarcsecond
level to detect brown dwarf companions at modest separations. Such measurementsare coming
within range of potential future ground- and space-based instrumentation.
If components have similar luminosities, then the systemusually forms a double-lined spec-
troscopic binary (SB2) with spectral features due to both evident in the combined spectrum.
(Exceptions are systems with white dwarf components with featureless spectra.) In double-
lined systems, the relative velocity amplitudes of the two components scale inversely with the

Brown Dwarfs 7

component mass ratio (i.e., the lower-mass component has higher velocity amplitude). As with
single-lined systems, transforming those mass ratios to absolute masses requires determination
of the orbital inclination.
At present, most high-precision spectroscopic surveys are still limited to optical wave-
lengths, reducing the potential for identifying close binaries with low-mass primaries. Stability
is the crucial factor in obtaining the meter/second resolution that is required for detecting
planetary-mass companions. This is ensured at optical wavelengths by imprinting reference
lines on the spectrum via an iodine cell. Considerable effort is being invested in extending that
technique to near-infrared wavelengths, closer to the peak flux of red dwarf primaries. A further
complication for ultracool dwarfs is their rapid rotation, which lowers the effective resolution
and limits the ability to detect very low-mass companions.
Finally, one other technique has the potential to identify brown dwarfs in binary systems:
gravitational microlensing. This occurs when a foreground object, the lens, aligns closely with
a background source. As the lens moves across the line of sight, the light from the background
source is focused gravitationally and amplified. The source brightens equally at all wavelengths,
peaks in brightness when lens and source are at closest separation, and subsequently declines
as the angular separation increases. If the lens has a binary companion at an appropriate orien-
tation, then that companion will also amplify the background source, producing a secondary
spike in the light curve. Microlensing events are almost always one-off events, with the lens often
never observed separately from the background source. Consequently, it is usually impossible
to obtain direct information on the foreground object. The duration of the event depends on the
mass of the foreground lens and the transverse motion. The latter parameter can be estimated if
one assumes membership of a particular stellar population (typically, the Galactic disk). Thus,
as data are accrued for more and more events, statistical analysis allows one to infer the broad
properties of those objects, including the likely frequency of brown dwarf and planetary-mass
companions. At the present time, this technique is starting to provide useful constraints on
planetary system architecture, but has had almost no impact on brown dwarf astronomy.
The following sections describe how these different techniques have been combined to
provide information on brown dwarfs in binary systems.
5.1 Brown Dwarf Companions to Main-Sequence Stars
Main-sequence binaries with low-mass companions have played a crucial role in the discovery
and characterization of ultracool dwarfs in general, and brown dwarfs in particular. Low-
luminosity dwarfs are detectable, even at infrared wavelengths, within a limited volume. The
surface density of isolated dwarfs is low: There are ∼2,000 M dwarfs within 20 parsecs of the
Sun, or one per ∼20 square degrees; there are approximately 100 L dwarfs, or one per ∼400
square degrees. Those statistics have emerged only within the last few years, but the concep-
tual problem has been clear for decades. One means of circumventing the issue is to search for
companions to brighter stars that are already known to be in the immediate vicinity of the Sun.
This is the “under the lamppost” search technique: A certain proportion of stars are binaries;
therefore, rather than searching the full local volume, concentrate on areas where the presence
of a known nearby star heightens the probability of finding a much lower luminosity star or
brown dwarf.
A brief history: The earliest major discovery was the prototype ultracool dwarf, van
Biesbroeck’s star, also known as Gl 752B and VB 10. Discovered in 1944 by the Belgian

386 7
Brown Dwarfs
astronomer George-Achille van Biesbroeck as a wide, common proper motion companion of
an M3 dwarf within 5 parsecs of the Sun, this M8 dwarf was the first ultracool dwarf (albeit a
designation that was not invented for another 50 years), and held the record as the lowest lumi-
nosity known star for more than 40 years. In the 1960s, van Biesbroeck added 20 additional cool
companions to nearby stars, including VB 8, an M7 dwarf, and VB 7, an extremely cool white
dwarf.
Three highly interesting objects emerged from companion searches in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. First, a photometric survey of white dwarfs turned up two sources with signifi-
cant excess radiation at infrared wavelengths: G 39-28, and GD 165. In the former case, further
observations showed that the excess was produced by cool dust, perhaps remnants of a plan-
etary system, but imaging of the latter star revealed a cool, extremely red resolved companion
at a separation of ∼50 AU (Becklin and Zuckerman 1988). The companions optical spectrum
is clearly unusual for an M dwarf, but initial interpretations were confused by the potential for
pollution by mass lost from the higher-mass star during its red giant and asymptotic giant evo-
lutionary phases. GD 165B is now recognized as an L4 dwarf, with a mass very close to the
hydrogen-burning limit.
Almost contemporaneously, radial velocity surveys led to the identification of a very low-
mass companion to HD 114762, a mildly metal-poor F-type star at a distance of ∼40 parsecs
(Latham et al. 1989). This discovery continues to highlight the ambiguities of such detections.
The formal mass estimateis ∼.M⊙, well below the hydrogen-burning limit, but, as a single-
lined, unresolved system with unknown inclination, it remains unclear whether the companion
is a low-mass star, a brown dwarf, or a high-mass exoplanet. The latest analyses suggest that the
observed rotational velocity of the F-type primary is most consistent with an inclination of
15–20○, implying a companion mass of ∼.M⊙, but the data are consistent with a mass
anywhere between ∼.M⊙and ∼.M⊙.
As discussed in >Sect. 1, the dénouement came in the early 1990s, when a coronagraphic
survey of stars in the immediate Solar Neighborhood revealed an extremely low-luminosity
companion to a nondescript M0.5 dwarf, Gl 229, lying ∼5 parsecs distant. The companion,
Gl 229B, is 13 magnitudes fainter than the primary in the ∼7,500 Å I-band, placing it firmly
within the brown dwarf régime (Nakajima et al. 1995). Crucially, spectroscopy revealed strong
methane absorption at near-infrared wavelengths, more reminiscent of gas giant planets than
cool stars. Gl 229B is, of course, the archetypical T dwarf, with a temperature of ∼950 K and
a mass between 0.03 and 0.06 M⊙. Thus, the first ultracool dwarf (VB 10), the first L dwarf
(GD 165B) and the first T dwarf (Gl229B) were all discovered because they are companions to
previously known nearby stars.
By a curious coincidence, the discoveries of Gl 229B and of the first extrasolar planet, 51
Pegb, were announced at the same scientific meeting in late 1995. The latter discovery ener-
gized the few radial velocity exoplanet surveys then underway, and stimulated a number of new
surveys. Observations have tended to concentrate on solar-type stars for obvious reasons and,
as a result, reliable statistics are now in place on the companion mass distribution for those
stars. A key feature that emerged early on in those surveys was the scarcity of brown dwarfs
within 10 AU of the primary star, characterized as the “brown dwarf desert.” With the passage
of time, and the acquisition of complementary radial velocity and imaging data for statistically
well-defined samples, it becomes clear that this characterization oversimplifies the situation.
Statistics: >Figure 7-27 shows the companion mass as a function of separation for solar-type
stars (spectral types late-F to early-K) within 25 parsecs of the Sun. This is essentially complete
for brown dwarfs and low-mass stars, since almost all these stars are included in exoplanet radial

no more than a handful of companions with 0.01 <

M⊙< 0.5 and Δ < 10AU – the brown dwarf
desert extends through the M dwarf régime (Adapted from Reid and Hawley 2005)
velocity surveys. No correction for orbital inclination has been applied to the mass estimates
derived from radial velocity measurements. Masses for wide companions are inferred from their
photometric properties. The brown dwarf desert is strikingly obvious at separations less that
10 AU, with a significant number of very low-mass (M < .M⊙) exoplanetary companions,
but only two brown dwarfs. However, it is also evidentthat the scarcity of low-mass companions
extends to ∼.M⊙; that is, the brown dwarf desert is accompanied by an M-dwarf desert and
even a K-dwarf desert (Burgasser et al. 2007). Turning this around, it is clear that there is a
strong bias toward near-equal mass companions at separations less than ∼50 AU in solar-type
binary systems. Lower-mass companions appear at wider separations, and an analysis of the
companion mass function shows much greater consistency with the field mass function at those
separations.
It is likely that > Fig. 7-27 is providing key insight in binary formation. The preference
for equal-mass systems at small separation suggests that competitive accretion quickly disrupts
potential low-mass ratio (q = M
M) binaries during the early stages of star formation; in brief,
big stars do not let little stars form next to them. The low-mass exoplanets present at small
separations (Δ < AU) undoubtedly form within the circumstellar disk. Similar patterns are
emerging for lower-mass primaries, as discussed further in >Sect. 5.2.

388 7
Brown Dwarfs
Indeed, >Fig. 7-27 may be offering a means of segregating brown dwarfs and jupiter-like
exoplanets. Both objects form by accretion, but within different environments, and therefore
have different internal structures and compositions. Those intrinsic differences result in very
subtle differences in the resultant spectrophotometric properties. Consequently, brown dwarf
and planets are essentially indistinguishable through direct observations. >Figure 7-27, how-
ever, suggests that theymaybe distinguishable indirectly, through theiroccupying near-separate
spatial domains, with a maximum separation for gas giant planets set by the characteristics of
the protoplanetary disk, and a minimum separation for brown dwarfs set by the gravitational
field of the primary star. One may conjecture that the boundary between these two domains
lies at radii between 50 and 100 AU in solar mass stars, scaling to smaller separations in lower-
mass stars with smaller protostellar disks and, perhaps, lower-mass planets. In higher-mass
stars, with more massive disks, the boundary likely lies at larger radii, and formation of exo-
planets with masses well into the brown dwarf régime may be possible. As an example, the
HR 8799 planetary system that was recently resolved through round-based imaging has an
∼A5 primary and super-Jovian planetary companions with masses that may be in the range
15–20 MJup.
Statistical analyses indicate that, in contrast to the inner desert, brown dwarfs (and low-
mass stars) are not uncommon (∼5%) as companions to main-sequence stars (Metchev and
Hillenbrand 2009). This is useful, since the higher-mass primaries offer a means of better
characterizing the properties of ultracool dwarfs, whose complex spectra continue to present
strong challenges to theoretical models. It is reasonable to assume that binary components are
coeval, and that they are formed from essentially identical materials. Thus, metallicities and
ages derived for the main-sequence primary are also likely to be valid for the companion.
Several star/brown dwarf systems can be highlighted as of particular interest:
Gl 569Bab: In the late 1980s, near-infrared observations revealed a late-type M dwarf com-
panion to this nearby mid-type M dwarf. The primary is chromospherically
active, with an age estimated as ∼300 Myrs. A decade later, AO-assisted imaging
resolved the companion into close M8.5 and M9 components with an orbital
period of ∼2.5 years. Dynamical mass estimates for the two components are
0.055–0.08 and 0.05–0.07 M⊙.
є IndiBab: At a distance of only 3.6 parsecs, these are the second closest brown dwarfs cur-
rently known. Originally identified from photographic material as a common
proper motion companion lying ∼7 arc minutes from the K5 primary, high-
resolution imaging has resolved the system into a pair of T dwarfs, spectral
types T1 and T6. The system is estimated to have an age in the range 0.8–
2 Gyrs, leading to mass estimates of 0.05 and 0.02 M⊙for the two brown dwarfs.
With an orbital period of ∼15 years, dynamical mass measurements will be
possible by 2020.
HD 114762B: Already discussed here with reference to the Msin ∼.M⊙radial veloc-
ity companion, subsequent AO-assisted imaging resulted in the identification
of a faint, red companion lying ∼3.3 arc seconds from the primary. This system
is metal-poor: The primary has a well-determined metallicity of [Fe/H]=−.,
and has an estimated age of 11 Gyrs. It is likely that the companion lies
slightly above the hydrogen-burning limit, but this ultracool dwarf provides
crucial quantitative insight into the spectral evolution of ultracool dwarfs at
subsolar metallicities.

389
TW Hya 5B: The TW Hydrae group is an association of very young (τ < Myr) stars lying
at distances of 50–60 parsecs from the Sun. TW Hya 5A, or CD-33 7795, is an
early-type M dwarf binary whose components likely have massesof 0.6–0.7 M⊙.
TW Hya 5B is an M8 dwarf, lying ∼100 AU from the primary with a likely mass
of ∼.M⊙. This young system serves as benchmark for the early stages of
evolution of low-mass brown dwarfs.
5.2 Brown Dwarf Binaries
The mass limit for the detection of secondary components in binary systems depends on the
properties of the primary star. The higher the mass of the primary, the lower the reflex motion
due to a companion of fixed mass at a given separation, and the higher precision required in
radial velocity surveys. Similarly, the higher the primary mass, the higher the luminosity and
the higher the flux limit for detection of a companion at small angular separations. Given these
constraints, considerable effort has been devoted in recent years to pushing surveys to the lowest
possible masses by searching for faint companions to nearby ultracool dwarfs.
Recent years have seen the compilation of extensive catalogues of ultracool M, L, and T
dwarfs from the SDSS, DENIS, and 2 MASS surveys. Companion searches have focused on the
nearest such dwarfs, particularly those within 20 parsecs of the Sun. Radial velocity surveys
remain relatively restricted in scope, complicated both by the need for observations at near-
infrared wavelengths for the cooler sources, and by the tendency for L and T dwarfs to have
substantial rotational velocities, reducing the sensitivity to orbital motions. A few single-lined
binaries have been discovered, all late-type M dwarfs. The only double-lined system identified
to date is the young eclipsing binary, 2MASS0535-0546 (see >Sect. 3.7), a memberof the Orion
Nebula Cluster.
High-resolution imaging surveys of local ultracool dwarfs are much more extensive in
scope. Near-infrared HST data are available for over 70 L dwarfs and 25 T dwarfs within
20 parsecs of the Sun (Reid et al. 2008a; Burgasser et al. 2006b), and those data are supple-
mented by ground-based near-infrared AO imaging of comparable resolution. As discussed
in > Sect. 2.4, ultracool dwarfs in the field are likely to have masses close to the hydrogen-
burning limit and typical ages of several Gyrs; consequently, any very low-mass brown dwarf
companions in those systems are likely to have faded to extremely low luminosities and become
correspondingly difficult to detect. In an attempt to deal with those issues, extensive surveys
using HST and ground-based AO have also been undertaken of low-mass members of nearby
open clusters, including the Hyades, Pleiades, and α Persei, and of the nearest star formation
regions, including the Scorpius-Centaurus, ρ Ophiuchi, and Chamaeleon associations. Very
low-mass brown dwarfs are brighter and correspondingly easier to detect in these younger sys-
tems, but, at distances of 40–150 parsecs, current observations cannot probe linear separations
smaller than 5–15 AU.
Combining the results from these various surveys, ≈15% of nearby L and T dwarfs are
resolved as binaries with separation exceeding ∼3 AU. The available radial velocity data suggest
that no more than 5–10% are spectroscopic binaries, implying an overall binary fraction <%
(Burgasser et al. 2007). This is significantly lower than the ∼70% determined for solar-type stars,
and lower even than the ∼35% cited for M dwarfs. Moreover, there is a clear tendency toward
near-equal luminosity, implying near-equal mass, among the ultracool systems. The latter result
is illustrated in >Fig. 7-28, which shows data for L dwarf binaries within 20 parsecs of the Sun,

and mass ratios (q). The latter indicate that these observations are capable of detecting binaries
with q ∼.over a wide range of separations for brown dwarfs with age 5 Gyrs; that is, even if
the local brown dwarf population is dominated by 0.07 M⊙dwarfs, companions with masses as
low as 0.035 M⊙should be readily detectable. Their absence suggests that such high-mass ratio
systems are rare.
The tendency toward equal-mass systems may have important implications for the apparent
spectral evolution of brown dwarf binaries in key regions of the HR diagram. As discussed
in >Sect. 3.2, the MJ and MK/spectral-type relations exhibit significant flattening in the vicinity
of the L/T transition. Observations show that this is at least partly due to the presence of binaries
comprising of a late-L and an early-type T component. However, statistical analyses show that
the underlying binary fraction is consistent with that estimated for early-L and late-T dwarfs
(Burgasser 2007).

the distribution peaking in the range 3–10 AU. Wider systems are known, but primarily in star-
forming associations, such as Sco-Cen and Taurus, and among the youngest members of the
field population, including DENIS 0551-4434AB, GQ Lupi, and 2M1207-39AB (discussed fur-
ther below). > Figure 7-29 puts these results for brown dwarf binaries in the broader stellar
context. There is a clear scaling between the maximum separation of binary components, amax,
and the total system mass, Mt. At high masses, this appears to scale as M
tot, but at ∼.M⊙the
relation steepens and can be represented by an exponential dependence. Computing the bind-
ing energy for these systems, Ebind ∝MMa−, the widest brown dwarf binaries in the Solar
Neighborhood have binding energies almost an order of magnitude higher than wide stellar
binaries. There are some indications of a distinct transition in the low-energy limit for systems
with total mass exceeding .M⊙, matching the transition between the exponential and M

dynamical disruption is responsible for modifying the initial separation distribution of very
low-mass binaries to give the sharply truncated distribution evident among local field dwarfs.
One of the young brown dwarf binary systems, 2M1207-39ABm deserves particular men-
tion. This system is a memberof the TW Hydrae association, whose age is estimatedas ∼8 Myrs.
The primary is spectral type M8 and has a mass in the range 0.025–0.045 M⊙. The secondary
is 8 magnitudes fainter, has an inferred mass of 4–6 MJup, corresponding to a mass ratio
q ∼., and is occasionally described as a planetary companion. The separation between the
two components is ∼40 AU, placing the secondary well beyond the likely extent of the primary’s
protoplanetary disk, and beyond the extent of any plausible planet formation. Thus, describ-
ing 2M1207B (and its ilk) in planetary terms is more than a little misleading. Nonetheless,
2M1207-39B remains of considerable interest as the lowest-mass brown dwarf yet discovered,
and, consequently, an important indicator that fragmentation or accretion processes within
molecular clouds are capable of producing star-like objects with masses of ∼0.005 M⊙(Lodato
et al. 2005).
5.3 Ultracool Binaries in Context
Pulling together the observations summarized in the previous sections, there are three key
properties that are associated with ultracool binary systems:
•
The overall binary fraction is lower than 25%. This maintains the trend of decreasing
multiplicity with decreasing primary mass that is evident at stellar masses.
•
There is a strong tendencytoward near-equal mass systems among low-mass binarysystems,
both above and below substellarboundary. This is consistent with the mass ratiodistribution
measured for close binaries at higher masses.
•
Very low-mass binaries in the field are generally confined to separations less than 10–15 AU,
although wider systems are occasionally found in very young groups and associations.
This extends an overall trend evident among stellar binaries toward decreasing maximum
separation with lower total system mass.
These properties can be accounted for in a self-consistent manner within the broader
scheme of stellar binarity, where brown dwarf binaries represent the low-mass extreme of a
continuum that stretches through solar-type stars to massive OB binary systems. Qualitatively,
one might expect the number of binary systems to depend on the range of possible semi-major
axes. >Figure 7-29 shows that the maximum separation, amax, for stable systems varies with
the total system, mass, probably reflecting the gravitational binding energy. Consequently, one
might infer that higher-mass primaries have a higher probability of retaining companions, and
therefore the overall binary fraction should decrease with the mass of the primary. At the same
time, data for solar-type stars show that equal-mass systems tend to dominate at small separa-
tions, leading to the K/M/brown dwarf desert (>Fig. 7-27). Indeed, one might consider dividing
binaries into two classes: near-equal mass close systems; and wide systems, where the compan-
ion mass function is much closer to the IMF. In solar-type stars, “close” and “wide” binaries
are represented in almost equal proportions. But as amax decreases with decreasing mass, one
can envisage the “close” systems coming to dominate the sample, leading to an overwhelming
number of equal-mass systems at very low masses. Of course, it is important to emphasize that
this is a highly qualitative scenario, and, as yet, there is no full understanding of the physical
mechanisms that underlie binary formation and govern the dynamical evolution of systems.

Summary and Conclusions
Over the past 20 years, brown dwarfs have evolved from a much sought after theoretical con-
cept to an integral part of observational astrophysics. Several hundred unequivocal examples of
isolated or binary substellar mass objects are now known, ranging from ∼3,000 K mid-type M
dwarfs through 2,100–1,300 K L dwarfs to T dwarfs with effective temperaturesas low as 600 K.
Extensive multiwavelength observations of this growing compendium of ultracool dwarfs have
defined the spectrophotometric characteristics of these low-temperature objects, and allowed
theoretical astrophysicists to refine their models of the atmospheres and interior structure.
Detailed observations at X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths show that these systems retain
magnetic fields with strengths that are comparable to mid-type M dwarfs, but the activity mani-
fests itself in a manner that is more consistent with Solar System gas giant planets that low-mass
stars. Brown dwarfs are constituents of binary systems, both as (usually wide) companions of
more massive primaries and as near-equal mass, small-separation ultracool systems. In num-
bers, surveys of the local field and nearby young clusters and associations give results that are
in broad consensus, showing that the mass function is flat or declining in the substellar regime.
Brown dwarfs are not a viable source of substantive quantities of dark matter.
As the number of ultracool dwarfs catalogued by high-sensitivity, wide-field surveys has
increased, brown dwarf astronomy has transitioned from discovery to characterization. Larger
samples, drawn from a variety of survey methods, provide better estimatesof the range of prop-
erties of individual systems, circumventing biases that can be introduced by particular search
techniques. The resultant datasets allow a thorough exploration of correlations between differ-
ent parameters,such as near-infrared colors and the presence of dust or variations in metallicity.
At the same time, these more extensive datasets open the possibility of finding unusual ultracool
dwarfs, whose properties might provide insight on rare or short-lived evolutionary phenomena.
The next step in brown dwarf exploration will be extending coverage to substantially cooler
systems, the much-anticipated Y dwarfs. Several deep imaging surveys are currently under-
way that offer prospects of achieving this goal, and the first plausible candidates are starting
to emerge. However, following historical precedent, one might anticipate that the first unam-
biguous example will be identified through an entirely different avenue, perhaps even as a wide
companion to a known nearby star.

Further Reading
Reid and Hawley (2005) remains the only textbook that focuses exclusively on low-mass celes-
tial objects, from M dwarf stars through brown dwarfs to extrasolar planets. That text provides
a thorough summary of the consensus knowledge of brown dwarf characteristics at that time,
and places those systems in the broader context of the astrophysics of low-mass stars and the
Galactic structure parameters of the various stellar populations in the Milky Way. More detailed
information on specific areas, and more recent advances in our understanding, are covered
by a number of useful review articles. The review article by Burrows et al. (2001) provides a
thorough evaluation of the evolution and interior structure of low-mass dwarfs. Kirkpatrick’s
(2005) annual reviews article gives an excellent overview of the spectroscopic properties of
cool dwarfs, while Burgasser et al. (2007) discuss binarism in ultracool dwarfs. Kirkpatrick
and Burgasser have reviewed the spectroscopic properties of L and T dwarfs, respectively, in

Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
Abstract:
A brief discussion of the physics and numerical techniques for stellar evolution
of solar and intermediate-mass stars is followed by a detailed description of the evolution of
a M⊙star from the main sequence through the red giant branch, He-core burning, and on
to the thermal-pulse AGB evolution. He-shell flashes and the associated mixing as well as the
nucleosynthesis are discussed, including the s process. Post-AGB evolution including post-AGB
He-shell flashes are presented. Variations of the evolution as a function of mass, the initial–final
mass relation, and lifetimes are summarized. Peculiarities of intermediate-massAGB stars, hot-
bottom burning, the super-AGB stars, as well as low-mass stellar evolution through the He-core
flash are described in detail. The evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars is presented.
The final chapter covers some aspects of the dynamical star that are not well described in the
spherically symmetric framework of stellar evolution.
1
Introduction
There are different ways in which stellar evolution can be grouped as a function of initial mass.
The most obvious distinction is in terms of the final outcome. At solar metallicity stars more
massive than ∼M⊙will eventually explode as a core-collapse supernova, while stars with ini-
tially smaller masswill end their lives as white dwarfs. At the low-massend, stars only a little less
massive than the sun will have lifetimes exceeding the age of the universe. For example, a star
with initially .M⊙and a metal content of Z = .would ignite He only after ∼.× yr.
While the detailed main-sequence evolution of such stars is important, for example, for the
determination of ages in globular clusters, such low-mass stars would not yet have evolved
through advanced stages and eventually into white dwarfs. However, especially these advanced
stages, including the evolution following He-core burning, on the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) and through the He-shell flashes (or thermal pulses, to be used synonymously), are
responsible for an important aspect of stellar evolution: the formation of the elements through
nucleosynthesis.
The solar and intermediate-mass stars can therefore be defined as those which end their
lives as white dwarfs. When studying the evolution of stars in this mass range, there may be
different aspects to be interested in, which may be related to specific ways in which stars can
be investigated through observations. For example, stars as members of populations and their
appearance in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HRD) or color-magnitude diagram are inves-
tigated through photometry or spectrophotometry. Such a diagram is shown in >Fig. 8-1 for
a set of solar and intermediate-mass stars, and the features of these evolutionary tracks will
be discussed in detail in this chapter. This area has now expanded into using abundance trac-
ers to characterize stellar populations (e.g., Venn et al. 2004, for the case of dwarf spheriodal
galaxies), aided enormously through the now common place use of multi-object, fiber optics
spectroscopy. Another important avenue to investigate the physics and evolution of stars is
asteroseismology, and new space missions, like NASA’s Kepler mission, or previously the Cana-
dian MOST satellite, provide data of unprecedented quality that allow probing directly the
otherwise inaccessible mechanical properties ofstellarinteriors. Acase ofparticularimportance
is of course the sun, which is very well studied through helioseismology.
Finally, stars reveal their internal workings through the surface abundances of elements, and
in some cases isotopes, that can be measured spectroscopically. While stars, at least in the solar
neighborhood, have formed out of material that is very similar in its composition compared to

the solar abundance distribution, many stars are known with very nonsolar abundance patterns.
In most cases, these nonsolar abundance patterns are the result of internal nucleosynthesis pro-
cesses in the deep stellar interior in combination with mixing processes that bring the nuclear
burning products to the stellar surface. In some cases, observed abundance patterns are due to
external contamination in a binary star system.
Binary stellar evolution cannot only lead to such a chemical pollution of a companion, but
many binary stars will interact at some point in their lives. The evolution of such interacting
binaries, for example,through a common envelope evolution (e.g., Ricker and Taam 2008; Passy
et al. 2012) will lead to the formation of several types of very important systems, often involving
at least one compact member. For example, the progenitor evolution of the important class of
thermonuclear supernova (SN Type Ia) involves at least one binary interaction of this type. The
impact of binarity on stellar evolution is treated elsewhere in
>Chap. 13.
The different ways of investigating stars through observations are complemented by the-
oretical investigation of stellar physics. The combination of theories and models of the many
microscopic and macroscopic processes, that affect the evolution of stars, into computer sim-
ulations leads to quantitative models of stellar evolution. These are, under certain simplifying
assumptions, as, for example, the assumption of spherical symmetry, able to quantitatively fol-
low the global evolution of stars from their birth on the pre-main sequence through a series of
nuclear burning stages and thermal transition phases all the way to their final white dwarf star
destination.

Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
These stellar evolution models are continuously improved, then confronted with observa-
tional properties of stars described above, and then again improved. This process, while easy to
spell out in principle, is not always straight forward nor immediately successful. For example,
helioseismology shows that the radiative, that is, non-convective interior of the sun rotates as
a solid body, while the outer convectively unstable layers rotate differentially (Thompson et al.
2003). This is at odds with some models of the effect that rotation has in stellar evolution sim-
ulations, which assume rather effective transport of angular momentum in convection zones,
enforcing near-solid body rotation there, while allowing for differential rotation in the inner
layers of the sun that are not mixed through convection.
While the different observational approaches to investigate the evolution and nucleosyn-
thesis in stars are mostly covered in other chapters of this book, this chapter describes the
evolution and nucleosynthesis of solar and intermediate-mass stars as it presents itself accord-
ing to the state of the art of global simulations of stars through computer simulations, that is,
through stellar evolution computations. With all its limitations in mind (see previous para-
graph for an example), a very detailed and in many ways probably realistic picture of the overall
evolution, nucleosynthesis processes and yields, and final outcomes has emerged. And as the
various aspects of this picture of stellar evolution will be presented, the many unsolved and
open questions will be pointed out as well.
This chapter is organized as follows. In >Sect. 2, the physics and to a limited extend the
computational ingredients needed to construct realistic models of stars and their evolution,
including the nuclear physics for the energy production and synthesis of the elements, are
reviewed. Then, the evolution of a M⊙star will be described from the main sequence all the
way to the post-AGB phase ( >Sect. 3). In >Sect. 4, differences in the evolution of lower and
higher mass stars are presented. The final section covers briefly evolution effects due to rotation
and dynamical interactions between nuclear energy release and convective mixing, that is not
well described within the usual one-dimensional stellar evolution framework assuming strict
spherical symmetry (>Sect. 5).

The Physics for Stellar Evolution
The basic ingredients for stellar evolution models are known for many decades now,
and the material is covered in great detail in textbooks, such as Cox and Giuli (1968),
Kippenhahn and Weigert (1990), and Hansen et al. (2004), while Clayton (1968), Rolfs and
Rodney (1988), and Iliadis (2007) are geared more toward nucleosynthesis and nuclear astro-
physics. Habing and Olofsson (2004) deal specifically with all aspects of AGB stars.
Stellar evolution codes have been constructed since the first computers became powerful
enough in the 1960s (e.g., Henyey et al. 1964; Hofmeister et al. 1964). Over time, many groups
have built sophisticated simulation codes, including more detailed and realistic physics data
and models and advancing the simulation capabilities to address stellar evolution in the most
extreme conditions. A recent and comprehensive description of a modern multipurpose stellar
evolution code was given by Paxton et al. (2011)forthe MESA code, which can be downloaded –
together with detailed instructions and examples – at http://mesa.sourceforge.net. That paper
gives a complete technical account of the input physics and numerical techniques used in stel-
lar evolution simulations today. However, the state of the MESA code described there did not
include many of its more advanced capabilities yet, as, for example, modules that attempt to

account for the effect of rotation and magnetic fields. These aspects of stellar physics have been
reviewed recently by Maeder and Meynet (2012) and will not be covered much in this chap-
ter. With so many excellent resources available, this section will only attempt to provide a basic
review of the most important concepts.
The conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy can be written down in the
following way (e.g., Clarke and Carswell 2003):
∂ρ
∂t + ∇⋅(ρu) = 
(8.1)
ρ ∂u
∂t + ρ(u ⋅∇)u = −∇p + ρg
∂E
∂t + ∇⋅[(E + p)u] = ρ ˙Q + ρ ∂Ψ
∂t
where u is the velocity, ρ the density, p the pressure, and the gravitational acceleration g
is given by the gravitational potential Ψ (g = −∇Ψ). The total energy per unit volume is
E = ρ ( 
u+ Ψ + є) and consists of the kinetic, potential, and internal energy. In each case,
the left side of the equations represent the time variation of a quantity and the spatial transfer,
while the right side contains sources and sinks. For the momentum, equation sources are the
gravitational acceleration and the pressure force, for example, of the ideal gas. In the energy,
equation Q represents all sources (e.g., from nuclear reactions) or sinks (e.g., from neutrino
losses).
Solving this set of conservation laws numerically with high enough spatial and time res-
olution, and complemented with appropriate microphysics, allows in principle to simulate all
possible behaviors of stars, except the effects of magnetic fields. However, in practice, this is not
possible just like that. The reason is the vastly different time scales (as well as spatial scales) that
interact in stars. These are the nuclear time scale, the thermal time scale, and the dynamical
time scale, and although these are very basic concepts, they are so important that it is justified
to briefly review them.
The dynamical time scale indicates how fast pressure fluctuations propagate and can be
approximated by tdyn ∼/
√
G¯ρ, where G is the gravitational constant and ¯ρ is the average
density of the star or region under consideration. For the sun, tdyn ∼h. Another way to think
of the dynamical time scale is to consider a star that suddenly looses its pressure support from
the equation of state, like in a core-collapse supernova. The star will respond by collapsing on
the dynamical time scale. Sound waves propagate through the star on the dynamical time scale.
Other processes that would be considered dynamical, as, for example, the advection flows in
convectively unstable parts of the star, are not proceeding on this dynamic time scale, but, in
this example, on the convective turnover time scale. The thermal time scale is broadly speaking
the time on which differences in internal energy or temperature equilibrate, and it is given by
ttherm ∼є/L, where є is again the internal energy of a region of interest and L is the associated
luminosity. The thermal time scale of the initial cooling of a pre-main-sequence star to the zero-
age main sequence, when H-burning first starts, is called the Kelvin–Helmholtz time scale, and
it is for the sun .× yr. Finally, the fraction of nuclear fuel (e.g., H in the core of main-
sequence stars) that provides energy єnuc to the star to temporarily halt further gravitational
contraction will be depleted on the nuclear time scale tnuc = єnuc/L, which is of the order to
yr for the sun. This global nuclear time scale determines the long-term evolution of stars in
thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium. It needs to be distinguished from a nuclear reaction time
scale of a particular reaction that may be compared with dynamical processes like convection.

402 8
Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
The evolution time scale of solar and intermediate-mass stars is either the thermal or the nuclear
time scale, depending on their evolutionary stage.
The evolution of stars is a typical example of a multi-physics, multi-scale problem where
the properties of different types of physics on vastly different scales interact in a nonlinear way.
> Equation 8.1 allows for any pressure fluctuations, that is, sound waves, to propagate through
the star. In particular, in the stellar interior, the sound speed (vs ∼
√
P/ρ for an ideal gas) is very
high, and the Courant–Friedrich–Levy condition imposes in that case very short time steps
(of the order Δt = Δx/vs, where Δx is the chosen spatial grid size). In convective He-shell
flashes, to be discussed in detail in >Sect. 3.2, for example, the sound speed is ∼1,000 km/s,
and in present-day simulations that solve (> 8.1), explicitly this implies Δt ∼.s. However,
the convective turnover time scale is of the order 1,000s while the evolutionary time (in this
case, the thermal time scale) is ∼yr. Similar arguments can be made for all other phases
of stellar evolution, and also, the fact that some effort is going into implicit solution schemes
does not alter the conclusion that it is not possible, and will not be possible in the foreseeable
future, to simulate the entire evolution of stars by solving ( > 8.1). This seems to be almost
a trivial statement. However, it is important to keep in mind that the picture of the evolution
of stars and their nucleosynthesis, that will be presented in subsequent sections, is based on
simplifications of (>8.1) and that there are a numberof unresolved properties of stars that these
simplified equations cannot accurately describe. Among these unresolved properties are many
mixing processes, and these in turn are often essential for the quantitatively reliable description
of nuclear production in stars.
In order to solve the conservation laws over the long thermal and nuclear time scales,
(> 8.1) is solved implicitly assuming spherical symmetry and, in the Lagrangian coordinate m,
the enclosed mass. The stellar evolution equations are therefore (e.g., Kippenhahn and Weigert
1990):

∂m = ∑

where r is the radius, l is the luminosity, and the єi stand for the various energy sources and
sinks (see the chapter on stellar structure for more details). The implicit solution of these equa-
tions allows to advance an evolution sequence numerically with time steps of the order of a
fraction of min(tnuc, ttherm). Often, the inertial term in the momentum equation is ignored
since stars evolve in almost perfect hydrostatic equilibrium (tdyn ≪min(tnuc, ttherm)). Indeed,
whenever the inclusion of the inertial term is really necessary, the star is probably also violating
the assumption of spherical symmetry. Most dynamic motions of fluid elements in stars are not
spherically symmetric but turbulent. These issues will be discussed more in >Sect. 5. Here, it
is only important to fully appreciate that in real stars, there are relevant processes at work that
are not described by (> 8.2).
In order to solve (> 8.2), the expression for the temperature gradient ∂T/∂m has to reflect
the dominant mode of energy transport. In solar and intermediate-mass stars, three modes of
energy transport are relevant.In convective layers, the temperaturegradient is adiabatic, at least
in the stellar interior. In the envelope where convection may be inefficient, or in convectively

stable layers, the temperature gradient is given by optically thick, gray radiation diffusion:

where κ is the Rosseland mean opacity or the electron conduction coefficient, a is the radiation-
density constant, and c the speed of light. In the electron-degenerate cores (the white dwarfs to
be) of solar and intermediate-mass stars in the advanced evolution stages, electron conduction
dominates the energy transport.
The detailed microphysics entering modern stellar evolution calculations is described else-
where. As an example, the options available in the MESA code are documented in Paxton et al.
(2011). Radiative opacities depend on the assumed composition mix. Standard tables are avail-
able for solar or solar-scaled compositions. An important improvement was the introduction of
tables with more general abundance mixes, in particular with enhanced C and O abundances
(Iglesias and Rogers 1996). These allow a more realistic treatment of advanced stages of stellar
evolution when the C and O abundance change due to nuclear burning and mixing processes.
One of the results of the adoption of these more realistic opacity tables is the greater difficulty
of computing advanced AGB models. The large opacity of C and O enriched AGB envelopes in
high-mass loss phases at the tip of the AGB makes surface layers only weakly bound, and in this
phase, the spherically symmetric simulation is at or past its application limit. Another import
advancement has been the introduction of chemistry-dependent low-temperature molecular
opacities (Marigo 2002; Cristallo et al. 2007; Weiss and Ferguson 2009; Marigo and Aringer
2009). In particular, when AGB stars become C-rich, the added sources of molecular opacity in
this chemistry regime make the stars ∼200–300 K cooler and probably boost mass loss through
enhanced dust formation (>Sect. 3.2).
The equation of state of solar and intermediate-mass stars is dominated by either the
ideal gas equation of state (including partial ionization where applicable) and the pressure
from the degenerate electron gas in the cores in advanced evolution stages (> Figs. 8-3 and
>8-6). Modern EOS routines combine tabulated data from different specialized sources that
take nonideal effects appropriately into account (e.g., Paxton et al. 2011, for references).
The terms єi in ( > 8.2) contain neutrino losses, for example, through plasmon decay and
bremsstrahlung, that are important in the high-density environments of the degeneratecores in
the advanced evolution stages of solar and intermediate-mass stars. In addition to this energy
sink, the energy generation єnuc from nuclear reactions needs to be taken into account, and
these are simultaneously responsible for composition changes:

(8.4)
where Xj is a vector containing the mass fractions of all species in zone j and the operator ˆFj
represents all reactions through which these species can interact. Instead of in terms of mass
fraction X, the network equations are rather written in terms of the number density Nm of
species m by collecting all production and destruction terms of reactions of the type k + l →
m + n:

where < σv > is the product of the cross section and the relative velocity in the center-of-mass
system averaged over the appropriate distribution function and λ is the rate for β decays. Reac-
tion rates can be obtained, for example, from (Angulo et al. 1999, http://pntpm.ulb.ac.be/Nacre/
nacre_d.htm). The number density is expressed in terms of a number fraction or mole fraction
Y = X/A, with A the atomic mass number, by N = YρNA where NA = /Mu is the Avo-
gadro number and Mu is the atomic mass number. For each reaction, an amount of energy Q is
released, which is partly in the form of neutrinos and therefore lost. The energy released from
ΔN reactions is therefore єnuc = ΔNQ = ΔYρNAQ.
Typically, in a stellar evolution simulation, only a comparatively small network needs to be
considered. It only needs to be large enough to take into account the reactions that are impor-
tant for the energy generation. For stars that end their lives as CO-white dwarfs, this can be
accomplished with approximately 15 species. A post-processing simulations can then take care
of the many trace elements that are produced in stars but do not feed back into the thermal
evolution, such as the s-process elements (>Sect. 3.2).
In addition to nuclear reactions, abundance changes are due to mixing processes, which
are often taken into account in a time-dependent manner through a diffusion equation in the
Lagrangian coordinates:
dXi
dt
mix
=
∂
∂m [(πrρ)
D(m)dXi
dm ]
(8.6)
where Xi is the radially dependent mass fraction of species i and D is a radially varying dif-
fusion coefficient that reflects the different types of mixing in stars that the calculations take
into account. The use of the diffusion equation is just a numerically convenient mathematical
tool, whereas the processes treated in this way often have nothing to do with diffusion. Most
mixing in stars is a result of convection, which is not a diffusion but an advection process.
However, in practice, the mixing efficiency inside the convection zone is so high that one can
even assume instantaneous mixing and the details of the mixing algorithm do not matter. But
there are important exceptions, as, for example, when dealing with mixing due to rotation-
induced instabilities (Maeder and Meynet 2012). It is also not clear if the partial mixing at
convective boundaries is correctly described by a diffusion process. Finally, in situations where
reactions are occurring fast compared to the convective turn-over and large-scale feedback of
energy release from nuclear burning into the convective flow can be expected, the diffusion
approximation is also probably not applicable (Herwig et al. (2011), see >Sect. 5 for details).
Macroscopic processes that are responsible for mixing in single stars can be divided into two
categories according to the time scale on which the driving mechanism operates. An efficient
convection zone (e.g., in the deep stellar interior) has an adiabatic temperature stratification.
Convection occurs in stars when energy transport through radiation alone is not efficient
enough and the radiative temperature gradient ( > 8.3) is larger than the adiabatic gradient.
As can be seen from the nominator of ( > 8.3), convective instability is triggered by a large
luminosity, for example, from a burning shell in the interiors of stars during advanced phases
of evolution, or because of large opacity, typically in the cool outer envelopes of stars, for exam-
ple, during the red and asymptotic giant branch phase. Convective velocities are of the order
of several km/s and lead to advective mixing that is fast compared to the evolutionary time
scale of the star. Convection will also trigger mixing at or near convective boundaries, through
overshooting, entrainment, or the excitation of internal waves in the stable layers neighbor-
ing the convection zones. These convection-induced mixing processes are already slower than

Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars 8

proper convective mixing. The three-dimensional and turbulent nature of convection can only
be captured eventually by highly resolved numerical solutions of (>8.1), while stellar evolution
( > 8.2) needs to be supplemented with an approximate model of convection that is based on
the available radially and temporal averaged, local values for the state variables. The simplis-
tic model that is still used most often is the mixing-length theory (Böhm-Vitense 1958), and
it has been pointed out that “one does not therefore expect quantitative results derived on the
basis of this theory to have high accuracy or reliability” (Cox and Giuli 1968). Work to improve
this situation is much needed and underway (e.g., Xiong et al. 1997; Canuto et al. 1996; Arnett
et al. 2010) and supplemented by increasingly more realistic 3D simulations of convection (e.g.,
Porter and Woodward 2000; Browning et al. 2004; Freytag and Höfner 2008; Brun and Palacios
2009).
Even slower than that are mixing processes related to both thermal and abundance diffusiv-
ity or secular processes. These include thermohaline mixing and semi-convection where in the
first case a thermally stable stratification is becoming unstable due to a destabilizing gradient of
the mean molecular weight, or the other way around in the lattercase. Despite renewed research
effort (e.g., Charbonnel and Zahn 2007; Denissenkov 2010; Denissenkov and Merryfield 2011;
Canuto 2011), these double-diffusive instabilities and the associated amount of mixing in stars
are quantitatively not well understood,which represents another source of uncertainty in stellar
evolution simulations. Rotation will induce mixing, for example, through meridional circu-
lations or shear-driven flows (Endal and Sofia 1976; Pinsonneault 1997; Langer et al. 1999;
Maeder and Meynet 2012). These slow mixing processes maybe associatedwith velocities of the
order of cm/s. Significant uncertainties exist in the quantitative treatment of mixing processes.
The physics ingredients of stellar evolution calculations briefly reviewed so far need to be
complemented with a numerical solution scheme. Since the early days of stellar evolution, the
solution scheme of choice has been a fully implicit Newton–Raphson scheme (Henyey et al.
1964), which is also adopted by the MESA code (Paxton et al. 2011). The three operators struc-
ture (> 8.2), mixing (> 8.6), and nuclear burn (> 8.4) may or may not be coupled in different
combinations. Formally, the operators can be solved separately if the associated time scales are
largely different. For solar and intermediate-mass stars, this is most of the times the case. Nev-
ertheless, it is found that the fully coupled solution, that is adopted, for example, in the MESA
code, seems to provide greater numerical efficiency and robustness. There are many additional
numerical details, for example, concerning adaptive mesh refinement and boundary conditions
that need to be addressed.At the end, a modern stellar evolution code can follow the entire evo-
lution from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf stars in a day or two on a present-day
multi-core workstation. However, the difficulties of simulating the very advanced last thermal
pulses on the AGB, as mentioned already above, remain (cf. >Sect. 3.2).

The Evolution of a 3M⊙Star
This section will describe the evolution of a M⊙star according to the results of stellar evolution
computations. This mass is representative of the lower-mass regime of CO-white dwarf progen-
itors which will experience the third dredge-up during the thermal-pulse AGB (>Sect. 3.2.1)
and become C-rich and produce s-process elements. However, this mass avoids the complica-
tion of the He-core flash of lower initial mass,and it also avoids the effect of hot-bottom burning
and C-ignition that is characteristic for more massive AGB stars. These additional evolutionary

406 8
Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
options as a function of initial mass will be discussed in >Sect. 4. Also, the evolution described
in this section is for metallicity Z = ., which is similar or maybe slightly higher compared to
the sun’s metallicity (Asplund et al. 2009). The evolution of stars with lower metal content has
some peculiarities that will be presented in >Sect. 5.
The evolution in the HRD is shown in >Fig. 8-1. The M⊙star evolves from the pre-main
sequence toward the zero-age main sequence at log Teff = .and log L = .. Here it has
its smallest radius and highest surface gravity, and the overall evolutionary trend for the star
from hereon all the way to the tip of the AGB is to become cooler, more luminous, and, because
L = πRσT
eff (with σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant), also larger, as is shown in >Fig. 8-2.
Stellar evolution can be thought of as a continuous process of gravitationally induced col-
lapse, temporarily halted by the ignition of and energy release from nuclear burning processes.
The evolution of the central ρc −Tc is shown in > Fig. 8-3. In solar and intermediate-mass
star evolution, advanced burning stages will be ignited off-center, due to the effect of neutrino
cooling in the highest-density central locations. Nevertheless,the evolution of some key species
involved in nuclear processes for energy generation in the center of the star is very instructive
and demonstrates the temperature dependence of the different burning processes. Such a dia-
gram is shown in >Fig. 8-4 for the highest mass case discussed in this chapter, M⊙(because
only the highest mass eventually ignites C in the center). However, the ignition temperatures
for the various nuclear burning processes are only weakly dependent on the density, and the
corresponding M⊙diagram would look similar.

Furthermore, the so-called Kippenhahn diagram shows the time evolution of the mass coor-
dinate of convection zones as well as in this case the mass coordinate of the H-free core and the
He-free core (and for the highest mass cases also the C-free core). All three mass coordinates
are defined in this chapter as the smallest mass coordinate where the mass fraction of the respec-
tive species is X < −. These lines correspond either to the location of the nuclear burning
shell or, in the case of a dredge-up process, to the location of the bottom of the convection zone
that causes the dredge-up. A Kippenhahn diagram for the M⊙case is shown in >Fig. 8-7.
3.1 Pre-main Sequence to the End of He-Core Burning
Stars form on the pre-main sequence in the cool and luminous part of the HRD. Because they
are cool, the opacity is high and they are throughout convectively unstable. For that reason,
they are well described by a polytrope with the index n = /of an adiabat. During this phase
without significant nuclear energy sources, the star contracts on the short Kelvin–Helmholtz
time scale (>Sect. 2). This short-lived convection therefore only shows up as a vertical line at
log(tfinal −t) = .in >Fig. 8-7.

Evolution of the central mass fractions of key isotopes that trace the main nucleosynthesis

The major nuclear burning stages evident in the abundance variations cause prominent features
in the ρc −Tc diagram >Fig. 8-3. This super-asymptotic giant branch star is right at the border to
the massivestar regime, and hence, C-ignition causes the 12Cabundanceto decreaseat thehighest
temperature (see >Sect. 4)
>Figure 8-4 shows that core H-burning takes place at log T = .in the M⊙stellar model.
For the M⊙star H burns already at log T = .and log ρ = .. The ignition of H in the
center causes a characteristic feature in the ρc −Tc-diagram (>Fig. 8-3). The central evolution
toward higher ρ and T is halted during the major core burning phases. The ρc −Tc profile
(>Fig. 8-6) which also features markers for masscoordinates shows that the innermost .M⊙
are relatively compact and have only small dynamic range in density and temperature.
In these higher-mass stars, H-burning proceeds via the CNO cycle that depends on the
availability of C, N, and O isotopes as a catalyst. The basic cycle involves p-captures on C,
C, N, and the N(p, α)C reaction that closes the cycle. The relative abundances of the
CNO isotopes are reshuffled during CNO cycling so that N, which has the largest Coulomb
barrier and therefore the smallest p-capture cross section, has the highest abundance in CNO-
cycle H-burning ashes (Arnould et al. 1999). This can be seen on the left of the top panel
in >Fig. 8-5 that shows the central region of the 3 M⊙during the main sequence. The initial
(solar-scaled) abundance distribution can be seen on the right side of that panel, which shows
the unprocessed and at this point also still unmixed surface composition. There, O dominates
the CNO isotopes. The workings of the CNO cycle can also be seen in >Fig. 8-13, which shows a
H-burning situation in a later phase of the evolution. However, the CNO cycle is the same,
and the profiles show the signatures of the various reactions, being activated from lower to

higher temperaturesfrom the right (outer layers) to the left (layers further inward). The effect of
H-burning via the CNO cycle is to turn most O and C into N. This will be important, as
shown in later sections, for the s process.
Nuclear reaction rates have a high temperature dependence, which means that nuclear
burning is confined only to the most central region where the temperature peaks. Despite
that, the abundance profiles are flat in the central region of the main-sequence star (top panel
in >Fig. 8-5), because that core region is convectively unstable and therefore well mixed. As
shown in the Kippenhahn diagram (>Fig. 8-7, log(tfinal −t) = .–.), the convection zone
is decreasing in mass extent. This explains the shallow slope of the abundance profile of species
like H, He, and O (> Fig. 8-5) between mr = .and .M⊙. The slope is preserving the
central abundances as a function of time according to the decreasing convective core.

410 8
Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
While nuclear energy generation during the main sequence is restricted to the central
region, more nucleosynthesis with consequences that are eventually observable is taking place
in layers further out in the star. These layers are convectively stable (radiative), and in the stellar
evolution models no mixing takes place. Therefore, even slow, nonequilibrium nucleosynthesis
can build up abundance features. In particular, around mr ∼.M⊙, a layer with enhanced C
results from the activation of the first reactions in the CN cycle: C(p, γ)N(+β)C(p, γ)N.
During the subsequent red giant branch (RGB) or first giant branch phase, when a deep
convective envelope emerges, this C-bump will be mixed throughout the envelope (middle
panel, > Fig. 8-5) and to the surface where it leads to an observed decrease of the C/C
abundance. This first convective mixing of nuclear processed material to the surface due to
a deepening envelope convection zone is called the first dredge-up. The second (> Figs. 8-23
and >8-24) and third (> Figs. 8-9 and >8-10) dredge-up are encountered after the end of
He-core burning and after the end of He-shell flashes, respectively.
When H in the center is exhausted, the main-sequence phase ends, which in the HRD is
the case at log Teff = .and log L = .. A characteristic switchback feature marks the
terminal age main sequence and the transition from core H-burning to H-shell burning. The
location of the H-shell is now tracked by the line for the H-free core in the Kippenhahn diagram
(>Fig. 8-7). The core, not supported anymore by nuclear burning, contracts; H-burning starts
in the shell, and the outer layers expand. The model star evolves at almost constant luminosity
from the tip of the main sequence to the bottom of the RGB at log Teff = .(adopted here to
be at the local minimum of L at log L = .), and this readjustment on the thermal time scale
lasts .× yr. At this stage, the H-burning shell is located at mr = .M⊙. Because of
the decreasing temperature in the envelope, the opacity increases and the outer layers become
unstable against convection ( > 8.3). At the bottom of the RGB, the bottom of the convective
envelope has reached mr = .M⊙(>Fig. 8-7, at log(tfinal −t) ∼.).
The star now evolves on the RGB, with an inert He core, a H-burning shell, and further out
a large convective envelope. The structure has dramatically changed compared to the main-
sequence configuration, as can be seen by comparing the ρc −Tc profiles (> Fig. 8-6). The
dynamic range between the three marked mass coordinates has significantly increased. The
profiles shown in > Figs. 8-5 and >8-6 are taken when the stellar evolution track has almost
reached log L = .which is very close to the tip of the RGB at log L = .for the M⊙
track. He-core burning is about to start, and in fact, a tiny uptick of the C abundance can
already be noticed in the center (middle panel, >Fig. 8-5). C is already gone because of the
C(α, n)O reaction.
While the .M⊙mark is in the He core just below the H-burning shell at .M⊙, the
.M⊙mark is located just below the bottom of the convective envelope, while the .M⊙
mark is well inside the convective envelope. The location of these markers on the ρc−Tc profiles
demonstrates the large density and temperature contrast between the core and the envelope in
giant stars. This contrast is even more extreme in the AGB stars.
The H-burning shell is relatively shallow, compared to lower-mass RGB stars, with a gently
sloping H-profile between the H-burning shell and the bottom of the convective envelope. The
latter is characterized by steep abundance gradients and flat profiles above. In the layer beneath
the convective envelope, Ne is destroyed by H-burning via the Ne-Na cycle.
The evolution from the bottom to the tip of the RGB (i.e., from the minimum to the
maximum in L) takes .× yr. The RGB profile shown in > Figs. 8-5 and > 8-6 is at
.× yr before the RGB tip, when the He core has reached a mass of .M⊙and He
ignites in the core. In the M⊙star, this happens at log T ∼.(>Fig. 8-4) while in the M⊙
case, He-core burning starts at log T ∼.. The core becomes convectively unstable because of

The ignition of He produces again a characteristic feature in the ρc −Tc evolution, similar
to when H ignited. Compared to the RGB, the density has decreased in the center, and the tem-
perature has increased. The star is again more in a dwarflike configuration with a much smaller
range in temperature and density from the center to the surface, compared to the giant con-
figuration. The Kippenhahn diagram shows that the convective envelope has receded and the
bottom of the convection zone reaches a maximummass coordinate of .M⊙. The abundance
profile (bottom panel, >Fig. 8-5) shows how C is forming from the triple-α reaction. Several
other He-burning reactions are now activated in the core, including C(α, γ)O as well as the
α-capture chain N(α, γ)F(+β)O(α, γ)Ne. In massive stars, this reaction chain trans-
forms N from the CNO cycle into the neutron source Ne (Ne(α, n)Mg), and in
those stars, this Ne plays an important role for the weak s process. However, in solar and
intermediate-mass stars, this core material will be eventually buried in the white dwarf. The
relevant nuclear production site for the s process is during the AGB stage.
During the He-core burning phase, H burning continues in the shell. The H-free core
reaches .M⊙at the end of He-core burning, and throughout this phase, the luminosity from
H burning exceeds the He-burning luminosity for this initial mass. Contrary to the core con-
vection zone during H-core burning, the convective core during He-core burning grows. In
this particular situation, the radiative and adiabatic gradients outside the proper core convec-
tion region have about the same value within a mass shell of mass ≤.M⊙due to opposing
trends impacting the radiative gradient with an outward decreasing luminosity and increasing

cussed in >Sect. 2 play a role. This introduces an uncertainty for post-He-core burning core
masses.When the He in the center is completely transformed into C and O, He-core burning
is finished.
3.2 Asymptotic Giant Branch Evolution
The events after the end of He-core burning are very similar to those at the end of the main-
sequence evolution. The core resumes contraction while He-burning now switches to a shell.
As a response to the contracting core, the envelope expands again, and the envelope convection
deepens again. This and the subsequent evolution along the early AGB up to the thermal pulses
are shown in >Fig. 8-8. In stars below MZAMS <∼.M⊙, the bottom of the convective envelope
will not penetrate into the H-free core (when this does happen, it is referred to as the second
dredge-up, > Figs. 8-23, and >8-24).
In the ρc −Tc diagram, both the evolution of the central conditions (>Fig. 8-3) as well as
the profile for the early AGB and even more so the tip AGB star (> Fig. 8-6) take a turn into

AGB to the end of the thermal-pulse AGB. The wiggles at the bottom of the convective envelope at

the envelope is lost through winds at an instant (cf. >Fig. 8-7)
the regime dominated by the electron degenerate equation of state. The temperature decreases
toward the center and in the center as function of time. Neutrino losses extract so much
energy from the central region so that C burning, which would be the next nuclear burning
process, cannot ignite. What will become eventually the white dwarf, an inert CO core sup-
ported through the pressure from degenerate electrons, starts to form after the end of He-core
burning.
Contrary to the He-core burning phase, the He-burning luminosity from the He shell now
by far exceeds the H-shell luminosity during the early AGB. In fact, the main thing that happens
during this transition phase is the catching up (in mass coordinate) of the He-shell with the
H-shell. Once the two shells are close to each other in mass, they start to interfere with each
other, which leads to the He-shell flash or thermal-pulse phenomenon. As can be seen from
the ρ −T profiles (>Fig. 8-6), the model star has turned again into a giant configuration, and
the envelope continues to expand as the core contracts. The phenomenon, that in stars with
nuclear shells the envelope does the opposite of what the core does, is also known as the mirror
principle (Kippenhahn and Weigert 1990). For the early AGB star, the .M⊙mass coordinate
is already at such low density and temperature that it falls out of the range of the diagram.
More quantitative details on the early AGB evolution can be found in Forestini and Charbonnel
(1997).

3.2.1 Thermal-Pulse AGB
Once the mass coordinate of the He-free core has approached the location of the H-free core to
within ∼.M⊙, the conditions for He-shell flashes are given. The He-burning shell is feeding
on the ashes of the H-burning shell. For both to be burning stable in a steady-state manner, the
He shell would have to process the same amount of mass that the H shell is producing as ashes.
For this to happen, the conditions would have to be fine-tuned in an unlikely way, and stellar
evolution simulations have not found any cases with simultaneously stable H and He burning.
He-Shell Instability
Instead, once the He shell has approached the H-burning shell in mass coordinate toward the
end of the early AGB, H burning will take over the lead in energy production. The H-burning
shell will support a lot of the pressure from the overlying envelope mass, and the temperature in
the layer below does not allow full-blown He burning. He continues to be accreted from the H
shell above and is accumulating. The region of the He shell is contracting and compressed due to
the lack of energy production. The He shell is getting geometrically thinner, considering that the
shell region is defined as the region between the absence of fuel at the bottom and the absence
of high enough temperature at the top. Depending on the mass, this region will also become
increasingly degenerate. In the M⊙evolution track, the thin-shell instability will eventually
trigger the He-shell flash. The basic idea is that with very little volume in the shell, at the onset
of He-burning via the triple-α reaction with a very-high-temperature exponent, an increase
of the energy generation cannot immediately lead to an expansion via PdV work. Locally and
temporarily, the pressure is effectively decoupled from the temperature, which results in a ther-
monuclear runaway. A complete and more rigorous analysis taking also into the account the
effect of degeneracy is given by Yoon et al. (2004).
The He-shell flash instability plays a central role in the final evolution of solar and
intermediate-mass stars. They cause periodic convective mixing of the intershell, which is
the region between the He and H shell. And they cause the third dredge-up mixing that
brings the bottom of the convective envelope down into the intershell and, like the previous
dredge-up episodes, mixes processed material from the intershell to the surface. The thermal
pulses (the terms thermal pulse and He-shell flash are used synonymously) also trigger mix-
ing episodes that are critical for the activation of the neutron source reactions C(α, n)O
and Ne(α, n)Mg. These processes will now be described in some detail, while an in-depth
coverage of thermal-pulse AGB evolution has been given by Herwig (2005).
He-shell flashes are recurrent. >Figure 8-9 shows the complete series of flashes for the M⊙
evolution track, while >Fig. 8-10 provides details of the 12th thermal and the subsequent inter-
pulse and 13th thermal pulse. The interpulse time, the time between thermal pulses, depends
on the core mass (Forestini and Charbonnel 1997). For the advanced thermal pulses shown
in >Fig. 8-10, our simulation has an interpulse time of tip ∼×yr. Models with higher core
mass have shorter interpulse time.
Other global quantities of the AGB thermal-pulse evolution are also strongly correlated
with the core mass, such as the luminosity (Paczy´nski 1970; Herwig et al. 1998; Marigo 2000)
or the third dredge-up (Karakas et al. 2002). For example, Blöcker (1993, cited from Herwig
et al. 1998) gives the following core-mass luminosity relationship:

This so-called asymptotic behavior has motivated the construction of synthetic AGB mod-
els. These do not solve the full set of stellar evolution equations ( > 8.2) but describe the
properties of full stellar models through fitting formula of key quantities, such as the tempera-
ture in nuclear processing regions (e.g., Renzini and Voli 1981; Groenewegen and de Jong 1993;
Marigo 2001).
Mass Loss
The total number of thermal pulses in an AGB sequence will be determined by the assumed
mass loss. Mass loss will depend on the stellar mass, the temperature,the luminosity, the surface
chemistry, and the envelope pulsations. It is the result of a complex interplay between mechan-
ical driving of the circumstellar envelope through stellar pulsations, the formation of molecules
and dust in the hydrodynamic environment of the stellar surface as well as the interaction of
radiation with all involved constituents, and the transfer of moment between dust and gas (Will-
son 2000). Recent self-consistent modeling efforts are quite promising (e.g., Wachter et al. 2002;
Mattsson et al. 2010). Observational determination of mass loss rates is indirect and therefore
difficult (Jura and Kleinmann 1989, 1992; Groenewegen and de Jong 1998; van Loon et al. 1999;
Olofsson et al. 2002). AGB stars will start the thermal-pulse phase with an O-rich surface com-
position (M star) left over from the initial composition. During the advanced thermal pulses,
due to the dredge-up of primary C from the He-shell, lower mass AGB stars, like the M⊙case,
star will eventually become C-rich (see below and >Fig. 8-12). The lower-mass M stars have
to be distinguished from the much more luminous massive AGB stars that are O-rich because
of hot-bottom burning ( >Sect. 4). Larger and more homogeneous observational samples are
now obtained, and the emerging picture (Olofsson 2003; van Loon 2005; De Beck et al. 2010),
in very broad terms, is that the low-luminosity O-rich stars (and S stars which have a C/O ratio
around unity) have mass loss rates in the range −.< log ˙M/ M⊙<∼−, whereas the mass loss
rate of C-stars are systematically higher, −.<∼log ˙M/ M⊙<∼−.. The massive O-rich AGB
stars have on average even higher mass loss in the range −.<∼log ˙M/ M⊙<∼−..
For the M⊙stellar model, it is therefore expected that only a small fraction of the mass will
be lost in the O-rich phase, while the C/O ratio gradually increases with each third dredge-up
event (> Fig. 8-12) until the higher mass loss rate for C-rich stars kicks in. With an assumed
average mass loss rate of log ˙M/ M⊙∼−.out of the range for C-rich stars, the envelope
mass of Menv ∼.M⊙of the MZAMS = M⊙models star will be lost in ∼× yr. With the
interpulse time tip from >Fig. 8-10, one can expect of the order of one dozen thermal pulses in
the C-rich phase before all the envelope mass is lost, and the star will evolve off the AGB. In fact,
the 12th thermal pulse shown in >Fig. 8-10 corresponds to the thermal pulse after which the
envelope composition becomes C-rich, and therefore, a M⊙star will have of the order 20–25
thermal pulses. The situation would be very similar for a M⊙case.
Although observational and theoretical investigations of mass loss of AGB stars are mak-
ing swift progress, the differences in adopted mass loss rates in stellar evolution simulations of
different groups are still one of the major sources of uncertainty. Mass loss rate prescriptions
used in stellar evolution simulations, if they are not entirely based on simulation based data,
should take advantage of the well-established correlation of mass loss and pulsation period, as
pointed out by Vassiliadis and Wood (1993). These authors, and approximately at the same
time Blöcker (1995a), presented a large set of detailed AGB thermal-pulse stellar evolution
calculations, followed all the way from the main sequence, through a large number of ther-
mal pulses, and including mass loss. Such stellar evolution grid sets have been frequently
updated now, with improved microphysics and more elaborate treatment of nucleosynthesis

(e.g., Forestini and Charbonnel 1997; Weiss and Ferguson 2009; Karakas 2010) and a lot of
work that has specifically focused on lower metallicity, see >Sect. 5.
In one of the previous paragraphs, the primary production of C was mentioned. In this con-
text, a species is produced in a primary mode if it can be made only out of H and He (most of
which in the solar abundance mix is still from the Big Bang) or, in other words, if the produc-
tion does not directly depend on the presence of metals (anything not H or He) from a previous
generation of stars. s-process elements depend on the presence of Fe from previous star gener-
ations as a seed and are therefore a secondary production, even if the neutron source may be
primary (see below).
He-Shell Flash Mixing and Third Dredge-Up
He-shell flashes follow a sequence of events that is demonstrated in
> Fig. 8-10 where
the evolution of convection zones is shown, and
> Fig. 8-11 shows the evolution of the
H- and He-burning luminosity and the surface parameters. The He-shell flash starts during
the preceding quiescent intershell phase when the stellar luminosity is almost entirely provided
by the H shell. He is accreted onto the CO core, and eventually, the He-burning luminosity starts
to increase. This leads via the instabilities described above into a thermonuclear runaway, and
the He-burning luminosity rapidly increases to –L⊙(>Fig. 8-11). Due to this high local
luminosity, the region just above the shell becomes convectively unstable ( > 8.3). The mass
extent of the He-shell flash convection zone grows both inward and outward until the entire
intershell region is convectively unstable and therefore well mixed (left panel, >Fig. 8-10). Most
of the energy will go into expansion work of the intershell layers and immediately above. The
layerin which the H-shell is located will be lifted and cools, and the temperature decreases below
the limit for H-burning. The H-burning luminosity drops to insignificant values (>Fig. 8-11).
Not only the H-shell will extinguish as a result of the lifting and cooling of those outer layers
but also the opacity will increase. Then, again, the radiative gradient will increase making the

layer convectively unstable, and the mass coordinate of the bottom of the convective envelope
will decrease (at ∼−.M⊙and time mark ∼1,200 yr). This is the third dredge-up.
Both the formation and evolution of the He-shell flash convection and the dredge-up
episode afterward proceed on the local thermal time scale of 150–200 yr, which will depend
on the core mass. As seen from >Fig. 8-10, the envelope convection overlaps in mass with the
former location of the He-shell flash convection, between the largest extent of the top of the
He-shell flash convection zone at .M⊙(time marker yr) and the deepest penetration
of the bottom of the envelope convection zone at .M⊙(time marker 1,300 yr). The mass
difference ΔM = .×−M⊙is the amount of processed material from the convectively mixed
intershell that will be brought into the envelope. Therefore, a significant dilution factor of the
order ΔM/Menv will have to be taken into account when deriving observable enhancement fac-
tors from admixture of enriched materials from the intershell due to the third dredge-up (for
an example of such a mixing model, see Herwig et al. 2003). The effect of the third dredge-
up can be seen in all of the Kippenhahn diagrams of this section, whenever the (red solid)
line showing the location of the H-free core goes down. The sawtooth shape of that line in
> Fig. 8-9 is therefore reflecting the growth of the H-free core due to H-shell burn-
ing during an interpulse phase, followed by a decrease of the H-free core during a third
dredge-up event. The ratio of the amount of decrease (dredge-up mass) and increase
(core growth mass) is called the dredge-up parameter λ. Whenever it is ∼1, the core effectively
does not grow anymore.
The third dredge-up will bring to the envelope all materials that are found in the He-shell
flash convection zone. These are first of all primary C from the triple-α He burning, possibly
some O depending on the mixing assumptions at the bottom of the He-shell flash convection
zone (Herwig 2000), as well as any s-process elements. The nucleosynthesis and formation of
the later will be described in >Sect. 3.2. Whether or not, and if so at which core mass, the third
dredge-up would occur was debated, since early models (e.g., Iben 1981; Vassiliadis and Wood
1993; Blöcker 1995a) did not obtain this dredge-up mixing in simulations. However, it became
clear that in order to reproduce this obviously very important feature of thermal-pulse AGB
calculations, some kind of nonstandard convective boundary mixing across the Schwarzschild
condition (which sets the convective boundary where the adiabatic and radiative gradient are
equal) was needed (Lattanzio 1986; Hollowell and Iben 1988; Lattanzio 1989; Frost and Lat-
tanzio 1996; Herwig et al. 1997; Mowlavi 1999; Herwig 2000). This issue is now settled, and all
contemporary simulations obtain amounts of third dredge-up that are broadly consistent with
observational constraints.
Such constraints come from a combination of observations. In particular, the synthetic
models by Marigo et al. (1996, and subsequent work) that initially incorporated the third
dredge-up as a free parameter have been tremendously useful to establish when and how effi-
ciently the third dredge-up has to operate. Constraints include the luminosity function of C
stars (Marigo et al. 1999), the star counts of O- and C-rich stars in clusters or extragalactic
populations, the observed abundance of AGB stars (e.g., Fig. 6 in Herwig 2005), planetary neb-
ulae and post-AGB stars, as well as additional constraints from nucleosynthesis discussed in
>Sect. 3.2.
The efficiency of the third dredge-up will also depend on nuclear physics input. For example,
the downward revision of the N(p, γ)O rate leads to weaker H-shell burning, larger peak
He-shell flash luminosities, and more efficient third dredge-up (Herwig and Austin 2004;
Herwig et al. 2006a).

Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars 8
419
Nonstandard mixing during and at the end of the third dredge-up is also required for the
formation of a layer enriched in C which serves as the neutron source for the s process, to be
further discussed in >Sect. 3.2. It has been proposed that convective boundary mixing needs
to be taken into account as well at other convective boundaries, as, for example, at the bottom
of the He-shell flash convection zone (Herwig et al. 1997; Herwig 2000; Miller Bertolami et al.
2006; Weiss and Ferguson 2009). Such mixing would have wide ranging implications for the
thermal-pulse strength, the dredge-up efficiency, the s process in the He-shell flash convection
zone, and the subsequent radiative C-driven s process. Such mixing leads to larger C and
O abundances in the intershell, in agreement with observations of H-deficient post-AGB stars
(Werner and Herwig 2006). If correct, this would imply that AGB stars would dredge-up pri-
mary O and, possibly limited to lower metallicity environments, may be a contributor of O
to the galactic chemical evolution. This type of mixing may also imply larger peak temperatures
for the Ne-fuelled s-process contribution. Lugaro et al. (2003) have argued that this may lead
to isotopic ratio predictions, for example, for Zr, that could be incompatible with observations
from presolar grains. This question needs to be revisited, considering possible modifications to
the details of the mixing algorithm as well as the latest nuclear reaction rate data, in particu-
lar for the Ne(α, n)Mg neutron source reaction. Eventually, highly resolved hydrodynamic
simulations of the He-shell flash convection may settle this question (for early attempts, see
Herwig et al. 2006b, 2007).
Returning to >Fig. 8-11, eventually the thermonuclear runawaywill be quenched, and after
the peak luminosity has passed, the He shell will settle for a while into a stable burning mode.
The star is for a couple 1,000 yr a He-burner, and He burning takes place radiatively. While
during the thermal pulse He burning is dominated by the triple-α process, the C(α, γ)O
reaction dominates the radiative He burning (cf. mr ∼.M⊙in >Fig. 8-14 where the O
abundance exceeds the C abundance). After the He-shell flash, the layers above the H shell,
the intershellregion, and the region of the H-free core contract again, and the temperaturerises.
As much as H-shell burning is rejuvenated, the He burning burning decreases. Finally, about
8,000–10,000 yr into the new interpulse period the AGB star is back in the H-shell-supported
single-shell burning mode, and the cycle starts over again.
Remarkably, despite the enormous peak He-shell flash luminosity released into the stel-
lar interior during a thermal pulse, the effect on the surface parameters is not too dramatic
(>Fig. 8-11). Newer models with third dredge-up show the radius peak triggered by the ther-
mal pulse. This may be relevant for binary evolution considerations. A radius peak may trigger
a common envelope evolution to occur preferentially at thermal-pulse cycle phase zero, that is,
immediately following the thermal pulse.
Molecules, Dust, and Grains
One of the most important results of the third dredge-up is the enrichment of the envelope
and surface with the nuclear products of nuclear shell burning. The evolution of the C/O ratio
(> Fig. 8-12) is important for the chemistry of molecular opacities at the surface, which in
turn effects the temperature and the mass loss conditions discussed above. The chemistry at the
surface will alsodetermine the type ofdust that can form. Molecular and dust chemistryare fun-
damentally different in C- and O-rich environments. The reason is the high dissociation energy
(11.1 eV) of carbon monoxide. Thus, coming out of the star, the gas will first form CO until all
of either O (in a C-rich environment) or C (if C/O < ) is consumed (Gustafsson and Höfner
2003). On the surface of C-stars, only molecules without O can form, for example, CN, which

Evolution of the C/O ratio (by number) asa function of stellar mass. Since the stellar mass decreases
with time the C/O evolution corresponds to a time, sequence from left to right
has been identified as a particularly important source of opacity (see above and >Sect. 2). This
dichotomy in chemistry between first the O-rich and later the C-rich thermal-pulse evolution
is responsible for the difference in mass loss efficiency discussed above.
The evolution of the C/O ratio by number is shown in >Fig. 8-12. The M⊙case shows that
the C/O ratio is increasing initially almost at constant stellar mass, reflecting the fact that during
the O-rich phase of the evolution, the mass loss is smaller than in the following C-rich phase.
According to the assumptions made for this calculation, the mass starts to decrease significantly
only after a certain C excess has been reached. Still, further thermal pulses trigger dredge-up
events that further increases the C/O ratio. However, since not too many thermal pulses can
occur once the star is C-rich (because of the higher mass loss, see discussion above), there is
naturally a limit on the maximum C/O ratio that can be obtained. (This limit also comes from
the C/O ratio in the He-shell flash convection, which in turn depends on the boundary mixing
assumptions at the bottom of the He-shell flash convection zone; see discussion in previous
section on He-shell flash mixing.)
The transformation into a C-rich, high-mass loss star has another intriguing consequence,
the formation of C-rich dust grains, the SiC grains. These are among the most abundant presolar
grains that are extracted from meteorites (Zinner 1998). Presolar grains have formed in the cool
and dense outflows of individual stars. They survived the condition in the interstellar medium
until they were included unhomogenized into meteoritic material as part of the solar system
formation. These grains are analyzed with great precision in the laboratory. They carry the sig-
nature of the particular nucleosynthetic processes inside individual AGB stars (or other sources,

depending on where they formed). This still young field is covered in the monograph Star-
dust from meteorites. An introduction to presolar grains by Lugaro (2005). It provides fascinating
constraints on the nucleosynthesis processes in AGB stars, which will be covered next.
3.2.2 Nucleosynthesis
The events through the He-shell flash are described here once more, starting again with the
quiescent H-shell burning before the 12th thermal pulse (>Fig. 8-10), however, now focusing
on the nucleosynthesis. As the H shell burns through unprocessed material, it leaves behind
its burning products (> Fig. 8-13). These are of course He, to be accreted by the He shell, but
also, like during H-core and H-shell burning during the pre-AGB phase, most of the C and O
isotopes will be transformed into N (see discussion in >Sect. 3.1). While before only the C
and O from the initial composition could be transformed to N, now also the primary C (and
possibly O, see discussion in section He-flash mixing) from previous He-shell flashes, that was
mixed into the envelope due to the third dredge-up, can be turned into N. As discussed below,
this is important for the s process.
The profiles over a larger mass range are shown in >Fig. 8-14. The left side of the figure

at the right edge of the diagram, from top to bottom
of the H-shell burning during the present interpulse phase, and above the abundance profile of
the bottom layers of the convective envelope can be seen. The variation of the C/O ratio has
already been pointed out, and it is a signature of the T dependence of the ratio of the triple-α
to C(α, γ)O rate.
Neutron Sources for the s Process
Another important feature of this diagram (> Fig. 8-14) is the significant enhancement of
the Ne and Mg abundance in the intershell region. Because the thermal pulses discussed
here have a dredge-up parameter λ ∼(see above), the abundance profiles after the follow-
ing thermal pulse would look almost identical. The high Ne and Mg abundance are the
result of the nucleosynthesis in the He-shell flash convection zone. The large amount of pri-
mary N in the H-burning ashes is completely mixed into the next He-shell flash convection
zone (cf. >Fig. 8-10) where it is burned into Ne by the same chain of two α capture already
discussed in >Sect. 3.1. In stars as massive as this M⊙case, the peak temperature at the bottom
of the He-shell flash convection zone is high enough to activate the reaction Ne(α, n)Mg.
This reaction is one of the two main neutron source reactions, and it leads to s-process nucle-
osynthesis in the He-shell flash convection zone that will be discussed below. The Mg is only
a tracer of that reaction, and the elevated abundance in the intershell indicates that neutrons
have been released here during previous cycles.

But there is another and even more important neutron source in the thermal-pulse AGB
stars, as discovered by Straniero et al. (1995). This neutron source is the C(α, n)O reaction.
However, in standard stellar evolution models, there is no appreciable source of C, unlike
the situation for Ne which, as already mentioned, forms quite naturally even in a primary
manner out of the N from the ashes of the H shell that burns through third dredge-up C and
O enriched envelope material. Therefore, it is assumed that additional mixing processes, beyond
what the mixing-length theory and the Schwarzschild condition account for, must be at work.
If the location of these additional mixing processes is the bottom boundary of the convective
envelope during the third dredge-up (time marker 1,300 yr, mr = .M⊙, >Fig. 8-10, left
panel), and if it mixes a sufficient amount of H from the envelope into the C-rich intershell,
then everything else will fall in place. The necessity to have some mixing at that convective
boundary was already mentioned in the context of obtaining the third dredge-up (see above),
and here such mixing is also needed.
The 13C Pocket
The models discussed here include a simple model forconvective boundarymixing that was first
introduced in stellar evolution models by Herwig et al. (1997). After the diffusion coefficient D
is calculated inside the convectively unstable zone from the mixing-length theory, the diffusion
coefficient for mixing is extended into the formally stable layer by an exponentially decreasing
function of the distance from the formal convective boundary:
DOV = Dexp(−∣r −r∣
f HP
)
(8.8)
where HP is the pressure scale height and Dis the mixing-length diffusion coefficient, both
taken at the radius rclose to the boundary. In this model, f is a free parameter that has to
be calibrated for each type of convective boundary either semiempirically through observa-
tions or through hydrodynamic simulations. Lugaro et al. (2003) have used this framework with
f = .to generate a mixing zone that is of the required order of magnitude size to reproduce
observed overabundance levels of s-process enriched AGB stars (see also Herwig et al. 2003). A
more in-depth discussion of the partial-mixing zone has been given by Straniero et al. (2009)
with applications in Cristallo et al. (2011).
The formation of the partial-mixing zone during the dredge-up due to the mixing model
( > 8.8), and the subsequent nucleosynthesis in the C-pocket is illustrated in > Fig. 8-15.
The top-left panel shows the formation of the partially mixed layer across the bottom bound-
ary of the envelope convection zone shortly after that boundary has reached the smallest mass
coordinate at the end of the third dredge-up phase. The mixing model forces protons below
the Schwarzschild boundary, and as a result, the abundances are transitioning smoothly at the
envelope–core interface over a mass region with width ΔMPM ∼−× −M⊙(which is
probably a bit smaller than what is required to reproduce observed s-process overabundances
quantitatively). The width of this partial-mixing layer, of course, is the direct consequence of
the choice of f in > 8.8.
Once contraction resumesafterthe He-shell flash (see discussion above), the temperaturein
the partial-mixing zone gradually increases (Fig. 6, Herwig et al. 1999) and H burning resumes
by creating a pocket of C and N (upper-right panel, note the tail of the H profile at the very
right end of the plot). Then, for a long time, nothing happens, until the temperature reaches
T ∼K to activate the C(α, n)O reaction. Peak neutron densities around Nn ∼cm−

bottom boundary of the He-shell flash convection zone (Herwig et al. 1999; Lugaro et al. 2003;
Herwig 2005). The neutrons are captured by Fe and trans-iron elements form.
The s-processabundance distribution is characterized bythree distinct peaks corresponding
to the low n-capture cross sections at the neutron magic-number closed shells at n = , ,
and . In the lower-left panel, Sr, representing the first s-process peak, increases first as the
nuclear production through continued neutron captures on seed nuclei arrives at the N = 
barrier. The second peak elements, represented by Ba are at this point enhanced much less,
and the third peak species, represented by Pb are only starting to be produced. The s-process
seed, Fe is significantly depleted in the C pocket.
The final panel (bottom right) shows the situation immediately before the nuclear products
will be mixed into the next He-shell flash convection zone. Now, the Sr profile itself has a
little dip in its peak, because it has served as a seed for higher mass species. The network flux
has reached now Pb, and species of all three s-process peaks are enhanced by approximately
the same amount, that is, almost dex compared to the already enriched intershell abundance
of trans-iron elements as a result of previous thermal-pulse cycles and >∼dex compared to the
envelope abundance of the s-process elements (at the first thermal pulse, the intershell abun-
dance would have a level less than the present envelope abundance). This is the result of the
radiative s process driven by the C pocket.
When mixed into the He-shell flash convection zone, the content of the C pocket will first
be diluted with the ratio of the mass in the partial-mixing layer to the mass in the He-shell
flash convection zone ΔMPM/ΔMHeCZ = .×−/.= /,. Then, the freshly produced
heavy elements, mixed with the heavy elements already present from previous thermal pulses
will be exposed to the Ne neutron source, the origin of which was described above. Although
the He-shell flash convection lasts for about yr (see discussion above), the temperature is
only for a short fraction high enough (log T > .) to activate the Ne(α, n)Mg neutron
source. Again, depending on the convective boundary mixing assumptions, and on the core
mass, the duration of the high-T phase varies from less than 1 yr to a few years, and the peak
neutron density reaches Nn ∼−cm−which implies neutron exposures in the range
τ ∼.−.mbarn−. Presently, models with larger convective boundary mixing predict
higher peak temperatures, longer high-T periods, and consequently higher neutron densities.
Lugaro et al. (2003) have pointed out that such modelsmaybe incompatible with measurements
of isotopic ratios, for example, the Zr/Zr ratio, in presolar grains, which are sensitive to
s-process branchings, in this case at Zr. Clearly, these issues need further investigations, but
the interconnections between the details of the s process with aspects of the dynamical star
(>Sect. 5) are intriguing.
After the end of the exposure in the He-shell flash convection zone, the s-process enriched
material will be mixed into the envelope, again with a large dilution factor ΔM/Menv (see
discussion in section He-shell Flash Mixing and Third Dredge-Up >Sect. 3.2.1).
The present generation of models, such as those illustrated here, or those by Cristallo et al.
(2011), include the mixing processes into the stellar evolution code, and at least any feedback
that such mixing mayhave back tothe stellarstructure would be taken intoaccount. An example
for such feedback can be encountered in simulations of stars with very-low metallicity, where
the mixing of protons into the C-rich intershell leads to a hot dredge-up (Goriely and Siess
2004; Herwig 2004) with poorly understood quantitative consequences for the nuclear yield
predictions and final stellar evolution outcomes. In any case, the properties and realistic
modeling of the mixing for the C pocket remains an open problem.

s-Process Nucleosynthesis
Much of what is known today about the s process quantitatively has been discovered through
a parameterized post-processing method, in which the required amount of C was directly
inserted into the post-processing calculation. This approach was pioneered by Gallino et al.
(1998), and followed by many others, including Busso et al. (2001), and Travaglio et al. (2004)
with a focus on galactic chemical evolution, and Bisterzo et al. (2010) with an emphasis
on low-metallicity stars. Käppeler et al. (1989) and Busso et al. (1999), and more recently
Käppeler et al. (2011) provide a detailed discussion not only on simulation results but also on
the nuclear physics involved (incl. discussions on s-process branchings) and on comparisons
with and constraints from observations.
Here it is not the intention to give a comprehensive overview of the results covered in an
extensive body of literature (see above for examples). Instead, some features of the workings
of the s process are highlighted which may help to understand that body of literature better.
> Figs. 8-16–8-18 provide abundance distributions for three atomic mass ranges (so that the
entire distribution from Ne to Pb is covered). In each figure, the top panel is the initial solar-
scaled abundance distribution with which the M⊙, Z = .model star was started. The
middle panel represents the production of the C pocket while the bottom panel shows the
distribution after dilution and processing via the Ne neutron source in the He-shell flash con-
vection zone (cf. figure caption). Plotted are onlystable isotopes, and the abundance distribution
has not been decayed. Careful inspection of these plots reveals a number of interesting aspects
about the different components of the heavy element nucleosynthesis, in fact more than can
be discussed here. The abundances in these diagrams are the result of theoretical stellar simula-
tions and of the nuclear physics network of isotopes and rates used. Therefore, limitations in our
present understanding on stellar physics and nuclear physics may affect the accuracy of such
predictions. For instance, final abundances at branching points located along the s-process path
are very sensitive to the uncertainties of the nuclear rates involved. Furthermore, the treatment
of ground and isomeric states of isotopes that are not fully thermalized at stellar conditions is
still not clear (e.g., Kr85 is a branching point in the s-process path, and its ground and isomeric
state are not thermalized at typical s-process conditions in low-mass AGB stars and should
therefore be treated separately, e.g., Ward and Fowler 1980).
Just for the purpose of this discussion, the C pocket frame will be referred to as CP, and
the post-He shell flash distribution will be referred to as HF. Starting with >Fig. 8-16, as dis-
cussed before, the Ne and Mg abundances are enhanced in HF, as well as Mg due to the
Ne(α, γ)reaction competing with the Ne(α, n)branch. Most species up to iron are insignif-
icantly modified, keeping in mind the two large dilution factors that need to be applied before
the nuclear processed material gets to the surface. In the solar system distribution, most of the
s-process abundances between Fe and the first s-process peak around Sr, Y, and Zr are produced
by the weak s process in massive stars, where a nonnegligible contribution is also supposed to
come from AGB stars, in particular from massive AGB stars.
Skipping therefore right through to the first peak isotopes, Sr is a p-process elementwhich
cannot be reached by neutron captures in the s process. It is therefore only destroyed in CP and
HF. However, the other three Sr isotopes show in both panels the same relative ratios as in
the solar distribution. The same is true for the ratios of Sr, Y, and Zr, indicating their
dominantly s-process origin. For Zr, the solar isotopic ratios for the mass numbers , , and
are well reproduced by CP. However, Zr is produced ∼dex less in CP compared to the
solar-scaled distribution. The reason for that is the branching at Zr where the β decay with
a terrestrial half life of d competes with a neutron capture. In the C pocket, the neutron

panel shows, in the high neutron density environment of the He-shell flash convection zone,
at least in the M⊙case considered here, the branching is in fact open, and Zr is produced.
In fact, after processing in the HF, the ratios of all the Zr isotopes seem to reproduce the solar
ratios.
Zr is an example that demonstrates how the bulk of the s-process production takes place
in the C pocket, while certain isotopic rearrangements are taken care of by the Ne neutron
source in the He-shell flash convection zone. The sensitivity of such branchings to the exact

details of the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic conditions in the convection zone may pro-
vide eventually a powerful diagnostic tool for constraining mixing physics, given that other
physics ingredients, such as the nuclear physics, are known to sufficient accuracy.
In this discussion, the main emphasis is on s-process signatures in the solar-scaled initial
abundance distribution. However, only about half of all trans-iron elements are made in the
s process (Arlandini et al. 1999). The other half comes from the r process, and it should be
expected that there are numerous patterns that are not the result of the nucleosynthesis in M⊙
stars. In addition, the solar abundance distribution is the superposition of many sources as a
result of galactic chemical evolution, including s-process production from a range of initial
masses.
The r process is taking place in some kind of explosive environment in which very large
neutron densities (Nn >∼cm−) can be reached (Meyer 1994; Sneden et al. 2008). Sites that
have been suggested for the r process include neutron-star mergers (Freiburghaus et al. 1999)
or supernova fallback (Fryer et al. 2006). Simplified, in the r process the very large neutron

densities first drive the network flux out to the neutron drip line from where nuclei decay back
to the valley of stability.
Moving on to >Fig. 8-17, Ru and Ru are not produced either in CP or sufficiently in
HF. Both of these are predominantly produced by the r process. This is an example of how a
pronounced odd-even effect from the s process in one stellar model will be complemented by
other sources and processes. Such aspects of galactic chemical evolution have been addressed,
for example, by Timmes et al. (1995) and Travaglio et al. (2004).
Sn is another example that seems to be well reproduced by the s-process prediction from
mass number 116 to 121. Again, Sn is a p-process isotope, while Sn would come from the
r process. Similar arguments would indicate that Te, Te, and Te are primarily produced
by s process. In fact, these are s-only isotopes which are shielded by stable species on the same
isobar on the neutron-rich side. Therefore, they cannot be produced by the r process. However,
this is not the case for the more massive Te isotopes, and their production is dominated by
the r process. It is interesting to note though that some although insignificant amount of Te
is produced in HF, indicating again some branching activity. Also, for Xe and Ba, the ratio of

the s-only isotopes in the solar abundance distribution is well reproduced in CP and HF. For
completeness, the corresponding plot for the mass range between the second and the third peak
is provided (> Fig. 8-18). It reveals upon inspection, aided by a chart of nuclei (http://www.
nndc.bnl.gov/chart) similar details about the production mode of each isotope.
3.2.3 Post-AGB Evolution
Once the AGB star has lost all but a small fraction of the original envelope, the star will evolve
away from the giant solution, initially on a thermal time scale, at constant luminosity to high
temperatures. The unprocessed envelope mass that is left on the surface depends on the core
mass and is a result of stellar evolution simulations of this transition phase. The envelope mass
is approximately −M⊙for a core mass of ∼.M⊙. For the massive cores, this will decrease by
approximatelyan order of magnitude while the less massiveHe-white dwarfs will have envelope
masses larger than −M⊙(Schönberner 1981; Driebe et al. 1998).
The post-AGB evolution is shown for three stellarevolution tracks with massesaround M⊙
as part of an HRD diagram showing the entire evolution from main sequence to white dwarf,
in >Fig. 8-19.
The horizontal evolution from cool to hot at constant luminosity corresponds to the
decrease of the envelope mass due to mass loss and due to nuclear burning. In fact, the tem-
perature of the star along the constant luminosity cooling track is directly correlated with the
envelope. The luminosity follows the core-mass luminosity relationship ( >Sect. 3.2.1) and is

therefore set. For a M⊙post-AGB star (which would have started its evolution with MZAMS
∼M⊙, see >Fig. 8-21), one may expect a nuclear burning rate of ˙MH−shell ∼× −M⊙/ yr
while a star with .M⊙will have a lower burning rate of ∼.× −M⊙/ yr.
Mass Loss
The time scale on which the post-AGB star evolves to the hottest point may depend therefore
on the mass loss, if it is larger than ˙MH−burn. Higher mass loss implies a shorter post-AGB
evolution time scale (Schönberner 1981; Blöcker 1995b). AGB mass loss decreases steeply with
increasing stellar temperature because dust formation is less efficient at higher temperature,
and because the material at the surface is gravitationally more bound when the radius is smaller
(and the escape velocity is higher). For temperatures above ∼5,000 K, the mass loss according to
formulae that are intended to capture the mass loss mechanism of AGB stars (Arndt et al. 1997;
van Loon et al. 2005) falls below ˙MH−burn. Hotter stars have radiation-driven wind mass loss
˙Mrad−wind (Pauldrach et al. 1988, see also chapter on winds in this volume). For lower-mass
post-AGB stars, such as the .M⊙example given above, ˙Mrad−wind < ˙MH−burn. Therefore,
if the wind-driven mass loss theory is correct, the post-AGB evolution time will be uniquely
determined due to the mass of the post-AGB star. For higher mass cases, such as the .M⊙
case, ˙Mrad−wind >∼˙MH−burn, and in this case, the transition time from the AGB to the hot “knee”
where the track turns around into the WD cooling track will depend on the mass loss as well.
Note that the correlation between temperature and envelope mass implies that H-deficient
(or H-free) central stars of planetary nebulae of type PG 1159 or [WC] (Werner and Herwig
2006) or white dwarf of type DQ or DZ (see chapter on white dwarfs in this volume) cannot
form due to enhanced mass loss that expells the remaining H-rich envelope. Such an enhanced
mass loss would simply accelerate the post-AGB evolution, and the resulting envelope mass
of the pre-WD remains the same. The envelope mass of white dwarfs can now be probed by
asteroseismology.
Post-AGB He-Shell Flashes
Instead, the main mechanism that causes H deficiency in post-AGB stars and young white
dwarfs is believed to be He-shell flashes on the post-AGB (Herwig 2001b; Werner and Her-
wig 2006). As discussed in >Sect. 3.2, He-shell flashes occur in regular intervals. The evolution
from the AGB to the post-AGB and eventually to the WD cooling track is comparable to a frac-
tion of the order % of the interpulse time, depending on mass. H-shell burning will cease
when the envelope mass is too low to support H-burning temperatures at the mass coordinate
where the H-free core begins. At that point, the star evolves off the horizontal post-AGB track
and enters the white dwarf cooling track. This hottest feature of the post-AGB evolution is also
referred to as the knee.
He burning takes place in deeperlayers. While the star is evolving along the post-AGB track,
the thermal-pulse clock continues to tick in the He-shell region. Clearly, if the post-AGB star has
evolved ontothe properWD cooling track, nonuclearprocess can take place anymore. However,
the AGB star statistically happens to leave the giant configuration at a time in the thermal-pulse
cycle before the He-shell flash that is comparable to the evolution time to the WD cooling track.
In that case, the next He-shell flash will take place during the post-AGB evolution (Fujimoto
1977; Schönberner 1981; Iben et al. 1983; Iben and MacDonald 1995; Herwig et al. 1999).
Both the .M⊙and the .M⊙tracks in >Fig. 8-19 show the characteristic loops asso-
ciated with post-AGB He-shell flashes, which usually cause a temporary evolution back to the
AGB regime in the HRD. For this reason, this phenomenon is also called born-again evolution.
Several born-again stars, such as Sakurai’s object (e.g., Duerbeck and Benetti 1996; Hajduk et al.

Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
2005), FG Sge (Blöcker and Schönberner 1997; Jeffery and Schönberner 2006), or V605 Aq (e.g.,
Clayton et al. 2007; Hinkle et al. 2008), are known.
Two cases need to be distinguished. If the He-shell flash occurs during the high-luminosity
horizontal post-AGB evolution before the knee, the H-burning shell is still on. A high entropy
barrier prevents the mixing of the H-rich envelope into the He-shell flash convection zone.
However, the stellar surface will become H-poor later during the born-again phase due to the
emerging envelope convection and mass loss. This case is also called the late thermal pulse
(LTP). If the He-shell flash occurs later, after the star has evolved past the knee, the H-shell is
extinct, and the He-shell flash convection zone will engulf the H-rich envelope. This is called a
very-late thermal pulse (VLTP). An example of such a case is Sakurai’s object (Herwig 2001a;
Lawlor and MacDonald 2003). Sakurai’s object has detailed surface abundance observations
of trans-iron elements (Asplund et al. 1999) and can be used to guide and constrain mod-
els and simulations of the physics of H combustion, that is, the interaction of rapid nuclear
energy release from the C(p, γ)N reaction with hydrodynamic and turbulent convection
flow (Herwig et al. 2011 and >Sect. 5).
Very similar events are known from post-RGB evolution, where flash mixing of H from the
remaining envelope into a post-RGB He-core flash has been associated with horizontal branch
features in globular clusters (e.g., Brown et al. 2001).
Abundance Determinations from Post-AGB Stars
When post-AGB stars evolve along the high-L horizontal track, they evolve through a range of
temperatures and can be spectroscopically observed (van Winckel 2003). As a result, detailed
abundance information has been obtained, in particular of many heavy elements that have
formed through the s process during the progenitor AGB evolution. The abundances of post-
AGB stars represent the final enrichment of the envelope with s-process elements that have
formed cumulatively over many thermal pulses. Any future generation of stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis simulations needs to be confronted with this type of data.

Evolution as a Function of Initial Mass
Most of the basic processes and concepts of solar and intermediate-mass stars were covered by
the description of the evolution of the M⊙star. This chapter covers how the evolution depends
on mass and introduces some processes, like hot-bottom burning that are unique to stars of
other masses.
H- and He-Core Burning
Stellar evolution times depend significantly on the initial mass. Higher mass stars evolve faster
than lower mass stars, as illustrated in >Fig. 8-20. All evolutionary phases after He-core burn-
ing are short compared to H- and He-core burning. One of the greatest sources of uncertainty
concerning stellar lifetimes remains the efficiency of core overshooting. The reproduction of
the observed width of the main sequence requires some convective overshooting to extend the
main sequence to higher luminosities (Schaller et al. 1992). Such overshooting will prolong
H-core burning lifetimes. Rotation will also broaden the main sequence. At masses below
MZAMS ∼.M⊙, H-burning will be radiative. In the transition region between radiative cores

and extended convective cores, the overshooting efficiency, which is often based on parameter-
izations in terms of the pressure scale height at the convection boundary, needs to be carefully
ramped up in order to avoid artificially enlarged convective cores (VandenBerg et al. 2006).
Lower mass stars, like the sun, will have convective envelopes during the main-sequence
evolution while more massive main-sequence stars have radiative envelopes. Overlaying opac-
ities and profiles of stars with different masses in the ρ −T diagram (such as in Fig. 3 in Paxton
et al. 2011) demonstrate that convective stability or instability of envelope and core regions as
a function mass can be understood in terms of the variation of opacities as a result of atomic
physics in terms of ρ and T, and its effect on stability via the radiative gradient (> 8.3).
A major source of uncertainty during He-core burning is again mixing. Here, the com-
plicated situation of semi-convection, that was introduced in >Sect. 2, implies that He-core
burning lifetimes and subsequently the core masses at the first thermal pulse for a given initial
mass are still uncertain. This is particularly unfortunate because the thermal-pulse AGB evolu-
tion, as, for example, the onset and efficiency of the third dredge-up does depend sensitively on
the core mass.
The Initial–Final Mass Relation
The initial–final mass relation relates the initial, main-sequence mass with the mass of the white
dwarf that is the evolutionary end point of solar and intermediate-mass stars (Weidemann
2000). Observational constraints seem to indicate a significant spread in WD masses for a given
initial mass (Catalán et al. 2008). Several processes could be responsible for that, including WD

434 8
Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
mergers or other binary interactions, or differential mass loss, for example, as a result of stellar
rotation.
The importance of this relation derives from the fact that it relates two other important
relations: the initial mass function (Kroupa 2002) and the white dwarf mass distribution (e.g.,
Liebert et al. 2005). Ignoring the effect of ongoing star formation, the initial–final mass rela-
tion maps the initial mass function to the white dwarf mass distribution. An initial-final mass
relationship that creates a consistent picture between the IMF and the white-dwarf mass dis-
tribution is a powerful constraint on evolution simulations of solar and intermediate-mass
stars.
A theoretical initial–final mass relation is shown in > Fig. 8-21 for three metallicities.
According to the initial mass function, most stars (>∼85%) have low-mass <∼.M⊙. The white
dwarf mass distribution is sharply peaked around .M⊙. That means that stars with initially
around or below .M⊙have to be projected by the MiMf relation to the WD mass distribution
peak. Such considerations have been performed quantitatively by Ferrario et al. (2005). They
find the best fit to the white dwarf mass distribution with an MiMf relation with double curva-
ture shown in >Fig. 8-21 for comparison. The MiMf relation is in this way an important global

constraint on the evolution models. The lower mass models cannot have a lot of core growth,
with implications for mass loss and third dredge-up efficiency.
Low-Mass Stars with He-Core Flash and Those Which Become C-Rich AGB Stars
Some of the structure in the MiMf relation may be related to initial mass limits of different
burning types. Stars with MZAMS <∼.M⊙will ignite He-core burning under degenerate con-
ditions (Serenelli and Weiss 2005). The characteristic triangle-shaped feature of the .M⊙
track in the ρc −Tc (>Fig. 8-3) signals the expansion of the core at constant degeneracy (par-
allel to the Pgas = Pdeg line) has a result of the energy input from the flash, followed by heating
at almost constant pressure (sharp upward evolution at log ρc ∼.) toward the location of
He-core burning. A Kippenhahn diagram of a stellar evolution simulation through the He-core
flash is shown in >Fig. 8-22. Using the model number instead of time on the abscissa allows
to show both the short-lived He-core flash, followed by multiple smaller post-flashes, the He-
core burning (model ∼17,100–17,900), the early AGB evolution, as well as the first two thermal
pulses.
The .M⊙, Z = .track does not show significant third dredge-up because the enve-
lope mass at the first thermal pulse is already relatively small. The stellar model therefore never
becomes C-rich (> Fig. 8-12) and does not experience the associated enhanced mass loss.
The M⊙model has efficient dredge-up, which implies quick increase of the C/O ratio and
reduced core growth compared to a sequence with less efficient third dredge-up. Once enhanced
mass-loss for C-rich surface composition is activated further core growth will be limited.

and the third (log(tﬁnal −t) < 7.24) dredge-ups are present, plus hot-bottom burning is modifying
the CNO isotopes during the interpulse phases between He-shell ﬂashes
Massive AGB Stars with Hot-Bottom Burning That Become CO White Dwarfs
At a core mass >∼.M⊙, hot-bottom burning sets in and the slope of the MiMf relation changes
again. Hot-bottom burning is the colorful name for a situation when the bottom of the convec-
tive envelope reaches into the outer layers of the H-burning shell (Boothroyd et al. 1995). As
a result, the envelope abundances, in particular of the CNO isotopes, change during the inter-
pulse phase (> Fig. 8-23). Due to the convectively added fuel, the H-burning shell generates
luminosity that is larger than expected from the core-mass luminosity relation (see above and
Blöcker and Schönberner 1991).
> Figure 8-23 shows the surface abundance evolution for the entire evolution of a M⊙,
Z = .stellar evolution track. The evolution up to the end of He-core burning is similar
to that described in detail for the M⊙case. The effect of the first dredge-up can be seen at
log(tfinal −t) = .. At the time mark ., the H-free core decreases significantly, and some
N and He (not shown) are mixed into the envelope. This is the second dredge-up which is
only found in the more massive AGB stars (> Figs. 8-23 and >8-24). Once the thermal-pulse
AGB starts, the CNO isotopes show the effect of both third dredge-up and H burning at the

bottom of the envelope. C is mixed up and its abundance increases a little bit, only to decrease
during the subsequent interpulse by processing into N. As a result, the M⊙stellar model
will not become C-rich. The C/O ratio evolution for this case (>Fig. 8-12) first shows initially
simply small increases of the C/O ratio because, although λ ∼, the total mass that is dredged-
up, compared to the envelope mass is simply rather small. The intershell mass decreases with
increasing core mass. Only during the last thermal-pulse cycle is a reduction due to hot-bottom
burning evident (around M⋆∼.M⊙).
Characteristic for hot-bottom burning is a C/C ratio close to the (T-dependent) equilib-
rium value for H burning. In the case shown here, hot-bottom burning is not efficient enough
to destroy O. This is however possible in more massive cases and at lower metal content.
The reduced slope of the MiMf in this mass range may be explained by a combination of
effects. In hot-bottom burning, part of the fuel is brought into the H-burning shell convectively
from the envelope above, while the H-burning ashes are brought back into the envelope. This
reduces the amount of He accreted on the CO core and slows the core growth. Models in this
mass range also show the largest dredge-up efficiency, further limiting core growth during the
thermal-pulse phase.
Progenitors of ONeMg WDs or Electron-Capture Core-Collapse Supernova
If the H-free core exceeds ∼.M⊙, C is ignited and O, Ne, and Mg are produced. These
are the super-AGB stars (García-Berro and Iben 1994; Siess 2010). The limiting masses for
this evolutionary outcome are important for supernova progenitor determinations. Only white
dwarfs that form a CO core can explode as a thermonuclear supernova of type Ia. The lim-
iting initial mass for CO core formation is MZAMS = M⊙for Z = .which can be read

438 8
Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
off >Fig. 8-21. Stars with larger initial mass are not supernova type Ia progenitors. Since the
largest core mass with which a CO-white dwarf can form from single star evolution is .M⊙,
the white dwarf will somehow have to gain mass to reach Chandrasekhar mass. This can either
happen through accretion and shell burning from a binary companion or via a double degen-
erate merger. If the initial mass is larger than MZAMS = M⊙, the star will ignite C as well as
following burning stages under non- or only weakly-degenerate conditions, and the outcome
is likely a core-collapse supernova.
For stellar models that just make it over the ∼.M⊙core-mass limit (after the second
dredge-up), C-ignition takes place off-center in a shell and just like the He-core flash under
degenerate conditions. In fact, in the ρc −Tc diagram (> Fig. 8-3), a similar triangle-shaped
feature can be observed for the M⊙track that again signals the C-shell ignition. Whether
or not these C-shells always burn all the way to the center is not yet clear. In the case shown
in >Fig. 8-22, C-ignition takes place in the core, followed by a series of shell flashes that work
their way out to the He-free core-mass boundary. During the same time, significant second
dredge-up can be seen in the outer layers. The H-free core is reduced from ∼.M⊙to just below
the Chandrasekhar mass. Around model number 4,500, a small He-shell flash convection zone
emerges which gives the second dredge-up a final boost. This feature has been observed in many
super-AGB simulations, and it is also called dredge-out (Ritossa et al. 1999; Siess 2007).
Super-AGB stars could in principle end their lives in supernova explosions if the H-free core
can grow to the Chandrasekharmass. Whetheror not this can happen dependsprimarily on the
mass loss of the supergiants, as well as on the dredge-up efficiency (Poelarends et al. 2008). The
latter depends, again, on the efficiency of convective boundary mixing. If the mass loss is large,
the envelope of the super-AGB star is lost quickly, and the core, which is maximally growing
at the H-shell burning rate, does not have time to reach Chandrasekhar mass. If convective
boundary mixing is efficient, the dredge-up parameter may be λ ∼, and the core does not
grow, no matter how low the mass loss is. If the super-AGB stars reaches the Chandrasekhar
mass, it will start collapse via electron captures on Mg and Ne. The details of the subsequent
supernova explosion are presently investigated.
If the super-AGB star does not explode, it will end its live as a massive ONe white dwarf.
Numerous ONe nova have been found (Shore et al. 2003), and for those, obviously, ONe white
dwarf must be able to form. Also, the WD mass distribution is now better populated with objects
around 1.2–1.3 M⊙. These could very well be ONe white dwarf.
5
Evolution at Low Metallicity and the Dynamical Star
In >Sect. 2, some limitations of the spherically symmetric stellar evolution assumptions were
described. In this section, the status of modeling rotation in AGB stars as well as the phe-
nomenon of dynamic interactions between rapid nuclear energy release via the C(p, γ)N
reaction rate and convective flow will be described.
5.1 Rotation
Rotation will change the evolution ofstars in at least three ways. When stars rotate, equipotential
and isothermal surfaces in the star maynot coincide anymore. Therefore, the direction in which

Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars 8
439
the temperaturegradient points is not always parallel to the direction where gravity points. This
leads to global thermal and structural imbalances and deviations from strict spherical symme-
try that give rise to large-scale meridional circulations which induces mixing. Mixing will also
result, for example, from shear flows in regions of large angular velocity gradients (Maeder and
Meynet 2000).
In intermediate-mass stars of low metallicity, these rotation-induced mixing processes are
predicted to lift primary C and O out of the He-burning core (Meynet and Maeder 2002).
This material can further mix through the H-burning shell, where most of it will be processed
into N (see >Fig. 8-14 for an example of a H-burning shell in an AGB star). According to
these models, intermediate-massstars with even very-low initial metal content would arrive on
the thermal-pulse AGB with an envelope CNO abundance that is only 1 dex below solar. This
would have implications for, and in fact may prevent, the occurrence of the H-ingestion events
in low-metallicity thermal-pulse AGB stars.
Rotation, as well as other mixing mechanisms, have been investigated as sources for extra-
mixing below that envelope convection zone that is required to explain the abundance evolution
along the RGB and (early-)AGB (e.g., Denissenkov and VandenBerg 2003; Palacios et al. 2006;
Charbonnel and Lagarde 2010).
Rotation will effect the way the s process operates in thermal-pulse AGB stars (Langer et al.
1999; Herwig et al. 2003; Siess et al. 2004). The current models do not induce enough mix-
ing at the end of the third dredge-up to account quantitatively for the size of the C pocket
(see >Sect. 3.2.2). In addition, present models of rotating AGB stars predict too much mix-
ing in the C pocket which would lead to a poisoning of the s-process neutron source via
the admixture of N and the N(n, p)C reaction. This large amount of mixing at the core-
envelope interface may be the result of a too large angular velocity gradient resulting from
inefficient angular momentum transport during the previous evolution. The fact that observed
white dwarfs rotate much slower than the cores of rotating tip-AGB star models (Suijs et al.
2008) points in the same direction of missing angular momentum transport mechanisms in
present models of rotating stars. However, a significantly reduced amount of rotation-induced
mixing at the core-envelope boundary may in fact help to account for the observed spread in
neutron exposure for stars of a given initial mass and metallicity (Herwig 2005).
5.2 Dynamic Interaction of Nuclear Burning with Convection
The most important difference for the evolution of stars at very low or even zero metal content
is the reduced availability of CNO material that either prevents or limits the efficiency of the
CNO-cycle mode of H burning. As a result, to make better use of what is available, the CNO
cycle will operate at higher temperature to recycle the available CNO material more often.
If the metal content is indeed zero (Pop. III), then H burning will proceed via the PP chains.
At higher masses, this will require such large temperatures that even during H-core burning at
some point trace amounts of C appear from triple-α reaction.
When H burns at higher temperature, it is closer, in terms of entropy, to the conditions in
the He shell. One of the themes of stellar evolution at extremely low metal content (Z <∼−)
is frequent encounters of H-combustion events. These are all events in which in one way or
another protons get mixed with primary C at convective velocities. Such instances have been
reported in stellar evolution calculations of solar and intermediate-massstars of very-low metal
content for many decades, for example, in the He-core flash during which H-rich material from

440 8
Evolution of Solar and Intermediate-Mass Stars
the unprocessed envelope above is ingested into the C-rich layer underneath (Fujimoto et al.
2000; Weiss et al. 2004). A similar scenario are the AGB He-shell flashes (Iwamoto et al. 2004;
Campbell and Lattanzio 2008), where again H ingestion in the He-shell flash has been found.
Closely related phenomena have been observed during the third dredge-up in metal-poor AGB
stars, where the convective boundary mixing induced to facilitate dredge-up and C causes a
vicious feedback from protons reacting with C on the mixing time scale. This hot dredge-up
is quantitatively not understood and limits the accuracy of simulation predictions at these low
metallicities (Herwig 2004; Goriely and Siess 2004).
All these events are characterized by an interaction of the rapid nuclear energy release by
C(p, γ)N as well as the β-decay of N and the hydrodynamics and turbulence of the con-
vective flow. The regime can be identified in terms of the Damköhler number (Dimotakis 2005):
Dα = τmix
τreact
(8.9)
where τmix represents the mixing time scale, which can be estimatedfrom mixing-length theory
in the convection zone as the convective turnover time scale. τreact is the reaction time scale,
and can be estimated for each reaction, for example, for the C(p, γ) reaction by
τC(p) =

X(C)ρNA < σv >
(8.10)
where 12 is the mass number of C, X is the mass fraction of C, ρ density, and NA < σv >
is the Avogadro number times the reaction rate, as, for example, tabulated for many charged
particle reactions by Angulo et al. (1999).
If Dα ≪, then nuclear burning is slow compared to mixing, and the convection zone is
always well mixed. This would be, for example, the situation during H-core burning. However,
if Dα ∼burning and advective flows are on the same time scale and will effect each other if the
amount of energy released in the reactions is dynamically relevant. The reaction rate increases
strongly with temperature. At T ∼.× K and ρ ∼g/cm, τmix ∼τreact ∼min. The
temperature corresponds to a location approximately halfway between the location where the
H ingestion takes place (T < K) and where the He burning takes place (T ∼× K).
The main problem of these H-combustion events is that it is unlikely that they can be
correctly described with the mixing model (mixing-length theory) presently used in many
spherical stellar evolution codes (see discussion in >Sect. 2). Mixing-length theory uses time
and spatial averages over times and scales that are much longer/larger than the scales of sig-
nificant nuclear energy release on the convective turnover time scale. The key question, that
spherically symmetric simulations cannot answer, is how distributed and inhomogeneous the
nuclear energy release is on large scales. The more inhomogeneous the burn is due to inho-
mogenous distribution of H-fuel enriched downdrafts, the less spherically symmetric is the
situation. Another key question concerns the width of the burning flame that depends on the
velocity distribution of H-fuel enriched downdrafts.
In the previous section, the H-ingestion evolution of very-late thermal-pulse stars was
described. It is triggered by a He-shell flash that happens after the post-AGB star has evolved
around the knee, but before, it has cooled down so much that it cannot support nuclear burn
anymore at all. These post-AGB H-ingestion flash stars perform the same type of event as their
very-low-metallicitycounterparts. The advantage ofthe post-AGBstars is that forsome ofthem,
most notably Sakurai’s object, excellent observational information of the real-time evolution

aims to reproduce specifically the conditions of Sakurai’s object when it erupted in 1996. One of
the most obvious but also most important differences between 3D and 1D simulations of such
phases is that in 1D, the H-rich material is represented by one number for the entire π sphere
according to the assumption of spherical symmetry. Contrary to that, the 3D simulation shown
in >Fig. 8-25 reveals large-scale inhomogeneities during this early stage of the H entrainment.
The energy generation follows the composition distribution and they both will be patchy and
spotty. While 1D simulations predict that the energy should be released in a very well-defined
and thin layer, the 3D picture suggests that a more regional, variable, and time-dependent
nuclear burning mode is possible under certain circumstances. The spherically symmetric burn

of the 1D simulations would predict that the energy release from H-combustion would quickly
prohibit mixing from the outer parts of the convection zone to the hottest layers where neu-
trons can be released. Investigations based on hydrodynamic simulations such as those shown
in >Fig. 8-25 will eventually clarify the properties of H combustion in stellar evolution. This
will greatly improve the fidelity of simulations and yield prediction of stars with very low or
even zero metal content that were formed in the early universe.

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars
Abstract:
The evolution of stars more massive than 8 M⊙is discussed in this chapter. On the
main sequence, these stars have spectral types of B2 or earlier, but depending on their mass can
evolve into red supergiants, blue supergiants, Cepheids, Wolf–Rayet stars, Of stars, or luminous
blue variables before ending their evolution as core collapse supernovae and neutron stars or
black holes. The chapter begins with a general discussion of the energy production in the inte-
rior of a massive star as it evolves. The main fusion reactions that generate the star’s energy are
listed. Some observed properties of the O and early B main-sequence stars and their evolved
products are discussed including the best determinations of their masses. The computation of
contemporary evolutionary tracks that include stellar rotation and magnetic fields is detailed.
The equations of stellar structure including those for energy conservation, momentum trans-
fer, mass conservation, and energy transport are listed. The discussion includes the meridional
circulation in the interior of a rotating massive star and its effect on the transport of nuclear-
processed material to the surface and the impact of rotation, mass loss, and metallicity on the
evolutionary tracks. Recent evolutionary tracks from the Geneva group are presented. Finally
the newest evolutionary tracks and the surface abundances predicted by the calculations are
compared with recent observations.

Introduction
Stars more massive than 8 M⊙may be quite rare,1 but they supply most of the ionizing radia-
tion in a galaxy, typically show many types of spectroscopic and photometric variability, display
some of the most striking spectra, and will eventually end their evolution as core collapse super-
novae, neutron stars or black holes, and some gamma-ray bursters. This chapter discusses the
evolution of these stars from the main sequence to their final products. We consider only single-
star evolution even though more than half of the massive stars are most likely formed in close
binary systems and mass transfer between the components stars and systemic mass loss will
produce profound effects on their post-main-sequence lives and the chemical evolution of a
galaxy (Vanbeveren 2001; Van Rensbergen et al. 2010, 2011). In this section, a basic overview
of the interior evolution of a massive star is presented. In the following sections, we discuss the
observed properties of the stars that are found in the upper portion of the HR diagram, the
computation of evolutionary tracks that include rotation and magnetic fields, and a discussion
on the extent to which the contemporary calculations agree with the observations.
The first set of theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars that agreed well with the
observed color-magnitude diagrams of star clusters were computed in the 1960s (and refer-
ences therein Iben 1967; Iben and Renzini 1983). The computations were carried through for
a nonrotating star without the influence of a magnetic field. A new generation of stellar mod-
els continues to be produced by the Geneva group (Schaller et al. 1992; Maeder and Meynet
2000a; Ekström et al. 2012, http://obswww.unige.ch/Recherche/evol/-Database-) that include

M⊙star, there are a more than a million suns (Massey 2003).

improved energy generation and neutrino loss rates, better opacities in the interior and optically
thick winds of Wolf–Rayet stars, and the effects of rotation.
The energy generated in a massive star’s convective core is produced by the basic thermonu-
clear reactions listed below (see Clayton 1983 for information on the full gamut of reactions).
More recent refinements can be found in Pagel (2009) and the papers from the Geneva group
that can be found on the website listed above. During the main-sequence phase, hydrogen is
converted to helium through the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO) cycle and its branch the
CNO bi-cycle. If the total mass of the end products is less than the initial ones, the differential
proton mass is converted to energy via the familiar Einstein equation ΔE = Δmc. For massive
stars, the energy generation exceeds MeV g−s−(Pagel 2009). The process of building
the elements in the Periodic Table from other elements through thermonuclear fusion is called
nucleosynthesis. For the CNO cycle, most of the time the reactions proceed as follows2:
C + H →N + γ
N →C + e+ + νe
C + H →N + γ
N + H →O + γ
O →N + e+ + νe
N + H →C + He.
C, N, and O serve as catalysts to convert four hydrogen nuclei into one helium nucleus. γ is the
gamma radiation in the MeV domain that is generated. The abundance of C, N, and O does not
change. But 0.04% of the time, the last reaction takes another path and gives the CNO bi-cycle:
N + H →O + γ
O + H →F + γ
F →O + e+ + νe
O + H →N + He.
Similar to the first branch, hydrogen is converted to helium, but over time each C cata-
lyst is destroyed and replaced by a N nucleus. The convective core becomes rich in helium
and nitrogen but depleted in carbon. As the hydrogen fuel becomes substantially depleted,
the energy production in the core decreases and the mean molecular weight increases caus-
ing a pressure decrease in the core. The core is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium and an
overall contraction ensues. Energy production eventually moves to a hydrogen-rich shell that
surrounds the hydrogen-depleted core. The contraction raises the density and temperature of
the core (through the release of gravitational energy), and when the core temperature reaches
about K, helium fusion can commence through the triple-alpha process (cf. Clayton 1983;
Pagel 2009, for the details surrounding this remarkable set of reactions). The energy generation
by the triple-alpha process and the advanced nucleosynthesis processes listed below are very
temperature and density dependent and can raise the energy output from the core by an order
2Thermonuclear reaction chains are frequently written in a compact form showing the by-products in parenthe-
ses (e.g., the CNO bi-cycle is O(p, γ)F(β+νe)O(p, α)N, where p, β+, νe, and α are the proton, positron,
neutrino, and helium nucleus.)

of magnitude or more when the threshold conditions that allow the thermonuclear reactions to
operate are achieved.
He + He ⇌Be
Be + He →C + γ
After sufficient C has been produced, carbon can then go on to make oxygen and neon.
C + He →O + γ
O + He →Ne + γ
Unlike the stars of low and intermediate mass, the condensed cores of massive stars do not
develop a degenerate structure, and degeneracy pressure is not a major source of support for
the overlying envelope. Rather, a steady contraction sets in that ultimately leads to the synthesis
of the light and Fe group elements as less massive nuclei are fused into heavier species. Each
successive fusion chain is fed by the ashes left behind by the earlier one and each set of reac-
tions ceases when the seed nuclei are consumed.3 The stars less massive than 40 M⊙will pass
through blue/red supergiant and Cepheid phases as they evolve (see > Sects. 3 and >4), but
for the most massive stars mass loss prevents the star from reaching the coolest part of the HR
Diagram.
Continued core contraction past He burning,4 raises the central temperature to about
× K in massive stars and produces additional light elements from the fusion of carbon.
Ignition is in a nondegenerate core. In the later stages plasma neutrino loss becomes signifi-
cant producing a cooling effect in the core, and the evolution greatly accelerates with each new
phase. Some examples of advanced nucleosynthesis are:

Ne + He

Further contraction leads to a prevailing core temperature of around .−.× K and
the onset of neon and oxygen fusion.

3In the jargon of nucleosynthesis, the term “ash” is used to mean the nuclear product of a series of thermonu-
clear reactions.
4Historically such thermonuclear reactions have been called “burning” as the fusion reactions consume a
nuclear “fuel,” but this is a misnomer as the term implies that the reactions are chemical rather than nuclear.
Nevertheless, the term is occasionally used in this chapter.

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars 9

At this stage, the energy production proceeds at a very high rate, and the nuclear fuel in the
core is exhausted in a short time. As the core continues to contract and its ambient temperature
exceeds × K, silicon and other elements of intermediate mass can undergo an α-capture
process to produce the Fe group nuclei through reactions similar to these5:
Si + He ⇌S + γ
S + He ⇌Ar + γ
⋮
Cr + He ⇌Ni + γ.
The chains above ultimately yield to the production of Ni, Fe, and the Fe group elements
(Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The core of the star has now taken on an onion-shell appearance
(>Fig. 9-1) with an Fe–Ni center surrounded by thin shells that are the sites of Si, O, Ne, C, He,
and H burning. Each shell has a temperature that is favorable to its prevailing fusion reactions.
The reactions feed on the ash left behind by the fusion in the shell above it. Most of the ther-
monuclear reactions listed above are exothermic and thus provide energy to the stellar interior.
But the Fe group elements fall at the peak of a plot of binding energy per nucleon (Clayton 1983;
Pagel 2009), and Fe is the most stable of all. Consequently, less energy is released per nucleon
at this stage, so the lifetime of the thermonuclear reaction is shorter. Any further attempt to
synthesize the Fe peak species is endothermic and precipitously cools the core. Energy loss from

The structure is not drawn to scale. Regions between the active shells contain the material for the
fusion reactions below them but are not hot enough to enable them to take place. For a 25 M⊙
star, the above ﬁgure includes only the inner 30% of the star’s mass. The values of log (T) range
from about 8.0 at the He-burning shell to 10.0 at the center (The illustration is adapted from data

neutrino production accelerates. The result is a collapse of the core and the production of a type
Ib, Ic, orII supernova. It is interesting tocompare the lifetimes ofthe hierarchyofthermonuclear
fusion reactions discussed above. For a 20 M⊙star, the main-sequence lifetime (H burning) is
about years, core He burning lasts years, C burning is completed in 300 years, O burning
in 200 days, and Si burning is less than 2 days. The final stages of core nuclear fusion occur in
less than 1 year!

The Stars of the Upper Main Sequence
The stars considered in this chapter begin as main-sequence stars of B2V or earlier
(Harmanec 1988). It is difficult to determine reliable masses for the most massive stars because
we do not observe a normal photosphere. Their spectra are dominated by features formed in
optically thick, dynamic atmospheres and often circumstellar material. Stellar parameters for
the massive eclipsing binaries with the most accurately determined masses and radii are given in
>Table 9-1. These systems have spectral lines that are primarily photospheric.6 Their masses
and radii are accurate to about 2%. The most massive star with well-determined stellar parame-
ters, V3903 Sgr (O7 V), has a mass of 27.3 M⊙, though theoretical calculations suggest that the
most massive stars main-sequence stars (O2 V) are 120 M⊙or slightly more. The highest mass
determined so far is for the primary in NGC 3603-A1, a system with two WN6ha emission line
stars with masses of 116 ± 31 and 89 ± 16 M⊙(Schnurr et al. 2008).
The evolved products of OB main-sequence stars include blue, yellow, and red supergiants
(BSGs, YSGs, RSGs), Cepheids, Of stars, Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars, and luminous blue variables
(LBVs). The domains in the HR diagram occupied by these objects and the locations of the well-
calibrated stars listed in >Table 9-1 are shown in >Fig. 9-2. With the overlay of the evolutionary
tracks from the Geneva group, it is immediatelyevident which mass ranges produce the various
evolved stars discussed in this chapter. Stars with masses less than 25 M⊙will evolve to the red
supergiant phase. Those with masses ≤M⊙will pass through the Cepheid instabilitystrip. The
LBVs end their evolution before they reach the red supergiant stage and are less luminous than
the Humphreys–Davidson limit (Humphreys and Davidson 1994) where the star’s luminosity
approaches the Eddington limit.7
To illustrate the range of spectral characteristics that the massive stars discussed in this
chapter display, we show representative far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of selected main-sequence
and evolved objects in >Fig. 9-3. The FUV contains numerous resonance lines of abundant
species, many of which are formed in the star’s wind or circumstellar (CS) material, lines from
ions of carbon and nitrogen that can confirm or refute the presence of mixing of nuclear-
processed material from the interior, and the FUV is also the region where these objects radiate
most of their flux. More information on the nature of these stars is presented in the three
subsections below.
6The far ultraviolet spectra of B stars as cool as B0.5 IV (e.g., HR 1887) reveal violet asymmetries in the
resonance lines from abundant ions such as Si IV, and such features most certainly contain a weak wind
component.
7The Eddington limit is the maximum radiative luminosity a star can reach and still be in hydrostatic equi-
librium. LEd = πcGM/¯κ, where c the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M the star’s mass, and
¯κ the mean opacity in the surface layers, which can include electron scattering and a temperature-dependent
component due to lines from the Fe group elements.

group’s website in 2011
2.1 Main-Sequence O and Early B Stars
The spectra of the nonevolved early B stars are distinguished in both the optical and UV by
prominent lines of H, He I, and Si III. Fe III and other doubly ionized species from the Fe group
pervade the FUV/NUV spectrum. Furthermore C III, N III, and Si IV lines are strong in the
FUV for objects near B0. O II features are prominent in the optical spectra of the B1–B2 stars.
Early B stars tend to have moderate–highrates of rotation and thus typically display rotationally
broadened lines that render it difficult to determine the elemental abundances in their atmo-
spheres and sometimes the radial velocity curves for binary systems. It is unclear whether the
ultrasharp-lined B stars that are so useful for abundance investigations are intrinsically slow
rotators or just viewed pole-on. Violet asymmetries in the FUV resonance lines reveal weak
winds in B0–B0.5 stars. Be stars are rapidly rotating B stars which develop CS disks that are
variable on time scales of minutes to decades.8 There remains debate on whether these objects

cussed in this chapter and provide a good test for stellar evolution calculations that include the
effects of rotation.
In the O stars, wind effects steadily increase with earlier spectral type and by O5 the atmo-
sphere is entirely dynamic (see >Fig. 9-3). The earliest spectral type O2 was defined by Walborn
et al. (2002). All of the stars at the upper end of the main sequence show emission in one or more
spectral features. Oe stars with He II λ4686 and the N III triplet λλ4634-42 in emission are his-
torically designated as Of stars. These are very young massive stars rapidly evolving from their
short life on the main sequence. For detailed information on the optical and FUV spectral char-
acteristics of the main-sequence O and B stars, as well as their evolved counterparts, the reader
is referred to the book by Gray and Corbally (2009). The X-ray properties of a large number of
OB stars in the Carina star formation complex can be found in Nazé et al. (2011) and Gagné
et al. (2011), and other articles in the 2011 special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement
on observations of the Carina region with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. From 60 single O
stars, Gagné et al. determined that log(LX/LBOL) = −.± .. The observed properties of
the massive star populations in Local Group galaxies are detailed in a review by Massey (2003).
2.2 The Wolf–Rayet Stars
The Wolf–Rayet stars are the evolved products of O stars. The literature on these objects is exten-
sive, and the reader is referred to the review by Crowther (2007). WR spectra are characterized

by strong broad emission lines (>Fig. 9-3) that can be classified into two basic sequences. The
spectra of one group are dominated by lines of He and N (the WN stars), while the other shows
lines of He, C, and O (the WC stars). Each branch is further classified into subtypes (WN3–
WN8, WC4–WC9) based upon ionization criteria (Gray and Corbally 2009) where the smaller
subtype means higher-ionization species dominate. The stars which show high-ionization emis-
sion lines are called “early” types and those with less ionization are designated “late” types and
are designated as WNE, WCE, WNL, or WCL. Within the past 20 years, another branch that
shows lines of O VI, O V, and O IV, designated WO (subtypes WO1–WO5), has been identi-
fied but these stars appear to be just higher-ionization versions of the WC objects (Crowther
et al. 1998). Sometimes, a hybrid WN/C star is observed, but such objects are probably WN
stars with an enhanced carbon abundance (Massey and Grove 1989). The spectra of WR stars
are usually pure emission except for occasional P-Cygni absorption components formed in the
star’s wind. Normal photospheric absorption lines are not observed in the WR stars.
The masses of WR stars range from 10 to 25 M⊙, though these are objects that have under-
gone substantial mass loss from the time of their formation as O stars. Their spectral features
are formed entirely in an optically thick wind, and the dominant chemical species observed
depends on which by-products from the nucleosynthesis in the star’s interiorare currentlybeing
circulated up to the surface. The WN stars have lost their H envelopes and are now exposing the
N-rich material from the CNO cycle. Further mass loss produces a WC/WO star as the carbon-
rich material from the triple-alpha process is now exposed. The original mass of the star appears
to be important in determining which type of WR star is produced. The longer a star survives,
the more of the star’s interior material we will observe. Crowther (2007) suggests that O stars
more massive than 75 M⊙will evolve as:
O →WN(H −rich) →LBV →WN(H −poor) →WC →SN Ic.
If the initial mass is in the range 40–75 M⊙:
O →LBV →WN(H −poor) →WC →SN Ic.
O stars from 25–40 M⊙will evolve as:
O →LBV/RSG →WN(H −poor) →WC →SN Ib.

O stars observed at the top region of the HR diagram. This class includes familiar objects such
as η Car and P Cyg. Other well-studied LBVs are AG Car, HR Car, and the Pistol star. Less than
20 LBVs have been studied in any detail. At one time, η Car and the Pistol star may have been
the most massive stars in our galaxy. Properties of this class of objects are discussed by Smith
(2011), Smith et al. (2010), Humphreys and Davidson (1994), and Crowther (2007).
The hallmark of LBVs is their discrete outbursts (Smith 2011; Gray and Corbally 2009).
Some such as η Car and P Cyg have displayed giant eruptive events in recent history where it
is estimated that 0.1–10 M⊙of material may have been ejected. Since the luminosities of LBVs
are very close to the Eddington limit, the eruptions may have been triggered when the star’s flux
exceeded their Eddington luminosity. But the origin of the LBV eruptions remains unknown.

The radiation pressure alone appears not to be capable of producing such an abrupt mass loss.
Perhaps, magnetic fields are important.
LBVs bear some similarity to WR stars. Their spectra are H poor and primarily composed of
emission lines formed in an optically thick wind. They are probably the progenitors to the WN
stars that are deficient in hydrogen (Crowther2007). Due tothe rarityofLBVs, some researchers
have suggested that they represent a brief transitory evolutionary phase between main-sequence
O stars and the core He-burning WR stars, while others caution that a large number of LBVs
have not yet been identified because their defining characteristic, the eruptions, are infre-
quent (Smith 2011). According to Smith, the original masses of some LBVs could be as low as
20–25 M⊙, in which case they have lost significant mass during an earlier RSG phase. But many
LBVs probably were the most massive O stars ever formed. Observations of LBVs are incredibly
important for gaining insight into how the very massive stars evolve. They can give us informa-
tion on the extent of mass loss, wind variability and structure (including degree of clumpiness),
binarity, and presence of magnetic fields and pulsations.
LBVs fall in the same domain in the HR diagram as the O, B, and A supergiants. Charac-
teristics of the latter group of variable stars are given in Gray and Corbally (2009) and Howarth
and Prinja (1989). Wind variability in the B supergiants is varied and substantial (Prinja et al.
2002). Hα is typically in emission in the late B and A supergiants. Most of these objects probably
originated from late O stars.

Contemporary Calculations of Evolutionary Tracks
3.1 Stellar Evolution Models
Stellar evolution models require a wide range of input physics ranging from nuclear reaction
rates to mass loss prescriptions. In this section, we review the basic equations that govern the
structure and evolution of stars as well as some of the key input physics with a special emphasis
on rotation.
3.1.1 Stellar Structure Equations
There are four equations describing the evolution of the structure of stars: the mass, momen-
tum, and energy conservation equations and the energy transport equations, which we recall
below. In addition, the equations for the evolution of chemical abundances must be followed.
These equations are discussed in the next section. In the Geneva stellar evolution code (GENEC,
see Eggenberger et al. 2007), which we base our presentation on in this section, the problem
is treated in one dimension (1D), and the equations of the evolution of chemical elements
abundances are calculated separately from the structure equations, as in the original version
of Kippenhahn and Weigert (Kippenhahn et al. 1967; Kippenhahn and Weigert 1990). In
GENEC, rotation is included and spherical symmetryis nolongerassumed. The effective gravity
(sum of the centrifugal force and gravity) can in fact no longer be derived from a potential, and
the case is said to be nonconservative. The problem can still be treated in 1D by assuming that
the angular velocity is constant on isobars. This assumes that there is a strong horizontal (along
isobars) turbulence which enforces constant angular velocity on isobars (Zahn 1992). The case

is referred to as “shellular” rotation and using reasonable simplifications described in Meynet
and Maeder (1997), the usual set of four structure equations (as used for nonrotating stellar
models) can be recovered:

3.1.2 Rotation and Magnetic Fields
The physics of rotation included in stellar evolution codes has been developed extensively over
the last 20 years. A recent review of this development can be found in Maeder and Meynet
(2012). The effects induced by rotation can be divided into three categories:
1. Hydrostatic effects: The centrifugal force changes the hydrostatic equilibrium of the star. The
star becomes oblate and the equations describing the stellar structure must be modified as
described above.
2. Mass loss enhancement and anisotropy: Mass loss depends on the opacity and the effective
gravity (sum of gravity and centrifugal force) at the surface. The larger the opacity, the larger
the mass loss. The higher the effective gravity, the higher the radiative flux (von Zeipel 1924)
and effective temperature. Rotation, via the centrifugal force, reduces the surface effective
gravity at the equator compared to the pole. As a result, the radiative flux of the star is larger
at the pole than at the equator. In massive hot stars, since the opacity is dominated by the
temperature–independentelectron scattering, rotation enhances mass loss at the pole. If the
opacity increases when the temperature decreases (cooler stars), mass loss can be enhanced
at the equator.
For rotating models, the mass-loss rates can be obtained by applying a correction factor
to the radiative mass-loss rate as described in Maeder and Meynet (2000b):
˙M(Ω) = FΩ ⋅˙M(Ω = ) = FΩ ⋅˙Mrad
with
FΩ =
(−Γ)

α −
[−
Ω
πGρm −Γ]

α −,
(9.5)
where Ω represents the angular velocity of the star, Γ = L/LEd = κL/(πcGM) is
the Eddington factor (κ is the electron-scattering opacity), and α is the force multiplier
parameter depending on Teff.
For mass-loss rates, ˙M(Ω = ), the following prescriptions are commonly used: Vink
et al. (2001) for radiatively driven wind of O-type stars, Nugis and Lamers (2000) for
Wolf–Rayet stars, and de Jager et al. (1988) for cooler stars not covered by the other two
prescriptions and for which dust and pulsation could play a role in the driving of the wind.
3. Rotation driven instabilities: The main rotation driven instabilities are horizontal turbu-
lence, meridional circulation, and dynamical and secular shear (see Maeder 2009 for a
comprehensive description of rotation-induced instabilities).
Horizontal turbulence corresponds to turbulence along the isobars. If this turbulence is
strong, rotation is constant on isobars and the situation is usually referred to as “shellular
rotation” (Zahn 1992). The horizontal turbulence is expected to be stronger than the vertical
turbulence because there is no restoring buoyancy force along isobars (see Maeder 2003 for
recent development on this topic).
Meridional circulation, also referred to as Eddington–Sweet circulation, arises from the
local breakdown of radiative equilibrium in rotating stars. This is due to the fact that surfaces
of constant temperature do not coincide with surfaces of constant pressure. Indeed, since rota-
tion elongates isobars at the equator, the temperature on the same isobar is lower at the equator
than at the pole. This induces large-scale circulation of matter, in which matter usually rises at
the pole and descends at the equator (see >Fig. 9-4). In this situation, angular momentum is
transported inward. It is however also possible for the circulation to go in the reverse direction,

In the upper hemisphere on the right section, matter is rotating counterclockwise along the outer
streamlineandclockwisealongtheinnerone.The outersphereisthestar’ssurfaceandhasaradius
equal to 5.2 R⊙. The inner sphere shows the outer boundary of the convective core, which has a
radius of 1.7 R⊙(Illustration from Meynet and Maeder 2002)
and in this second case, angular momentum is transported outward. Circulation corresponds
to an advective process, which is different from diffusion because the latter can only erode gra-
dients. Advection can either build or erode angular velocity gradients (see Maeder and Zahn
1998 for more details).
Dynamical shear occurs when the excess energy contained in differentially rotating layers
is larger then the work that needs to be done to overcome the buoyancy force. The criterion for
stability against dynamical shear instability is the Richardson criterion:
Ri =
N 
(∂U/∂z)> 
= Ric,
(9.6)
where U is the horizontal velocity, z the vertical coordinate, and N the Brunt–Väisälä
frequency.
The critical value of the Richardson criterion, Ric = /, corresponds to the situation where
the excess kinetic energy contained in the differentially rotating layers is equal to the work done
against the restoring force of the density gradient (also called buoyancy force). It is therefore
used by most authors as the limit for the occurrence of the dynamical shear. However, recent

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars 9
461
studies by Canuto (2002) show that turbulence may occur as long as Ri ≲Ric ∼. This critical
value is consistent with numerical simulations done by Brüggen and Hillebrandt (2001) where
they find shear mixing for values of Ri greater than /(up to about .).
Different dynamical shear diffusion coefficients, D, can be found in the literature. The one
used in GENEC is as follows:
D = 
vl = 

v
l l= 
r d Ω
d r Δr= 
rΔΩ Δr,
(9.7)
where r is the mean radius of the zone where the instability occurs, ΔΩ is the variation of Ω
over this zone, and Δr is the extent of the zone. The zone is the reunion of consecutive shells
where Ri < Ric (see Hirschi et al. 2004 for more details and references).
If the differential rotation is not strong enough to induce dynamical shear, it can still induce
the secular shear instability when thermal turbulence reduces the effect of the buoyancy force.
The secular shear instability occurs therefore on the thermal time scale, which is much longer
than the dynamical one. Note that the way the inhibiting effect of the molecular weight (μ) gra-
dients on secular shear is taken into account impacts strongly the efficiency of the shear. In some
work, the inhibiting effect of μ–gradients is so strong that secular shear is suppressed below a
certain threshold value of differential rotation (Heger et al. 2000). In other work (Maeder 1997),
thermal instabilities and horizontal turbulence reduce the inhibiting effect of the μ–gradients.
As a result, shear is not suppressed below a threshold value of differential rotation but only
decreased when μ–gradients are present.
There are other minor instabilities induced by rotation: the GSF instability (Goldreich and
Schubert 1967; Fricke 1968; Hirschi and Maeder 2010), the ABCD instability (Knobloch and
Spruit 1983; Heger et al. 2000), and the Solberg–Høiland instability (Kippenhahn and Weigert
1990). The GSF instability is induced by axisymmetric perturbations. The ABCD instability
is a kind of horizontal convection. Finally, Solberg–Høiland stability criterion is the criterion
that should be used instead of the Ledoux or Schwarzschild criterion in rotating stars. However,
including the dynamical shearinstabilityalsotakes intoaccount the Solberg–Høiland instability
(Hirschi et al. 2004).
Transport of Angular Momentum
For shellular rotation, the equation of transport of angular momentum (Zahn 1992) in the
vertical direction is (in lagrangian coordinates) as follows:
ρ d
dt (rΩ)Mr =

r
∂
∂r (ρrΩU(r)) + 
r
∂
∂r (ρDr∂Ω
∂r ) ,
(9.8)
where Ω(r) is the mean angular velocity at level r, U(r) the vertical component of the merid-
ional circulation velocity, and D the diffusion coefficient due to the sum of the various turbulent
diffusion processes (convection, shears, and other rotation-induced instabilities apart from
meridional circulation). Note that angular momentum is conserved in the case of contraction
or expansion. The first term on the right-hand side, corresponding to meridional circulation,
is an advective term. The second term on the right-hand side, which corresponds to the diffu-
sion processes, is a diffusive term. The correct treatment of advection is very costly numerically
because (> 9.8) is a fourth order equation (the expression of U(r) contains third order deriva-
tives of Ω, see Zahn 1992). This is why some research groups treat meridional circulation in a
diffusive way (see, e.g., Heger et al. 2000) with the risk of transporting angular momentum in
the wrong direction (in the case meridional circulation builds gradients).

Transport of Chemical Species
The transport of chemical elements is also governed by a diffusion–advection equation like
( > 9.8). However, if the horizontal component of the turbulent diffusion is large, the vertical
advection of the elements (and not that of the angular momentum) can be treated as a simple
diffusion (Chaboyer and Zahn 1992) with a diffusion coefficient Deff,
Deff = ∣rU(r) ∣
Dh

(9.9)
where Dh is the coefficient of horizontal turbulence (Zahn 1992). > Equation 9.9 expresses
that the vertical advection of chemical elements is severely inhibited by the strong horizontal
turbulence characterized by Dh. The change of the mass fraction Xi of the chemical species i is

where the second term on the right accounts for composition changes due to nuclear reactions.
The coefficient Dmix is the sum Dmix = D + Deff, where D is the term appearing in (> 9.8) and
Deff accounts for the combined effect of advection and horizontal turbulence.
Rotation and Magnetic Fields
Spectropolarimetric surveys have obtained evidence for the presence of magnetic field at the
surface of OB stars (see the recent review by Walder et al. 2011 and references therein). The
origin of these magnetic fields is still unknown. They might be fossil fields (the spectral char-
acteristics of Ofp stars are indicative of organized magnetic fields, most likely of a fossil origin)
or fields produced through a dynamo mechanism.
The central question for the evolution of massive stars is whether a dynamo is at work in
internal radiative zones. This could have far-reaching consequences concerning the mixing of
the elements and the loss of angular momentum. In particular, the interaction between rotation
and magnetic fields in the stellar interior strongly affects the angular momentumretained in the
core and thus the initial rotation rate of pulsars and which massive stars could end their lives
as long and soft gamma-ray bursters (see the discussion in Sect. 6 of Georgy et al. 2012 and
references therein).
The interplay between rotation and magnetic field has been studied in stellar evolution
calculations using the Tayler–Spruit dynamo (Spruit 2002; Maeder and Meynet 2005). Some
numerical simulations confirm the existence of a magnetic instability; however, the existence
of the dynamo is still controversial (Braithwaite 2006; Zahn et al. 2007).
The Taylor–Spruit dynamo is based on the fact that a purely toroidal field Bφ(r, ϑ), even
very weak, in a stable stratified star is unstable on an Alfvén timescale /ωA. This is the first
magnetic instability to appear. It is nonaxisymmetric of type m = (Spruit 2002), occurs under
a wide range of conditions, and is characterized by a low threshold and a short growth time. In
a rotating star, the instability is also present, however the growth rate σB of the instability is, if
ωA ≪Ω,
σB = ω
A
Ω ,
(9.11)
instead of the Alfvén frequency ωA, because the growth rate of the instability is reduced by the
Coriolis force (Spruit 2002). One usually has the following ordering of the different frequencies,

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars 9
463
N ≫Ω ≫ωA. In the Sun, one has N ≈−s−, Ω = × −s−and a field of 1 kG would
give an Alfvén frequency as low as ωA = ×−s−(where N is the Brunt–Väisälä frequency).
This theory enables us to establish the two quantities in which we are mainly interested for
stellar evolution: the magnetic viscosity ν, which expresses the mechanical coupling due to the
magnetic field ⃗B, and the magnetic diffusivity η, which expresses the transport by a magnetic
instability and thus also the damping of the instability. The parameter η also expresses the ver-
tical transport of the chemical elements and enters ( > 9.10), while the viscosity ν determines
the vertical transport of the angular momentum by the magnetic field and enters the second
term on the right-hand side of (> 9.8).
>Figure 9-5 shows the differences in the internal Ω–profiles during the evolution ofa 20 M⊙
star with and without a magnetic field created by the Tayler–Spruit dynamo. Without a mag-
netic field, the star has a significant differential rotation, while Ω is almost constant when a
magnetic field created by the dynamo is present. It is not perfectly constant, otherwise there
would be no dynamo. In fact, the rotation rapidly adjusts itself to the minimum differential
rotation necessary to sustain the dynamo. One could then assume that the mixing of chemi-
cal elements is suppressed by magnetic fields. This is, however, not the case since the interplay
between magnetic fields and the meridional circulation tend to lead to more mixing in mod-
els including magnetic fields compared to models not including magnetic fields (Maeder and
Meynet 2005). Fast-rotating models of GRB progenitors calculated by Yoon et al. (2006) also
experience a strong chemical internal mixing leading to the stars undergoing quasi-chemical
homogeneous evolution. The study of the interaction between rotation and magnetic fields
is still under development, and the next 10 years will certainly provide new insights on this
important topic.

3.1.3 Other Input Physics
The other key input physics that are essential for the computation of stellarevolution modelsare
nuclear reactions, mass loss prescriptions (discussed above), the equation of state, opacities, and
neutrino losses. Stellar evolution codes are now able to include a larger and more flexible nuclear
reaction network (see, e.g., Frischknecht et al. 2010 for a description of the implementation of
a flexible network in GENEC). Nuclear physics and other inputs are described for other codes,
for example in Paxton et al. (2011) and Chieffi et al. (1998).
3.2 Grids of Evolutionary Tracks and Stellar Populations
The evolution of a star is primarily determined by its initial mass. Rotation, metallicity, and
mass loss also play an important role for the evolution of massive stars. Before presenting the
evolution of the entire range of massive stars, we first describe the effects due to the other main
parameters: rotation, metallicity, and mass loss.
3.2.1 Impact of Rotation
As explained above, rotation affects the structure and evolution of massive stars in three ways:
hydrostatic effects, enhanced mass loss, and internal mixing of chemical elements. The last effect
is the most important. In order to see the impact of rotation-induced mixing, we can look at
the evolution of 20 M⊙models without rotation and with initial rotation velocities of 100, 200,
and 300 km s−, with 300 km s−representing the average initial rotation rate for massive stars
(Hirschi et al. 2004). The tracks of the 20 M⊙models are presented in >Fig. 9-6.
> Figure 9-6 (left) shows the evolutionary tracks of the four different 20 M⊙models in
the HR diagram. The nonrotating model ends up as a red supergiant (RSG) like the corre-
sponding model calculated by other groups (see Heger and Langer 2000; Limongi et al. 2000).
However, the rotating models show very interesting features. Although the 100 km s−model
remains a RSG, the 200 km s−model undergoes a blue loop to yellow-red supergiant, whereas
the 300 km s−model ends up as a blue supergiant (BSG). Thus, rotation may have a strong
impact on the nature of the supernova progenitor (red, blue supergiant, or even Wolf–Rayet
star) and thus on some observed characteristics of the supernova explosion.
When does a massive star evolve back to the blue after a RSG phase and why?
>Figure 9-6
(right) shows the evolution of log (Teff) versus the central helium abundance, Xc(He).
Xc(He) increases during the main sequence, then decreases during He burning, and finally is
equal to zero during the post He-burning evolution. The figure shows that:
•
For the nonrotating model, He burning starts when the star crosses the HR diagram
(log (Teff) ∼)and the staronlyreaches the RSGstage halfwaythrough He burning. Finally,
the star luminosity rises during shell He burning.
•
For the υini = km s−model, the star is more luminous and becomes a RSG before He-
burning ignition. These two factors favor higher mass-loss rates, and the star loses most
of its hydrogen envelope before He burning is finished. Thus, the star evolves toward the
zone of the HR diagram where homogeneous helium stars are found, i.e., in the blue part
of the HR diagram. We can see that the evolutionary track still evolves during shell He
burning. The higher luminosity also leads to more massive cores and rotating stars behave

as more massive nonrotating stars. As an example, a 20 M⊙rotating stars will have core
masses similar to a nonrotating stars with an initial mass roughly equal to 25 M⊙. On the
other hand, rotation-induced mixing enhances the total lifetime of stars.
•
The 100 km s−model luminosity is lower than for the 300 km s−model, and therefore
less mass is lost during He burning and the burning ends before the hydrogen envelope
is removed. The star therefore remains a RSG. The 200 km s−model evolution is similar to
the 300 km s−model, but the extent of its blue loop is smaller. At the end of He burning
for the 200 km s−model, log (Teff) = .and the star becomes redder before C burning
starts.
Although the models discussed here are for solar metallicity, one can note that the behav-
iors of the models with υini between 200 and 300 km s−are reminiscent of the evolution of the
progenitor of SN1987A. Let us recall that this supernova had a blue progenitor which evolved
from a RSG stage (see, e.g., the review by Arnett et al. 1989). In >Fig. 9-6, we also indicate the
position of the progenitor of SN 1993J. SN 1993J probably belongs to a binary system (Podsi-
adlowski et al. 1993). Nevertheless, it has common properties with our υini = 200 km s−20 M⊙
model: the stellar model and the progenitor of SN 1993J have approximately the same metallic-
ity, they have a similar position in the HR diagram taking into account the uncertainties, and
they both have a small hydrogen rich envelope, making possible a change from type II to type
Ib some time after the explosion.
Rotation-induced mixing also brings H-burning products from the core to the surface of
the star, whereas in nonrotating models no enrichment takes place before the star reaches the
RSG stage. In particular, rotating models predict a surface enrichment in nitrogen and helium.
Rotation-induced mixing is questioned by recent observational campaigns (see e.g., Hunter
et al. 2007), but the evidence is not yet conclusive and more work is required on this topic.

466 9
The Evolution of High-Mass Stars
The enrichment in elements like nitrogen is accompanied by the depletion of fragile elements
like boron. Although observations of boron are a challenging task, combining constraints from
both nitrogen enhancements and boron depletion will help improve models in the future. This
point is further discussed in >Sect. 4.1.
3.2.2 Impact of Mass Loss
The luminosity, L, of a star increases faster than its mass, M. For stars less massive than about
20 M⊙, L ∝Mand for more massive stars, the relationship reduces to L ∝M for the most
massive stars. The much higher luminosity of massive stars leads to strong radiation driven
winds, which peel off the stars during its life.
>Figure 9-7 compares the final versus initial mass relations. Apart from stars with masses
less than 15 M⊙, we see that the final mass is significantly lower than the initial mass demon-
strating the importance of mass loss for massive stars.
3.2.3 Impact of Metallicity
The effects of low metallicity on the evolution of massive stars are the following. A lower
metallicity implies a lower luminosity which leads to slightly smaller convective cores. A lower
metallicity implies lower opacity and lower mass losses (as long as the chemical composition has

hypothetical case without mass loss (Mﬁn = Mini) (Figure taken from Ekström et al. 2012)

not been changed by burning or mixing in the part of the star one considers). Thus, at the start
of the evolution, lower metallicity stars are more compact. This can be seen in the Hertzsprung–
Russell (HR) diagram (>Fig. 9-8) where the lower metallicity models have bluer tracks during
the main sequence. The lower metallicity modelsalso have a harder time reaching the red super-
giant (RSG) stage. The nonrotating model at Z = −becomes a RSG only during shell He
burning, and the lower metallicity nonrotating models never reach the RSG stage. As long as
the metallicityis above about Z = −, noothersignificant differences have been found in non-
rotating models. Below this metallicity and for metal-free stars, the CNO cycle cannot operate
at the start of H burning. At the end of its formation, the star therefore contracts until it starts
He burning because the pp chains cannot balance the effect of the gravitational force. Once
enough carbon and oxygen are produced, the CNO cycle can operate and the star behaves like
stars with Z > −for the rest of the main sequence. Shell H burning still differs between
Z > −and metal-free stars.
Mass-loss rates generally depend on the metallicity of the star so we expect low Z stars
to lose less mass than solar Z stars. This is especially the case for the wind of hot stars (O-
type and WR stars, see, e.g., Vink et al. 2001). However, winds of cool stars (LBV and RSG)
might not have such a strong metallicity dependence. There might be other phenomena leading
to mass loss. In rotating stars, if the mass loss is small, angular momentum loss is also small
and this angular momentum can accumulate near the surface of the star. Stars may thus rotate
critically after some time, meaning that the centrifugal force balances gravity at the equator.
Such phenomenon may cause low Z stars to lose significant amount of mass (Hirschi 2007),
and it is important to better understand mass loss and its metallicity dependence in order to
better predict the evolution of massive stars.

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars
3.2.4 Grids of Models and Stellar Populations
Now that we have discussed the impact of the individual key parameters affecting the evolu-
tion of massive stars, let us describe the general evolution as a function of initial mass at solar
metallicity.
Evolutionary tracks for a large grid of rotating models with masses ranging from 0.8 to
120 M⊙(Ekström et al. 2012) are presented in >Fig. 9-9 (see Brott et al. 2011 for another grid
of main-sequence models). Globally, for massive stars (M > M⊙), we can split stars in three
mass ranges.
–
For M ≳M⊙: the high mass-loss rates remove enough mass so that stars lose their
envelopes on the main-sequence or in the blue supergiant stage as LBVs. The stars never
become red supergiants. Stars in this mass range may die as type Ib or Ic supernovae leaving
a black hole as a remnant or collapse to a black hole without any supernova depending on
the energy of the supernova engine.
–
For M⊙≳M ≳M⊙: stars only lose a fraction of their envelopes on the main sequence.
They further evolve to the red supergiant stage, where mass loss is sufficient to remove their
envelope. They become bare cores and are observed as WR stars. Stars in this mass range
probably die as SNIb (SNIc) leaving a black hole as a remnant or, as their more massive
counterparts collapse to a black hole without undergoing a supernova.
–
For M ≲M⊙: the stars still experience mass loss; however, it is not sufficient to alter
the global evolution. The mass loss and rotation may nevertheless still modify the lifetimes
and the chemical compositions. Stars in this mass range die as SN II (IIL or IIP) and form
a neutron star.
The mass limits are uncertain and depend on metallicity Z. At different Z, some sequences
may be absent. The last stage indicated before supernovae (SN) are usually reached near the
end of central He burning. After this stage, the stellar envelopes do not evolve further and their
properties determine the nature of the SN progenitors.

Observation Confronts Theory
There are manyobservational tests that can allow us toconstrain stellarevolution models. In this
chapter, we focus on the surface abundances in massive main-sequence stars, the properties and
number of stars in the different post-main-sequence evolutionary stages (e.g., RSG and WR),
and the fate of stars. To begin, let us summarize the evolutionary paths taken by single stars in
various mass ranges with solar metallicity. Meynet et al. (2011) propose the following scenario:
M > 90 M⊙: O – Of – WNL – (WNE) – WCL – WCE – SN(SNIbc/BH/SNIIn)? (PCSN/
Hypernova)
60–90 M⊙: O – Of/WNL⇔LBV – WNL(H poor) – WCL-E – SN (SNIbc/BH/SNIIn)?
40–60 M⊙: O – BSG – LBV ⇔WNL – (WNE) – WCL-E – SN (SNIb)
– WCL-E – WO – SN (SNIc)
30–40 M⊙: O – BSG – RSG – WNE – WCE – SN (SNIb)
OH/IR ⇔LBV ?
20–30 M⊙: O –(BSG)– RSG – BSG (blue loop) – RSG – SN (SNIIb, SNIIL)
10–20 M⊙: O – RSG – (Cepheid loop, M < M⊙) – RSG – SN (SNIIP)

The arrows ⇔indicate that the star moves back and forth motions between the two stages.
The paths and sequences depend on metallicity, Z, and rotation.
We can classify the different scenarios in three families: below about 30 M⊙, massive stars
pass through a red supergiant stage; above about 40 M⊙, stars go through an LBV and WR
phase; and in the intermediate mass range, between 30 and 40M⊙, stars can possibly go through
the three phases, RSG, LBV, and WR.
4.1 Surface Abundance of Light Elements in Massive Stars
Observations of light element abundance in main-sequence stars can test the treatment of trans-
port of angular momentum and chemical species inside stellar models.Indeed, internal mixing,
in particular due to rotation, predicts that the surface composition should be enhanced in N
and He if mixing takes place in the radiative layer between the convective core and the surface
of a massive star. New observational data of late O- and B-type stars from the VLT-FLAMES
survey (Evans et al. 2005, 2006; Hunter et al. 2007; Trundle et al. 2007) lead to an intense dis-
cussion about how well the models with rotation can explain the observed nitrogen surface
abundances (Hunter et al. 2008, 2009; Maeder et al. 2009) and about whether or not binaries
are necessary to explain some groups of the observed O- and B-type stars (Langer et al. 2008).
Light elements and in particular boron can constrain the mixing induced by rotation and help
distinguish between single stars and interacting binaries (Brott et al. 2009). Boron is destroyed
at relatively low temperatures (≈× K) where the CNO cycles are not yet efficient. There-
fore, modest mixing due to rotation leads to a depletion of light elements at the surface without
considerable nitrogen enrichment. This effect can not be explained by mass transfer in a binary
system, since there, the accreted material is depleted in boron and enriched in nitrogen (Fliegner
et al. 1996).
Boron is produced in spallation process of CNO atoms in the interstellar medium (ISM) by
galactic cosmic rays. In massive stars, boron is only destroyed. It is the only light element out of
Li, Be, and B which is observed at the surface of OB stars. Despite the difficulties of measuring
boron surface abundances, an increasing number of boron abundances from O- and early B-
type stars have recentlybeen published (Mendel et al. 2006; Venn et al. 2002; Proffitt and Quigley
2001; Proffitt et al. 1999). The comparison in Mendel et al. (2006) of observational data with the
models of Heger and Langer (2000) shows a good agreement with the exception of three stars
(HD 30836, HD 36591, HD205021). The strong boron depletion in these young stars raises
the question if the efficiency of surface mixing due to rotation is stronger or if there are other
mixing processes at work. We reexamined this question because the Geneva stellar evolution
code GENEC includes the effect of rotation in a different way compared with the codes used
in previous works. The most important difference comes from the fact that in GENEC, the
transport of the angular momentum is properly accounted for as an advection process and not
as a diffusion process.
>Figure 9-10 shows the observations of the B/H versus N/C ratio, as well as the evolution-
ary tracks of rotating models calculated with the Geneva code (see Frischknecht et al. 2010 for
details). This diagram tests whether the concomitant changes of boron and nitrogen are repro-
duced by the rotating stellar models. In >Fig. 9-10a, we plotted models with υini/υcrit = .
to show the typical B-N/C relation. We see that these models could explain a large fraction
of the observations, but they correspond to an average velocity on the main sequence of about
180 km s−, while the observational sample mainly consists of slow rotators (υ sin i ≤50 km s−).
On the other hand, in panel b of >Fig. 9-10, models with lower velocities are shown. We see

show the possible spread in main-sequence evolution. The labeled stars correspond to objects
that challenge the present theoretical predictions (see Frischknecht et al. 2010 for details and
references)
that they would provide a good fit to the points with boron abundances between 0.9 and 1.5
and N/C ratios of the order of −.. These models have difficulty explaining stars that are more
depleted in boron and more enriched in nitrogen.
The two stars 7 and 16 (see >Fig. 9-10) present no or little surface nitrogen enrichment
and are strongly boron depleted. The range of values spanned by the different initial mass and
initial velocity models barely explain these values therefore, these stars challenge rotating stel-
lar models even though the difference in N/C is within 2σ of the models at the upper limit.
These two stars were also found to be a problem for single-star models by other authors (Morel
et al. 2008; Mendel et al. 2006; Venn et al. 2002). At this stage, it is also interesting to note that
star 7, which cannot be reproduced by these models, is a spectroscopic binary with a period
of 9.5 days (Pourbaix et al. 2004), so it might well be that this star was slowed down by spin-
orbit coupling in the course of its main-sequence evolution. Such a braking mechanism would
also slow down or even stop the N-enrichment process. Apart from these few difficult cases,
the above comparisons are very encouraging on the whole and support the predictions of the
rotating models.
The impact of rotation-induced mixing becomes stronger as the initial metallicity (Z) of
the star decreases. This is particularly true for the abundance of so-called secondary elements
like nitrogen. Secondary elements are produced from elements present in the cloud out of
which the star formed. In the case of nitrogen, it is produced at the expense of carbon and
oxygen in the CNO cycle. The production of secondary elements is proportional to the initial
metallicity, and thus at very low Z, their production becomes negligible. In rotating models,
however, rotation induces the mixing of carbon and oxygen from the helium-burning core to
the hydrogen-burning shell, thus enabling a primaryproduction of nitrogen (Meynet et al.2006;
Hirschi 2007). When yields from these rotating models are used as input in chemical evolution

472 9
The Evolution of High-Mass Stars
models, a nice fit of the N/O in very metal poor halo stars (see Spite et al. 2005) is obtained
(Chiappini et al. 2006). This provides a strong support for the occurrence of rotation-induced
mixing at low Z and for our models. The primary nitrogen production in rotating low-Z stel-
lar models is accompanied by the primary production of other isotopes like C, and especially
Ne, which is the neutron source for s-process in massive stars (e.g. Käppeler et al. 2011 and
references therein). Frischknecht et al. (2012) have calculated full stellar evolution models
including the effects of rotation and a large nuclear reaction network and found that rotation
boosts the s-process at low Z. The s-process in rotating massive stars thus contributes signifi-
cantlytothe production ofelements uptostrontium above [Fe/H] ≃−2, the main limiting factor
being the iron seeds at low Z. The production of elements up to barium is sensitive to the initial
rotation rate, and we generally obtain [Sr/Ba] > 0 for the massive low-Z rotating stars. Finally,
rotation-induced mixing is the key ingredient in progenitor models of long and soft gamma-ray
bursts that undergo quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution (Yoon et al. 2006).
4.2 The Be Stars
It has been 145 years since the first Be star was discovered,9 but there is still no good explanation
for the mass loss, disk formation, and variability in these stars. Following a paper by Townsend
et al. (2004), there has been renewed interest in the possibility that Be stars could be rotating
at their critical velocities, a central idea put forth by Struve (1931) in a model that prevailed
until the 1980s when new spacecraft and ground-based observations revealed that the Be phe-
nomenon is quite complex and offered no evidence for critical rotation (see the review by Porter
and Rivinius 2003 for background on the classical Be stars). Challenges to Townsend et al. have
been swift and two recent papers critically examining the effect of gravity darkening on B star
parameters (Frémat et al. 2005) and a statistical investigation (Cranmer 2005) again bring the
expected maximum V/Vcr for Be stars back to the previous consensus value of ≲0.90.
Abundance studies can provide a good independent test for critical rotation in Be stars. As
discussed above, stellar evolution models by Maeder and Meynet (2000b) and Heger and Langer
(2000) predict a significant enhancement in the photospheric N abundances in very rapidly
rotating OB stars due to mixing of CNO-processed material from their interiors. The higher the
rotation, the more mixing. But the analyses of Be star spectra using standard spectrum synthesis
techniques are confronted with some challenges that are not encountered in abundance studies
of sharp-lined, nonemission B stars, including the treatment of blended, rotationally broad-
ened lines and correction for disk emission and possible shell absorption (which is a major
problem in the analysis of optical spectra). The FUV spectral region is an ideal place to look
for N enhancement and C depletion in the photospheres of early Be stars as it contains many
strong lines of C II, C III, N II, and N III that are prominent even if the star’s projected rotational
velocity (V sin i) is large or the abundances are low.
FUV spectra of early Be stars obtained with the IUE spacecraft have recently been analyzed
with the Hubeny/Lanz NLTE codes TLUSTY/SYNSPEC(Hubeny1988; Hubenyand Lanz 1995)
and the Lanz and Hubeny (2007) model atmospheres for B stars (Peters 2011). Results from two
stars are presented in >Fig. 9-11. Nitrogen enrichment in the B2 stars would be revealed by a
stronger N I at λ1243Å , while in objects hotter than B1, the N III doublet at λλ1183.0,1184.5 Å
would be prominent. From the spectra shown in >Fig. 9-11 it is clear that the presence of an
9γ Cas, (Sechhi 1867).

analysis lines are labeled at the top (from Peters 2011)
elevated nitrogen abundance is not indicated.10 In fact, often the observed nitrogen lines are
weaker than predicted even if solar abundances prevail. The error in the N abundance is about
0.3–0.4 dex. Given the errors, it appears that the N abundance in the Be stars is normal or at
most enhanced by a factor of 2–3. None of the program Be stars show clear evidence for an
elevated nitrogen abundance. The expected mixing is apparently suppressed. Either the models
need improvement or more likely this study supports the results from Frémat et al. and Cranmer
mentioned above that Be stars are not critical rotators.
4.3 Post-Main-Sequence Evolution
As outlined in >Sect. 1 at the end of hydrogen burning, there is no more fuel to compensate
for gravity and the energy losses due to radiation. The core of the star thus contracts until the
temperature is high enough to ignite helium in the center. As gravitational energy is suddenly
released in this contraction, the envelope is forced to expand until the star becomes transparent
10The carbon lines were typically weaker than those computed with the Lanz–Hubeny model atmospheres and
solar abundances. This could mean a reduced carbon abundance or emission filling from the circumstellar
disk.

474 9
The Evolution of High-Mass Stars
enough to let this additional energy escape from the star and enter the blue or red supergiant
stage. The end of hydrogen burning thus induces a significant change in the position of stars in
the HR diagram and leads to the gap between the main sequence and giants, clearly marking
the end of the main sequence. The width of the main sequence in the HR diagram depends
on the convective core boundary and overshooting beyond the strict Schwarzschild limit that is
usually fixed in stellar evolution models in order to reproduce the observed width of the main
sequence (see, e.g., Ekström et al. 2012).
4.3.1 Blue and Red Supergiants
In the same way that the main-sequence width tests convective core overshooting, the position
of stars in the red (super-)giant phase tests the treatment of convection in the envelope of stars.
The outer convective zone is usually treated according to the mixing length theory, with a solar
calibrated value for the mixing-length parameter of the low-mass stars (αMLT ≡ℓ/HP = .
in GENEC, where ℓis the mixing length and Hp is the pressure scale height). For more massive
stars (M > .M⊙) the difference in the equation of state implies a slightly lower value for this
parameter (αMLT = .in GENEC). In >Fig. 9-12, we see that rotating models calculated with
GENEC using these values well reproduce the positions of the red giant branch and of the red
supergiants, supporting the choices made for the value of the mixing length.
If a star becomes a red supergiant at the very beginning of the core He-burning phase, its
red supergiant lifetime will be longer than the one of a star that begins to transform its cen-
tral helium in the blue part of the HR diagram and thus enters its red supergiant phase in a
more advanced evolutionary stage. Thus, red supergiant lifetimes depend on the way the star
evolves into the red part of the HR diagram after the main-sequence phase. This redward evo-
lution depends in turn on the extension of the intermediate convective zone associated with the
H-burning shell. Let us recall that in a convective zone the density gradients are shallower. As a
consequence, the larger the intermediate convective zone, the more compact the star and thus
a blue position in the HR diagram is favored. Alternatively, when this intermediate convective
zone decreases in mass or even disappears, this favors the inflation of the star and a rapid evolu-
tion into the red part of the HR diagram. Mass loss (see Meynet 1993) and (rotational) mixing
(Maeder and Meynet 2001) both reduce the extension of the intermediate convective zone and
therefore favor an early entrance into the RSG stage during the core He-burning phase.
Let us illustrate this by looking at >Fig. 9-13, where the structures of solar metallicity mod-
els for two 20 M⊙stars are shown. The models show the presence of an intermediate convective
zone associated with the H-burning shell at the beginning of the core He-burning phase. This
intermediate convective zone remains present for a much longer period in the nonrotating
model than in the rotating one. Also, the total mass of the nonrotating model is slightly larger
than the total mass of the rotating one at the same stage. One expects thus that, at the end of the
main-sequence phase, the nonrotating model will cross the HR gap more slowly. This is exactly
what happens as can be seen in >Fig. 9-6.
More important but similar effects are observed in metal poor models. It has been shown
by Maeder and Meynet (2001) that rotation may be the reason for the large number of RSGs
observed in the SMC cluster NGC 330. Also, rotation may be a key ingredient for explaining the
B/R ratio estimated in the galaxy Sextans A from HST imaging by Dohm-Palmer and Skillman
(2002). They find that even if the nonrotating stellar models of Schaller et al. (1992) reproduce
well the shape of the variation of the B/R ratio as a function of age, the observed ratio is lower

clusters and associations as given in Maeder and Meynet (1989) as well as the position of Galactic
red supergiants obtained by Levesque et al. (2005, red circles)
than the model by a factor 2. Rotating models such as those presented in Maeder and Meynet
(2001) allow one to reproduce the observed value. The link between rotation and red supergiant
is also indirectly supported by the observed positive correlation between the population of Be
stars and the RSG populations (see Fig. 1b in Meynet et al. 2007).
Once a red supergiant, the star can remain in this state until it explodes in a type IIP core
collapse supernova. But it is not necessarily the case. The star can also evolve back to the blue
part of the HR diagram and end its life as a blue supergiant or even, in some probably rare cases
(see below), as a Wolf–Rayet star. The important factor governing the blueward evolution from
the red supergiant stage is the mass fraction occupied by the helium core (Giannone 1967).
Typically, when the mass fraction of the He core becomes greater than about 60–70% of the
total actual mass, the star evolves back to the blue part of the HR diagram. This is what happens
in the rotating 20 M⊙stellar model with υini = 300 km s−, in which the core He-burning core

20 M⊙models (Plots taken from Hirschi et al. (2004))
occupies more than 65% of the total mass. The nonrotating model has a core that occupies only
about 25% of the total mass and remains in the red part of the HR diagram.
As it was the case for the first crossing of the HR gap, this second crossing of the HR diagram
depends on mass loss (during the red supergiant stage) and mixing (during the previous evolu-
tionary phases). Strong mass loss during the red supergiant phase favors a blueward evolution
(Salasnich et al. 1999; Vanbeveren et al. 2007; Yoon and Cantiello 2010) since it makes the mass
fraction of the core larger. Strong mixing during the previous phases also makes larger cores
and thus favors an evolution from the red to the blue supergiant phase (Hirschi et al. 2004).
Thus, we see that the lifetime of the star in the red supergiant stage, as well as the possibility for
the star to explode as a type II SN in that stage, depends heavily on mass loss and mixing.
Let us now recall a few observations which are relevant in that context:
•
The number ratio of blue to red supergiants in clusters with ages between 6.8 and 7.2
(in logarithm of the age in years), or with masses at the turn off between about 12 and
30 M⊙, increases when the metallicity increases (Meylan and Maeder 1983; Eggenberger
et al. 2002). This observed trend is exactly the opposite of what is expected from standard
grids of models (see the discussion in Langer and Maeder 1995).
•
An important number ratio is the relative number of RSGs to WRs. Massey (2003, see his
Fig. 12) shows that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity by a factor of 100 over
a range of 0.9 dex in metallicity. The strong decrease with the metallicity indicates that the
mass range for the progenitors of WRs (RSGs) increases (decreases) when the metallicity
increases.

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars 9
477
These two important features emphasize the importance of metallicity in shaping the blue and
red supergiants and Wolf–Rayet populations. Mass loss triggered by radiation increases with the
metallicity (Kudritzki and Puls 2000), and this is probably one of the main factors responsible
for the above observed trends. For instance, when the metallicity increases, stars enter at an
earlier phase into the WR phase (making the duration of that phase longer). Also, stars of lower
initial masses can become WR at the end of their lifetime. These two factors are exactly what is
required to explain the trend of the relative number of RSGs and WRs with metallicity.
For the B/R ratio however, this is not the case! Indeed, when the metallicity increases, mass-
loss rates increase at least during the main-sequence phase, and thus, RSGs are favored at high
metallicity, which is the contrary of what is observed. Thus, the increase of the mass-loss rate
with the metallicity, expected for hot stars, cannot be the cause of the observed B/R trend. This
is in fact a counteracting effect.
Now, we have mentioned that an increase of the mass-loss rates during the RSG phase would
shorten the RSGs lifeftime and lead to the formation of a blue supergiant, or even a WR star
in some cases. At the moment, mass-loss rates used in current stellar models (de Jager et al.
1988) are too weak for producing this kind of evolution for stars in the mass range between 12
and 25–30 M⊙(at least for standard nonrotating models). However, the uncertainties are large;
actually, the determinations of the mass loss during the RSG phase is still more difficult than in
the blue part of the HR diagram due in part to the presence of dust and to various instabilities
active in red supergiant atmospheres (e.g., convection becomes supersonic and turbulent pres-
sure can no longer be ignored). An illustration of the difficulty comes from the determinations
of red supergiant mass-loss rates by van Loon et al. (2005). Their study is based on the anal-
ysis of optical spectra of a sample of dust-enshrouded red giants in the LMC, complemented
with spectroscopic and infrared photometric data from the literature. Comparison with galac-
tic AGB stars and red supergiants shows excellent agreement for dust-enshrouded objects, but
not for optically bright ones. Dust-enshrouded objects show mass-loss rates which are greater
by a factor 3–50 than those deduced from optically bright ones! In this context, the questions
of which stars do become dust enshrouded, at which stage, and for how long, become critical
to make correct prediction of the mass lost by stellar winds. One can also note a very interest-
ing point deduced from the study by van Loon et al. (2005), that for dust-enshrouded objects,
mass loss appears to be independent of the metallicity! On the other hand, the formation and
duration of the dust enshrouded stage may be metallicity dependent! Thus, one sees here that
improvements are needed in order to clarify the situation. Let us just mention that stronger
mass loss at high metallicity during the red supergiant phase would go in the right direction
for explaining the observed B/R trend with metallicity. Indeed, an increase of the mass-loss rate
during the red supergiant phase at high Z favors blueward evolution and thus reduces the RSG
lifetimes (see Meynet et al. 2011 for additional details).
In the models of Schaller et al. (1992), the ratio of the blue to the red lifetime (red being
defined as the time spent with log(Teff) below 3.65) for the 20 M⊙is 0.2, while for the non-
rotating and rotating model of Ekström et al. (2012) it is 0.7 and 1.5, respectively. The same
numbers for the 25 M⊙models are 0.10 in Schaller et al. (1992), and 1.6 (nonrotating) and 5.3
(rotating) in Ekström et al. (2012). Thus, in that mass range, the B/R ratio is greatly enhanced.
Whether it is sufficient to explain the B/R ratio as observed in clusters remains to be checked.
Note that at solar metallicity, the observational values estimated by Eggenberger et al. (2002)
are between 1.2 and 4, well in agreement with the 20–25 M⊙rotating models from Ekström
et al. (2012).

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars
Recent studies of the red and yellow supergiants identified in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(Neugent et al. 2012) and M33 (Drout et al. 2012) show excellent agreement between their
locations in the HRD and the newest evolutionary tracks from the Geneva group. Finally, if
mass loss during the red supergiant phase is strong enough to remove the entire hydrogen-rich
envelope, the star becomes a Wolf–Rayet star. As can be seen in >Fig. 9-12, both the models
of Ekström et al. (2012) and the observations of Levesque et al. (2005) agree on an upper mass
limit for red supergiants around 25 M⊙. Above this limit, mass loss is strong enough to prevent
the star from reaching the red supergiant phase.
4.3.2 Wolf–Rayet (WR) Stars
Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars (see >Sect. 2.2) are characterized by four important observed features:
1. They are associated with young massive star regions.
2. They present broad and strong emission lines.
3. They are hot (log(Teff) ≳) and luminous stars (log(L/L⊙) > .).
4. The chemical composition of their surface shows signs of H-burning (WN-type) and/or
He-burning processes (WNC, WC, WO-type).
These features can well be explained if WR are massive evolved stars whose surface composition
has been changed by mass loss and/or internal mixing. The mass loss can be due either to stellar
winds and/or to the loss of the envelope through a Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) in a close-
binary system.
In order to compare models to observations, a classification of stellar models based on a
synthetic model atmosphere spectrum would be the best method. While some attempts in that
direction have already been made (Schaerer and de Koter 1997), this is by far not yet a standard
procedure. Instead, the following criteria to determine the type of the star at a given time are
commonly used (Meynet and Maeder 2003):
•
A stellar model with log(Teff) > .and a surface hydrogen mass fraction XH < .is
considered as a WR star.11
•
A stellar model with log(Teff) > .which is not a WR star is an O-type star.
•
A WR stellar model with a surface hydrogen mass fraction XH > −is a WNL star.
•
A WR stellar model without hydrogen and with a carbon surface abundance inferior to the
nitrogen abundance is a WNE star.
•
A WR stellar model without hydrogen and with a carbon surface abundance superior to the
nitrogen abundance is a WC or a WO star. If the surface ratio C+O
He (in number) is less than
one, the star is classified as a WC; otherwise, it is classified as a WO.
•
A WR stellar model without hydrogen and with surface abundances in nitrogen and carbon
such as .< XC
XN < is a WNC star.
The O-type, WNL, WNE, WC, and WO phases are exclusive. The WNC phase lies between both
the WNE and WC phases.
11The duration of the corresponding WR phase is not very sensitive to the choice of this limit if it remains in
the range 0.3–0.4 as mentioned by Meynet and Maeder (2003).

Evolutionary tracks of rotating models calculated by Georgy et al. (2012) are superposed
Georgy et al. (2012) have compared the observed position of some galactic WN (Hamann
et al. 2006) and WC (Sander et al. 2012) stars with rotating single-star models (see >Fig. 9-14).
The luminosity of the most luminous WNL star in the sample of Hamann et al. (2006) (not
shown in >Fig. 9-14) would require an initial mass of the order of 300 M⊙. Crowther et al.
(2010) have recently claimed to have observed such massive objects. However, WR 25 (or HD
93162), the most luminous star, is a binary star with a spectroscopically determined orbital
period of .d (Raassen et al. 2003). The second most luminous star, WR 22, is an eclipsing
binary. Rauw et al. (1996) estimated a lower limit for the actual mass for this star to be 72 M⊙.
Due to their binary status, these two stars are not plotted in >Fig. 9-14. Looking at >Fig. 9-14,
a few points deserve to be emphasized:
•
The WNL, WNE, and WC present some kind of decreasing luminosity sequence. There
are of course overlaps between the different WR types; however, just by eye one can notice
immediately from >Fig. 9-14 that the averaged luminosity of each class decreases from the
WNL to the WC stars. The WR stars with the highest luminosity are thus the WNL stars
(the three upper points are also those with the highest abundances in hydrogen, with values
between 0.35 and 0.53), and the star with the lowest luminosity is a WC star.
•
The range of effective temperatures (taken here at the surface of the hydrostatic core, i.e.,
not accounting for the optical thickness of the wind) of the WNL stars is relatively narrow
(between 4.6 and 4.8) above a luminosity equal to about 5.8. Below, it widens and extends
from 4.6 up to slightly more than 5.

480 9
The Evolution of High-Mass Stars
•
The ranges of effective temperatures covered by the WNE and WC are similar and extend
toward higher temperatures than the range of WNL stars. The difference in temperature
ranges between the H-rich and the H-poor stars reflects the strong dependency of the
opacity on the quantity of hydrogen.
Before comparing these observations with the evolutionary tracks, let us try to explain the
observed features listed above in a general theoretical framework. We focus here on the lumi-
nosity leaving aside the question of the effective temperature. The reason for that is that the
effective temperature depends considerably on the mass-loss rate used and on the physics of
the outer layers, while luminosity is quite tightly related to the total mass of the star and its
internal physics. In that respect, it is a more fundamental quantity to compare with models for
the interior of stars.
The decrease in luminosity when passing from the WNL to the WC stars might be inter-
preted in two ways. To obtain a WC star from a given initial mass star, the star must lose more
mass than what is required to obtain a WNL star, implying that on average WC stars have lower
actual masses and thus also lower luminosities. Another way to interpret this feature (although
not incompatible with the previous one) would be to assume that the most massive stars pro-
duce the high-luminosity WNL stars (which will then evolve into lower-luminosity WNE and
WC type stars), while the less massive stars produce the WC stars. In the framework of the
single-star scenario, this last explanation requires very strong mass loss during the RSG phase
of stars with initial masses around M⊙. Such high mass loss could be due either to some
physical processes originating in the envelope of the RSGs, while in the binary channel, it could
be due to a RLOF process occurring in a close-binary system. Whatever process is invoked, it
should not produce any long WNL or WNE phases at such a low luminosity range since these
stars are not observed.
Comparing the above observed positions with the rotating single star models we note the
following features:
•
The group of 7 very luminous stars (log(L/L⊙) ≥.) all have a mass fraction of hydro-
gen superior to 10%, except in one case where the mass fraction is estimated to be 0.05. In
addition, no WNE and WC are observed in the luminosity range covered by these stars.
Is there any explanation for these two features? The reason why only H-rich WN stars are
observed in this high luminosity range gives support to the idea that WR stars form through
a combination of mass loss and radiative-zone mixing, rather than only through mass loss
as in the nonrotating models. Models without rotation or lower initial mass models, which
enter into the WR phase only after the end of the main-sequence phase, do not show any
long “H-rich” periods and thus cannot account for the most luminous H-rich WNL stars.
The absence of WNE and WC stars in this luminosity range may be explained by the fact,
already mentioned above, that WNE and WC stars are expected to be less massive and
therefore less luminous than WNL stars because more mass has to be removed from the
star to reach those stages and/or because they are produced from stars with lower initial
masses.
•
>Figure 9-14 shows that the evolutionary tracks cover the region where the WNL stars are
observed. The extension in luminosity of the WNE stars is also well reproduced, somewhat
supporting the present single-star models for explaining these populations.
•
A serious difficulty comes from the low observed luminosity of some WC stars. Our present
tracks predict a lower luminosity limit for the WC stars of 5.35 (in log(L/L⊙)), while the
lowest luminosity plotted in > Fig. 9-14 is around 4.9 according to the revised spectral

The Evolution of High-Mass Stars 9

analyses of galactic WC stars by Sander et al. (2012). The three most likely scenarios to
explain the observed low-luminosity (and thus low-mass) WC stars are the following:
–
Stars with initial masses between and M⊙lose much more mass than in the models
during their RSG stage.
–
Stars with initial masses above about M⊙lose much more mass than in the models
during the WR stage.
–
The low-mass WC stars are produced in close-binary systems through RLOF. This pro-
cess can indeed produce smaller final masses as illustrated, for instance, by the recent
models of Yoon et al. (2010).
4.4 Modeling Uncertainties and Fate of Massive Stars
As discussed above, many observed features of massive stars are reproduced by models of rotat-
ing stars. There are, however, several uncertainties and issues that require more work. A major
uncertainty is mixing at convective boundaries. 3D simulations are necessary to improve on
current treatment based on the mixing-length theory of Böhm-Vitense (1958) and reduce this
uncertainty that can affect possible shell overlaps in the advanced stages. Arnett and Meakin
have started this challenging task with promising developments (Arnett and Meakin 2011;
Meakin and Arnett 2007). Another major question is the exact role of binarity in the evolution
and fate of massive stars. As mentioned above, binary stars are one of the most likely origins for
the low-luminosity WC stars. Finally, the interaction between rotation and magnetic field is still
debated and not fully understood (see >Sect. 3.1.2). This interaction is the key to determine
the final angular momentum in the collapsing core of massive stars and the role of rotation and
magnetic fields in core collapse supernovae. Without magnetic fields, current rotating models
predict presupernova cores that rotate too fast (Hirschi et al. 2005). Models including the effects
of magnetic fields rotate slower but still faster than long period pulsars and especially still rotate
too fast compared to observed white dwarfs (Suijs et al. 2008). The reader is referred to Georgy
et al. (2012) for an extended comparison between predicted and observed fate of massive stars.
Stellarevolution is an established field but there are still majoropen questions, uncertainties,
and issues that need to be addressed. In the last few decades, the implementation of the physics
of rotation into stellar evolution models has greatly improved the model predictions, and the lat-
est modelscan much better reproduce many observables: surface enrichment of main-sequence
stars, number ratios, and properties of red, yellow, and blue supergiants as well as Wolf–Rayet
stars. There are nevertheless still many improvements needed for our understanding of mas-
sive stars in the following areas: mass loss in the LBV phase and cool stars, interaction between
rotation and magnetic fields, multi-D effects associated with convective boundary mixing, and
binary interactions. The field of stellar evolution is thus expected to remain an exciting and
evolving field for years to come.

Abstract:
The atmospheres of late-type stars are site of strong magnetic fields responsible for
their nonradiative heating. The stellar magnetic activity phenomena are in many cases anal-
ogous to those observed on the Sun, but very different scenarios from the solar case are also
observed. Magnetic fields drive hot plasma upward, where it radiates in faculae and plages,
leaving dark spots in the photosphere at the foot points of the flux tubes. Occasionally, mag-
netic fields reconnect and produce magnetic free energy and particles, in form of flares, and
coronal mass ejections. Avalanches of low-energy flares – nanoflares – are considered the most
viable sources of heating and sustaining of the outer atmospheric layers: chromosphere, tran-
sition region, and corona. Magnetic activity is produced by some form of dynamo at work in
the stellar interior, whose basic ingredient is the coexistence of a convective zone under the
stellar surface and the presence of a differential rotation regime. The whole magnetic activity
phenomenology is highly variable in time. Active regions grow and evolve in days to weeks,
but are also site of transient phenomena – e.g., flares – evolving on time scales of few seconds
to several hours. The global level of magnetic activity changes in time following cycles as it
happens for the Sun and decreases with age. The time scale of stellar variability, the amount
of involved energy, and the quality of the involved photons are the key observables that can
be used as tools for understanding the observed phenomena. This chapter is dedicated to the
illustration of the main diagnostics for stellar activity, the characteristics of active regions, and
the properties of the chromospheres, transition regions, coronae, flares, and solar-like stellar
winds. Finally, we discuss how stellar activity affects exoplanets detection and characteriza-
tion and the impact of stellar magnetic activity in the formation and evolution of planetary
atmospheres.

Stellar Activity

Introduction
Stellar activity is a collective name used to group the variability phenomena observed in the
outer atmospheres of late-type stars mainly due to the presence of highly structured magnetic
fields emerging from the convective envelope. Being the Sun the only star whose magnetic activ-
ity phenomena can be truly observed in great spatial detail, the interpretation of stellar activity
is generally based on the “solar-stellar connection” paradigm; i.e., most of the variability phe-
nomena observed in late-type stars are decoded using the solar analogous phenomena and their
interpretation as reference tools. This approach has been successful in emphasizing not only the
real analogies with the Sun but also to highlight the differences with respect to the solar case,
i.e., those situations that cannot be understood in the framework of the “solar-stellar connec-
tion” but deserve to take into account different processes and scenarios. On the other hand, the
investigation on stellar magnetic activity provides us with information useful to better model
phenomena observed on the Sun, because any good theory developed for the solar case must
survive the comparison with real data when stellar mass, radius, rotational velocity, internal
structure, evolutionary state, and/or other stellar parameters change.
Since stellar activity is observed in stars having surface convection zones, the origin of the
activity phenomena has been initially attributed to dissipating acoustic waves arising from the
convective layer beneath the photosphere (e.g., Schwarzschild 1948). However, it was rapidly
understood that the bulk of the observed activity phenomena are due to the dissipation of mag-
netic energy when magnetic fields, present on the surface of these stars, evolve from complex
to simple topologies with a lower content of stored energy. For this reason, magnetic activity is
often used ad a synonym of stellar activity.
Magnetic activity is produced by a physical mechanism known as dynamo, whose basic
ingredient is the coexistence of a convective zone under the stellar surface and the pres-
ence of a differential rotation regime. As shown by Parker (1977), the coupling between
differential rotation and turbulent convection produces the intensification of the magnetic
field and its periodic inversion. It is widely accepted that dynamo in the Sun is an interface
dynamo, requiring a radiative core beneath the convective envelope (α −Ω dynamo, cf. e.g.,
Spiegel and Zahn 1992). In fully convective stars and browns dwarfs, a distributed dynamo
(αdynamo, e.g., Chabrier and Küker 2006) is invoked to explain the presence of magnetic
activity.
Our knowledge of stellar structure indicates main-sequence stars less massive than about
1.5 solar masses to have convective zone beneath the photosphere, and in fact, stellar activity is
observed in stars of spectral type later than middle A (Simon et al. 2002). A description of how
dynamo works and how the continuous regeneration of poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields
takes place is beyond the scope of the present chapter. We instead focus here on the effects of
the dynamo on the external stellar atmospheres: photosphere, chromosphere, transition region,
and corona; i.e., those layers where the temperature increases from the minimum reached at
the top of the photosphere to million degrees in the corona, while plasma density continuously
decreases. The dynamo generates magnetic flux tubes; these buoyantly rise through the con-
vection zone, penetrate the stellar surface, and become braided and twisted by surface velocity
fields.1 The magnetic field drives plasma motion inside the flux tubes, so that hot plasma is
1When the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure, β = πp/B, is β > , then the gas pressure dominates
over the magnetic pressure, and the magnetic field is dominated by the plasma motion. This is the case in the
photosphere at the base of the field lines. Instead, β ≪1 occurs in the mid-corona, where plasma is dominated
by the magnetic field. In the upper corona, it becomes again β > (Gary 2001).

transported upward, where it radiates in faculae and plages, while the foot points of the flux
tubes in the photosphere appear dark (spots). Occasionally, magnetic fields reconnect and pro-
duce magnetic free energy and particles, i.e., coronal mass ejections (CMEs), flares, and micro-
and nanoflares, the last eventually heating and sustaining of the outer atmospheric layers. In
short, the magnetic loop structures, arising from the surface upward to the external atmo-
spheres, are the cause of the zoo of spots, faculae, flares, and CMEs, i.e., all the different magnetic
features we observe with a great detail on the Sun. Each observed feature is characterized by
its own temporal evolution and energetic, both in quantity and quality. As a consequence, the
time scale of stellar variability, the amount of involved energy, and the quality of the involved
photons can be used as tools for understanding the observed phenomena. Magnetic fields are
also responsible for slowing down cool stars because winds magnetically coupled to the stellar
surface carry away angular momentum (Schatzman 1962).
Active regions generated by the emergence of magnetic flux have different characteristics
depending from the layer where we look in the stellar atmosphere. Starspots and faculae are
detectable in the photosphere, with increasing contribution from the latter going toward the
chromosphere. Actually, on the Sun, variations in the optical continuum are dominated by
photospheric cool spots and warm faculae but more than 60% of the bolometric variations
over the solar cycle are produced at wavelengths below 400 nm (e.g., Krivova et al. 2006),
where the bright regions in the chromosphere and transition regions, called plages (French ori-
gin word), are the main contributors to variability. These are normally only detectable in the
monochromatic light of spectral lines, such as H-alpha, Ca ii H&K, or Mg ii h&k.
The whole “magnetic activity” phenomenology is highly variable in time. Active regions
grow and evolve in days to weeks, but are also site of transient phenomena, evolving on time
scales of few seconds to several hours, like flares, microflares, and CMEs. The global level of
magnetic activity changes in time following cycles as it happens for the Sun. Hence, depending
upon the peculiar aspect, one can be interested to study time scales ranging from seconds to
years.
The covering factor of active regions, as well as the energy output of stellar flares, can be
orders of magnitude more intense in stars than on the Sun. This is particularly true for very
fast rotators such as young stars and stars locked in close-binary systems. As discussed later in
this chapter, the ultimate result of magnetic activity on stellar evolution is the stellar spin down
driven by the loss of angular momentum carried out by the coronal stellar winds. As the star
spins down, the level of its magnetic activity decreases, in a self-attenuation feedback loop.
Useful data tostudymagneticactivitycome from the whole electromagneticspectrum, from
the radio wavelengths, where we measure the gyrosincrotron radiation arising from the quies-
cent and flaring corona, to the optical region, where important signatures are the Balmer lines,
the Ca ii IRT, and the H&K lines, that are powerful diagnostic of the chromosphere. The UV
region is of paramount relevance, being rich of emission lines whose formation temperature
goes from about 7,000 to million degrees, thus sampling the different layers of the atmosphere,
from the chromosphere to the transition region and corona. Finally, X-rays provide the best
tool to study the coronal thermal plasma.
If the dynamo is the primary engine that produces magnetic flux tubes, the details of the
mechanisms heating the outer atmosphere are still unclear. Models either rely on the dissipation
of electric currents or on the damping of a variety of waves traveling through the magnetic field
(Narain and Ulmschneider 1990). Among these, Alfvén waves are considered a viable heating
agent because of their capability to transport through the chromosphere sufficient energy to
heat and maintain a corona. Recently, Antolin and Shibata (2010) show a strong evidence for
the existence of energetic Alfvén waves in the solar corona establishing several constraints on

Alfvén wave heating as a coronal heating mechanism, especially for active region loops. To sum-
marize, magnetic fields have a role in coronal heating both via the direct liberation of magnetic
energy by reconnection and through dissipation of Alfvén waves.
The presence of an emission core in the Ca ii K line of Arcturus is the first report on stellar
magnetic activity in the literature (Eberhard and Schwarzschild 1913). These authors recog-
nized the solar-like nature of the observed phenomenon; however, the interest in investigating
magnetic activity in other stars than the Sun arose only several years later, when Olin C. Wilson
started a project to monitor Ca ii H&K lines at Mt. Wilson Observatory in 1950.
The Wilson’s project (e.g., Baliunas et al. 1998) remains one of the most conspicuous among
many observing programs providing bulks of fundamental data for stellar magnetic activity
studies. I recall also (i) the Lowell and Fairborn observatories projects (e.g., Radick et al. 1998;
Messina and Guinan 2002, 2003; Lockwood et al. 2007), aimed at the detection of photospheric
and chromospheric variability, and (ii) the many photometric and spectroscopic monitoring
projects carried out in several European observatories to get maps of spotted photospheres
(e.g., Rodonò 1992; Rodonò and Cutispoto 1994; Lanza et al. 1998; Rodonò et al. 2000; Messina
2008; Vida et al. 2007; Strassmeier2009) and of magnetic field patterns (e.g., Donati et al. 2003a;
Donati et al. 2003b; Donati et al. 2007). Recently, space observations from MOST, CoRoT, and
Kepler are providing very accurate optical variability data with high cadence and months dura-
tion (e.g., Walker et al. 2007, 2008; Lanza et al. 2009a, b, 2010; Brown et al. 2011). Photometric
and spectroscopic patrol of stellar flares from the ground have been carried out since the 1960s
in many places (cf., Gershberg 2005 and references therein). Finally, active regions and flares in
the upper chromosphere, transition regions and coronae, as well as solar-like winds have been
studied thanks to UV and EUV data from, e.g., IUE, HST, GALEX, EUVE, and FUSE; X-ray
data from, e.g., Einstein, Rosat, ASCA, Beppo-SAX, Chandra, and XMM-Newton; and radio
observations from VLA, VLBI, VLBA, and single dishes.

Stellar magnetic activity has been detected in all late-type stars cooler than Teff ∼8,300 K, i.e.,
laterthan A4V(Simon et al. 2002). Fortypical characteristics, these can be grouped as following:
•
Sunlike stars
•
M-type dwarfs
•
Rapidly rotating stars, i.e., stars in close binaries (e.g., BY Dra, RS CVn, FK Com) and young
PMS stars
•
Red giants and supergiants

Most of these stars have broadband optical flux rotationally modulated because of the
presence of starspots in their photosphere. Their optical spectrum is characterized by vari-
able Ca ii H&K and Balmer emission-line cores formed in the chromosphere. All apart red
giants and supergiants have transition regions and coronae that produce emission lines in the
EUV-UV, thermal X-ray, and nonthermal radio emission.
Sunlike stars are a very broad class including from late F to late G type dwarfs and subgiants.
Following Cayrel de Strobel and Bentolila (1989), solar-like stars are usuallyclassified as (i) Solar
analogs: these are pop I dwarfs having main properties similar to those of the Sun but can be of
different age, and (ii) solar twins: these have all physical parameters almost identical to those of
the Sun.
Active M-type dwarfs include the so-called flare stars or UV Cet-type from the name
of the class prototype. These are red dwarfs, typically dKe-dMe, showing sudden luminosity
increase observable from the optical to the radio wavelengths. In the optical spectrum, the
increase can be 1–7 mag peeking the U region. Flares last from few minutes to few hours.
Ca ii H&K and Balmer emission lines, that are filled in or in emission also during quies-
cence, become very strong emission features during flares. Chromospheres apparently exist
also in very-low-activity M stars, according to semiempirical models by Mauas et al. (1997).
On the other hand, X-ray and radio flares have been observed from fully convective late
M dwarfs and brown dwarfs, suggesting a nonsolar dynamo mechanism at work in these
object.
Rapidly rotating stars: several type of binaries show high level of magnetic activity main-
tained thanks to their forced spin–orbit coupling. Among the active binaries, we list (i) BY
Dra-type stars which are binary systems made by dKe-dMe stars. Their optical light curve have
period from a fraction to a hundreds of days and amplitude from few hundredths to half a
magnitude. Flares are typically observed also in these stars; (ii) RS CVn-type variables which
are detached binaries made of a F-G V-IV plus a K IV-III, both stars moderately or very active.
Period of variability is from a day to tens of days. Spots have been identified also close to the
pole, having covering factor up to 50% and evolving in weeks to months; (iii) W Uma-type vari-
ables: these are eclipsing contact binaries made by late-type star having period between 5 and
20 h (v sin i ∼100–200 km s−). They constitute about the 95% of eclipsing binaries close to the
Sun. W Uma are classified as A-type, which have components of similar temperature,or W-type
which have the primary cooler, possibly because the presence of dark spots on the surface (e.g.,
see Barnes et al. 2004); (iv) FK Com-type stars which are G-K III rapidly rotating single stars
showing very strong magnetic activity. Their evolutionary state has been proposed to be the
late evolution of a contact binaries (W Uma-type), with the coalescence of the original stars.
However, this scenario is not consistent with the presence of Li lines in their spectra, that is
generally interpreted as signature of youth. Fekel and Balachandran (1993), suggested that con-
vective motions penetrateto the core carrying Lithium and angular momentum from the inside
to the surface. From the observational point of view, the properties of FK Com-type stars are not
different from the RS CVn-type ones; (v)Algols which are eclipsing binaries with the primary
being a main-sequence hot star (B–F) and the secondary a cold subgiant (G–K) that has filled
in its Roche lobe. Thanks to the rapid rotation, Algols show magnetic activity signatures as RS
CVns (White and Marshall 1983; Stewart et al. 1989; Umana et al. 1989). For contrast reasons,
photospheric starspots are detectable only during primary eclipses, when the hot component is
hidden. Because of tidal synchronization, this implies that starspots are observed only on one
hemisphere of Algols secondary stars.

Stellar Activity
Among the rapid rotators are the pre-main-sequence low-mass T Tauri stars (TTS)
which show signatures of magnetic activities often mixed with accretion phenomena, with
circumstellar gas and dust disk surviving from the formation process. TTSs have large starspots
and show flares and accretion process signatures. General reviews on TTS have been given
by Bertout (1989), Appenzeller and Mundt (1989), and Petrov (2003), while for their coronal
activity, we refer to Feigelson et al. (2007).
Red giants and supergiants, where a low-speed cool wind is detected with a mass-loss rate
>10−M⊙year−, have chromospheres but do not show coronal signatures. However, yellow
supergiants, the ones at the bottom limit of the wind zone, show both winds and coronal
signatures (Ayres et al. 1981a); these are called Hybrids.

Stellar Chromospheres
Main diagnostics of stellar chromospheres are optically thick Ca ii H&K lines, Ca ii IRT,
H-alpha, whose core is formed in the chromosphere, and the many UV lines, e.g., O i, C i, and
Fe ii, with formation temperature at around 10K.
3.1 Ca II H&K and Wilson–Bappu Relation
The inversion of the temperature gradient beyond the photosphere determines the filling of
the line core of resonance lines, the strongest of which in the optical spectrum are those of
singly ionized calcium at 392.3 and 396.8 nm, i.e., the Ca ii H&K lines. In late-type stars, these
lines are very opaque; the core forms in the chromosphere and can be used as a signature of
the chromospheric properties (cf. Linsky and Avrett 1970 for an early but very accurate review
on the properties of the Ca ii H&K lines and theories for its detailed formation and behavior).
The Ca ii K line profiles of the full solar disk at two epochs, maximum and minimum of the
solar cycle, respectively, of a solar plage, and of the quiet Sun, obtained at the same distance
from the solar limb, are shown in >Fig. 10-1; it is apparent that the emission component of
the Ca ii H&K lines is very small in full disk or in the spectrum of quiet Sun than it is in the
spectrum of a plage. This behavior anticipates that Ca ii H&K lines are a powerful diagnostic
of stellar activity being very sensible to active region filling factors. As firstly annotated by Hale
and Ellerman (1904), the minimum of the broad absorption line, produced in the photosphere,
is called (H)K1, with the indexes b and r indicating the blue and red sides with respect to the
central emission; the emission core, that originates in the chromosphere, is called (H)K2, with
the suffixes b and r for the blue and red sides with respect to the central absorption; the latter,
often referred to as central reversal and annotated as (H)K3, occurs because photons produced
in the deeper chromosphere are removed from the line of sight in the upper layers, where the
source function decreases.
Observations of stellar Ca ii H&K spectra are largely used to identify the level of chro-
mospheric activity in late-type stars and its variability. Pioneering studies making use of
high-resolution stellar spectra which have been analyzed by using the Sun as template show
several intriguing aspects: for increasing stellar activity level, the separation of K1 minima
increases and the distance between the K2 maxima decreases (Ayres et al. 1981a; Pasquini
et al. 1990); however, the FWHM of the emission core is independent from the activity level,

while it is strongly correlated with the absolute visual magnitude of the star. The last relation is
called Wilson–Bappu (hereafter WB) effect, from the authors who first noticed and published
such a remarkable empirical correlation. WB effect works over about 15 stellar magnitudes
(Wilson and Vainu Bappu 1957; Linsky 1999 for an excellent review). Originally, the WB effect
was expressed by the following relation:
MV = .−.logW
(10.1)
where MV is the absolute visual luminosity, and W(km s−) was the separation between the
outer edges of the Ca ii K emission features on the photographic spectrograms, a quantity close
to the full width at half maximum of the emission core. Several studies have redetermined this

relation from different data sets. Pace et al. (2003) have derived the following relation:
MV = .−.logW
(10.2)
where W(km s−) is measured with a well-defined quantitative criterion from high-resolution
and high S/N CCD spectra of 119 nearby stars, whose absolute visual magnitudes is
taken from the Hipparcos database (> Fig. 10-2). The root mean square error of relation
(> 10.2) – 0.6 mag – is mainly due to measurement errors, intrinsic variability of W, and pos-
sible dependence on the metallicity that, according to the authors, is clearly noticeable for
metallicities below (Fe/H) ∼−..
Although the WB relation does not provide accuratedistances to single stars, it can be confi-
dently used to determine distances to clusters and aggregates, provided that a sufficient number
of stars can be observed and metallicities (Fe/H) are not lower than −.(Pace et al. 2003).
WB-like relations between width and luminosity have been measured for other chromo-
spheric emission lines, such as the Mg ii h&k resonance lines at 280.3 and 279.6 nm. For
instance, Cassatella et al. (2001) determined the WB relation for the Mg ii k line at 279.6 nm,
based on a selection of 230 stars observed by both the IUE and Hipparcos satellites, covering
a wide range of spectral types (F to M) and absolute visual magnitudes (−.≤MV ≤.);
despite the coefficients of the WB relationship critically depend upon the choice of the method
of analysis, these authors have not found any dependence of the WB relation from stellar
metallicity and effective temperature.
The increase in chromosphere thickness with decreasing gravityin a hydrostaticequilibrium
atmosphere appears to be the most convincing explanation for the WB effect, except perhaps
for the most luminous stars. The dependence from gravity of the width of chromospheric reso-
nance lines is reproduced by stellar atmosphere models when the partial redistribution (PRD)
formulation of the radiative transfer equation is considered (cf. Linsky 1999, and references
therein).

3.2 The Activity Indexes
The discovery of the WB effect gave input to the project at Mt. Wilson Observatory consisting
of a systematic long-term spectro-photometric monitoring of the Ca ii H&K lines in late-type
stars. This project led to the discovery of stellar activity cycles and to the measurement of stellar
rotation rates in slow rotators, thanks to the modulation of the visibility of chromospheric plages
due to the stellar rotation. The Mt. Wilson Observatory (MWO) program was started by Olin
Wilson in 1966 with observations oflow main-sequence solar-like stars scheduled monthlyuntil
about 1980 at the 100 in. telescope. With the dedication of a 60 in. telescope to the project, the
observations became almost nightly and a sample of post-main-sequence stars was included
later among the monitored targets. Over 400,000 observations of more than 2,000 stars have
been collected till the end of the project in 2003, allowing to study the chromospheric variability
over time scales from days to tens of years. The instrumental setup at Mt. Wilson led to the
definition of the “activity index” S:
S = α H + K
V + R
(10.3)
where H and K are two narrow (0.1 nm2) passbands centered at the Ca ii H&K line centers,
respectively, while V and R are two 2.0-nm-wide passbands centered at 390.1 and 400.1 nm,
respectively, to sample the photospheric flux. The quantity α is a calibration factor (cf. Baliunas
et al. (1995) for a summary of the Mt. Wilson program-specific measurements and results).
Baliunas et al. (1998) show that of the whole MWO sample:
1. About 60% have periodic, or apparently periodic, variation in the S index, without any obvi-
ous dependence from spectral types or age. Activity cycles can be longer than the 30 years
of the MWO project, with the older stars never showing cycles shorter than 7 years. Some
of the monitored targets show two independent periodicities.
2. About 25% are variable but no obvious periodicity has been found. Most of the targets in
this group are young, very active rapidly rotating stars.
3. About 15% are constant with time, possibly in a Maunder-Minimum-like state. These have
been dubbed also as “flat activity stars.”
Example of the above class of objects are shown in >Fig. 10-3.
Data from MWO have been used to search for dwarf stars in flat activity state, analogous to
the low-level activity period of the Sun in the seventeenth century, known as Mounder mini-
mum. For instance, Saar and Baliunas (1992) estimatedthat 10–15% of the solar-like stars in the
MWO sample were detected in states of low activity. Wright (2004) demonstrated that most of
these objects were actually slightly evolved stars, which have lower levels of activity than main-
sequence stars (cf., >Fig. 10-4). The typical criterion used to define a star as an MM candidate
is it has log RHK < −.. According to Saar (2006), this limit has been defined including in the
sample subgiants, so that it is possible that solar-like stars in an MM phase do not have a so low
value of log RHK. Moreover, the minimum RHK observed in dwarfs resulted to be a decreasing
function of stellar metallicity (see Hall et al. 2009). Taking this effect into account, a few couple
of targets are now considered to be MM candidates. For a complete review of stellar magnetic
cycles, see Lanza (2010).
S is a dimensionless index, dependent on the stellar color, with S increasing toward later
spectral type as a consequence of the decrease of the photospheric continuum to which the
2H&K are measured in 0.2-nm-wide bands in case of giant stars whose line core is wide for the WB effect.

HK essentially gives the fraction of a stars bolometric luminosity radiated as chromospheric
H and K emission; it is typically expressed in log units and ranges from about −.to −.for
very active to highly inactive stars.
We will make use of this quantity in the coming sections.
3.2.1 The Vaughan-Preston Gap
Typical S-values range from ∼0.1 to 1.0 or more (for dMe stars). For each color, a large spread
in the S index is found, as shown in >Fig. 10-5. Eventually, for a given spectral class, both stars
with low and high chromospheric activity can be found. Vaughan and Preston (1980) show
that there are relatively large numbers of stars in the B −V range 0.45–1.0 with either strong
or weak chromospheric emission but relatively few with moderate emission. This discontinuity
in the distribution of S versus B −V has been dubbed Vaughan–Preston gap. Some authors
questioned the statistical significance of such a gap (e.g., Hartmann et al. 1984); however, the
bimodal behavior has been confirmed by Henry et al. (1996) who surveyed the Ca ii H&K core

of about 800 late-type stars in the southern hemisphere, hence with an entirely different instru-
mental setup and stellar sample. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the origin
of the Vaughan–Preston gap. Since chromospheric activity decreases with increasing stellar age,
for instance, the Vaughan–Preston gap could represent a change in the nature of activity at a
certain stellar age. Similarly, it could be interpreted as due to a fluctuation in the local stel-
lar birthrate and therefore as originated by a slowly varying star formation rate. Alternatively,
since activity is closely related to the stellar dynamo generating the surface magnetic fields, the
Vaughan–Preston gap could be due either to a rapid spin down at some point of the stellar
evolution or to an abrupt change in the efficiency of the dynamo for a given rotation period
(Durney et al. 1981; Böhm-Vitense 2007). Finally, the Vaughan–Preston gap could not be due
to a discontinuity in the chromospheric heating but to a change in the response of the Ca ii
emission to this heating.
3.3 Chromospheric Activity Versus Rotation
Mt. Wilson observations taken after 1980, when nightly monitoring series have been secured,
have been used to identify rotation periods, and in a few cases also differential rotation. Noyes
et al. (1984) shown that R
′
HK is correlated with the stellar rotation period Prot, with the Ca ii
emission decreasing with increasing rotational period. Being the core of Caii H&K lines a proxy
for the efficiency of the stellar dynamo, the correlation with Prot is not surprising, since qual-
itatively the dynamo is more effective for fast rotator. A more tight relation has been found
between R
′
HK and the Rossby number R= Prot/τc, where τc is the convective turnover time
computed at the base of the convective zone assuming a ratio α = of the mixing length to
scale height (Noyes et al. 1984). These results suggest a more intimate connection between the
activity index and the dynamo mechanism.
The relation shown in > Fig. 10-6 suggests that rotational periods can be inferred from
a measurement of the chromospheric emission. Being rotational periods linked to stellar age
(Skumanich 1972), in principle, a measurement of the level of chromospheric activity could
yield the precious information on stellar age. As we will discuss later, many other diagnostics –
e.g., X-ray flux – lead to the conclusion that magnetic activity level changes during the stellar
life. We will return on this topic in >Sect. 9.

From the Chromospheres to the Transition Regions
Spectral lines falling in the UV (900–3,200 Å) and EUV (100–900 Å) bands have formation
temperature ranging from few 10K to few 10K. These spectral ranges include the CO and
Hmolecule bands, the former formed in the so-called COmosphere (see Ayres 2002) and the
latter due to fluorescent pumping from high-temperaturelines; the C i and O i lines which form
at typical chromospheric temperatures; the C ii–iv, N iv, O iii–v, Si ii–iv lines which form in
the transition region; and some high-temperature lines, e.g., Fe xii, and Fe xxi, which form in
the corona. An inventory of stellar UV emission lines detected by FUSE and HST in late-type
magnetically active stars is shown in >Fig. 10-7. An example of a high-resolution (2.6 km s−)
UV spectrum of a solar-type star is the one of α Cen A (G2 V) acquired by the Space Tele-
scope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on HST and shown in >Fig. 10-8. A total of 662 emission

features – of which 77 due to blends of two or more lines, 71 due to unidentified transitions,
and 514 identified as due to single emission lines – have been measured in this spectrum. More
than 65% of the 671 identified emission lines are due to Si i, Fe ii, and C i (see Pagano et al. 2004,
for the whole line list). Several intersystem lines are present in the UV spectrum, including the
O iv UV 0.01 intercombination multiplet spP
J −spPJ that are diagnostics of electron
density (cf. Del Zanna et al. 2002; Brage et al. 1996, and references therein), the N iv line at
1,486 Å, and the O iii line at 1,666 Å.
Moreover, it is on fitting of the FUV continuum that rely the semiempirical models of the
solar chromosphere (e.g., Vernazza et al. 1981; Avrett and Loeser 2008; Fontenla et al. 2009).
Quantitative analyses of stellar FUV continua have made feasible by the high throughput and
very low detector background of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space
Telescope. Linsky et al. (2012) measured the continuum flux of 11 solar-mass stars within
136 pc, finding a clear trend of increasing continuum brightness temperature at all FUV wave-
lengths with decreasing rotational period, which provides an important measure of magnetic
heating rates in stellar chromospheres. Comparison with semiempirical solar flux models shows
that the most rapidly rotating solar-mass stars have FUV continuum brightness temperatures
similar to the brightest faculae seen on the Sun. The thermal structure of the brightest solar
faculae therefore provides a first-order estimate of the thermal structure and heating rate for
the most rapidly rotating solar-mass stars.

4.1 The Linsky–Haisch Dividing Line
As early as in the first year of operation of the IUE satellite,Linsky and Haisch (1979) recognized
the presence of two distinct groups in the HR diagram; a solar-type group showing spectral
lines formed at temperatures indicative of chromospheres, transition regions, and by impli-
cation unseen coronae, and a non-solar-type group showing lines formed at temperatures not
hotter than 10,000–20,000 K, indicative of chromospheres only. In fact, as shown in >Fig. 10-9,
soft X-ray emissions from hot coronae (T ≥10K) are rarely detectedto the right of the so-called
“Linsky–Haisch dividing line” that bisects the giant branch near spectral type K1 III (see also
Ayres et al. 1981a; Haisch and Simon 1982). Linsky and Haisch (1979) suggested the onset of
large stellar winds as the origin of the absence of corona. The lack of a corona beyond the divid-
ing line, has been ascribed by Antiochos et al. (1986) to the low surface gravity of red giants
which could trigger thermal instabilities having the effect to prevent solar-like hot coronal mag-
netic loops to exist. Rosner et al. (1995) suggested that the dividing line can be due to a different

while on the red-ward side, it produces mainly open magnetic fields. If such a topological tran-
sition occurs, then these stars naturally segregate into two classes: those having hot coronae on
the blue-ward side and those having massive cool winds on the red-ward side, thus leading nat-
urally to the so-called dividing line. The earlier reports of the absence of red giant coronae were
questioned by the detection of C iv emission and soft X-ray from γ Dra (K5 III) (Brown et al.
1994) and of coronal proxies (e.g., Si iv with log T= .) in other noncoronal red giants, at levels
only a few times lower than typical coronal K0 giants (Ayres et al. 1995). A search for coronal
emission by means of Chandra X-ray satellite made by Ayres et al. (2003) led to the conclusion
that the noncoronal giants Arcturus (K1 III) and Aldebaran (K5 III) have luminosities in the
0.2–2 keV band about two orders of magnitude less than the Sun, despite their surface areas are

more than 100 times the solar one. Ayres et al. (1997) suggest that coronal loops of inactive red
giants like Arcturus could be very compact and merely embedded in an absorbing environment
which could significantly attenuate any intrinsic X-ray emissions.
Vilhu and Walter (1987) have measured the fluxes of cool stars of different level of activ-
ities in the chromospheric Mg ii doublet at 2,800 Å and in the transition region C iv doublet
1,540 Å (cf. >Fig. 10-10), showing that the chromospheric and transition region emissions do
not depend on the photospheric temperature and that span from a low limit (dubbed “basal
flux”), defined by the pure acoustic heating of the chromosphere, and an upper one defined by
the heating working in a saturation regime, as clearly shown also by X-ray observations, as we
discuss later in >Sect. 7.

Active Regions
5.1 Starspots and Faculae
A recent review on stellar spots has been given by Strassmeier (2009), to whom we refer the
reader also for a complete compilation of previous reviews and a list of dedicated conferences
on the matter. Spots on the stellar surfaces – like sunspots – are characterized by an effec-
tive temperature lower than the effective temperature of the unperturbed photosphere and are
responsible for a decrease of the disk-integrated flux both in the bolometric band and in the
optical passbands. On the contrary, bright faculae, produce an increase of the disk-integrated
fluxes. Hence, the time variability of the photospheric flux mainly depends on the intrinsic
evolution ofstarspots and faculae and on the modulation oftheirvisibilitydue tostellarrotation.
5.1.1 Methods to Derive Information on Starspots
Direct stellar images of active stars are not obtainable at moment. Gilliland and Dupree (1996)
used HST to get UV images of the chromosphere of the supergiant star α Ori (Betelgeuse) with

504 10
Stellar Activity
about mas resolution. Imaging the closest solar-like dwarf stars – with enough resolution
to record small active regions and crudely detect the supergranulation network – is feasible
with a spatial resolution of about a tenth of a milliarcsecond, i.e., 500 times better than the
best delivered by HST in the UV. Extending the sample to dwarfs within pc would require
microarcsec imaging. Hence, all we know about starspots is indirectly derived by means of the
signatures they leave on the optical light curves and on the spectra. A complete description
of the observational tools and diagnostic techniques to study starspots is given by Berdyugina
(2005).
The Doppler imaging technique (DIT) is very robust in deriving maps from high-resolution
spectral line profiles of rapidly rotating stars. A cool spot creates a distortion in the spectral lines
at a wavelength location corresponding to the spot’s longitudinal location on the stellar surface.
The shape of this distortion is merely a one-dimensional projection of the spot feature. As the
star rotates, we see the spot feature from a different aspect and thus get a different projection.
Moreover, the velocity amplitude of the spot-generated feature depends on the spot latitude.
Using a series of these projections, it is possible to derive information about the size, shape, and
location of the spot feature, thus obtaining two-dimensional images of inhomogeneous stellar
surfaces. The method, initially developed to map chemical peculiarities on the surface of Ap
stars, was lately proposed to map the surface of V 711 Tau by Vogt and Penrod (1983). The
reader interested in the DIT assumptions, the used regularization methods and their pro and
contra are referred to Berdyugina (2005), Thomas and Weiss (2008), and references therein.
About 80 cool stars have been studied with the Doppler imaging technique up to date (Strass-
meier 2009). About half of them are single stars and half are components of close binaries. For
20% of them, DIT maps have been obtained at several epochs.
The DIT requires that the rotational broadening of a line profile is significantly larger than
the local line profile at a single point on the stellar surface. Hence, slowly rotating late-type
stars have line profiles not large enough to allow the search of the Doppler footprints of active
regions. Assuming that the active regions are stable during their transit across the disk as the
star rotates, the modulation of the visibility of the active regions generates the variability of the
optical flux.
Spot models of photometric light curves are used to obtain maps of the filling factor of the
active regions over the surface of a star. Earlier models were based on two circular spots whose
position and size were adjusted in order to fit the light curve rotational modulation (see, e.g.,
Rodonò et al. 1986). The same kind of approach, but using three active regions containing cool
spots and bright faculae in a fixed proportion, was applied by Lanza et al. (2003, 2004) to fit
the total and the spectral solar irradiance variations using the SoHo/Virgo data of the Sun seen
as a star. The position of the three model active regions and the variation of their total area
along a significant fraction of activity cycle 23 turned out to be in good agreement with those
of the largest observed active regions and complexes of activity dominating the solar irradi-
ance variations. However, the longitudinal distribution of the observed active regions close to
the solar maximum was too much complex to be described with only three active regions, and
this resulted in a poor agreement between the model and the observations. The same is true
for the most active stars. For instance, the surface maps obtained from the light curve model-
ing of the K1 subgiant component of the RS CVn system HR 1099 can be compared with the
much more detailed Doppler imaging maps revealing that the spot models based on two or
a few spots are generally not suited to reconstruct the complex distribution of surface bright-
ness inhomogeneities characterizing a real active star (Vogt et al. 1999). On the other hand, the
application of regularization techniques (e.g., the maximum entropy and Tikhonov algorithms)

Stellar Activity 10
505
to a continuous distribution of spots showed a significantly better agreement between the maps
based on wide-band photometric data and those obtained by Doppler imaging. In particular,
the longitude distribution of the spotted area and its total variation versus time can be safely
reconstructed by means of those more sophisticated light curve inversion techniques, as it was
shown by Lanza et al. (2006, 2007).
The Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) method is similar to the DIT, but stellar magnetic fields
instead of surface temperature inhomogeneities are detected. ZDI is based on the search for the
rotational modulated Zeeman signatures generated by the magnetic fields in the spectral line
profiles and on their polarization state. Moderate to ultrafast rotators are preferred targets; in
fact, for slow rotators, the net circular polarization signal in spectral lines is negligible because
contributions of regions of opposite field polarity would be mutually cancelled. Since Zeeman
signatures in atomic lines due to starspots are expected to be extremely small, multiline cross-
correlation algorithms, like the “least squares deconvolution” (Donati et al. 1997), are used to
extract and enhance the quality of individual polarized line profiles and to increase the Zeeman
signature. By applying inversion techniques, similar to those used for Doppler imaging to all
four Stokes parameters, the temperature and magnetic field vector can be recovered over the
stellar surface. Discussion and references on ZDI results are provided by Strassmeier (2009).
5.1.2 Starspots’Main Parameters
Size and Temperature. While in solar twins, starspots determine rotation modulated variations
in the optical band very hard to detect, the most active stars have spotted areas covering up to
20% of the entire stellar surface or about 40% of the stellar disk. By molecular bands modeling,
even higher filling factors-up to 55% of the stellar disk-have been detected, (see, e.g., the study
of the very active RS CVn-type star II Peg O’Neal et al. 1996, 1998). It is worth noting that
uniformly distributed spots do not produce rotational modulated signal and that depending
upon the inclination axis with respect the line of sight, also, Doppler imaging may not easily
reveal the absolute spot coverage. Moreover, there is a fundamental trade-off between spot area
and spot temperature derived by light curve spot models. As shown by Lanza et al. (2004), even
in the case light curves are available in different passbands, the spots and faculae temperature
cannot be unambiguously derived except for the rare cases in which a very simple and highly
stable active region configuration dominates. Also, with the Doppler imaging technique, the
temperature scale remains model dependent. TiO bands at 886 nm have been used to measure
starspots temperatures. For instance, Neff et al. (1995) and O’Neal et al. (1996) obtained an
evaluation of the spot temperature, with an estimated error of 100–200 K, and of the surface
filling factor, for a number of active stars. The method, however, is effective for stars with spot
temperatures lower than 3,500 K, but it fails for stars with effective temperature higher than
5,000 K.
A very effective method in detecting low variations of the disk-averaged temperature in
active stars is the one based on line-depth ratio of lines having different temperature sensitiv-
ity – e.g., the V i 625.18 nm and Fe i 625.26 nm lines. The spot temperature in this way can
be determined within 5–15 K. Moreover, by combining the line-depth ratio technique with
simultaneous photometry, it is possible to disentangle the spot area from the spot temper-
ature (cf. Catalano et al. 2002). Berdyugina (2005) shows that starspot contrast with respect
to the unperturbed photosphere decreases with spectral type, regardless the luminosity class.

506 10
Stellar Activity
The typical temperaturedifference between spots and stellar quiet photosphere goes from about
2,000 K in G0 stars to 200 K in M4 stars.
Location. Starspot latitudes can be directly recovered from DIT, that has found the presence of
polar spots in about 55% of modeled targets, a clear not solar-like scenario. Also very different
than the solar case is the detection of starspots migration toward the poles and the existence of
high-latitude rings of toroidal field (e.g., Catala et al. 2007; Donati et al. 2003b) shown by ZDI.
On the other hand, the concentration of magnetic flux in rings of opposite polarity around the
pole of the active stars has been theoretically explained by models accounting for the dynamo
mechanism working as in the Sun but with a bipolar magnetic field emergence rate 30 times
higher than in the solar case (Schrijver and Title 2001). Another observed characteristic is the
presence of permanent active longitudes, often 180○apart. These are sites where spots prefer-
ably develop and evolve. Active longitudes show in some cases migration path – e.g., AB Dor
(Järvinen et al. 2005) and CoRoT2a (Lanza et al. 2009b). The level of spot activity in each active
longitude has been observed to cyclically change: this is know as a “flip-flop effect”; an example
is show in >Fig. 10-11 (Berdyugina et al. 1999). The period for such a change is from a few
years to a decade.
Cycles and patterns. Berdyugina and Usoskin (2003) claim the presence of a flip-flop cycle on
the Sun with period of 3.8 and 3.65 year in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.
This period is about 1/3 of the 11-year sunspot cycle and agrees with the results obtained for

young solar analogues. The difference between flip-flop cycle lengths in the north and south is
significant and produces an oscillating effect in the north–south asymmetry on a century time
scale. Although active longitudes endure for a long time, active regions they consist of evolve in
size (cf. the case of CoRoT-2a discussed later). Typically, starspots evolve on time scales of tens
of days, as can be clearly observed in >Fig. 10-12 where the evolution of the optical light curve
of II Peg in 6 months is shown.
5.1.3 Starspots in Solar-Like Stars
The detection of starspots on low active stars like the Sun is a very recent achievement. On the
Sun in fact, the largest spots at maximum of solar cycles imply variations of its optical flux of the
order of 10−. From the ground in the past decades we were able to detect amplitudes of a few
hundredth ofmagnitudes, and onlyrecently, thanks toprogresses in CCD observing techniques,
we are capable to detect variations of few 10−. The very low amplitude signatures of spots on
low active stars benefit from space observations and have been in the recent years detected,
thanks to experiments like MOST, CoRoT, and Kepler, build to detect the weak signatures of
star oscillations or planetary transits. For instance, spot modeling techniques have been applied
to high-precision photometric time series obtained by the CoRoT satellite providing for the
first time maps of photospheric magnetic activity in solar-like stars that have a level of activity
comparable to the Sun. As an example, the case of CoRoT-2a is very illustrative; this G7 V star
hosts a hot-Jupiter planet that orbits it in 1.743 d (cf. Alonso et al. 2008). The star, a good proxy
for the Sun at an age of approximately 0.5 Gyr, has been continuously observed by CoRoT for
142 days with unprecedented photometric precision. The CoRoT optical light curve shows a
star about 20 times more active than the Sun at its maximum. Lanza et al. (2009b) derived

508 10
Stellar Activity
the evolution of the star photosheric map (cf. > Fig. 10-13) showing that this is dominated
by two active longitudes initially on opposite hemispheres. In the time the star rotates with a
period of about 4.52 d, the active region separation changes by ∼○during the time span of
the observations. From this variation, a relative amplitude of the surface differential rotation
ΔΩ/Ω ∼.is estimated. Moreover, the maps show that individual spots form within the
active longitudes and show an angular velocity ∼1% lower than that of the active area. This
effect can be due to a progressive dynamical decoupling of the magnetic flux tubes from the deep
layers once spots are formed. The overall scenario derived by the Lanza et al. (2009b) analysis
has been confirmed by independent analysis by Huber et al. (2010). Active regions last about
55 days, while lifetime of spots inside them is of about 20–30 days. The total spotted area shows
a cyclic oscillation with a period of 28.9 ± 4.3 day, which is close to ten times the synodic period
of the planet as seen by the rotating active longitudes, suggesting star planet interaction at work,
as confirmed by the analysis performed by Pagano et al. (2009), who find that the variance of
the stellar light curve is modulated in phase with the planet orbital period.
Accurate photometry from space has therefore opened a new window on solar-analog vari-
ability, being these studies not possible from the ground or through mapping techniques based
on high-resolution spectroscopy.

5.2 Chromospheric Plages
Our knowledge of stellar magnetic cycles is mainly based on observations of starspots, i.e., sites
of concentrated strong magnetic fields. However, an important fraction of the global magnetic
flux is related to smaller-scale magnetic fields. These, in the solar case, are traced by plages,
which are present even at cycle minimum when few or no spots are on the disk. Understanding
the link between activity cycles and small-scale magnetic fields is a key issue to further progress
on dynamo models, especially to improve the capability to forecast details of activity on time
scales of months to years.
Location and migration patterns of active regions in the chromospheric and transition-
region emissions of stars can be derived by direct images or inferred by means of indirect
techniques.
5.2.1 Direct Imaging of the Chromosphere
Direct narrowband images of the chromosphere have been secured till today only for the red
supergiant Betelgeuse (α Ori, M1-2Ia-Ibe), imaged bythe Faint Object Camera on Hubble Space
Telescope at 50 mas resolution in the mid-UV. The Betelgeusechromosphere resulting from the
HST images is more than twice extended with respect to the photosphere, with a single bright,
unresolved area brighter than the surrounding disk with a temperature differential in excess
of 200 K (e.g., Gilliland and Dupree 1996). The extended α Ori’s chromosphere is apparently
hard to be concealed with the view obtained by spatially resolved radio data which show a
much cooler extended atmospheres (Lim et al. 1998), suggesting a copresence of hot chromo-
spheric plasma and cooler gas. Moreover, by using UV and radio diagnostics for the plasma
density, it was demonstrated that there is over an order of magnitude difference in electron
density between the hot (from UV) and cool (from radio) plasma components (Harper and
Brown 2006). Theoretical modelsattempting to account for both UV and radio data predict that
the hot chromospheric plasma is confined in numerous uniformly distributed thin structures
(Harper 2010).
The case of Betelgeuse is unfortunately unique and will be so for the near future. In fact,
obtaining a ×pixelUV map sufficient to record small active regions, and crudely image
the supergranulation network, requires a spatial resolution of about a tenth of a mas for the
closest solar-like dwarf stars and at μas level to extend the sample within 100 pc. These perfor-
mances can be reached by a kilometer scale interferometer like the one proposed by the Stellar
Imager mission concept studied by NASA (Carpenter et al. 2009).
5.2.2 Spectral Imaging
An indirect technique to derive the location and migration patterns of plages in the chromo-
spheres and transition regions is to use time series of high-resolution emission-line profiles
to highlight their Doppler-shifted signatures. This method, known as “spectral imaging tech-
nique,” can be applied to rapidly rotating active stars whose rotationally broadened chromo-
spheric (e.g., Mg ii h&k 2,800 Å) or higher temperature (e.g., C iv 1,548 Å) emission lines are
generally observed to be distorted and highly variable from one phase to the next. The distorted
emission-line profiles are the result of several components: the uniformly distributed emission

510 10
Stellar Activity
(i.e., the “quiet” emission) due to the stellar chromosphere (or transition region), the absorption
intervening in the interstellar medium (ISM) between the star and the observer, and the emis-
sion arising from plages and/or flares which are Doppler shifted according to the active region
location with respect to the central meridian. These latter components are variable from one
spectrum to the other because intrinsically variable and because their visibility is modulated by
the stellar rotation.
A few RS CVn-type stars with rotation periods less than 3 days have been monitored in the
Mg ii h&k light with the IUE satellite to get maps of their chromosphere (e.g., Walter et al. 1987;
Neff et al. 1989; Busà et al. 1999; Pagano et al. 2001). Plage signatures have been detected and
followed from their appearance on the blue wing of the line profile to their crossing at the central
meridian, till their disappearance when reach the red wing of the line profile (>Fig. 10-14).

main Gaussians represent the emission from each stars; the absorption component is due to the
interstellar medium (ISM). From the analysis of a time series of such proﬁles, it was possible to
understand that the E component is due to an active region, which migrate across the line pro-
ﬁle because of the stellar rotation, and the L1 component is due to emission near to the system
center of mass (Pagano et al. 2001)

As an illustrative example, we report here results of the analysis of a sequence of 59 high-
resolution Mg ii k line profiles secured by IUE in October 1994 of AR Lac, a binary system of
RS CVn-type consisting of a G2 IV primary and a K0 IV secondary stars which are spin–orbit
coupled with a ∼.d period:
(a) Light curves obtained bymeasuring the fluxes ofchromosphericand TR emission lines show
eclipses that are much wider in phase than predicted by the geometrical eclipses of the stellar
photospheres. This fact implies that the plasma at temperaturebetween about 10and 10K
extends well above the stellar photospheres.
(b) The chromospheric emission of the G2 IV star appeared to be both compact and spatially
homogeneous, while the chromosphere of the K0 IV star was spatially nonuniform with the
outer hemisphere weaker than the one facing its companion. Regions of enhanced chromo-
spheric emission corotating with the K0 IV star and localized at heights between 0.3 and
1.2 R∗above the photosphere have been detected. These results are consistent with the con-
clusions drawn by X-ray observations which suggest a compact corona surrounding the G2
IV star whereas an extended corona surrounds the K0 IV star (see Rodonò et al. 1999 and
references therein). Moreover, the presence of chromospheric plasma at distances as large
as 1.2 R∗above the K0 IV photosphere suggests that some mechanism is at work to confine
the “cool” plasma in a much hotter coronal environment. The multi-temperature structure
of the external atmosphere of magnetic active stars is suggested also by the observations
of extremely broadened TR emission lines in some rapidly rotating giant stars; being the
rotation broadened line widths up to twice that expected from the photospheric v sin i, the
10K plasma must be located at levels up to 10 pressure scale heights above its equilibrium
altitude, raising questions as how the gas got there and how it can remain (Ayres et al. 1998).
(c) The active regions lifetime was greater than the 4 days of coverage.
(d) From the mean Mg ii h&k surface fluxes of the active regions, the presence of heating
mechanism operating in a regime close to saturation can be derived.
(e) Absorbing material in the lines of sight toward both the K0 IV star and the G2 IV star
has been detected both as sporadic episodes and in permanent corotating structures. Evi-
dences for the existence of absorbing structures embedded in the coronal plasma were
previously found by Neff et al. (1989) – who have observed the disappearing of the G2
IV chromosphere, possibly behind a large extended absorbing structure in the Mg ii h&k
lines – and by Walter (1996a) from an EUV light curve of AR Lac observed by the EUVE DS
photometer (70–190 Å). Extended absorbing structures were also observed in Hα (Collier-
Cameron et al. 1990) and UV emission lines (Walter 1996b) of the active single early K dwarf
AB Dor and in the UV emission lines of the eclipsing K2 V-dA binary V471 Tau by Walter
and Kim (2001).
(f) A bright feature in Mg ii k light has been detected to be permanently present close to the L1
Lagrangian point. This has been interpreted as a possible signature of some hot spot due to
mass exchange between the two stars. Evidence for a similar intersystem structure was found
also for the RS CVn-type binary system HR 1099 by Busà et al. (1999) and, independently,
by Richards and Rosolowsky (1998).
The best targets for emission-line spectral imaging are rapidly rotating stars which, by their
nature, are highly active and flare frequently. Time series of UV spectra with spectral resolution
≥30,000 (<10 km s−) with good enough cadence to avoid smearing the Doppler information,
and long enough coverage to distinguish between persistent surface features and transient
flare activity, are required to detect discrete emission components migrating through the
line profile of chromospheric and transition-region lines. While it was straightforward for an

observatory/satellite like IUE performing an observing program requiring the monitoring of a
same object for typically 2–6 days, as it did for a number of sources, it resulted not trivial with
the Hubble Space Telescope, because ofits Earth occulted orbit and the difficulties toaccomplish
monitoring projects given the strong pressure to get observing time. The single attempt by HST
to map the outer atmosphere of a cool star, namely, HD 155555 (Dempsey et al. 2001), covered
one stellar rotation and was only partially successful because flaring and non-phase-dependent
variability could not be separated from rotational modulation of unchanging active regions. For
this reason, up to date, only few stars have been systematically observed in the UV range for
magnetic activity cycles, and the observations have been obtained only for very active stars.
5.3 Chromospheric Versus Photospheric Activity
Lockwood et al. (2007) and Hall et al. (2009) used Ca ii H&K data, from Mt. Wilson Obser-
vatory, and Strömgren b, y photometry, from Lowell and Fairborn Observatories, collected
over a time lapse of over two decades to study the relation between photospheric and chro-
mospheric variability for a wide sample of solar-like stars. The main conclusion of these studies
can be summarized as follow: on a year-to-year time scale, the young active stars become fainter
when their Ca ii emission increases; on the contrary, old-less active stars, including the Sun,
become brighter when their Ca ii emission increases. In >Fig. 10-15, HD 82885 and HD 20630
are shown as example of young active solar-like stars; their chromospheric and photospheric
light curves are anticorrelated. Instead, HD 146233 and HD 90508 are shown as example of old
low-active solar-like stars; their chromospheric and photospheric light curves are correlated. As
a matter of fact, young active solar-like stars are spot-dominated while older less active stars,
like the Sun, are faculae dominated.
Hall et al. (2009) highlight that the Sun is not peculiar among other solar-like stars; its
median photospheric variability is only slightly above the one of the solar analogs. For instance,
18 Sco (G2 V), one of the closest solar twins, with a photometric activity cycle of 7 year, exhibits
a chromospheric variability very similar to the solar one, with σ(log RHK) = 0.043 from 1994 to
2008, that is comparable to 0.040 for the Sun over the same period.
The existence of two classes of objects, one spot dominated, the other faculae dominated,
has been claimed also for magnetically active close-binary stars. Messina (2008) has analyzed
brightness and color variations on a long time scale (tens of years) in the U, B, and V bands of
a sample of these objects, finding that some of them become redder when they are fainter, as it
is expected from the presence of active regions mainly consisting of cool spots. Others instead
become bluer when they become fainter, i.e., when spots reach the maximum coverage. In such
a case, hot photospheric faculae dominate the color variation. The reasons why two classes are
present among the magnetically active close binaries is still unclear.

Transition-Region Lines as Probe for the Plasma Dynamics
From the analysis of UV emission lines, we can get constraints on the dynamo and atmospheric
heating models. For instance, the displacement of the spectral lines with respect to the photo-
spheric rest frame, i.e., their possible blue- or redshifts, as well as the shape of the line wings,
i.e., their broadening and eventual distortion, carries information on the plasma dynamics.
Understanding the plasma dynamic is key into the comprehension of quantitative details on the

energy transport and dissipation processes in stellar atmospheres. Actually, plasma dynamic is a
by-product of the heating mechanisms, whose precise nature is one of the major unsolved prob-
lems in solar and stellar physics. In the outer convection zone, gas kinetic energy is transformed
by turbulence into sound waves and electrodynamic perturbations. The latter are thought to
provide the bulk of coronal heating, because sound waves hardly propagate through the steep
temperature gradient of the transition region, even though the shock dissipation of pure acous-
tic waves is probably an important, although not main, heating source for the chromosphere
and the lower transition region (c.f., Judge et al. 2003, and references therein).
6.1 UV Line Shift Versus Temperature of Line Formation
The measured Doppler centroid of optically thin high-temperature lines reflects the emission-
measure-weighted net flow speed in a highly dynamic atmosphere. Hence, the empirical
dependence of their velocity shifts with temperatureprovides an important constraint on stellar
transition region dynamics.

514 10
Stellar Activity
Observations of the Sun show that transition region emission lines are, on average, red-
shifted, and that redshifts increase with increasing formation temperature up to about 10K. At
higher temperatures, the centroid velocities decrease, crossing over to blueshifts at T ∼10K,
reaching about −km s−(Peter and Judge 1999). The slope and the peak of the velocity
shift versus line formation temperature are different for active regions or quiet Sun, as shown
in >Fig. 10-16. Measurements of transition region line Doppler shifts have been obtained for

a number of other stars with IUE, HST, and FUSE. These measurements are full disk averages,
contrary to what is typically available for the Sun. When plotted against line formation temper-
ature, a solar-like behavior is apparent for late-type stars, with the maximum redshift occurring
at temperature that can be the same as for the Sun (e.g., α Cen A, see Pagano et al. 2004) or
higher (e.g., Procyon, see Wood et al. 1996) or lower (ξ Boo A, see Pagano et al. 2006) as shown
in > Fig. 10-16. There are, however, objects which behave differently. For instance, the very
active dM1e star AU Mic (log Lx/Lbol ∼−) hardly shows any redshifts and certainly shows no
conspicuous trend of line shift versus line formation temperature (Pagano et al. 2000; Redfield
et al. 2002). This is not expected because AU Mic has an average magnetic flux density much
larger than the solar average magnetic flux density,3 and redshifts of transition region lines in
solar active regions, where the magnetic field is strong, are twice as large as in quiet regions
(Achour et al. 1995). Also, transition region models computed for the Sun predict larger red-
shifts in regions permeated by strong magnetic fields than in quiet regions (Reale et al. 1996).
Several other models have been proposed to account for the redshifts observed for the Sun. For
instance, Peter et al. (2006) propose a 3D numerical model able to predict redshifts in transition
region lines; in this model, coronal heating is produced by Joule dissipation of the currents that
origin in the interaction of magnetic fields with the photospheric motion. Spadaro et al. (2006)
have successfully reproduced the temperature dependence of the persistent redshifts observed
on the Sun, together with the observed emission measure distribution over the entire range
log T [K] = .−., by using a hydrodynamic model accounting for small cool magnetic
loops (length scale of order 1 Mm), transient heating (timescales of order 20 s every 100 s), and
energy deposition spatially localized near the chromospheric foot points (nanoflares). Further
modeling developments are proposed by Hansteen et al. (2010) and Zacharias et al. (2011).
While these models are predictive for the Sun and other solar like-stars, it is clear that a general
model, including the dependence for the magnetic field strength, the magnetic filling factor,
the nonradiative heating rate, and the gravity, is required to shred light on the origin of stellar
transition region line redshifts.
6.2 Broad Wings in TR Lines
Other important clues on plasma dynamics come from the broad wings observed in TRs and
coronal emission lines (e.g., Linsky and Wood 1994; Wood et al. 1997). >Figure 10-17 shows
the strongest transition region emission lines of α Cen A. Broad wings are present in the
Si iiiλ 1,206 Å, N vλ 1,238 Å, Si ivλ 1,393 and 1,402 Å, and C ivλ 1,548 and 1,502 Å line pro-
files. These lines are reproduced by one narrow Gaussian component that fits the line core and
one broad Gaussian component that fits the broad wings. This bimodal structure of the tran-
sition region lines is typically observed for main-sequence-type stars (e.g., AU Mic, Procyon,
and α Cen A & B), giants (e.g., 31 Com, β Cet, β Dra, β Gem), rapid rotator PMS stars (e.g.,
AB Dor), and several RS CVn-type stars (e.g., Capella and HR 1099) (cf., Linsky and Wood
1994; Linsky et al. 1995; Pagano et al. 2000).
The broad and narrow Gaussian components have generally comparable intensity and their
flux ratio is independent of the activity level of the star.
Wood et al. (1997) showed that the narrow components can be produced by turbulent wave
dissipation or Alfven wave-heating mechanisms, while the broad components – that resemble
3B f = 2,300 G and 15 G for AU Mic and the Sun, respectively, where f is the fractional area coverage of the
magnetic field B

Transition region lines of α Cen A (from Pagano et al. 2004), presenting a bimodal structure made
by a narrow core and broad wings. Thisstructureistypically observed for magnetic activestars. The
broad wings have been interpreted as signature of highly dynamic explosive events in the lower
atmosphere, but they can be due to the structure of and ﬂows in the chromospheric network
the explosive events on the Sun and whose strength correlate with activity indicators like the
X-ray surface flux – can be interpreted as a signature of “microflare” heating. Using FUSE
data, Redfield et al. (2002) showed that there is a trend of decreasing relative importance of
the broad components with increasing line formation temperature. Hence, assuming that the
broad components are signature for “microflare” heating as inferred by Wood et al. (1997), the

Stellar Activity 10
517
spectroscopic impact of “microflare” heating might be more important in the lower TR than at
log T (K) = 5.5, where the O vi lines are formed.
However, the comparative analysis of a full-Sun VUV spectrum, based on a raster scan of
the whole solar disk using SUMER/SOHO, with the HST/STIS spectrum of α Cen A, led Peter
(2006) to conclude that the broad components of disk-integrated stellar spectra do not contain
much information on the coronal heating mechanism but rather provide valuable input on the
structure of the magnetic network.
On the other hand, the very young Sun-like star EK Dra (G1.5 V), observed with HST/COS
by Ayres and France (2010), shows broad Si iv 1,400 Å lines having both the narrow and the
broad components highly redshifted. Such a scenario is in contrast with the association of the
broad component with explosive events but is instead suggestive of a “coronal rain” made of the
T ∼6 × 10K gas continually accreting onto the lower atmosphere.
Bimodal Gaussian profiles have been observed also for luminous cool stars thanks to FUSE
observations by Dupree et al. (2005), who argue that the broad wings are due to an opacity effect
in the cool dense wind of these stars, even though Peter (2006) suggests that this interpretation
is not unique.
Ayres et al. (1998) have found very broad FUV emission lines in moderate-mass(∼2–3 M⊙)
giants staying in the Hertzsprung gap (spectral types early F to mid-G) and in the post-helium
flash “clump” (∼G8–K0), suggesting that the transition region gas (T = 10K) extends out to
one R∗above the photosphere, i.e., about 50 scale heights. Fast rotator gap giants show supra-
rotational broadened FUV line profiles which are generally asymmetric, with profile distortions
possible signatures of Doppler-shifted surface structures. Instead, slowly rotating clump giants
show transition region lines narrower and more symmetric.
For some rapidly rotating stars, broad wings have been attributed to prominence-like,
extended structures of cool (10–10K) gas at 2–3 stellar radii, similar to the “slingshot promi-
nences” seen in Hα forthe young, rapid rotatorABDor(Collier-Cameron et al. 1999; Vilhu et al.
1998), and the extended loops inferred by Mg ii h&k Doppler imaging for AR Lac (Pagano et al.
2001).
Extending the stellar observations to higher temperatures, as in the solar work, is not
straightforward as discussed in the >Sect. 6.3.
6.3 UV Coronal Forbidden Lines
The UV spectrum is extremely interesting also for the study of the coronal dynamics. Observing
the plasma dynamics to higher coronal temperaturesis relatively easy on the Sun, because many
suitable strong coronal permitted lines (e.g., Mg x λ 61.025 nm) fall in the Lyman continuum
region immediately below 91.2nm, where high-resolution far-UV spectroscopy still is practical.
Unfortunately, these key features are not accessible even in the nearest stars owing to interstellar
extinction. High-resolution spectroscopy of permitted coronal X-ray lines, say in the important
iron-L shell band at 1 keV, is not feasible at present, because contemporary high-energy mis-
sions like Chandra and XMM-Newton fall short in spectral resolution by an order of magnitude,
and we must account on future missions to push that limit.
Coronal spectroscopy of active stars at high resolution has been possible up to date only
thanks to the observations of coronal forbidden lines in the UV and FUV spectrum, e.g.,
Fe xviii λ 974 Å, Fe xix λ 1,118 Å, Fe xii λ 1,242 and 1,349 Å, and Fe xxi λ 1,354 Å (cf., Pagano
et al. 2000; Ayres et al. 2003; Redfield et al. 2003). As shown in >Fig. 10-18 for the Fe xxi λ

1,354 Å, centroids of coronal lines of a number of late-type giants and M dwarfs fall at rest
with respect to the photosphere; hence, the high-temperature plasma is not participating in any
large systematic mass motions, but it is likely confined in stable magnetic structures. Moreover,
the measured widths of the coronal forbidden lines are generally close to their thermal values
(FWHM 40–90 km s−at T ∼10.–10.K), except for some of the fastest rotating stars in the
observed sample (AB Dor, 31 Com, and the G1 star of Capella) all showing broadening exceed-
ing the convolution between the thermal and the rotational widths, consistently with excess
turbulence or with emitting regions at ∼0.4–1.3 stellar radii from the photosphere.

Stellar Coronae
Main diagnostic of the stellar corona is the X-ray emission due to the thermal plasma at
temperature from 10to 10K and the radio emission due to the electrons moving in the
magnetic fields of the loop-like structures.
7.1 X-Ray Emission from Stellar Coronae
The first identification of coronal emission from other stars besides the Sun is that reported
by Catura et al. (1975) who observed the binary system Capella with a rocket experiment in
1974. Then, Capella and Sirius have been revealed as soft X-ray sources by the ANS satellite
(Mewe et al. 1975), and some RS CVn-type binaries have been detected in soft X-rays with

HEAO-1 (Walter et al. 1978; Walter et al. 1980). It was the Einstein satellite, the first X-ray
observatory with imaging capability, that allowed Vaiana et al. (1981) to show that X-ray emis-
sion is present throughout the HR diagram with the exception of B-A stars and red giants. Since
then, a number of X-ray observatories have contributed to the understanding of the physics of
stellar coronae, including the high-sensitivity and high-spatial-resolution Chandra and XMM-
Newton satellites that have been at work since 1999. The X-ray emission in stellar coronae
is mainly due to bound-bound emission (lines) dominating below 10K, free–free emission
(bremsstrahlung) dominating above 10K, free–bound emission and bound–free absorption
which determine the continuum, and emission decay from a metastable state in helium-like
ions. Excellent reviews on stellar coronae have been done by Favata and Micela (2003) and
Güdel (2004); even not recent, these reviews cover most of the last discoveries in the field being
the bulk of novelties carried by Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories very well exploited
at the time of their redaction.
The first comprehensive survey of all F and G stars within 13 pc from the Sun was made by
ROSAT, whose main result is that all the solar-type stars have a corona. In the ROSAT band
(0.1–2.4 keV), F and G dwarfs have luminosity in the range log LX ∼26.5–29.5 (erg s−), and
their X-ray luminosity is correlated to the brightness temperature of the plasma, i.e., the star is
more luminous when its coronal plasma is hotter. Moreover, the minimum flux of F to M dwarfs
(∼erg s−cm−) corresponds to the emission of solar coronal holes (cf. >Fig. 10-19).
M dwarfs have coronal emission up to a spectral type of M8 (Randich 2000 and references
therein), well beyond the border with the fully convective stars. Actually, late M dwarfs are as
efficient coronal emitters as other cool stars in terms of LX/Lbol. Also, young (10–10year)
brown dwarfs have coronal emission. Preibisch and Zinnecker (2002) with Chandra/ACIS
found brown dwarfs with LX/Lbol ∼−−−and T = 1–2 keV, a situation similar to that

Stellar Activity
of low-mass stars, the brightest emitting in a saturation regime and the others at lower lev-
els. Moreover, the young brown dwarfs are more active with the emission close to saturation,
while the old seem to have X-ray emission mainly as flares. For instance, the sensitive X-ray
data from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) allowed Preibisch et al. (2005) to
study 10-day-long X-ray light curves, showing that the X-ray properties (spectra, fractional
X-ray luminosities, flare rates) of the young brown dwarfs are similar to those of the low-mass
stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and thus there is no evidence for changes in the
magnetic activity around the stellar/substellar boundary, which lies at M6 for ONC sources.
The active binaries (RS CVn, BY Dra, etc.) show X-ray emission with .< log LX <
.(erg s−). The low-resolution spectra indicate the presence of at least two components of
the plasma temperature at T ≅3 MK and T ≥10 MK. Their coronal luminosity does not depend
on the speed of rotation; they are under saturation with LX/Lbol ∼−(cf. >Sect. 7.1.1).
T Tauri stars have X-ray luminosity typically between 10 and 10times the solar X-ray
luminosity, with spectra harder than those of dwarf stars and with a higher frequency of flares.
A high fraction of PMS stars is in the saturation regime, with LX/Lbol ∼−(cf. >Sect. 7.1.1).
Typically, Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) are subluminous with respect to the weak-line T Tauri
stars (WTTS) (Flaccomio et al. 2003; Preibisch et al. 2005). The analysis of PMS stars surveyed
with COUP (Getman et al. 2008a, b) has shown that X-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating disk-
free PMS stars (WTTS) can significantly exceed the Keplerian corotation radius, whereas X-ray
loop sizes in CTTS, i.e., disky and accreting systems, do not exceed the corotation radius. This is
consistent with a picture of star-disk magnetic interaction in which the inner disk truncates and
confines the PMS stellar magnetosphere. The current understanding is that in CTTS, X-rays
are produced by two plasma components: (i) a hot low-density plasma, with frequent flaring
activity, and (ii) a high-density lower temperature plasma. The former is coronal plasma related
to the stellar magnetic activity. The latter component, never observed in non-accreting stars,
could be plasma heated by the shock formed by the accretion process. Recently, high-resolution
X-ray spectra of a few CTTS enabled measurement of individual emission lines sensitive to
plasma density (i.e., He-like triplets). The majority of CTTS for which the O vii triplet lines
were detected showed cool plasma with high density, ne > cm−(e.g., Argiroffi et al. 2007;
Robrade and Schmitt 2006). In contrast, the cool quiescent plasma of active stellar coronae is
always dominated by low densities (ne < cm−, e.g., Testa et al. 2004; Ness et al. 2002b).
This suggests that the high-density cool plasma in CTTS is not a coronal one but instead heated
in accretion shocks. One complication is that mass accretion rates derived from assuming a
very high efficiency of conversion of accretion energy into X-rays tend to be about one order
of magnitude lower than rates derived using other methods (e.g., Günther et al. 2007; Schmitt
et al. 2005).
7.1.1 Saturation and Supersaturation
>Figure 10-20 shows the ratio LX/Lbol versus the Rossby number R= Prot/τc (in a log −log
scale). For intermediate and slow rotators, LX/Lbol ∝R
(cf., Randich 2000). For fast rotators,
LX becomes a unique function of Lbol, with LX/Lbol ∼−regardless of the rotation period
(e.g., Pallavicini et al. 1990). Saturation occurs at Rossbynumbers ofabout 0.1 in stars ofspectral
types G, K, and M. This relationship implies that the different spectral types have a different level
of maximum brightness under saturation. In particular, low-mass stars in saturation regime
have lower LX than higher mass stars; thus they reach maximum levels at greater rotation period

X-ray activity level, given asfraction of X-ray to thebolometric luminosity, asfunction of the Rossby

(i.e., lower rotation speed). Pizzolato et al. (2003) show that the period for which the activity is
at saturation regimes ranges from 1 day for early dG stars up to ∼4 days for early dM stars.
Coronal activity turns down again at rotation rates ∼5 times faster than required for satura-
tion; this is the so-called “supersaturation” regime. Examples of supersaturated G and K stars,
with LX/Lbol ∼−., have been found in young open clusters and among the fast-rotating
components of contact W UMa binaries. Among other hypotheses, supersaturation has been
explained as the result of an overall decrease of dynamo efficiency at very high rotation (e.g.,
St¸epie`n et al. 2001) or as the effect of a reorganization of the coronal magnetic field (e.g., Solanki
et al. 1997) or centrifugal stripping of the corona (Jardine 2004).
Jeffries et al. (2011) find that supersaturation is not displayed by M dwarfs. Jeffries et al.
(2011) suggest that the rotation period instead of the Rossby number is a more accurate predic-
tor of the onset of supersaturation, typically occurring for Prot < .d. In the hypothesis that
supersaturation is associated with topological changes in the coronal magnetic field as a conse-
quence of the fast rotation rate, as it is for the “centrifugal stripping” model by Jardine (2004),
then M dwarfs should supersaturate at shorter periods than K dwarfs, by factors of up to ∼2.
Determining the X-ray emission from a small sample of rapidly rotating (P < .d) M dwarfs
would resolve this issue.
7.1.2 Variability of Coronal Emission and Coronal Cycles
Coronal emission can vary both on short time scale – e.g., rotational modulation and flares –
and on long time scale according to activity cycles. Stellar rotation periods are generally longer
than typical duration of X-ray observations; for this reason, rotational modulation of X-ray

Circles and triangles have used for data acquired during the ﬁrst and second covered rotations,
respectively
K0 V AB Dor, and by Stassun et al. (2006) for a number of young stars in the ONC. AB Dor as
well as many of the stars in ONC showing rotational modulation are fast rotators with an X-ray
emission in the saturation regime. VXR45 is even in supersaturation regime. The presence of
X-ray rotational modulation in these stars indicates a substantial inhomogeneity in the spatial
distribution of active regions. Hence, saturation (and supersaturation) are not related, at least
for these objects, to the filling amount of the stellar surface with active regions.
X-ray stellar cycles are instead elusive. The X-ray luminosity of the Sun follows a cycle with
the same periodicity as the chromospheric cycle but with a much larger amplitude up to a factor
of 100 in the Yohkoh 0.73–2.5 keV band (Acton 1996). For other stars, cycles have been detected
only for α Cen B (Ayres 2009), 61 Cyg (Hempelmann et al. 2006), and HD 81809 (Favata et al.
2008), all solar-like stars with moderate activity. HD 81809 is a close visual binary of slow rotat-
ing solar-like stars (G2 V+G9 V) with a well-defined chromospheric cycle (Baliunas et al. 1995).
XMM-Newton observations have clearly shown the occurrence of a coronal cycle on this star
that has been modeled by Favata et al. (2008) with a simple extension of the solar case in terms
of varying coverage of solar-like active regions, having large filling factor than in the solar case
(cf. >Fig. 10-22-right). The binary stars in 61 Cyg – K5 V (A)+ K7 V (B) – observed by XMM-
Newton in the X-rays (0.2–2.0 keV) show both short time scales and long-term variations. In
particular, 61 Cyg A has a clear coronal cycle phased with the chromospheric activity cycle
(cf. > Fig. 10-22-left). The changes of coronal properties during the cycle resemble the solar
behavior. The coronal activity of 61 Cyg B is more irregular but also follows the chromospheric
activity (Robrade et al. 2007). The close-by α Cen triple system, made by a G2 V (A), a K1 V
(B), and the M5 V Proxima Centauri (C), has been monitored by all available X-ray observato-
ries since the 1980. For α Cen B, Ayres (2009) confirmed the presence of a coronal cycle with
period of 9 years (as the chromospheric cycle) and a depth of a factor ∼6, comparable to the
depth of the solar coronal cycle (∼5), while for α Cen A, he did not found any significantly
variation in the 0.2–2.0 keV “ROSAT” band, despite its dramatic fainting in the high-energy

tail of the coronal spectrum observed by XMM-Newton since 2003 (Robrade et al. 2005). The α
Cen A behavior in the X-ray reminds the Sun’s magnetic activity cycle, where the 2–3 MK active
regions of sunspot maximum give way to the spatially pervasive, but cycle-independent, 1 MK
quiet corona at minimum. The average coronal luminosity of α Cen B is a factor of 2 higher
than that of the Sun, while α Cen A is a similar factor lower, making this star a good candidate
as a star in a Mounder-like magnetic minimum.
Coronal cycles are not detected in more active stars, possibly because stochastic variability
is prevalent in these objects. Moreover, any discussion of X-ray cyclic coronal variability in
low-activity stars will depend crucially on the energy coverage of the measurements.
7.1.3 Coronal Abundances
High-resolution X-ray spectra provide information on coronal abundances (essentially C, N,
O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, Ni). Two different methods have been used to investigate stellar
coronal abundance: (i) global spectral modeling that includes the determination of key elemen-
tal abundances and the emission measure distribution and (ii) ratio of emission lines that have
a similar emissivity versus temperature distributions. On the Sun, coronal abundances do not
reflect the photospheric composition. Although the actual abundances depend on which part
of the corona is observed (with coronal holes, active regions, and flares showing quite differ-
ent abundance patterns), full disk spectra show the so-called FIP (first ionization potential)
effect (Feldman 1992). Essentially, elements having first ionization potential ≥10 eV (high FIP),
like Fe or Mg, have photospheric composition, while elements having first ionization poten-
tial ≤10 eV (low FIP), like Ne and O, are overabundant by about a factor 4, on average, with
respect to photospheric values (Feldman and Laming 2000). An explanation for the FIP effect

524 10
Stellar Activity
is that low-FIP elements are mainly ionized in the solar chromosphere (T ∼5,000–10,000 K),
while high-FIP elements are mainly neutral; hence, the ionized elements are easily transported
upward in the corona, where they result more abundant than the neutral elements. What about
abundances in the stellar coronae? Early measurements have been hampered by the different
results coming from different measurement methods. Also, the poor determination of photo-
spheric abundances especially in fast rotators have played a role. The general scenario we have
today is the following: a solar-like FIP effect is observed in cool, inactive stars. Instead, the so-
called inverse FIP (I-FIP) effect, in which high-FIP elements are overabundant in corona with
respect to low-FIP elements, is observed in extremely active RS CVn-type and Algol-type bina-
ries. No FIP bias has been observed for stars with intermediate activity. There are exception
of course; for instance, the cool, inactive Procyon should display a strong solar-like FIP effect.
Instead, it shows no FIP bias (e.g., Sanz-Forcada et al. 2004). Wood and Linsky (2010) find a
clear dependence of the FIP bias on spectral type as shown in >Fig. 10-23, with the earlier type
stars having solar-like FIP effects and the later stars having inverse FIP effects, though the lack of
photospheric abundance measurements for the M dwarfs (for which solar photospheric abun-
dances have been assumed) means that conclusions about them are more uncertain. Anyway,
no dependence of the degree of “FIP effect” on activity has been observed.
7.1.4 Density and Temperature Structure of Stellar Coronae
The first coronal densities were obtained from EUV spectra by measurementsof the flux ratio of
Fe lines originating from the same ionization state. As reviewed by Bowyer et al. (2000), the gen-
eral scenario emerging from such measurements is that low-temperature plasma (T ∼MK) is
associated with low-density plasma, with ne ∼–cm−, while plasma at high temperature
(T ∼MK) is typically denser, with ne ∼. For the sake of comparison, typical solar active

regions have density ne ∼, with ne > during solar flares. The bimodal temperature/
density structure emerging from EUVE data is eventually due to the lack of resolution of the
temperature diagnostics.
Chandra and XMM-Newton have allowed density measurements thanks to the resolution
of He-like triplets. The ratios between the forbidden and the intercombination line fuxes are
sensitive to the electron density, the forbidden line being suppressed in high-density environ-
ments. The densities to which He-like transitions are sensitive increases with the formation
temperature of the ion. In this way, each triplet can diagnose densities in different temperature
ranges. These measurements have confirmed the trend observed by EUVE: plasma associated
with warmerregions has higherdensity, but with the indication ofa continuous transition rather
than a dichotomy as shown in >Fig. 10-24. However, this trend may in part be affected by a
bias due to the fact that triplets formed at higher temperatures are sensitive to higher values of
density.
Density values obtained from the analysis of He-like triplets can be influenced by radiation
pumping due to UV photons generated in chromosphere. Ness et al. (2002a) show that neglect-
ing the influence of UV radiation field can lead to higher densities up to an order of magnitude.
This effect is more pronounced for low-Z ions and hence for plasma at lower temperature.More-
over, this effect is important for stars such as Algol, for which the UV radiation field comes from
the nearby hot companion. The high-density values obtained by Chandra and EUVE spectra
have been questioned. For instance, for the active binary σ CrB, the Fe xxi and Fe xxii He-like
triplets yield a density ne of few times cm−while a density ne < cm−is derived from

the Mg xi, despite these ions have similar formation temperatures (Osten et al. 2003). Also, line
blends could systematically bias the measured line-flux ratios. In fact, many of the density mea-
surements are near the low-density limit, so that even a small amount of blending or calibration
problems can lead to inaccurate values of density, where only an upper limit would have to be
estimated (e.g., Drake 2001). The resolution of this issue requires very high spectral resolution
and is hence linked to the availability of next-generation X-ray telescopes.
The presence in the same corona of plasma with density ne ranging from to cm−– if
it is real – is not compatible with the plasma being confined in quasi-static flux tubes. In fact, in
this case, the higher density should occur in colder regions of the loop (Favata and Micela 2003).
Mewe et al. (2001) have proposed that the colder plasma (T ∼0.5–2 MK) is connected with
loops that have density similar to that of solar active regions, i.e., ne ∼–cm−, while the
hotter plasma (T ∼5–9 MK) is in compact loops with density ne ∼–cm−.
In the solar corona, the temperature of the plasma has a continuous distribution. Instead,
coronal spectra of active stars generally require at least two temperature components to be
reproduced. This result has been achieved already by the Einstein observatory despite its IPC
detector had a very limited spectral resolving power (Schmitt et al. 1990), and was lately con-
firmed by subsequent X-ray observatories. Early investigations were aimed to understand if the
2-T (sometimes 3-T) structure is real or the result from the parameterization of a more com-
plicated temperature structure with features having different temperature. Actually, using data
from the solar corona observed by the Yohkoh satellite and reducing them to appear as if they
had been observed by ROSAT, Orlando et al. (2000) found that the solar spectrum taken at the
minimum of solar activity is reproduced by optically thin plasma emission model with tempera-
ture T ∼MK, while 2-T components are required by the solar spectrum taken at the maximum
of solar activity. The same technique applied at the spectrum of a solar flare shows the presence
of plasma also at T > MK (Orlando et al. 2001). Hence, the presence of both cold and hot
plasma seems related to the level of activity.
High-resolution spectroscopy has been very important to demonstrate that superimposed
to a continuous distribution of the emission measure versus temperature,there are features that
trace specific coronal components. Differential emission measure (DEM) distribution charac-
terizes the temperature structure of the coronal plasma. Many techniques have been developed
to derive DEM from X-ray or EUV spectroscopic data that resulted to be a continuous function
overa wide range oftemperatures. Forthe veryactive stars, the DEMshows a significant amount
of plasma at high temperature (even tens of MK), with a peak around MK. It is particularly
interesting that the DEMs of stars very different from each other (single, binary, or evolved
MS) are very similar, in particular, all the very active stars show the “bump” at high temperature,
while low-activitystars donot show the high-temperature plasma (see, e.g., >Fig. 10-25). DEMs
and density measurements together suggest that the hot plasma, responsible for the “bump,” is
also very dense, and is structured into spatially compact structures (loops). Ness et al. (2004)
argue that, going from low to high level of activity, the hotter plasma loops fill the space between
cooler loops until much of the corona is dominated by the hot plasma. As the magnetic activity
level and consequently the surface magnetic filling factor increases, the coronal magnetic fields
become denser, leading to increased interactions between neighboring field lines, which leads
to increased heating. In their most extreme form, such interactions lead to increased levels of
flaring, again resulting in increased amounts of hot, luminous plasma. This picture is essen-
tially consistent with that described by Testa et al. (2004) and, earlier, by Güdel (1997) and
Drake et al. (2000).

Unless for tidally locked rapid rotators, the youth, characterized by the high rotation regime,
is the key element for a late-type star to have a high level of coronal activity. This implies that
with increasing age, the X-ray spectra become softer.
7.1.5 Coronal Versus Chromospheric and TR Emission
The correlation between coronal and chromospheric emissions have been firstly observed by
Ayres et al. (1981b) and Schrijver (1987). Relations among the chromospheric, transition region
and coronal emissions have been derived by Ayres et al. (1995) for samples of F-K dwarfs and
giants and by Fox et al. (1994) for RS CVn-type stars (cf. > Table 10-1). The F9-G2 “solar-
type” main-sequence stars have a significantly steeper slope in X-rays (0.1–2.4 keV) versus C iv
than the cooler G8-K5 dwarfs. The populous clump giants follow essentially the same behav-
ior as the cooler MS stars, showing a nearly 1:1 correlation between X-rays and C iv. However,
some F dwarfs, the Hertzsprung gap giants, and virtually all of the supergiants fall systemat-
ically to lower X-ray luminosities with respect to their transition region and chromospheric
luminosities.
The correlations between emission fluxes coming from different layers of the stellar external
atmosphere depend very little from the source spectral and luminosity classes (cf. >Fig. 10-26).
This suggests that a strong coupling between different atmospheric layers does occur. The flux–
flux correlations show less scatter if the “basal flux” is subtracted from the chromospheric line
fluxes (e.g., Ca ii and Mg ii), as is expected being the “basal” chromospheric emission not due
to magnetic dissipation.
Ayres et al. (1996) suggest that the nonlinearity of the corona-transition region flux–flux
relation is due to the increasing coronal temperatures with increasing activity (see >Sect. 7.1.4),
bringing a progressively larger fraction of the emission into the X-ray band.

7.2 Radio Emission from Stellar Coronae
Active stars show both quiescent and flaring radio emission. The quiescent flux, characterized
by slow variations on time scales of hours and days and a low level of polarization, has brightness
temperature –K, i.e., about 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than the coronal tempera-
tures measured in the soft X-rays. Actually, the radio emission is nonthermal – as suggested by
the relatively flat radio spectra – typically optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation originating
from the interaction of mildly relativistic electrons and magnetic fields (e.g., Gary and Linsky
1981; Güdel 1994). A comprehensive even not recent review on “stellar radio astronomy” is
given by Güdel (2002). Here we summarize the principal aspects of radio emission as observed
in different categories of active stars. Radio flares will be discussed in >Sect. 10.
RS CVn stars constitute one of the major classes of stellar system radio sources. Their
radio observations allow us to directly investigate nonthermal phenomena occurring in stel-
lar coronae. Chiuderi Drago and Franciosini (1993) reproduce their quiescent radio emission
assuming flares as the origin of the accelerated electrons responsible for the gyrosincrotron

emission. However, HR 1099, a typical RS CVn system, shows low-level radio emission last-
ing for several weeks with no detectable flare events (Umana et al. 1995). Apparently, the HR
1099 behavior cast doubt on the Chiuderi Drago and Franciosini (1993) model, but the pos-
sibility that accelerated electrons come from a multitude of undetected microflares cannot be
ruled out.
Radio interferometry performed with VLBI, able to provide ≲1 mas angular resolution, has
reveled a typical two-components structure for very active star; a compact, and often variable
core, plus an extended halo, the latter surrounding the whole system in case of active binaries
like the RS CVn’s (e.g., Mutel et al. 1985; Trigilio et al. 2001). VLBA observations of UX Ari
(a bright RS CVn binary system) revealed a 8.4-GHz radio source, having size comparable to
the projected separation of the binary components, circularly polarized and with a polariza-
tion gradient across the resolved source, suggesting the existence of interacting magnetic fields
between the components or a large magnetic loop anchored to one component (Beasley and
Güdel 2000). VLBA radio maps of Algol reveal two oppositely polarized radio lobes separated
1.4 times the active K star size (Mutel et al. 1998), i.e., a very different scenario with respect to
what can be expect in terms of solar analogy.
Late-type dKe-dMe stars, the so-called “flare stars,” have been widely observed in the radio
domain during both flares and quiescence (see White et al. 1989 for a VLA survey of nearby
flare stars). Also for these stars, gyrosynchrotron emission from mildly relativistic electrons is

considered the main origin of the observed radio luminosity. This interpretation is compat-
ible with a spectrum that decreases toward higher frequencies. However, some spectra show
a U-shaped behavior; the flux decreases with frequency until 5–8 GHz, and then increases to
higher frequencies. For example, Güdel and Benz (1989) measured the spectrum of UV Cet
from .to GHz and found that the flux decreased from .to GHz and rose from 
to GHz. They interpreted the observed spectrum as consisting of a nonthermal component
(gyrosynchrotron emission) dominant at low frequencies and gyroresonance emission from the
hot component of the corona plasma (that is detected in X-ray observations), which is domi-
nant at the higher frequencies. This scenario may be appropriate only for some stars and only
occasionally. In fact, White et al. (1994) showed that the observed 15 GHz fluxes of a sample of
dMe stars, whose X-ray observations reveal the presence of a hot plasma component, are too
low to be consistent with the Güdel and Benz (1989) interpretation. Leto et al. (2000) found that
the radio fluxes due to the free–free emission of the electrons in the coronal plasma of a small
sample of dMe stars lie far below the observed radio fluxes.
The radio corona of M active dwarfs has been resolved with VLBI/VLBA observations. For
instance, YZ CMi (M4.5 Ve) has a VLBA resolved corona at 3.6 cm with size of .± .the
stellar photospheric size, not changing even during a flare, and a brightness temperature of
.× K, consistently with that expected from gyrosynchrotron emission (Pestalozzi et al.
2000). UV Cet B has been resolved at 3.6 cm into two components separated by .R∗, oriented
along the axis of the binary orbit, i.e., parallel and very likely close to the stellar rotation axis
(Benz et al. 1998). The authors infer that large coronal loops extending to at least two stellar
radii are necessary to trap the mildy relativistic electrons responsible for the gyrosynchrotron
emission.
7.2.1 X-Ray Versus Radio Emission
Güdel and Benz (1993) and Benz and Güdel (1994) show that several classes of active stars and
solar flares follow the relation LX/LR ∼±(Hz) (cf. >Fig. 10-27), where LX is the soft X-
ray luminosity and LR the luminosity at 5–8 GHz, where the radio spectrum is typically flat. At
the origin of such a correlation, a physical link between the mechanisms of stellar coronal heat-
ing – whose X-ray emission is a signature, and particle acceleration, which determines the radio
waves, must exist; the electrons producing gyrosyncrotron radiation are generally assumed to
be the tail of an energetically important nonthermal population, producing the soft X-rays.
Active binaries, like the RS CVn’s, lie in the top-right corner of > Fig. 10-27. M dwarfs
obey the X-ray/radio relation shown in >Fig. 10-27; however, exceptions occur. For instance,
AU Mic, which is the most luminous nondegenerate X-ray source within 10 pc, has a very large
radiative output from the transition region and corona, LTR+corona/Lbol ∼−(Pagano et al.
2000), but a radio luminosity at 8.4 GHz at least ten times less than predicted by the X-ray/radio
relation (Leto et al. 2000).
Brown dwarfs have revealed very interesting behavior at radio wavelengths. In fact, they do
not obey the X-ray/radio relation, being their quiescent and flaring radio emission similar to
what is observed forlate Mdwarfs (Berger 2002: Berger et al. 2005), while theirX-rayluminosity
is by several orders of magnitude lower than expected according to the Güdel and Benz (1993)
relation. This means that particles are accelerated and emit in the magnetic fields around BDs;
however, there is not a corona in the sense of a hot thin plasma radiating X-rays.

Solar-Like Stellar Winds
The velocity structure, mass-loss rate, and ionization of the outflowing gas in the low-
temperature (about 10K) winds of late-type giants and supergiants can be inferred from
high-resolution spectra of optically thick UV resonance lines: e.g., H i, O i, Mg ii, and C ii.
Unfortunately, the winds of main-sequence stars like the Sun are too hot and too thin to be
detected by the same diagnostics used for late-type giants and supergiants.
Spectroscopic analyses of stellar HI Ly-α lines have proven to be the best way sofar to clearly
detect and measure weak solar-like winds (Wood 2004). The Ly-α profile of a dwarf star having
a solar-like wind changes from its initial appearance at the star because of absorption due to (a)
the stellar astrosphere, (b) the local interstellar medium, and (c) the heliosphere. By modeling
these absorption features, Wood et al. (2002) performed the first quantitative measurements
of mass-loss rates for G and K dwarf stars. As shown in >Fig. 10-28, their results suggest that
mass-loss rates increase with activity (from X-ray surface flux), except for very high activity
levels possibly because of fundamental changes in magnetic field topology (Wood et al. 2005).
The observed trend of mass loss increase with activity for solar-like stars suggests that mass loss

decreases with stellar age. The results obtained by astrospheric measured stellar winds allowed
Wood et al. (2005) to infer that the Sun has lost no more that 0.2% of its mass during its life
and that the stronger young solar wind suggested by astrospheric measurements makes it more
likely that the solar wind has played a role in the evolution of planetary atmospheres such as
that of Mars.

Stellar Activity Versus Age
As we have briefly anticipated in >Sect. 3.3, magnetic activity level changes during the stellar
life. This is a clear effect of the activity level dependence from rotation rate, which slows with
age. Actually, the spinning down is caused by the star losing angular momentum because of the
stellar wind and coronal mass ejections. The slowing down decelerates with time because the
stellar wind strength decreases with age with the decrease of the stellar activity itself.
Solar analogs (G0–5 V stars) with masses, radii, Teff, and internal structure (i.e., outer con-
vective zones) closely matching those of the Sun, with ages from ∼50 Myr to 9 Gyr, have been
the subject of multiwavelength observations in the framework of the “Sun in Time” program
(e.g., Guinan and Engle 2009). A similar project (“Living with a Red Dwarf”) has been carried
out for K5 V–M6 V red dwarfs (e.g., Engle and Guinan 2011). From these projects, reliable
rotation–age–activity relations and X-ray–UV (EUV) spectral irradiances over time have been
determined. As it is shown in >Fig. 10-29, the angular velocity Ω (∝/Prot) decreases with
age both for the dG and dM stars. From these studies, it is inferred that the young (ZAMS) Sun

sample of dM0–5 stars (From Guinan and Engle 2009)
was rotating more than ten times faster than today. For a given age, the dM stars have longer
rotation periods indicating that they spin down faster than the more massive G stars. The rapid
magnetic braking of dM stars is most likely due to more efficient dynamos (from their deeper
convective zones) and their lower masses.
As a consequence of their fast rotation, young stars have vigorous magnetohydro-
dynamic (MHD) dynamos and correspondingly strong coronal X-ray and transition
region/chromospheric FUV–UV emissions (up to several hundred times stronger than the
present Sun), as shown in > Fig. 10-30 for the solar-type stars. Specifically, the mean X-ray
luminosity of the solar analogues decreases by times from the youngest to solar-age stars in
the sample.
Also, the amplitudes of rotationally modulated light curves decreases with the stellar age,
as shown in >Fig. 10-31 for the G dwarfs. For instance, G dwarfs in the Pleiades (∼100 Myr)
have light variations in the range ∼0.06–0.12 mag while the solar light modulation is typically
∼1.2 mmag.

cal composition. Favata and Micela (2003) show the median X-ray luminosity of G and M
dwarfs as a function of stellar age from observations of star-forming regions, open clusters

the Sun at minimum, maximum, and ﬂaring phases (Adapted from Favata and Micela 2003 and
references therein)
and field stars (cf. >Fig. 10-32). The coronal emission level of solar-type stars, expressed in
terms of X-ray luminosity, remains almost constant until an age of year and then decreases
steeply until the solar age. Actually, a significant fraction of G dwarfs in clusters younger
than the Pleiades (∼100 Myr) emits at the saturation level, while in older clusters, all the stars
become non-saturated and the mean X-ray luminosity starts to decrease. For low-mass stars,
the decrease of LX with age starts at a later age. Most of the M dwarfs in the Pleiades and α Per
and part of ones in the Hyades are saturated. The different evolution of dM with respect to dG
stars can be explained as due to the dependence of rotational evolution on stellar mass; as dM
stars spin down more slowly, they will emit at the saturation level for a longer time.
Also, the EUV radiation (∼1–912 Å) decreases with stellar age. For a large sample of stars
with exoplanets, Sanz-Forcada et al. (2011a) have derived
log LEUV = (.± .) −(.± .) log τ
(10.6)
with τ the age in Gyr.
The dependence of X-ray luminosity from metallicity has been investigated, e.g., by
Pillitteri et al. (2003)whocomputed the X-rayluminositydistributions forF, G, K, and Mdwarfs
for NGC 2516, Blanco 1, and the Pleiades (cf. >Fig. 10-33). These clusters have the same age
(∼100 Myr), and metallicity values of Z ∼., , and Z⊙, respectively, hence are well suited to
explore the metallicity effects on coronal emission of young stars. The X-ray luminosity distri-
butions of F dwarfs in the three clusters are indistinguishable, while metal-poor G and K dwarfs

Flares
Stellar flares are unpredictable phenomena due to the sudden transformation of energy stored
in the magnetic field into thermal and kinetic energy. They involve the whole stellar atmosphere
from the photosphere to the corona, and their effects can be very important also for the stellar
planetaryenvironment. Excellent reviews on stellarflares have been those byHaisch et al. (1991)
and Linsky (2000). For a complete description of the solar flares, see Benz (2008).

Stellar Activity 10
537
Flares on the Sun occur in association to active regions, and their frequency is in phase
with the solar activity cycle. The radiation is emitted throughout the electromagnetic spectrum;
radio, optical, UV, X- and, gamma rays. The energy released during a medium solar flare is
typically of the order of erg s−, but they range between (nanoflares) and erg s−.
The most energeticflares are the white lightflares, i.e., those detected in broadband optical obser-
vations. The temperature of the flaring plasma is of the order of 10–20 MK but can reach up to
100 MK.
The first study in the literature concerning stellar flares is by Joy and Humason (1949)
who detected the continuum and emission lines rising in a spectrum of a dMe star, L726-8.
Observations of stellar flares, as of several astrophysical phenomena, have been driven by the
available instruments: blue photographic observations mainly of stars in open clusters in the
1960s–1970s; UBV photoelectric photometry of field stars in the 1970s–1980s; multiwavelength
spectroscopic campaigns (UV, optical, X-ray, radio, IR) in the 1980s–1990s; X-ray imaging
observations of single field stars and open clusters since the 1990s and serendipitous UV and
optical observations, e.g., with GALEX, SWIFT/UVOT, and SDSS recently.
10.1 Flaring Stars
Flares are observed on all the stars that show coronal type X-ray emission: the so-called “flare
stars,” brown dwarfs, active binaries (BY Dra, RS Cvn, FK Com type), T Tauri stars, hybrid stars,
and clump giants, both pre-He-flash and post-He-flash. In active binaries, there are evidence
of flares occurring in the circumstellar environment. In YSO, flares generally originate in the
interaction between coronal magnetic field and the accreting disk. Fully convective M dwarfs
and brown dwarfs show X-ray emission mostly during flares.
“Flare stars” or “UV Cet-type stars” are dwarfs of spectral type from late-Ge to M9e, with
the suffix e indicating the presence of emission lines in the optical spectrum (cf. Gershberg et al.
1999, for a detailed catalogue UV Cet-type flare stars). Typically, flare stars are rapid rotators
with respect to stars of the same spectral class without emission lines in the optical spectrum.
For instance, while vrot for M stars is ∼2 km s−, for dMe’s is ∼10 km s−(Marcy and Chen 1992).
Moreover, about 30% of dMe’s are in binary systems (Pettersen 1991). The flare star density in
the solar neighborhood is .starspc−(Shakhovskaya 1995). They have starspots in the pho-
tosphere as inferred by the observed rotational modulation of their light curves (Rodonò 1980).
The flare frequency for a typical UV Cet-type star has been measured in EUV, X-ray, and B-band
to be 0.16–0.37 flaresh−(Leto et al. 1997; Osten et al. 2005).
10.2 Flare Characteristics
Multiwavelength observations are essential for understanding the response of different atmo-
spheric layers to the catastrophic release of magnetic energy we call flare: radio waves carry
information on the role of nonthermal particles in the dynamics of flares; the optical contin-
uum and lines respond to the dramatic heating of the lower chromosphere and photosphere;
the UV/EUV emission lines provide an important source of plasma cooling, as well as lower
atmospheric heating, during the gradual phase of stellar flares, and thus are valuable diagnos-
tics of the flare evolution and the X-ray continuum and emission lines describe the response of
the thermal coronal plasma to the flare. Hence, flares can be considered as probes for the 3D
nature of the stellar external atmosphere.

538 10
Stellar Activity
Energy of stellar flares ranges from the erg s−of nanoflares to even erg s−of very
large flares in RS CVn-type binaries, implying that a common physical origin must exist in
order the manifestation of a similar phenomenology being possible despite the different energy
involved.
In the optical band (e.g., U band) flares from UV Cet-type stars are characterized by impul-
sive rise times, lasting from few seconds to few minutes, followed by an exponential decay, often
with multiple spikes (cf., >Fig. 10-34), lasting typically less than 1 h (cf. >Fig. 10-35-left). In
YSO, instead, the flare duration goes from one hour to several days (cf. >Fig. 10-35-right), as
shown by soft X-rays observations (Wolk et al. 2005).

Broadband optical continuum enhancements are easily recognizable only in the cooler
targets, like dKe and dMe stars, because of the high contrast between flares and their low photo-
spheric temperature. Instead, white light flares have been elusive in active binaries like RS CVn
or FK Com-type binaries, and only few observations are reported in the literature. For instance,
the long-lasting 9.8 days flare of YY Mem (K2 III), an FK Com-type star, with an energy output
in the UBV bands of ∼×erg corresponding to LUBV/Lbol ∼×−(Cutispoto et al. 1992).
A general correlation does exist between the time characteristics of a flare and its energy,
in the sense that large flares tend to last longer than small flares. Actually, the time scales of
flares depend from the flaring region, such as size, strength of the magnetic field where the
magnetic reconnection takes place, electron density, and flaring plasma temperature, rather
than the host star.
As summarized by Pettersen (1991), in some flare stars, flares appear to occur randomly
(Poisson distribution). However, flares occurring in groups (e.g., Umana et al. 1995), or indi-
cation of flaring activity concentrated at preferred stellar longitude (e.g., Leto et al. 1997 and
reference therein), have also been reported. A short-term cycle in flare occurrence (and also
in spots) has been identified on the RS CVn-type system UX Ari (Massi et al. 2005); this is
reminiscent of the short-term cycles (50–90 days) in the solar flare occurrence rate (see, e.g.,
Lou 2000).
10.3 Flare Classiﬁcation
Two main classes of stellar flares, one with short rise times – of order of minutes – and decay
times of order of a few tens of minutes and the other with longer rise times and very long decay
times, exceeding several kiloseconds, are observed also in the soft X-rays. The former are similar
to the solar “compact flares” which origin from the interaction of neighboring compact loops.
Their rise duration occurs on time scales smaller than the dynamical time scale of filament
eruption (van den Oord et al. 1988). The latterare reminiscent ofsolar“two-ribbon flares” which
happen in complex loop arcades (–km). “Two-ribbon flares” originate from the opening
up of magnetic fields due, for instance, to a filament eruption and the return to closed field
lines. However, the use of a classification scheme valid for solar flare is not straightforward in
some cases. In fact, there could be physical conditions very different than on the Sun, such as
significant tidal effects in close-binary stars, extremely dense packing of magnetic fields, polar
magnetic fields, magnetic fields from a distributed dynamo, inter-binary magnetic fields with
magnetospheres ofglobal dimensions, and star-disk magneticfields in pre-main-sequence stars.
10.4 The Flare “Standard Model”and the Neupert Eﬀect
A large number of flares can be described by the so-called “standard model”: the region where
the magnetic field reconnection takes place, i.e., where the flare starts, is located at the top of
coronal loops. Here electrons (and ions) are accelerated to energies up to a few MeV, so that
they emit gyrosyncrotron radiation and, running down along the magnetic field lines, reach
the “cold” chromospheric plasma. Here they produce hard X-ray photons at the impact and
heat the chromospheric plasma at temperatures typical of coronal plasma. In this way, part
of the chromosphere evaporates into the corona. Radio emission, hard X-ray emission, and
continuum optical emission from the heated chromosphere are related to each other within

seconds and trace the impulsive phase of flares. The soft X-rays, instead, are emitted when the
magnetic loop is filled with the gas that evaporates from the chromosphere; this occurs on time
scales of tens of seconds to minutes. Hence, in the “standard model” scenario, that applies in
the case shown in >Fig. 10-36, there is few minute delay between the onset of the flare in the
optical continuum (and radio or hard X-rays) and the onset of the soft X-rays emission.
If the “standard model” applies, the radio gyrosyncrotron emission, hard X-ray, and optical
continuum emission are induced on the time scales related to the traveling path of the elec-
trons (seconds) and then grow in proportion to the flow of high-energy particles, unless these
are blocked by some trapping mechanisms. Instead, the cooling time of the thermal plasma in
an extended coronal loop is governed by the mechanisms of radiation and conduction with
a time scale of several minutes up to hours. Since the soft X-rays are radiated proportionally
to the accumulated thermal energy, we have that LO,HXR,R(t) ∝dLX(t)/dt, with R, O, and
XHR meaning radio, optical and hard X-rays, respectively. This relation is known as “Neupert
effect.” Its observation is a good diagnostic for the chromospheric evaporation predicted by the
“standard model.”
The Neupert effect is observed for ∼50% of the impulsive solar flares and in some gradual
solar flare (Dennis and Zarro 1993). It has been clearly detected also for many stellar flares: e.g.,
flares from the dMe stars AD Leo and UV Cet (Hawley et al. 1995; Güdel et al. 1996) and from
the RS CVn-type binary HR 1099 (Osten et al. 2004), often with a ratio between the energy
losses in the two energy bands similar to the corresponding luminosity ratio “in quiescence.”
However, from flare to flare, we can still have large departures from the “standard model”
scenario. For instance, Haisch et al. (1981) describe an X-ray flare without an accompanying
signal in the optical or in the UV. As opposite case, Hγ and U band flares on YZ CMi have been
observed by Doyle et al. (1986, 1988) without a soft X-ray counterpart. Among the several “non
standard model” observations we have: an impulsive optical flare with following gradual radio

(Osten et al. 2000); the absence of any X-ray response during radio flares (e.g., Fox et al. 1994).
>Figure 10-37 shows the result of soft X-ray, radio and optical observations of the EV Lac
reported by Osten et al. (2005). The optical flare peaks 20 min after the impulsive X-ray event,
too far apart in time to causally connect under any realistic length scales or velocities. There
is a close temporal association between the large U-band flare and the radio flare, yet no indi-
cation of an accompanying X-ray flare exists. The long-observed timescales for radiative decay
of the radio emission implies low ambient electron densities (ne ∼cm−). As argued by the

542 10
Stellar Activity
authors, the lack of a soft X-ray counterpart for the optical/radio flare could be due to differ-
ent reasons; (i) the flaring structure has a too low density to produce soft-X-ray radiation4; (ii)
the flare involves only transition region plasma, as it was observed by Ayres et al. (2001) for
HR 1099; (iii) particles are trapped in the loop, so that very few of them precipitate to heat the
surrounding chromosphere and produce subsequent evaporation; or (iv) most of the energy
goes into accelerating particles (e.g., protons), which would allow deeper penetration of the
photosphere and produce continuum emission but no line emission or significant evaporation.
An important test for the “standard model” would be the detection of non-thermal hard
X-ray emission contemporary to the optical continuum impulsive phase. Despite the PDS
instrument on board the BeppoSAX satellite was sensitive enough, nonthermal hard X-rays
have not been detected even during large soft X-ray flares (e.g., Franciosini et al. 2001; Rodonò
et al. 1999).
10.5 Signature of Coronal Mass Ejections
A solar-like CME was observed during a ΔU ∼mag flare from AD Leo (Rodonò et al. 1988),
with the Hγ line showing a shift toward the blue of ∼6,000 km s−, that, in terms of kinetic
energy, corresponds to ∼× erg s−. The energy, mass and ejection velocity budgets are
∼400, 40 and 4 times higher than observed for typical solar CMEs.
A mass ejection episode has been detected also during a strong flare in the RS CVn-type
binary HR 1099. Its Mg ii h&k line profiles display very broad wings at flare peak, while the
mid-UV continuum is enhanced. By analyzing these data, Busà et al. (1999) concluded that
material was ejected by the secondary star in the direction of the primary.
A huge X-ray flare observed by Beppo-SAX on Algol (Favata and Schmitt 1999) reveals the
occurrence of a CME episode: during the initial (rising) phase of the flare the best-fit absorbing
column density is large, and decays on time scales of some tens of ks. The authors interpret this
as possibly associated with moving, cool absorbing material in the line of sight, i.e., a major
coronal mass ejection associated with the flare’s onset.
10.6 Flares and Coronal Heating
Although large flares are a conspicuous contributor to transient heating of stellar coronae,
smaller-scale events – the so-called microflares and nanoflares – might play a key role in the
“steady” heating of the outer layers of cool stars.
Does the energy input involve microflaring, and is therefore sporadic, or does it involve
MHD waves, electric current dissipation, and/or other effects which could be quasisteady? That
magnetic energy release occurring in discrete much smaller events than observed, i.e., involving
events of –erg s−, sustains the coronal heating has been proposed and widely accepted
by several authors (cf. Haisch et al. 1991; Parker 1988, and references therein). As quantified by
Hudson (1991), the flare driven coronal luminosity can be expressed as

where dN/dP is the number of flares versus power (or energy flux) per event, which empir-
ically follows a power-law distribution, dN/dP = kP−α, with k varying from star to star.
> Equation 10.7 shows that if α < , the coronal luminosity due to flares is dominated by
the large events, that are not enough to account for coronal heating. Instead, if the statistics
of micro/nano flares is such that α > , than Lf is dominated by small events. Hudson (1991)
argues that α ∼.for the total power in both the solar and stellar case for flares above some
threshold. Actually, our limited capability to detect low energy flares renders this one an open
topic. Robinson et al. (2001) studied the statistics of transient bursts in high time resolution UV
observations of AU Mic with HST/STIS, and concluded that the power-law slope of the occur-
rence rate versus time-integrated flux was considerably steeper for low-energy flares than for
the rarer high-energy ones, implying that microflares potentially can account for a significant
portion, if not all, of the coronal heating. However, this is such an important issue that more
conclusive evidence is needed: the investigation should be extended to a larger sample of flare
stars, collecting a significant number of events for each target.
Thanks to time resolution <0.01 s provided by time-tagged data, GALEX has serendipi-
tously detected a class of flares characterized by constant temperature during the flux increase.
Robinson et al. (2005) and Welsh et al. (2006) suggest these flares are due to avalanches of
nanoflares in a plage. Another class of flares detected by GALEX are characterized by the
increase of both flux and temperature during the flare development. These flares are proba-
bly the classical explosive events like the solar two-ribbon flares. GALEX data suggest also that
in the FUV (λeff ∼, Å), the flare flux is mainly due to C iv (∼50%), while weaker emission
lines and continuum provide the remaining 50%. In the NUV (λeff ∼, Å), flux is due to
Mg ii (10%), Fe ii (17%), Al ii and C iii (14%) plus continuum. Coronal lines provide 2% of the
FUV and 10% of the NUV fluxes.
10.7 Superﬂares
Superflares occur on main-sequence stars in spectral classes F8-G8 with no unusual proper-
ties (specifically rapid rotation, high chromospheric activity, close-binary companions, or very
young age). The observed superflare energy ranges from to erg s−. Their typical dura-
tion is about 1 h but ranges from a fraction of an hour up to days. Superflares emit radiation
at least from the X-rays to the optical, with indicated temperatures (Schaefer et al. 2000) from
15,000 K (from the He i emission line) to 10 keV (from X-ray continuum). The most accepted
theory for superflares is that they are caused by magnetic reconnection between fields of the
primary star and a close-in Jovian planet (Rubenstein and Schaefer 2000).

Stellar Magnetic Activity and Extrasolar Planets
The characterization of stellar activity is fundamental also to evaluate the conditions for hab-
itability of exoplanets. In the same way, the investigation of solar activity (Space Weather)
ultimately looks for the effects of solar activity on terrestrial life; the characterization of stel-
lar activity is required to understand the evolution of extrasolar planetary systems and of
the exoplanet atmospheres. Moreover, the capability to model stellar activity is required to

544 10
Stellar Activity
unambiguously detect the weak signature of a planet often buried in the stellar intrinsic noise
originating also from magnetic activity.
11.1 Stellar Magnetic Activity as Source of Noise
Magnetic activity is a source of noise in interpreting the radial velocity curves of stars hosting
exoplanets. In fact, it can produce radial velocity jitter larger than the amplitude of the radial
velocity variations associated to the planets, which for a 1 M⊕planet orbiting around a 1 M⊙
star amount to about 0.1–0.3 m s−for orbital semimajor axis of 1 and 0.1 AU, respectively. The
reason is that active regions induce disturbances in the shape of spectral lines. For instance,
the macro- and micro-turbulence parameters change because of the action of magnetic fields
on convective motions. In fact, if we consider convective cells far from surface magnetic fields,
upward motions dominate with respect to downward motions, determining blueshifted line
bisectors. Ifsurface magneticfields are present, the amount ofblueshift is reduced. Meunieret al.
(2010) show that convective blueshift in solar magnetized regions are reduced by ∼2 m s−up to
8 m s−. These authors suggest that this effect is the main source of radial velocity perturbations
in solar-like stars.
To extract the exoplanet signal from radial velocity curves of active stars hosting exoplan-
ets, Lanza et al. (2010, 2011) have used spots and faculae positions and filling factors derived
from spot modeling of stellar light curves to synthetize radial velocity time series that can be
compared with the observed ones to cancel the effect of stellar activity.
Magnetic activity is a source of noise also for the search and characterization of exoplanet
transits. The transit of a large group of spots on the solar surface causes a relative decrease in
the optical flux of .×−. For comparison, the Earth and Jupiter transits across the solar disc
produce a relative flux variation of the order of −and −, respectively. Therefore, to search
for planetary transits in the presence of stellar activity, several techniques have been developed
to filter out or fit the microvariability of the star (cf., e.g., Aigrain and Irwin 2004; Moutou et al.
2005; Bonomo and Lanza 2008; Bonomo et al. 2009).
Reducing the effect of magnetic activity is fundamental in modeling the exoplanetary transit
and occultation. For instance, during the transit, the planet passes in front of the star, partially
blocking the stellar light. The amount of this dimming is a direct measure of the relative size of
the planet compared to the size of the star (Rp/R∗). If the planet has an atmosphere, it is not
an opaque disk with a sharp edge. Instead, the opacity will gradually diminish with height as
the atmosphere becomes more tenuous. The stellar light that passes through the atmosphere is
absorbed by atoms and molecules or Rayleigh scattered. If at a given wavelength the atmosphere
has a low opacity, the stellar light travels through the planets atmosphere unhindered, while if
it has a high opacity, the atmosphere becomes transparent at a high altitude only. This results
in an increase in the observed planetary radius at wavelengths having a high opacity compared
to that at a low opacity. As a consequence, any observed wavelength dependence of the transit
depth can be used to probe the planet atmospheric composition. As it is intuitive, any effect on
the observed light curve due to stellar activity must be taken into account.
Ballerini et al. (2012) compare activity-induced flux variations in different passbands with
planetarytransits and quantifyhow theyaffect the determination ofthe planetary radius and the
analysis of the transmission spectroscopy in the study of planetary atmospheres. These authors
suggest that the monitoring of the systems by using broadband photometry, from visible to
infrared, helps us to constrain activity effects. The ratio of the relative variations in the stellar

Stellar Activity 10
545
fluxes at short wavelength optical bands (e.g., U or B) to near-infrared ones (e.g., J or K) can be
used to distinguish starspot brightness dips from planetary transits in a stellar light curve. In
addition tothe perturbations in the measurement ofthe planetaryradius, starspots can affect the
determinations of both the relative semimajor axis and the inclination of the planetary orbit,
which have a significant impact on the derivation of the stellar density from the transit light
curves.
11.2 Star Planet Interaction
Among the 755 extrasolar planets discovered up to February 2012, about 22% are massive
planets (Mp sin i > .MJ) in tight orbits (<0.1 AU) around their parent stars. Since the pio-
neering paper of Cuntz et al. (2000), star–planet tidal and magnetospheric interactions have
been claimed to be a possible cause of stellar activity increase. Observational support to the
Star–Planet interaction (SPI) phenomenon has been provided by several authors: e.g., Shkolnik
et al. (2003, 2005, 2008), who found chromospheric emission of stars hosting planets to be vari-
able with the planet orbital period. Space-based optical photometry may have also caught this
phenomenon. The variance of CoRoT-2 stellar flux is modulatedin phase with the planet orbital
period reaching a maximum near the time of transit (Pagano et al. 2009). Also, the MOST space
telescope found a spot that persisted for hundreds of rotation cycles on τ Boo (Walker et al.
2008), while Lanza et al. (2009a, 2010) report hints for SPI for CoRoT-4 and CoRoT-6. In sup-
port to the presence of SPI, Kashyap et al. (2008) claimed that stars with hot Jupiters have a
higher X-ray flux than stars with distant planets. On the contrary, Poppenhaeger et al. (2010)
found no evidence of X-ray emission bias for stars hosting extrasolar planets. The nature of
SPI appears to be strongly affected by both the stellar and planetary magnetic fields. Some SPI
models consider that conditions similar to those observed for the Jupiter-Io system are met and
consequently similar processes are expected to occur on far larger scales. However, a severe
limitation of such models is that the energy released in the interaction is about three orders
of magnitude smaller than needed to account for the observed chromospheric excess powers
(cf. Lanza 2009 and references therein). Other models consider that the localized reconnection
at the corona/planetary magnetospheric boundary can trigger a reconfiguration of the coronal
magnetic field on a large scale, comparable to the star–planet separation, thus accounting for
the energy budget of the star–planet magnetic interaction (SPMI), thanks to the large coronal
volumes involved in the energy release (cf., e.g., Lanza 2009; Cohen et al. 2009). A review on
SPI has been given by Lanza (2011).
11.3 Stellar Activity Eﬀects on Exoplanet Atmospheres
One of the most important factors affecting the planetary atmospheric evolution and water
inventories is the activity associated with the chromospheres and coronae of the planets’ host
stars. The relevant physical phenomena include intermittent and energetic flares, coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), high energetic stellar radiation, enhanced coronal X-rays, and increased
chromospheric UV emission which can ionize, heat, expand, chemically modify, and erode the
atmospheres of terrestrial planets during the early phase of their evolution (e.g., Lundin et al.
2007; Scaloet al. 2007; Lammer2009). Much ofthe photochemistryin the planetaryatmosphere
is driven by the shorter wavelength photons and, therefore, our knowledge of the EUV and UV

546 10
Stellar Activity
spectra and their variability is critical. X-rays, EUV, and UV photons produce effects at different
heights in the atmosphere of the planet, with X-rays penetrating deeper in the atmosphere and
EUV/UV radiation mainly ionizing the atoms in the upper atmosphere.
As discussed by Lammer et al. (2011), upper atmosphere of Earth-like planets should
experience non-hydrostatic conditions so that dynamically outward flowing neutral atoms can
interact with the stellar plasma flow so that huge hydrogen coronae and energetic neutral atoms
(ENA) can be produced via charge exchange. Valuable diagnostics of these features are the size
of the extended upper atmospheres and the velocities of the surrounding hydrogen atoms.
Sanz-Forcada et al. (2010, 2011a) have studied a large sample of planet-hosting stars for
which X-ray observations are available. By using the observed and synthesized X-ray and EUV
SEDs, respectively, these authors conclude that massive planets (Mp sin i > .MJ) may survive
only if exposed to low accumulated coronal radiation. For instance, the planet HD 209458 b
(∼.MJ, a ∼.AU) might have lost more than 1 MJ already, and other cases, like τ Boo
b, could be losing mass at a rate of 3.4 M⊕/Gyr. Sanz-Forcada et al. (2011b) point out that the
strongest erosive effects would take place during the first stages of the stellar life, as expected
given the dependence of coronal activity from age and that planets with higher density resist
better the radiation effects, as shown in >Fig. 10-38. Given the rapid growing of the research
on exoplanets, both on the experimental and theoretical sides, we expect that modeling of the

Abstract:
White dwarfs are the final stage for more than 95% of all stars. Their population
statistics and properties contain a wealth of information about the history of star formation in
our galaxy, the ages of stellar systems, and the relation between original mass at birth and that of
the final remnant. They are also interesting individually as laboratories for physical conditions
not easily reached in terrestrial labs: macroscopic manifestation of the Pauli principle, high den-
sities and pressures, and extremely high magnetic fields. After a brief introduction with some
historical milestones the observational status is reviewed: spectroscopic classification, determi-
nation ofstellarparameters from spectroscopicand photometricobservations, effective temper-
atures, surface gravities, radii, and masses.The next sections deal with the physics of the interior
and evolution of white dwarfs, leading to the mass–radius relation and cooling times. Going
back closer to the observations again, the physical processes in the outer layers are discussed:
gravitational separation, diffusion, radiative levitation, accretion, and convective mixing. This
leads to a review of our current understanding of the origin of spectral types and their interre-
lation. A final section gives brief introductions to topics at the center of current research: white
dwarfs in open and globular clusters, debris disks, the origin of accreted metals in the atmo-
spheres, magnetic fields and their origin, variable white dwarfs, and white dwarfs in binaries.
This chapter was finished in February 2010 and reflects the status of knowledge at that time.
Keywords: Accretion, Chandrasekhar mass, Convective mixing, Debris disks, Gravitational

Introduction
White dwarf stars are one of the known final stages of stellar evolution, besides neutron stars
and black holes. With typical masses of /the solar mass and radii of /the solar radius
they are very compact objects with interior densities of the order of g cm−. Their existence,
the mass–radius relation, and the limiting Chandrasekhar mass are macroscopic manifesta-
tions of the Pauli principle for fermions and the electron degeneracy following from it. White
dwarfs (WDs) thus offer cosmic laboratories with physical conditions that cannot be achieved
in terrestrial laboratories. The study of their structure and evolution tests our understanding
of the equation of state under these extreme conditions. A fraction of at least 10% of all WDs
show magnetic fields of up to G in their atmospheres; this is much smaller than the fields
in neutron stars, but still much larger than any fields studied in terrestrial labs. This range of
field strengths is also a very difficult one to study theoretically, because Coulomb and magnetic
fields in the atoms are of comparable strength and perturbation methods cannot be applied.
Observations of magnetic WDs are the only possibility to test the predictions of energy levels
and transition probabilities for the hydrogen and helium atoms, where such calculations are
available.
Physical conditions are even more extreme in neutron stars and black holes. The advantage
in the case of WDs is that their surfaces can be observed directly and studied with the classical
methods ofspectroscopyand stellaratmosphere modeling, giving reliable data foreffective tem-
peratures, surface gravities, chemical abundances, and the parameters derived from these data
as masses,radii, and ages. Using these methods,a detailed understanding of the basic properties
of WDs and their evolution has accumulated, although some even fairly fundamental questions
are not yet fully understood.

White Dwarf Stars
There is as well a large interest in WDs beyond the community studying the physical prop-
erties of these objects, which is related to the use as a tool to study completely different aspects
in other astrophysical areas. The spectra of the vast majority of WDs are very simple and can
be modeled theoretically with high accuracy and confidence to better than 1% of the absolute
flux. They are therefore primary candidates for the calibration of spectrographs and have been
used for that purpose on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and many other spacecraft, as well
as on many terrestrial telescopes.
About 95–98% of all stars end their nuclear life as a WD, and the final state of the universe
is therefore one in which almost the total baryonic mass is converted into WDs, with some
minor fraction in the galactic central black holes, neutron stars, and stellar black holes. The
present population of WDs preserves information about the star formation rate throughout
the history of our galaxy. The relation between the mass of a WD and that of its progenitor
star on the main sequence (MS) indicates the total, integrated mass loss during the evolution.
These are important data for an understanding of the mass budget of the galaxy: how much is
locked up forever in remnants and how much is given back to the interstellar medium and can
be used again for star formation? Since there is not yet a theory for the mass loss in all phases
of stellar evolution, and since the observation is difficult especially in the latest phases on the
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), where mass loss is strongest, this is currently the only method
to get reliable data.
The oldest white dwarfs in the solarneighborhood belong tothe oldest objects in the galactic
disk. Since it is possible to estimate their ages from theoretical evolutionary calculations, this
gives a lower limit for the beginning of star formation in the disk. WDs in open and in globular
clusters offer new and independent methods for age as well as distance determinations, which
are often strongly coupled when using the traditional main sequence fitting method.
A rather new area of research concentrates on the study of dust and gas disks detected in
the infrared around a significant fraction of WDs. The currently favored explanation is that
these disks are the remnants of a smaller body like an asteroid, of a former planetary system
around the progenitor star. When this body approaches the WD, it is pulled apart by the tidal
forces. The study of the disk cannot give a very detailed picture of the chemical composition.
However, in many cases this material is accreted onto the photosphere of the white dwarf,
where it can be observed spectroscopically. If this interpretation is confirmed, it would offer
a unique opportunity to study indirectly the composition of material from extrasolar planetary
systems.
Many of these areas will be studied in more detail in the following sections. With more
than 600 new publications every year, the WDs are a very vital area of research, which cannot
be covered totally in a short chapter, aiming to provide a self-contained complete introduction
to the field. At the end, therefore, the reader will find a section with suggestions for further
reading.
1.1 A Few Historical Milestones
1910–1915: The first Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams constructed during this time showed three
peculiar (blue–white) objects in the lower left corner, that is with hot surface temperatures, but
much lower luminosity than the hot main sequence stars. These were the so-called “classical
white dwarfs” 40 Eridani B, Van Maanen 2, and Sirius B. Their location could only be under-
stood if the stars had a much smaller radius, by about a factor 100, than the main sequence stars

White Dwarf Stars 11
563
of corresponding spectral type. For Sirius B the mass was known from the binary orbit to be
about 1 M⊙, resulting in a mean density of ≈g cm−, which was completely mysterious at
that time.
1926: Fowler realized that the pressure supporting these stars is supplied by the almost
completelydegenerate electrons, as predicted bythe just discovered Pauli principle forfermions.
1931–1939: Chandrasekhar worked out the complete theory of the equation of state at all densi-
ties, including the effects of special relativity. He discovered the mass–radius relation for white
dwarfs, and the upper mass limit (the Chandrasekhar mass) of about 1.4 M⊙for WDs with
elements heavier than hydrogen in the interior.
1945: Schatzman explains the mono-elemental composition of most white dwarfs as due to
gravitational settling.
1952: Mestel described the evolution of white dwarfs as a cooling process.
1958: 111 WDs known. First book on white dwarfs by Schatzman appeared.
1958–1970: Large proper motion surveys (Luyten, Bruce Proper Motion Survey; Giclas, Lowell
Observatory) used the fact that WDs are close by (large proper motion) and blue, to find many
candidate white dwarfs.
1965–1990: Extensive photometric and spectroscopic work by Greenstein and collaborators
lead to major advancements in the understanding of WDs.
1978–1996: The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), a small, but extremely successful
satellite, opens up a completely new wavelength region for white dwarf research.
1986: The Palomar-Green survey increased the number of known white dwarfs significantly.
2004–2010: Several releases of White Dwarf Catalogs based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) increased the number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs to approximately
18,000.

Observations and Classiﬁcation
Spectra of WDs differ from typical main sequence spectra in two respects: in most objects spec-
tral lines of only one element are observed, either hydrogen, or helium, and the spectral lines
are extremely broad. This is shown in >Fig. 11-1, which displays spectra of examples for the
two largest groups of WDs, the so-called DAs and DBs. The spectra have a very high signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR), because they are obtained from the calibration database for the HST. WDs
are generally faint objects, and more typical spectra have lower SNR, even when observed with
the largest telescopes.
The vertical lines in > Fig. 11-1 indicate the positions of hydrogen and helium spectral
lines. It is obvious that the DA spectrum shows only hydrogen lines, and the DB spectrum only
helium lines (a close inspection also shows several extremely weak carbon lines, which is not
relevant for the current discussion). This indicates that the classification of white dwarf spec-
tra was originally based on analogy with the main sequence spectra, where A indicates strong
Balmer lines, and B strong neutral helium lines. The letter D stands for “degenerate,” based on
the realization that electron degeneracy is the explanation for their existence. Contrary to the
physical explanation of main sequence spectra as a temperature sequence, however, the main
difference between spectral types of WDs is the elemental abundances. Detailed analyses of
many objects have shown that there are two basic types of white dwarfs – those with hydrogen-
dominated atmospheres and those with helium-dominated atmospheres. Since the latter are

divided into several spectral types (see below), they are also often collectively called “Non-DAs,”
or “hydrogen-deficient.” With very few exceptions, all other elements are at most tiny traces or
completely absent from the surface layers.
The broadness of the lines indicates high gas pressure in the atmospheres. Since the pressure
in the visible photosphere is caused by the weight of the higher layers, it is in a simple approx-
imation proportional to the surface gravity, typically cm s−, and confirming the estimates
obtained from masses and radii.
2.1 Classiﬁcation and Spectral Types
Over the 100 years of WD observations, extensions of the simple two classes system have been
revealed and led to additions and refinements of the spectral classification system. The system
in current use is defined in Sion et al. (1983); it uses a primary symbol for the elements with
the strongest lines. The symbols from “P” to “V” in >Table 11-1 are appended to the primary
designation to indicate any peculiarities.
If lines of more than one element are visible, the corresponding element symbols are added.
A DA with weak metal lines would be a DAZ, a star showing strong metal lines (most often the
CaII H and K resonance lines), and in addition weak Hα is a DZA, a DB with strong helium
lines and weak CaII lines a DBZ, etc.
The DA group is by far the largest, with roughly 80% of all WDs. All the other types have
helium-dominated atmospheres, with the exception of the recently discovered “hot DQ,” where

carbon is the most abundant element, and some of the PG1159 stars, where carbon or oxygen
may dominate over helium.
The DAs are found over a very large range of effective temperatures, from about 6,000 K
to over 100,000 K; for DBs the range is 10,000–30,000K. To distinguish the objects within this
range, a decimal digit was introduced as a temperature indicator, defined as 50,400/Te f f , and
ranging from 1 to 9. More recently this has been even more refined to half integer and double
digit values. However, since the determination of effective temperaturesneeds a careful spectro-
scopic or photometric analysis with sophisticated theoretical models, such a designation seems
to be in contradiction with the aim of an observational classification and has therefore only
limited value.
DCs are found with effective temperatures below 10,000 K, where helium lines become
invisible in the optical range. At this temperature they must be helium-rich, because otherwise
strong Balmer lines would still be visible. With decreasing temperature, however, the Balmer
lines also disappear and a distinction between hydrogen-rich or helium-rich atmosphere
becomes extremely difficult.
DOs start around 45,000 K and extend to high temperatures above 100,000 K. They are
helium-rich, but hydrogen lines are detected in some objects. The hottest group of WDs, which
is sometimes included in the DO class, does not fit well into this classification system and is
therefore classified as “PG1159 stars” by most authors, after the prototype star PG1159-035.
These are also hydrogen-deficient stars characterized by absorption lines of HeII and highly
ionized C and O.
The DZ stars show traces of heavy metals in a helium-rich atmosphere, most often Ca, fol-
lowed sometimes by Mg and Fe. Because of gravitational settling (see >Sect. 6) these elements
stay in the outer layers only for times, which are always short compared to the evolutionary
ages of the WDs. They cannot be primordial, but must be supplied from the outside. Because
at the same metal abundance the lines are much stronger in helium-rich than in hydrogen-rich

566 11

atmospheres (because of the very low opacity of neutral helium), the hydrogen-rich equivalent
of this class (DAZ) has been discovered only recently.
The “classical” DQ stars are cool, helium-rich stars below Te f f ≈, K. This class is
considered separate from the DZ class, since carbon is believed to be present from the previous
evolution below the thin outer helium layer, and can be dredged-up into the atmosphere by
convective motions, which is indeed the accepted explanation for this group. The DQs were
extended very recently to include a small group of “hot DQs” with Te f f between 18,000 and
24,000 K, in which carbon is the dominant element.
A spectral atlas, with an extensive coverage of most types, subtypes, and peculiarities has
been published by Wesemael et al. (1993).
2.2 Photometry
White dwarfs have been observed in the Johnson UBV, Strømgren, and other photometric sys-
tems. Before the advent of electronic detectors and large telescopes this was the only feasible
way to observe larger samples for the study of population characteristics. Since about 1990
spectroscopic studies have become possible for this purpose and superseded the accuracy of
the photometric studies.
The huge database of homogeneous and accurate photometry in the ugriz system of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey has led to a renewed interest in photometry. In particular the elec-
tronic availability of the photometry for a huge number of point sources has allowed successful
targeted searches for new types of white dwarfs, or more members of the rare classes.
2.3 Parallaxes
The standard catalog for parallaxes is the “Fourth Edition of the General Catalogue of Trigono-
metric Stellar Parallaxes” (van Altena et al. 1995a, b). The WD parallaxes in this catalog
have typical formal errors of 3.7 mas, very similar to the ≈bright WDs observed by the
HIPPARCOS space project.
Parallaxprograms with dedicated telescopes and CCD cameras at the USNaval Observatory
and similar projects at other observatories have now pushed the formal errors down to 1.0 mas
and below. These accurate distances for a few hundred nearby WDs are important data for the
study of the local population, space densities, and tests of the spectroscopic and photometric
parameter determinations.

Stellar Parameters
The only method to determine masses independently of any assumption about the interior
structure is the use of dynamical masses from visual binary systems containing a white dwarf.
There are still only three stars with highly accurate results, which are shown in >Table 11-2.

absolute magnitude. The error of the WD mass may be larger than indicated in the table.
3.1 Eﬀective Temperatures, Surface Gravities, and Abundances
from Atmospheric Modeling
About a dozen WD-MS eclipsing binaries are known, where the fitting of the eclipse light curve
together with spectroscopic and photometric constraints can be used to determine radii (Pyrzas
et al. 2009; Steinfadt et al. 2008). In general, however, radii can only be determined from an
analysis of the emitted radiation with the help of model atmospheres. These models describe
the physical structure (pressure, mass density, temperature)of the photospheric layers using the
appropriate laws ofphysics, and from that calculate the emitted radiation (spectrum). In the case
of WDs the chemical composition is usually simple and the following simplifying assumptions
are adequate for the vast majority of WDs:
•
Homogeneous, plane parallel layers: the depth of the atmosphere is considered to be very
small compared to the radius of the star. All matter quantities (density, pressure, tempera-
ture) depend only on one geometric variable, the depth (in radial direction). The intensity
of the radiation field depends on depth and the angle against the normal, but not on the
azimuthal angle.
•
Hydrostatic equilibrium: at each point within the outer layers, which have a direct influ-
ence on the emerging radiation (i.e., the atmosphere or photosphere), the gradient of the
gas pressure is in equilibrium with the gravitational attraction (plus possibly the transfer of
momentum by photons).
•
Radiative and convective equilibrium: there is no energy generation or loss within the
atmosphere, only transport of the energy generated in the deep interior. This transport can
occurthrough radiation, heat conduction, orconvection; the total energyfluxas determined
by the parameter effective temperature is constant at all depths.
•
Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE): the matter is in thermal equilibrium corre-
sponding to the local temperature at each layer, that is the ionization, excitation, dissociation
of molecules, etc., are governed by the usual relations of thermal equilibrium (Boltzmann
factors, Saha equation, Kirchhoff’s law, etc.). Thermal equilibrium (i.e., the Planck function)
is not assumed for the radiation field!

568 11
White Dwarf Stars
Except for the last these assumptions are well justified. Small deviations from LTE become
visible around Te f f = 40,000 K, and above ≈, K Non-LTE atmosphere models have to
be used for accurate results. If the laws of thermal equilibrium cannot be used, all important
excitation and ionization reactions have to be calculated and the stationary state determined.
This increases the computational effort by several orders of magnitudes.
The parameters, which describe an atmosphere model, are the effective temperature Te f f ,
the logarithm of the surface gravity, log g, and the chemical abundances in the photosphere,
in the following summarily denoted as XYZ. These are iterated, until a satisfactory fit between
observed spectra or photometry and the model prediction is achieved. A typical example from
Koester et al. (2009) is shown in >Fig. 11-2 for the DA WD+ .
The most important quantity to be predicted by the final model is the average intensity of the
stellar disk Fλ(Te f f , log g, XYZ), with wavelength λ. The relation with effective temperature is

with the radiation constant σ. Only in a few cases (e.g., study of variables) the angle-dependence

with the solid angle of the star Ω given by the radius R and distance D. If the distance is known
from a trigonometric parallax, membership in a cluster or common proper motion pair, or any
other means, then the radius can be determined. The values in >Table 11-2 are obtained from
trigonometric parallaxes.
3.2 Determination of Masses and Radii
Very few WDs have accurate dynamical mass determinations. Many more have radius deter-
minations as described above. The surface gravity g provides a relation between mass M and
radius R
g = GM
R
(11.3)
with gravitational constant G, from which a mass can be estimated. Another such relation is the
gravitational redshift, expressed in the form of a (Doppler) velocity
vgrav = GM
cR
(11.4)
with the velocity of light c. The problem is that the space motion of the white dwarf has to be
known from membershipin a binary or common proper motion pair, because the Doppler shift
cannot be distinguished from the gravitational shift (Koester 1987; Reid 1996; Wegner and Reid
1991).
In order to determine stellar parameters for a large set of WDs, as necessary for a statis-
tical study of properties, one has to make use of the theoretical mass–radius relation, which
will be discussed in > Sect. 4. Originally derived by Chandrasekhar for zero temperature
as a relation R(M, XYZ), with XYZ denoting the interior composition, more modern ver-
sions include the small modifications for finite temperature and outer non-degenerate layers as
R(M, Te f f , XYZ). Together with a spectroscopic log g this allows the separate determination
of mass and radius. >Figure 11-3 shows the distribution of log g and masses for 298 DA white
dwarfs from the Palomar-Green (PG) Survey (Liebert et al. 2005a).
Prominent features of the mass distribution, well known since many years, are the sharp
peak near 0.6 M⊙, the small secondary peak near 0.4 M⊙, and the extended tail toward higher
masses. Since the higher mass WDs have smaller radius and hence smaller luminosities at the
same Te f f , they are detected in a smaller volume only, if the survey is magnitude-limited like the
PG survey. If this is corrected, the contribution of higher masses becomes significantly larger
and a third peak near 0.9 M⊙appears. The mass distribution of WDs depends on the distribu-
tion of progenitor masses, the mass loss between main sequence and WD, the star formation
rate during the history of the galaxy, and the evolutionary time scales of the WD stage.
The only other large spectral type with statistically significant numbers of masses deter-
mined are the DBs. The mean mass is certainly within ≈.M⊙similar to that of the DAs.
Studies to find smaller systematic differences are so far inconclusive. However, the secondary
peaks at low as well as high masses seem to be absent in the DB mass distribution.

Quantum mechanical effects are therefore dominant for the electrons – they form a degenerate
electron gas. Because of the Pauli principle, the electrons are forced to very high momentum
states, when the spatial volume is decreased. These electrons then provide the major part of the
pressure, which stabilizes the star against gravity.
4.1 Degeneracy and the Equation of State
The equation of state for the degenerate ideal gas can be derived from the distribution func-
tion in the 6-dimensional phase space of non-interacting particles f (x, y, z, px, py, pz, t). If
a stationary state, spatially homogeneous distribution, and isotropic momentum distribution
are assumed, the only variable remaining is the absolute value of the momentum p. Statistical

For given n and T the first equation is inverted to obtain the degeneracy parameter η, which is
then used to get the pressure and energy density. The necessary integrals have been redefined
with non-dimensional variables. They can only be calculated numerically, but are available in
tabular form as well as through numerical approximations.
An important limiting case is that of complete degeneracy at zero temperature.In this case a
parameter x = pF/mc is used as a measure of the influence of relativistic effects. pF is the Fermi
momentum, the limit up to which all energy levels of the free electrons are filled. The equations

In the nonrelativistic limit, f (x) ≈/x, while in the opposite limit f (x) ≈x. In both cases
the variable x can be eliminated from the first two equations, leading to P ∝n/or P ∝n/.
The transition between these two cases occurs approximately at a mass density of g cm−in
a carbon–oxygen mixture.
Although the derivation above is generally valid for fermions, in white dwarfs these results
apply to the electron component only. Because of the mass appearing in (> 11.5), protons and
neutrons become degenerate only at much higher densities, and can in a first approximation
be treated as a classical ideal gas, with the total pressure being the sum of electron and ion
contributions.
Deviations from the ideal gas behavior – classical or quantum mechanical – cause minor
modifications (Chabrier et al. 2000; Kitsikis et al. 2005; Koester and Chanmugam 1990; Lamb
and van Horn 1975; Lamb 1974; Salpeter 1961; Saumon et al. 1995; Segretain et al. 1994). The
most important effect for finite-temperature WDs is the Coulomb interaction, measured with
the parameter
ΓC = Ze
rkT
(11.18)
with Z the charge of the ions and rtheir mean distance. In addition to a small negative con-
tribution to the pressure of the ions, the Coulomb interaction leads to a regular pattern of the
positive ions as a body-centered cubic lattice, when ΓC ≈. In analogy to the usual liquid–
solid transition this is called “crystallization,” although the positive ions in WDs are completely
ionized bare nuclei.
4.2 Interior Models and Mass–Radius Relation
If the electrons are highly degenerate and the thermal pressure of electrons and ions can be
neglected, ( > 11.15) and ( > 11.16) define the complete EOS. For mono-atomic composition
and complete ionization the mass density is related to the number density of electrons as
ρ = ne μemu = nemu A
Z
(11.19)
Here mu is the atomic mass unit, μe the “atomic weight per electron,” and A and Z are the mass
and charge numbers of the nuclei. This EOS can be used to solve the mechanical part of the
stellar structure equations (see
>Chap. 1 in this volume). A central density is assumed as the
single parameter, and the equations of mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium can be
integrated outward to ρ = , resulting in the density–pressure stratification, a stellar mass M,
and radius R. This defines the famous mass–radius relation (MRR) for completely degenerate
zero-temperature white dwarfs (Chandrasekhar 1939).
The essential features of this relation can be understood from very simple considerations.
In hydrostatic equilibrium the pressure produced from the gravitational force at the center
scales as
Pc ∝GM
R
(11.20)
This pressure is balanced by the degenerate electron pressure. In the non-relativistic limit

There is only one solution M = const = MCh, independent of radius. As the density decreases

drasekhar mass” is only the asymptotic limit for infinite central density and R = . In physical

For interior composition of elements heavier than hydrogen, μe ≈and the limiting mass is
close to 1.4 M⊙.
At high densities near the limiting mass the Fermi energy of the electrons can exceed the
mass difference between the nuclei (A, Z) and (A+1, Z−). It then becomes energetically favor-
able to “capture” an electron onto the nucleus, transforming a proton into a neutron, a process
called “inverse β-decay.” The neutrinos formed in this transition can escape easily from the
white dwarf. For the Cnucleus this instability occurs at ρ = .g cm−, and the transfor-
mation then rapidly proceeds to Ne, because the intermediate nuclei have lower thresholds.
Since these reactions increase μe, the mass–radius relation turns back toward smaller masses
and the limiting mass is replaced by a slightly smaller maximum mass at finite density and
radius.
Since the electron degeneracy is always large for the observed WDs, simple approximations
have historically been used to calculate stellar models at finite temperatures and including non-
ideal effects in the EOS. Such calculations make use of the fact that degenerate electrons have a
very high thermal conductivity. Starting with outer boundary conditions from an atmosphere
model, the equation of energy transfer can be integrated throughout the outer non-degenerate
layers. When degeneracy is important, the temperature gradient becomes very small, and more
than 99% of the total mass are at approximately constant temperature, identified with the central
temperature of the WD. A useful numerical fit for the surface luminosity L as a function of the
central temperature Tc, which can be used for a first estimate of the interior temperatures, is

With the increasing power of modern computers, full stellar evolution calculations have
been extended to cover all of the evolutionary phases. These calculations automatically pro-
vide a MRR, including the dependence on temperature, interior composition, and the previous
evolution.

4.3 Gravitational Contraction and Cooling
The evolutionary calculations and their results will be discussed in >Sect. 5. It is, however, very
instructive to understand the main features of white dwarf evolution using a strongly simplified
reasoning.

White Dwarf Stars 11
575
If a star has (momentarily) exhausted a nuclear energy source, energy can be freed by
gravitational contraction. Since the star remains in hydrostatic equilibrium (as opposed to
gravitational collapse), the equilibrium conditions for the central pressure can be described as
GM
R
∝GM/ρ/∝ρT →T ∝ρ/
(11.26)
if the central EOS is that of an ideal classical gas. Contraction and increase of the density result
in higher temperature, which can eventually start a new phase of nuclear fusion. If the den-
sity becomes high enough for electron degeneracy to be significant, the EOS changes. In the
intermediate range the equations of partial degeneracy, described above, should be applied.
A very simple approximation is to use the sum of the two contributions from thermal pressure
of electrons and ions, and of the completely degenerate electrons. In the limits of negligible or
complete degeneracy the other term is negligible, and in the intermediate region the error is at
most a factor of 2. The condition of hydrostatic equilibrium is then
GM/ρ/∝cρT + cρ/
(11.27)
T ∝GM/
c
ρ/−c
c
ρ/
(11.28)
At low density the first term dominates. When the density approaches the transition region (f.e.
defined by the equality of classical thermal and completely degenerate pressure), the central
temperature goes through a maximum and then declines with further contraction!
A more sophisticated study (e.g., Koester and Chanmugam 1990) with the help of the virial
theorem indicates that in the degenerate case, the released gravitational energy is completely
used to increase the Fermi energy of the electron gas, while the decrease in thermal heat content
is numerically equal to the radiated luminosity. Because of this equality the evolution of white
dwarfs is called “cooling,” although it is necessarily accompanied by gravitational contraction
like in ordinary non-degenerate stars, and the change of the gravitational binding energy is
always of the same order of magnitude as the luminosity of the WD.
With further simplifying assumptions this can be formulated as
L = −dUth
dt
= −∂Uth
∂Tc
dTc
dt = −M < cV > dTc
dt
(11.29)
with Uth the thermal energy of ions and electrons, and < cV > an appropriately averaged value
for the specific heat of the matter. Using the relation between L and Tc ( > 11.25), the ideal
gas cV, and assuming that at t = the WD starts at very high luminosity, this equation can be
solved to give a “cooling age” for the WD with atomic mass number A
t ∝
A ( L

(11.30)

Full Evolutionary Calculations
With modern stellar evolution codes the evolution can be followed from the main sequence
through the phases of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and central star of a planetary nebula
(CPN). An important ingredient is a description of the mass loss rate in all phases with semi-
empirical formulae. The end of the nuclear burning phases is reached, when the pressure of
the outer layers above a nuclear burning shell is too small to support further burning, and at
the same time the center has entered the electron-degeneracy regime. The central temperature
then does not rise anymore to ignite the next possible nuclear burning stage. After the heavy
mass-loss phases at the end of the AGB and in the CPN stage the former core of the red giant
constitutes the immediate progenitor of a white dwarf, a pre-white dwarf.
From the calculations ofmanygroups a consensus has emerged that all single main sequence
stars born with initial mass up to ≈M⊙end their nuclear lives as WDs with masses up to the
limiting mass of 1.4 M⊙, with the remainder given back to the interstellar medium. Stars with
masses up to ≈M⊙leave a carbon–oxygen (C/O) core with a mass up to ≈.M⊙. The rela-
tive distribution of carbon and oxygen depends on the nuclear fusion rate C(α, γ) O, which
is still not very well determined, and the detailed treatment of convection and overshooting.
This core is surrounded by a helium-rich shell (ashes of the hydrogen-burning) and an outer
hydrogen-rich layer. The typical fractional masses obtained from the evolutionary calculations
are −for helium and −for the hydrogen layer. There are indications that these fractions
depend on the core mass (smaller for higher core masses) and that they may be modified by
later evolution toward the white dwarf phase (late shell-flashes, stellar winds), but the details
are not fully understood.
For stars with higher initial masses, but below the threshold for core-collapse supernovae
(≈M⊙), the carbon burning will be ignited and the core (>.M⊙) consists of an O/Ne
mixture. The uncertainties of the detailed interior composition and outer shell masses remain
major problems in WD evolution.
Very few calculations exist, where the evolution has been followed with the same code
throughout the AGB and the WD cooling phase. Most authors use a different specialized code
for the white dwarf phase, because new phenomena have to be considered, which are not as
relevant in the previous phases. Examples are the crystallization of the interior, diffusion and
mixing processes, and a detailed treatment of the thin outer layers, which is important for the
interpretation of WD spectral types. The WD evolution calculations start with initial models
of very hot pre-white dwarfs, derived by some artificial procedures (e.g., scaling a model to a
different mass) from the cores obtained through pre-WD evolution. The first phases of the evo-
lutionary tracks, in particular the derived evolutionary cooling ages, are then not very reliable.
Only very recently large numbers of evolutionary tracks have been calculated all the way from
main sequence to the pre-WD phase, providing very realistic starting models for the subsequent
WD cooling of the whole range of masses. The masses of the outer layers are generally treated
as free parameters, with the “standard” values mentioned above most often used. >Figure 11-5
shows an example for such a calculation, starting with a 3 M⊙star on the main sequence and
ending with a DA white dwarf of 0.562 M⊙and Te f f ≈, K.
5.1 Low Mass White Dwarfs
The mass distribution (>Fig. 11-3) shows a number of WDs with masses below 0.45 M⊙. This
value is approximately the threshold for the mass of a helium core to ignite the helium-burning,

the hydrogen layer in 10−4 M⊙(From Althaus et al. 2002, Fig. 1. Reproduced with permission from

and lower mass WDs should therefore consist of He in the interior. The main sequence progen-
itors of such objects should have masses below 0.8 M⊙, and still be on the main sequence. The
only possible explanation seems to be that these low-mass, helium-core WDs are the product
of close binary evolution. The occurrence of low-mass WDs in binary systems with a pulsar
companion provides support for this hypothesis. Some of these low-mass WDs probably have
higher-mass (less luminous) WD companions, but a sizable fraction are apparently single stars
of currently unknown origin.
The initial evolutionary phases of the binary systems are uncertain, and calculations aiming
at the time scales, mass–radius relation, and observational properties in the later phases usually
start by artificially removing the outer layers of a main sequence or red giant star, when the He
core has reached the desired mass (Serenelli et al. 2002). Current emphasis is on more realistic
calculations for the progenitor binary phase of mass transfer. This is important, because the

578 11

cooling times in the WD phase depend strongly on the thickness of the outer H layer. For thick
layers residual H burning can prolong the cooling times significantly.
5.2 Origin and Evolution of Hydrogen-Deﬁcient White Dwarfs
The above considerations are relevant for the majority of WDs with outer hydrogen envelopes.
There is, however, a parallel sequence of hydrogen-deficient WDs (PG1159, DO, DB). The most
widely accepted explanation is that these WDs have lost almost the complete hydrogen envelope
through the so-called “born-again” scenario and evolve along a separate channel from the DAs
(Iben et al. 1983). The basic idea is that the evolution depends on the timing of the last He shell-
flash. If it occurs, while the star is still on the AGB, a normal DA results. If, however, there is
a “very late thermal pulse” with the star already at the start of the WD cooling phase, the star
moves back again to the AGB and burns most of its hydrogen, before turning back again toward
the WD regime. > Figure 11-6 shows such an evolutionary track in the HRD with different
phases indicated. From the AGB the star moves through the PN stage onto the hot part of the
WD cooling track. Then a final He-flash occurs, leading to a convection zone, which reaches
up into the H-rich layers and leads to violent hydrogen-burning. The depletion of hydrogen

reaches the surface and any remaining hydrogen is diluted further. About 350 years after the
He-flash the star reaches the red giant region for the second time, and then contracts again
back toward the pre-WD stage. The time scales in this calculation are longer than observed in
Sakurai’s object, which is believed to be in such a born-again phase. That may be due to several
uncertainties and approximations in the calculation.
On the other hand, nuclear burning, convective mixing, and element diffusion – processes
which determine the chemical abundance profile above the He-shell, are treated in realistic
detail. These layers become visible at the surface of the PG1159 stars and their likely precursors,
the [wc] central stars of planetary nebulae with hydrogen-deficient atmospheres.
A detailed comparison of the predicted abundance profiles with the results of careful atmo-
spheric analysis using Non-LTE models is presented in Werner and Herwig (2006). The main
atmospheric constituents in the PG1159 stars are He/C/O. They show large scatter from star to
star, but the class prototype, PG1159-035, has about the average abundances with 0.33/0.50/0.17
by mass. A more extreme case is HS +, which has He/C/O = 0.85/0.13/0.02. Other ele-
ments that have been detected are N, Ne, F, Si, P, S, and in a few objects even hydrogen is seen.
The comparison with model predictions confirms that the observed abundances indeed cor-
respond to the abundances in the inter-shell region – between H- and He-shell – of the AGB
progenitor. The observed scatter can be understood with differences in stellar mass, mass-loss
on the AGB, or number of thermal pulses experienced.
It is generally believed that the PG1159 stars are the progenitors of the hydrogen-deficient
sequence of WDs, after the heavy elements have settled down (see below). There is a caveat,
however: some PG1159 stars show hydrogen, and a mass fraction of 1% H cannot be excluded
for any of the group. This hydrogen would remain at the surface and necessarily turn the star
into a DA at lower Te f f .
5.3 Other Evolutionary Channels
Subluminous O and B stars (sdO, sdB) are core helium-burning objects with hydrogen
envelopes too thin to support hydrogen-burning. While there are still open questions about
their origin, the future is much clearer. These objects will evolve directly into white dwarfs,
without passing through the AGB. The sdB stars have masses of about 0.5 M⊙and will thus
produce low mass WDs; some sdO stars may result from binary mergers and also leave higher
mass WDs. The total contribution of sdOs and sdBs to the white dwarf birthrate is estimated as
≈%, with very large uncertainty.
5.4 Evolution and the HRD
Very widely used for the majority of WDs with C/O cores are the calculations from groups,
which provide homogeneous large grids of evolutionary data for the general use. For more than
a decade the calculations of Wood (1995) have set the standard. Since then many improvements
have been made by various groups concerning the EOS, opacities, treatment of convection,
inclusion of diffusion processes, better treatment of the crystallization, and more realistic initial
models. Most of these improvements have been included in the grids published by the groups
of Fontaine, Brassard, Bergeron, and collaborators in Montreal (Canada), and of Althaus, Ben-
venuto, and collaborators in La Plata (Argentina). Some recent papers are Brassard and Fontaine

(1998), Fontaine et al. (2001), Althaus et al. (2007, 2009), Panei et al. (2000, 2007), Benvenuto
et al. (1999), and many references in these papers. Both groups make these data available
from their websites. In the following some results from these evolutionary calculations and
applications to observations are discussed.
> Figure 11-7 shows the time evolution of DA WDs with masses >.M⊙. While the
general trend is described by the simple cooling approximation of (> 11.31), there are signifi-
cant differences mainly at high and low luminosities. These are caused by effects not taken into
account in the approximation:
•
At high luminosities plasmons (photons coupled to electrons in a plasma) may decay into
a neutrino–antineutrino pair (Yakovlev et al. 2001), which leaves the star immediately. This
energy loss may even exceed the photon luminosity and lead to an accelerated cooling.
•
If the outer hydrogen layer has a mass of −M⊙or larger, residual hydrogen-burning may
contribute to the energy generation, slowing down the cooling.

•
At moderately low luminosities, with central temperatures between and K, depend-
ing on the mass of the WD, the crystallization starts at the center and moves outward with
further cooling. This is a first order phase transition, and the latent heat released, of the
order of kT per particle, slows the cooling. Moreover, the specific heat of the solid is larger
than that of a gas, leading to additional slowing of the temperature decrease.
•
If the interior consists of a mixture of carbon and oxygen, the crystallization will lead to
enhanced oxygen content of the solid. Because oxygen is transported toward the center and
the lighter carbon outward, this effect releases a small amount of gravitational energy. If
this occurs at low luminosities (for low mass WDs), the ages may be increased significantly
(Isern et al. 1997). A very lucid description of this effect is Montgomery et al. (1999).
•
At very low luminosities quantum effects become important for the solid. Higher energy
levels do not take part anymore in the heat exchange, the specific heat falls rapidly to zero
as cV ∝T, and the interior temperature and luminosity decrease rapidly. This is usually
referred to as “Debye cooling.”
A comparison of theoretical evolution with observations is possible in the HRD.

Another instructive way to show the connection between masses, Te f f , and ages
is >Fig. 11-9. The objects with apparent masses below 0.45 M⊙are helium-core stars resulting
from close binary evolution or unresolved double-degenerates. In the latter case the luminosity
appears too large for their temperature, and therefore a large radius is derived from the known
distance. For these objects a comparison with the isochrones is meaningless; for all other stars
individual ages can be directly inferred. The two oldest stars appear to be close to 11 Gyear old,
setting a lower limit for the star formation in the galactic disk.
5.5 Mass–Radius Relation
Another result from the cooling calculations for a range of masses is the radii as a function of
mass, Te f f , and interior and envelope composition R(M, Te f f , XYZ). A selection of these is

the large errors is Stein 2051. Only the mass ratio is known dynamically for this object; the mass of
the secondary is estimated from its luminosity and the WD mass is probably more uncertain than
the error bar indicates. A spectroscopic massdetermination for thisobject gives0.64 M⊙. Theother
three objects are from left to right 40 Eri B, Procyon B, and Sirius B
displayed in >Fig. 11-10. Compared to the zero-temperature relation (Hamada and Salpeter
1961) the radii are always larger, but converge for large masses. For non-DA stars, without the
outer H layer, the radii would be slightly smaller. The three well-determined positions of the
visual binary components agree fairly well with the relations for carbon interior. Other deter-
minations using surface gravity, gravitational redshift, and distances in various combinations
have always much larger errors. They generally agree with the relations in >Fig. 11-10, but are
too uncertain to distinguish interior compositions or outer layer masses.

5.6 Luminosity Function and Age of the Galactic Disk
The luminosity function (LF) n(L) describes the number of WDs in a luminosity interval for
a stellar system, which can be the whole galactic disk, or a local sample (per pc−, or pc−if
referred to a column perpendicular to the Galactic plane). Instead of the luminosity the absolute
magnitude is sometimes used. For the simple WD cooling evolution the LF is proportional to
the cooling time dt spent in the interval L, L + dL; this can be written as
n(L) = ∫
Mup
Ml ow
dtcool(M f , L)
dL
Ψ(t −tcool (L, M f (M)) −tms(M) Φ(M) dM
(11.32)
Here Mup is the upper mass limit on the main sequence for stars, which become white dwarfs,
currently taken as ≈M⊙, and Mlow is the lowest mass for a star, which has had time to cool
down to luminosity L
tms(Mlow) + tcool(M f (Mlow), L) = t
(11.33)
tms is the evolution time on the main sequence plus the following phases prior to the WD, tcool
the cooling time of the WD with mass M f , which is the remnant of the original main sequence
star with mass M. t is the present time, counted since star formation began in the system. Ψ(t) is
the time-dependent star formation rate and Φ(M) the initial mass function (IMF) on the main
sequence. M f and M are related through the initial–final mass relation (IFMR), here assumed
to be a unique relation.
If the LF refers to a volume element in the solar neighborhood, a correction has to be applied
which takes into account the change of the galactic scale height for WD populations of different
age. >Figure 11-11 shows an example forthe comparison ofobserved luminosityfunctions with
theoretical models, where simple assumptions have been made for the used relations (Salpeter
IMF, constant star formation rate).
The observed LF decreases rapidly near log L/L⊙= −.. The widely accepted explanation
is that the oldest WDs of our galactic disk are still visible today, and can be used to derive the
time since the beginning of star formation in our disk (Winget et al. 1987). With the models
used in >Fig. 11-11 this age would be between 10 and 11 Gyear, in agreement with the oldest
WDs in >Fig. 11-9.
5.7 Local Space Density and Birthrate
Instead of (> 11.32) the LF can also be calculated as
n(L) = ∫
˙n(M f , t −tcool(M f , L)) dtcool(M f , L)
dL
dM f
(11.34)
with the WD birthrate ˙n(M f , t). The integral is over the range of possible WD masses. The
absolute scale of the LF therefore contains implicit information on the integrated birthrate, as
well as the total number density of white dwarfs, e.g., in the solar neighborhood. A careful
consideration of selection effects, contributions of unseen companions in binaries, and non-
DA white dwarfs lead to an estimate of .× −pc−year−for the total birthrate, integrated
over all masses (Liebert et al. 2005a). This is an estimate for the recent rate, because the PG
survey used is a sample of hot, young WDs.

note that the data are per interval of Mbol and not L (From Fontaine et al. 2001, Fig. 9. Reproduced

Estimates for the birthrate of planetary nebulae, with central stars that must evolve into
WDs, are about a factor 2–3 larger. Uncertainties of the distances and lifetimes, and the com-
parison of a local sample with PNs at much larger distances, may account for this difference,
but that question is still open.
Total space densities of WDs are best determined in the immediate neighborhood. The
nearly complete sample within 20 pc amounts to a total space density of (.± .) −pc−
(Holberg et al. 2008). With ages up to 8 Gyear, the average rate over the history of the galactic
disk is about a factor of 2 smaller than the current rate. This is quite plausible, since current WD
formation occurs from smaller mass progenitors with higher number density in the Galaxy.
5.8 Initial–Final Mass Relation
An important relation for the theoretical predictions of the LF is the initial–final mass relation:
what is the WD mass M f for a main sequence star born with mass Mi. This relation is important

586 11
White Dwarf Stars
far beyond the study of WDs, since it determines the mass budget of our galaxy. Which frac-
tion of the mass in main sequence stars is given back into the interstellar medium, to be used
again in star formation; which part remains locked forever in the interior of cold WDs? And
finally, closely related the question: What is the upper mass limit for stars to end as WDs versus
supernovae?
In principle this would be a result of stellar evolution calculations following the star from
birth to the WD stage. However, there is still no theory for the calculation of the mass loss
in various phases from first principles. This mass loss is therefore described with empirical
formulae fitted to observations. Nevertheless, the C/O cores predicted by these calculations
in the latest phases of the AGB are used as a first theoretical estimate for the mass of the
final WD.
More important has been a semi-empirical approach using white dwarfs in open clusters.
In the most simple version, finding a white dwarf in an open cluster with a turnoff mass of 5 M⊙
demonstrates immediately that the progenitor star must have had a mass >M⊙. It is easy to
expand this argumentation to the following steps:
•
Identify white dwarfs in an open cluster; establish likelihood of cluster membership.
•
Determine spectroscopically and/or photometrically WD parameters Te f f , log g, and the
mass from the MRR.
•
Get the cooling age of the WD from cooling calculations.
•
Subtract cooling age from cluster age. This is the total evolution time of the progenitor from
main sequence to PN.
•
Compare this with stellar evolution calculations to determine the mass of the progenitor
from the lifetime.
From the pioneering works of Tinsley (1974), van den Heuvel (1975), Sweeney (1976),
Weidemann (1977), Romanishin and Angel (1980), Koester and Reimers (1981) based on
photographic plates from small telescopes (compared to today), and early large scale com-
putations of stellar evolution this work has been followed by numerous authors with much
improved results. In addition to open clusters common proper motion pairs can be used with
similar arguments, if the total age of the system can be determined from the non-degenerate
companion.
>Figure 11-12 shows an example for such a compilation, which includes results from a
large body of literature. The open clusters are shown with different symbols; the common proper
motion pairs help to define the low mass part of the relation. The theoretical curves show the
core masses at the end of the AGB phase for different metallicities. The observations confirm
the general trend of increasing final masses with progenitor mass. The scatter in individual
clusters is still quite large, and the theoretically expected dependence of the relation on pro-
genitor metallicity cannot yet be confirmed. The extrapolation of this relation to the highest
observed WD masses indicates the upper limit of ≈M⊙for WD formation, but the remaining
uncertainty is at least ±M⊙.

Physical Processes in the Outer Layers
The most obvious peculiarities observed in WDs are the two sequences of hydrogen-rich and
hydrogen-deficient (or DA versus non-DA) objects and the largely mono-elemental composi-
tion of most WDs. The first is currently thought to be a result of the timing of the last thermal

pulse in the He-burning shell, i.e., WDs are already born in two different kinds. The details
of the chemical composition as well as their possible changes during the cooling evolution are
influenced by several physical processes discussed in the following.
6.1 Gravitational Settling and Diﬀusion
The mono-elemental composition with the lightest element remaining floating to the top of the
outer layers and being observable in the atmospheres was explained as gravitational settling by
Schatzman (1945). Considering first an atmosphere of pure ionized hydrogen, the gravitational
forces on protons and electrons are
Fp = mpg
and
Fe = me g
(11.35)
with proton and electron masses mp and me. This difference of the forces would lead to a change
of the electron to proton concentration ratio with height, similar to the concentration gradi-
ent of Oand Nmolecules in the terrestrial atmosphere. However, the particles in the stellar

588 11

atmosphere are charged, and a charge separation will produce an electric field E, until both
forces are equal
mpg + eE = meg −eE →E = −mp −me
e
g ≈−mp
e g
(11.36)
Gravity and electric forces have the opposite sign for protons and the same for electrons. The
charge separation is extremely small and the matter remains practically neutral, as can be seen
with the help of the Poisson equations for electric and gravitational fields and their sources,
starting from (> 11.36)
div E = −πe (np −ne) = −mp
e div g = mp
e πGnPmp
(11.37)
∣np −ne
np
∣= Gm
p
e≈−
(11.38)
which is the ratio of the gravitational to electrical force between two protons. Although the
net charge is extremely small the electric field is important to secure the equilibrium between
protons and electrons in the gravitational field. In writing down the hydrostatic equation for a
star, the field is not considered explicitly; it is accounted for implicitly by assuming an effective
molecular weight of /for ionized hydrogen.
If a heavier element is present as a small trace, which does not change the global electric
field significantly, the force on the ion with mass number A and actual charge number Z is
F(A, Z) = Ampg + ZeE = mpg [A −
Z]
(11.39)
The factor in brackets is /for proton and electron, but 3 for doubly ionized He, or 43 for
completely ionized Fe. As a consequence the heavy elements cannot be simultaneously in equi-
librium with protons and electrons, they experience a net downward force. Since they are not in
vacuum, but interact with the plasma, this leads toa diffusion process. Similarcalculations apply
to the case of hydrogen-deficient WDs, where the lightest element is He and heavier elements
experience a net downward force relative to the He ions.
The collision integrals for Static Screened Coulomb Potentials, which are needed to describe
this diffusion process, have been calculated and approximated with analytical fits in Paquette
et al. (1986a). From these fits, diffusion coefficients and velocities vdi f f can be calculated for
the conditions in WDs. Assuming a constant reservoir of mass Mres, density ρ, and surface area
πRat the bottom of the reservoir, the diffusion equation for the trace element abundance by
mass X
Mres dX
dt = −πRXρ vdi f f
(11.40)
has a very simple solution as an exponential decrease of the heavy element abundance in the
reservoir. The diffusion time scale is
τdi f f =
Mres
πRρ vdi f f
(11.41)
Results of such calculations are published in Paquette et al. (1986b) and Koester (2009); a few
examples are given in >Table 11-3. These time scales are very short for hot WDs, but even at
the lower temperatures they remain always short compared to the cooling ages. If gravitational
settling were the only process at work one would only observe one single element in all WDs.

6.2 Stellar Winds and Radiative Levitation
A stellar wind, or mass loss, is necessarily connected with a velocity field in the outer layers,
because the equation of continuity has to be satisfied. If this outward velocity becomes compa-
rable to the diffusion velocities, the settling of the heavy elements will be slowed down or even
prevented.
Mass loss has been observed in central stars of planetary nebulae on the horizontal
track from the AGB toward high Te f f , including a few PG1159 stars. The mass loss rates are
−– −M⊙year−. No mass loss has been observed for white dwarfs on the cooling track,
when the outer layers are compressed and log g becomes larger than 7. Mass-loss rates as low as
−M⊙year−, currently unobservable, would still have an effect on settling times, but theo-
retical predictions based on the radiation-driven wind theory do not expect such winds in the
WD regime (Unglaub 2008). On the other hand, the diffusion time scales of He and heavier ele-
ments are very short and no mechanism is known at present to explain their presence together
with hydrogen in the atmospheres down to 50,000 K, and cooling ages of the order of years.
If the radiation field is not strong enough to cause mass loss, it may still transfer signif-
icant momentum on individual trace elements. This could support them in the photosphere
against gravitational settling, a process called radiative levitation. The basic process is that the
momentum transferred from photons absorbed by an ion is asymmetrical, with the outward
momentum on average higher than the inward, because of the temperature gradient. If the re-
emission of the photons is isotropic, a net momentum transfer results, reducing the effective
gravitational acceleration. This process is most efficient for ions with many absorption lines in
the wavelength range of the maximum of the radiation field. At very low abundances of such
trace elements, every ion absorbs the maximum momentum, until the spectral lines start to
saturate and an equilibrium abundance is approached. This abundance, or more correctly the
equilibrium distribution in the outer layers, depends (for a given main constituent) only on the
effective temperature and surface gravity (Chayer et al. 1995a, b; Fontaine and Michaud 1979;
Landenberger-Schuh 2005; Michaud et al. 1976; Vauclair et al. 1979).
The importance of radiative levitation is confirmed by observations of the hottest DA white
dwarfs. Whereas the optical spectra show only hydrogen, observations in the soft X-ray and
EUV regions showed a clear flux deficiency compared to pure hydrogen models. When He was
excluded as a source of this absorption, only heavier elements remained as explanation. How-
ever, the resolution of ROSAT (Röntgensatellit) and EUVE (Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer) was

590 11
White Dwarf Stars
too low to identify individual elements. This became only possible with high-resolution spec-
troscopy in the FUV region of the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and in the UV
with HST. Barstow et al. (2003) found that all DAs with Te f f > , K have detectable C, N,
O, Si, Fe, Ni with abundances in the range −– −by number, relative to hydrogen. These
elements are expected from radiative levitation theory to be supported; however, the detailed
abundances do not agree very well with the predictions. Below 50,000 K, some DAs show met-
als, while others with very similar parameters apparently have pure hydrogen atmospheres.
The reason for this dichotomy is not understood. Radiative levitation becomes negligible below
40,000 K.
In the parallel sequence of DOs, the hot helium-rich white dwarfs, metal traces are also
present. The general trend of decreasing abundances with lower Te f f agrees with theoretical
predictions, but individual abundances do not.
6.3 Convection and Dredge-Up
Energy transport in the non-degenerate layers can be through radiative transfer or convection,
as decided by the Schwarzschild criterion for the temperature gradient. Because of the large
length scales and low viscosity in stellar plasmas, the Reynolds numbers are large. The convec-
tive motion is always highly turbulent, leading to a chemically homogeneous mixed convection
zone. For the determination of diffusion time scales in >Table 11-3 therefore the mass in the
convection zone (CVZ) was used as the reservoir in the cooler models.
In a stratified structure, as expected in pre-white dwarfs from the previous evolution, con-
vection can change the surface abundances, if during the cooling the convection zone extends
downward into the transition layers. Evidence for this exists in the distribution of WD spectral
types, and its interpretation requires the knowledge of the evolution of convection zones with
cooling.
Convection in WDs is usually described with the mixing length theory (MLT) as applied to
stars first by Böhm-Vitense (1958), although attempts have been made occasionally to use more
sophisticated theories. While for MS stars like the sun the mixing-length l, or its ratio to the
pressure scale height α = l/HP is usually the only free parameter, it has become customary to
use three more parameters for WDs. These additional dimension-less parameters (a, b, c) are
introduced in the heuristic derivation of the theory and modify the average speed of convective
elements, the energy flux, and the convective efficiency. A specific version of MLT is then noted
f.e. as ML1/α = ., or ML2/α = .. ML1 and ML2 are the most often used combinations,
they stand for the choices a, b, c = /, /, (ML1) and a, b, c = , , (ML2) (Fontaine
et al. 1981; Jordan et al. 1998; Tassoul et al. 1990). With a given choice of the ML version, the
efficiency of the convective energy transport generally increases with larger mixing length α; the
other parameters determine more subtle effects, e.g. whether the efficiency is increased more
in the upper layers (low convection efficiency), or more in the deeper layers (high efficiency).
The current standard for DA atmosphere models is ML2/α = ., which has been shown by
Bergeron et al. (1995) to give consistent fits to optical and UV spectra for variable DAs with
Te f f = 11,000–12,000K. Similar arguments favor ML2/α = .for DBs, although the evidence
is weaker.
These “calibrations” of MLT are derived from spectroscopic observations of the atmo-
spheres. The variable DA G29–38 has a shortest period around 200 s, which according to
theoretical arguments should agree approximately with the thermal time scale of its convection

White Dwarf Stars 11
591
zone. However, with the standard parameters the convection zone is very thin, with a time scale
of≈s. This points toa higherconvective efficiencyin deeperlayers. Similarconclusions are also
drawn from a comparison of the mean temperature structure in 2d hydrodynamic simulations,
with the MLT model atmospheres. No choice of MLT parameters can describe simultane-
ously the temperature structure in the upper and deeper layers; compared to a forced best fit
MLT structure, the efficiency of convection needs to be lower in the upper and larger in the
deeper layers. In summary, all these arguments, as well as comparisons with more sophisticated
theories, demonstrate that MLT is a very poor approximation.
Keeping in mind these limitations, the size of convection zones and its evolution during the
cooling is shown for DAs and DBs in >Fig. 11-13. In DAs, the convection zone develops near
Te f f = 18,000 K for 0.6 M⊙and remains shallow until about 12,500 K. Between 12,500 and
10,000 K the mass in the convection zone increases very rapidly by six orders of magnitude.
Since convection is closely related to the partial ionization of hydrogen, these characteris-
tic points in the evolution shift slightly to higher Te f f for larger masses (higher atmospheric
pressure) and vice versa.
The picture is more complicated forthe helium-rich WDs. Ashallow convection zone driven
by the HeII ionization is present as high as Te f f = , K. Around 33,000 K a HeI convection
zone appears in higher layers, moves upward, and combines at depth with the HeII zone with
further cooling, reaching down to fractional masses of ≈−. The evolution of the upper limits
of convection zones for the lower Te f f is mostly caused by the change of atmospheric opacities;
the upper limit is always in the photosphere.
The consequences of this evolution of the convection zones will be studied below.
6.4 Accretion and Diﬀusion
The presence of heavy elements like Ca in white dwarfs with cooling ages much larger than
diffusion time scales can only be understood, if they are provided from a source outside the
star. Historically, the most natural explanation has been accretion from the interstellar matter
(ISM), but recently other possibilities (comets, debris disks as relics from asteroids) have come
into focus.

Accretion onto a spherical star is described by the theory developed by Hoyle, Lyttleton,
and Bondi, and can be summarized in the equation for the accretion rate (Bondi 1952)
˙MBHL = π(GM)ρ∞
(v+ vs )/
(11.42)
with ρ∞the density of the unperturbed ISM, v the relative velocity, and vs the sound velocity.
This is an interpolation formula between the solutions for a star moving at large velocity and a
star at rest. In the words of Bondi, this equation is expected to give the order of magnitude of the
accretion in a stationary state. There is some confusion in the literature concerning the factor
of 4. It is an adjustment to numerical simulations and agrees with the original Hoyle-Lyttleton
formula for large velocities (see Edgar 2004 for a discussion); the original Bondi formula has
a factor of 2 instead. For typical WDs (0.6 M⊙, 50 km s−the rate would be of the order of
−, −, −M⊙year−for the hot, warm, and cold phases of the ISM. All these calcula-
tions are applicable only, if the accretion is a hydrodynamical flow, i.e., the mean free path of
the particles is short compared to the “gravitational radius”
√
GMR/v. If that is not true and
the particles are freely falling onto the star, the much lower Eddington rate applies
˙ME = πGMR

(11.43)
These simple estimates do not take into account the extremely inhomogeneous nature of the
ISM, the mixture of gas and dust, and a possible influence of the stellar radiation or a magnetic
field on the accretion. The true rates of ISM accretion under realistic conditions are therefore
only very poorly known.
The observable metal abundances at the surface are determined by the interplay of accretion
and diffusion. Using now the convection zone as the reservoir, the evolution of the mass fraction

where the first term on the right-hand side is the abundance at the start of the accretion phase
at t = (usually assumed to be zero). Three different phases can be distinguished with such a
solution:
•
For t ≪τdi f f the abundance increases linearly with time, with a slope only determined by
the accretion rate.
•
After a few times the diffusion time scale a steady state is reached with

Using Mcvz from a stellar model and a calculated diffusion time scale this equation allows
an estimate of the accretion rate. Another interesting consequence of this steady state is that

the ratio of abundances for two elements is

= τX,acc
τX,acc
(11.48)
In this case the abundance ratios of the accreted matter can be determined from the
calculated diffusion time scales and the steady state observed abundances.
•
If accretion stops, diffusion continues and the abundances decline with their diffusion time
scales. Since these are usually different for different elements, the abundance ratios change
exponentially with time, and conclusions about the accreted abundances become uncertain
or even impossible.
Obviously the steady state offers the best opportunity for conclusions. Looking at the numbers
in >Table 11-3, diffusion time scales are very short in the hotter DAs, at most a few years above
12,000 K. Several DAZs in this range have been observed for a number of years without changes
in the Ca abundance; it is therefore quite likely that they are in a steady state. This allowed
Koester and Wilken (2006) to derive accretion rates in the range −to × −M⊙year−
for 38 DAZs, assuming solar composition for the accreted matter. This is compatible with the
predictions of the Bondi formula for the warm and cold phases of the ISM.
At least for the hotter DAZs this also allows to obtain heavy element abundance ratios for
the accreted matter, which is important for the discussion of the source of this matter. The
situation is much less favorable, if the diffusion time scales are long compared to observation
“time scales,” which is generally the case for DBZs. A possible accretion/diffusion scenario for
some of the heavy elements observed in the WD GD 368 is shown in >Fig. 11-14. Here it is
assumed for simplicity that all elements are accreted with the same abundance, the figure thus
shows only the relative changes. In this specific case, the atmospheric abundances ratios for
times t < × years agree with those in the accreted matter. After that time, the steady state
is approached, and the ratios differ from the accreted ones by the ratios of the diffusion time
scales, which are factors of 2–4 in this case. After accretion is switched off, the ratios diverge
exponentially, and no conclusions about the accreted matter are possible.
The situation is more favorable, if an exponentially declining accretion rate is assumed with
time scale τacc. This could be appropriate, if the source is a debris disk, which is not replen-
ished from material further out in the system (Jura et al. 2009). In this case (>Fig. 11-15), the
abundances never reach a steady state, but instead begin to increase, reach a maximum, and
then decline. The maxima are reached at different times for the elements, depending on their
diffusion time scales. In this example, the accretion time scale is longer than all diffusion time
scales. As time increases, the later decline is governed by the accretion time scale, which is the
same for all elements. The abundance ratios therefore do not show the large deviations from
the accreted values as in the case, where accretion is switched off. Asymptotically the element
ratios approach that of the steady state, governed by the diffusion time scales.
6.5 Spectral Evolution of White Dwarfs: Current Status
As discussed already, the main feature of two sequences is explained with a different origin.
The hydrogen-rich objects evolve from the AGB through the hydrogen-rich central stars of
planetary nebulae to the hottest DAs at ≈, K. They remain DAs until at least Te f f ≈
, K (see below).

If the last He shell-flash occurs late, at the beginning of the cooling sequence, the star moves
a second time through the AGB and PN region, losing almost all of the remaining hydrogen-
rich layers. The evolution goes very likely through the hydrogen-deficient central stars of Wolf-
Rayet type [wc], and the PG1159 stars. Helium, carbon, and oxygen show abundances similar to
that predicted from nuclear burning between the H- and He-burning shells on the AGB. Other
strong arguments for this scenario are the large overabundances of neon and fluorine, which
are both produced in a He-shell burning environment.
Between ≈
, K and 75,000 K the PG1159 stars are transformed into helium-
dominated DOs; the carbon and oxygen settles down. DOs exist down to temperatures of
≈, K.
6.5.1 The DB Gap
For many years no helium-rich object was known in the range 30,000–45,000 K. This mystery
was called the “DB gap” (Liebert et al. 1986). Within the huge new sample from the SDSS,
Eisenstein et al. (2006) found several new DBs between 30,000 and 40,000 K and a few DOs
between 40,000 and 45,000 K, but there is still a large deficit in this region compared to DAs
of the same temperature, as well as to helium-rich objects above and below the gap. The basic
explanation for the gap is in terms of diffusion and convective mixing (Fontaine and Wesemael
1987; Liebert et al. 1987). The small amount of hydrogen left mixed within the outer layers of
the DOs floats to the top and becomes massive enough to be optically thick around 45,000 K.
The star now appears as a DA.
At about 30,000 K (the exact value depending on the version of the MLT used) the He con-
vection zone expands rapidly upward and downward. If the hydrogen layers are sufficiently thin
in some stars, this hydrogen can be diluted to transform the star into a DB. >Figure 11-13 shows
that the hydrogen mass needs to be of the order of −−−M⊙(Macdonald and Vennes
1991). Again, the exact numbers depend on model details, e.g., the calculations used for the fig-
ure do not include the outer thin hydrogen layer. Among the remaining questions are the slow
separation of the hydrogen in the DO phase: the settling times for He are very short, so there
must be a mechanism delaying the settling. It could be a weak, as yet undetected stellar wind,
or convective mixing. Even at 60,000 K there is a small HeII convection zone remaining high
in the atmosphere, which is receding to deeper layers with the cooling (>Fig. 11-13), perhaps
paving the way for hydrogen to float up?
Many DOs have hydrogen mass fractions in their atmospheres of the order of 1%. If this
is distributed homogeneously throughout the canonical He mass fraction of −, the total H
mass fraction would be −and these stars could never become DBs. Either the He mass is
much smaller in many objects, or the hydrogen is already concentrated in the upper layers in
the DOs.
6.5.2 The DAO and DAB Stars
These are small groups of stars with strong Balmer lines, but HeII or HeI lines of comparable
strength. Some are found close to the expected DO→DA or DA→DB transition temperatures,
which suggests that these stars are just undergoing the transition and therefore show a mixed
H/He atmosphere. Attempts to fit the optical spectra and overall energy distributions with

596 11
White Dwarf Stars
homogeneous or stratified atmosphere models, or spotted surfaces, have had only limited suc-
cess. This may be expected, if the transition is a very dynamical process. Other DABs, however,
have been identified as unresolved DA/DB binaries. Several DAOs have dM companions, oth-
ers have low masses, and it has been suggested that they are descendants of extreme horizontal
branch stars. Overall, these two classes may be rather diverse groups.
6.5.3 DB Stars with Hydrogen Traces: The DBA
In these WDs the hydrogen lines are weak, and the abundances are in the range −–−by
number. Voss et al. (2007) found that more than half of all DBs show some hydrogen; this ratio
has increased in the past with the quality of the observations, and it may be that at some level
almost all DBs have hydrogen traces.
Taking into account the mass in the helium convection zone, which dilutes the hydrogen
content, the total mass of hydrogen increases systematically from −to −M⊙between
24,000 and 10,000 K. Whereas the smaller number is compatible with a recently formed DB
from a DA with a very thin H layer, the latter number would be much too high for a DA→DB
transition at 30,000 K. The only plausible explanation is that this hydrogen is accreted and
accumulated at a rather low average rate of −–−M⊙year−.
6.5.4 Cool White Dwarfs with Metal Traces: DZ, DBZ, DAZ
One of the first three “classical” white dwarfs – van Maanen 2 – showed strong Ca lines in the
optical spectrum, and Ca has remained the only element found in all stars of these types. That
is due to the fact that the CaII ion is the dominant Ca ion at the relevant temperature, and that
it has the resonance lines in the optical range. With high resolution and high SNR, or using
other spectral regions like the UV or FUV, several other elements can be detected, e.g., Mg,
Fe, Si, and several more. It is estimated that – depending on the temperature range and parent
spectral type – between 5% and 25% of all WDs show such traces.
The standard explanation has been the accretion/diffusion scenario with accretion from the
ISM (Dupuis et al. 1992, 1993a,b). However, there have always been doubts, whether the nec-
essary accretion rates are possible in the solar neighborhood, where no dense ISM clouds are
known in the “local bubble.” An even more severe problem is that in most objects the abun-
dance ratio of hydrogen (assumed to stay always on top) and the heavy elements is much less
than solar (or than in the ISM). This can of course only be determined in DZs and DBZs with
helium-dominated atmospheres. Somehow hydrogen is not or much less accreted. These prob-
lems, together with the recent detection of infrared excesses for many of these WDs, now favor
a circumstellar dust disk as the source of the accretion. This new area of research is discussed
in more detail in the next section.
6.5.5 The DQ Stars
DQ stars havea helium atmosphere and traces of carbon, in the form of CI lines or Cmolecular
bands, but generally no other metals. This case is different from the above, because carbon is
expected to be the next element underlying the outer helium layer. If the helium convection
zone penetrates deep enough and the helium mass is not too large, it could be expected that
carbon will be dredged-upand become visible. Earlyexplanation attempts along these lines were

White Dwarf Stars 11
597
dismissed, because in a simple model with a sharp transition between He and C, any mixing
would immediately lead to a carbon-dominated atmosphere. Koester et al. (1982) and Pelletier
et al. (1986) demonstrated that this problem could be solved by assuming a smooth transition as
determined by the diffusion equilibrium between the two elements. The convection zone then
only needs to reach the outer tail of the carbon distribution to provide the observed abundances.
This scenario offers a possibility to estimate the helium-layer masses; recent calculations find
mass fractions of −–−for the bulk of the DQ stars.
Arecent addition tothe WD spectral classification are the “hot DQ” stars, a small groupwith
temperatures between 18,000 and 24,000 K. The atmospheres are dominated by carbon, with
very little if any hydrogen and helium left (Dufour et al. 2008). Consulting >Fig. 11-13 shows
that in the framework of the convective mixing/diffusion scenario DB stars with fractional He
masses of the order of −could mix up the carbon in this temperature range. Interestingly,
several hot DB stars, including the DBV prototype GD358 at 25,000 K, show traces of carbon
in the UV and FUV spectra, but no other heavy elements. This may demonstrate the mixing
process, where the convection zone first reaches the tail of the carbon distribution, in analogy to
the cool DQ with much thicker helium envelopes, and the transformation to carbon-rich occurs
perhaps, when the He convection zone combines with a cvz in the carbon layer. But where are
the carbon-dominated stars below 18,000 K?
The latest twist in the DQ mysteries is the discovery of two objects with carbon lines and
bands, but in addition with OI lines (Gänsicke et al. 2010). A first analysis shows these stars to
have helium-rich atmospheres, polluted with carbon and oxygen, but with an O/C ratio greater
than 1. These are the first WDs with such abundances, and it is speculated that they might be
massive WDs with O/Ne cores and very thin outer He and C layers. Since these WDs probably
originate from progenitors with M > M⊙, they should have masses above 1.0 M⊙. The mass
determination is not possible spectroscopically and will have to wait for a determination of
trigonometric parallaxes.
6.5.6 Evidence for DA to DB Transformation by Convective Mixing?
The evolution of convection zones in DAs shows a large increase in depth between 12,000 and
5,000 K. It was conjectured already by Koester(1976), Vauclair and Reisse (1977), and D’Antona
and Mazzitelli (1979) that this could lead to a dredge-up and transformation of the DA into
a DC. Indirect evidence for this process has accumulated and comes from different lines of
argument:
•
The ratio of DA to non-DA WDs is approximately 4 at Te f f > , K, but decreases to
1.6–2.0 for Te f f < , K, implying the transformation of a significant fraction to helium-
dominated atmospheres, mostly of type DC below 10,000K (Bergeron et al. 2001; Sion 1984;
Sion et al. 2009; Tremblay and Bergeron 2008).
•
The average surface gravity (log g) of DA white dwarfs, which is ≈.for DAs above
12,000 K, rises by about 0.2 dex at lower Te f f . This was first found by Bergeron et al. (1990)
and confirmed in several independent studies since. It is highly unlikely that the average
mass increases for the cooler white dwarfs; an alternative explanation is that helium is mixed
into the hydrogen atmosphere. Because helium has a much lower opacity per mass in this
temperature regime, the pressure in the visible layers is increased. Since the surface gravity
is in effect measured as the pressure generating the line broadening, this cannot be distin-
guished from a real gravity increase. While this is an intriguing solution, there are still other

598 11
White Dwarf Stars
possibilities to explain the increase with deficiencies of the current atmosphere models, in
particular the treatment of convection.
•
Seismological studies of ZZ Ceti (variable DA) stars between 11,000 and 12,000 K show a
range of fractional H masses from −to −(Castanheira and Kepler 2009). Those with
the smallest values should mix with the helium layers just below 10,000 K.
6.5.7 Summary of Spectral Evolution
Obviously convective mixing and gravitational settling/diffusion are the major processes deter-
mining the spectral evolution of white dwarfs. While standard stellar evolution calculations
predict “canonical” layer masses of −for helium and −for hydrogen for the typical WD
with 0.6 M⊙(with substantial modifications depending on the final mass of the WD), the con-
sideration of observed spectral types requires a more complicated scenario. It is hard to avoid
the conclusion that there is a variation of H layer masses in the DAs by several orders of mag-
nitudes, possibly due to ongoing mass-loss toward lower luminosities than currently observed
or predicted by theory. Variations of the remaining H mass could be caused by differences of
the stellar masses and/or different amounts of accretion from the ISM.
Even more complicated is the non-DA sequence, but also in this case much of the evidence
points to a large variation of the helium layer massat the end of the DO phase. While the general
picture seems understood, many details remain open.

Some Areas of Current Interest
In this section some of the areas of WD research a reviewed, which are currently in the focus
and together account for about 80% of annual publications.
7.1 White Dwarfs with Debris Disks
The first infrared excess – radiation clearly in excess of the extrapolated WD photospheric
energy flux – was found for G29–38 by Zuckerman and Becklin (1987), and initially inter-
preted as a possible brown dwarf companion. Later studies demonstrated that the source is more
likely a diffuse dust cloud in the vicinity of the star. The improvement of IR instrumentation
has allowed several large scale surveys in the near and mid IR, identifying more than a dozen
(14 as of Nov. 2009) WDs with similar IR excess. It is estimated that 1–3% of all white dwarfs
have IR indications for circumstellar dust (Farihi et al. 2009). An example for such observations
is shown in >Fig. 11-16. The two components, WD and warm dust, are simply approximated
with blackbody spectra here, but more sophisticated modeling confirms the conclusions.
While the models forthe dust emission (e.g., Jura 2003)donot provide strong constraints for
the morphologyofthe dust, the discoveryofKeplerian motion in a few objects with gas emission
lines (Gänsicke et al. 2006) clearly points to a disk structure, and this is now generally assumed
for all objects with similar IR excess. Such a disk is believed to originate from a minor planet
or some other rocky material of a former planetary system, which has been tidally disrupted in
the vicinity of the WD, forming a “debris disk” (Debes and Sigurdsson 2002; Jura 2003). Simple

models of a geometrically thin, optically thick dust disk with temperatures of 600–1,200 K and
extending between 0.1 and 1.0 R⊙describe the continuum dust emission fairly well, but the
observed strong silicate emission peak near 10 μ requires more sophisticated modeling.
All stars with dust disks show metal pollution in the atmospheres, i.e., they are DAZs
or DBZs. Vice versa, of those with the strongest metal pollution, ≈% show a dust disk.
This strongly suggests a connection between metal accretion and presence of a debris disk.
The majority of the polluted stars, however, does not show IR excess; whether this is observa-
tional bias – the IR emission is too weak to be observed for smaller accretion rates – or whether
ISM accretion has to be invoked as additional source is an open question (Kilic et al. 2006).
Farihi et al. (2010) have presented strong evidence in favor of the circumstellar explanation for
all metal-polluted WDs. In a study of 167 DZs and DAZs from the SDSS they do not find any
correlation between the Ca abundance and the position above the galactic plane or the kine-
matic properties, as would be expected for ISM accretion. They reconsider the accretion physics
for the ISM, and exclude the possibility of Bondi-Hoyle accretion within the local bubble. The
total Ca masses are then much too high to be explained with the much lower Eddington rate.
This together with the very large Ca/H ratio, much larger than the solar ratio, strongly argues
for accretion of the metals from circumstellar material, most likely originated from rocky plan-
etary matter with composition similar to the bulk earth composition. The total hydrogen mass
(which can only increase with time in a helium WD) shows some correlation with stellar age,
and interstellar accretion at a low rate is not excluded.
If the accretion source is a debris disk, it is possible to deduce the chemical composition
of the debris from the photospheric abundances of the WD, using the conclusions derived in
the previous section for the accretion/diffusion scenario. The situation is most obvious for the

hotter DAZs, with diffusion time scales of a few years or less. Here one can justify the assump-
tion of a steady state and obtain heavy element abundance ratios for the debris from those in
the photosphere using the calculated diffusion time scales. In helium atmospheres other argu-
ments have to be invoked to make plausible that the diffusion process is not in a final phase of
diverging abundances. If that can be achieved, the resulting abundance pattern holds impor-
tant clues for the identification of the source of the accreted material (Zuckerman et al. 2007).
Such an example is >Fig. 11-17 from the analysis of the DBZA star GD40 (Klein et al. 2010).
The findings are consistent with rocky planetary material in which heavy elements are largely
contained within oxides, derived from a tidally disrupted minor planet at least the size of Vesta.
The inferred parent body contained at most 10% of water by mass.
7.2 Magnetic White Dwarfs
More than 10% of white dwarfs show magnetic fields in the 1–100 MG range, with tails extend-
ing up to 1,000 MG and down to the observational limit of a few kG. Recent surveys with
large telescopes indicate that even up to 25% may have fields in the kG range. The highest
fields are very difficult or even impossible to study in terrestrial labs and the analysis of mag-
netic WDs (MWD) has been an important tool to verify theoretical calculations in atomic
physics. Observationally these fields are detected through the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines,
spectropolarimetry of lines and absorption edges, as well as broadband polarimetry of the
continuum (Wickramasinghe and Ferrario 2000).

WD0058-044. >Figure 11-19 shows the transition to quadratic Zeeman splitting in the MG
regime for several magnetic DAs detected in the SDSS.
For even higher fields the strength of the magnetic interaction becomes comparable to the
Coulomb interaction in the atom and it is no longer possible to calculate the level shifts with
perturbation methods. This problem could only be solved for the H and He atoms in the last 20
years with very demanding calculations on supercomputers. >Figure 11-20 shows the positions
of the components of Hα to Hγ for fields up to 1,000 MG. These shifts can reach several 1,000 Å,
and it is not surprising that many spectral features were not identified until the advent of the
theoretical calculations.
Since the magnetic fields are not homogeneous on the stellar surface, varying by a factor
of two even in the most simple case of a pure dipole field, most spectral features are smeared
out and become unrecognizable. The detected features are generally associated with “stationary
points,” wavelengths for which the spectral shift reaches an extreme value, either maximum or
minimum. Since to first order the shift is constant at these fields, relatively strong absorption
features remain visible. These are used to determine the typical field strengths on the surface.
Weaker fields below the MG regime can be detected through spectropolarimetry. A spectral
line such as Hα is split into components, and on one side of the line the absorption for left-
handed polarized light is stronger than for right-handed, while it is the opposite on the other
side. This leads to a characteristic circular polarization pattern of a few percent at the position
of the line, as shown in >Fig. 11-21. The intensity spectrum shows no splitting at this resolu-
tion, but the polarization is easily recognized. A similar effect for the bound-free and free–free
absorption coefficients can produce measurable polarization even in the continuum at larger
field strengths.
Theoretical modeling of the atmospheres with the treatment of radiative transfer in a mag-
netized plasma has made large progress in recent years. The aim is to determine the field
strength and the field geometry, in addition to the usual parameters Te f f and log g of a WD.
The first assumption is typically a pure dipole geometry, but much better fits are in many cases

calculations, this is most often achieved by assuming an off-center dipole field, with the cen-
ter of the dipole displaced a fraction of the radius along the magnetic axis (Külebi et al. 2009;
Wickramasinghe et al. 2002).
7.2.1 Origin of Magnetic Fields
The important facts for an understanding of the origin of these fields are:
•
The incidence of at least 10% and possibly up to 25%.
•
Statistically, magnetic WDs have a significantly higher mean mass of ≈.M⊙, compared
to 0.6 M⊙for nonmagnetic WDs (Liebert 1988).

Contrary to nonmagnetic WDs there seem to be very few if any magnetic WDs with a
detached main sequence companion (Liebert et al. 2005c).

Rotation periods seem to have a bi-modal distribution. Most magnetic WDs are slow rota-
tors with periods of days like nonmagnetic WDs, or even longer, up to 100 years. At the
other extreme there is a small group of faster rotators, with periods of hours, down to 725 s.
Because of the high conductivity in the interior of WDs, Ohmic decay times for the fields
(at least the lower multipole orders) are large (≈years), and the fields should be frozen in
the matter. This suggests a fossil origin, and the evolution from the main sequence to WD with
conservation of most of the magnetic flux. Compression of the radius by a factor of 100 thus
demands fields from 0.1 to 10 kG on the main sequence. Such fields are indeed found in the
group of chemically peculiar Ap and Bp stars, whereas nonmagnetic stars of the A/B spectral
types have typical upper limits of 100 G. The fields in these hot stars without large convective
outer layers are assumed to be fossil relics from star formation, in contrast to the lower main

sequence, where a dynamo mechanism can be effective. Ap/Bp stars were long considered as
the natural choice for the magnetic WD progenitors.
While the Ap stars have larger masses than the average progenitor of present day WDs,
simulations using the IFMR for nonmagnetic stars do not reproduce the MWD mass distribu-
tion; one has to assume that the magnetic field changes the IFMR by decreasing the mass loss.
The most significant argument against the Ap origin is, however, the recently increased fraction
of MWDs. Ap/Bp stars can account for less than 7% MWDs, there must therefore be another
source. The problem could be solved by assuming that 40% of main sequence stars with mass
>.M⊙have magnetic fields in the 10–100 G range, which are currently not detectable.
Another possible source has been identified as binary origin through the merging of two
WDs. The WD EUVE J0317-853 shows the clear signature of such a merger: a very high mass
of ≈.M⊙and a fast rotation with 725 s period. This may be the explanation for the group
of fast rotators. A scenario proposed by Tout et al. (2008) goes even further by claiming that all
MWDs with MG fields originate from binary evolution. The starting point of the argumenta-
tion is the observation that not a single WD out of 1,253 WD + dM pairs found in the SDSS
shows a MG magnetic field, whereas at least 10% of single WDs do. The basic idea is that the
magnetic fields are generated by dynamo action during the common envelope phase of binary
evolution, with the magnetic field the stronger the closer the separation is at the end of this
period. Magnetic cataclysmic variables in this view are the pairs which just avoided the merger,
with fields predominantly below 10 MG; those pairs which merge form the high field MWDs.
7.3 Variable White Dwarfs
Long before the first variable white dwarf was detected the time scale for radial pulsations was
estimated to be a few seconds. It was therefore surprising when Landolt (1968) found HL Tau

White Dwarf Stars 11
605
to vary with a period near 12.5 min. The pulsations are nonradial g-mode oscillations, with the
motion at each point not confined to the radial direction. Gravity (g) mode indicates that the
major restoring force is gravity and not pressure as in the radial oscillations. A single oscilla-
tion mode has an amplitude, e.g., at the surface described by spherical harmonics, with similar
“quantum numbers” as in the hydrogenic wave functions. A few up to more than hundred of
such modes can be excited at the same time and be observed as different frequencies in the
power spectra of the light curves. The analysis of these modes – now called “asteroseismology” –
can provide a wealth of information about the interior of the WD: masses, rotation rates,
magnetic fields, structure of the outer H and He layers, and much more.
Variability is observed in four separate instability strips, depending on the spectral type.
DAVs have Te f f around 11,500 K, DBVs around 25,000 K, and DOVs or variable PG1159 stars
in the range 75,000–170,000 K. The most recent addition are the variable hot DQ stars just
below 20,000 K. While this newest class needs further study, for the others the position of the
instability strip is related to a partial ionization zone of the most abundant species (H, He, C,
O). The driving mechanism for the DOV is the classical κ mechanism, while for the DAV and
DBV the interplay of convection and pulsation plays the decisive role, a mechanism termed
“convective driving.”
The methods of asteroseismology, and results for white dwarfs, are discussed in the
>Chap. 4 and in the reviews by Fontaine and Brassard (2008) and Winget and Kepler (2008).
7.4 White Dwarfs in Open and Globular Clusters
The advantage of studying WDs in clusters is similar to that for other stellar classes: a sample
of stars of the same age, at the same distance, the same original metallicity, and well-defined
selection criteria. Additionally, the relation to the progenitor stars is well defined and the turnoff
mass and metallicity of the MS stars are known.
7.4.1 White Dwarfs in Open Clusters
By far the most important aspect of studying WDs in open clusters is the determination of the
initial–final mass relation described in >Sect. 5. Young clusters with high turn-off masses are
most interesting for this study and correspondingly there are only relatively few WD members,
and only the brighter ones can be studied spectroscopically with sufficient accuracy to establish
the IFMR relation.
The cooling ages ofWDs in the clusterprovide in principle a second method forage determi-
nations, independent of the MS fitting technique. Observational difficulties to reach the bottom
of the WD cooling sequence, small samples, uncertainties about the nature of the coolest WDs
(C/O cores vs. He cores, contribution of binaries, question of completeness) have hampered the
comparison of the two methods and led to some conflicting results. A new method, which uses
only the well studied brighter white dwarfs of the cluster seems promising (Jeffery et al. 2007).
About 100 WDs in open clusters have spectroscopically confirmed spectral types. Of these
only four have a non-DA type, and none of these have the cluster membership definitely con-
firmed with proper motion measurements. The reason for this DA/non-DA ratio, which is very
different from that of the field WDs, is unknown (Kalirai et al. 2005).

7.4.2 White Dwarfs in Globular Clusters
A few dozen WDs in the solar neighborhood have been claimed to have halo kinematics, but
many of them are too young, even including the likely progenitor lifetime, to be members of
the oldest stellar population. The status of individual halo white dwarfs, their space density, and
possible contribution to the halo dark matter are not clear at present. Halo white dwarfs can,
however, now be detected and studied in globular clusters with the HST and terrestrial large
telescopes, although the WD cooling sequence is ≈magnitudes below the main sequence.
Problems are obviously the faintness and the crowding of the stellar images, which make spec-
troscopic studies very difficult and confined to the brighter objects. The information learned
about individual WDs as stars is therefore rather limited, and is mostly based on the study of
color-magnitude diagrams (CMD, e.g., >Fig. 11-22):
•
Spectroscopic identifications have so far been obtained only for about 35 cluster WDs, and
they are all of type DA. No helium-rich WDs have been identified. This is similar to the
results for open clusters, and also unexplained (Davis et al. 2009; Kalirai et al. 2009).

•
The WD masses in the clusters as determined from the position in a CMD are roughly
consistent with the range 0.5–0.6 M⊙, as expected from the IFMR for low mass progenitors.
Determinations independentof assuming a known distance, e.g., via a spectroscopic gravity
determination, are just now becoming feasible, and indicate masses of ≈.M⊙for the
youngest WDs in the cluster (Kalirai et al. 2009).
•
The youngest WDs in a cluster seem to have a more extended radial distribution then either
their progenitors or the older WDs. The best explanation is that they have received a modest
velocity kick at birth, before later relaxing to the distribution appropriate for their masses.
•
The cooling sequences in color-magnitude diagram with several thousand WDs can pro-
vide well-defined luminosity functions, with information about the physics of WD cooling.
Such data have been used to show that including the latent heat of the crystallization in the
interior results in better fits (Winget et al. 2009).
More important is the prospect of using white dwarfs as a tool to determine ages and dis-
tances independent of the method of MS fitting. The distance determination works in a very
similar way to the MS fitting technique: the position of the WD sequence in a CMD is compared
to theoretical cooling tracks, or to the absolute magnitudes of WDs in the solar neighborhood
with known distances. The advantage of this method is that the theoretical WD tracks are much
simpler than MS evolution; they do not depend on metallicity, or assumptions about convec-
tive overshooting. One does need, however, a spectral classification to determine the presence
or not of outer hydrogen layers, and, most important, an independent determination of the
mass or surface gravity. This is not yet possible to the necessary extent, but the first attempts
have demonstrated the potential of these methods (Kalirai et al. 2009; Layden et al. 2005).
Age determinations rely on identifying the end of the WD cooling sequence, a very chal-
lenging task at the limit of current possibilities. First results, e.g., 12 Gyear for NGC 6121, agree
with main sequence determinations within the errors (Bedin et al. 2009).
7.5 White Dwarfs in Binaries
One of the most famous WDs is Sirius B, companion to the very bright star Sirius. The system
is close to the sun and the binary orbit can be studied, resulting in one of the very few very
accurate WD masses. Because of the 10 mag brightness difference in the optical such systems
cannot be studied or even found at larger distances and are very likely underrepresented in our
WD samples. If the white dwarfs in these systems are hot like Sirius B, they can be detected by
the excess radiation in the UV or EUV. Subsequent attempts with HST to resolve these systems
have shown that most of them have separations (and therefore periods) too large to lead to orbit
determinations in the nearer future, but a few promising cases remain (Barstow et al. 2001).
The contribution of these systems to the total number of WDs is uncertain, but because of the
increase of the IMF toward smaller masses probably much smaller than that of WDs with low
mass companions. If the definition of “Sirius-like” includes all MS companions with spectral
type of K or earlier, then the contribution to the total WD number in the local sample is 8%
(Holberg 2009).
Binaries are much more easily detected, if the companion is a dM star of similar brightness
as the WD. Indications are colors that are much too red for a white dwarf, infrared excesses,
contributions with molecular features in the red part of the optical or near IR spectrum, or
emission features (from the dM) in the cores of the Balmer absorption lines. The SDSS is a rich
source of such systems, with several thousands identified already.

608 11
White Dwarf Stars
These binaries were initially main sequence binaries in which the more massive star evolved
through the giant phase and became a white dwarf. In most cases the separation of the main
sequence binary was wide and the evolution of the WD is essentially the same as that of a
single star. For those with smaller separation the more massive star may engulf its compan-
ion while evolving into a red giant, and the system enters the common-envelope phase, with
transfer of mass and angular momentum leading to the ejection of the envelope. The study
of the exposed post-common-envelope binaries is the best empirical test for the details of the
common-envelope phase and the subsequent evolution to shorter periods by magnetic braking.
If the separation becomes small enough, with periods of a few hours, the binary will become
a cataclysmic variable, with another mass transfer phase from the secondary to the WD. These
systems are discussed in more detail in the
>Chap. 13.
7.5.1 Double Degenerates
Binaries consisting of two WDs are interesting as a possible source of Supernova Ia explosions. If
they are close, with periods below 10 h, they will lose angular momentum through the radiation
of gravitational waves and merge within a Hubble time. With a combined mass larger than
the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 M⊙, that merger would result in a supernova explosion. The
recent search “Supernova Ia Progenitor Survey” (SPY, Napiwotzki et al. 2001) for radial velocity
variations in apparently single WDs turned out ≈new such pairs, but only one or two
fulfill the conditions as SNIa progenitor. For all others, the periods are too large to lead to a
merger, or the combined masses are below the Chandrasekhar limit. These lower mass binaries
might explain the high mass peak in the WD mass distribution around 0.9 M⊙(Vennes 1999).
The SNIa scenario favored by most authors now is the single degenerate channel, with a white
dwarf accreting mass from a non-degenerate companion.
Double-degenerates can also be detected in a color-magnitude diagram, because they seem
too bright for their color. Assuming a single star, the radius determined is large, indicating an
apparent very low mass.

Suggestions for Further Reading and Useful Resources
More than 600 research papers on white dwarfs are published every year, and not all of their
areas of research are covered in this chapter. Moreover, because of space limitations, only very
few references are given in the text, and the selection is highly biased. Sometimes historically
important papers are cited, sometimes more recent papers, because they give the latest results,
or a good summary of the previous literature. When statements are made without reference, it
should not be assumed that they are ideas of this author. To correct for this bias the reader is
encouraged to consult reviews or other important papers, a selection of which is given here.
General aspects of physics and astrophysics of WDs are discussed in Hansen (2004) and
Koester and Chanmugam (1990). The latter covers all aspects of the interior physics, evolution,
and atmospheres, and a brief historical review. The former concentrates on “cool white dwarfs,”
but covers much of the physics relevant for all WDs. Observational data and analysis of cool
white dwarfs is also the topic in Hansen and Liebert (2003) and Bergeron et al. (2001).

An overview of white dwarf evolution with special emphasis on the applications of white
dwarfs to determine ages of stellar systems (“white dwarf cosmochronology”) is Fontaine et al.
(2001). Among papers to read for the topic of variable WDs are the reviews by Winget and
Kepler (2008), Fontaine et al. (2003), and Fontaine and Brassard (2008).
Kinematics and galactic distribution are discussed in Reid (2005), the local sample of
white dwarfs in Sion et al. (2009) and Holberg et al. (2008). Magnetic fields are surveyed in
Wickramasinghe and Ferrario (2000), Jordan (2009), Tout et al. (2008), Wickramasinghe and
Ferrario (2005), Liebert et al. (2005c), Ferrario and Wickramasinghe (2005).
Further reading for WD-MS binaries are Silvestri et al. (2007), Rebassa-Mansergas
et al. (2009), Augusteijn et al. (2008), for double degenerates Napiwotzki et al. (2007) and
Parthasarathy et al. (2007); and for rotation and angular momentum in white dwarfs Berger
et al. (2005) and Karl et al. (2005).
The field of WDs with debris disks is so new and fast changing that any reference list will
shortly be outdated. Good starting points are currently Farihi et al. (2009), Kilic et al. (2006),
Gänsicke et al. (2006), Farihi et al. (2008), Mullally et al. (2007), von Hippel et al. (2007), Debes
and Sigurdsson (2002), Jura (2003), Zuckerman (2001).
As a general source of information about the current status of white dwarf research the
“European Workshops on White Dwarfs” are highly recommended. This series of meetings was
founded in Kiel (Germany) in 1974 and has been held bi-annually with few exceptions since.
Proceedings have been published since the meeting of 1990 in Toulouse.
Valuable resources are of course also available in the WEB. The SAO/NASA Astrophysics
Data System (ADS) and the SIMBAD database at Centre de Données astronomiques de Stras-
bourg hardly need mentioning – no astronomer can work without those. For white dwarfs very
useful are the collections of evolutionary tracks, mass–radius relations, colors, and other infor-
mation of the Argentinian group at La Plata
http://fcaglp.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/evolgroup/tracks.html
and the Canadian group at Montreal
http://www.astro.umontreal.ca/~bergeron/CoolingModels
Matt Woods evolutionary tracks for cooling white dwarfs are older, but still widely used. They
are available at
http://www.astro.fit.edu/wood/wd.html
Many PhD theses with white dwarf or related topics are collected at
http://whitedwarf.org
This includes a number of authors, who are well-known white dwarf experts today! The famous

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12

Abstract:
Black holes and neutron stars are the compact remnants of massive stars. They rep-
resent one of the key intersections between astronomy and fundamental physics – both are
classes of objects which are sufficiently compact that Newtonian gravity cannot be used to
describe the forces near their surfaces. The structure of neutron stars furthermore presents one
of the few key tests of the equation of state of nuclear matter. This chapter will review some of
the key theoretical results underpinning the current understanding of neutron stars and black
holes. It will also describe the observations of neutron stars and black holes both in isolation (as
thermal emitters and as radio pulsars for the case of neutron stars) and in close binaries, where
accretion processes can make these objects bright X-ray sources. Additionally, this chapter will
detail the formation processes of both neutron stars and black holes in general, and also the
formation of close binaries containing such objects.

Introduction
The observational study of neutron stars and black holes has developed almost entirely in the
past 50 years; the articles for the first edition of “Stars and Stellar Systems” were set to press just
as the first cosmic X-ray sources were being discovered. These soon came to be understood to
provide the first observational evidence for neutron stars and black holes in the Galaxy. More
than 5 years later came the first publication of the discovery of radio pulsars. Some observation
evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes had been found already by that time [for
example, the discovery of strong, extremely broad optical emission lines from some galactic
nuclei, seen by Seyfert in 1943, and an optical jet being ejected by the supermassive black hole
in M87 has been known even further back (Curtis 1918)]. However, the interpretation of the
active galactic nuclei as accretion onto black holes did not gain traction until well into the 1960s
(Salpeter 1964) nor did it achieve a consensus until the 1970s. Over the past several decades,
the wealth of data from across the wavelength spectrum, from radio through gamma-rays, has
greatly increased the level of understanding of how matter behaves near compact objects.
Black holes and neutron stars are astrophysically important objects for a variety of reasons.
Both classes of objects represent the end stages of stellar evolution of massive stars – the stars
that form the bulk of the heavy elements in the Universe. Understanding the formation of black
holes and neutron stars is thus an essential part ofunderstanding how the Universe is chemically
enriched to the point in can produce life. After all, matter locked up in a black hole or a neutron
star represents core material which has not been injected into the interstellar medium.
Both classes of compact objects also represent objects which can be used to test ideas about
fundamental physics. Black holes can be used to determine whether general relativity is, indeed,
the correct formulation of gravity. General relativity is also important for understanding the
structure of neutron stars, and neutron stars also provide one of Nature’s opportunities to study
the properties of matterat nuclear density. Both pulsars and black hole X-ray binaries have been
associatedwith high-energy gamma-rayemission, and, more tenuously, with cosmic rays – they
may thus also serve as particle accelerators more powerful than any yet built on Earth. These
objects are also strong candidates for producing the low-energy positron background seen from
the Galactic Center region.

Black Holes and Neutron Stars
Comparisons between the accretion process onto stellar-mass black holes and that seen onto
the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei can yield important information about
which parts of the accretion process are “scale-free,” and which show significant differences as a
function of the accretor mass. There are also facets of the accretion process which can be studied
only with stellar-mass black holes because of the higher signal-to-noise ratio one can obtain
from them and because the characteristic timescales of accretion are generally proportional to
black hole mass, making some variability features inaccessible in supermassive black holes on
timescales shorter than the lifetimes of typical astronomers. Accretion onto neutron stars can
be used to compare with accretion onto black holes. Since the mass differences between neutron
stars and stellar-mass black holes are relatively small and the gravitational potential well depths
are nearly the same for both cases, the differences can often be ascribed to the presence of a
surface and/or a magnetic field in the neutron star accretors.
More speculatively, both neutron stars and black holes may be important sources of grav-
itational radiation. Mergers involving two black holes, two neutron stars, or a black hole and
a neutron star are among the few candidate classes of event that should be able to produce
gravitational radiation both strong enough and in the right frequency range for detection by
ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Pulsar binaries already represent the best evidence
to date for indirect gravitational radiation as their excellent clocks can be used to measure their
orbital period derivatives to a precision greater than other techniques.
This article will start with an introduction of the general properties of neutron stars and
black holes, followed by a discussion of the mechanisms which allow them to cause the emission
of radiation (either directly from neutron stars themselves, or from accretion disks surrounding
compact objects from either class), and will close with a discussion of their formation and evo-
lution. While this approach may seem counterintuitive, given that, obviously, a compact object
must form before it can emit, an understanding of the emission processes from compact objects
is necessary for understanding the selection effects that come into population studies of these
classes of objects.

Neutron Stars
The first suggestion that neutron stars might exist came from the work of Baade and Zwicky
(1934), who showed that the total energy radiated in a supernova was about ergs and argued
that one of the few plausible sources of such an amount of energy would be from collapsing a
star down to a very small radius, at which point it would have nuclear density, and consist
primarily of neutrons. It has since been realized that the total energy release from supernovae
is dominated by neutrinos, rather than radiation or kinetic energy, and hence that the total
energy release from a supernova is about an order of magnitude larger than Baade and Zwicky
had estimated.On the other hand, it has become more widely accepted that the means by which
this energy is generated is the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star into a neutron
star or a black hole.
Neutron stars are upheld by degeneracy pressure between nucleons (and, perhaps, free
quarks) in their cores. The term “neutron star” implies that these objects are composed almost
entirely of neutrons. However, there is strong evidence that these stars contain thin envelopes
of normal matter, and there are speculative suggestions that these stars may contain substantial
components of other more exotic forms of matter, such as free quarks. The density inside a
neutron star is large enough that protons and electrons can combine to form neutrons.

2.1 Structure of Neutron Stars
A full understanding of the structure of neutron stars requires an in-depth knowledge of nearly
all areas of modern physics. Neutron stars have combinations of masses and radii that leave
them within a factor of a few of becoming black holes. Their structure depends heavily on the
interactions between nucleons at densities slightly higher than those in atomic nuclei. Their
inner cores are often thought to be superconducting, and in some cases, they may contain
substantial numbers of “free” quarks.
One of the key reasons that studies of neutron stars are important is that the neutron star
equation of state places important constraints on how matter behaves at nuclear densities. Equa-
tions of state are referred to as “hard” if they have a weak dependence of radius on mass, and
“soft” if they have a stronger dependence of radius on mass. Both the maximum and minimum
masses of neutron stars are of considerable interest. The maximum mass of a neutron star is
determined by the stiffness of the equation of state of the neutron star. An equation of state is
referred to as soft if density depends strongly on pressure, while it is referred to as stiff if den-
sity depends weakly on pressure. Soft equations of state therefore can be ruled out if high-mass
neutron stars can be observed.
The minimum mass of a neutron star comes from the requirement that β-decay of neutrons
in the star is not effective. Under normal densities, free neutrons will decay via β emission.
However, at very high matter densities, all electron energies levels up to the energy of the elec-
tron to be emitted can be filled (see, e.g., Shapiro and Teukolsky 1983 reference work for a more
detailed discussion). If the density of a star is below this critical density, it cannot contain the
number of free neutrons seen in neutron stars; the neutrons will decay via β emission into elec-
trons and protons. The star will then be supported by electron degeneracy pressure rather than
nucleon degeneracypressure. Undernormal conditions ofstellarevolution, this minimum mass
for a neutron star is not physically relevant – the minimum mass for a neutron star is smaller
than the maximum mass for a white dwarf, and normal stellar evolutionary processes will not
pass through the region of parameter space with very small radius and medium core mass,
where a low mass neutron star might exist. However, under some circumstances, binary evolu-
tion might produce an object which starts out as a neutron star but eventually falls below the
minimum neutron star mass. This could happen, for example, if the neutron star is in a close
binary with either a black hole or a heavier neutron star, and is transferring matter onto that
object by Roche lobe overflow (see below). This transformation would be likely to result in a
neutrino-rich explosion.

Black Holes
Black holes are in many ways Nature’s simplest objects. Like fundamental particles, they can be
described by only three numbers – charge, mass, and spin. Unlike fundamental particles, only
their charges are likely to be effectively quantized – the spins and masses of black holes should
reside in the fully “classical” limit. Charge of black holes is generally neglected for astrophysical
purposes as a charged black hole should quickly acquire a particle of the opposite charge and
neutralize itself.
A few key results from general relativity are important for understanding observable effects

in the wavelength of light for observers located at different depths in gravitational potential
wells. A black hole is an object which is sufficiently dense that it has a surface where the
gravitational redshift becomes infinite. This surface is called the event horizon.
The equations for a nonrotating black hole were solved by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916,
relatively soon after Einstein published his theory of general relativity. As a result, nonrotat-
ing black holes are often referred to as “Schwarzschild black holes.” The radius of the event
horizon is called the Schwarzschild radius and is RSCH = GM/c. A related scale param-
eter called the gravitational radius, defined to be GM/c, is often used in relativity. It is an
interesting curiosity that this expression can be obtained correctly, albeit through incorrect
reasoning, by setting the Newtonian escape velocity equal to the speed of light and solving for
radius.
More than about 20 Schwarzschild radii from a black hole, the general relativistic correc-
tions to Newtonian gravity are quite small. However, close to a black hole, there are some
fundamental differences between general relativity and Newtonian gravity, apart from just the
gravitational redshift. One important such effect with observable consequences is that there
exists an innermost radius, inside which no stable circular orbits can exist. It is generally pre-
sumed that emission from an accretion disk will also be truncated at this radius as the orbits will
be “plunging orbits” over which viscosity is unlikely to be important. Some debate has existed
in recent years about whether magnetic coupling across this boundary could lead to significant
emission from inside the innermost stable circular orbit, but the most recent work on the topic
indicates that such effects are likely to be quite small (Shafee et al. 2006).
Rotating black holes have presented a greater challenge to theorists. The solution to
Einstein’s equations for rotating black holes was first presented by Kerr (1963) – it is called the
Kerr metric, and rotating black holes are often referred to as “Kerr black holes.” In fact, given the
difficulty in obtaining the solution, it is surprising how simply one can express the key observ-
able results of the Kerr metric. The dimensionless angular momentum a is defined to be the
angular momentum J divided by Mc. If one expresses the Schwarschild radius as rs in gravita-
tional radii, then the event horizon of a Kerr black hole can be given as
rs+
√
r
s −a

. Therefore,
as a approaches unity, the event horizon radius approaches the gravitational radius.
A second important characteristic radius for Kerr black holes is the radius of the “ergo-
sphere.” The ergosphere is defined as the region within which a stationary particle would not
experience a proper time. Within this region, particles are “dragged” by the inertia of the black
hole to rotate in the same direction as the black hole. The radius of the ergosphere is given by
rs+
√
r
s −acosθ

.
Finally, we can consider the innermost stable circular orbits around Kerr black holes. As a
result of the inertia effects of the black hole on the spacetime around it, the innermost stable
circular orbit differs for prograde and retrograde rotation. For prograde rotation about a max-
imally rotating black hole, the innermost stable circular orbit is at the event horizon, while for
counter-rotating orbits, the innermost radius is at nine gravitational radii.
The case of rotation with an axis which is misaligned from the spin axis of the black hole is
an interesting one. Exactly what happens in such circumstances is rather difficult to calculate.
For a viscous disk of gas, there should be some radius within which the inertial frame dragging
due to the black hole’s spin forces the accretion disk to become warped, such that it is forced
to rotate with an axis closer to that of the black hole’s at smaller radii (Bardeen and Petterson
1975). The details of how that happens depend not just on general relativistic effects, but also
on more complicated disk physics.

X-Ray Binaries
Much of what is currently known about neutron stars, and nearly all that is currently known
about stellar-mass black holes comes from observations ofX-raybinaries (additional knowledge
about black holes comes from studies of active galactic nuclei, covered in another volume of
this series). An X-ray binary is a system containing either a neutron star or a black hole in a
close binary system with a “normal star” (including, in some cases, white dwarf donor stars and
objects of insufficient mass to support hydrogen fusion). The system must be close enough for
mass to be transferred from the “normal” star onto the black hole or neutron star. >Fig. 12-1
shows a computer-generated visualization of an X-ray binary.
4.1 Classes of X-Ray Binaries
X-raybinaries can be classified both bythe nature ofthe compact accretor(black hole orneutron
star) and by the nature of the donor star. There exists a broader variety of classes of donor stars
than accretors. Two broad classes, high-mass X-ray binaries (with mass donors of > M⊙) and
low-mass X-ray binaries (with mass donors less than about 1 M⊙) have been used broadly in
the literature. This classification obviously ignores the existence of X-ray binaries whose donor

Black Holes and Neutron Stars
stars are in the intermediate range of 1–8 M⊙, a class whose membership in catalogs of known
objects has expanded significantly in the past decade or so. These systems are sometimes clas-
sified as low-mass X-ray binaries, but in other cases, they are classified, more appropriately, as
intermediate-mass X-ray binaries.
As is traditional when astronomers break objects into two classes, the need for subclasses
of X-ray binaries has become apparent. Both the high-mass and low-mass X-ray binaries can
contain either black holes or neutron stars as accretors. Additionally, there are subclasses based
on the specifics of the type of donor star, and properties of the accretion.

The Basics of Accretion
It is first noted that much of the material in this section is drawn from the excellent reference
work by Frank et al. (1995), which covers the basics of accretion in considerable detail. There are
two major processes by which accretion can take place. The first is Roche lobe overflow, where
matter spills from a donor star onto an accretor, because some of the matter in the outer regions
of the donor star is more strongly gravitationally attracted to the accretor than to the donor. The
second is wind accretion, where a star captures material being ejected from another star.
Let us first consider the case of Roche lobe overflow. The Roche lobe of a star is a roughly
teardrop–shaped surface of equipotential in a binary star system, calculated by taking into
account both the gravitational and rotational effects on the potential. The inner Lagrangian
point, L, is the location where the two Roche lobes meet. It is a saddle point for the Roche
potential. When a star is larger than its Roche lobe matter will be transferred from it onto is
binary companion through the Lpoint.
A few key rules of thumb regarding Roche lobe overflowing systems are important. First,
there are a few well-established analytic approximations for the sizes of Roche lobes:
R
a =
.q/
.q/+ ln(+ q/),
(12.1)
which comes from Eggleton (1983), and R/a = Max(.[/(+ q)]/, .+ .logq),
which comes from Paczynski (1971). In both formulae, q = M/M, where Mis the mass
of the donor star, and Mis the mass of the accretor. Eggleton’s formula is accurate to higher
precision over a wider range of mass ratios.
Paczynski’s formula, at least for low-mass ratios, where the first term will dominate, is more
convenient for use in analytical approximations. One of the more well-known and useful appli-
cations of Paczynski’s formula is the derivation of the mass-period relation for X-ray binaries.
For low-mass main-sequence stars, it can be shown that the mass of the donor star in a Roche
lobe overflowing system will be 0.11 times the orbital period in hours. The orbital periods of
binary systems are generally much easier to measure than the masses of their secondary stars.
It should be noted that evolved stars will be considerably less dense than main-sequence stars
of the same mass, so the period-mass relation should normally be taken as a useful means of
estimating an upper limit to the donor star mass.
Accretion will not take place merely because a star fills its Roche lobe; it must overflow the
Roche lobe. The accretion process is thus continually driven by three processes in Roche lobe
overflowing binaries, with the dominant process depending on the mass and evolutionary state
of the donor star. For relatively high-mass stars, the nuclear evolution of the donor star leads to
its expansion and, hence, to continued accretion.

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
621
In the absence of substantial evolution in the radius of the donor star, angular momentum
loss is required to keep the two stars in contact. For stars in very short-period orbits, gravi-
tational radiation will provide a substantial loss of angular momentum. This can be especially
important in systems where the mass donor is a white dwarf star, since white dwarfs can be
quite massive even for very short orbital periods. For stars in intermediate period orbits, mag-
netic braking will be the dominant source of angular momentum loss. Magnetic braking occurs
when the wind of the mass donor is forced to move through its magnetic field. The details of how
the magnetic braking process works and what is an appropriate prescription for the magnetic
braking angular momentum loss are still areas of active research.
The other major process by which mass transfer can take place is through wind accretion.
Typically, for X-ray binaries, wind accretion comes from the winds of massive stars. Among
these systems, the overall number of X-ray binaries where the donor star is a Be star, rather
than a more “normal” O/B star dominates. In any given epoch, however, the majority of the
wind-fed X-ray binaries will be those fed by the more spherically symmetric winds of massive
stars, rather than from the excretion disks of Be stars. There also exists a small class of objects
called symbiotic stars, where accretion takes place from a red giant donor’s wind. A much larger
population of symbiotic stars with white-dwarf accretors is known to exist as well.
The problem of wind mass transfer can be modelled in a manner very similar to the Bondi–
Hoyle accretion problem. The compact object in a binary system is assumed to accrete any gas
that becomes gravitationally bound to it. This leads to a rather strong dependence of the mass
accretion rate on the wind speed of the donor star and, hence, to large uncertainties in the
predicted accretion rate.
Once mass transfer has started, an important question is why the gas falls in toward the
compact object. Early models of accretion disks posited the existence of a form of viscosity
that could lead gas to fall inward. They parameterized the viscosity in terms of a parameter α,
such that:
ν = αcsH,
(12.2)
where ν is the viscosity, cs is the sound speed in the gas, and H is the scale height of the
accretion disk.
The magnetorotational instability (Balbus and Hawley1991) is the most commonly invoked
mechanism for producing this viscosity. This instability requires only a small vertical magnetic
field to work. The magnetic forces act toward forcing rigid body rotation in the disk. The effect,
then on a fluid element which is displaced outward is that the magnetic field forces it to rotate
faster than the Keplerian speed at its new radius, pushing it still further outward. This hence
enables a small amount of gas to transport a large amount of angular momentum outward
through the disk, allowing the rest of the gas to flow inward.
The efficiency of accretion is an important parameter. Apart from matter-anti-matter anni-
hilation, accretion ontoblack holes and neutron stars is the most efficient process in the universe
in terms of the amount of energy that can be produced per unit matter. Nuclear fusion can
produce about 9 MeV per nucleon, if one considers the fusion of hydrogen all the way into
iron. If one defines the efficiency of energy production of a process, η to be E/(Mc), this
corresponds to an efficiency of about −for nuclear fusion. For fusion of hydrogen into
helium, the efficiency is a factor of about 10 lower than this value. In the Newtonian limit,
the efficiency of accretion is GM/(R∗). For a white dwarf, this yields a value of about −–
smaller than the efficiency of nuclear fusion – while for accretion onto a neutron star, this yields
about 0.2. However, only half the gravitational energy of a Keplerian disk is radiated, with the
other half going into the increase in the rotational energy of the material as it falls inward.

622 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
At the surface of the neutron star, a boundary layer is formed. Some of the rotational energy in
the boundary layer will be radiated away, and some will go into increasing the rotational veloc-
ity of the neutron star. Therefore, typically, GM/(R∗) is often taken as the radiative efficiency
of a neutron star.
For a black hole, the situation is much more complicated. Newtonian gravity clearly does
not apply, and a fully relativistic calculation must be done. It can be shown that the radiative
efficiency of a nonrotating black hole’s accretion disk will be about 0.06, while that for a pro-
grade disk around a maximally rotating black hole will be about 0.42 (Shapiro and Teukolsky
1983). These values are derived by taking the inner radius of the disk to be the radius at which
the innermost stable circular orbit of the disk is found and applying the relativistic corrections
due to gravitational redshifts from that radius. However, it bears mention that black holes, due
to the presence of the event horizon, need not radiate away all the power released by the gravi-
tational fall of material into them. This is especially true if the gravitational energy is locked up
in protons, rather than in electrons. Furthermore, in nearly all classes of accreting objects, there
exists evidence for jets launched from somewhere in the inner accretion flows. There are some
indications that the jets may, in some cases, carry away more kinetic power than the radiated
luminosity of the accretion flow.
Spectral modelling of X-ray binaries has typically focused (not surprisingly) on their X-ray
and γ-ray emission, although in recent years, a growing number of simultaneous or nearly
simultaneous monitoring campaigns have been undertaken including radio, infrared, and opti-
cal data, in addition to the high-energy data. Several components are frequently required to fit
the spectra of X-ray binaries. The physics behind these components will be described in this
section, with the details of the spectra of real accreting objects described in >Sect. 6.3.
5.1 Geometrically Thin Accretion Disks
The “standard” model of an accretion disk around a relativistic star comes from Shakura and
Sunyaev (1973). In the context of the Shakura–Sunyaev model, the X-ray spectrum of a geo-
metrically thin, optically thick accretion disk can be described very well as the sum of a series
of annuli, each of which emits as a black body with a temperature scaling as R−/. Some cor-
rections are made for relativistic effects and for the effects of scattering of the photons in the
atmosphere of the accretion disk so that estimating the best-fitting inner disk radius, as naively
estimated from model fits underestimates the real inner disk radius, typically by a factor of
about 3 (see for example, Merloni et al. 2000).
5.2 Comptonization Regions
It was realized early on in the history of high-energy astrophysics that some X-ray binaries
showed power in the soft γ-rays at luminosities far in excess of what could be explained from
purely thermal models for energy production, and that some sources would switch between
being dominated by soft X-rays and dominated by soft gamma-rays (e.g., Tananbaum et al.
1972). A natural explanation of such emission is Compton scattering in a geometrically thick,
optically thin cloud of hot gas (Thorne and Price 1975). Such clouds can be maintained as hot if
there is weak Coloumb coupling between the protons and electrons in the plasma so that most
of the energy is advected by the black hole, rather than radiated away (Ichimaru 1977; Narayan
and Yi 1994).

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
623
Compton scattering can be expected to produce power-law spectra, even if the energies
of the electrons off which the scattering takes place do not follow a power-law distribution.
Each Compton scattering event will, statistically speaking, result in the multiplication of the
photon energy by a constant (presuming that the initial photon energy is small relative to the
typical electron energy). This will be kT
me cin the nonrelativistic regime, and ( kT
me c)in the highly
relativistic regime. The number of scatterings will follow Max(τ, τ) to good approximation for
scattering in a homogeneous, spherical medium, where τ is the optical depth of the medium
(there will be some deviations from the latter law due to the fact that Compton scattering has
some directional dependence and due to the fact that the scattering medium cannot be infinite
in size). This leads to a power-law distribution of photons since the number of photons at high
energies will be the fraction of photons at low energies multiplied by the probability that enough
amplifications take place to reach the high energy. As the photon energies approach the kT of
the electrons, the amplification will become weaker, leading to a cutoff in the energy spectrum.
Additionally, the results above can be used, in some cases, to rule out thermal Comptoniza-
tion as an emission model. For sufficiently high electron temperatures, kT >> mec. This can
then lead to substantial amplification of the photon energy per scattering. A result of Compton
scattering in such a high-temperature medium would then be to produce “bumps” in the spec-
trum, rather than a smooth power law. Therefore, a smooth power-law spectrum with no cutoff
in the power law out to energies of ∼MeV is a strong indicator that thermal Comptonization
is not the dominant energy production mechanism for the power law (see, e.g., Coppi 1999).
It can be, in such cases, that the electrons have a nonthermal energy distribution, as might be
expected if they are accelerated in magnetic reconnection events, for example. This may rep-
resent a good explanation of what is happening in the handful of systems with power laws out
to several MeV, with no discontinituities in the soft X-rays, as would be expected for thermal
Comptonization from a kT∼keV plasma.
5.3 Reprocessing Components
Some additional components are often seen in the spectra of X-ray binaries which are best
explained as reprocessing of hard X-rays producing in the Comptonizing region by the optically
thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. Notably, these include emission lines (the strongest
being from iron Kα at 6.4–6.7 keV, depending on the ionization state of the disk), and a “reflec-
tion bump” which is a continuum component peaking around 30 keV, as well as some edges,
primarily due to partially ionized states of oxygen and iron. The first discussions of the effects
of photoionization of cold gas by X-ray sources can be found in Basko et al. (1974), while
the most commonly used spectral models for this effect are presented in Magdziarz and
Zdziarski (1995).
Additionally, in many low-mass X-ray binaries, much of the emission from the geometri-
cally thin, optically thick accretion disk is thought to be reprocessed X-ray emission, rather
than energy produced from viscous heating of the disk (in most high-mass X-ray binaries, the
optical luminosity of the donor star will dominate over that of the accretion flow components).
Support for this idea comes largely from the evidence that the optical luminosities of X-ray
binaries increase both with X-ray luminosity and with orbital period, following well what is
expected for a model in which the optical emission is reprocessed X-ray emission (van Paradijs
and McClintock 1994), but there exists also additional timing information that indicates this in
many cases.

Black Holes and Neutron Stars
5.4 Emission from Relativistic Jets
Some X-ray binaries show strong radio emission. An excellent review of jets from X-ray binaries
is that of Fender (2006). It can be shown easily that the radio emission from X-ray binaries must
come from an outflow, rather than from the accretion inflow. The brightness temperature of a
radio source can be defined as:
TB =
c
kbνIν
(12.3)
Note that this is referred to as a brightness temperature because it is the temperature required
for the flux to be produced in the Rayleigh–Jeans part of blackbody emitter’s spectrum. Where
the brightness temperature is above K, the emission mechansism cannot be unbeamed
incoherent synchrotron radiation. One can thus use this argument to infer that the radio emis-
sion region in many systems is likely to be considerably larger than the binary separation, thus
requiring the emission come from an outflow.
In many systems, the jet emission shows a flat spectrum, all the way from the radio through
the infrared. This flat spectrum radio emission is most commonly explained as the emission
from a compact, conical jet (e.g., Blandford and Konigl 1979; Hjellming and Johnston 1988).
In the context of these models, the flat spectrum occurs due to the superposition of a series of
synchrotron self-absorbed peaks, with the self-absorption frequency varying as a function of
radius.
In othersystems, where the jet poweris emitted overa more spatiallyextended region, the jet
spectrum is a fν ∝ν−.power law. This power law is what is expected from synchrotron emis-
sion from a distribution of relativistic electrons with a power-law index of 2.4 (i.e., dN
dE ∝E−.).
In a few cases, emission has also been seen from an interaction site far from the X-ray binary,
where the jet presumably collided with an overdensity in the interstellar medium.
The historically best well-known radio emitting X-ray binaries are all high-massX-ray bina-
ries – Cygnus X-1, Cygnus X-3, and SS 433. The latter two, in particular, have very dense stellar
winds in the vicinity of where the jet is launched, and it is likely in both cases that the radiative
power of the jet in enhanced by interactions with the stellar wind. In SS 433, emission lines are
seen in both the optical and X-rays (Margon et al. 1979; Kotani et al. 1994), indicating that the
jet is likely to be entraining material from a thick accretion disk.
5.4.1 Emission from the Neutron Star Surface and Boundary Layer
Finally, in the neutron star systems, there can also be emission from either the surface of the
neutron star or from a boundary layer very close to it. In some systems, where the accretion rate
is high and the boundary layer is optically thick, this emission is rather straightforward and is
well fitted by a black-body component in the X-ray spectrum. In some other cases, there exists
little evidence for boundary layer emission in the X-rays – although this can indicate either
a low-temperature boundary layer, emitting at sub-X-ray energies, or a higher temperature,
optically thin boundary layer, merged in with the Comptonizing component.
Emission directly from the surface of a neutron star in an X-ray binary is especially impor-
tant. It is believed that during outbursts of X-ray transient systems, the neutron star itself can
be heated by the accretion energy. Understanding the rate of cooling of the neutron star can be
important for understanding the internal structure of the neutron star – if the neutron star’s

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
625
internal energy, as estimated from its surface temperature, varies more quickly than the inter-
gration of its thermal emission over time, then one needs to invoke other cooling mechanisms,
such as, for example, neutrino cooling (see, e.g., Rutledge et al. 2002; Wijnands et al. 2004).
5.5 Variability Measurement Techniques
For a comprehensive review of variability of X-ray binaries, see van der Klis (2006). Variabil-
ity studies hold an important place in the current state of understanding of black hole and
neutron star accretion disks. X-ray binaries frequently show variability with ∼% root-mean
squared amplitudes on timescales of seconds and can show variability of factors of about on
timescales ofyears. Results from variabilitystudies are, in general, much more constraining than
spectral observations. Most spectroscopic results, especially for continuum components, can be
explained by a wide range of source geometries. In contrast, many variability phenomena have
been well known for decades without satisfactory theoretical explanations. At the same time,
calibration of variability data is far easier than calibration of spectroscopic data, meaning that
any well-understood results from X-ray timing is likely to be far more robust than an equally
well-understood results from X-ray spectroscopy.
A wide range of timescales of variability can be seen from X-ray binaries. A major part of
the reason for this is that the range of radii which can play a relevant role in an X-ray binary is
larger than in most other classes of systems. Indeed, the radius of a neutron star is about 10 km,
and the Schwarzschild radius of a 10 M⊙black hole is about 30 km. The light crossing times
at these radii represent the shortest timescales on which one would expect to see variability
from an X-ray binary. At the same time, the radius of the accretion disk can often be as large as
cm, a factor of about larger than the smallest spatial scale. The viscous timescale – the
timescale on which matter will flow from the outer disk to the black hole’s event horizon or the
neutron star’s surface – at this radius can be weeks.
The power spectrum (the squared magnitude of the Fourier spectrum) represents the major
tool used in rapid variability studies of X-ray binaries. The power spectra of accretion disks
are rather unlike the power spectra of most other astronomical objects and, hence, bear some
specific discussion. In most areas of astronomy, time series are searched for periodicities – for
example, those of stellar pulsations and of orbits. Searches for periodicities are important in
undestanding accretion flows, as well, but the power spectra made in the X-rays and in the few
cases studied to date of the optical and infared, time series of X-ray binaries often show broader
features. These features can usually be well-fitted by Lorentzian components. If the Q value of
the Lorentzian is very small, the feature is generally referred to as a “noise component.” Noise
components are also often well fitted with power laws. Higher QLorentzians are usually referred
to as “quasi-periodic” oscillations. Coherent oscillations have also been found and in all cases
to date, these oscillations have been associated with the rotational frequency of an accreting
neutron star or the orbital period of the binary system. For longer time-scale variability (i.e.,
the variability on timescales much longer than seconds), there has generally not been good
sampling of most sources, and less rigorous analysis techniques are generally used.
Time lags are another tool used to try to understand X-ray variability in X-ray binaries. One
can make light curves in different X-ray energies and then look either with a cross-correlation
function or a cross-spectrum for time lags between the different bands. These can, for example,
be used to constrain the size of a region in which Compton scattering is taking place as the
Compton scatterings will increase the path lengths which must be followed by higher-energy

626 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
photons relative tothe path lengths followed bythe lower-energy“seed” photons. In fact, models
which explain the time lags solely through light travel times often fail to reproduce the observed
light curves of X-ray binaries in detail (see, e.g., Maccarone et al. 2000), so these lags represent
only upper limits on the size of the emission regions in most cases.
5.6 Disks: Formation and Stability
Accretion frequently occurs in accretion disks. However, the fact that accretion takes place in a
system does not immediately imply that an accretion disk will form. In some cases, the accretion
stream will impact the accretor directly or will be channeled by the accretor’s magnetic field
before a disk forms. Disks form only when the angular momentum of the accreted material is
larger than that of a circular orbit either at the radius of either the innermost stable circular orbit
around a relativistic object or the radius around a less relativistic object. The radius for which
the angular momentum of the accreted gas equals the angular momentum of a Keplerian orbit
is called the circularization radius. This will typically be quite similar to the outer radius of the
disk, but in some cases, the angular momentum transported outward by the accretion process
will lead to a somewhat larger outer disk radius. In some cases, there will also be large magnetic
fields with which to contend; the high magnetic field neutron star accretors are mostly fed by
the fast winds of massive stars, and often the magnetic pressure of the neutron star is larger
than the ram pressure of the gas at the circularization radius so that a disk does not form, and
instead, what material is accreted by the neutron star is chanelled along its magnetic field lines
to the magnetic poles. See again, Frank et al. (1995) and references within for more details of
disk formation.
Accretion disks around all sorts of compact objects – white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black
holes – are subject to instabilities. The most prominent of these instabilities is the ionization
instability. Many aspects of disk stability were first studied in cataclysmic variable stars (e.g.,
Smak 1984). Much can be learned from such studies, but there are some fundamental differ-
ences between the properties of CVs and of X-ray binaries. In particular, the irradiation of the
outer accretion disk by the inner accretion disk is far more important in X-ray binaries, where
the overall efficiency of accretion is orders of magnitude larger (e.g., Dubus et al. 1999). The
essence of the irradiation instability model is that the effective viscosity of gas is larger when
the gas is highly ionized than it is when gas is largely neutral. Other sorts of disk instabilities may
be relevant as well. Several X-ray binaries show precession, also thought to be due to radiation
driven warping of the accretion disk.
Most of the known X-ray binaries are X-ray transients, in the sense that they have been seen
to vary in X-ray luminosity by several orders of magnitude over the history of X-ray astronomy.
They belong, broadly speaking, to two classes, known as soft X-ray transients (in which the
accretors are either black holes or low magnetic field neutron stars, and the spectra near the
peak ofthe outbursts are hence usuallydominated byemission at about 1–3 keV)and hard X-ray
transients (in which the accretors are high magnetic field neutron stars, and the spectra typically
peak at about 15 keV). It is also likely that among the low-mass X-ray binary systems thought to
be persistent, there are probably some sources in transient systems with long outbursts, rather
than being bona fide persistent systems, given that some systems like GRS 1915+105 have been
known to be bright and apparently persistent for about half the history of X-ray astronomy.
Hard X-ray transient behavior is seen only from neutron stars in Be X-ray binaries. In these
systems, the accretion onto the neutron star is fed by the decretion disk of the Be star. The orbits

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
627
of the neutron stars are usually highly eccentric and do not appear to be coplanar with the decre-
tion disk (see the section on neutron star natal kicks below for a discussion of why), and strong
X-ray emission is observed primarily during passages through the plane of the excretion disk.
The outbursts thus typically occur periodically, although additional outbursting is sometimes
seen which is generally attributed to variations in the excretion disk itself.
Soft X-ray transient behavior is seen from a subset of low-mass X-ray binaries, in which the
ionization instabilityacts. Because the radii ofblack hole accretion disks will be largerthan those
of neutron star accretion disks at the same orbital period, and because the ionization instability
depends on the temperature of the outer accretion disk, it is expected that a larger fraction of
black hole X-ray binaries should be transients than neutron star X-ray binaries. It should also
be noted that the lowest-mass black holes would be most likely to end up as persistent sources.
Testing this idea is difficult due to selection effects. Neutron star X-ray binaries can clearly
by identified in many cases when Type I X-ray bursts (large increases in luminosity for about
100 s, which are thought to be due to thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a neutron star)
are seen. Black hole X-ray binaries have no such clear signature in the X-rays. Measurementof a
mass is difficult when a source is in outburst since doing so requires spectroscopic observations
of the companion star, which is typically swamped by the optical emission from the outer disk
during outbursts. Despite these selection effects, there is still reasonably good evidence that all
or nearly all of the persistent low mass X-ray binaries have neutron star primaries – most have
shown Type I X-ray bursts or some other variability phenomena (e.g., kilohertz quasi-periodic
oscillations, discussed below) seen in bursters, but not seen from any dynamically confirmed
black hole candidate. There exists one persistent system, 4U 1957+11, which has never shown
Type-I X-ray bursts, and has never shown kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations. It is considered
a strong candidate for being a black hole X-ray binary, but is far from confirmed as such.
The behavior of X-ray transients in outburst is complex. A relatively large fraction of the
transients follow a “fast rise, exponential decay” profile in time, but a significant fraction show
quite different behavior (Chen et al. 1997). A few qualitative statements can be made about the
properties of the outbursts as a function of orbital period. Longer period systems have, as a class,
higher peak luminosities and longer outbursts than shorter period systems. These can both be
explained as a consequence of their having physically larger accretion disks, which have stored
up a larger mass reservoir at the time they reach a critical ionization levelto start a new outburst.
More recently, using monitoring campaigns made by the pointed instruments on Chandra
and XMM, it has been shown that there exists a population of transient X-ray sources whose
outburst are quite faint (e.g., Wijnands et al. 2006). The campaigns which have found these
objects have been focused either on the Galactic Center region or on globular clusters – regions
expected to contain relatively large numbers of mass-transferring binary systems within a field
of view of a pointed X-ray instrument. In globular clusters, the evolutionary processes by which
X-ray binaries form are very different than elsewhere in the Galaxy, while the Galactic Center
region sources are difficult to followup in other wavelengths. There thus remains considerable
uncertainty about the properties of X-ray transients which peak at fluxes below the sensitivity
of current and past all-sky monitors.

High Magnetic Field Neutron Star Accretors
One class of X-ray binaries contains neutron stars whose magnetic fields are sufficiently large
as to channel the accretion flows down the magnetic poles. This class consists predominantly

628 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
but not entirely of systems with high-mass donor stars. It is generally believed that the accre-
tion process can bury the magnetic field of the neutron star and, perhaps, that it can cause the
neutron star’s magnetic field to decay (e.g., Cumming et al. 2001). As a result, high-mass X-ray
binaries, over whose lifetimes relatively little total accretion occurs, should have predominantly
high magneticfield neutron starcompanions, while onlythe fraction oflow-mass X-raybinaries
in which accretion has started recently should have very high magnetic fields.
While the primary distinguishing characteristic of high magnetic field neutron stars is the
presence of pulsations, there are properties of the X-ray spectra of this class of objects which
also clearly distinguish these objects from low magnetic field neutron star accretors or from
black hole accretors. The typical X-ray spectral shape of a high magnetic field neutron star is
reasonably well modelled by a broken power law with a very flat spectrum below about 15 keV
and a very steep spectrum above about 15 keV.
Additionally, the high magnetic field systems often show cyclotron resonance lines in their
spectra. These lines are seen at:
E = .
B
G(+ zg)−keV,
(12.4)
where E is the energy of the cyclotron line, B is the neutron star’s magnetic field, and zg is the
gravitational redshift of the neutron star. As a result, these lines are useful for making estimates
of neutron star magnetic fields. The lines tend to be broad because they are usually formed
over a finite sized region near the surface of the neutron star, rather than at the surface of the
neutron star. See Wilms et al. (2009) for a detailed review of the detections of cyclotron lines
from neutron stars.
6.1 Low Magnetic Field Neutron Star Accretors
Most neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries have low magnetic fields. There is no defini-
tive evidence for the magnetic field being dynamically important in these systems, but there
are suggestions that some of the quasi-periodic oscillations seen in neutron star X-ray binaries
may require magnetic effects from the star itself. There is nearly a one-to-one correspondence
between a neutron star in X-ray binary having a low magnetic field and its being in a low-mass
X-ray binary; only a handful of low-mass X-ray binaries contain X-ray pulsars.
An intermediate class of neutron star accretors is the class of millisecond X-ray pulsars (see
Wijnands 2004 for a review). These systems show pulsations with periods in a range similar
to that seen from millisecond radio pulsars (i.e., a few hundred Hz) but otherwise show X-ray
properties that are similar to those see in low-luminosity, low magnetic field neutron stars.
The known millisecond X-ray pulsars are all short period systems, with very low-mass donor
stars. They all have low mean accretion rates. A few recent observations have found intermit-
tent coherent pulsations from neutron star X-ray binaries, clouding the distinction between
millisecond X-ray pulsars and other classes of low magnetic field neutron stars (e.g., Casella
et al. 2008).
The low magnetic field neutron stars exhibit a phenomenon known as Type-I X-ray bursts,
first discovered by Grindlay et al. (1976). These bursts are increases in X-ray luminosity typically
lasting a few seconds. They are often, but not always Eddington limited. Their X-ray spectra are
typically well fitted by modified blackbody models. These bursts are thought to be caused by
runaway thermonuclear burning in a layer on the surface of the neutron star (e.g., Woosley and

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
629
Taam 1976; Swank et al. 1977). During the bursts, sometimes coherent oscillations can be seen
in the X-ray flux (e.g., Strohmayer et al. 1996). A subclass of thermonuclear bursts, called super-
bursts, has also been seen. These bursts typically last 3–5 h. They are most frequently associated
with runaway carbon burning, but alternatively, it has been suggested that they may be associ-
ated with electron capture by protons in the neutron star’s atmosphere. At present, superbursts
have been seen only from sources with accretion rates from 10–30% of the Eddington rate. See
Kuulkers (2004) for a review of the superbursts.
6.2 Black Holes in X-Ray Binaries
Relatively early in the history of X-ray astronomy, some good candidates were found for con-
taining black holes. Traditionally, the level of proof required for astronomers to call an object
a black hole is to demonstrate that it produces no fusion-based optical light (i.e., that all its
optical light can be well explained as coming from some combination of the accretion disk and
the companion star) and to demonstrate that its mass is significantly larger than the maximum
mass for a neutron star under any reasonable equation of state. In other cases, a much higher
burden of proof is invoked, and it is required that an event horizon be shown to exist. This
requirement is nearly impossible to satisfy through electromagnetic observations as an object
with a sufficiently large gravitational redshift will be indistinguishable from a bona fide black
hole (Abramowicz et al. 2002).
6.3 Spectral States
Accreting black holes and accreting low magnetic field neutron stars both exhibit what is known
as spectral state phenomenology. Across a wide range of objects, certain patterns in behavior of
the spectral energy distribution and the power spectral densities of sources are found to be well
correlated with one another. Historically, different nomenclature has been used to describe the
spectral states of black holes and the spectral states of neutron stars, but the basic phenomenol-
ogy of the spectral state behavior seems to be nearly independent of the nature of the compact
object.
The state in which an X-ray binary will find itself is mostly a function of the mass accre-
tion rate but also must depend on other parameters. It is customary to discuss luminosities of
X-ray sources in terms of the fraction of the Eddington luminosity at which they are emitting.
The Eddington luminosity is defined as the luminosity at which the gravitational force inward
on a spherically symmetric, fully ionized accretion flow is equal to the radiation pressure out-
ward. The value of the Eddington luminosity is πGMmpc/σt, where G is the gravitational
constant, M is the massof the accretor, mp is the proton mass, c is the speed of light, and σt is the
Thompson cross section. Numerically, the Eddington luminosity is .× (M/M⊙) ergs/s.
The Eddington limit maybe violated if, forexample, an accretion flow is not sphericallysymmet-
ric or if the emission is coming from a region that is moving relativistically toward the observer
so that doppler boosting is important.
The current state of understanding of how X-ray binaries behave is best at intermediate
fractions of the Eddington luminosity. In particular, at a few percent of the Eddington lumi-
nosity, X-ray binaries are frequently found in what is known as a high/soft state. In this state,

630 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
the accretion flow is well described by classical models of geometrically thin, optically thick
accretion disks. The high soft state generally has a weak but existent power-law tail to the spec-
trum. In the soft states, typical root mean squared variability amplitudes, with only the two
persistent sources, Cygnus X-1 and LMC X-1, showing stronger variability (e.g., Nowak et al.
2001) – these two sources also show the most luminous power laws in the soft state. It has
alternatively been proposed to call the soft state the “thermal dominant state” (McClintock and
Remillard 2006) and also to refer to the cases with the very weakest power-law tails as “ultrasoft
states” (Done et al. 2007). In >Fig. 12-2, we show examples of the spectra of an X-ray transient
in the canonical spectral states.
At lower luminosities, X-ray binaries are typically found in what is known in the low/hard
state. A well-developed phenomenological picture exists describing the behavior of systems in
this state, although the nature of the emission geometry remains a topic of ongoing research.
For black holes in the low hard state, the X-ray spectrum is typically well modelled by a cutoff

state, it is clear that nearly all the emission is coming from a quasi-thermal component. In the very
high state, both a quasi thermal component (below about 7 keV), and a power law component (at
the higher energies) can be seen in the spectrum

power law, plus a contribution from a reflection component, with a contribution from a disk
at somewhat lower energies than where it is seen in the high/soft state. The root-mean squared
amplitude of variability in the hard state is typically about 30%.
A different phenomenology is seen both during state transitions and during some extended
episodes of very high luminosity. In these spectral states, sources are seen to have strong
emission from both a quasi-thermal component and a power-law component, typically with
a spectral index of about 2.5. Strong variability is seen and, frequently, strong quasi-periodic
oscillations are seen. Again, varying terminology is used to describe this state. Traditionally, the
term very high state has been used to describe these states at high luminosities, and intermediate
state to describe them at lower luminosities (Nowak 1995), while the more recent review article
of McClintock and Remillard (2006) proposes calling such states “steep power law” states.
We note that there are different sets of terminology sometimes used to describe the spectral
states of neutron stars in the literature. In particular, the neutron stars in low/hard type states
are often called “island state” systems and, in high/soft states, are often called “banana” state sys-
tems. In their very high states, they are often called “Z-sources.” This terminology comes from
color-colorplots of neutron starX-raybinaries made with the EXOSAT observatory. The bright-
est systems traced out a Z-shapedtrack in the color-color space, while the fainter systems traced
out a track that looked like an atoll, with an island-shaped region and a banana-shaped region.
At the time, all known non-pulsing neutron star X-ray binaries fell into one of the two cate-
gories, so the sources were broken up into the Z-source and atoll source categories. Since that
time, a transient neutron star X-ray binary went through both the atoll states and the Z-source
states and returned to quiescence, indicating that the atoll and Z classification is primarily a
luminosity classification (Homan et al. 2007).
6.4 Jets and Spectral States
The properties of relativistic jets in X-ray binaries are well correlated with the X-ray properties
of the systems. For the most part, the strength of jet emission is correlated with the strength
of hard X-ray emission. Additionally, the properties of the jets are different for systems with
neutron star accretors than they are for systems with black hole accretors.
In hard-state black hole X-ray binaries, the radio emission from X-ray binaries has a flat
spectrum due to synchrotron self-absorption, which typically breaks in the range between the
near-infared and near-ultraviolet. It is usually difficult to measure the spectral index of the jet
in the non-absorbed part of the spectrum because there is usually only a very narrow range of
wavelengths where the jet is both optically thin and significantly brighter than the accretion
disk. Most of the black hole X-ray binaries fit on a relation where LR ∝L.
X (Gallo et al. 2003).
A few recently discovered sources seem to have radio fluxes significantly below the predictions
of this relation, and there are hints at possible parallel tracks in this relation, with similar power-
law indices, but different normalization (see, e.g., Fender et al. 2010, whose compilation of data
points has been plotted in >Fig. 12-3).
Less information is available about neutron star X-ray binaries in low/hard states. The
number of radio detections of low/hard state neutron star X-ray binaries is much smaller than
the corresponding number of black hole detections. No radio spectra have been measured for
these sources which are of sufficient quality to distinguish between a spectral index of 0.0 and
one of −.(the two extremes typically seen from black hole X-ray binaries), but the detection

can be seen from the data, as well as some considerable scatter. The
turndown from this relation at high X-ray luminosities is mostly from data points on Cygnus X-1
as it approaches the high/soft spectral state. This ﬁgure uses the same data as that of Fender et al.
(2010)
of jet emission in the mid-infrared from the neuton star 4U 0614+091 requires that the spec-
tral index be relatively close to a flat spectrum, given that it has never been seen to be an
extremely bright radio source (Migliari et al. 2006). Therefore, it seems likely that the anal-
ogy between neutron stars and black holes holds for the spectral shapes of the neutron star jets
at low luminosities.
The relationship between X-ray and radio luminosities of neutron star X-ray binaries that
best fits the existing data is steeper than the relationship for black hole X-ray binaries – for
the neutron star systems, LR ∝L.
X (Migliari and Fender 2006). A consequence of this, plus
the generally lower X-ray luminosities of neutron star X-ray binaries is that the neutron star
systems are much fainter in the radio and, hence, much harder to detect than are the black hole
X-ray binaries. The most likely cause of this different relationship is that the black hole systems
advect energy across their event horizons, while the neutron stars have large, optically thin,
geometrically thick boundary layers. As a result, in the neutron star X-ray binaries, LX ∝˙m,
while in the black hole X-ray binaries, LX ∝˙m. If the jet production and radiative efficiency
of the jet then scale with ˙m, the observed correlations can be produced (Körding et al. 2006).
Jets are often seen in very high states and in state transitions. In these states, the jets are
often seen to be very bright, to have optically thin radio spectra, and to have measurable proper
motions. A rapid growth in studies of radio properties of X-ray binaries begin in the 1990s
when the first “microquasars” were seen – that is, X-ray binaries with apparently superluminal

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
633
jet proper motions (e.g., Mirabel and Rodriguez 1994). The neutron star systems have also
shown similar jets. Circinus X-1, which is a peculiar system likely to have a highly eccentric
orbit, in particular, has shown evidence for outflows at close to the speed of light (with apparent
superluminal motions) during its periastron passages (Fender et al. 2004).
There are many radio observations made during high/soft states, as well, both for neutron
stars and for black holes. Most of these observations are non-detections. In a few cases, black
holes have been observed to show radio emission in high/soft states, but these have all been
cases where it was possible (and, indeed, likely) that the radio emitting plasma was ejected from
the accretion flow during a previous state transition, and its emission was still decaying at the
time of the high/soft state observation. The upper limits on other radio emission from high/soft
state black holes are as stringent as 50 times the expected flux from extrapolating the hard state
radio/X-ray correlation (e.g., Corbel et al. 2004).
There are detections of radio emission from at least two soft-state neutron star X-ray bina-
ries, 4U 1820-30 and Ser X-1 (Migliari et al. 2004). In these systems, the radio flux is the same
in the high soft state as it was in the peak of the low hard state. Thus, there is still reduced radio
emission from what was expected from the extrapolation of the hard-state correlation, but not
reduced so much as to make the source undetectable in the radio. A possible explanation is that
the radio emission from neutron star X-ray binaries is related to the boundary layer (Maccarone
2008). A boundary layer provides large-scale height differentially rotating plasma. On the other
hand, an example of a neutron star with a stringent upper limits on its soft state radio flux also
exists (Tudose et al. 2009), so the presence of radio emission in the high soft states of neutron
stars is not a universal difference between neutron stars and black holes.
The high-mass X-ray binaries with accretion powered pulsars have not been detected as
radio sources. Because of the truncation of their disks at large radii by the magnetic fields
of the neutron stars, it is presumed that these systems are poor locations for jet launching.
On the other hand, the searches of these systems for radio emission are, to date, quite shal-
low. One class of binaries which are likely to consist of neutron stars and high-mass stars has
shown strong radio emission. These are “gamma-ray binaries,” LS 5039, LS I +61 303, and PSR
B1259-63. It is generally thought that these systems are composed of a rotation-powered pul-
sar whose pulsar wind interacts with the stellar wind of the high mass star (e.g., Dubus 2006;
Dhawan et al. 2006), although models do exist for explaining the emission from this source
through interactions between a black hole–powered jet and a stellar wind (Massi and Kaufman
Bernado 2009).
6.4.1 Outbursts and Spectral State Transitions
Most known outbursts of transient low-mass X-ray binaries exhibit multiple spectral states.
Outbursting sources typically rise in luminosity in the hard state, and somewhere rather close
to their maximum fluxes make a transition to the soft state. They then fade within the soft state
and make a transition back to the hard state at a lower luminosity than where they transited
from the hard state to the soft. This hysteresis effect in spectral state transitions occurs in both
neutron star and black hole systems (Maccarone and Coppi 2003). Typically, the transition from
the hard state into the soft state takes place near the peak of the outburst, while the transition
from the soft state to the hard state takes place at about 2% of the Eddington limit (Maccarone
2003). A subset of low-mass X-ray binary transient events seems to take place in which the

634 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
source never enters a soft state. These are all outbursts whose peak luminosities are low and are
predominantly from short period systems (Brocksopp et al. 2004).
6.5 Mass Estimates
It is obviously of great importance to have a good understanding of the masses of compact
objects in close binaries. Breaking up classes of compact binaries into neutron stars and black
holes requires accurate mass estimates so that one can determine which objects have masses
larger than the maximum mass for a neutron star, under even the inclusive equations of state.
The first step in determining a compact object’s mass is to measure its mass function:
f (M, M) = (Msin i)
(M+ M)= π
G
(a sin i)
P
b
,
(12.5)
where Mand Mare the masses of the two stars in the system, Pb is the binary orbital period,
G is the gravitational constant, i is the inclination angle of the binary, with i = ○for an edge
on binary, and a is the semimajor axis of the binary. The mass function then sets a lower limit
on m.
The mass function thus represents a robust lower limit on the mass of an object. For making
strong claims that an object is heavier than the maximum mass of a neutron star, the mass
function can often be sufficient. Care must be taken to determine where the observed spectral
lines are generated, and to ensure that the velocities measured are representative of the velocity
of the centerof massof the donor star. Ordinarily, this does not representa terribly serious issue,
but in the case of radial velocity curves measured from emission lines generated in the stellar
wind of a high mass donor star, it can be very serious; the X-rays from the X-ray binary may
be capable of ionizing the stellar wind in the inner regions of the binary system but not in the
regions shielded from the X-rays by the donor star. This can result in a significant overestimate
of the radial velocity of the donor star if one does not correct for it. This issue has been discussed
in detail for the case of the Galactic wind-fed system Cygnus X-3 (van Kerkwijk 1993), but the
basic arguments apply more generally.
For making a reliable census of masses of black holes or of neutron stars, the inclination
angle must be estimated in some manner.Eclipses can provide excellent constraints on the incli-
nation angles of systems, and the use of pulsar timing, in the systems where the accretor is a
high magnetic field neutron star, can also provide additional constraints on the orbital param-
eters of the system. For this reason, there exist many HMXB neutron star systems with mass
measurements accurate to about 10%, whereas only one black hole, which is in an eclipsing
binary, has a mass measurement so precise (Orosz et al. 2007).
In many ways, though, accurate measurements of black hole masses and of the masses
of neutron stars in LMXBs are more interesting than accurate mass estimates of the neutron
stars in high-mass X-ray binaries. The neutron stars in high-mass X-ray binaries are gener-
ally unlikely to accrete much material before the donor star’s lifetime ends. If normal stellar
evolution leads to the production of neutron stars within a narrow range of masses (i.e., typi-
cally just larger than the Chandrasekhar mass), only in low-mass X-ray binaries are the most
massive neutron stars likely to be formed. There is even more uncertainty about the masses of
black holes. Theoretical work on black hole formation predicts a range of masses (e.g., Fryer
and Kalogera 2001).

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
635
The inclination angles in low-mass X-ray binary systems are generally estimated using ellip-
soidal modulations of the donor stars – the variations in the flux of the donor star as seen from
Earth due to the nonspherical shape of the donor star. The sizes of the ellipsoidal modulations
seen can then be compared with models based on a Roche geometry of the donor star and con-
verted into an inclination angle. Measurements of the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations
can generally be made quite precisely. A major source of uncertainty can often be the ratio of
the flux of the accretion disk and jet in the optical or infrared band used to estimate the size of
the modulations. While the measurements are generally made while the black hole or neutron
star is “quiescent,” the bolometric luminosity of the accretion flow can often still be a substantial
fraction of the luminosity of the donor star.
Eccentric radio pulsar binaries can be used to make mass estimates purely through pulse
timing behavior. These systems are typically found only in globular clusters, where stellar
encounters can induce eccentricities in binaries fasterthan the binaries will re-circularize them-
selves. One needs to measure both the relativistic effect of the advance of the periastron, plus
the Keplerian motions in order to measure the masses of both objects in a binary system purely
from pulsar timing. The details and results of this technique can be found in the review article
of Lorimer (2008).
6.6 Constraints on the Neutron Star Equation of State
Understanding the equation of state of nuclear matter is one of the key goals of neutron star
research. There are several means to do this. The simplest is simply to find the most massive
neutron stars. The softest equations of state can be ruled out by finding sufficiently massive
neutron stars, as in the softest equations of state, the threshold mass at which an object must
become a black hole, rather than a neutron star, is lowest. The lack of clear evidence for neutron
stars more massive than about 1.8 M⊙favors soft equations of state, but as noted above, the
low-mass X-ray binaries’ neutron stars are most likely to be the heaviest neutron stars, and the
few mass estimates for those objects are generally poorly constrained.
For limiting the range of possible harder equations of state, however, it becomes necessary to
limit the available parameter space in the mass-radius relation. This can be done by measuring
the gravitational redshift at the surface of the neutron star. At the present time, there exist some
controversial measurements of the gravitational redshift of a single neutron star from absorp-
tion lines in the X-ray spectrum of a Type I burst (Cottam et al. 2002; Galloway et al. 2009).
It can also be done by detailed spectral modelling of the surface emission from Type I X-ray
bursts (Özel et al. 2009).
Neutron star X-ray binaries often show “kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations” – quasi-
periodic oscillations at frequencies of about 600–1200 Hz. Combined mass-radius constraints
may also be possible if a clear model for kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations can be found, and
the results could be particularly effective for determining the actual masses and radii of spe-
cific neutron stars. While considerable debate still exists about what is the correct model for
the QPOs (or indeed, whether any currently proposed model is correct), in the long term, the
quasi-periodic oscillations are quite likely to provide the strongest constraints on the neutron
star equation of state, since the measurements of the QPO frequencies are highly precise (typ-
ically accurate to about 1%), and far less susceptible to calibration uncertainties or radiative
transfer effects than are spectral signatures.

Black Holes and Neutron Stars
6.7 Distance Estimates
A variety of techniques are used for measuring distances to black holes and neutron stars in
the Galaxy. The most robust of these, the geometric parallax, has been applied for about 20
neutron star sources [one X-ray binaries – Sco X-1 (Bradshaw et al. 1999), about a dozen pul-
sars (Chatterjee et al. 2009), and one isolated non-pulsing neutron star (Kaplan et al. 2002)].
One black hole’s parallax distance has recently been measured as well (Miller-Jones et al. 2009).
Apart from parallax distances, there are also cases of firm associations with star clusters and
supernova remnants which can be used to make reliable distance estimates. The comparisons
between parallax distance estimates and other distance measurement techniques are important
for understanding the errors in the other techniques.
Nearly all parallax distance measurements of neutron stars to date have made use of very
long baseline radio interferometry, with a much smaller number measured in the optical
with the Hubble Space Telescope (Chatterjee et al. 2009). Present instrumentation at other
wavelengths lacks the angular resolution needed to make parallax measurements. The ease of
measuring the parallaxes ofradiopulsars can be improved by“pulsargating” – taking the known
timing solution of the pulsar and making an image only when the pulsar is bright, resulting in
a significant reduction of noise with relatively little loss of signal. The limits to radio parallaxes
are typically severe at distances of a few kpc, although one parallax measurementhas been made
of a pulsar at 7.2 kpc. At larger distances, the uncertainties with which one can do phase refer-
encing in radio astronomy – the measurement of positions based on the phase differences seen
from different sources – is limited by ionospheric effects. More accurate radio astrometry will
be possible with an upgraded bandwidth Very Long Baseline Array because it will allow the use
of phase calibrators which are fainter and, hence, closer to the source of interest. Timing paral-
lax measurements can be made for some of the pulsars which act as the most accurate clocks –
residuals in the timing solution which correlate with time of year can be used to estimate the
position
Where parallax measurements have not been made, the distance measurements techniques
generally differ quite strongly between radio pulsars and X-ray binaries. When the distance to
a radio pulsar cannot be measured either through a parallax or by an association with a star
cluster or other object whose distance is known, dispersion measure distances are often used.
The dispersion measure of a pulsar is the number of free electrons between the pulsar and the
observer. Dispersion of radio waves as they pass through ionized gas leads to a time delaywhich
is function of photon frequency. By comparing the pulsar’s pulse arrival times at different radio
frequencies, one can thus measure the column density of free electrons to the pulsar. There
exist models of the free electron distribution in the Galaxy which can be used to estimate the
distances of these pulsars (e.g., Cordes and Lazio 2003). Distances estimated from dispersion
measures are usually accurate to within a factor of about two within the Galactic Plane and fail
quite badly for most globular cluster pulsars.
The distances to neutron star X-ray binaries can often be estimated from Type I X-ray bursts.
When these bursts show radius expansions over the course of the burst duration, this generally
gives a good indication that the burst is Eddington limited. The Eddington limited bursts have
often been suggested to be good standard candles, and repeated observations of a large number
of Type I bursts in globular clusters have helped to verify this (Kuulkers et al. 2003).
However, not all neutron star X-ray binaries have shown radius expansion bursts, and, of
course, no black hole X-ray binaries show Type I bursts. For these objects, usually the best
distance estimates come from using the donor star, using the photometric parallax technique.

A crude estimate of the distance to a donor star can be made by measuring the flux of the donor
star and comparing it with the luminosity of a star of its spectral type. However, the evolution-
ary paths followed by the donor stars in low-mass X-ray binaries are often nonstandard, and the
stars themselves are always nonspherical and rapidly rotating. More reliable distance estimates
come from making an estimateof the radius of the donor star directly from the data, rather than
under the assumption that the donor star has the mass and radius typical for its spectral type.
The estimation of the stellar radius is most reliably done by measuring the rotational broaden-
ing of the lines in the donor star’s spectrum, combined with the fact that the star must rotate
synchronously with the binary orbit. Absent a reliable estimation of the star’s rotational velocity,
the relation between the orbital period and the density of the donor star can be used to estimate
the donor star’s radius – this technique requires an estimate of the donor star’s mass, but this
can come from the mass ratio between the donor star and the accretor if a rotation curve for
the accretion disk can be measured from disk emission lines. The status of distance estimation
techniques for X-ray binaries is well discussed in Jonker and Nelemans (2004) and references
within.
A few other techniques are sometimes used, but typically place only bounds on the dis-
tances to low mass X-ray binaries, rather than giving actual distance estimates. One is the use
of two-sided jet proper motions. This technique gives a robust upper limit on the distance to an
object based on requiring no motions faster than the speed of light. It has also been shown that
sources will typically be at distances very close to the upper limits derived from this technique
(Fender 2003).
The other prominently used technique is to look for evidence of absorption, either in the
form of interstellar lines such as the Na D line in an optical spectrum or HI absorption in a
radio spectrum. One can then use the rotation curve of the Galaxy to estimate the distances of
the absorbing material to place a lower limit on the distance to the X-ray source, and somewhat
more speculatively, can use the absence of absorption from more distant gas to place an upper
limit on the distance (e.g., Hynes et al. 2004). The state transition flux from the high/soft state
to the low/hard state can also provide an approximate distance estimator (Maccarone 2003),
with an accuracy similar to that from dispersion measure distance estimates of pulsars. While
these techniques are less reliable, some of them can provide distance estimates for X-ray binaries
with large foreground column densities which make it impossible to make measurementsof the
donor star.
6.8 Key Phenomenological Diﬀerences Between Black Holes
and Neutron Stars
The existence of black holes is one of the key predictions of general relativity. A key goal of
observational astronomy is then to attempt to prove that black holes do, in fact, exist in Nature.
The first step in this process is to find objects heavier than the theoretical maximum mass of a
neutron star under equations of state which are not in conflict with nuclear physics experiments.
Astronomers have, in fact, found about two dozen such objects, heavier than 3 M⊙.
The next step in this process is to demonstrate that the objects heavier than 3M⊙are in some
ways qualitatively different from those lighter objects, which are likely to be neutron stars, and
to demonstrate that the observed differences are related to the existence of a solid surface in
the neutron stars, which is absent in the black holes. Considerable progress has been made in
recent years on this topic.

638 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
The most prominent surface effects of neutron stars are Type I X-ray bursts, pulsations, and
surface emission in quiescence. All are evidence of a surface, but in no case is the absence of
these effects clear evidence of the absence of a surface. Pulsations are generally absent in low
magnetic field neutron stars. There are objects, known to be neutron stars due to observations of
Type I X-ray bursts during their outbursts, but which have shown no surface emission in quies-
cence. This can be explained by enhanced cooling processes, perhaps related to a relatively high
neutron star mass (Jonker et al. 2007). Prior to those observations, there had been a relatively
clear picture that the quiescent luminosities of low-mass X-ray binaries with neutron stars were
systematically higher than those of black holes with the same orbital periods (e.g., Garcia et al.
2001). Type I X-ray bursts are only expected from low magnetic field neutron stars, and only in a
certain range of accretion rates. At low accretion rates, it can take a very long time before enough
material piles up to allow runaway nuclear burning to take place, leading to a sufficiently low
rate of bursts that one cannot expect to detect bursts. At higher accretion rates, steady nuclear
burning is expected to take place. On the other hand, in the intermediate accretion rate range
where frequent bursts are expected, they are always seen (Remillard et al. 2006). Therefore, the
absence of both bursts and pulsations from a well-observed source may be taken as reasonably
good evidence for an event horizon. The above-mentioned point, though, that one cannot rule
out observationally the possibility that a mass configuration could exist in which a star could
have a surface gravitational redshift of ∼, , remains (Abramowicz et al. 2002).
6.9 Evidence for Black Hole Spin
In the past few years, a variety of lines of evidence have all started to indicate that most stellar-
mass black holes have substantial angular momentum. This is perhaps not surprising since
massive stars routinely have angular momenta in excess of the maximum angular momentum
for black holes of the same mass. On the other hand, it is difficult to measure the black hole spin
with high precision because its effects are generally relatively minor and are often degenerate
with other effects.
The observations of relativistic jets have been suggested in some cases to be strong evidence
of black hole spin. This is partly motivated by the work of Blandford and Znajek (1977), who
argued that jets could be powered in part by tapping the spin energy of the black hole. However,
the observations of jets from other classes of objects which have no event horizons, and from
neutron stars, which cannot be rotating quickly in terms of specific angular momentum (their
break-up speeds are at about 0.1 times the speed they would need to be at to have angular
momentum per unit mass similar to maximally rotating black holes).
Several lines of evidence have been proposed in recent years to show that black holes are
spinning. These fall, broadly speaking, into two classes: attempts to make precision measure-
ments of the black hole spins, and attempts to show effects which qualitatively demonstrate that
the black holes must be rotating, at least at some speed. In the formercategoryare iron-line mea-
surements, disk spectral fitting measurements, and specific modelling of certain quasi-periodic
oscillations, while in the latter are other work on quasi-periodic oscillations, and attempts to
demonstrate that frame dragging is taking place in accretion disks.
There are two classes of X-ray spectral evidence for spinning black holes. The first is from
the use of broad iron lines. Iron fluorescence lines can be generated as a hard X-ray producing
component illuminates the cold neutral material in the inner accretion disk. The profile of the
iron line will not be a delta function in energy, but rather will be severely affected by the special

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
639
relativistic effects due to Doppler motions of the material around the black hole in a rotating
accretion disk, as well as by the general relativistic effects of the gravitational redshift due to the
fact that most of the iron line flux will be generated very deep in the gravitational potential well
of the black hole. Because the orbital motions approach rather close to the speed of light in the
inner accretion disk, the Doppler effect not only provide a change in the photon energies, but
also provides a strong boosting of the luminosity of the blue wing of the iron line.
The key advantages of using the iron line to fit black hole spin relative to using disk con-
tinuum fitting are that the spin measurement is independent of the distance to the black hole
and of the mass of the black hole. These advantages remove two of the biggest uncertainties in
nearly all measurements of anything for stellar-mass black holes in the Galaxy, which is why
proper calibration of this technique is so attractive for understanding black holes.
In detail, the fit results are susceptible to a number of uncertainties, only some of which
have been studied in detail in the literature to date. As the iron lines need to be fitted over a very
broad range of energies – typically from about 4–8 keV, the continuum must be known to high
precision over this energy range, and the instrument being used must be well calibrated within
this energy range. The requirements of an accurate continuum model and of an excellent flux
calibration in order to study an emission line are rather different than the usual requirements
for making reliable, detailed measurements of stellar lines in the optical, but are a consequence
of having lines with significant flux over a range of a factor of two in photon energy.
In X-ray binaries in their bright states, the continuum over this range of energies is often
affected by the fact that the disk blackbody component and the Comptonized component meet
near 4 keV, and the high spectral resolution instruments which can be used to estimate the shape
of the iron line usually cut off at about 10 keV, leaving relativelylittle leverarm for measuring the
shape of the power-law component. Additionally, the iron line is accompanied by an iron edge
which is also relativistically smeared. Without good coverage of the spectrum up to energies
well beyond the edge energy, there can be degeneracies between the shape of the line and the
energy of the edge.
There are a few additional free parameters and assumptions in iron-line spin estimates. One
parameter is the inclination angle of the inner accretion disk. Another parameter is the emissiv-
ity profile of the iron line (i.e., the amount of line emission that comes from the disk as a function
of radius). The emissivity profile is usually assumed to be a power law, and its index is fit. The
fitting also requires as parameters the inner and outer radius contributing to this emissivity. The
ionization parameter of the emission region is usually taken to be a constant, although it is not
likely actually to be a constant. Finally, there are assumptions that the disk is planar and tied to
the plane of the black hole spin in the inner region. Furthermore, it is also assumed that there
are no other components of iron emission, and that the orbits in the accretion disks are circular,
rather than elliptical.
Measurements of spins of black holes from continuum spectra have a different set of advan-
tages and disadvantages. From the X-ray continuum, one can attempt to estimate the inner disk
radius. However, this method is strongly susceptible to uncertainties in the black hole mass,
the black hole distance, and the inclination angle of the inner accretion disk and relies on the
assumption that the accretion disk extends in to the innermost stable circular orbit around
the black hole. Continuum fitting is susceptible to the same problems with uncertainties in the
instrument response matrix that affect iron-line fitting. It is very susceptible to errors in esti-
mating the effects of Compton upscattering of disk photons and, to date, has been attempted
only with sources in the ultrasoft state. On the other hand, it can be done with sources which
are much fainter than those for which iron-line measurements can be made.

640 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
At the present time, the spin estimates from reflection features span the full range of pro-
grade black hole spins possible (Miller et al. 2009). The disk continuum fits also span a large
range in a, from about 0.1–0.8 (Shafee et al. 2006; Davis et al. 2006). Unfortunately, at the
present time, for the two sources for which both methods have been tried, GRO J1655-40
and 4U 1543-47, only marginal agreement is seen between the two methods, with the iron-line
method giving larger spin values.
Using quasi-periodic oscillations to measure black hole spins ultimately has the greatest
potential for being used to give reliable and precise spin measurements. Narrow features in
power spectra are far easier to calibrate properly than spectral measurements and are not subject
to any reprocessing effects (except in that the timing signature can be weakened by photon
scattering).
There are two classes of QPO that have been used as evidence for black hole spin. The first
is the presence of oscillations at about 1–10 Hz, seen in many black hole X-ray binaries. These
have been suggested to be evidence of a Lense–Thirring precession, an effect due to relativistic
frame-dragging of tilted accretion disk (e.g., Fragile et al. 2001). Precision spin measurements
are not possible from the frequency of the L-T oscillation because the relation between the black
hole spin and the QPO frequency will depend rather strongly on details on angular momentum
transport in accretion disks.
The other QPOs, which may have potential for providing precision spin measurements,
are the high-frequency QPOs seen from several black holes in a 2:3 frequency ratio (e.g.,
Strohmayer 2001; Abramowicz and Kluzniak 2001). Several mechanisms exist for explaining
these QPOs – for example, resonances between relativistic coordinate frequencies (Abramowicz
and Kluzniak 2001) and fundamental modes of oscillation of a torus around the black hole
(Rezzolla et al. 2003). All QPO-based methods to date can give precision measurements of the
black hole spin, but all depend on knowing also the mass of the black hole to high accuracy,
and the different models give substantially different spin values. The advantages of using QPOs
to measure spin of black holes are then that the method is distance independent, and that the
measurements are far less susceptible to non-statistical errors than are the spectral measure-
ments. The key disadvantages are that the measured spins are strongly dependent on both what
is the actual correct model and on the black hole mass.
6.10 Isolated Black Holes
Black holes which are not accreting are nearly impossible to detect astrophysically. Searches
have been made for evidence of heavy, dark stars in binary systems with no evidence for accre-
tion taking place and have not yielded any strong candidate black holes. A few stellar-massblack
hole candidates have been found in microlensing searches (Bennett et al. 2002). It has also been
suggested that isolated black holes in very dense regions of the interstellar medium, such as
molecular clouds, might be detectable through accretion signatures, either in high energies or
in radio (e.g., Armitage and Natarajan 1999; Maccarone 2005).
6.11 Neutron Stars not in Accreting Binaries
Neutron stars, with solid surfaces and magnetic fields, can be detected even when not accret-
ing. There are several classes of such neutron stars known. Two of them, the rotation-powered

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
641
pulsars and the magnetars, have well-defined characteristics clearly suggested by their names.
Additionally, there exist a few neutron stars whose emission is dominated by thermal cooling
of the initially hot star. More recently, two new classes of objects have been proposed, which
may, in some cases, be objects which can also fit into the already known classes. The term “iso-
lated neutron stars” is often used to refer to a small subset of the known neutron stars not in
binary systems, and the “central compact objects” which are distinguished by their locations
near the centers of young supernova remnants, rather than any particular physical proper-
ties they possess. A review of the state of the art of all classes of isolated neutron stars can be
found in Kaspi et al. (2006). More detailed discussion of the rotation-powered pulsars can be
found, for example, in Lyne and Graham-Smith 2006 and of binary and millisecond pulsars in
Lorimer (2008).
6.12 Pulsars and Other Rotation-Powered Emitters
While the first neutron star to be observed and identified as an unusual object was the
X-ray binary Sco X-1, the early observations of radio pulsars half a decade later represented
the first truly strong evidence for the existence of neutron stars. The accurate clocks provided
by pulsars have allowed measurements to precision higher than any other class of astronomical
measurement – in a few cases, the masses of pulsars are known to such high precision that the
largest source of error is in the measurement of GM⊙, the product of the gravitational constant
times the solar mass, rather than in any of the measurements specific to the pulsar itself. This
timing precision provides for an inexpensive technique for searching for gravitational radiation
– looking for correlated residuals in the timing behaviorof several pulsars. Pulsars are addition-
ally an important source of radiation across all wavelengths and may themselves be sources of
gravitational radiation.
6.12.1 Pulsar Emission Mechanisms
Understanding where the power for pulsars comes from is relatively straightforward. Assuming
that the rotation axis of a neutron star is misaligned with the magnetic field of the neutron star,
one can calculate the expected power due to dipole radiation. More difficult is to understand
how that magnetic dipole power is converted into the radiation observed from pulsars. The
rotational frequencies of pulsars range from about 0.2–700 Hz. Even at 700 Hz, the direct dipole
emission frequency is well below the plasma frequency of the solar system. Therefore, it cannot
be the dipole power itself which is observed from the Earth.
On the other hand, the dipole spin down is thought to dominate total energy loss from
rotation-powered pulsars. Since the spin-down power is:
˙E = I ˙ΩΩ = πI ˙PP−= ΩRB
sinα
c
,
(12.6)
where Ω is the rotation rate of the neutron star in angular velocity, I is the moment of intertia of
the neutron star, usually assumed to be g cm, P is the spin period of the neutron star, ˙P is
the spindown rate of the neutron star, R is the neutron star radius, Bis its surface magnetic
field, and α is the angle between the neutron star’s magnetic field axis and its rotation axis.
Under these assumptions, plus the additional assumption that α is ○, one can estimate the

642 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
magnetic field of a neutron star as:
B= .× (P ˙P)/G.
(12.7)
Instead, some mechanism must exist for accelerating particles in the pulsar’s magneto-
sphere. It was originally believed that because the gravitational binding energy per particle at
the surface of a neutron star is much larger than the thermal energy per particle, that neutron
stars should not have substantial atmospheres (e.g., Hoyle et al. 1964; Pacini 1967, 1968). How-
ever, it was shown shortly thereafter, by Goldreich and Julian (1969) that a rotating magnetic
field leads to a surface layer with charge separation such that the electric force near the surface
of the neutron star is larger than the gravitational force at the surface, meaning that a neutron
star surrounded by a vacuum would have a surface layer not in dynamical equilibrium.
The minimum number of charged particles in a neutron star atmosphere to satisfy the
Goldreich and Julian criterion is insufficient for producing strong radio emission. Instead, it
is generally believed that some pair production process must be taking place within the neu-
tron star atmosphere. In agreement with this idea is the observation of the “pulsar death line” –
that there exist no pulsars which are sufficiently slowly spinning and sufficiently low in magnetic
field (see, e.g., Chen and Ruderman 1993).
The radio emission from rotation-powered pulsars cannot be incoherent synchrotron radi-
ation. There exists a limit on the brightness temperature which can be produced by incoherent
sychrotron emission. Above this limit, the “Compton catastrophe” sets in – that is, Compton
scattering works to cool electrons more efficiently than does synchrotron emission, and any
additional power added to the system serves only to increase the luminosity of the Comp-
ton scattering component. A possible solution to this problem is that the radio emission
from pulsars is, indeed, synchrotron emission but is coherent emission – electrons move in
“bunches.” Since the radiated power from the synchrotron process scales as the square of the
charge of the radiating particle, this bunching of electrons can lead to significantly higher
ratios of synchrotron to Compton emission than can be obtained from single, incoherent elec-
trons. More recently, plasma maser models, and plasma turbulence models have instead been
more commonly proposed to explain the high brightness temperatures of pulsars (e.g.
Hankins et al. 2003).
Rotation-powered pulsars usually emit most of their bolometric luminosity outside the
radio band. The radio luminosities are typically less than about −of the spin-down lumi-
nosities, while the X-ray luminosities are typically about 0.1% of the spindown luminosities,
although pulsars with more rapid spindown may have higher ratios of X-ray emission to spin-
down luminosity, reaching 80% for some of the pulsars with the highest spin-down luminosities
(Becker and Trümper 1997; Possenti et al. 2002). The Fermi Gamma-ray Large Area Space Tele-
scope has recently succeeded in discovering several of pulsars as γ-ray sources before they were
discovered in radio surveys. A few were quickly discovered as radio pulsars as well (Camilo
et al. 2009).
6.13 Millisecond Pulsars
It is clear from examining >Fig. 12-4 that there are two distinct populations of pulsars. Most of
the pulars follow a track with inferred magnetic field values of about G and with spin rates
of about 1 s. A significant fraction of the pulsars have inferred magnetic fields of about G and
spin periods of about 10 ms. This faster subclass of neutron stars is known as the millisecond

The plot of period derivative versus period for all the pulsars in the Australia Telescope National
Facility’s pulsar database with period derivative measurements (Manchester et al. 2005). The
region in the lower left of the diagram where no pulsars are seen is the “pulsar graveyard”, where it
is believed that the pulsars are rotating too slowly to produce pair cascades. The millisecond pulsar
region includes some globular clusters whose period derivatives may include contributions from
acceleration in the gravitational potentials of the clusters
pulsars, the first of which was discovered in 1982 by Backer et al. and collaborators. They are
sometimes referred to as “recycled” pulsars because they are thought to be recycled from dead
pulsars in low-mass X-ray binaries (Alpar et al. 1982).
The evolutionary scenarios for producing millisecond pulsars usually invoke a normal pro-
cess of creating a pulsar in a binary system, followed by a phase as a “normal” pulsar. At some
point, the neutron star’s companion begins to overflow its Roche lobe, and accretion onto the
neutron star begins. The accretion process serves to provide a torque to the neutron star, which
can increase its spin rate to millisecond periods with only about 0.1 M⊙of material being added
to the neutron star. Recently, a source has been discovered which appears to have spent time as
both an X-ray binary and a radio pulsar within the past decade (Archibald et al. 2009).
Accretion is generally thought to reduce the magnetic fields of neutron stars. Most of the
observational evidence of isolated neutron stars indicates that they have little or no magnetic
field decay. Several theoretical mechanisms exist for explaining why accretion might cause field
decay in neutron stars. One possibility is ohmic decay – the magnetic fields in neutron stars are
driven by electron motions, and electrical resistivity can lead to a loss of these magnetic fields
(see, e.g., Bhattacharya and Datta 1996). The chief alternative possibility is that the magnetic
fields do not decay but are merely buried by accreted matter (e.g., Cumming et al. 2001).

644 12
Black Holes and Neutron Stars
Recently, an additional class of radio sources has been detected through the detection of
individual pulsars of emission, rather than by Fourier transforming the power received by
large radio telescopes. These sources, called rotating radio transients (or RRATs) repeat their
pulsations periodically but with a very low duty cycle for detecting the pulses (McLaughlin et al.
2006). It has been suggested that at least some of the RRATs may be relatively normal radio pul-
sars at large distances but with a larger than typical distribution of pulse heights (Weltevrede
et al. 2006).
6.13.1 Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars and Soft Gamma Repeaters
Two classes of isolated neutron stars show properties which share some broad similarities with
one another but which are rather different from those seen from other classes of neutron stars.
These are the anomalous X-ray pulsars, which are typically detected by showing pulsations in
the X-rays and the soft gamma repeaters, which show bursts of gamma-rays which are not too
different from those seen in cosmic gamma-ray bursts, except with relatively softer spectra,
and with repeated activity coming from single positions on the sky. Both these classes are now
thought to have much or all of their emission powered by the magnetic fields of the neutron
stars, which are thought to be typically greater than G (Thompson and Duncan 1995).
6.13.2 Old Isolated Neutron Stars
The bulk of the neutron stars in the Galaxy rotate slowly enough to be past the pulsar death line
and are not in close binaries. These objects emit thermal radiation from their still-cooling crusts
with their emission typically peaking in the far-ultraviolet through soft X-ray band. Because
they are both extremely faint, and their emission peaks in the bands most susceptible to inter-
stellar absorption, these neutron stars can generally be observed only if they are very nearby.
ROSAT discovered seven such object (see Kaplan 2008 for a review). One particular area of
interest with these systems is fitting the spectra produced in their magnetized atmospheres,
which can be used both to probe both the properties of highly magnetized matter and to make
estimates of the surface gravitational redshifts of these neutron stars (see, e.g., Ho 2007).
7
Populations of Compact Objects
In addition to developing an understanding of how compact objects can produce radiation, it is
important to develop an understanding of how they form, and of how often and why they end
up in binary systems.
7.1 Observations
Relatively good observational constraints exist for populations of X-ray binaries and of pulsars
(although neither is immune from selection effects). Even for these two classes of sources, there
is strong evidence that the Galactic population is not well sampled at large distances, especially

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
645
in the Galactic Plane. For the other classes of compact objects – magnetars, old neutron stars,
and isolated black holes – there exist such small numbers of objects that it is difficult to make
and global statements about the source populations.
Even the observations of pulsars and of X-ray binaries are limited by selection effects, some
of which are not yet well understood. A large majority of the pulsars in the Australia Tele-
scope National Facility’s pulsar database are within about 3 kpc. Some have been detected only
through scintillation amplification of their brightnesses. The lack of detections of more distant
pulsars is likely an effect both of lack of sensitivity of existing radio observatories and the diffi-
culty in finding pulsations of pulsars with large dispersion measures. Most of the known X-ray
binaries are on the near side of the Galactic Center, as well. The lack of more distant X-ray bina-
ries is due to the combined effects of lack of sensitivity to large distance objects, especially in
the all-sky monitors produced to date and the increasing effects of foreground absorption of
soft X-rays in the Galactic Plane.
The interesting point for which there is the strongest observational evidence is that neutron
stars have space velocities considerably higher than those of the massive stars thought to form
them. The proper motions of many pulsars have been measured, and the best-fitting velocity
distributions indicate that many pulsars are likely to have escaped the Galaxy (see, e.g., Hobbs
et al. 2005). The scale height of low-mass X-ray binaries is about 1 kpc, larger than for any
“normal” stellar component. Some black holes show evidence for large space velocities, as well,
and the black holes also show a large-scale height (Jonker and Nelemans 2004).
7.2 Extragalactic X-Ray Binaries, Intermediate Mass Black Holes,
and Other Unusual Objects
In recent years with the launch of the Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories, it has been
possible to make detailed studies of the X-ray point source populations of a large number of
nearby galaxies. Two major motivations exist for this work. One is to understand X-ray source
populations in order to gather new data to test binary stellar evolution models, and, in the case
of globular cluster X-ray sources, new data to test dynamical formation mechanisms for close
binaries. The other motivation is to look for sources whose parameters fall outside the range
seen in the Milky Way.
There are several problems which plague studies of X-ray source populations within the
Galaxy. The most important is the difficulty in measuring source distances in the Galaxy
(see above). Without reliable distance estimates, both the luminosity distributions of sources
and the scale heights of source classes are difficult to determine. Another key problem is that
the Galactic foreground absorption means that samples of X-ray binaries are incomplete in the
Galaxy in ways that are difficult to quantify. A third problem is simply the small size of the
Galactic X-ray binary population. On the other hand, for faint sources, only the Milky Way
galaxy, and, to some extent the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies, can be studied in the X-rays
with current instrumentation.
Globular cluster X-ray sources are, in particular, something which can be studied in a much
different manner in nearby galaxies than in the Milky Way(see >Fig. 12-5 for an X-ray image of
a nearby elliptical galaxy). Only 12 of the Milky Way’s 150 or so globular clusters has been found
to contain a bright (LX > ergs/s) X-ray source, although two of them have now been shown
to contain at least two such sources at various times. One key result of extragalactic globular
clusterX-ray source studies include the discovery that metal rich clusters are several times more
likely to contain X-ray sources than metal poor clusters (Kundu et al. 2002), something which

An X-ray image from theChandra X-ray observatory of thegalaxy NGC4472, theoptically brightest
galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. This image contains about 140 X-ray point sources. About 40% of the
X-ray sources in regions with good optical coverage from the Hubble Space Telescope are associ-
ated with globular clusters. The diﬀuse emission in the center of the galaxy is truly diﬀuse hot gas
emission, rather than a superposition of X-ray point sources
had been suggested in the Milky Way (e.g., Silk and Arons 1975) but could be proven with the
small number of Milky Way cluster sources, and the correlations between metallicity and other
parameters forMilkyWayclusters. Extragalacticclusters have alsoshown the first clearevidence
for a stellar-mass black hole in a globular cluster (Maccarone et al. 2007) and the best evidence
to date for an intermediate mass black hole (i.e., a black hole of more than about 1,000 M⊙) in
a globular cluster (Gebhardt et al. 2005; Ulvestad et al. 2007).
Additionally, searches of nearby galaxies have turned up the class of ultraluminous X-ray
sources. The standard definition of ultraluminous is having measured luminosity greater than
ergs/s, with the measurements of nearby galaxies nearly all being made in the 0.5–10 keV
energy range where imaging instruments are effective. Many of the Galactic black hole X-ray
binaries have, at least briefly, reached this luminosity threshold, but only GRS 1915+105 has
maintained a luminosity at or near this level for an extended period of time. Many of the ultra-
luminous X-ray sources have remained steadily above ergs/s over time scales of years or
longer, and some have steadily emitted at luminosities over ergs/s.
These ultraluminous X-ray sources are of great interest because either they are manifesting
a mode of accretion not observed in the Milky Way or they harbor intermediate mass black
holes as their accretors. A few of the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources show X-ray spectra
which are best fitted with disk components of lower temperature than those seen from high
luminosity black hole X-ray binaries in the Galaxy, and where the normalizations of the disk
spectral components imply a large inner radius for the accretion disk. If one assumes that the
disk black-body model is the physically correct description of the data, rather than merely a
model which is statistically consistent with the data, and that the disk extends in to the inner-
most stable circular orbit around the black hole, then the implied black hole masses of this
subclass of ultraluminous X-ray sources are typically ∼, M⊙– much larger than what can
be produced through normal stellar evolutionary channels, but much smaller than the black
holes seen in galactic nuclei.

Several caveats apply here, and several alternative models exist. First, the X-ray spectra of
the ultraluminous X-ray sources with cool disks look qualitatively different from the X-ray
spectra of stellar-mass black holes in all the sub-Eddington spectral states – they typically have
X-ray spectra with bright cool disks but dominant power-law components (Soria et al. 2007).
There exist mechanisms to explain their high luminosities by relativistic beaming (Körding et al.
2006), or by some combination of geometric beaming and the capability of nonspherical flows
actually to exceed the Eddington limit (e.g., King 2002).
Other evidence, apart from ultraluminous X-ray sources has been suggested for the exis-
tence of intermediate-mass black holes. In globular clusters, one can attempt to measure the
distribution of stellar velocities around the cluster centers. If a sufficiently massive black hole
is present, it should dominate the gravitational potential for a large enough number of stars
that their motions should indicate its presence. To date, there are some suggestive hints for
intermediate-mass black holes from these observations, but the dynamical data taken alone
have always been consistent with alternative explanations, such as anisotropic velocity distri-
butions for the stars in the cluster (see, e.g., Noyola et al. 2008). In one case, the extragalactic
globular cluster G1 in M 31, there exists both dynamical evidence (Gebhardt et al. 2005) and
accretion evidence, in the form ofboth radioand X-rayemission (Trudolyubov and Priedhorsky
2004; Ulvestad et al. 2007), for the existence of an intermediate mass black hole.

Formation of Compact Objects and Compact Object Binaries
The formation of black holes and neutron stars, and the understanding of how these systems end
up in binaries is an important process to understand in astrophysics. The supernova explosions
that produce neutron stars and black holes also contribute substantial fractions of many of the
heavy elements in the Universe. They represent one of the few known classes of events capable
of producing detectable neutrino emission. They may be responsible for a substantial fraction
of the kinetic energy input into the Galaxy and other galaxies.
Additionally, the formation of X-ray binaries represents an opportunity to test theories of
the evolution of close binary stars. Understanding binary evolution is a key certainly to under-
standing how gravitational wave emitting binaries form and how Type Ia supernovae occur. It
may also be important for understanding cosmic γ-ray bursts, and the formation and evolution
of exotic classes of optically emitting stars, such as blue stragglers, extreme horizontal branch
stars, and subdwarf B stars. At the same time, X-ray binaries are one of the very few classes of
individual stars that can be seen out to distances of 20 Mpc, in which is enclosed a wide range
of types of galaxies, so that the effects of stellar population on source class production can be
examined.
8.1 Black Hole and Neutron Star Formation in Supernovae
and Related Events
Black holes and neutron stars form in core collapse supernovae. When the core of the star has
exhausted its nuclear fuel by fusing all its material into iron-peak elements, its only available
source of energy is gravitational collapse. At the low end of the range of stellar masses sufficient
to undergo core collapse, nucleonic degeneracy pressure will be sufficient to support the core

Black Holes and Neutron Stars
after this happens, leaving a neutron star. At the upper end of this mass range, a full collapse will
take place, turning nearly the entire star into a black hole (see, e.g., Fryer and Kalogera 2001 for
a discussion).
In the case where the core of the massive star turns into a neutron star, there remain two
possibilities. In some cases, the gravitational binding energy released by the collapse will be
sufficient to blow away the entire remaining mass in the star in the ensuing supernova. For
somewhat more massive stars, the supernova explosion unbinds only a fraction of the material
from the outer star, and a fallback of the remainining material onto the young neutron star takes
place, leading to the formation of a black hole through the accretion of this material, rather than
through the prompt collapse scenario. As a result, these “fallback” black holes might be expected
to have natal kicks. The small amount of observational data that exists to test this idea supports
it – GRO J1655-40 is a relatively low mass (∼M⊙) black hole, and has a space velocity of about
100 km/s relative to its local standard of rest, a value which is difficult to accommodate with just
a Blaauw kick (e.g., Nelemans et al. 1999). Additionally, a recent reexamination of the distances
tolow mass X-raybinaries has indicated that the scale height ofthe black hole LMXBpopulation
is about 1 kpc, similar to that of the neutron star LMXB population, and much larger than the
scale height of the donor star population (Jonker and Nelemans 2004).
It is important to note that the mass estimates for black holes and neutron stars come
predominantly from compact objects in close binary systems. Because of this, the measured
mass functions of black holes, especially may be severely biased. Theoretical work indicates
that the binary evolutionary processes that lead to black hole X-ray binary formation can have
significant effects on the masses of the black holes that are produced.
The formation channels for compact objects in binary systems are necessarily rather com-
plicated in most cases. Simply evoking independent evolution of two stars in a binary system
would yield the result, for example, that it is impossible to form most neutron star X-ray bina-
ries. The mass loss of the supernova explosion will take away more than half the mass of the
binary system in most such cases. The most prominent solution to this problem is to invoke
common envelope evolution early in the lifetime of the binary system. What this means is that
when the heavier of the two stars in a binary system evolves off the main sequence, it expands
to the point where it envelopes the other star. During this process, a considerable amount of
mass can be ejected, making possible the formation of low-mass X-ray binaries with neutron
stars. See, e.g., Taam and Sandquist (2000) for a review of common envelope evolution.
It is also possible, but still somewhat controversial, that some neutron stars through accre-
tion induced collapse events in systems with accreting whife dwarfs (or for two white dwarfs to
merge). In particular, it has been suggested that a large fraction of the neutron stars in globular
clusters should form in this manner (e.g., Ivanova et al. 2008) in order to solve the problem
that very few neutron stars would be retained in globular clusters given a velocity distribution
similar to that seen for isolated pulsars.
The formation scenarioes for intermediate-mass black holes are more numerous and more
controversial. Stars formed from the metal free gas in the early universe should have masses of
a ∼–, M⊙. Most evolutionary calculations indicate that these stars should have very
little mass loss during their lifetimes, and that in some mass ranges, they should undergo
prompt collapses, in which most or all of the stellar mass ends up in a black hole (e.g.,
Heger and Woosley 2002). In other mass ranges, they are thought to undergo pair instability
supernovae, and to be destroyed entirely. Lower redshift star formation may lead to the forma-
tion of intermediate-mass black holes as well, especially in dense star clusters, where runaway
mergers of massive stars may lead to the creation of a super-massive star (Portegies Zwart and

Black Holes and Neutron Stars 12
649
McMillan 2002). This supermassive star would have stronger stellar winds than a Population III
star of the same mass but might be able to reach an equilibrium at a few hundred solar masses.
8.2 Natal Kicks
The large space velocities of pulsars and the large-scale heights of low-mass X-ray binaries con-
taining neutron stars indicate that it is likely neutron stars are born with a velocity kick. In order
to establish clearly that an actual velocity kick is imparted to the neutron star at birth, it is nec-
essary to demonstrate that other mechanisms of increasing the neutron star’s velocity cannot
be responsible for the observed space velocities and spatial distributions.
Rather large space velocities for supernova products can be achieved without a velocity
impulse being applied during (or shortly after) the supernova, if the supernova takes place in a
binary system (Blaauw 1961). Rapid mass loss from a star, taking place over a timescale much
shorter than the orbital period of the binary, should lead to a recoil velocity being applied to the
binarysystem such tomake upforthe momentum lost tothe ejected material. Even a spherically
symmetric explosion will carry away linear momentum, given that the spherically symmetric
explosion will come from a star which has a motion about the center of mass of the binary.
Several mechanisms exist forexplaining the natal kicks. One possibilityis that the supernova
explosion itself may be asymmetric. Another is that the proto-neutron star may be emitting
radiation or neutrinos asymmetrically.

Conclusions
A wealth of knowledge has been collected about neutron stars and black holes in the roughly
five decades in which astronomers have been studying them. These objects have already placed
important limits on fundamental physics, and three Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work
on them. At the same time, many of the key questions remain open, or, at least, have answers
which have not yet reached consensus level. The coming years should yield more clear answers
on issues such as the mass distribution and formation mechanisms for black holes and neutron
stars, the neutron star equation of state, the spin distributions of black holes, the mechanisms
by which jets are launched, the reasons for variability in accretion disks in general, and quasi-
periodic oscillations in particular and the mechanisms by which pulsars emit, among other
questions.

Abstract:
Binary and multiple stellar systems have importance in three main areas of astron-
omy and astrophysics. First, because of the relatively simple gravitational interaction at work in
the case of binary stars, these systems provide a basic check on stellar structure and evolution
theory since the masses may be determined through observation. When these masses can be
linked to other properties of the two stars, such as luminosity, color, and radius, they can provide
very stringent constraints on stellar models. Second, the statistics of binary and multiple star
systems provide clues to star formation mechanisms and environmental effects in the galactic
gravitational potential and in clusters. Although a number of good results have been obtained
in nearby star clusters and associations, knowledge of the field population has been somewhat
limited until recently by a lack of large, complete samples of binaries. However, there appears to
be a great deal of promise in this area for the coming decade in part due to astrometric satellites
such as Hipparcos and Gaia. Third, the binary scenario is invoked to explain several important
types of astrophysical phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables, and stellar
x-ray sources. Since the first of these mentioned is a standard candle for the extragalactic dis-
tance scale, it may even be said binary stars play a minor role in field of cosmology. However,
in this chapter, the focus will mainly be on normal stars in binary and multiple-stellar systems.
The basic physics of binaries will be reviewed, and the observational methods in use today will
be discussed together with their limitations and prospects for the future. Finally, an overview of
the current science in the three main areas mentioned where binaries have a significant impact
will be given.

Introduction
When two stars appear close together on the sky, the pair is known as a double star. However,
such a case could represent just a chance alignment along the line of sight, with one star actually
much farther away from the observer than the other. This is the rather uninteresting case of an
optical double star. However, it is possible that the two stars are not only close together on the
sky but also near one another in space, in which case they will orbit one another due to their
mutual gravitational interaction. This was first suggested by John Michell (1767), but it was Sir
William Herschel who first referred to this kind of object as a “binary sidereal system,” what is
now called a binary star (Argyle 2004). Determining whether a given double star is actually a
binary requires patient observation. If only an optical double, the relative position of the pair
should change in a linear fashion over time, indicating no acceleration of one body relative to
the other. If it is a binary, a curved path should be noted over time, and indeed, if the pair is
followed long enough, one maysee the two stars complete an orbital ellipse around one another.
Herschel was the first astronomer to put forth serious efforts to observe the relative motions of
many double stars in order to conclusively determine if some of them were binaries. After some
25 years of work, he published the result that several of the systems he had been observing over
that time were in fact binaries, and not merely optical doubles (Herschel 1803). Thus the field
of visual binary star astronomy began.
Through the nineteenth and well into the twentieth centuries, the search for binary stars
and the determination of their orbits was a principal focus of the observational efforts of

656 13

astronomers such as William Herschel and his son John Herschel, F. G. W. (Wilhelm) Struve and
his son Otto, W. R. Dawes, S. W. Burnham, and R. G. Aitken. Largely through the efforts of these
and other observers, binary star astronomy began to make its first contribution to astrophysics:
the empirical determination of mass information about stars other than the Sun by application
of Newton’slaw of gravity to the observational data. The first orbit calculation, circa 1830, was of
ξ Ursa Majoris, which has a period of approximately 60 years. At least three astronomers devel-
oped methods of calculating the orbit from the observational data in that timeframe: Savary,
Encke, and John Herschel. By 1935, over 100 visual orbits had been calculated and tabulated in
Aitken’s classic work, The Binary Stars (Aitken 1935).
Once photography allowed for the collection of the spectrum of a star, examples of cases
where the absorption lines appeared to be double and regularly changing in time led to the
realization that such stars were also binary, although in almost all cases, the two stars were very
close together on the sky so that the light received could not be resolved into two stars in an
image. The first example of the detection of this phenomenon was with the star Mizar (ζ Ursa
Majoris) by E. C. Pickering in 1889 (Aitken 1935). This gave rise to a new field of study: that
of the so-called spectroscopic binary stars. The changing nature of the spectral lines could be
interpreted as the Doppler shift of the wavelength of the lines as the two stars moved toward and
away from the observer, with the complete cycle determining orbital period of the binary itself
as well as other properties of the orbit. In addition, the orbital periods of these systems were
in general much shorter than those of the visual binaries, meaning that the orbital information
for many systems could be determined in a much shorter period of time, with more complete
orbital coverage.
Pickering was also one of the first astronomers to work on a third type of binary stars in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth century (Aitken 1935). At that time, it was known that
the star Algol (β Persei) was a periodic variable star, where the variation in light intensity was
constant for some time, then dimmed for a short time, then returned to the original brightness.
Such Algol-type variables can be explained by suggesting that such systems are actually binary
stars where the plane of the orbit is perpendicular to the plane of the sky. In this case, each star
will pass in front of the other star once per orbital period, resulting in two dips in light intensity
at regular intervals. The dips would not be expected to be the same depth, since in general the
two stars will not be the same size or brightness. Thus, Algol and other variable stars of this type
can be explained as binary systems.
Two other types of binaries that are sometimes discussed are the astrometric binaries and
spectrum binaries. An astrometric binary is when one observes extremely small, periodic shifts
in the position of a star relative to fixed background stars. From this, one may deduce that a
gravitational acceleration is being exerted on the star, albeit by an unseen companion. Usually,
the second star will be of far lower luminosity than the first so that the light detected is dom-
inated by the brighter star, yet the gravitational influence is sufficient to see the reflex motion
as the brighter object orbits the common center of mass. A classic discovery of this type is the
motion of the main-sequence star Sirius A (α Canis Majoris), though, subsequently, observa-
tions were able to detect the faint companion star, which is a white dwarf. In a similar way, a
spectrum binary is a star in which variations are observed in the spectrum and the object is
therefore presumed to be binary, but no firm conclusion can be made about the nature of the
orbit of the system. This might occur for example if the period is very long so that the shift of
spectral lines is only marginally detectable with a given spectrograph.
It is interesting to note that the three main types of binaries are divided by observational
technique, and not by object morphology, as the names indicate: astrometric observations are

used to obtain orbital information of visual (and astrometric) systems, spectroscopy is needed
for spectroscopic (and spectrum) binaries, and photometry is the main tool when studying
eclipsing binary stars. It is obviously possible to have a given binary system be both an eclips-
ing and spectroscopic system for example (meaning that it can be successfully observed with
both techniques), or to be both a visual binary and a spectroscopic system, but through most of
the history of binary star astronomy, there have been few examples of such good fortune. The
implications of this fact have made it difficult from an observational point of view to develop
complete, statistically significant samples of binaries from which to study their properties. It
is easier to measure a large orbital velocity using spectroscopy since that will produce a larger
Doppler shift and a greater change in the position of the lines being observed. However, this
technique therefore favors small separations and/or large masses, since Kepler’s laws tell us that
the larger the separation and/or the smaller the masses, the smaller the orbital speed. On the
other hand, observations of visual binaries favor larger separations so that the two stars can be
clearly resolved. Thus, it has often been said that spectroscopic and astrometric techniques are
complementary methods of studying binaries. However, modern high-resolution imaging and
high-precision spectroscopy have finally bridged this gap: although an old field in comparison
to many other areas of active research in astrophysics, binary star astronomy has greatly ben-
efited from the application of modern observational techniques to obtain new and significant
results.
Multiple stellar systems, that is, cases of more than two stars that are gravitationally bound,
also exist. In fact, the work of Abt and Levy (1976) and Duquennoy and Mayor (1991) both
show that multiple stellar systems of all types (including binaries) are roughly as common as
single stars, at least for solar-type stars. Duquennoy and Mayor, for example, found that the
relative frequency of single stars, binaries, trinary stars, and quadruple stars is approximately
57%:38%:4%:1%, respectively. In multiple stellar systems, one refers to the components of such
systems, starting with the brightest member (the primary star) labeled as the A component,
and then companions at successively larger separations from the primary labeled as the B, C, D
components, and so on. Sometimes, a close component is discovered after a wider component;
in these cases, a lower-case letter is used to indicate this. Each pair of components can be stud-
ied with one or more of the techniques already discussed. Studies of orbital stability suggest
that long-lived multiple star systems will form in a hierarchical way, with each successively
wider component at a separation much larger than that of the previous component relative
to the primary star. In more general terms, both the process of formation and the environ-
ment can influence the statistics of orbital parameters, such as period, eccentricity, and so on.
In dense stellar environments, such as star clusters, systems of wide separation are thought to
be dispersed over time, whereas smaller separation systems evolve toward smaller separations
through stellar encounters. Hierarchical triple stars may be preferentially formed in encounters
of two binary systems, where one component is cast out of the system. When a component of a
multiple system is ejected, it is often with high velocity and is known as a runaway. Such run-
away stars can sometimes be identified as high proper-motion objects that are heading away
from a known multiple system at approximately the same distance.
It can also be convenient to categorize binary stars in terms of physical processes. Most
“normal” binaries observed with the techniques described are physically separated stars whose
main interaction is simply to orbit one another; that is, they are detached systems. However, in
the case of very close binaries, there can be effects such as rotational synchronization and mass
transfer between the two stars that significantly change the evolution of the system and its astro-
physical properties. In the most extreme case, the surfaces of the stars can have severe distortion

to the star and a common surface, leading to the notion of a contact binary. In less extreme cases,
mass infall to the other star can result in many interesting processes that are observed in X-ray
binaries, cataclysmic variable stars, and Type I supernovae. These are phenomena that can be
explained by the model of a “semidetached” binary system.

Observational Techniques
2.1 The Dynamical Problem
It is useful to begin with a brief synopsis of the two-body problem from classical mechanics.
When one star orbits another, the force of gravity provides an acceleration that leads to the devi-
ation from rectilinear motion. The force on one star due to the other follows Newton’s famous
equation:
F= −G mm
∣r∣ˆr,
(13.1)
where r is the relative coordinate vector, r−r, and ˆr is the unit vector in the r direction. The
force is directed along a line joining the two masses, and is attractive, as indicated by the sign of
the right hand side of (> 13.1). Since the forces acting on these masses are radial in the relative
coordinate and the center of mass will be along the line joining the two masses, there is no
net torque in the absence of external forces on the system. Therefore, the angular momentum
vector,
L = r × (m+ m)v,
(13.2)
is conserved. The total mechanical energy, in other words the sum of the kinetic and potential
energies (K and U respectively), is by definition
ETOT = K + U = ( 
mv
+ 
mv
) −G mm
∣r∣
,
(13.3)
which is also conserved in the absence of external forces. Defining the center of mass of the
system as
rCM =
m
m+ m
r+
m
m+ m
r,
(13.4)
it can be shown that the velocity of the center of mass remains constant (and is usually assumed
to be zero without loss of generality). Because the only two forces, Fand F, are equal and
opposite according to the form of (> 13.1) (and as required by Newton’s third law of motion),
the above equation can be used to show that the velocities and accelerations of the two bodies
are related as follows:
v= −m
m
vand a= −m
m
a.
(13.5)
By using the above and doing some algebraic manipulation on (> 13.3), the expression for the
kinetic energy may be rewritten as
K = 

mm
m+ m
v
(13.6)
where
v = dr
dt −dr
dt = dr
dt ,
(13.7)

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13

and rand rare the distance vectors from the center of mass to mand m, respectively, and r
is the relative coordinate vector. (The vector directions of rand rare opposite, leading to the
minus sign in the above.) Finally, rewriting (> 13.3) in total,
ETOT = 

mm
m+ m
(dr
dt )

−G
mm
m+m(m+ m)
r
.
(13.8)
The quantity μ =
mm
m+mis referred to as the reduced mass, and recognizing m+ mas the total
mass of the system, (> 13.8) can be written in final form as
ETOT = 
μ (dr
dt )

−G μmTOT
r
.
(13.9)
Thus, the total energy of the system is identical to that of a particle of mass μ moving in a
potential well of strength determined by the total mass. It is well known that the solution to
this differential equation is most easily expressed in plane polar coordinates, that is, r = (r, θ),
and will be one of three conic sections, depending on the total energy. If the total energy is
greater than zero, a hyperbola is obtained; if ETOT = then the solution is a parabola; and if
ETOT < 0, an ellipse. The first two cases represent unbound orbits with no defined orbital period,
whereas the ellipse of course does yield periodic motion. In that case, the period P is related
to the semimajor axis a of the ellipse and the total mass using Newton’s formulation of Kepler’s
harmonic law:
P=
π
G ⋅mTOT
a,
(13.10)
where G is the universal gravitational constant. This shows for example that, if the period and
semimajor axis can be determined, a total mass can be calculated.
2.2 Visual Binaries
2.2.1 The Visual Orbit
In the case of visual binaries, the angular separation, orientation, and brightness of the two stars
relative to one another can be observed over time. If we define the brighter star in the system
as the primary star and the dimmer as the secondary star, then the typical definition of the
orientation is the angle between a line drawn from the primary to the celestial north pole and
a line drawn from the primary through the secondary. North through east usually defines the
positive sense of this angle, which is known as the position angle and is usually written as θ.
Over time, the astrometric data (separation and position angle) will trace out the relative
orbit of the system projected onto the plane of the sky. In the plane of the true orbit, the motion
will trace out an ellipse as discussed in the previous section, and when this shape is projected
onto the plane of the sky, the result is also an ellipse. (That is, an ellipse viewed at an angle is still
an ellipse, albeit one with different characteristics in general.) Two complications arise when
attempting to determine the total mass of the system from the observational data, however.
First, since the true orbital ellipse will not be in the plane of the sky in general, the angles that
allow for the transformation between the apparent ellipse and the true ellipse must be known.
Second, even after the geometry of the true orbit is known, the semimajor axis will still be an
angular quantity, and therefore the distance to the system is needed to convert this value into
an actual separation distance in linear units, as required for entry into (> 13.10).

The first problem has been elegantly solved by several astronomers dating back to the nine-
teenth century; a good example of a modern approach is that of Docobo (1985). These solutions
show that seven parameters characterize the motion of the system on the sky. These seven
parameters can be stated in various ways but encapsulate the transformation of coordinates
between the plane of the true orbit and the plane of the sky, as well as the properties of the
true ellipse (size, eccentricity, and orientation) in the plane of the true orbit. The most common
formalism, which makes it very easy to compare the observed quantities to the seven orbital
parameters, requires the definition of three angular quantities. The first of these is the inclina-
tion angle, i, which is the angle between the plane of the true orbit and the plane of the sky.
Considering then the intersection of these two planes, a line is formed which cuts through the
orbital ellipse and contains the location of the primary, which is a focus of the true relative
orbital ellipse. There will be two points on the orbit that lie along that line: these are points of
contact between the apparent and true ellipses, and are known as the nodes. (The line connect-
ing the two points and containing the primary focus of the ellipse is known as the line of nodes.)
Although some texts differentiate between the ascending node and descending node, the node
that has a position angle between 0○and 180○is often referred to as the “nodal point,” or in some
references, simply the “node,” written Ω. Finally, there will be some angle in the plane of the
true orbit between the nodal point and the location of periastron (closest approach of the two
stars), which lies along the semimajor axis of the ellipse; this is usually written ω. >Figure 13-1
illustrates the geometry of the situation. The three angular quantities – i, Ω, and ω – are gener-
ally reported in degrees. Four other parameters relate to the physical properties of the ellipse:
(1) P, the period of the system (in days or years); (2) a, the semimajor axis of the system, in arc
seconds or milli-arc seconds (mas); (3) T, the time of periastron passage (in units matching the
period, either Julian date or Besselian year); and (4) e, the eccentricity of the orbital ellipse.
Adding the three geometrical parameters to the four physical parameters, the seven orbital
parameters are then related to the observable quantities (ρ, θ, and t) according to the following
equations:
μ = ○
P
(13.11)
M = μ (t −T) = E −e sin E

(13.16)
In the above, five intermediate quantities are mathematically defined. These are known as μ,
the average number of degrees through which the companion travels per year, M, the mean
anomaly, E, the eccentric anomaly, v, the true anomaly, and r, the radius vector. For further
information on these quantities, a good reference is Alzner (2004).

which marks the intersection of the two planes, is shown as a solid line
From the above relations, if one chooses a set of orbital parameters, then it is possible to
compute the separation and position angle as a function of time. (That is, one may compute
an ephemeris for the system). If a sequence of observations (ρi, θi, ti) is available, then the
ephemeris predictions may be compared with the observational results. Using various mini-
mization algorithms, one can then choose new orbital elements in an iterative way until such
point as the ephemeris predictions and the observational data are consistent, usually judged by
computing a reduced chi-squared statistic. One typical difficulty is that the chi-squared parame-
ter space is usually quite nonlinear, and if the initial parameters are not close enough to the final
orbit, the procedure may not converge to the global minimum of the reduced chi-squared func-
tion. For this reason, techniques have been devised to search larger sections of the parameter
space prior to minimization in order to insure proper convergence. Examples include simulated
annealing (Pourbaix 2002) and grid searching (Hartkopf et al. 1996). >Figure 13-2 shows an
example of typical quality for speckle data; the orbit is that of Balega et al. (2007).

to have orbital motion through speckle observations over the last 15 years
In order to obtain the size of the orbit, the distance to the system must be determined in
some way. The typical method is trigonometric parallax π, where the quantity (a/π) then gives
the true system separation in astronomical units. Rearranging (> 13.10), it can be seen that

This formula shows the fundamental difficulty of the problem of obtaining stellar mass infor-
mation from visual binary stars: one must know both the semimajor axis and the parallax to
very high precision if a small uncertainty in mass is desired.(There is generally no issue in deter-
mining the period to as high a precision as needed, at least compared to the other two quantities
involved.)
2.2.2 Overview of the Observational Data
The most complete catalog of observations of visual binary stars is the Washington Double
Star Catalog (WDS), maintained by the U.S. Naval Observatory, http://www.usno.navy.mil/
USNO/astrometry/optical-IR-prod/wds/WDS. This resource includes over 700,000 measures

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13

of approximately 100,000 systems and shows quite a range of techniques for obtaining the
basic observed quantities over the long history of binary star observations. The great major-
ity of observations taken before 1970 were using the technique of visual micrometry. The visual
micrometer is essentially a customized eyepiece with a movable crosshair system that allows
the observer to mark and measure the position angle and separation of the two stars. Past gen-
erations of binary star observers took great care in extracting the highest possible precision
from this method and were able to measure systems far below the seeing-limited resolution in
many cases due to their skill and visual acuity, in essence overcoming the blurring effects of the
atmosphere in the images seen to deduce small separations. Aitken (1935) has a complete dis-
cussion of this instrument and its use. The precision of the best observers using this technique
approached 10 mas in separation.
Nonetheless, the precision of the astrometry obtainable with visual micrometry has been
superseded by the modern high-resolution techniques. These include interferometric tech-
niques such as speckle interferometry, long baseline optical interferometry, Fine Guidance
Sensor observations using the Hubble Space Telescope and other space-based observations,
and adaptive optics. These techniques, particularly speckle interferometry, make up the bulk
of the observations in the WDS since 1970, and a separate catalog of these observations is also
maintained at the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Fourth Catalog of Interferometric Measurements
of Binary Stars, http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astrometry/optical-IR-prod/wds/int4. This
catalog currently has over 100,000 observations of resolved double stars, with precision in
separation from 1 to a few mas, depending on technique and telescope aperture.
A third resource again due to work at the U.S. Naval Observatory, is the Sixth Catalogue of
Orbits of Visual Binary Stars, http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astrometry/optical-IR-prod/
wds/orb6. As of this writing, the catalog contains orbital elements for over 2,000 visual bina-
ries. Most systems do have parallax determinations, but the quality of the orbital elementsvaries
considerably, as do the distances, and estimates of the mass sums come with considerable uncer-
tainty in the majority of cases. The catalog has a rating system of 1 (best) to 10 (worst) so that
the user has some indication of the quality of the particular orbital calculation.
2.2.3 Speckle Interferometry
In speckle interferometry, the observation consists of several hundred to a few thousand short
exposure images of the target. In each exposure, the atmospheric fluctuations are effectively
frozen and the frame represents a distorted image of the target. The distortions are linked to
the fact that the wavefronts of light passing down through the atmosphere from the target
encounter variations in the refractive index that then lead to a flat wavefront becoming rough or
corrugated. When the light enters the telescope aperture, the phase of the wavefront is roughly
uniform across a distance of roughly 10–20 cm, known as the Fried parameter, but varies greatly
from one side of a large telescope aperture to the other. This phenomenon is an example of what
is known as partial coherence in statistical optics. One may then think of the large telescope
aperture consisting of many sub-apertures, each of which has a phase uncorrelated with that of
the other sub-apertures.
Since there are two relevant length scales on the plane of the aperture, namely the Fried
parameter and the size of the telescope aperture itself, one may expect the same basic structure
on the image plane. The result is an image that contains many small bright points, or speckles,
that are confined within a much larger envelope of light, the seeing disk. The size of the speckles

664 13
Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems
is that of the diffraction limited spot size of the telescope aperture as a whole, whereas the size
of the seeing disk is set by the size of the Fried parameter. Since optics tells us that the image
is the modulus-square of the Fourier transform of the value of the electromagnetic field inside
the aperture, there is an inverse relationship in the size scales: the larger the telescope aper-
ture, the smaller the speckles, and the smaller the Fried parameter, the larger the seeing disk.
As the atmospheric fluctuations change above the telescope, then the position and intensity of
individual speckles changes within the seeing disk, though the overall size of the seeing disk
itself remains relatively constant over typical observation times. In a long-exposure image, the
speckle nature of the image washes out, even though in a short exposure image there is high-
resolution information, as evidenced by the presence of the speckles themselves. On the other
hand, if the exposure is short enough, then each star in the object will create a nearly-identical
speckle pattern on the image plane (since the light from both stars travels down to the telescope
through nearly the same column of air), and therefore for a double star, a double-image effect
is present in individual frames.
In order to retrieve the high-resolution information, one must first have a camera capa-
ble of keeping up with the timescale of the atmospheric turbulence, which is on the order of
10–30 ms under typical observing conditions. The sequence of short exposure images (frames)
taken during a typical speckle observation is needed to keep the contrast of speckles high – that
is, to prevent significant blurring of speckles that would lead to reduced resolution overall. But,
if this is achieved, then the path back to a high-resolution image is essentially a deconvolution
problem, although not a trivial one by any means. The first step in the process is to form the
average autocorrelation function of the frame sequence, given by:
⟨An(x, y)⟩= ⟨∬dx′dy′In(x′, y′)In(x′ + x, y′ + y)⟩,
(13.19)
where the brackets indicate an average over all image frames. It can be shown that this function
retains diffraction-limited information. This can be most clearly seen by thinking of double
stars of decreasing separation on the image plane. In wide doubles, where the separation is
larger than the seeing disk, the system is classically resolved, though each speckle pattern will
be nearly a copy of the other. As the separation becomes smaller than the seeing disk, then the
speckle patterns begin to significantly overlap, but the presence of two stars can still be noted by
the occurrence of speckle pairs at a given separation. That is what the autocorrelation function
calculates. If a system is a double star, then peaks will form at the positive and negative vector
separation of the secondary star (as well as at the origin), even if the two stars are only separated
by a speckle width, i.e., at the diffraction limit.
Since the autocorrelation function is symmetric, it leaves an ambiguity in the position angle
of the secondary star between the true position angle and the location 180○away from that
value. This has been solved in various ways, including directed vector correlation (Bagnuolo
1988), shift-and-add techniques (e.g., Bates and Cady 1980), and bispectral analysis (Lohmann
et al. 1983). In directed vector autocorrelation, when the autocorrelation function of a frame
is computed, the number of counts in the two pixels (x, y) and (x′, y′) are compared, and
the autocorrelation function is only incremented in the location corresponding to the direc-
tion of the brighter speckle to the fainter. In some cases, due to small sample statistics, one
might obtain a brighter speckle in the location of the dimmer star, but when integrating over
many speckles and averaging over many frames, an asymmetry will develop between the two
peaks due the secondary in the autocorrelation function, with the higher of the peaks presum-
ably corresponding to the true position angle. Shift-and-add techniques involve focusing on a

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
665
particular image feature such as the brightest speckle and lining up this feature in all frames. A
final result is obtained by co-adding all shifted frames. In the bispectral approach, a second cor-
relation function is computed called the triple correlation (or equivalently, one may compute its
Fourier transform, known as the bispectrum). It can be shown that this data product preserves
a diffraction-limited estimate of the derivative of the phase of the object’s Fourier transform. In
combining this information with that from the autocorrelation function (which when Fourier
transformed is the modulus-square of the magnitude of the object’s Fourier transform), one can
reconstruct a diffraction-limited image. In most cases, this leaves no ambiguity in the position
of the second star.
Speckle interferometry has been the workhorse technique in the observation of visual
binaries since the 1970s because of its efficiency and robustness. Seasoned speckle observers
routinely observe more than 200 objects per night, and relatively inexpensive, easily trans-
portable cameras can be built to take the observations. Thus, the major speckle programs
have followed thousands of objects over the last 30 years, yielding over 100 high-precision
visual orbits, many from the long series of papers from the Center for High Angular Reso-
lution Astronomy (CHARA) speckle program (see, e.g., Mason et al. 1997), and, more recently,
including work from the Balega et al. (2006) and others.
2.2.4 Long-Baseline Optical Interferometry
Long-baseline optical interferometry has a long history in astronomy, beginning with the obser-
vations of Michelson in the 1920s of the diameters of several stars from the Mount Wilson
100-in. telescope. Michelson used an aperture mask that only accepted the light from two small
but widely separated sub-apertures, bringing the light together on a common focal plane. This
produces an interference pattern, but the fringe minima can be related to the diameter of the
star, or alternatively, the separation of a binary system. A second important early contribution
to high-resolution astronomy was the stellar intensity interferometer built by Hanbury Brown
et al. (1967, 1970) and operated in the late 1960s and early 1970s at Narrabri in Australia. This
system had two extremely large (6.5-m full diameter) mosaic telescopes that could be moved
on tracks to different separations and orientations. At the focal plane of each telescope was a
photomultiplier tube, which registered the detected photons per time interval. By correlating
these intensity signals, it is possible to relate the result to the spatial structure of the source.
Observations of binary stars were greatly aided by the development and use of the Mark
III Interferometer in the 1980s and early 1990s. This instrument was essentially of the Michel-
son type but could compensate for atmospheric fluctuations before bringing the light from two
different apertures together to interfere. A number of spectroscopic binary stars were observed
and resolved for the first time using the system; as discussed later in this chapter, the combined
visual/spectroscopic orbit for a double-lined spectroscopic binary star gives a complete solu-
tion to the astrophysical quantities of interest (individual masses, luminosities, and effective
temperatures) without recourse to an external distance measure, and indeed the distance also
falls out of the solution. This was one of the first instruments to truly cross the divide between
the visual and spectroscopic binary stars, and also pointed the way for future progress in the
field of interferometry.
Current generation long-baseline optical interferometers include the Navy Prototype Opti-
cal Interferometer (NPOI) located at Anderson Mesa, near Flagstaff, Arizona, the CHARA
Array at Mount Wilson, the Keck Interferometer, where the light from the two Keck 10-m

666 13
Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems
Telescopes on Mauna Kea is combined, and the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI)
at the European Southern Observatory. Each of these systems has separation between the most
distant stations (baselines) of 100 m or more, and therefore can achieve ultrahigh-resolution
information of sources observed. While some of the work done with these systems has been on
shorter period binary stars, these instruments have mainly focused of late on the problem of
determining stellar radii and imaging stellar surfaces. Nonetheless, when used for binary work,
they can produce visual orbital elements of exquisite quality, as in Muterspaugh et al. (2008).
2.2.5 Adaptive Optics
Adaptive optics is another technique that allows for high-resolution images (i.e., significantly
higher than that of the seeing disk) to be collected of a target. The basic idea of this method is
to correct for the corrugation of the wave front imposed by the atmosphere (and resulting in a
seeing-limited image) in real time with a deformable mirror system. A common method is to
split the beam and send part of a collimated beam from the target through a lenslet array. When
the images from the lenslet array are recorded on a fast-readout detector, image shifts will be
present due to the slope of the portion of the wavefront that is collected by each lenslet. From
this set of image shifts, one may calculate the amount of deformation needed for the moveable
mirror to re-flatten the wavefront from the target.
Adaptive optics has been highly successful in many areas of astronomy, but for precise
binary star measurements, it has not been widely adopted. Initially, the technique was thought
to avoid the so-called “magnitude difference” problem that plagued speckle interferometry
through the mid-1990s. This effect was to render unreliable the magnitude difference between
the primary and secondary star of a binary system obtained from the technique due to detec-
tor nonlinearities and observing constraints. However, it was found that reliable photometry
from adaptive optics images is also not as easily obtained as first thought: it was still neces-
sary to take 0.1 s exposure images to avoid systematic errors from the instrumentation itself
(ten Brummelaar et al. 2000). Astrometrically, adaptive optics has not been shown to offer any
advantage over speckle interferometry. However, the main advantage is that fainter targets may
certainly be observed with adaptive optics, due to the fact that the correction to the wavefront
is made in real time and a true integrating detector (such as a low noise CCD camera) may
be used to collect the image. Also, many adaptive optics systems are optimized for use in the
infrared so that the resolution is lower than typical results with speckle interferometry. Thus,
the choice of instrument is influenced by the characteristics of the objects to be observed.
2.2.6 Space-Based Observations
Two important sources of space-based measuresof binary stars are Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS)
observations using the Hubble Space Telescope, and binary star measures by Hipparcos, the
European astrometric satellite. The main function of the Fine Guidance Sensors aboard the
Hubble Space Telescope is stable pointing ofthe telescope while otherscience cameras are in use.
However, one of the three sensors can also be scheduled for science observations and has excel-
lent characteristic for determining both astrometric and photometric properties of binary star

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
667
systems. The heart of the Fine Guidance Sensor system is a Koesters prism. It is an amplitude-
splitting interferometerwith two phototubes that collect the signal from the two exit faces of the
prism. For small-separation binary star work, the instrument is scanned back and forth across
an object, collecting signals at regular time intervals (nominally 1 ms). These signals are then
combined into a transfer function
T(x) = A(x) −B(x)
A(x) + B(x),
(13.20)
where A(x) is the number of photons detected in phototube Aas a function of scan position and
B(x) is the number of photons detected in phototube B as a function of scan position. When the
signal is the same in both channels, as when the scan position is centered on the star, then the
numerator of the transfer function will be zero, but as the scan position changes even slightly
from that, then one can achieve the condition of constructive interference in one arms of the
interferometer with destructive interference in the other arm. In those cases, the transfer func-
tion has value ±1, depending on which side of the zero point the telescope is pointing. If the
light coming through the system were monochromatic, then a series of maxima and minima
would be detected as a function of scan position, but the system is essentially panchromatic
through the visible, leading to rapid loss of contrast in the fringe maxima and minima. In the
end, what is recorded for typical stellar sources is a single maximum on one side of the center
position and a single minimum on the other side. An example is shown in >Fig. 13-3. Because

of the appearance, the transfer function is sometimes called the “S-curve.” Each point source
in the field will generate its own S-curve offset from the zero position by some amount.
Blended S-curves are separatedthrough fitting a single star S-curve convolved with a binary star
model.
The FGS system has two independentinterferometers operating simultaneously in orthogo-
nal directions. To determine the position angle and separation, information from both must be
combined. Because of the simplicity of the image in the case of a binary star, complete position
angle and separation information can be obtained, as well as two estimates of the brightness
ratio of the system. Due to the sensitivity of the system, separations as small as 10 mas can be
measured reliably, and stars as faint as magnitude 17 can be observed successfully. For this rea-
son, FGS has been used to search for binary stars in nearby open clusters (Franz et al. 1992). FGS
has also helped to define the lower end of the Mass-Luminosity Relation (Henry et al. 1999).
The Hipparcos Satellite was launched in 1989 and took both astrometric and photometric
data of about 118,000 nearby stars until 1993 (ESA 1997). The satellite was designed to record
data with a photomultiplier tube as stars passed over a grid on the image plane so that the signal
obtained had a regular modulation in time for a single star. In the case of a close double star, the
details of the modulation pattern would change, from which the separation and position angle
could eventually be determined. The main result of the publication of the Hipparcos Catalogue
was to give much better distances to stars than had been possible from the ground, but the satel-
lite also serendipitously discovered about 3,400 previously unknown binary systems. Since the
publication of the catalogue, binary star observers have made many follow-up observations of
these stars to determine which ones are in fact binary stars and to determine orbital parameters
for objects in this subset.
2.2.7 Lunar Occultation Measurements of Binaries
When the dark limb of the moon passes over a star, one may observe the change in brightness
in time to reveal the classic diffraction pattern of a “knife edge,” where the exact moment of
occultation by the Moon can be easily measured to high precision, if the detector is sufficiently
fast. If the system is a close binary star, then the stars pass behind the Moon in rapid succession,
leading tothe superposition oftwosuch interference patterns. The relative displacement ofthese
patterns yields the projected separation along the direction of the Moon’s motion as well as the
brightness ratio of the components. The Catalogue of High Angular Resolution Measurements
(Richichi and Percheron 2002) contains hundreds of projected separation measures of binaries,
some as small as 1–2 mas. In addition, the diameters of the stars can sometimes be estimated.
The Fourth Catalogue of Interferometric Measures of Binary Stars discussed in >Sect. 2.2.2 also
contains occultation measures.
The value of such observations over time is place constraints on the masses, luminosities,
and temperatures of the stars for stellar astrophysical studies. The main limitations are the
lack of full-sky coverage, necessity to observe at a given moment, and the fact that only one-
dimensional positional information is obtained, but on the other hand it is a very inexpensive
technique and can be used to V magnitudes of as faint as 18. However, there has been a decline
in the use of the technique in favor of long-baseline optical interferometry, which offers com-
parable resolution and no restrictions on sky position (although it is limited to much brighter
stars).

2.3 Spectroscopic Binaries
2.3.1 The Spectroscopic Orbit
For a spectroscopic binary star, the observed spectrum will exhibit line shifts due to the Doppler
effect. Consider the double-lined case. If the two stars are comparable in brightness and have
similar line features, double lines will be observed in the spectrum when one of the two stars is
moving toward the observer and the other star is moving away. Recalling the (nonrelativistic)
Doppler formula, one has that
Δλ
λ
= v
c ,
(13.21)
where Δλ is the shift of the wavelength relative to the rest wavelength for the line, λ, v is the
radial velocity of the component, and c is the speed of light. The shift Δλ is taken to be positive
when the object is receding, and negative when the object is approaching. Thus, the observa-
tional data yield velocities along the line of sight to the observer, that is, only one component of
the velocity vector as a function of time. The orbital period of the system is easily determined
from a sequence of velocities as the periodicity of the velocity variations is the same as that of
the orbit.
The simplest case one can consider is that of two stars moving in circular orbits about the
center of mass in a plane perpendicular to the sky, that is, viewed edge-on so that i = 90○(Zeilik
and Gregory 1998). The stars in such a system will have uniform orbital speeds given by
v= πr
P
and v= πr
P ,
(13.22)
where rand rare the radii ofeach orbit relative tothe centerofmass and P is the orbital period.
The observed radial velocities will be the projection of the velocity vector as each star completes
its orbit; suppose that at time t = , vis directed toward the observer and vis directed away,
then since the velocity vector uniformly changes direction, the component along the line of
sight in each case will be
v,obs = −vcos( π
P t) and v,obs = vcos( π
P t).
(13.23)
On the other hand, the definition of the center of mass allows one to deduce that
mr= mr.
(13.24)
Combining and rearranging these two equations, it is easy to show that
m
m
= r
r
= v
v
.
(13.25)
The relative orbit in this case will have semimajor axis given by a = r+ r, and so rewriting
Kepler’s harmonic law (> 13.10) with the help of (> 13.21), we have
m+ m= π[ P
π (v+ v)]

GP
= P (v+ v)
πG
.
(13.26)
> Equations 13.24 and >13.25 represent two equations in two unknowns, namely mand m,
and so individual masses can be obtained. The orbital radii can be obtained in a similar way, if
the semimajor axis in (> 13.25) is expressed in terms of rand r, instead of velocities.

670 13
Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems
Most systems will neither have an orbital inclination of 90○nor a circular relative orbit,
however. If the observed velocity variation is sinusoidal, then the orbits will still be circular and
the orbital inclination merely adds a projection term into the observed velocities as follows:
v,obs = −vsin i cos( π
P t) and v,obs = vsin i cos( π
P t).
(13.27)
Comparing the above with (> 13.24), one can see that it is still possible to derive the mass ratio
of the system, though without the inclination angle, neither the total mass of the system nor
the semimajor axis a can be determined. However, the quantity a sin i can be calculated, and
this serves as a lower limit to the value of a itself. If the orbit has a nonzero eccentricity, then
the shape of the velocity curves will be affected, but one can determine from the shape both
the eccentricity and the angle between the major axis and the line of nodes in the true orbit
plane (ω).
By plotting the velocities of the primary and secondary as a function of time, i.e., the velocity
curve, it can be seen that the curves cross twice per orbital period. These points occur when the
motion of both stars is tangential to the plane of the sky and hence neither has a component
along the line of sight. Two examples are shown in >Fig. 13-4. The motion of the system as
a whole may still have a component along the line of sight so that these crossing points will
not occur at zero-velocity in general. The amplitude of the variations gives the velocity of the
component relative to the center of mass motion. The geometry of the orbit and its orientation
relative to the plane of the sky determinethe exact shape of the velocity curve; similar to the case
of visual orbits, this leads to a convenient parameterization that includes (1) the orbital period
P, (2) the angle in the plane of the true orbit between the line of nodes and the semimajor axis,
ω, (3) the time of periastron passage T, (4) the eccentricity e, (5) the system velocity γ, (6) the
velocity amplitudes Kand K, and (7) the mass fraction q = m/m. It is also possible to derive
from these data asini, which is also usually stated with the above quantities. Note that four of
these parameters are identical to those solved for in the case of a visual orbit.
In the case of a single-lined spectroscopic binary, only the velocity curve of the primary
is obtained. This makes it impossible to obtain the mass fraction of the system. Nonetheless,
Kepler’s harmoniclaw is still valid, as is the centerofmass equation ((>13.23)above). Therefore,
one may write that
(m+ m) P= (r+ r)= r
(+ r



(+ m

(13.28)
This leads to the definition of the mass function, f (m, m) as:
f (m, m) = r
,obs
P
=
m
sini
(m+ m).
(13.29)
For a circular orbit, r,obs can be obtained from the velocity amplitude and the period using
(>13.22). Although the mass function falls short of giving individual masses of the two stars, it
can still be useful statistically. For a large sample of binaries, if one assumes that the inclination
angle has a uniform random distribution from −○to +○, then the expectation value of sini
is 0.59. However, it is alsoeasiertodetect a system at high inclination since the projected velocity
amplitude is greater. Therefore, the observed number will be biased higher. This can be modeled
based on the velocity precision of a given spectrograph and other factors. Once estimated, then
the remaining factors only depend on mass, and so a given distribution of masses can be used
to generate a mass function and compared with the observational data.

2.3.2 Overview of Spectroscopic Data
The most complete catalog of spectroscopic orbital elements is the Ninth Catalogue of
Spectroscopic Binary Orbits, http://sb9.astro.ulb.ac.be/. The database contains orbits for some
2,400 systems. Quality is currently graded on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), as determined
by those who have maintained the catalog, though the scale is soon to be changed in favor
of a more objective scoring system. The data as a whole show several interesting characteris-
tics. First, the orbital periods represented in the catalog span a very large range, from 10−to
10days. As expected from Kepler’s harmonic law, the longer periods correlate to the smaller
velocity amplitudes. The data also show a relationship between period and eccentricity in the
sense that longer-period systems span the complete range of eccentricity from 0 to 1, whereas
short period systems (those with periods less than approximately 10 days) tend to have lower
eccentricities. This is expected due to the tidal interactions that come into play when the two
stars are in close proximity so that short-period systems become circularized on a time scale of
one to a few billion years. Thus, it is worth noting that the simplification of a circular orbit used
above is more useful than it might at first appear.
2.3.3 Observational Techniques
The range of techniques that have been used in the observation of spectroscopic binary star sys-
tems is much less varied than in the case of visual binary stars. Starting with the inception of the
technique through the 1970s, spectra were collected on photographic plates. A major advance
occurred when Griffin (1970) developed cross-correlation spectroscopy. In this method, the
spectrum of the star is passed through a mask which transmits light only at wavelengths where
prominent absorption features exist. The transmitted light is then fed into a photomultiplier
tube. The mask can be moved back and forth verypreciselyuntil the numberofcounts registered
by the photomultiplier tube is a minimum. This marks the point where the stellar absorption
lines lie directly on top of the transmission windows on the mask. Precisions of less than 1 km/s
can be determined in this way, and the successful development of the technique led later to the
CORAVEL spectrometer of Mayor et al. (1983), which has been used for a number of important
projects in binary star astronomy.
In manyotherspectrographs, CCDs have been used in the visible region ofthe spectrum and
infrared arrays for wavelengths longer than the visible cutoff. The optical design of the spectro-
graph has remained essentially the same. A typical modern example is the Keck High Resolution
Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), which can achieve radial velocity precision of 20–30 m/s for
spectroscopic binary star work. It is primarily used in the visible range of the spectrum. As its
name indicates, it is a cross-dispersedinstrument, meaning that different pieces of the spectrum
are focused in strips onto a single large format detector.
A variation on this theme important for binary star work is the multi-object spectrograph,
for example, the Hydra instrument at the WIYN 3.5-m telescope, located at Kitt Peak National
Observatory in the United States. This instrument has the ability to configure the locations of
approximately 100 optical fibers on the image plane so that the each can collect the light of one
star. This is particularly useful in studying open star clusters (Mathieu 2000). Radial velocities
obtained in this way are not as precise as with the Keck instrument described above; they are
in the range of a few tenths of a km/s. However, this is still quite sufficient for the detection of
spectroscopic binaries and determination of their orbital elements.

Infrared spectrometers have become extremely important in binary star astronomy in the
last two decades for two reasons. First, it allows for the observation pre-main sequence bina-
ries, which are often very red and therefore bright in the infrared. Thus, the determination of
spectroscopic orbital elements in addition to a visual orbit can give vital mass and dynamical
information about this critical phase of stellar evolution. Second, in a single-lined spectroscopic
binary, the secondary is too faint to reliably measure the location of the absorption features in
the spectrum. If the binary consists of two main sequence stars, this implies that the secondary
is also much redder than the primary. If the system were observed in the infrared, the contrast
between the secondary and primary would be reduced. This leads to the possibility of detecting
the secondary in the infrared, that is, effectively turning the system into a double-lined system
by observing it with an infrared-sensitive spectrometer (Mazeh et al. 2002). A good example of
a spectrometer that has been used for binary work of both kinds just described is the Keck Near
Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) (e.g., Prato et al. 2002). This again is an Echelle system, with
nine orders of the spectrum focused onto a 1,024 × 1,024 infrared array centered on wavelength
1.55 μm, with typical precision of better than 1 km/s.
In the reduction of spectra, the most commonly used method is to establish the degree
of correlation between the observed spectrum and template spectra. For example, the TOD-
COR algorithm (Mazeh and Zucker 1994) works by starting with a library of single-star spectra
and assumes that the observed spectrum is a combination of two spectra from the library with
different fluxes and velocities. A cross-correlation is performed for various pairs of template
spectra, which are combined to approximate the observed spectrum. When the best fit is found,
the velocities of primary and secondary are inferred. This is in some sense a variation on the
mask idea of Griffen discussed above, but carried out when the data are reduced, not during the
observation.
Finally, it is important to note the contribution of recent and ongoing spectroscopic sur-
veys done for other purposes on the knowledge base of binary stars. Two examples are the
Geneva–Copenhagen survey (Nordström et al. 2004) and the Radial Velocity Experiment
(RAVE) (Steinmetz et al. 2006). These are studies primarily aimed at the construction of large
databases of kinematics, metallicity, and relative abundance information for galactic structure
studies, but they have also discovered a number of spectroscopic binary stars. In some cases,
mass fractions have also been obtained, though without complete orbital information. Searches
for extrasolar planets have likewise identified new binaries via spectroscopic and photometric
studies. These samples provide new binaries that could be used in the future for comparisons
with stellar structure and evolution theory, for example.
2.4 Eclipsing Binaries
2.4.1 Orbital Information Determined from Observation
Eclipsing binaries are detected through photometric means; several thousand such systems are
known. If one takes a sequence of observations of the magnitude of the object in time, dips
in brightness can be observed at regular intervals. This is shown in > Fig. 13-5. There will
be two dips per orbital period. When the cooler star passes in front of the hotter star, this is
known as the primary eclipse and will be the deeper of the two minima in light. The secondary
eclipse occurs when the cooler star passes behind the hotter. By definition, in order to observe

Schematic of the light curve of an eclipsing binary star. The points t1 through t4, described in the
text, are shown for the deeper eclipse
an eclipse, the orbital plane must be perpendicular to the plane of the sky, or very nearly so. Pri-
mary and secondary eclipses can be either total (if the star in front is larger), annular (if the star
in front is smaller), or partial if the orbital inclination angle differs slightly from 90○. Total and
annular eclipses result in flat-bottomed minima in the light curve, while partial eclipses have
rounded bottoms. This same method is now used also in the detection of extrasolar planets.
The orbital geometry will in general determine the spacing and length of the eclipses. If we
take the case ofa circularorbit viewed edge-on, then the spacing between eclipses will be halfthe
orbital period and the length of both primary and secondary eclipse will be equal. Information
about the diameters of the two stars can then be read off of the light curve. The orbital velocity
of the circular orbit will be constant so that
a = vP
π
(13.30)
If one defines four points on the light curve as the onset of the eclipse (first contact, t), the onset
of the eclipse minimum (second contact, t), the end of the eclipse minimum (third contact, t),
and the end of the eclipse (fourth contact, t), then the radius of the smaller star will be
Rs = 
v(t−t) = 
v(t−t),
(13.31)
where v is the orbital velocity and Rs is the radius of the smaller star. Also, one may write that
the sum of the two stellar radii is given by:
Rl + Rs = 
v(t−t),
(13.32)
where Rl is the radius of the larger star. On the other hand, the orbital velocity is related to the
semimajor axis of the relative orbit as
v = πa

(13.33)

And so, the two radii can be expressed finally as

An estimate of the size of the orbit is needed to determine the radii, but if the system is also a
double-lined spectroscopicbinary, this would be available from the spectroscopicorbit solution,
or alternatively, if the system has a visual orbit and the distance is known.
2.4.2 Observational Data
There are three main catalogues of information for eclipsing binary stars. Both the General Cat-
alog of Variable Stars (GCVS, http://www.sai.msu.su/groups/cluster/gcvs/), maintained by the
Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow, Russia, and the American Association of Variable
Star Observers webpage (http://www.aavso.org/) list a large number of variable stars, including
eclipsing binaries. Recent observations may be plotted with the software tools available on these
websites. On the other hand, ephemerides of eclipsing binaries may be found at http://www.as.
up.krakow.pl/o-c/cont.html, a website maintained bythe Mt. Suhora Astronomical Observation
in Poland.
2.5 Complementary Observations
There are two important cases of complementary observations of binaries, that is, occasions
when a system is observable using more than one of the techniques discussed above. The first
case is that of a spectroscopic and eclipsing system. The fact that the system is eclipsing indicates
that the inclination angle, i, is 90○, or very nearly so. If the spectroscopic orbit is double lined,
then the true orbital velocities can be determined from (>13.25) above, and therefore the total
mass follows from ( > 13.26). The individual masses can then be obtained. Also, the absolute
dimensions of the system are completely determined: the eccentricity, the true semimajor axis,
and, from the centerofmass equation, the individual distances from the centerofmass. Further-
more, a distance to the system can at least be estimated by using the method of spectroscopic
parallax, that is, measuring the spectral type of the larger star (e.g., during eclipse when the
light from the smaller star is blocked), inferring the absolute magnitude, and the measuring
apparent magnitude of the system during eclipse of the smaller star. Surface temperatures may
also be inferred from the spectrum: the smaller star’s spectrum may be obtained by subtract-
ing that of the larger star from the composite spectrum, taken when neither star is in eclipse.
Since the light curves of the eclipses also give the relative sizes of the two stars, the relative
densities follow from the masses. The case of a single-lined spectroscopic binary with eclipses,
the mass function may be rewritten without the sini term (since the inclination is 90○), but
individual masses are still not directly determined. If one is prepared to make an assumption
about the mass of the primary based on its spectral type, then one can at least estimate the
secondary mass.
The second complementary case is that of a spectroscopic and visual binary star. Here, the
visual orbit gives the inclination angle, soagain, ifthe system is double-lined, then the individual
masses are again determined: the mass sum from the visual orbit and the mass ratio from the
spectroscopic orbit. A direct measure of the distance to the system is also obtained without

676 13
Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems
recourse to parallax or spectrum analysis since the semimajor axis is determined from both
orbits. The quantity a sin i is determined from the spectroscopic orbit, but with the inclination
provided from the visual orbit, a in absolute distance units is known, while a in angular units
comes from the visual orbit, thus the distance follows from geometry. In the case of a single-
lined system, individual masses can still be determined since the inclination angle and mass sum
can be used from the visual orbit to make the only unknown in the mass function the secondary
mass. However, the distance to the system must be determined from some other means if the
true dimensions of the orbit are desired, and the parallax uncertainty is likely to dominate the
precision possible in this case.

Basic Stellar Astrophysics with Binaries
3.1 The Mass–Luminosity Relation and Mass–Radius Relation
Since binary stars give information about the masses and radii of stars, they are an excellent
laboratory with which to test stellar structure and evolution theory. However, to be meaningful
for the understanding of stellar astrophysics, masses must be combined with other observables
such as luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity, and helium abundance. The most basic
relationship that is provided by the theory and verified with binary star observations is the
mass–luminosity relation (MLR). The current understanding of the empirical mass–luminosity
relation (MLR) begins with the study of eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries, which has yielded
excellent results for stars more massive than the Sun. However, the relation is on much less firm
ground for lower mass stars (see e.g., Andersen 1991; Henry and McCarthy 1990, 1993; Popper
1980). The classic work of Henry and McCarthy resulted in some of the best infrared speckle
data of low-mass stars on the systems that are closest to the solar system. These data are still
comprised of observations of surprisingly few systems; when limited by ground-based obser-
vations as they were, there were few systems that were both bright enough and close enough
to observe with their instrumentation. Recent improvements in the MLR have been made with
the incorporation of Hipparcos parallaxes (Martin et al. 1998; Söderhjelm 1999), and Space
Telescope results (Henry et al. 1999, Torres et al. 2010), but again these are primarily mass rede-
terminations of well-known systems. Henry et al. gave us a significantly clearer picture of the
lowest mass systems, but the range 1.0–0.2 solar masses still remains extremely uncertain. More
data are still needed to improve this portion of the diagram, especially to investigate so-called
“second parameter” effects in the MLR such as metallicity and age.
The recently published Geneva–Copenhagen spectroscopic catalog is a substantial resource
in this area, providing metallicities and some mass fractions for many F and G stars of inter-
est. For example, HDS 521 (shown in > Fig. 13-2) has [Fe/H] = −.and mass fraction
0.773 ± 0.110. From these data, as well as the orbital elements and photometry from speckle
observations, individual masses, luminosities, and colors are obtained (e.g., mass values of 0.83
and 0.76 solar masses can be obtained from the orbit in >Fig. 13-2, with uncertainties dom-
inated by parallax). Metallicity information exists in other catalogs as well including for some
giants and red dwarfs, for example, the [Fe/H] catalog of Cayrel de Strobel et al. (2001) and the
ELODIE catalog (Prugniel and Soubiran 2001).
Andersen (1991) discussed what is needed observationally before meaningful comparisons
with stellar theory can be made. Measures of mass should have uncertainties of less than 2%,

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
677
radius uncertainties, less than 1% (note that the radius can be obtained from the luminosity
via L = πRσT
eff); effective temperature uncertainties, less than 2%, and metallicity uncer-
tainty, less than 25%. With reliable speckle photometry and multiple observations, combined
with recent metallicity determinations, only the masses fall short of these criteria in many cases.
However, if the components of a binary can be placed on the H-R diagram, there can be a mean-
ingful comparison madefrom the photometry and metal abundance alone especially in the case
of at least one evolved component. Turning the problem around, one may establish preliminary
masses for a system if one has good confidence in a particular set of theoretical isochrones, that
is, the locus of points that in theoretical calculations have the same age for a range of mass, and
photometry. These could then be used to form a statistical study that correlates the masses with
other parameters.
In eclipsing-spectroscopic systems, the length of time in total or annular eclipse can be
used to obtain the radius of each star, as discussed above. This gives another opportunity to
compare directly with theoretical predictions of the size of stars as a function of mass. The
sample of systems that can be used in this way is relatively small; however, data on non-eclipsing
binaries is now possible with the current generation of long-baseline optical interferometers
discussed in >Sect. 2.2.4, which has increased the sample of M dwarfs by 50%, for example.
Observed values of the radii suggest that the current theoretical models underestimatethe radii
of low-mass stars, particularly those of higher metallicity (Berger et al. 2006).
3.2 Formation of Binary and Multiple Systems
There have been three main theories of binary formation that have been studied over the last
two decades: (1) capture, (2) prompt fragmentation, and (3) delayed breakup (Tohline 2002).
In capture, stars form as initially single, and through gravitational interactions result in bina-
ries after the fact through stellar encounters. However, if the two stars are not gravitationally
bound to begin with, then the total energy of the pair is greater than or equal to zero. There-
fore, there must be some loss of energy to create the bound orbit. For example, the encounter
might involve a third star, and through the dynamics of the situation, this third companion
might receive enough kinetic energy to reduce the total energy of the other two stars below
zero, binding them together. With the extra velocity imparted to the third star, it would soon
escape the vicinity of the new binary. Another mechanism that has been suggested is the dis-
sipation of energy through the tidal interaction between one star with the protostellar disk
of the other star (Larson 2002). However, if the relative velocity between the two approach-
ing stars is too high, then the outcome is simply the disruption of the disk as the stars pass
each other and not enough energy is removed to result in a bound orbit (Clarke and Pringle
1993).
In the prompt fragmentation picture, during or soon after the free-fall collapse of the rotat-
ing protostellar gas cloud, the cloud breaks into two pieces, transferring much of its spin angular
momentum to the orbital angular momentum of the two protostars. A free-fall collapse that
proceeds from a nearly spherical spinning gas cloud that is uniform in density is known as a
homologous collapse, while if the density is concentrated toward the center of the cloud, the
collapse is referred to as nonhomologous. Through numerical studies, it is found that homolo-
gous collapses can lead to configurations at the end of free fall collapse that are susceptible to
fragmentation, though pinning down the general conditions under which such fragmentations
to occur has been difficult to accomplish. Since many of these calculations have not continued

678 13
Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems
to the point of actual star formation, conclusions about binary formation from this method have
been somewhat indirect.
In delayed breakup or disk fragmentation models, the disk around a central object can
become unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations if the accretion rate onto the disk from
the surrounding gas cloud is high enough (Bonnell 1994). Also, the equation of state of the gas
is an important consideration, with stiffer equations of state less likely to lead to fragmentation.
Work on both prompt fragmentation and delayed breakup has been able to produce binary and
multiple systems, which leads to current thinking of fragmentation as the dominant formation
mechanism. A current incompleteness of these models however is the inability to produce close
binary systems (those with separations of less than 10 AU). This limit is imposed because the
pressure-supported core that is formed at the end of free fall collapse is stable against fragmen-
tation, and such an object has a typical size of 4 AU and mass of a few Jupiter masses. Therefore,
the formation of small separation binaries is almost certainly the result of interactions with
other stars that lead to a decrease in orbital distance.
In the last 15 years, some specific predictions of binary formation theory have emerged
that have been tested observationally. For example, some fragmentation models (e.g., Clarke
1999) predict that the properties of the secondary in a binary system should be independent
of the primary mass, while in capture models (McDonald and Clarke 1993), the higher-mass
stars have companions with greater frequency. These different predictions can be evaluated by
observing the companion star fraction (CSF) for a sample of appropriate stars. This is defined
as follows:
CSF = B + T + Q + . . .
S + B + T + Q + . . .,
(13.35)
where S is the number of single stars, B is the number of binaries, T the number of triples, Q
the number of quadruples, and so on. In general, imaging methods (including speckle interfer-
ometry) can be used to determine the CSF of a sample, if orbital motion is confirmed or may
reasonably be assumed. If orbit determinations are possible, then further statistics such as the
mass ratio distribution, the period distribution, and correlations between the orbital parameters
can be observationally determined.Spectroscopic binaries haveprovided much of this informa-
tion to date due to their generally shorter periods. If orbits are not determined, the mass-ratio
distribution can still be obtained indirectly, if the magnitude differences of the systems and the
evolutionary status of the companions are known.
Bate et al. (2003) has completed very detailed calculations of star formation in a cluster
environment. Starting with a spherical gas cloud with density fluctuations built in, the simula-
tions allow for the concurrent collapse of many different subregions. (These simulations can be
viewed from http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/.) As the calculation proceeds, one finds
that the density fluctuations evolve into high-density filaments along which stars begin to form.
As they form, the stars interact gravitationally, leading to phenomena such as the disruption of
circumstellar disks, the formation of binary systems with a ring of circumbinary material, and
so on. Bate et al. finds that the CSF produced by his simulation is in agreement with that deter-
mined observationally for young clusters, though the statistics are quite low. This work firmly
establishes the fact that binary formation is a natural channel of star formation, perhaps even
the dominant channel.
Speckle interferometry has been a useful method for examining the CSF in young clus-
ters and star-forming regions. In this case, all stars in the sample may be thought of as coeval,
having the same metallicity, and equidistant from the solar system. The same studies that gave
information about H-R diagram position of pre-main sequence components in the early 1990s

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
679
(Ghez et al. 1993, 1997; Leinert et al. 1993), as well as optical speckle interferometry was also
used to determine binary statistics. The Space Telescope fine guidance sensors have also been
used in the study of cluster binaries (e.g., Franz et al. 1992), where the ages are well known. These
studies have generally shown that young stars have a very high CSF, statistically consistent with
the proposition that the majority of stars form in multiple systems.
More recent work by Patience et al. (1998) has given a significantly clearer picture of the
CSF and mass-ratio distribution in the Hyades cluster, allowing for a meaningful comparison
of theory and observation. In particular, they ruled out capture and disk-assisted capture as
primary mechanisms of binary formation on the basis of mass-ratio statistics of the cluster
binaries. This and other studies point to fragmentation as the primary mechanism of binary
formation. It is not fair to say that there is universal agreement on this issue, since, e.g., Abt and
Willmarth (1999) have published spectroscopic results, indicating evidence for capture as the
primary binary formation mechanism in some open clusters.
3.3 The Algol Paradox
Although capture of a companion is one way in which a binary system can be formed in theory,
current work suggests that in most cases the two stars in the system were formed at the same
time and have been gravitationally bound since that time. Therefore, at least in most binary
systems, the components should have the same age. This hypothesis can be checked if enough
information is known to place the two stars on the H-R diagram. When this was first done for
the Algol system (β Persei), it was found that the less massive star had evolved off of the main
sequence, while the more massive star was still unevolved.Since stellar structure theory predicts
that the time spend on the main sequence is proportional to m−.where m is the star’s mass,
this situation seems paradoxical at first.
The generally accepted solution to this dilemma is that the two components form an interac-
tive system where the star that was originally more massive has donated mass to the less massive
component so that over time the masses have reversed. In this picture, the star that was more
massive evolved off the main sequence, but in doing so became much larger in size. Because
of the presence of a relatively close companion, the surface of the evolved star can become dis-
torted, and some material can be pulled toward the companion, adding to its mass. Over a long
time scale (∼10years), enough material can be exchanged to result in a lower mass for the
evolved star than the companion.
3.4 Other Tests of Stellar Evolution
A small number of very detailed comparisons between stellar models and observational data
exist; often these studies focus on one or a few systems which have been observed with multiple
technique. A recent example is the work of Torres and his collaborators on Capella (α Aurigae)
(Torres et al. 2009). Capella is an example of a spectroscopic and visual binary, although the
separation of the system can only be precisely measured with interferometric techniques. By
virtue of both a spectroscopic and visual orbit, it is possible to obtain individual masses and a
distance to the system. Both stars in the system have evolved off of the main sequence, making
the system a particularly interesting test of stellarstructure and evolution models,since the evo-
lution is presumably proceeding quite rapidly for both stars. Torres et al. present an exhaustive

680 13
Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems
analysis of all of the data taken of the system over a 100-year time frame, leading to fractional
uncertainties in the masses of 0.7% and 0.5% for the two stars. They find that it is not possi-
ble to match the H-R diagram positions with the derived properties of the two stars with any
of three different stellar evolution calculations of leading theoretical groups. This discrepancy
is both exciting and perplexing: there are few systems that allow such high precision in the
masses and other physical parameters to be determined, but no solution so far exists to explain
the discrepancies between theory and observation in this case.
While high-precision studies are extremely valuable for the comparison with stellar evolu-
tion calculations, there is also a need for studies that span a meaningful range in parameters
such as metallicity, helium abundance, and so on. Because of the distribution of Population I
and Population II stars in the Galaxy, obtaining a meaningful sample of lower-metallicity sys-
tems necessitates looking at targets that are more distant and therefore necessarily fainter on
average. Often, these systems are beyond the capabilities of the long-baseline optical interfer-
ometers. Thus, one must ask what progress can be made with lower-resolution techniques that
can successfully be used to observe these fainter targets.
As discussedearlier, the most widely used technique for visual binary star observations over
the last 30–40 years has been speckle interferometry due to its relative ease of use and efficiency
(i.e., the ability to observe 200 or more objects per night). However, one of the main limitations
of the method through most of its use has been the difficulty in obtaining good quality magni-
tude differences from the data. This is due to a combination of factors, including nonlinearities
associated with the detectors that have commonly been used as well as atmospheric effects. In
the last decade, these effects have been studied and overcome by some observers, leading to
magnitude and color information for the components of many binary systems. Combining this
information with total magnitudes and colors available from normal photometric surveys, the
components can then be placed on the H-R diagram. An example of this type of work can be
found in Davidson et al. (2009). Masses of the components can be derived by fitting a theoret-
ical isochrone to the two points. In systems with known masses from orbit calculations, this
method can be used to compare the photometrically determined values with the dynamical
ones, which in principle places constraints on the theoretical models. (It would be assumed
in this case that the system is coeval.) In systems with no previous mass determinations, the
method could be used to predict mass values; it would not be necessary to wait for orbital deter-
minations, although here one is relying on the correctness of the stellar modelsthat generatethe
isochrones. Davidson et al. found that the photometric masses were consistent with the dynami-
cal massesand generally had much lower uncertainties. As a way to obtain much more complete
mass information for a large sample of close visual binaries, speckle photometry would appear
to show significant promise.

Statistics of Binaries and Implications
4.1 The Field Population
Current knowledge of the field population in the solar neighborhood has been primarily deter-
mined through spectroscopic means. Abt and Levy (1976) pointed out that binary and multiple
stars systems are more common than single stars, a conclusion which has been confirmed by
Duquennoyand Mayor(1991)in theirdistance-limited sample ofsolar-type stars. Asubsequent

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
681
update (Udry et al. 1998) more than doubles the number of orbits in the 1991 paper. However,
the field CSF seems to be below that measuredin the star-forming regions, leading to the notion
that many stars in the field population have been stripped of their companions. Mason et al.
(1998) compared chromospherically active and non-active stars in the field via speckle inter-
ferometry to gain further insight on the CSF as a function of age. They found that the active
(and presumably younger) stars have a higher CSF than the non-active stars. On the other hand,
Duchêne (1999) reanalyzed some of the previous studies of star-forming regions and concluded
that some regions do not have binary excesses. Thus, while there has been an evolving discus-
sion in the field in recent years, there is no firm consensus yet on what the basic properties of
the binary population tell us about formation scenarios.
Duquennoy and Mayor (1991) found that solar type stars have a period distribution that
is given by a log-normal function with average period of approximately 180 years. However,
others have argued that, at least for wider separations, that is, periods much larger than 180
years, the observed distribution follows the Õpik relation (1927), a scale-independent law with
decreasing frequency at larger separations. However, observational data on wide binaries is far
from complete. Often, they are identified only as pairs with common proper motion, as sug-
gested by Luyten (1927), but due to the timescale of the orbit implied, one does not have orbital
elements to confirm binarity or have a firm idea concerning the orbital period. Nonetheless,
several thousand binaries identified in this way have been catalogued (Luyten 1997). Another
important feature of the spectroscopic results of Duquennoy and Mayor and others is the
period–eccentricity relation. For short-period systems (less than about 10 days), virtually all
systems observed have near-zero eccentricity. However, for larger periods, the eccentricity dis-
tribution is essentially random, ranging from 0 to 1. This is explained by tidal interactions
between the stars since, in a short-period eccentric system, the two stars could come quite close
together at the point of closest approach. The creation of the tidal bulges dissipates energy in
the system, leading to a more and more circular orbit over time.
The Hipparcos mission and subsequent release of the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997),
substantially improved parallaxes of stars within a couple of 100 pc of the Sun. Hipparcos par-
allaxes have typical uncertainties in the range of two to five times smaller than ground-based
parallax results (i.e., from 1 to 2 milliarcseconds [mas]). This was an extremelyimportant devel-
opment for visual binary star astronomy, but as impressive as this achievement is, the dominant
source of mass uncertainty remains the parallax for most speckle binaries. Take, for example,
the well-known binary BU 151 (HIP 101769) has Hipparcos parallax of 33.49 ± 0.88 mas, and
the most precise orbital parameters are those of Hartkopf (1998), where a = .± .mas
and P = .± .years. The fractional errors in the observed quantities are therefore
δa/a = ., δπ/π = ., and δ P/P = .. The parallax error is nearly a factor of
20 larger than the other two contributors, even for this system which is only 30 pc from the sun,
and even post-Hipparcos.
The real solution to this situation in this and many other cases is the Gaia satellite mission
to be launched in the coming years. This mission plan includes determination of parallaxes to
∼20 microarcseconds (μas) for stars brighter than 15th magnitude, or in other words, roughly
50–100 times smaller than Hipparcos. In the case of many resolvable binaries, the parallax
uncertainty will then be comparable to or less than that of the semimajor axis. For BU 151AB,
the fractional error in parallax using an estimate of δπ/π = μ as becomes 0.00060, and
the overall error budget from the three observables would be less than 0.5%, approximately
ten times better than the current value (using the Hipparcos parallax) of 4.6%. This exercise
demonstrates the importance of space-based astrometry in unlocking the power of the speckle

binaries for astrophysics, and there are dozens of other bright, well-known systems awaiting
this kind of revision. In addition to the speckle binaries, Hipparcos discovered some 3,400 new
double-star systems (the Hipparcos Double Stars, or HDSs), and there has been a push by the
major speckle groups to observe and characterize these and other recently discovered systems.
Orbits derived from speckle astrometry have already been determined in ∼20 cases (Balega et al.
2002, 2005, 2006; Cvetkovi 2008; Horch et al. 2010; Söderhjelm 1999). This already represents
∼40 new points on the MLR, and there is at least some range in metallicity represented. With
a few more years of observing, this number will substantially increase. This work represents a
large addition to the speckle binary sample, and binary star observers continue to take data on
these systems in order to have the best possible orbital elements ready when Gaia parallaxes
become available.
However, the sample of speckle binaries with the best quality orbital elements (say, those
with uncertainty in semimajor axis of less than 1%) consists mainly of systems within about
100 pc and is limited to mainly main sequence systems with composite spectral types earlier
than K0 and a narrow range of [Fe/H] near the solar value. Over 1,100 of the Hipparcos dis-
coveries are within 250 pc, dozens of which are now known to be gravitationally bound with
reasonably short periods (a few decades or less) and again consist of mainly main sequence sys-
tems (though many more are lower down the main sequence). An H-R diagram of these two
samples is shown in >Fig. 13-6. In cases where the metallicity is known, evolutionary studies
such as discussed earlier where the components of the system on the H-R diagram can be done
with very good speckle photometry, though precise ages will not be possible in cases where
neither component is evolved.
4.2 Pre-main Sequence Binaries
During the 1990s, many binaries were discovered in nearby star-forming regions, with both
high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic methods, and statistical studies of these systems
were completed (Ghez et al. 1993; Leinert et al. 1993; Mathieu 1989). The high-resolution imag-
ing studies mentioned were completed using speckle interferometry with infrared arrays, which
had just become available in sufficiently large formats for such work. Taken together, these stud-
ies indicate that the frequency of pre-main sequence binaries is at least as high, and perhaps
significantly higher, than the field population of binaries. When sufficient photometric infor-
mation exists to place the components of pre-main sequence binaries discovered on the H-R
diagram, it is found that components of these systems populate the entire region of the diagram
where single pre-main sequence stars are located, and this is read as an indication that the for-
mation of the system as a binary occurs well before the final descent to the main sequence from
higher luminosities.
Several other features of these systems are worthy of note. Pre-main sequence binaries
appear similar to the field population in terms of the orbital characteristics. For example,
the shortest period systems generally have only low eccentricities, whereas longer-period sys-
tems span the range of eccentricity from 0 to near 1. These systems also appear to follow the
same log-normal distribution of periods as the field population, with a comparable median
period. (Duquennoy and Mayor (1991) state 180 years as the median period for solar-type field
binaries.) For large separation systems, there is a wide range of secondary masses, with a dis-
tribution that appears similar to the initial mass function. Finally, multiple systems are found
with approximately the same frequency (or greater) than the field, and the hierarchical nature
of most of these systems is also already established.

Pre-main sequence systems however also have some significant differences with the field
population. The most important example of this is that a large fraction of pre-main sequence
systems appear to have either circumstellar or circumbinary disks, as judged from 2 to 10 μm
flux excess, and there is evidence for mass accretion in some pre-main sequence systems from
X-ray observations. If the pre-main sequence frequency of binaries and multiple stars is higher
than the field, then this indicates that there is a mechanism for loss of companions, probably
through dynamical encounters with other stars. However, such encounters would likely change
the average of the period distribution, hardening the remaining systems, which is not clearly
observed (Mathieu 1994).
4.3 Thin- and Thick-Disk Binaries
Allen et al. (2000) have compiled a catalog of 122 common proper motion companions of high-
velocity stars, i.e., the systems are presumably wide but physically bound binaries. While the
distribution of separations appears to generally follow the so-called Õpik relation at the large
separation end in the sense that for wide binaries, interactions with other stars tend to enlarge
the separation over time, there appeared to be more small-separation binaries in a sample they
judged to belong to a more disk-like population, though the statistics in this region of their plots
was low. As the same authors previously noted (Allen et al. 1997), there may be an important
transition in binary formation mechanisms at separations of ∼25 AU. Thus, in the small sepa-
ration end of their later work, a difference in terms of the disk-like and halo-like populations
remains interesting and worthy of further study.
Zinnecker and his collaborators have investigated a possible difference between the average
separations of Population I and Population II binaries based on adaptive optics observations
(Zinnecker et al. 2004). More recently, Abt (2008) has published an analysis of spectroscopic
data, indicating that there are not as many short-period spectroscopic binaries of low metallicity
as there are in metal-rich systems. This may be the result of differences in formation (e.g., more
turbulent clouds in the early galaxy), while on the other hand the star formation process could
be essentially static over the history of the galaxy (consistent with the work of Larson, e.g., 2001,
2002), and any differences between the two populations of binaries would be more likely be due
to post-formation environment and age.
Differentiating the thin- and thick-disk samples is important not only for resolving that
question but also for establishing the correlation in the MLR in the metallicity range −1.0 to
+0.3 and mass range 0.08–2.0 solar masses. Because of previous difficulties with speckle pho-
tometry, the component magnitudes are generally not well known, but metallicities are now in
the literature for many speckle binaries with existing orbits. Although in most cases these stars
have composite spectral types in the F and G range, there will be many examples where the
secondary is in the subsolar mass range, even if the primary is not. Modern speckle cameras
can provide the effective temperatures and luminosities that will finally allow the use of these
systems in astrophysical studies.
The nature of the “transition region” at 25 AU observed at sub-arcsecond separations by
Allen et al. is not clear at present. It could indicate a difference in star formation mechanisms,
but it is not known if it is seen for different age populations. However, this separation com-
pares extremely well to the typical separations of the HDSs, where the sample of interest has
apparent separations in the range of 0.1–1.0 arcsec and distances of typically 25–250 pc. They
therefore span a range of 2.5–250 AU in their physical separations, and are ideal to follow up on

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
685
the previous work regarding binary formation mechanisms. With the next few years, modern
instrumentation can be expected to push well through this transition region, down to a few AU
at a distance of 250 pc.
Environment may be a sizeable effect in explaining the result of Zinnecker et al. It is well
known that wide binaries become wider through stellar encounters. The most detailed study to
date is that of Weinberg et al. (1987), where calculations were performed assuming a radially
symmetric distribution of perturbers. It is not known in detail how this might be affected in a
nonradially symmetric distribution (such as the galactic disk) over time, but it is possible that
tidal effects in the galactic potential can become large enough in some cases to dramatically
increase binary separations over time. This is not likely to be strong enough in the thick disk to
explain a large difference between high- and low-metallicity samples. More work is warranted,
but formation would seem to be more likely to be the dominant effect in the distribution of
orbital parameters at this point.
Nonetheless, binaries may also eventually provide clues to understanding the structure and
mass distribution within the Galactic disk. Knowledge of the mass distribution and the vol-
ume density of gravitating matter would yield information about the nature of the dark matter
component in the solar neighborhood, which is of principal importance in understanding the
structure of the Milky Way on larger scales, e.g., flattening of the Milky Way halo. The separa-
tion histogram could give an independent estimate of the dark matter mass density if it can be
accurately measured and disentangled in terms of formation and galactic structure effects.
There are two different approaches in determining the mass density of the solar neighbor-
hood. The first approach determines the local volume density or Oort’s limit, while the other
approach measures the integral surface density of the disk (Kuijken and Gilmore 1989a, b, c).
Both types of experiments are based on the kinematic properties together with the determina-
tion of the distribution of a “test” population of stars perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Siegel
et al. (2002) have already pointed out the importance of determining the effect of binaries in
these kinds of studies. The unresolved binaries manifest themselves in two observational effects:
(1) They increase the apparent luminosity of a “star” and (2) They affect the apparent color. The
binary correction is therefore extremely important in estimating the photometric distances and
in determining the correct density law. Usually, the field binary fraction is assumed to be near
50%, as determined in G dwarf spectroscopic binaries discussed in > Sect. 2.3, but there is
a controversy about the binary fraction for halo and thick-disk stars and whether the binary
fraction changes with spectral type (Lada 2006). Clarification of these issues is important in the
dynamical studies of the density distribution in the galactic disk.
Dynamical studies of the galactic disk based on stellar parallax measurements usually suf-
fer from the lack of knowledge about binarity. Unresolved binaries affect the measurements of
radial velocities of these objects and thus lead to an overestimate of the velocity dispersion of
the samples. This effect has not been studied in the literature; one must be aware of the potential
for observational biases in such statistical studies.
4.4 Binary Stars in Clusters
Binary stars can be used as probes of the cluster environment in several ways. First, if orbital
information can be determined for spectroscopic/visual or eclipsing/spectroscopic binaries,
then an independent measure of the distance to the system can be obtained. Binaries have been
studied in several open clusters where it is found that they concentrate toward the center of the

686 13
Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems
cluster. This can be explained by the higher mass of these objects compared with single stars.
The orbital parameters of binaries are also thought to be affected by the gravitational potential
in clusters. In general, if a system is below a certain separation (∼30 AU), then the encounters
with other stars will lead to a decrease in the separation with time. This is said to be a “hard-
ening” of the binary system. Above the same limit, the separation will increase with time or
“soften,” until such time as the system has dispersed.
The basic mechanism for binary star formation is fragmentation with subsequent gravi-
tational interactions in the cluster environment, as discussed earlier. However, the evidence
suggests that the formation of stable multiple star systems is the result of dynamical interac-
tions (Aarseth 2004). Mathematical models of binary–binary interactions show that a typical
formation process for a triple star system is process where, in the wider binary, one component
is ejected and the other component becomes bound to the harder binary. A variation on this
process is that two binaries interact after which two single stars are ejected leaving a binary with
altered orbital parameters. In both cases, the original hard binary will have its orbital parame-
ters affected, and velocities of the final products of the interaction can be quite high. In some
cases, the hard binary or triple can leave the cluster environment in which it is formed. Sterzik
and Tokovinin (2002) have compared observed triple star statistics with the results of model
calculations and found reasonable agreement in physical parameters of such systems. In partic-
ular, a weak co-alignment of orbital planes was predicted from the cluster simulations, which
is in fact observed in the field population of triple stars.
In globular clusters, it appears from recent research that rich globular clusters retain a much
larger fraction of neutron stars than one would expect from dynamical calculations (Pfahl
et al. 2002a). When they form, neutron stars are thought to have very high speeds, in excess
of 200 km/s, which is far in excess of the escape speed of a typical globular cluster. Such high
speeds are known as neutron star kicks. Such kicks are observed in the field population of neu-
tron stars in the form of high proper motions. A possible explanation of the high retention rate
is that neutron stars with a massive companion are preferentially retained. In this case, the com-
panion is large enough to survive the formation of the neutron star and can in theory reduce
the kick enough so that the system is retained by the cluster.

Interacting Binaries
5.1 General Comments on Interacting Binaries
Interacting binaries are defined by the proximity of the two stars. If they are close enough to
affect the physical properties of the two stars, then they are considered interacting. As the sep-
aration of a particular pair of stars is decreased, there will be a point at which the surfaces of
the two stars start to deform. The tidal bulges produced will first start to dissipate the rotational
rates of the stars, and eventually they will rotate with the same period as that of the orbit of the
system. If the eccentricity of the orbit is high enough, then the tidal forces will also be periodic,
leading to pulsation of the stars. These in turn can dissipate orbital energy from the system, but
without significant loss of angular momentum (Swihart 1992). It can easily be shown that at
constant angular momentum, the lowest energy configuration is that of a circular orbit. Thus,

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
687
it is expected (and the observations also confirm) that close binaries have orbital eccentricity
zero and rotate synchronously with the orbit.
If one considers a small amount of material near the surface of the more massive star in a
binary system, then it will not be found far from the star despite any orbital influence on it by the
second star in the system, provided that the velocity of this material is small. In general, there
will be a surface enclosing the massive star inside of which the material must be contained. This
is the so-called zero-velocity surface: in order to reach a point on this surface, the material must
lose all of its velocity. A similar surface would exist surrounding the second star, and the average
distance from the star to the zero-velocity surface will of course depend on the velocity of the
material. If the velocity is high enough and/or the stars are close enough, the two zero-velocity
surfaces begin to overlap, meaning that there is a pathway where material can pass from within
the zero-velocity surface of one star into the zero-velocity surface of the other, even though it is
still bound to the binary system as a whole. If the two surfaces just touch each other in a single
point, this point is the Lagrangian point L, the point at which the material would feel equal
and opposite gravitational pull from both stars. The zero-velocity surfaces of the two stars in
this special case are known as the Roche lobes of each star.
For larger separations, the Roche lobes are nearly spherical, but when the separation
becomes small, then the surfaces become distorted. By considering the balance of forces in
the rotating frame of the system, it can be shown that the surface of the star itself must take
on the same shape as the Roche lobe, albeit smaller in size in general. If the stars are on the
main sequence and do not have substantial stellar winds, then there is no significant transfer of
material in the system, although the evolution can be affected by the distortion in shape. How-
ever, once the more massive star leaves the main sequence, it expands significantly on its way
to becoming a red giant. As the star fills its Roche lobe, material near the Lagrangian Lwill
pass into the Roche lobe of the secondary star, and subsequently be attracted to the secondary
star over time. Since the rate of expansion of the primary star is slow compared to the free-fall
timescale of the material, once it is within the Roche lobe of the secondary it is not expected that
the primary star would overfill its Roche lobe significantly. There is also a natural equilibrium
that sets in because the more the star expands beyond its Roche lobe, the greater the overlap of
the two lobes, and the faster the rate of mass infall to the secondary star.
Later on in the evolution of the system, the evolved star may become a white dwarf or neu-
tron star, while the star that was on the main sequence will evolve to the giant branch and may
fill its Roche lobe, thereby donating material back to the other star. If this is the configuration,
then there is a key difference from the case considered just above: the star receiving the mat-
ter is now a very compact object so that much of the incoming material will not immediately
fall onto the surface, but rather will begin to circle the compact component. Over time, this
will create a disk. As new material drops onto the disk, it creates a hotspot through the colli-
sions, which is over time transferred throughout the disk. Therefore, the disk can have a very
high temperature and luminosity, contributing significantly to the energy output of the binary
system.
If the compact companion is a neutron star instead of a white dwarf, then the higher mass
means that the infalling material will be traveling with much higher velocities when it hits the
accretion disk. In addition, many neutron stars have strong magnetic fields. The result is that
charged particles will be funneled onto the magnetic poles of the star at high energy, creating
X-rays. If the spin axis and magnetic axis have different orientations, then what will be observed
is a pulsed X-ray signature as the neutron star rotates.

5.2 Important Types of Interacting Binaries
5.2.1 Type Ia Supernovae
The main characteristic that places a supernova in the Type I category is the lack of hydro-
gen lines in the spectrum of the object. Other spectral features change with time, but the most
prominent features include absorption lines of singly-ionized metals that are heavily Doppler
broadened and blueshifted. Forexample, the CaII doublet near393.4–396.8nm can be sobroad-
ened that it appears as a single feature that is blueshifted by 20.0 nm. This is evidence that the
material is expanding out from the explosion and is traveling at 10,000–15,000km/s.
In general, the light curve and spectral characteristics of Type Ia supernovae are quite uni-
form. The peak light is reached 10–20 days after the initial event, and after peak light, the curve
decays rapidly for the first 100 days, then more gradually. Peak luminosity of these events is
on the order of ergs, which corresponds to an absolute visual magnitude of approximately
−.. The total energy release over time is estimated to be 10ergs. The rate of occurrence of
Type Ia supernovae in spiral galaxies is approximately 1 per 36 years, and is thought to be less
concentrated in the spiral arms of such galaxies than Type II supernovae.
The standard model of Type Ia supernovae is the carbon deflagration of a white dwarf.
Although there are several variations along this line, the basic picture is that of a white dwarf star
that exists in a semidetached binary system. The white dwarf has a degenerate carbon-oxygen
core and accretes matter from its companion. It grows in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit, and
carbon burning is initiated in the core. Since the mass represented by the Chandrasekhar limit
is well-known, approximately 1.3 solar masses, the energy released in the explosion, should be
essentiallythe same foreverysuch event. Theymaytherefore be thought ofas “standard candles”
and used as distance indicators to external galaxies.
White dwarfs in binary systems also can explain cataclysmic variables, that is, stars with
irregular, large increases in brightness that occur without regular pattern in time. As more
hydrogen accumulates near the surface of the white dwarf, temperatures and densities may
be high enough to briefly initiate hydrogen fusion in episodic fashion, leading to a dramatic
increase in light from the system.
5.2.2 X-Ray Binaries
If the companion star in a semidetached binary system is a neutron star or black hole, then the
system forms an X-ray binary. Observationally, these systems will appear as unresolved stars or
single-lined spectroscopic binaries and usually are described by the mass of the system: high-
, intermediate-, and low-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB, IMXB, and LMXB, respectively). In all
three cases, the X-rays are produced as matter from the luminous companion falls onto the
disk of the compact companion, but the evolutionary phase of the companion star determines
the mechanism of the infall. When the companion is on or near the main sequence, it will not
fill its Roche lobe, and material from the stellar surface cannot be directly accreted onto the
compact companion. Instead, it is provided by a stellar wind. This is a relatively long-lived and
low-mass accretion, where the system is observed as a low-luminosity, hard (1–10 keV) X-ray
source (Pfahl et al. 2002b).
Later on, in the evolution of the companion star, it will become a red giant, and eventually fill
its Roche lobe. This initiates masstransfer through the Lagrange point L, which is a much faster

Binaries and Multiple Stellar Systems 13
689
and short-lived process. In this case, an accretion disk will form around the compact star, and
the X-ray spectrum will be more luminous but softer. Since high-mass stars evolve much more
quickly than low mass stars, it is thought that many sources of this type are LMXBs. In contrast,
not only are evolved HMXBs short-lived, but a HMXB where the companion is a giant can
accrete matter at a rate that generates a luminosity close to the Eddington limit, and so material
can actually be blown away from the binary system in this way, disrupting the system over time.
In general, the details of the evolution can be complicated by the mass transfer so that current
theories predict a wide range of X-ray spectra, depending on the mass of the companion star.
5.2.3 Blue Stragglers
In many star clusters, the H-R diagram, shows a well-defined population of giants and other
evolved stars that joins the main sequence at the point known as the turnoff. The pattern is
explained very easily since the cluster formed at one time and all the stars in it have the same age,
regardless of mass. Therefore, the cluster H-R diagram follows an isochrone. The turnoff point
effectively determines the age of the cluster. In the observed H-R diagrams of dense clusters,
particularly globular clusters, there are stars that appear to be on the main sequence but above
the turnoff point. These are known as blue stragglers. In some cases, the masses of these stars
are thought to be nearly twice the turnoff mass, and there are even examples where the object
is apparently above twice the turnoff mass (Shara et al. 1997).
Since these stars are bluer and hotter than other stars on the main sequence, they should
have already evolved off of the main sequence if their evolution proceeded in the normal way.
The idea that these stars are formed from merger events between stars has become the leading
theory to explain this phenomenon. These mergers may be formed from direct stellar collisions
or from orbital decay of a close binary system. The rate of the former has been calculated to be
low except in the cores ofthe densest clusters, but the lattermayhappen when a small-separation
binary is involved with an encounter with a single perturbing star or as the result of multiple
encounters in the cluster environment. Factors such as the density of stars, velocity dispersion,
mass function of the cluster, and the binary fraction all affect the details of the theoretical studies
that have been done to date (Lombardi et al. 2002).

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts 14
695
Abstract:
Supernovae are explosions of stars which are triggered either by the implosion
of the core of a star or a thermonuclear runaway, causing a bright optical display lasting for
weeks to years. This chapter first explains the main explosion types, how they are classified,
and the principles that determine their lightcurves. It then discusses in more detail some of
the most important supernova types, specifically SN 1987A, the last naked-eye supernova near
our own Galaxy, Type Ia supernovae that have been used as standardizable cosmological dis-
tance candles, and gamma-ray bursts and their related supernovae. Special emphasis is given to
the link of the various supernova types to their progenitor systems and a discussion of any
outstanding issues. Causes for the large diversity of supernova types and subtypes are then
systematically explored: these include binarity, the explosion mechanisms, rotation, metal-
licity, and dynamical effects. Finally, some of the major topics of current interest are briefly
discussed.

Introduction
Broadly speaking, a supernova is the explosion of a star or stellar system. It derives its name
from a combination of the words nova, referring to a “new” star suddenly appearing in the sky,
and super denoting a particularly bright “new” star. Novae and supernovae have been observed
and described as important cosmic events for at least a few thousand years; the first recorded
by the Chinese was SN 189 which occurred in 189 AD. The fact that novae and supernovae
represent different physical phenomena was realized only in the 1930s by Baade and Zwicky
(1934).1 That these might involve the final collapse of the core of a massive star to a neutron
star was proposed soon thereafter by Gamow and Schoenberg (1941), but it took until 1987 and
the occurrence of supernova 1987A (SN 1987A) that this was finally confirmed observationally
for at least one of the main supernova types.2 We now know that there are at least two major
mechanisms producing a supernova, although in recent years with the discoveries of hundreds
of new supernovae, it has become clear that there is an enormous diversity of supernova types
and subtypes; there are almost certainly more than just two explosion mechanisms. In this chap-
ter, we will first discuss the two major explosion mechanisms, the classical classification scheme
and how a lot of the observed diversity can be understood relatively simply by variations of the
envelope properties of the exploding stars. We will then discuss SN 1987A in some detail, the
last naked-eye supernova which has been one of the major astronomical events of the 1980s
and which has provided a major impetus in the supernova field, and the class of Type Ia super-
novae, which 10 years later provided the first evidence for an accelerating universe. Gamma-ray
bursts and related hypernovae, some of the largest explosions in the universe, are the topic of
the next section. This is followed by an overview over the various physical reasons that cause the
observed diversity, and the chapter ends with a number of selected topics of particular current
interest.
1Unlike supernovae that generally involve the whole star in the explosion, novae are now understood to be
thermonuclear explosions in the envelopes of white dwarfs.
2Traditionally, supernovae are named after the year and the order in the year in which the supernova was
reported; therefore, SN 1987A was the first supernova that was reported in 1987. Today, with the discovery of
hundreds of supernovae per year, not all supernovae are named based on this convention.

Major Explosion Mechanisms
For at least a few decades, it has been realized that there are (at least) two main supernova
explosion mechanisms: core-collapse supernovae involving the final phase in the evolution of a
massive star and thermonuclear explosions, most likely related to white dwarfs approaching the
Chandrasekhar limit (>Fig. 14-1).3
2.1 Core-Collapse Supernovae
The evolution of stars and, in particular, massive stars is characterized by an alternation of
nuclear burning phases and contraction phases. For example, the Sun is presently burning
hydrogen in its core at a temperature of ∼K. After it has consumed all of its hydrogen in
the core, the core will start to contract and heat up until ultimately helium will ignite (at a char-
acteristic temperature of ∼K). After helium burning, this cycle terminates for the Sun, as it
developes a degenerate carbon/oxygen (CO) core and ends its evolution as a CO white dwarf.
For significantly more massive stars (M ≳M⊙), the alternation of contraction and burning
phases continues until ultimately the star has developed an iron core, surrounded by an onion-
like structure consisting of shells of increasingly lower mean-atomic mass. Since iron is the most
stable nucleus (i.e., has the highest nuclear binding energy per baryon), no more energy can be
generated by fusing iron with other nuclei. Therefore, if the core exceeds the Chandrasekhar
mass for iron, there is no longer a cold hydrostatic equilibrium configuration, and the core has
to contract/collapse as it cools and loses its thermal-pressure support. While this contraction

be supported by electron degeneracty pressure. For typical white dwarf compositions, this mass is close to
1.4 M⊙.

may start slowly, it soon accelerate because of a number of instabilities. At the end of silicon
burning, the final nuclear burning phase producing the iron core, the central temperature and
density of the core, Tc and ρc, are ∼× K and ∼× kg m−, respectively. Once the core
has contracted enough and reaches a temperature Tc ∼K, the iron and other heavy nuclei
start to be photodissociated into α particles (He) and neutrons:
γ + Fe ⇌α + n −MeV.
(14.1)
This photodissociation involves endothermic reactions that require energy (124 MeV); as a con-
sequence, the temperature increases less rapidly than pressure, accelerating the contraction. At
a slightly higher temperature (Tc ∼×K), the α particles themselves are photodisintegrated
into protons and neutrons:
γ + He ⇌p + n −MeV.
The maximization of entropy favors the right-hand sides (because of the larger number of par-
ticles); in the final state of statistical equilibrium, the core will consist mainly of protons and
neutrons. Note also that these reactions undo all of the nuclear fusion reactions of the previ-
ous nuclear burning phases. This is possible since the gravitational energy that is released in
this phase corresponds to roughly 10 % of the rest-mass energy of the core (∼× J), which
exceeds the total efficiency of nuclear burning from H to Fe by more than a factor of 10. In addi-
tion to these reactions, the material becomes increasingly neutron rich (core neutronization)
due to electron captures such as
e−+ (Z, A) →νe + (Z −, A),
e−+ p →νe + n,
where Z and A refer to the charge and atomic number of a nucleus. Since these reactions take
away electrons that provide an important pressure support, this further accelerates the contrac-
tion, helping to turn the initial contraction rapidly into a free-fall collapse. Most of the energy
that is released in the collapse is ultimately converted into neutrinos (by the electron-capture
processes listed above and other thermal neutrino processes), which freely escape from the core,
at least initially.
This collapse is only stopped once matter reaches nuclear densities (ρnuc) and the strong
force becomes important, providing a sudden repulsive force. Because of the initial overcom-
pression of the matter, now mainly composed of neutrons, the core bounces and drives an
outward moving shock into the still infalling outer core. It was once hoped that this shock,
which initially carries an energy of ∼J could reverse the infall of the outer core and cause
an outflow, i.e., drive a prompt explosion. But because of the continued photodisintegration of
the infalling material, which requires ∼J for .M⊙of Fe, this energy is quickly consumed;
a prompt shock is always found to stall and is unable to drive an explosion.
The total energy that is released in the collapse is of order the binding energy of the neu-
tron star forming at the center (GM
NS/RNS ∼× J ≃.MNScfor MNS ≃.M⊙
and RNS ≃km). This is several orders of magnitude more than the binding energy of the
outer core (Ecore ≃J). However, most of this energy escapes freely in the form of neutri-
nos that only interact weakly with matter. It has remained one of the most enduring unsolved
problems in supernova physics, how a fraction (∼%) of this energy can be deposited just
below the accretion shock and be allowed to accumulate till enough energy is available to
drive an explosion. In the presently favored model of delayed neutrino-driven explosions, this
may require more than 500 ms, which is extremely long compared to the dynamical timescale

698 14

of the proto-neutron star (∼ms). If this mechanism fails, matter will continue to fall onto the
proto-neutron star and ultimately convert it into a black hole.4
2.2 Thermonuclear Explosions
The second important explosion mechanism has nothing to do with massive stars but is
generally believed to occur in accreting CO white dwarfs when their mass approaches the Chan-
drasekhar mass. When the mass reaches ∼.M⊙, carbon is ignited in or near the center of the
white dwarf. Initially, this drives convection in the core, transporting the energy outward and
radiating it away in the form of neutrinos (this phase of low-level carbon burning, referred to
as the simmering phase, can last for up to ∼year). But, there comes a point when the core
is unable to rid itself of the excess nuclear energy, and the burning process becomes explosive.
The reason for this nuclear runaway is that the core material is highly degenerate. This means
that the core pressure is independent of temperature. Therefore, a rise in central temperature
(due to the carbon burning) does not produce an increase in pressure which would limit the
increase in temperature (the valve mechanism that keeps burning in ordinary stars, supported
by thermal pressure, stable). The further increase in temperature increases the nuclear burning
further, producing a runaway process which incinerates a large fraction of the white dwarf and
ultimately destroys it completely. In the case of a thermonuclear explosion unlike the case of
core collapse, no remnant is expected, and the energy source is purely nuclear energy (∼J).
The fact that the energy in the two types of explosion is comparable (∼J) is not a coinci-
dence, since, in both cases, the energy scale is set by the binding energy of the core (the CO core
in the case of the thermonuclear explosion, and the binding energy of the outer Fe core in the
core-collapse case), which are comparable (they are ultimately determined by the same physics
of electron degeneracy, which determines the immediate pre-supernova structure).
In the ensuing explosion, a large fraction of the white dwarf is burned, in the inner part
completelytonuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE), which means mainlytoiron-groupelements,
mostly Ni, and incompletely further out, producing mainly intermediate-masselements,such
as Si and S. The radioactive Ni will subsequently decay to Co (with a half-life of 6.1 d),
powering the supernova lightcurve, and ultimately to Fe (with a half-life of 77.3 d). A typical
supernova of this type produces ∼.M⊙of Fe; hence, these supernovae are believed to be the
dominant producers of iron in the universe. Since most of them produce very similar amounts
of radioactive Ni, the resulting supernova lightcurves are quite similar, which means that they
can be used as standard distance candles (strictly speaking “standardizable” distance candles;
see >Sect. 5.1).
Unlike core-collapse supernovae, the physics of thermonuclear explosions is reasonably well
understood. One of the lingering uncertainties is how the carbon burning front, which starts as
a deflagration (i.e., a sub-sonic burning front), is acceleratedinto a detonation (i.e., a super-sonic
burning front), which seems to be favored by observations for the majority of thermonuclear
explosions.
4There are other ideas of how to generate a supernova explosion e.g., involving jet-driven explosions, or very
strong magnetic fields. The latter also requires a very rapidly rotating pre-supernova core. While present pre-
supernova models do not predict sufficiently rapidly rotating cores, there may be special circumstances in
which this is the case, and this may be the origin of magnetars, neutron stars with very large magnetic fields,
or even gamma-ray bursts (see >Sect. 7.2).

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts 14

The main uncertainty, even controversy, is the question of their progenitors, the type of
stellar systems in which a CO white dwarf can grow toward the Chandrasekhar mass. We will
return to this issue in >Sect. 5.2.

Supernova Classiﬁcation
The basic classification of supernovae is quite simple: they are classified as Type I or Type II
supernovae, depending on whether they have hydrogen lines in the spectrum (Type II) or lack
hydrogen lines (Type I). For a long time, it was thought that these two observational classes may
have a one-to-one relation to the two explosion mechanisms discussed in the last section, core
collapse supernovae (Type II) and thermonuclear explosions (Type I), respectively. However,
over the last three decades, it has become clear that this is not the case and that, in principle,
both explosion types could come in both observational varieties. As a consequence, the basic
classification has become much more complex, requiring the introduction of more and more
subtypes (>Fig. 14-2).

3.1 Main Classiﬁcation Scheme
The thermonuclear explosion of a CO white dwarf is now believed to be associated with a Type
Ia supernova (SN Ia). These supernovae have no hydrogen but strong Si lines. Si and also S
are intermediate-mass nuclei which are produced in abundance in the part of the exploding
white dwarf that does not burn completely to NSE and therefore provides a very characteristic
signature for a thermonuclear explosion (>Table 14-1).
In addition to SNe Ia, there are two other subtypes of Type I supernovae, Type Ib and
Type Ic. These types are also defined on the basis of their spectroscopic characteristics, both lack
hydrogen, but Type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib) show He lines, while Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic) lack
both Si and He lines. Unlike SNe Ia, they produce fairly little Ni and are found predominantly
in or near star-forming regions and are therefore believed to be connected with core-collapse
supernovae, i.e., the explosions of massive stars that have lost their H-rich envelopes and, in the
case of SNe Ic, their He-rich layers as well.5
There are also several different subtypes of Type I supernovae. Unlike SNe I, they are not
always defined by their spectroscopic properties but by their lightcurves, i.e., their luminosity,
measured in a particular waveband (typically B or V) as a function of time. The lightcurves of
Type II-P supernovae (SNe II-P), where the “P” stands for “plateau,” show a long phase, lasting
up to a ∼d where the lightcurve is nearly constant (the plateau phase). Their progenitors are
most likely massive red supergiants (with a typical mass≲M⊙) that experience core collapse.
The second much less common variety, Type II-L supernovae (SNe II-L), donot show this plateau
but dropoffmore orless linearly(on a logarithmicscale)aftertheirlightcurve has peaked (hence
the letter “L” for “linear”). These are almost certainly also core-collapse supernovae, but in this
case, the progenitors must have already lost a large fraction of their H-rich envelopes.
3.2 Complications
Unfortunately, there are many further complications going beyond this simple scheme. The pro-
genitor of supernova 1987A (SN 1987A, see >Sect. 4) had a large H-rich envelope but did not
have an extended plateau phase (see >Fig. 14-3), and therefore, SN 1987A defines a class of
its own. Other supernovae appear to change their type. Supernova 1993J initially looked like a

5It is presently not entirely clear how much He could be present in a SN Ic. Since He is non-thermally excited,
it requires the presence of a source of energetic photons, e.g., from the radioactive decay of Ni. If the He layer
is shielded from this radioactive source, it is possible in principle to hide significant amounts of He. However,
the most recent estimates (Hachinger et al. 2012) suggest that at most, 0.2 M⊙can be hidden.

a star with a massive hydrogen envelope, but in the case of SN 1969L, the progenitor was a red

type II supernova but soon transformed into a supernova resembling a SN Ib. As a consequence,
this supernova type is now referred to as a Type IIb supernova (SN IIb). Other subtypes are not
directly related to a particular supernova mechanism but to a supernova-related phenomenon.
For example, Type IIn supernovae stand for supernovae that show narrow H lines (Hα) in emis-
sion. These must come from H-rich material in the immediate neighborhood of the supernova,
most likely ejected by the progenitor in the not-too-distant past, that was flash-ionized by the
first light from the supernova. This is not necessarily relatedto a particular explosion type; it just
implies a particular mass-losshistory of the progenitor. In a more extreme version, there may be
so much material around the exploding star that the supernova ejecta are rapidly slowed down
by the interaction with this material, converting kinetic energy into thermal energy and ulti-
mately radiation. In this case, the lightcurve shape itself is determined by this interaction with
the circumstellar material. Supernovae (e.g., >Sect. 8.3) that show evidence for such interac-
tions are sometimes referred to as Type IIa supernovae (SNe IIa), though how this fits into the
overall supernova scheme and, in particular, its relation to SNe IIb devies any obvious logic.
Indeed, as this previous discussion shows, the supernova classification scheme has become
too complicated and convoluted to be very useful. In fact, sometimes even supernova experts
get confused. The problem is that the main scheme is a discrete one, while the supernova prop-
erties clearly vary in a continuous manner. What one would like from a theoretical point of
view is a scheme that first specifies the explosion mechanism and then has one or more con-
tinuous parameters that relate to the key properties of the progenitor that vary from supernova
to supernova (such as the envelope mass; see >Sect. 3.3). In addition, one needs a parameter
that describes the environment in which the supernova occurs, in particular, the circumstellar
material that may be a direct result of the mass-loss history of the progenitor.

3.3 The Diversity of Core-Collapse Supernova Lightcurves
An observable supernova requires the ejection of material (the envelope of a collapsing star or
a completely disrupted star) that cools and radiates away its energy. In general, there are two
main sources for the observed radiation: one is the shock energy that was deposited in the ejecta
by the initial shock wave. The second is radioactive energy from the decay of radioactive Ni
that is produced in the explosion itself that decays first to Co (with a half-life of 6.1 d) and
then to Fe (with a half-life of 77.3 d). In a Type II supernova, the main lightcurve is generally
dominated by the release of shock energy. It is only at late times that the lightcurves are pow-
ered by radioactivity, leading to a characteristic exponential lightcurve tail. The latter allows an
estimate for the amount of Ni that was produced in the explosion. In the case of Type I super-
novae, which generally have very compact progenitors, the shock energy escapes very quickly
and is generally not observed, and the main lightcurve peak is powered by radioactivity. In both
cases, the width of the main peak of the lightcurve is determined by the diffusion timescale on
which photons escape from the expanding ejecta.
Even though there is an enormous diversity of supernova lightcurves of core-collapse super-
novae, a lot of this diversity is relatively easy to understand as a variation of the envelope
properties, specifically its radius and mass, even if the explosions at the center are identi-
cal. >Figure 14-3 compares the lightcurve of a typical SN II-P (SN 1969L) to the lightcurve
of SN 1987A. Both supernovae probably had massive progenitors with large H-rich envelopes.
But the difference is that the progenitor of SN 1969L almost certainly was a red supergiant, with
a radius of ∼1,000–2,000 R⊙, while the progenitor of SN 1987A only had a radius of ∼R⊙.
In the latter case, a significant fraction of the explosion energy was consumed in expanding the
ejecta from its more compact, more tightly bound configuration, making it less luminous, at
least initially.
An even more important parameter is the envelope mass. This is illustrated in >Fig. 14-4
which shows theoretical lightcurves (in this case, V-band magnitude versus time) for a star of
initially M⊙that was assumed to have lost different amounts of envelope mass before the
explosion (in all cases, the star is a red supergiant at the time of explosion). All simulations start
by depositing the same amount of explosion energy (J) in the center. For the case, where the
star has lost none of its envelope and has a final presupernova H-rich envelope mass of .M⊙
(as labeled), the lightcurve is that of a typical SN II-P with a plateau phase lasting ∼50 d.6 As
the envelope mass is reduced, the plateau shortens and the overall luminosity increases (as the
total energy input is the same). Once the envelope mass has dropped below M⊙, the plateau
has disappeared and this lightcurve would be classified as a SN II-L. As the envelope mass is
reduced further to .M⊙, the lightcurve only has a short peak where hydrogen would be visible
in the spectrum; this would classified as a SN IIb. If the hydrogen envelope is lost completely,
one would have a SN Ib and, if the He layer is lost as well, a SN Ic. Thus, the whole sequence,
SN II-P →SN II-L →SN IIb →SN Ib →SN Ic,
is just a sequence of increased envelope loss, first of the H-rich envelope and then the He-
rich layer. The immediate physical question is what causes this mass loss. While stellar winds
may play an important role in some cases, binary interactions are almost certainly even more
6The reason why this lightcurve does not show the initial peak seen for SN 1969L in > Fig. 14-3 is that
>Fig. 14-3 shows a bolometric lightcurve, while >Fig. 14-4 shows a V-band lightcurve. The V-band lightcurve
peaks later, as initially most of the radiation from the supernova escapes in the UV.

important since a large fraction, if not the majority, of all massive stars are in relatively close
binaries where the components can interact directly (e.g., by mass transfer causing mass loss,
mass accretion, and, in the most extreme case, bythe complete mergerofthe binarycomponents
(Podsiadlowski et al. 1992); see >Sect. 7.1). These interactions particularly affect the envelope
properties of the massive progenitors and hence help to determine the shapes of the resulting
lightcurves.
3.3.1 Understanding SN II-P Lightcurves
Most of the key properties of a II-P lightcurve are relatively easy to understand from basic
principles. A supernova is basically a huge explosion where a certain amount of energy, the
explosion energy (Eexp), is suddenly put in the center of a large stellar envelope. The explosion
energyis determined bythe details ofthe explosion mechanism; in the presentlyfavored delayed
neutrino-driven explosion, this energy accumulates till it is sufficient to unbind the parts of the
core that do not become part of the central neutron star; this sets a natural energy scale for
Eexp ∼J. Since this energy is injected on a timescale of ≲1 s, which is short compared to
the dynamical timescale of even the core of the star, this will drive a shock front, propagat-
ing outward through the rest of star and accelerating it in the process. The first visible sign of
the supernova (apart from the neutrino signal from the initial collapse that propagates with
the speed of light) appears when the shock reaches the photosphere which finds itself sud-
denly heated to .– × K, the temperature behind the shock.7 From this point onward,
7Even before the shock reaches the surface of the star, some radiation generated in the shocked region will
diffuse outward faster than the shock front itself moves; when this radiation escapes from the progenitor, it

704 14

the supernova can be considered an expanding and cooling sphere of gas. Its luminosity is
determined by the location of the photosphere,8 which recedes in mass coordinates but may
either expand or contract in radius coordinates, and the characteristic temperature at the pho-
tosphere. Since this temperature is initially very high (∼K), the spectrum will first peak in
soft X-rays and the UV (producing a short-lived UV flash that will ionize any nearby circum-
stellar material), moving steadily toward the B and V, as the ejecta cool, mainly due to adiabatic
expansion.
The supernova shock accelerates as it moves through the envelope toward lower-density
regions. As a result, the ejecta reach their highest velocities in the very outermost layers (this
velocity may easily exceed 0.1 c, where c is the speed of light). The characteristic velocity of the
ejecta on the whole can be estimated simply from energy conservation,
Eexp ∼

where Mej and vej are the massand characteristic velocity of the ejecta, respectively (this ignores

As the energy that was deposited by the initial shock has to diffuse out of this expanding sphere
of gas, the overall length of the lightcurve is determined by the diffusion time, which is given by

(14.4)
where R is the radius of the sphere and l the mean free path of the diffusing photons (this
formula can be derived from a simple random-walk process). The mean free path itself can be

plasma). This estimate is in reasonable agreement with detailed numerical calculations. The
flat portion of the lightcurve in >Fig. 14-3, the plateau phase, starts when the temperature at
the photosphere has fallen sufficiently so that H starts to recombine (at a typical temperature
T ∼6,000 K). Since the recombination releases the ionization energy of H, this helps to keep
produces a radiative precursor which precedes the actual shock breakout. Such a precursor has been observed
for the II-P supernova SNLS-04D2dc (Schawinski et al. 2008).

the photosphere hotter than it otherwise would be (H recombination acts like a thermostat
keeping the temperature at ∼6,000 K). Since the photospheric radius changes only slowly in this
phase, even though the H recombination front moves inward in mass coordinates, the overall
luminosity remains roughly constant.
Once the photosphere has passed through the H-rich ejecta, the lightcurve tends to drop
sharply and at late times shows the characteristic exponential tail due to the radioactive decay
of Co, which itself is the decay produce of Ni, produced in the explosion.

Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud
Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A) was the first supernova visible with the naked eye since Keplers
supernova in 1604. It occurred on February 23, 1987 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite
galaxy of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, about 180,000 lightyears away. Since it was the first
nearby supernova seen in almost 400 years, it has long been awaited by astronomers and there-
fore was one of the major astronomical events of the 1980s. The observations of neutrinos from
the supernova confirmed that this type of supernova is produced by the collapse of a massive
star, leading to the formation of a neutron star.
4.1 The Mystery of the Progenitor Star
While SN 1987A confirmed some long-held beliefs about supernovae, the star that exploded
defied expectations and provided a major mystery. Images of the region taken before the explo-
sion (>Fig. 14-5) showed that the star that exploded was a blue supergiant with an initial mass
around M⊙and a radius at the time of the explosion of R⊙. Theoretical models of the
evolution of massive stars had predicted that these end their evolution as red supergiants with a
radius of at least R⊙. In addition, the composition of the star that exploded was very unusual;
most importantly, the outer layers of the star had an abundance of helium (as a fraction of the
total composition) that was about a factor of 2 larger than the expected abundance, as if part of
the material from the core, where helium has been produced during the previous evolution of
the star, was mixed into the outer layers by some unexpected mixing process. Why was the star
blue and not red and why were there these chemical anomalies?
A major clue to resolve this mystery was the discovery of the triple-ring nebula around the
supernova (Burrows et al. 1995). The nebula is composed of three overlapping rings, seen in
projection (see the left panel of > Fig. 14-6), and consists of material that was ejected from
the progenitor star some 20,000 years before the explosion. The supernova occurred right at
the center of the inner ring, while the outer rings lie in planes below and above the central
ring plane. The whole nebula was flash-ionized by the supernova, and we are now seeing the
afterglow of this flash. The nebula is almost axisymmetric. This generally suggests that rotation
may have played an important role in the shaping of the nebula. However, any star that was
rapidly rotating early in its evolution could not have been rapidly rotating as a supergiant. This
essentially ruled out that the progenitor star could have been a normal single star and strongly
suggested that the progenitor was a member of a binary system, specifically a system where the
two binary components merged completely 20,000 years before the explosion.

4.2 A Binary Merger Model for the Progenitor of SN 1987A
The idea that the anomalous properties of the progenitor of SN 1987A are the result of
the merger had already been proposed long before the discovery of the triple-ring nebula
(Hillebrandt and Meyer 1989; Podsiadlowski et al. 1990). In this model, the system consisted
initially of two massive stars, one with a mass of –M⊙and a less massive companion with a
mass of –M⊙, orbiting with an orbital period of at least 10 years. Becauseof the relativelylong
orbital period, these stars would only interact late during the evolution of the more massive star,
in fact about 20,000 years before the explosion. When the more massive star starts to transfer
mass to the less massive star, mass transfer is unstable, and the more massive star engulfs its
less massive companion (see >Fig. 14-7 for a schematic diagram). The less massive star then
orbits the core of the more massive star inside the envelope of the more massive component.
Because of friction with the envelope, the two stars spiral toward each other and ultimately
merge completely, spinning up the envelope in the process and dredging up part of the helium

core, explaining the unusual abundances of the supernova (Ivanova and Podsiadlowski 2003).
Because of the dredge-up of the helium and the increased envelope mass, the now single object
shrinks to become a blue supergiant. In this transition as much as several solar masses are spun
off in the equatorial direction producing a disk-like outflow. In the last 20,000 years before the
star explodes, it is a blue supergiant. Such stars have strong stellar winds. This wind sweeps up
all the structures that have been produced previously to produce the observed triple-ring nebula
(see Morris and Podsiadlowski (2007) for details).

Type Ia Supernovae
5.1 Type Ia Supernovae as Cosmological Distance Candles
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been very successfully used as standardizable distance
candles and have provided the first indication for an accelerating universe (Riess et al. 1998;
Perlmutter et al. 1999). It is sometimes said that SNe Ia are “standard” candles because they
occur in Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs with standard properties. This is actually not true;
the range of observed peak luminosities is a factor of 10, reflecting the vastly different amounts
of Ni produced in different supernovae (0.1–1 M⊙), a variation that is not at all under-
stood theoretically. However, SN Ia lightcurves vary in a very systematic fashion, where the
brighter supernovae have broader lightcurves than their fainter counterparts (as illustrated
in >Fig. 14-8). Indeed, empirically there seems to be a one-to-one relationship between the
peak magnitude and the lightcurve width which can be measured by the change in magnitude
(e.g., in the B band) of the lightcurve between the peak and 15 days after the peak (defining the

ΔMparameter). This relationship, known as the “Phillips relation” (Phillips 1993), can be used
to determine the true peak magnitude of any SN Ia and makes them useful as cosmological dis-
tance candles. The physical origin of the Phillips relation that links the peak SN Ia luminosity to
the lightcurve width is now reasonablywell understood (see, e.g., Mazzali et al. 2001). Thesuper-
nova lightcurve is powered by the radioactive decay of Ni into Co and Fe, and hence, the
peak luminosity is directly proportional to the Ni mass (Arnett 1982). The lightcurve width on
the other hand is determined by the diffusion time, i.e., the timescale on which photons gener-
ated by the decay escape from the ejecta. This in turn depends on the opacity, which under these
conditions is dominatedby iron-group elements(in particular, Ni, Ni, Fe). Since the dom-
inant iron-group element is Ni, which also determines the lightcurve peak, this introduces a
one-to-one relationship between the lightcurve peak and the lightcurve width. However, the
opacity is also dependent on other iron-group elements, such as Ni and Fe, which are sta-
ble elements and do not provide a radioactive energy source. The ratio of Ni to Ni depends
on the neutron excess η in the exploding white dwarf, where η can be related to the electron
number fraction Ye by η = −Ye. Most importantly, Ye depends on the initial metallicity of
the progenitor and, in particular, on the initial oxygen abundance. Timmes et al. (2003) have
estimated the final Ni mass fraction as X(Ni) ≈−.Z/Z⊙, where Z/Z⊙is the metal-
licity relative to solar metallicity. This introduces metallicity as a second, necessary parameter
that affects the lightcurve shape. For a reasonable range of metallicity, this may account for the
observed spread in the Phillips relation. It is clear now that this metallicity effect needs to be
taken into account, in particular, if one wants to improve the use of SNe Ia as cosmological
distance candles.
5.2 The Progenitors of SNe Ia
One of the weakest points in our understanding of SNe Ia is the nature of their progenitors.
There is now broad agreement that most SNe Ia are caused by a thermonuclear explosion of a
CO white dwarf when its mass approaches the Chandrasekhar mass. What is still uncertain and
is indeed controversial is the evolution that produces these Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs.
The most popular progenitor models fall broadly into two classes, the single-degenerate (SD)
model and the double-degenerate (DD) model.
5.2.1 The Single-Degenerate Model
In the SD model, the white dwarf grows in mass by accreting from a non-degenerate com-
panion star (Whelan and Iben 1973; Nomoto 1982), where the companion star can either be
a main-sequence star, a helium star, a subgiant, or even a giant. The main problem with this
class of models is that it is generally difficult to increase the mass of a white dwarf by accre-
tion: if the mass-accretion rate is too low, this causes nova explosions and/or helium flashes
(Nomoto 1982) which may eject most of the accreted mass. If the mass-accretion rate is too
high, most of the transferred mass must be lost in a disc wind to avoid a merger of the binary,
again leading to a low accretion efficiency. There is only a very narrow parameter range where
a white dwarf can accrete hydrogen-rich material and burn in a stable manner. This param-
eter range may be increased if differential rotation affects the accretion process (Yoon and
Langer 2004). One promising channel that has been identified in recent years relates them to

710 14
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts
supersoft X-ray sources (van den Heuvel et al. 1992). However, it is not clear whether this chan-
nel produces a sufficient number of systems to explain the observed SN Ia rate in our Galaxy
(∼× −year−; Cappellaro and Turatto 1997). On the plus side, a number of binary systems
are known that are excellent candidates for SN Ia progenitors: U Sco, RS Oph, and TCrB all
contain white dwarfs that are already close to the Chandrasekhar mass, where the latter two
systems are symbiotic binaries containing a giant companion (see Hachisu et al. 1999 for a dis-
cussion of this channel). However, in none of these cases, is it clear whether the massive white
dwarf is a CO or an ONeMg white dwarf (the latter is not expected to produce a SN Ia).
5.2.2 The Double-Degenerate Model
In contrast to the SD model, the DD model (Iben and Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984) involves
the merger of two CO white dwarfs with a combined mass in excess of the Chandrasekhar
mass. This model has the advantage that the theoretically predicted merger rate is quite high
(see, e.g., Yungelson et al. 1994; Han et al. 1995; Nelemans et al. 2001), consistent with the
observed SN Ia rate. The main problem with this scenario is that it seems more likely that the
disruption of the lighter white dwarf and the accretion of its debris onto the more massive one
leads to the transformation of the surviving CO white dwarf into an ONeMg white dwarf which
subsequentlycollapses toform a neutron star(i.e., undergoes accretion-induced collapse)rather
than experiencing a thermonuclearexplosion (e.g., Nomotoand Iben 1985), although there may
be circumstances under which this can be avoided (Yoon et al. 2007).
In recent years, numerous observational tests have been devised to test these various pro-
genitor models, sometimes with strong claims (“this rules out . . .”), but more often with claims
that contradict others, and the whole discussion has remained fluid. Some of these tests involve
the detetion of circumstellar material, as might be produced by the wind of a single-degenerate
donor star, the detection of a surviving companion in a historical supernova remnant in our
own galaxy, the direct detection of a progenitor on old plates, and many more.
Two recent SNe Ia have provided important new constraints. The first one was one of the
closest SNe Ia in many decades, SN 2011fe/PTF11kly, in M101, the pinwheel galaxy, which
reached a peak apparent magnitude of 10 and will remain observable for many years to come.
Because M101 is a well-studied galaxies, there are deep archival HST images of the super-
nova field. Since these do not show any counterpart at the explosion site, this rules out a
single-degenerate progenitor where the donor star is a typical red giant, such as in RS Oph
(Li et al. 2011). In contrast, a second recent supernova, PTF 11kx (Dilday et al. 2012) shows
clear evidence for hydrogen in the immediate vicinity of the supernova, which must have been
ejected from the progenitor system. The most likely candidate is a red-giant donor with a some-
what larger mass-loss rate than is observed in RS Oph. This clearly demonstrates that there is
more than one channel that can produce a normal-looking SN Ia.

Gamma-Ray Bursts, Collapsars, and Hypernovae
6.1 The History of Gamma-Ray Bursts
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short flashes of gamma rays, lasting from a fraction of a second to
hundreds, sometimes thousands of seconds. They were discovered accidentally in 1967 by a US

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts 14
711
spy satellite that was scanning the Earth’s atmosphere for gamma rays from Russian atmospheric
nuclear tests in violation of the atmospheric test-ban treaty. Instead of finding gamma rays from
the Russians, the satellite found GRBs from all over the sky. This discovery was kept secret till
1973 (Klebesadel et al. 1973) and remained one of the biggest mysteries in astronomy until
1998. At some point, there were more theories for GRBs than actual bursts. Initially, most peo-
ple thought that these were probably associated with events on neutron stars in our own galaxy.
The mystery only deepended when in the early 1990s a new satellite was launched, NASA’s
Compton-Ray Observatory, and BATSE, one of its onboard experiments, found that GRBs were
not concentrated toward the Galactic disc and center, as most people had expected, but that
their locations were distributed perfectly isotropically all over the sky. This ruled out one of the
leading models, neutron stars in the Galactic disc, as sources of these events. It still did not fix
their distance scale as one can imagine various isotropic distributions. The closest is the Oort
cloud of comets around our own solar system, although it is far from clear how these could
produce GRBs. A more realistic alternative were sources in the halo of the Milky Way; if the
characteristic distance scale of a halo population (e.g., of a special subset of neutron stars or
other compact objects) is sufficiently large, it could potentially produce an isotropic sky dis-
tribution. The most dramatic possibility was that GRBs originated from the distant universe
and that the GRB isotropy reflected the large-scale isotropy of the universe.9 Depending on the
distance scale, GRBs could be associated with feeble events in the outer solar system or with
some of the most energetic events in the universe. One problem with BATSE was that it was
not able to localize GRBs very well, at best only to within a few degrees. Such a large field of
sky contains far too many sources and makes it impossible to find GRB counterparts in other
wavebands.
The resolution of this mystery came with the launch of another high-energy satellite in
1996, BeppoSAX, an Italian-Dutch collaboration, which was able to localize GRBs much better
than BATSE (within about 1 arcmin) and, moreover, very quickly, allowing the rapid follow-
up with optical telescopes. This quickly lead to the first detection of a GRB in the optical, an
optical afterglow associated with a GRB. Moreover, optical spectra of these afterglows showed
highly redshifted absorption lines, which must be caused by galaxies in front of the GRBs.
This proved beyond doubt that they must originate from cosmological distances, connecting
them with the most energetic events in the universe (apart from the Big Bang itself). Indeed,
GRBs are so energetic that they can be detected throughout the observable universe and can
be used as a probe of the early universe. At present, the most distant explosion in the uni-
verse, and arguably the most distant object known in the Universe, is a GRB at a redshift of 9.4
(Cucchiara et al. 2011).
6.2 The Main Properties of GRBs
GRBs come in many different shapes; some show substructure on sub-millisecond scales,
others have a smooth time profile lasting tens to hundreds of seconds, perhaps with some
short spikes superimposed. Others seem to turn off, only to produce another burst-like event
100s, sometimes 1,000s of seconds later. Based on their duration, GRBs are divided into two
9Before the advent of BATSE, one of the few astrophysicists who strongly advocated a cosmological origin for
GRBs was Bohdan Paczy´nski whose arguments at the time, however, were not taken very seriously by most
people in the field.

712 14

groups, short-duration GRBs (SGRBs) with an average duration of 0.3 s and long-duration
GRBs (LGRBs) with a median duration of around 20 s, where the spectra of the former group
tend to be significantly harder. At present, optical afterglows with intervening absorption lines
have only been discovered for LGRBs, though a few SGRBs are found close to big galaxies,
making an association likely. It is generally believed that the two groups of GRBs are associated
with very different events. SGRBs are probably caused by the merger of two compact objects, in
particular, two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. In these systems, the two com-
pact objects are driven toward each other by the loss of angular momentum by gravitational
radiation, ultimately leading to a cataclysmic merger and a burst of gravitational radiation and
gamma rays. In contrast, LGRBs are probably connected with the death of massive stars, as dis-
cussed in more detail in >Sect. 6.4. To complicate things further, there is another class of GRBs,
so-called soft gamma-ray repeaters that have a Galactic origin. They tend to have a softer spec-
trum than classical GRBs (i.e., SGRBs and LGRBs) and appear to be associated with repeating,
nondestructive events occurring on magnetic neutron stars, so-called magnetars.10
The spectra of GRBs tend to be quite hard with most of the energy being emitted at
≳200 keV, and the spectra themselves can best be described by a power law, indicating a mainly
nonthermal origin, such as synchroton radiation and/or inverse Compton radiation.
The apparent range of total energy coming out in gamma rays can be large, ranging from
to several J. However, this assumes that the gamma-ray emission is istropic. In fact, it
is generally accepted that GRBs are highly beamed, both relativistically and geometrically.
6.2.1 Relativistic Beaming of GRBs
Detailed models of GRBs indicate that the material that emits the gamma rays moves relativis-
tically with Lorentz factors γ ≳. This implies that the radiation is relativistically beamed
with most of the emission confined to a narrow beam in the direction of the flow with a beam-
ing angle θrel ≲/γ. Since the flow itself is believed to be a confined to a narrow jet with an
opening angle θjet ∼○−○, only an observer within the beam will be able to observe a GRB
(see >Fig. 14-9). This has two important implications: (1) since the energy is not isotropic, the
true energy in a GRB will be reduced by a factor of π/ΔΩ over the naive estimate based on
isotropic emission, where ΔΩ is the effective solid angle of the beam. (2) Since the beaming
angle is small, most GRBs are not observable (at least not in gamma rays). This implies that the
true GRB event rate has to be increased by the same factor π/ΔΩ. Initially, θrel will generally
be less than θjet. However, as the material in the jet is slowed down, most likely because of an
interaction with the circumstellar medium, there will come a point when θrel becomes larger
than θjet, which means that the afterglow emission is spread over a larger solid angle. This pro-
duces a characterstic break in the afterglow lightcurve and can be used, in combination with
detailed modeling of the afterglow, to estimate the jet-opening angle and hence the beaming
correction (typically a factor of a few hundred). Indeed, when this is done, this reduces the esti-
mate of GRB energies to a much narrower range around J (Frail et al. 2001), similar to the
10BATSE has also detected many GRB-like events from the Earth’s atmosphere; these are associated with thun-
derstorms in the upper atmosphere. While they cannot be mistaken for classical GRBs because of their location,
it is amusing that nature produces events that look very similar in terms of durations and observable gamma-ray
fluxes but have very different underlying mechanisms on hugely varying energy scales.

energy in a normal supernova.11 However, this accounts only for the energy in gamma rays;
the total energy in the GRB event, including the energy in the jet itself and any possibly associ-
ated supernova event, is probably at least an order of magnitude larger (see >Sect. 6.5). It also
means that, while there are about 3 GRBs in the universe per day that we can detect in principle,
the true rate is at least a few hundred times larger. This still makes GRBs extremely rare events;
for comparison, core-collapse supernovae are about a factor of 1,000 more common. Therefore,
whatever produces a GRB clearly requires very special circumstances.
6.3 The Relativistic Fireball Model
6.3.1 The Compactness and the Baryon Loading Problem
GRBs are variable on timescales of tmin ∼−s. This implies that the emitting region, which
should scale like c tmin (where c is the speed of light) is ∼m. However, this causes an imme-
diate problem; if one confined all the photons emitted in a GRB to a sphere of that radius, this
photon gas would be optically thick to the production of electron/positron pairs (since most
photons have energies larger than 0.5 MeV). This has several consequences. (1) The typical pho-
ton energy is rapidly downgraded to energies <0.5 MeV. (2) The gamma-ray energy is converted
into kinetic energy (of the e+e−plasma). (3) The resulting spectrum becomes that of a modified
blackbody, which is not what is observed.
In addition, this emitting region has to be essentially baryon-free. Otherwise, the gamma-
ray energy would mainly go into accelerating the baryons. What is needed is an essentially
baryon-free relativistic fireball consisting only of electrons, positrons, and gamma-ray photons.
Having such a fireball confined to a jet alleviates the problem slightly as it reduces the rate
of pair production but does not solve it.
11NASA’s Swift satellite, launched in 2004, has only been able to detect clear jet breaks in a few GRBs, despite
its much better sensitivity. It is presently not clear what implications this has for estimates of the jet opening
angle and the beaming correction that needs to be applied.

714 14
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts
6.3.2 The Role of Shocks
The solution of this conundrum is that indeed the energy that is produced in the central GRB
engine goes first into the kinetic energy of the relativistic jet but that this energy is later recon-
verted into photons by shocks after the flow has become optically thin (Meszaros and Rees
1993), e.g., emitted in the form of synchroton radiation in the shocked material. Two types of
shocks may play a role in this picture: external shocks caused by the fireball running into an
external medium and internal shocks in the relativistic flow itself, as faster portions of the flow
catch up with slower ones (see >Fig. 14-9). It is easy to imagine that a combination of the two
types of shocks can account for the large diversity of observed GRB profiles, where the internal
shocks may account for a lot of the fine structure of the bursts, while the external shocks are
more likely to produce the broader structures. Even though this fireball model does not depend
on the details of the central engine that actually drives the GRB, the engine still has to be vari-
able on very short timescales to produce the observed variations in the flow and its interaction
with the surrounding medium.
6.4 The Collapsar Model and the Central Engine
Observationally, long-duration GRBs involve processes that occur on timescales that vary by
many orders of magnitude (see > Fig. 14-9). The central engine that drives the GRB oper-
ates on a characteristic timescales of milliseconds with sub-millisecond variations, while the
main GRB must last for 10–s. The longest timescale associated with the optical afterglow
(hours to years) is probably the easiest to understand; in the framework of the relativistic fire-
ball model, it is just determined by the interaction of the relativistic jet with the surrounding
medium (>Sect. 6.3) and any supernova event possibly associated with the GRB (>Sect. 6.5).
The presently favored model for the GRB itself is the collapsar model (Woosley 1993), which
connects a long-duration GRB with the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive star to
a black hole.12 Because of its rapid rotation, such a core cannot collapse directly to a black hole
since angular momentum has to be conserved in a dynamical collapse. While the low-angular-
momentum material along the polar region can collapse directly to form a proto-neutron star
or black hole at the center, most of the high-angular-momentum material first has to first form
a centrifugally supported disc orbiting the central object. Viscous processes within the disc will
then allow accretion of this material onto the black hole. The characteristic timescale associ-
ated with this is the Keplerian timescale near the central compact object, which for a neutron
star or low-mass black hole is of order milliseconds. On the the hand, the overall duration of
the accretion activity is determined by the collapse timescale of the core which is of order its
dynamical timescale, which can be estimated as tdyn ∼/
√
Gρ, where ρ is the mean density
of the core. Taking the typical density of a collapsing helium star as ρc ≃× kg m−then
yields a characteristic collapse timescale of tdyn ∼s, very much consistent with the char-
acteristic observed duration of LGRBs. Thus, the collapsar model naturally explains both the
12The collapsar model is not the only model presently under consideration. One promising alternative involves
the formation of a rapidly rotating neutron star with a very strong magnetic field, a magnetar, which is spun
down on a timescale of a few seconds, extracting a large fraction of the rotational energy and powering a GRB
(see, e.g., Metzger et al. 2011). Similar to the collapsar model, it requires a rapidly rotating progenitor core,
but the final object is more likely a neutron star.

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts 14

overall duration of an LGRB and its short-term variability. Note that the accretion rate onto the
central object is generally determined by the viscous processes in the disc and not the collapse
of the core itself. If the central accretion rate is lower than the overall infall rate, as is particularly
likely to happen in the early phase of collapse, the mass in the disc will increase until the disc
itself becomes gravitationally unstable (via the Toomre instability; Toomre 1964). The disc then
becomes globally unstable and will develop spiral modes that very efficiently redistribute angu-
lar momentum in the disc (on a dynamical timescale and not the natural viscous timescale of
the disc). This leads to a sudden increase in the central accretion rate (≳1 M⊙s−), reflected in a
sharp increase in GRB activity (for details, see Taylor et al. 2011). In addition, thermal instabil-
ities in such an unstable disc cause clumping of disc material and, as these clumps are accreted,
could cause variability on sub-millisecond timescales.
A necessary requirement for the collapsar model is that the collapsing core has enough
angular momentumto be able to form a disc. We can estimatethe amount required by consider-
ing the case offorming a discaround a black hole ofmass MBH that formed in the initial collapse.
Treating this in a completely Newtonion manner, the specific angular momentum of a Keplerian
disc is given by j = √GMBHRin, where Rin is the inner radius of the disc. Taking this radius to be
the last stable orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, Rin = GMBH/c, the critical j for disc
formation can be written as jcrit =
√
GMBH/c ≃× ms−(MBH/M⊙). This estimate
gives the specific angular momentum required in the outer parts of the progenitor’s core.
6.4.1 The GRB Energy Source
In order to produce an energetic GRB, more energy is required than in an ordinary supernova
(taking into account that only a fraction of the total energy emerges in gamma rays). There
are two potential energy sources. The first is the gravitational binding energy of the disc that is
released as material is accreted onto the central black hole. In terms of the rest-mass energy of
the accreted material, Macc, this can be written as
E = ηMacc c.
(14.7)
For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, the efficiency factor η ≃., as determined by
the binding energy at the last stable orbit. For a rotating Kerr black hole, η can, in principle,
be as high as 42%, although in practice it is unlikely to be larger than ∼30%. For a disc mass of
∼1 M⊙, this means that more than J could potentially be extracted from the disc.
The second source of energy is the spin energy of the black hole itself. If the material that
is accreted by a rotating black hole is magnetically connected to the disc surrounding the black
hole (provided the disc has a strong poloidal magnetic field), this causes a magnetic coupling of
the black hole’s ergosphere with the disc, which allows black-hole spin energy to be extracted.
This is known as the Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford and Znajek 1977). Up to 29% of
the spin energy can in principle be extracted, where more generally the extractible energy is
given by
EBZ = × J f (a) (MBH/M⊙),
(14.8)
where f (a) = −([a +
√
−a]/)/≤.and a is the angular momentum parameter that
can vary between 0 and 1.
For both energy sources, there is more than enough energy to power even a very powerful
GRB. The key is that, because of the rotation, a much larger fraction of the gravitational binding

716 14
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts
energy of the compact object being formed can be used than in a classical neutrino-driven
explosion, where most of this energy just escapes in the form of neutrinos and is wasted.
6.4.2 The Production of a Relativistic Jet
Relativistic jets are a generic feature of most GRB models; how they are produced is less clear.
One possibility is that they are neutrino-driven jets. Just, as in the case of a normal core-collapse
supernova, neutrinos are copiouslyproduced and in fact provide the main cooling process. Most
of these neutrinos will escape from the system, but those that interact with other neutrinos will
do so preferentially along the polar axis (for geometrical reasons) producing e+/e−pairs. Since
this is also the region with low baryon loading, this could potentially drive a relativistic jet. It is
not clear whether this process is efficient enough in the case of LGRBs but could be in the case
of merging neutron stars in the context of SGRBs. For LGRBs, it appears more likely that the
relativistic jets are produced by some, presently not well understood MHD process as matter is
accreted at a very high rate.
6.5 Hypernovae: The LGRB – Supernova Connection
In the late1990s, it was realized that, in addition to the normal core-collapse and thermonuclear
explosions, there are more energetic supernovae with an energy output ≳J, i.e., they are at
least ten times as energetic as a normal supernova. These are now often referred to as hypernovae
(HNe) or alternatively as broad-lined supernovae since they have very broad lines, reflecting
their more energetic nature. The prototype is SN 1998bw (Iwamoto et al. 1998). SN 1998bw was
also observed as an LGRB, establishing the first connection between a GRB and a supernova,
the death of a massive star. Admittedly, the GRB associated with SN 1998bw was rather feeble,
causing some arguments in the literature about the validity of this link, but there have been
many more GRB/SN connections since, in some cases involving very typical GRBs (e.g., SN
2009nz/GRB 091127; Berger et al. 2011). This leaves no doubt that at least some LGRBs are
associated with the explosions of massive stars. In addition, many GRB afterglows show bumps
in the lightcurve that are consistent with an underlying hypernova-like event. Interestingly, at
present, all GRB supernovae are classificed as SNe Ic, i.e., supernovae that have lost both their
hydrogen and their helium envelopes, providing a potentially important clue to the nature of
their progenitors. Hypernovae are just as rare as LGRBs with a characteristic rate for a galaxy
like the Milky Way of −year−(Podsiadlowski et al. 2004b). This, however, does not mean
that all LGRBs are accompanied by a hypernova. In order to see a hypernova, the event has
to produce a large amount of Ni since it is the radioactive decay of Ni that powers a SN
Ic lightcurve. However, Ni production is not required in the collapsar model; indeed, Woosley
(1993) originally suggested that this model would produce a faint supernova or no supernova at
all. At present, it is not clear where Ni is produced in the collapsar model, and it is conceivable
that in some cases, no or very little Ni is ejected, leading to a dark GRB burst, i.e., a GRB not
accompanied by a bright afterglow or hypernova.
One would also not necessarily expect every hypernova to be associated with a GRB, even
if the hypernova is created by a central engine. In order to observe a GRB, a relativistic jet has
not only to form but also has to escape from the collapsing star, i.e., be able to penetrate the

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts 14
717
remaining envelope. If the jet fails to escape, it may still drive a powerful explosion but may not
be accompanied by a GRB: it would be a failed GRB.
Even though hypernovae are rare today, if they were more common in the past (e.g., because
a lower metallicity makes them more common), they could be important contributors to the
global nucleosynthesis as they produce a lot of Fe (from the decay of Ni) at very early times and
other elements like Zn, that are overproduced in such energetic explosions.
6.6 The Progenitors of GRBs
For the case of short-duration GRBs, there is broad agreement that they are probably associated
with the merger of two compact objects, two neutron stars, a neutron star and a black hole, or
perhaps a neutron star and a white dwarf. The situation is very different for long-duration GRBs,
where there is not even agreement whether they involve single stars or binaries. In either case,
as GRBs are rare, there have to be special circumstances that produce a GRB progenitor.
6.6.1 Single-Star Progenitor Models for LGRBs
The problem with single stars is that they very efficiently lose their angular momentum in stellar
winds. Moreover, even very weak seed magnetic fields efficiently redistribute angular momen-
tum in a star (trying to erase any differential rotation), which prevents the formation of a rapidly
rotating core (see Heger et al. 2005). This problem is less severe at lower metallicity where the
wind mass-loss rates are much lower. Moreover, ifstars rotate extremelyrapidly, theymayevolve
homogeneously and avoid a red-supergiant phase altogether (see >Sect. 7.3) and the associated
strong mass loss. Yoon and Langer (2005b) and Woosley and Heger (2006) have proposed that
such homogeneous evolution can produce rapidly rotating progenitor cores, provided that the
metallicity is quite low, typically less than 1/5 solar (Yoon et al. 2006). Indeed, there has been
some observational evidence that LGRBs are preferentially found in small galaxies with low
metallicity, although in recent years, it has become clear that LGRBs can also occur at solar or
even super-solar metallicity (e.g., Levesque et al. 2010). Therefore, it seems from observations
that there is no strong metallicity cutoff for GRBs but perhaps just a metallicity bias.
6.6.2 Binary Progenitor Models
It some sense, it seems much easier to produce a GRBs in a binary as there always is an over-
abundance of stored angular momentum in the form of the orbital angular momentum of the
binary: one just has to be able to tap that orbital angular momentumat the right time to produce
a rapidly rotating stellar core (within the framework of the collapsar model). But even this is
not so easy, as the stars in binaries are subject to the same processes that spin-down single stars,
such as stellar winds and magnetic coupling.
Considering the complexities of binary evolution, it is perhaps not surprising that there is
large number of proposed binary scenarios which we can only sketch here briefly (for a detailed
review, see Fryer et al. 2007).
In many respects, the simplest binary process that can produce a rapidly rotating helium
star is tidal spin-up since, in a tidally locked binary, a star can be spun up (or down) until its

718 14
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts
spin angular velocity is equal to the orbital angular velocity (e.g., Izzard et al. 2004; Det-
mers et al. 2008). Simple angular-momentum estimates suggest that this requires an orbital
period shorter than ∼h. In practice, this means that the companion is most likely a com-
pact object (a neutron star or a black hole), similar to the X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. However,
Detmers et al. (2008) found that, at solar metallicity, the expected strong wind from the Wolf-
Rayet star leads to a significant widening of the binary and the ultimate spin-down of the
companion. As a consequence, this channel is only likely to work at low metallicity.
Most binary models for LGRBs proposed to date involve the merger of two stars of some
type, e.g., a compact object (neutron star or black hole) with a helium core, two helium cores,
a helium core, and a CO core (see Fryer et al. 2007 for detailed discussions and references).
This is a particularly efficient way for converting orbital angular momentum into spin angular
momentum. These models work best if the interaction occurs late in the evolution of the pro-
genitor (so-called Case C mass transfer; see >Sect. 7.1) as there is little remaining time after
the merger to spin down the merger product in a strong Wolf-Rayet wind.
Observationally all GRB-related supernovae to date have been identified as SNe Ic, i.e.,
involve progenitors that have lost both their hydrogen and their helium envelopes, an issue that
it is not usually addressed in these models. There has been some debate of how much helium
could be hidden in a SN Ic. The most recent estimates suggest that it could be only very little
(less than a few .M⊙; Hachinger et al. 2012); this provides a serious challenge to all the models
mentioned so far, single and binary.
This problem could potentially be avoided if the merger itself is explosive. Podsiadlowski
et al. (2010) proposed an explosive common-envelope ejection scenario in certain types of late
binary mergers, where the merging of a hydrogen-rich low-mass star with an evolved massive
helium core triggers a thermonuclear runaway in the helium layer, leading to the ejection of
both the hydrogen envelope and the helium layer. As the CO core is moderately spin up in the
process, this could provide a viable (though probably not very common) channel for a GRB
associated with a SN Ic.

The Diversity of Supernova Explosions
7.1 The Role of Binarity
While it has been clear for many years that binary interactions strongly affect the structures of
stellar envelopes, both by mass loss and by mass accretion, and hence are likely to be a major
cause for the observed diversity of supernova subtypes, it has only recently become clear that
they can also alter the core evolution and, in fact, the final fate of a star. Generically, one expects
that, if mass loss/accretion occurs during an early evolutionary phase, the core continues to
evolve subsequently like a less or more massive star. However, this is not true if mass loss occurs
after the main-sequence phase.
7.1.1 Types of Binary Interactions
While most stars in the sky are probably in binary system, the only ones we are interested here
are those where at least one of the components transfers mass to the other one by Roche-lobe

overflow (RLOF). The fraction of massive binaries that interact at some point during their evo-
lution has been estimated to be in the range of 30–50% of all stellar systems, where the more
massive stars are likely to interact more frequently. Indeed, there is even some evidence that for
binaries containing O stars, the fraction of interacting binaries may be as high as 75 %. For the
first phase13 of mass transfer for one of the stars, one distinguishes three cases of mass transfer
depending on the nuclear evolutionary state of the star: case A (the star is on the main sequence
burning hydrogen), case B (the star has finished hydrogen burning but not helium burning in
the core), and case C (the star has completed core helium burning). >Figure 14-10 shows the
radius evolution of a 5 M⊙star as a function of time and indicates the range where the different
cases occur. Since the radius of the star expands only very little (a factor of ∼2) on the main
sequence but a factor of more than ten before helium ignition and again after helium burning,
it is much more likely that RLOF starts after the star has completed its main-sequence phase
(this assumes a logarithmically flat initial period distribution). On the other hand, since a star
spends most of its life on the main sequence, it follows that most binaries observed in the sky
13If a star experiences more than one mass-transfer phase, the nomenclature quickly becomes complicated,
and there is no established standard notation.

720 14
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts
have not yet had a strong binary interaction, but many of them will do so in the future. This
is particularly important when studying the end states of stars and supernovae that probe the
late evolutionary phases of a star. Note also that quite massive stars (≳20 M⊙) tend to expand
only moderately after helium core burning, and hence, for massive stars, case C mass trans-
fer tends to be much less important than case B mass transfer, where most of the expansion
occurs.
When RLOF occurs, one has to distinguish between different modes of mass transfer,
depending on whether mass transfer is stable or unstable with very different outcomes.
Stable Mass Transfer
Stable, (quasi-)conservative mass transfer (as illustrated in >Fig. 14-11) is the easiest type of
mass transfer to understand. In this case, most, but not necessarily all, of the transferred mass
is accreted by the companion star, generally leading to a widening of the binary. Mass transfer
ends when most of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the donor star has either been transferred to
the companion or been lost from the system. The end product will be a hydrogen-exhausted
helium star with at most a small hydrogen-rich envelope.14 Mass accretion will also change
the structure of the accreting star. If it is still on the main sequence, the accretor tends to be
rejuvenated and then behaves like a more massive normal main-sequence star. On the other
hand, if it has already left the main sequence, its evolution can be drastically altered, and the
star may never evolve to become a red supergiant but explode as a blue supergiant (if it is a
massive star; Podsiadlowski and Joss 1989).
This is illustrated in >Fig. 14-12 which shows the evolutionary tracks of both components
in a binary in a model that reproduces the properties of the progenitor system of SN 1993J, a
Type IIb supernova in M81 (Maund et al. 2004). The primary with an initial mass of 15 M⊙
starts to experience stable mass transfer near the end of its evolution (late case C mass transfer)
but still has a small envelope of 0.3 M⊙left at the time of the explosion, consistent with the
requirement for a SN IIb (see >Sect. 3.3). The companion accretes a large fraction of this mass,
but because its initial mass (14 M⊙) is close to the mass of the primary (in order to ensure stable
mass transfer), it has already left the main sequence and because of the accretion never becomes
a red supergiant. It will spend the rest of its evolution as a blue supergiant and finally explode in
⊡Fig. 14-11
Cartoon illustrating stable mass transfer
14Stable mass transfer can also occur for an expanding hydrogen-exhausted helium star (so-called case BB mass
transfer). In this case, the star is likely to lose a large fraction/most of its helium envelope. This can produce a
SN Ic progenitor with very low ejeta mass.

Cartoon illustrating unstable mass transfer
a supernova similar to SN 1987A (>Sect. 4). Thus, this single observed system illustrates two
ways in which binary evolution produces a particular supernova subtype.
Unstable Mass Transfer and Common-Envelope Evolution
Mass transfer is unstable when the accreting star cannot accrete all off the material trans-
ferred from the donor star. The transferred material than piles up on the accretor and starts
to expand, ultimately filling and overfilling the accretor’s Roche lobe. This leads to the for-
mation of a common-envelope (CE) system, where the core of the donor and the companion
form a binary immersed in the envelope of the donor star (see >Fig. 14-13). Friction between
the immersed binary and the envelope will make the two components spiral toward each
other until enough orbital energy has been released to eject the envelope (Paczy´nski 1976).
This ends the spiral-in phase and leaves a much closer binary consisting of the core of the
giant and a normal-star secondary. If the core is massive enough to explode in a supernova,
it will produce a SN Ib or Ic. Since this spiral-in phase is very short-lived, the immersed com-
panion star will not be able to accrete much matter and will emerge little changed from the
CE phase.
Binary Mergers
The most dramatic consequence of a CE phase is that the orbital energy that is released in the
spiral-in phase is not sufficient to eject the envelope. In this case, the spiral-in process continues
till the core of the donor has merged with the companion, producing a single, initially rapidly
rotating star (such as FK Comae stars).
Binary mergers are one of the least studied phases of binary evolution. Despite of their lack
of attention, binary mergers are by no means rare events: estimates based on binary popula-
tion synthesis (BPS) studies suggest that ∼5–10% of all stars experience a complete merger
with a companion star during their evolution and this fraction could be substantially higher
for binaries containing O stars.
7.1.2 Black Hole or Neutron Star?
Binary interactions can also drastically change the core evolution of a massive star, altering its
final fate. This is particularly true if a star loses its hydrogen envelope just before or early during
He-core burning (early case B mass transfer).

star with a small 0.3 M⊙H-rich envelope. Because of the accreted mass, the secondary never

by large error bars (From Maund et al. 2004)
First, consider the case of a massive star (>20–25 M⊙) that, if single, would be likely to
eventually collapse to a black hole (Fryer and Kalogera 2001). However, if it loses its H-rich
envelope early enough, its evolution is quite different (see >Fig. 14-14). Because of the lack of a
H-burning shell, the convective core does not grow during helium core burning, and stars end
up with much smaller CO and ultimately iron cores (Brown et al. 2001). Indeed, because of this,
such H-deficient stars formed in case B binaries are expected to end their evolution as neutron
stars rather than as black holes (Brown et al. 2001), even for initial masses as high as ∼60 M⊙.
In contrast, single stars are believed to produce black holes for much lower initial masses (∼20–
25 M⊙; e.g., Fryer and Kalogera 2001). On the other hand, single stars only become Wolf-Rayet
stars if their initial mass is larger than ∼25–35 M⊙(depending on the exact mass-loss rate).
Since the formation of a slowly rotating black hole is not apriori expected to be associated with
a bright supernova (as the whole star can just collapse into a black hole), this has the important
implication that all normal H-deficient core-collapse supernovae (SNe Ib/Ic)mayrequire a close
binary companion.
7.1.3 Electron-Capture Supernovae in Close Binaries
Another mass range where binary interactions can drastically change the final fate of a massive
star is near the minimum mass for stars to explode as supernovae (around M⊙, where the exact
value depends on the amount of convective overshooting and the metallicity of the star). Single
stars in this mass range experience a second dredge-up phase when they ascend the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB), where a large fraction ofthe H-exhausted core is dredge-upand mixed with

Schematic comparison of the helium-core-burning phase of stars with (left) and without a hydro-

without a hydrogen envelope produce smaller He-exhausted cores with a larger C/O fraction. This
makes them more likely to ultimately collapse to a neutron star instead of a black hole
the envelope. This reduces the core mass at the end of the AGB phase; as a consequence, single
stars as massive as 10/11 M⊙probably produce ONeMg white dwarfs rather than a supernova.
In contrast, if such stars lose their H-rich envelopes due to a binary interaction before reaching
the AGB, they end up with much larger He cores and are likely to produce an electron-capture
(e-capture) supernova (see >Sect. 7.2 for further discussion) (>Fig. 14-15).
To summarize the effects of binary interactions on the final fate of stars, >Table 14-2 con-
trasts the expected differences for stars in single systems/wide binaries (which includes case C
systems) to stars in close binaries.
7.2 The Diversity of Supernova Explosions
As has already become clear from the discussion so far, there is more to supernovae than just
two standard explosion types. This section summarizes all the main explosion types presently
being considered (>Table 14-3).
7.2.1 Neutron Stars
Iron Core Collapse
The collapse of a massive iron core to a neutron star, leading to a neutrino-driven explosion
(see >Sect. 2.1), is the expected standard fate for the majority of massive stars, both single and
binary. The typical supernova energy of these explosions is ∼J, as set by the binding energy
of the inner part of the ejecta.

Electron-Capture (E-Capture) Supernovae
A neutron star can also form by the collapse of a very degenerate ONeMg core, long before
an iron core has developed. This is the expected fate for stars around ∼10 M⊙. In this case, the
collapse is triggered by the sudden capture of electrons onto Ne and Mg nuclei taking away
the hydrostatic support provided by the degenerate electrons (Nomoto 1984). This occurs at a
characteristic density (∼.× kg m−; Podsiadlowski et al. 2005), which can be related to a
critical pre-collapse mass for the ONeMg core of ∼.M⊙. Since, in this case, most of the core
collapses to form a low-mass neutron star (around .M⊙), relatively little energy is needed
to eject the remainder of the star; the resulting supernova is therefore expected to be of rela-
tively low energy (∼J) and may produce a neutron star with a relatively low kick velocity

(unlike the case of Fe-core collapse; see > Sect. 8.6 for further discussion). The supernova
that produced the Crab supernova in 1054 may provide an example for this type of explosion
(Nomoto et al. 1982).
It should also be noted that an e-capture supernova can also occur in an accreting binary,
where an accreting ONeMg white dwarf passes the threshold for the e-capture instability (so-
called accretion-induced collapse [AIC]), or in the case of the merger of two white dwarfs of
various different types (CO+CO, ONeMg+He, ONeMg+CO or even ONeMg+ONeMg [if pos-
sible]; so-called merger-induced collapse ([MIC]). These channels could produce as many as
∼10% of all neutron stars.
Magnetars
If the collapse of a massive star produces a rapidly rotating, magnetic neutron star, a magnetar,
the rapid spin-down of this magnetar could potentially power a very energetic explosion on
timescales of days to weeks (this is the neutron-star analogue to the collapsar model). As this
would allow the extraction of a large fraction of the rotational energy of a neutron star, this
could produce an extremely energetic supernova (see, e.g., Kasen and Bildsten 2010).
7.2.2 Black Holes
Prompt or Fallback Collapse
The formation of a black hole is probably rather unspectacular if no rotation is involved. If a
black hole forms promptly, essentially most of the star is expected to collapse into the black
hole. If a weak outward going shock is formed initially but does not succeed to eject the whole
core, a black hole can form in a delayed manner by fallback of the non-ejected core. In the first
case, no supernova is expected, while the latter may produce a faint supernova if some of the
envelope can be ejected. As this is the expected fate for massive single stars that form black
holes, this implies that as many as 10% of core collapses may not be accompanied by a bright
supernova event.
Collapsars and Jet-Driven Explosions
On the other hand, in the collapse of a rapidly rotating core (i.e., in the collapsar
model; > Sect. 6.6.1), a large fraction of the binding energy of the compact object can be

726 14
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts
extracted driving the powerful explosions often associated with long-duration GRBs. Even
without a GRB, such jet-driven explosions could produce very energetic explosions (i.e., hyper-
novae or broad-lined SNe Ic).
7.2.3 Thermonuclear Explosions
Type Ia Supernovae
The thermonucler runaway in a CO white dwarf as it approaches the Chandrasekhar mass is
the standard model for SNe Ia (>Sect. 2.2).
He Detonations
If a helium shell detonates in an accreting white dwarf, this can lead to a rather bright explosion
and could easily be mistaken for a faint supernova (Nomoto 1982). Indeed, as such detonations
produce elements similar to a SN Ia, they may resemble a SN Ia and are therefore now some-
times referred to as SNe .Ia (note the period). The main difference is that the underlying CO
white dwarf is likely to survive. On the other hand, if the helium detonation drives a sufficiently
strong shock into the CO core, this could trigger a second detonation near the core, a carbon
detonation, which would then destroy the whole white dwarf and produce a SN Ia-like event.
Such double-detonation models are an alternative scenario for SNe Ia; they have the additional
advantage that they could also occur in CO white dwarfs below the Chandrasekharmass, which
are statistically much more common (see Woosley and Weaver 1994; Fink et al. 2010).
Pair-Instability Supernovae
There is another type of thermonuclear runaway that can occur in very massive oxygen cores
when the core temperature becomes high enough (≳K) that electron-positron pairs form
abundantly. This leads to the conversion of internal energy into the rest-mass energy of the
pairs and reduces the central thermal pressure support. As such cores are radiation-pressure
supported and are ony marginally stable to start out with, this decreases the average adiabatic
index below the critical value of 4/3, triggering a partial collapse of the core. This accelerates
the rate of oxygen burning and leads to a thermonuclear runaway that in most cases is expected
to completely destroy the star. This type of supernova requires a very massive helium core after
H-core burning (≳60 M⊙) which corresponds to an initial main-sequence mass of ∼140 M⊙
(Heger and Woosley 2002), if there is no mass loss. If the He core is too massive (≳130 M⊙
corresponding to a main-sequence mass of ∼260 M⊙), the photodisintegration of heavy nuclei
becomes important. This involves endothermic reactions that completely use up the energy
produced by oxygen burning, preventing it from reversing the initial collapse and ultimately
leading to a collapse of the whole core to a rather massive black hole.
Even though the physics of this explosion mechanism has been well understood for a long
time (Rakavy et al. 1967), pair-instability supernovae have traditionally not been considered
important at solar metallicity. Even if such massive progenitor stars were able to form, the
wind mass loss on the main sequence would prevent the formation of a sufficiently massive He
core. Langer et al. (2007) estimate that the maximum allowed metallicity for a pair-instability
supernova is 1/3 solar. A pair-instability supernova could be extremely bright as several M⊙
(perhaps even more than 10 M⊙) of radioactive Ni can be produced in such an event.
At Population III metallicity, these could, in principle, be the dominant source of Fe. How-
ever, detailed nucleosynthesis models also predict a strong odd-even effect in the nuclear

abundance pattern, where nuclei with even nuclear charge are much more abundant than those
with odd charge (Heger and Woosley 2002). This would produce a nucleosynthetic imprint that
is not actually observed. This implies that pair-instability supernovae cannot be so common to
make a major contribution to the global nucleosynthesis.
A good candidate for a pair-instability supernova is SN 2007bi (Gal-Yam et al. 2009), a SN
Ic with an ejecta mass estimated as ∼100 M⊙and a Ni mass ≳3 M⊙. It also occurred in a small
dwarf galaxy, consistent with a low-metallicity progenitor.
7.3 Rotation and Magnetic Fields
Massive stars tend to be rapid rotators. In order for rotation to be dynamically important, the
rotation rate has to be quite close to critical rotation (i.e., close to break-up) which stars rarely
achieve except sometimes in their outer layers. This is particularly true for stars in binaries
which can be spun up by accretion from a companion star or by merging with a companion.
Apart from changing the appearance ofa star(e.g., due torotational flattening causing a nonuni-
form surface temperaturedistribution), the main effect of rotation is to cause additional mixing
within the star (e.g., due to baroclinic instabilities). This can mix nuclear-processed material to
the surface, a tell-tale sign of rapid rotation. For single stars, rotation is most important on the
main sequence, as massive stars are very efficient in losing their angular momentum, mainly
in the form of stellar winds that carry away mass and angular momentum. In addition, it is
now believed that, if a star is differentially rotating, even small seed magnetic fields are ampli-
fied causing efficient redistribution of angular momentum inside a star and driving the rotation
profile toward solid-body rotation (Heger et al. 2005). This is the reason why the cores of most
massive stars are unlikely to be rotating rapidly at the time of core collapse, consistent with
the fact that newborn radio pulsars appear not to be rotating near breakup. Therefore, the main
effect of rotation in single stars is to increase the final mass of the H-exhausted core at the end of
the main sequence. Effectively, after its main-sequence phase, a rapidly rotating star will behave
similar to a more massive star that has lost a larger fraction of its envelope (i.e., has a larger ratio
of core mass to total mass).
However, if a main-sequence star is rotating extremely rapidly, rotational mixing can be
so efficient that it keeps the star almost homogeneously mixed; this will drastically change its
evolution as such a star evolves toward the blue and is effectively converted into a Wolf-Ray-type
star even without any mass loss (Maeder 1987). This is shown in >Fig. 14-16, which shows the
evolution of a 40 M⊙with slow and with rapid rotation. Since such homogeneously evolving
stars avoid a red-supergiant phase and the strong mass loss experienced in this phase, they
may retain a much larger fraction of their initial angular momentum and may still have rapidly
rotating cores at the time of the supernova. This makes them potential candidates for LGRBs in
the collapsar model (see >Sect. 6.6.1).
7.4 Metallicity
The main effects of metallicity are to change the opacity and the mass-loss rate of a star.
A lower metallicity will generally lower the opacity of the star (this is particularly true for
low- and intermediate-mass stars), making them more luminous and shortening their life-
times. One consequence of this is that it changes the thermodynamic structure of the core

⊡Fig. 14-16
Hertzsprung–Russell diagram illustrating the bifurcation of the evolution of a 40 M⊙with slow and
rapid rotation. Because of its almost homogeneous evolution, the rapidly rotating star evolves to
the blue and avoids a red-supergiant phase. The blue curve shows the zero-age main sequence for
massive stars with several masses indicated (Figure adapted from Maeder (1987))
of a star. For example, the core of a 5 M⊙AGB star at a typical globular-cluster metallicity
(with Z ≃.) is similar to the core of a 7 M⊙star at solar metallicity. This implies that the
initial-mass limits, shown in >Table 14-2, have to be shifted accordingly.
Since heavy elements play an important role in driving mass loss from stars, the wind mass-
loss rate is a strong function of metallicity (typically ˙M ∝Z.). One implication of this is that
lower-Z stars do not only lose less mass but also less angular momentum (see >Sect. 6.6.1); this
makes it more likely that a low-Z star still has a rapidly rotating core at the time of explosion,
which could explain why LGRBs appear to favor low-Z environments. Also, because of the
lower mass loss, the most massive stars may end with much more massive cores. This makes
pair-instability supernovae more likely at low Z as it is mainly determined by the core mass at
the beginning of O burning.
Finally, for metal-free stars (so-called population III stars), the whole evolution of a massive
star is drastically altered, as, e.g., on the main sequence nuclear burning has to take place via
the pp cycle rather than the standard CNO cycle.
7.5 Dynamical Interactions
A significant fraction of stars are found in globular clusters which means that direct dynamical
interactions can be important. This maybe particularly true for massive stars that are often born
in a cluster-type environment. Dynamical interactions (such as tidal captures, direct collisions,
and exchange interactions) are likely to enhance certain evolutionary channels (e.g., mergers of
degenerate objects) and may even produce new types of stars that cannot be found elsewhere

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts 14
729
(not even in binaries). A particular example are runaway collisions at the center of clusters
that may produce much more massive stars than can ordinarily be formed; the Pistol star in
the Quintuplet cluster near the Galactic center, one of the most massive stars known in our
Galaxy, is a potential candidate. The maximum mass that can be built up in this way is a strong
function of the mass loss the object experiences between merger events, which will be strongly
enhanced. With realistic mass loss prescriptions, it presently seems difficult to form extremely
massive stars at least at solar metallicity (see Gleebeek et al. 2009).

Current Topics
At the moment, we are in a golden epoch for supernova research as current all-sky surveys, such
as the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), Pan-STARRS, and Skymapper, continue to discover
more and more supernova types and subtypes. In this last section, I will discuss a selection of
the topics that are considered “hot” at the present time, a list that undoubtedly will grow in the
near future.
8.1 The Diversity of SN Ia Progenitors
Some of the recent PTF supernovae have provided some important constraints on the progeni-
tors of fairly normal SNe Ia, strongly suggesting that there is more than one progenitor channel:
while PTF 11kx clearly must have occurred in a binary with a hydrogen-rich donor star (most
likely a giant; Dilday et al. 2012), such a companion can firmly be ruled out in the case of SN
2011fe/PTF 11kly (Li et al. 2011). But there are even more unusual SNe Ia. The supernova SNLS-
03D3bb provided the first example of a new class of SNe Ia where the exploding white dwarf
appears to have a mass well in excess of the Chandrasekhar mass (once the mass in all the
elements in the ejecta has been added up; Howell et al. 2006). This is possible in principle if
the white dwarf is rotating rapidly as this can increase the critical mass up to M⊙and above
(e.g., Yoon and Langer 2005a). Alternatively, these “super-Chandrasekhar” SNe Ia could be the
result of the direct dynamical merger of two rather massive CO white dwarfs.
8.2 Superluminous Supernovae
One of the major recent surprises has been the discovery of a class of unusually luminous super-
novae. The first one of these reported was SN 2006gy which had a peak absolute magnitude of
−22, much brighter than a typical SN Ia with a peak magnitude of −19. There is now a whole
class of such supernovae, most of them hydrogen-free, reaching peak magnitudes of almost −23
(see, e.g., Quimby et al. 2011). One early suggestion was that their lightcurves could be powered
by the decay of several solar masses of radioactive Ni, as can be produced in a pair-instability
supernova (see >Sect. 7.2). However, their late lightcurves do not show the expected exponen-
tial decay ruling out this possibility. It should be noted that a very luminous lightcurve does
not necessarily imply a very energetic explosion as, in a typical explosion, only a small fraction
of the kinetic energy in the explosion is radiated away in the first few years after a supernova.

730 14
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts
Indeed, if a supernova is surrounded by a very dense medium or a shell with a mass compa-
rable to the ejecta mass, the ejecta can, in principle, be slowed down on a timescale of less
than a year, rapidly converting kinetic energy into thermal energy and radiation, i.e., power the
lightcurve by the interaction with the medium. Alternatively, such supernovae could be pow-
ered by a long-lived central engine, such as a magnetar (see >Sect. 7.2). These superluminous
supernovae, which one should be able to detect up to a large redshift (z ≳), must be very rare
and therefore require very special circumstances. Probably, only 1 in massive stars end their
lives in a superluminous supernova.
8.3 Supernovae with a Circumstellar Medium
A significant fraction of supernovae (perhaps as many as 6%) appear to explode surrounded
by a dense medium, indicating that they ejected a large amount of mass very recently before
the explosion. These are generally classified as IIn or IIa supernovae (see >Sect. 3.2) and may
include both core-collapse and thermonuclear explosions. More surprisingly, there may even
be some evidence that some explode in a luminous-blue variable (LBV) phase (reminiscent
of the great outburst of η Carinae; e.g., SN 2005gj (Trundle et al. 2008)). The latter would
be very surprising as this is not consistent with the theoretically expected evolution of very
massive stars that are expected to encounter the LBV instability near the end or just after the
main-sequence phase. At this stage, they are assumed to lose their H-rich envelopes in a series
of LBV outbursts and spend most of their remaining evolution (at least several year) as
Wolf-Rayet stars. If single massive stars were able to explode in an LBV phase, all evolutionary
models for massive stars existing today would have to be discarded. However, as most massive
stars are in relatively close binaries, there may be a simple alternative solution. As discussed
in > Sect. 7.1, if a massive star that has left the main sequence before it accretes matter or
merges with a massive companion star, its subsequent evolution can be drastically altered. In
particular, it will spend most of its helium core-burning phase as a blue supergiant and may
only encounter the LBV instability after this phase, when its remaining lifetime will typically
be less than a few year; such a star could easily still be in an LBV phase at the time of the
explosion.
8.4 Supernovae in the Middle of Nowhere
Traditionally, supernova searches have targeted large galaxies introducing some serious obser-
vational biases. This has changed somewhat with the recent advent of untargeted, all-sky
surveys. Supernovae are now also regularly found in small galaxies and – more surprisingly –
far away from any galaxy. These supernovae often have quite distinct properties. One example
is SN 2005E, a faint Ib supernova in the halo of a nearby galaxy (Perets et al. 2010). This super-
nova is also very rich in Ca, making it a prototype for a new supernova class. Since the estimated
ejecta mass is very small (only ∼0.3 M⊙), it is not even clear whether this is a proper supernova
or related to explosive helium burning on a white dwarf (see >Sect. 7.2). Alternatively, it could
be a hybrid supernova, part core collapse, part thermonuclear. For example, the merger of an
ONeMg white dwarf with a He white dwarf could lead to the collapse the ONeMg core to a
neutron star (in an e-capture supernova; >Sect. 7.2) which triggers explosive burning of the

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts 14
731
helium envelope which in turn powers the explosion. Even though this would technically be
classified as a core-collapse supernovae, the explosion would be driven by the thermonuclear
runaway.
A second example is PTF10ops, a subluminous SN Ia, that occurred in the middle of
nowhere (Maguire et al. 2011). Even though clearly a SN Ia, it is an unusual one that does not
fit the standard SN Ia peak magnitude – lightcurve width relation.
Why are these supernovae so far away from a major galaxy? Just because these channels
require “old” progenitors? Or were the explosions delayed because they involved the merger of
two white dwarfs where the delay time is determined by the gravitational radiation timescale
that drives the system together? One should also consider the possibility that these events
occur in globular clusters in the halo of galaxies, which for these supernovae would be unde-
tectable, and that these unusual supernovaeare somehow connected to their unusual dynamcial
environment.
8.5 Faint and Failed Supernovae
Single massive stars (≳20–25 M⊙) are expected to form black holes, either promptly or by fall-
back. These are unlikely to be associated with a bright supernova event. Perhaps in many cases,
there is no supernova at all (a “failed” supernova). This means that a star, in most cases probably
a Wolf-Rayet star, should suddenly disappear. While it is difficult to detect such “disappearing
stars,” with modern large-scale surveys this is not impossible (see, e.g., Kochanek et al. 2008).
8.6 Supernova Kicks
Young, single radio pulsars are observed to have a large space motion relative to their parent
populations which is best described by a Mawellian distribution with a velocity dispersion of
265 km s−(Hobbs et al. 2005). This implies that these single neutron stars must have received
a large kick when they were born in a supernova, which provides an important clue to the
supernova mechanism. At present, the most promising explanation for these kicks in the
delayed neutrino-driven explosion scenario (>Sect. 2.1) is an instability in the accretion shock
around a proto-neutron star, the so-called SASI instability (“standing accretion-shock insta-
bility”), which causes a wobbling of the core, imparting momentum in the process (see, e.g.,
Blondin and Mezzacappa 2007; Foglizzo et al. 2007). In order for this instability to be able
to grow sufficiently, the delay between the initial formation of the proto-neutron star and the
initiation of a “successful” explosion has to be ≳500 ms (i.e., hundreds of dynamical times), con-
sistent with the most promising models of Fe core collapse to date. On the other hand, in the
case of an e-capture supernova (>Sect. 7.2), where the binding energy of the inner part of the
ejecta is very small, the explosion is expected to occur with a much shorter delay (e.g., Kitaura
et al. 2006), suggesting that this will produce at best a moderate kick. Since e-capture super-
novae are more likely to occur in binary systems, this could explain why neutron stars in close
binary sometimes appear to have received a much smaller kick than the majority of their single
counterparts (Podsiadlowski et al. 2004b).

Stellar Winds 15

Abstract:
A “stellar wind” is the continuous, supersonic outflow of matter from the surface
layers of a star. Our sun has a solar wind, driven by the gas-pressure expansion of the hot
(T > K) solar corona. It can be studied through direct in situ measurement by interplan-
etary spacecraft; but analogous coronal winds in more distant solar-type stars are so tenuous
and transparent that that they are difficult to detect directly. Many more luminous stars have
winds that are dense enough to be opaque at certain wavelengths of the star’s radiation, making
it possible to study their wind outflows remotely through careful interpretation of the observed
stellar spectra. Red giant stars show slow, dense winds that may be driven by the pressure from
magnetohydrodyanmic waves. As stars with initial mass up to M⊙evolve toward the Asymp-
totic Giant Branch (AGB), a combination of stellar pulsations and radiative scattering off dust
can culminate in “superwinds” that strip away the entire stellar envelope, leaving behind a hot
white dwarf stellar core with less than the Chandrasekhar mass of ∼.M⊙. The winds of hot,
luminous, massive stars are driven by line-scattering of stellar radiation, but such massive stars
can also exhibit superwind episodes, either as Red Supergiants or Luminous Blue Variable stars.
The combined wind and superwind mass loss can strip the star’s hydrogen envelope, leaving
behind a Wolf-Rayet star composed of the products of earlier nuclear burning via the CNO
cycle. In addition to such direct effects on a star’s own evolution, stellar winds can be a sub-
stantial source of mass, momentum, and energy to the interstellar medium, blowing open large
cavities or “bubbles” in this ISM, seeding it with nuclear processed material, and even helping
trigger the formation of new stars, and influencing their eventual fate as white dwarves or core-
collapse supernovae. This chapter reviews the properties of such stellar winds, with an emphasis
on the various dynamical driving processes and what they imply for key wind parameters like
the wind flow speed and mass loss rate.
1
Introduction and Background
The Sun and other stars are commonly characterized by the radiation they emit. But one of
the great astronomical discoveries of the latter half of the past century was the realization that
nearly all stars lose mass through a more or less continuous surface outflow called a “stellar
wind.” While it was long apparent that stars could eject material in dramatic outbursts like
novae or supernovae, the concept of continuous mass loss in the relatively quiescent phases
of a star’s evolution stems in large part from the direct in situ detection by interplanetary space-
craft of a high-speed, supersonic outflow from the sun. For this solar wind, the overall rate of
mass loss is quite modest, roughly −M⊙/yr, which, even if maintained over the sun’s entire
main sequence lifetime of ca. year, would imply a cumulative loss of only a quite negligible
.% of its initial mass. By contrast, other stars – and indeed even the sun in its later evolu-
tionary stages as a cool giant – can have winds that over time substantially reduce the star’s
mass, with important consequences for its evolution and ultimate fate (de Koter et al. 2008;
Maeder and Meynet 2000; Leer et al. 1982; Vink 2008; Willson 2008). Moreover, the associ-
ated input of mass, momentum, and energy into the interstellar medium can have significant
consequences, forming visually striking nebulae and windblown “bubbles” (Castor et al. 1975),
and even playing a feedback role in bursts of new star formation that can influence the overall
structure and evolution of the parent galaxy (Oey and Clark 2007). In recent years, the general
concept of a continuous “wind” has even been extended to describe outflows with a diverse

range of conditions and scales, ranging from stellar accretion disks (Calvet 2004), to Active
Galactic Nuclei (Proga 2007), to even whole galaxies (Breitschwerdt and Komossa 2000).
In the half-century since this concept of a wind from the sun or stars took hold, there has
amassed a vast literature – consisting of thousands of journal papers, roughly a hundred confer-
ence proceedings, dozens of review articles, and even a handful of books – on various aspects of
solar and stellar wind mass loss. It is neither feasible nor desirable to attempt any comprehen-
sive survey of this literature, and interested readers looking for entry points beyond the topical
coverage here are encouraged to begin with a few key complementary reviews and books. For
the solar wind, the original monograph Interplanetary Dynamics by Parker (1963) provides a
still relevant and fundamental basis, while the recent Basics of the Solar Wind by Meyer-Vernet
(2007) gives an accessible modern summary. Particularly insightful reviews include those by
Leer et al. (1982), Parker (1991), and Cranmer (2009). Proceedings of the regular series of ded-
icated solar wind conferences, the most recent being Solar Wind 12 (Maksimovic et al. 2010),
also make a good entry point into the evolving solar wind literature. For stellar winds, the text
by Lamers and Cassinelli (1999) provides a good general introduction, while more targeted
reviews tend to split between those focused on hot, massive stars (Owocki 2001, 2004; Puls
et al. 2008) vs. cool, low-mass giants (Holzer and MacGregor 1985; Holzer 1987; Willson 2000;
Dupree 2004).
This chapter aims to give a broad physical overview of the properties and processes involved
in solar and stellar wind mass loss. A general theme is to identify the forces and energies that can
overcome the gravitational binding that holds material onto a nearly hydrostatic stellar surface,
and thereby lift and accelerate the outermost layers into a sustained outflow through which
material ultimately escapes entirely the star’s gravitational potential. This competition between
outward driving and inward gravityis keytodetermining twobasicwind characteristics, namely
the mass loss late ˙M and terminal flow speed v∞.
Stellar wind mass loss rates span many decades, reaching more than a billion times that of
the solar wind, ˙M > −M⊙/yr, for luminous giant stars; the exact values depend crucially
on the specific wind driving mechanism. But for a wide range of driving mechanisms, a quite
general rule of thumb is that the wind terminal speed v∞scales in proportion to the escape
speed ve from the stellar surface. One intuitive way to think of the process is that in general the
outward driving mechanism tends to tune itself to siphon off just enough mass from the star to
keep the outward force an order-unity factor above gravity; the net effective “antigravity” means
wind material effectively “falls off” the star, reaching a final speed comparable to ve.
In practice, the proportionality factor can vary from about a third (for red giants) to about
factor three (for blue supergiants). Note that in the former case 90% of the energy to drive
the wind is expended in lifting the material out of the star’s gravitational potential, with the
remaining 10% expended in acceleration to the terminal flow speed; in the latter case, this rel-
ative allotment of energy is reversed. The total wind energy loss rate, Lwind ≡˙M(v
e + v
∞)/, is
typically only a tiny fraction of the star’s radiative luminosity, about −for the solar wind, and
ranging up to a few percent for winds from luminous, massive stars. During brief “superwind”
episodes of massive “Luminous Blue Variable” (LBV) stars, the radiative and wind luminosity
can even become comparable.
The specific driving mechanisms vary with the various types of stellar wind, which can be
broadly organized into three general classes:
1. Coronal Winds from the Sun and Other Cool, Main-Sequence Stars. These can be charac-
terized as thermally or gas pressure driven, with the main outward force to overcome gravity
stemming from the gas-pressure gradient associated with the high-temperaturecorona. The

Stellar Winds 15

key issues thus lie in understanding how mechanical energy generated in the near-surface
convection zone is transmitted upward (e.g., via wave oscillations in the magnetic field) to
heat and drive a high-temperature coronal expansion. While important as a prototype, and
because the earth itself is embedded in the solar coronal wind, the low ˙M means such coro-
nal winds have negligible direct effect on the star’s evolution. (On the other hand, the loss
of angular momentum in magnetized coronal winds does seem sufficient to cause an evo-
lutionary decline of rotation rates in the sun and other cool stars; Weber and Davis 1967;
Scholz 2009).
2. Winds from Cool Giants and Supergiants. The lower surface gravity of giant stars facilitates
much stronger, but slowerwind mass loss. Forexample, the slow (v∞∼–50 km/s), moder-
ately strong ( ˙M ∼−M⊙/yr) winds of Red Giants may be driven by the direct momentum
(vs. energy) addition of magnetic Alfvén waves. But in later evolutionary stages, stellar pul-
sations, perhaps augmented by radiative scattering on dust, can apparently induce a much
stronger, even runaway mass loss. Over the final few thousand years, this can reduce stars
with initial mass as high as 8 M⊙to a remnant white dwarf below the Chandrasekhar limit
of ∼.M⊙! Similarly, initially hot stars with M ≈−M⊙can evolve through a Red Super-
giant phase, with a strong mass loss that has important consequences for their subsequent
evolution and eventual demise as core-collapse supernovae (SN).
3. Winds from Hot, Massive, Luminous Stars. The high luminosity of hot, massive stars means
that the momentum of the light scattering off the electrons and ions in the atmosphere is by
itself able to overcome the gravity and drive winds with v∞∼(−)ve ∼, –3,000km/s
and ˙M ∼10−–10−M⊙/yr. As quantified in the so-called CAK (after Castor et al. 1975)
formalism, for winds from OB-type stars the essential coupling between radiative momen-
tum and gas is via line scattering by heavy, minor ions; regulation of the driving by line
saturation leads to relatively simple, analytic scaling laws for the dependence of mass loss
rate and flow speed on stellar parameters like luminosity, mass, and radius. In the subclass
known as Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars, the mass loss is so high that the stellar “photosphere” lies
in the wind itself, characterized now by strong wind-broadened emission lines of helium
and abundant heavy elements like carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen (CNO); in evolved WR stars
the depletion or absence of hydrogen indicates the mass loss has actually stripped away the
star’s original hydrogen envelope, exposing a core of material processed by various stages of
nuclear burning. This mass loss may also be augmented by Luminous Blue Variable (LBV)
phases characterized by eruptions or “superwinds” with mass loss rates up to 0.01–1 M⊙/yr
lasting several years or decades. The 1840-60 giant eruption of η Carinae provides a key
prototype.
Of these, the first and third have the more extensively developed theory, and as such will consti-
tute the major focus of detailed discussion below. For the second class, the reader is referred to
previous reviews (Holzer and MacGregor 1985; Holzer 1987; Willson 2000; Dupree 2004) and
references therein. (See, however, >Sect. 4.4 below.)
The next section ( > Sect. 2) summarizes the diagnostic methods and resulting inferred
general properties for these various classes of stellar wind. The following section ( > Sect. 3)
introduces the basic dynamical conservation equations governing wind outflow, which are then
applied ( > Sect. 4) to the gas-pressure-driven solar wind. The last two sections give a quite
extensive discussion of radiativelydriven mass loss from hot, massive,luminous stars, including
the CAK line-driving of OB winds (>Sect. 5), and the multiline-scattered winds of Wolf–Rayet
stars (>Sect. 6).

Observational Diagnostics and Inferred Properties
2.1 Solar Corona and Wind
The close proximity of the sun makes it possible to obtain high-resolution observations of the
complexmagneticstructure in the solaratmosphere and corona, while alsoflying interplanetary
spacecraft to measure in situ the detailed plasma and magnetic field properties of the resulting
solar wind. Even before the spacecraft era, early visual evidence that the sun has an outflowing
wind came from antisolar deflection of comet tails (Biermann 1951; >Fig. 15-1a), and from the
radial striations seen in eclipse photographs of the solar corona (Newkirk 1967; >Fig. 15-1b).
Nowadays, modern coronagraphs use an occulting disk to artificially eclipse the bright solar
surface, allowing ground- and space-based telescopes to make routine observations of the solar
corona.
> Figure 15-2a (from McComas et al. 1998) combines such coronagraphic images of the
inner and outer corona (taken respectively from the SOHO spacecraft, and from the solar obser-
vatory on Mauna Loa, Hawaii) with an extreme ultraviolet image of the solar disk (also from
SOHO), and a polar line plot of the latitudinal variation of solar wind speed (as measured by
the Ulysses spacecraft during its initial polar orbit of the sun). The equatorial concentration of
coronal brightness stems from confinement of coronal plasma by closed loops of magnetic field,
with the outer loops pulled into the radial “helmet” streamers by the outflow of the solar wind.
By contrast, the open nature of magnetic field lines over the poles allow material to flow freely
outward, making for reduced density coronal holes (Zirker 1977). A key point from >Fig. 15-2a
is that the solar wind arising from these polar coronal holes is much steadier and faster (about
750 km/s) than the equatorial, streamer-belt wind measured near the ecliptic (with speeds from

Two telescopic clues to the existence of the solar wind. Left: The dual tails of Comet Hale–Bopp.
The upper one here consists mostly of dust slowly driven away from the comet by solar radiation;
it is tilted from the antisun (radial) direction by the comet’s own orbital motion. The lower plasma
tail comes from cometary ions picked up by the solar wind; its more radial orientation implies that
the radial outﬂow of the solar wind must be substantially faster than the comet’s orbital speed.

corona, and an extreme ultraviolet image of the solar disk, all made on August 17, 1996, near the
minimum of the solar sunspot cycle. Right: X-ray images of the sun made by the Yokhoh satellite
from the 1991 solar maximum (left foreground) to the 1996 solar minimum (right background)
400 to 750 km/s). This provides a vivid illustration of how the magnetic structure of the corona
can have a profound influence on the resulting solar wind.
Early direct evidence for the very high coronal temperature came from eclipse observations
of emission lines from highly stripped ions of calcium and iron, the most prominent being
the Fe+“green” line at 5,303Å. This stripping of 13 electrons from iron arises from high-
energy collisions with free electrons, implying a characteristic electron temperaturearound one
and half million Kelvin (1.5 MK) in the dense, coronal loops that dominate the line emission.
Nowadays the high temperature of these coronal loops is most vividly illustrated by soft X-ray
images, such as those shown in >Fig. 15-2b from the observations by the Yokhoh satellite made
over the 1991–1996 declining phase of the sun’s 11-year magnetic activity cycle. Unfortunately,
the relative darkness of coronal holes means it is much more difficult to use emission lines and
X-rays to infer the temperature or other properties of these important source regions of the
solar wind.
Complementary studies with space-borne coronal spectrographs (such as the UVCS instru-
ment on SOHO; Kohl et al. 1995) use the strength and width of ultraviolet scattering lines to
infer the flow speed and kinetic temperatures of various ion species throughout the corona.
Results show the outflow speed in coronal holes already exceeds 100 km/s within a solar radius
from the surface; moreover, ion temperatures are even higher than for electrons, up to 4 MK for
protons, and 100 MK for oxygen! The recent, very comprehensive review of coronal holes by
Cranmer (2009) provides an extensive discussion of how these different temperatures may be
linked to the detailed mechanisms for heating the corona, e.g., by magnetic waves excited by
the complex convective motions of the solar atmosphere.
In situ measurements by Ulysses and many other interplanetary spacecraft show that the
solar wind mass flux (given by ρvr, the product of density, flow speed, and the square of the
local heliocentricradius)is remarkablyconstant, varying less than a factortwoin space and time

(Withbroe 1989). Ifextended overthe full sphere around the sun, the corresponding global mass
loss rate works out to ˙M ≈−× −M⊙/year. In the ecliptic plane, the typical flow speed
is v∞≈km/s, but it extends up to v∞≈km/s in both ecliptic and polar high-speed
streams that are thought to originate from coronal holes.
Finally, while many other cool, solar-type stars show clear signatures of magnetic activity
and hot, X-ray emitting coronae, any associated coronal type winds are simply too tenuous
and transparent to be detected directly by any absorption signatures in the spatially unresolved
stellar flux. In a handful of stars, there is evidence for an “astrosphere” (Wood 2004), the stellar
analog of the bullet-shaped heliospheric cavity carved out by the solar wind as the sun moves
through the local interstellarmedium. A wall of neutral hydrogen that forms around the nose of
this bullet can lead to a detectable hydrogen line absorption in the observed spectrum of stars
positioned so that their light passes through this wall on its way to earth. But apart from such
indirect evidence, most of what is inferred about coronal winds from other stars is based on
analogy or extrapolation of conditions from the much more detailed measurements of the sun’s
coronal wind.
2.2 Spectral Signatures of Dense Winds from Hot and Cool Stars
2.2.1 Opacity and Optical Depth
The much higher mass loss rates in stellar winds from both hot and cool giants make them
dense enough to become opaque in certain spectral bands, imparting detectable observational
signatures in the star’s flux spectrum that can be used to infer key wind conditions. The coupling
of wind material to stellar light can take various forms (Mihalas 1978), including:
•
Free-electron (Thomson) scattering
•
Free-free absorption and emission by electrons near ions
•
Bound-free (ionization) absorption and free-bound (recombination) emission by atoms or
molecules
•
Bound-bound (line) scattering, absorption, and/or emission by atoms or molecules
•
Scattering, absorption, and emission by dust grains
In parsing this list, it is helpful tofocus on some keydistinctions. Scattering involves a change
in direction of light without true absorption of its energy, while emission creates new light,
e.g., from the energy within the gas. Bound-bound processes lead to narrow wavelength features
in the spectrum, known as (absorption or emission) lines. Most other processes involve the
broad spectral continuum of stellar radiation, albeit with bound-free or free-bound edges at
the wavelength associated with the energies for ionization/recombination of the ion, or broad
variations due to wavelength dependence of the cross section, e.g., for dust.
In the context of determining stellar wind mass loss rates, a particularly key distinction
lies between single-body processes (e.g., electron scattering, bound-free absorption, or dust
scattering and absorption), and two-body processes involving both an ion and a free electron
(e.g., free-free absorption, and free-free or free-bound emission). The strength of the former
scales in proportion to the single density of the species involved, whereas the latter depend
on the product of the electron and ion density, and so have an overall density-squared depen-
dence. In a wind with a high degree of spatial clumping, such density-squared processes will
be enhanced over what would occur in a smooth flow by a clumping factor C f ≡
√
⟨ρ⟩/ ⟨ρ⟩,

where the square brackets represent volume averaging on a scale large compared to the clump
size. For a wind in which material is mostly in clumps filling only a fraction fv of the total vol-
ume, any mass loss rate diagnostic that scales with ρwill tend to overestimate the true mass
loss rate by about a factor C f = /
√
fv. Further details can be found in the proceedings of a
recent conference on wind clumping (Hamann et al. 2008).
Single-density continuum processes (e.g., electron scattering, bound-free absorption, or
dust scattering and absorption) can be characterized by the opacity, κ, which is effectively a cross
section per unit mass, with CGS units cm/g. The overall effectiveness of continuum absorption
or scattering by the wind depends on the associated optical depth from some surface radius R
to the observer. Along the radial direction r, this is given by the integral of the wind opacity κ
times density ρ(r),

The second, approximate equality here applies to the simple case of a steady, spherically sym-
metric wind with mass loss rate ˙M, and approximated for simplicity to flow at a constant speed
v∞. The last equality uses the shorthand ˙M−= ˙M/(−M⊙/yr) and v= v∞/(, km/s)
to give numerical scalings in terms of the opacity for electron scattering, which for a fully ion-
ized medium with standard hydrogen mass fraction, X = ., has a CGS value κe = .(+X) =
.cm/g. For example, electron scattering in the solar wind has τ∗≈−, confirming it
is very transparent. But the winds from Wolf–Rayet stars, with a billion times higher ˙M, can
become optically thick, even to electron scattering.
For the strong, slow winds from cool giants, the fraction of free electrons becomes small,
but the cool, dense conditions often allow molecules and even dust to form. Spherical dust of
radius a, mass md, density ρd has a physical cross section σ = md/aρd; conversion of a mass
fraction Xd of wind material into dust thus implies an overall opacity κd = Xd/aρd. For
standard (solar) abundances, Xd ≈× −, and since ρd ∼g/cm(most dust would almost
float in water), it is seen see that for dust grains with typical size a ≈.μ, the correspond-
ing opacity is of order κd ≈cm/g, several hundred times greater than for free-electron
scattering.
This geometric cross section only applies to wavelengths much smaller than the dust
size, λ ≪
a; for λ ≥
a, the associated dust opacity decreases as κd(λ) ∼(λ/a)−β,
where β = for simple Rayleigh scattering from smooth spheres of fixed size a. In prac-
tice, the complex mixtures in sizes and shapes of dust typically lead to a smaller effective
power index, β ≈–2. Still, the overall inverse dependence on wavelength means that winds
that are optically thick to dust absorption and scattering can show a substantially reddened
spectrum.
Moreover, the energy from dust-absorbed optical light is generally reemitted in the infrared
(IR), at wavelengths set by the dust temperature through roughly the standard Wien’s law
for peak emission of a blackbody, λ = .μm/ (T/1,000 K). For typical dust temperatures
of several hundreds to a thousand degrees, this gives a strong IR excess in emission peak-
ing in the 3–10 μm range. Such IR excess signatures of wind dust are seen in very cool-giant
stars, particularly the so-called Carbon stars, but also in the much hotter Carbon-type Wolf–
Rayet stars, known as WC stars. A good overview of dust opacity and emission is given by
Li (2005).

2.2.2 Doppler-Shifted Line Absorption
It is much more common for winds to become optically thick to line absorption or scattering
that results from transitions between two bound levels of an atom (including ions), or molecule.
Because this is a resonant process, the associated cross sections and opacities can be much
larger than from free-electron scattering, enhanced by factor that depends on the “quality” of
the resonance.1 For atomic transitions, classical calculations (i.e., without quantum mechan-
ics) show the resonance enhancement factor is given roughly by q = Aλo/re, where A is the
mass abundance fraction of the atom, λo is the photon wavelength for the line transition, and
re = e/mec= .× −cm is the classical radius for electron charge e and mass me (Gayley
1995). For ultraviolet line transitions with λo ≈nm and from abundant ions with A ≈−,
we find q ≈.
As measured in the rest frame of the ion, this line opacity is confined to a very narrow
range around the resonant wavelength λo. But the Doppler shift from the ion’s random thermal
motion gives lines a finite Doppler width ΔλD = λovth/c, where for ions with atomic mass mi
and temperature T, the thermal speed vth =
√
kT/mi. For typical observed ions of carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO) in a hot-star wind with temperatures a few times K, we find
vth ≈km/s.
In a stellar wind with flow speed v ≈, km/s ≫vth, the Doppler shift from the wind flow
completely dominates this thermal broadening. As illustrated in >Fig. 15-3, a stellar photon of
wavelength λ < λo −ΔλD emitted radially from the star thus propagates freely through the wind
until reaching a location where the wind speed v has shifted the line into resonance with the

Two perspectives for the Doppler-shifted line resonance in an accelerating ﬂow. Right: Photons
with a wavelength just shortward of a line propagate freely from the stellar surface up to a layer
where the wind outﬂow Doppler shifts the line into a resonance over a narrow width (Represented
here by the shading) equal to the Sobolev length, set by the ratio of thermal speed to velocity
gradient, lSob ≡vth/(dv/dr). Left: Seen from successively larger radii within the accelerating wind,
the Doppler shift sweeps out an increasingly broadened line-absorption trough blueward of line

o ≡λo(−v/c) .
(15.2)
The width of this resonance is given by lSob = vth/(dv/dr), known as the Sobolev length,
after the Russian astrophysicist V. V. Sobolev, who first developed the theory for line radia-
tion transport in such high-speed outflows (Sobolev 1957, 1960). For a wind of terminal speed
v∞from a star of radius R, a characteristic velocity gradient is dv/dr ≈v∞/R, implying
lSob/R ≈vth/v∞≈.≪, and so showing this Sobolev line resonance is indeed quite sharp
and narrow.
The Sobolev approximation assumes a narrow-line limit vth →to derive localized, analytic
solutions for the line transport, using the fact that the opacity then becomes nearly a δ-function
about the local resonant wavelength, κ(λ) = qκeδ(λ/λo −+ v/c). For wavelengths from line
center λo to a blue-edge λ∞≡λo(−v∞/c), the associated wind optical depth then becomes

where in the second equality the wind quantities are to be evaluated at the relevant resonance

(15.5)
The latter equality in ( > 15.5) emphasizes that this line optical depth is a factor qc/v∞larger
than the continuum optical depth for electron scattering, as given by (> 15.1). For strong lines
(q ≈, ), and even for moderately fast winds with v∞≈, km/s, this enhancement
factor can be several millions. For winds with v∞≈, km/s and R ≈cm, such strong
lines would be optically thick for mass loss rates as low as ˙M ∼−M⊙/yr; for dense winds
with ˙M ∼−M⊙/yr, strong lines can be very optically thick, with τo ∼!
Defining a wind-scaled wavelength displacement from line center, x ≡(c/v∞) (λ/λo −),
( > 15.4) gives the very simple wavelength scaling, τ(x) = τo/(−x). For a simple “point-
source” model (which ignores the finite size of the star and so assumes that all radiation is
radially streaming), this predicts the observed stellar flux spectrum should show a blueward
line-absorption trough of the form,
F(x) = Fce−τo/∣x∣;
−< x < ,
(15.6)
where Fc is the stellar continuum flux far away from the line. (For the somewhat more general
velocity law v(r) = v∞(−R/r)β, the optical depth scaling becomes τ(x) = τo/β∣x∣−/β.)
2.2.3 Asymmetric P-Cygni Proﬁles from Scattering Lines
Strong spectral lines often tend to scatter rather than fully absorb stellar radiation, and this leads
to the emergent line profile developing a very distinctive form known as a “P-Cygni profile,”

Schematic illustration of the formation of a P-Cygni type line proﬁle in an expanding wind outﬂow
after the star P Cygni for which its significance as a signature of mass outflow was first broadly
recognized.
> Figure 15-4 illustrates the basic principles for formation of such a P-Cygni line profile.
Wind material approaching an observer within a column in front of the star has its line reso-
nance blueshifted by the Doppler effect. Thus scattering of stellar radiation out of this direction
causes an absorption trough on the blue side of the line profile, much as described in the simple,
pure-absorption analysis given above. However, from the lobes on either side of this absorption
column, wind material can also scatter radiation toward the observer. Since this can occur from
either the approaching or receding hemisphere, this scattered radiation can be either blueshifted
or redshifted. The associated extra flux seen by the observer thus occurs as a symmetric emis-
sion component on both sides of the line center. Combined with the reduced blue-side flux, the
overall profile has a distinctly asymmetric form, with apparent net blueward absorption and
redward emission.
Derivations of the full equations are given, e.g., in Mihalas (1978) and Lamers and Cassinelli
(1999), but a brief outline of the quantitative derivation is as follows.
First, the above point-star computation of the absorption trough from stellar light scattered
out of the line of sight to the observer must now be generalized to account for rays parallel to
the radial ray to the observer, but offset by a distance p, with ≤p ≤R. Denoting z as the
coordinate along such rays, with z = at the midplane where the rays come closest the star’s
center, then the optical depth from the star (at z∗=

The resonance condition is now vz(zres) ≡c(−λ/λo) = −v∞x, with the ray projection of the
radial wind speed given by vz = μv, where μ = z/

z+ p. Written in terms of the wind-scaled
wavelength x (≡(c/v∞)(λ/λo −)), the observed direct intensity is thus attenuated from the
stellar surface value,
Idir(p, x) = Ice−τ(p,x) ,
(15.8)

For the scattered, emission component, the formal solution of radiative transfer (Mihalas
1978) takes a purely local form within the Sobolev approximation,
Iscat(p, x) = S (−e−τ(p,x)) ,
(15.10)
where the source function S for pure-scattering is given by the wavelength- and angle-averaged
mean intensity, customarily denoted ¯J. In static atmospheres, computing this source function
requires a global solution of the line scattering, but in an expanding wind, methods developed
by Sobolev (1960) allow it to be computed in terms of purely local “escape probabilities.” Overall,
the radial scaling follows roughly the optically thin form for diluted core radiation Sthin = WIc,
where the dilution factor W ≡(−μ∗)/, with μ∗≡

is then computed from integration over all suitable rays,

Iscat(p, x) p dp ,
(15.11)
where pmin = R for red-side wavelengths (λ > λo) that scatter from the back hemisphere that
is occulted by the star, and pmin = otherwise.
The total observed flux, F(x) = Fdir(x) + Fscat(x), combines the blueshifted absorption of
the direct component plus the symmetric emission of the scattered component, yielding then
the net asymmetry of the P-Cygni profile shown in >Fig. 15-4 and >Fig. 15-5.
The quantitative fitting of observed line profiles often uses the so-called SEI (Sobolev with
Exact Integration) method (Lamers et al. 1987; Groenewegen and Lamers 1989), in which the
Sobolev approximation is only used for computation of the scattering source function, which
as a wavelength- and angle-averaged quantity tends to cancel errors associated with the finite
width of the line resonance. However, because microturbulence in a stellar wind can effectively
broaden that resonance to many (factor ten or more) times the thermal value vth ≈km/s, an
exact integration over depth is used for the formal solution of line transfer.
Measurements of the blue-edge of a strong absorption trough immediately gives the wind
terminal speed. Moreover, if the line is detectable but not saturated (i.e., .< τo < ), then
the observed depth of the trough can in principal be used to infer ˙M, assuming one knows the
line opacity. In practice, uncertainties in the ionization fraction of prominent ions, which feed
directly into the opacity strength factor q, often limit the utility of this method.
But recent FUSE observations of UV lines from P+(a k a PV) have proven particularly
useful for inferring mass loss rates of O stars (Fullerton et al. 2006). Because PV is often nearly
the dominant ionization stage, the ionization correction is less uncertain. Moreover, the low
elemental abundance of phosphorus means that the lines, unlike those from more abundant
elements, are not generally saturated. Finally, in contrast to density-squared diagnostics, line

scattering is a single-density process, and so is not affected by the degree of wind clumping.
Indeed, mass loss rates inferred by this method tend to be substantially lower, by a factor of
10 or more, compared to those inferred from the density-squared diagnostics discussed in the
next subsections (Fullerton et al. 2006). The resolution of this mass loss discrepancy is matter
of much current research and discussion (see, e.g., Puls et al. 2006 and Hamann et al. 2008).
2.2.4 Wind-Emission Lines
In WR stars with very dense winds, the emergent spectrum is characterized by very broad
(>1,000 km/s Doppler width) emission lines from various ionization stages of abundant ele-
ments like He, N, C, and O. The recombination of an electron and ion generally occurs through
a downward cascade through the many bound levels of the ion, giving the bound-bound line
emission. The involvement of an ion plus free electron means this is one of the processes that
scale with the square of the gas density. In the narrow-line (Sobolev) approximation, the line
emissivity (energy per unit time, volume, and solid angle) at wind-scaled wavelength x and
from some wind radius with velocity v(r) is proportional to
η(x, r, μ) ∝ρδ(x + μv(r)/v∞) ,
(15.12)
where μ is the direction cosine for the emitted radiation relative to the local radial direction.
Integration over all directions μ then gives for the emission luminosity contribution from a

Thus each such shell produces a flat-top profile extending to x = ±v/v∞about line center. If the
ionization stage to produce the emission does not form until near the wind terminal velocity,
then the observed profile is indeed flat topped, with a half-width given by v∞.
But if the ion already forms at a lower radius with a velocity vmin < v∞, then the pro-
file exhibits a flat-topped center for ∣x∣< vmin/v∞, with tapered wings extending to x = ±
(see, e.g., Dessart and Owocki 2003). For example, for the case of the standard velocity law
v(r) = v∞(−R/r), the emission at ∣x∣> vmin/v∞depends on the integral,
L(x) ∝∫
ρr
v

x,
(15.16)
where the second integrand follows from mass continuity, and the third uses the fact that
Rdr/r= dv/v∞= −dx. We thus obtain the simple analytic result that the line wing tapers
off as log ∣x∣from each side of the inner flat top over ∣x∣< vmin/v∞.
Using this simple model, the right panel of >Fig. 15-6 plots a sample flat-top profile for
vmin/v∞= 0.5. The left panel of > Fig. 15-6 (taken from Lepine and Moffat 1999) shows a
corresponding observed profile, for the CIII line from the star WR 134. The observed half-width
of this emission line directly implies a wind speed of nearly 2,000 km/s for this star. Other WR
stars show half-widths that imply wind speeds in the range 1,000–3,000 km/s.
Since the emission strength is proportional to ρ∼˙M, careful modeling of the expanding
wind and atmosphere can in principal enable one to use the observed strength of emission lines
to also estimate the stellar mass loss rate. But such estimates depend on the wind velocity law,
and, as noted above, on the degree of wind clumping (Hamann 1996; Hillier and Miller 1999;
Hamann et al. 2003; Hillier 2003; Puls et al. 2006).
For O stars, a key mass loss rate diagnostic is the Balmer (Hα) line emission from the
n = to n = transition of recombining Hydrogen (Puls et al. 1996). It tends to be dominated
by emission very near the star, and so is not as sensitive to the wind terminal speed. As a
ρdiagnostic, it is also sensitive to wind clumping, but in this case, in the relatively low-speed
flow near the stellar surface.

2.2.5 Continuum Emission in Radio and Infrared
The dense, warm stellar winds from hot supergiants can also produce substantial contin-
uum emission at radio and infrared (IR) wavelengths. Those with spectra showing a flux that
increases with frequency are identified as “non-thermal,” and are now associated with binary
systems wherein electrons accelerated in the shock collision between the two winds emit radio
waves through gyration about the local magnetic field (van Loo et al. 2005).
More useful as a wind diagnostic are the thermal emitters, wherein the radio/IR arises from
free-free emission by electrons with thermal energies characteristic of the wind temperature.
A landmark analysis by Wright and Barlow (1975) showed how the observed flux of thermal
radio/IR emission could be used as a quite direct diagnostic of the wind mass loss rate.
Both free-free emission and absorption are density-squared processes. For absorption in a
wind moving at constant speed v∞, the radial optical depth from a radius r to the observer is
thus given by
τν(r) = K(ν, T) ∫
∞

ρ(r′) dr′ = K(ν, T)
˙M
πv∞r,
(15.17)
where the dependence on frequency ν and temperature T is set by K(ν, T) ∼ν−T−/(Allen
1973; Wright and Barlow 1975). Solving τν(Rν) = allows us to define a characteristic radius
for the “radio/IR photosphere” at frequency ν,
Rν = [K(ν, T)
˙M
πv∞
]
/
.
(15.18)
For hot supergiants, the wind density is so high that this radio/IR photosphere can be at
hundreds of stellar radii, Rν > R.
The radio/IR luminosity can then be estimated by a simple model that accumulates the
total outward emission from a sphere with this photospheric radius; since free-free emission
is a thermal process, the surface brightness of this photosphere is set by the Planck function
Bν(T), giving
Lν = πBνπR
ν = πBν [K(ν, T)
˙M
πv∞
]
/
(15.19)
For radio/IR frequencies and typical stellar wind temperatures, the Planck function is well
approximated by its Rayleigh–Jeans form, Bν
≈νkT/c. Using the above scaling for
K(ν, T) ∼ν−T−/, it is then seen that the radio/IR luminosity scales with frequency as
Lν ∼ν/, but becomes independent of temperature.
The luminosity scales with wind parameters as Lν ∼( ˙M/v∞)/, but otherwise depends
just on known atomic constants. As such, if the wind terminal speed is known from other diag-
nostics, such as P-Cygni line profiles, measurements of the radio/IR flux can provide (for known
stellar distance) a relatively robust diagnostic of the wind mass loss rate ˙M. But again, because
of the scaling with density squared, in a clumped wind such radio/IR inferred mass loss rates
are overestimated by a factor C f = /
√
fv, where now fv is the clump volume filling factor in
the distant, outer wind. Comparison with mass loss rates derived from Hα, which also scales
with density squared but is formed near the star, can thus give a clue to the radial evolution of
wind clumping (Puls et al. 2006).

General Equations and Formalism for Stellar Wind Mass Loss
With this background on wind diagnostics, let us now turn to theoretical modeling of stellar
winds. This section lays the groundwork by defining the basic dynamical equations for con-
servation of mass, momentum, and energy. The following sections review the mechanisms for
wind driving for the different types of stellar winds.
3.1 Hydrostatic Equilibrium in the Atmospheric Base of Any Wind
A stellar wind outflow draws mass from the large reservoir of the star at its base. In the star’s
atmosphere, the mass density ρ becomes so high that the net mass flux density ρv for the over-
lying steady wind requires only a very slow net drift speed v, much below the local sound speed.
In this nearly static region, the gravitational acceleration ggrav acting on the mass density ρ is
closely balanced by a pressure gradient ∇P,
∇P = ρggrav ,
(15.20)
a condition known as hydrostatic equilibrium. In luminous stars, this pressure can include sig-
nificant contributions from the stellar radiation, but for now let us assume (as is applicable for
the sun and other cool stars) it is set by the ideal gas law
P = ρkT/μ = ρa.
(15.21)
The latter equality introduces the isothermal sound speed, defined by a ≡
√
kT/μ, with T the
temperature, μ the mean atomic weight, and k Boltzmann’s constant. The ratio of (> 15.21) to
(> 15.20) defines a characteristic pressure scale height,
H ≡
P
∣∇P∣=
a
∣ggrav∣.
(15.22)
In the simple ideal case of an isothermal atmosphere with constant sound speed a, this
represents the scale for exponential stratification of density and pressure with height z
P(z)
P∗
= ρ(z)
ρ∗
= e−z/H ,
(15.23)
where the asterisk subscripts denote values at some surface layer where z ≡. In practice, the
temperature variations in an atmosphere are gradual enough that quite generally both pressure
and density very nearly follow such an exponential stratification.
As a typical example, in the solar photosphere T ≈, K and μ ≈−g, yielding a
sound speed a ≈km/s. For the solar surface gravity ggrav = GM⊙/R
⊙≈.× cm/s,
this gives a pressure scale height of H ≈km, which is very much less than the solar radius
R⊙≈, km. This implies a sharp edge to the visible solar photosphere, with the emergent
spectrum well described by a planar atmospheric model fixed by just two parameters – typically
effective temperature and gravity – and not dependent on the actual solar radius.
This relative smallness of the atmospheric scale height is a key general characteristic of static
stellar atmospheres, common to all but the most extremely extended giant stars. In general, for
stars with mass M, radius R, and surface temperature T, the ratio of scale height to radius

752 15

can be written in terms of the ratio of the associated sound speed a∗to surface escape speed
ve ≡
√
GM/R,
H∗
R = a
∗
ve
≡s .
(15.24)
One recurring theme of this chapter is that the value of this ratio is also of direct relevance
to stellar winds. The parameter s ≡(a∗/ve)characterizes roughly the ratio between the gas
internal energy and the gravitational escape energy. For the solar photosphere, s ≈.× −,
and even for very hot stars with an order of magnitude higher photospheric temperature, this
parameter is still quite small, s ∼−. However, as discussed further in the next section, for
the multimillion-degree temperatureof the solar corona, this parameter is much closer to unity,
and that is a key factor in the capacity for the thermal gas pressure to drive the outward coronal
expansion that is the solar wind.
3.2 General Flow Conservation Equations
Let us now consider a case wherein a nonzero net force leads to a net acceleration,
dv
dt = ∂v
∂t + v ⋅∇v = −∇P
ρ −GM
rˆr + gx .
(15.25)
Here v is the flow velocity, gx is some yet-unspecified force-per-unit-mass, and the gravity is
now cast in terms of its standard dependence on gravitation constant G, stellar mass M, and
local radius r, with ˆr a unit radial vector.
Conservation of mass requires that any temporal change in the local density ρ must arise
from a net divergence of the mass flux density ρv,
∂ρ
∂t + ∇⋅ρv = .
(15.26)
Conservation of internal energy takes a similar form, but now accounting also for any local
sources or sinks of energy,
∂e
∂t + ∇⋅ev = −P ∇⋅v −∇⋅Fc + Qx .
(15.27)
For an ideal gas with ratio of specific heats γ, the internal energy density e is related to the
pressure through
P = ρa= (γ −)e .
(15.28)
On the right-hand-side of (> 15.27), Qx represents some still unspecified, net volumetric heat-
ing or cooling, while Fc is the conductive heat flux density, taken classically to depend on the
temperature as
Fc = −KoT/∇T ,
(15.29)
where for electron conduction the coefficient Ko = .× −erg/s/cm/K/(Spitzer 1962).
Collectively, ( > 15.25)–( > 15.28) represent the general equations for a potentially time-
dependent, multidimensional flow.

3.3 Steady, Spherically Symmetric Wind Expansion
In application to stellar winds, first-order models are commonly based on the simplifying
approximations of steady-state (∂/∂t = ), spherically symmetric, radial outflow (v = vˆr). The
mass conservation requirement ( > 15.26) can then be used to define a constant overall mass
loss rate,
˙M ≡πρvr.

sponding, steady-state form for the flow energy, (>15.27), using also the ideal gas law (>15.28).
But in practice, this is only of central importance for proper modeling of the pressure-driven
expansion of a high-temperature (million-degree) corona, as discussed in the next section for
the solar wind.
For stars without such a corona, any wind typically remains near or below the stellar pho-
tospheric temperature T, which as noted above implies a sound speed a∗that is much less than
the surface escape speed ve. This in turn implies that the sound-speed terms on the right-hand
side of (>15.31) are quite negligible, of order s ≡a
∗/v
e ∼−smaller than the gravity near the
stellar surface. These terms are thus of little dynamical importance in determining the overall
wind properties, like the mass loss rate or velocity law (see >Sect. 4). However, it is still often
convenient to retain the sound-speed term on the left-hand side, since this allows for a smooth
mapping of the wind model onto a hydrostatic atmosphere through a subsonic wind base.
In general, to achieve a supersonic flow with a net outward acceleration, (> 15.31) shows
that the net forces on the right-hand side must be positive. For coronal winds, this occurs by the
sound-speed terms becoming bigger than gravity. For other stellar winds, overcoming gravity
requires the additional body force represented by gx, for example from radiation (>Sect. 5).
3.4 Energy Requirements of a Spherical Wind Outﬂow
In addition to these force or momentum conditions for a wind outflow, it is instructive to iden-
tify explicitly the general energy requirements. Combining the momentum and internal energy
equations for steady, spherical expansion, we can integrate to obtain the total energy change

On the left-hand side, the terms represent the kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, and
internal enthalpy. To balance this, on the right-hand side are the work from the force gx, the
net volumetric heating Qx, and the change in the conductive flux Fc. Even for the solar wind,
the enthalpy term is generally much smaller than the larger of the kinetic or potential energy.
Neglecting this term, evaluation at arbitrarily large radius r →∞thus yields the approximate

where Fc∗is the conductive heat flux density at the coronal base, and it is assumed the
outer heat flux vanishes far from the star. This equation emphasizes that a key general
requirement for a wind is to supply the combined kinetic plus potential energy. For stel-
lar winds, this typically occurs through the direct work from the force gx. For the solar
wind, it occurs through a combination of the volume heating and thermal conduction, as
discussed next.

Coronal Expansion and Solar Wind
4.1 Reasons for Hot, Extended Corona
4.1.1 Thermal Runaway from Density and Temperature Decline of
Line-Cooling
In the sun and other relatively cool stars, the existence of a strong near-surface convection zone
provides a source of mechanical energy to heat the upper atmosphere and thereby reverse the
vertical decrease of temperature of the photosphere. From photospheric values characterized
by the effective temperature Teff ≈, K, the temperature declines to a minimum Tmin ≈
, K, but then rises through a layer (the chromosphere) extending over many scale heights
to about , K. Above this, it then jumps sharply across a narrow transition region of less
than scale height, to values in the corona of order a milliondegrees! The high pressure associated
with this high temperature eventually leads to the outward coronal expansion that is the solar
wind.
This sharp jump in temperature is a direct result of the inability of the increasingly rarefied
material in the upper atmosphere to radiate away any mechanical heating, for example asso-
ciated with dissipation of some generic wave energy flux FE over some damping length λd.
To maintain a steady state with no net heating, this energy deposition must be balanced
by radiative cooling, which can be taken to follow the scaling (e.g., Cox and Tucker 1969;
Raymond et al. 1976),
FE
λd
= nHneΛ(T) .
(15.34)
Here Λ(T) is known as the optically thin cooling function, which can be readily tabulated from
a general atomic physics calculation for any assumed abundance of elements, with the standard
result forsolar(or“cosmic”)abundances plotted schematicallyin >Fig. 15-7. The overall scaling
with the product of the hydrogen and electron number densities, nH and ne, reflects the fact
that the radiative cooling arises from collisional excitation of ions by electrons, for the assumed
abundance of ion species per hydrogen atom.
Consider then the nature of this energy balance within a hydrostatically stratified atmo-
sphere, for which all the densities are declining exponentially in height z, with a scale height
H ≪R. If the damping is linked to material absorption, it might scale inversely with density,
but even so cooling would still scale with one higher power of density. Using ( > 15.34), one

(15.35)
As illustrated in > Fig. 15-7, for any finite wave flux this required increase should lead to a
steadily higher temperature until, upon reaching the local maximum of the cooling function at
a temperature of ca. K, a radiative balance can no longer be maintained without a drastic
jump to very much higher temperature, above K.
This thermal instability is the direct consequence of the decline in cooling efficiency above
K, which itself is an intrinsic property of radiative cooling, resulting from the progressive
ionization of those ion stages that have the bound electrons needed for line emission. The

and wave energy flux density F= FE/erg/cm/s. This is roughly comparable to the inferred
densities at the base of the solar corona, that is, just above the top of the transition region from
the chromosphere.

4.1.2 Coronal Heating with a Conductive Thermostat
In practice, the outcome of this temperature runaway of radiative cooling tends to be tempered
by conduction of heat back into the cooler, denser atmosphere. Instead of the tens of million
degrees needed for purely radiative restabilization, the resulting characteristic coronal temper-
ature is “only” a few million degrees. To see this temperature scaling, consider a simple model
in which the upward energy flux FE through a base radius R is now balanced at each coronal
radius r purely by downward conduction,
πRFE = πrKoT/dT
dr .
(15.37)
Integration between the base radius R and an assumed energy deposition radius Rd yields a

(15.38)
where the latter scaling applies for a solar coronal case with R = R⊙and Rd = R⊙. This is in
good general agreement with observational diagnostics of coronal electron temperature, which
typically give values near 2 MK.
Actually, observations (Cranmer et al. 1999; Kohl et al. 1999 ) of the “coronal hole” regions
thought to be the source of high-speed solar wind suggest that the temperature of protons can
be significantly higher, about 4–5 MK. Coronal holes are very low density regions wherein the
collisional energy coupling between electrons and protons can be insufficient to maintain a
common temperature. For complete decoupling, an analogous conductive model would then
require that energy added to the proton component must be balanced by its own thermal con-
duction. But because of the higher mass and thus lower thermal speed, proton conductivity is
reduced by the root of the electron/proton mass ratio,
√
me/mp ≈, relative to the standard
electron value used above. Application of this reduced proton conductivity in ( > 15.38) thus
yields a proton temperature scaling

(15.39)
where now F= FEp/erg/cm/s, with FEp the base energy flux associated with proton
heating. > Equation 15.39 matches better with the higher inferred proton temperature in
coronal holes, but more realistically, modeling the proton energy balance in such regions
must also account for the energy losses associated with coronal expansion into the solar wind
(see >Sect. 3.3).
4.1.3 Incompatibility of Hot Extended Hydrostatic Corona with ISM Pressure
Since the thermal conductivity increases with temperature as T/, the high characteristic coro-
nal temperature also implies a strong outward conduction flux Fc. For a conduction-dominated
energy balance, this conductive heat flux has almost zero divergence,
∇⋅Fc = 
r
d(rKoT/(dT/dr))

≈.
(15.40)
Upon double integration, this gives a temperature that declines only slowly outward from its
coronal maximum, that is, as T ∼r−/. The overall point thus is that, once a coronal base

Stellar Winds 15
757
is heated to a very high temperature, thermal conduction should tend to extend that high
temperature outward to quite large radii (Chapman 1961).
This radially extended high temperature of a corona has important implications for the
dynamical viability of maintaining a hydrostatic stratification. First, for such a high temper-
ature, ( > 15.24) shows that the ratio of scale height to radius is no longer very small. For
example, for the typical solar coronal temperature of 2 MK, the scale height is about 15% of
the solar radius. In considering a possible hydrostatic stratification for the solar corona, it is
thus now important to take explicit account of the radial decline in gravity,
d ln P

ar.
(15.41)
Motivated by the conduction-dominated temperature scaling T
∼r−/, let us consider
a slightly more general model for which the temperature has a power-law radial decline,
T/T = a/a
∗= (r/R)−q. Integration of (> 15.41) then yields

P∗

(15.42)
where H∗≡a
∗R/GM. A key difference from the exponential stratification of a nearly planar
photosphere (cf. [ > 15.23]) is that the pressure now approaches a finite value at large radii
r →∞,
P∞
P∗
= e−R/H∗(−q) = e−/T(−q) ,
(15.43)
where the latter equality applies for solar parameters, with Tthe coronal base temperature in
units of K. This gives log(P∗/P∞) ≈/T/(−q).
To place this in context, note that a combination of observational diagnostics give
log(PTR/PISM) ≈for the ratio between the pressure in the transition region base of the solar
corona and that in the interstellar medium. This implies that a hydrostatic corona could only
be contained by the interstellar medium if (−q)T< .. Specifically, for the conduction-
dominated temperature index q = /, this requires T< .. Since this is well below the
observational range T≈.–3, the implication is that a conduction-dominated corona cannot
remain hydrostatic, but must undergo a continuous expansion, known of course as the solar
wind.
But it is important to emphasize here that this classical and commonly cited argument for
the “inevitability” of the solar coronal expansion depends crucially on extending a high tem-
perature at the coronal base far outward. For example, a base temperature in the observed
range T= 1.5–3 would still allow a hydrostatic match to the interstellar medium pressure if
the temperature were to decline with just a somewhat bigger power index q = /−/.
4.2 Isothermal Solar Wind Model
These problems with maintaining a hydrostatic corona motivate consideration of dynamical
wind solutions (Parker 1963). A particularly simple example is that of an isothermal, steady-
state, spherical wind, for which the equation of motion [from ( > 15.31), without external
driving (gx = ) or sound-speed gradient (da/dr = )] becomes

Recall that this uses the ideal gas law for the pressure P = ρa, and eliminates the density
through the steady-state mass continuity; it thus leaves unspecified the constant overall mass
loss rate ˙M ≡πρvr.
The right-hand side of (> 15.44) has a zero at the critical radius

(15.45)
At this radius, the left-hand side must likewise vanish, either through a zero velocity gradient

two contours cross at the critical radius (r = rc) with a sonic flow speed (v = a). The positive
slope of these represents the standard solar wind solution, which is the only one that takes a
subsonic flow near the surface into a supersonic flow at large radii.
Of the other initially subsonic solutions, those lying above the critical solution fold back and
terminate with an infinite slope below the critical radius. Those lying below remain subsonic
everywhere, peaking at the critical radius, but then declining to arbitrarily slow, very subsonic

speeds at large radii. Because such subsonic “breeze” solutions follow a nearly hydrostatic strat-
ification (Chamberlain 1961) , they again have a large, finite asymptotic pressure that does not
match the required interstellar boundary condition.
In contrast, for the solar wind solution the supersonic asymptotic speed means that, for any
finite mass flux, the density, and thus the pressure, asymptotically approaches zero. To match
a small, but finite interstellar medium pressure, the wind can undergo a shock jump transition
onto one of the declining subsonic solutions lying above the decelerating critical solution.
Note that, since the density has scaled out of the controlling equation of motion (> 15.44),
the wind mass loss rate ˙M ≡πρvrdoes not appear in this isothermal wind solution. An
implicit assumption hidden in such an isothermal analysis is that, no matter how large the mass
loss rate, there is some source of heating that counters the tendency for the wind to cool with
expansion. As discussed below, determining the overall mass loss rate requires a model that
specifies the location and overall level of this heating.
4.2.1 Temperature Sensitivity of Mass Loss Rate
This isothermal wind solution does nonetheless have some important implications for the rel-
ative scaling of the wind mass loss rate. To see this, note again that within the subsonic base
region, the inertial term on the left side of (> 15.44) is relatively small, implying the subsonic
stratification is nearly hydrostatic. Thus, neglecting the inertial term v/ain the isothermal
solution (>15.46) for the critical wind case C = −, one can solve approximately for the surface
flow speed
v∗≡v(R) ≈a (rc


e/−rc/R .
(15.47)
Here “surface” should really be interpreted to mean at the base the hot corona, that is, just above
the chromosphere–corona transition region.
In the case of the sun, observations of transition region emission lines provide a quite
tight empirical constraint on the gas pressure P∗at this near-surface coronal base of the wind
(Withbroe 1988). Using this and the ideal gas law to fix the associated base density ρ∗= P∗/a,
one finds that (> 15.47) implies a mass loss scaling

(15.48)
With T≡T/K, the last proportionality applies for the solar case, and is intended to empha-
size the steep, exponential dependence on the inverse temperature. For example, assuming a
fixed pressure, just doubling the coronal temperature from one to two million degrees implies
nearly a factor 200 increase in the mass loss rate!
Even more impressively, decreasing from such a 1 MK coronal temperature to the photo-
spheric temperature T ≈, K would decrease the mass loss rate by more than a thousand
orders of magnitude! This reiterates quite strongly that thermally driven mass loss is completely
untenable at photospheric temperatures.
The underlying reason for this temperaturesensitivity stems from the exponential stratifica-
tion of the subsonic coronal density between the base radius R and the sonic/critical radius rc.
From (> 15.24) and (> 15.45) it is clear that this critical radius is closely related to the ratio of

760 15

the base scale height to stellar radius
rc

H = v
e

(15.49)
where the latter equality also recalls the link with the ratio of sound speed to surface escape
speed. Application in ( > 15.48) shows that the argument of the exponential factor simply
represents the number of base scale heights within a critical radius.
As noted in >Sect. 2.1, in situ measurements by interplanetary spacecraft show that the
solar wind mass flux is actually quite constant, varying only by about a factor of 2 or so. In con-
junction with the predicted scalings like (> 15.48), and the assumption of fixed based pressure
derived from observed transition region emission, this relatively constant mass flux has been
viewed as requiring a sensitive fine-tuning of the coronal temperature (e.g., Leer and Holzer
1979; Withbroe 1989).
4.2.2 The Solar Wind as a Thermostat for Coronal Heating
But a more appropriate perspective is to view this temperature-sensitive mass loss as providing
an effective way to regulate the temperature resulting from coronal heating. This can be seen
by considering explicitly the energy requirements for a thermally driven coronal wind. From
(> 15.32) (with gx = ), the total energy change from a base radius R to a given radius r is

(15.50)
The expression here of the gravitational and internal enthalpy in terms of the associated escape
and sound speed ve and a allows convenient comparison of the relative magnitudes of these
with the kinetic energy term, v/. Even at typical coronal temperature of 2 MK, the enthalpy
term is only about a third of the gravitational escape energy from the solar surface, implying
that the initially slow, subsonic flow at the wind base has negative total energy set by gravity.
Far from the star, this gravitational term vanishes, and the kinetic energy associated with the
supersonic solar wind dominates. Since enthalpy is thus is not important is either limit, let us
for convenience ignore its relatively minor role in the global wind energy balance, giving then

(15.51)
Here the outer heat flux is assumed to vanish asymptotically far from the star, while Fc∗< 
is the (inward) conductive heat flux density at the coronal base. > Equation 15.51 shows then
that the total energy of the solar wind is just given by the total, volume-integrated heating of the
solar corona and wind, minus the lost energy by conduction back into the solar atmosphere.The
analysis in >Sect. 4.1.3 discussed how the heating of a strictly static corona can be balanced
by the inward conductive flux back into the sun. But ( > 15.51) now shows that an outflow-
ing corona allows a net difference in heating minus conduction to be carried outward by the
solar wind.
In this sense, the problem of “fine-tuning” the coronal temperature to give the observed,
relatively steady mass flux is resolved by a simple change of perspective, recognizing instead
that for a given level of coronal heating, the strongly temperature-sensitive mass and energy
loss of the solar wind provides a very effective “thermostat” for the coronal temperature.

Stellar Winds 15
761
4.3 Driving High-Speed Streams
More quantitative analyses solve for the wind mass loss rate and velocity law in terms of some
model for both the level and spatial distribution of energy addition into the corona and solar
wind. The specific physical mechanisms for the heating are still a matter of investigation, but one
quite crucial question regards the relative fraction of the total base energy flux deposited in the
subsonic vs. supersonic portion of the wind. Models with an explicit energy balance generally
confirm a close link between mass loss rate and energy addition to the subsonic base of coronal
wind expansion. By contrast, in the supersonic region this mass flux is essentially fixed, and so
any added energy there tends instead to increase the energy per mass, as reflected in asymptotic
flow speed v∞(Leer et al. 1982).
A important early class of solar wind models assumed some localized deposition of energy
very near the coronal base, with conduction then spreading that energy both downward into
the underlying atmosphere and upward into the extended corona. As noted, the former can play
a role in regulating the coronal base temperature, while the latter can play a role in maintaining
the high coronal temperature needed for wind expansion. Overall, such conduction models of
solar wind energy transport were quite successful in reproducing interplanetary measurements
of the speed and mass flux of the “quiet,” low-speed (v∞≈350–400 km/s) solar wind.
However, such models generally fail to explain the high-speed (v∞≈km/s) wind
streams that are inferred to emanate from solar “corona holes.” Such coronal holes are regions
where the solar magnetic field has an open configuration that, in contrast to the closed, nearly
static coronal “loops,” allows outward, radial expansion of the coronal gas. To explain the high-
speed streams, it seems that some substantial fraction of the mechanical energy propagating
upward through coronal holes must not be dissipated as heat near the coronal base, but instead
must reach upward into the supersonic wind, where it provides either a direct acceleration
(e.g., via a wave pressure that gives a net outward gx) or heating (Qx > ) that powers extended
gas-pressure acceleration to high speed.
Observations of such coronal hole regions from the SOHO satellite (Cranmer et al. 1999;
Kohl et al. 1999 ) show temperatures of Tp ≈–5 MK for the protons, and perhaps as high
as MK for minor ion species like oxygen. The fact that such proton/ion temperatures are
much higher than the ca. 2 MK inferred for electrons shows clearly that electron heat con-
duction does not play much role in extending the effect of coronal heating outward in such
regions. The fundamental reasons for the differing temperature components are a topic of
much current research; one promising model invokes ion cyclotron resonance damping of
magnetohydrodynamics waves (Cranmer 2000, 2009).
4.4 Relation to Winds from other Cool Stars
4.4.1 Coronal Winds of Cool Main-Sequence Stars
Like the sun, other cool stars with surface temperatures T ≲, low enough for hydro-
gen recombination are expected to have vigorous subsurface convection zones that generate a
strong upward flux of mechanical energy. For main-sequence stars in which gravitational strat-
ification implies a sharp, exponential drop in surface density over small-scale height H ≪R,
this should lead to the same kind of thermal runaway as in the sun ( >Sect. 4.1; >Fig. 15-7),
generating a hot corona, and so also an associated, pressure-driven coronal wind expansion. As

762 15
Stellar Winds
noted in >Sect. 2.1, observations of X-ray emission and high-ionization UV lines do indeed
provide strong evidence for such stellar coronae, but the low density of the very low mass loss
rate means there are few direct diagnostics of actual outflow in stellar coronal winds.
4.4.2 Alfvén Wave Pressure Driving of Cool-Giant Winds
By contrast, cool giants do show much direct evidence for quite dense, cool winds, without
any indication of a hot corona that could sustain a gas-pressure-driven expansion. However,
the mechanical energy flux density needed to drive such winds is actually quite comparable to
what is inferred for the solar surface, FE ≈erg/cm/s, which likely could again be readily
supplied by their H-recombination convection zones. But a key difference now is that, owing to
the much weaker gravitational stratification, this need no longer lead to a thermal runaway.
In particular, consider again the general scaling of the ratio of the gravitational scale height
to stellar radius (cf. [> 15.24]),
H
R = a
ve
= kTR
GμM = × −(T/T⊙) (R/R⊙)
M/M⊙
.
(15.52)
In cool, solar-mass giant stars, the much larger radius can increase the surface value of this
ratio by a factor hundred or more over its (very small) solar value, that is, to several percent.
Moreover, at the >1 MK coronal temperature of a thermal runaway, the ratio would now be
well above unity, instead of ca. 10% found for the solar corona. This would formally put the
critical/sonic radius below the stellarradius, representing a kind of free expansion of the coronal
base, at a supersonic speed well above the surface escape speed, instead of critical transition
from subsonic to supersonic outflow. It seems unlikely thermal runaway could be sustained in
such an expanding vs. static medium.
But in lieu of runaway heating, it seems instead that the upward mechanical energy flux
could readily provide the direct momentum addition to drive a relatively slow wind outflow
against the much weaker stellar gravity, operating now via a gradient in the pressure associated
with waves instead of the gas. In general, the mechanical stress or pressure exerted by waves
scales, like gas pressure, with the gas density ρ; but now this is multiplied by the square of a
wave velocity amplitude δv, instead of the sound speed a, that is, Pw = ρδv.
Although the details of how such a wave pressure is generated and evolves depend on the
specific type of wave, a general energetic requirement for any waves to be effective in driving a
wind outflow is that the fluctuating velocity δv must become comparable to the local gravita-
tional escape speed somewhere near the stellar surface. This already effectively rules out wind
driving by sound waves, because to avoid strong damping as shocks, their velocity amplitude
must remain subsonic, δv < a; this implies Pw < Pgas, and thus that sound waves would be even
less effective than gas pressure in driving such cool winds (Koninx and Pijpers 1992).
In this respect, the prospects are much more favorable for magnetohydrodynamic waves,
particularly the Alfvén mode. For the simple case of a radially oriented stellar magnetic field
B = Bˆr, the mean field can impart no outward force to propel a radial wind. But Alfvén wave
fluctuations δB transverse to the mean field B give the field a wave pressure Pw = δB/π, for
which any radial gradient dPw/dr does have an associated radial force. Moreover, since the
fractional amplitude f = δB/B of Alfvén waves can be up to order unity, the associated velocity

amplitude δv of these transverse fluctuations can now extend up to the Alfvén speed,
vA ≡
B
√πρ .
(15.53)
Unlike for sound waves, this can readily become comparable to the stellar escape speed ve,
implying a ready potential for Alfvén waves to drive a strong stellar wind.
In fact, for Alfvén waves with a fractional amplitude f
= δv/vA = δB/B, requiring
δv = ve = v at a wind critical point near the stellar surface radius R gives a direct estimate for
the potential wind mass loss rate,

consistent with the mass flux measured by interplanetary spacecraft (>Sect. 2.1). More signif-
icantly, for giant stars with fluctuating fields δB = f B of a few Gauss, the scaling in (> 15.54)
matches quite well their much higher, observationally inferred mass loss rates. For a wind with

which, as noted above, for typical cool-giant parameters is quite close to solar energy flux
density.
Actually, observations indicate such cool-giant winds typically have terminal speeds of only
10–20 km/s, significantly below even their relatively low surface escape speeds ve ≈km/s,
and implying that most all (∼90%) of the input energy goes toward lifting the wind mate-
rial out of the star’s gravitational potential. Explaining this together with the large mass loss
rate demands a delicate fine-tuning in any wind model, for example that the Alfvén waves are
damped over a length scale very near a stellar radius (Hartmann and MacGregor 1980; Holzer
et al. 1983). For further details, the reader is referred to the very lucid reviews by Holzer (1987)
and Holzer and MacGregor (1985).
4.4.3 Superwind Mass Loss from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars
Stars with initial mass M < M⊙are all thought to end up as white dwarfs with mass below
the Chandrasekhar limit M < .M⊙. This requires copious mass loss ( ˙M > −M⊙/year)
to occur in a relatively brief (∼10year) “superwind” phase at the end of a star’s evolution on
the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). It seems unlikely that mere wave pressure generated in
near-surface convection zones could drive such enormous mass loss, and so instead, models
have emphasized tapping the more deep-seated driving associated with global stellar pulsations.
The most effective seem to be the radial pressure or p-modes thought to be excited by the so-
called kappa mechanism (Hansen et al. 2004) within interior ionizations zones (e.g., of Helium).
Because of the much higher interior temperature and sound speed, such pulsations can have
much higher velocity amplitude than surface sound waves. Indeed, as the pulsations propagate

764 15
Stellar Winds
upward through the declining density, their velocity amplitude can increase, effectively lifting
gas parcels near the surface a substantial fraction of the stellar radius.
If the subsequent infall phase of these near-surface parcels meets with the next outward
pulsation before returning to its previous minimum radius, the net effect is a gradual lifting of
material out of the much weakened gravitational potential. Moreover, as the gas cools through
the expansion into ever larger radii and away from the stellar photosphere, dust can form, at
which point the additional driving associated with scattering and absorption of the bright stellar
radiation can propel the coupled medium of gas and dust to full escape from the star. But such
dust-driving is only possible when the pulsations are able to effectively “levitate” stellar material
in a much weakened gravity.
As reviewed by Willson (2000), models suggest the net mass loss can eventually become so
effective that the associated mass loss timescale τM = M/ ˙M becomes shorter than the timescale
forinteriorevolution, representing then a kind of“death line” at which the entire stellarenvelope
is effectively lost, leaving behind only the hot, dense, degenerate stellar core to become a white
dwarf remnant. Overall, this process seems arguably a largely interior evolution issue, more akin
to a “critical overflow” (e.g., like the “Roche lobe” overflow in mass exchange binaries) than a
steady, supersonic outflow from a fixed stellar surface. As such, the kind of simplified steady-
state wind formalism outlined here is perhaps of limited relevance. The reader is thus referred
to the review by Willson (2000) and references therein for a more detailed discussion of this
extreme final stage of cool-star mass loss.
4.5 Summary for the Solar Wind
•
The solar wind is driven by the gas-pressure gradient of the high-temperature solar corona.
•
The hot corona is the natural consequence of heating from mechanical energy generated
in the solar convection zone. At low density radiative cooling cannot balance this heating,
leading to a thermal runaway up to temperatures in excess of a million degrees, at which
inward thermal conduction back into the atmosphere can again balance the heating.
•
Outward thermal conduction can extend this high temperature well away from the coronal
base.
•
For such a hot, extendedcorona, hydrostatic stratification would lead to an asymptotic pres-
sure that exceeds the interstellar value, thus requiring a net outward coronal expansion that
becomes the supersonic solar wind.
•
Because the wind mass flux is a sensitive function of the coronal temperature, the energy
loss from wind expansion acts as an effective coronal thermostat.
•
While the mass loss rate is thus set by energy deposition in the subsonic wind base, energy
added to the supersonic region increases the flow speed.
•
The high-speed wind streams that emanate from coronal holes require extended energy
deposition. Coronal-hole observations showing the proton temperature significantly
exceeds the electron temperature rule out electron heat conduction as the mechanism for
providing the extended energy.
•
Magnetic fields lead to extensive structure and variability in the solar corona and wind.
•
Other cool main-sequence stars likely also have hot, pressure-driven coronal winds, but the
dense, cool winds of cool giants could instead be driven by the pressure from Alfvén waves.

Radiatively Driven Winds from Hot, Massive Stars
Among the most massive stars – which tend also to be the hottest and most luminous – stellar
winds can be very strong, with important consequences for both the star’s own evolution, and
for the surrounding interstellar medium. In contrast to the gas-pressure-driven solar wind,
such hot-star winds are understood to be driven by the pressure gradient of the star’s emitted
radiation.
The sun is a relatively low-mass, cool star with a surface temperature about 6,000 K; but as
discussed above, its wind arises from pressure-expansion of the very hot, million-degree solar
corona, which is somehow superheatedby the mechanical energy generated from convection in
the sun’s subsurface layers. By contrast, high-mass stars with much hotter surface temperatures
(10,000–100,000 K) are thought to lack the strong convection zone needed to heat a circum-
stellar corona; their stellar winds thus remain at temperatures comparable to the star’s surface,
and so lack the very high gas pressure needed to drive an outward expansion against the stellar
gravity.
However, such hot stars have a quite high radiative flux, since by the Stefan–Boltzmann law
this scales as the fourth power of the surface temperature. Because light carries momentum as
well as energy, this radiative flux imparts a force to the atoms that scatter the light. At the level
of the star’s atmosphere where this force exceeds the inward force of the stellar gravity, material
is accelerated upward and becomes the stellar wind.
An important aspect of this radiative driving process is that it often stems mostly from line
scattering. As discussed in >Sect. 2.2, in a static medium such line interactions are confined to
radiation wavelengths within a narrow thermal width of line center. However, in an accelerat-
ing stellar wind flow, the Doppler effect shifts the resonance to increasingly longer wavelengths,
allowing the line scattering to sweep gradually through a much broader portion of the stellar
spectrum (see >Fig. 15-3). This gives the dynamics of such winds an intricate feedback char-
acter, in which the radiative driving force that accelerates the stellar wind depends itself on that
acceleration.
5.1 Radiative Acceleration
5.1.1 Electron Scattering and the Eddington Limit
Before analyzing the radiative acceleration from line scattering, let us first consider the simpler
case of scattering by free electrons, which is a “gray,” or frequency-independent process. Since
gray scattering cannot alter the star’s total luminosity L, the radiative energy flux at any radius r
is simply given by F = L/πr, corresponding to a radiative momentum flux of F/c = L/πrc.
As noted in >Sect. 2.2.1, the opacity for electron scattering is κe = .(+ X) = .cm/g,
where the latter result applies for the standard (solar) hydrogen mass fraction X = .. The
product ofthis opacityand the radiative momentum fluxyields the radiative acceleration (force-
per-unit-mass) from free-electron scattering,
ge(r) = κeL
πrc .
(15.56)
It is of interest to compare this with the star’s gravitational acceleration, GM/r. Since both
accelerations have the same /rdependence on radius, their ratio is spatially constant, fixed by

766 15
Stellar Winds
the ratio of luminosity to mass,
Γe =
κeL
πGMc .
(15.57)
This ratio, sometimes called the Eddington parameter, thus has a characteristic value for each
star. For the sun it is very small, of order × −, but for hot, massive stars it can approach
unity. As noted by Eddington, electron scattering represents a basal radiative acceleration that
effectively counteracts the stellar gravity. The limit Γe →is known as the Eddington limit, for
which the star would become gravitationally unbound.
It is certainly significant that hot stars with strong stellar winds have Γe only a factor two or
so below this limit, since it suggests that only a modest additional opacity could succeed in fully
overcoming gravity to drive an outflow. But it is important to realize that a stellar wind repre-
sents the outer envelope outflow from a nearly static, gravitationally bound base, and as such
is not consistent with an entire star exceeding the Eddington limit. Rather the key requirement
for a wind is that the driving force increases naturally from being smaller to larger than gravity
at some radius near the stellar surface. How the force from line-scattering is ideally suited for
just such a spatial modulation is described next.
5.1.2 Driving By Doppler-Shifted Resonant Line Scattering
As discussed in
> Sect. 2.2, the resonant strength and sensitive wavelength dependence of
bound-bound line opacity leads to strong, characteristic interactions of stellar radiation with
the expanding wind material, giving rise to distinct features in the emergent stellar spectrum,
like asymmetric P-Cygni line profiles, which provide key signatures of the wind expansion.
These same basic properties – resonance strength and Doppler shift of the line resonance in the
expanding outflow – also make the radiative force from line scattering the key factor in driving
most massive-starwinds. Relative to free-electron scattering, the overall amplification factor for
a broadband, untuned radiation source is set bythe quality of the resonance, Q ≈νo/A, where νo
is the line frequency and A is decay rate of the excited state. For quantum mechanically allowed
atomic transitions, this can be very large, of order . Thus, even though only a very small frac-
tion (∼10−) of electrons in a hot-star atmosphere are bound into atoms, illumination of these
atoms by an unattenuated (i.e., optically thin), broadband radiation source would yield a collec-
tive line-force which exceeds that from free electrons by about a factor Q ≈× −= , 
(Gayley 1995). For stars within a factor two of the free-electron Eddington limit, this implies
that line scattering is capable, in principle, of driving material outward with an acceleration on
order a thousand times the inward acceleration of gravity!
In practice, of course, this does not normally occur, since any sufficiently large collection
of atoms scattering in this way would readily block the limited flux available within just the
narrow frequency bands tuned to the lines. Indeed, in the static portion of the atmosphere, the
flux is greatly reduced at the line frequencies. Such line “saturation” keeps the overall line force
quite small, in fact well below the gravitational force, which thus allows the inner parts of the
atmosphere to remain gravitationally bound.
This, however, is where the second key factor, the Doppler effect, comes into play. As illus-
trated in > Fig. 15-3, in the outward-moving portions of the outer atmosphere, the Doppler
effect redshifts the local line resonance, effectively desaturating the lines by allowing the atoms
to resonate with relatively unattenuated stellar flux that was initially at slightly higher frequen-
cies. By effectively sweeping a broader range of the stellar flux spectrum, this makes it possible

Stellar Winds 15
767
for the line force to overcome gravity and acceleratethe very outflow it itself requires. As quanti-
fied within the CAK wind theory described below, the amount of mass accelerated adjusts such
that the self-absorption of the radiation reduces the overall line-driving to being just somewhat
(not a factor thousand) above what is needed to overcome gravity.
5.1.3 Radiative Acceleration from a Single, Isolated Line
For weak lines that are optically thin in the wind (i.e., with a characteristic optical depth from
[ > 15.5], τo ≪), the line-acceleration takes a form similar to the simple electron scattering
case (cf. [> 15.56]),
gthin ≡κvthνoLν
πrc
= wνo q ge ,
(15.58)
where κ characterizes the opacity near line center, q ≡κvth/κec is a dimensionless measure
of the frequency-integrated line opacity (cf. > Sect. 2.2.2), and wνo ≡νoLν/L weights the
placement of the line within the luminosity spectrum Lν.
For stronger lines, the absorption and scattering of radiation can be treated within the
Sobolev approximation in terms of the optical thickness of the local Sobolev resonance zone, as
given in >Sect. 2.2 for nonradial rays integrated over the finite-size star (see [>15.7–15.9]). In
the further approximation of purely radial streaming radiation from a point-like star, the radial
acceleration takes the form,
gline ≈gthin
−e−τSob
τSob
.
(15.59)
wherein the reduction from the optically thin case depends only on the local radial Sobolev
optical depth given in (> 15.3), which is rewritten here as
τSob = ρκlSob = ρκvth
dv/dr = ρqκec
dv/dr ≡qt .
(15.60)
In the final equality, t ≡κeρc/(dv/dr) is the Sobolev optical depth for a line with integrated
strength equal to free-electron scattering, that is, with q = .
In the limit of a very optically thick line with τs ≫, the acceleration becomes,
gthick ≈gthin
τs
= wνo
L
πrρc
dv
dr = wνo
L
˙Mcv dv

(15.61)
where the last equality uses the definition of the wind mass loss rate, ˙M ≡πρvr. A key result
here is that the optically thick line force is independent of the line strength q, and instead varies
in proportion to the velocity gradient dv/dr. The basis of this is illustrated by >Fig. 15-3, which
shows that the local rate at which stellar radiation is redshifted into a line resonance depends on
the slope of the velocity. By Newton’sfamous equation of motion, a force is normally understood
to cause an acceleration. But here it is seen that an optically thick line-force also depends on the
wind’s advective rate of acceleration, v dv/dr.
5.1.4 Sobolev Localization of Line-Force Integrals for a Point Star
To provide a more quantitative illustration of this Sobolev approximation, let us now derive
these key properties of line-driving through the localization of the spatial optical depth integral.

768 15
Stellar Winds
Under the simplifying approximation that the stellar radiation flux is purely radial (as from a
central point-source), the force-per-unit-mass associated with direct absorption by a single line
at a radius r is given by
gline(r) = gthin ∫
∞
−∞dx ϕ(x −u(r))e−τ(x,r).
(15.62)
The integration is overa scaled frequency x ≡(ν/νo−)(c/vth), defined from line centerin units
of the frequency broadening associated with the ion thermal speed vth, and u(r) ≡v(r)/vth
is the radial flow speed in thermal-speed units. The integrand is weighted by the line profile
function ϕ(x), which for thermal broadening typically has the Gaussian form ϕ(x) ∼e−x. The
exponential reduction takes account of absorption, as set by the frequency-dependent optical
depth to the stellar surface radius R,
τ(x, r) ≡∫
r
R dr′κρ(r′)ϕ (x −u(r′)) .
(15.63)
A crucial point in evaluating this integral is that in a supersonic wind, the variation of the
integrand is dominated by the velocity variation within the line-profile. As noted above, this
variation has a scale given by the Sobolev length lSob ≡vth/(dv/dr), which is smaller by a fac-
tor vth/v than the competing density/velocity scale, H ≡∣ρ/(dρ/dr)∣≈v/(dv/dr). A key step
in the Sobolev approximation is thus to recast this spatial integration as an integration over the
comoving-frame frequency x′ ≡x −u(r′),
τ(x, r) = −∫
x′(r)
x′(R)
dx′ vth
dv/dr′ κρ(x′) ϕ(x′) ≈τSobΦ(x −u(r)) ,
(15.64)
where the integrated profile
Φ(x) ≡∫
∞
x
dx′ϕ(x′) ,
(15.65)
and the latter approximation in ( > 15.64) uses the assumption that v(r) ≫vth to formally
extend the surface frequency x′(R) toinfinityrelative tothe local resonance x′(r). As defined in
(>15.60), the Sobolev optical thickness τs = qt arises here as a collection of spatial variables that
are assumed to be nearly constant over the Sobolev resonance zone, and thus can be extracted
outside the integral.
Finally, a remarkable, extra bonus from this approximation is that the resulting optical depth
( > 15.64) now has precisely the form needed to allow analytic evaluation of the line-force
integral (> 15.62), yielding directly the general Sobolev force expression given in (> 15.59).
5.2 The CAK Model for Line-Driven Winds
5.2.1 The CAK Line-Ensemble Force
In practice, a large number of lines with a range of frequencies and strengths can contribute to
the wind driving. Castor et al. (1975; hereafter CAK) introduced a practical formalism for com-
puting the cumulative line-acceleration from a parameterized line-ensemble, under the simpli-
fying assumption that the spectral distribution keeps the individual lines nearly independent.

q dN

(15.66)
where the latter equality approximates the discrete sum as a continuous integral over the
flux-weighted number distribution dN/dq. Following CAK, a key further simplification is to
approximate this number distribution as a simple power law in the line strength q,
q dN
dq =

Γ(α) ( q
¯Q )
α−
,
(15.67)
where Γ(α) is the complete Gamma function, the CAK power-law index satisfies < α < , and
the above mentioned cumulative line strength ¯Q provides a convenient overall normalization
(cf. >Sect. 4.2.2). Application of(>15.67)in(>15.66)then yields the CAK, point-star, radiative

Note that this represents a kind of “geometric mean” between the optically thin and thick forms
(> 15.58) and (> 15.61) for a single line.2
5.2.2 CAK Dynamical Solution for Mass Loss Rate and Terminal Speed
The simple, local CAK/Sobolev expression ( > 15.68) for the cumulative line-driving force in
the point-star approximation provides a convenient basis for deriving the basic scalings for
a line-driven stellar wind. Since, as noted above, the gas pressure is not of much importance
in the overall wind driving, let us just consider the steady-state equation of motion (> 15.31)
in the limit of zero sound speed, a = . This simply requires that the wind acceleration must
equal the line-acceleration minus the inward acceleration of gravity,
v dv
dr = gCAK −GM(−Γe)
r
,
(15.69)
wherein we have also taken into account the effective reduction of gravity by the free-electron
scattering factor Γe. Note from ( > 15.68) that the CAK line-force gCAK depends itself on the
flow acceleration it drives.
2CAK dubbed the ratio gCAK/ge the “force multiplier,” written as M(t) = kt−α, with k a normalization con-
stant. Note however that their original formulation used a fiducial thermal speed vth in the definition of the
optical depth parameter t = κe ρvth/(dv/dr), which then gives an artificial thermal speed dependence to the
CAK normalization, k = (vth/c)α ¯Q−α/(−α). In the Sobolev approximation, the line-force has no physical
dependence on the thermal-speed, and so the formal inclusion of a fiducial vth in the CAK parameterization
has sometimes led to confusion, e.g., in applying tabulations of the multiplier constant k. The formulation here
avoids this problem, since the parameters q, ¯Q, and t = κe ρc/(dv/dr) are all independent of vth. A further
advantage is that, for a wide range of hot-star parameters, the line normalization has a relatively constant value
¯Q ≈Z, where Z is the metallicity relative to the standard solar value (Gayley 1995).

Since this feedback between line-driving and flow acceleration is moderated by gravity, let
us define the gravitationally scaled inertial acceleration,
w′ ≡
rvv′
GM(−Γe) .
(15.70)
In terms of an inverse-radius coordinate x

w ≡v/v
esc(−Γe) represents the ratio of wind kinetic energy to the (electron-force-reduced)
effective gravitational binding from the surface. Using ( > 15.68), the equation of motion can
then be rewritten in the simple, dimensionless form,
w′ = C w′α −,
(15.71)

Moreover, since (> 15.71) has no explicit spatial dependence, these critical conditions hold at
all radii. By spatial integration of the critical acceleration w′
c from the surface radius R, we thus
obtain a specific case of the general “beta”-velocity law,
v(r) = v∞(−R∗

β

(15.74)
where β = /, and the wind terminal speed v∞= vesc
√
α(−Γe)/(−α).
An important success of these CAK scaling laws is the theoretical rationale they provide
for an empirically observed “wind momentum–luminosity” (WML) relation (Kudritzki et al.
1995). Combining the CAK mass-loss law (> 15.73) together with the scaling of the terminal
speed with the effective escape, we obtain a WML relation of the form,
˙Mv∞

R∗∼L/αQ
/α−
(15.75)
wherein we have neglected a residual dependence on M(−Γe) that is generally very weak
for the usual case that α is near /. Fits for galactic OB supergiants (Puls et al. 1996) give a
luminosity slope consistent with α ≈., with a normalization consistent with Q ≈. Note
that the direct dependence Q ∼Z provides the scaling of the WML with metallicity Z.
5.3 Extensions of Idealized CAK Model
5.3.1 Finite-Size Star
These CAK results strictly apply only under the idealized assumption that the stellar radiation is
radially streaming from a point-source. If one takes into account the finite angular extent of the
stellar disk, then near the stellar surface the radiative force is reduced by a factor fd∗≈/(+α),
leading to a reduced mass loss rate (Friend and Abbott 1986; Pauldrach et al. 1986),
˙M f d = f /α
d∗˙MCAK =
˙MCAK
(+ α)/α ≈˙MCAK/.
(15.76)
Away from the star, the correction factor increases back toward unity, which for the reduced
base mass flux implies a stronger, more extended acceleration, giving a somewhat higher ter-
minal speed, v∞≈vesc, and a flatter velocity law, approximated by replacing the exponent in
(> 15.74) by β ≈..
5.3.2 Radial Variations in Ionization
The effect of a radial change in ionization can be approximatelytaken intoaccount by correcting
the CAK force ( > 15.68) by a factor of the form (ne/W)δ , where ne is the electron density,

772 15
Stellar Winds
W ≡.(−
√
−R∗/r) is the radiation “dilution factor,” and the exponent has a typical value
δ ≈.(Abbott 1982). This factor introduces an additional density dependence to that already
implied by the optical depth factor /tα given in ( > 15.68). Its overall effect can be roughly
taken into account with the simple substitution α →α′ ≡α −δ in the power exponents of the
CAK mass loss scaling law ( > 15.73). The general tendency is to moderately increase ˙M, and
accordingly to somewhat decrease the wind speed.
5.3.3 Finite Gas Pressure and Sound Speed
The above scalings also ignore the finite gas pressure associated with a small but nonzero sound
speed a. If we apply the full gas-pressure equation of motion ( > 15.31) to the case with line-
driving (gx = gCAK), then through a perturbation expansion in the small parameter a/vesc,
it is possible to derive simple scalings for the fractional corrections to the mass loss rate and
terminal speed (Owocki and ud-Doula 2004),

For a typical case with α ≈/and a ≈km/s ≈vesc/, the net effect is to increase the mass
loss rate and decrease the wind terminal speed, both by about 10%.
5.4 Wind Instability and Variability
The steady, spherically symmetric, line-driven-wind models described above have had consid-
erable success in explaining the inferred general properties of OB-star winds, like the total mass
loss rate and mean velocity law. But when viewed more carefully there is substantial evidence
that such winds are actually quite highly structured and variable on a broad range of spatial and
temporal scales.
Large-scale variations give rise to Discrete Absorption Components (DACs) seen in UV
spectra lines (Howarth and Prinja 1989; Fullerton 2003). These begin as broad absorption
enhancement in the inner part of the blue absorption trough of an unsaturated P-Cygni line,
which then gradually narrow as they drift, over a period of days, toward the blue-edge of the
profile. These DACs likely result from disturbances (e.g., localized magnetic fields or nonradial
pulsations) at the photospheric base of the stellar wind, which through stellar rotation evolve
in the wind into semi-regular “Co-rotating Interaction Regions” (CIRs: Mullan 1984; Cranmer
and Owocki 1996), much as detected directly in the solar wind at boundaries between fast and
slow wind streams (see >Sect. 2.1).
But there is also strong, though indirect evidence that OB winds have an extensive, small-
scale, turbulent structure. Saturated P-Cygni lines have extended black troughs thought to be a
signature that the wind velocity is highly nonmonotonic (Lucy 1982), and such stars commonly
exhibit soft X-ray emission thought to originate from embedded wind shocks (Cohen 2008).
This small-scale flow structure likely results from the strong Line-Deshadowing Instability
(LDI) that is intrinsic to the radiative driving by line scattering (MacGregor et al. 1979; Owocki
and Rybicki 1984, 1985).As noted above, there is a strong hidden potential in line scattering
to drive wind material with accelerations that greatly exceed the mean outward acceleration.
For any small velocity perturbations with a length scale near or below the Sobolev length lSob,

comoving-frame frequency x −u. The light shaded overlap area is proportional to the component
line-acceleration gdir. The dashed proﬁle shows the eﬀect of the Doppler shift from a perturbed
velocity δu (in units of thermal speed vth), with the resulting extra area in the overlap with the blue-
edge intensity giving a perturbed line-force δg that scales in proportion to this perturbed velocity
linear stability analyses show that the perturbed radiative acceleration δg no longer scales with
the velocity gradient δv′, as expected from the above Sobolev analysis (Abbott 1980), but rather
in direct proportion to the perturbed velocity itself, δg ∼δv (MacGregor et al. 1979; Owocki
and Rybicki 1984). This leads to a strong instability, in which the stronger acceleration leads to
a faster flow, which in turns leads to an even stronger acceleration (see >Fig. 15-10).
The growth rate of this instability scales with the ratio of the mean driving force to the ion
thermal speed, ωg ≈gCAK/vth. Since the CAK line-driving also sets the flow acceleration, that
is, gCAK ≈v dv/dr, it is readily found that the growth is approximately at the flow rate through
the Sobolev length, ωg ≈v/lSob. This is a large factor v/vth ≈bigger than the typical wind
expansion rate dv/dr ≈v/R, implying then that a small perturbation at the wind base would,
within this lineary theory, be amplified by an enormous factor, of order ev/vth ≈e!
In practice, a kind of “line-drag” effect of the diffuse component of radiation scattered within
the lines reduces this stability (Lucy 1984; Owocki and Rybicki 1985), giving a net growth rate
that scales roughly as
ωg(r) ≈gCAK
vth
μ∗(r)
+ μ∗(r) .
(15.78)
where μ∗≡
√
−R/r. This net growth rate vanishes near the stellar surface, where μ∗= ,
but it approaches half the pure-absorption rate far from the star, where μ∗→. This implies
that the outer wind is still very unstable, with cumulative growth of ca. v∞/vth ≈e-folds.
Because the instability occurs at spatial scales near and below the Sobolev length, hydrody-
namical simulations of its nonlinear evolution cannot use the Sobolev approximation, but must
instead carry out nonlocal integrals for both direct and diffuse components of the line radiation
transport (Owocki et al. 1988; Feldmeier 1995; Owocki and Puls 1996, 1999). The right panel
of >Fig. 15-11 illustrates typical results of a 1-D time-dependentsimulation. Because of the sta-
bilization from line-drag, the flow near the photospheric wind base follows the steady, smooth
CAK form (dashed curve), but beginning about r ≈.R, the strong intrinsic instability lead
to extensive wind structure, characterized by high-speed rarefactions in between slower dense,
compressed shells.

Because of the computational expense of carrying out the nonlocal integrals for the line-
acceleration, 2-D simulations of this instability have so far been limited, either ignoring or
using simplified approximations for the lateral components of the diffuse line-drag (Owocki
1999; Dessart and Owocki 2003, 2005). But results so far indicate the compressed shells of 1-D
simulations should break up into small-scale clumps, with a characteristic size of a few per-
cent of the local radius, and a volume filling factor fv ≈.. As noted in >Sect. 2.2.1, this has
important implications for interpreting diagnostics that scale with the square of wind density,
suggesting that mass loss rates based on such diagnostics may need to be reduced by factors of
a few, that is, /

5.5 Eﬀect of Rotation
The hot, luminous stars that give rise to line-driven stellar winds tend generally to have quite
rapid stellar rotation. This is most directly evident through the extensive broadening of their

Stellar Winds 15
775
photospheric absorption lines, which suggest projected equatorial rotation speeds Vrot sin i of
hundreds of km/s, where sin i ≤accounts for the inclination angle i of the observer line of
sight to the stellar rotation axis. In some of the most rapid rotators, e.g., the Be stars, the surface
rotation speed Vrot is inferred to be a substantial fraction, perhaps 70–80% or more, of the so-
called critical rotation speed, Vcrit ≡
√
GM/R, for which material at the equatorial surface
would be in Keplerian orbit (Townsend et al. 2004).
Initial investigations (Friend and Abbott 1986; Pauldrach et al. 1986) of the effect of rota-
tion on radiatively driven winds derived 1-D models based on the standard CAK line-driving
formalism, but now adding the effect of a centrifugally reduced, effective surface gravity as a
function of colatitude θ,
geff(θ) = GM
R(−Ωsinθ),
(15.79)
where Ω≡V 
rotR/GM, and for simplicity, we have ignored any rotational distortion of the sur-
face radius R. This allows one towrite the standard CAK mass loss rate scaling law (cf. [>15.73])
in terms of surface values of the mass flux ˙m = ρv, radiative flux F, and effective gravity geff,
relative to corresponding polar (θ = ) values ˙mo, Fo, and go = GM/R,
˙m(θ)
˙mo
= [F(θ)
Fo
]
/α
[ geff(θ)
go
]
−/α
.
(15.80)
If, as was initially assumed, the surface flux is taken to be constant in latitude, F(θ) = Fo, then
we obtain the scaling
˙m(θ)
˙mo
= [−Ωsinθ]
−/α ; F(θ) = Fo .
(15.81)
Since α < , the exponent −/α is negative, implying that the mass flux increases monotonically
from pole (sin θ →) toward the equator (sin θ →).
However, as first demonstrated by von Zeipel (1924), for a radiative stellar envelope under-
going solid body rotation, the emergent radiative flux at any latitude is predicted to vary in
proportion to the centrifugally reduced effective gravity, F(θ) ∼geff. Applying this equatorial
“gravity darkening” for the surface flux, we obtain
˙m(θ)
˙mo
= −Ωsinθ ; F(θ) ∼geff(θ)
(15.82)
so that the mass flux now decreases toward the equator, with a maximum at the pole!
Recalling that the wind terminal speed tends to scale with the surface gravity through
the escape speed, this 1-D analysis also predicts a latitudinally varying wind speed that is
proportional to a centrifugally reduced, effective escape speed,
v∞(θ) ∼vesc
√
−Ωsinθ.
(15.83)
The latitudinal variation of wind density is then obtained from ρ(θ) ∼˙m(θ)/v∞(θ).
More generally, the wind from a rotating star can also flow in latitude as well as radius,
requiring then a 2-D model. In this regard, a major conceptual advance was the development of
the elegantly simple “Wind Compressed Disk” (WCD) paradigm by Bjorkman and Cassinelli
(1993). They noted that, like satellites launched into earth orbit, parcels of gas gradually driven
radially outward from a rapidly rotating star should remain in a tilted “orbital plane” that brings
them over the equator, where they collide to form compressed disk. Initial 2-D hydrodynam-
ical simulations (Owocki et al. 1994) generally confirmed the basic tenets of the WCD model

(b) with nonradial forces but no gravity darkening, and; (c) with both nonradial forces and gravity
darkening
(> Fig. 15-12a), with certain detailed modifications (e.g., infall of inner disk material). But
later simulations (Owocki et al. 1996) that account for a net poleward component of the line-
driving force (>Fig. 15-13) showed that this can effectively reversethe equatorward drift, and so
completely inhibit formation of any equatorial compressed disk (>Fig. 15-12b). Indeed, when
equatorial gravity darkening is taken into account, the lower mass flux from the equator makes
the equatorial wind have a reduced, rather than enhanced, density (>Fig. 15-12c).
The net upshot then is that a radiatively driven wind from a rapidly rotating star is predicted
to be both faster and denser over the poles, instead of the equator. This may help explain spec-
troscopic and interferometric evidence that the current-day wind of the extreme massive star
η Carinae is faster and denser over the poles, leading to a prolate shape for its dense, optically
thick “wind photosphere” (Smith et al. 2003; van Boekel et al. 2003; Groh et al. 2010). Exten-
sions of the rotational scalings to the case of continuum-driven mass loss could also explain the
bipolar shape of the Homunculus nebula (Owocki et al. 2004).
5.6 Summary for Radiatively Driven Massive-Star Winds
•
The large ratio of luminosity to mass means OB stars are near the “Eddington limit,” for
which the radiative force from just scattering by free electrons nearly cancels the stellar
gravity.
•
The resonance nature of line absorption by bound electrons makes their cumulative effective
opacity of order a thousand times larger than free electrons, but the discrete energies of
bound states means the opacity is tuned to very specific photon wavelengths.
•
In a static atmosphere, saturation of line absorption keeps the associated force smaller than
gravity; but in an accelerating wind, the associated Doppler shift of the line frequency
exposes it to fresh continuum radiation, allowing the line-force to become strong enough
to overcome gravity and drive the outflow.

Illustration of the origin of poleward component of the radiative force from a rotating star. Left: The
poleward tilt of the radiative ﬂux arising from the oblateness of the stellar surface contributes to a
poleward component of the driving force. Right: Since the wind speed scales with surface escape
speed, the lower eﬀective gravity of the equator leads to a slower equatorial speed. The associ-
ated poleward increase in speed leads to a poleward tilt in the velocity gradient, and this again
contributes to a poleward component of the line force
•
Because lines have a thermally broadened velocity width (vth ≲a) much less than the wind
flow speed (v ≈vesc), the absorption or scattering of photons in such an accelerating wind
occurs over a narrow resonance layer (of width lSob = vth/(dv/dr) ≈(vth/vesc)R); follow-
ing methods introduced by V. V. Sobolev, this allows nearly local solution of the line transfer
in such accelerating flow.
•
Within the CAK model for a power-law distribution of line strengths, the cumulative line-
force scales with a power of the local velocity gradient divided by the density.
•
For the idealized case of negligible gas pressure and a radially streaming point-source of
stellar radiation, application of this CAK line-force within a steady-state radial equation of
motion yields analytic scalings for the mass loss rate and wind velocity law.
•
Accounting for the finite cone-angle of the stellar disk and radial ionization balance
variations in the driving opacity yield order-unity corrections to the point-star scalings.
Corrections for a finite gas pressure are smaller, of order 10%.
•
Overall, the predictions of the CAK scalings agree well with an observationally inferred
wind momentum–luminosity relation for OB supergiants.
•
Careful analysis indicates that hot-star winds have extensive structure and variability, with
small-scale turbulent structure likely arising from intrinsic instability of line-driving. The
associated clumping has important implications for interpreting mass-loss rate diagnostics
that scale with density squared.
•
Rotation can also significantly affect the mass loss and wind speed, with the gravity dark-
ening from rapid rotation leading to a somewhat surprising polar enhancement of wind
density and flow speed.

Wolf–Rayet Winds and Multiline Scattering
The above CAK model is based on a simplified picture of absorption of the star’s radiative
momentum by many independent lines, effectively ignoring overlap effects among optically
thick lines. Since each such thick line sweeps out a fraction v∞/c of the star’s radiative
momentum L/c, the ratio of wind to radiative momentum is
η ≡
˙Mv∞
L/c = Nthick
v∞
c ,
(15.84)
which is sometimes termed the wind “momentum”or “performance” number. To avoid overlap,
we must require Nthick < c/v∞, which in turn implies the so-called single-scattering limit for
the wind momentum, η < . Since most OB winds are inferred to be below this limit, the basic
CAK formalism ignoring overlap still provides a reasonably good model for explaining their
overall properties.
However, such a single-scattering formalism seems quite inadequate for the much stronger
winds of Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars. Wolf–Rayet stars are evolved, massive, hot stars for which
the cumulative mass loss has led to depletion of the original hydrogen envelope. They typically
show broad wind-emission lines of elements like carbon, nitrogen, and/or oxygen that are the
products of core nucleosynthesis. Overall, observations indicate that WR winds are especially
strong, and even optically thick to continuum scattering by electrons. Notably, inferred WR
wind momenta ˙Mv∞are generally substantially higher than for OB stars of comparable lumi-
nosity, placing them well above the OB-star line in the above wind momentum–luminosity
relation. In fact, in WR winds the inferred momentum numbers are typically well above the
single-scattering value η = , sometimes as high as η = –50!
This last property has often been cast as posing a WR wind “momentum problem,” some-
times with the implication that it means WR winds cannot be radiatively driven. In fact, it
merely means that, unlike for OB stars, WR winds cannot be treated in the standard, single-
scattering formalism. However, momentum ratios above unity can, in principle, be achieved by
multiple scattering between overlapping thick lines with a velocity-unit frequency separation
Δv < v∞. >Figure 15-14 illustrates this for the simple case of two overlapping lines. But, as dis-
cussed below, the large momentum of WR winds requires much more extensive overlap, with
thick lines spread denselythroughout the spectrum without substantial gaps that can allow radi-
ation to leak out. An overall theme here is that understanding WR mass loss represents more
of an “opacity” than a “momentum” problem.
6.1 Example of Multiple Momentum Deposition in a Static Gray
Envelope
To provide the basis for understanding such multiline scattering, it is helpful first to review
the momentum deposition for continuum scattering. The total radial momentum imparted by
radiation on a spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope can be expressed in terms of the
radiative force density ρgrad integrated over volume, outward from the wind base at radius R,
˙prad = ∫

tered by the bluer line are reemitted with nearly equal probability in the forward or backward
directions, but then further redshifted by the wind expansion into resonance with the redder line.
Because of the gain in radial direction between the line resonances, the red-line scattering imparts
an additional component of outward radial momentum

A particularly simple way to illustrate the requirements of multiple momentum deposition is in

envelope be optically thick, τ > .
> Figure 15-15 provides a geometric illustration of how multiple momentum deposition
occurs in an optically thick envelope. >Figure 15-15a shows the case of a hollow shell with opti-
cal thickness τ = , wherein a photon is backscattered within the hollow sphere roughly τ times
before escaping, having thus cumulatively imparted τ times the single photon momentum, as
given by (> 15.87).

Schematic photon trajectories in (a) hollow and; (b) ﬁlled gray spheres, with part; (c) illustrating
the net “winding”that makes even the ﬁlled case have a persistent net outward push that implies
multiple radial momentum deposition (see text for details)
However, the same momentum deposition also occurs in a solid sphere with the same total
optical depth, even though, as shown in >Fig. 15-15b, photons in this case undergo a much
more localized diffusion without hemispheric crossing.
>Figure 15-15c illustrates how these diffusive vs. direct-flight pictures of multiple momen-
tum deposition can be reconciled by thinking in terms of an effective “winding” around the
envelope. For each scattering within a spherical envelope, the radial momentum deposition is
unchanged by arbitrary rotations about a radius through the scattering point. For >Fig. 15-15c
the rotations are chosen to bring all the scattered trajectories into a single plane, with the
azimuthal component always of the same sense, here clockwise viewed from above the plane.
In this artificial construction, scattering thus leads to a systematic (vs. random walk) drift of the
photon along one azimuthal direction, implying a cumulative winding trajectory for which the
systematic outward push of the scattered photon is now apparent.
6.2 Multiline Transfer in an Expanding Wind
The multiple scattering by a dense ensemble of lines can actually be related to the above
gray envelope case, if the spectral distribution of lines is Poisson, and so is spread through-
out the spectrum without extended bunches or gaps. As first noted by Friend and Castor
(1983), and later expanded on by Gayley et al. (1995), a wind driven by such an effectively
gray line-distribution can be analyzed through an extension of the above standard CAK for-
malism traditionally applied to the more moderate winds of OB stars. In the case of dense
overlap, wherein optically thick lines in the wind have a frequency separation characterized by
a velocity Δv much less than the wind terminal speed v∞, the mean-free-path between photon
interactions with separate lines is given by

ρκeff =
Δv
dvn/dn,
(15.88)
where dvn/dn ≡ˆn⋅∇(ˆn⋅v) is the projected wind velocity gradient along a given photon direc-
tion ˆn. The directional dependence of this velocity gradient implies an inherent anisotropy to
the associated effectively gray line-ensemble opacity κeff. However, a full non-isotropic diffusion
analysis (Gayley et al. 1995) indicates that the overall wind dynamics is not too sensitive to this
anisotropy. In particular, the total wind momentum can still be characterized by the effective

η ≈v∞
Δv .
(15.90)
For winds driven by a gray ensemble of lines, it is thus seen that large momentum factors η ≫
simply require that there be a large number of optically thick lines overlapping within the wind,
v∞≫Δv.
Note that (> 15.90) implies that the mass loss scales as
˙M ≈L
c
c
Δv ,
(15.91)
wherein it is noted that c/Δv just represents the total, spectrum-integrated number of thick
lines, Nthick. It is important to realize, however, that this number of thick lines is not fixed a
priori, but is itself dependent on wind properties like the mass loss rate and velocity law.
Self-consistent solution is again possible though through an extension of the standard CAK
formalism. The key is to account for the fact that radiation entering into resonance of each line
does not in general come directly from the stellar core, but instead has been previously scattered
by the next blueward overlapping line. In the limit of strong overlap, the transfer between lines
can be treated as local diffusion, using however a non-isotropic diffusion coefficient to account
for the directional variation of the velocity gradient. In analogy to the finite-disk correction for
point-star CAK model, one can then derive a “non-isotropic diffusion” correction factor, fnid,
to account for the diffuse angle distribution of the previously line-scattered radiation as it enters
into resonance with then next line. With this factor, one again finds that the mass loss follows a
standard CAK scaling relation (> 15.73)

(15.92)
where f /α
nid is typically about one half (see >Fig. 15-6 of Gayley et al. 1995).
The wind velocity law in such multi-scattering models is found to have a somewhat more
extended acceleration than in standard finite-disk CAK models, with velocity law indexes of
roughly β = .–2. The terminal speed again scales with the effective escape speed, v∞≈vesc.
This analysis shows that, within such “effectively gray” distribution of overlapping lines,
multiline scattering can, in principle, yield momentum numbers η ≫well in excess of the
single-scattering limit. In this sense, there is thus no fundamental “momentum” problem for
understanding WR winds.
6.3 Wind Momentum–Luminosity Relation for WR Stars
As noted above (>Sect. 5.2), this CAK mass-loss law togetherwith the tendencyforthe terminal
speed v∞to scale with the effective escape speed ve implies the wind momentum–luminosity
relation (> 15.75). For WR stars, such comparisons of wind momentum vs. luminosity show a

782 15
Stellar Winds
much greater scatter, but with momenta consistently above those inferred for OB stars, typically
reflecting more than a factor higher mass loss rate for the same luminosity (Hamann et al.
1995). If we assume the same α ≈.that characterizes OB winds, ( > 15.75) suggests that
WR winds must have a line-opacity normalization Q that is more than a factor ≈α/(−α) ≈
higher! Alternatively, this enhanced mass loss could also be obtained through a slightly lower α,
representing a somewhat flatter number distribution in line opacity. For example, for stars with
Eddington parameter Γ ≈/and O-star value for Q ≈, simply decreasing from α = .to
α = .yields the required factor Q
/.−/.≈increase in ˙M.
While such a modest reduction in α may seem more plausible than a large increase in Q, it is
generally not clear what basic properties of WR winds could lead to either type of change in the
line-opacity distribution. In this context, it thus seems useful here to distinguish the classical
momentum problem of achieving the large inferred WR momentum numbers, from an opacity
problem of understanding the underlying sources of the enhanced line opacity needed to drive
the enhanced mass loss of WR winds. The wind momentum vs. luminosity relation given in
(> 15.75) yields a scaling of wind momentum numbers with η ∼L/α−∼L/, implying that
even OB winds should have large momentum numbers, even exceeding the single-scattering
limit, for a sufficiently large luminosity. Viewed in this way, the fundamental distinguishing
characteristic of WR winds is not so much their large momentum number, but rather their
enhanced mass loss compared to OB stars with similar luminosity. Identifying the sources of
the enhanced opacity required to drive this enhanced mass loss thus represents a fundamental,
unsolved “opacity problem.”
6.4 Cumulative Comoving-Frame Redshift from Multiline
Scattering
One can also view this multiline scattering that occurs in a WR wind as a random walk over
wind velocity. To achieve the rms target velocity v∞in random increments of Δv requires step-
ping through (v∞/Δv)lines. Since the expected net redshift from each line interaction is of
order Δv/c, photons undergo a cumulative redshift ΔE/E ≈(v
∞/Δv)Δv/c over the course
of their escape. The associated radial momentum deposition factor is η ≈(ΔE/E)(c/v∞) ≈
v∞/Δv, as found above.
>Figure 15-16 illustrates the comoving-frame redshift for a typical photon as it diffuses in
radius due to multiline scattering. The photon track shown is a characteristic result of a simple
Monte Carlo calculation for a wind velocity law v(r) = v∞(−R/r) and a constant line spacing
Δv = v∞/. Each of the nodes shown represents scattering in one line. In this specific case, the
photon escapes only after interacting with nearly lines, resulting in cumulative redshift of
nearly v∞/c. These are near the statistically expected values of (v∞/Δv)= line scatterings
resulting in a total redshift v
∞/cΔv = v∞/c, as given by the above random walk arguments.
This systematic photon redshift can also be related to the energy loss – or photon “tiring” –
that results from the work the radiation does to accelerate the wind to its terminal speed v∞.
The ratio of wind kinetic energy to the radiative energy represents a “kinetic tiring number”
mkin =
˙Mv
∞
L

c .
(15.93)
Since typically v∞/c < ., it is seen that for WR winds with momentum numbers of order
η ≈, photon tiring is only a ∼5% effect. Although thus not of much significance for either OB

Simulated photon redshift in the comoving frame as a photon executes a random walk through

implies the photon will interact with roughly 102 diﬀerent lines during escape. Since the comoving
redshift between scatterings is v∞/10, this implies a total comoving redshift of 10 v∞
or WR winds, photon tiring does represent a fundamental limit to mass loss, with implications
for understanding the giant eruptions from Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars.
6.5 Role of Line Bunches, Gaps, and Core Thermalization
An essential complication for developing realistic models of WR winds stems from the inher-
ently non-Poisson character of the spectral-line distributions derived from atomic databases of
line lists. At any given wind radius, the dominant contribution to the line opacity stems from
a surprisingly small number of specific ionization stages of abundant heavy metals, primarily
iron and iron-group elements. Moreover, for any given ion stage, the term “structure” is such
that the lines are notably “bunched” into relatively restricted ranges of wavelength. With just a
small number of distinct ion stages, the cumulative line spectrum thus likewise exhibits exten-
sive wavelength bunching. Within the gaps between these bunches, the radiation can propagate
relatively unimpeded by line scattering, thus representing a potential preferential “leakage” that
can significantly reduce the global radiative momentum deposition.
To provide a physical perspective it is helpful to return to the above concept that the line-
ensemble constitutes an effective continuum opacity, but now allowing this to be frequency
dependent to account for the relative bunches and gaps in the spectral distribution of lines.
As seen from (> 15.86), the radiative acceleration for such a non-gray opacity depends on the
spectral integral of the opacity times the frequency-dependentradiation flux. In general, the flux
spectrum at any given location in an atmosphere or wind depends on self-consistent solution
of a global radiation transport problem, with overall characteristics depending critically on the
thermalization and frequency redistribution properties of the medium.

Schematic diagram illustrating the role of line gaps, line bunches, and photon thermalization for
WR wind momentum deposition. The horizontal lines represent the velocity/frequency spacing of
optically thick lines in the wind. The four parts represent: (a) an eﬀectively gray model; (b) a wind
with ﬁxed ionization and extensive gaps; (c) a wind with ionization stratiﬁcation that ﬁlls gaps;
(d) the importance of limiting energy redistribution in the wind
in which the entire spectrum is covered by lines at fixed velocity separation Δv = v∞/. Since
this represents a total effective optical depth τ = for photons to escape from the surface
(v = ) to infinity (v = v∞), the global radiative momentum is ˙prad = L/c, as follows from
(> 15.87).
> Figure 15-17b represents the case when lines have the same concentration Δv = v∞/
in half the spectrum (the bunch), with the other half completely line-free (the gap). Photons
blocked in the bunched region are then rethermalized in the stellar core, and so tend to escape
though the gap. Simple statistical arguments show that only about ./(+ τ/) = /of the
total flux now makes it out through the half of the spectrum covered by the bunch, implying
from (>15.87) that the total radiative momentum is now only ˙prad/(L/c) ≈×/+×/=
/< ! This roughly represents the circumstance applicable to OB star winds, which have
radially constant ionization, and so a radially fixed line spectrum. For such winds, it can be
seen that any significant spectral gaps keep the momentum number to near the single-scattering
limit ˙prad ≈L/c, even if there is very extensive line overlap in spectral line bunches.

> Figure 15-17c represents the case wherein there are again τ = lines covering the full
spectrum, but now over a limited spatial range, occurring very close to the star in one spec-
tral region, and very far away in the other. In the region where line-blocking occurs near the
star, core thermalization again channels photons to the other spectral region. But in this second
spectral region, the blocking occurs far away from the star, with greatly reduced probability
of backscattering to thermal redistribution in the stellar core. Again assuming purely coherent
line scattering in the wind, this means the flux is nearly independent of the outer wind blocking.
Since all the stellar flux must diffuse through a layer somewhere with τ = lines, the global
momentum deposition is now again, as in case a, simply ˙prad = L/c. However, note that the
flux distribution is still similar to case b, that is, in proportion /and /to the spectral
regions corresponding respectively to the inner and outer wind blocking. This thus implies the
same ratio for the relative deposition of radiative momentum. Overall it can be seen that this
example, intended to represent the case of an optically thick WR wind with ionization stratifi-
cation, does indeed illustrate how it is possible to get a large global momentum deposition even
when the line-opacity spectrum is locally divided into gaps and bunches. However, this radia-
tive momentum tends to be deposited more in the outer wind, leaving a net deficit in driving
needed to initiate the outflow in the lower wind. This may play a factor in inducing the inferred
structure and variability of WR winds.
The final example in > Fig. 15-17d illustrates the crucial importance of the assumption
that the radiative transfer within the wind itself is through pure, coherent scattering. If there
is significant thermalization or any other type of spectral energy redistribution within the wind
itself, then radiation will always tend to be channeled into local gaps, thus again limiting the
momentum deposition to a level roughly characterized by the single-scattering limit.
6.6 Summary for Wolf–Rayet Winds
•
The classical “momentum problem” (to explain the large inferred ratio of wind to radiative
momentum, η ≡˙Mv∞/(L/c) ≫) is in principle readily solved through multiple scattering
of radiation by an opacity that is sufficiently “gray” in its spectral distribution. In this case,
one simply obtains η ≈τ, where τ is the wind optical depth.
•
Lines with a Poisson spectral distribution yield an “effectively gray” cumulative opacity, with
multiline scattering occurring when the velocity separation between thick lines Δv is less
than the wind terminal speed v∞. In this case, one obtains η ≈v∞/Δv.
•
However, realistic line lists are not gray, and leakage through gaps in the line spectral
distribution tends to limit the effective scattering to η ≲.
•
In WR winds, ionization stratification helps spread line bunches and so fill in gaps, allowing
for more effective global trapping of radiation, and thus η > .
•
However, photon thermalization can reduce the local effectiveness of line-driving near the
stellar core, making it difficult for radiation alone to initiate the wind.
•
The relative complexity of WR wind initiation may be associated with the extensive
turbulent structure inferred from observed variability in WR wind-emission lines.
•
Overall, the understanding of WR winds is perhaps best viewed as an “opacity problem”, that
is, identifying the enhanced opacity that can adequately block the radiation flux through-
out the wind, and thus drive a WR mass loss that is much greater than from OB stars of
comparable luminosity.
