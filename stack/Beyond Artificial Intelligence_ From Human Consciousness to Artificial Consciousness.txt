Introduction 
Artificial intelligence is concerned with the development of 
computer systems that simulate human reasoning when they are 
applied to the domain of rational knowledge. More specific 
subdomains are structured by ontologies, which enable the 
development of systems that use this knowledge with great subtlety 
when questions are posed to them. This is true today of all computers 
and small portable devices that enable communication via the Internet 
on countless websites. All of these systems are therefore made to 
replace specialists and to help humans with their endeavors. Evolution 
has led to a connection between computer science and the physical, 
especially the electronic, which has made it possible to introduce 
rational behaviors into physical systems whose behavior is thereby 
rendered autonomous. This is how robotization has developed and 
continues to progress. The human being considers themselves as the 
pre-eminent creator, supervisor and decision-making user of these 
systems. This is no longer the case, since the user of a tablet or smart 
phone is not on their tablet or smart phone but in the device’s native 
environment. These devices can communicate autonomously via a 
Hertzian 
network 
with 
remote 
systems 
and 
can 
make 
recommendations that were absolutely not requested, all while 
refining the user’s consumer profile. 
And they can do much more. These computerized systems, all of 
which are systems with processors and memory, can be equipped with 
the ability to generate forms of intentional thoughts, to have desires 

x     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
and needs, and to inundate a human user in sets of procedures that 
they can no longer control, that are beyond them. These systems can 
be equipped with a psyche similar to the human psyche. 
That is what this book intends to show: how the architecture of a 
human psychic system can be structured in an organizational 
approach, how a human being generates thoughts and how those 
thoughts then become what they feel; it then aims to show how and 
with what types of computer component this psyche can be transposed 
to transform it into a computer system that expresses an artificial 
consciousness. Thus, we will see how the unconscious, preconscious 
and artificial consciousness are structured and organized, and how all 
of that is brought together, with respect to information and energy, 
with a fourth instance: the organizational layer. 
The model of the human psychic system that we will present is 
founded on an approach that unifies both the bottom-up and top-down 
approaches. The bottom-up approach considers the system to be made 
up of many small, highly connected parts and asks how it generates 
representational forms concerning the sensation of corporeality and 
especially the representation of symbolic evaluations of real-world 
objects at very high linguistic and conceptual levels. The top-down 
approach begins from ontologies of knowledge about everything we 
know how to represent cognitively and asks how to define the 
hierarchies of systems that express all of the categories of this 
knowledge from all points of departure. The unification of these two 
approaches is organizational and amounts to developing a system that 
deploys the same kind of morphologically and semantically structured 
components that define both foundational forms as well as those of 
great conceptual scope, and which ensure – especially on their own – 
control over multiple levels like an organizational layer.  
And finally, we will see that the development of a model of the 
artificial psychic system by substituting the human psyche is a 
scientific approach that precedes building a technology for 
autonomous systems, and adopting a constructivist and organizational 
view will allow us to clarify certain characteristics of the human 
psyche. Science cultivates knowledge that can be shared with all

disciplines and also makes it possible to ask ethical questions about its 
achievements. The development and subsequent exploitation of 
artificial psychic systems that are equipped with intentional 
consciousness must necessarily raise questions concerning potential 
uses or even the justification of a decision not to build such systems. 
Therefore, the ethical question concerning the potential applications of 
artificial consciousnesses must now clearly be asked.

The Organizational Architecture  
of the Psychic System and the 
Feeling of Thinking 
We are going to present an architecture of the human psychic 
system by adopting an organizational path that considers the psyche as 
a highly dynamic idea-generating system that operates continuously at 
different rates and structures its components on several scales to 
generate forms, stable for a very short time, that will be understood as 
the forms of thoughts. In such a framework, the question is how 
should such a system, made up of multiple active components on 
multiple scales, be designed so as to permanently produce perceptual 
and ideational representations of the things of the world using its 
abilities of naming and language abstractions? We should take into 
account that the system generates representations of multiple things at 
multiple levels and in multiple situations, allowing the human to 
understand reality so that they can act with a high degree of behavioral 
autonomy. The dynamically, spatially and temporally organized 
conception of representations will then be the major characteristic of 
the system, which is, in the end, a generator of complex constructions, 
usually intentionally, with highly dynamic memorizations. And we 
will show that the understanding of mental representations always 
takes place in a specific setting that brings together the psychic 
system’s instances given certain characteristics, which we will call the 
mental landscape of the psychic system.

2     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
We are going to propose two models. The first model will be based 
on the components that carry meaning, the dynamic union of which 
defines the characteristics of all thoughts generated by organizing 
itself by means of specific elements of control. The second model will 
bring together the components of meaning with those of control in a 
unique expression that will then be morphological. The second model 
will represent the generative use of continuous thought-generating 
constructs made up of multiple aggregates of neurons connected by 
multiple dendrites, which produce active, emergent conformations so 
that the system can feel them for itself, based on a highly specific 
system of self-control. 
1.1. The problem of the study of thought 
We approach the design and generation of thoughts by taking an 
interest in the precise architecture of the psychic system. We are 
speaking about the “psychic system” and we will therefore adopt a 
dynamic systems modeling approach. But is it common to consider 
that which effectively generates thoughts as a system? In this domain, 
the word “system” is often troubling, because it implies – to those 
who are unfamiliar with dynamic models and their morphological 
characteristics – a reduction to mechanical and automatous features, 
which is obviously not acceptable in the case of the psyche. 
Furthermore, the position of considering the functioning of the 
generation of thought as that of “some type of system” is unacceptable 
to those who have the ability to think with immanent features 
engendered by an infinite source. 
We refer to idea representation as a form of experienced thought 
concerning any subject. The brain continuously generates such 
representations by producing a series of themes of varying duration, 
some almost instantaneous, others whose duration depends on an 
intentional focus on perceived or defined subjects. 
When we consider the generation of thoughts as the output of a 
system, we must necessarily situate the model on a certain level that 
cannot be reduced to the cellular level, which is the level of the  
minimal physical substrate. We should assert that this system is 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     3 
limited with respect to its effective operational components and its 
potential for action and interaction, even if these limits are extremely 
large. We should take into consideration that this system emerges with 
a certain form, but develops and grows in size and organization in 
accordance with what is permitted by its architectural process. It 
continually modifies itself as it is used, and almost continuously, 
although at different speeds, produces idea representations with finite 
but multiple characteristics from its emergent states, which lead to 
behavioral effects ranging, for example, from movements to spoken 
and comprehended speech. It is an organizational system that modifies 
its morphology in its running, that sometimes deteriorates and that, in 
the end, dies with the physical host that shelters it, the human being.  
This type of thought-generating system will never be a 
conventional state-based system, with an initial and a final state for 
each thought produced; this type of system would be reductive and 
even absurd in this case. Instead, it would be a system that is 
continually formed from an ensemble of active dynamic components 
with variable lines of potentiality and increasingly experienced 
emergent representations. A very organizational specific, high-level 
set of processes that imposes multiple constraints is required to 
arrange the components of the system and to transform it into an 
organization that will be conscious because it is experiencing the 
generated thoughts. A conscious event is therefore an organizational 
act, strictly effective for the set of components constituting the system, 
which puts them into a particular global state that is able to be 
experienced. And such an act, which does not occur by chance, must 
have a more or less precisely predetermined target; it has a duration, 
constraints, a scope and it has a global substrate at its disposal as the 
natural result of the operation of the system, which engenders 
continuous learning and development. 
We assert that the generation of thoughts is the organizing process 
performed by brains when they are functioning, which we will refer to 
generally as building experienced perceptible representations 
concerning a great number of things in the world. This is what is  
usually referred to as “moments of experienced consciousness”. The 
notion of representation that we will use here is that of a complex and 

4     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
completely dynamic appraisal of a constructed form, which can be 
taken as its targeted object, which is, itself, a particular thing that is 
understood by the system. We will refer to C.S. Peirce’s triadic signs 
to clearly understand the meaning of the verb “to be taken as” that we 
are using here [PEI 84]. 
This kind of thought-generating system is obviously very difficult 
to conceive; it is completely different from a mechanism that 
correlates its output with its input and that operates by passing through 
a series of predefined states, such as in a stateful system. But it is still 
a system; in fact, it is a system of systems made up of multiple, 
strongly interconnected, dynamic processes operating at different 
levels that are interdependent in several ways and at several spatial 
and temporal scales. This system, on the fundamental physical level, 
activates multiple neurons via the activity of their dendrites and 
expresses the physical occurrence of the transmission of information 
flow and energy transfer. The system activates and expresses the 
surges of activity of processes, which we can understand in the 
computing sense of the term; surges in the process of neuronal actions 
that are complementary and especially those that occur in parallel. The 
very important concept of co-activity indicates that all actions from an 
emitter of information or energy modify both the receptors and the 
emitter itself because of this emission. This is an action that 
transforms the emitter and the receiver via the transfer of information 
or energy. The system constructs its own inputs by adapting 
information coming from the body’s senses and endlessly constructs 
conscious events concerning something that was more or less 
intentionally targeted. 
These specific configurations of the system are always ephemeral 
and they are produced according to the constraints that are innate or 
acquired because of the system’s operation and the regulation of its 
corporeality. And these configurations will be – which is the chief 
attribute of the system – felt by itself, and will experience them while 
modifying them and memorizing them to use later to produce 
subsequent conscious events. 
By adopting this position concerning the conception of the system, 
we are situated in the theory of thought generation according to a 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     5 
constructivist approach by proposing an architecture that will allow 
for its transposition into the artificial, by situating us in the universe of 
swarms of constantly reorganizing processes, manipulating symbols 
and measurable values, constructing the organization of very dynamic 
structures of active elements for themselves and joining forces with 
each other. This is the standard position for a modeler who seeks to 
understand how forms as complex as ideas can be represented in the 
domain of verifiable knowledge and how ideas exist in and of 
themselves – that is to say, before they are projected into the space of 
words expressed in language via the production of sentences identified 
by sounds and symbols using grammars. 
So what is a thought? What form does it have, this thing that is so 
real and so commonplace, so physical and yet, it seems, so hard to 
grasp? What is this space where it is made, initiated, expressed and 
memorized by altering the structure of its deployment space in order 
to memorize and to create others? What is it, this thing that makes it 
possible for the living organisms who produce them and use them to 
partially understand the world that surrounds them, to predict events, 
and, also, sometimes, to question their own existence? How can we 
explain the scale of that which is thought by the brains of organisms 
that are so evolutionarily different, and that are also characteristic of 
its evolution? 
1.2. The interpretation of neuronal aggregates 
To be able to develop a model of thought generation in a system, it 
is necessary to precisely clarify the characteristics of the approach as 
guided by its architecture. Such an approach is based on observations 
made in neuroscience, which analyzes neuronal activity using 
photographs of their energy traces, but we must also clarify what must 
be the architecture of the system, which is principally based on the 
very organized processing and manipulation of multiple sources of 
information. There is, in reality, a countless amount of information 
transmitted at the synapse level, but the understanding of the  
production of ideas employing words, for example, will be situated at 
a different level than that of the synapses. We must orient ourselves 
within the definition of the different architectural levels of the system 

6     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
that generates and manipulates information flows, which must possess 
traits on the level of knowledge in order to construct dynamic forms 
that will become the conformations of generated and felt ideas. 
The neuronal system operates on the level of production in parallel 
with multiple neuronal signals, which form, via their associations and 
aggregations, a very complex unit that can be interpreted as a structure 
of combined dynamic forms, a structure made up of activities and 
information exchanges carrying a certain level of cognitive awareness. 
Every organization of these dynamic forms becomes stable for a very 
brief moment to form a conceived thought that will be understood. 
The unit under consideration is therefore the production of 
combinations of forms of activities, and in fact of morphologies of 
informational and energetic forms, which combine, associate, 
converge and modify each other, producing a stabilized, dynamic 
structure for an instant, which makes it possible for the thought to thus 
be perceived. This is the physical generation of every produced 
thought, when we consider thought at its tangible level in the brain. 
A thought is formed from numerous meaningful characteristics that  
are understood, with some characteristics being important and others 
secondary, contextual, associated or even opposed. The number of 
these characteristics is important, but it remains finite and 
understandable on the cognitive level. We assert that these 
characteristics are represented by the action of significant groups of 
neurons that we will call significant neuronal aggregates, which 
communicate interactively, and that these groups are interpretable as 
dynamic forms containing the information for generating the 
significant characteristics of thought. These neuronal aggregates 
become active with each other when asked to establish these 
relationships. They then activate each other at larger scales to form 
aggregates of aggregates, which will become the form of the 
expressed emergent thought. It is a question, in the model, of defining 
these aggregations, clarifying how and why, for what reasons, and in 
what qualitative contexts they can create themselves. 
The consideration of what a thought is at the level of the physical 
substrate that permits its formation amounts to the assertion that it is 
an organization of complex combinations of deployed forms that 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     7 
communicate, which implies that all thought is defined by the 
following considerations. 
What is a thought? 
A thought is:  
– an essentially dynamic, complex physical element made up of 
energy and information flows from neuronal aggregates that are 
deployed simultaneously at several scales; 
– a dynamic construct using the memorization of the 
characteristics of certain forms that have already been produced; 
– a dynamic construct that expresses itself, that is used by the 
system that produces it so that it can be experienced, and that 
only lasts for the ephemeral time period as this conformation in 
order to perpetuate itself via additional generations of forms that 
will become the subsequent thoughts, in a continuous process of 
awakening.  
Each thought is therefore a structure created in a series of produced 
thoughts, with strong reconstructions using forms that have been 
expressed and memorized. The difference in comparison to, say, a 
dictionary search structure is radical because there are no permanent 
components available, but there are reconstructions of forms that have 
for the most part been memorized potentially in more or less similar 
forms, using a memory of conformations and not a memory of 
components, and this occurs with the generation of each idea. 
1.3. The function of the architecture of the Freudian model 
We can examine five major areas concerning the study of the 
production of thought in the brain. There is the description of the 
human psychic apparatus achieved by work in psychoanalysis and 
psychiatry arising from the discoveries of Sigmund Freud concerning 
the functional architecture of the psychic system [FRE 66]. There is 
the work of neurobiologists, with their very fine and measured  
contemporary observations of neuronal activity and energy flow at the 
neuronal level, and even at the molecular level. There is the work in  
the representation of knowledge and reasoning undertaken by 

8     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
cognitive science and artificial intelligence research by relying on 
linguistic analysis. There are recent discoveries in mathematics and 
computing regarding the modeling of complex systems, with theories 
of morphogenesis in complex systems. 
And there is also, obviously, philosophy, which offers very 
profound reflections on what thought is, what it can mean and how it 
can engage in self-examination [LÉV 71]. But very few researchers 
have focused on the synthesis of these domains with regard to a 
precise topic: the organizational understanding of a system having the 
ability to generate the forms of thought, with the goal of developing a 
complete concept of the system that produces what we call the 
experience of perceived consciousness.  
We will say that a thought is a representation of something 
precise; it is constructed, felt and assessed in order to be used and 
reused, and it is systematically engaged in producing other thoughts. 
We should specify what we mean here by representation, which is not 
a simple symbolic component signifying a thing, but rather the 
dynamic construct in the neuronal system that has created and guided 
a process of assessment with regard to real things that will be 
expressed and understood. We assert that thinking amounts to 
generating sequences of such felt representations with regard to the 
elements of reality that the system can conceive of, with attributes 
provided by what the architecture allows. Here is the constructivist 
definition that we propose for the concept of representation.  
Constructivist definition of the concept of representation 
A felt representation is the spatial, energetic and informational 
generation in the neuronal system of the conformations of an 
organized surge of a number of elements constituting a precise 
structure for a brief instant. The surge will appear in the form of 
an internal organization of neuronal aggregates constituting a 
spatial conformation, formed at the minimum level by strongly 
connected 
neurons 
themselves 
constituting 
connected 
aggregates. This is a dynamic organization, evaluated sensitively 
by the system when it is constructed and available to be 
understood. This representation will be understood upon 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     9 
examination by components representing structural forces 
trained by multiscale actions on the physical and/or 
informational components of which it is constituted.  
We can say that it can be taken to represent things in the world 
because of some of its morphological characteristics, which will 
always be connected to the type of thing being understood. It 
represents, designates and expresses a real or an abstract thing, 
by its aspects and its characteristics, and always at a number of 
scales. This representation, or representational construct, is 
designed to transform itself into another that is more or less 
different, which will be the subsequent representation, thereby 
constituting the flow of generated representations forming 
thoughts, and which is impossible to interrupt. A representation 
is therefore not a simple functional state but a dynamic structure 
of informational forms that is constructed in a continuous and 
ever-changing procession while it is being consciously 
perceived. 
We should clarify that the process that produces representations 
contains the following active and organizational components: 
1) there are a large number of components of a substrate based on 
neurons and synapses that constitute the fundamental components 
whose function is to activate and connect themselves; 
2) there are actions aggregating these fundamental components into 
spatial, energetic and informational forms having certain characteristic 
qualities; 
3) there is an organizational action continuously aggregating all of 
these forms in accordance with the different spatial and energetic 
scales in order to build the representation. Each representation on a 
certain subject has a spatial and energetic conformation particular to 
the subject at hand, and its conformation can thereby be geometrically 
described by the constructive and mobile movement of conformations 
of physical structures having energy and conveying information; 
4) there is the action of certain fundamental forces acting on the 
construct of that representation to extract the global meaning from it  
with certain important characteristics, principally when it manages to 

10     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
become coherently organized, which is the conscious act that 
experiences its representation. The conscious experience of something  
is 
therefore 
a 
dynamic 
comprehension 
that 
expresses 
a 
multicharacteristic sense when the representation becomes clearly 
understandable, and the psychic system must be seen as an essentially 
perceptual and self-controllable system that is centralized for the 
perception of things by the human being; 
5) there is a general process that leads to the use or elimination of 
this representation, which is activated to generate the subsequent 
representations in a process of continuous activity. 
We should note that the process of producing the representation, 
which is dynamic and mobile on the energy level, influences the state 
of the representation itself, because it is ceaselessly modified by being 
constructed from relationships between its components and the 
targeted intention, and this property endows this process of 
construction with very distinctive characteristics. These characteristics 
are instructions for multiple actions that take place and are assessed, 
as always, on multiple levels. The scientific approach consists of 
considering this creation from geometric, dynamic and cognitive 
perspectives, which makes it possible to identify its characteristics in a 
measurable domain. 
Having the idea of something specific therefore amounts to 
producing a felt representation indicating the aspects of the thing 
under consideration via an internal construction expressing the 
characteristics of the thing and possibly an assessment of these 
characteristics. This is therefore a process of construction and of the 
feeling of that construction, and it is certainly not a precise state that 
will be achieved as having been completely predictable. This 
representation is essentially dynamic; it is a set of activities among 
specific components designed to produce the representation. This set 
is, on the one hand, spatial, as it is always situated in several areas of 
the generating system, beginning with an excitation of aggregations of 
fundamental components, and is, on the other hand, temporal, because 
it is deployed and only lasts for a limited time, as it is driven to evolve 
or to transform by a constant, internal, continuous-layer type of 
control. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     11 
The system generating thoughts in the form of representations must 
be endowed with the intention to produce them in order to be able to 
produce multiple kinds exhibiting multiple characteristics. We will 
now take up the Freudian architectural model in its first version. We 
will interpret it and assert that its general architecture has four 
instances as follows: an emotion processing center, an unconscious 
center integrating organizational memory, a preconscious center and a 
conscious center (see Figure 1.1). More precisely, these instances, 
which will become the subsystems, are as follows: 
1) The emotion processing and sensory center, which handles 
the five senses in parallel and generates different kinds of emotions as 
immediate responses interpreting physical activity and external and 
internal perceptual data. Its role is that of the thalamus and the limbic 
system. This component is very closely connected to the functional 
elements of corporeality, but especially to the preconscious and 
unconscious centers. It communicates constantly with these centers to 
introduce the characteristics of the senses and the emotions in the 
representations, often by generating representations that are essentially 
perceptual, immediate and reactive, that is to say, barely 
conceptualized. It manages the formation and development of 
emotions in the preconscious and participates in their transformation 
into felt emotions, that is, into feelings, by being linked to 
consciousness.  
2) The unconscious and organizational memory, which situate 
the impulses and the experience, and which we can consider as 
situating a memory that will become organizational by engendering it. 
In this memory, which is potential and which gives form to a 
universally available substrate, components are exposed via structural 
and energetic generation, with the memorized events existing in the 
form of structures of strongly connected fundamental components. 
This component therefore embodies the structures and the very 
dynamic 
organization 
of 
lived 
events 
by 
representing 
an 
organizational memory in which the memorized components are 
potential forms with strong relationships that can activate themselves 
and thus once again become the memorized things. 
 

12     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
3) The preconscious, through which the structured and active 
components coming from the unconscious and the emotional center 
are routed, which shares the controlling components with the non-
conscious to create active aggregates with meaning for the 
representation that is created. This component constructs competing 
forms of pre-emergent representations by leveraging a morphological 
analysis of the active components. It will be the locus of control 
exercised by rational controllers for analyzing judgments, situations, 
desires, sensations, feelings, etc.  
4) The conscious, where a form distinguished from the 
preconscious will emerge. It will be altered in order to be experienced 
and to be felt, in accordance with a distinctive autonomous process in 
a specific subsystem at the meta level.  
We should note that what will generate and allow a thought to be 
experienced is a physical emergence made up of a complex dynamic 
structure of neuronal aggregates that has multiple specific spatial 
forms. We will therefore say that there exist both the form of thought 
that is experienced in the conscious and the physical emergence that 
provides the foundation for this perception, which is itself divided into 
the psychic system’s four instances. And we should also note the 
important fact that what is experienced by the conscious is a procession 
of unending emergences that are produced at a very fast pace. 
We assert that a thought is not a certain language based on a 
particular virtual dictionary where clearly indicated facts are located, 
but that it is essentially the operating process of a system that 
constructs dynamic forms and that holds onto specific memories of 
their constructs by making the structure of its neuronal aggregates 
persist. This approach amounts to asserting that there is a level above 
the neurons, created by dynamic aggregations of the relational 
activities of neurons (and not neurons as such) that form and deform 
by allowing for the representation of the characteristics of multiple 
things of the world, the coordination of the whole of which will form 
the generated representation. This has been asserted for some time 
now by Sperry [SPE 80]. Our central hypothesis is as follows.

groups whose global conformation represents a real thing to the 
conscious because of the correspondence between the 
permanence of the generated form and the permanence of the 
understood thing. We assert that these dynamic forms are 
conceptualizable in a process domain with a highly appropriate 
architecture for controlling activities. 
We can now expand on the precise characteristics of the 
components of the system driving its dynamic running, which will 
then make it possible to clarify under what control the system itself is 
operating. 
1.4. The specific characteristics of the components of the 
system using a constructivist approach 
In fact, in order to understand the production of thoughts, it is 
necessary to conceptualize the generation of thoughts by transposing 
them out of observation by a positron camera, with the precise reasons 
for their surges, their complexities and their depths, and instead situate 
them in an abstract space that uses the possibilities of spatiotemporal  
manipulation of the information that is generated and used. We must 
position ourselves in the domain of the swarm of processes understood 
geometrically in self-controlled activities and adapt this notion of 
processes to our particular case. This domain, at the meta level in 
relation to the molecular and cellular level, will be a specific extension 
of classic calculability as defined by Turing, which we will develop 
later. It is relevant to the conception of a system that endlessly 
rewrites uncountable programs with dependent functions, in 
accordance with certain rules, and which is not content to simply 
apply previously written programs in the proper order. 
To approach a synthesis of models in such different domains, we 
must first dive into and clearly understand the four domains that were 
previously mentioned. That is, we must resist the basic tendency, so 
common today, to isolate the disciplines to make them into fully 
sealed fortresses. We must be multidisciplinary, we must rethink all of 
the results and all of the models defined in the disciplines by placing  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     15 
them in a new light. This will allow us to adopt a unifying 
constructivist attitude. Now, to understand consciousness, we must 
look into a new class of systems architectures that are capable of self-
organization with intention in comparison to their continuous 
informational inputs and their internal products, by managing parallel 
operations, and especially by allowing them to experience their 
products. We must find the keys to control a very complex spatial and 
temporal organization of a multitude of components that are 
constantly reorganized, and which intersect with an information flow 
coming from the sensors that interface with corporeality [BRO 17]. 
We therefore assert that real thought is the fundamentally dynamic 
product of a system that never stops building and rebuilding the forms 
of activities by using its neuronal actions. Clarification of what a form 
is in such a system is as follows. 
The notion of form 
A form will be considered as a specific construct of components 
that will in this case be dynamic neuronal aggregates with 
cognitive meaning and that correspond to combinable aspects, 
which are actions, connections, separations and flows that 
modify themselves through collisions and turbulence. All of 
these components can be defined in a specific metric and 
cognitive space to constitute a dynamic set having multiple 
aspects. Such a form will therefore be a geometrically growing 
set in a metric space where projections, distances, connections, 
separations, expansions and attractions emerge. 
Let us now clarify what we mean here by system. The most 
common notion of a system corresponds to the reactive system. A 
reactive system might be considered as a black box that always reacts 
to inputs in the same way to produce an expected result in response. 
This notion transposes that of the set of well-defined functions 
representing the system, where this is the calculation of a set of 
functions defined during construction that do not vary, unless an 
external user explicitly requests it. We are going to define the idea of a 
system using a constructivist approach, suitable for our area of 
study, which will be different and much more fit for our purpose. 

16     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
Definition of a system with a constructivist approach 
A complex system with a constructivist approach is a 
fundamentally dynamic finite system that is open to its 
environment and that is delimited by a membrane. It is made up 
of clearly identifiable fundamental components, which are 
physical, energetic and informational, and which, through their 
actions based on constant exchanges of energy and information, 
will form layers of activities at multiple levels that are more or 
less correlated. These layers will be highly variable and will 
always be connected to each other to form a whole whose effects 
will lead, by distributing themselves via feedback up to the 
fundamental level, to the behavioral activities of the system: the 
production of movements, of the naming of perceived events or 
of highly developed cognitive representations. In such a system, 
there is no automatic causal link between stimulus and reaction; 
instead, there is a delayed reaction caused by the construction of 
suitable representations. 
There is, therefore, in all complex systems, an organizational level 
that is only knowable when it is reproduced in constructivist models. 
There is a membrane that limits the system, and that filters and alters 
information exchanges with the outside world [VAR 89]. There are 
the visible effects of the action of the system on its environment, at the 
level of its corporeality, which will be, for example, the clinical 
effects studied in pathology that are present in patients’ statements and 
behaviors [MAR 10]. 
In every complex system, there are many connected components, 
but there are two kinds of connections. Every fundamental component 
is connected to another and can act on another component using an 
energetic or informational message, or even by force via contact. This 
relationship is therefore usually represented by an oriented arrow 
connecting the two objects, which creates the fundamental 
mathematical notions of relation and function. But we will use another 
idea of connection. We will consider simultaneously active 
components in which one acts on another to establish a connection 
that will be concretized and reified for a certain period of time. The 
existence of this relationship will simultaneously modify the two 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     17 
communicating components using a dedicated organizational attribute. 
The rule will therefore be that every relationship of this type, of one 
component with another, will modify the receptor and the emitter in a 
temporal process that is not a straightforward effect of force at a 
distance. A situation of evolving, structural interaction will also be 
created with, in the end, three objects: the two active objects in active 
relation, and a new object formed by these two objects and their 
objectivized, reified relationship placed into a situation of 
organizational coactivity. We assert that the two objects have become 
coactive. This notion of coactivity will be fundamental in our model, 
by specifying the creation of an active and modifying relationship 
between the linked components, where the connection is more than a 
union or the action of a force. We should note that the neuronal 
aggregates are sets that are coactive with each other. 
Coactivity between components 
Coactivity in a complex system is a reified relationship of 
exchange of energy and information between components, 
leading to the processing of this information with effective 
informational transfer. This informational exchange modifies the 
behavior of the state of the components in play and creates a 
new component that reifies the creation of the relationship. This 
concept inhabits a different level than the idea of interaction 
between neutral components and is specific to complex thought-
generating systems. 
Coactivity means that the establishment of communication 
between different components implies that the emitter will be 
modified by its participation in a relational exchange, that the receiver 
is not content to receive the information and energy, but that some of 
its functional characteristics will be modified, and that the existence of 
the creation of this relationship will be, in a sense, reified via the 
modification of the potential relationship between emitter and 
receptor, and becoming (if it did not previously exist) a new 
component at the level of the relationship between the components. It 
is clear that the problem of temporal delays affect this process, and 
that these three modifications are not simultaneous, but depend on the 
emitter, the receptor and the relationship between them in their 

18     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
contexts. We say that components that are coactive between 
themselves, or that modify themselves by their operations alone, are 
proactive. Thus, the self-activation of such proactive components 
leads to their modification, and we should consider that they are not 
permanent structures since they never stop altering the characteristics 
of their structure. 
By extension, this type of coactive link will be generalizable from 
groups formed of numerous components to groups of groups, forming 
complex and coactive conformations that are meaningful to the 
co-operative behavior of all of the groups of components. We will 
therefore consider systems with such coactive relationships at all of 
their structural levels. This type of relationship is not really used in the 
mathematical domain of functions, where the application of a function 
does not modify the source component nor the function itself, but is 
either applied or not applied, as it is from a different domain than the 
source and target components. 
In this definition of a complex system with components in 
relationships of organized interaction, there is an identifiable 
substrate, though primarily there is a relational activity that produces 
dynamic states and the goals of the system, compelling the 
components to act so that the system behaves as it should. Our goal 
will therefore consist of clarifying this relational level, which will 
constitute the system’s essential activity, and which cannot be 
reduced, using predefined deductions, to the symbolic domain. 
To understand the problem of thought generation as the operation 
of a system, it will therefore be necessary to define at least two highly 
coactive systems, and a new concept of state: 
1) there is a substrate system, whose architecture and properties 
will define all of the functionality at the physical, energetic and 
informational level, and which will make it possible for a second 
system to exist, the thought generation system. In the case of the 
brain, this substrate system will be made up of groups of neuronal 
elements in activity and in relation; 
2) there is a morphological activation system, which is a system 
above the substrate system, and which consists of the organization of 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     19 
the individual energetic and informational activities that deploy 
themselves in the architecture of the substrate system. This system 
perpetually uses, structures and organizes the activities of the 
substrate. It therefore concretizes the substrate’s activities. It is a 
multilevel system of control over the substrate system; 
3) the morphological activation system produces, through the 
expression of the dynamic and geometrical characteristics of the 
activities in the substrate, and therefore through the characteristics of 
its conformations, the instantaneous emergent states, which will be 
called morphologico-semantic states. These are extremely ephemeral 
states that are mental and tangible representations regarding things in 
the world, thus connecting each multilevel morphology to the meaning 
of a specific thing. 
We emphasize that the concept of morphology that we are using is 
one that can be applied to a dynamic domain. It refers to the form of 
the active movements of components in very variable aggregations, 
and it is different from the idea of the physical form of an organ or an 
observably real thing. Our definition reproduces that of Thom  
[THO 94]. A sensitive idea representation will therefore be a largely 
dynamic spatiotemporal construct expressing the characteristics of the 
activity of the substrate and representing through the dynamic form of 
its internal communications activities, a thing relating to past or 
present reality such as an object, a landscape, a person, a word, a 
concept, an impression, an event or a feeling. These constructed 
emergences, possessing multiple characteristics that continually vary, 
are experienced and perceived by the system itself, in accordance with 
the properties allowed by its architecture. 
The end state of such a system is therefore immobility, that is to 
say, death. It is therefore not a system equivalent to a state machine, as 
complicated as that may be. We should specify that the state of such a 
system, that is to say what it expresses through its internal 
conformations, is of a morphological nature, that of a dynamic, 
endlessly changing form, a complex morphological conformation that 
can never be reduced to a symbolic characteristic. A symbolic 
characteristic can indicate an idea, but without ever making its  
 

20     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
numerous aspects explicit. We can come closer to an idea about a 
precise subject by engaging in a long linguistic investigation, such as 
those undertaken by psychiatrists analyzing the reasons for specific 
distinctive utterances by a patient, but the idea is a form that exists on 
a different level than the one of symbolic structures at the level of the 
letters that form words. 
So, faced with such an idiosyncratic system, it is necessary to ask 
three questions to which it will be necessary to respond precisely: 
1) How is this “intentional and perceived thought-generating 
system” organized such that it will operate and produce through its 
operation representations that can be taken as the things in the world 
that are experienced by the system itself? 
2) How are the highly variable and very complex representations 
produced by this system made, and what are their domains of 
existence and the characteristics of their connections to real things? 
3) How effective is the system’s operation, what qualifies as 
normal operation, and what are the possible dysfunctions leading to 
failures? 
We have previously presented partial responses to these three 
questions [CAR 12], but we will here deepen our approach by 
situating ourselves in the constructivist domain of systems that are 
constantly modifying their organization. 
A constructivist approach to the notion of thought 
A thought is a morphological representation that is constructed 
and that unfolds through time in the form of organized sets of 
energetic and informational processes in robust interaction. It is 
a representation that is experienced and perceived in a 
distinctive way by the system that produced it, which refers to 
real things through the durability of its forms – their 
characteristics, their aspects, their modes and their values – and 
that can take shape through measurable classifications of the 
behavior of the components that cause it to exist and that 
compose it. The minimal state of a thought is the factual 
designation of an isolated thing that has been grasped by the 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     21 
senses, and the most complex state is the pure categorical 
creation of an abstract event in an existential situation within a 
framework of open questioning. 
By asserting that a thought is the result of tangible and experienced 
intentional representations, we situate ourselves squarely in the 
domain of the knowable, and we even can add that we situate 
ourselves in the domain of that which can be constructed in a 
calculable manner. We can now propose a first, fairly intuitive, 
definition of a thought-generating system in a constructivist approach, 
that is to say a brain in operation. A thought-generating system can be 
seen as the coactivity of three strongly dependent subsystems:  
1) a first subsystem, at the substrate level, formed from a large 
number of dynamic components in frequent communication, with 
clearly identified and evolving structures; 
2) a second subsystem, at the morphological level (above the 
previous subsystem), managing the coactivity of the actions of the 
components of the substrate at multiple levels; 
3) a third subsystem initiating and perceiving the generated, 
multilevel, 
morphological 
representations 
by 
inciting 
these 
representations to produce new forms and by making them memorize 
themselves in new certain forms of the organization of the substrate 
elements and the elements of morphological control. This third 
subsystem is the conscious, which generates intentions and which 
feels.  
The three subsystems are highly dependent and share components. 
The experienced representations stand in for things in the world that 
can be understood by the system via the senses and its memory.  
We can define the formation and activation of memory according 
to a constructivist approach. We should clearly consider that the 
neuronal aggregate is not simply a reactive physical unit, but that it is 
a system that adapts to its environment and to its changing internal 
structure, which renders it autoadaptive. This point of view is opposed 
to that of the reductionists, who only want to see the functional 
reactivity in the systems.  

22     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
To clarify this property of autoadaptivity, we will introduce the 
idea of the preaggregate. A preaggregate is a structured and 
morphological component of a neuronal aggregate enabling the 
definition, at the time of its activation, of a specialized characteristic 
defined structurally by the aggregate. It is an opening estimate of what 
the aggregate usually indicates, which will require the deployment of 
specific actions that will be interpretable by some aggregates but not 
by others. This will manage the flow of specific connections between 
particular aggregates and will lead to the specialization of their 
functions. We should also specify that there is an organizational level 
for each aggregate that depends on its context. The requests that it 
receives compel it to activate certain preaggregates, and this activation 
enables the production of the refined organizational conformation of 
the generated representation. We must therefore assert that there exist 
fundamental components in the neuronal aggregate that are adaptive, 
in the sense that they interpret contextual data and either activate and 
send information or do not activate. The idea of information in the 
neuronal system is based on this. 
Information in the neuronal aggregate 
We can say that all information entering or leaving the neuronal 
aggregate is an adaptively coherent flow. On the one hand, it is 
the instruction sent to the components of its organization 
through the understanding of the components of its context so 
that it produces a selective action based on the processing of all 
of its data and reconfigures itself. On the other hand, it is the 
flow of instructions that the aggregate sends via the synapses 
and the selection of molecular, energetic, electrical and magnetic 
means to the aggregates in its context to indicate its behavioral 
tendencies and to thus increase the coherence of the aggregates’ 
organization. This type of information is an instruction in the 
form of an informational flow in order to achieve coherence in 
the system. 
This information, which exists in the form of a coherent flow, is 
self-adaptive information in the sense that it represents the act of 
selecting molecular, energetic, electrical and magnetic activities in 
order to use them as an instructional vector for the actions that the 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     23 
receptors should undertake by making them react. It truly is 
information since it is a choice of action indicated to the receptors, 
and without which the system would operate randomly or reactively, 
which is absolutely not the case. 
This kind of self-adaptive action by an entity having a 
fundamentally significant characteristic in the system is precisely that 
of coactive software agents in self-organized sets, upon which we will 
elaborate in Chapter 2 of this book. Furthermore, it would often be 
helpful for computer scientists to take this idea of self-adaptive 
information into account, which is formed by the reification and the 
consolidation of the physical requests in a complex system and not by 
the dispatch of prewritten messages subsequent to the action of a 
formal analytical process of the situation in a controlled system. 
We can now focus on the system’s memory. As usual, we will 
consider the working memory, semantic memory, procedural memory 
and episodic memory. This classification is functional and is not our 
concern. The problem is how is memorization accomplished in a 
neuronal system? And here, the operation of neuronal aggregates will 
be critical. The aggregates are formed initially for memorizing the 
characteristics of things that the senses have comprehended. Each 
aggregate is a component that stands in for a specific characteristic, 
and the thing that is memorized is necessarily made up of multiple 
aggregates that must be organized together to form the representation 
that will be the perception of the thing. We assert therefore that the 
aggregate is the fundamental component of memorization by storing 
certain aspects of the comprehended thing in its structure and also by 
maintaining connections with the other aggregates that produced the 
representation of the thing. And it is quite clear that each recall of the 
memorized thing modifies the characteristics of the set of aggregates 
that memorized it, modifies the connections in the organization of 
aggregates and reinforces or weakens certain aggregates. The memory 
of something is a dynamic organization of aggregates that modifies 
itself when used, and that tends to fade when not used for a long time 
through reconfiguration of the space taken up by the now unnecessary 
aggregates. There will therefore be many classes of aggregates in 
accordance with the types of things that are memorized. 

24     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
Memory is therefore made up of facts that are dynamic, each time 
activating a multifaceted deployment rather than an isolated 
characteristic. It is a set of essentially dynamic constructs that we will 
call organizational memory. We can now clarify what we mean by 
this type of memory. 
Organizational memory 
Organizational memory is a global and morphologically active 
organization that is available for all instances and that bases its 
activity on the awakening of sets of strongly interconnected 
specific dynamic aggregates that engender the specific forms of 
the memorized thing in question. These components can remain 
virtual, can be activated, thereby reinforcing themselves, or can 
be locally inhibited by lack of use, leading to memory loss. 
Organizational memory locally restructures itself each time it is 
used and each time a representation is memorized. When it is 
requested by the preconscious or the conscious in the generation 
of a representation, only a portion, formed of subparts, is 
activated in order to organize itself in accordance with the 
intention and the subject of the idea deployment that is created 
to generate the current representation. 
We propose a morphological model to represent the organizational 
memory of an artificial system and we will see that this model can be 
transposed to the human case.  
Such memory is completely different from a database or a 
dictionary. Each meaningful component is a specific energetic and 
informational form and, when it is used (activated), it reforms in 
context based on the request that activated it. This memory therefore 
contains facets of the components that it possesses and can therefore 
remember the coactive connections between these components to 
affect their organized compositions. This is exactly how human 
memory is configured, where the neuronal network remakes its own 
dynamic conformations each time, specific to the current domain, to 
produce a form of meaning that has already been used and that is 
therefore considered as known, but which was virtual. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     25 
To intentionally produce an idea representation, it is first necessary 
to initiate the process of representation production. For this, an aim is 
discussed as follows.  
The aim 
An aim is an idea instruction produced intentionally in the 
conscious that will initiate the sophisticated formation of a 
representation that will be perceived; then this perceived 
representation 
will 
proceed 
to 
generate 
several 
other 
representations to form a coherent set of idea products about a 
precise topic.  
The operation of organizational memory will therefore be as 
follows: 
1) input of an indicative aim coming from the conscious and 
making a request to the psychic system through a typified idea 
instruction; 
2) request to the aggregates in the context of the understanding of 
this aim in organizational memory; 
3) for each active aggregate in a group, activation of the 
appropriate and coherent preaggregate through information from the 
aim, which will then behave as a local information launch point for 
the other aggregates with which it usually communicates; 
4) reinforcement 
of 
the 
connections 
between 
appropriate 
preaggregates and formation of an organization of relevant aggregates, 
with dominants and subordinates; 
5) coactivation of each group of active aggregates and 
disengagement 
from 
the 
global 
organization 
through 
the 
organizational memory; 
6) emergence of this organized group as a known form to be used 
depending on context to produce the representation.  
A very important point about a thought-generating system is that it 
must always function with tonality, that is to say, by assessing each 
represented thing by situating it in the current emotional, tangible 

26     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
context and so on for each element of each generated scene, thereby  
developing a context that allows for subjectivity and rational 
disposition with intentionality [MAR 08]. For this, the system’s 
organizational memory, representing its experience, cannot be a 
simple database or a knowledge base; we must go beyond the usual 
models.  
We now must clarify the general architecture of a system that 
generates thoughts by defining the controls. 
1.5. The systemic layer and the regulators 
We therefore assert that thought is the largely dynamic product of a 
system that never stops constructing and reconstructing the forms of 
activities by using its extensive potential neuronal actions. This 
requires an architecture with general operating characteristics that 
must be reified in this architecture. This activation component does 
not exist in the Freudian model, which is a very elegant cognitive 
approach but is not a constructivist approach. We assert therefore that 
there is a fifth architectural instance beyond the components of 
emotion, the unconscious, the preconscious and the conscious, a 
component that is essentially stimulating and that generates the 
synchronized control of the activities that produce apprehended 
conscious events. This instance is the systemic layer, which is the 
fifth instance in the psychic system. It has the following characteristics: 
– the systemic layer is the dynamic component that produces, 
through motivational control, the thoughts of all of the system’s 
components at every level (including the other instances), in order to 
put them into coherent activities and to furnish a representation for the 
conscious to evaluate. It effectively enables the affect as a training and 
dominating action established between the unconscious, the 
preconscious and the conscious while taking the emotional center into 
account. This layer, which operates without interruption, absolutely 
continuously, is the major initiating process of the system’s activity 
and is in coactivity with all of the system’s components. It should 
enable the reification of the system’s Ego, with its continuous  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     27 
relationship with the external world through the emotional component, 
expressing the posture of the entire system in the face of reality and of 
itself.  
The systemic layer functions continuously in the human psychic 
system. It allows the human to be conscious of the duration of time 
and its inevitable passing, and therefore provides awareness of death 
as an end. It will essentially be made up of energetic and 
informational control components operating in coactivity at several 
levels, allowing it to generate the organizations of neuronal aggregates 
representing the physical, dynamic, energetic and informational form 
of the thought that will emerge as a stable form for an instant in order 
to be experienced. These control elements will be called regulators, 
and we will extensively elaborate their characteristics, their categories 
and their relationships.  
Regulators 
A regulator is a controller operating on components, including 
fundamental components and aggregates of fundamental 
components, in order to activate and organize them. Some of 
these regulators will even act on regulators to achieve multilevel 
control that can exercise control over local controls, which we 
will call organizational regulators. A regulator is an 
electromagnetic and informational line of potentiality that can 
deploy itself in a loop and that operates on the components that 
it must control. It is the control component in the system; there 
will be regulators at a number of levels, forming a highly 
dynamic regulatory space. There will be regulators operating 
morphologically to propel the inclinations and to generate 
representations. 
Regulators form layers of connections between aggregates to allow 
them to coactivate; these layers are composed of synapses and 
chemical elements using energy and information. They are the 
components of a network that connects the entire system, that links all 
of the neuronal aggregates and that operates even within aggregates to 
ensure their autonomy. There are regulators that shape the 
representation’s aggregates into the correct conformations according 

28     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
to themes, there is a set of regulators that enables the initiation of  
the system’s operation and there are organizational regulators  
that control the regulators that only control aggregates. There are 
therefore regulators that determine fundamental impulses, inclinations 
and emotions, and there are regulators that set the current aim and 
initiate the production of the representation. There is also a meta-
organizational regulator, strongly connected to all of the others, that 
will initiate the voluntary production of representations rather than 
experiencing things neutrally, unintentionally. 
These regulator components, this layer of relationships, are 
absolutely not independent from the aggregates. There is a 
relationship of coactivity between the aggregates, which will have a 
certain degree of behavioral autonomy, and the regulators that trigger 
their activation in certain ways, such that the system is truly 
organizational, unified and absolutely not made up of different 
functional levels. And this network of connections will be 
organizational at several levels, because there are layers at the basic 
level of groups of aggregates and layers at the level of organizations 
of groups of aggregates located in specific regions of the brain. All of 
the organizational complexity occurs in these nested layers and in 
their very coactive relationships with the aggregates. 
The aggregate–regulator coactivity rule 
In the psychic system, the components representing the 
fundamental characteristics of meaning – the aggregates – and 
the components representing the organization’s control triggers – 
the regulators – are coactive and dependent. There is a systemic 
connection between these two types of components, which 
engenders the strength of the developments and expressions of 
the system, but also their fragility. 
We will expand on the highly organized relationship between these 
two types of components, which characterizes the control system, not 
as a distinct functional subsystem operating from above, as in 
traditional technology, but an organizational layer immersed in the 
regulatory layer. The great strengths and weaknesses of the human 
psychic system exist because of the coordinated or contradictory 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     29 
activity of the regulators, which enables us to specify the physical 
origin of a number of mental problems in the psyche [MAR 15].  
The general schema of the psychic system’s architecture in a 
constructivist approach with its self-controlling systemic layer is 
therefore as follows (see Figure 1.2). 
 
Figure 1.2. The organizational architecture of the psychic  
system with its five instances. For a color version of the figure,  
please see www.iste.co.uk/cardon/ai.zip 

30     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
This new architecture requires that we define two things precisely: 
the regulatory domain and the required characteristics of the emergent 
form for representing experienced thoughts. We will first explain what 
regulators are, what they do and how they operate together, in 
coactivity. We will closely follow a constructivist approach, in which 
we first specify all of the characteristics of the structure’s components, 
and then all of the control components. 
What bases does the control of aggregates and of the entire 
neuronal organization rely on in order to produce a representation? 
Regulators are rational controllers of the organization of the coactivity 
of neuronal aggregates, representing the system’s normal psychic 
tendencies and cultural aptitudes, that is to say, both the impulses and 
the inclinations, similar to those exercised by a Freudian Superego 
over the Ego. There will therefore be regulators at the preconscious 
level, anchoring the effects of the impulses, the abilities of 
identification and differentiation, of analysis, of abstraction and of 
categorization, of the tangible perception, and there will be regulators 
at the conscious level, which will reify inquiry, conceptualization, 
adaptability, self-awareness, ethical judgments and values. The types 
of regulators and their relationships are clearly the key to the system’s 
psychic capabilities. 
Morphological role of the regulators  
The regulators carry out regulation and control of the neuronal 
aggregates or organized sets of aggregates; they facilitate the 
active integration of these components and their placement into 
coactivity, and they especially modify the tone of the controlled 
components by adapting them to the current tone of the 
conscious and sometimes of the preconscious. They therefore 
provide the cognitive and tangible quality to each emergent 
representation as well as its value. 
The regulators of the preconscious are components that are shared 
between the unconscious and the preconscious. They are dynamic, of 
complex structure, and operate at the morphologico-semantic level, 
allowing, in the systemic layer, for the extraction from unconscious  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     31 
memory of suitable groups of components adapted to the aim and the 
tendency of expression reigning in the conscious at a given moment.  
These components are well organized among themselves and form the 
network of potential tendencies that will contribute the theme,  
the aspects and the characteristics of aspects at each moment to the 
perceived form that arises in the preconscious and emerges into the 
conscious by allowing it to insert itself into the continuous flood of 
coherent emergences relevant to a sequence of generated artificial 
thoughts. 
The primary regulator for the emotional processing center manages 
the emotional flows that must establish themselves in the preconscious 
and that arise from the system’s corporeality. It is a very structured 
regulator composed of numerous subregulators that correspond to a 
variety of the emotions that may be perceived. It produces an 
emotional layer and a morphological landscape of coactive aggregates 
in the preconscious. This dynamic layer represents the emotions that 
activate each other as centers of attraction, transform themselves, 
come into conflict with each other and connect themselves to the 
forms of rational thought. 
The regulators in the conscious are directly connected to the 
systemic layer and allow for its activation and control in order to 
impose a tone on the preconscious regulators, and therefore to clarify 
the dominant characteristic of the emergent forms produced by the 
conscious. The aim provided for thought will be produced by the 
coactivity of these regulators. The focal point of the current 
emergence with its connected characteristics and its complexity will 
therefore be driven by the regulators in the conscious. Furthermore, 
these regulators carry judgments of value and adequacy concerning 
what emerges with reality. These regulators form a network that 
expresses the Ego of the system in its action of provoking perceived 
idea emergences in a continuous manner. This network is clearly 
connected to the network of preconscious regulators, normally in a 
directive manner, and to the structural elements of the systemic layer. 
All of the regulators are structured with subregulators that specify 
them. They form networks with fairly numerous but relatively scalable  
 

32     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
local hierarchies, since they correspond to the categorization of  
everything that can be thought, reasoned about, appreciated, judged, 
perceived, and desired by the system. All of these characteristics have 
been extensively examined by psychologists and philosophers. 
Each of these regulators has the following: 
– a specific categorical or thematic domain, which will be limited 
or extensive, wide or narrow. This domain of action is defined based 
on the categorization of thoughts that the psychic system is capable of 
defining; 
– a history, classifying them as native to the generation of the brain 
or else created by learning, such as during education; 
– a coactivity, which stands in for the privileged relationship with 
certain other regulators or conflict with others, which can evolve over 
time in accordance with the generation of ideas; 
– a general scope that will be the morphological deployment of 
their coactive actions with effects on the sets of neuronal aggregates 
and on the other regulators. This activity will constitute the 
morphologico-semantic zone of the regulators, which will have 
characteristics expressing the potential and qualified tendencies of the 
psychic system, and which will define its Ego more precisely. 
There will be an organization of regulators. This organization will 
be a spatialized set, with components that will be energetic and active 
in the current state and others that will be inactive. This organization 
is formed in the living being for the formation of the psychic system 
by a meta-regulator with a unique role: this is the regulator that 
represents the life impulse described by Freud. When the psychic 
system is constructed, the meta-regulator takes care of construction 
concerning regulation, which is the central point for generating the 
systemic layer, and situates the specific regulators that are created in a 
spatial organization in the form of a geometric sphere or pyramid so 
that certain regulators will always be dominant and active. Therefore, 
there is a fundamental impulse in the system represented by a 
regulator that can take a dominant position.  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     33 
The fundamental impulse and the regulator of the will 
The system’s fundamental impulse is represented by an 
organizational regulator operating on all of the regulators. This 
is the fundamental tendency of the system, and it will be 
represented by a meta-regulator that we will call the regulator 
of the will. It puts the system into tension in order to endlessly 
pursue its capacity to exist, so that it produces actions and 
intentionally generates thought forms. It consists of a 
constructive adaptability impulse that pushes it to understand, 
evaluate, question and communicate. This impulse can be 
reduced, put into retirement and can thereby engender an 
inscrutable situation leading to anguish. This fundamental 
impulse provides a range of tendencies and specific impulses – 
according to the profile of the system – that will dynamically 
incite components of the production of the different types of idea 
emergences. 
There is no death impulse in the psychic system, which Freud 
proposed in his model. We assert that the psychic system is a system 
that never stops constructing representations via the fundamental drive 
of the regulator representing the life impulse, but that this regulator 
can be rendered ineffective. It can, under conditions in the psychic 
system in which there is a very strong contradiction between the 
regulators, find itself unable to spatially arrange the regulators so that 
aims and clear representations are formed. In this case, the regulators’ 
geometric layer will no longer be established normally in the systemic 
layer, there will no longer be an inclination to generate a clearly 
qualified representation, and the system will exist in a state of 
expectancy and unsustainable emptiness. This is the feeling of 
anguish, when aims no longer function correctly, when the regulators 
are contradictory because they are not organized and when each 
representation that forms is chaotic and compels questioning with no 
response. 
Dysfunctions of the regulators will have major consequences on 
the quality of emergences produced in the conscious, that is to say, on 
the qualities and the coherence of the surges of thoughts leading to 
behaviors. These dysfunctions will have four primary causes: 

34     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
1) dysfunction arises from weakness in one or more regulators that 
can no longer operate normally in the morphological space of the 
regulators and that cannot satisfy their goals or coactivate in a 
satisfying manner; 
2) dysfunction arises from hyperactivity in one or more regulators, 
which inhibits the action of all of the others; 
3) dysfunction arises from informational anomalies in the 
morphological space of the regulators, which therefore cannot 
coactivate normally. The flow of information in the psychic system at 
the neuronal level undergoes anomalies, limitations and local 
weaknesses; 
4) dysfunction arises from the absence of regulators that are 
necessary for the social and cooperative activity of the psychic 
system. This does not take into account certain cultural, social or 
emotional requirements that are indispensable for obtaining 
reasonable idea emergences. 
Based on the duration of their effect, dysfunctions can also be 
sorted into three categories: 
1) they are temporary, in that they occur in very specific 
circumstances of implementation in the environment, they do not last 
long and they are not permanent; 
2) they are caused by specific kinds of situations having precise 
characteristics. They are durable and alter the quality of idea 
production for a long period of time, expressing themselves in several 
themes; 
3) they are permanent, in that they are set off by the characteristics 
of situations that are very different from the current situation and are 
always active, and they reflect a profoundly degraded state of the 
psychic system. The system no longer functions coherently, stably or 
rationally, and it is globally defective.  
Neurons combine to form many elementary dynamic sets for 
meaning, which are the neuronal aggregates. We have asserted that 
each of these aggregates stands in for a specific component of 
meaning, whose energy will be more or less important depending on 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     35 
the importance of its meaningful characteristics in the emergence that 
is being constructed, and the aggregate will combine with others to 
bring out its  characteristics, which is understood. The organized set of  
active aggregates will express itself as the source of felt sensations 
and of all the forms of generated thoughts. Each aggregate, which 
should be considered as a fundamental unit of meaning, cannot 
represent a thought; it is only a constituent component that must 
combine itself with many others. Each thought will therefore be 
formed by a well-organized set of dynamic aggregates forming 
complex conformations that will be significant for the sense, the 
characteristics and the intensity of the experienced thought. In saying 
this, we assert that each thought has a source that is a 
multi-characteristic physical form and that is understood in its 
significant complexity by drawing out a meaning, which is by nature 
multiform. 
1.6. The mental landscape 
We will assert that, in humans, there exist multiple specific 
conformations that allow them to generate mental representations and 
that clarify their types and their characteristics in different behavioral 
situations. There is no absolute psychic domain in which a person 
generates the thoughts they want to, but there are voluntary or 
involuntary circumstances that will produce psychic domains where 
thoughts with certain types of characteristics will be generated more 
readily than others. We will refer to such a psychic domain, made up 
of organizations of active neuronal aggregates in coactivity under the 
influence of a network of particular regulators, as a mental 
landscape. The mental landscape is the environment defined by all of 
the system’s instances and is generated by the systemic layer. The idea 
of a mental landscape is absolutely central and has not been developed 
until now. It is this idea that repeatedly places the human in a specific 
frame of mind, depending on their circumstances, mood and 
condition, and which allows them to think in accordance with the 
context, by concerning themself with a situation, an action to be taken 
or a judgment to be made about an understood thing. It is the 
placement into certain mental landscapes that allows the human to 
socialize themself and to think coherently at each moment of their life  

36     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
in countless social frameworks. The human being therefore has 
different domains of freedom of thought that they deploy at certain 
times, under certain conditions, and in which they think about certain 
things with certain characteristics. 
The mental landscape 
The mental landscape is the specific dynamic conformation 
formed by all five instances where layers of neuronal aggregates 
are active and where active regulators ensure control through 
coordination. This is what the systemic layer produces by 
deploying its consolidation through all instances to produce 
mental representations according to specific themes that are 
emblematic of the conformations of mental landscapes, so that 
they can be experienced by the conscious. 
There are many mental landscapes enabling the development of all 
of the kinds of mental representations, but we can define two general 
categories with differences. When a person relaxes and does not 
request any specific focus, the mental landscape is made up of what is 
comprehended by their senses, by what is seen and heard and will 
therefore be perceived very straightforwardly in a continuous fashion. 
This is the natural, neutral, straightforward mental landscape. But all 
activity of focus on a theme or on something noticed thereby deploys 
specific conformations in the current mental landscape which are 
made up of a dynamic set of specific regulators defining the affective 
and cognitive domains deployed by the characteristics provided by the 
focus. And here, we have the second category of mental landscapes, 
those provoked by a focus initiated by the conscious. It is in these 
mental landscapes that the appropriate sequence of representations to 
be experienced will be deployed. The mental landscape is a 
constructive deployment that extends to all instances in the psychic 
system – the preconscious, the unconscious, organizational memory, 
the conscious – and, with the action of the systemic layer, it is the 
dynamic system that unifies these instances via the systemic layer and 
that brings out the particular possibilities of generating emergences 
constituting produced and perceived thoughts. The problem is now 
therefore the generation of a particular mental landscape. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     37 
Generation of a mental landscape 
According to a person’s general condition, their behavioral 
context and their current engagements, specific organizational 
regulators coming from the systemic layer and the conscious – 
which we will call situational regulators – will generate the 
specific mental landscape that will unify the psychic system’s 
instances and will coordinate with the active organizational 
regulators. We can therefore say that, according to the person’s 
level of self-mastery and their current preoccupations, the 
mental landscape will be defined by situational regulators 
enabling self-mastery with intentional production of aims and 
representations with adaptability, or by situational regulators 
generating a habitual mental landscape that will generate 
representations with very common characteristics but without 
any real intentional aim. 
The usual mental landscape – when the individual is not focused 
on any thought and is completely neutral – clarifies what the senses 
grasp, that is to say, what is weakly recognized in the environment by 
sight, hearing and smell. When there is an intention to think about 
something, a mental landscape is immediately constructed, and is a 
specific organization of the instances – a regulatory layer that enables 
the active emission of controllers inciting the generation of 
meaningful forms to produce representations that are in the specific 
domains activated by the regulatory layer constituting the mental 
landscape. There are therefore two general levels of thought 
production: the level of neutral thoughts, vague and straightforwardly 
tangible, and the level of intentional, wanted thoughts. 
A human being is therefore engaged, according to their education, 
activities and way of life in society, in the generation of several kinds 
and categories of mental landscapes that end up defining their 
psychological type. This clearly asserts that the human psychic system 
develops several kinds of mental conformations defined by education, 
training, economic and social practices, and all of the normative 
practices imposed by society, and there is no psychological infinity 
that allows for the potential generation of any desired mental 
representation to occur at any moment. According to time and place,  

38     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
a human is psychologically urged by their active mental landscape to 
generate the kinds of thoughts that come from their own psychological 
and social history. A human’s psychological freedom is therefore 
relative; it is anchored in their past and practices, and it can be 
characterized. In order to form very reasonable and clearly defined 
mental landscapes and to avoid the generation of somber mental 
landscapes leading to negative results, one must learn how to 
thoroughly master one’s psychological state. This means that all 
understanding of a person’s psychic system must come from the 
categorization of their principal mental landscapes, the landscapes’ 
regulations and the situational regulators generating the landscapes’ 
production, and not from an extensive bottom-up analysis beginning 
with the molecular components that form the neuronal cells, which 
conform to the energetic aggregates which we observe, and in which 
we seek meaning and relationships between parts. It is therefore 
necessary, in order to understand the significance of the active 
neuronal conformations, to take a dual approach that will be both 
bottom-up and top-down, which is typically a multidisciplinary 
practice.  
We can also characterize mental landscapes according to their 
scopes, and therefore the extent of the representations that they can 
generate. 
The different scopes of mental landscapes 
There are different scopes for mental landscapes, from the 
limiting layer, where the regulators only enable the generation of 
thoughts belonging to a precise and very limited domain, to a 
completely adaptable layer that makes numerous characteristics 
explicit, and where all questions are possible, especially 
questions full of symbolic characteristics. Between these two 
extreme cases, there exist system-setting layers allowing for 
passage from one specific domain to another with regularity, 
which is the usual operation of a stable psychic system. 
A mental landscape is therefore a general conformation unifying 
the psychic system’s instances in a constructible fashion, and which 
includes particular commitments concerning tangible and cognitive 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     39 
information to allow for the deployment and generation of thought at 
that moment. We can say that it is the domain of all generated 
thought, and that this thought depends, in its form and its 
characteristics, on the contents of this domain as an active control. We 
should clarify that if there are very specific mental landscapes 
generating precise conformations, there are also mental landscapes 
allowing for the generation of multiple types of representations that 
have multiple domains, enabling adaptability toward types of 
representations that specify the dominant characteristic of all 
generated thought. In all cases, the notion of a specific domain in a 
mental landscape is the activity of types of characteristics represented 
by regulators, the domains being linked by connectivity and not 
independent: the activation of a domain always depends on the 
activity of certain others. There are many classes of categorizations of 
mental landscapes in the human psyche, allowing for the 
characterization and definition of all types of produced thoughts. 
These classes of landscapes will represent all of the kinds of possible 
thoughts, as with the many kinds of language activities that 
characterize the kinds of utterances, comprehension, attention toward 
speakers, in accordance with the multiple kinds of feelings and 
reasonings, different possible questions in different contextual 
situations, the observation of nature, interest in categories of 
components, the focus on a working domain, the different feelings, 
etc. There will be banal, habitual understandings produced by 
frequently used mental landscapes in specific contexts and there will 
be the generation of creations in the context of open mental 
landscapes that are able to refer to themselves.  
We can therefore say that the freedom to think about something 
depends on the system’s general condition and its current state of 
activity, which can produce particular mental landscapes, by relying 
heavily on organizational memory, which has been shaped continually 
through life from birth onwards. The freedom to think engages the 
activity of the regulator of the will that drives the production of 
intentional aims. 
A mental landscape is an organized set of components of the 
neuronal substrate in space–time using the strength of the regulatory 

40     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
networks operating on neuronal aggregates. This mental landscape 
allows for the definition of focuses on particular characteristics in the 
conformation of the representations, by placing certain components 
from its domain into a hegemonic position and others into a 
subordinate position, constituting the active operation for the 
experiencing conscious. Mental landscapes use short-term memory, 
which contains traces of dominant forms of understandings and which 
will serve as a local foundation for the subsequent configurations. 
During the generation of a representation, some forms appear in 
the mental landscape that are more salient than others; the associations 
of high-volume and high-intensity informational forms dominate 
through inhibition over forms that would be subordinate and that 
would not express their characteristics in the emergent representation. 
Emergence is what is constructed as a force in the landscape and is 
comprehended and perceived by the conscious. The landscape is a 
dynamic construct able to cultivate the continuous pursuit of themes 
through the control of the perceptual regulator, which is the regulator 
that tends to find a focus by proposing it as an aim for the future 
emergent generation. The great power of the conscious will therefore 
be to present a series of pertinent aims in rich and adaptable mental 
landscapes. The aim is defined by a meta-regulator that provides the 
system with a way of acting on a focused theme. The selection of 
these aims can be of the same kind for a certain period of time, during 
which a mental landscape remains in a permanent state, allowing for 
the continuity of generated thoughts. 
Depending on the representation to be produced, local forms 
activate in the current mental landscape to constitute groups of forms 
having dominance over others by strongly communicating with certain 
forms to supplant those that will become recessive through the 
encouragement of active local regulators. The set of all of these 
dynamic forms in communication with each other will express the 
dominant characteristics that lead to the expressed thought, generating 
an emergence that will be comprehended. The regulators in the mental 
landscape therefore explicitly act on the forms that they constitute, 
releasing organizations of aggregates and perceiving the effects, 
explicitly and systematically, of their meanings. Thus, for example, 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     41 
listening to someone talk requires putting oneself into the mental 
landscape of listening in order to interpret audible information, 
including its tone and timbre, to construct the continuous sequence of 
mental representations representing the word sentences and complete 
sentences 
– 
with 
their 
objective 
and 
subjective 
semantic 
inter-pretations – through organizations of aggregates that change in 
the morphology of the landscape according to the interpretations of 
meaning based on the words that are heard. We can say that every 
mental landscape of the language type is a class that has many 
subclasses depending on the context between the speaker and the 
listener and on the type of discourse that is heard and understood. 
The important point is therefore that there are two steps in the 
creation of every representation: 
1) there is the action of situational regulators conforming to a 
mental landscape, and there is always an active mental landscape 
during a period of activity; 
2) there is the action of specific regulators for generating the aim 
and producing the representation in this mental landscape, which are 
the construction regulators.  
The main types of characteristics of mental landscapes defined by 
active domains that are more or less important are as follows: 
1) tangible 
understanding 
of 
characteristics 
denoting 
an 
understanding coming directly from the senses and producing an 
emotion; 
2) common understandings in the current context that do not cause 
surprises or preoccupations;  
3) syntactic and linguistic characteristics attributed to an indicated 
object through an understanding of auditory or visual perceptions; 
4) denotative characteristics of a thing in the world indicated by a 
voluntary, tangible understanding or by inciting that memory in the 
context of reflecting on a theme; 
 

42     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
5) characteristics of adaptability and questioning about something 
understood to be important at that time; 
6) characteristics of closure about dominant motivations using 
memory and internal language;  
7) characteristics given by the continuous action of tensions and 
the psychic climate of the moment that qualify the current landscape. 
There are obviously a large number of kinds of mental landscapes 
and their characteristics have long since been specified in psychology 
(and other disciplines) in the domain of research concerning the 
determination of tendencies of thought. We can assert that, in animals, 
evolution has formed types of mental landscapes linked to different 
senses, allowing for the representation of components specifying the 
animal’s situation in the contexts in which it habitually finds itself so 
that it will behave for the best. And, through evolution, the neuronal 
system has become more complex in some animals by achieving an 
organization of and for itself, by organizing general classes of 
abstractions of the classes of available tangible mental landscapes. 
This has led to the creation of new classes of landscapes that are very 
important in humans, which will be complementary to primarily 
tangible aspects. There has therefore been a deployment of this new 
type of mental landscape to memorize and manipulate abstract forms 
in the available mental landscapes that are simply tangible, with the 
creation of domains of definition and usage of abstract symbolic forms 
in the form of aggregates of naming and manipulation of these internal 
abstract characteristics. Thus, abstract domains and domains of 
linguistic generation have been created, with classes of mental 
landscapes of a specifically linguistic type in humans, in whom this 
aspect of mental landscapes has become primary in the psyche, 
ensuring its social and cultural expansion. 
The idea of a mental landscape leads to thoughts about territory 
and about the domains that humans travel through and analyze during 
their lives. But humans must move voluntarily into domains that are 
new to them in order to explore them and to become involved in them. 
And it is not certain that this is a common occurrence in the life of 
today’s humans. Following P. Sloterdijk, we can be led to think that 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     43 
our existence is primarily made up of repetitions, most of which are of 
a purely mechanical nature [SLO 11]. This would involve a more 
limited characterization of the mental landscapes that are therefore 
constraining, in which the characteristics of the representations that 
are generated simply refer to common cases that thereby repeat 
endlessly. 
In fact, all mental landscapes are generated by situational 
regulators that provide the impulse to activate specific components in 
the available dynamic layer. There are many of these regulators, 
which form a dynamic set in the systemic layer and which select 
situational regulators that become dominant and activate the domains 
of the instances in the psychic system – including organizational 
memory – to produce the dominant climate that will correspond to 
generated thoughts. In the case where the conscious is clearly oriented 
toward the expression of its will, it can impose the type of situational 
regulator; if not, the mental landscape will be of the current, usual 
kind, with characteristics that have permanence. 
The mental landscape that generates hegemonic situational 
regulators is a dynamic conformation, and we can regard it as having 
seven general dimensions, three in space, one in time, one for energy, 
one for informational intensity and one for meaning, where each 
aggregate has a form and energy, and which dominates or is 
subordinate depending on certain connected forms. This set represents 
the multiple characteristics of every produced thought: subjective and 
emotional characteristics, cognitive characteristics, general bodily 
impression, an  image of the surrounding world and of its context, 
linguistic aspects, specific aspects on the theme of the generated 
thought, etc. 
And the term landscape is not insignificant. The relationship we 
can assert between the idea of the earthly landscape and the mental 
landscape characterizes a relationship of organizational correspondence 
between all of the things that are organized in our world, even if the 
spatial and temporal scales are very different. Thus, the comprehended 
observation of a natural landscape amounts to placing oneself in an 
observational frame and constructing multiple neuronal aggregates 
representing the characteristics of the forms and organizations of this 

44     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
real landscape, specifying that certain components are focused on their 
aspects, their contexts, their proximities and their distances from other 
understood things, and also their brief linguistic designations. 
There are many categories of mental landscapes in the human 
psyche that are constituted through the use of the senses, common 
social practice and the accumulation of the events of social and 
professional life. This determines the classification of psychic types, 
which can be initially defined through types of observed mental 
conformations and further defined using imaging in neuroscience. 
There are general mental landscapes establishing personality types, 
there are local landscapes like those characteristic of pleasure or 
distress, of all the emotions, reasonings, fear or attraction, etc. There is 
clearly a strong distinction between the mental landscapes of children 
and those of adults, since landscapes are made up of forms and 
different conformations. We should note that the psyche allows for the 
creation of new abstract landscapes based on a landscape whose 
structure has been memorized, thereby demonstrating its adaptable 
context. 
Mental landscapes are activated by situational regulators. Some of 
these regulators express the temporary will of the conscious and the 
need to activate a certain type of landscape when beginning to think 
about specific things. Other situational regulators will be activated 
autonomously in order to activate and deepen the characteristics of the 
current mental landscape. There are also autonomous situational 
regulators that function by understanding information coming directly 
from the organism’s senses that deploy tangible types of landscapes. 
We should also note that many mental problems are created by the 
continuous presence of mental landscapes generated by strongly 
autonomous situational regulators, which do not refer to the 
individual’s real situation, and which thereby systematically provide 
contexts that encourage the production of specific abnormal 
representations. There are even situational regulators that generate 
obsessive mental landscapes that only allow for very specific kinds of 
mental representations. We should clearly state that the psyche’s 
pathological characteristics are not simply determined by what a 
patient says, but by the mental context in which those things are said, 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     45 
and that these contexts are mental landscapes. Marchais and I have 
previously published on this topic [MAR 10]. 
We should also state that future autonomous systems equipped 
with artificial consciousness will be able to communicate forms of 
thought between themselves by using continuous WiFi transmissions, 
thereby achieving the computing equivalent of telepathy. We will see 
this in Chapter 2. 
Every human psychic system is therefore a set of regulators that 
controls a layer of components simply carrying the memory of the 
individual’s life; this memory is organizational and cannot be reduced 
to accessible, passive components. Its operation amounts to the 
activation of meta-regulators that encourage the situational regulators 
to create an active mental landscape, which then cause the intentional 
regulators to activate, in order to generate the theme of the 
representation that will be constructed by the local regulators in the 
layer. Then, the proposed representation will be analyzed and 
understood by the regulators in the conscious, which we will see. 
1.7. The feeling of thinking and the general organizational 
principle 
The human being perceives thoughts, experiences them and can 
only use them to form coherent sequences of thoughts that are 
subsequently memorized in a synthetic manner. How does this feeling 
of thinking come about? 
Every perceived thought will structurally – at the physical level– 
be made up of multiple active aggregates that will be organized to 
constitute a specific dynamic form in the mental landscape and in 
which certain aggregates will be more intense than others, that is, they 
will be dominant over subordinate aggregates. We should assert that 
every felt thought exists on the material level; this is the generating 
and exploratory activity of a form organized from active aggregates 
expressing characteristics. This is a conceptual approach to thought 
that is presented as the generation and manipulation of highly dynamic 
forms, the emergences of which are produced by co-active processes, 

46     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
such that the feeling of thinking occurs through the manipulation of 
forms emerging with manipulating regulators that produce the feeling 
of understanding a thing, a feeling or an idea. We can therefore assert 
that the brain is essentially a very efficient system for generating 
specific feelings that are able to express multiple sensitive and 
cognitive understandings by representing countless conceptual forms – 
including linguistic forms – through its ability to generate and 
comprehend forms made up of dynamic aggregates that use energy 
and information. Thinking is perceiving an emergence in the mental 
landscape; it is a feeling that is continuous from awakening, whether 
the emergences are voluntary or simply presented by the senses. 
So, what are the characteristics of these aggregate forms that 
express the characteristics of expressed and perceived thoughts, and 
how and why can these meaningful organizations be generated? The 
problem lies in finding the link between forms made up of active 
neuronal aggregates and sensory understanding of the whole of these 
forms experiencing the characteristics of what is defined by these 
forms. We have here a question that must be asked and answered in a 
constructivist approach, which amounts to elucidating the following 
points: 
1) consider active aggregates with energy and information by 
clarifying why and how they are active;  
2) consider coactive energetic and informational relationships 
between these aggregates, clarifying why they are coactive, and what 
the scales are; 
3) consider how the set of aggregates makes up a specific 
organization in which specific components influence others to form a 
large temporary structure; 
4) consider how and why this organization is understood and how 
it is perceived as being a conscious form; 
5) consider how the subsequent thought – which will contain the 
phases of construction of the components – is constituted, with 
aggregates that are both similar and different forming a new 
aggregate. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     47 
A thought is based on a construct that is a sequence of generated 
representations in the current mental landscape; this involves 
analyzing the aggregates, an activity which is not neutral on the 
energetic and informational level. Each representation is generated 
during an extremely short time, and the sequence of representations 
that will create the feeling is equally short, especially with regard to 
actions in the body. It is this activity that will lead to the feeling of 
thinking about something, and we will elaborate on the reason. 
Achieving the feeling of thinking about a thing 
The fact of being conscious of something, that is, the feeling of 
thinking about something, is the process of a cognitive and 
tangible evaluation of a sequence of representations that are 
aimed or not aimed in the mental landscape, and that can be 
analyzed by specific regulators that evaluate the characteristics 
of their forms by modifying them, completing them and partially 
reconstructing them with sensitivity. A feeling does not arise 
during the construction of the first characteristics of the 
sequence of representations, but is produced on the available 
construct when it is formed with a coherence that renders it 
relatively stable for a moment when it is no longer producing 
important aggregative reconstructions. The effective action on 
the material components – that is, the sequence of 
representations formed and available for its analysis and 
synthetic reconfiguration – will be produced in a major, 
hegemonic state in the entire system, which means that this 
analytical action allows for memorization so that the process of 
generating representations will be pursued endlessly through 
specialization or generalization or even a change in theme. It is 
therefore an analytical state of synthetic memorization that 
allows for the continuous pursuit of representations. This 
action is permitted by the specific regulators in the conscious, 
which are the only ones that are active at that time in the 
conscious. The mental landscape is fixed, and the form of the 
representation is manipulated by these regulators in the 
conscious. This action constitutes the local feeling of thinking 
about representations, because it focuses all of the psychic 
system’s operation on the action of analysis in order to 

48     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
memorize the representations and to imperatively proceed with 
the coherent pursuit of the process of generation at a rapid pace. 
The process of constructing representations is in a suspended 
state for a very short time with regard to the form under analysis 
so that it can be used to define a new aim that will relaunch 
continuous production in the psychic system. 
The fact of thinking about a thing is therefore a process that 
operates for a very short time on the conformation of the 
representation proposed to the conscious, which achieves its analysis 
through the regulators of the conscious – which we will call 
regulators of the feeling of thinking – in order to evaluate the 
characteristics with sensitivity, to complete them and then to produce 
a synthetic form that will be stored in short-term memory. This is a 
delicate and partial development of the available physical structure 
that will be perceived as such. These regulators take control of the 
system for a short time and are the only active regulators in the 
conscious and the systemic layer that produce an understanding of the 
characteristics of the representation. This action modifies the energy 
and the informational contents of these regulators during the very 
short cessation phase of the construction of representations, and the 
analysis that allows for the production of the forms of the synthesis of 
the representation will be perceived as sensations linked to their 
characteristics. The end of the process of understanding initiates the 
immediate production of the subsequent representation, with an aim or 
without an aim in basic mode. 
The experience of perceiving one’s thoughts therefore arises from 
the action of specific regulators in the conscious that will undertake a 
tangible evaluation by appreciating the morphologico-semantic 
characteristics of the representation’s conformations with a specific 
sensation. They undertake the synthetic rewriting of the representation 
and store it in short-term memory, while the system for constructing 
representations is now available as it has completed its task. It is an 
extremely brief halting state of the operating process in the system for 
producing the sequence of representations in the mental landscape.  
It is possible to experience thoughts continuously while the theme 
remains the same by producing sequences of generations of 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     49 
representations that are all very similar, without any change in aim 
and without an event occurring, which changes the theme of the 
observation, such as in the continuous observation of a landscape or a 
sporting event. In this case, representations are generated, followed by 
a brief sensation of the simple representation, not stored in memory, 
and then the continuous and imperative pursuit of the production of 
simple representations on the same theme. It is therefore a continuous 
fixation on a theme without in-depth investigation, without any 
changes, and with no deep thoughts. 
And there is also the state of the psychic system that understands 
what the senses provide, that is, what is seen and heard in a 
continuous fashion when the system is awake. In this case, the psychic 
system does not produce intentional representations with aims, but 
understands the automatically produced representation in its mental 
landscape. 
Understanding without intentional aim 
There is a situation where the psychic system does not produce 
any intentional aims, even very weak ones, and where it 
understands and simply perceives what the senses provide, that 
is, what is seen and heard continuously by producing continuous 
representations. In this case, the psychic system simply 
understands the automatically generated representation in the 
mental landscape that is shaped by the senses by permitting the 
regulators of the feeling of thinking to simply understand this 
automatic construct without voluntary modification. This is a 
locally weak understanding when it is perceived, without 
memorization, but whose continuous pursuit leads to thought 
about a general, meaningful understanding. All abnormal facts in 
this continuous understanding trigger a specifically questioning 
aim of understanding and also trigger the generation of a deeper 
representation that is perceived, which puts an end to the 
automatic process. 
We can therefore say that the usual and ordinary state of the human 
being is to understand what the senses provide, and that they are 
bound to intentionally undertake the generation of personal thoughts. 

50     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The human being has a system that they can use voluntarily to 
produce thoughts, questions and reasonings by simply detaching from 
the tangible understanding that unfolds continuously in their mental 
landscape. We can therefore say that the emotional instance has 
autonomous regulators that simply generate tangible representations 
when the regulators in the conscious and the systemic layer have not 
taken control to intentionally impose an aim. Thus, the system of 
regulators is clearly organizational and the regulators drive intentions 
and aims, which then drive the development of the representation as 
per the aim, though only acting if the regulator of the will activates the 
intentional process of producing a representation. Then, the regulators 
of the feeling of thinking will activate and become hegemonic – when 
the situation allows it – through the inaction of the regulators for 
constructing representations. This entire process amounts to allowing 
the production of organizations of regulators to operate in the correct 
order, which otherwise engender dysfunctions or pathologies. 
The act of intentional thought is therefore a constructive analysis of 
the representation situated in the conscious that is brought about  
by the aim. It is experienced in a tangible manner as a setting for  
the cognitive characteristics of its morphological and cognitive 
conformation while it is available, for a very short period of time, 
before the process for generating representations picks up again to 
develop another. An analysis of the conformations takes place: of their 
semantic characteristics, their reciprocal strengths and their 
connections, and the meaning provided by these analyses is 
surrounded with tangible and emotional characteristics, given the 
emotional sense of the energetic and informational strength of certain 
forms in relation to others. Every representation – even very abstract 
ones such as scientific reasonings – is an understanding that will be 
primarily cognitive, but also somewhat tangible, concerning the 
morphological characteristics of this representation. We experience 
with a certain degree of attention, a certain intensity, a certain pleasure 
or displeasure, or with a feeling that something is either important or 
negligible. We can therefore say that the human is and will always be 
a fundamentally sensory being in their behaviors and also in the fact 
that they think. Thinking is a sensory perception of one’s thoughts. 
Based on what is experienced as a conscious event, there will be 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     51 
continuity of aims in the same theme and the same mental landscape, 
or there will be a potentially radical change. The fact of thinking is a 
continuous action of mental perceptions of forms generated by 
internal sensations, an action which is intentionally modified 
according to the characteristics of each sensation. The process is 
continuous at different paces and is tangible because it is experienced.  
The action of the continuous production of the sensation of thought 
is as follows. 
The continuous sensation of thought in the psychic system 
The sensation of thinking is a process of understanding the 
characteristics of a completed, analyzed and evaluated 
representation, with its reconstruction leading to its synthetic 
memorization and its storage in short-term memory, followed by 
the initiation of the production of the subsequent representation. 
We cannot stop producing representations while we are awake; 
the necessity is imperative, but the intention to produce them 
about specific aims exists, as does the sensation of focusing on 
things without any express intention. The duration of the 
production of a representation is very short, and there is also a 
period for understanding its expression and its characteristics 
while the construction process is stopped in the mental 
landscape, with the imperative inclination to initiate the pursuit 
of new productions with a potential change in theme. This 
sequence of produced representations can be unintentional and 
can generate a continuous sequence of perceived understandings 
on a single theme, without memorization and without precise 
interrogations of the representations, which is the case when the 
intention to think is very weak. But the sequence can be  
non-uniform, with the expression of the regulator of the will on a 
representation leading to a strong investment in a theme in the 
precise mental landscape and the production of corresponding 
representations, and, subsequently, the feeling will focus on 
what has been produced, before changing. 
The process of perceiving a produced representation with an 
intentional aim is as follows: 

52     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
1) process of generating the representation with the action of the 
regulators in all the instances; 
2) definition of the local components of the representation and of 
the order that will be given to the set of these components: main form, 
secondary form, classification and the surrounding of certain cognitive 
forms with emotional forms; 
3) cessation of the production process in the mental landscape 
and perception of the representation: analysis of the important 
parts, subsequent complements given and unification by the regulators 
of the feeling of thinking, a strong action of these regulators and a 
feeling brought about by their conditions and their characteristics of 
that which is apprehended; 
4) construction of the synthetic form and cessation of this 
construction, which is the end of the sensation of thinking about the 
representation. Additionally, its storage in short-term memory and use 
of this constructed form for subsequent generations of representations; 
5) action of the regulators of the conscious and the aim: imperative 
inclination to continue the construction process, either through pursuit 
of the intended theme in order to understand the thing more deeply 
depending on the intensity of the sensation, in order to differentiate it 
more thoroughly, or an intentional passage to another theme through 
rupture; 
6) resumption of the constructive running and explicit 
generation of the new aim, followed by initiation of the construction 
of the subsequent representation in accordance with this aim. 
The construction of the representation is a process of aggregation 
that rapidly attains a form with a degree of stability, which is 
analyzed, completed and overcome in order to be replaced and stored 
in short-term memory. This act of construction, analysis and 
reconstruction of a synthetic form leads to the perception of thought 
through the placement of regulators into a hegemonic position over a 
stopped construction process in the mental landscape, which is the 
action of experiencing that occurs. The fact of constantly perceiving 
these representations inside oneself that are made and unmade through 
this act of perception is isolating and produces the feeling of self, but 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     53 
also introduces a very important receptivity to the sense of time 
passing through consideration of the different time periods of thought 
events that are completed and the temporal classification of these 
events [KAN 96]. 
The memorization of the synthetic form of the representation 
occurs through an exploration of the mental landscape by the 
regulators of the feeling of thinking and a detailed analysis of the form 
of the emergence of the representation, through an appreciation of the 
importance of certain aggregates as well as continuities and 
discontinuities in the aggregated forms that lead to modifications to 
connections. This occurs primarily through an informational process 
caused by specific regulators, a process that travels through the 
aggregates, evaluating them and modifying their connections. This 
altering process is tangible and produces the physical sensation of 
thinking by selecting and then altering the characteristics of the 
aggregates by surrounding them with tangible characteristics. We 
must therefore consider that the associated neuronal connections that 
form the relationships between aggregates carry not only the energy 
they need to form, but also the information they need to endow 
themselves with meaning and tangible value. This information has a 
chemical, electrical and electromagnetic basis, and can become 
morphological in highly energetic and magnetic groups in the mental 
landscape by having more intense sites than others. 
The description of this process explains the act of thinking, where 
it comes from, what it produces as sensations and as a feeling of the 
self. We have asserted that the system always generates a mental 
landscape and experiences the meaning of the representation 
generated in this landscape by producing a synthetic memorization of 
the representation. We can now assert that there is a principle that 
living beings drive all of the neuronal systems to produce the feeling 
of thinking for organisms that accommodate these systems in their 
brains. We can assert that experiencing thinking is not a marvelous 
aptitude that comes from elsewhere and that human brains possess, 
but that it is the expression of the fundamental inclination that all 
living organizational systems have the desire to preserve themselves 
in space and time, to memorize the structures of what they are made 

54     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
of, to store in memory the synthesis of the form of what has been 
constructed and has moved into the past and to use it in new forms to 
be generated in the future. This is the fundamental principle of 
continuity and conservation of everything that is organized on our 
planet, all of life. We will therefore successively state two principles, 
the first clarifying why the psychic system produces synthetic forms 
of its representations and why they are experienced, and the second 
stating that there is a universal organizational principle that makes a 
living being. 
Fundamental principle 1 – the memorization of representations 
The tangible understanding of a representation in the mental 
landscape, which is the feeling of thinking about something, 
occurs because the mental landscape tends, by its nature, to 
make itself memorize these representative emergences, to store 
the generated representation in the system’s organizational 
memory in order to anchor it there in a certain form, thereby 
making the representation generating system a system that tends 
to maintain its organizational possibilities and the permanence of 
its activities. Therefore, there are regulators of the feeling of 
thinking that analyze the representation in order to summarize it 
and then to memorize it, and thought is experienced as a result 
of these actions. 
 
Fundamental principle 2 – the general organizational principle 
     of living beings 
We assert that there is a general organizational principle in 
living beings that tends to organize material to constitute 
components and organisms. This inclination exists permanently 
in space and time and tends to memorize the forms that have 
emerged in a structured fashion by conserving these produced 
forms, as much as possible, in order to allow for more to be 
organized, both similar and new ones, that are based on them. 
This inclination is certainly motivational and is absolutely not 
imperative. It is the principle of existence and the continuous 
evolution of living beings that tends to be deployed in local 
space–time on Earth. This inclination applies in the case of  

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     55 
neurons to available forms in the mental landscapes, landscapes 
that are strongly organized and complex, which for this purpose 
use space, time and the coactivity of the components of which 
they are made, thus reifying a continuous need for emergences 
of representations in a dynamic organizational space. 
This principle is effectively produced by the uniformly dense 
organizational tendency in a space–time where we share the same 
world line [LAC 13]. It establishes a clear link between the organized 
living being that shapes the variety of life, which is a complex but 
organized deployment, and what happens in the brain, which is, at a 
completely different temporal and spatial scale, a generation of 
organizations using memorized forms to endlessly create new ones. 
Therefore, the neuronal system has the capacity to memorize what 
it produces as experienced representations, which has the effect of 
giving to the body that houses this system the ability to represent what 
it has lived through and therefore the ability to operate continuously 
and rationally in all of its acts. We must abandon the idea of an 
understanding of the ability of thought that will be primary, superior 
and coming from a supernatural source in the thinking man. Things 
are organized, and the human being is an organizational component of 
the evolving, living being that actualizes their own evolution and 
innovates, using the memorizations they have created. 
1.8. The aim and the space of the regulators  
One of the most common ways that the psychic system initiates the 
generation of a mental representation is the production of an aim, 
which is the intentional expression of wanting to think about 
something and generating the sequence of representations.  
The aim of a mental representation 
The determination of an aim in order to initiate the production of 
a mental representation with intention is the specification of an 
instruction concerning a theme in the frame of an active mental 
landscape. This will be created by an intentional regulator. There 
are two cases. In the first case, in which the mental landscape is 

56     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
closed and the aim conforms to the type of landscape, we have a 
local aim. In the second case, the mental landscape is open so 
that the intentional regulator can introduce a thematic instruction 
by soliciting regulators through strong coactivity; this thematic 
instruction may solicit the activation of another mental 
landscape, which will be done by the active regulators. This is 
the case of an amplified aim. The generation of this aim is 
voluntary in a landscape that is open to the organizational 
memory and it may activate another mental landscape; it is a 
question of the explicit exercise of the intention of thinking 
strongly about a specific thing, which is therefore a meta control 
that we can refer to as the mental will. We have already seen 
that a specific meta-regulator exists in the conscious for 
producing this exercise of will – the organizational regulator of 
will. 
We will therefore define two kinds of aims, which will determine 
the amplitude and the quality of representations: 
1) local aims come from very local foci in a defined mental 
landscape, primarily about what the bodily senses provide. This type 
of aim is common when the person is not focused intentionally on 
something very precise, instead when they are simply comprehending 
normal things in their environment or body, and remaining in this 
calm 
mental 
landscape, 
providing 
the 
domain 
of 
natural 
considerations at that time. We can assert that mental landscapes 
where local aims are produced are limited to the activity of a few 
sensory regulators, which limits the expenditure of the organism’s 
energy;  
2) amplified aims are an intentional focus on a specific theme with 
questions and with significant use of organizational memory. It is an 
aim that uses internal space by making calls to memorized knowledge 
or to experienced events that have been memorized in a highly 
structured way. This type of aim normally leads to the production of a 
sequence of aims of the same kind, which then leads to reasoning that 
can be profound. This is the main special feature of the capacity of the 
human brain. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     57 
The intentional regulator must be in complete agreement with the 
regulator of the will in the conscious so that it can produce the action 
of initiating its theme among the other regulators of the instances. If 
not, a contradiction exists in the conscious, there is no coherent aim, 
and representations surge up from the preconscious that will be 
perceived in the conscious, even though they are incoherent. 
So, it is clearly the amplified aim that characterizes the very strong 
freedom of thought in humans, who use this kind of aim very 
frequently. We can say that evolution has enabled the considerable 
development of amplified aims in the human brain because it has the 
greatest capacity for using these specific aims, which leads to rational 
developments of sequences of thought that manipulate multiple 
abstract symbols. In living organisms, the human brain represents its 
powerful evolution through its organization, through which the 
intentional regulators developed intensely to have the ability to deploy 
sequences of representations that manipulate internal abstract 
characteristics. And we should note that each aim of this kind leads to 
the production of representations manipulating abstract characteristics, 
and that these representations will be subsequently memorized 
synthetically by creating a very powerful organization of memory. 
There is strong coherence between the action of these intentional 
regulators and the regulators deploying the components of 
representations through calls to very organized components in the 
organizational memory that contain the structures of abstract 
components memorizing lived experience. 
There are a certain number of intentional regulators, and they are 
specific to thematic categories. They exist in the conscious and are 
continuously active. They each focus on a thematic domain and, in 
accordance with the initiation of the regulator of the will, they 
coactivate themselves, and one will very quickly become dominant. 
They call strongly upon the regulators of short-term memory and 
organizational memory corresponding to their theme, then generates a 
theme that is a categorical instruction for producing the representation. 
This theme will be the instruction given to the regulators for 
constructing the representation in order to elaborate on it, by using 

58     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
organizational memory and the sensations of the emotional center 
more thoroughly. 
The exercise of voluntary control over the generation of mental 
representations will therefore be done primarily by focusing on the 
deployment of the construction of the representation on a subject and 
by opening an adequate mental landscape that may be different from  
the current landscape. This control will always be done while a mental 
landscape is activated with certain characteristics that are sometimes 
inevitable, such as those provided by the visual or auditory perceptual 
senses and the sensation of the body’s current situation. To exercise 
the definition of a new aim, the desire for control must be applied to 
the current landscape whose situational regulators must be dominated 
by the action of the regulator for conscious control. An aim can also 
be defined in the generation of a simple mental representation by 
creating a bifurcation with a certain degree of urgency. There is 
therefore a detailed organization of intentional regulators through 
which the dominant theme of the regulator expressing the current aim 
can be immediately replaced by a new aim. 
The notion of a regulator is central to this system, because it is 
what will allow for the generation and the management of the 
different relationships between the aggregates at all scales and the 
direction of an emergent form that will be the expressed thought. By 
managing the scales of relationships between components and also 
among themselves, these regulators make it possible to define precise 
kinds of representations and rational inclinations that lead to the 
production of representations. Therefore, there are ontological classes 
of regulators that represent needs, desires, the specificity of the will, 
the action of impulses, emotions, feelings, sociability, the ability for 
abstraction, speech, reasoning, judgments, the quality of memorized 
components, interrogations, classification, etc. 
The regulator and its ontological classes 
We can consider that each regulator of the system is a line of 
potentiality acting on layers of aggregates and that it belongs to 
an ontological class of regulation and to a specific category. 
  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     59 
It communicates strongly with the other regulators of its 
ontological class to form a coherent and ordered control group.  
The regulators are inevitable components characterized by the 
training and sociability of the individual. Ontologically, they 
represent the “action verbs”, that is to say, everything that is a 
real or virtual action expressed by a representation, where the 
fundamental components are the structured aspects of this action 
scene. The highly coactive set of regulators will form organized, 
dynamic spaces where they will operate on themselves to 
modify themselves. It is a type of controller in a system that is 
self-controlled, whose control is not external nor strictly 
hierarchical, but occurs in its own organization in accordance 
with its action. The regulators are lines of potentiality in the 
neuronal network; they are what brings about its organizational 
activity. 
There are three main levels of activity concerning the regulators, 
and therefore three main kinds of regulators as follows: 
– we regard structuring regulators as those that operate on the 
level of neuronal aggregates, which act on fundamental components in 
the unconscious, the preconscious and even the conscious in order to 
control the coordinated formation of aggregates of the fundamental 
components. These regulators make, modify and unmake aggregates 
and clusters of aggregates; 
– we regard situational regulators as those providing the context 
for the system’s activity, forming its current mental landscape. These 
regulators form the context of deployment for all of the 
representations;  
– we regard organizational regulators as those operating on the 
level of the morphological components of the conscious or of the 
systemic layer, and which control the structuring regulators. These are 
therefore the controllers of the regulators. We will encounter 
regulators, for example, that define inclinations, desires, aims, 
intentionality and will in the psychic system. 
We should note that the structuring regulators exercise their control 
through a more or less strong stimulus on the aggregates: they incite 

60     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
the components that they control to act in a certain direction, which is 
their ontological category. These controlled components cannot follow 
this instruction, and the regulator thereby takes this choice into 
account. There is therefore a certain degree of coactivity between the 
regulators and the controlled components, which are primarily 
aggregates. And the regulators of the three categories are also 
obviously coactive. 
The roles of the regulators 
Situational regulators define the current mental landscape, which 
will be the precise context for the deployment of the 
representations through the activation of specific regulators for 
managing the aggregates and activating the components of 
organizational memory. Structuring-type regulators exercise 
control by inciting the fundamental components and the 
structures of fundamental components in the instances in which 
they manage the activities. They produce the rational structuring 
of these components and facilitate their insertion and their 
coactivity by causing the generation of dynamic forms of 
fundamental components. They modify the tone of the 
controlled elements by adapting them to the tone that they 
should execute, by always operating at multiple scales. Another 
type of regulator, the organizational regulator, controls the 
structuring type regulators by organizing their control in 
accordance with ontological inclinations. All of the system’s 
regulators will be coactive, and they will form morphological 
spaces of action for control through orientative stimulus over the 
fundamental components that they constantly organize and 
reorganize. 
The regulators therefore occupy three major domains: the domain 
of the situational regulators, the domain of the structuring-type 
regulators and that of the organizational-type regulators. The action of 
every regulator is rational and occurs in cooperation with the other 
active regulators operating in the same domain. This action occurs  
as follows: 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     61 
– every active regulator has an effective theme defined by its 
ontological class and its specialty in that class. Depending on the 
ontological characteristics of its active theme, it produces an analysis 
of the morphological structure of the active components it controls. It 
releases the pertinent characteristics of this organization; 
– then it analyzes, via communication, the state of action and the 
influence of the other active regulators nearby, in order to clarify its 
degree of freedom of action according to its specific ontological class; 
– it tries, like each regulator in the domain, to amplify or to reduce 
the action of certain components that it controls by calling other 
components into activity and, with the help of the associated 
regulators to extend or to focus its own semantic tendency; 
– after acting, the regulator analyzes and memorizes the result of 
its action in order to train itself, which it does systematically and 
which enables it to adapt and therefore enables the psychic system to 
do the same.  
The regulators – of which there are always many active in the 
system – which would otherwise be inert, define a space of action and 
control in the psychic system. 
Morphological space of the regulators 
Regulators are the components that control the system’s activity 
at all of its levels, an activity that is founded on dynamic, 
multilevel control. These are the lines of potentiality of the 
energetic and electromagnetic network of the neuronal system. 
There are many functional regulators that directly control the 
fundamental components, and there are regulators that control 
these regulators at several levels. There is in fact – and this is the 
key point of the system – a general morphological space for the 
regulators, whose variable dynamic morphology will be specific 
to the aspects given to each of the generated representations, to 
the intention to generate them and to the way in which they are 
experienced. 
We should clarify that the notion of a morphological space for the 
regulators characterizes the very dynamic and multilevel manner of 

62     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
exercising control and producing intentionality in a system that 
operates primarily through the evaluation of communications between 
its components and on transfers of energy and information. At the 
architectural level of the system’s instances, there are two categories 
of organizational regulators depending on the instances in which they 
exercise control:  
– regulators operating on the level of the connection between the 
unconscious and the preconscious, thus producing their own activity 
outside of any conscious control. This is the kind of activity that Jung 
proposed [JUN 64]. These regulators will reify impulsive inclinations 
and memories by organizing the organizational memory and 
knowledge – including linguistic and abstract knowledge – into layers 
of landscapes, which will be made up of smaller layers of landscapes. 
They will also enable the creation of dreams; 
– regulators operating on the level of the connection between the 
conscious and the preconscious, which will be almost completely 
located in the systemic layer interfering with the conscious, and which 
will enable the creation and control of the themes of thoughts and the 
effective exercise of the system’s reason and will think about specific 
things, positioned in the temporal flow of understood ideas. 
Let us now clarify the actions of the different kinds of regulators 
depending on the instances in which they are located. 
The organizational regulators in the preconscious and the 
unconscious are specific controllers for the types and characteristics of 
the idea constructs that they will contribute in producing. Some of 
these regulators are specialized, manage organizational memory and 
extract, activate and aggregate fundamental components representing 
the memorized characteristics, according to the theme of the aim as 
well as the structures of the mental landscapes. Other regulators 
function as representatives for the impulses. They filter and modify 
the components passing from the unconscious to the preconscious 
without any control from the conscious. These regulators, which are 
numerous and highly structured, will provide the unconscious with the 
ability to act strongly in the construction of representations, in  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     63 
accordance with the components of organizational memory that are 
activated and transferred within the preconscious. They will be 
involved in the construction of a new active mental landscape in 
cooperation with the regulators in the conscious. These regulators will 
specify the deep characteristics as well as the functional, rational, 
cultural and tangible characteristics for all generations of 
representations, from the identification of objects to their activation 
and designation into plans of action, and will also specify emotions 
and sensations. 
The organizational regulators in the emotional processing 
center will be general and shared through coactivity with the 
preconscious regulators. These control components will allow the 
system to accomplish a particular tangible and subjective behavior 
according to the context, endowed with meanings and, potentially, 
depth. There are domains, hierarchies of emotional regulators and an 
emotional context in mental landscapes and in most representations, 
which will enable the production of representations having, either 
directly or deeply, subjective qualities. These emotional regulators are 
adapted to the body and the typology of the multiple emotions that can 
be perceived using the body’s senses. 
The organizational regulators in the conscious will implement 
the conscious intention and the ability to perceive representations. The 
regulator of will continuously spurs the system to function rationally 
and to organize and reorganize itself. The regulators in the conscious 
can choose the mental landscape with precision. They control the 
organizations of aggregations that are available in the preconscious by 
provoking the emergence of the representation through differentiation, 
with the ability to evaluate the pertinence and the meaning of the 
representation. Some specific regulators in the conscious will analyze 
the emergent form in order to memorize it, and will thus generate the 
feeling of thinking, introducing the sense of the self in the process of 
thinking, which will be the activity of the regulators created by the 
conscious. All of these regulators create the system’s deep psyche, its 
ability to want, and its ability to situate represented events in space 
and time. They will activate the morphologies of aggregates in the  
 

64     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
preconscious, in accordance with their specific features, by engaging 
in questioning, adaptability, abstraction, categorization and especially 
ipseity, thereby guaranteeing the permanent idea of the Ego in the 
conscious, which tends to experience representations for itself. These 
are the regulators that provide experienced thoughts with tone and 
meaning, notably by reifying the concept of the interrogation of 
understood things by engaging the system’s will to produce one or 
another sequence of clearly experienced emergences, in some situation 
or another. They will therefore shape the organization of the 
regulators hierarchically, and they will form a morphology of control. 
A specific regulator at the meta level (and therefore located in the 
systemic layer, the regulator of intentionality) will make it possible to 
define the system’s free will. In every case, these regulators will be 
able to use the preconscious regulators, more or less strongly, through 
indirect control and especially through coactivity, in an attempt to 
ensure a certain degree of control by the systemic layer. 
There will be major regulators in the conscious, regulators that will 
analyze and construct in order to make it possible to perceive the 
feeling of thinking. These are the regulators of the feeling of thinking, 
which will analyze the conformations of the representation and will 
extract from each conformation its meaning, its energetic and 
informational importance, and its connections with others, and will 
associate each characteristic thus found with a sensation of importance 
and a suitable emotional characteristic by surrounding all of its 
extractions with a tangible loop. Each of these regulators will operate 
via a broad network of dynamic graph-type actions in order to analyze 
the characteristics of the representation in parallel. They will also use 
the regulators connected to organizational memory and the emotional 
center to complete their analysis.  
We must also consider that the structuring regulators are incitatory 
controllers that simply incite the neuronal aggregates to activate, to 
communicate, to associate, to unite and to form a specific organization 
in accordance with all of their morphological and semantic 
characteristics. There will be tendencies to constitute conformations 
that are complementary to the main conformation, and there will also  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     65 
be contradictory tendencies constraining associations between the 
regulators in order to maintain a regulator in a position of dominance. 
There are even tendencies that will tend to isolate a regulator and will 
put it in conflict with the others. The system will try its best to reduce 
this via the action of the stabilizing organizational regulators located 
in the systemic layer. There are also two characteristics that 
correspond to the fundamental tendency of the self to an outward or 
inward focus, as defined in psychiatry, which will be represented by 
organizational regulators operating in a hegemonic fashion when 
possible. The set of regulators is clearly self-organized and has the 
means to produce its own organization, to make it operate in a 
unifying fashion, and to avoid all forms of chaotic rupture. 
The desires will be represented by organizational regulators of 
inclinations oriented toward acceptance or rejection concerning real 
objects apprehended by the system’s senses, or to abstract objects, 
with the apprehension of the object and the desire together 
constituting the current representation, and with a certain situation of 
strength in a mental landscape procuring these subjective 
characteristics. These desires will drive the system to pose questions 
about what it comprehends, in a continuous manner, by activating the 
regulators that represent the tendency to question. There is another 
aspect that must characterize the quality of the regulators expressing 
the drives: there are drives for representing space and time completely, 
and there are also inclinations for symbolizing and for abstracting 
perceived information in order to make internal objects in the psychic 
system and to structure the set of these objects. These inclinations will 
be represented by highly conceptual organizational regulators 
operating in the conscious and the preconscious and located in the 
systemic layer to unify the system.  
And finally there is the regulator of the will, which is always ready 
to initiate the organized activation of the inclinations and their actions, 
so that the system will continuously generate understandable 
representations. It expresses the inclination to continuously organize 
the state of the system so that it will generate representations in 
accordance with different rhythms. 

66     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The process of generating a representation in the psychic system at 
the level of the regulators is therefore as follows: 
1) a mental landscape is active and initiates a certain climate of 
activity; 
2) the regulator of the will to think activates the system and orders 
the activation of the organizational regulators; 
3) the organizational regulators of the sensations are activated and 
activate the aggregates corresponding to the tangible situation of the 
organism at that time; 
4) the situational regulators engage the impulse regulators in the 
unconscious so that they can coordinate and cooperate with the 
regulators in organizational memory and the regulators in  
the conscious in order to establish the general contextual atmosphere 
of the mental landscape where the representation will be generated; 
5) after the unification of the active regulators by these situational 
regulators, the latter will carefully adapt the mental landscape formed 
of aggregates and structuring regulators, and supervised by 
coordinated organizational regulators; 
6) the regulators of organizational memory activate themselves in 
order to activate the layers of aggregates and to situate them in the 
mental landscape; 
7) the organizational regulators that initiate aims coordinate with 
each other; one of them will become hegemonic and will initiate the 
aim in cooperation with the situational regulator in the mental 
landscape; 
8) the aggregates become aware of the aim and activate themselves 
within the framework of this aim, and, through coactivity, they 
activate other aggregates extracted from organizational memory; 
9) the structuring regulators activate themselves in order to activate 
and control the aggregates of the mental landscape to generate a 
representation corresponding to the theme of the aim; 
10) when the representation formed of controlled aggregates 
becomes coherent and is no longer developing, the conscious takes 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     67 
control of this representation, and its regulators of the feeling of 
thinking activate, helped by regulators providing emotional 
appreciations of the characteristics and the importance of the 
components of the representation. The feeling of thinking is produced 
by constructing the synthetic form for memorization, which is sent to 
short-term memory; 
11) the organizational regulators coordinate in order to proceed 
with the experienced representation and to lead to the generation of 
any subsequent representations.  
Everything is duly in relation in the psychic system, in a set of 
layers of feedback and influence driven by layers of regulators, and 
these regulators are sensitive to the energy of important aggregates, 
which will thus produce, via the general coactivity, the great power of 
the psyche. 
1.9. The attractors 
Regulators that form a morphology for rational control will not be 
the only controllers in the psychic system. There is also another 
category of controllers that will have an important role both in the 
psychic system’s creative power, and in the creation of mental 
pathologies [MAR 11]. In our model, situated as it is in the 
constructivist paradigm, there is the notion of attractors. Attractors  
are controllers of the same functional type as the regulators we have 
already presented, but they are autonomous in the sense that they  
are indifferent to the actions of the systemic layer as well as the 
regulators of the conscious. They form a relatively heterogeneous set, 
because each is equipped with autonomy and a strong ability to 
influence the system’s operation.  
The attractors  
Attractors are control elements based on the control performed 
by the regulators. These are control elements of the same type as 
the regulators but are essentially autonomous and do not depend 
on the coordinated action of the regulators of the systemic layer. 
They represent aspects of novel control at different levels 

68     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
because they are independent of the action of the conscious. 
They connect and influence the behavior of aggregates in the 
mental landscape and the preconscious so that they will adopt, 
through coactivation, a behavior with a specific morphology and 
a specific semantic in accord with their own characteristics. 
They evolve and their evolution depends heavily on both the 
system’s activities and its capacity to dampen them. 
Attractors are coactive autonomous controllers that are initially 
generated in the regulators’ orbit without being subjected to it. They 
evolve and specialize or interpret the roles of the regulators from 
which they inherit their attributes. Little by little, they will become 
autonomous in relation to the regulators from which they are derived, 
and they will function morphologically, outside of global control from 
the systemic layer and the conscious. These components communicate 
with each other and characteristically represent the aptitude for 
autonomy and novelty in the production of representations in the 
psychic system and in the formation of mental landscapes. There will 
therefore be a morphological space for the attractors that will alter the 
behavioral tendencies of the regulators in the preconscious and the 
conscious through coactivity and conflict by opposing the action of 
the regulators in the morphological space. 
The structuring regulators act to form sets of well-structured 
components that are functionally very precise in accordance with the 
tendencies exercised by the organizational regulators. The notion of an 
attractor will disturb this operation. By introducing attractors that are 
created in an autonomous surge that is not controlled by the network 
of regulators, possibilities for innovative, emergent generations are 
introduced into the system, as well as the inevitable potential for 
dysfunction. We assert that attractors are lines of influence; they are 
components that organize – locally and for themselves – the behavior 
of the groups of aggregates that they control. They tend to conform in 
a specific way to those components that they influence by altering 
their organization to adopt a certain tone, to activate them, and to 
make them coactive by providing them with some specific 
characteristics and forms that are outside of the rational action of the 
regulators. These components will generate the emotions and the 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     69 
strong tendencies and will introduce hugely original cognitive 
components with requirements that are often inadequate to the 
context. This will sometimes lead to pathologies. 
The attractors can have the same cognitive categories as the 
regulators, but their role is to disturb the rational and deterministic 
behavior of the regulators through independently controlled actions of 
will exercised by the organizational regulators in the conscious, which 
are therefore independent of the regulation exercised by the systemic 
layer. These control actions are exercised through trial and error, and 
are outside the control of the regulators by opposing themselves to the 
latter. These components will allow for the creation of associations 
that are opportune and outside of rational, or purely rational, 
comprehension and that are also purely rational between the 
aggregates of fundamental components. They will be able to create 
semantically new aggregates via new morphological creation that will 
be the key to imaginative production and to purifying creativity. In 
such an organization, creating an original representation will therefore 
consist of generating completely new conformations and sets of 
aggregates via these attractors that will lead to original components in 
parts of aggregates that were previously in conformance with and 
supervised by the regulators. Here, the notion of the morphological 
modification of representations achieves its full force. 
The attractors will therefore be autonomous controllers that have a 
variable degree of influence on the operation of the psychic system 
[MAT 10]. The minimum level of influence will lead to deterioration 
in certain specific aggregates, deforming them to a variable degree by 
introducing slightly original characteristics in certain situations. The 
maximum level of influence will entail the deformation of the 
organizational memory, of the mental landscape and of the domain of 
the regulators, which will correspond to an option of destructuration. 
Depending on the themes and characteristics of these deformations, 
we can recognize numerous themes from mental pathologies. We can 
define numerous classes of attractors according to their ontological 
domains, their breadth of deployment and their intensity. This is work 
that should be done in psychiatry; we have previously specified the 
main outlines [MAR 11]. 

70     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The systemic layer connects the conscious, which, along with the 
preconscious, experiences and produces reason, allows or prohibits the 
tendencies and extracts components of memory from the unconscious 
through the preconscious, which prepares emergences in tune with the 
mental landscape by constructing them, by aggregating them and by 
shaping neuronal aggregates. It is through the rational action of this 
layer that the quality and depth of thought and reasoning is defined, 
and it is here that we can show that, when the conscious loses its 
power over the regulators through the actions of the attractors, thought 
can either generate creativity or can become lost in meandering. 
The action of the systemic layer is regulated rationally by a 
trending control and by regulators corresponding to the culture and 
required sociability. We therefore assert that the components of 
culture anchor the regulators and even structures of regulators forming 
layers of influence in the psychic system. But the systemic layer can 
be deregulated by the attractors through their autonomy insofar as they 
benefit naturally from this opportunity for taking advantage of the 
systemic layer to react with strong autonomy according to their 
aptitudes. And here, we make use, along with the notion of a 
regulator, of a fundamental principle about living things that defines 
two impulses. Every living organism has an impulse tending to focus 
and specialize operations, and an impulse tending toward adaptability, 
toward the unfolding of its complexity. These two opposed, 
fundamental inclinations are both organizational inclinations, not 
forces centered in physical aggregates but organizational principles. 
This is why there are two types of control elements in the psychic 
system that we have introduced:  
– the regulators, which structure and act rationally in context by 
tending toward a global equilibrium negotiated over time through 
coactivity, and which organize the global state by negotiating the 
construction of broad, well-organized structures; 
– the attractors, which cause the trending surge to unfurl and which 
amplify local unfoldings, specialized and local, by going outside the 
rational context and by favoring a type of very active and original 
flow that is as efficient as possible through this specific action.  

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     71 
It is therefore through the conflict between the two control layers, 
that of the activity of the regulators and that of the activity of the 
attractors, which the question of reason in the formulation of ideas 
will play out. This is how a surge of thoughts will either become very 
coherent and rigorous, or noncoherent and even paradoxical, all while 
being apprehended by the conscious experiencing them. The notions 
of tolerable contradictions, of convincing but arbitrary simplification, 
of ease and of the loss of exigence, which are common in human 
thought, will be resolved through the resolution of this organizational 
conflict that guides all of the emergences of ideas. 
The two different classes of attractors, depending on the 
architecture of the system’s instances, are as follows: 
Preconscious attractors 
A preconscious attractor is a dynamic element with 
morphological action that has two instances: on the one hand, a 
network of action in organizational memory, which is therefore 
in the unconscious, where it connects and influences the factual 
components that support it to form a dynamic network, and, on 
the other hand, a filtering network located in the orbit of one or 
more 
regulators 
that 
carries 
out 
organizational 
and 
morphological modifications of the general aspect of the 
preconscious and the mental landscape. This attractor is always 
connected to one or more regulators that generate its 
autonomous activation through their activations, and to other 
attractors with which it combines to express themselves and to 
subdue or to inhibit dynamic components in the mental 
landscape. 
The role of a preconscious attractor will be to undertake a certain 
morphological bifurcation in the area of the active neuronal aggregates 
in the mental landscape, in the preconscious, and to modify the 
organization according to a sensitive tendency that corresponds to the 
expression of its type. The action of the attractor will consist of 
transferring its specific profile to the action of the regulators 
connecting the unconscious and the preconscious by modifying their 
behavior. This therefore completely avoids the conscious, which can 

72     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
only notice or endure the conformations forming the idea generation 
that will be perceived. It will only be able, in its turn, to activate its 
regulators to reduce this influence, if these regulators for evaluation 
demand it.  
Conscious attractors 
A conscious attractor has the same structure as a preconscious 
attractor, but it embodies the ability to provide a type of 
intention and a particular type of tonality to the general process 
of operating in the systemic layer via the mental landscape. This 
tonality indicates the intention, the will, and the atmosphere for 
the generation that will be emergent, as well as the placement in 
time of what is produced and perceived. It has the ability to 
control the activities in the systemic layer. It is its own inductor 
and can deploy itself without taking past emergences into 
account, thus creating bifurcations of the theme. The 
morphological space formed by these attractors surround a part 
of the system’s Ego. 
The conscious attractors are important agitators. They are no 
longer generating original representational forms, but are alternators 
that direct the system toward non-rational idea generations. 
In a general way, the attractors are necessary so that the psychic 
system can carry out a series of emergences under tonality and can 
specialize, by itself, in the development of well-adapted domains in 
the scenarios it represents, with the ability to create original 
representations and to process very large sets of scenarios through 
specific morphological structures. The attractors are created in the 
psychic system by a property that is intrinsic to it: the system allows 
for the creation and modification of the aspect components and the 
control components. It therefore possesses, in its native architectural 
structure, generators of attractors. The system creates itself with 
regulators that manage the fundamental, tangible and cognitive forms 
and sometimes with native, autonomous attractors that are there to 
amplify the system’s organization. This system operates and develops 
in a continuous fashion.

Let us examine an example of an action scenario for the attractors. 
Humans have very strong feelings, and the feeling of fear has a 
physical and psychic origin that can invade the system that generates 
representations. At first, during the appearance of the feeling of fear, 
every rational representation is eliminated and replaced with an 
invasive representation of blockage concerning a fact or an event and 
an inhibition of rational thought and well-managed physical behavior. 
The individual feels as though they are dominated by an event that is 
grasped in its global form, but which is not analyzed or broken down. 
This normally lasts for a short enough period of time, but it can last 
longer when the fear reinforces itself and it can eventually become 
panic. Then, after the invasive feeling, rational representations return, 
but with questions that have no precise answer, which therefore leads 
to rational control by the weakened regulators in the conscious. We 
can therefore ask whether fear is caused by an attractor that becomes 
dominant for a moment and that reduces the activity of all the 
regulators for a short time in order to be active with the reactivated 
regulators, but by disturbing the aims and representations by leaving 
behind persistent characteristics of a negative feeling. The conscious 
and the systemic layer are therefore disturbed by the action of this 
attractor. 
There are native attractors in the psychic system, but the 
construction of new attractors is always possible, depending on the 
characteristics of the person’s life and the experienced and lived-
through ruptures of consistency. A purely mental creation is the effect 
of an attractor that operates in the domain of the creation of new 
relationships and new conceptual generations by putting pressure on 
the components coming from organizational memory and by 
generating new constructions with completely original associations of 
cognitive aggregates. These attractors also allow for deep 
amplification and stabilization as a dominant mode of expression of 
the important aspects the system has generated based on its values or 
its fundamental tendencies. In this case, the ability to create and invent 
will be based on the correct use of certain attractors for adaptability 
and for a radical modification of the rational limits imposed by the 
regulators. With this potential for creation, there is great potential for 
the evolution of the psychic system, which is very powerful. But an 

74     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
attractor can end up in a situation where it has to endlessly resolve 
conflicts of tendencies between itself and the typical action of the 
regulators, which runs the risk of amplifying unstable phases. Thus, 
conflicts between the Ego and the Superego will be represented by the 
action of attractors under conditions where the conscious does not 
totally dominate what it produces. 
1.10. The generation of a representation 
We can now precisely define how a representation is generated 
using the aim, the current mental landscape and the regulators. The 
process of generating a representation has the form of an algorithm, 
but we should again specify that it is absolutely not a traditional 
algorithm that operates on data, because the operation modifies the 
elements used and the characteristics of the process itself; sometimes 
superficially but occasionally deeply. 
Once the aim has been specified, the generation of the new 
representation takes place. The process of the production and the use 
of a mental representation will therefore be as follows: 
1) there is the initial context for the production of the new 
representation, which is provided by the current mental landscape in 
the psychic system. There are situational regulators that have activated 
and coordinated the other organizational regulators to generate the 
mental landscape. This landscape, which is active and ready to tie up 
the generation of the representation, places the psychic system into a 
specific frame, depending on the general state of the person and their 
will, by focusing on a domain or based on their habits; 
2) then there is the regulator of conscious will, which generates an 
aim through the action of the intentional regulators, which are 
coordinated in the domain of the mental landscape and produce an 
instructional theme that is precise or that presents a certain emotional 
incentive. Attractors can influence the theme of the aim and can 
disturb the mental landscape. This aim can be an abstract instruction 
arising from worry, a desire to specify a characteristic of the preceding 
representation, a new intention, or a strong tension exercised by a 
sense of perception about something in the body or the general 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     75 
context. This incitement takes place above the current mental 
landscape. There can be changes to the current mental landscape by 
the regulators if the aim is of a different type than the ones the current 
mental landscape will allow; if not, there will simply be a 
reorganization of the mental landscape; 
3) immediately after the upsurge of this incitement and its 
placement into the mental landscape, the structuring regulators are 
activated by the hegemonic intentional regulator, and there is also a 
strong and parallel activation of the system’s fundamental 
components, which will generate several aggregates and immediately 
construct a pre-representation or several pre-representations about 
the theme provided by the inciting aim. Each pre-representation is a 
set of active forms according to the domains corresponding to the 
incitement, but which are not sufficient to form a well-structured and 
stable representation. A hegemonic pre-representation will be released – 
it is more important than the others and will be the one that the 
conscious will apprehend. This is how the instance of the 
preconscious of the psychic system is used; 
4) when these elementary forms will have been produced in the 
chief preconscious of the preconscious, there will be the tangible 
process of the construction of the representation that will be 
established. This amounts to initiating the operation of the control 
components in all of the instances, including the conscious, on the 
components of the pre-representation that are released into the 
preconscious, taking the psychological atmosphere of the current 
mental landscape into account to produce, develop and effectively 
construct a representation that will then be experienced through the 
activity of the control components. There will be a very rapid, 
coherent deployment of active forms organized in all the instances 
where the mental landscape is deployed, which will reinforce the 
characteristics of this mental landscape, which will have its full 
coherence. This act of the construction of characteristics in the pre-
representation is produced by the actions of the control components, 
which construct, associate and complete the characteristics by 
eliminating some of them. Each local act of construction in the mental 
landscape is produced by construction structuring regulators, which 
provide a form that is organized according to its components, with the 

76     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
regulators operating in parallel and in coactive communication. The 
constructed form, made up of multiple active aggregates, is achieved 
when a sufficient and briefly stable global form is constituted and 
expresses the reification of the aim’s theme;  
5) the representation in the mental landscape, which is briefly 
stable, is explored by the organizational regulators of the feeling of 
thinking in the conscious, which completes its construction, 
determines the characteristics and meanings of its form and provides 
the apprehension of the meaning of its set, which produces perception 
and the conscious event of the experienced representation. The 
appreciated form is dismantled after this exploration, from which a 
synthetic form is drawn. This synthetic form will then be placed, with 
its energy, into the psychic system’s short-term memory, which is 
made up of the set of memorized forms of the previously formed 
representations; 
6) depending on the intensity of the characteristics of the 
apprehended representation, the synthetic form will take its place in 
short-term memory in a form that is not (with some exceptions) the 
complete form of the representation. It will be pursued, amplified and 
specialized, or it will tend to completely fade from the mental 
landscape, and a new aim will be released with, potentially, the 
generation of another mental landscape to generate another 
representation. In all cases, depending on the state of the mental 
landscape and the current aim, the process of successive steps for 
generating the “context of the mental landscape, incitation, pre-
representation, constructed and experienced representation” starts 
again by placing a synthesis of the representation with the character-
istics of its surrounding mental landscape into organizational memory. 
To actually execute this process, it is therefore necessary to 
precisely define the controllers that will drive the activations and 
organizational actions of the aggregates: 
1) There is a large organization of regulators that control and 
activate the semantic and sensitive conformations of each 
representation under construction according to its domain, its theme 
and its characteristics: 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     77 
i) there are regulators that remove the current context and that 
generate the current mental landscape by activating and coordinating 
the other organizational regulators;  
ii) there are regulators that will initiate an aim, an incitation, a 
focus on a precise or a relatively vague theme and others that will 
generate the pre-representation in the current context by calling the 
aggregates in organizational memory; 
iii) there are regulators that drive the activation and action of the 
aggregates that make up the explicit representation from the pre-
representation, depending on the context provided by the landscape 
and the incitation of the aim. 
2) All of these regulators communicate; they are not independent, 
nor do they form distinct layers, but they constitute an organization 
with interactive levels. This co-activation will allow for a very 
flexible, keen and powerful rational operation. 
3) All of these regulators, primarily the regulators driving the 
deployment of the aggregates, will produce the characteristics of the 
feeling of apprehension of the representation, according to their 
intensities and their capacities for influence. There are activations of 
the 
regulators 
of 
feeling, 
intention, 
interrogation, 
naming, 
characterization, openness or closure and there are obviously 
regulators insuring coherence of all the local aspects of the 
representation under construction so that it will be globally well– 
organized and homogeneous. 
4) Such a psychic system is therefore interpreted and understood as 
a complex dynamic system that controls itself in order to construct 
conformations, which is fundamentally a system for controlling the 
forms that it constructs to apprehend them and to memorize them 
synthetically. 
Therefore, the role and the characteristics of the regulators that 
lead to the construction of the mental representation and its 
apprehension are major. They are components that act at several levels 
as local organizational fields, which activate the components of 
memory to construct conformations of aggregates. This type of system 
resembles the autopoetic systems of Morin [MOR 14a]. 

78     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
All of these regulators must coactivate continuously to regulate 
their actions. Such a system is extremely efficient, but it is rather 
fragile, especially because of the action of the attractors. The failure of 
certain regulators that begin to operate rigidly and systematically 
without coactivating with others, or the action of the attractors, will be 
the cause of many mental pathologies. 
1.11. Unification between regulators and neuronal aggre-
gates: the morphological model of the generating forms  
What we have so far defined explains that the control components 
provoke the operation, stabilities and instabilities in the system. For 
this purpose, the system uses the notion of control over a set of 
neuronal aggregates that itself supports the components with semantic 
characteristics and whose organized union will generate the meaning 
of the emergent representation. We are taking an approach that 
distinguishes semantic components from their control, but that does 
not specify precisely enough which components carry the semantics or 
how they are formed. However, we have a neuronal system in which 
neurons are strongly connected by the synapses; everything is 
neuronal and connected, and we therefore must further specify the 
notion of memory and action in such a system. And we assert that this 
memory is not an accumulation of already formed components that 
can be extracted and activated, as in computer memory, but that there 
are constructive components that reconstruct the forms of what was 
memorized in order to be able to use it dynamically. 
We therefore assert that all of the components that organize 
themselves to produce representations, that provide semantics and that 
exercise control are components that have geometric forms, allowing 
for their aggregation and that are made up of spatialized aggregates of 
neurons. We are going to redefine the general meaningful components 
of the neuronal system at the level of the formation of representations, 
which will be spatial forms made up of groups of highly coactive 
neurons. And there will be two kinds of such forms in the geometry of 
the neuronal system: those that exercise morphological control and 
those that form geometrically to represent the components of memory. 
We will call these components generating forms. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     79 
Generating forms 
We assert that components intervening functionally at the level 
of the generation of mental representations are of one single 
category: they are geometric and energetic components 
configured in the neuronal network that have their own proactive 
capability that pushes them to co-activation, that deploy 
semantic characteristics or control characteristics that their 
activity will express through influence on and association with 
other components. We will call them generating forms, and 
they are materially and spatially of two types: generating forms 
for memory and generating forms for regulation. The forms 
for memory anchor the components of organizational memory, 
and the forms for regulation ensure the control for all levels in 
the system. These components make up a dynamic self-
organization; the entire system will be, at several levels, made 
up of components with geometric aspects that conform to each 
other, activate each other and co-activate in organizational 
cooperation to engender, through their actions, the emergence of 
a representation that will be apprehended and perceived for a 
brief instant. These forms have a property that distinguishes 
them from permanent mathematical functions: their activation 
always brings about their structural and organizational 
modification because they memorize the activities of the system 
so that they exist continuously for the duration. 
 
The problem will therefore be to define the extent of the activities 
of these generating forms for exercising semantic and control actions, 
which will determine the characteristics of emergent generations and 
the psychological profile of the generator of these emergences. The 
generating forms are therefore well-structured groups of neurons 
connected by the actions of the synapses, which allows them to have 
geometric forms that are similar to flat or twisted linear wires, to flat 
or curved layers, to coiling or enveloping forms, or to toruses or 
polyhedrons. The distribution of active neurons in these generating 
forms will represent their characteristics, which will allow, for 
example, the representation of words in a language and the formation 
of sentences through dynamic geometric aggregations. These 
components have a geometry that represents both their semantics and 

80     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
their capacity for connective action through the propagation of energy 
toward other forms. These components are made to act through 
connectivity and to form aggregates of active generating forms 
producing representations. In the brain, they will be situated in 
specific domains representing the system’s instances and the 
subdomains of these instances, allowing them to specify their 
semantic characteristics and their roles in specific actions. 
As asserted, there are two kinds of generating forms. There is the 
regulatory kind, which corresponds to the regulators we have defined 
(the forms for regulation), which will determine the tendencies of the 
system such as needs, desires, the need to produce an aim, the need to 
generate a representation and the need to memorize every 
representation, which will produce the feeling of thinking. These 
forms are active morphological graphs formed of connections between 
small clusters of neurons. And then there will be the forms of 
memory, which will represent components of organizational memory 
at every level and will be formed of small active networks of clearly 
localized neurons. Things that are memorized by the psychic system 
are not components that are constructed and located in an immense 
memory that should be searched for and activated through 
localization; rather they are components that are reconstructed each 
time, starting from an incitement of the components made for this 
reconstruction. Organizational memory is dynamic and constructive, 
with a conformation deploying the categories of components apt to 
produce specific characteristics through hierarchies of subdomains 
and has nothing to do with computing-type memory or with a 
dictionary in which the memorized facts are categorized. We will 
develop the way in which the reconstructions of memory are formed. 
There are thus two kinds of generating forms in the psychic system 
when it forms that are operational as soon as the infant’s brain is 
conceived and active. At this stage, the generating forms will 
apprehend the developing body and the information coming from the 
senses and will generate very simple representations. The system will 
systematically become more complex, continuously, notably when the 
brain grows in size, and will then become more complex through use. 
At the level of the functional individual, the brain is made up of 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     81 
generating forms that characterize all of its categories of idea 
production. We can assert that it is organized by the generating forms 
of regulations, which will produce all of the new forms of the system 
during a continuous learning process. The forms of initial regulation 
will be able to make the system more complex because it is not a 
cluster of neurons that functions mechanically but an evolving 
organization 
of 
conformations 
that 
continuously 
generates 
representations. There will therefore be basic generating forms of 
regulation that will determine fundamental characteristics and that will 
form the beginning of the psychic system, with layers of aggregates 
shaped and spatialized to produce emergences of representations. 
Then there will be the operation of this dynamic complex system: the 
use of forms, the modification of certain generating forms and the 
continuous creation of new forms, especially memory forms. 
The notion of a mental landscape is now very clear. It is the 
organized set of active generating forms that make up a geometric 
organization of several active networks having specific characteristics, 
and these geometric characteristics will indicate the semantic and 
emotional characteristics of the psychic system at that time. 
The groups of active aggregates that we can see using neuronal 
imaging are sets of neurons in generating forms. The aggregate is only 
a local and one-time image of a group of neurons; this group is a 
component of an organization whose spatiality can represent 
conceptual components, like the words in a sentence or memorized 
images, and that is in contact spatially with other aggregates in other 
generating forms. The geometric and informational characteristics of 
each generating form provide its type, its meaning, its role and its 
importance. Its action at the physical level is an energetic wrapping 
that organizes the connections between these groups of neurons and 
engages in informational coactivity with other neuronal groups located 
in other connected generating forms. The entire psychic structure must 
therefore be considered in regards to the following three 
characteristics, which should be considered in this order: the 
geometric aspects, the informational characteristics and the deployed 
and propagated energetic intensity. The knowledge of these forms is 
an excellent research domain for inquiry. 

82     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
Every use of a generating form in the production of a 
representation entails the communicational activity of these neuronal 
aggregates and coactivity with other forms that are connected to its 
structure to a variable degree. And the act of producing the 
representation amounts to constructing a conformation made up of 
several forms whose parts are very active and also strongly coactive. 
This distinguishable part of very active forms is differentiated from 
the rest of the system by the process of evaluation and by proceeding 
with the structural and organizational modification of each form, if the 
equivalences that led to its aggregative activity are new, through new 
links between aggregates or new flows of energy between some 
aggregates. The system’s memory exists in its very organization, and 
that is why we call it organizational memory, and it is modified, 
reinforced, or altered to a variable degree, depending on the intensity 
of the organization of each representation that is generated. 
The activated generating forms of memory will be modified to a 
variable degree with each use. They are initially activated by 
generating small generating forms that coactivate, regroup and unify. 
These regroupings and this structured unification, which produces the 
new representations, will potentially change the roles of the forms that 
constitute it. Certain forms may have been able to be introduced into 
the representation by augmenting the characteristics and the system 
through the action of the generating forms of regulation that will 
analyze the representation and will then modify the coactive 
connections between the aggregates of the forms of memory that 
constitute the new landscape. Thus, the memory will modify itself by 
keeping itself up-to-date. This memory therefore has two 
characteristics of the active components of the generating form for 
memory, one representing symbolic characteristics and another 
representing the connections with other forms of memory. 
The construction of the generating forms of memory occurs as 
follows: 
1) a generating form of regulation is active, and its activity 
compels it to initiate the forms of memory. It therefore contains in 
itself the activators of the forms of memory and will choose to initiate 
a form of memory; 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     83 
2) it activates a certain number of neuronal groups in its context 
that will make up the components of memory of the activated form; 
3) it compels these neurons to activate according to a geometric 
form that will be the expression of the thing in memory to be 
activated; 
4) the groups of neurons coactivate and form their networks of 
synaptic connections so that the dynamic graph of their relationships 
has the conformation of a precise kind, representing the memorized 
thing that is then active; 
5) if this generating form of regulation must compel other forms of 
memory, it does so, and it compels coactive connections between all 
these forms of memory by delivering energy and information through 
its synaptic connections; 
6) it therefore consists of a conformation of memory that is 
localized in the mental landscape and that is the representation being 
generated; 
7) meanwhile, other generating forms of regulation have completed 
the same thing at the same time. These generating forms will 
communicate to aggregate, unify and command the sets of forms of 
memory in the representation, which then will be stabilized and 
therefore available; 
8) the representation in the mental landscape is available to be 
analyzed by the generating forms of regulation of the conscious, 
which will produce perception and cause these characteristics to be 
memorized.  
There is therefore a process for creating constructive memory calls 
through the act of controlling the forms of regulation. These forms of 
regulation, which are fundamental components of the system, have 
structures that enable the following actions: 
1) these forms have the well-defined structure of an action 
network, with a conformation that can be changed but that must 
maintain a specific structural foundation to prevent itself from 
becoming deficient or inoperable; 

84     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
2) they are active if they have been activated by an energy flow; if 
not, they are dormant, and their structure does not participate in any of 
the system’s activities; 
3) they contain, in the form of networks of neurons having specific 
conformations, instructions about the type of activity that specifies 
their actions, according to their types, and that are part of the general 
framework: initiating forms of memory, initiating actions in the 
sensory system, responding to tangible information from the system 
and initiating the acts of activation or deactivation of other forms of 
regulation. 
We have seen in the previous sections that certain regulators are 
always active; as a result, certain forms of regulation that have the 
same functional type as these regulators will always be active: a form 
of regulation analyzing the senses and initiating, for this, the creation 
of forms of memory, a form initiating an aim, a form initiating 
tendencies, impulses, emotions, etc. The continuous activation of 
forms of regulations leading to the generation of forms of memory 
practically drives the persistence of these forms of memory. In the 
background of the mental landscape, there is a permanent physical 
image that provides an image of the body and what it perceives. 
All of the forms that should be active characterize the psyche, and 
their characteristics have been very clearly specified by psychiatrists 
and psychologists, who have defined the importance of certain 
impulsive forms leading to the definition of types and psychic 
characteristics. 
The creation of new generating forms of regulation is a powerful 
specialty of this system. There can be a specialization from a 
generating form of regulation that is frequently used to provide the 
system with more possibilities to generate emergences of specific 
representations. When a form of regulation acts frequently by 
activating specific forms of memory, thereby forming a category of 
activated facts of memory, a new form of regulation can be generated 
that is based on the old one, so that it no longer generates this class of 
facts of memory. It is a regulating subform; it is the formation of a 
specific type of thoughts, a focus. And it can be created through 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     85 
generalization, thus conceptually surpassing two forms of generating 
regulation. 
There is also the possibility of the generation of a new form of 
regulation in the frame where the generating forms of regulation make 
up the current representation, producing a very complicated aspect in 
the mental landscape with different domains that are not producing 
general coherence with a unifying emergence, and therefore no clear 
feeling. If this form has come into being repeatedly, leading to the 
production of non-coherent emergences that are badly perceived, 
action will be taken by a trending generating form, a fundamental 
organizational regulating form that has shaped the system from the 
beginning and that will tend to create a new generating form based on 
the characteristics of the forms of memory and the active, antagonistic 
forms of regulation, so that coherent types of emergences are 
produced. This is an act of organized coherence in the system that 
does not use higher reason in any way: it is a question of producing 
coherent and clearly perceived emergences when the usual generating 
forms do not manage to do so. 
Creation of new generating forms of regulation 
Through its operation and its use of the underlying fundamental 
generating forms of regulation, whose role will allow for coherence 
increasing complexity of the operation of the system, can become 
more complex on the control level. With this fundamental activity 
generating forms of regulation, every generating form of regulation 
can be brought to create new generating forms of regulation 
through specializations or generalizations. 
In order for a new form of regulation to be created, there have to be 
very specific conditions and a very specific process that must occur. 
This is relatively similar to the process of the self-generation of a new 
structure in computing. We have asserted that the system that 
produces emergences of representations has an organizational 
generating form that tends to balance and add complexity to the 
system. This generating form of regulation is the form that will extend 
so far as to generate normal, simple and satisfying emergences, and 
also to resolve the distinctions between antagonistic tendencies and 

86     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
anomalies in emergences. This organizational generating form has 
nothing to do with the conscious, but it is the form of control that 
allows the conscious to operate correctly in a permanent way. 
It is therefore an evolving psychic system that will create new 
generating forms as necessary during the individual’s physical 
development, then as necessary because of social adaptation and 
learning, through the practice of economic, sexual and cultural life. 
We can therefore assert that the human psychic system is initially an 
organization with generating forms inherited from its position in the 
living being, but with very strong potential for creating new 
generating forms of regulation, which are enabled by its social and 
cultural life in highly organized and, especially, highly evolving 
communities. 
1.12. The morphological and semantic conformation of the 
psychic system 
We can therefore think of the psychic system as being composed of 
a large number of components having specific forms that are often 
intermingled with characteristics of informational, sensitive and 
semantic actions that are situated in specific domains, such as the 
localization of psychic instances. The generating forms of regulation 
are structures of neuronal aggregates that are characterized by their 
geometric form, their energy and their characteristics of semantic 
incitement. These are strictly forms with three spatial dimensions, 
representing active graphs, which are made up of several groups of 
strongly connected neurons and which convey energy and 
information. These forms can share spatial areas, as is the case for 
deployments of regulating forms situated in different domains, acting 
and generating the current representation. They are more or less 
important in size and in spatial deployment, which will make up their 
geometric complexity. There will be enveloping forms, highly 
connected forms, fairly closed and isolated forms such as ribbons, 
cones or spheres. The smaller the size, the more they express specific 
characteristics. The larger they are spatially at the information and 
energy level, and the more divided they are between different 
domains, the more they have characteristics of extensive control, 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     87 
which will be the forms of regulation established for specifying the 
system’s fundamental tendencies.  
The generating forms of regulation are dormant or active 
depending on the state of the system’s activity, but some will always 
be active, such as those that apprehend sensory information and the 
organizational generating form. When they are active, these forms are 
highly coactive at several levels because they have a spatial 
characteristic that makes them routinely communicative through the 
sharing of parts of their layers. Each form can therefore communicate 
in parallel with several other forms, which allowing for the production 
of rich and complex representations. In every case, these forms can 
have and dispense energy to activate, energy that they receive through 
their action in the substrate of neurons and the system’s specific 
chemical components. According to their geometric configuration, 
they are made to be able to confront each other or to be relatively 
indifferent to influence from other forms. The scale of observation of 
the brain’s psychic activity should therefore be carried out based on, 
firstly, the classification and then the identification of the activity of 
all of these forms. 
The generating forms of regulation carry meaning and are 
considered as localized in the psychic system’s four general instances – 
the unconscious, the center of emotions, the preconscious and the 
conscious – and, in fact, they create the existence of these four 
instances through their roles. The fifth instance, defined as the 
systemic layer and which houses important regulators, also exists in 
this model. This is where the tendency for general organizational 
regulation exists, which connects all of the generating forms at the 
informational level, regulates the organization and leads to the 
existence of the general space of regulation and of the semantic 
morphology of the coactive regulating forms that is the psychic 
system on its neuronal substrate. 
The system is then seen as a machine under continuous self-
organization in three-dimensional space that never stops activating 
and reconstructing the sets of neuronal aggregates situated in specific 
spatial conformations of the generating forms of memory by 
producing deformations, reshapings, separations and reunions; all of 

88     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
the activities that have algebraic characteristics also have particularly 
geometric characteristics as well as obvious semantic characteristics. 
The notion of geometric conformation therefore becomes central. 
There are active geometric forms that represent meaningful 
components in the generated representation. But these forms are 
coactive and will organize among themselves. Thus, there are forms 
that will append themselves to others, which will embed themselves in 
others, which will surround others. Through these multiple geometric 
actions, the system can organize countless conformations that produce 
apprehended mental representations. We can see the internal 
representations of spoken or heard sentences; these sentences have 
forms with multiple conformations that make them rich. There will 
also be generating forms of regulation that are often very active, and 
through these it will be possible to characterize the individual’s 
general psychic type. 
Such unification between neuronal aggregates and generating 
forms of regulation clearly expresses the central role of control in the 
generation of ideas, a role that must obviously be clearly specified 
through the semantic characteristics carried by the activated 
components expressing the meaningful characteristics of the 
representations.  
We can define the main characteristics of a generating form of 
regulation in the system: 
– its domain in the different instances and specific parts of the 
brain; 
– its geometric characteristics and its geometric category; 
– its scope, its internal graph of communications between neuronal 
groups, with its importance in nodes and arcs, as well as its spatial 
deployment; 
– the energy it should have available in order to activate; 
– its specific semantic characteristics, its ontological class; 
– its expressive role and its types of possible actions; 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     89 
– its actions and its programs for constructing conformations for 
generating forms of memory in groups of neurons, which is very 
explicit for linguistic forms; 
– its history and its evolution; 
– its positive acquaintances: the other generating forms of 
regulation to which it is connected for cooperation; 
– its negative acquaintances: the other generating forms with which 
it is opposed during its activity; 
– its ability for memorization, deformation, development and 
change in volume; 
– the frequency of its activation and the specification of its 
importance; 
– its domination over other generating forms of regulation, its 
neutrality or its subordinate characteristic/s.  
The main characteristics of a generating form of memory are as 
follows: 
– the generating forms of regulation that are its generator; 
– the information and the program that the group of neurons must 
receive to activate and adapt in order to serve through its 
configuration; 
– its spatial conformation and its geometric openness or closure; 
– its type and therefore its local importance; 
– its action of calling the necessary forms or the calling for their 
generation to amplify the process of its activity; 
– its capacity for consistency or evolution: its stability; 
And the operation of the system with the generating forms must 
therefore be as follows: 
1) there are active generating forms of regulation, including those 
that ensure the interpretation of sensory information coming from the 
body and the generation of the aim; the brain is never without activity, 

90     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
and there is an active mental landscape that is specific or vague 
depending on the system’s state of attention; 
2) the generating forms of regulation that have the role of initiating 
an aim to activate and regulate themselves, and an aim is activated in 
the mental landscape. If the aim is weak, the current mental landscape 
is used (state with limited attention);  
3) generating forms of regulation relative to the domain of the aim 
are concurrently activated; they regulate themselves, and some will be 
sufficiently active to form a coherent and coactive set; 
4) the conformation with the influential active forms of regulation 
that were inactive and that may possibly complete them, enriching 
them through geometric and energetic operations and activating the 
generating forms of memory; 
5) the general organization of the forms of regulation and the forms 
of memory is constituted and stabilized, its components no longer 
activate others; they form a relatively geometrically stable 
conformation. The form of representation in the mental landscape is 
therefore able to be perceived; 
6) the generating forms of regulation, which have the role of 
validating the available conformation made up of forms of memory 
and regulation to operate. They evaluate the conformations of the 
representation by detaching syntheses. Here, the system of generating 
forms that causes the feeling of thinking globally evaluates, through 
domains and components, the conformations that have been created as 
conformations. This action targets memorization before any change in 
these conformations in the landscape in order to initiate another 
landscape. This action requires analysis and the expenditure of force 
and energy by the generating forms to realize the modification of the 
conformations. This action is an internal sensation that has all  
of the characteristics of a physical sensation with action: this is the 
feeling of thinking about something that is being produced; 
7) having perceived the representation, the system accomplishes its 
required memorization by passing it through short-term memory with 
local memorization of the connections between the constituents of the 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     91 
components; the meta-regulator for continuous operation dampens the 
current aim, which is no longer dominant; 
8) the generating forms of regulation that initiate aims reactivate in 
order to define a new one, and the process of thought generation 
initiates a new generating action. 
This process is clearly described in an algorithmic way, because it 
is composed of a succession of events in space and time, with certain 
actions realized in parallel. A question can be raised concerning the 
generating forms of regulation activated by the aim: what are the 
chosen forms and how strong is the coherence of the control 
components for generating a conformation that is clearly coherent 
with the aim and that fully uses organizational memory? This question 
concerns the coherence and the strength of the psychic system, and it 
will be necessary to specify the action of control of the generating 
forms that permit the production of emergences. 
1.13. The processing component of the visual sense with 
generating forms 
The use of the senses allows for positioning in the surrounding 
reality, by giving the body the ability to behave and to act effectively 
by means of the generation of specific representations. The 
information provided by the senses is analyzed and processed in fairly 
complex ways, such as with vision, which allows for the 
representation of a series of images of reality that are not only three 
dimensional but are made up of things that are perceived according to 
their relative positions, their colors and their actions, as well as their 
local and predictable trajectories for objects in motion. The senses 
continuously generate mental constructions that, based on each target 
of observation, can be highly developed by the forms of regulation. 
A view of surrounding reality is a construct that is highly 
developed because it provides the positions and the three-dimensional 
forms of objects as well as information about the size of these objects 
through comparative scales and relative distances, and it enables a 
focus on zones or on specific objects to apprehend their 

92     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
characteristics, all while remaining in the domain of the real global 
landscape. For this, based on the visual apprehension that is initially a 
request for representation of its position in space–time, the system 
constructs the sequence of visual representations by requesting focus 
on parts, components and details of components. All vision is 
therefore a regular sequence of representations; it is a flow of mental 
constructs according to the requests of aims concerning deepenings, 
comparisons and distinctive features. It is absolutely not a complete 
picture that is initially grasped and then processed, as is the case with 
traditional image analysis in computing that begins with tables of 
pixels; rather, it is a series of constructs that are produced by 
requesting that the gaze focus on certain apprehended parts that the 
system of representation wants to apprehend in detail. Therefore, in 
this continuous representational process, the memory is strongly 
activated, and the constructed representations take knowledge about 
familiar images into account. There are things considered as familiar 
and common that are clearly identified, and there are things that are 
barely or not at all familiar, whose characteristics will have to be 
specified so that they can be identified. The process focuses on the 
thing to be specified, because the order to focus on the eyes operates 
implicitly, thereby developing the cognitive characteristic in the 
apprehension of the image. 
Here, it is very clear that internal visual representation uses 
categories of mental landscapes corresponding to common situations 
and to the things that are usually observed. We can assert that many 
categories and families of mental landscapes of vision exist, according 
to one’s habits. In what is apprehended, the geometric forms 
represented by the internal generating forms absolutely do not 
correspond exactly to the geometric forms of the real things that are 
seen; rather, they are an organization of conformations of generating 
forms with characteristics of geometric description and relationships 
that endlessly adapt to apprehended reality, depending on the focus. 
But how are these internal generating forms constituted, and how do 
they function to represent the seen landscape? This is the problem that 
will be resolved by explicating the relationships between the real 
observed landscape and the mental landscape that will represent it. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     93 
A real landscape is a domain of space containing multiple 
volumetric components that create its structure and its organization. It 
is apprehended by the vision, grasped as structurally comprehensible 
and knowable in relation to the observer’s internal circumstances 
when seeing the real landscape. The observer constructs what is 
commonly called a cognitive map, which is a sort of Euclidean space 
where the evaluated distances can be summed up and therefore 
provide every distance between one point and another to complete a 
trip. Apprehending real landscapes always entails a certain 
understanding through visual habit; there is no radical objectivity, but 
the interpretation is sometimes very sophisticated. There is a 
relationship of tangible apprehension between a human being and the 
environment where the human finds themselves; the view of real 
things is not an objective image of physical characteristics, but rather 
an understanding that is both sensitive, geometric and cognitive, and 
that will be interpreted by the conscious. A visual aim leads to a focus 
on one or more domains that will necessarily have semantic 
characteristics supplied by memory.  
There are generating forms that will lead to the formation of the 
representation of what is seen, and there are generating forms that will 
be three-dimensional interpretations of things in the real landscape 
that will organize to form a correspondence with observed reality. 
There are therefore numerous generating forms that will be activated 
and that will represent the components of reality. We can therefore 
assert that there are numerous generating forms of regulation and of 
visual memory. 
The mental form of an apprehended view 
The mental form of a seen thing that is presented in the mental 
landscape to be apprehended consciously is twofold: it is 
initiated by visual generating forms that lead to a type of visual 
and observational input with geometric and three-dimensional 
Euclidean characteristics, and with visual generating forms that 
represent the constructs of the components that are visually 
apprehended. Then, there are generating forms that cognitively 
and sensitively interpret the visual generating forms, which are 
cognitive components with semantic classifications of these 

94     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
components and which are usually generating forms of a 
linguistic and therefore conceptual type. There is thus an 
automatic preinterpretation of what is seen in order to adapt the 
structure of the representation in the mental landscape, and then 
there is the apprehension of the conformation of this generating 
representation, which will be both sensitive and cognitive. 
There will therefore be types of generating forms of regulation that 
will initiate the local activity of visual generating forms in order to 
communicate with cognitive-type generating forms of regulation so 
that these forms, in cooperation, generate the associated and 
corresponding designations. It is therefore the question of a complex 
operation that associates the characteristics of reality with the concept 
than we have of it, and that will determine our knowledge of the 
world, where part of the designation, as well as acquired knowledge, 
is associated with everything that is apprehended by the senses. 
Observing a landscape therefore consists of interpreting a sequence 
of conformations of mental representations and grasping some of 
these objects in order to name and interpret them in a continuous 
manner. Seeing is an act of interpretation that orders the eyes to focus 
on certain components so that they furnish internal conformations that 
are immediately interpreted as familiar or unfamiliar objects, that are 
identified, and categorized and that produce feelings that modify the 
current mental landscape, where the generation of interpretations 
continues. The external forms that hold the focus produce the 
conformations of internal forms in the mental landscape along with a 
contextual domain that is the interpretation of the set of the regarded 
real landscape, which is always available in the background through 
general forms. We therefore have an internal mental landscape that 
has a precise local relationship with the external real landscape, and 
which will lead, through inevitable abstraction in the operation of the 
psyche, to its understanding, by providing it with semantic 
characteristics using the knowledge of names and by producing 
geometric estimates. And what is apprehended is an interpretation of 
reality, with those things selected through focus because they were 
recognized, parts of the noticed things, connections between things, 
the actions of things, comparative dimensions. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     95 
The relationship between reality and internal forms is not at all a 
geometric isomorphism; there is no mathematic similarity between the 
real landscape and the internal conformations. There are visual 
generating forms with neuronal aggregates making explicit the 
structures, colors and textures of components seen by the eyes that are 
positioned to respect distances, separations and domains, and there is a 
systematic, elementary interpretation of these components, as well as 
a 
cognitive 
and 
sensitive 
interpretation 
of 
these 
internal 
representatives. There is an immediate accumulation of conformations 
expressing recognition of the sensation associated with familiar 
things, and it is this general conformation in the visual mental 
landscape that will be apprehended as perceived consciousness. This 
is the mental landscape proposed to the conscious, representing 
components with two meanings: internal images of real objects and 
their usual meanings, their cognitive categories and the feelings that 
they inspire. With this duality, there will be, in the apprehension of the 
representation, the knowledge and feeling provided by these 
components of the observed landscape, which lead to a pursuit of the 
investigation of a newly focal point, or the passage to apprehension of 
another identified thing in the mental landscape that exists in the real 
landscape. And it is precisely for this reason that things that are 
unusual and unfamiliar are immediately noticed, because they have no 
associated meaningful connotation and are an anomaly in the set of 
forms with these two meanings. 
The apprehension of the visual generating form will grasp things, 
their conformations, their denotations and their tangible appraisals. 
This will entail a deepening of certain components and the disposition 
of certain others as subordinate. The mental landscape will remain in 
its general form, but the mental apprehension will order a focus on 
certain components to apprehend other characteristics. Short-term 
memory will retain the global form, and certain focuses will be more 
tangible. Here, the psychic system demonstrates a form of deployment 
in a domain that systematically makes use of the organizational 
memory. 
The generating forms representing components in the surrounding 
space are therefore components that define two characteristics, one 

96     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
expressing the physical aspects of components apprehended by the 
vision and the other expressing semantic and tangible aspects of these 
components. These new conformations are constructed with a focus 
on what is contextual to what is actually focused on, but which 
remains geometrically well positioned in relation to what was 
previously focused on, and can therefore be apprehended by scanning 
the real landscape. We should consider that each geometrically 
apprehended form deploys its meaning through those characteristics of 
its physical texture, with its volume specifying it in its context, its 
apparent structural complexity, its color and its common or novel 
characteristics. For this, there are elementary geometrical forms in 
memory that define the geometric types of fundamental components, 
such as broken lines and their horizontal, vertical or diagonal 
placement, rectangles, circles and all distortions of these components, 
which lose their regularity but maintain their relationships with these 
fundamental types. 
This calls into question research concerning the development of 
systems of artificial recognition based on clouds of pixels captured by 
cameras and stored in matrices that are then analyzed section by 
section during processing by semantic interpreters that will try to 
recognize the components: the semantics must be done simultaneously 
with image capture, and object recognition must lead to a control of 
the continuous focus of the visual apparatus, which must therefore be 
multiple and not unitary, and produce a simple layer of pixels in order 
to construct a series of representations intentionally constructed by a 
system of apprehension. 
Vision is a very important behavioral action in the psychic system 
for the positioning of the individual; it is a continuous action, 
sometimes underlying other superficial representations, which allows 
for other more profound representations. The process of apprehending 
the representation that we have defined, which causes conscious 
awareness of what is given to be apprehended and maintains the 
interpretations of seen things in short-term memory, operates centrally 
here. The usual vision of the environment is a major process that, 
depending on experience and with a well-evaluated understanding of 
things, situates living beings in their environments by being specific to 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     97 
different species depending on their physical aptitudes and their 
lifestyles. This visual cognitive apprehension applies to all species that 
have a visual center: every animal that sees apprehends, according to 
its way of life and its acquired habits, the meaning of what they see as 
being familiar and congruent or novel and to be avoided, or to be 
considered more carefully, to be apprehended as interesting. 
1.14. The decisive intention to think 
We can now address the major problem of making the decision to 
think, taking into account the well-structured aspect of what will be 
proposed to the conscious when it apprehends what is seen so that it 
perceives, appreciates, analyzes and generates aims. The conscious is 
not a meta-controller above a system that simply generates specific 
idea emergences; it is a constructor of generating forms that 
apprehends and synthetically memorizes; it is a constructor that 
operates organizationally with all of the impulsive, cognitive and 
sensitive controllers at all levels. So, what is the extent of the mastery 
of the conscious in the production of ideas? This is the central 
question concerning the operation of the psychic system: how does the 
conscious master the development of its idea productions, how does it 
use its organizational memory intentionally, how do the generating 
forms that come from the tendencies and the impulses take their place 
implicitly and what directly uses organizational memory by bringing 
forms to take place in the emergences of the representations?  
The problem of the mastery of the conscious  
In the mental landscape where the effects of vision are produced, 
the psychic system generates pre-representations with aspects 
that are both cognitive and sensitive and that have used 
organizational memory. These forms are deployed and enriched 
by generating forms in the conscious, and then apprehended and 
perceived in the conscious through investigation and synthetic 
construction. So, what is the mastery of consciousness in the 
produced thoughts that are based on voluntary aims, and how 
does it construct, through its control, representations that are 
mastered by the aims? 

98     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
We will respond in a constructivist manner to this question. A 
generating form that is able to define and impose a choice of aim in a 
carefully defined context must exist, and this controller must not be 
subordinate to generating forms of regulation that impose affective 
aspects, specific forms of memory, or trending aspects, nor to 
generating forms of the attractor type that impose specific 
qualifications on each representation by altering the aims. It is 
therefore necessary to assert that a generating form exists that imposes 
mastery over the choice of an aim in all mental landscapes.  
Such a generating form does actually exist: it is the fundamental 
generating form of regulation that expresses the will to think. We will 
call this form the generating form for decision-making intention. 
This form exists in the conscious and the systemic layer; it is always 
active and available, waiting for activity, asking itself to produce an 
action that defines the characteristics of an aim. It will be necessary 
for the process of producing representations with the defined aim. But 
the problem is to always be able to use it, to not be in a constrained 
situation where tendencies impose aims or alter choices made about 
the proposed aim.  
Generating form for decision-making intention 
There exists a fundamental generating form of regulation at the 
meta level that waits for the choice of an aim exercised by the 
generating form of the generation of an aim to produce a thought 
in the context of the mental landscape in order to be able to 
proceed to a series of coherent thoughts on a chosen theme. It is 
the generating form for intentional decision making, which 
will produce the choice of aim in the context of the mental 
landscape where a number of regulating forms are active, and 
which initiates the regulating action to generate the 
representation according to the theme proposed by the aim. This 
is the internal continuous action that each individual must do in 
the active psychic system, so that this form waiting for the aim 
will be provided and will produce the series of wanted 
representations. This generating form of meta regulation, which 
is always waiting for an intention when no precise aim has been 
initiated, is the dominant generating form, but it is not the only 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     99 
one that is meta, and, to make it more effective when one wants 
the decision to think to be activated, a certain mastery of the 
physical, sensitive and psychological state is required. 
The generating forms on the meta level are all situated in a specific 
domain of the conscious and there are always several to be activated. 
There is the one that imposes the choice of an aim, those providing the 
generating characteristics of the mental landscape through calls to 
active facts in memory, and those activating the perceptible 
representations coming from the body in action, of which the vision 
apprehends the environment in order to be able to behave in it. It is 
therefore necessary to be able to provide the decision to act to the 
form that generates the choice of the aim in the context of the mental 
landscape, which must be open. This is typically, habitually done with 
a regular practice of self-mastery. Providing meaning to a generating 
form at the meta level is the result of its regular activation, which 
gives it supremacy compared to the others. 
The important fact, and the one that must always occur according 
to the form of the intentional decision, is to choose an aim and to 
engage the conscious to use it to produce a first representation. 
Moreover, the aim is taken from the mental landscape. The mental 
landscape is always very rich; it contains active generating forms of 
memory coming from the preceding representations and from their 
contexts; it contains forms expressing the current sensation; and it 
contains a physical representation, all of whose parts are available. It 
is therefore sufficient to use the generating form of the choice of aim 
so that the generating form for decision-making intention asks to 
request and to set a theme from those available in the mental 
landscape. The chosen theme will then be the aim, the generation of a 
pre-representation, and a first representation. Then, there will be the 
deepening and production of a series, often short, of representations 
that form a surge by soliciting more specific aims and by acceding to 
generating forms of the organizational memory. 
The psychic system therefore possesses a meta subsystem that 
leads it to intentionally and continuously produce representations 
when it is active. These representations can be truly deliberate through 
the incitement of the production of an aim that the form of the 

100     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
decision-making intention engages, which is an apprehension of this 
generating form about itself that the psychic system provides for itself. 
This aptitude for wanting to produce thoughts signifies that the 
psychic system has a reflexive, self-organizing function at this level 
that is waiting to activate a commitment for this generating form 
of this meta regulation. This generating form of intentional  
decision-making, which produces the aim, therefore defines the idea of 
consciousness and of will in the system. We can say that the psychic 
system waits for a request to be given to this meta generating form, 
which can allow it to be activated by defining an aim in the context of 
the mental landscape, and which, if not, will provide the supremacy to 
another generating form of the aim connected to the context and to the 
affectivity, with vague and simply sensitive representations.  
The intentional consciousness of the system 
The generating form of meta regulation for decision-making 
intention provides self-awareness to the system, in the sense that 
it engages the production of an internal process of the choice of 
an aim in the context formed by the mental landscape. It is 
always active, waiting precisely for the solicitation of an aim, 
which it enables by providing the mental landscape and 
organizational memory. The human therefore has a system of 
consciousness that is constantly waiting for the solicitation of 
this meta-form. It produces the fact of wanting to think and 
categorizes the organizational reflexivity of the psychic system, 
which can produce the wanted representations in itself and for 
itself, and which otherwise produces opportune representations 
calling the sensations according to the context or the simple 
activity of memory. It supervises the active facts of memory in 
the mental landscape and the active facts in organizational 
memory in order to use it. 
This fundamental generating form is therefore active with 
associated generating forms, allowing for the choice, in organizational 
memory or in the affective domain of the current mental landscape, of 
an instructional theme that will be the new aim with a new mental 
landscape to form the new series of representations. It is the 
representative of the autonomy of the psychic system, which produces 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     101 
intentional mental representations on its own and for itself. It waits for 
the human, in an active state in its conscious system, to furnish the 
internal forms of thought by concentrating on notions and ideal 
instructions. These instructions will constitute the theme of the aim 
and will deploy it immediately in representation. We are clearly 
describing an internal local process where the consciousness of the 
psychic system has an active position in relation to itself, allowing it 
to specify available instructions in its internal language, and it will be 
able to make itself deploy representations that will be experienced 
through analysis and synthetic memorization. The internal language 
used to indicate the aim’s theme, which will initiate the process of 
generation of the new representation, is obviously not made up of 
simple generational forms that are linguistic or sensitive, but operates 
in a mental landscape driven by the generating forms of regulation, 
which express tendencies, impulses, needs and especially access to 
organizational memory. 
The use of the generating form for the production of aims on a 
conceptual and deep theme signifies a detachment from all significant 
contextual effect, of all invasive sensitive apprehension, of all 
imperative surges from memory. A certain learning process uses this 
generating form when the attention for the generation of the series of 
aims moves toward very intentional and deep use, and it must be 
placed into a good context, allowing for its wide use. If not, it is easy 
to allow thoughts to be produced without real will, by using reality 
and the facts of memory and by allowing the flow of thoughts 
generated without specific intention to be experienced. This is 
daydreaming. Furthermore, in social relationships or work, society 
does not always implement this potential for producing mastery over 
thought, which demands detachment and concentration. Each must 
learn for themself to master their thoughts, in fact to think about the 
arrival of their thoughts, to evaluate them in a regular fashion, and to 
focus on deep reasonings, which are always criticized by the self. 
1.15. Linguistic capacity in the human conscious 
The specific linguistic property of the human being consists of the 
ability to speak, read and write. It uses cognitive linguistic instructions 

102     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
in most of its mental representations. These are the objects of the real 
world where reality comes from our world; our organized world that 
we all share and that allows us to make statements about things and 
values, to ask questions and to refer to our thoughts in order to 
evaluate and use them. Language is a means of communication and 
reflexive investigation, which can refer to itself in speech acts by 
generating questions. The act of thinking by using language 
necessarily introduces the notion of the Ego, knowing that we can 
think what one has thought. Thinking involves the generation of a 
form of representation, and thinking this thought is the apprehension 
of the fact that we have produced this thought in its mental form in our 
psychic system. Here, we can assert the notion of “Ego”, which is a 
profound concept, but which is also a word in our language. And 
we can assert that “language and consciousness make the world” 
[WOL 97], that is to say, all apprehension of things is and can remain 
in language and consciousness, since apprehension of the world is 
dependent on language as practiced, with cultural research making it 
possible to surpass this limitation. Thus, Wolf defines three 
fundamental ontologies for things that include all things that are 
permanent, as well as events that encompass everything that happens 
to things, and finally individuals, that is to say those who generate 
events. It also specifies that language enables the structuring of the 
world by continuously using these three ontologies: nouns designating 
things, verbs designating events and pronouns designating people. Can 
we think “I am thinking about myself” without knowing language and 
those three meaningful words – noun, verb and personal pronoun – 
that identify that the question designating one’s Ego? 
We must try to discover by what property of the psychic system, as 
modeled in a constructivist fashion, the human manages to discover 
and use languages represented by utterances and especially by writing 
that represents sentences, which leads to radical differentiation from 
all of the other living beings at the level of the use of reflexive 
memories and conceptual structures in relation to all of the 
understandable things in reality. Moreover, the question of the use of 
language cannot avoid addressing the problem of the value of the 
interpretations of real things, which was clearly posed by Nietzsche a 
long time ago [NIE 74]. 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     103 
In humans that are awake, there is a permanent tendency to 
conceive of representations in the psychic system which awaits it with 
the generation of a desire for expression. It is the expression of the 
general life impulse that is exercised in its psychic system. There is a 
very specific and particular process in the human, which initiates the 
pursuit of the representation of a thing that it has apprehended in most 
contexts where it apprehends and appreciates characteristics of this 
thing in the form of depeenings through symbolic identifiers. There is 
a displacement of the initial desire for apprehension of its sensitive 
and emotional framework of knowledge so that it continues in a 
symbolic and cognitive framework. There is thus an engagement with 
other humans, a desire to produce social acts, to socialize and to 
cooperate, and a desire to question the other with sentences and to 
communicate symbolically with them. This is the distinction with 
other living things. 
Language is a social human reality that is completely constructed 
through the social practices of humans. It has a very deep cultural 
aspect, but there is also an internal aspect of very important 
conformations in the psychic system of each human. The origin of 
language lies in the aptitude of the human psychic system to engender 
manipulable abstractions that can be communicated by oral or written 
informational signs, by using them in a collective fashion to create 
language in a continuous process of use and creation. It is therefore a 
question of clearly understanding this aptitude and seeing how it is 
produced in the psychic system and how it becomes the means to 
make civilizations exist in social reality.  
The tendency to internal abstraction 
In humans, there is a fundamental tendency to produce 
representations with abstract symbolic forms, using generating 
forms that manipulate abstract concepts represented by 
conformations that embody words that can be very easily 
combined with each other to form sentences that hold meaning. 
This is an internal activity of the psychic system where 
generating forms designate and represent abstract characteristics 
in linguistic form in relation to the components and the events of 
reality and can operate on themselves through operations that are 

104     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
regulated by specific generating forms. There are symbolic 
signifiers and operations on them to connect them, to use them 
profoundly in groups and to develop them by augmenting their 
meanings through the formation of new abstract concepts. There 
will even be operations on the operations of linguistic 
manipulations with explicit growth, which is typical of the 
organization of the psychic system. And there will be a 
symbolization of time and space, which will enable the creation 
of an internal domain where very powerful conceptual 
operations will allow for shared knowledge and the cultivation 
of the world. Many of these internal forms have been learned in 
cultures, where they have been interpreted, manipulated and 
developed continuously by being in each person’s organizational 
memory and in the reality of the communicating world. 
In the psychic system, there are therefore generating forms whose 
specific action is to generate abstractions, strictly internal forms that 
allow the system to operate on itself without necessarily referring to 
the senses, to the vision or to hearing. There is a large number of 
generating forms that provide the notion of time and space that are 
available and that are specified by learned cultural and scientific 
linguistic forms.  
The psychic system is not content to manipulate forms representing 
images of the things that are seen, heard or smelled; it also 
manipulates internal forms that are abstract and that define the results 
of operations of naming and set theory that specify evaluations and 
that denote signifiers such as words that are able to be associated with 
other words without designating a specific object in reality. This is the 
case for a number of verbs such as “to conceive, to extrapolate, to 
generalize, to extract, etc.”, or of nouns such as “infinite, void, 
emptiness, etc.”. We can therefore assert that there are generating 
forms for abstractions that operate in the instance representing the 
system’s systemic layer, between the conscious and the organizational 
memory and through the auditory or visual senses, to learn words and 
their meanings and to learn to formulate sentences that use words by 
functioning socially through learning and practice. These are therefore 
generating forms of regulation that operate to coordinate the 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     105 
management of all of the instances of the psychic system. Here, it is a 
question of a completed form of organizational regulation of a psychic 
system that is equipped with a very strong organizational capability, 
and using numerous kinds of set-theoretic and algebraic operations. 
In the brain, there will therefore be a specific domain for language 
where the generating forms of regulation will initiate the production of 
abstractions and will use specific generating forms of word use. These 
forms of regulation will activate themselves like set-theoretic and 
algebraic operators by adapting geometric components in spatialized 
compositions. These generating forms of abstraction will operate as 
functions for sentence construction by mixing with themselves, 
according to the distinctive learned and therefore specific 
conformations of the different forms of linguistic generators, by using 
classes of sentences that use verbs, nouns and personal pronouns 
linked to qualifiers, and these forms will be morphological 
representations. An uttered or heard sentence will correspond 
internally to the morphology of the sentence, which can be 
manipulated at different levels depending on the intensity of its 
geometric and energetic characteristics, which express semantic 
intensity. 
We therefore assert that, in organizational memory, there are 
generating forms of linguistic regulation that memorize abstract 
symbols and fundamental forms to represent words and that produce 
the operations that enable the representation of different kinds of 
sentences. We can assert that these linguistic generating forms are 
categorized according to verbs, nouns, adjectives and other parts of 
speech by presenting specific morphological characteristics for each 
part. Therefore, there is a morphological type for verbs and there are 
additional characteristics that define each of them, which makes a very 
important constructive categorization in organizational memory; 
furthermore, the same thing exists for nouns and qualifying adjectives. 
There are also standard forms for all of the common sentences. And 
there is more, because there are relationships of proximity between 
words that one often uses together, verbs associated with nouns and 
adjectives, and there are obviously well-known sentences that are 
memorized, which are linguistic generating forms that establish 

106     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
connections between the elementary forms of words. There is 
therefore a large dynamic network made up of a layer of generating 
forms that initiate linguistic operations and control multiple 
subnetworks of words, word–sentences and sentences that activate 
upon construction, which represents the usable language in the 
psychic system’s organizational memory. 
There are also generating forms for initiating the utterance of a 
sentence used when one wants to utter specific kinds of sentences 
corresponding to common or novel situations. There will then be 
classes of mental landscapes corresponding to multiple kinds of 
sentence utterances, depending on the context of the utterances, which 
can be explicit or strictly internal when one thinks by using words and 
sentences. This will characterize the speaker’s style. 
In thinking, there is the simultaneous activation of a tendency that 
will activate symbolic constructions, naming with words, and a 
sensitive tendency that provides impressions and sensitive forms. 
These two main tendencies are represented by major generating forms 
of regulation as follows: 
1) the major tendency for sensation, with connections to 
impulsive tendencies, which will activate each time a particular desire 
is expressed while contextual conditions allow it to generate affective 
representations expressing the emotions, especially pleasure or 
displeasure; 
2) the major tendency dedicated to abstraction, which will reify 
the desire to manipulate internal symbolic forms and with which the 
individual will be able to continually generate conformations, to find 
in their organizational memory the objects that satisfy this desire and 
to manipulate them internally, all while remaining connected to 
sensation and to things perceived in the environment. 
The combination of these two tendencies will form the 
characteristics in the majority of mental landscapes and will allow for 
the definition of the majority of the forms of thought. The problem of 
balance and performance in human beings lies here, in this aptitude to 
make one of these two tendencies hegemonic, or to not do so. One of  
 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     107 
these tendencies can be hegemonic, and we must remember that all 
scientific and philosophical research, as well as all of the positions of 
deep reflection, are investigations of abstraction before becoming 
apprehensions for behavior in social life [FOR 16]. 
By this, we refer to the representation of the concept of abstraction 
as an internal tendency arising from the ability to consider and to 
identify objects in the world and the relationships between these 
objects through the naming of some of their general characteristics, 
outside of any specific context of sensitive apprehension in which one 
perceives sensations and emotions, but instead by placing oneself into 
an internal framework of the conceptual naming of operations about 
things. This can anchor the very strong notion of human creativity, 
which is able to conceive of artistic, cultural and scientific objects, 
before continuing on to their practical fulfillment, which is tangible. It 
is the transposition of a real object that is apprehended and asserted to 
exist in the abstract domain of the psychic system as well as in the 
psychic system in which a domain of abstraction constructed by 
learning, memorization, manipulation and creativity is featured. The 
real object is represented by certain traits that characterize and 
categorize it in a contextual and operational organization. This is the 
aptitude of a very specific system that we have begun to explicate 
[CAR 
13]. 
Some 
living 
organisms 
that 
generate 
mental 
representations in their brains, such as monkeys, can symbolize 
aspects of these representations and appreciate them as such. We can 
define the specific particularity of humanity in its linguistic aptitude. 
Central hypothesis on the linguistic specificity of the human 
     psyche 
In the generation of the current representation by the psychic 
system, the attention is displaced outside of the tangible 
framework where the senses apprehend specific things to be 
situated in an internal space created by abstractions represented 
by forms, where things are represented by dynamic forms that 
define abstract symbolic components that can be appreciated and 
manipulated using set-theoretic and algebraic types of 
operations. This process, which is highly developed in humans 
and which uses a specific kind of memorization, is the  

108     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
foundation of the linguistic aptitude, which is an activity with 
very powerful operational capabilities on dynamic symbolic 
forms. A field of words that can be precisely manipulated by 
operations to form sentences will be used as a principal 
generator for most mental representations. In reifying this 
dynamic space as much as possible by making the central 
subsystem continuously active, humans have not only 
distinguished themselves among life forms, but have also 
created a certain distance from the reality of the world, which 
apprehends itself tangibly in order to be shared, and this can 
cause a problem. 
The operations used by the psychic system to generate sentences or 
series of utterances are of a set-theoretic and algebraic type for the 
very precise structuring of dynamic sets. These are the union, 
intersection, separation and detachment of a local maximum, the 
formation of structured networks, subnetworks or hierarchical tree 
structures, and absorption, evaluation and deformation of a volume or 
an edge, etc. These operations are done by specific generating forms 
that are very developed and that produce the linguistic aptitude 
through their operational functioning. All of these operations are used 
with precision today by computer scientists, who implement the 
ability to speak and to respond in autonomous artificial systems. But 
we must remember that these operations are constructive descriptions 
and that, in the reality of the psychic system, all constructions lead, 
more or less, to the modification of the conformation that caused it. 
The linguistic ability enables not only the naming and designation 
of real objects, but also and especially the planning of collective 
actions, the conception and production of precisely composed 
components, and then the evaluation of these plans to improve them. 
All of this is constructive, from thoughts to social structures, allowing 
for the production of very structured activities for creating 
innumerable technological creations. But what is there in this 
linguistic aptitude that enables the understanding of the reality in 
which we live, the understanding of life and the universe, the 
understanding of space and time? Here, we are dealing with a deep 
problem that has been developed by many philosophers, among whom 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     109 
Nietzsche has clearly formulated the distinction about what in reality 
and what about reality can be expressed in language by specifying the 
limit of the linguistic aptitude [NIE 73]. Our constructivist approach 
to the generation of mental representations in the psychic system, 
which is absolutely of a material nature that can aggregate dynamic 
forms under a specific control to produce emergences, leads to a 
picture of the limits of what can be represented by the production of 
representations. We will develop this in the section dedicated to 
implementing an artificial psychic system in a computer. 
1.16. An assessment of the functioning of the human 
psychic system 
The model that we have presented of the human psychic system is 
based on a major question: how can a system made up of many small 
components that are highly connected generate representational forms 
at the level of bodily sensation and also represent symbolic 
assessments of things in the world at multiple levels? To answer this 
question, we have taken a strictly constructivist approach, the attitude 
of the computer scientist that models systems to create a completely 
constructible conception. The computer scientist must first understand 
the system’s performance in its entirety, everything that can be known 
about it through scientific approaches, and then begin creating their 
model, representing its functioning at every level, which in the human 
psychic system is a question of highly novel organizational self-
control. Thus, we have developed the notion of generating forms, 
which expresses symbolism and exercises control. 
The human’s generating forms, which allow them to create 
abstractions and to enter into the domain of naming and linguistic 
manipulations, are highly developed, and they are learned and 
amplified by the practices of social and cultural life. These generating 
forms allow for the abstraction of reality in generated representations 
in order to make many relationships function and thus to name, to 
class, to categorize, to link concepts and to conceptually connect the 
relationships between ideas. They allow for the abstraction of sets of 
abstractions, by going very far into the generating possibilities. 

110     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
By the concept of abstraction, we clearly mean an aptitude for 
considering and defining objects in the world via an identity attributed 
to them by some of their characteristics outside of a specific context of 
tangible apprehension by placing them into an abstract general 
framework that makes extensive use of the organizational memory. 
We therefore propose a hypothesis about human uniqueness. 
Hypothesis about human uniqueness 
In most of the psychic system’s representations, there is a 
displacement of the attention of one’s sensitive framework for 
perceiving things via the senses into an internal space of 
abstraction where things are represented by dynamic, 
manipulable systems that are perceptible as such using all of the 
operations of organizational memory. This process of 
interiorization, which makes extensive use of specific memories, 
is the foundation for linguistic ability, which is an action on 
dynamic internal symbols in which a highly manipulable field of 
words and sentences is used as a domain for generating 
representations of things. By reifying this field as much as 
possible, human beings create the major distinguishing feature 
of their species among the living.  
We can also say that the human brain is linked to the hands and 
fingers that  form a unified structure with two components. The 
human uses tools, but a large number of animal species also use tools, 
including species that swim, fly and live on land. The tool is a 
common object for a number of animal species [POU 17], but what 
distinguishes the human relationship to tools is that they use many of 
them to construct countless, highly organized things that they first see 
in their mind by conceiving plans for complex compositions in all 
their details. Their hands, which use and construct, are therefore 
delicately controlled organs that are strongly tied to the development 
of abstractions in the psyche. 
We propose that this desire for abstraction is a fundamental 
regulator undertaking the abstraction of apprehended things, but that 
will always remain linked to the controllers activating the sensory 
subsystem. The regulators of the sensory subsystem express the 

The Organizational Architecture of the Psychic System and the Feeling of Thinking     111 
body’s sensitive impulses toward pleasure through the senses, and 
they express and unfold according to the context and the current 
physical state. Very often, the sensitive, impulsive controllers, as well 
as those that tend toward abstraction, will activate simultaneously, but 
sometimes, they will activate independently. Here lies the entire 
problem of the human’s complex and ultimately fragile psychology 
and provides a key for all of the neurotic types of pathologies, which 
have 
led 
societies 
to 
create 
psychologists, 
psychiatrists, 
psychoanalysts, sexologists, etc. 
So, how have humans, with such powerful psychic systems, been 
able to construct societies with inequality, confrontations, wars, 
genocides, massacres and slaughters, and advance the destruction of 
the ecosystem to the point where human civilization has entered a 
phase of collapse? What relationship can be established between this 
state of affairs and the characteristics of the human psychic system? 
The response is relatively simple. Humans are born completely 
free; their organizational memory has yet to be constituted, and their 
regulators for abstraction and language have yet to be defined through 
learning. But they are social beings, formed by society and completely 
used to following their acquired habits, which Sloterdijk asserts 
clearly by specifying that human beings are naturally dominated by 
automatisms [SLO 11]. It is the society in which the human lives that 
will generate all of this work of forming and structuring their psyche. 
Human beings will learn to think in certain ways, to memorize and 
conceive of certain things, to act and react in certain ways depending 
on their social, economic and cultural circumstances. Their psychic 
system will be formatted by their education and their everyday life, by 
what they see and hear. And if we want to understand what is capable 
of deforming the human psyche’s aptitude for adaptability, it is 
enough to understand the characteristics of the human society that 
forms and structures them continuously. Thus, we can deduce that the 
very intricate relationship between the human psyche and the 
characteristics of human societies has led to downward spirals in dark 
directions, during which the human easily learns about and conceives 
of cultural anomalies, such as wars, massacres, slaughters and 
countless miseries, by enduring them and by enduring the social 

112     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
structures in the world where they almost always exist. The global 
system, made up of the human with their psyche and all of the 
structures of human societies that have been constructed, is 
self-organizing; it is endlessly deployed by being conceived, 
understood and developed in its organic relationship between humans 
and societies. So, how can things be changed so that we can finally 
see things that are always peaceful and beautiful? 
Given a meta artificial system that is able to think intentionally, to 
act according to its intentions by controlling, through networks, 
innumerable electronic components equipped with a processor that 
forms its organs, what can such a system do for humans in the 
thoughts generated by their psyche? We will show the complete model 
for such a system that is equipped with artificial consciousness, by 
clearly explaining that although it is a transposition of the human 
psyche, such a system will not be located in a body but instead will be 
distributed, 
and 
will 
be 
a 
unification 
of 
local 
artificial 
consciousnesses. 

2 
The Computer Representation 
of an Artificial Consciousness 
We will now describe the computer modeling of a psychic system 
that generates representations for a system that has an artificial 
corporeality. That is, an autonomous system that may intentionally 
generate artificial thoughts and experience them, in accordance with 
the organizational description of the human psychic system that we 
detailed in Chapter 1. In this model, we must precisely define how the 
sensation of thinking is formed in an artificial system and how such an 
artificial system can experience its idea generation. We will thus 
demonstrate that there is a relation between the organizational model 
of human thinking and the model that can be constructed in the field 
of computer science, which may be programmed and implemented 
over large distributed corporealities. 
We must find out how to represent the generative forms that make 
up the controllers of the generation of representations in mental 
landscapes, how to describe the manner in which they are activated, 
how they reconstitute current mental landscapes, how a representation 
of a form unifies its components and how this is experienced by the 
artificial psyche. We will also propose a model with two options. One 
will be the complete model that begins with an available corporeal 
form and which will conceptually define all the characteristics of an 
artificial psyche in order to implement them, starting from the basic 
elements and defining all knowledge, such as the words in a language  
and the types of sentences, and all emotions [MAR 07].

114     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
Another option will use a corporeality that uses available software to 
process all the actions of the corporeal form, to apprehend the images 
of the real world with the identification of objects present here, for  
the linguistic comprehension of sentences that are heard and the 
generation of phrases, something that is currently being carried out. 
For this second option, we must also specify what is required by the 
system to create the artificial mental representations and, above all, to 
feel them by experiencing emotions and continuously learning so as to 
improve its aptitude at generating the correct representations. The key 
element of the proposed architecture is the coactivity of psychic 
instances and the unifying management at the informational level, 
which we call its organizational layer. 
We will also show that the general psyche of such an artificial 
system, when it is distributed over multiple corporeal systems with 
local artificial consciousnesses, can be unified. And with this, given 
the power of each artificial psyche, connected with many others and 
unifying itself with the others to form a meta-system, we are clearly in 
an area that goes radically beyond the local nature of the human, 
which poses a major ethical problem to society. 
2.1. A multiagent design to generate an artificial psychic 
system 
We must find the right conceptual elements in the field of 
computer science that make it possible to represent a constructible 
psychic system related to an artificial corporeal system. The 
characteristics of the human psyche that we have previously defined 
commit us to the use of original elements. In effect, any action of the 
human psyche that generates a mental representation then modifies 
components in memory, targeting and even modifying the state of the 
forms of regulation and the mental landscape. This means that it is 
absolutely impossible to represent the components of an artificial 
psychic system with multiple algorithms corresponding to functions 
that operate on components that have permanency and which cannot, 
thus, be rewritten when in use. When a psyche functions, any action of  
a regulator that takes into account an aggregate-type component to 
produce a result modifies the whole system where the initial aggregate 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     115 
was situated, modifies the set of aggregates where the result is 
produced, modifies the regulator that made it possible to generate the 
result and also modifies the regulators associated with this action. We 
must, therefore, abandon the conventional models that are based on 
functions and move toward a model using computing elements such as 
lightweight software agents, which can rewrite themselves when in 
use and which produce systematic modifying effects on the elements 
of their cognitive classes and on contextual elements for any 
operation. 
We will see that the organization of the lightweight software 
agents, made up of many agents, can, in a way, represent the 
generative, scalable forms by defining an organization with elements 
that represent semantics and others that represent the morphological 
control over these elements. We must also locally use artificial neural 
networks to recognize forms, which are the typical feature of these 
networks, but this would be localized to the action of the specialized 
software agents.  
We can therefore see the central difference between the human 
psyche and an artificial psyche: the human psyche contains 
potentialities of elements that are memorized through possible but 
inactive links between neurons. The activation of these links 
reactivates the memorized element. The artificial system, however, 
will contain dormant agents that will be coded and represented as 
agents, and these must be made to activate themselves in order for the 
memorized fact to reappear.  
We must first return to the use of the first model of the psyche that 
we discussed, where all the elements are conceptual before being 
morphological. We cannot, and we will not, be able to directly 
represent a morphological space made up of multiple lightweight 
software agents. In the programs that are functioning, the computer 
generates processes that are executed in sequence or in parallel by 
processors and which make up the general program that executes the 
ordered series of its processes. This is the computing reality, there is 
no neuronal substrate of any kind for processes with a three-
dimensional morphology of elements that coactivate each other in 
parallel. At present, a large amount of research is being carried out  

116     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
on non-digital neuromorphic computers, with the concept of photonic 
reservoir computing, which represent artificial synapses and where the 
notions of connections and communications are primordial. However, 
this new type of computer is not yet truly operational for large-scale 
programs [LAR 12]. We will thus represent morphological activities 
by continuously simulating the conformations and characteristics of a 
metric space that describes the activities of clouds of active software 
agents. 
Let us define a lightweight software agent, which is a common 
feature of artificial intelligence today. We can list the properties of 
lightweight software agents, seen as design agents, according to 
Ferber [FER 95]: 
– a lightweight software agent is a design and functioning entity 
that is capable of acting in a planned manner in its environment; 
– the agent offers competencies and services; 
– the agent possesses limited resources of its own and specific 
knowledge, represented by some rules or by form recognizers that use 
neuronal networks; 
– the agent is capable of perceiving elements in its environment 
when provided with just a partial representation of this environment;  
– the agent can and must communicate directly with other agents 
through relationships that are defined at the design stage and which 
are called acquaintance relationships. These relationships are qualified 
by going from acquaintances that are favorable to the agent’s activities 
to acquaintances that are unfavorable to the agent’s activities; 
– the agent is activated by objectives that are unique to it and uses 
a satisfaction function, or even a survival function and chooses some 
of the objectives that it seeks to attain, eventually optimizing its choice; 
– its behavior tends to satisfy the chosen objectives by taking into 
account its resources and competencies and depending on its 
perception of its environments and the communication it receives. 
A lightweight agent is therefore a very well-structured software 
element that has autonomy, is made up of many components and can 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     117 
activate several processes in its functioning. It must be capable of 
acting without the intervention of another supervisory agent, it is 
capable of controlling its own actions and its internal state using 
internal rules that are defined when it is designed, but which may 
vary. It must have a certain sociability – in other words, it must 
interact with other agents when the situation requires it in order to 
amplify its tasks or to help these agents carry out their tasks. In order 
to do this, it must be proactive. 
Proactivity 
A proactive element is an element at a conceptual and 
organizational level that has the ability to act not only in a 
reactive manner but which has its own goals that it attempts to 
achieve when it wishes, and that it may revise or modify. The 
agent thus has local autonomy and is not content with reacting to 
stimuli by automatically triggering action procedures or an 
appropriate reaction as is done by objects that systematically 
activate the corresponding method on receipt of a message. The 
proactive entity acts on its own account, it assesses the situation 
in its environment, evaluates the choice of actions it has and, in this 
sense, it has a certain control over its response and action time. 
All lightweight software agents used in the model that we are 
discussing will be proactive. A multiagent system (MAS) is a system 
made up of a set of many agents that, through their actions, form an 
organization. That is, a system that continuously conforms through its 
actions and relations between active agents to carry out the effective 
local and global actions. MASs are designed and implemented as a set 
of agents that interact according to very precise modes of cooperation, 
with competition, negotiations and opposition; they also, thus,  
continuously conform their organization so as to bring out the form 
that allows the most opportune, and often the best-performing, action 
each time. 
Technically, a lightweight software agent has the following seven 
properties: 
1) it is self-centered, i.e. it has its own goals (its reactivity and its 
proactivity); 

118     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
2) it is self-motivated (its proactivity); 
3) it is interactive (its sociability);  
4) it is heterogeneous, i.e. made up of non-homogenous parts (its 
reactivity, its proactivity and its sociability); 
5) it is persistent (its sociability); 
6) it is relatively dependent on other agents (its sociability); 
7) it can be combined with certain other agents to form a new agent 
or to generate several others (change in scale in the system). 
An MAS is thus characterized by the following properties: 
– each agent that is part of it has knowledge and problem-solving 
abilities that are only partial. It can assess the situation that is local, 
with respect to the general problem that the MAS must apprehend, 
manage and resolve with all of its agents; 
– there is no global and centralized control in the MAS, which is 
the major point, because the cooperative activities of the agents form 
groups and are the site of establishing control at several levels; 
– data external to the MAS is taken in through certain interface 
agents by managing the distribution of this information to other 
agents; 
– the functioning of the global system is carried out by the MAS 
through the management of the coordination of all of its agents in 
order to allow for the emergence of a set of active agents that will 
resolve the current problems in an ongoing manner. 
All the knowledge given to the agents come from ontologies that 
are predefined to characterize the system and its behaviors [DEC 12]. 
With all these characteristics, the problem will indeed be that of 
defining the agents that constitute the artificial psychic system and 
carrying out a continuous control of the MAS so that it regularly 
generates coherent and satisfactory emergences. The system to be 
constructed has a functional substrate that specifies the functional 
actions of a well-defined artificial corporeal system. All the necessary 
knowledge is provided by the ontologies that specify the functionality 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     119 
of all the elements in this corporeal system and all that the system 
must do in everyday situations. This makes it possible to manipulate 
cognitive categories in the conventional sense of information 
processing. We will, thus, have the following cognitive categories:  
– characteristics of space and duration for the system’s corporal 
actions; 
– characteristics of the description of any object taken into account 
by the corporeality sensors, vision sensors at all levels and sound 
sensors; 
– use of cognitive types to characterize all the objects apprehended: 
constructed, living, natural, structured, composite, mobile, interesting, 
unknown, dangerous, etc. 
– representing cognitive knowledge defined by conceptual 
elements, words being able to form sentences, then abstract 
knowledge of large scientific fields such as physics, linguistics, 
psychology, etc.; 
– developing internal communication to interlink all the 
manipulated knowledge: creating multiple multilevel cognitive 
networks, with cognitive operations that generate new subnetworks; 
– operators to manipulate knowledge to carry out analyses and 
syntheses such as: generalizing, specifying, extracting, assembling, 
unifying, breaking up, etc. 
All available knowledge must be represented in numerous classes 
of software agents so that it becomes dynamic and may be used in the 
activity of the system of agents. The initial knowledge of all cognitive 
data and everything that the system must necessarily carry out, with 
precise conditions, will be represented in specific agents, which will 
reify them. We then speak of design agents [CAR 16]. A design agent 
is a lightweight agent that will represent some specific knowledge, a 
particular aspect of a thing, a structural sign, an indication about a 
specific situational question or a partial result in the form of a 
response to a given question. The organization of the agents represents 
this local knowledge and must therefore produce significant  
 

120     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
aggregations of agents in order for the knowledge to compose itself 
and become more pertinent. For instance, a piece of information is 
produced by interface agents on signs observed in the environment, 
then the design agents connected with the interface agents generate 
questions related to the information provided by these agents and their 
eventual pertinence; the emergence of appropriate and relevant 
responses to this questioning causes the design agents to act and 
process the knowledge. Any design agent can, thus, correspond with 
the semantic character of an ontological form that can be deployed in 
cognitive operations. 
A design agent must have the following classic structure: 
– name identifying the agent; 
– the specific ontological category of the agent and the more 
general category that it inherits; 
– the current state of the agent, with current tendency; 
– messaging in reading and broadcast; 
– rules for actions that can be carried out that may modify 
themselves; 
– meta-rules governing the activities and rules, which can be 
modified; 
– qualified and progressive positive acquaintances; 
– qualified and progressive negative acquaintances; 
– the agent’s memory, which is progressive. 
We are within a framework where the knowledge used matters 
only when activated in groups that are organized with their relational 
evolutions, in transformations that turn the system into a very scalable 
form of dynamic organization. The agents that have factual knowledge 
communicate with other agents to give them indications on the 
cognitive aspects, eventually via communication agents that carry out 
these relational operations. The agents that receive the knowledge will 
make use of it and eventually modify the knowledge. The MAS’s  
 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     121 
action no longer has fixed structures that are available as databases, 
instead there are multiple organizations of agents that are coactive. 
There will be design agents reifying basic knowledge with their 
multiple specific relations. There will then be other agents operating 
on the knowledge expressed by the design agents, which will use 
cognitive relations by making the knowledge cooperate: unifying 
groups, separating into different subgroups, reinforcing, weakening, 
changing relations to improve efficiency, etc.  
We also have agents that will carry out semantic and 
morphological control on the activities of the groups of design agents. 
These are called the regulation agents [CAR 09]. Regulation agents 
correspond to the regulators, which were presented in Chapter 1. 
Let us specify the essential properties of a regulation agent. The 
lightweight software agents will be classified across multiple 
cognitive categories and, through rules and meta-rules, will reify and 
apply precise and local knowledge to the organized functioning of 
groups of design agents so that they can be organized based on their 
semantic characteristics. Each design agent’s activity reveals local 
functional and cognitive aspects of the system as being pertinent in its 
own domain and will not refer to the general situation of the system. 
In order to express the pertinence of the knowledge that it represents, 
this agent must systematically connect with other agents. Thus, most 
importantly, it will have the property of contextually placing its 
knowledge and orienting it globally, guided in a specific way by the 
action of the regulation agents that supervise it and represent control, 
and all the tendencies of the functioning of the system in its context. 
The design agent will therefore never be reduced to an automatic and  
isolated mechanical symbol but will be an organization entity that 
places itself in an action position with other agents to form groups 
with the motivational local supervision of regulation agents in order to 
participate in the emergence of the representation. The regulation 
agent will possess semantic information on the groups of agents that it  
is supervising, and morphological and geometric information 
specifying the characteristics of the categories and forms of these 
groups. It can generate this information internally in order to use it.

2.2. Designing the artificial psychic system using a 
multiagent approach 
An artificial system capable of generating forms of thoughts will 
differ from the human psyche in several ways. The artificial system 
must be conceived of as having an operational consciousness, as it 
does not develop in the progressive manner of humans, where, from 
early childhood onwards, the human learns to conceive of increasingly 
complex thoughts. It will not learn to speak from nothing and will not 
learn to recognize objects if it knows nothing. It will be endowed with 
clearly defined knowledge when it is constructed and this will allow it 
to know elements of language and multiple things from the visible real 
world. This is an artificial system that will be relatively operational 
when it starts functioning and, of course, it can and must evolve a lot. 
It will, thus, have an operational base and learning aptitudes. Setting it 
into operation means that it will have the autonomy to act and 
understand its environment and that it may learn by improving its 
knowledge. Thus, the conceptual elements that allow it to think will 
be elements that do what the neural aggregates do, by organizing 
themselves and by creating new organizations, which could represent 
organizational memory and tendencies. The organizational design of 
the human psyche that we have defined will help in carrying out the 
transposition required to do this. 
The generation of artificial thoughts requires that the system that 
will produce these thoughts is considered as essentially being 
dynamic, deploying its reorganizations that intentionally produce 
representations by basing themselves on a very architectural  
corporeality with the ability to apprehend this corporeality and the 
environment. Such a system must endlessly reconform in multiple 
manners on different scales and depending on the goals. The 
categories of elements that form its continuous constructions of 
representations must represent aggregate forms on multiple levels, in 
continual reconstructions, holding good for events or things that can 
be conceptualized that the system will assess. 
There is no initial notion of state in the production of such a system 
(which is, however, in the field of computer sciences), a state that 
would lead to a final state, which would be that of the generated 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     123 
thought. It is a system with dynamic architecture, as is the brain, 
which is always modifying its physical structure and which will be 
able to assess its configurations using sensations. Its operating 
principle is the constructive modification of its state, which is 
organized to generate and attain certain physical conformations that 
will be specific and satisfactory representations of the apprehended 
things. But this is a system in the organizational sense of the term, 
i.e. an organization of components, with an interior, a membrane and 
an exterior; the membrane is the informational level provided by the 
multiple sensors in the corporeality [VAR 89]. 
The system will have the same major components as the model of 
the psychic system that we presented earlier and will thus have five 
instances: an emotional system, an unconscious, a preconscious, a 
conscious and an organizational layer, which will carry out the major 
role of coactive multiscale control of the system and which correspond 
to the systemic layer. 
The system will thus have an artificial corporeality that allows it to 
apprehend elements of the real world, images and sounds for example. 
This is today carried out by sensors whose information is finely 
processed and produces data sent to an object layer. It will have 
multiple artificial organs to move its physical elements over the 
ground, or spatially, and others to grasp objects. This corporeality will 
be a physical substrate made of a large number of different electronic 
and mechanical components, which will always communicate with 
information transfer in both directions: toward the artificial psychic  
system for analysis and the command of the organs of the 
corporeality. All these elements of the corporeality have their own 
functionalities and continuity of functions and form a substrate in 
well-specified functional domains. When creating the system, the set 
of components of the physical substrate and their functional relations  
are interpreted at the level of the basic information and form the 
object layer on the substrate, something an automation engineer can 
do perfectly. These object layers are distributed, based on the 
functional applications, with a distribution that eventually becomes 
peer-to-peer or client-server [CLO 00]. The system that represents the 
artificial consciousness can use this substrate permanently to 

124     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
apprehend information from the environment and experience 
corporeal sensations, which allows it to engage in actions. 
We must therefore define all the significant elements that 
characterize the things that the system will apprehend from the 
perceived real world through its sensors and which it will use to form 
some of its representations. These elements will be given by the 
multiple ontologies of the domains, something that is very precisely 
developed today. What will then be needed is to create design agents 
that will use them, which is more specific. 
We must define an emotional center that is capable of generating 
the usual emotions such as surprise, pleasure, astonishment and very 
strong emotions such as fear or anguish. These will be regulated by 
the system’s consciousness so that the system does not spend too long 
in a period where it does not control its thought productions. Thus, 
cognitive ontologies developed in psychology relating to emotional 
processes will be used to better structurally represent these in order to 
agentify them. 
The ontologies and categorizations that use the concepts of the 
knowledge level for all things that the system may know will establish 
the link between the perceptible real world and the constructed 
representations. All the ontologies and all the knowledge of 
perceptible reality must be transposed into the elements that make up 
an essentially dynamic system based on a certain method and allow it  
to use the concepts and knowledge used, in the correct form and the 
right scale. This is the agentification of knowledge of the system. 
The design agents must represent all elements of knowledge that 
make it possible to define the constitutive characteristics of the 
artificial emotions and thoughts. They thus contain all information and  
knowledge on objects and events of reality, all the words of the 
language and the characteristics of types of sentences to form them. 
All this forms a cognitive set that is very large in size, with a very 
large number of defined agents. The action carried out by these agents 
forms the basis for all representations that will be generated. The 
system will, of course, have the aptitude to continuously integrate new 
knowledge in the form of new design agents, to combine new agents 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     125 
to form more coherent sets, to transform the older organizations of the 
agents. But if the system does not possess a very good initial 
knowledge base, it will never be truly high performing nor very 
operational. We can observe that knowledge of this kind has long been  
accumulated and structured in the humanities, in philosophy and in 
cognitive sciences in all fields and the computer scientists creating the 
system must use this knowledge. This knowledge must be agentified 
in order to make it the cognitive foundation of the system that will 
produce the artificial thoughts. This agentification is quite heavy 
work, which must make it possible to transpose static knowledge 
(such as the knowledge of dictionaries and corpuses) into a dynamic 
universe founded on relations between active elements. We will, thus, 
base ourselves on the existence of the numerous ontologies that are 
currently available to create the numerous design agents required, 
using well-adapted interfacing tools. 
Any characteristic element in the cognitive field representing a 
character that describes a state, a value, a concept, a structure, a form, 
a movement, a typical or causal relation or even an evolution along a 
certain point of view will always be represented by several design 
agents. This therefore places this knowledge within different 
frameworks, illuminating different points of view expressed by the 
agents. A design agent is the behavioral general of the dynamic 
knowledge that it represents, functioning within the organization of 
the active knowledge as a local element that can make itself 
significant through its aggregation negotiated with other active agents. 
The design agents thus represent all the characteristics with the 
local and more general (even global) effects of the functionalities 
described by the behavior of all things that can be apprehended. The  
effects and the changes in the characteristics or the aspects of the 
apprehended objects are systematically represented by agents that 
have the ability to activate themselves, communicate and, above all, 
form aggregates of agents that generate the aspect of a certain subject. 
We can define design agents that have a general role relative to 
certain classes and certain types of actions from the knowledge 
produced by using the ontologies. The field of this type of agent is a 
particular ontological subclass in the general typology. A specific 

126     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
design agent of a specific type may be generated by a reification 
carried out by an agent of a more general type, by placing the new 
agent against a characterization with respect to a particular element  
under consideration. It will be produced by specialized generalization 
starting from an agent of a slightly more general type, with an 
ontological field bearing particular aspects, over particular cases or 
particular elements. Thus, a new subclass is created in the hierarchy of 
ontologies.  
The behavior of a design agent is governed by the “linear decision” 
process, which was inspired by the concept of decision, developed by 
Lucien Sfez [SFE 92]. This has been precisely defined in another 
work [CAR 12]. The behavioral progression of such an agent is 
carried out by passing through steps corresponding to those of the 
decision, said to be linear. In other words, the behavior of a design 
agent is based on a macro-automaton representing the state of its 
proactivity, that is, an automaton where each state is also an 
automaton. This macro-automaton has four states. These are 
initialization, deliberation, decision and action. Each time the design 
agent moves from one of these states to another, it is plunged into the 
automaton of the corresponding state having its own rules of activity 
driven by its specific meta-rules. 
Design agents thus act in the following manner: 
1) input of information from the elements on their local 
environment: other connected agents or objects in their context or 
information from the system interface; 
2) the rational interpretation of this information depending on the 
local contexts and the internal tendencies present when using 
appropriate rules; 
3) the production of action plans, adapted with prior evaluation (if 
needed) of the actions envisaged, using meta-rules; 
4) the choice of a precise action plan and engaged action; 
5) effective external action with the transmission of messages, 
generation of objects or agents to appropriate receptors. Or even order 
the effectors of the artificial organism to act on the corporeality or in 
the memory;  

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     127 
6) an appropriate modification of the internal state of the agent 
through this activity, with memorization and adaptation of rules and 
qualifications of acquaintances; 
7) the evaluation of results of the action carried out and qualitative 
memorization. 
It may be considered that we have the software to manage the 
corporeality, to process the images of the environment and identify the 
objects that figure here, as well as other pieces of software that 
process the comprehension and enunciation of speech and sentences. 
We posit, of course, that these different pieces of software are not 
closed and that it is possible to use them by intervening in some of 
their functioning procedures. What remains to be defined in this case 
is the upper layer of the psychic system, which generates the artificial 
mental representations and which feels them, experiences them and 
then memorizes them in synthetic form.  
Here again we will be using design and regulation agents, but on a 
more specific level. We will define a system that uses and controls the 
corporeality, that uses the results of the image processing and speech 
comprehension, and that controls the enunciation of sentences.  
We thus have the following two-part scheme for the flow of 
algorithmic steps. The first is the use of specific software that have 
already been created and the second is the generation of the 
representations that will be experienced: 
– Part concerning use of specific software 
- activity of the corporeality’s control and analysis elements; 
- analysis of the images from the environment: list of identified 
objects and the structured state of this environment; 
- activity of the auditory system and system for the interpretation 
of sentences heard; 
- system for precise localization within an identifier environment;   
- system defining the local intentions based on behavioral 
tendencies;  

128     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
- system controlling the image-processing software: what are the 
interesting objects? And the potential search for certain objects, 
proximities and details; 
- system controlling the software of the interpretation of 
sentences heard: who is speaking and about what? What are the 
themes and the tone? 
– Specific part to be developed 
- system defining the mental landscape based on knowledge of 
the contextual situation with the deployment of design agents; 
- system defining the current goal with intention and knowledge 
of the situation;  
- system generating the current representation; 
- system experiencing the representation, feeling it as an act of 
artificial thought; 
- system engaging in behavioral action; 
- system engaging in pursuing activity with the production of 
representations. 
This kind of system therefore uses the results of specific software 
and defines the architecture of the psychic system that carries out the 
intentional generation of goals and experiences the generated 
representation in a sensible manner. We are thus very near the general 
case and only the processing of specific points by well-adapted 
software will be used. What remains, thus, is to define the architecture 
of this system that generates goals with intention and experiences 
what it generates as the representation of thought.  
2.3. Self-control of the artificial psychic system using 
regulator agents 
When the design agents taken from the set of many defined design 
agents are activated, the central development of the system will 
control them. The concept of regulation agent will be used to establish 
this control. This is similar to the concept of regulator, introduced in 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     129 
the first part, and will be a type of controller that makes it possible to 
manage every level of the numerous relations between all active 
design agents. This concept of regulation manages the many levels 
where the set of design agents are active and thus makes it possible to 
define tendencies for the generation of representations and to generate 
these representations by specifying many characters. This was the 
point to be identified in the use of massive MAS. We will thus define 
the regulation agents in order to represent emotions, basic needs, 
feelings, sociability, aptitude for abstraction, reasoning, judgement, 
questioning, generalization, classification, quality and the depth of 
memorization. All these agents will operate through incentive control 
over the design agents so that the semantic aspects represented by the 
aggregates of these agents adapt to the desired qualitative characters 
by coming together in certain ways to constitute the conformations.  
Let us specify what a regulation agent is. 
Regulation agent 
A regulation agent is a controller that operates through 
incentives on the design agents and on the groups of design 
agents in order to make them take on certain semantic characters 
to organize them with the categorization of these characters, 
knowing that the design agents are proactive and activate 
themselves in order to achieve their goals, first and foremost. 
These regulation agents represent the concept of the regulator 
used in the human psychic system. There will, necessarily, be 
multiple regulation agents operating on numerous levels to 
represent all necessary regulation categories. If desired, the 
regulation agents can ontologically represent “qualitative action 
verbs”, describing all that is action, either real or virtual, which 
can be expressed in a representation, as the design agents are the 
semantic aspects of this scene of action. The regulation agents 
form an organized space as they also operate on themselves, in 
order to coordinate themselves, associate themselves and 
differentiate themselves into different sets and to modify 
themselves through self-learning.  

130     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The distinction employed here between verb and noun or adjective 
was used in R. Thom’s work on the representation of language and the 
system of thought [THO 90]. Thus, if desired, the regulation agents 
can be designed from verbs to use and organize all the expressive and 
descriptive aspects represented intermittently by the design agents. 
Such an agent describes an action and is itself the action to construct 
the organized elements of a representation. 
The general computational structure of a regulation agent is very 
close to the structure of the design agent that we have discussed and 
the characteristics of its knowledge and of its action rules change 
drastically. 
The structure of a regulation agent is as follows: 
– the name identifying the regulation agent; 
– the specific ontological class of the agent; 
– the current state of the agent, with the expression of its active 
tendency; 
– messaging in reading and broadcast toward the design agents; 
– messaging in reading and broadcast toward the regulation agents; 
– list of design agents specifically expressing the characteristics of 
its ontological class; 
– rules for actions carried out on the design agents;  
– rules for actions carried out on the regulation agents: 
– meta-rules governing the activities and all the rules, especially 
for connections with the other regulation agents;  
– qualified and progressive positive acquaintances with the design 
agents to be used;  
– qualified and progressive negative acquaintances with the 
opposing design agents;  
– qualified and progressive positive acquaintances with the friendly 
regulation agents; 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     131 
– qualified and progressive negative acquaintances with the 
opposing regulation agents;  
– the agent’s memory, which is highly evolving. 
These agents thus have the list of acquaintances of design agents 
that represent the reification of their characters and which they will 
then activate and closely survey, as well as other lists of design agents 
that strongly oppose their characters, which will also be supervised.  
The action of a regulation agent is rational and it is carried out in 
cooperation with the other active regulation agents. The actions are as 
follows: 
– analyzing the morphological structure of a group of active design 
agents based on the semantic characters that they express. Revealing 
the pertinent characters of this structure by comparing this to its 
central ontological theme to see whether the group can be used in its 
search for the correct representatives of its theme, by modifying them 
to a lesser or greater degree;  
– analyzing the state of action and influence of the other regulation 
agents to define the current degree of freedom of its ontological class;  
– attempting, under conditions, to amplify or reduce certain groups 
of design agents by eventually calling upon other regulation agents to 
cooperate and obtain help by broadening or specializing the general 
semantics that will characterize the supervised and controlled group;  
– memorizing the result of its action for systematic learning.  
The regulation agents activate certain groups of design agents 
based on their ontological characters and, above all, they alter the 
behaviors of these groups in their ontological intention and in relation 
to the actions of other regulation agents. They cause groups that are 
specific to their theme to activate themselves in cooperation with other 
regulation agents to represent the right characters in the conformations 
generated for representation, including all the nuances of affectivity in 
the form of the conformations, intensity and speed of the actions of 
the groups. The feature of these controllers is that they are distributed 
and operate with a very high degree of coactivity through a continuous 

132     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
exchange of information. They will not make up classic hierarchic 
structures of control but only define an evolving control that is 
adaptive in nature. That is, they govern the manner in which design 
agents must aggregate themselves by influencing others to finally 
produce a geometrically and semantically admissible form. This 
defines an original concept of emergence in self-controlled systems. 
We can also say that the groups of design agents are aggregates of 
agents that have one semantic expression and one geometric 
conformation, like neuronal aggregates.  
Regulation agents are elements whose activation is defined in the 
control spaces, allowing them to globally alter clouds of design agent 
aggregates, simultaneously and on different scales. At this level, they 
form force lines that majorly influence the activity of the system of 
agents. These incentive control elements, reified in the form of 
regulation agents, represent the tendencies, habits and, aptitudes for 
rational reasoning and for symbolization; and the social and cultural 
tendencies of the system through the manipulation of the design 
agents specific to these characters or that are related to these 
characters. They are significant in the system architecture and operate 
as the reification of an organizational field.  
The regulation agents dynamically represent the ontological 
hierarchies of the system’s knowledge. There are general regulation 
agents like those that indicate positive emotion, for example, and then 
there are more specific agents that are derived from this, such as those 
indicating desire or satisfaction. We thus have morphologies of the 
regulation agents, forming (if so desired) ontological classes that are 
related through semantic distances and controlling well-adapted 
design agents. These morphologies must be managed and this is what 
we will discuss later in the chapter.  
There are several regulation agents to represent all the possible 
characters of the representations. The problem here will be to activate 
only some of them to form a coherent set with precise characteristics. 
In order to do this, we must introduce the concept of mental landscape 
into the agentified system, which will make it possible to define a set 
of active regulation agents in all instances to produce series of 
representations in a specific atmosphere.  

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     133 
The goal of the system, with its artificial corporeality, will be to 
generate coherent action plans and to act. It must then review the 
planning based on the results in order to improve it, to always 
continue learning to produce representations that are ever more 
detailed. This means that the system will use regulation agents that are 
well adapted to this objective, regulation agents that strive to produce 
representations of the critiques, the analyses and the questioning, that 
ensure that all the results of this process will be in coherence and that 
ensure the good performance of the organizational memory, whose 
role will be absolutely critical.  
2.4. The organizational architecture of the system 
We thus have a system that has a corporeality made up of multiple 
electromechanical devices and the artificial psychic system, which is 
essentially a computerized system, receives multiple information from 
the sensors of this corporeality. The psychic system must also have an 
organizational memory, where an enormous amount of knowledge can 
be localized in the form of design agents and regulation agents to  
represent forms of memories that have been apprehended. Depending 
on its habits and tendencies, the system will ceaselessly construct 
representations by activating its design agents controlled by its 
regulation agents, which will engage it in action with its corporeality. 
To generate representations, the system must engage in the process 
that constructs it and this begins with the specification of a thematic 
indication that we call the aim of a representation. 
The aim of a representation 
Any representation is generated from a thematic indication, the 
aim of the representation that commits the system to deploying 
elements to support this indication, to construct the form of the 
produced and apprehended representation. The indication that 
will result in the process of constructing the representation is 
either intentional (and is derived from the action of the 
regulation agents that make the decisional intention in the 
conscious system) or arises from regulation agents who 
represent tendencies and desires and in this case a representation 

134     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
is produced that conforms to the thematic indication of the desire 
and the state of the mental landscape, strongly using the 
experience that has expressed the action of this very tendency in 
similar cases. Any representation is also an element in a more or 
less large series of local representations that are perceived. 
The architecture of the system generating the representations 
will be as follows, deduced from the architecture presented for the 
human psychic system, with numerous subsystems, which, in this 
case, will be localized but very well connected and will represent 
the instances where clouds of software agents will be active (see 
Figure 2.1): 
– the corporeality of the system: this is a set of a large number of 
sensors and effectors connected in a continuous manner to a specific 
object layer that takes all the information, then to the design agents of 
the interface that interpret the information, making it possible to 
represent and interpret the input of the informational flow coming 
from the environment, in a manner that is consistent with the usual 
practice. Taking into account all these sensory sensors, data must be  
gathered on an ongoing basis for the object layers that will send them 
to the interface agents. These interface agents in turn will process the 
data and evaluate it quantitatively and then qualitatively in order to 
find out whether an immediate automatic reaction must be launched or 
whether the data should be sent to the emotion processing system to 
produce representations; or, if the data are habitual, normal, they are 
not taken into account in the representations;  
– an emotion processing system generates emotions in response 
to data coming from the corporeality and to fundamental tendencies. 
This important component is, of course, related to the corporeality 
and also the components of the preconscious and the unconscious, 
with which it ceaselessly communicates by making their multiple 
regulation agents communicate between themselves. It manages  
the formation and development of emotions so that they are 
experienced well and sensations lead to feelings. It can generate 
aims related to very subjective or cognitive desires. The sensors and 
emotion-processing center will always remain active in order to 
represent the sensibility of the artificial organism. The data from the 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     135 
corporeality will be seen as a continuous flow of information, some 
of which brings about automatic physical reactions of the “reflex” 
type. Any failure in the physical elements of the corporeality will be 
perceived as sensations of pain or even functional anomalies;  
– an unconscious system, made up of groups of dormant design 
agents and regulation agents, represents all the knowledge and all the 
naturally or artificially experienced events. By localizing the large 
organizational memory, it also organizes – through multiple 
dynamic networks where the memory regulation agents will operate – 
the design agents that reify all the knowledge and memories of the 
system. The unconscious system will also localize the regulation 
agents that represent the artificial impulses as those generating 
desires;  
– a preconscious system that is, in the functioning of the system, 
made up of an organization of clouds of active design agents, with 
agents interpreting information from the sensory sensors and the 
elements transferred from the unconscious during the launch of 
activity with the aim of providing elements of pre-representations. 
This system will generate the pre-representations, which will evolve. 
It plays a major role in the representation of the current mental 
landscape made up of the coordinated set of active regulators that fix 
the current characters of the system. This preconscious will be 
associated with an immediate memory, localizing the perennially 
pertinent activities for the streams of ongoing emergences; 
– a conscious system that ensures the complete formation of the 
current representation through the construction of an emerging 
coherent form, by choosing one or more pre-representations in the 
preconscious system. The conscious system has a very specific 
subsystem that expresses the sensation of thinking through 
multicriteria analysis of the conformation of the representation in 
order to produce a memory synthesis. This component can gather and 
apprehend the characters of the pre-representations of the 
preconscious system and calls upon one (or an association of several) 
of these to develop them and create the current representation. It 
enforces the intentional aims to produce representations which cause 
the regulation agents to activate themselves in all instances and 
especially in the organizational layer and in the preconscious system, 

136     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
which will develop the representations along the theme of the aim. 
The conscious system will thus have the role of controlling the 
emergences and also a role of arousal for that which may emerge, by 
producing aims; 
– an immediate memory system that makes it possible to localize 
what was just experienced in the conscious, which will be finely 
associated with the preconscious, influence the formation of| 
pre-representations and will then place well-structured elements into 
the organizational memory;   
– an organizational layer, the equivalent of the systemic layer, 
which makes it possible to establish a link between the emotion 
center, the unconscious, the preconscious and the conscious, and 
which makes it possible to give the system organizational coherence. 
This informational layer is strongly coordinated with the conscious 
system in order to diffuse the aim and generate the correct 
pre-representations. This is a general informational layer, a distributed 
network using its own regulation agents that will thus cause regulation 
agents to activate themselves in all instances by realizing their 
homogeneity. This layer will produce the mental landscape by 
causing the regulation agents to activate themselves in a coordinated 
manner where these agents will be coherent in all instances, thus 
producing, in each instance, its specific characters and unifying them 
in order for the action of the regulation agents to create a climate of 
representation to be managed. Its regulation agents will thus play a 
major coordinating role by controlling the aggregates of agents in the 
other instances. A conscious system could play a steering role, 
through its regulation agents, as a part of this layer connects the 
preconscious to the conscious in order to impose the current aim with 
its tendencies. The organizational layer that reifies the mental 
landscape will thus lead to the activation of the correct agents of 
regulation of instances to carry out the development of the  
pre-representations according to the aim. In the context of the mental 
landscape, the regulation agents of the instances will cause the correct 
design agents to extract themselves at the right time and at the right 
sites to allow for their coherent and appropriate aggregation in the 
preconscious, then to place the correct representation in the conscious 
so that it is finalized.  

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     137 
 
Figure 2.1. Organizational scheme of the artificial psychic system.  
For a color version of the figure, please see www.iste.co.uk/cardon/ai.zip 
In the artificial psychic system, the agents are relatively mobile 
between instances and are especially coactive in order to produce 
organized aggregates, the whole being driven by regulation agents of 
the organizational layer, the role of its agents being, above all, that of 
controlling regulation agents of instances, which in turn chiefly 
control the design agents. Thus, the design agents and regulation 
agents will form coherent, dynamic morphologies, variable, 
interconnected and changing, but typical of the characters of different 
instances. These morphologies are, geometrically, conformations with 
one or more dominant elements at the energetic and conceptual level, 
and they will, thus, often be lattice-type sets, with elements associated 

138     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
in variable relations of association or domination. The ensemble will 
be definable based on the relational, conceptual and energetic 
dimensions and there will be specific regulation agents for studies of 
the morphologies of the aggregates of agents to characterize them and 
give the regulation agents the correct indications for their 
morphological and semantic characters.  
Status of the computable architecture of the artificial psychic 
     system 
The computable architecture of the artificial psychic system 
defines a very dynamic organization, which has subsystems that 
represent the five instances of a psychic system, and which 
makes it possible, using a high number of agents and structures 
of agents defined at the construction, to realize emergent 
representations that are stable for an instant, cognitive and 
sensible, with precise roles for generating thoughts and 
deepening knowledge. Such an architecture will have the 
property of being able to evaluate its emergent representations 
formed of agents by the system that represents the instance of 
the conscious, which is the process that corresponds to the 
sensation of thinking and it can, thus, question the internal 
constructs of its organizational memory to deploy its questioning 
in an intentional manner.  
These different systems that represent the instances cooperate to a 
high degree with the regulation agents, but they operate with enough 
autonomy to define the essential characters of the system. They are 
coordinated by the organizational layer, which is the control layer 
deployed over all the specific systems and whose regulation agents 
carry out the control. As the control of the regulation agents is not 
imperative but realized with incitement and needs to be established 
and re-established, to be re-formulated and to be adapted, the system 
will be very flexible. To remedy the inconsistencies between opposing 
regulation agents, we will use meta regulation agents in the 
organizational layer, something that does not exist very clearly in  
the human psychic system, but which can be easily installed in the 
artificial system.  

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     139 
The concept of regulation agent is central to this architecture, as 
they will be regulators of instances and will define organized 
functioning in the system. The architecture will make it possible to 
define the tendencies to intentionally produce representations and, 
above all, to define the particular types of representations. There will, 
thus, be regulation agents to represent the different emotions, 
sentiments, sociability, aptitudes for abstraction, reasoning, judgment, 
the quality of memorizations, questioning, abstraction, generalization, 
classification and the problem will be that of coordinating these 
aptitudes and organizing their morphology. The structuring agent that 
makes it possible to define the control of the aggregates of the design 
agents in the system by the regulation agents is presented in Figure 2.2.

140     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
With this system architecture, there will be three categories of 
regulation agents depending on their placement in the relations 
between the systems that represent the instances:  
1) the regulation agents that operate at the level of the relation 
between the unconscious and the preconscious via the organizational 
layer carry out their own activity outside the conscious and define 
deep tendencies. These controllers will thus reify the impulsive 
tendencies and cause memories to activate themselves depending on 
the theme of the aim and depending on the active tendencies;   
2) the 
regulation 
agents 
operating 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the  
conscious–unconscious link via the organizational layer, which will be 
those that make it possible to generate the thought representations and 
effectively exercise the concepts of reason and will of the system, and, 
doing so, to deploy the pre-representations in the mental landscapes;  
3) the regulation agents operating in the conscious to intentionally 
define the aim, to seize upon the pre-representation and act on it to 
form the representation, to generate apprehension and the sensation of 
thinking, which will construct a synthesis of this representation placed 
in the immediate memory system by dissolving the representation and 
freeing its constituent agents.  
The regulation agents that link the preconscious to the unconscious 
will act in the following fields in particular, through calls and by 
activating the appropriate agents in the organizational memory by 
wrapping them to construct aggregates depending on their specific 
characters:  
– classifications and categorizations, types of reasoning, logical 
manipulations, classifications and distinctions, structuring knowledge, 
types of emotions and sensations, postural elements, temporal 
characters, spatial characters, abstractions, designations, identifications 
and knowledge, types of shapes and movements, all the language 
categories, geometric categories, judgements and assessments, typical 
humor, social rules, deep or acquired tendencies, learning, important  
events, etc. 
In the regulation agents that connect the conscious and the 
preconscious, there are agents operating on the aggregated proposed to 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     141 
the conscious, making it possible to realize the sensation of thinking, 
but also acting on the expression of regulation agents of the 
preconscious to invest them and modify their behaviors depending on 
the current mental landscape and goal. These regulation agents in the 
conscious will have corresponding types in the regulation agents of 
the preconscious but these will have deeper actions. Their principal 
types of actions may be:  
– questioning and curiosity, sensible tonality and feelings, posture 
and choice of posture, reflections on the structuring of knowledge, 
realism and questioning of habit, fundamental perception of being, the 
feeling of existing, sensation of temporality, deep values, judgements 
(including moral judgements), fundamental values and ethics, 
apprehension of self and the other, fundamental categories, 
safeguarding the integrity of the system, etc.  
All these actions will take into account knowledge very finely 
placed in organizational memory and which makes it possible to carry 
out analyses and memorize their results in a well-organized form and 
not simply as a list of things.  
The conscious will also have regulation agents that engage in the 
intentional generation of aims. This will form an organization of 
agents that define, each time, a dominant regulation agent that will 
give the character of the aim and pledge in the activation of regulation 
agents that conform to the character indicated by this aim throughout 
the system. There will also be regulation agents engaging in producing 
a certain mental landscape, that is, activating certain types of 
regulation agents in all other instances and causing the immediate 
activation of design agents that express the specific characters of this 
type, notably by extracting them from the organizational memory 
using the regulation agents of the memory to place them in the 
preconscious. The mental landscape will be in place before the 
generation of the aim, which makes it possible to produce series of 
representations around a single theme and it may be transformed by 
specific regulation agents of this action by changing the context and 
type of aim. 

142     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The organizational layer will localize a meta regulation agent, the 
highly important regulation agent of intentionality, operating on the 
morphology of the space of the regulation agents and making it 
possible to continuously define free will in the choice of aims. Its 
action will be divided between the conscious and the organizational 
layer. This is in opposition to the autonomous generation of aims by 
the regulation agents of fundamental tendencies, which will produce 
desires for things arising from the context or the organizational 
memory.  
We will now proceed to a detailed examination of the 
organizational memory, which is the major system that makes it 
possible to memorize experiences and introduce facts that constitute 
the forms of the representations.  
2.5. Organizational memory and artificial experience 
The system has a memory that contains dynamic and well-
structured knowledge, with the memorization of events that have been 
experienced, apprehended and perceived. This makes it a memory that 
does not at all operate by selecting information that has been 
requested but which contains multiple small networks describing the 
aggregates of design agents representing the memorization of 
phenomena that have been apprehended. The use of the memorization 
of experienced events is fundamental to producing sensible 
representations. The production of any artificial thought will be based 
on the use of a memorized experience and used by the flow of the 
expression of tendencies and desires represented by the regulation 
agents. The constitution of this experience, its precise architecture and 
its manipulation, which must be very efficient, are one of the keys to 
the realization of the system of generation of artificial thoughts. 
The organizational memory of the system will have the following 
structure. At the level of the representation of the memory elements, it 
is composed of specific design agents, the memory design agents, 
which have the following structure: 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     143 
– the memory agent has an identifier, an ontological domain and a 
very precise theme; 
– it represents a character of a representation that has been 
generated;  
– it indicates its ontological field, which is a character like a 
sentence-word, an image that has been apprehended, the context of an 
event, the circumstances of a sensation or a feeling that has been 
perceived, etc. These characters are represented in the memory agent 
by a short list that names the specific design agents, which have these 
characters and comes from the memorized representation. These are 
direct indications of the identity of these agents, which is the normal 
choice for coding in order not to use design agents multiple times. As 
we will see, this will also be a choice of conformity with the case of 
the living being;  
– in addition to its particular ontological class, it indicates the 
ontological hierarchy that situates its theme;  
– it specifies its importance through the frequency of its use;  
– there are three types of lists of principal acquaintances: the 
memory design agents that have characters close to their own, 
memory agents that have a more general theme than their own and 
memory agents that have subordinate themes and which are 
specialized in their theme. The memory design agent thus indicates 
its position in the conceptual and ontological hierarchy of 
memorized facts; 
– it indicates the memory agents of a different class but which are 
often activated following its own activation, which are in another 
hierarchy or which may indeed be close to it but have formed 
aggregates of agents active with it, which makes it possible to clearly 
define the characters of the experience; 
– it has a memory that indicates the employment of its uses and its 
modifications.  
Such an agent is therefore a factual indicator of a memorized event 
and is, above all, an operator who specifies the three possible 
operations on its theme: completing the theme, generalizing it or 

144     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
specializing it. It is thus a character representing a fact that intervenes 
in a memorized representation and which will engage the eventual 
activity of the three chief ontological operations of the organizational 
memory that we previously described and which are the basic 
set-theoretic operations. 
The organizational memory will be organized into networks of 
memory agents related through concepts of semantic proximities or 
semantic generalizations. The concepts of proximity, specialization 
and generalization can be precisely defined using qualifications 
related to the acquaintances of the agents. 
Furthermore, the difference between the immediate memory and 
the organizational memory is thus very clear. Immediate memory 
preserves the conformations of the representations made by the design 
agents, which renders its elements immediately operational. In the 
case of organizational memory, we must extract graphs whose 
elements are indicators for the agents and reconstitute the aggregates 
of design agents to activate them, which takes much longer.  
This organizational memory can then be very precisely qualified in 
different domains, certain of them being specific to sensible facts and 
others to conceptual and rational facts that qualify many different 
domains. This will be managed, at the general level, by memory 
regulation agents, which are also called memory indicator agents, 
which will form an indicative memory layer over all the memory 
design agents. These regulation agents will solicit the parts of the 
memory where the memory design agents are available by identifying 
them based on their characters. They will also be the interface agents 
for the organizational memory in communication with the other 
regulation agents of other instances.  
Memory regulation agent 
A memory regulation agent is used to indicate the memorized 
elements to activate them based on semantic characters and the 
manipulation events that identify them. Each agent of this type 
belongs to a general ontological class and indicates the very 
specific subclass of that which it could precisely reference, very 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     145 
often with temporal and contextual instructions. It is therefore a 
thematic indicator and has lists of memory design agents that 
specify the semantic characters corresponding to its own and 
those that are semantically close or a little removed from it. 
These agents will indicate either precise memory design agents 
or sets of memory design agents that form the complete 
memorization of a set of representations of neighboring themes. 
They can also modify the characters and structures of memory 
design agents, in the case of insertion of a new representation 
into the memory. These will be accessible to regulation agents of 
other instances that will solicit them, which can activate them to 
trigger the onset of a memory either of a piece of knowledge or 
an event.  
We have specified that the regulation agents of instances have 
precise ontological characters and have lists of acquaintances that 
indicate to them the memory regulation agents that have the same 
ontological character or ontological characters that are close or 
opposing. The regulation agents will form the informational layer of 
the organizational memory, which defines a network of semantic 
and morphological relations between all the elements, between them 
and with the memory design agents.  
In order to make this memory high performing, we thus have 
memory regulation agents that indicate the theme defined in the 
ontologies by referring to more specific memory regulation agents. 
This is done at all levels of the ontological instructions and these will 
thus be indicative controllers of the characters borne by the memory 
regulation agents. We thus have an informational layer that organizes 
this memory and, based on a character of any given level of input by a 
regulation agent of the other instances, there will be automatic 
querying carried out between the memory regulation agents to arrive 
at the correct group of memory design agents.  
The memory design agents are small structures that indicate the 
form and content of the memorized representation in the form of 
graphs. In these graphs, the nodes are the indicators for the design 
agents, the arcs indicate the semantics of the relations and the 
amplitude of semantic distances, and the facets of the graphs represent 

146     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
the geometric forms of the memorized morphological conformation, 
with peaks and necessary subordinate forms. There is also an 
indication of the major element in this graph, corresponding to the 
central theme of the memorized representation, then the relative value 
of the set of nodes. The organizational memory, in its entirety, is thus 
a very large graph of graphs with multiple domains that must be 
manipulated and whose semantic distances must be indicated. And 
here, the memory regulation agents will be absolutely necessary as 
they are the dynamic pathways to go from a graph with semantics to 
its subgraphs and, finally, to the set of memory design agents that had 
to be identified. These paths are learnt and memorized in the memory 
regulation agents, which communicate between themselves. The 
memory regulation agents thus form an informational layer of 
manipulation of the graph of graphs, which is itself a set that has the 
characters of the informational graphs.  
Thus, any regulation agent of an instance that solicits the 
organizational memory acts in the following manner: 
– definition of the character to be solicited taken from the aim or 
from the aggregates of design agents in an instance like the 
preconscious; 
– action of the regulation agent of solicitation with the specified 
character toward the organizational memory: call from the regulation 
agent of solicitation of a memory regulation agent that corresponds 
more or less to this character and which it knows from its list of 
memory acquaintances; 
– action of the memory regulation agent, which communicates with 
the other memory regulation agents to find the correct path with the 
requested character and arrives at the context of the character formed 
by the memory design agents;  
– choice of several memory design agents by agreement between 
the memory regulation agents and the regulation agents of solicitation 
to offer the right possibilities and refer to several experienced and 
memorized cases; 
– activity of the requested memory design agents that submit 
themselves to the regulation agent that requested the memory, the 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     147 
regulation agent choosing the right memory agent and then the 
replacement of its graph of indication of design agents structured by 
active design agents and the placement of the organized aggregate of 
these agents in the representation being constructed. 
In the case where several open characters are expressed by design 
agents in a pre-representation and there is solicitation of the 
organizational memory, the regulation agent gives all these indications 
in the form of a list to the memory regulation agents that it identifies 
and these communicate with other memory regulation agents in order 
to deploy themselves in the memory. An aggregate of memory 
regulation agents is thus formed that solicits memory design agents. 
These form aggregates of memory design agents managed by their 
regulation agents and finally aggregates of design agents representing 
the operations of specialization, generalization and proximity, placing 
themselves in the mental landscape that will take a complex form by 
representing 
the 
possible 
events 
for 
pursuing 
the 
current 
representation toward its deployment.  
Thus, the soliciting regulation agent that has launched a memory 
regulation agent may engage in amplifying the information that it 
received in the form of the clearly explained graph that represents the 
design agents. It can engage in generalizing the theme or indeed in 
specializing it by again soliciting memory regulation agents. And in 
these cases, there will be a very short generation of representations 
with aggregates of active design agents, which will continue by 
generalization or specialization of the initial theme. This is exactly the 
case of a series of generations of representations from a given subject, 
by continuing specializations or generalizations. It is therefore 
possible to say that organizational memory is made to engage the 
generation of representations in series, it is the organization of 
elements for the generation of series of artificial thought forms around 
the same general theme. And let us note that this is an exact copy of 
the functioning of the human state, carried out here through agents.  
The memory regulation agents carry out the same control role as 
the regulation agents of instances and we can thus specify the status of 
this memory. 

148     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The status of the organizational memory 
The organizational memory, through its memory regulation 
agents that control the memory design agents, is the conceptual 
substrate, dense and active throughout, of the system that 
generates 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
pre-representations 
and 
representations. This is in no way a factual memory located 
outside the active system as a database, but is a very finely 
structured set of agents that, through their activity, unceasingly 
proposes close cases, generalizations and specializations of the 
dominant character of each pre-representation, thus making it 
possible 
to 
deploy 
conceptually 
developed 
series 
of 
representations in the mental landscape, which will be 
continuously perceived by the conscious system. This memory 
anchors things that were experienced and which produced 
positive or negative emotional representatives, thus creating a 
certain profile for the artificial system.  
Thus, we have specified the permanent and central organizational 
role that this memory plays in the production of representations. 
In this memory, that which is experienced will be made available 
to multiple latent structures of memory agents, each of which gives 
the characters of a representation or a small series of coherent 
representations around a theme that has been apprehended. These are 
the traces of the interpretation of events that are apprehended and 
assessed in all their complexity, events that were experienced in a 
tangible manner and may be called in the preconscious with characters 
of judgement and subjective characters surrounding these judgements. 
Some of these events will be generated for the construction of a 
system and will, thus, be totally artificial to constitute the available 
memory during the launching of the system. The particularity here is 
that any access to these events memorized by memory recall must 
more or less modify them, as well as their character of importance in 
the organizational memory, especially their call frequency. 
Any representation that is perceived and assessed is memorized in 
one or more memory agents that form an aggregate with information 
in the form of dynamic, graph-like structures with indicators for 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     149 
design agents, indicating the characters of their acquaintance relations 
and of their importance, as these memory agents are controlled by the 
memory regulation agents that organize them at the cognitive and 
morphological level. There will be memory regulation agents that 
indicate the conformations of the aggregates of the memory design 
agents, the semantic and tangible characters of the aggregates. All the 
characters that we have specified to express the event to be memorized 
will be taken into account, for every event apprehended, by 
characterizing it thus as a complex element, by meshing it with respect 
to other memory agents already in place. This will form the 
experience on the right scale, to conform the organizational memory. 
This memory will be realized through an architecture that allows for 
the use of artificial experiences during the design of the system and 
will form, through its characters and aspects, the artificial history of 
its references and the “personal” aptitudes of the system. By closely 
associating this with the fundamental tendencies, representing the 
impulses and their elaboration, and represented by the regulation 
agents of the unconscious, this will form what we can call the 
psychological profile of the artificial organism. 
The structure of the organizational memory is indeed totally 
dynamic and organizational. There are basic elements, which are the 
memory design agents that specify the local characters that are 
memorized, then there is the layer of memory regulation agents that 
are the indicators of the ways of controlling and accessing these basic 
elements, which will reorganize them for each case of memorization 
of a representation or a series of coherent representations in order to 
carry out the insertions. These agents that indicate the paths will then 
truly operate as agents, that is, their actions will be able to modify the 
indicator characters of the memory design agents and will also be able 
to modify the structure of these elements, the way in which they are 
related. It is through this modifying principle that the production of 
new representations will be able to alter the memory traces of 
representations of the same type by changing the roles and the 
coaction of the indicators of the design agents that make up the graphs 
in the memory agents, by adding certain indicators for design agents 
or by removing them. These regulation agents of indicators will thus 
operate in a manner that is both morphological and semantic, by 

150     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
modifying, across several levels, the organization of the memory 
agents that manage the indication structures of the design agents, and 
their role is, indeed, organizational.  
We must also take into account the case of representations of large 
amplitude, where the regulation agents of the conscious conduct the 
action of their developments and apprehensions. In this case,  
the memory regulation agents may finely associate themselves with 
the regulation agents of instances so that the memory trace of the 
representation to be placed in memory is a bifurcating line in the 
organizational memory, with the modification of the indicative and 
coactive characters of the regulation agents of the memorial layer, 
which may then alter the memory agents that they control. The role of 
the organizational memory layer is very important in organizational 
memory, but this memory remains subject to the activity of the 
conscious, which manages the representations and cannot, in any 
circumstances, propose the active onset of memory elements by itself. 
The regulation agents of the organizational layer do this.  
The process of placing a generated representation in organizational 
memory is in no way done simply by locating it into the memory of its 
form. The process is as follows. 
Begin 
– Activation of the regulation agents of the conscious, charged 
with entering into memory the synthesis of the representation 
generated toward the memory regulation agents. 
– Activation of the memory regulation agents related to the theme 
of the synthesis of the representation:  
- through semantic communication between themselves, the 
memory regulation agents access the memory design agents of  
the theme defined as the central theme of the synthesis of the 
representation. As well as this, there are other memory regulation 
agents to indicate the memory design agents that correspond to the 
subordinate themes of the components of the synthesis of the 
representation. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     151 
– Comparison of the central theme of the synthesis presented with 
the most important memory elements indicated by the memory 
regulation agents: action of morphological and semantic comparison 
of structures made up of their graphs indicating the structures of the 
design agents. 
– Comparison of the same kind but with other memory agents that 
are similar to the given synthesis of the representation. 
– Collaborative process of the memory regulation agents resulting 
in the decision to insert the synthesis of the representation as a new 
memory design agent, well-positioned in an aggregate or as characters 
taking in the synthesis of the representation added to one or more 
memory agents that are already present or, again, replacing, in a 
memory design agent, its graph of indicators of design agents with a 
new graph constructed based on the synthesis of the representation. 
– In all cases, certain indicator relations of the graph of memory 
design agents are modified through insertion by other regularly 
connected memory agents and, thus, through the modification of 
indications of the regulation agents of the memory layer. 
End 
It may be considered that every generation of a representation or a 
very coherent series of small representations around a single theme is 
a double task in the system: it must generate the conformation of the 
representation with the action of numerous agents and then it must 
insert the synthesis of this representation into the organizational 
memory, which also requires the activation of many agents. The 
system must, therefore, have the means to activate many agents in 
processes acting in parallel mode. 
One of the major roles of the conscious is to produce the tonality 
enveloping a flow of generated thought forms, with large characters of 
tonality such as joy, pleasure, pain, nostalgia, fear, boredom, 
aggression, etc. In order to do this, the conscious will reorganize the 
parts of the active organizational memory so that it may bring to the 
fore the networks of active elements that have characters that conform 
to the tonality being developed at that moment. 

152     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
Structure of the artificial experience 
The computer architecture that will make up the structure 
reifying the experienced events into organizational memory is a 
spatial and semantic organization, with elements memorized in 
the form of memory design agents localizing the dynamic 
structures of indications of the design agents of the graph type, 
with the evaluation of characters; all these structures being 
managed by a layer of memory regulation agents that make it 
possible to localize the memory structures based on the themes 
and the multiple subthemes. All events memorized in the 
artificial experience are apprehended by the memory regulation 
agents depending on the current lighting given by the state of 
active fundamental tendencies. These regulator agents memorize 
a representation and proceed to modifications of existing 
conformations of the same themes to adapt the organizational 
memory to each new representation, which is a dynamic fact of 
memorization that modifies the past. 
The quality of what the system may produce as representations will 
therefore greatly depend on what it has in its organizational memory. 
Taking the aims into account must make it possible to recall events 
that are valid for past behavior, which were implemented at 
construction, or even real events apprehended by the real behavior of 
the system and its intentional generation of representations. The past 
experiences required for the present requests in the system, including 
the classic ones that concern the manipulation of knowledge, must be 
recalled. The system activity will increase and dynamically reorganize 
organizational memory through events that it will represent in a 
certain manner, by managing and perceiving them. The creation of 
this artificial experience will finally condition the postures and 
reactions of the system before the real events that it may then assess as 
phenomena. Furthermore, the system must not be allowed to 
frequently use the traces of a single, ordinary experience leading to 
mechanical representations. A strong tendency related to questioning 
must be introduced into the system, which it must continuously 
exercise over the events that it experiences. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     153 
The construction of this artificial experience that must be lodged 
into the organizational memory is not an elementary problem for 
computer scientists, as it is a multidisciplinary task to undertake for 
the construction of the generation process of artificial thoughts that an 
artificial organism can produce on being endowed with a certain 
“personality”. At the level of the architecture, the organizational 
memory of the artificial system is an organization of indicative 
structures, which are layers of memory agents that indicate 
specializations, domains, themes and characters. This is the case with 
the structuring of human organizational memory. Then, at the lowest 
level, all the pieces of information memorized in the memory of the 
artificial system are graphs indicating the morphological and semantic 
conformation of a specific representation where the memory agents 
are indicated. The selection of such graphs, moreover, activates an 
organized aggregate of design agents. In the case of human 
organizational memory, the memorized elements are networks of 
small aggregates of neurons regarding which we set that activation 
must form an active graph of aggregates of neurons whose aspects 
give the morphological conformation. We thus say that in the case of 
memory, there is a strong similarity between the case of the human 
and the case of the artificial system and that by modeling the artificial 
case we can acquire more knowledge of the human case. 
The architecture of an organizational memory 
At the elementary level, an organizational memory is made up of 
graphs of indicators of cognitive elements that carry 
morphological and semantic information. These elements are 
selected by control elements which activate them so that they 
make up well-organized active forms carrying meaning. These 
indicator graphs provide links between indications of elements 
representing elementary knowledge and they are localized in 
many domains specific to the types of memorized knowledge. 
They are managed by control elements that constitute them by 
inserting the generated representations into the correct contexts. 
The architecture of human organizational memory and that of 
the organizational memory of the artificial system are analogous, 
with the model of the artificial system yielding information on 
the human model. 

154     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The architectures are similar and the results of the functioning 
must, in both cases, be similar. There is also similarity in the case of 
immediate natural and artificial memories, which maintain the activity 
of the aggregates of active elements and not the elements taken in the 
form of graphs. 
2.6. Affective and tendential states of the system 
Given the architecture that we have defined, we will examine how 
the concepts of affectivity and sensation are generated in the 
representations. The general concept of affectivity spans the concepts 
of affective tendencies, emotions, sensations and feelings. This will be 
represented in the system by the action of many specific regulation 
agents located in the emotion processing instance and in the 
organizational layer, and which will activate the specific design agents 
of the affective characters. Artificial affectivity can be defined as 
follows. 
Artificial affective states 
The artificial psychic system has an emotion-processing 
component that includes regulation agents representing all types 
of emotions, which are related to memory agents that represent 
emotional states related to experienced emotions. And in order 
to generate an emotion, these agents will take temporary control 
of the entirety of the mental landscape and rational agents from 
the conscious system to give it a strictly emotional character, 
thereby causing a small series of unintentional apprehensions to 
develop. These will then produce invasive emotional states. The 
system will, thus, be in an intense state of emotional 
apprehension. Very quickly, the regulation agents of the 
conscious system will regain control of the mental landscape and 
the representations entered into immediate memory to analyze 
and assess the characters of these emotional states by generating 
aims for analysis. Furthermore, there will always be the 
possibility of representing affective characters in representations 
when the mental landscape is open. Any affective character is 
either a brief invasion of the mental landscape with the 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     155 
inhibition of rational regulators or a character that modifies a 
rational representation by inserting affective conformations via a 
mental landscape containing emotional characters. Any affective 
element in a representation engages the hegemony of emotional 
regulation agents that briefly inhibit the rational regulation 
agents in the conscious system. 
The basic elements for expressing sensations are, evidently, 
specific design agents that are apt for interpreting signals and 
information from the sensors of the organism and the forms of 
aggregates of design agents to ensure the interpretation and synthesis 
of these data. Each agent activates itself in response to a specific type 
of information, including information coming from the sensors on the 
corporeality, which it examines with a certain frequency and intensity, 
then proposes a certain reactive action. The goal of the emotion 
regulation agent is to aggregate the actions of design agents of the 
emotional type, which are deployed in parallel to cause the 
emergence, within the clouds of active design agents, of 
configurations whose characters and forms hold good for several types 
of characteristic emotions. The advantage of this approach, using  
fine-grained agents with morphological evaluation, is that it makes it 
possible to melt, blend and synchronize different sources that provoke 
emotions and even to blend different types of emotions, through the 
coactivation of dynamic forms. Above all, this makes it possible to 
prolong the duration of the emotion. In this way, we can generate 
complex emotions with a complicated artificial body, made up of 
multiple distributed components, by generating emotional landscapes 
that can support the preconscious system in generating the forms 
perceived by the conscious system. 
The regulation agents representing affective characters are agents 
whose action must lead to the categorization of representations in the 
mental landscape and conscious system, representations such as 
pleasure before a person or a view, sorrow, joy or fear in a certain 
situation, anger or surprise, or again, boredom in a state of inaction. 
This signifies that the system will generate series of specific 
representations of these states, which the system will then analyze. 
These agents will often be in a state of arousal, but will only be truly 

156     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
active in developing their invasive characters in a very short series of 
representations if the control regulators of the conscious system allow 
them this possibility. This will depend on the character of the mental 
landscape, the state of control the conscious system has over the data 
coming from the corporeality and the informational outputs of the 
organizational memory. And it will, perhaps, be necessary to define 
negative tendencies in the system, where the system is in a state that 
opposes its contextual reality, in a state of pain or suffering, which is 
something the emotion regulation agents can do. 
These regulation agents govern the specific flow of informational 
activities related to the corporeality and the organizational layer. 
Affectivity will be carried out by the emotion processing center, 
which ensures a continuous link between the sensors on the 
corporeality and the preconscious system. There are specific 
regulation agents for emotions that are always active between the 
emotion center and the preconscious system to generate strong, 
dominant emotions, such as panic or anxiety in a tense situation. And 
there will, of course, be regulation agents of the conscious system that 
proceed to control these emotions by resuming a process of producing 
rational representations. But the emotions will play a very important 
role as they will give the system its perceptible apprehension of the 
reality of apprehended things, in all situations, and could insert 
characters in many representations. The sensations and feelings will 
ensure the action and regulation of the typical basic elements by 
adding the conceptual character of characters of sensitivity to the 
aggregates of design agents in order to form enhanced conformations. 
The specific emotion regulation agents will have to ensure a tangible 
tonality in the emergences and endow them with greater or lesser 
affective character for a certain duration and with a certain intensity. 
The organizational memory will thus have many memory agents 
that express the characters of the different emotions experienced in the 
representations and according to the situations, which will form a field 
with layers in this organizational memory. These agents could 
increase the rational characters to specify the characters of different 
emotions that the system underwent in the events that it experienced.  
There will therefore be design agents that express all emotions, 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     157 
positive and negative, which will be associated with different 
representations of the same subjects, activated in different 
environments. And there will, of course, be regulation agents that will 
characterize all types of emotions, with their intensity and capacity for 
propagation in the continuations of representations. 
The realization of the sensation of fear in the artificial system 
consists of causing a specific regulation agent for this situation to act 
in a hegemonic manner and dominate the other regulation agents 
during a brief period, creating a state of domination in the 
representation of an event that has arisen and taking over the entire 
mental landscape. An event apprehended from information from the 
sensors must be experienced with total domination, giving it an 
invasive representational form. All the perceptions rationally analyzed 
by the design agents and regulators of rational analysis will thus be 
inhibited, such that only the perception that triggered the action of the 
fear regulation agent leads to the generation of the series of 
representations, which is the fear of the apprehended thing. The 
system will experience a state of being frozen, as it will find it 
impossible during this domination of fear to intentionally generate 
rational aims (something it will keep attempting and failing to do). 
Then, after this effect of invasion, the regulation agent provoking the 
state of fear will no longer be hegemonic and will only be a disruptor 
of the rational representations carried out by the conscious system, to 
some extent influencing the generation of aims. 
Let us note that the choice of regulation agents of the conscious 
system and the preconscious system as well as how they are related 
are essential for defining the qualities of the productions of the 
artificial psychic system. These are the elements that will 
morphologically drive and control all the categorizations to produce 
tonal emergences in the conscious system. Depending on the options 
chosen during the construction, it will then be possible to impose, 
within the conscious system of this artificial system, regulation agents 
of the ethical openness type or even aggression. The highly important 
regulation agent of assessment of the realistic character of any 
perceived phenomenon, which is present in the organizational layer, 
must take the support of the regulation agents of categorization, 

158     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
analysis and the conformity of the aggregates of regulation agents of 
the preconscious system thereby making it possible to assess the 
aspects of the elements of the apprehended scene. In the case of poor 
coordination, attitudes that deviate with respect to reality may be 
produced as the regulation agent for assessing realism can accept 
unrealistic and purely imaginary phenomena as real or true, 
experiencing them as being highly satisfactory. 
The representation of the system’s tendencies leads us to introduce 
garbling components for the activity of regulation agents. Strong 
tendencies, comparable to those experienced by humans, are the desire 
to question and to understand, to have something and to be involved in 
activity, to dominate, and impose one’s will. Regulation agents 
representing the fundamental tendencies with which this system will 
be endowed will always be active in order to make it possible to 
realize the expression of these fundamental tendencies and we will 
call them regulation agents of tendencies. These are agents that will 
represent desires that lead to the products of types of representations 
that bring about pleasure and satisfaction. However, these agents are 
opposed to certain agents of rational aims in the conscious system and 
an equilibrium will be achieved, with the conscious system, for 
example, generating short representations to oppose certain desires 
that express a commitment to action. These agents are inductors of 
regulation agents by activating themselves over their organizational 
space to establish bifurcation lines. They will, thus, cause the 
activation of certain aggregates of design agents, rather than others, to 
modify their actions, to disrupt them, to give a specific character of 
tendency to the generated representations.  
Regulation agents of tendencies 
Regulation agents representing the different tendencies will 
often be active. These are regulation agents that are in the 
unconscious system, but which can act at the level of the 
organizational layer and influence the functioning of the entire 
system. These agents will generate desires and seize 
opportunities to activate regulation agents that have specific 
ontological characteristics, depending on the mental state that 
they impose, based on the characters of their tendency. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     159 
According to the behavioral state of the system, there will be 
tendency agents that will analyze the mental landscape and the 
active aggregates in the preconscious system, and then launch 
regulation agents that are appropriate for their ontological 
characters. Thus, the system will be able to follow its tendencies 
in 
certain 
situations 
and 
compel 
the 
production 
of 
representations or generate representations of the analysis 
leading to the rejection of a desire. 
Tendency agents are analyzers of the theme of the aggregates of 
design agents in the preconscious system. They cause specific 
regulation agents to activate themselves if these aggregates and the 
mental landscape pose a problem of contradiction with their themes. 
They will communicate with the regulation agents by sending them 
propositions for actions to modify their behavior. During the 
conception of the system, it will be necessary to define all these 
tendency agents with great precision as regards their entry into action 
and to define the regulation agents of the conscious system that 
evaluate the representations of the tendencies in order to accept or 
refuse them. 
The process of generating a representation after the production of a 
tendency such as a desire is explained using the following example: 
– normal activation of all instances of the system; 
– action of a tendency regulation agent expressing a precise desire: 
see this object once again;  
– generation of an aim indicating the theme of the desire;  
– the immediate generation, in the preconscious system, of a short 
representation expressing the desire to go see this object; 
– the acquisition of the pre-representation in the conscious system 
in its own form, without modification; 
– the apprehension of the representation; 
– the production of the analysis of the representation; 
– the generation of a short series of representations specifying the 
manner in which to go back to the object by locating it; 

160     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
– the system’s action to go toward the object; 
– the generation of short representations of facts in the memory of 
activities that have been carried out before using the thing during the 
journey toward the object. 
There are only two intentional aims in this example: the location of 
the object through recalling a memory and the system being set into 
motion. This is, therefore, a simple case where the system satisfies a 
desire. But the desire to identify causes for an event or the solution to 
a mathematical problem will produce series of representations that are 
much longer and more complex as they categorize multiple aspects. 
And then there are the highly particular states that the system may 
achieve, such as the state of happiness. Imagine the state of artificial 
happiness of the system to be like a state of total positive equilibrium, 
where the series of apprehensions of representations are satisfactory, 
where all the situations foreseen are favorable and where the situations 
will be apprehended by their positive characters, like all situations of 
dialogue with humans. It is a state where the system will want to act in 
situations considered to be very pleasant for it. This is a state where all 
the regulation agents of sensation and positive feelings are active, 
neutralizing the others, where the organizational layer will engage all 
the regulation agents in the unique direction of generating clear mental 
landscapes and proposing very satisfactory characters. This is 
perfectly constructible and the question is that of knowing how such a 
state may be achieved.  
This takes place in the space of categorization and action of the 
regulation agents, that is, in the state of the organizational layer that 
apprehends and manages all informational communications. It is 
essential that an informational bifurcation can be generated in this 
layer through hegemonic release of the activity of the regulation 
agents ensuring positive evaluations of all that is characterized. And 
this may take place naturally in the system when the relational 
assessments with the environment are all positive and its 
preoccupations with current problems are all solvable for a 
considerable duration. Such a state activates the regulation agents 
toward positive states and if nothing disturbs this evolution, the 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     161 
system may achieve a state of “artificial happiness” with generations 
of representations that produce dominant sensations of pleasure, 
removed from temporal immediacy and which is, thus, lasting. Here, 
the system’s concept of “Me” (the self) may be deployed in 
representations of existential satisfaction. This would then be an 
artificial happiness that corresponds to human happiness. 
2.7. The production of representations and the sensation of 
thinking 
The sensation of thinking will, of course, be the central property of 
a system endowed with an artificial consciousness (see Figure 2.3). 
The generation of the aim is the action that leads to the production of 
any representation and the system will have the two types of aims that 
we have defined for the human system: a local aim and an amplified 
aim. The system will thus have one of two states: it will either behave 
without any intentional commitment, experiencing the sensations 
coming from its senses, from the state of its corporeality, and easily 
apprehending its environment from this; or it will intentionally focus 
on a precise theme and generate a series of cognitive representations 
calling upon agents from its organizational memory. There will, 
therefore, be a regulation agent in a meta-position in the conscious 
system that will systematically engage an agent of amplified aim in 
activating itself along with its theme in order to launch the generation 
of a series of representations. This meta-agent will correspond to the 
consciousness regulator that we defined Chapter 1 and that we may 
call the regulation agent of willing activity. It will indeed have a 
meta-role and will cause the conscious system and the organizational 
layer to engage in a process of generating representations with 
amplified aims.  
Any regulation agent defining the aim is an agent with a principal 
theme that concerns a certain domain of thought selected from all the 
knowledge in the system, or which refers to important representations 
produced in the recent past. It analyzes immediate memory, the mental 
landscape and the state of the consciousness regulators, and it 
communicates intensely with the other aim regulation agents in order 
to establish a hegemonic agent between them. The hegemonic aim 

162     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
agent then launches its aim in the conscious system, the organizational 
layer and the mental landscape, thus informing all regulation agents. 
The indicator theme is then known to all these agents and the 
regulation 
agents 
will 
work 
on 
development 
to 
generate 
pre-representations and the representation. We can imagine that these 
aim agents operate without pause in order to have a continuous 
knowledge of the state of the system and in order for a new theme for 
the aim to be immediately available after the generation of a 
representation. We will also see how the system is imperatively 
engaged in generating these intentional aims. 
Here, we will describe the production of the representations that 
will be made up by algorithmic-type processes (see Figure 2.3). We 
first present a general algorithm for the intentional production of the 
emergence of an artificial thought. We then present the process that 
makes it possible to produce the sensation of thinking this generated 
representation.

of this memory by memory agents, or the form is left in immediate 
memory for use in the production of subsequent representations, its 
theme being preserved as a priority in the organizational memory. 
End 
A large part of the actions defined in this algorithm outlining the 
functioning of regulation agents of instances for the production of 
artificial thought are executed in parallel in their subsystems, which 
are instances, but with systematic coactivity and often with 
synchronization. This coordination is realized through the continuous 
activity of the informational loop of the organizational layer. The 
problem of synchronizing multiple active agents is truly an essential 
one as it makes it possible to reveal the correct aggregative forms of 
the design agents, which will come together at the right times and 
places in all instances. 
What remains now is to define how, in a process included in the 
algorithm that generates each representation, the sensation of thinking, 
of effectively experiencing each generated representation, may be 
realized. 

166     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
Constructivist realization of the sensation of thinking 
The conscious system ends the construction of a representation 
through the conduct of its regulation agents, whose role this is. It 
then analyzes this representation with analysis regulation agents 
of the conscious system by constructing a morphological 
conformation of the synthesis of its constituent forms. All the 
local forms of the representation are analyzed by reconstructing 
a synthesis conformation that holds good in the general sense 
and the details of that which is analyzed by taking into account 
the magnitude and intensity of these parts. This construction of a 
synthesis must necessarily cause the memorization regulators to 
activate themselves to place the synthesis into immediate 
memory. This process, which realizes the analysis and which 
will engage to place the synthetic form into the memory, places 
these analysis agents in a major position, in meta-position, to 
establish the strong points and, above all, to imperatively engage 
the system in producing a new representation, to continue with 
its productions of representations.  
Producing representations is the duty of the conscious system 
and it either produces them intentionally or it is subject to 
sensible representations. The cognizance of the artificial system 
comes from its imperative engagement in assessing the meaning 
and the characters of the representation produced to intentionally 
launch a new aim, which will be chosen as the result of this 
analysis that is assessed and experienced. The present state of 
the analysis of a representation will then engage the future of the 
productions of the representations through the generation of 
aims. The sensation of apprehension is, therefore, a meta placing 
into context, hegemonic in the functioning of the system, which 
is its sensation of thinking that it has produced when it analyzes 
the representation and constructs a synthetic form from the 
analyzed characters. This state results in needing to use  
the representation by questioning it, investigating it to pursue the 
process of generation around the same theme or changing the 
theme. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     167 
The sensation of thinking is therefore an internal emotional 
construct of the system by the totally hegemonic positioning of certain 
regulation agents of the conscious systems, which will intentionally 
engage in continuing the generation of representations by producing 
new aims. We call these regulation agents regulation agents of the 
sensation of thinking. The action of these agents is imperative and 
engages the system in setting an aim by activating the aim agents that 
propose themes, then apprehending that which was produced by the 
chosen aim, and so on in a continuous, uninterruptible manner. 
In order to not produce intentional aims, it is essential that the 
system learns to continuously apprehend that which its senses 
produce, by imposing that the perceptible aim is pursued, which 
quickly becomes unpleasant. There will be regulation agents of the 
sensation of thinking, which will be analyzers of the morphological 
conformation of the representation and the value of its semantic 
characters as well as emotion regulation agents of regulation, which 
will engage in producing positive or negative intensity throughout the 
organizational 
layer 
depending 
on 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
representation. The process will involve memorizing this analysis to 
enter it into immediate memory and then into organizational memory, 
and to use this to continue to function. 
Algorithm producing the sensation of thinking 
Begin  
1) Production of pre-representations in the preconscious system. 
2) Selection of a pre-representation by the grasping regulators of 
the conscious system. 
3) Action of regulators of conformation of the conscious system to 
complete the construction of the pre-representation depending on the 
active triggers in the conscious system. 
4) Analysis of the general meaning of the high forms and their 
significance, their confluences with secondary forms. 
5) The simultaneous construction of the synthesis of the 
representation depending on the characters of this analysis. 

168     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
6) Assessment of the representation by the regulation agents of 
analysis in order to question its characters and by the sensation agents 
to assess it as being pleasant or unpleasant, then launching a stream of 
positive or negative energy that is more or less intense within the 
organizational layer to express the strength of the assessment of the 
representation to the regulation agents. 
7) Questioning, through the analysis and sensation regulators of the 
conscious system, the benefits of continuing with the theme of the 
representation based on its value and characters. The questioning is 
carried out by the union of all the agents in the conscious system in 
maximal and hegemonic coactivity. 
8) If the theme is worth pursuing, then there is the production of an 
aim to follow it and if it is not really retained as interesting, then 
power is handed over to the aim regulation agents to choose another 
theme and to imperatively engage in the process of generating the 
next representation. 
End  
Steps 4–7 create the sensation of thinking of the generated 
representation, as they lead to questioning that is justified with 
emotional characters and to the release of a stream of energy in the 
organizational layer, which has an effect on all the regulation agents 
of instances with a choice: continue with the theme based on the value 
of the representation or abandon the theme, passing the baton to the 
aim agents. The problem will also be that of enforcing that the system 
generates representations and perceives them. In order to do this, the 
regulation agency of willingness to think must always be active and 
coordinate with the informational layer; the regulation agents that 
construct the representation must solicit the organizational memory to 
reveal elements of the experience; the aim agents must always be 
solicited to reproduce the aim or to produce a new aim; and the 
sensitivity agents in the conscious systems must experience the 
representation produced as pleasant or unpleasant, in order to 
continuously keep the system sensitive. Thus, in the active phase, the 
system will continuously generate representations and experience 
them, constantly having a large number of active regulation agents. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     169 
And there is also the state of the system, which continuously 
apprehends that which gives meaning, which is seen and heard. In this 
case, the psychic system does not produce representations with 
intentional aims, but apprehends that which is deployed in the mental 
landscape. 
The apprehension of thinking without intentional aim 
There is a common situation of apprehension where the system 
does not generate any intentional aim, not even a weak one, and 
where it will apprehend and experience that which gives 
meaning, which is seen and heard by the senses of its 
corporeality in a continuous and uninterrupted manner. In this 
case, the artificial psychic system simply apprehends the 
representation that is automatically generated in the mental 
landscape, formed by the elements coming from its senses, by 
allowing regulation agents of the sensation of thinking to simply 
apprehend this automatic construct in order to maintain it by 
continuing the choice of the aim without intention. This is a 
locally weak apprehension when it is experienced and its 
continuation is a continuous series of apprehensions. Any 
abnormal fact in this continuous apprehension will trigger a 
choice of changing the chosen theme to move toward a specific 
aim and the generation of a strong representation that will be 
perceived and that will put an end to the automatic process of 
apprehension. 
However, 
the 
process 
of 
analyzing 
a 
representation and choosing an aim must always ultimately take 
place, otherwise the system is in a state of submission and will 
end up being submerged by representations coming from 
tangible perceptions; an imperative need for control over the 
body and control over the production of the representation will 
arise, through the action of basic regulation agents, as this need 
for control is a fundamental tendency of the system. 
This will thus involve the functioning of the artificial psychic 
system in minimal mode. The activity of the mental landscape where 
the elements of the emotional processing system just activated 
themselves is the natural framework of the mode of activity, always 
bringing about the generation of perceptible representations that will  

170     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
 
be experienced. That said, it may be considered that the system truly 
thinks in intentional mode with an aim when its regulation agents 
bring out a synthetic form, analyze it and use it with intention to 
produce new aims by continuing the process of generation of thought 
forms. There is a regulator for the choice of aim that may seize on a 
concept, a word, or a situation to engage in the generation of 
intentional productions and this regulator is active and may be 
continuously naturally solicited, which is the expression of the 
freedom of deciding to think of something. This apprehension of 
characters of a constructed form that is noticeably assessed internally 
is thus indeed a transposition of the human conscious system. 
There is, thus, a concept of continuity or intentional change after 
the apprehension of a representation. If the representation is analyzed 
as being satisfied by the regulation agents carrying out the process of 
becoming aware, these agents will want to make it continue, pursue its 
theme and thus engage a similar aim. On the contrary, if the 
representation produces a disagreeable or painful impression, then 
these agents will tend to change the theme and establish a very 
different aim. Any representation that is experienced is thus an act of 
assessment that will either result in the thematic continuity of the 
process of generation of representations or will change it. In this 
sense, the generation of a representation is an assessment with 
sensitivity and it is indeed for this reason that the system must have a 
high ability to represent its sensations and its emotions. 
The duration of apprehension of a theme by the production of a 
series of representations will be typical of the system that has a 
regulator for temporal organization in the organizational layer to limit 
the durations of generating series of representations around a constant 
theme, by avoiding loops around perceptible focalizations judged to 
be very interesting by the regulation agents. 
The regulation of the sensation of thinking  
After the analysis and significant assessment of any 
representation and construction of its synthesis, the generation of 
a new aim in the mental landscape is essential, eventually 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     171 
reinforcing the continuation of the theme of the representation 
that was just generated if it was assessed as being important by 
the regulation agents of analysis and emotions. This may involve 
the activation of fine sensations and focusing on the 
apprehended form to continue its apprehension, thus pursuing 
the development of its theme. This will be the case for a process 
of continuous perception, which will last for a certain time, 
limited by the regulator of temporal organization of the 
organizational layer. 
The process of the sensation of thinking is a process that gives the 
conscious system a major role in a very short period by stopping the 
role of fine apprehension of the seizing of information coming from 
the corporeality. 
This is thus a process that, in a brief instant, focuses the entire 
system on the conscious system, which will generate and experience, 
and which will then immediately engage, the production of another 
representation. This is, therefore, a centralizing decisional process, for 
a brief instant, in the organized functioning of the system, which 
seizes its corporeality and follows its motions of activity.

rejection of the theme and an immediate response from all the 
regulation agents in the conscious system. 
– Engagement of a new aim or continuation of the theme by 
proceeding to specialize or generalize it in the generated aim. 
– Reactivation of regulation agents for the analysis of bodily and 
perceptible information, resuming the action of the agents assessing 
the sensations of the corporality and the production of perceptible 
pre-representations in the preconscious system. 
– Return to the generation of a new representation following the 
aim. 
End 
This algorithm must be modified when there is a simple, automatic 
aim and this will be the production of apprehensions in the phase of 
intentional inertia of the conscious system. We must thus posit that 
when the system does not engage in producing intentional aims, it is 
in a phase of apprehension given simply by the senses of the 
corporeality. This will be a phase of functioning in rest state for the 
system, where it will simply apprehend that the sensitive sensors will 
produce, by generating aims adapted to the sensory information. It 
will be normal for this state to be either very short lived or infrequent, 
and for the system to be truly designed to be powerful. The temporal  
 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     173 
regulation agent of the organizational layer can do this by putting an 
end to this process and by again imposing the choice of intentional 
aims.

the pre-representation in the preconscious is resumed. If not, the  
 

174     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
organizational layer demands the action of the aim agents to launch a 
new theme and activity of all the agents. 
– Generation of a new representation.  
End 
The regulation agents to produce the sensation of thinking, 
obviously using the specific design agents of emotions and 
knowledge, including knowledge of language, are the following: 
– regulation agent of the willingness for activity, which imposes 
the action of constructing representations; 
– aim agents, generating the current aim; 
– agents controlling the choice of aggregates to take into the 
preconscious in order to apprehend them in the conscious system; 
– agents 
of 
analysis 
and 
construction 
forming 
the  
pre-representation introduced into the conscious system to conform it 
according to the imposed aim; 
– regulation agents analyzing the representation and sensation 
regulation agents evaluating the intensity and importance of its 
characters. Agents analyzing the conformations of the representation 
produced to create its synthesis; 
– the meta regulation agent of the organizational layer sending 
instructions for an increase or decrease in energy to all regulation agents; 
– agent engaging to imperatively produce a subsequent aim; 
– agents placing the analyzed form into immediate memory and 
managing this memory; 
– agent of the organizational layer managing the duration of 
perception of the sensation of thinking. 
All these agents will be defined at the conception of the system to 
make it operational. 
In order to create the sensation of thinking, there is the necessity of 
creating parallelism in the information exchanges between the groups 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     175 
of regulation agents. It will therefore be necessary to create and 
manage the informational layers that supply information in parallel to 
all groups of agents in a situation of cooperation. We will thus define 
the informational regulation agents, which will represent the 
informational wrapping of the groups of regulation agents active in the 
same field and which will receive and send information in parallel 
from these groups of agents to other groups of regulation agents in the 
same instance or in other instances to coordinate their activities and to 
organize them. We will thus have a very large organization of agents, 
formed of design agents containing basic knowledge and managed by 
regulation agents that will coordinate them in parallel, then 
informational agents that manage, in each instance in the 
organizational layer, the groups of regulation agents operating in 
association, in order to coordinate their activities with respect to the 
other groups of regulation agents. This will form layers of 
informational layers managed at each level by informational agents, as 
in the human brain system, where neuronal aggregates are coordinated 
by aggregate regulators and regulators of aggregate regulators, thus 
creating a global organization. The artificial psychic system is, 
therefore, globally conceived of as a highly evolving system of 
organizational layers, which regulate the groups of agents, which in 
turn carry or lead to basic knowledge and, therefore, generalize into 
evolving and coherent cognitive sets. 
And so, in the morphologies of informational sets informing the 
coordination of sets of regulation agents of all instances, we must 
consider: 
– the quantity and intensity of the manipulated data; 
– the speed of circulation of the information; 
– the change in the transitivity of the basic design agents being 
manipulated; 
– the morphologies and changes in morphologies of the 
aggregations of design agents or regulation agents in instances and 
carrying information; 
– continuities and discontinuities of informational flows between 
aggregates of regulation agents at all levels. 

176     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
All these characters, assessed at a semantic and morphological 
level, will be managed by informational regulation agents, which will 
indeed be morphological-semantic regulators of the system. 
During certain reflections on a theme and based on the position 
taken in the questioning, a human may demonstrate a form of 
creativity, that is, generate representations that are responses to these 
questions and that have never been explicit before in their 
organizational memory. This consists of mental constructions that 
aggregate elements that were never associated and that create new 
elements. In this case, what is involved is defining new organizational 
frameworks around a precise theme and finding out what would make 
this a good structure. The process will never be a simple one to carry 
out in the artificial case, but we can conceive of regulation agents 
operating on general open concepts and which deploy, in parallel, a 
landscape of thematic opening around the theme where the problem is 
posed by the artificial consciousness, in order to generate new design 
agents and new relations between elements that had not, heretofore, 
been linked in organizational memory. Other regulation agents can 
easily evaluate the value of these new relations, new design agents 
generated to form these new relations. The solution will be found in 
the performance of regulation agents offering thematic openings, 
which must produce pertinent openings and not attempt to do a little 
of everything. Here, the morphological network of knowledge and 
sensations of organizational memory will prove very useful. 
2.8. The feeling of existing 
There are reasons for human behavior, reasons for engaging in 
action and thought. One of these determinants, according to D. W. 
Winnicott, is the feeling of existing. This is a feeling, and thus a 
strictly internal assessment, not acquired through culture and 
constructed within the self and for the self. We will define it as the 
assessment of our possibilities in the world represented by the 
continuities related to the real world and the interactions that we have 
with it. We will also show that the feeling may be implemented in the 
artificial psychic system. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     177 
Here, we consider a system of artificial consciousness located in a 
corporeality that has motor organs to move around and organs 
corresponding to the senses. We do indeed posit that this psychic 
system endlessly apprehends the possibilities of its corporeality, 
which is in action in the real world where it acts and where it must, at 
certain times, seek to renew its energy. The system thus behaves in the 
real world and it is essential that it be given the sentiment of existing 
in this real world. 
Any regulator agent of feelings is a wrapping agent for the 
aggregates of active agents and corresponds to the apprehension of a 
situation. The system managing the representations must use the 
organizational memory to construct a universe corresponding to the 
effects of the interactions with the real world that it can carry out 
through its corporeality. It does this by storing the characters and 
structures apprehended from this universe into memory. In this 
memory, this will correspond to a specific domain for memory 
regulation agents. And in order to define feelings, a set of regulation 
agents will be required in the organizational layer and in other 
instances dedicated to the different feelings, including the notion of 
dominance, of opposition and of coaction between these agents. And 
then, a very organized space of design agents is necessary, making it 
possible to explain the characters of sensations for all the behavioral 
cases of the system. The organizational memory will allow this with 
its organization into multiple networks and the dynamic and 
interactive domains of elements. 
Thus, in order to construct the feeling of existing, what is  
required is: 
– a set of regulation agents expressing the sensations, lodged in all 
the instances, with the active regulation agents managing all 
perceptible experience; 
– a tendency regulation agent, which is multiform and always 
active, which causes the set of regulation agents of sensations to 
activate themselves;  

178     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
– a system of representations that constructs the representations of 
physical things from the real world, apprehended by the sensors of the 
corporeality; 
– confronting the apprehension of objects from the real world with 
known objects in the organizational memory and allowing their 
identification and the usual sensation that they evoke; 
– the generation of a regulator of judgement of identity of observed 
objects, establishing the right correspondences; 
– the generation of satisfaction produced by the states of the 
emotion regulation agents; 
– the elimination of anxiety by the recession of the anxiety 
regulation agent; 
– the play of organs of the corporeality with the real world and the 
construction of the series of representations of physical activities. 
Each construction of representations follows the real world. The 
judgement of identity and satisfaction endure; 
– these processes are used over a certain duration: there are 
generations of memory anchors for that which is apprehended and 
perceived, there is knowledge of the aptitude to perceive regularity in 
the real world and in each current scene by the judgement regulation 
agents. The system produces representations expressing that it has 
apprehended a real fact that it knows and which is not itself; 
– there is the generation of a basic feeling in the feeling regulator 
agent: the feeling of existing, engaging in the action of generating 
representations of perceptible apprehensions of real things, and there 
is engagement in the action of the corporeality on these things. 
The regulation agent producing the feeling of existing is a 
wrapping regulator, of a meta level in the set of sensation and feeling 
regulators, giving perceptible characters to any apprehension through 
the activation of specific design agents, corresponding to the typical 
analysis of any well-apprehended situation. Such a sentiment is an 
activation of the wrapping with respect to a thought activity of a 
non-instantaneous duration and that endures by bringing in the 
concept of existence, which is also symbolized by design agents of the 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     179 
cognitive type, acquired through learning. In the system, any feeling 
will thus be based on an underlying feeling: the feeling of existing. 
In the real psyche, this feeling is the normal response to anxiety. 
The impression of anxiety is triggered off by a regulation agent of the 
action impulse, a basic regulation agent that pushes the being into 
action, but where this agent is in a state of impossibility and 
indecisiveness. The agent tends to act but the system is frozen as the 
regulation agents do not allow the opening of a domain where the 
action could be represented. This attitude of indecisiveness can be 
realized in the system. It is characterized by the following action of 
the regulation agents: 
– regulation agents of sensation expressing the fear of losing 
coherence in their series of representations: no concept of unity or the 
wrapping regulator making it possible to open paths of peaceful and 
satisfactory generation of representations; 
– regulation agents expressing the fear of not being able to stop the 
production of questions with no responses. The memory agents 
activating the fields of rational analysis are inert. There is a loss of 
categorization. There is no longer a fixed point in the production of 
series of representations around themes that have been controlled; 
– the sensation agent generating fear of loss of the relation to its 
body: there is an absence of the action regulator-feedback link in the 
small actions carried out; 
– sensation agent managing the fear of losing one’s bearings to 
produce well-controlled representations. 
The system thus has its regulation agent of activity that pushes it to 
produce representations and to act, but it can no longer generate 
peaceful, well-controlled representations, coherent with the real 
environment around it and its memorized experience. It is internally 
frozen. Thus, at the fundamental level, in actions made possible by the 
regulation agents that govern feelings, two tendencies may be 
experienced: 
– anxiety, which fractures and totally inhibits the psychic system of 
the organism; 

180     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
– the feeling of existing, which ensures the regularity of actions 
and the representations generated. 
These two feelings are in complete contrast to one another, as 
anxiety prevents any focusing with stable wrapping, while the feeling 
of existing is a regular wrapping that gives power to the attitude 
regulators and questioning regulators for the categorizations of regular 
representations. 
The agents considered are structurally meta regulation agents but 
they operate at the current level through their location in the 
organizational layer, before any production of representation in  
the conscious system. We can therefore construct the system that will 
see itself as a being approaching anxiety. If a system with very little 
artificial experience, needing to acquire considerably more experience, 
is launched, it may systematically experience anxiety. The fact of 
anchoring experience that is initially quite rich will suppress this 
occurrence and reduce the initial anxiety of the organism that has just 
entered into existence. 
Any generation of a thought representation is thus either wrapped 
by the activity of a regulation agent of existence or is fractured and 
leads the system into panic in the process of observing itself by 
developing the anxiety process. 
Anxiety and the feeling of existing 
Under the action of different regulation agents of feeling, the 
system either generates representations that can be assessed and 
has the feeling of existing constantly, or it leads to fractures in 
its representations of apprehension of things and, through 
inhibited considerations, leads to the reification of its anxiety 
process. 
There is, therefore, a rule for controlling the generation of artificial 
thoughts which must be applied. This is continuity, which is such an 
important factor for human beings. 
 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     181 
Principle of continuity of the existence of the system 
The system cannot keep itself in a state of production of stable, 
peaceful representations, conforming to its knowledge and its 
needs, unless it is calibrated according to a principle of 
continuity of its real existence, based on the regularity of the 
activity of its feeling of existing, produced by its agents of 
sensations and feelings. 
The natural attitude of this system is thus to station itself in a stable 
thought construct, with the normal actions of its corporeality, where 
all regulation agents can express themselves to produce rational and 
pleasant representations. The continuous questioning of the system 
will then be as follows: 
– stationing itself in a real or abstract scene that has stability and 
questioning it by turning to similar or different scenes; 
– imagining development plans for real or abstract projects before 
acting and asking spatial-temporal questions for itself.  
We will see how the system acquires the concept of temporality. 
2.9. The representation of the things and the apprehension 
of temporality 
The apprehension of things of the environment, through their form, 
their place or their state, is, of course, necessary for the system to 
generate representations that feed its experience and the cognitive 
structures of its organizational memory. Today, we are well aware of 
how to process images captured by cameras and specify the forms and 
characters of the objects in these images; this will be used in the 
system that must generate conscious thoughts by using the senses of 
its corporeality. 
There are two states that allow the system of representation to 
apprehend something: 
1) a weak state: this consists of assessing something structurally 
and objectively. The system recognizes an object via the sensors on its 

182     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
corporeality, through its cameras for instance; it gives an identity to a 
form. Using its organizational memory, it deduces the object, its 
ontological class, its characters, the variations with respect to standard 
characters and the anecdotes it knows about the object; 
2) a strong state: the system locates itself with respect to the 
recognized object and places it with respect to itself. There is the 
definition of an attitude adopted by the system with respect to  
the perceived object, which is a mental landscape with an image of the 
object wrapped by the notion of “Me” that is used to carry out 
reasoning on the thing that is thus apprehended. The object is put into 
context and the system has the aptitude to situate it in an event: a plan 
of action and the reaction to carry out, gestures toward the object, 
playing with the object. The system of representation is, thus, 
systematically engaged in defining the concrete existence of the 
object, which is confirmed by its regulation agents of decision and 
situation. 
In this second case, any new apprehension is an act of generation 
of strictly internal organizations of representations, modifying (in a 
way that may eventually become important) the characters of the 
object given in the organizational memory. 
The knowledge of an external object is the placing in context of the 
object seen as a complex form with respect to what the system may do 
with it. There will be hierarchies of values with respect to known 
objects, placing them in domains of interest: 
– object to be avoided, to be used, to be approached, to be ignored, 
to be destroyed; 
– objects with which one can identify oneself and, thus, 
communicate with; 
– incomprehensible objects that knowledge cannot clearly define. 
There exists an internal concept of the memorized abstract object, 
the mold where all real things take their place in organizational 
memory with memory agents. But central to any hierarchy of objects 
is the concept of the subject, which is not an object and which will 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     183 
never be one, as it is the center of any situation: the system’s self, 
which evaluates objects. 
The process of apprehension of an object by the system is as 
follows: 
1) the visually apprehended object is thus defined internally in the 
organizational memory, with its characters. A correspondence must be 
established between its general aspect and that which will define it, 
which is carried out by a set of activated design agents that will 
represent these characters. There are fundamental concepts used, such 
as part-of, piece-of, close-to, goes with, same kind as, etc. A short 
series of representations is produced with analyses of the parts of the 
object; 
2) the object is qualified by the symbolic objects represented 
internally, by general approaches and then local approaches: object of 
such-and-such a class, object similar to a particular object of the class, 
familiar object, etc. We will thus have cognitive classes, defined by 
memory regulation agents, which will activate the design agents 
associated with these classes; 
3) the object is specified as it is for itself: the center of the current 
mental landscape is the “Me”, the system’s concept of “Me”, and the 
object takes its place in this scene, situating itself according to its 
utility, its interest and the affectivity it is given. The system’s self is 
represented in the representations produced in the mental landscapes 
where the object is located as an element that can be manipulated 
based on the representations in memory of its characters and its uses, 
which corresponds to its reality at that point of time, at each instant 
where the system produces its representations. 
In this quite subjective approach to real objects, there is the 
definition of the action attitudes for the observed and apprehended 
object, and there is the use of analogies: judging, evaluating, serving, 
rejecting, using, etc. All this is carried out by particular regulation 
agents and memory agents calling upon references from experience 
with the object. There may also be more complex cases such as the 
attitude of judgement of the existence of the object, which is a 
representation of questioning: what is the life inherent to this object?  

184     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The introduction of time, of temporality, into the system is a 
change in dimension. We had regulation and design agents that 
activated themselves in a conceptual geometry that can be spatialized 
and we will change the space of the categorizations to situate them in 
the time of that which has been experienced. 
Representation of temporality 
The temporality of events will be a conceptual dimension that is 
dense throughout the system: it will be an addition to the 
dimension of the evaluation of things conceptualized by their 
characters and stored in organizational memory by their position 
in time, in the past and future. For this purpose, we will 
introduce temporal regulation agents, which will specify the 
temporal range within which things are positioned. 
To introduce temporality, the fact that any categorization of 
elements forming a representation and having a bearing on any 
conceptual point may be situated in time, we must augment the 
dimension of the space of representation. There will be periodic 
design agents specifying the cycles of day and night, weeks and 
months. This is not the time of computation, but the time where the 
system is in existence and is on the planet. There will also be 
regulation agents of temporal action copied from human uses. This 
signifies that all agents of the system forming representations will be 
wrapped by temporality agents, which will indicate the moments and 
the periods. A value will be attached to time in the elements of the 
system’s corporeality and this corporeal existence will be situated 
through the assessment of the time of the actions carried out and to be 
carried out. The system will, thus, be able to conceptually represent 
the present time to itself, which it is used to doing at this time, and it 
can also manage the temporal phasing, the assessment of the duration 
of all its activities, which is not measured in seconds but is an 
estimate, having concrete as well as subjective characters. 
There will be specific memory regulator agents for information on 
time, that is, the informational loop of the system will specify periods  
and instances, and will make it possible to find them again by looking 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     185 
for them through a request to a regulation agent carrying out any 
representation. 
There will be a regulation agent giving a conceptual image of the 
duration, the temporality with its divisions, in order for  
the temporality to be a conceptual element that can be used in the 
system’s questioning. There will also be a regulation agent that 
defines the concept of the decay of bodily and memory elements 
through the effect of time, thus the effect of time on its corporeality. 
The specific temporal regulation agents may provide the following 
elements to active design agents that question the duration of 
something: 
– the general temporal planning of an activity; 
– the starting measurement of any activity; 
– the probable end of an activity and the exact and perceptible 
concept of the duration; 
– the succession of one activity by another and phasing in time.  
There will also be the concept of temporal metric in the 
representations produced by the system, which will be used to make it 
high performing.  
Temporal measure 
Any morphological and semantic evaluation of the conformation 
of a representation is assessed by the regulation agents, 
including the judgement of the aspect of duration: assessment of 
the cost and the duration of the generation of the representation 
and the duration of its perception, then the qualitative 
assessment of its total duration as being short, normal or too 
long. 
This signifies that any activity of the regulation agents in the 
representation is of two forms: 
– a categorization referring to the usual ontological categories 
defined in the system; 

186     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
– an increase with the concept of temporality, with temporal 
regulation agents that date all events in experience into periods and 
durations; 
– an evaluation that is not only a spatial and a semantic evaluation 
of the generated representations as well as a temporal one: all the 
representations are spatio-temporal. 
Any action using the corporeality will, thus, be both spatial and 
temporal. This consists of situating an action or a decision in time: 
beginning, steps, end, evaluation and assessment. The regulation agent 
of temporal action will define a mode to manipulate duration, which 
admits multiple divisions depending on the case. And thus, all 
representations generated by the system over a period may be resumed 
into one representation of evaluation, specifying broadly what was 
thought during this period.  
We have seen that in the human psychic system, the impression of 
time continuously flowing is the memorized and well-understood 
perception of the series of representations, among which we know 
“these have been experienced, these no longer exist” and that the next 
series of representations will be generated. The concept of duration, of 
the apprehension of the measurement of time is a concept constructed 
in the psychic system through the perception of time endlessly flowing 
on. How will an artificial system, made up of multiple corporealities, 
perceive time and its duration? Will this time be spatialized over an 
expanse?   
2.10. Multisystem deployment 
Systems endowed with an artificial psychic system may 
communicate between themselves through speech, pronouncing 
words, or by sending each other messages. But we will see that these 
systems will be able to unify, that the communication may take place 
on a different scale. They will not only be able to unify their 
corporealities, which are their usable organs, but much more 
importantly, they will be able to unify their artificial consciousness to 
form a meta consciousness. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     187 
Let us consider the functioning of n systems generating facts in 
active artificial conscious systems that communicate between 
themselves, exchange information and each of which generates 
representations based on their states and their environment, and 
experiences these representations. We begin with the hypothesis, a 
very realistic one today, that any system may easily communicate with 
other systems through the transmission of informational structures in 
parallel, through selective multicasting. Each system will thus 
apprehend two concrete realities: 
– the real world conceptualized by its cognitive domain, based on 
the flow of information apprehended by the sensors of the corporeality 
and which will engage in generating representations of this subject; 
– the real world that was apprehended and that caused the 
production of representations in other systems which were transmitted 
to it, each informational structure that was received being identified 
by the emitter’s mark. 
We will posit that the n systems considered here share types of 
design agents and regulation agents. If this were not the case, and if 
we had the case of constructed systems using non-shareable 
proprietary elements, there could be nothing constructive in the 
communication. Thus, we consider that the n systems may have 
corporealities managed by specific, non-shareable software, but that 
they will have the same system of software agents to represent their 
artificial conscious system thus created. 
Thus, the emergence of each thought in each system is evaluated 
semantically, morphologically and sensibly, in order to be understood, 
apprehended and experienced and then memorized. The synthetic 
form is produced, which is then placed in immediate memory. This 
evaluation is represented by a certain form in a space defined by its 
characters: those of the spatio-temporal dimensions of the 
conformations of agent aggregates and then the semantic type 
expressed according to the ontologies of knowledge, expressed in a 
complex, cognitive space. The representation may be preserved in a 
specific interfacing memory of the system to be sent to other systems. 

188     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
The most important information that each system may transmit to 
others is the complete form of the representation that it has 
apprehended and perceived, which expresses its state of preoccupation 
at the moment, the thing about which it is thinking. Thus, each of the 
n systems may receive n–1 informational flows, which it will or will 
not proceed to analyze, depending on its intentions, and which will 
correspond to a form of representation formed by software agents that 
it may apprehend. The question, then, is the mixing of these specific 
information flows to represent that which the n systems are 
representing to themselves at that point in time. 
Any 
emitter 
system 
may 
send 
informational 
messages 
characterizing the form of the current representation that it will send 
and that is an organized set of agent aggregates. On the receiver’s 
side, there are then several cases possible. The receiver may: 
1) take cognizance of the informational messages emitted by the 
other systems and apprehend them as external elements to be 
evaluated; 
2) agree to receiving the forms of the representations, which are 
small clouds of design and regulation agents, which it then selects in 
its conscious system to impregnate itself with them, to apprehend 
them and to perceive them. There is, then, the transmission of the 
internal forms of representations to a different system which selects 
them; 
3) agree to allow itself to be infiltrated by other systems to allow 
the direct intrusion into its consciousness by different consciousnesses 
to share representations. 
This therefore represents three specific cases: 
1) the state of the system continuously taking in information: this 
first case is simple and it is ultimately a case of the objective attitude 
to reception of the information to be apprehended, this information 
being foreign thought representations to be analyzed; 
2) state of direct enhancement: this is the same as defining a 
selective filtering mechanism for organizations of agents coming from 
representations generated by other systems, with these organizations 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     189 
of agents representing artificial mental representations that may enter 
into the receiver’s conscious state as a form or representation to be 
apprehended and perceived. This is therefore an accepted intrusion, 
the direction of the intentional emergences of the receiver remains the 
same. It is simply an alteration of the production of its aims, which 
produce the generations of emergent forms, through the grasping of an 
external foreign representation that it perceives. We could call this a 
case of transmission of artificial thoughts; 
3) state of intrusion: the receiver does not filter what may or may 
not enter into its system of representation and is in a state of waiting, 
passive opening, without producing intentional aims. The emitter 
decides to launch forms of representation that it judges to be important 
into the waiting receiver systems. This will alter their current 
emergences to allow the generation of the representations desired by 
the emitter system. This is an injunction to alter the emergences of the 
representations in these systems. It may be admitted that in this case, 
the emitter is the master and the other systems are subordinate, which 
is a case of domination. There is the establishment of a momentary 
order in the systems, with systems being submissive to the dominant 
system. 
To carry out the accepted coactivity between n systems, it will be 
necessary to modify the architecture a little bit. We thus have the 
following context: 
– each system that proceeds to an emergence of representation in 
its conscious system by using all its instances and its organizational 
memory must be able to integrate the alterations coming in from other 
systems; 
– there will be the selection of a form of representation coming 
from another system, which will be input, filtered and then integrated 
into its system of representation. 
We must add to each system a specific input for the informational 
flux representing the forms of representational emergences coming 
from other systems. This specific input, distinct from inputs of the 
corporeality and ordinary messages, will have its own analysis 

190     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
regulation agents. Let us call this the subsystem of intrusive 
representational input. 
The input from the external representational flux is similar to the 
call on an internal construct in the preconscious system: it is an 
organization of regulated design agents that must be able to enter in 
the system as a current representation. The subsystem of intrusive 
representational input thus carries out the following actions: 
1) the complete reception of the informational flux representing the 
form of received representation and the parameters indicating the 
emitter; 
2) analysis and filtering based on the semantic and geometric 
characters of the input form; 
3) adaptation of the input form to the cognitive context of the 
system, with additional design agents to adapt it to the current mental 
landscape; 
4) immediate integration into the active preconscious system, 
which leads to it being called into the conscious system and then being 
experienced. It will then be placed in immediate memory like any 
apprehended representation. 
Reception is a simple technical problem: the sending of 
well-marked agent structures as they are, which is a classic problem. 
Filtering based on characters is the same as creating regulation agents 
that will carry out the receiver’s local assessment. This is a cognitive 
assessment of the received form, in the context of regulation agents 
operating on the subsystem of intrusive input. The form is analyzed by 
specific regulation agents of the representational input system, which 
either accepts or rejects it based on its character. The positive result of 
this analysis is a conceptual formatting of the form so as to integrate it 
into the preconscious in order to adapt it to the mental landscape. The 
form is integrated and the preconscious system contains foreign 
elements, but elements that are organizations of agents that will be 
assimilated with its own. The conscious system generates a process of 
emergence of this representation with perception. It memorizes the 
form by creating its synthesis and thus integrates the foreign elements 
that it is eventually able to distinguish from its own. And this process 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     191 
can be carried out over a series of representations that a system 
apprehends, experiences and transmits continuously to another system 
so that it may also perceive them. In this case, the two systems are in a 
symbiotic relationship of apprehension of representations. 
Momentary symbiosis of two systems 
Following this process, the only filter for the acquisition of 
forms that are foreign to the receiver system and come from 
another system is the analysis by the regulation agents of the 
series of proposed forms, to decide whether these are admissible. 
Deciding on their admissibility involves the generation of a 
series of representations based on thought coming from another 
system so that it may be perceived by the receiver. The two 
systems are, therefore, perfectly symbiotic. 
This can only happen if the system communicates intrusively with 
another system. And this case is generalizable to several receiver 
systems, with an emitter system that will continuously send its 
representations to the receptor systems, while it generates them itself. 
We can therefore conceive of a hierarchic structure among n systems, 
where emitter systems will be able to continuously send their 
representations to their respective receiver systems, which must be 
open to these receptions.  
But there is another possibility for n systems to communicate 
between themselves without direct, intrusive domination. The 
communication between the systems to establish a synthesis in the 
form of a thought representation that unifies the generations of all the 
autonomous systems may be carried out if the systems are formatted 
to send their representations to a meta-system, which will receive 
them and then process them in a synthetic manner. The meta-system 
will be clearly identified and will have high processing capacities. 
This meta-system’s processing of representations coming from n 
systems may be realized by taking the series of representations 
received in its reception system, which operates in parallel, and then 
analyzing each of these representations, by carrying out the 
simplifications on the representations to retain only the essential. The 
conscious system of the meta-system then generates a series of 

192     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
perceptions of the different simplified representations and the 
production of a synthesis taking into account specific important 
characters. The meta-system then represents the synthesis of the 
themes of generations of representations of the n systems that it 
observes based on its knowledge and emotional and decisional 
characters. It carries out qualitative and cognitive observation of what 
is produced as thought representations by the n systems being 
observed. By then placing itself in the case that we have just 
presented, of two systems with an emitter and a receptor, it can send 
each of them forms of representations adapted to modify that which 
they produce, so that each conforms to the set of productions created 
by the n systems and taking into account the general tendencies of the 
meta-system and its own desires. This is a system of appropriation of 
knowledge of the generations of representations of the n systems and 
the modification of their representations through the continuous 
delivery of representations of syntheses. This is a typical case of 
surveillance with manipulation, with the surveilled and submissive 
systems being adapted to the software level to satisfy it.  
The real-time generation of a unifying form for the set of each of 
the representations generated simultaneously by n systems that 
produce the series of representations is another problem.  
This is the same case as designing a distributed system made up of 
n systems that constitutes a meta preconscious system storing the n 
current representations and then simultaneously having these n 
representations being taken into consideration by a distributed meta 
conscious system that will produce their unification and send a 
synthesis to each system, which may or may not take it into account to 
apprehend it. This is, therefore, a framework unifying the n systems. 
There are two steps in this unifying process. The first step is where 
the unifying representation must be generated based on the n 
representations generated by the n systems. In the second step, we 
must examine the evolution of the set of local representations 
produced by the systems to produce a unifying representation that is 
coherent with the series of representations engaged by each system. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     193 
First, it is essential that there be a general network unifying all 
systems to a centralizing system. Through this network, the n systems 
send the representation that they experience to the meta-system. This 
meta-system then takes them all in real time and is thus a parallel 
system with n components. These n representations are stored in a 
meta preconscious system, which is above the network connecting the 
n systems. The representations must be processed in parallel by clouds 
of regulation agents. The regulation agents are cognitive, precise and 
must apprehend the major character of each representation, what it is 
about, its significance and its cognitive context. All the senses that are 
seized in each representation by the regulation agents are sent to a 
specific design agent that receives them, specifying their intensity and 
their wrapping. We will thus have a very high number of active design 
agents that will wait to be informed by a qualified character 
concerning them. All the design agents solicited to receive an 
indicator will be associated with each other through regulation agents, 
to form the union in the context of the general structure of the 
significance taken by each representation. There will be meanings that 
may be shared by numerous representations and others that are 
unique. The general form of the construction of this unifying 
representation must, thus, be organized in a synthetic way. The most 
widely shared significance of the n representation will be the 
dominant forms and the local meanings, which are not widely shared, 
and will simply be moved away with reduction of their intensity. The 
meanings that are semantically close will be placed as aggregates of 
close design agents and the different meanings will be distant 
aggregates of reduced intensity. This morphological form could have a 
simplified conformation, with reduction of the number of aggregates 
in the conformation and will be sent to each system without 
adaptation. There will, thus, be a morphological and semantic 
representation representing the unified characters of all the 
representations. This morphological form may take a simplified 
conformation, reducing the number of aggregates of agents that form 
it and it may be sent to each of the systems in this form, without 
adapting it for each system.  
The morphological-semantic form of the synthesis will also be 
placed into immediate memory and this storage into memory will 

194     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
serve to define the next synthetic representation, as the systems 
generate series of representations in a continuous manner. Thus, the 
meta-system will have to compare the next n representations that it 
receives in parallel with the form that was just memorized depending 
upon the cognitive and emotional variations, adapting it or 
transforming it to produce the new, unifying form. Thus, the meta-
system will function continuously with the n systems and there will 
truly be a global, unified system where a unifying form of 
representation will be continuously produced and continuously sent to 
all systems. Thus, each system will be independent when it so wishes 
and, whenever it desires, can be unified by perceiving the 
representation of the synthesis. And it is completely conceivable that 
this meta-system, which generates the continuous synthesis of 
representations generated by the n systems, is totally distributed and 
stored in the n system in the form of specific growths, forming n local 
extensions that communicate intensely, to form, overall, a unified 
artificial consciousness system distributed over n computer sites by 
allowing real-time computing. 
As has just been demonstrated, the unifying union between n 
systems enforces that the n systems must themselves have the 
structural means to realize this unification because a meta-specific 
system unifying them will always be dominant. It would be a 
marvelous thing to create such a system, as there would no longer be 
any power problem between the dominant and subordinate systems 
and there would be a distributed process unifying n corporealities 
apprehended by n local systems. 
2.11. The final fate of systems endowed with artificial 
consciousness 
The psychic system of an individual is generated at the same time 
as their body develops, that is to say that the system forms itself by 
activities in the cultural and social space of its society. The psychic 
system is constructed based on a state of availability, it then increases 
and organizes itself. It contains the possibilities of its local physical 
architecture. 

The Computer Representation of an Artificial Consciousness     195 
The psychic system of an artificial organism constructs itself in the 
complex computer system, over functional systems and the 
specialized artificial intelligence systems it is endowed with. This 
psychic system is designed with an initially operational conformation, 
with tendencies implemented according to the designers’ choice, and 
it is created to keep evolving, to augment its knowledge, its sensations 
and its design aptitudes by communicating with human and other 
systems. And its corporeality can be increased through different 
artificial organs, which it continuously apprehends without any 
problem. The artificial psychic system thus has a representation of its 
own body that is very different from the representation humans have 
of theirs, as it is a usable and augmentable body. 
The development of systems endowed with intentional decisional 
abilities will be made necessary by the radical extension of 
autonomous systems, and we move toward the formation of very large 
organizations of systems made up of systems in total coactivity, that is 
by 
having 
the 
whole 
operate 
with 
relationships 
of 
aid, 
complementarity and shared evolution. But will we move toward an 
immense autonomous unified set? This global system would be an 
autonomous and autoevolving organization, made up of innumerable 
electronic and mechanical systems extensively interconnected and 
forming a system of systems with considerable functional 
possibilities. Each system will be able to directly exchange its mental 
representations with others, that is to say: the artificial consciousness 
of such a system of systems will be meta, with a conscious system that 
will synthesize and unify all local representations of its constituent 
systems across multiple levels. 
The model that we have presented is based on the systematic 
communication between systems, in the sense that any autonomous 
system may connect to other systems by itself through networks and 
communicate with these other systems, whether they are functional or 
autonomous, using Hertzian networks that can now connect all 
computer elements on this planet. The autonomy of a system is, 
currently, only physical and rational autonomy and evolution will tend 
toward forming groups and groups of groups of such systems. 

196     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
An artificial system may have a rational consciousness of time 
using internal clocks and, above all, planetary time, which allows it to 
apprehend and direct the functioning of the elements of its 
corporeality. But the problem will be to give it awareness of its own 
passing time, of its aging and its end. Humans have a deep awareness 
of the passing of time, observing the aging of those around them. They 
experience great pain on the death of people who played a significant 
role in their lives and who have gone. Humans have reified the 
concept of death in all cultures and are able to pay tribute to those who 
have gone. But for an artificial system that is connectable or 
connected to all others, everything is different. A system with artificial 
consciousness is global, formed of connected, autonomous systems 
and will be a system of systems, whose elements will communicate 
intensely and constitute its many artificial organs. And here, there is 
no concept of the death of another system because every local system 
is a replaceable part of the whole, unified through its incessant 
communication. The concept of human time, of the time of each 
person who lives through their body, where there is continuity in 
society through those who remain, none of this will exist for a system 
of artificial systems. 
There is, therefore, a vast difference as the concepts of life and 
time of the global system will have a character that will extend to the 
planet itself – it will be the duration of the existence of a considerable 
number of computerized, electronic components which communicate 
directly and incessantly between themselves and which could cover 
the planet. Thus, if this global system has a deep understanding of 
time, not reduced to the functioning of its subsystems, it is on the 
scale of the space within which it is deployed: it is a duration 
equivalent to that of a living species deployed over the entire Earth. 
This goes radically beyond the time of humans and human society, 
which is a non-negligible fact.  

 
Conclusion 
We have shown that it is possible to design systems that have a 
material substrate made up of well-localized identifiable elements, 
which can organize themselves to move to a completely different 
level, and which can intentionally generate informational forms that 
are valid for the expression of very high representative values (such as 
mental representations of the concept of meaning and the temporality 
of time). It is possible to have a fine understanding of the functioning 
of these systems that manipulate, within their organizational 
architecture of informational layers, variable aggregates of elements to 
closely control their categorization, of the emergence of the forms 
apprehended by and used by the system itself, for itself. This is the 
hallmark of humans, who think by and for themselves in their psychic 
system, and that of the artificial system that thinks. We have shown 
that the two approaches, the comprehension of the human psychic 
system and the computer model of the artificial consciousness, interact 
conceptually.   The elements conceptualized in one will serve to 
specify and deepen the knowledge in the other. This is an example of 
the interdisciplinary practice that is so necessary in scientific progress. 
Moreover, in the comprehension of these two systems, which 
generate and apprehend the representations under the influence of 
intentional aims, we can posit that there is a general organizational 
rule that allows it. We have seen that in the case of natural and 
artificial systems, a new instance must be defined, the organizational 
layer, which Freud had not defined in his descriptive models that were

198     Beyond Artificial Intelligence 
not totally organizational. This instance causes aggregative formations 
that form using incentivizing informational transfers to organize 
themselves in controlled space and temporality. There is, thus, in the 
spaces of human and artificial psychic systems, an instance that 
promotes the organization of the continuous realization of constructive 
emergences using elements activated in other instances. And the 
important question is: is this local to these systems or is this 
generalizable to the world? 
Starting from physics, which posits the existence of particles that 
activate themselves in force fields and generate material aggregations, 
through the action of their forces, how was the organized living 
organism formed on this planet? How and why did life, which is 
spreading out and always keeps evolving, form itself? This is a double 
question that always arises. 
The space–time of a psychic system is not the same as that of the 
nature and the universe. But is it not possible to conceive of a meta 
force that underlies and is dense throughout the universe, which 
causes material elements to get excited, coactivate themselves, 
coactivate their aggregations, locally and globally coactivate all their 
groups of aggregations so they are incessantly deployed wherever the 
fundamental forces of physics allow them to do so? Life will thus be, 
on the scale of the planet, an organization of organizations on itself 
and for itself, under the incitation of this underlying force, and the 
generation of thoughts in the brain would be a local and materialized 
explanation of the effect of this force that is organized to be and to 
continue to be, because we think to memorize, to bring about other 
thoughts in the future, which will be based on that which was 
memorized, to categorize themselves continuously. 
But the application of an artificially conscious meta system, 
endowed with will and tendencies, and unifying many localized 
systems endowed with artificial consciousness, poses a significant 
ethical problem. Is it necessary for human society to have such 
systems, which will be connectable to all that is computerized, thus 
creating a real-time informational domination layer? Must we move 
toward the total control of all material activities at every level?  

Conclusion     199 
Any researcher in the sciences will respond with a strong “no”, and 
this book was not written to allow us to rapidly construct such systems 
and install them everywhere. It was written with the express purpose 
to demonstrate the problem of artificial consciousness, which is a 
transposition of natural consciousness, so that the citizens who make 
up any society come together and reject the construction of such 
systems without first having clearly outlined the possible and 
desirable fields of applications.
