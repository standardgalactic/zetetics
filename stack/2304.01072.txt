ABSTRACT. Quantum information is about the entanglement of states. To this starting point we
add parameters whereby a single state becomes a non-vanishing section of a bundle. We consider
through examples the possible entanglement patterns of sections.
1. EXAMPLES: ENTANGLEMENT CONSTRAINTS ON SECTIONS OF TENSOR PRODUCT
BUNDLES
Consider the elementary subject of ﬁnite dimensional linear algebra, perhaps with the vector
spaces dressed with an Hermitian inner product, so as to become ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
It has two well known enhancements. If we add parameters we get bundle theory (in the dressed
case the structure group reduces from GL(n,C) to U(n)). If we add ﬁxed tensor structures to the
Hilbert spaces—so as to have pieces under the respective control of Alice, Bob, Claire, etc., we
get quantum information theory. This note advertises the “push out” of these two enhancements.
Should we be doing quantum information in families? Or when we meet a tensor product bundle,
should we ask not just about its subbundles and (non-vanishing) sections, but about their entangle-
ment properties as well?
This note is inventing, and asking its readers to help invent the upper right corner of this “push
out.”

Let us mention two contexts where the quantum world is less homogeneous than the classical.
First, if H ∼= H1⊗···⊗Hk the unit vectors, “states” of H do not all look the same. The symmetry
group U(d1) × ··· × U(dk), di = dim(Hi), is much smaller than U(d), d = ∏k
i=1di. Different
directions have vastly different entanglement properties. Second, consider, for simplicity, the case
where all di = 2, so d = 2k. The Lie algebra of U(2k) is spanned by i times the “Pauli words”:
{σi⊗···⊗σik} where i j = 0,1,2, or 3, 1 ≤j ≤k, and σ0 = id, σ1 = X =

Lie algebra SU(2k) are all iso-spectral, and thus mutually equivalent under conjugation, i.e. the
adjoint representation. However, from a quantum perspective, they are very different. The number

w, called the weight, 1 ≤w ≤k, of non-identity Pauli matrices in the Pauli word tells us how
many, w, bodies are coupled by that Hamiltonian. So in a quantum treatment is has been proposed
[BS18] that one should study left invariant metrics, e.g. gi j = ewiδi j, diagonal in the Pauli-word
basis, which reﬂect this distinction, rather than the usual Killing form ⟨H1,H2⟩:: tr(adH1 ◦adH2),
which does not. These inhomogenieties, so important in quantum information, should not be lost
sight of simply because one has a problem with continuous parameters, but instead should be
accounted for in a theory of tensor bundles.
We can think of two ways, there may be others, in which quantum problems come with contin-
uous parameters. First, in periodic systems, the dof in the unit cell constitute the ﬁber of a bundle
over the momentum torus, or Brillion zone. This point of view was important in understanding the
“10-fold way” a topological classiﬁcation of free fermion states [Kit09,Has13]. Second, one might
consider the conﬁguration space of experimental conditions for a system Fp, with parameter p. The
effective conﬁguration space is one where gauge equivalent parameter settings (e.g. multiplies of
a ﬂux quantum) are identiﬁed, and so could have a rich topology.
These are our motivations for studying the upper-right corner. What we present next are ad
hoc, but perhaps exemplary, calculations, useful to initiate this discussion. What made K-theory a
powerful tool 60 years ago were the regularities, such as Bott periodicitity, that classical calcula-
tions uncovered. As yet, in the quantum case, we see no over-riding regular patterns, but propose
searching for them. This section is organized around ﬁve examples, which can serve as a starting
point.
We give examples of tensor products of vector bundles where the factor bundles A and B (also
A, B, and C in later examples) have no nonvanishing sections, yet the tensor product P′ = A ⊗B
(and P = A⊗B⊗C) does admit a nonvanishing section. So far, this is no surprise as tensor products
multiply ﬁber dimension, and when the real dimension of the ﬁber exceeds that of the base, there
will always be a nonvanishing section. What is interesting is that much can be said about the
patterns of entanglement present in such nonvanishing sections. We give examples of P′ and P as
above where any nonvanishing section Γ must at some point x ∈X of the base have nongeneric
entanglement. The constraints on entanglement may be thought of as “quantum characteristic
classes” although it is not cohomological in the usual sense. This interpretation will be discussed
later. MF would like to thank Peter Teichner for insightful discussions.
As a warm up, consider two nontrivial (complex) vector bundles A and B over a base X. Further
suppose that A and B admit no nonvanishing section. Now consider P′ = A ⊗B. To stick to the
most familiar setting, let us assume that all bundles have unitary structure group U(n), when the
ﬁber is Cn. This can be easily relaxed to GL(n,C), but there is no present need. The ﬁbers of
P′, isomorphic to Ca ⊗Cb (here a and b are the ﬁber dimensions of A and B, respectively) are not
canonically identiﬁed with Ca ⊗Cb, but the identiﬁcation is canonical up to the product action of
U(a) ×U(b)/diagU(1) on the respective factors. This enables us to speak unambiguously about
the degree of entanglement of a nonvanishing section Γ(x) of P′ at every point x ∈X in the base,
since by deﬁnition measures of entanglement are unchanged by local unitary (LU) operators.
Example 1. We use the 2-sphere S2 ∼= CP1 as our base space. Let A be the complex line bundle with
c1(A) = 1 ∈H2(S2;Z) and B be the complex conjugate of A, B = A, so c1(B) = −1 ∈H2(S2;Z).
The line bundle A⊗B ∼= Hom(A,A) is canonically trivial since the structure group U(1) is abelian.

More concretely, it is well-deﬁned to rotate any ﬁber of A by multiplying by e2πiθ. Thus A⊗B has
a nonvanishing section: the identity rotation over each point x ∈S2. Since the ﬁber dimensions are
one, it is not meaningful to ask about entanglement of the sections: there can be none.
All sections, discussed in these notes, are assumed to be nowhere vanishing. The preceeding
example motivates the deﬁnition below.
Suppose a bundle has a ﬁxed tensor factorization P′ = A ⊗B over base X (or P = A ⊗B ⊗C,
etc.). We say a section is simple (i.e. tensor-rank 1) if it has the form Γ(x) = |a⟩|b⟩(or Γ(x) =
|a⟩|b⟩|c⟩, etc.). Any simple section induces projective sections | ˆa(x)⟩:= ˆΓA(x) ∈ˆA, |ˆb(x)⟩:=
ˆΓB(x) ∈ˆB, etc., where ˆA ( ˆB, ...) is obtained by dividing all unit ﬁbers by phase, yielding new
CP∗-bundles. For each projective bundle ˆA ( ˆB, ...) there is a ﬁrst Chern class c ˆa (cˆb, ...), the ﬁrst
Chern class of the U(1) bundle of phases that was divided out in passing from A to ˆA (B to ˆB, ...)
which is the unique obstruction lying in H2(X;Z) to lifting | ˆa⟩(|ˆb⟩, ...) to a section |a⟩(|b⟩, ...) of
A (B, ...). Since |a⟩|b⟩was originally a section of A⊗B, the obstruction sums to zero:
(1)
c ˆa +cˆb = 0
Deﬁnition 1. If the individual Chern class obstructions cA and cB both vanish, we say Γ(x) is
untwisted. When P = A ⊗B ⊗C, a section of Γ(x) will be called untwisted iff Γ(x) ∈V ′
2, and
where Γ(x) ∈A−BC (B−CA or C −AB), bar denoting closure, and c ˆa = 0 = cˆbˆc (cˆb = 0 = cˆc ˆa,
cˆc = 0 = c ˆaˆb). It follows from additivity (line 1) that where Γ(x) ∈A−B−C, c ˆa = cˆb = cˆc = 0.
In Deﬁnition 1 we have used the notation A −B −C for vectors (sections) that are simple
3-fold products, A −BC for the section of the form |a⟩⊗|φBC⟩, i.e. simple w.r.t. the ﬁrst factor
and the last two combined, etc. V ′
2, the strata of at most bipartite entanglement, is deﬁned as
A−B−C ∪A−BC ∪B−AC ∪C −AB.
Example 2. Let S4 ∼= QP1 be the base and let A be the complex 2-plane bundle with c2(A) = 1 ∈
H4(S4;Z) and again B = A. Now P′ = A ⊗B ∼= Hom(A,A) is nontrivial. This may be checked
by computing its Chern character to be 1 + 2(generator) of H4. The Chern character is a ring
isomoprhism from KU ⊗Q →⊕i evenHi(;Q) from complex K-theory tensor Q to the even rational
cohomology. Since the ﬁber of P′ has 8 real dimension, larger than the dimension 4 of the base,
P′ certainly has a nonvanishing section. We can ask: Can such a section Γ be unentangled? That
is, can Γ(x) be a tensor-rank 1 vector for all x ∈S4? Let’s imagine writing Γ(x) = vx ⊗wx, where
v ∈Ax and w ∈Bx, the respective ﬁbers. The only ambiguity in the choice of vx and wx is a phase;
for any θ we may alter the choice: vx 7→e2πiθvx, wx 7→e−2πiθwx. But letting ˆvx and ˆwx lie in the
projective spaces (Ax \ 0)/phase and (Bx \ 0)/phase, there is no longer any ambiguity. Thus, a
supposed tensor-rank 1 section Γ(x) would induce section of the projectivized bundles ˆA and ˆB:
CP3
ˆA
S4
ˆvx
,
CP3
ˆB
S4
ˆwx
But this cannot be; the obstruction to lifting a section of ˆA ( ˆB) to a section of A (B) is an
element c ˆa (cˆb) ∈H2(S4;Z) ∼= 0, and hence vanishes. A rank one section Γ(x) of A⊗B would lead

to section(s) of A (B), a contradiction. So while A ⊗B admits a nonvanishing section, any such
must have tensor-rank > 1 at some points of the base, i.e., be entangled.
Example 2′. Let A be the C2-bundle over S4 ∼= QP1, the generalized Hopf bundle already consid-
ered in Example 2. This time, consider the tensor square A⊗A. By essentially the same reasoning
as above, A ⊗A contains no simple (tensor-rank 1) section. Note that A ⊗A ∼= Λ2(A) ⊕sym2(A)
decomposes into a direct sum of a 1D skew-symmetric (“singlet”) piece and a 3D symmetric piece.
Since H2(S4;Z) ∼= 0, Λ2(A) has a non-vanishing entangled section, of the form |0⟩|1⟩−|1⟩|0⟩at
each point.
Now let us turn to the question of which entanglement patterns can be seen in an arbitrary
section of sym2(A). For two qubits the unique invariant up to local unitary transformations (LU) is
the von Neumann entropy S(ψ). To choose a normalized form, ψ = cosθ|0⟩|0⟩+sinθ|1⟩|1⟩, one
checks that S(ψ) = cosθ log(cosθ) + sinθ log(sinθ). Note that in considering symmetric states
ψ up to LU-equivalene, we intentionally break this symmetry by allowing U(2) × U(2)/U(1) to
act, that is, U(2) acts independently on the two factors. By the argument of Example 2, which
used H2(S4;Z) ∼= 0, any non-vanishing section ψ of sym2(A) must have an entangled vector ψ(s)
for some s ∈S4 which we call the “south pole.” Under LU-equivalence, according to the Schmidt
decomposition, ψ(s) will assume a form: ψ(s) = |0⟩|0⟩+t|1⟩|1⟩, 0 < t ≤1, up to an overall real
normalization

1+t2, which we drop. It is now convenient to projectivize all bundles and sections,
so we write:
(2)
CP2 →P(sym2(A))
S ⊂S4
P(ψ)
This projective bundle is of course trivial over the contractible northern patch S4 \s, so we may
write P(ψ) as a function, which, abusing notation slightly, we still call P(ψ) : (D4,S3) →CP2,
where S3 is the completed “inﬁnity” of S4 \ s. The boundary values of P(ψ) on S3 is determined
by the symmetric square of the clutching function c for A. c may be taken to be any orientation
preserving diffeomorphism: S3 c−→SU(2), recalling that A is the generalized Hopf bundle. Conse-
quentially, using the group structure on S3, the clutching map c′ : S3 →SU(2) for sym2(A) is the
composition S3 g7→g2
−−−→S3 c−→SU(2); c′ has deg(c′) = 2. Thus projectively: P(ψ)

factors as shown with the map α having Hopf degree1 2. Since the Hopf degree is ̸= 0, it is im-
possible for the extension over S4 \ s, P(ψ) : D4 →CP2 to miss any point of CP2, for that point
p would necessarily lie in CP2 \ CP1 and CP2 \ p retracts to CP1 which would imply that Hopf
degree(α) = 0. The fact that P(ψ) covers all of CP2 shows that all LU classes for ψ(x) occur as x
varies in S4. Thus, any nonvanishing section of sym2(A) exhibits all LU entanglement classes.

We have seen how a bundle built from tensoring two sectionless bundles might have sections
but these must obey entanglement constraints. Now let us turn our attention to triple tensor products
P = A ⊗B ⊗C. In this context there is a beautiful hierarchy of entanglement under the rather

coarse SLOCC2-equivalence relation. We will recapitulate the basic low dimensional SLOCC
classiﬁcation [DVC00] from an algebraic geometric point of view and use what we learn to explain
and explore further examples.
Before coming to examples of bundle triple tensor products, we review the SLOCC equivalence
relation, following [DVC00] but with an emphasis on the algebraic geometry. Let ψ and ψ′ be
nontrivial vectors in a ﬁnite tensor product of ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces:
(3)
ψ,ψ′ ∈H1 ⊗···⊗Hn
The deﬁnition of SLOCC-equivalent that we use [LP99, Vid99] is that ψ ≡ψ′ iff there exists
invertible matrices M1,...,Mn such that:
(4)
ψ′ = M1 ⊗···⊗Mn(ψ)
Similarly, we say ψ ≥ψ′ if line 4 can be written dropping the invertability assumption.
In the case of two tensor factors, n = 2, it is easy to check that ψ ≡ψ′ iff they have equal
Schmidt ranks. Now we turn to three factors, n = 3, and also assume each Hi ∼= C2 is a qubit.
In a slight abuse of notation we label the three qubits A, B, and C and retain the same nota-
tion for the C2-bundles in which these qubits have become ﬁbers parameterized over a base. Let
ρA,ρB,ρC,ρAB,ρBC, and ρCA be the reduced density matrices of ψ where the projector |ψ⟩⟨ψ| has
had the complementary indexed factors traced out, e.g. ρA is the image of |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ∈A ⊗B ⊗C ⊗
A∗⊗B∗⊗C∗under
(5)
A⊗B⊗C ⊗A∗⊗B∗⊗C∗trBC
−−→A⊗A∗
It turns out that the ranks r(ρA) = r(ρBC), r(ρB) = r(ρAC), r(ρC) = r(ρAB), and the number
of pure (tensor-rank 1) vectors in the images (ranges) R(ρBC),R(ρAC), and R(ρAB) determine the
SLOCC equivalence classes. Let us begin with the answer. In this setting (three qubits) there are
6 equivalence classes, with a canonical representative listed in the partial order (above means ≥)
below:
In the lowest class, ψ completely factorizes. In the second tranche of three classes, ψ factors
once. The interesting point is that there are two distinct classes, which we write
ˆ
GHZ and ˆW after
their well-known representatives GHZ and W, respectively, in which all three qubits are entangled.
What separates
ˆ
GHZ from ˆW is that in GHZ the three ranges R(ρBC),R(ρCA), and R(ρAB)
contain two distinct tensor-rank one (simple) vectors (of B ⊗C, ...) whereas for ψ ∈ˆW these
ranges contain only a single “double root” simple vector. In order to understand this distinction,
let us think geometrically. The reader may have already noticed that we do not bother to normalize
the state vectors, but for the moment do. Then ψ ∈S15, the unit sphere in (C2)⊗3 ∼= C8. It turns
out that the union of the strata of increasing complexity are real algebraic varieties in S15 with the

The ﬁrst three real varieties are called V ′
1,V ′
2, and V ′
3 ⊂S15, respectively. We previously met V ′

in example 2. It is also useful to divide out by phase everywhere and obtain complex projective
varieties V1,V2, and V3 ⊂CP7 with dimC(V1) = 3, dimC(V2) = 4, and dimC(V3) = 6.
The condition, which we will shortly return to, regarding the count of simple vectors in the
range of density matrices such as ρBC can also be understood geometrically. ρBC : C2
B ⊗C2
C →
C2
B ⊗C2
C ∼= C4 is a linear map with range RBC := R(ρBC). A complex 2-plane, call it R(ρBC) :=
Q′ ⊂C4, deﬁnes a projective line Q ⊂CP3. The condition that a vector in C2
B ⊗C2
C is simple, i.e.
is of the form |ψB⟩|ψC⟩, is quadratic. The locus of all simple vectors is a nonsingular degree 2
hypersurface S ⊂CP3, S is birationally equivalent (and diffeomorphic to) the projective locus of
x2 +y2 +z2 +w2 = 0; S ∼= CP1 ×CP1 ∼= S2 ×S2. Thus, projectively, the locus of simple vectors
in RBC is S ∩Q. Q is a degree 1 curve of CP3 and S is a degree 2 hypersurface so the cohomology
ring structure3 of CP3 tells us that algebraically [S]∩[Q] = 2. If the intersection is transverse, the
generic situation as ψ is varied, then the algebraic 2 translates into two distinct simple vectors in
Q. However, there is a complex codimension 1 strata where there is a single degenerate point of
geometric intersection, an isolated tangency between S and Q. The situation is fully analogous
3H∗(CP3;Z) is a truncated polynomial algebra over Z with a single genator x ∈H2(CP3;Z) with relation x4 = 0.
Q, being a projective line, represents x2 under Poincar´e duality and S represents 2x being degree 2. x2 ∪2x = 2x3,
which is Poincar´e dual to two points.

to the complex equation z2 + a = 0; the roots are distinct unless a = 0 in which case the root 0
also solves the derivative of the initial equation: 2z = 0. It turns out that this behavior (generic,
double) vs. (tangential, a single simple vector) correlates perfectly across RBC, RCA, and RAB and
distinguishes
ˆ
GHZ from ˆW, the latter corresponding to single simple vectors. ˆW is characterized
by having a unique simple vector in some (all) R∗∗.
This characterization of
ˆ
GHZ and ˆW in terms of simple vectors explains why V3 ⊂CP7 is an
algebraic hypersurface. One can go further and build up a fairly precise topological picture of the
stratiﬁcation V1 ⊂V2 ⊂V3 ⊂S15, but this will be deferred until it is necessary for an application.
We turn next to a summary of the argument [DVC00] that the behavior of the simple vectors in
R∗∗in fact distinguishes the SLOCC classes
ˆ
GHZ and ˆW. In the lowest strata V1 all the density
matrices have rank 1. In the next strata V2 \V1 two of the three density matrices have rank 2, e.g.
for A−BC, ra = 1, but ρCA and ρAB have ranges of the form C⊗C2.
The following lemma facilitates computation:
Lemma 1 ([DVC00]). If |µ⟩∈HE ⊗HF is written ∑l
i=1|ei⟩| fl⟩then R(ρE) lies in span({|ei⟩}l
i=1).
Proof. ρE = ∑l
i, j=1⟨fi | f j⟩|ei⟩⟨ej|. For |ν⟩in R(ρE), let |ν⟩= ρE|µ⟩, some |µ⟩. Then |ν⟩=
∑l
i, j=1⟨fi | f j⟩⟨ei | ν⟩|ej⟩.
□
Suppose |ψ⟩is not in V ′
2 but that ρBC contains two independent simple vectors |b1⟩|c1⟩and
|b2⟩|c2⟩, then following [DVC00] we may write
(6)
|ψ⟩= |a1⟩|b1⟩|c1⟩+|a2⟩|b2⟩|c2⟩
here |ai⟩, i = 1,2, is deﬁned by |ai⟩= ⟨ξi | ψ⟩for {⟨ξi|} biorthogonal to {|b1⟩|c1⟩,|b2⟩|c2⟩}, i.e.
⟨ξi|bi⟩|ci⟩= δi j.
This shows that in the generic case of two independent simple vectors in R(ρBC), |ψ⟩has
tensor-rank 2. It is immediately that |ψ⟩is SLOCC equivalent to the canonical GHZ state.
It is shown in [DVC00] that all vectors |ψ⟩with a degenerate simple vector in ρBC are SLOCC
equivalent to W. Such states, those of ˆW, can be characterized as having tensor-rank 3, which is
equivalent to R(ρBC) having dimension 2, with a unique simple (tensor-rank 1) vector.
With this background on the SLOCC classiﬁcation, we now consider our next example.
Example 3. Let QPk, k = 1, 2, or 3, the quaternionic projective space, serve as our (4, 8, or 12)-
dimensional base. Let A, B, and C be copies of the canonical quaterion line bundle Q →E →QP2,
regarded as a C2-bundle; Q ∼= C ⊕jC. These 2-plane bundles have c2 = 1 ∈H4(QPk;Z), and
for k = 1 we already met these bundles in Examples 2 and 2′. The bundles A, B, and C have
no nonvanishing sections. For dimensional reasons, 16 > basedim, P = A ⊗B ⊗C does have
nonvanishing sections, but no such section Γ(x), x ∈QPk, can be of GHZ-type for all x.
Since the ket |ai⟩is constructed by the formula (6), and since the biorthogonals {ξi}, i = 1,2
are unique, any |ψ⟩in the SLOCC class
ˆ
GHZ has a unique representation as in line 6, although
the order of the two summands is not well deﬁned. Indeed, by a fundamental theorem of Thom
[Tho69], the closure of ˆW := V ′
3 carries a fundamental top-dimensional4 cycle ω ∈H13(V ′;Z),
4In general, Z2 coefﬁcients are required to deﬁne the top class of a real algebraic variety, but for dimensional
reasons the coefﬁcients may be lifted to Z in this case.

and if γ ⊂S15 is a linking circle to this cycle, if one chooses a “ﬁrst” term in (6) at some point
of γ and continuously propogates this choice along γ, the choice will be reversed upon the ﬁrst
return. The degeneration of the two independent simple vector terms is modeled locally precisely
as a quadratic branch point. In the special case that γ is a small linking circle (to V ′
3) normal to
V ′
1, the lowest strata, the two terms approach each other in the limit; in the general case their sum
approaches a tensor of rank 3, i.e. an element of ˆW. ˆW is said to have border rank 2.
Now suppose, for a contradiction, that Γ(x) ∈
ˆ
GHZ, for all x ∈QPk. Because H1(QPk;Z2) ∼= 0,
no 1-cycle Γ(α(θ)), α : S1 →QPk, can link (mod 2) V ′
3 ⊂S15. So there would be no loop α(θ)
in QPk along which the terms of the unique decomposition (6) of |ψ⟩are exchanged. But this
means that taking just the “ﬁrst” term of (6) deﬁnes a new section Γ(x) of P with tensor-rank
1, Γ(x) = |a1(x)⟩|b1(x)⟩|c1(x)⟩. But this is a contradiction as any of the three tensor factors, say
|a1(x)⟩, would be a section of its bundle, A, at least modulo phase. However, since H2(QPk;Z) ∼= 0,
there is no obstruction—as we saw in Example 2, to lifting a projective section of ˆA := A/phase to
an actual section of A.
Example 4. Let the base now be QP3, and A,B,C again be the canonical bundles we met in Example
3. Now we make a claim dual to the claim of Example 3. We claim that P = A ⊗B ⊗C cannot
have an untwisted (nonvanishing) section Γ(x), where Γ(x) ∈V ′
2 for all x, x ∈QP3. That is, Γ(x)
cannot lie entirey in the lowest two strata of states.
Proof. It is immediate, even without the untwisted hypothesis, that Γ(x) cannot lie entirely in
the very lowest strata V ′
1; this is how we ﬁnished off the analysis of Example 3.
If Γ(x) =
|a(x)⟩|b(x)⟩|c(x)⟩, then each of the three tensor factors implies, at ﬁrst, a projective, and then a
genuine section of the corresponding factor bundle, a contradiction. Because H2(QP3,Z) = 0, the
Chern obstructions must vanish, and Γ(x) be untwisted.
The idea for the general case is to write QP3 as the union of three closed sets QP3 = XBC ∪
XCA ∪XAB, where XBC = Γ−1(A −BC), etc., overlapping along Γ−1(A −B −C). We will apply a
bit of reasoning familiar in topology from the Listernick-Schirlemann (LS) theorem. But ﬁrst, a
technical point. The LS argument is cohomological and requires that the excision axiom apply to
X1 := XBC, X2 := XCA, and X3 := XAB. Excision may fail for certain pathological close sets like
the “sin 1
x-circle.” However, the section Γ(x) is into (a bundle of) real algebraic sets V ′
2, which
obey favorable local conditions, Whitney stratiﬁcation, and therefore can be triangulated. Thus,
the general section from a smooth base into ﬁber V ′
2 can be perturbed (without changing the range)
so that the preimages of the strata are all subcomplexes of a Whitehead triangulation of the base,
in this case QP3. Thus w.l.o.g. we may apply excision to X1, X2, and X3.
Now suppose for a contradiction that the three inclusions induce the zero-map on H4(−;Z):
(7)
H4(QP3;Z) 0−→H4(Xi;Z) is zero, i = 1,2,3
Then the generator g ∈H4(CP3;Z) pulls back to gi ∈H4(QP3,Xi;Z), i = 1,2,3, using the
exact sequence of the pair (QP3,Xi). Now consider the commutative diagram of Figure 2.

The contradiction 0 = 1 in Figure 2 shows that for some i = 1,2,3, w.l.o.g. say i = 1, we must
have H4(QP3;Z) →H4(X1;Z) nonzero. Let g denote the image of g in H4(X1;Z). Tensoring
with Q, the same argument shows H4(QP3;Q) →H4(X1;Q) is an injection, and by hom-duality
(H∗(−;Field) is naturally isomorphic to Hom(H∗(−;Field),Field)) we have that:
(8)
H4(X1;Q) →H4(QP3;Q) is a surjection.
Let
C8
P1
X1
|a⟩|φBC⟩= Γ1
be the restriction of P to X1 and Γ1 the restriction of Γ to X1.
P1 has a (A −BC)-type section |a⟩⊗|φBC⟩. Projectively splitting off the ﬁrst factor, we obtain
CP1
ˆA1
X1
| ˆa⟩
, a projective line bundle with section | ˆa⟩, obtained by projectivizing A →ˆA and
restricting to X1.
What can we do with this projective bundle? We do not know that H2(X1,Z) ∼= 0, so, in
principle, there could be a ﬁrst Chern class c1 obstruction to lifting back to the vector bundle.
However, our assumption that Γ, hence Γ1, is untwisted w.r.t. A ⊗(B ⊗C) allows us to lift | ˆa⟩to
a section |a⟩of
C2
A
X . But line 8 implies QP1 is rationally homologous to some 4-cycle
Y ⊂X, and c2(A)[QP1] = 1 by construction, implying c2(A)[Y] = c2(A1)[Y] ̸= 0. But we have just
split a section |a⟩off A, so, stably A1 is only a line bundle over X1, thus by the dimension axiom
c2(A1) = 0, a contradiction. This contradiction shows that P has no untwisted section of type V ′
2;
tripartite entanglement must arise at some point of the base.
□
One may well ask what happens if we abandon the hypothesis that Γ is untwisted; could there
then be a section Γ(x) with only bipartite entanglement? We do not know but the following example
is cautionary: The ﬁrst possibility to come to mind for a 4-cycleY as above would beY = QP1 ∼= S4.
Since H2(S4;Z) ∼= 0 the section of P1, at least over Y ⊂X, would automatically be untwisted so
that assumption would be redundant. However, suppose Y ∼= CP2. This possible CP2 certainly
embeds in the 12D normal bundle of QP1 ⊂QP3, representing [QP1] ∈H4(QP3;Z). Now, most
curiously the unique C2-bundle T over CP2 with c2(T)[CP2] = 1, is the sum of two line-bundles

10
MICHAEL H. FREEDMAN AND MATTHEW B. HASTINGS
T = T+ ⊕T−, where the total Chern classes are:
c(T+) = 1+gen
c(T−) = 1−gen
c(T+ ⊕T−) = (1+gen)(1−gen) = 1−gen2
gen generating H2(CP2;Z) and via the choice over orientation, −gen2 being the orientation class
in H4(CP2;Z).
Thus if Y = CP2, T would be A|Y the original bundle A restricted to Y. Since T is a sum of
line bundles, A|Y would certainly have (two independent) projective sections. If | ˆa⟩were either of
these projective sections, cA, the ﬁrst Chern obstruction would be a generator of H2(CP2;Z), so
| ˆa⟩would not be untwisted.
Perhaps starting with X1 = neighborhood(CP2) and building X2 and X3 appropriately, a twisted
but bipartite-entangled section Γ of P might be constructed. This is an attractive open problem.
We conclude this section with a ﬁnal example, a variant of Example 4, exhibbting the same
phenomena but now with a more familiar base, the 12-torus T 12 rather than QP3. Tori arise in
condensed matter as Brillion Zones (“momentum tori”) and do not have the excotic ﬂavor of qua-
terionic projective spaces.
Example 4′. Let f : T 4 := S1 ×S1 ×S1 ×S1 →S4 be a degree 1 map. Place over S4 the C2-bundle
C2
Z
S4 already seen in Examples 3 and 4 with c2(Z)[S4] = 1. Let A, B, and C be three C2
bundles over T 12 obtained by projecting T 12 to T 4, composing with f and then pulling back Z. By
deﬁnition, A is obtained using π1,...,4 : T 12 →T 4 with
π1,...,4(θi) =
(
θ
i = 1,2,3,4
0
i > 4
so A = ( f ◦π1,...,4)∗(Z). Similarly, for B, replace π1,...,4 with π5,...,8 and for C replace π1,...,4 with
π9,...,12. Similar to example 4, A, B, and C have no nonvanishing section, since they each have
a nonvanishing c2. Unlike the previous case, these second Chern classes cA, cB, and cC are all
distinct, but like the preceding case cA ∪cB ∪cB = orientation class ∈H12(T 12;Z). Let c∗
A,c∗
B, and
c∗
C be the hom-duals, lifted to the integers in H4(T 12;Z).
Claim. The bundle P = A⊗B⊗C admits no untwisted (nonvanishing) section Γ with values Γ(x) ∈
V ′
2, the variety of merely bipartite extanglement.
The proof is parallel to Example 4. The Listernick-Schirlemann argument will ﬁnd a class of
essential 4-cycle Y, say [Y] = c∗
A ∈H4(T 12,Z). As in Example 4, the projective section ⟨ˆa| is lifted
to ⟨a| over Y (using the untwisted hypothesis) and then ⟨a| contradicts the second Chern class of
A, cA ̸= 0, when restricted to H4(Y;Z).
For completeness, the relevant Listernick-Schirlemann diagram is rendered below:
Let gA (gB,gC) be π1,...,4 ◦f[S4](π5,...,8 ◦f[S4],π9,...,12 ◦f[S4]). If all three, gA, gB, and gC map
to zero on the bottom row, then the lifts gA, gB, gC are deﬁned and the same 0 = 1 contradiction
from Example 4 is again obtained. So in one case, say for XA, it must be that gA maps not trivially

Again, we do not know if the no-twist hypothesis can be removed.
Example 5 (Families of
ˆ
GHZ states from the Borromean rings). It has been noticed [Ara97] that
the GHZ behaves under partial trace the same way the Borromean rings (from topology) behave
under cutting a component. In both cases, everything falls apart; there is no residual entanglement;
there is no residual linking.
The purpose of this extended example is to make this analogy precise by showing:
Theorem 1. For any rank = 2 TQFT V, the state ψ ∈V(T 2
1 ⊥⊥T 2
2 ⊥⊥T 2
3 ) ∼= (C2)⊗3, determined
by the Borromean ring complement, lies in
ˆ
GHZ, ψ ∈
ˆ
GHZ.
Proof. The quantum dimension ofV is D =
q
∑d2
i , di the dimensions of the various particle types.
Of course in the rank 2 case, there are only two particle types. Set δ = 1
D . For any TQFT [Wal91]
the partition function Z of the following simple manifold may be expressed as:
(9)
Z(S3) = δ, Z(S1 ×S2) = 1, Z(S1 ×S2 # S1 ×S2) = δ, and Z(T 3) = rank(V) = 2
There are 23 = 8 closed 3-manifolds obtained by ﬁlling the components of the Borromean
rings, where each component is ﬁlled to kill either the meridian or the longitude. Precisely, the
possibilities listed above arise. Filling so as to kill the meridian simply eliminates that component.
So, S3 results from three m-ﬁllings. The 3 way of having 2 meridional ﬁlling yield S1 ×S2 (which
is 0-framed surgery on the unknot). The three 1-meridional ﬁlling yields 0-framed surgery on the
2-component unlink, S1 × S2 # S1 × S2. The 8th possibility, three longitude ﬁlling, is 0-framed
surgery on the Borromean rings which (see [Thu80]) is T 3. These 8 partition functions are the
coordinates of ψ in the non-orthogonal basis where the projector to the trivial particle, ω0, is
located as meridian or longitude on the three tori of the Borromean rings. Topologically, the
projection ω0 signiﬁes ﬁlling so that any simple closed curve labeled by ω0 bounds a disk (or,
thickening, a 2-handle). For a given torus T 2, if we use the basis {|0⟩,|1⟩} for V(T 2), |0⟩= ω0
on meridian and |1⟩= ω0 on longitude, we compute that ⟨0|0⟩= ⟨1|1⟩= Z(S1 × S2) = 1 and
⟨0|1⟩= ⟨1|0⟩= Z(S3) = δ, 0 < δ < 1, so indeed this basis is not orthonormal.
However, from the deﬁnition of SLOCC (line 4), this classiﬁcation is GL(2C) × GL(2,C) ×
GL(2,C)-invariant. So we may use this basis to determine the SLOCC-class of ψ. To do this,

compute ρBC = trA(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|). The result is:

Now let us work out whether there are one or two simple vectors (up to a scalar) in RBC. The

|0⟩|0⟩
|0⟩|1⟩

Again, up to a non-zero scalar, simple vectors θ will have one of four forms: |1⟩⊗|1⟩, (|0⟩+
p|1⟩) ⊗(q|1⟩), (p|1⟩) ⊗(|0⟩+ q|1⟩), or (|0⟩+ p|1⟩) ⊗(|0⟩+ q|1⟩). The ﬁrst three cases can be
eliminated immediately as not being of form (11). The 4th possibility for a simple vector expands
to:
(12)
θ = 1|0⟩|0⟩+q|0⟩|1⟩+ p|1⟩|0⟩+ pq|1⟩|1⟩
Matching to (11), we ﬁnd: δx + y = 1, δy + x = q = p, and δx + 2y = p2, so y = p2 −1, and
δy+x = p =⇒δ p2 −δ +x = p, or x = δ −δ p2 + p.
We have a ﬁnal equation to use: p2 = δx+2y, or p2 = δ(δ −δ p2 + p)+2(p2 −1), or
(13)
(1−δ 2)p2 +δ p+δ 2 −2 = 0
With δ = 1
D , ﬁxed by the choice of TQFT V, this quadratic equation for p has a double root iff
(14)
δ 2 −4(1−δ 2)(δ 2 −2) = 0

Setting α = δ 2, (14) implies the quadratic equation
4α2 −11α +8 = 0, or
(15)
α = 11±√121−128

(16)
Since α cannot be real and δ must be, this proves that for all 2D TQFT V, ρBC has two distinct
simple vectors (up to scale) and so ψ ∈
ˆ
GHZ.

To weave Example 5 into the bundle context of the previous examples, note the Z3, 120 degree
rotational symmetry of the Borromean rings. Setting B = Borromean rings complement and S∞the
colimit of the ﬁnite, odd-dimensional spheres under inclusion, consider (B×S∞)/∆=: E, where ∆
is the diagonal action: 120◦rotation on B, and multiplication by the phase e2πi/3 or S∞. E is a ﬂat
bundle over S3/e2πi/3 = L∞
3 , the inﬁnite dimensional dense space with π1(L∞
3 ) ∼= Z3, with ﬁber B.

Now we may apply the functor V ﬁber-wise to produce a (C2)⊗3-bundle V over L∞

interesting; it is locally the tensor product of three C2-bundles, but not globally—the factors get
permuted by the cyclic symmetry implemented by π1(L∞
3 ) ∼= Z3. However, the local tensor struc-
ture is all that we need to discuss the SLOCC-type of the section ψ(B) that the bulk of the ﬁber
induces on V(∂B) = V(T 2 ⊥⊥T 2 ⊥⊥T 2) ∼= (C2)⊗3. As we have just seen, the section ψ(B) is of
type

GHZ, over all points of the base L∞

2. FURTHER POSSIBILITIES FROM QUANTUM TOPOLOGY
In quantum topology the Hilbert space H(Y) of a high genus (g) surface Y is assembled from
elementary pieces via a direct sum over charge sectors of tensor products. Entanglement is also a
natural concept in this context. Furthermore, these H(Y) naturally bundle over the moduli space
M(g) of conformal structures on Y. These bundles have the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ﬂat connec-
tion whose holonomy is the Jones representation, with nonvanishing parallel sections correspond-
ing to ﬁxed vectors. For TQFTs with irreducible representations, the entanglement properties of
non-parallel sections are of interest. When the quantum dimension of the theory is sufﬁciently
large, dim(H(Yg)) >> dim(M(g)), g large, so there is an abundance to nonvanishing sections to
study.
The sum over charge sectors may be formally accomplished by working locally with graded
Hilbert space, graded by charge labels on all boundary components of the surface. The concept of
entanglement depends on a decomposition. One might ﬁrst consider what happens when a surface
is decomposed into the smallest possible subsurfaces. Any surface may be decomposed into “pairs
of pants” (sometimes called “tricons”), and for many TQFTs, e.g. all the SU(2)k theories, vacuum
states (in the purely topological sector) will all be unentangled w.r.t. a pants decomposition, since
for ﬁxed charge labels the Hilbert space H(pants) always has dimension 1. This can equivalently be
expressed as: “fusion channels are unique.” Thus to study topological ground state entanglement of

14
MICHAEL H. FREEDMAN AND MATTHEW B. HASTINGS
pants decompositions (in a purely topological context as opposed to the hybrid context of [KP06])
we will need to consider theories, such as SU(3)3, with non-trivial channel multiplicities.
3. SOME THOUGHTS ON APPLICATIONS
We present some initial thoughts on applications of these ideas in physics and quantum infor-
mation.
Consider a two electrons moving in some periodic d-dimensional crystal lattice. Following
[Kit09], in the absence of interaction we can describe each band by some (possibly nontrivial)
bundle over the momentum torus Td. These bundles have ﬁber Cn for some n, where the ﬁber
describes some internal degrees of freedom (e.g., spin or valley degrees of freedom), depending
on the particular crystal. Now suppose we add some weak interaction between these electrons,
sufﬁciently weak that the electrons each remain in the given band. If the interaction is translation-
ally invariant, the total crystal momentum (i.e., the sum of coordinates in the two momentum tori,
modulo 2π) is conserved. Consider wavefunctions with given total crystal momentum (e.g. total
crystal momentum 0), any such wavefunction is then a section in a product bundle: if the total
crystal momentum is zero, then the coordinate in one base space is minus the coordinate in the
other, so the base is still Td. Then, in some cases we can say that any such wavefunction either is
entangled in the internal degrees of freedom or has some zero somewhere.
This particular method of implementing product bundles gives something more general in the
case of a product of three or more bundles. If we had instead three electrons, then only the total
momentum is conserved, and so the base is now T2d. Indeed, the usual tensor product of two
bundles is an outer tensor product pulled back by a diagonal inclusion, and in this case of three
electrons we have an outer product of three bundles pulled back to a T2d in T3d where the coor-
dinates add to zero in triples. However, we may imagine implementing higher product bundles by
considering a system dependent on some parameters. If we have several such systems, dependent
on some parameters, we have a product bundle, and if then we allow those parameters themselves
to become quantum degrees of freedom, again a wavefunction deﬁnes a section and our results
may imply either vanishing of the wavefunction somewhere or entanglement.
Another speculative application is to quantum codes. It has been argued[GZ13] that quantum
codes can be described by section of a ﬁber bundle, where the base corresponds to a choice of
stabilizers of the code and the ﬁber describes the encoded logical information. It was conjectured
that fault tolerant operations correspond to ﬂat connections on this bundle. Then, a product bundle
naturally appears by considering several copies of the same code. A nowhere-vanishing section is,
up to phase, a projector that projects onto a given state of the logical operators. Thus, in some cases
it may be possible to say something about the complexity of certain logical operations implemented
in a fault tolerant way on these quantum codes.
