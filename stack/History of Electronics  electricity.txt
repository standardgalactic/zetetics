The History of Electronics
The men that came up with all those 
formulas, theories and laws we have to 
know!

History of Electronics
Ancient Rome had batteries (Did they know 
what they were doing?)
Ancient Greece developed a knowledge of 
‘Steam power’ (didn’t want to get their 
hands dirty!)
 Understanding started later
When should we start?

1900
