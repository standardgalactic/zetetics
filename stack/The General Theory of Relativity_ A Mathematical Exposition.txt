Preface
General relativity is to date the most successful theory of gravity. In this theory, the
gravitational ﬁeld is not a conventional force but instead is due to the geometric
properties of a manifold commonly known as space–time. These properties give
rise to a rich physical theory incorporating many areas of mathematics. In this
vein, this book is well suited for the advanced mathematics or physics student, as
well as researchers, and it is hoped that the balance of rigorous mathematics and
physical insights and applications will beneﬁt the intended audience. The main text
and exercises have been designed both to gently introduce topics and to develop
the framework to the point necessary for the practitioner in the ﬁeld. This text tries
to cover all of the important subjects in the ﬁeld of classical general relativity in a
mathematically precise way.
This is a subject which is often counterintuitive when ﬁrst encountered. We have
therefore provided extensive discussions and proofs to many statements, which may
seem surprising at ﬁrst glance. There are also many elegant results from theorems
which are applicable to relativity theory which, if someone is aware of them, can
save the individual practitioner much calculation (and time). We have tried to
include many of them. We have tried to steer the middle ground between brute
force and mathematical elegance in this text, as both approaches have their merits
in certain situations. In doing this, we hope that the ﬁnal result is “reader friendly.”
There are some sections that are considered advanced and can safely be skipped
by those who are learning the subject for the ﬁrst time. This is indicated in the
introduction of those sections.
The mathematics of the theory of general relativity is mostly derived from
tensor algebra and tensor analysis, and some background in these subjects, along
with special relativity (relativity in the absence of gravity), is required. Therefore,
in Chapter 1, we brieﬂy provide the tensor analysis in Riemannian and pseudo-
Riemannian differentiable manifolds. These topics are discussed in an arbitrary
dimension and have many possible applications.
In Chapter 2, we review the special theory of relativity in the arena of the four-
dimensional ﬂat space–time manifold. Then, we introduce curved space–time and
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations which govern gravitational phenomena.

Preface
In Chapter 3, we explore spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein’s equations,
which are useful, for example, in the study of nonrotating stars. Foremost among
these solutions is the Schwarzschild metric, which describes the gravitational ﬁeld
outside such stars. This solution is the general relativistic analog of Newton’s
inverse-square force law of universal gravitation. The Schwarzschild metric, and
perturbations of this solution, has been utilized for many experimental veriﬁcations
of general relativity within the solar system. General solutions to the ﬁeld equations
under spherical symmetry are also derived, which have application in the study of
both static and nonstatic stellar structure.
In Chapter 4, we deal with static and stationary solutions of the ﬁeld equations,
both in general and under the assumption of certain important symmetries. An
important case which is examined at great length is the Kerr metric, which may
describe the gravitational ﬁeld outside of certain rotating bodies.
In Chapter 5, the fascinating topic of black holes is investigated. The two
most important solutions, the Schwarzschild black hole and the axially symmetric
Kerr black hole, are explored in great detail. The formation of black holes from
gravitational collapse is also discussed.
In Chapter 6, physically signiﬁcant cosmological models are pursued. (In this
arena of the physical sciences, the impact of Einstein’s theory is very deep
and revolutionary indeed!) An introduction to higher dimensional gravity is also
included in this chapter.
In Chapter 7, the mathematical topics regarding Petrov’s algebraic classiﬁcation
of the Riemann and the conformal tensor are studied. Moreover, the Newman–
Penrose versions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, incorporating Petrov’s classiﬁcation,
are explored. This is done in great detail, as it is a difﬁcult topic and we feel that
detailed derivations of some of the equations are useful.
In Chapter 8, we introduce the coupled Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon ﬁeld
equations. This complicated system of equations classically describes the self-
gravitation of charged scalar wave ﬁelds. In the special arena of spherically
symmetric, static space–time, these ﬁeld equations, with suitable boundary condi-
tions, yield a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the allowed theoretical charges of
gravitationally bound wave-mechanical condensates.
Eight appendices are also provided that deal with special topics in classical
general relativity as well as some necessary background mathematics.
The notation used in this book is as follows: The Roman letters i, j, k, l, m, n,
etc. are used to denote subscripts and superscripts (i.e., covariant and contravariant
indices) of a tensor ﬁeld’s components relative to a coordinate basis and span the
full dimensionality of the manifold. However, we employ parentheses around the
letters .a/; .b/; .c/; .d/; .e/; .f /, etc. to indicate components of a tensor ﬁeld
relative to an orthonormal basis. Greek indices are used to denote components that
only span the dimensionality of a hypersurface. In our discussions of space–time,
these Greek indices indicate spatial components only. The ﬂat Minkowskian metric
tensor components are denoted by dij or d.a/.b/. Numerically they are the same, but
conceptually there is a subtle difference. The signature of the space–time metric is

C2 and the conventions for the deﬁnitions of the Riemann, Ricci, and conformal
tensors follow the classic book of Eisenhart.
We would like to thank many people for various reasons. As there are so many
who we are indebted to, we can only explicitly thank a few here, in the hope that
it is understood that there are many others who have indirectly contributed to this
book in many, sometimes subtle, ways.
I (A. Das) learned much of general relativity from the late Professors J. L. Synge
and C. Lanczos during my stay at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. Before
that period, I had as mentors in relativity theory Professors S. N. Bose (of Bose–
Einstein statistics), S. D. Majumdar, and A. K. Raychaudhuri in Kolkata. During my
stay in Pittsburgh, I regularly participated in, and beneﬁted from, seminars organized
by Professor E. Newman. In Canada, I had informal discussions with Professors F.
Cooperstock, J. Gegenberg, W. Israel, and E. Pechlaner and Drs. P Agrawal, S.
Kloster, M. M. Som, M. Suvegas, and N. Tariq. Moreover, in many international
conferences on general relativity and gravitation, I had informal discussions with
many adept participants through the years.
I taught the theory of relativity at University College of Dublin, Jadavpur
University (Kolkata), Carnegie-Mellon University, and mostly at Simon Fraser
University (Canada). Stimulations received from the inquiring minds of students,
both graduate and undergraduate, certainly consolidated my understanding of this
subject.
Finally, I thank my wife, Mrs. Purabi Das. I am very grateful for her constant
encouragement and patience.
I (A. DeBenedictis) would like to thank all of the professors, colleagues, and
students who have taught and inﬂuenced me. As mentioned previously, there are
far too many to name them all individually. I would like to thank Professor E. N.
Glass of the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and the University of Windsor,
who gave me my ﬁrst proper introduction to this fascinating ﬁeld of physics and
mathematics. I would like to thank Professor K. S. Viswanathan of Simon Fraser
University, from whom I learned, among the many things he taught me, that this ﬁeld
has consequences in theoretical physics far beyond what I originally had thought.
I would also like to thank my colleagues whom I have met over the years at
various institutions and conferences. All of them have helped me, even if they do not
know it. Discussions with them, and their hospitality during my visits, are worthy
of great thanks. During the production of this work, I was especially indebted to my
colleagues in quantum gravity. They have given me the appreciation of how difﬁcult
it is to turn the subject matter of this book into a quantum theory, and opened up a
fascinating new area of research to me. The quantization of the gravitational ﬁeld is
likely to be one of the deepest, difﬁcult, and most interesting puzzles in theoretical
physics for some time. I hope that this text will provide a solid background for half
of that puzzle to those who choose to tread down this path.
I would also like to thank the students whom I have taught, or perhaps they have
taught me. Whether it be freshman level or advanced graduate level, I can honestly
say that I have learned something from every class that I have taught.

Preface
Not least, I extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to my wife Jennifer for
her encouragement throughout this project. I do not know how she did it.
We both extend great thanks to Mrs. Sabine Lebhart for her excellent and timely
typesetting of a very difﬁcult manuscript.
Finally, we wish the best to all students, researchers, and curious minds who will
each in their own way advance the ﬁeld of gravitation and convey this beautiful
subject to future generations. We hope that this book will prove useful to them.

Chapter 1
Tensor Analysis on Differentiable Manifolds
1.1
Differentiable Manifolds
We will begin by brieﬂy deﬁning an N -dimensional differentiable manifold M .
(See [23, 38, 56, 130].) There are a few assumptions in this deﬁnition. A set with
a topology is one in which open subsets are known. Furthermore, if for every two
distinct elements (or points) p and q there exist open and disjoint subsets containing
p and q, respectively, then the topology is called Hausdorff. A connected Hausdorff
manifold is paracompact if and only if it has a countable basis of open sets. (See [1,
130,132].)
1. The ﬁrst assumption we make about an applicable differentiable manifold M is
that it is endowed with a paracompact topology.
(Remark: This assumption is necessary for the purpose of integration in any
domain.)
We also consider only a connected set M for physical reasons. Moreover, we
mostly deal with situations where M is an open set.
Now we shall introduce local coordinates for M . A chart .; U / or a local
coordinate system is a pair consisting of an open subset U  M together with
a continuous, one-to-one mapping (homeomorphism)  from U into (codomain)
D  RN . Here, D is an open subset of RN with the usual Euclidean topology.1
For a point p 2 M , we have x  .x1; x2; : : : ; xN / D .p/ 2 D. The coordinates
.x1; x2; : : : ; xN / are the coordinates of the point p in the chart .; U /.
Each of the N coordinates is obtained by the projection mappings k W D 
RN ! R, k 2 f1; : : : ; N g. These are deﬁned by k.x/  k.x1; : : : ; xN / DW
xk 2 R. (See Fig. 1.1.)
1We can visualize the coordinate space RN as an N -dimensional Euclidean space.

Fig. 1.1 A chart .; U / and projection mappings
Consider two coordinate systems or charts .; U / and .b; b

p is in the nonempty intersection of U and bU . From Fig. 1.2, we conclude that
bx D .b ı 1/.x/;
x D . ı b1/. Ox/;
(1.1)
where x 2 Ds  D and bx 2 b
Ds  b
D.
From the preceding considerations, the mappings b ı 1 and  ı b1 are
continuous and one-to-one. By projection of these points, we get

(1.2)
The 2N functions bXk and Xk are continuous. However, for a differentiable
manifold, we assume that bXk and Xk are differentiable functions of N real
variables. In this context, we introduce some new notations. In case a function
f W D  RN ! RM can be continuously differentiated r times with respect to
every variable, we deﬁne the function f to belong to the class C r.D  RN I RM/,
r 2 f0; 1; 2; : : : g. In case the function is Taylor expandable (or a real-analytic
function), the symbol C w.D  RN I RM/ is used for the class.

Fig. 1.2 Two charts in M and a coordinate transformation
By the ﬁrst assumption of paracompactness, we can conclude [38,130] that open
subsets Uh exist2 such that M D
S
hUh. The second assumption about M is the
following:
2. There exist countable charts .h; Uh/ for M . Moreover, wherever there is a
nonempty intersection between charts, coordinate transformations as in (1.2) of
class C r can be found.
Such a basis of charts for M is called a C r-Atlas. A maximal collection of C r-
related atlases is called a maximal C r-Atlas. (It is also called the complete atlas.)
Finally, we are in a position to deﬁne a differentiable manifold.
3. An N -dimensional C r-differentiable manifold is a set M with a maximal C r-
atlas.
(Remark: For r D 0, the set M is called a topological manifold.)
A differentiable manifold is said to be orientable if there exists an atlas .h; Uh/
such that the Jacobian det

is nonzero and of one sign everywhere.

chart .; E 2/ is furnished by x D .x1; x2/ D .p/; p 2 E 2; D D R2. Let

Example 1.1.2. The two-dimensional (boundary) surface S2 of the unit solid sphere
can be constructed in the Euclidean space E 3 by one constraint expressible in terms
of the Cartesian coordinates as .x1/2 C .x2/2 C .x3/2 D 1. Equivalently, the same
constraint is expressible in the spherical polar coordinates as the radial coordinate
bx1 D 1. The remaining spherical polar angular coordinates .bx2;bx3/ DW .; '/ can
be used as a possible coordinate system over an open subset of S2, which is a

future use, a vector Evp at p is shown.)

Let us now consider the space in the arena of Newtonian physics. It is
mathematically represented by the three-dimensional Euclidean space E 3. This
space admits inﬁnitely many global Cartesian charts. Physically, vectors in the
tangent space describe velocities, accelerations, forces, etc. Each of these vectors
has a (homeomorphic) image in R3 of a Cartesian chart. To obtain an intuitive

Tensor Analysis on Differentiable Manifolds
Fig. 1.5 Tangent vector in E 3 and R3
deﬁnition of a tangent vector Evp or its image Evx in R3, we shall visualize an “arrow”
in R3 with the starting point x  .x1; x2; x3/ in R3 and the directed displacement
Ev  .v1; v2; v3/ necessary to reach the point .x1 C v1; x2 C v2; x3 C v3/ in R3. (See
Fig. 1.5.)
Example 1.1.3. Let us choose the following as standard (Cartesian) basis vectors at
x in R3:
Eix  Ee1x WD .1; 0; 0/x; Ejx  Ee2x WD .0; 1; 0/x; Ekx  Ee3x WD .0; 0; 1/x:
Let a three-dimensional vector be given by Ev WD 3Ee1 C 2Ee2 C Ee3 D .3; 2; 1/. Let
us choose a point x  .x1; x2; x3/ D .1; 2; 3/. Therefore, the tangent vector Evx D
.3; 2; 1/.1;2;3/ starts from the point .1; 2; 3/ and terminates at .4; 4; 4/.

However, such a simple deﬁnition runs into problems in a curved manifold. An
example of a simple curved manifold is the spherical surface S2 we have previously
discussed and as shown in Fig. 1.4. We have drawn an intuitive picture of a tangent
vector Evp on S2. The starting point p of Evp is on S2. However, the end point of
Evp is not on S2. The problem is how to deﬁne a tangent vector intrinsically on S2,
without going out of the spherical surface. One logical possibility is to introduce
directional derivatives of a smooth function F deﬁned at p in a subset of S2. Such
a deﬁnition involves only the point p and its neighboring points all on S2. Thus, we
shall represent tangent vectors by the directional derivatives. This concept appears
to be very abstract at the beginning. (See [56,121,197].)
Before proceeding, it is useful to introduce the Einstein summation convention.
In a mathematical expression, wherever two repeated indices are present, automatic
sums over the repeated index is implied. For example, we denote

The summation indices are also called dummy indices, since they can be replaced
by another set of repeated indices over the same range, as demonstrated in the above
equations.
Now, let us deﬁne generalized directional derivatives. We shall use a coordinate
chart .; U / instead of the abstract manifold M . Let x  .x1; : : : ; xN / D .p/.
Let an N -tuple of vector components be given by .v1; : : : ; vN /. Then, the tangent
vector Evx in D  RN is deﬁned by the generalized directional derivative:
Evx W D vi @
@xi ;
EvxŒf  W D vi @f .x/
@xi :
(1.3)
Here, f belongs to C 1.D  RN I R/. (Note that in the notation of the usual calculus,
EvxŒf  D Ev  grad f .)
The set of all tangent vectors Evx constitutes the N -dimensional tangent vector
space Tx.RN / in D  RN . It is an isomorphic image of the tangent vector
space Tp.M /. The coordinate basis set fEe1x; : : : ; EeNxg for Tx.RN / is deﬁned by

Now, we shall deﬁne a tangent vector ﬁeld Ev.p/ in U  M or equivalently
the tangent vector ﬁeld Ev.x/ in D  RN . It involves N real-valued functions
v1.x/; : : : ; vN .x/. The tangent vector ﬁeld is deﬁned by the operator

The proof is left as an exercise.
Now we shall deﬁne a cotangent (or covariant) vector ﬁeld. Consider a function
Qf.x/ which maps the tangent vector space Tx.RN / into R such that
Qf.x/

(1.11)
for all functions g.x/; h.x/ and all tangent vector ﬁelds Ev.x/; Ew.x/ in Tx.RN /. Such
a function is called a cotangent (or covariant) vector ﬁeld.
Example 1.1.8. The (unique) zero covariant vector ﬁeld Q0.x/ is deﬁned by
Q0.x/
Ev.x/

WD 0
for all Ev.x/ in Tx.RN /.

(Remark: In Newtonian physics, the gradient of the gravitational potential is a
covariant vector ﬁeld.)
We deﬁne the linear combinations of covariant vector ﬁelds as

.x/Qf.x/C˝.x/Qg.x/

(1.12)
for all functions .x/, ˝.x/ and all tangent vectors Ev.x/ in Tx.RN /. Under such
a rule, the set of all covariant vector ﬁelds constitutes an N -dimensional cotangent
(or dual) vector space QTx.RN /.
Now we shall introduce the notion of a 1-form which will be identiﬁed with a
covariant vector ﬁeld. We need to deﬁne a (totally) differentiable function f over

for arbitrary .h1; : : : ; hN /, we call the function f a totally differentiable function at

(1.14)
Each side of (1.14) is called a 1-form. It is customary to identify a 1-form, df .x/,
with a covariant vector ﬁeld, Qf.x/, with the following rule of operation:

Example 1.1.9. Let f .x/  f .x1; x2/ WD .1=3/Œ.x1/3  3ex2, .x1; x2/ 2 R2.
Therefore, by (1.14) and (1.15),

df .x/ŒEv.x/ D .x1/2v1.x/  ex2v2.x/;

Now we shall discuss a different topic, namely, a parametrized curve . Consider
an interval Œa; b  R.
(Remark: Open or semiopen intervals are also allowed. Moreover, unbounded
intervals are permitted too.)
The parametrized curve  is a function from the interval Œa; b into a differentiable
manifold. (See Fig. 1.6.)

In Newtonian physics, t is taken to be the time variable and M D E 3, the
physical space. Moreover, 	 is a particle trajectory relative to a Cartesian coordinate
system. The nondegeneracy condition (1.20) implies that the speed of the motion is
strictly positive.
Example 1.1.12. Let the image 	 in R3 be given by
x D X.t/ WD .2 cos2 t; sin 2t; 2 sin t/I
0 < t < =2:
The curve is nondegenerate and the coordinate functions are real-analytic. Consider
a circular cylinder in R3 such that it intersects the x1  x2 plane on the unit circle
with the center at .1; 0; 0/. Now, consider a spherical surface in R3 given by the
equation .x1/2 C .x2/2 C .x3/2 D 4. The image 	 lies in the intersection of the
cylinder and the sphere.

Let us consider the tangent vector Etx of the image 	 at the point x in RN
(see Fig. 1.7). In calculus, the components of the tangent vector EtX .t/ are taken
to be

3The rank of a tensor is different from the rank of a matrix. The rank of a matrix is deﬁned as the
number of linearly independent rows or columns of a matrix. (These two numbers are the same
if the elements are commutative.) Because of this, one sometimes uses the term “tensor order” or
“degree of the tensor” when referring to tensor rank to avoid confusion. The tensor order or degree
is the dimension of the minimum array required to represent the tensor. In index notation, this is
equivalent to the number of indices required to represent the tensor. (See [8].)

Lower order tensors have special names and abbreviated notations. For example,
0
0T.x/ 2 R is called a scalar ﬁeld. 1
0T.x/ is a tangent vector ﬁeld (or contravariant
vector ﬁeld), whereas 0
1T.x/ is a cotangent (or covariant) vector ﬁeld. We denote
lower order tensors by the following simpliﬁed notations:
0
0T.x/ DW T .x/;
0
2g.x/ DW g::.x/;
1
3R.x/ DW R:::.x/; etc.

The main properties of the permutation symbols are summarized in the following

Now we shall deﬁne a differential form of various orders. The simplest examples
of differential forms are 0-forms and 1-forms. A 0-form is deﬁned by a scalar ﬁeld
(or .0 C 0/th order tensor ﬁeld) f .x/. A 1-form is deﬁned by a covariant vector

ﬁeld QT.x/ D Tj.x/dxj . Consider now a totally antisymmetric covariant tensor
ﬁeld, pW.x/. According to (1.46), we can express pW.x/ as

The antisymmetric tensor
1
pŠWi1;:::;ip.x/ dxi1 ^ : : : ^ dxip is called a pth order
differential form or a p-form. (See [23,38,56,104,237,267].)
Example 1.2.18. Choosing p D q D 1 in N -dimensions, we obtain, from (1.47v),
that the two-form dxj ^ dxi has the property
dxj ^ dxi D dxi ^ dxj;
which implies that
dx1 ^ dx1 D dx2 ^ dx2 D : : : D dxN ^ dxN D 0::.x/:
(1.59)
(The components of 0::.x/ are all identically zero.)

Now we shall introduce the concept of an exterior derivative. In case f is a (totally)
differentiable function from D  RN into R, the exterior derivative is deﬁned by:
df .x/ WD @f .x/
@xj
dxj ;
df .x/
h
EV.x/
i
D V j.x/@f .x/
@xj
:
(1.60)
(Compare with (1.14) and (1.15).) Therefore, df .x/ is a 1-form ﬁeld. In case
QT.x/ D Tj.x/dxj is a differentiable 1-form, its exterior derivative is deﬁned as:
d QT.x/ WD ŒdTi.x/ ^ dxi D
	@Ti.x/

dxj ^ dxi
D 1

(1.61)
The above is obviously a 2-form.

The exterior derivative operator, acting on a p-form, is therefore a nilpotent
operator .
A differential p-form pW.x/ is called a closed form in case d

pW.x/


pC1O.x/. A p-form pA.x/ is called an exact form provided there exists a form
p1B.x/ such that pA.x/ D d

p1B.x/

. Poincare’s lemma shows that every exact
form is closed. We naturally ask whether or not the converse statement is true. That
is, are all closed forms exterior derivatives of lower rank forms? In the following
theorem, we answer that question.
Theorem 1.2.21. Let D be an open domain which is star-shaped with respect
to an interior point x0 2 D. Moreover, let pW.x/ be a differentiable p-form
satisfying d

pW.x/

 pC1O.x/ in D. Then, there exists a continuously twice-
differentiable .p  1/-form p1A.x/ in D such that
pW.x/ D d 
p1A.x/ :
(1.67)
(For the proof, the reader is asked to consult Flander’s book [104].)
Remark: The .p  1/th form p1A.x/ in (1.67) is not unique. We can replace it by
the .p  1/th form
p1 OA.x/ D p1A.x/  d

p2.x/

:
(1.68)
Here p2.x/ is an arbitrary .p  2/th form of differentiability class C 3.
Example 1.2.22. Let us choose N D 4 and the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F::.x/
identiﬁed with the 2-form:
2F.x/ D 1
2Fij .x/dxi ^ dxj:
Four out of the eight Maxwell’s equations can be cast into tensor ﬁeld equations:

@Fij .x/
@xk
C @Fjk.x/
@xi
C @Fki.x/
@xj
D 0:
(1.69)
In a star-shaped domain D  R4 (corresponding to space–time), the above
equations imply, by (1.67), the existence of a one-form QA.x/ such that
2F.x/ D d
h
QA.x/

Fij .x/ D @Aj .x/
@xi

The 1-form QA.x/ is called the electromagnetic 4-potential. By (1.68), we can make
the following transformation:
OQA.x/ D QA.x/  d
.x/;
(1.71i)
OAi.x/ D Ai.x/  @
.x/
@xi ;
(1.71ii)
such that the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor’s components remain unchanged.
Equations (1.71i) and (1.71ii) represent what are known as gauge transformations
of the 4-potential.

Now we shall brieﬂy discuss the integration of a p-form in (an open, connected)
domain D of RN . Suppose that f is a Riemann (or Lebesgue) integrable function
over D [ @D. Then, we deﬁne
Z

f .x/ dx1 ^ : : : ^ dxN WD
Z

f .x1; : : : ; xN / dx1; : : : ; dxN :

The right-hand side of (1.72) indicates a standard multiple integral.

This allows us to state the generalized Stokes’ theorem:
Theorem 1.2.23. Let D
pC1 be an open, star-shaped .pC1/th dimensional domain
of RN .p C 1  N / with a continuous, piecewise differentiable, orientable

Example 1.2.24. Let us choose N D 2 and p D 1. Moreover, we choose D
2 
R2 to be the rectangle .a; b/  .c; d/. The boundary @D
2 of the rectangle is to
be traversed counterclockwise in manner (to maintain the right orientation). For a
continuously differentiable 1-form QA.x/, (1.74) yields

Deﬁnition (1.62) shows that the exterior derivative produces a .p C 1/th order
antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld out of a pth order antisymmetric tensor. There exists
another derivative of tensor ﬁelds, generating higher order tensor ﬁelds. This is
called the Lie derivative.
Consider a continuous vector ﬁeld EV.x/ in D  RN and a system of ordinary
differential equations:

(1.75)
In case the Lipschitz condition is satisﬁed [38], the system of (1.75) admits a unique
solution of the initial value problem X.0/ D x0. The solution is called the integral
curve of the system (1.75) passing through x0. We now consider the family of
integral curves passing through various initial points by putting
x D .t; x0/;
(1.76i)
x0  .0; x0/:
(1.76ii)
Changing the notation in (1.76i) and (1.76ii), we write
Ox D .t; x/;

(1.77ii)

Now we introduce the related mapping:

(1.79)
This mapping takes the point x in Ox along an integral curve. Moreover, the mapping
t takes the neighborhood Nı.x/ into the neighborhood NOı. Ox/ along integral curves.
Furthermore, the mapping t induces a derivative mapping 0

xT .RN / into TOx.RN /  Tt.x/.RN/. (See (1.34).)

Riemannian and Pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds
In the preceding section, for the real tangent vector space Tx.RN /, no other
additional structure was assumed. Now we shall impose an interesting structure,
namely, the inner-product (or dot product) to Tx.RN /. This is accomplished by
assuming the existence of a second-order tensor ﬁeld g::.x/ in D  RN . The
corresponding axioms are as follows:
I1
g::.x/.EA.x/; EB.x// 2 R for all EA.x/; EB.x/ 2 Tx.RN /:
(1.85i)
I2
g::.x/.EB.x/; EA.x//  g::.x/.EA.x/; EB.x//

Axioms I1, I2, and I3 imply that g::.x/ is a symmetric second-order tensor ﬁeld.
Axiom I4 is the condition of nondegeneracy. The tensor g::.x/ is known as the
metric tensor. (See [56,195].)

Tensor Analysis on Differentiable Manifolds
The integer p n of the metric tensor is known as the signature of the metric. In the
conventions of this book, an N -dimensional manifold endowed with metric whose
signature is N  2 (p D N  1; n D 1) is said to possess Lorentz signature.5
We use lowercase Latin letters from the beginning of the alphabet, and in
parentheses, to denote the indices of a tensor relative to an orthonormal frame
..a/; .b/; .c/; .d/; .e/; .f /; etc./. We use lowercase Latin letters from the middle
of the alphabet (i; j; k; l; m; n, etc.) to denote the indices of a tensor relative to a
coordinate basis set.
In cases where the metric is positive-deﬁnite (n D 0), axiom I4 is replaced by
the stronger axiom:
I4C
g::.x/.EV.x/; EV.x//  0 I
g::.x/.EV.x/; EV.x//  0 iff EV.x/ D E0.x/:
(1.91)
For such a case, the norm or length associated with a vector ﬁeld is furnished by:
k EV.x/ kWD C
q
g::.x/.EV.x/; EV.x//:
(1.92)
The norm satisﬁes the rules:
k EV.x/ k  0;
k 
.x/EV.x/ k D j
.x/j k EV.x/ k;
k EA.x/ C EB.x/ k  k EA.x/ k C k EB.x/ k :
(1.93)
Comparing (1.87) and (1.93), we conclude that separation and norm (or length) are
not equivalent.
In the case of a positive-deﬁnite metric, the angle ﬁeld between two non-zero
vector ﬁelds, EU.x/ and
E
V.x/, can be deﬁned by
cosŒ.x/ WD
h
g::.EU.x/; EV.x//
i
k EU.x/ k  k EV.x/ k
:
(1.94)
By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we must have
 1  cosŒ.x/  1:
(1.95)
5Some relativity texts use a metric which is the negative of the one used here, so that a Lorentz
signature metric has a signature of 2  N . Caution must be applied when comparing the equations
in this text with those in texts utilizing the opposite sign convention.

However, we can prove that for the separation .EU.x// > 0 and .EV.x// > 0, the
pseudoangle is unbounded, that is,
 1 <
h

i
.EU.x//  .EV.x//

(1.96)
Comparing (1.95) and (1.96), we conclude that for a non-positive-deﬁnite metric,
the usual angle between two vectors is not deﬁned!

Tensor Analysis on Differentiable Manifolds
This example is relevant in electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, where Fij .x/ represents
the components of what is known as the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor.

We have noticed in Problem # 1 of Exercises 1.2 that partial derivatives of a
differentiable tensor ﬁeld do not transform in general as tensor ﬁelds. We can
remedy that situation in a well-known manner. First we will need to introduce some
new notations and deﬁnitions.
Partial derivatives of a differentiable function will often be denoted in the
sequel by
@jf WD

Now we shall introduce a new concept of differentiations of tensor ﬁelds. It is
called connection (sometimes written as connexion) or covariant6 derivative and
will be denoted by r. The operator r assigns to each EV.x/ 2 Tx.RN / of class
C r .r  1/ an .1 C 1/th order tensor ﬁeld r EV.x/ of class C r1. The covariant
derivative satisﬁes the following two rules:
I:

Moreover, the corresponding covariant basis ﬁelds are

are

6The term covariant has several meanings in tensor analysis. One meaning relates to the
transformation properties of a tensor and, in terms of component indices, refers to an index written
as a subscript (vs. superscript, which is contravariant). Another meaning refers to independence
from any coordinate system. In the latter sense, all tensor equations are covariant. Up until this
point in the book, we have only used the former meaning (index-down). Here, we refer to the latter
meaning (coordinate independence).

Here,

should be noted: (1) The components

.x/ and .b/
.c/.a/.x/ are not tensor ﬁeld
components in general. (2) The negative sign in (1.116ii) is a historical convention.
(3) In the sequel, we shall often omit (x) from these symbols. (4) At this stage, the
symbols

Note that rj V i and r.b/V .a/ are components of the tensor ﬁeld r EV.x/ of order
.1 C 1/.
The directional covariant derivative of a vector ﬁeld EV.x/ in the direction of the
vector ﬁeld EU.x/ is deﬁned by projecting the covariant derivative in the direction of
EU.x/. The directional derivative is denoted by rEU
EV.x/

. The operator rEU maps a
vector ﬁeld EV.x/ of class C r into another vector ﬁeld of class C r1. The deﬁnition
is furnished by:

Note that (1.85i)–(1.113) deal with the metric and orthonormality. However,
(1.115i)–(1.130) investigate various properties of connections or covariant deriva-
tives. A closer inspection of (1.115i)–(1.130)will reveal that nowhere are the metric
tensor or orthonormality explicitly used. (In fact, there exist differential manifolds
with connections devoid of a metric tensor employing similar equations!) However,
the deﬁnition of a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold demands some
relationships between the metric and the connection. In the following, we discuss
such properties.

endowed with a differentiable metric, there exists a unique connection such that:

The algebraic identities in the previous theorem imply that the number of

a manifold of dimension N is N 2.N 2  1/=12. The number of independent
components for various dimensions of importance in physics is listed in Table 1.1.
(Of particular importance to general relativity is the case N D 4.)
Now, we shall state Bianchi’s differential identities

The above can be proved by induction.

In case T::.x/ D g::.x/, the left-hand side of the above equations is zero by (1.133),

Now we shall discuss contractions of the Riemann–Christoffel curvature tensor.

Thus, the Ricci tensor R::.x/ is symmetric and has N.N C1/=2 linearly independent

9Some texts deﬁne the Ricci tensor as the contraction of the Riemann tensor on the ﬁrst and third

The Einstein tensor is a .0C2/th order symmetric tensor and possesses N.N C 1/=2
linearly independent components.
There exist more differential identities involving the tensor ﬁelds R: : :.x/;
R::.x/, and G::.x/.
Theorem 1.3.24. Let a metric ﬁeld g::.x/ be of class C 3 in D  RN . Then the
following differential identities hold:
rjRj
ikl C rkRil  rlRik  0;
(1.150i)
rjGj

(1.150ii)
with similar identities in the orthonormal frame.
Proof. The
identities
(1.150i)
follow
from
Bianchi’s
identities
(1.143i,ii)
by a single contraction. The second set of identities follows by a further
contraction.

Remarks: (i) Identities (1.150i) are known as the ﬁrst contracted Bianchi’s identi-
ties. (ii) Identities (1.150ii) are called the second contracted Bianchi’s identities. We
will see that these identities yield differential conservation laws in Einstein’s theory
of gravitation.
Now we shall deﬁne the covariant differentiation of a relative and oriented
relative tensor ﬁeld of weight w. (See (1.39) and (1.40).) It is deﬁned (in both

A manifold M with metric g:: satisfying (1.131i,ii) is called a Riemannian
manifold in case the metric is positive-deﬁnite.10 If (1.131i,ii) hold, and the metric
is not positive-deﬁnite, the manifold is called a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
We shall now classify various manifolds. In case R: : :.x/  0: : :.x/ in D 
RN , the domain D (and corresponding U  M ) is called a ﬂat domain. In case
R: : :.x/ 6 0: : :.x/ in D  RN , the domain D (and corresponding U  M ) is
called a curved domain in some sense. For a positive-deﬁnite metric, sgnŒg::.x/ D
N . For a Lorentz metric, sgnŒg::.x/ D N 2. For an indeﬁnite, non-Lorentz metric,
0  sgnŒg::.x/  N  4. We represent the classiﬁcation of manifolds with metrics
in Fig. 1.10.
Remarks: (i) In Newtonian physics, a three-dimensional Euclidean manifold repre-
sents space. (ii) In the special theory of relativity, a four-dimensional ﬂat manifold
with Lorentz metric represents the space–time continuum. (iii) In the general theory
of relativity, a four-dimensional curved manifold with Lorentz metric represents the
space–time continuum.
We shall brieﬂy discuss some integral theorems. Firstly, we deﬁne the oriented
volume of a domain D  RN by the multiple integral
10It should be noted that in much of the literature involving relativistic physics, the term Euclidean
is often synonymous with Riemannian. In this text, Euclidean and Riemannian refer to two distinct
properties.

Thus, we ﬁnally obtain

That is, the domain is locally isometric to a Euclidean plane.
In case K0 > 0 (constant positive curvature), we can prove that the domain
is locally isometric to a spherical surface (with radius of curvature 1=pK0).
Furthermore, for K0 < 0 (constant negative curvature), the domain is locally
isometric to the surface of revolution in the shape of a bugle.

Now we shall furnish the canonical form of the metric tensor for a space of
constant curvature.

The above metric locally represents an Einstein space, as can be veriﬁed by
calculating the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar ((1.147ii) and (1.148i)) and showing
that (1.165i) holds. (See [210].)

A Ricci ﬂat space is one for which the components of the Ricci tensor vanish.
Note that for Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature scalar, the Ricci tensor
components also vanish via (1.165i–iii), and hence, Einstein spaces with vanishing
curvature scalar are Ricci ﬂat. In the general theory of relativity, a four-dimensional
Ricci ﬂat domain indicates a space–time devoid of material sources (although
“gravitational ﬁelds” may be present). We shall provide plenty of examples of such
spaces later on!
We shall now investigate conformal mappings. This term is well known in
complex analysis. We generalize this concept to the mapping of a regular domain M
into M. It is assumed that M and M have identical atlases. The conformal mapping
is deﬁned by
g::.x/ WD exp Œ2.x/ g::.x/;
(1.166i)
Qe

Here,  is assumed to be a C 3-function into RN . We note that by (1.166i,ii), we can
obtain


D exp Œ2.x/ g::.x/
Ev.x/; Ew.x/

(1.167)
for an arbitrary pair of vector ﬁelds Ev.x/ and Ew.x/. The above equation clearly
shows that for a positive-deﬁnite metric, the angle (see (1.94)) between two nonzero
vectors is exactly preserved.
By (1.166i,ii), we also derive (after a long calculation) the transformed curvature
components as

Theorem 1.3.32. Consider a conformal mapping g::.x/ D expŒ2.x/g::.x/ of

Proof. The proof follows from calculating all parts of the conformal tensor

Figure 1.13 illustrates a subtle issue between parallel transport around a closed
curve and ﬂatness. Figure 1.13a represents a ﬂat sheet, and transporting the vector
around the closed curve shown yields trivial parallel transport. In a similar manner,
if the sheet is folded into a cylinder as in Fig. 1.13b, transport around the cylinder
(or any closed path) also yields trivial parallel transport, indicating that the cylinder
is also intrinsically ﬂat. If the sheet is folded into a cone as in Fig. 1.13c, the sheet
is everywhere intrinsically ﬂat, save for the apex. However, there are closed paths
which will yield nontrivial parallel transport of the vector. Speciﬁcally, these are
paths which enclose the apex. If we excise a section near the top of the cone (creating
a truncated cone), we now have an everywhere ﬂat manifold but vectors transported
around the truncated region will still possess nontrivial parallel transport. This is

Fig. 1.12 Parallel transport along a closed curve
Fig. 1.13 Parallel transport along closed curves on several manifolds. Although all manifolds here
are intrinsically ﬂat, except for the apex of (c), the cone yields nontrivial parallel transport of the
vector when it is transported around the curve shown, which encompasses the apex. The domain
enclosed by a curve encircling the apex is non-star-shaped, and therefore, nontrivial parallel
transport may be obtained even though the entire curve is located in regions where the manifold
is ﬂat
not in contradiction with the above arguments for ﬂatness since the surface which
is bound by this curve is not star-shaped, and therefore, the above argument does
not apply. Paths on the cone which do not enclose the apex still yield trivial parallel
transport.

By (1.186), it is clear that s is an arc separation parameter. (In case of a positive-
deﬁnite metric, s is called an arc length parameter.)

(1.195)
Mathematically, (1.195) is somewhat dubious. However, for popular demand, we
shall keep on using (1.195) in the sequel.
In this chapter, we shall usually use the parameter s for a nonnull curve and drop
# from X #. (However, for a null curve, we use an afﬁne parameter ˛ and drop O
from OX.˛/.)
Now we shall state an important theorem regarding a nonnull differentiable
curve.
Theorem 1.3.38. Let X be a parametrized, nonnull curve of differentiability class
C NC1.Œs1; s2; RN /. Moreover, let the following ﬁnite sequence of N non-null vector
ﬁelds, recursively deﬁned, exist along the curve:

i
.1/.s/ WD dX i.s/
ds
;
.A/.s/

.0/.s/ D .N/.s/  0;
d.A/.A/ D ˙ 1;
A 2 f1; 2; : : : ; N g:
(1.196)
Then, the set of vector ﬁelds
˚E.A/.s/
N
1 is an orthonormal basis set along the curve.
(For the proof, consult textbooks [56,244] in the references.)
Remarks:
(i) The equations (1.196) are called the generalized Frenet-Serret formulas.
(ii) In case any of the vectors
DE.A/.s/
ds
C d.A1/.A1/d.A/.A/.A/ E.A1/.s/ becomes
null, the procedure breaks down.
(For a geodesic curve, the above expression is zero for A D 1, implying .1/.s/
 0.))
(iii) The subscript .A/ is not summed.

chart. We use the alternate notations

into a manifold MN . The differentiable manifold MN1 is said to be embedded
in MN provided there exists a one-to-one mapping F W
MN1 !
MN such
that F is of class C r .r 2 ZC/. (In the case when mapping F is not assumed
to be globally one-to-one, it is deﬁned as an immersion.) The image F.MN1/
is called the embedded manifold. By restricting the coordinate charts, we deﬁne
a parametrized hypersurface  with the image P
N1 in D  RN . (See Fig. 1.19.)
We explain various mappings in Fig. 1.19 by the following equations:

Therefore, we conclude that: (1) under a reparametrization, @i behaves like
components of a covariant vector ﬁeld; (2) under a coordinate transformation, @i
behaves as components of a contravariant vector ﬁeld, and (3) under a combined
transformation, @i behaves like components of a mixed second-order (hybrid)
tensor ﬁeld. These transformation rules prompt us to deﬁne formally hybrid tensor

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time
Manifold M4
2.1
Review of the Special Theory of Relativity
We shall provide here a brief review of the special theory of relativity. Since the
emphasis of this book is general relativity, we will state some of the results in this
section without proof, for future application. For more details, the reader is referred
to the references provided within this chapter.
The arena of this theory is the four-dimensional ﬂat pseudo-Riemannian space–
time manifold M4 endowed with a Lorentz metric. (See [55,189,242].) Let us choose
a global pseudo-Cartesian or Minkowskian chart for the ﬂat manifold M4. A typical
tangent vector is depicted in Fig. 2.1.
In Fig. 2.1, the vector Evx0 is drawn on a sheet of paper with inherent Euclidean
geometry. However, in the pseudo-Riemannian manifold M4 with Lorentz metric,
we obtain from Examples 1.2.1 and 1.3.2 (also from (1.85i–iv)) that

Note that the components vi of a tangent vector Evx0 are the same either for a positive-
deﬁnite metric or for a Lorentz metric.
The length

is different from the separation 
Evx0

in (2.1). Moreover, from the discussions
after (1.95), it is clear that the angular inclination of the vector Evx0 in Fig. 2.1 is not
meaningful. Therefore, it is judicious to exercise caution in interpreting lengths and
angles of space–time vectors drawn on a piece of paper!

Fig. 2.1 A tangent vector Evp0 in M4 and its image Evx0 in R4
The tangent vector space Tx0.R4/ splits into three distinct proper subsets. The
subset of vectors

WN .x0/ WD
˚Enx0 W g::.x0/
Enx0; Enx0


(2.2iii)
is the subset of null vectors.
Example 2.1.1. Let
˚Ee.a/x0

(1.88).) Therefore,
g::.x0/
Ee.a/x0; Ee.b/x0

D d.a/.b/:
(2.3)
Let a tangent vector be given by the equation Esx0 WD 2 Ee.1/x0. Therefore, g::.x0/
Esx0;Esx0

D 4 and Esx0 are spacelike. Let another vector be furnished by Etx0 WD
p
3 Ee.4/x0. In this case, g::.x0/
Etx0;Etx0

D 3. Thus, Etx0 is timelike. Finally, let
Enx0 WD Ee.2/x0  Ee.4/x0. Thus, g::.x0/
Enx0; E
nx0

D 0. Therefore, Enx0 is a nonzero null
vector.

Now, we shall state several theorems and a corollary regarding various tangent
vectors.
Theorem 2.1.2. Let Etx0 and bEtx0 be two timelike vectors in Tx0.R4/. Then g::.x0/
.Etx0;bEtx0/ ¤ 0.

2.1

Corollary 2.1.3. Let two timelike tangent vectors Etx0 and bEtx0 have for their
components t4 > 0 and Ot 4 > 0. Then, g::.x0/

Etx0;bEtx0

< 0.
Theorem 2.1.4. Let Etx0 be a timelike vector and Enx0 be a nonzero null vector in
Tx0.R4/. Then, g::.x0/

Etx0; Enx0

¤ 0.
Next, we state a very counterintuitive theorem.
Theorem 2.1.5. Two nonzero null vectors Enx0 and bEnx0 are orthogonal .i:e:;
g::.x0/

Enx0;bEnx0

D 0/, if and only if they are scalar multiples of each other.
Proofs of above theorems and corollary are available in books [55,243].
Now, we shall brieﬂy discuss the physical signiﬁcance of the ﬂat manifold M4
in special relativity. Firstly, we choose physical units so that the speed of light
c D 1. (In the popular c.g.s. units, c D 2:998  1010 cm.s1) Roman indices
take from f1; 2; 3; 4g, whereas Greek indices take from f1; 2; 3g. The summation
convention is followed for both sets of indices. An element p 2 M4 represents
an idealized point event in the space–time continuum. In a global Minkowskian
coordinate chart, x D .p/  .x1; x2; x3; x4/ stands for the coordinates of an
event. The coordinates x1; x2; x3 represent the usual Cartesian coordinates of the
spatial point associated with the event. The fourth coordinate x4 stands for the
time coordinate of the event. (Remark: The time coordinate x4 need not provide the
actual temporal separation!) In units where the speed of light is not set to unity,
x4 is the time coordinate multiplied by c. Therefore, in the Minkowskian chart,
the time coordinate x4 possesses the same units as the spatial coordinates. (On the
other hand, a spatial coordinate x˛ divided by c possesses the same unit as time.)

(2.4)
is called the null cone (or “light cone”) with vertex at x0. (See Fig. 2.2.)
The points inside and on the upper half of the null cone represent future events
relative to x0. Similarly, points inside and on the lower half of the cone represent
past events relative to x0. The events outside the cone are the (relativistic) present
events relative to x0.

Events in Cx0 can either causally affect or be affected by the event in x0. This
statement incorporates one of the physical postulates of the special relativity,
namely, physical actions cannot propagate faster than light. We shall motivate this
statement shortly.
The global Minkowskian charts are very useful in the special theory of relativity.
The coordinate transformation (see Fig. 1.2) from one such chart to another is
furnished by the equations

Fig. 2.3 A Lorentz transformation inducing a mapping between two coordinate planes
Suppressing two dimensions characterized by the x1-axis and x2-axis, we shall
exhibit qualitatively the transformation (2.7) in Fig. 2.3. (We assume 0 < v < 1.)
In Fig. 2.3, the x3-axis and x4-axis are mapped into two straight lines OL3 and
OL4 respectively. The line N0 is mapped into b
N 0. Thus, N0 remains invariant
under the mapping. (This line physically represents the trajectory of a photon, or
other massless particle, in space–time!) The preimages of Ox3-axis and Ox4-axis are
lines L3 and L4, respectively. In the inherent Euclidean geometry of the plane
of Fig. 2.3, two lines L3 and L4 do not intersect orthogonally! However, in the
relativistic Lorentz metric, two lines L3 and L4 do intersect orthogonally! The
Lorentz transformation in (2.7) mediates, physically speaking, the transformation
from one (inertial) observer to another (inertial) observer moving with velocity v
along the x3-axis. (A popular name for the Lorentz transformation in (2.7) is a
boost.) This mapping induces the phenomena of length contraction and time dilation
between observers in relative motion [55,89].

Now, we shall discuss (Minkowskian) tensor ﬁelds in the ﬂat space–time
manifold. We use a global Minkowskian coordinate chart so that

It should be noted that covariant derivatives in Minkowskian charts are equiv-
alent to partial derivatives, as the Christoffel symbols are identically zero in
Minkowskian charts in ﬂat space–time.
Example 2.1.7. Consider the Lorentz metric tensor in (2.8). Under a Poincar´e
transformation, using (2.11), we deduce that
Odij D ak
i al
j dkl D dij:
(For the derivation of the last step, we have used (2.6ii,iv).) Therefore, the Lorentz
metric tensor behaves as a numerical tensor under Poincar´e transformations.
(Consult [56] for discussions on numerical tensors.)

One of the mathematical axioms of the special relativity is that every natural law
must be expressible as a tensor ﬁeld equation
r
sT.x/ D r
sO.x/;
or
T i1;:::;ir
j1;:::;js.x/ D 0:

(Sometimes, such tensor equations are restricted on a curve.)
By a Poincar´e transformation, (2.12) simply imply that
bT k1;:::;kr
l1;:::;ls. Ox/ D 0:
(2.13)
Therefore, a natural law, as formulated by one inertial (i.e., experiencing no net
force) observer, must be exactly similar to that of another moving (inertial) observer.
This is the principle of special relativistic “covariance.” (Later, other types of
objects, spinor ﬁelds, had to be added on.)

Qualitative pictures, together with an upper null cone, are exhibited in Fig. 2.4. Note
that the slope of timelike curves is everywhere steeper than that of the null cone, the
slope of null curves is coincident with the slope of the null cone, and the slope of
spacelike curves is shallower than the null cone.
From relativistic physics, it is known that (1) an (idealized) massive point
particle travels along a timelike curve; (2) a massless point particle (like a photon)
traverses along a null curve; (3) and moreover, hypothetical superluminal particles
called tachyons possess trajectories which are represented by spacelike curves.
Now, we shall introduce the arc separation along a timelike curve. (See (1.193).)

The above arc separation s (sometimes popularly denoted by  also) is called the
proper time along the timelike curve. It is assumed1 to provide the actual time
separation between the events X.a/ and X.t/ as an idealized, standard point clock
traverses along the timelike curve X (or, the world line). The arc separation along a
null curve is exactly zero.
An inertial observer in special relativity theory traverses a timelike, straight line
satisfying
d2X i.t/
dt2
D 0:
(2.18)
The above equation is that of a geodesic in ﬂat space–time with a Minkowskian
coordinate chart. (Compare with (1.183).)
An inertial observer is an idealized, massive point being carrying a (point)
standard clock and four orthogonal directions inherent in a tetrad. He or she is
also capable of sending photons outward and to receive them at later times after
reﬂections from other specular point objects travelling on timelike world lines. In
this process, the observer can assign operational Minkowskian coordinates to the
events around him/her. Such a method of measurements is called Minkowskian
chronometry. (Consult the book by Synge [242].) A non-inertial, idealized observer
follows a timelike world line with d2X i.t/
dt2
¤ 0.
Remark: It should be mentioned that the world line of an inertial (or else non-
inertial) observer violates the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, which
prohibits the simultaneous existence of exact position and velocity. (The arguments
here are for classical idealized objects where quantum corrections are negligible for
these purposes.)
1There are strong physical arguments for this assumption which are beyond the scope of this brief
review of special relativity. The interested reader is referred to [55].

(2.20)
Here, s 2 Œ0; s1 and X #k are C 2-functions. Furthermore, we have chosen s to be

The above equations are mathematically valid only for k EV.t/ k< 1. Or, in other
words, the nonrelativistic speed of a massive material particle must be strictly less
than the speed of light.
Now, we shall generalize Newton’s equations of motion (2.19i,ii) to the appro-
priate relativistic equations. For a particle with constant mass m > 0, we assume
that the relativistic equations are furnished by:
md2X #i.s/
ds2
D F i.x; u/ˇˇxDX #.s/; uD dX#.s/
ds
:
(2.25)
Here, the 4-force vector components F i./ are continuous functions of eight
variables. (See [55] and [243].) Note that from (2.21iii), we obtain

momentum space. (Compare with the corresponding Fig. 2.5.) This hypersurface
is known as the mass shell in relativistic physics.
Example 2.1.8. Let us investigate the timelike motion of a constant mass particle
under a nonzero, constant-valued 4-force vector. By (2.25), we write

Now, we shall investigate the motions of particles inside an extended body. It
is the theme of the usual nonrelativistic continuum mechanics. The scope of this
branch of applied mathematics encompasses ﬂuids, elastic materials, visco-elastic
materials, plasmas, and so on. (Usually, the relativistic effects, which are dominant
at high velocities, are neglected in these disciplines.)
Let us consider a nonrelativistic ﬂuid motion in Euler’s approach. There is a
three-velocity ﬁeld V˛.x; t/ which is a measure of the instantaneous ﬂuid velocity
of a particle at the spatial point x D .x1; x2; x3/ and time t. The nonlinear equations
of motion of streamlines are governed by

˛
(ext).x; t/ is the force density due to external inﬂuences. (See [244].) The streamlines
are furnished by solutions or integral curves of the differential equations

where V˛.x; t/ satisfy (2.38). (Compare with (1.75).)

Remarks: (i) Some authors call the above tensor the stress–momentum–energy

(ii) In relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, T ij .x/ sometimes represents components
of the canonical energy–momentum–stress tensor for which T ji.x/ 6 T ij.x/.
In this text, we will not be utilizing the canonical variant of this tensor.
Note that T ij .x/ in (2.45) possesses ten linearly independent components.
Now, we shall state and prove a theorem about the energy–momentum–stress
tensor ﬁeld.
Theorem 2.1.9. Let a symmetric energy–momentum–stress tensor ﬁeld T.x/ be
deﬁned by (2.45) in D  R4 representing a ﬂuid world tube. Furthermore, let the
tensor ﬁeld components T ij .x/ be of differentiability class C 1. Then, the four partial
differential equations
@j T ij D 0
(2.46)
imply the relativistic equations of streamline motion in (2.44). Moreover, (2.46)
implies one additional differential equation

Now, substituting Ui.x/U i.x/  1 from (2.42) into the preceding equation, we

streamlines in (2.44).

Remark: The equation @j T ij D 0 in (2.46) is called the differential conservation of
energy–momentum.
Now, we shall try to understand physically the energy–momentum–stress tensor
in (2.45). Suppose that an idealized inertial observer passes through the ﬂuid and
intersects a streamline at the event x in Fig. 2.6. Assume that this test observer does
not disturb any of the streamlines. He carries an orthonormal basis

the internal energy density s.4/.4/.x/. T .˛/.4/.x/ are the sums of kinetic momentum

often called the energy ﬂux or energy ﬂux vector, although it is not truly a vector.)
Finally, T .˛/.ˇ/.x/ are sums of material stress components 
.x/U ˛.x/U ˇ.x/ and
the negative of the usual internal stress components s.˛/.ˇ/.x/. A thorough
discussion of the physical interpretation of the energy–momentum–stress tensor
may be found in [230,243].
Now, we are in a position to investigate the integral conservation or total
conservation of energy–momentum of a ﬂuid or other extended bodies. We provide
another ﬁgure of a material world tube with two “horizontal caps” in Fig. 2.7.
Now, we shall state and prove the integral conservation laws. (See Fig. 2.7.)
Theorem 2.1.10. Let T.x/ 6 0.x/ and be of class C 1 inside a material world
tube. Furthermore, let T.x/  0.x/ outside the world tube. Let x4 D t1
and x4 D t2 yield three-dimensional cross sections of the world tube denoted
by @1D and @2D, respectively. Moreover, let @3D be the three-dimensional
boundary “wall” around the domain D of the tube. Furthermore, let boundary

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
Example 2.1.11. Consider the case of the incoherent dust (pressureless ﬂuid) which
happens to be one of the simplest of all materials. The deﬁnition is summarized in
the energy–momentum–stress tensor
T ij.x/ WD 
.x/U i.x/U j .x/:
(2.51)
Equation (2.47) yields

and is known as the relativistic continuity equation for the dust.

or,
	
U j.x/@j U i

(2.53)
Therefore, it is evident that the dust particles, in the absence of external forces, move
along timelike straight lines (or geodesics) in the ﬂat space–time. (It is an expected
result, as the absence of pressure and shears implies that adjacent elements of the
dust cannot exert any forces on each other.)

The special theory of relativity emerged from investigations of the speed of
light, which is also the speed of electromagnetic wave propagation. Therefore, the
electromagnetic ﬁeld equations are of particular interest in special relativity theory.
The classical electromagnetic ﬁeld is governed by Maxwell’s equations.3 As
three-dimensional vector ﬁeld equations, they are (in the absence of sources):

Here, t is the time variable, x D .x1; x2; x3/ represents Cartesian coordinates, and r
is the (spatial) gradient operator. Moreover, EE./ and EH./ are electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, respectively. The above equations can be cast neatly into Minkowskian tensor

be consistent with units used throughout most of the book.

vectors with an antisymmetric, second-order Minkowskian tensor as shown below:

(2.56ii)
Thus, Maxwell’s equations (2.54i–iv), which were discovered approximately 40
years before the advent of the special theory of relativity, were already relativistic!

Note that these equations are wave equations with a speed of unity. Therefore, the
above equations show that electromagnetic wave ﬁelds travel with the speed of
light. The wave operator  remains invariant under Poincar´e transformations (2.6i),
particularly under the Lorentz transformation (2.7). Therefore, the speed of light
(or a photon) remains unchanged for a moving inertial observer.

Equations (2.56i,ii) can be expressed succinctly in terms of differential 2-forms

We shall now summarize the main theoretical accomplishments of the special
theory of relativity in the following:
1. The special theory of relativity explains the puzzle about the speed of light arising
out of the Michelson-Morley experiments [181], which indicated that the speed
of light is invariant. As a consequence, it is established that the maximal speed
of propagation of physical actions is the speed of light.
2. There is an equivalence of all inertial observers or frames in regards to the
formulation of natural laws.
3. Length contraction of a moving rod and time dilation of a moving clock are
predicted (see [55,89,230]).
4. The rest mass m > 0 of a body possesses potential energy E D mc2. This
enormously potent equation was ﬁrst discovered by Einstein [87].
In Table 2.1, we elaborate on some aesthetic aspects of the special theory of
relativity in regards to the uniﬁcation of distinct physical entities occurring in the
nonrelativistic regime.

So far, we have used only pseudo-Cartesian or Minkowskian coordinate charts
for the ﬂat space–time manifold M4. Sometimes, more general coordinate charts
are necessary. For example, to derive the energy levels of a hydrogen atom, the
relativistic Dirac equation is investigated in the spherical polar coordinates for
spatial dimensions. Let us go back to the equations pertaining to a general coordinate
chart in (1.1) and Figs. 1.1 and 1.2. We shall apply such mappings to the ﬂat space–
time manifold M4. Consider the mappings b W bU ! R4 and b1 W b

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
The oriented half lines bLC and bL represent possible trajectories of outgoing and
incoming photons for an observer pursuing the bx4-coordinate line, respectively.
Since the null lines (or photon paths) are expressed by u D const. and v D const.,
these pair of coordinates are called double-null coordinates, as u and v coordinate
lines are coincident with the paths of null (light) rays.

The equivalence of tensor ﬁeld equations (2.72) and (2.73) is called the general
covariance of the tensor ﬁeld equations. The special theory of relativity therefore,

by demanding that physically relevant formulae be expressible as tensor equations,
is covariant under the group of general coordinate transformations. This reﬂects the
fact that physical effects must be independent of the coordinate system with which
they are measured.
Let us cast some of the tensor ﬁeld equations in a general coordinate chart
characterized by (2.70i,ii). The metric in (2.70i) and the orthonormal 1-forms in
(2.70ii) will yield Christoffel symbols and Ricci rotation coefﬁcients which are not
necessarily zero. We can deﬁne covariant derivatives from the deﬁnitions in (1.124i),
(1.124ii), (1.134), and (1.139ii).
It is useful to transform some of the special relativistic equations we have studied
into general coordinate systems. Equation (2.42) implies that

“general covariance” under the set of general coordinate transformations.

2.2
Curved Space–Time and Gravitation
In the preceding section on special relativity theory, the set of all inertial observers
(observers moving relative to each other with constant three-velocities) forms a
privileged class of observers. In Minkowskian coordinate charts, natural laws are
expressed by each of the inertial observers with exactly similar (Minkowskian)
tensor ﬁeld equations. Naturally, the next investigations focus on natural laws
expressible by an observer moving with constant three-acceleration (i.e., d2X ˛.t/
dt2
D
const:) relative to an inertial observer. Our familiar experiences of objects moving
with constant three-accelerations include apples (or other massive objects) falling
under Earth’s gravity. (We are neglecting air resistance due to Earth’s atmosphere,
and we are assuming the fall is taking place over distances where changes in the
strength of the gravitational ﬁeld can be neglected.)
Recall that Newton’s equations of motion in an external gravitational ﬁeld are
provided by
md2X ˛.t/
dt2
Df ˛.::/j:: DW mı˛ˇ @W.x/
@xˇ
jx˛DX ˛.t/;

D  ı˛ˇ@ˇWj:::
(2.79ii)
(See (2.19i).) In (2.79i, ii), W.x/ represents the Newtonian gravitational potential.
From (2.79ii), it is clear that the motion curve in a gravitational ﬁeld is independent
of the mass m > 0 of the particle.4
Very near the Earth’s surface, the potential may be well approximated by W.x/ D
gx3 C const:, where the x3-axis is coincident with the vertical direction. (Here,
g denotes the constant gravitational acceleration which must not be confused with
det

.) Integrating the equations of motion (2.79ii) in Earth’s gravity yields
X 1.t/ D .i/x1 C .i/v1t;

Now, consider an idealized observer inside a freely falling elevator in Earth’s
gravitational ﬁeld. Let him throw some massive particles inside the falling elevator.
In free fall, he experiences no effects of gravity; moreover, he sees the particles
move around him with constant 3-velocities (ignoring bounces off the walls). He
can well conclude that gravitational forces have disappeared. Consider another
example: Astronauts inside the international space station work under conditions
similar to the observer in the elevator.5 Therefore, these astronauts are experiencing
conditions valid in the special theory of relativity in inertial frames. On the other
hand, it is well known that in instants after a rocket launching, the astronauts
inside the rocket experience an apparent enhancing of gravity. Thus, one may
conclude that 3-accelerations of an observer in space can apparently generate or
annihilate gravitation (at least in the local sense). This surprising fact is known as
the principle of equivalence.
Let us investigate more critically the scenarios involving constant 3-accelerations
on a nonlocal scale. Consider three massive point objects falling freely under
the inﬂuence of gravity near the surface of the Earth where the acceleration is
5The apparent zero-gravity effects experienced by astronauts in orbit are exactly analogous to the
elevator example. The “zero-gravity” effects are due to the fact that the astronauts and the orbiting
vehicle are in free fall and not due to the fact that gravity is too weak to have any appreciable
effects. A quick calculation, using (2.79ii) and the remark after Example 1.3.28, reveals that the
gravitational acceleration at 320 km above the Earth’s surface (low Earth orbit) is approximately
91% of its value at the surface of the Earth.

Fig. 2.10 Three massive particles falling freely in space under Earth’s gravity
approximately constant (with no angular motion). The particles are initially located
at three different locations. Each of the particles follows trajectories governed by
(2.81). (See Fig. 2.10 where the 3-acceleration vectors are highlighted.)
It is obvious from Fig. 2.10 that the three 3-acceleration vectors have distinct
directions. Therefore, the observers falling freely along the lines .0/l; .2/l and
.3/l possess nonzero relative 3-accelerations. Thus, gravitational effects cannot be
eliminated (or enhanced) nonlocally! That is to say, there is no global accelerating
reference frame which will yield apparent weightlessness for all observers. Let us
quote Synge’s comments on this topic [242]:
The principle of equivalence performed the essential ofﬁce of midwife at the birth of
general relativity, but, as Einstein remarked, the infant would never have got beyond
its long-clothes had it not been for Minkowski’s concept. I suggest that the midwife
now be buried with appropriate honours and the facts of absolute space–time faced.
Let us go back to Fig. 2.10 and furnish a space and time version of the same
phenomenon. (Recall that (2.81) yields a parabola in space and time.) Thus, we put
forward Fig. 2.11, ignoring the third particle pursuing .3/l. In Fig. 2.11, parabolic
world lines .0/L and .2/L have constant 3-accelerations and a nonzero relative
3-acceleration. Moreover, we included a vertical world line .e/L WD .1/L repre-
senting a static idealized observer on the Earth’s surface. However, each of the two

(b) A similar ﬁgure but adapted to the geodesic motion of the two freely falling observers in curved

observers pursuing trajectories .0/L and .2/L experience no apparent gravitational
force. Thus, they rightfully consider themselves as inertial observers following
geodesic world lines. (Such world lines have zero 4-accelerations.) However, the
Earth-bound observer, following the straight world line (in the sense depicted in
the ﬁgure) .e/L, experiences his own weight under gravity. Therefore, he concludes
that he is not an inertial observer and is pursuing a nongeodesic trajectory in
space and time. Now, in a Minkowskian coordinate chart of a ﬂat space–time,
neither of the parabolic curves .0/L and .2/L could be considered geodesics. As
well, neither could the straight line .e/L be nongeodesic. Hence, we are confronted
with a dilemma. The only logical way out is to recognize the Fig. 2.11a as the arena
of a coordinate chart for a curved pseudo-Riemannian space–time manifold. (See
the Fig. 2.11b where we qualitatively represent a similar diagram but with the two
geodesic observers pursuing straight lines.) Furthermore, the fact that relative 4-
acceleration components D2i ./
d2
between two geodesics .0/L and .2/L are not all
zero, implies, by the geodesic deviation equations (1.191), that Ri
ljk 6 0.
In Einstein’s theory of gravitation, either there is an intrinsic gravitational ﬁeld
or there is none, according to whether the Riemann curvature tensor of space–time
vanishes or not. This is an absolute property; it has nothing to do with apparent
gravitational effects such as those due to nongeodesic motion of observers. In other
words, both the astronauts in the international space station, experiencing apparent
weightlessness, and Einstein, standing in the Prussian Academy of Sciences expe-
riencing his weight, are immersed in a nonzero gravitational ﬁeld since Ri
ljk ¤ 0
in their vicinities. However, very far away from gravitating bodies, straight lines in
a Minkowskian coordinate chart are geodesics, Ri
ljk ! 0, and gravitational effects
are vanishingly small. So we conclude, symbolically speaking, intrinsic gravitation
 nonzero Riemann curvature tensor.
It is well known that the Newtonian theory of gravitation explains usual phe-
nomena involving terrestrial and planetary motions under gravitation. We naturally

ask: “What is the signiﬁcance of the nonzero curvature tensor of Einstein’s theory
of gravitation in terms of the Newtonian gravitational potential?” We answer this
legitimate question in the following example.
Example 2.2.1. Consider a swarm of massive particles in a gravitational ﬁeld
following Newtonian equations of motion (2.79ii) and subject only to gravity. Let
these particles span a very smooth world surface in space and time. Moreover, let
this surface be parametrically represented by the equations
x˛ D ˛.t; v/;
t 2 Œt1; t2 ; v 2 Œv1; v2;
(see Fig. 2.12).
We assume that the functions ˛ are of class C 3 and that the potential W is of
class C 2. By Newton’s equations of motion (2.79ii), we have

The second term in the equation above gives rise to the usual tidal forces caused by
gravitation. Now, going back to the pseudo-Riemannian space–time M4, the spatial
components of the geodesic deviation equation (1.192) yield

(2.86)
Comparing (2.85) and (2.86), we conclude that nonzero curvature components
represent relativistic tidal forces of the intrinsic gravitation.
Now, let us explore another line of reasoning. In case tidal forces vanish,
(2.84) implies that
@2W.x/
@xˇ@x
D 0. Solving the partial differential equations, we
obtain the general solution as W.x/ D c.0/ C P3
D1 c./x. (Here, c.0/; c./’s
are arbitrary constants of integration.) Thus, equations of motion (2.79ii) yields
d2X ˛.t/
dt2
D ı˛ˇc.ˇ/ D const. Therefore, we are back to the scenario of constant 3-
acceleration! By free fall, the apparent gravity can be eliminated. Thus, as expected,
the intrinsic gravitation, equivalently the curvature tensor, must vanish.

We shall now elaborate on the curved pseudo-Riemannian space–time M4.
(It is suggested to glance through the deﬁnition of a differentiable manifold in
p. 1–3.) The ﬁrst assumption on the pseudo-Riemannian manifold M4 is that it is
a connected, four-dimensional, Hausdorff, C 4-manifold with a Lorentz metric (of
signature C2). The assumptions of Hausdorff topology and Lorentz metric imply
that M4 is paracompact. Thus, M4 has a countable basis of open sets [150] providing
a C 4-atlas.
In mathematical physics, the mathematical treatments should be rigorous and the
mathematical symbols should be ultimately related to experimental observations.
Consider an idealized event p 2 U  M4. The corresponding coordinates in the
chart .; U / are provided by xi D i.p/ WD

D  R4. We have to construct devices and methods to measure these four numbers
xi. For that purpose, we shall ﬁrst investigate idealized histories of particles in U 
M4, equivalently in D  R4, by parametrized curves called world lines. In the
sequel, we shall use arc separation parameters in (1.186) and (1.187) for timelike
curves, which are furnished by xi D X i.s/. (We drop the symbol #.) For a null
curve, we express xi D X i.˛/, where we use an afﬁne parameter ˛. We assume
the parametrized curve X to be of class C 3. Therefore, we can express from (1.186)
that

Therefore, 4-velocity is always orthogonal to 4-acceleration, whether or not the

contain the origin .0; 0; 0; 0/. Moreover, let the metric tensor components satisfy

In a ﬂat space–time, relative to a Minkowskian coordinate chart, the right-
hand sides of (2.91)–(2.94) will reduce to x4; x1; x1x2, and x1x2x3, respectively.
(We have tacitly assumed in this example that the matrix Œgij .x/ has four real
eigenvalues .1/.x/ > 0; .2/.x/ > 0; .3/.x/ > 0, and .4/.x/ < 0.)

Now, we discuss an idealized observer following a future-pointing timelike world
line. He or she carries a regular (point) clock to measure the proper time along
the world line. An orthonormal basis set or a tetrad is transported along with the
observer. He or she may be an inertial or noninertial observer. The inertial observer
obviously follows a timelike geodesic furnished by

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
Equation (2.95i) deﬁnes the 4-velocity components Ui.s/. The geodesic equation
(2.95ii) indicates that 4-velocity components Ui.s/ undergo parallel transporta-
tions. (See (1.175) and (1.178i,ii).)
It is convenient to choose the timelike unit vector Ee.4/ .X.s// of the orthonormal
tetrad as ei
.4/ .X.s// D Ui.s/. The choice of the other three spacelike unit vectors
of the tetrad is arbitrary up to a rotation or a reﬂection induced by an element of the
orthogonal group O.3; R/. Let the choice of orthonormality be made at the initial
event X.0/. Therefore,
gij .X.0// ei
.a/ .X.0// ej
.b/ .X.0// D d.a/.b/:
(2.96)
Assume now that each of the four 4-vectors is transported parallelly along the
geodesic, that is,

or,
gij .X.s// ei
.a/ .X.s// ej
.b/ .X.s// D const.
By the initial conditions (2.96), the constants must be d.a/.b/. Thus, the orthonor-
mality of the tetrad is preserved under parallel transport along a geodesic. Such
a tetrad is essential for the inertial observer to measure physical components like
T.a/.b/ .X.s// and physical (or orthonormal) components of other tensor ﬁelds.
Now, let us investigate a noninertial observer pursuing a nongeodesic timelike
world line. An obvious example is an idealized (point) scientist working in a ﬁxed
location of a laboratory on Earth’s surface. What kind of orthonormal tetrad can this
observer carry along their world line? We can explore the Frenet-Serret orthonormal
tetrad introduced in (1.196). Recapitulating the formulas, we provide the following
equations:

Here, .1/.s/ is the principal or ﬁrst curvature. Moreover, .2/.s/ and .3/.s/
are the second and third curvature, respectively. The spacelike unit vectors
E.2/.s/; E.3/.s/, and E.4/.s/ are the ﬁrst, second, and third normal to the curve.
For a nongeodesic curve, .1/.s/ ¤ 0. Therefore, by (2.98), the orthonormal Frenet-
Serret tetrad fE.a/.s/g4
1 is not parallelly transported. Thus, we look for another
mode of transportation of an orthonormal tetrad or frame along a nongeodesic curve
(or an accelerating observer). We deﬁne the Fermi derivative of a vector ﬁeld along
a curve by the following string of equations:

Theorem 2.2.3. Let X be a parametrized timelike curve of class C 2 with the image
  D  R4. Let a differentiable tetrad
˚Ee.a/ .X.s//
4
1 be orthonormal at the initial
point X.0/. Furthermore, let each of the vectors Ee.a/ .X.s// be subjected to F–W
transport along the curve. Then, the orthonormality of the tetrad ˚Ee.a/ .X.s//4

preserved for all s 2 Œ0; s1.

It can be noted by (2.100), (2.95iv), and (2.98) that the tangent vector ﬁeld Ui.s/
undergoes F–W transport automatically. Moreover, in the limit .1/.s/ ! 0, the
F–W transport ! parallel transport. In Fig. 2.13, we compare and contrast parallel
transport versus F–W transport.
In Fig. 2.13b, the tangent vector Ui.s/ D ei
.4/ .X.s// remains a tangent vector
to the nongeodesic curve under F–W transport. Thus, F–W transport provides a
noninertial observer with an orthonormal tetrad. Furthermore, it also provides an
orthonormal (spatial) triad orthogonal to the 4-velocity vector Ui.s/. This triad
forms a spatial frame of reference for the observer. It is this frame of reference which
provides us a correct generalization of the Newtonian concept of a nonrotating
moving frame.

Therefore, the (inertial) observer can measure spatial distances by the readings of
his clock! [55,242].
Now, let us try to compute the spacelike separation along the image  (Fig. 2.14),
in the case when the curvature tensor is nonzero. We employ Riemann normal
coordinates for the point x.2/ in Fig. 2.14. (See p. 67 for the deﬁnition.) Let the
domain of validity D  R4 encompass the space–time diagram in Fig. 2.14. So, we
assume that

From the point of view of physics, we refer to this coordinate chart as local
Minkowskian coordinates.
Let us assume that the observer is inertial. In such a case, geodesics originating
at x.2/ are furnished by straight lines [55,242]

Synge, in his book [243], dealt extensively with the problem of physical
measurements with help of the world function, ˝.x2; x1/ of p. 86, the symmetrized
curvature tensor (in (2.123)), the principal curvature of observer’s world line, etc.
The book [184] by Misner et al. also deals with such topics from slightly different
perspectives.
We shall now turn our attention to the equations of motion of a particle in curved
space–time. We consider the general case of a possibly variable mass M.s/ > 0
for the particle. We generalize the special relativistic equations given in # 6 of
Exercise 2.1. From the deﬁnition of force as the rate of change of momentum, we
postulate the equations of motion along a future-pointing timelike curve as

Although (2.124) and (2.125i) are mathematically equivalent, (2.125i) are preferable
from the point of view of observation, as they correspond to the physical frame.
Equation (2.125ii) is the relativistic generalization of the Newtonian power law
(2.19ii). With help from (2.125ii), we can prove that the mass function M.s/ is
constant-valued if and only if vector ﬁelds Ui.s/ and F i./j:: are orthogonal.
(Compare with Problem # 6(i) of Exercise 2.1.) In such a scenario, (2.124), (2.98),

Therefore, nongeodesic or 4-accelerated motions of particles and observers, with

There is a special class of nongravitational forces called monogenic forces [159].
A monogenic force is derivable from a single work function W.x; u/ of class C 2
such that

We elaborate on the consequences of a monogenic force in the following example.
Example 2.2.6. We can derive equations of motion (2.127) with (2.128) from a
variational principle. (See (1.187) and Appendix 1.) Consider the Lagrangian
function L of eight variables in the following:

We shall now consider a useful class of monogenic forces by requiring that the
work function W.x; u/ is a positive, homogeneous function of degree one. That is,
for an arbitrary positive number  > 0, we must have from (2.129),
W.x; u/ D W.x; u/ I

This equation is the generalization of the special relativistic quadratic constraint
(2.33). It is the generalized mass-shell condition. For a massless particle like the
photon, we can put m D 0 on the right-hand side of (2.137).
We shall now investigate the arena of relativistic Hamiltonian mechanics. First,
we will follow nonrelativistic Hamiltonian mechanics in order to introduce the
relativistic version of the Legendre transformation. Thus, we deﬁne the relativistic
Hamiltonian as
bH.x; p/ WD piui  L.x; u/ D ui @L./
@ui
 L./:
(2.138)
Let us assume now (2.128) and (2.132). Therefore, by the conditions (2.136) and
(2.133), we conclude that bH.x; p/  0. Thus, the obvious approach fails! So, we
look for another deﬁnition of a relativistic Hamiltonian. We notice that by (2.136)
and (2.133), the 4-momentum function Pi.x; u/ is a homogeneous polynomial of
degree zero in the variables ui. Therefore, for the positive number  WD .u4/1, and
the variables v˛ WD u˛.u4/1, we obtain
pi D Pi.x; u/ D Pi.x; .u4/1u/ D Pi.xI v1; v2; v3; 1//:

The above equations locally yield a parametrized seven-dimensional hyperspace
in the eight-dimensional “covariant phase space” [55] coordinatized by the .x; u/-
chart. Alternatively, the elimination of three variables v˛ in (2.139) will result locally
in a holonomic constraint

The above equations are the correct generalization of the relativistic Lorentz

There exist alternative Lagrangians for the variational derivation of Hamilton’s
canonical equations (2.146i,ii). We cite two such Lagrangians in the following:
L.II/.xI p; p0I / WD xip0
i C H.x; p/;
(2.151i)
L.III/.x; uI p; p0I / WD .1=2/.piui  xip0
i/  H.x; p/:
(2.151ii)
(Here, the prime denotes the derivative p0
ij::: WD
dP.t/
dt .) The Lagrangian function
L.III/ in the equation above explicitly reveals the symplectic structure of the
canonical equations (2.146i–iii). (See Problem # 8(ii) of Exercise 2.2.)
So far, in this chapter, we have assumed that the space–time is a pseudo-
Riemannian manifold M4 and has, in general terms, attributed its curvature to the
intrinsic gravitation. However, we have set up no ﬁeld equations by which the
curvature of space–time is made to depend on material sources. That is, we do not
yet have the relativistic analog of (1.156). Now, we shall pursue this project.

to twice the Newtonian potential W.x/ plus an undetermined constant. In a
weak gravitational ﬁeld, this relationship is (approximately) given by g44.x/ D
 Œ1 C 2W.x/ < 0.
Now, we shall explore the ﬁeld equation for the Newtonian potential inside
material sources. We choose physical units such that the Newtonian constant of
gravitation G D 1. (Recall that we have already chosen units so that the speed
of light c D 1.) In such units, physical quantities are expressible as powers of the
spatial unit of “length ” or else “time.”)

Here, 
.x/ is the nonrelativistic mass density. In the last row of the table in p. 127,
the nonrelativistic mass density, momentum density, and stress density are all
uniﬁed in relativity theory by the symmetric energy–momentum–stress tensor Tij.x/.
Therefore, in the right-hand side of the relativistic gravitational ﬁeld equations,
we would like to have 8 Tij .x/, instead of just 8
.x/ as in (2.157ii). This
choice forces us to consider a symmetric tensor ij ./ for the left-hand side of
the ﬁeld equations. Since the left-hand side of (2.157ii) is (approximately) given
by r
2g44./, our tensor ij./ should contain up to and including second partial
derivatives of gij .x/. Moreover, the curvature tensor plays an important role in the
intrinsic gravitation. Therefore, we would like ij ./ to be expressible by various
contractions of the curvature tensor. Moreover, the energy–momentum–stress
tensor satisﬁes the useful differential conservation equations rj T ij D 0. Therefore,
we shall also require ij ./ to satisfy rj ij D 0. Now, we have accumulated enough
criteria to derive ij ./ explicitly in the following theorem [90].
Theorem 2.2.8. Let the metric ﬁeld components gij .x/ be of class C 3 in a domain

These ﬁeld equations constitute the second assumption of the gravitational theory of
this book. The constant  is called the cosmological constant, due to the fact that it
was useful to Einstein in yielding a static universe when applying his ﬁeld equations
to the universe as a whole.
The right-hand side of (2.158) will read, in the common c.g.s. units, as  Tij.x/,
where  WD 8G=c4 D 2:071048 gm1 cm1 s2. In the sequel, we shall continue
to use the constant , although we shall still employ geometrized units where c D
G D 1. (Thus, in these units,  D 8.)
Einstein did not consider the cosmological constant  in his original papers. He
published as ﬁeld equations the following (or equivalent):

The equations Ci./ D 0 (or C.a/./ D 0) stand for four possible coordinate
conditions. (e.g., four equations g˛4.x/  0 and g44.x/  1 can be locally
imposed to obtain a geodesic normal (or Gaussian normal) coordinate chart, (as
discussed in (1.160)).)
The ﬁeld equations (2.161i), (2.166i), (2.167i), and (2.168i) (or their orthonormal
counterparts) constitute a system of semilinear, second-order, coupled, partial
differential equations in the domain D.e/  D  R4. (See Appendix 2.) It is
useful to take a count of the number of unknown functions versus the number
of (algebraically and differentially) independent equations. The counting process
reveals whether the system is underdetermined, overdetermined, or determinate. (In
an underdetermined system, we can prescribe suitably some unknown functions.)
In the most general case, we assume that the ten functions Tij .x/ are unknown,
although often physical considerations may place constraints on them. In the
scenario where the Tij.x/ are unknown, the counting will be symbolically expressed
as the following:
No. of unknown functions: 10.gij/ C 10.Tij/ D 20:
No. of equations: 10.Eij D 0/ C 4.T i D 0/ C 4.Ci D 0/ D 18:
No. of differential identities: 4.rjEij  T i/ D 4:
No. of independent equations: 18  4 D 14:
Therefore, the most general system is underdetermined and six out of the twenty
unknown functions can at most be prescribed.
Now, we shall explore an isolated material body surrounded by the vacuum. Let
it be represented by the world tube D.b/  D.e/  D  R4. (See Fig. 2.15.)
The relevant ﬁeld equations from (2.159i,ii) are

Physically, this condition may be interpreted as implying that there should be no
ﬂux of matter or energy off of the junction surface (which, however, may not be
static).
The other popular junction conditions are due to Israel, Sen, Lanczos, and
Darmois [45, 140, 156, 234]. We shall call these conditions the I–S–L–D jump
conditions to match the nomenclature often used in the literature. Suppose
that the intrinsic metric components of @D.b/ are given by g	.u/ of (1.223).
Moreover, the extrinsic curvature is furnished by the components K	.u/ D

conditions are characterized by

j@D.b/  0:
(2.171)
This junction condition implies the absence of surface layers (thin “ı-function”
shells) of matter and will be further motivated when we consider the variational
principle applied to gravitation. (See Appendix 1.)
Remark: The conditions (2.170) and (2.171) also apply to junctions separating
different types of material (not just matter-vacuum boundaries).
Now, let us consider an (not necessarily inertial) observer with world line  as in
Fig. 2.15. This observer is penetrating the material world tube D.b/ with a parallelly
transported (or F–W transported) orthonormal tetrad. The observer has devices to
measure the physical components G.a/.b/.X.s// (via measurements of R.a/.b/.c/.d/)

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
and T.a/.b/.X.s// along the world line xi D X i.s/. Thus, he or she can validate
ﬁeld equations (2.169) along the world line by actual experiments. Therefore, from
the point of view of physics, the ﬁeld equations (2.161ii), (2.164ii), (2.166ii), etc., in
terms of physical components are more relevant than the corresponding coordinate
components!
Next, consider a special coordinate chart, namely, Riemann normal coordi-
nates or local Minkowskian coordinates in Example 2.2.5. The vacuum equations
(2.164i), in this chart, yields

Moreover, there is a glimpse of gravitational waves in (2.172). (Gravitational waves
shall be brieﬂy discussed in Appendix 5.)
The vacuum equations Gij .x/ D 0 (or, Rij .x/ D 0) are also derivable from a
variational principle involving the Lagrangian density L

Appendix 1). (Hilbert discovered the vacuum equations independently [131], after
attending Einstein’s earlier seminars on the problem of gravitation.)
Tensorial ﬁeld equations (2.161i), (2.162i), (2.163i), (2.166i), etc., retain their
forms intact under a general coordinate transformation in (1.37). Similarly, ﬁeld
equations (2.161ii), (2.162ii), (2.163ii), (2.166ii), etc., preserve their forms under
a variable Lorentz transformation of the tetrad ﬁelds. Both of these “covariances”
are called “general covariances” of the ﬁeld equations. We have already mentioned
general covariances of (2.74)–(2.78iii) in the theory of special relativity. However,
historically, the notion of general covariance or general relativity has been used
only in the context of the curved space–time. We shall also continue to use “general
relativity” only in curved space–time (by popular demand)!

Fig. 2.16 Analytic extension of solutions from the original domain D.e/ into QOD
Therefore, the Newtonian potential W.x/ is due to superposition of gravitational
potentials of n static, massive, extended bodies. These bodies are in equilibrium
by virtue of mutual cancellations of gravitational attractions and visco-anisotropic
repulsions. The metric (2.173), with help of (2.176), depicts the exact general
relativistic generalization of this Newtonian phenomenon.

The ﬁeld equations (2.161i)–(2.163ii), (2.164i)–(2.165ii), and (2.166i,ii), which
are partial differential equations involving metric tensor components or tetrad
components, are posed in a suitable domain D.e/  D  R4. If we can solve these
equations in the domain D.e/, then we can try to extend the solutions analytically to
the whole coordinate domain D  R4. In cases where we succeed in this endeavor,
we make a suitable coordinate transformation to the domain b
D  R4, where the
solutions are automatically known by virtue of the transformation laws in (1.107i–
iii). In the hatted coordinate chart, we try to analytically extend the solutions into a
“larger” domain Qb
D  R4. (See Fig. 2.16.)
We can try to extend solutions for the metric components into more and more
coordinate charts and hope to ﬁnally construct an atlas for the differentiable pseudo-
Riemannian space–time manifold M4. We may or may not succeed in this endeavor.
Global extensions and global analysis of the space–time continuum are quite
involved as they require knowledge of the entire history and future of all gravitating
bodies involved. (See the book by Hawking and Ellis [126] on this subject.) Here,
we merely cite some toy models of two-dimensional curved surfaces, embedded in
three-dimensional Euclidean space, to illustrate myriads of strange possibilities that
global structures of space–time may acquire. (See Fig. 2.17.)
In Fig. 2.17a, the surface is that of a “bugle.” It is a surface of negative
Gaussian curvature, and it is geodesically incomplete. (For a geodesically complete
manifold, geodesics can be extended for all (real) values of afﬁne parameters.

Curved Space–Time and Gravitation

Fig. 2.17 Five two-dimensional surfaces with some peculiarities
(See [56, 126, 266].)) The surface in Fig. 2.17b represents a circular cone with a
“hair” or singularity on the bottom which is not a differentiable manifold. Figure
2.17c represents a manifold with a “throat” and identiﬁcations. Figure 2.17d depicts
a surface with self-intersection. It is an example of a Riemannian variety [90], which
is not a Riemannian manifold. The closed surface in Fig. 2.17e has one handle,
or equivalently, it is a surface of genus 1 [266]. In general relativity, 2.17a can
qualitatively represent a submanifold of the space outside of a spherical star. Figure
2.17b can qualitatively represent the gravitational collapse of a spherical matter
distribution to form a singularity, and Fig. 2.17c can be a spatial representation of
an exotic object known as a wormhole. (See Appendix 6.)
Finally, let us be reminded again of two aspects of gravitational forces. Firstly,
apparent gravity is always due to the 4-acceleration of the observer. Secondly,
intrinsic gravity (the actual gravitational ﬁeld) is always caused by tidal forces or
the (nonzero) curvature of the space–time. To be honest, we have to admit that in the
general theory of relativity, the notion of “gravitational forces” is just a myth! The
curvature effects of the space–time are erroneously misinterpreted as “gravitational
forces.” (In the sequel, whenever we use the word gravitation, we really imply
curvature effects.) We conclude this section with Wheeler’s quotation: “Matter tells
space how to curve, space tells matter how to move.”
(Note that in the quotation above, the word “gravitation” is conspicuously absent!)

General Properties of Tij
We shall now explore the algebraic classiﬁcation of orthonormal components of the
energy–momentum–stress tensor ﬁeld T.a/.b/.x/ at a particular event, corresponding
to x0 2 D  R4. The 4  4 real, symmetric matrix

Here, 
.x/ is the proper mass density and p.x/ is the pressure. (See (2.45).) By
(2.182), it is clear that the Segre characteristic of Tij .x/ in (2.188) throughout the
space–time domain of consideration is Œ.1; 1; 1/; 1.

178

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
We can deduce from (2.188) that
Tij .x/U j.x/ D 
.x/gij .x/U j .x/;
Tij .x/V j.x/ D p.x/gij .x/V j .x/:
(2.189)
Here, V j.x/ represents an arbitrary, nonzero spacelike vector ﬁeld satisfying the
orthogonality Ui.x/V i.x/  0.
Therefore, we conclude that p.x/ and 
.x/ are the invariant eigenvalues
of the energy–momentum–stress tensor ﬁeld Tij.x/. (Note that in this example,
Tij.x/U i.x/U j.x/ D 
.x/.)

In a macroscopic domain of the space–time universe, we usually experience that
the proper mass density is nonnegative, or 
.x/  0. To generalize this concept,
invariant criteria on Tij.x/, called energy conditions, are introduced. (See [126].)
I. The Weak/Null Energy Condition: This condition is furnished by the weak
inequality
Tij.x/W i.x/W j.x/  0
(2.190)
for every timelike/null vector ﬁeld W i.x/ @
@xi . Physically speaking, this inequal-
ity, for timelike W i.x/ @
@xi , implies that the energy density of a material source
as measured by any observer pursuing a timelike curve, must be nonnegative.
II. The Dominant Energy Condition: This condition is characterized by
(i)
Tij .x/W i.x/W j.x/  0
(2.191)
and (ii) T ij .x/Wj .x/ @
@xi is nonspacelike.
(W i.x/ @
@xi is an arbitrary timelike or null vector ﬁeld.)
The above conditions may be physically interpreted as the local energy
density is always nonnegative and the local energy ﬂux is always nonspacelike.
III. The Strong Energy Condition: This condition is governed by the weak
inequality
Tij .x/W i.x/W j.x/  .1=2/T i
i.x/W j.x/Wj .x/
(2.192)
for every timelike (or null) vector ﬁeld W i.x/ @
@xi .
The energy conditions are reasonable in a space–time domain containing regular,
macroscopic, matter distribution. However, these conditions likely do not hold in
the neighborhood of an extreme pressure and density, such as close to a singularity.
Moreover, in the microcosm, the arena of quantum effects, these conditions are not
meaningful. An investigation on the energy conditions may be found in [14].
In the case of a diagonalizable energy–momentum–stress tensor ﬁeld given in
(2.180), the energy conditions can be considerably sharpened.

2.3
General Properties of Tij
179
Theorem 2.3.2. Let
the
energy–momentum–stress
tensor
ﬁeld
T ij.x/
be
diagonalizable as
T ij .x/ D 
.x/U i.x/U j .x/ C

Ui.x/V i
./.x/  0;
gij .x/V i
./.x/V j
.	/.x/  ı./.	/:
(2.193)
Then, the weak energy condition (2.190) is equivalent to

.x/  0 I

.x/ C p./.x/  0;
 2 f1; 2; 3g;
(2.194i)
and the null energy condition is equivalent to only the second condition in (2.194i).
The dominant energy condition (2.191) is equivalent to
ˇˇp./.x/
ˇˇ  
.x/;
 2 f1; 2; 3g:
(2.194ii)
Furthermore, the strong energy condition is equivalent to

.x/ C p./.x/  0
and

.x/ C
3
X
D1
p./.x/  0:
(2.194iii)
We shall skip the proof. (See [126,257].)
Remarks: (i) The invariant eigenvalues p./.x/ are called principal pressures.
(ii) The negative of principal pressures, namely, ./.x/ WD p./.x/ are called
principal tensions.
(iii) A cosmological constant source can violate energy conditions.
Example 2.3.3. One can enforce the energy inequalities in (2.194i–iii) with help of
four, arbitrary, slack functions.
Let ﬁve functions q; f; h.1/; h.2/; h.3/ be arbitrary continuous functions in x 2
D  R4. The weak/null energy inequality (2.194i) is solved by putting

.x/ WD q.x/;
p./.x/ WD
	
h./.x/

2  q.x/:
In the case of the weak energy condition, the function q.x/ is subject to the extra
restriction q.x/ D Œf .x/2 to ensure a nonnegative energy density.
The dominant energy condition (2.194ii) is solved by substituting

.x/ WD Œf .x/2;
p./.x/ WD Œf .x/2  cos
	
./.x/

:
Here, f; .1/; .2/; .3/ are four, arbitrary, continuous functions.

Now we shall investigate macroscopic materials in general. Constituent particles

@xi satisfying the invariant
eigenvalue equations:
Tij.x/U j .x/ D 
.x/Ui.x/;
Ui.x/U i.x/  1:
(2.195)
The vector ﬁeld EU.x/ D U i.x/ @
@xi is tangential to motion curves representing
stream lines. (See (2.42) and Fig. 2.6.) It can be proved that the energy–momentum–
stress tensor ﬁeld Tij.x/ in (2.195) must be of Type-I in (2.179). (See Problem # 2
of Exercise 2.3.)
We deﬁne a symmetric tensor ﬁeld by
Sij.x/ WD

(2.196)
It follows that
Sij .x/U j .x/ D 
.x/Ui.x/  Tij.x/U j .x/  0:
(2.197)
We call Sij .x/ the general relativistic stress-tensor ﬁeld. (The special relativistic

We shall now analyze the relativistic kinematics of material streamlines. We
need to deﬁne several vector and tensor ﬁelds derived from the 4-velocity ﬁeld
U i.x/ @
@xi . Assuming that streamlines are curves of class C 3, we deﬁne the
4-acceleration ﬁeld, vorticity tensor, expansion tensor, expansion scalar, and shear
tensor, respectively, by

Remarks: (i) The expansion scalar .x/ provides the expansion (or contraction) of
a material domain (or body) containing streamlines.
(ii) The symmetric shear tensor ij .x/ represents change of the shape of a material
body, without any change of 3-volume content. (Caution: ij is not to be
confused with the nonrelativistic stress ˛ˇ of (2.38).)
(iii) The vanishing of the antisymmetric vorticity tensor !ij .x/  0 represents
irrotational motions of stream lines. (In such a case, we can prove that a family
of three-dimensional hypersurfaces exists such that U i.x/ @
@xi are unit normals
[86,257].)
(iv) In the case where we have .x/  0, ij .x/  0, and !ij .x/ ¤ 0, the
streamlines experience (relativistic) rigid motions. (See [86].)
Now, we shall state and prove a theorem about PU i.x/; !ij .x/; ij .x/; .x/,
and ij .x/ ﬁelds.
Theorem 2.3.4. Let the various ﬁelds PU i.x/; !ij .x/; ij .x/; .x/, and ij .x/ be
deﬁned according to (2.199i–v) for x 2 D  R4. Then, the following identities
hold:

the last equation and simplifying, we derive (2.202i). Restricting (2.202i) into the
streamline given by dX i.s/

D U i .X.s//, we obtain the other equation (2.202ii). 
Remark: Equation (2.202ii) is called the Raychaudhuri-Landau equation, and it is
very relevant in proving the singularity theorems which will be discussed brieﬂy
later in the book.
Example 2.3.6. In this example, we deal with incoherent dust (pressureless ﬂuid)
characterized by

Therefore, by (2.95ii), the streamlines follow timelike geodesics (as expected for
a free pressureless ﬂuid). Thus, the geodesic equations of motion of dust particles
emerged from conservation equations ( which are consequences of the gravitational
ﬁeld equations (2.159i).)
Now, supplementing the above condition of PUi.x/ D 0, we assume further that
the dust particles are undergoing irrotational motion, that is,
!ij .x/  0:

The gravitational ﬁeld equation (2.162i) yields, from (2.203),

The above inequality demonstrates that the rate of expansion of the dust body (with

proves the attractive aspects of gravitational forces.

(Remarks: Consult # 5(ii) of Exercise 2.3 for the proof of jk.x/jk.x/  0.)
Now, we shall investigate the streamlines of a general material continuum.

This expression provides the governing equations for the time evolution of stream-

In Example 2.3.6 involving incoherent dust, we concluded that streamlines
pursue timelike geodesics. The proof for this fact emerged just from the gravitational
ﬁeld equations. Research has been pursued on the question of motion of an extended
isolated material body [79].
We shall now provide some insight into such a problem under simpliﬁed
assumptions. We assume the usual ﬁeld equations and junction conditions:

Theorem 2.3.7. Let the world tube of a material continuum be contained in the
domain D  R4. Let the ﬁeld equations and the junction conditions (2.213i) and
(2.213ii) hold. Moreover, let the timelike 4-velocity tangent vector ﬁeld U i.x/ @

2.3

be of class C 1 and PU i.x/ @
@xi j@˙ ¤ EO.x/j@˙. Furthermore, let the streamlines
be irrotational so that !ij .x/  0 in D. Then there exists at least one timelike
continuous geodesic curve inside D.
Proof. Irrotational motion implies the existence of a one-parameter family of
orthogonal, three-dimensional hypersurfaces [86,126,257]. One of these hypersur-
faces, ˙, is shown in both of Figs. 2.18a, b. Since the 4-acceleration PU i.x/ @
@xi
is orthogonal to timelike 4-velocity vector U i.x/ @
@xi , it must be either the zero
4-vector or else a spacelike 4-vector inside ˙. Assuming 
.x/ > 0 in (2.213i),
we conclude from (2.214) that sgn Œ˚.x/j@˙
D sgn
	
ni.x/ PU i.x/

j@˙. By the
assumption PU i.x/ @
@xi j@˙ ¤ EO.x/j@˙, we conclude that ˚.x/j@˙ ¤ 0. Therefore,
either ˚.x/j@˙ > 0 or else ˚.x/j@˙ < 0. Assume that ˚.x/j@˙ > 0. (The case of
˚.x/j@˙ < 0 can be treated in a similar fashion.) Now, the condition ˚.x/j@˙ > 0
implies that the 4-vector PU i.x/ @
@xi j@˙ points outward everywhere on the continuous,
piecewise-differentiable closed boundary curve on @˙. (See Fig. 2.18b.) It is clear
that the winding number, or index, of the continuous 4-vector ﬁeld PU i.x/ @
@xi j@˙
around the closed contour @˙ is exactly one. Therefore, the ﬁxed-point theorem7
tells us that the 4-vector ﬁeld PU .x/ @
@xi j˙ must be zero at an interior point of ˙.
Since the world tube D contains a one-parameter family of spacelike hypersurfaces
˙, we have inside the world tube D, the image  of a continuous curve of zero
4-acceleration, or a geodesic.

Remarks: (i) The image of a curve  inside the material tube need not be a stream
line.
(ii) A spinning body might not possess an interior geodesic. (See [46].)
Example 2.3.8. Consider the 1-form QU.x/ WD Ui.x/ dxi. Assume that it is a closed
form, or, d QU.x/ D O::.x/. By (1.61), @iUj  @j Ui D 0. Thus, the vorticity tensor
components !ij .x/  0. By Theorem 1.2.21, there exists a differentiable function
 such that Ui.x/ D @i . The function  must satisfy the Hamilton–Jacobi
equation gij .x/@i @j   1. (See Example A2.3.) The one-parameter spacelike
hypersurfaces ˙ are provided by  .x/ D k D const. A typical two-dimensional

this underdetermined system, we arrive at a set of solutions:

We have deﬁned and discussed in Theorem 2.1.10, the total 4-momentum of an
extended body in ﬂat space–time. We would like to generalize those deﬁnitions for
curved space–time. We can still use the Fig. 2.7 for the present purpose. The main
difﬁculty in this endeavor is the problem of tensor transformations for a spatial
integral under a general coordinate transformation in (1.2) and (1.37). The only
logical choice is to express these integrals as tensorially invariant entities.
We start from four conservation equations (2.166i) explicitly stated as
rj T ij D 0. We introduce an additional differentiable vector ﬁeld EV.x/ satisfying

The above equation (2.215ii) generalizes the Killing vector equations (1.171iii).
The existence of each of the vector ﬁelds EV.x/, satisfying (2.215i), gives rise to a
conserved integral. Before we prove such a statement, consider the material world
tube in Fig. 2.19. (Compare with Fig. 2.7.)
Now we shall state and prove the following theorem on integral conservations.
Theorem 2.3.9. Let the components T ij.x/ of the differentiable energy-momen-
tum-stress tensor ﬁeld be nonzero inside the domain D of the world tube and
vanish outside. Let the nonnull boundary @D WD @D.3/ [ ˙.0/ [ ˙ be contin-

Consider the scenario where the space–time domain D has some symmetries, or,

The four nonlinear partial differential equations in (2.222ii), for the four unknown
functions Xk .bx/, will locally admit solutions. (See Appendix 2.) That is why, in a
four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian (or Riemannian) manifold, coordinate charts
exist which admit at most four (reasonable) coordinate conditions.9
We recapitulate Einstein’s interior ﬁeld equations (2.161i), (2.166i), and differ-
ential identities (2.167i):
Eij .x/ WD Gij .x/ C  Tij.x/ D 0;

T i.x/ WD rj T ij D 0;

As in p. 164, we count the number of unknown functions versus the number of
independent equations (without including coordinate conditions).
No. of unknown functions:

No. of differential equations: 10.Eij D 0/ C 4.T i D 0/ D 14:
No. of differential identities: 4.rjEij  T i  0/ D 4:
No. of independent equations: 14  4 D 10:
The system of semilinear, second- and ﬁrst-order partial differential equations
(2.223i,ii) is deﬁnitely underdetermined. We are allowed to prescribe ten out of
twenty unknown functions to make the system determinate. We can make such
choices in 11 distinct ways.
Remarks:
(i) In strategy-I, ten functions of Tij .x/ are prescribed and ten functions
of gij .x/ are treated as unknown. It is the most difﬁcult strategy mathemati-
cally. However, from the perspective of physics, it is the most useful. This
method is sometimes called the T -method [243].
(ii) In strategy-II, ten functions of gij .x/ are prescribed and ten functions of
Tij.x/ WD ./1Gij .x/ are treated as unknown. Thus, mathematically, it is
9In an N -dimensional domain, at most N (reasonable), coordinate conditions hold. Therefore, a
two-dimensional metric can be locally reduced to a conformally ﬂat form. A three-dimensional
metric can be locally brought to an orthogonal form. However, orthogonal coordinates may not
exist in dimensions N > 3. The coordinate conditions bCm bgij

the simplest method. Although energy conditions (2.190) or (2.191) or (2.192)
may be difﬁcult to satisfy, there may arise occasion when this strategy is useful.
This method is sometimes called the g-method [243].
(iii) In strategy-III there exist nine mixed methods [18] where 10  s of functions
among the Tij .x/ and s of the metric functions are prescribed for 1  s  9.
Moreover, 10s functions among the gij .x/ and s functions among the Tij.x/
are treated as unknown.
(iv) In the case of the vacuum ﬁeld equations (2.159i), the addition of the four
coordinate conditions Ci.gkl; @lgjk/ D 0, makes the system determinate.
(v) In the case when the space–time domain has some symmetries (or admits
groups of motions), the counting has to be completely revised, as the sym-
metries impose extra conditions. The general scheme, however, remains the
same. We will address some speciﬁc cases in later sections.
It should be noted that there is a relation among the coordinate conditions
Ci.gkl; @lgjk/ D 0 and the prescription of metric functions gij .x/. In case four
coordinate conditions are imposed, the above strategies undergo revisions.
Example 2.4.1. We shall furnish an example of the g-method. Let the metric tensor
components be prescribed as
gij .x/ WD dkl  @f k.x/
@xi
 @f l.x/
@xj
:
(2.224)
Here, four prescribed functions f k.x/ are of class C 4. By (1.161), the space–time
domain is ﬂat. Therefore,
Tij.x/ WD ./1Gij .x/  0:
Thus, the choice (2.224) of gij .x/ has annihilated the possibility of material sources
completely.

Another example of the g-method has been given in Example 2.2.9.
Example 2.4.2. In the domain of consideration, we choose four coordinate condi-
tions as g˛4.x/  0 and g44.x/  1. Thus, the metric is expressible as
g::.x/ D g˛ˇ.x/ dx˛ ˝ dxˇ  dx4 ˝ dx4;
ds2 D g˛ˇ.x/ dx˛dxˇ  .dx4/2:
(2.225)
This is the geodesic normal or Gaussian normal coordinate chart of (1.160).
On the three-dimensional spacelike hypersurface characterized by x4 D T , the
intrinsic metric is furnished by (2.225) as
g::.x; T / D g˛ˇ.x; T / dx˛ ˝ dxˇ
DW g˛ˇ.x; T / dx˛ ˝ dxˇ:
(2.226)
Here, we have a slight difference of notation with (1.223). (Compare (A1.35i) and
(A1.35ii).)

The six ﬁeld equations (2.228) happen to be subtensor ﬁeld equations [55,244].

Let us go back to the system of the ﬁrst- and second-order semilinear partial
differential equations (2.223i,ii) representing ﬁeld equations. The most general
solutions of the system will involve 24 arbitrary functions of integration! Out of
these 24 functions, four arbitrary functions can be absorbed by coordinate functions.
The most general solutions of the vacuum ﬁeld equations contain 20 arbitrary
functions of integration. These arbitrary functions can be adjusted to match the
prescribed initial-boundary value problems.

The classiﬁcation of a semilinear (or a quasi-linear) second-order partial differ-
ential equation has been discussed in Appendix 2 after (A2.44). The classiﬁcation
of a system of ﬁrst-order, semilinear (or quasi-linear) partial differential equations
has been touched upon in (A2.51). (For a detailed treatment, we refer to the book
by Courant and Hilbert [43].)
To illustrate brieﬂy, we deal with a couple of toy models in the following:
Example 2.4.4. Consider a domain of the ﬂat space–time and the wave equation
V D d ij @i@j V D 0:
(2.231)
(See Problem # 4 of Exercise 2.1.) By the discussions after (A2.44), it is clear that
(2.231) is hyperbolic. The second-order, linear p.d.e. (2.231) is equivalent to the
following system of four ﬁrst-order p.d.e.s:

By the criteria in [43], the system (2.233) is hyperbolic. The p.d.e. (2.235) stands for
a null hypersurface (like a null cone). (Shock waves of the wave equation (2.231)
travel along such a hypersurface [43].)

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
Example 2.4.6. Now, we shall classify gravitational ﬁeld equations (2.223i). We
use harmonic coordinates (or the harmonic gauge) to simplify calculations. (Recall
the harmonic coordinate chart as introduced in Problem #10 of Exercise 2.2.) The

(2.244)
Above is the governing equation for a three-dimensional null hypersurface in the
space–time metric of signature C2. Obviously, the system (2.241) is hyperbolic. 
We shall now explore the initial-value problem (or the Cauchy problem) of
gravitational ﬁeld equations (2.159i). However, we ﬁrstly examine a toy model of
one hyperbolic p.d.e., namely, the usual wave equation:
ririV D 0:
(2.245)
Let the domain of validity D WD D.0/  .0; t1/ have one boundary D.0/ as the
initial hypersurface x4 D 0. (See Fig. 2.20.)
The corresponding Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem is stated below:
Theorem 2.4.7. Let metric components gij .x/ be real analytic with g44.x/ < 0
in a space–time domain D
WD D.0/  .0; t1/  R4 with one boundary at
x4 D 0. Moreover, let this boundary hypersurface contain the origin .0; 0; 0; 0/.
Furthermore, let D.0/ be the projection of D onto the hypersurface x4 D 0. Given
real-analytic functions f .x/ and h.x/ in x 2 D.0/, there exists a half-neighborhood
N C
ı .0; 0; 0; 0/ with a unique solution V.x/ of the partial differential equation
(2.245) such that

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
As a preliminary to the investigation of initial-value problems for general
relativity, we state the following Lichnerowicz-Synge lemma [166,243]:
Lemma 2.4.8. Consider gravitational ﬁeld equations (2.223i,ii) in a domain D WD
D.0/  .0; t1/. Then, the following two statements are mathematically equivalent:
.A/
Eij.x/ D 0

and

in
x 2 D
(2.246iii)
with
E4
i.x; 0/ D 0
for
x 2 D.0/:
(2.246iv)
For the proof, see [243].
Now, we shall state and prove a theorem on the solution of the initial-value
problem in general relativity.
Theorem 2.4.9. Let the energy–momentum–stress tensor components Tij .x/ and
metric tensor components gij .x/ be real analytic with g44.x/ < 0 in a space–time
domain D WD D.0/ .0; t1/  R4 with one boundary hypersurface at x4 D 0. Given
30 real-analytic functions, g#
ij .x/;  ij .x/, T #
˛ˇ.x/, and i.x/ D T #
4i.x/ for x 2 D.0/
be prescribed. Moreover, let the initial constraints
	
G4
i.x/ C T 4
i .x/

jx4D0 D 0
hold. Then, there exist 20 unique solutions gij .x/ and Tij .x/ of the ﬁeld equations
Eij.x/ D 0 in D.0/  .0; t1/ such that
lim

D
 ij .x/,
lim

T˛ˇ.x/ D T #

lim

Ti4.x/ D i.x/.
Proof. Instead of using (2.246i), we use the equivalent equations (2.246ii),
(2.246iii), and (2.246iv). Moreover, instead of using the T -method of p. 197,
we use a mixed method of the p. 197 to solve the ﬁeld equations. Therefore, by
Example 2.4.2, we make use of geodesic normal coordinates (2.225) yielding
g::.x/ D g˛ˇ.x/ dx˛ ˝ dxˇ  dx4 ˝ dx4:
Moreover, we prescribe T˛ˇ.x/ in D and solve for g˛ˇ.x/ and Ti4.x/ from
(2.246ii–iv). The ﬁeld equations (2.246ii) and (2.246iii) yield, respectively,

Now, we shall explore electromagnetic ﬁelds in a curved space–time manifold. We
have already touched upon electromagnetic ﬁelds in Examples 1.2.19, 1.2.22, 1.3.6,
2.1.12, and 2.1.13 and (2.56i,ii), (2.60i–iii), (2.63), (2.67), (2.77i–iii), and (2.78i–
iii). All these equations allow for a straight forward generalization in a domain
of curved space–time. Recall that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented by an
antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld
F::.x/ D Fij.x/ dxi ˝ dxj D .1=2/Fij.x/ dxi ^ dxj:
(2.276)
Outside charged material sources, Maxwell’s equations for an electromagnetic ﬁeld
in a curved, background space–time, are governed by
rj F ij D 0;

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4

Denoting the generalized wave operator (or the generalized D’Alembertian) by
 WD rj rj , Maxwell’s equations (2.277i,ii) reduce to
ri 	rj Aj

(2.279)
Now under a gauge transformation of (1.71ii), namely,
bAi.x/ D Ai.x/  @i D Ai.x/  ri;
(2.280)
the electromagnetic ﬁeld remains unchanged, or bF ij.x/  Fij .x/. Let us choose a
special class of .x/ such that
 D riri D riAi:
(2.281)
By (2.280) and (2.281),
ribAi D riAi   D 0:
(2.282)
The above is called the Lorentz gauge condition on the vector ﬁeld EbA.x/. Maxwell’s
equations (2.279) simplify into
bAi C Rij.x/  bAj .x/ D 0:
(2.283)
Electromagnetic ﬁeld equations (2.277i,ii) possess an additional covariance
under the conformal transformation (1.166i). We shall state and prove the following
theorem on this topic.
Theorem 2.5.3. Let a conformal transformation be furnished by
g::.x/ D exp Œ2.x/  g::.x/;
F::.x/ WD F::.x/;
F
ij .x/ WD g ik.x/ g jl.x/Fkl.x/:
(2.284)
Then, the electromagnetic ﬁeld equations (2.277i,ii) remain unchanged.
Proof. By (2.284), it follows that

Therefore, (2.277i) remains intact. Since (2.277ii) can be expressed without the
metric tensor, it remains valid automatically.

The classiﬁcation of electromagnetic ﬁeld equations (2.277i,ii) in ﬂat space–time

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
Now, we shall discuss the effects of electromagnetic energy–momentum–stress
tensor on the curvature of the space–time manifold. The appropriate ﬁeld equations
for this investigation are the coupled Einstein–Maxwell equations as furnished in
the following:

(2.290vi)
Remarks: (i) The special relativistic electromagnetic energy–momentum–stress
was introduced in (2.63).
(ii) In (2.290iii), the deﬁnition of the Hodge-star operation in (1.113) is used.
(iii) A
domain
of
space–time, in
which
(2.290i–vi) hold, is
called
an
electromagneto-vac domain.
(iv) Equation (2.290i) implies that T i
i.x/  0. Therefore, (2.290iv) yields that
R.x/  0.
The number of unknown functions versus the number of independent equations
in the system (2.290i–vi) is exhibited below:
(i) No. of unknown functions: 6.Fij / C 10.gij/ D 16.
(ii) No. of equations: 4.Mi D 0/C4.Mi D 0/C10.Eij D 0/C4.Ci D 0/ D 22.
(iii) No. of identities: 1.riMi  0/ C 1.ri Mi  0/ C 4.rjEij  0/ D 6.
(iv) No. of independent equations: 22  6 D 16.
Therefore, the system of (2.290i–vi) is exactly determinate!
Now, we shall discuss the variational derivation of the ﬁeld equations
(2.290i–vi). (Appendix 1 deals with variational derivation of differential equations.)
Example 2.5.5. Equations (2.290iii) yield (2.278i), which is
Fij .x/ D @iAj  @j Ai  riAj  rj Ai:
It turns out that the variational derivation demands the use of the 4-potential Ai.x/,
rather than Fij .x/. Using (A1.25), we write the Lagrangian function for the coupled
ﬁelds as

The above equation of a streamline is the appropriate (curved space–time) general-
ization of the Lorentz equation of motion (2.66) and (2.67) in the ﬂat space–time
scenario.
Here, we emphasize that the relativistic equations of motion for streamlines in
(2.256), (2.261iv), and (2.267) and equations of motion (2.272ii) for a solid particle
are all consequences of Einstein’s gravitational ﬁeld equations. These equations are
not added on as required in the corresponding non-general relativistic theories.
Now, we shall touch upon brieﬂy the algebraic properties of the antisymmetric
electromagnetic tensor ﬁeld
F::.x/ D .1=2/Fij.x/ dxi ^ dxj D F.a/.b/.x/ Qe.a/.x/ ˝ Qe.b/.x/:
The 4  4 antisymmetric matrix
	
F.a/.b/.x0/

does not possess any real, nonzero,
usual eigenvalues. However, the same matrix has invariant, (real) eigenvalues. The
invariant eigenvalue probelm can be posed as:
F.a/.b/.x0/  	.b/.x0/ D  d.a/.b/ 	.b/.x0/:
(2.300)

222

The Pseudo-Riemannian Space–Time Manifold M4
(Compare the above equation with equations in Example A3.5 of Appendix 3) It
follows from (2.300) that
 d.a/.b/ 	.a/.x0/ 	.b/.x0/ D 0:
(2.301)
Therefore, either the (invariant) eigenvalue  D 0 or the “invariant eigenvector”
	.a/.x0/ Ee.a/.x0/ is null or both.
Now, consider two ﬁelds deﬁned by
I.1/.x/ WD F.a/.b/.x/  F .a/.b/.x/;
(2.302i)
I.2/.x/ WD F.a/.b/.x/  F .a/.b/.x/:
(2.302ii)
(Here, the star stands for the Hodge-star operation in (1.113).) The ﬁeld I.1/.x/ is
a scalar or invariant. However, the ﬁeld I.2/.x/ is a pseudoscalar and
	
I.2/.x/

2 is
invariant.
We shall now introduce the physical or orthonormal components of the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld vectors. These are furnished by
E.˛/.x/ WD F.˛/.4/.x/;
(2.303i)
H.˛/.x/ WD ".˛/.ˇ/./ F .ˇ/./.x/:
(2.303ii)
(Compare the equations above with (2.55).)
Remark: The components E.˛/.x/ and H.˛/.x/ are not components of relativistic
vector ﬁelds.
The invariant in (2.302i) and the pseudoscalar in (2.302ii) can be expressed in
terms of electric and magnetic vectors as

(2.305)
We now choose the orthonormal tetrad

in a spe-

Since the right-hand side of the equation is an invariant, the equation is valid

We deﬁne a null electromagnetic ﬁeld by the condition  D 0, which implies

Therefore, a null electromagnetic ﬁeld physically represents the analog of a plane

We note here several properties from the above equations. First, that
lim
m!0C
R.a/.b/.c/.d/./  0. Therefore, the mass, m, of the central body is solely responsible
for the nonzero curvature of the surrounding space–time domain. Secondly, we
conclude that
lim
r!1 R.a/.b/.c/.d/./
D
0. Thus, the Schwarzschild universe is
asymptotically ﬂat in some sense.

Remark: The asymptotic symmetry group is not the Poincar´e group of ﬂat
Minkowski space–time but instead a larger group known as the Bondi–Metzner–
Sachs group which preserves the asymptotic structure of the metric [25,223].
1The line element in this form is found in (14) of Schwarzschild’s original paper [231].

We observe that the physical components R.a/.b/.c/.d/./ are also deﬁned and real
analytic in the interval 0 < r  2m. This region is outside the boundary of D in
(3.10). (The boundary r D 2m is called the Schwarzschild radius, a coordinate
singularity.) This puzzling situation will be properly explained in Chap.5 on black
holes.
Now we shall elucidate the exact interpretation of the symbol m > 0 occurring in
(3.9). We have already used the symbol m > 0 in (2.19i,ii), (2.25), (2.30), (2.31i,ii),
(2.32), (2.33), (2.67), (2.131), (2.141i), etc. In all these equations, we have used
m > 0 to denote the mass of a test particle following a certain space–time trajectory
(or world line). However, in the Schwarzschild metric in (3.9), the symbol m > 0
stands for the central mass causing the gravitational ﬁeld around it. In case we
reinstate temporarily the speed of light c and the Newtonian constant of gravitation
G, the Schwarzschild mass m D GM=c2. Here, M is the total central mass in these
units.
Example 3.1.2. In this example, we shall explore brieﬂy the non-Euclidean ge-
ometry of the two-dimensional spatial submanifold M2 of the Schwarzschild
space–time. Let the submanifold be furnished by
r D x1 D 1.u/ WD u1 ;

Fig. 3.1 Two-dimensional submanifold M2 of the Schwarzschild space–time. The surface repre-
senting M2 here is known as Flamm’s paraboloid [102]
Note that the above ratio is a positive-valued, monotonically decreasing function
of r. Moreover, the ratio diverges in the limit r ! .2m/C. Furthermore, in the limit
r ! 1, the ratio goes to 2, the Euclidean value.
Note that
@
@' is a Killing vector for the metric in (3.13). With all this information
at hand, we construct a qualitative picture for M2 in Fig. 3.1.
(Compare Figs. 3.1 and 2.8.) In the metric in (3.13), radial coordinate lines
are geodesics. Since these geodesics cannot be continued for the interval 0 <
r  2m, we conclude that the submanifold M2 and the Schwarzschild space–time
are geodesically incomplete.

Now we shall investigate timelike geodesics of the Schwarzschild space–time.
These represent world lines of inertial test particles in the spherically symmetric
gravitational ﬁeld. We use the proper time parameter s as given in (1.186). We
utilize the “squared Lagrangian” in (2.155) to express

The physical meaning of (3.17i) is that the areal velocity h is conserved. (See
Example 1.3.36.) Equation (3.17ii) implies that the total energy E of the test
particle is conserved. Such conservations of canonical momenta lead to a reduction
of the original Lagrangian. We shall state Routh’s theorem on this topic in an
N -dimensional manifold.
Theorem 3.1.3. Let the Lagrangian function L.xI u/ of 2N variables be of class
C 2 and possess the property det

For the proof, we suggest [159]. As an example of Routh’s procedure, we apply
the theorem to the Lagrangian (3.15) and conservation equations (3.17i,ii). The
corresponding twice reduced Lagrangian is furnished by

Fig. 3.2 Rosette motion of a planet and the perihelion shift
For the planet Mercury, the above equation amounts to 43  0300 per century,
which was previously inexplicable by Newtonian theory. We make a coordinate
transformation from polar to Cartesian (of Example 1.1.1) to visualize the planetary
motion in Fig. 3.2.
Remark: Within the scope of the differential equation (3.26ii), there exist orbits
which spiral around inward and eventually fall into the central body [35]. In-
spiralling orbits are simply nonexistent in the Newtonian theory of gravitation due
to a central point mass.
Now we shall explore null geodesics in the Schwarzschild space–time character-
ized by (3.9). We use an afﬁne parameter ˛ for the null curve. By changing from the
parameter s to ˛, virtually all (3.16i–iv), (3.17i,ii), (3.18)–(3.21) can be repeated.

The predicted value ' in (3.40) amounts to 1:7500 for a light ray that barely
misses the surface of the sun, and it has been conﬁrmed experimentally.
Now we shall deal with the third topic of physical interest. Optical or other
electromagnetic wave emissions from the Sun or other distant stars reveal shifts of
the standard wavelengths of known atomic spectral lines. The spectral shifts can be
usefully split into a part due to relative motions (between the star and the detector)
and a part due to gravitational ﬁelds. Since measured wavelengths or frequencies
are related to the proper times of the sources or the observers, we look again
into the Schwarzschild metric in (3.9). It will be simpler for our investigations to

Therefore, there is a change of proper time from one world line to another.
Thus, relative frequencies (which are inversely proportional to time) or relative
wavelengths (which are inversely proportional to frequency) of photons emitted

Spherically Symmetric Space–Time Domains
from those two world lines are shifted. This gives rise to what is known as
gravitational redshift. That is, electromagnetic waves emitted close to a gravitational
source will reach distant observers with a smaller frequency (longer wavelength)
than those emitted by a similar source further away from the gravitating object. This
effect has been very well conﬁrmed in many observations. For example, in the case
of the dense companion of the star Sirius, there is agreement between observation
and the prediction of general relativity in the frequency shift of spectral lines [15].
Remark: Figure 3.4 depicts the gravitational redshift in a coordinate chart corre-
sponding to a submanifold of the curved space–time manifold.
To summarize, there exist three critical phenomena associated with the
Schwarzschild space–time. These are given by:
1. Advance of the perihelion shift of Mercury,
2. Deﬂection of a light ray grazing the Sun,
3. Spectral redshift of light emission from a distant star.
The theory of general relativity is validated by all observations regarding the
above three phenomena and other experimental tests [264,265].

Spherically Symmetric Static Interior Solutions
Here we consider spherically symmetric space–time domains which are not vacuum
space–times. These space–times are useful approximations to the gravitational ﬁelds
produced inside of stars, for example.
As we are still dealing with spherical symmetry, the metric can still be taken to
be that of (3.1). The domain of consideration is now
D WD

.r; ; '; t/ W 0 < r1 < r < r2; 0 <  < ;
  < ' < ; 1 < t < 1

:
(3.43)
We often consider r D r2 to be the boundary of the star so that the metric for
r > r2 is given by the vacuum Schwarzschild metric (3.9). Alternatively, the matter
ﬁeld, as manifest in the components Tij, can fall off smoothly so that the solution
asymptotically approaches the Schwarzschild solution.
The interior ﬁeld equations and conservation equations reduce to

At this stage, all the ﬁeld equations and conservation equations are satisﬁed. With
the above prescriptions, we can furnish the most general solution of the system of
differential equations in (3.44i–vii). It is stated in the following theorem. (See [63].)
Theorem 3.2.1. Consider the spherically symmetric, static metric (3.1) and the

Here, m0 and k are two arbitrary constants of integration. Moreover, two differen-
tiable functions T 1

Proof. The ﬁeld equation (3.44iv) implies that
@1 .re˛/ D 1 C  r2 T 4

The above equation is a linear, ﬁrst-order, nonhomogeneous ordinary differential

(3.46)
(iii) Synge’s junction conditions (2.170) on the outer boundary of a spherical body
(at r D r2) imply the continuity of ˛.r/ and .r/ across r D r2. Furthermore,
the conditions imply that
T 1
1.r/jr2 D 0;
(3.47)
in the case where the boundary joins to the vacuum. For boundaries which join
two different types of matter, the radial pressure must be continuous.
We notice in the proof of Theorem 3.2.1 that two relevant ordinary differential
equations are linear. Therefore, a superposition of distinct solutions to these equa-
tions is also a solution. This feature gives rise to interesting physical consequences.
Consider two-dimensional coordinate charts of Figs. 3.2 and 3.3. In such a chart,
now we represent a spherical body of mass m0 and a concentric, thick spherical
shell of mass m1 as in Fig. 3.5.

(3.48)
Similarly, the metric function e.r/ can be determined. Usually in general relativity,
the space–time metric generated by two massive bodies interacting only gravitation-
ally cannot be static. The reason for this is that the nonlinear gravitational equations
inherently imply nontrivial equations of motion for bodies. (See [17].). As well,
physically, two distinct bodies interacting solely gravitationally cannot apply forces
on each other which counteract the gravitational attraction. However, the spherically
symmetric bodies in Fig. 3.5 are already in equilibrium (in some sense) due to the
fact that the shell, if self-interacting, can support itself against the gravitational pull
of the interior sphere. Hence, a static solution is possible. In Newtonian gravitational
theory, the equilibrium among concentric spherically symmetric bodies is well
known. It so happens that equilibria in Newtonian scenarios may lead to exact static
solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. (Consult Example 2.2.9.)
Now we shall apply Theorem 3.2.1 to the case of a spherically symmetric,
perfect ﬂuid body. (We have touched upon the case of a perfect ﬂuid in (2.182),
(2.257i–iv), and Example 2.3.1.) We will reiterate the energy–momentum–stress

(Here, we have set the constant k D 0.) Unlike in (3.45i,ii), the function T 1

now implies that T 1

Remark: For the case of a static, spherically symmetric perfect ﬂuid, many exact
solutions are cited in the books [118,239].
Example 3.2.3. Now we shall consider a domain of a spherically symmetric, static,
electro-vac universe (containing gravity and electrostatic ﬁelds only). The pertinent
ﬁeld equations are provided by the Einstein–Maxwell equations (2.290i–vi). In the
present context, we choose

F.˛/.ˇ/.x/  0 ;
@4F.i/.j /  0 D @3F.i/.j / :
(3.67)
The above equations indicate that only the radial component of the electric ﬁeld is
nonzero. Other electromagnetic ﬁeld components are assumed to vanish.
Maxwell’s equations M3./ D M2./ D 0 imply that
@2F41 D 0 D @3F41 ;

In the preceding considerations, we have assumed that the material energy
density is strictly positive. However, in the arena of static, spherically symmetric
space–time domains, assuming that energy conditions are not necessarily respected,
there may exist exotic materials which open up a “hollow tunnel” between two
branches of the same space–time. Such a scenario is provided by the existence of the
(so-called) wormhole. (See Fig. 2.17c.) The topic of wormholes will be discussed
brieﬂy in Appendix 6.

We investigate the above system of partial differential equations in the following

(3.78)
Here, the boundary curve r D B.t/, representing the boundary of a nonstatic
spherical body, is assumed to be twice differentiable. (See Fig. 3.6.)
Now, in a convex domain,4 the general solution of the system of partial
differential equations (3.77i–ix) will be provided. (See [63].)
Theorem 3.3.1. Let metric functions ˛.r; t/ and .r; t/ of (3.76) be of class C 3 in
the convex domain D of (3.78). Then, the general solution of the system of partial

Now we investigate the nonstatic, spherically symmetric metric (3.76) and
vacuum ﬁeld equations (2.164i) to derive Birkhoff’s theorem [20,144,184].

Theorem 3.3.2. Let metric functions ˛.r; t/ and .r; t/ of (3.76) be of class C 3 in
the rectangular coordinate domain
D WD f.r; t/ W 0 < r1  r; t1 < t < t2g :
Then, the general solution of the vacuum equations is transformable to the
Schwarzschild metric.
Proof. For vacuum equations (2.164i), we put T i

yields

Remark: One physical implication of Birkhoff’s theorem is that a pulsating,
spherically symmetric body cannot generate external gravitational waves (see
Appendix 5).
Now we shall derive the total mass function M.r; t/ and the boundary surface

The metric above implies a geodesic normal (or Gaussian normal) coordinate
chart of (1.160). The t-coordinate curves represent timelike geodesics. Let us
investigate ﬁeld equations (2.161i) and (2.166i) in the presence of an incoherent
dust modeled by (2.256). We assume a comoving chart (see p. 193) so that the 4-

Our strategy to solve the above system is the following mixed method:
(i) We prescribe T˛ˇ.::/  0; T˛4.::/  0.
(ii) We solve the equation E4

(iii) Next, we solve the equation E1

(iv) We deﬁne .r; t/ from the equation E4

(v) At this stage T4./ D 0 and all other ﬁeld equations are satisﬁed.

(3.94)
Here, M.r/ is the thrice differentiable, positive-valued, arbitrary function of

nonlinear differential equation (3.94). Now we shall interpret (3.94) in physical
terms. In the metric (3.88), the function Y.r; t/ plays the role of a “radius.” Consider
a particular point r0 in the interval .r1; r2/. Equation (3.94) yields

Now we shall touch upon the spherically symmetric, T-domain solutions. (See
[73,222].) The T -domain corresponds, for example, to the domain 0 < r < 2m of
metric (3.9). Here we have changed the notation for the coordinates, as what was
the radial coordinate is now a time coordinate and what was the time coordinate
is now a spatial coordinate. We also denote the stress–energy–momentum tensor
components by i
j./ to avoid confusion with the components of the stress–
energy–momentum tensor in the previous domain.

Caution: The solution (4.9) is valid only in the open-subset D which excludes
points on the z-axis. To analytically extend the solution to the z-axis, we need
to check the existence of tangent planes (or “local ﬂatness”) at those points. To
test the local ﬂatness, choose a point .0; zc/ as the center of a “horizontal circle”
in the three-dimensional coordinate space of Fig. 4.1. The limit of the ratio of
circumference divided by “radius” of the spatial geometry in (4.7) is given by

The only singularity of the above metric is at .%; z/ D .0; 0/: There is a peculiarity

spherically symmetric (since it is a function of the particular combination %2Cz2),

Fig. 4.2 Two axially symmetric bodies in “Euclidean coordinate spaces”
the metric (4.13) cannot be transformed into the Schwarzschild metric (3.9).
The reason for this disparity is that the potential w.%; z/ in (4.11) is spherically
symmetric in the “Euclidean coordinate space.” However, the non-Euclidean spatial
hypersurface induced by (4.13) for t D const. does not admit spherical symmetry.
(Compare Fig. 2.8.)

The axially symmetric potential equation (4.10i) is linear. Therefore, super-
position of several potential functions is itself a potential function. It seems that
several axially symmetric, static bodies in Newtonian gravitation can generate
a corresponding exact, static solution in Einstein’s theory! But in Newtonian
gravitation, several axially symmetric, massive bodies may or may not be in
equilibrium. How does Einstein’s theory distinguish these different cases? One
answer is the use of the criterion .0C; z/ D 0: Now, we shall put forward another
criterion that is physically more transparent. Let us consider two, axially symmetric,
massive bodies. One is a spherical body, another is a solid ring. (See Fig. 4.2.)
Consider the 1-form Q!.%; z/ and its exterior derivative in the following:

Since r2w is proportional to the mass density in Newtonian theory, the above
equation is proportional to the net “Newtonian gravitational force” along the z-axis
on a vertical section of the solid ring. (See the reference [173].) Since there is a
massive sphere on top of the ring in Fig. 4.2, it is clear that the net force in (4.15)
cannot vanish. Thus, from (4.14), d Q!./ 6 0::./: Therefore, the integrability
condition for differential equations (4.10ii,iii) is violated. There exists no solution
of the ﬁeld equations in this static scenario. It is in this way that the nonlinear ﬁeld
equations of general relativity make a physically satisfying, subtle impact on the
axially symmetric case. In essence, the above static scenario, which cannot exist
in equilibrium in the Newtonian sense due to the fact that the net force cannot
vanish, also cannot be in equilibrium in the relativistic sense due to violation of
the integrability conditions.
(Remarks: (i) In case the sphere and the ring are concentric, there can be equilibrium
and static solutions do exist. (ii) The actual curved submanifold corresponding to
Fig. 4.2 is quite different.)
Example 4.1.3. Next, consider the case of two “gravitational monopoles” on the
vertical axis [44]. The corresponding Newtonian potential is furnished by

Therefore, exact static solutions do exist on the vertical axis on the interval

Mathematically, we can make the solution valid by incising the interval correspond-
ing to .z1; z2/ from the manifold. (Physically speaking, this process can be viewed
as placing an ignored, massless, rigid, linear strut between two massive particles at
.0; z1/ and .0; z2/ in order to balance the gravitational attraction.)

Example 4.1.4. In Example 4.1.2, the spherically symmetric Newtonian potential
failed to generate the Schwarzschild metric out of the Weyl metric in (4.7).
Naturally, a question arises as to which of the Newtonian potentials will generate
then the Schwarzschild metric. This query will be answered shortly. Consider the
Newtonian potential of a ﬁnite, massive, linear rod of length l D 2m > 0 on the
z-axis. This potential is provided by

The system is obviously underdetermined. Therefore, three of the eight unknown
functions can be prescribed. There are several mixed methods available. (However,
ideally, we have to satisfy energy conditions (2.194i–iii), too!)

Therefore, exact, static solutions due to several axially symmetric, massive, charged

electrostatic repulsion is exactly cancelling the gravitational attraction. (The metric

The General Static Field Equations
We have dealt with static, spherically symmetric equations in Sects. 3.1 and 3.2.
Moreover, we have examined static, axially symmetric metrics in the preceding
section. Now, we shall investigate the general, static ﬁeld equations of general
relativity. We assume that a timelike Killing vector ﬁeld

we assume that the metric admits a discrete isometry (of time reﬂection)bx4 D x4:

We are now in a position to compare Newtonian gravitational theory with

Let us now explore the static ﬁeld equations (4.40i–iii). Moreover, let us consider
only the vacuum scenario by setting Tij./  0: We would like to derive these
equations by a variational principle, as discussed in Appendix 1. An appropriate

The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations (A1.20i) yield exactly the required
static, vacuum ﬁeld equations. Now, we may wonder how the reduced three-
dimensional action integral (4.43iii) is deduced from the original four-dimensional
Einstein–Hilbert action integral from the Lagrangian in (A1.25). To answer this
question, we ﬁrst choose a (simpliﬁed) four-dimensional domain of Cartesian
product:

The above action integral leads to the “potential equation” (4.41ii). The integral

introducing the line element:

(4.48)
Note that the above metric remains invariant under the nonhomogeneous, linear
transformation:
bw D ˙w C k;
(4.49)

294

Static and Stationary Space–Time Domains
where k is an arbitrary constant. Thus, it is clear that the action integral (4.47)
remains invariant under the transformation (4.49) from w ! bw: Therefore, a
vacuum, exact solution with
ıg˛ˇ.x/ and w.x/ can generate a new vacuum, exact
solution with
ıg˛ˇ.x/ and bw.x/:
Example 4.2.1. Consider the particular transformation

Let
us
classify
the
system
of
three
semilinear,
second
order
p.d.e.s
(4.51i–iii). Each of these three p.d.e.s is hyperbolic according to the criterion
(A2.27i), (A2.49), and (A2.51). Since (principal) terms with second derivatives
occur singly in each p.d.e., the system is decoupled for the purpose of classiﬁcation.
Therefore, the characteristic matrix and the determinant are furnished by
Œ .::/ D diag Œ@1; @2; @2; @3; @3; @1, det Œ .::/ D .@1@2@3/2. Thus,
the system is clearly hyperbolic with characteristic surfaces governed by
@1  @2  @3 D 0:
(4.52)
(Across any of the characteristic surfaces, there may occur jump discontinuities
of the metric functions. See (A2.5).) Previously, we concluded with a harmonic
coordinate chart that the system of equations (4.41i,ii) is elliptic. Now with an
orthogonal coordinate chart, we infer that the system of (4.51i–vi) is mixed elliptic-
hyperbolic. On the other hand, we have concluded after (A2.23iv) that classiﬁcation
of a p.d.e. remains unchanged under a coordinate transformation. To resolve this
dilemma, we note that in the case of a single p.d.e. (A2.23ii), the unknown function
w.x/ is treated as an invariant, scalar ﬁeld. But in the case of the system of ﬁeld
equation (4.41i), the unknown metric functions
ıg˛ˇ.x/ undergo the transformation
of a .0 C 2/th order tensor ﬁeld. It is this additional set of degrees of freedom that
allows the system to change character.
Now, we shall deal with a star-shaped domain D  RN and a second-order,
linear, elliptic differential operator:

Here, the metric g::.x/ is assumed to be continuous and positive-deﬁnite. Moreover,
the vector ﬁeld Eh.x/ is assumed to be continuous. Clearly, the Laplacian operator

is a special case of (4.53). A function w.x/ satisfying r2w D 0 is called a
harmonic function. (In physical applications, we often call such a function a
potential function.)
We shall now state Hopf’s theorem and also the maximum–minimum principle.
Theorem 4.2.2. Let a function w 2 C 2 .D  RN I R/ satisfy the weak inequality
LŒw.x/  0 for all x 2 D: If there exists an interior point x0 2 D such that
w.x/  w.x0/ for all x 2 D; then w.x/  w.x0/ D constant: On the other hand,
if LŒw.x/  0 and w.x/  w.x0/ for an interior point x0; then w.x/  w.x0/ D
constant:
For proof, consult [268].
Theorem 4.2.3. Let a function w.x/ be harmonic in D  RN : Moreover, let the
function w.x/ be continuous up to and on the boundary @D: Then its maximum
and minimum are attained on boundary points. Furthermore, the maximum or the
minimum are attained at an interior point if and only if w.x/ is constant-valued.
For proof, see [268].

minimum value  ln.b1/ are attained on some points on the boundary @D:

We shall now apply Theorem 4.2.3 to the static ﬁeld equations (4.41i,ii).

4.2
The General Static Field Equations
297
Theorem 4.2.5. Let static ﬁeld equations (4.41i) and Laplace’s equation (4.41ii)
hold in a star-shaped domain D  R3: Let w.x/ be continuous up to and on @D:
Moreover, let w.x/ attain an extremum at an interior point x0 2 D: Then, the four-
dimensional domain D  R is ﬂat.
Proof. Consider Laplace’s equation (4.41ii). By Theorem 4.2.3, w.x/ is constant-
valued in D [ @D: Therefore, ﬁeld equation (4.41i) implies that
ı
R˛ˇ.x/  0 in D:
Thus, the three-dimensional metric

the four-dimensional metric in (4.39) implies that the domain D WD D  R is ﬂat.

Now, we shall discuss a special class of static metrics. Consider the static metric
given in (4.39). Let the three-dimensional, positive-deﬁnite metric
ıg::.x/ be con-
formally ﬂat. Then, the four-dimensional metric in (4.39) is called a conformastat
metric. By the deﬁnition in page 71, a conformastat metric can locally be reduced to

We shall now derive all the conformastat, vacuum solutions.

for the domain D WD D  R  R4: Let the three-dimensional metric
ıg::.x/ be

the two-dimensional level surface w.x/ D const. is a surface of constant curvature
in the domain D  R3: (ii) Furthermore, the four-dimensional conformastat metric
reduces to one of the (a) Kasner, (b) Schwarzschild, and (c) pseudo-Schwarzschild
metrics.
2York’s tensor is actually a rank-two tensor related to the one in (4.56) [269].

Proof. Here, we shall provide an abridged version of the proof. (See [52].) We
have to solve the three-dimensional tensor equations (4.57), (4.41i), and (4.42i).

There exist three subcases, namely, (i) ab D 0; (ii) ab > 0; and (iii) ab < 0:
In subcase (i), the only nonﬂat solution is reducible to the Kasner metric:

Remarks: (i) Synge has proved earlier [243] that
4pg11.x/ is a Newtonian potential
for a conformastat vacuum solution. That conclusion is obvious for metrics
(4.64i,ii). It is not so obvious for the metric in (4.64iii).
(ii) In a conformastat domain of the space–time, as characterized by (4.55), the
“coordinate speed” of a photon is independent of the spatial direction of
propagation.

The physical meaning of above equation is that the Poynting vector of a static

For the nontrivial electromagneto-vac cases, (4.80) yields three possibilities:

The ﬁrst possibility is the electro-vac case. The second possibility is the magneto-
vac case. (The magneto-vac case is mathematically equivalent to the electro-vac
case, except the condition in
(4.79).) The third possibility is the nontrivial
electromagneto-vac case. In such a scenario, let us investigate equation (4.80) more
closely. It leads to the linear dependence:

(4.82)
Here, k ¤ 0 and d are arbitrary constants of integration. The physical meaning
of (4.82) is that “the static electric ﬁeld vector is a constant-multiple of the static

Equations (4.83ii–iv) are formally magneto-vac equations (as if the electric ﬁeld has
disappeared).
Feynman has already noticed in special relativistic electrodynamics [97] that an
electrically charged magnet generates a stationary Poynting vector EE.x/  EH.x/
around it, which implies that the space–time generated by such a system must
be nonstatic (as there is energy ﬂow around the magnet). This can be deduced
from (4.82) where we can see that Einstein’s static ﬁeld equations do not admit
the existence of an electrically charged static magnet. (There is a possibility of
experimental veriﬁcation of this effect [212] in the context of conservation of
angular momentum. Also, see [54].)

[26] and Melvin [180]. The metric and the magnetic potential in Weyl coordinates

Theorem 4.2.10. Consider ﬁeld equations (4.88i–iv) with (4.87) in a star-shaped
domain D  R3: Let functions .x/ > 0 and .x/ ¤ 0 be of class C 1I the function
A.x/ be of class C 2I and functions w.x/;
ıg˛ˇ.x/ be of class C 3 in D: (i) Then,
w.x/ and A.x/ are functionally related. (ii) In case this functional relationship is
given by the quadratic equation (4.70), the relationship has to be a perfect square.
(iii) Moreover, the three-dimensional metric
ıg::.x/ is ﬂat Euclidean, and the ﬁeld
equations reduce to one elliptic equation:

Remarks:
(i) In the preceding theorem, we have proved that inside a charged
dust (a), a functional relationship between w.x/ and A.x/ must hold, and (b)
Assuming Weyl’s equation (4.70), the Majumdar–Papapetrou condition (4.94)
is a consequence and (c) the conformastat metric is valid. (Similar conclusions
will be proved in Chap. 8 dealing with general relativistic wave ﬁelds, as
originally shown by Das [49].) Therefore, we shall call the metric in (4.97),
the Weyl–Majumdar–Papapetrou–Das (or W–M–P–D) metric.
(ii) De and Raychaudhuri [71] have proved the condition j.x/j D

under weaker assumptions.

This approximate solution was considered long before the exact metric of Kerr was
discovered. (Originally, this approximate metric was studied by Lense and Thirring
[165] and others [39].) There are some interesting physical consequences of the
metric in (4.135). Some of these are listed in the following:
(i) The bending of light rays around the rotating sun are slightly asymmetric about
two opposite sides. (See [46].)
(ii) The orbital plane of a planet shifts very slowly. The actual nodal shift of the
planet Venus was originally thought not to be totally explained by (4.135). (See
[84].) However, more reﬁned calculations and analysis of more accurate data
seem to indicate that the observed value is within experimental agreement with
general relativity [81,139,211].
(iii) An artiﬁcial satellite orbiting around the Earth can experimentally verify the
time dilatation inherent in (4.135) [47]. In fact, modern Global Positioning
Systems (G.P.S.) exploit (4.135)! (See [9].)
(iv) The dragging of inertial frames is a consequence of (4.135). Einstein has
commented: “ ...Mach was on the right road in his thought that inertia depends
on a mutual action of matter...A rotating hollow body must generate inside of
itself a “Coriolis ﬁeld,” which deﬂects bodies in the sense of rotation, ...” [89].
Now, we shall touch upon brieﬂy the charged version of the Kerr solution. It is

where e represents the charge parameter of the gravitating body. Note that in the
limit e ! 0; the metric (4.136) reduces to the Kerr metric in (4.134). On the other
hand, in the limit a ! 0; the Kerr–Newman metric of (4.136) goes over into the
Reissner–Nordstr¨om–Jeffery metric of (3.74).
A possible interior for the Kerr metric was originally investigated by Hogan
[134]. However, junction conditions were not satisﬁed. Others are summarized in
[40]. We explore now the same problem in the cylindrical coordinates of (4.111ii).
We write the interior metric in a slightly modiﬁed form as

Now, we are in a position to state and prove a theorem about a slowly rotating,
deformable, solid shell, joined very smoothly across a prescribed external boundary
to the vacuum Kerr metric.
Theorem 4.3.2. Let the functions b; W#; N #; ˇ#; and ˛# appearing in metric
(4.143) belong to the class C

satisﬁed with the metric in (4.143) in the domain D WD D.2/  .; /  R by
deﬁning Tij ./ WD 	1Gij : Then, interior metric (4.143) joins continuously to
the Kerr metric across the exterior boundary % D b.z/: Moreover, Synge’s junction
conditions (2.170) and the I–S–L–D junction conditions (2.171) are satisﬁed on the
exterior boundary.

4.3
Axially Symmetric Stationary Space–Time Domains
327
Proof. It is clear that the interior ﬁeld equations (4.140i–vi) (and equilibrium
conditions (4.141i,ii)) are satisﬁed. From the structure of the interior metric (4.143),
it follows that the interior metric components and their partial derivatives (up to and
including the third order) join continuously across the external boundary to those of
the Kerr metric. Thus, the junction conditions are automatically satisﬁed.

Remarks:
(i) By the Riemann mapping theorem of complex analysis [191], the
boundary % D b.z/ can always be mapped into a circular arc.
(ii) By choosing sufﬁciently small positive numbers j"j; j"1j; j"2j; and j"4j; the
energy–momentum–stress tensor matrix


becomes diagonalizable.
(Consult Problem # 7 of Exercise 4.3.)
(iii) Since W#; N #; ˇ#; and ˛# are arbitrary functions of class C
3./; the metric
(4.143) provides a class of inﬁnitely many interior solutions.
(iv) The behavior of the metric in (4.143) on and inside the inner boundary % D
b0.z/ needs further investigations.
Example 4.3.3. Consider the external, circular boundary % D
p
1  z2 , jzj < 1.
It generates a spherically symmetric solid body in the three-dimensional coordinate
space. Let us choose positive integers as n D n1 D n2 D n3 D 4: Moreover, choose
for small positive numbers as j"j D j"1j D j"3j D .1=9/: Furthermore, let the total
mass be m D 1: Now, we choose the auxiliary functions as

The General Stationary Field Equations

The stationary vacuum ﬁeld equations (4.148i–iii) are analogous to the static,
electro-vac equations (4.67i–iii) (and static magneto-vac equations (4.83ii–iv)).
Therefore, for a special class of exact solutions, we assume a functional relationship:

We should mention that the Papapetrou-Ehlers class of solutions can involve
“exotic sources.” This is because, for this class, either the “total mass” is zero, or
there exist wire (or string) singularities. (See Problem #4ii of Exercise 4.4.)
Now, consider the quadratic function of  in (4.157). Let us try to pursue the
Majumdar-Papapetrou “perfect square” condition in (4.73i) for (4.157). If we set
k2 D c0 C c2
1 D 0 in (4.157), then we obtain e4w D .  c1/2 < 0: But
this condition is impossible in the realm of real numbers. However, in case the
four-dimensional differential manifold is a positive-deﬁnite Riemannian manifold,
such exact solutions are mathematically viable. Such solutions can give rise to
gravitational instantons, to be discussed in Appendix 7. (These solutions are
important for some approaches to quantum gravity, as well as in some aspects of
cosmology [127].)
Now, we shall explore an exact solution of the stationary ﬁeld equations
(4.153i,ii) employing an orthonormal triad.

The equations above have direct physical interpretations. Consider the three terms
in the left-hand side of the equations in (4.186). The ﬁrst term corresponds to the
“gravitational force density.” The second term stands for the elastic force density.
The third term indicates the “gravo-magnetic force density.” Therefore, (4.186)
represents general relativistic equilibrium conditions for a deformable solid body
in a state of steady motion. These equations are consequences of the Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations.
We have now completed investigations of the stationary ﬁeld equations of general
relativity. In closing, we want to emphasize that the whole of this chapter deals only
with local solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.

inﬁnite wire singularity to the material body so that there exists no closed

Black Holes

Spherically Symmetric Black Holes
The phenomenon of a massive body imploding into a black hole is a fascinating
topic to investigate. Nowadays, the possible detection of supermassive black holes in
the centers of galaxies [96,187] makes these studies extremely relevant. A historical
survey and review of current research in black hole physics may be found in [72].
Investigations on black holes historically started from the Schwarzschild metric
of (3.9) expressed, with slightly different notation, as

Clearly, some of the metric tensor components in (5.1) are undeﬁned for br D 2m;
the Schwarzschild radius. However, the corresponding orthonormal components of
the curvature tensor in (3.12) are real-analytic for 0 < br: Therefore, the space–time
geometry is completely smooth at br D 2m; but the Schwarzschild coordinate chart
is unable to cover br D 2m: (Recall that the spherical polar coordinate chart of
Example 1.1.2 cannot cover the North or the South pole.)
Eddington [82], Painlev´e [203], and Gullstrand [119] extended the Schwarzschild
chart on and beyond the Schwarzschild radius. Eddington employed one null
coordinate in his construction. (Finkelstein [100] also similarly extended the same
with one null coordinate.) Lemaˆıtre [163] used the geodesic normal time coordinate
(or comoving coordinates) for the extension whereas Synge [241] devised a doubly
null coordinate chart to extend all the previous charts for the maximal extension of
the original Schwarzschild chart. A modiﬁcation of Synge’s chart was constructed
independently by Kruskal [153] and Szekeres [245]. It is the commonly used chart
now for the maximal extension of the Schwarzschild chart.

Figure 5.1 depicts mappings (5.3) and (5.5) from the Lemaˆıtre chart into the
Schwarzschild chart and the T -domain chart (with  D const.; ' D const.).
Let us elaborate more on the physical aspects of Fig. 5.1. There is an oriented,
semi-inﬁnite, straight line segment in the Lemaˆıtre chart. It is parallel to the t-axis.
Thus, it can represent a test particle following a timelike geodesic. The segment
between two solid dots is a ﬁnite interval, physically representing the ﬁnite proper
time elapsed between those two events. The part of the line segment that is mapped
into the Schwarzschild chart is a semi-inﬁnite curve asymptotic to the vertical line
br D 2m: Thus, an observer in the Schwarzschild universe concludes that the test

354
5
Black Holes
particle takes “ inﬁnite coordinate time bt ” to reach br D 2m: (But from the preimage
in the Lemaˆıtre chart, it is evident that only a ﬁnite proper time is involved.)
Therefore, an observer “at inﬁnity” of the Schwarzschild space–time never sees a
massive particle freely falling into the region characterized by br  2m. Similarly,
the other ﬁnite part of the line segment is mapped into a semi-inﬁnite curve in the
T -domain chart. It is asymptotic to the horizontal straight line T D 2m: The curve
terminates on the R-axis where there is a singularity of the curvature tensor. The
proper time along this curve is also ﬁnite.
Now, we shall explore the inclined straight line r  t D .4m=3/ in the Lemaˆıtre
chart. It is the image of the parametrized curve:
r D X 1.˛/ WD f .˛/;
 D X 2.˛/ WD 0 D const.;
' D X 3.˛/ WD '0 D const.;
t D X 4.˛/ WD f .˛/  .4m=3/;
˛ 2 R:

(5.8)
The above equation reveals a loss of one dimension as in the null hypersurface of
Example 2.1.17. This null hypersurface N3 is called an event horizon.1
We shall show later that some massive particles propagating in the Schwarzschild
space–time can cross the event horizon N3 only to eventually end their journey into
the ultimate singularity at r D t: Moreover, we shall demonstrate later that from the
domain D0
s in Fig. 5.1, photons pursuing null geodesics cannot come out of event
horizon N3 into the external Schwarzschild universe. That is why the domain D0
s is
called a (spherically symmetric) black hole.
1Note that by (3.42), the event horizon is a null hypersurface of “inﬁnite redshift.”

In Newtonian gravitation, the above equation represents the radial velocity of a
test particle in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric gravitating body. (Consult
(3.101).) This equation also indicates that the “Newtonian kinetic energy” is
exactly balanced by the “gravitational potential energy.” A possible graph of such
a motion can be provided by (5.9). Particularly, the equation .br /3 D .b /2 yields
the continuous, piecewise real-analytic, semi-cubical parabola (with a cusp). (See
Fig. 5.2.)
In the graph of Fig. 5.2, the segment for b > 0 represents a particle coming
from “inﬁnity” that merges with a (idealized) central body. However, the segment
of the curve for b < 0 indicates the trajectory of a particle, ejected from the
center, which possesses exactly the “escape velocity” (reaches “inﬁnity” with zero
kinetic energy). The mathematics of Newtonian gravitation coincides with that of
the general relativity in this scenario. However, in general relativity, there exist four
distinct domains corresponding to (1) .2m/3=2 < b; (2) 0 < b < .2m/3=2; (3)
.2m/3=2 < b < 0; and b < .2m/3=2: The ﬁrst domain with 0 < 2m < br
corresponds to the Schwarzschild space–time. The second domain with 0 < b <
.2m/3=2 indicates a spherically symmetric black hole. The other two domains will
be explained later.

The above metric was ﬁrst derived by Synge [241]. It is regular at br D 2m:
Moreover, the metric represented the maximal extension of the Schwarzschild chart
for the ﬁrst time (as far as we know).2 There is a loss of two dimensions on the
hypersurfacebr D 2m, indicating that it is null. (Compare with (3.8).)

Remarks: (i) In Fig. 5.5, the const. " > 0 denotes a sufﬁciently small, positive
constant.
(ii) An equation like “br D 2m” indicates the image of some boundary points in the
correspondingbr bt plane.
Now, we shall interpret Fig. 5.5 in physical terms. For that purpose, we make another

Fig. 5.5 Four domains covered by the doubly null, u  v coordinate chart
We shall now physically interpret Fig. 5.6. We note that radial, null geodesics
from (5.19) and (5.31) are governed by the differential equations:

Therefore, straight lines, parallel to u-axis or v-axis in Fig. 5.6, represent all
possible radial, null geodesics. Among these, straight lines parallel to the u-axis
(oriented upward) represent incoming null rays falling toward the center. On the

other hand, straight lines parallel to the v-axis represent outgoing null rays. (These
interpretations of “incoming” and “outgoing” are valid only on the right-hand side
of the u-axis.)
If an (idealized) observer (not necessarily geodesic) is represented by the oriented
vertical line (on the right-hand side of the u-axis in Fig. 5.6), then it is clear
to visualize forward light cones, incoming light rays, and outgoing light rays
emanating along this timelike world line. It is evident from Fig. 5.6 that all incoming
rays originating in
ı
DI and crossing the event horizon end up at the singularity
at .
ıx/2  .
ıt/2 D 1: On the other hand, outgoing rays emitted in
ı
DI; cannot
cross the event horizon and remain forever in the external (Schwarzschild) universe.
However, an incoming ray or an outgoing ray, emitted in the domain
ı
DII, remains
inside the domain
ı
DII: Or, in other words, neither incoming nor outgoing rays can
cross the event horizon to come out of the domain
ı
DII into the external universe.
Now, consult Fig. 5.1 in the Lemaˆıtre chart. There, timelike radial geodesics cross
the event horizon to terminate on the singularity. Also, in Fig. 5.6, the world line
(parallel to the
ıt-axis) crosses the event horizon never to come out of the domain
ı
DII: Therefore, this domain
ı
DII is appropriately called a black hole. However, not

366
5
Black Holes
all timelike world lines originating in
ı
DI end up inside the black hole
ı
DII: For
example, consider an accelerated observer in a rocket who traverses the world line
br D k > 2m; b D const.; b' D const. His or her world line is depicted by
a rectangular hyperbola with asymptote br D 2m in
ı
DI. (Compare the image of
br D 2m C " in Fig. 5.5.) Let the world line start from the eventbr D k; bt D 0: The
proper time along the world line is given by (3.42) as

Therefore, lim


! 1: Thus, this observer will never reach the event horizon
nor will he observe the black hole in his life time! (This statement is pictorially
obvious in Fig. 5.5.)
Now, let us discuss the domain
ı
DIV: Light rays come out into both external
universes
ı
DI and
ı
DIII: However, no light ray can enter into
ı
DIV from other domains.
Similarly, massive particles can only come out of this domain and cannot enter
into it. Therefore, the domain
ı
DIV is appropriately named as a white hole.
Every photon originating inside the black hole
ı
DII must end up into the
singularity (at .
ıx/2  .
ıt/2 D 1). No photon or massive particle from
ı
DI or
ı
DII can
travel into the dual universe
ı
DIII or the white hole
ı
DIV: (However, in case tachyons
exist in nature, they can cross these causal barriers!)
Finally, we note that the singularities in the black hole
ı
DII and the white hole
ı
DIV are spacelike.
Now let us express explicitly the four-dimensional, maximal extension of the
Schwarzschild chart. We use (5.19), (5.24)–(5.27), and (5.29) to write

nate. In fact, Qr is spacelike for 0 < 2m < Qr and timelike for 0 < Qr < 2m:
(ii) There is a loss of two dimensions in (5.33iv) since the event horizon character-
ized by uv D 0 is a null hypersurface. (Compare with (5.8) and (5.17i).)
(iii) By the footnote on page 360, (5.33iv) can be deduced.

(ii) The metrics in (5.33i,ii) and (5.34i) are all called the Kruskal–Szekeres metrics.
(See [184].)
(iii) The Kruskal–Szekeres extensions of the Schwarzschild chart are all non-static.
However, both the domains corresponding to
ı
DI and
ı
DIII (of Fig. 5.6) are
transformable to static metrics by Birkhoff’s Theorem 3.3.2.
(iv) The Kruskal–Szekeres metric (5.33i) is not asymptotically ﬂat in the sense that
guv ! 0 as Qr ! 1. However, Synge’s doubly null coordinate chart in (5.17i)
is asymptotically ﬂat in the sense that gOuOv ! 1 asbr ! 1.
Finally, we express the metric (5.34i) explicitly in terms of the Lambert

Figures 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6 are all drawn in coordinate planes R2: Thus, these ﬁgures
“appear” as if they belong to “Euclidean planes.” The actual curved geometries,
associated with these domains, are worthwhile to visualize. (Compare Figs. 1.4, 2.8,
and 3.1.) That is why we shall investigate various, two-dimensional, curved
submanifolds of the four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold corresponding
to the metric in (5.35).
Firstly, consider the two-dimensional submanifold characterized by

Now, we shall investigate a spherically symmetric stellar body collapsing into a

physically implies the conservation of the total energy for a unit mass test particle.)
We consider here only the parabolic case with " D 0: (Physically, it means that
the potential energy exactly cancels the kinetic energy.) The ﬁeld equation (5.44ii)

Note that the above metric, restricted to the external domain Dext of (5.49iv),
reduces exactly to the Lemaˆıtre metric in (5.2). Moreover, the interior metric
components, and their derivatives up to the third order, join continuously to those of
the exterior metric components.
Now, we utilize (5.42), (5.43), (5.49i)–(5.49iii), and (5.50) to depict the collapse
of a general class of dust balls into black holes in Fig. 5.10.

Remarks:
(i) The coordinates r and t are spacelike and timelike, respectively,
everywhere in the space–time domain D4 of (5.50).
(ii) The congruence of oriented, vertical lines in Fig. 5.10 indicate timelike, radial
geodesics. These represent world lines of a special class of dust particles
collapsing into a black hole and eventually ending up into the singularity at
r D t: (Note that lim

(iii) By (5.48) and (5.47i), it is clear that lim
r!0C ŒY.r; t/  0 for t < 0. Therefore,
the corresponding interval on the t-axis represents physically the center of the
material body.
(iv) The spherically symmetric body is starting to collapse from rest in the “inﬁnite
past.”
Next we shall investigate coordinate transformations in the external universe.
Using the inverse coordinate transformation of (5.3), the coordinate transformation

Using (5.51) and Fig. 5.10, we demonstrate the implosion of the spherically
symmetric stellar body into a black hole in the arena of the Kruskal–Szekeres
coordinate chart (with suppressed angular coordinates) in Fig. 5.11.
Remark: In the Kruskal–Szekeres chart of Fig. 5.11, the collapse into a black hole
is fully covered in domain DI [ DII [ fboundaryg: The domains DIII and DIV of
Fig. 5.5 are not needed.
Figures 5.10 and 5.11 are drawn in domains of the (Euclidean) coordinate
plane R2: The actual curved geometry of the corresponding space–time is not
revealed. For that purpose, consider the two-dimensional (positive-deﬁnite) surface

We have a general class of space–time metrics in (5.50) representing the collapse

We shall now state and prove a theorem about the class of mass functions in (5.59).
Theorem 5.1.2. Let the total mass function M.r/ be deﬁned by
(5.59) (which
involves one arbitrary constant and two arbitrary slack functions). Then in the open
interval .0; b/, the following equations and inequalities hold:
.i/ M.r/ > 0;
.ii/ lim
r!0C M.r/ D 0;
.iii/ M 0.r/ > 0;
.iv/ lim
r!b M.r/ D m;
.v/ lim
r!b M 0.r/ D 0:
Moreover, lim
r!0C
ˇˇR.a/.b/.c/.d/.r; t/
ˇˇ < eˇ, thus, are bounded for t < 0: Furthermore,
the resulting interior metric inherent in (5.50) joins very smoothly to the external
Lemaˆıtre metric in
(5.2) at the boundary r D b, t < b: Synge’s junction
conditions (2.170) and I–S–L–D jump conditions (2.171) are all satisﬁed on the
boundary. Finally, all three energy conditions (2.190)– (2.192) are valid inside the
material body collapsing into a black hole.
Proof. The parts (i)–(v) can be proved from the deﬁnition in (5.59) and (5.57)
and (5.58). The part involving boundedness of the curvature tensor is provable
from equations (5.55i–iv). Smooth joining of the interior to the exterior is evident
from (5.59), (5.49i–v), and the resultant metric in (5.50).
Now, we shall check Synge’s junction conditions at the boundary. The unit

Obviously, the above functions are continuous across the boundary. Thus, I-S-L-D
jump conditions hold.

from (5.43) that the only nonzero component of Tij./ is given by

Now, we shall explore the curvature tensor components of the Kerr metric

Thus, the metric in (5.61ii) is given by polynomial functions. The Kerr space–time
in various coordinate systems is also reviewed in [255].
Remark: Computer-based, symbolic computation is easier with polynomial func-
tions than with trigonometric functions. (See the Appendix 8.))

furnished by

We notice in the domain (5.60iv) that the signature of the metric is C2: However,
some of the metric tensor components and some of the eigenvalues change sign in
the interior domains but in such a way that the signature remains the same!
Now let us try to visualize the various functions in (5.68) and the corresponding
graphs in the   r coordinate plane. Moreover, we also map these graphs into the
x2  x3 plane by the transformation x2 D r sin ; x3 D r cos : The resulting
graphs are exhibited in Fig. 5.14.
Now let us explore the physical interpretations of the various horizons. Consider
the Killing vector ﬁeld @

@
@x4 for the Kerr metric in (5.60i). We derive from (5.69)
that

Therefore, the Killing vector
@
@x4 becomes spacelike inside R./ < r < RC./:
Thus, the hypersurface r D RC./ is called the stationary limit surface. (It is
also called the outer ergosurface.) The domain denoted as the ergosphere is
characterized by inequalities rC < r < RC./: (See [106,253].)
Next, let us derive the event horizons for the Kerr space–time. It is well known
that a three-dimensional null hypersurface S./ D const. (with a two-dimensional
metric) must satisfy the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (A2.19ii):
g::./ ŒdS; dS D gij ./  @iS  @j S D 0
with
ıij  @iS  @j S > 0:
(5.72)
From the Kerr space–time metric in (5.60i), the hypersurface r DW S./ D const.
satisﬁes the null condition in (5.72), provided
g11./  .@1r/2 D .r  rC/  .r  r/
˙./
D 0:
(5.73)
Therefore, the three-dimensional hypersurfaces r D rC and r D r are null. The
null hypersurface r D rC turns out to be the event horizon.5
Now, let us go back to Example 5.2.1 and (5.64). The curvature singularity of
the Kerr metric in (5.60i) is given by r D 0C;  D =2: The restriction of the
metric (5.60i) for the submanifold r D 0C;  D =2; t  x4 D const. yields the
one-dimensional metric:
.dl/2 D a2  .d'/2 :
(5.74)
The above metric is that of a “ring” of radius “a” in the equatorial plane of the
three-dimensional coordinate space R3:
In the three-dimensional submanifold x4 D t D const.; we can visualize various
horizons as surfaces of revolution and the singularity. Proﬁle curves for four surfaces
of revolution are already shown in Fig. 5.14. The equations governing the outer event
horizon, inner horizon, outer ergosurface (or stationary limit surface), and inner
ergosurface are furnished, respectively, by the following:

Particles entering into the ergosphere from the external domain in (5.60iv) can

The two-dimensional metric in (5.77) is ﬂat. The r-coordinate curves can be
analytically extended through domains D˙

The preceding treatments of the Kerr black hole are mathematically unsatis-
factory due to the use of the Boyer–Lindquist coordinate chart beyond its valid
domain D4 in (5.60iv). In the case of the spherically symmetric black hole of
the preceding section, the original Schwarzschild chart had to be extended to the
Kruskal–Szekeres chart of (5.33i) and (5.35). Similarly, we need to extend the
Boyer–Lindquist chart in a suitable manner into the Kerr black hole. For that
purpose, we extend (5.13) into6

The metric above is the generalization of the Kruskal–Szekeres chart in (5.19) [198].
Moreover, the function r D Y.u; v/ in (5.91) admits natural, analytic extensions
beyond the original domain characterized by u < 0 and v > 0: Thus, in case
the function Y of (5.91) is extended to eY in the metric of (5.93), we obtain
the generalization of the Kruskal–Szekeres chart in (5.33ii) for the Kerr metric.
However, the Kerr metric can be analytically extended also for negative values of
r D eY.u; v/: (See the discussions after (5.77).)
To depict the maximal analytic extension of the Kerr metric in (5.93), let us
restrict our analysis to the two-dimensional submanifold characterized by  D
const. and ' D const. In the degenerate case of  D 0C (and ' D const.), the
induced metric from (5.93) drastically reduces to

It is more convenient to extend the simpler metric above [35]. To continue the
analysis, we shall now have to digress to a relevant topic. We shall discuss brieﬂy
the Penrose-Carter compactiﬁcation of a space–time manifold. Let us consider a
toy model, namely, the real-analytic function “Arctan.” It can be summarized as
Arctan W R ! R;
Domain (Arctan) D R;
Codomain (Arctan) D .=2; =2/  R:
(5.95)
The codomain(Arctan) is an open subset and, thus, noncompact [32]. We want to
extend both the domain and the function “Arctan” to obtain a compact domain. For
that purpose, we deﬁne the set of extended real numbers as
R WD R [ f1; 1g :
(5.96)
The extended function “Arctan” is deﬁned by
Arctan W R ! R;
Domain (Arctan) D R;
Codomain (Arctan) D Œ=2; =2  R:
(5.97)
Thus, the codomain is a closed subset and compact.

Fig. 5.18 The submanifold M 

Remarks:
(i) The geometry along the curve r D 0 (in Fig. 5.17) is smooth.
(ii) However, the geometry along r D 0 for the case of  D =2 is singular.
(iii) In subsets of DIII [ DIII0; corresponding to r < 0; closed timelike curves exist!
(See [197] and Appendix 6.)
Consider now the two-dimensional Kerr submanifold M2 with  D 0C and ' D
const. In case it is also compactiﬁed by (5.97), we denote it by the symbol M 
2 : Two
distinct coordinate charts, with some overlap, are provided by (5.99) and (5.101).
Using Figs. 1.2, 5.16, and 5.17, we exhibit the submanifold M 
2 and two coordinate
charts in Fig. 5.18.
Remarks:
(i) Note that in the shaded domain DII of M 
2
in Fig. 5.18, two
coordinate charts overlap.
(ii) In Fig. 5.18, the intrinsic curvature of the submanifold M 
2 is not evident.
(Consult Figs. 1.4 and 2.8.)
(iii) In Fig. 5.18, we note that some of boundary points (along dashed line
segments) are missing.
(iv) We can take two exact replicas of M 
2 and (topologically) glue them on the top
and bottom of M 
2 in Fig. 5.18 to complete boundary points and further extend
the manifold.
(v) However, to obtain the maximally extended Kerr submanifold (and the cor-
responding Kerr manifold), we must add a denumerably inﬁnite number of
exact replicas of M 
2 and glue them together on the top and bottom of M 
2 in
Fig. 5.18.

Before concluding this section, we would like to make some comments on the
black holes discussed in Sects. 5.1 and 5.2. The extended Schwarzschild black hole
in the preceding section, and the extended Kerr black hole, enjoys privileged status.
Among all externally static, asymptotically ﬂat vacuum solutions yielding black
holes, the only possibility is the case of the (extended) Schwarzschild black hole
involving one parameter m > 0: (See [35, 141].) Similarly, among all stationary
asymptotically ﬂat vacuum solutions yielding black holes, the only possibility is the
extended Kerr black hole with two parameters 0 < jaj < m: (See [35].) Similar
uniqueness theorems hold for stationary, asymptotically ﬂat electromagneto-vac
black holes. The only solution admitted must be an extended Kerr–Newman black
hole (of Problem #8 of Exercises 5.2) with three parameters m; “a,” and e [35,220].
An external observer can determine these three parameters by observing trajectories
of uncharged and charged test particles outside a Kerr–Newman black hole. All
other physical informations of the charged, material body before the collapse are
lost after the collapse of the body inside the event horizon! This fact is popularly
known as the no hair theorem. (See [141,220].)

Exotic Black Holes
This section lies outside the main focus of this chapter and may be considered
optional for an introductory curriculum. Several of the models presented in this
section may apparently not seem particularly physical. However, one example
we present below may represent one class of elastic body, an anisotropic ﬂuid,
or a perfect ﬂuid with charge. This section also serves to illustrate how many
of the techniques studied earlier are employed when considering the T -domain
of a black hole space–time and such models are therefore pedagogically useful.
Another important issue illustrated here is that physical measurements are local.
For example, it is shown below that demanding a well-behaved space–time structure
in the exterior of the event horizon does not preclude exotic material with bizarre
properties as the source of the gravitational ﬁeld is inside the event horizon.
From the preceding sections, it is evident that cases of massive objects imploding
into black holes may be physically plausible, according to the theory of general
relativity. (Compare Figs. 5.10–5.13.) However, there are examples of eternal
black holes and eternal white holes [106], where only “singularities” reside inside
horizons for all time. Thus, these “material contents” are always completely hidden

404

Black Holes
from the view of external observers. The prime example of an eternal black hole
(together with an eternal white hole) is provided by the maximally extended
Schwarzschild metric. (See Figs. 5.5 and 5.6.) Furthermore, there exist maximally
extended Kerr metrics for which horizons hide denumerably inﬁnite number of
connected universes (containing black holes) from any observer in the external
space–time vacuum. (See Fig. 5.19.)
We have other examples of eternal black holes, where the “material” inside the
event horizon may be exotic (violating energy conditions in some way). To explore
such black holes, let us go back to T -domain solutions in (3.107) and (3.108i–v).

It is evident that there exist dualities between the set of solutions in (5.106i–iv) and
the “R-domain” solutions of the Theorem 3.3.1. However, the present T -domain
solutions in (5.106i–iv) yield completely new, exotic physics.
We shall discuss a special case of such a black hole inherent in # 4 of

It is evident that the metric tensor components from (5.109i) and (5.111i) are
continuous across the boundary T D b: This boundary is now spacelike and denotes
an instant in time. Although a spacelike matter-vacuum boundary such as this may
not be particularly physical, this boundary is inside the event horizon. It may also
be noted that these techniques (the implementation of these boundary conditions)
could be used to join two different matter ﬁelds at a spacelike boundary. This could
be useful, for example, if the material undergoes an abrupt phase transition at some
instant in time.
Synge’s junction conditions (2.170) on the boundary hypersurface T

Thus, Synge’s junction conditions are satisﬁed on the hypersurface of jump
discontinuities by (5.110v).
Now, let us examine I–S–L–D junction conditions (2.171) on the boundary
T D b: The nonzero components of the extrinsic curvature tensor from the interior
metric (5.109i) are furnished by (1.249) as

Comparing (5.113i,ii) with (5.114i,ii), noting that 2m D qb3; we conclude that the
I–S–L–D junction conditions are satisﬁed on T D b:
Now, we shall transform the T -domain vacuum metric of (5.111i,ii) into the
black hole metric in the Kruskal–Szekeres charts of (5.19) and (5.26). It is easier
to work out the details in the case of the two-dimensional submanifold for  D

We can analytically continue the Kruskal–Szekeres chart into the usual domain
DI characterized by u < 0 and v > 0: (See Fig. 5.5.)
We summarize the spherically symmetric, eternal, exotic black hole of (5.115i,ii)
and (5.116i,ii) with this analytic extension in Fig. 5.20.
(In the preceding example, we have not explored the maximal analytical exten-
sion of the manifold or the chart.)
Now we shall investigate another case of spherically symmetric, exotic black
hole, namely, a ﬂuid or an elastic body collapsing to form a black hole [67]. We
assume that the energy–momentum–stress tensor is due to an anisotropic ﬂuid (or
an elastic body with symmetries). This class of ﬂuid has been discussed in (2.181)

Let us try to understand this complicated collapse into an exotic black hole in
physical terms. In this solution of Einstein’s equations, a spherically symmetric
anisotropic ﬂuid (or elastic) body, satisfying energy and jump conditions, is
imploding under its own gravitational attraction. As soon as the external boundary
hypersurface contracts into the Schwarzschild radius r
D 2m; a singularity
appears. The singular hypersurface starts to collapse faster than the outer boundary
surface (inside the black hole). However, both of the hypersurfaces collapse with
superluminous speed! Moreover, the interior to the singular hypersurface still
holds regular, anisotropic ﬂuid. Thus, the singular hypersurface keeps on absorbing
regular ﬂuid from the inside and the tachyonic ﬂuid from the outer shell. Eventually,
the whole of the exotic material inside the event horizon contracts into the ultimate
singularity at bT D 0: (See Fig. 5.21.)

Black Holes
In the realm of exotic black holes, we brieﬂy mention the fact that, with the
addition of a negative cosmological constant, black hole solutions to the ﬁeld
equations also exist with cylindrical, planar, toroidal, and higher genus topology
[164,235,252].
The black holes considered so far all possess curvature singularities. One might
be tempted to believe that all T -domain solutions must be singular. However,
this is not necessarily the case. One example of a nonsingular T -domain is
that present in the Reissner–Nordstr¨om–Jeffery solution (see Problem 4 in the
exercises of Sect. 5.1) where, although there is a singularity, the singularity is
not in the T -domain. There also exist examples of exotic, spherically symmetric
T -domain solutions without curvature singularities. We cite the following as a
simple example [73]:

as well as those related by symmetry.
The above components are all deﬁned inside the T -domain of the manifold (for
 > 0) and therefore provide an example of a regular T -domain solution with a
horizon (not necessarily a black hole, however). It can be shown that the matter ﬁeld
supporting the solution obeys an extreme (stiff) anisotropic polytropic equation of
state 9 between 
.T / and the pressures. In the limit that  ! 0, one retrieves the de
Sitter space–time of constant curvature.
9A polytropic equation of state is of the form p / 
0, with 0 constant.

In regard to singularities, we have only considered curvature singularities.
However, in general relativity, subtler criteria for the existence of singularities,
involving incompleteness of timelike, null, or spacelike geodesics exist. There are
many singularity theorems in the literature (see [126]). We shall conclude this
section and this chapter by stating and proving one of many singularity theorems
involving the collapse of material bodies satisfying energy conditions.
Theorem 5.3.1. Let ﬁeld equations Gij .x/ C  Tij.x/ D 0 be satisﬁed in a domain
D  R4 such that the energy–momentum–tensor is diagonalizable. Moreover,
let strong energy conditions prevail. Furthermore, let the vorticity tensor !ij .x/ 
dxi ^ dxj  O::.x/: Suppose that a timelike geodesic congruence has a negative
expansion scalar .x/ < 0 in a neighborhood of D  R4: Then, each of the
timelike geodesic x D X.s/ will terminate at a singularity x D X .s/ 2 @D after
a ﬁnite proper time.
Proof. We consider the Raychaudhuri–Landau equation (2.202ii). In case of a
timelike geodesic and vanishing vorticity, (2.202ii) reduces to

Cosmology
6.1
Big Bang Models
General relativity has impacted the physical sciences in the most profound way with
its cosmological models. Einstein himself proposed the ﬁrst cosmological model
[88]. The main motivations behind his static model were the following aspects of
cosmology:
1. Isotropy of the spatial submanifold is dictated from large-scale observations.
(This assumption is part of what is known as the cosmological principle.)
2. A ﬁnite average mass density is a reasonable expectation.
3. Moreover, a ﬁnite spatial volume is aesthetically appealing and a real possibility.
With these considerations, Einstein put forward the following “hypercylindrical,”
static metric [88]:

The three-dimensional spatial hypersurface for t D const. is a space of (positive)
constant curvature as governed by (1.164i,ii). The ﬁnite total volume of the spatial
hypersurface is given by

(6.4)
The above equation seemed to be physically unacceptable at the time, due to the fact
that neither negative energy densities nor large negative pressures are observed in
ordinary matter. Therefore, rather than relaxing the assumption of staticity, Einstein
modiﬁed his equations to the following:
E0
ij./ WD Gij ./   gij ./ C  Tij./ D 0:
(6.5)
Here,  is called the cosmological constant.1 (Note that this modiﬁcation is
permissible by Theorem 2.2.8.) One possibility is choosing the cosmological
constant  D .R0/2. Then, the ﬁeld equations (6.5) with metric (6.1i) yield
T˛ˇ./  0;
T˛4./  0;
T44./ D 2 .R0/2 > 0:
(6.6)
The above energy–momentum–stress tensor is due to an acceptable incoherent
dust. This reasonable energy–momentum–stress tensor, supplemented with the
cosmological constant, would still yield a static universe as desired by Einstein at
the time. (However, it was later discovered that this state of static equilibrium is
unstable to small perturbations [83].)
1Later, with the discovery that the universe was expanding (and therefore not static), Einstein
retracted the cosmological constant from the ﬁeld equation (6.5). He also supposedly stated that
introducing it was the biggest blunder of his life. Interestingly, today, the cosmological constant
is again in vogue as a possible mechanism to drive the observed accelerating expansion of the
universe [13,34,209].

6.1
Big Bang Models
421
In 1927 and 1929, observations revealed that the universe is not static [136,161].
In the meanwhile, Friedmann had already discovered in 1922 [105], from Einstein’s
usual ﬁeld equations, a nonstatic metric which yields a ﬁnite (positive) mass density
of the universe without the use of a cosmological constant : He introduced the

Remarks:
(i) In the metric (6.7i), t is a geodesic normal coordinate (of (1.160)).
Therefore, t-coordinate curves represent timelike geodesics.
(ii) The metric (6.7i) is a special case of the Tolman–Bondi–Lemaˆıtre metric of
(3.88).
(iii) The function a.t/ governs the proper distance between points on a spatial
(t D const.) hypersurface. Therefore, this function is sometimes known as
the scale factor. When working with these types of metrics, one is often
interested in solving for this function, as it dictates the time evolution of the
universe.
(iv) The constant k0 governs the spatial curvature of the spatial hypersurfaces. By
a simple rescaling of the r coordinate, it can always be taken to have one of
the values C1 (positive curvature), 1 (negative curvature), or 0 (ﬂat). Note
that in the k0 D 0 case, although the spatial sections are ﬂat, the space–
time is not ﬂat, as can be seen by calculating the Riemann curvature tensor
components.

After their studies of the above models, Friedmann and Lemaˆıtre studied ﬁeld

as (6.7i) for the ﬁeld equations. Next, Robertson [219] and Walker [259] investigated

cosmological models from the point of view of isotropy and homogeneity. Let
us try to explain the concepts of isotropy and homogeneity, both intuitively and
mathematically. In case we look at a star-studded, dark night sky, all directions seem
to look alike. This observation is the basis for isotropy. Again, if we make similar
observations from different locations of the entire globe, the same notion of isotropy
persists. In other words, in the spatial fabric of the cosmos, no single point appears
to be privileged. That is the intuitive notion of homogeneity.
In an N -dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the mathe-
matical condition of a point x0 2 D  RN to be of isotropic sectional curvature
[56,90,244] is that

Now, we shall state and prove a theorem due to Schur [56,90,244] on this topic.
Theorem 6.1.2. Let MN be a Riemannian or a pseudo-Riemannian manifold with
N > 2: Moreover, let the metric ﬁeld g::.x/ in a chart be of class C 3: Furthermore,
let every point x 2 D  RN be endowed with the isotropic sectional curvature
.x/: Then, .x/ must be constant-valued.
Proof. From (6.32), it is deduced that

criterion of homogeneity.3

Thus, by the assumption of spatial isotropy everywhere, we conclude that
the three-dimensional hypersurface of the cosmological universe admits a six-
parameter group of isometries (or group of motions) by a theorem discussed
in [90, 171]. The three-dimensional spatial metric g#::.x/ of constant curvature is
characterized by (6.33) as

Now, we shall compute the Einstein tensor from the metric in (6.36i,ii). We shall
state and prove the following theorem on this topic.
Theorem 6.1.3. Let the metric g::.x/ in (6.36i) be a Lorentz metric of class C 3 in

Metrics in (6.7i), as well as in (6.41) are called Friedmann–Lemaˆıtre–Robertson–

of galactic clusters is negligibly small compared to the energy density. Otherwise,
one equation of state can be imposed to render the system (6.47i–iii) determinate.
Note that in every F–L–R–W universe, all the events have some material present.
An interesting linear combination of (6.47i–iii) can be expressed as

Equation (6.49ii) is called the Raychaudhuri equation (as it is a consequence of
(2.202ii)). Assuming the strong energy condition .t/ C 3p.t/ > 0; (6.49ii) reveals
that the acceleration is negative and the “gravitational force” is attractive.
Let us consider now what is commonly known as the radiation era [27,201,202]
which has preceded the present matter-dominated era. It is characterized by the
equation of state
p.t/ D .1=3/  .t/:

there may have existed an extremely short inﬂationary era [27,206]. One of various
speculations about this era, and which is also mathematically the simplest, is to

Theorem 5.3.1.
Theorem 6.1.6. Let ﬁeld equations Gij .x/ C  Tij .x/ D 0 prevail in a domain

Proof of this is exactly analogous to that of Theorem 5.3.1 and will be skipped.
However, we shall provide Fig. 6.3, which is similar to Fig. 5.22 and depicts the

with the Example A2.10 and (5.12) governing a black hole.)
Finally, we note in the F–L–R–W metrics of (6.7i) and (6.41) that the space
and time coordinates are not on equal footings. The ten-parameter Poincar´e group
IO.3; 1I R/ of special relativity (and its minimal extension to the de Sitter or anti-

Scalar Fields in Cosmology
This section may be considered optional for an introductory curriculum.
In the preceding section, we encountered the cosmological constant  that
Einstein introduced and later withdrew from the ﬁeld equations. The cosmological
constant  can be interpreted as a constant-valued scalar ﬁeld. Hoyle and Narlikar
[135] introduced a scalar C-ﬁeld in cosmology for steady-state models. Das and
Agrawal [57] investigated (1) a massless, real scalar ﬁeld and (2) a massive,
real scalar ﬁeld in F–L–R–W universes. Today, various types of scalar ﬁelds are
commonplace in many studies of cosmology.
Now, let us discuss the case of a massless, real scalar ﬁeld, .x/, in general
relativity. The coupled scalar and gravitational ﬁeld equations are the following:
Eij .x/ WD Gij .x/ C  Tij.x/ D 0;

Remark: By Theorems 6.1.2 and 6.2.1, the energy–momentum–stress tensor of a
massive, real scalar ﬁeld is algebraically compatible to F–L–R–W metrics of (6.70i).
Let us investigate ﬁeld equations (6.78i–iii) and the conservation equation
(6.78iv) using F–L–R–W metrics in (6.70i). Equations (6.71i–v) are still valid.
Therefore, for a nonconstant scalar ﬁeld, we must choose

Rainich showed [213] how to eliminate electromagnetic ﬁeld components

involving only the metric tensor and its derivatives. In the much easier setting of
the coupled F–L–R–W and scalar ﬁeld equations (6.82) and (6.85i,ii), we shall
accomplish a similar goal by eliminating the ./ ﬁeld. First, we take linear

Now, we shall introduce the quintessence scalar ﬁeld to explain the phenomenon
of dark energy in the cosmological universe. (For a thorough mathematical analysis,
see [76].) Dark energy is the generic name given to the “material” which is thought
to cause a repulsive acceleration of the expansion of the universe [225]. (An in-
depth study of quintessence related to cosmic acceleration may be found in [174].)

the system determinate.

Now, we shall investigate the matter phase scenario for the coupled ﬁeld

Before proceeding, we shall furnish an example illustrating the utility of the
initial value formalism introduced in Sect. 2.4.
Example 6.2.3. We consider the evolution of a constant quintessence scalar ﬁeld in
an otherwise empty, spatially ﬂat (k0 D 0) FLRW space–time. Recall that the line
element of such a space–time is given by (6.9) as

x 2 D WD D  .t0; t1/  R4:
The scenario will be one of exponential expansion, a.t/ D et. Since the scalar ﬁeld
is constant, the only contribution to the energy–momentum–stress tensor is from the
(constant) potential function V.0/. (Refer to (6.93ii). Note that this is equivalent
to a vacuum solution with a cosmological constant.) For this, we choose a value
V.0/ D 3=. The initial data on the surface t D t0 is as follows:
g#
˛ˇ.x/ D e2t0  ı˛ˇ;  ˛ˇ D 2e2t0  ı˛ˇ; i.x/ D 3
  ı4i; T #
˛ˇ.x/ D 3
 e2t0  ı˛ˇ:
It can be shown that the above initial data satisﬁes the constraints of (2.251) on the
initial hypersurface and that the scalar ﬁeld equation of motion (6.93v) is trivially
satisﬁed. (Compare with Problem #5 of Exercises 2.4)
The Einstein equations can be solved analytically for the scale factor a.t/. (In
fact, it is very simple to do so in this case.) However, here, we wish to utilize the
initial value formalism of Sect. 2.4 and compare it to the analytic solution. This
example is another illustration of how to utilize the initial value scheme, and its
simplicity allows us to test the scheme’s convergence properties to an exact analytic
result. To solve for the scale factor, it is sufﬁcient to just evolve one nonzero
component of g#
˛ˇ.x/, as all nonzero components of g˛ˇ in this case are equal to
the scale factor squared. With the above information, we can form the Taylor series
for g˛ˇ.x/ as in (2.252) (utilizing the previous formalism in that section for the
higher order time derivatives of the metric on the initial surface). The results are
displayed in Fig. 6.4 where the dotted lines indicate the approximation at quadratic,
cubic, and quartic order in .t  t0/ of the Taylor series. The solid line in the ﬁgure
represents the analytic result a2.t/ D e2t. One can see that retaining higher-order
terms in the expansion yields better agreement with the analytic result.
Now, we shall discuss what is often called the tachyonic scalar ﬁeld (or Born-
Infeld scalar ﬁeld), denoted by ˚, gravitationally coupled with a perfect ﬂuid.

In Sects. 6.1 and 6.2, we have dealt many times with the conformally ﬂat F–L–
R–W metrics. A more in-depth analysis of conformally ﬂat space–times is provided
in Appendix 4.
6.3
Five-Dimensional Cosmological Models
This section lies outside the main focus of this chapter and may be considered
optional for an introductory curriculum.
Theoretical and observational difﬁculties with standard F–L–R–W big bang
models can be partially resolved in cosmological models with a period of inﬂation
(either exponential or cos-hyperbolic). Inﬂationary models contain self-interacting
scalar ﬁelds coupled with gravity. Of particular interest in elementary particle
physics are scalars that are known as Higgs ﬁelds [120,178]. Section 6.2 dealt with
models involving various different scalar ﬁelds. Here, we present another popular
extension to standard cosmology, namely, the addition of extra spatial dimensions.
Coincident with the renewal of interest sparked by inﬂationary models, there
has been a revival of Kaluza-Klein theory which was an attempt at unifying
gravity with electromagnetic ﬁelds in a ﬁve-dimensional “space–time.” (For a
review of the topic, consult [6, 12].) Also, modern string theories [117, 274]
employ ten-dimensional or eleven-dimensional differential manifolds. There are
some cosmological implications of these higher dimensional theories. (See, e.g.,
[108, 167], and references therein.) However, we shall restrict ourselves in this
section only to the ﬁve-dimensional manifold for the sake of simplicity and as an
introduction to higher dimensional models.
We consider a ﬁve-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold M5 with signature
C3: In a general coordinate chart, we denote y D

y1; y2; y3; y4; y5
2 e
D  R5:
The capital Roman indices take values from f1; 2; 3; 4; 5g with the usual summation
convention over repeated indices.
We consider the coupled Einstein equations (ﬁve-dimensional now) with a
massless scalar ﬁeld and no ﬂuid in the ﬁve-dimensional arena [111] in what
follows:
eg::.y/ WD egAB.y/  dyA ˝ dyB;

Here, e is the “ﬁve-dimensional” gravitational constant.
The simplest, nontrivial ﬁve-dimensional models (compatible with the previous
equations (6.7i) and (6.70i)) are furnished by the metric:

(6.119ii)
Here, the ﬁfth dimension, characterized by the coordinate x5 (or e!) in this chart, is
assumed to be homeomorphic to a (small) circle S1: Therefore, the ﬁve-dimensional
pseudo-Riemannian manifold M5 is assumed to be locally homeomorphic to K3 
R  S1: (Here, K3 denotes a three-dimensional space of constant curvature.) The
exterior radial function a.t/ > 0 and the interior radial function ˇ.t/ > 0 are scale
factors which specify the “sizes” of the external three-dimensional space K3 and
the internal compactiﬁed space S1 (the ﬁfth dimension), respectively, at the time t.
To be consistent with observations at the present time t0; it must be that Pa.t0/ D
da.t/
dt
jt0 > 0 and ˇ.t0/ must yield a diameter for the ﬁfth dimension that is smaller
than what can be probed with current high-energy accelerator experiments. (The size
of the extra dimension may even be as small as of the order of the Planck length,
the smallest scale at which classical gravity is commonly believed to apply [175].)
The metric in (6.119i,ii) admits locally seven independent Killing vectors

Field equations (6.121iii) and (6.121iv) yield the following solutions as ﬁrst
integrals:
Œa.t/3  Œˇ.t/ D c1 D const.;
(6.122i)
Œa.t/3  Œˇ.t/  Œ.t/ D c2 D const.
(6.122ii)
Here, c1 ¤ 0 and c2 ¤ 0 are otherwise arbitrary constants of integration. Hence,
ˇ.t/ and .t/ are functionally dependent via the equations:
ˇ.t/ D c3  exp Œ.c1=c2/  .t/ ;
(6.123i)
˚.ˇ.t// WD .t/;
(6.123ii)
˚.ˇ/ D .c2=c1/  ln jˇ=c3j:
(6.123iii)
Here, c3 ¤ 0 is another arbitrary constant.
Further simpliﬁcations result when the remaining ﬁeld equations (6.122i) and
(6.122ii) are rewritten with ˇ as the new independent variable instead of t: Using
(6.122i), we convert derivatives as follows:
A.ˇ.t// WD a.t/;
Pa.t/ D c1  ŒA.ˇ/3  A0.ˇ/ ¤ 0:
(6.124)
Here, the prime denotes the derivative with respect to ˇ: Moreover, from (6.122i)
and (6.123i–iii) we deduce that

Let us denote another function (related to the Hubble function) by the following:

Next, we analyze the exact solutions in (6.128i–v) quite exhaustively. For that
purpose, we introduce a couple of new functions to use in the sequel:
.ˇ/ D ˇ  h.ˇ/;
(6.129)
and
z.ˇ/ WD .ˇ/ C 1
2 D ˇ  h.ˇ/ C 1

(6.130)
We have mentioned after (6.119ii) that we choose ˇ > 0. Moreover, from
physical considerations of the Hubble function in (6.126), we restrict h.ˇ/ > 0.
Therefore, (6.129) and (6.130) yield
.ˇ/ D ˇ  h.ˇ/ > 0;
(6.131i)
z.ˇ/ D .ˇ/ C 1

(6.131ii)
Therefore, by choosing a sufﬁciently small positive constant " > 0, we can obtain
the following estimates:

z.ˇ/ D 1

In the general solutions in (6.128i–v), we choose the arbitrary constant ˇ0 D 1
(without jeopardizing the physical contents of the solutions.) Therefore, general
solutions of (6.128i–v), with the new functions in (6.131i,ii), can be cast into the

We note that the graph of .ˇ/ in the ﬁgure is positive-valued. Since .ˇ/ D
ˇ  h.ˇ/ is the product of the expansion parameter of the compact dimension and
the Hubble parameter, such a behavior is expected. Furthermore, the function .ˇ/
in Fig. 6.6 does not reveal any critical point in the interval .0; 1/. We shall see
later that this indicates that the function .ˇ/ implies monotonic expansion of the
universe. However, let us investigate the general solutions in (6.128i) involving one
parameter  (with ˇ0 D 1). These are furnished by

Now, we shall discuss general solutions of coupled ﬁeld equations (6.121i–iv).
In case h0.ˇ/ is eliminated between (6.127i) and (6.127ii) (with k0 D 0), we can

ﬁve-dimensional cosmological model of the universe, the noncompact three-
dimensional submanifold is expanding in size at a greater rate than the compact
one-dimensional submanifold! The ﬁfth dimension may therefore be arbitrarily
“small” compared to the usual three spatial dimensions. The different expansion
rate of higher dimensions is often employed in theories such as Kaluza-Klein
theory and string theory.

To solve a wave equation in a space–time domain, it is convenient to use two
null coordinates (as discussed in Example 2.1.17 and in (A2.26)). Moreover, in
Appendix 2, we have used complex conjugate coordinates to solve elliptic partial
differential equations. Furthermore, for the Petrov classiﬁcation of the conformal
tensor, the use of a tetrad consisting of two null vectors and two complex conjugate
vectors is technically convenient. Therefore, we are motivated to introduce two
complex conjugate null vector ﬁelds by the following:

by (7.2iv) and (7.2vi), must be mediated by linear combinations of elements of the

Example 7.1.2. We shall consider special Lorentz mappings in 0.3; 1I R/ and
consequent implications on the mappings of the complex null tetrads.
Case (i): Rotations restricted to the two-dimensional vector subspace spanned by
Ee.1/.x/ and Ee.2/.x/ in Fig. 7.1 are characterized by

(7.7i)
(Here, .x/ is a real-valued function.)
Case (ii): Proper, orthochronous Lorentz mappings (boosts) in the two-dimensional
vector subspace spanned by Ee.3/.x/ and Ee.4/.x/: The consequent induced mappings
on null vectors El.x/ and Ek.x/ are characterized by

The above transformation can be recognized as a variable boost.

mappings:

Now, we shall introduce the six-dimensional bivector space spanned by the set of

and wedge products were dealt with in (1.45), (1.46), and (1.59), Example 1.2.18,
etc.) For this purpose, we can choose either the 1-form basis set
˚

orthonormal basis set
˚ee.a/.x/

the (real) bivector space:

Remark: Note that there exist inﬁnitely many more basis sets for the bivector ﬁelds!
Let W::.x/ be an arbitrary 2-form belonging to the bivector ﬁelds. It is express-

there exist many other algebraic identities (1.142v,vi,viii) for the components

Weyl’s conformal tensor C:::.x/ of (1.169i,ii) turns out to be very useful in
regards to applications in the ﬁeld of general relativity. (In fact, the next section,

reduce to the following:

Algebraic Classiﬁcation of Field Equations
However, the remaining identities of (7.25iii,vii) and (7.25iv,viii) are not fully
incorporated in identities (7.31i–iv). (All these identities do not imply Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations (2.163i,ii).)
Example 7.1.5. Consider a speciﬁc example of the four-dimensional space–time
where the components of the curvature tensor are given by:
R.a/.b/
.c/.d/.x/ WD K0  ı.a/.b/
.c/.d/:
(7.32)
(Here, K0 is a constant.) By (1.164ii), the above equation indicates a domain of
space–time that is of constant curvature.
The invariant eigenvalue problem of the curvature tensor in (7.32) boils down,
by (7.14x,xi), to

(7.34)
Thus, the 6  6 matrix

is already diagonalized with repeated eigenval-
ues. We can see that the Segre characteristic of this curvature tensor is provided by
Œ.1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1/:
Now, by (1.169ii), Problem # 3 of Exercises 2.4, and Theorem 1.3.30, the
conformal tensor components corresponding to (7.32) reduce to
C.a/.b/.c/.d/.x/  0;
(7.35i)
C.A/

Therefore, every invariant eigenvalue vanishes, and the corresponding Segre char-

The Petrov Classiﬁcation of the Curvature Tensor

Now, the invariant eigenvalue problem for a 2-form W::.x/ is stated below as
Wij ./  Ej ./ D ./  gij ./  Ej ./;
(7.36i)
W.a/.b/./  E.b/./ D ./  d.a/.b/  E.b/./:
(7.36ii)
We conclude from (7.36i,ii) and (7.9i,ii) that eigenvectors must satisfy
./  gij ./  Ei./  Ej ./ D ./  d.a/.b/  E.a/./  E.b/./ D 0:
(7.37)
Therefore, either the invariant eigenvalue .x/ D 0 or the (nonzero) eigenvector
EE.x/ is a null vector, or both. This conclusion immediately shows the importance
of null eigenvectors associated with 2-forms. (Compare (2.300) and (2.301) for
eigenvectors of the electromagnetic 2-form F::.x/:)
Now let us go back to the deﬁnition of the Hodge star operation or Hodge-
dual operation on p-forms in (1.113). Particularly, for the 2-form W::.x/; it is
furnished by

Example 7.1.6. Consider
the
contravariant
orthonormal
components
W .c/.d/.x/  W .d/.c/.x/: The Hodge-dual components from (7.38) emerge
explicitly as
W .1/.2/./ D W.3/.4/./;
W .2/.3/./ D W.1/.4/./;
W .3/.1/./ D W.2/.4/./;

W .2/.4/./ D W.3/.1/./;
W .3/.4/./ D W.1/.2/./:
(7.39)
Furthermore, it follows from (7.38) and (7.39) that the double-dual components are
provided by
W.a/.b/.x/ D W.a/.b/.x/:
(7.40)
(Compare with the Example 1.3.6 and Problem # 5 of Exercises 1.3.)

Now we shall investigate complex-valued 2-forms. We study the special class of
complex-valued 2-forms given by the following:
S.a/.b/.x/ WD W.a/.b/.x/  i  W.a/.b/.x/
  S.b/.a/.x/:
(7.41)
(Here, we assume that W::.x/ is a real 2-form.)

480
7
Algebraic Classiﬁcation of Field Equations
We deﬁne the Hodge duality for a complex 2-form exactly as that in (7.37).
Therefore, we express
S.c/.d/.x/ WD .1=2/  .a/.b/
.c/.d/  S.a/.b/.x/:
(7.42)
It follows from (7.41) and (7.42) that the Hodge dual of components S.a/.b/.x/ must
satisfy, by use of (7.40) and (7.41),
S.a/.b/.x/ D 
W.a/.b/./  i W.a/.b/./

D W.a/.b/./ C i W.a/.b/./
D i  S.a/.b/.x/:
(7.43)
Equation above is called1 the self-duality of the corresponding complex bivector
S.a/.b/.x/:
A real or complex bivector X::.x/ is called null provided
X.a/.b/./  X.a/.b/./ D X.a/.b/./  X.a/.b/./ D 0:
(7.44)
Therefore, a bivector X::.x/ is nonnull provided X.a/.b/./  X.a/.b/./ ¤ 0 or
X.a/.b/  X.a/.b/ ¤ 0.
A complex bivector ﬁeld 1=2  ˙.a/.b/./ ee.a/./ ^ee.b/./ is deﬁned by
˙.a/.b/.x/ WD X.a/.b/./  i X.a/.b/./
(7.45)
and is self-dual on account of (7.43).
Now, suppose that EU.x/ is a future-pointing, timelike vector ﬁeld. It follows that
U.a/./  U .a/./  1;
(7.46i)
U .4/./  1;
(7.46ii)
˙.a/.b/./  U .a/./  U .b/./  0:
(7.46iii)
A pertinent covariant vector ﬁeld eX.x/; deﬁned below, satisﬁes
X.a/.x/ WD ˙.a/.b/./  U .b/./;
(7.47i)
X.a/./  U .a/./  0:
(7.47ii)
Here, it follows from (7.47ii) that either X.a/  X.a/ > 0 or eX.x/ D e0.x/.
1Equation (7.43) differs from those in (7.39) for a real bivector. To call the condition (7.43) as
self-duality is a misnomer. However, due to the popularity of this nomenclature, we will keep on
using the same name in this chapter.

Now we shall provide an example.

Consider the set of all complex bivector ﬁelds which are self-dual in the sense of
equations (7.49i–iii). We shall prove a useful theorem about the set of three bivector
ﬁelds fU::./; V::./; W::./g here.
Theorem 7.1.8. Let the set of three bivector ﬁelds fU::./; V::./; W::./g be deﬁned
in a coordinate domain D  R4:
(i) This set comprises of three linearly independent bivector ﬁelds.
(ii) Every linear combination of . U::./; V::./; W::./ yields a self-dual bivector.

7.1
The Petrov Classiﬁcation of the Curvature Tensor
483
(iii) These three bivectors generate, by all possible linear combinations, a proper
subset of all self-dual bivectors which is isomorphic to a three-dimensional,
complex vector space.
Proof.
(i) Consider linear equations
˛.x/  U.a/.b/./ C ˇ./  V.a/.b/./ C 	./  W.a/.b/./ D 0;
where, ˛.x/; ˇ.x/; 	.x/ are complex scalar ﬁelds. Multiplying the above
equations by U.a/.b/./; V.a/.b/./; W.a/.b/./ and double contracting (with use
of (7.50i–vi)), it follows that ˛.x/ D ˇ.x/ D 	.x/  0: Thus, the 2-forms
corresponding to U.a/.b/./; V.a/.b/./; and W.a/.b/./ are linearly independent.
(ii) Consider a bivector ﬁeld expressed as
Y::.x/ WD 
.x/  U::./ C ./  V::./ C ./  W::./:
Here, 
.x/; .x/; and .x/ are arbitrary complex scalar ﬁelds. By use of
(7.49i–iii), we derive that
Y.a/.b/./ D i  Y.a/.b/./:
Therefore, the bivector ﬁeld Y::.x/ is self-dual.
(iii) Consider the three-dimensional complex vector space C3.x/ of ordered, triple,
complex scalar ﬁelds 
.x/; .x/; .x/. An isomorphism (linear and one-to-
one mapping) can be established by
I.x/ ŒY::.x/ WD .
.x/; .x/; .x// :
Equation above essentially proves part (iii) of the theorem.

Now, we shall apply the preceding theoretical considerations ﬁrst to electromag-
netic ﬁelds and then to general relativity. Recall Maxwell’s equations (1.69), (1.70),
(2.290i,ii), (2.300), (2.309), (2.5), and (2.314). In Problem # 8 of Exercises 2.5, we
introduced the complex-valued electromagnetic ﬁeld as
'kj.x/ WD F kj.x/  i F kj.x/
  'jk.x/:
(7.51)
Remark: Since F kj.x/ is an oriented or pseudotensor of (1.112ii), the antisym-
metric ﬁeld 'kj.x/ is not an (absolute) tensor ﬁeld!

Algebraic Classiﬁcation of Field Equations
Let us summarize Maxwell’s equations here:
F .b/.a/.x/  F .a/.b/.x/;
(7.52i)
r.b/F .a/.b/ D 0;
(7.52ii)
r.a/F.b/.c/ C r.b/F.c/.a/ C r.c/F.a/.b/ D 0;
(7.52iii)
r.b/ F .a/.b/ D 0:
(7.52iv)
Equation (7.52iv) is exactly equivalent to (7.52iii). However, (7.52iv) is oriented
tensor ﬁeld equations, whereas (7.52iii) is (absolute) tensor ﬁeld equations!
Now we shall introduce complex-valued, electromagnetic bivector ﬁeld equa-
tions:
r.b/'.a/.b/ D 0:
(7.53)
Remarks: (i) The set of equations above are exactly equivalent to Maxwell’s
equations (7.52i–iv). However, these equations are not (absolute) tensor ﬁeld
equations.
(ii) Equation (7.53) can represent Maxwell’s equations in a curvilinear coordinate
chart of ﬂat space–time. Also, these equations are valid in a curved space–
time with a background metric. Moreover, (7.53) can be part of the Einstein–
Maxwell (or electromagneto-vac) equations in (2.277i,ii) and (2.290i–vi).
By the deﬁnition in (7.51) and (7.40) and (7.41), we obtain
'.a/.b/.x/ D i '.a/.b/.x/:
(7.54)
Thus, the complex electromagnetic bivector ﬁeld is self-dual.
According to Theorem 7.1.8, the bivector components of (7.51) admit the
following linear combination:
'.a/.b/.x/ D .0/.x/U.a/.b/./ C .1/./W.a/.b/./ C .2/./V.a/.b/./:
(7.55)
Here, .0/.x/; .1/.x/; and .2/.x/ are suitable complex scalar ﬁelds. It can be noted
that the three complex-valued ﬁelds .0/./; .1/./; and .2/./ provide the same
number of degrees of freedom as the six linearly independent, real-valued ﬁelds
F.a/.b/.x/: By (7.50i–vi) and (7.48ii,iv,vi) we can explicitly deduce that

Now we shall investigate “gravitational waves” in general relativity. For that
purpose, the classiﬁcation of Weyl’s conformal tensor is essential. We have already
discussed such topics in (7.25i–viii), (7.26), (7.27), (7.28i,ii), (7.29i–iv), (7.30i–iv),
and (7.31i–iv). However, for a more concise analysis, the complex version of the
conformal tensor is required. For that purpose, let us deﬁne the Hodge dual of the
conformal tensor as follows:
C .a/.b/
.c/.d/./ WD 1
2
.a/.b/
.p/.q/
 C .p/.q/
.c/.d/./
D .1=2/  .a/.b/
.p/.q/  C .p/.q/
.c/.d/./:
(7.68)
We deﬁne2 a complex-valued conformal tensor as
.a/.b/
.c/.d/./ WD C .a/.b/
.c/.d/./  i C .a/.b/
.c/.d/./:
(7.69)
Remark: The gravitational equation (7.69) resembles the electromagnetic version
in (7.51).
It follows from (7.43) and (7.69) that the self-duality conditions
.a/.b/.c/.d/./ D C.a/.b/.c/.d/./ C i C.a/.b/.c/.d/./
D i  .a/.b/.c/.d/./
(7.70)
hold.
Consider a complex-valued “tensor ﬁeld” ::::.x/ that admits the following
algebraic identities:

.b/.a/.c/.d/./  
.a/.b/.d/.c/./  
.a/.b/.c/.d/./;
(7.71i)

.c/.d/.a/.b/./ 

.a/.d/.b/.c/./  0;
(7.71iii)

.d/
.a/.b/.d/./  0:
(7.71iv)
These identities hold for .a/.b/.c/.d/./ in (7.69), due to the identities (7.25v–viii) of
the real-valued conformal tensor components.
2This deﬁnition differs from that in [239].

Algebraic Classiﬁcation of Field Equations
Now, we introduce the following complex-valued, self-dual “tensor ﬁeld”
components:
E.0/
.a/.b/.c/.d/./ WD U.a/.b/./  U.c/.d/./;
(7.72i)
E.1/
.a/.b/.c/.d/./ WD U.a/.b/./  W.c/.d/./ C W.a/.b/./  U.c/.d/./;

E.2/

C W.a/.b/./  W.c/.d/./;
(7.72iii)
E.3/
.a/.b/.c/.d/./ WD V.a/.b/./  W.c/.d/./ C W.a/.b/./  V.c/.d/./;
(7.72iv)
E.4/
.a/.b/.c/.d/./ WD V.a/.b/./  V.c/.d/./:
(7.72v)
It is essential to note that each of above ﬁve complex, self-dual, “tensor components”
satisﬁes identities (7.71i–iv). (See Problem #4 of Exercises 7.1.) Therefore, analo-
gous to Theorem 7.1.8, we can prove that the set ˚E.0/::::./; : : : ; E.4/::::./
jxDx0
constitutes a basis set which is isomorphic to a basis set of the ﬁve-dimensional
complex vector space C5
.x0/: Thus, the “tensor ﬁeld” in (7.69) admits the following
linear combination:

Here, .0/.x/; : : : ; .4/.x/ are ﬁve suitable, complex-valued scalar ﬁelds. These
coefﬁcient functions can be explicitly determined by use of (7.72i–v), (7.48ii,iv,vi),
(7.50i–vi), and (7.73). Thus, these ﬁve functions are furnished by:

valued components of the conformal tensor C::::.x/ (i.e., ten).
(ii) These ﬁve, complex-valued functions for gravitational ﬁelds are exact ana-
logues of the three, complex-valued components .0/.x/; .1/.x/; and .2/.x/
of the complex electromagnetic ﬁeld '::.x/ in (7.55).
(iii) In (7.74i–v), the factor .1=2/.a/.b/.c/.d/./ can be replaced with C.a/.b/.c/.d/./.
(Consult the hint to #7 of Exercises 7.1.)
Now we shall proceed to classify algebraically the complex-valued conformal
tensor. The relevant invariant eigenvalue problem to be investigated is given by

(Compare (7.75iv) with (7.29iii).)
We choose a comoving frame to render the analysis of (7.75i,ii) more tractable.
Recall the future-pointing, timelike vector ﬁeld EU.x/ discussed in (7.46i,ii). We
deﬁne the complex second-order tensor ﬁeld Q::.x/ and some related identities in
the following3:
 Q.a/.d/.x/ WD .a/.b/.c/.d/./  U .b/./  U .c/./;

In our present case with 3  3 complex matrix

Here, c1 and c2 are two arbitrary real constants of integration. The nonvanishing
.4/./ implies that the null eigenvector Ek.x/ is of multiplicity four. Thus, the metric
under consideration physically describes (non-vacuum) transverse gravitational
waves. (More detailed discussions on the metric will be provided in Example 7.2.5.)

The invariant eigenvalue problem for the complex-valued conformal tensor
components .a/.b/.c/.d/./ is posed in (7.75i,ii). The corresponding eigenbivectors
E.a/.b/./ are explicitly provided in (7.87i–iii), (7.91i–iii), (7.95i,ii), (7.99i,ii), and
(7.103). (We are not considering the Petrov type 0.) These eigenbivectors are
furnished by the wedge products of null vectors of
n
Em; Em; El; Ek
o
. Therefore, each
of the Petrov type is intricately associated with four-dimensional (real or complex)
null vectors. The Jordan canonical forms of the complex 3  3 matrix

Q.˛/.ˇ/./

in (7.86), (7.90), (7.94i), (7.98i), and (7.102i) are adapted to the preferred, real
null vector Ek.x/. This null vector also physically represents the direction of
propagation of the corresponding “gravitational wave” disturbance. Table 7.1, we
depict the Petrov type, together with the corresponding multiplicity of the null
vector Ek.x/.

Newman–Penrose Equations
The Newman–Penrose equations [194] are exactly equivalent to Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations of (2.163ii). However, (1) these are a set of ﬁrst-order partial differential
equations, and (2) instead of a real orthonormal tetrad, the complex null tetrad of
the equations (7.6i) is used. (3) These equations explicitly involve the Petrov clas-
siﬁcation of the conformal tensor. Equations are particularly suited for extracting
exact solutions involving “gravitational waves.” Moreover, the Newman–Penrose
equations have been exploited to discover a plethora of exact solutions in general
relativity. (See [35,118,239].)
We have already investigated a (real) ﬁrst-order version of the ﬁeld equations in
a harmonic coordinate chart for the classiﬁcation of the partial differential equations
representing the ﬁeld equations in Example 2.4.6. Moreover, we have also discussed
a ﬁrst-order system, equivalent to the ﬁeld equations, without employing special
coordinates, in the answer for question # 4 of Exercises 2.4. We shall recapitulate
this formulation subsequently to investigate in greater depth the ﬁrst-order version of

Now, consider the set of transformations of the complex null tetrad such
that integrability conditions (7.145i,ii), ﬁeld equations (7.146i,ii), and Bianchi’s

Computation of the quantities I.a/.b/.c/.d/.x/ and II.a/.b/.c/.d/.x/ in (7.160iii,iv), from
(7.158i–iv) and (7.159i,ii), leads to the nonzero components:

(7.161iii)
Other, linearly dependent, nonzero components of R.a/.b/.c/.d/.x/ can be determined
from (7.161iii) from the algebraic identities (1.142iv–viii).
The complex-valued Riemann tensor components satisfy the following equa-
tions:

(7.162ii)
Therefore, (7.162ii), with reference to (1.164ii), reveal that the universe represented
by the metric (7.156i) is topologically homeomorphic to S2  R2:

Remarks: (i) We have used complex conjugate coordinates ;  in Examples 7.1.10
and 7.2.4. (We have mentioned these coordinates also in (A2.38).) These coordinates
are very effective in solving some partial differential equations. However, the
complex conjugate coordinate  is not independent of the complex variable :
Therefore, there exists a logical gap in using such coordinates.

are not independent. However, these
vectors are used quite effectively as two basis vectors of a null, complex tetrad!
(iii) The metric of (7.156i) represents a special metric in a regular pseudo-
Riemannian manifold. However, it is not explicitly connected with the gravita-
tional ﬁeld equations as such. To render the metric as a solution of Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations, we have to compute the tensor ﬁeld components R.a/.b/./ 
1=2  .a/.b/  R./. Next, we need to deﬁne T.a/.b/./ from (7.149i).
Now, we shall proceed to derive the Newman–Penrose equations. (See [35,194,
239].) For that purpose, we introduce new notations which are used only in this
section of the book. (This notation is often used in the literature when discussing the
Newman–Penrose formalism.)
The directional derivatives are denoted by the following:

7The following equations (7.174i–xviii) coincide with those cited in most of the literature.
Compared to some sources, the sign of certain components (especially R.x/) is different. This
discrepancy occurs due to the usage of different conventions.

Remarks:
(i) The 12 equations (7.174i–iii,vii,viii,ix–xi,xiii,xiv,xvi,xvii) follow
directly from (7.173).
(ii) Each of the 6 equations (7.174iv–vi,xii,xv,xviii) follows from a linear combi-
nation of two equations in (7.173).
(iii) Each
of
the
18
Newman–Penrose
equations
follows
naturally
from
spinor algebra and spinor analysis [122,207].
(iv) The spinor algebra and spinor analysis justify the eighteen complex-valued
partial differential equations (7.174i–xviii) in a mathematically rigorous way.
(Compare remarks (i) and (ii) after (7.162ii).)
Now, we shall work out an example involving the Newman–Penrose equations.

(7.180)
By (7.109ii) and (7.170i–xi), the only nonzero component for this metric is
˚.2/.2/./. Moreover, the Newman–Penrose equation (7.174xiv) implies that

or
˚.2/.2/./ D @1@2h D @@Nh:
(7.181)
In this example, (with R./  0 from (7.109iii)), the complex scalar functions
.0/./ D .1/./ D .2/./ D .3/./  0. In case

the metrics (7.175i,ii) belong to the complex Segre characteristic Œ.2; 1/ by (7.101)
and (7.110i). Thus, the Brinkman–Robinson–Trautman metric is of Petrov type N
(for @2@2h ¤ 0).

We have provided (7.147), which are consequences of the complex-valued
Bianchi’s differential identities. We shall now express consequences of Bianchi’s
identities in terms of directional derivatives (7.163i–iv) and spin coefﬁcients

(Compare equation above with (1.169ii) and (7.150).)
However, the above equation (7.183) is really an algebraic identity involving

The equations above are obviously equivalent to Bianchi’s differential identities in

Equations
8.1
The General E–M–K–G Field Equations
The contents of this chapter generally lie outside the focus of an introductory
curriculum, and therefore, this chapter may be considered optional for an introduc-
tory course.
Various attempts have been made in the past to arrive at a completely ﬁeld-
theoretic description of microscopic material objects. For example, Wheeler and his
collaborators [183, 263] offered a completely geometrical description of classical
matter. Heisenberg and his associates [128] presented a nonlinear Dirac equation
for uniﬁcation of various matter ﬁelds. Finkelstein [99] has presented extended
models of particles with internal rotational motions. Lanczos [158] has constructed
nonsingular ﬁeld-theoretical models from a quadratic action principle. Jackiw et al.
[143] have shown that certain exact solutions of nonlinear ﬁeld equations provide
approximations of vacuum expectation values of quantized ﬁelds. In recent years,
string theory has gained a lot of advances toward the ultimate uniﬁcation of ﬁelds.
(See [117, 274].) Das [50] introduced the massive, complex scalar ﬁeld in general
relativity to replace phenomenological descriptions of matter in the right-hand
sides of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. Although the coupled Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–
Gordon equations (E–M–K–G equations) do not qualify as a uniﬁed ﬁeld theory of
matter, the exact solutions of the system do provide some insights on the possible
nonsingular models of the complex scalar wave ﬁelds under gravitational and
electromagnetic self-interactions. Moreover, relativistic wave ﬁelds are utilized ex-
tensively in the gravitational research literature. Therefore, a complete introduction
to this ﬁeld is appropriate.
The Maxwell and Klein–Gordon ﬁelds here are treated in their “ﬁrst-quantized
forms” and therefore are treated as “classical ﬁelds.” Second-quantized ﬁelds, where
the ﬁelds themselves (and their canonical momenta) are subject to the Lie algebra of
quantum mechanics, and in the standard representations become operators, are not
considered here. The coupling of second-quantized ﬁelds to gravity gives rise to the

The Coupled Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon Equations
interesting subject of quantum ﬁeld theory in curved space–times or semiclassical
gravity, which is beyond the scope of this text. There are several well-written texts
on this subject [22,115,186,258].
We shall now investigate the coupled E–M–K–G ﬁeld equations in what follows.
We choose the physical units such that c D G D „ D 1: (Here, 2„ is Planck’s
constant.)1 This system of units is sometimes referred to as natural units, Planck
units, or fundamental units. We denote the mass and charge parameters, associated
with the complex scalar ﬁeld, by m and e, respectively. Now, we introduce a few
notations in the following:

(These are known as gauge covariant derivatives.) Here, .x/ is the complex scalar
ﬁeld and Aj.x/ are components of the electromagnetic 4-potential. Moreover, we

The last equation (8.2vi) indicates one possible subsidiary condition for the
electromagnetic 4-potential Ai.x/: This reﬂects the gauge freedom discussed in
(1.71i,ii). Among the coupled equations (8.2i–vi), assuming usual differentiability
conditions, the following ﬁve differential identities exist:

Furthermore, (8.14iv) implies that the static electric ﬁeld under consideration is not
trivial. (See [60].)
Now let us work out some of the ﬁeld equations (8.2i–iv) with the assumptions
made in (8.14i–v).

Theorem 8.2.1. Let the function

Static Space–Time Domains and the E–M–K–G Equations

Before continuing, we present here an interesting digression. Motivated by the
above theorem, we deﬁne the homogeneous state of the complex wave function .x/
by the following:
.x/ D 0  eiEx4;
.x/ D 0  eiEx4;
eiEx4  .x/ D eiEx4  .x/ D 0 D real constant:
(8.31)
Thus, attaining an interior maximum or an interior minimum, the real wave
function .x/ of (8.31) must belong to a homogeneous state by Theorem 8.2.1.
Moreover, the corresponding static metric in (8.27i) is of the conformastat class
of (4.55). Furthermore, the system of eight, complicated partial differential equa-
tions (8.22), (8.23), and (8.24i) reduce to one second order, semilinear partial
differential equation (8.30)!
Now let us make a slight digression on the consequences of a more general
homogeneous wave function provided by
.x/ D 0  eiEx4;
.x/ D 0  eiEx4;
0 D a complex constant;
(8.32)
with a general electromagnetic ﬁeld.
We shall investigate the implications of (8.32) on the system of general E–M–K–
G ﬁeld equations (8.2i–iv). The Klein–Gordon equation (8.2i) goes over into
e2  A˛  A˛ C m2 C g44  .E  e A4/2 D 0;

Two equations (8.33i) and (8.33ii) emerge from the real and the imaginary parts
of the Klein–Gordon equation. The condition (8.33i) can be aptly called the
generalized W–M–P–D condition. The second equation is a linear combination of
the Lorentz gauge and harmonic gauge conditions.
Now, the Maxwell equation (8.2iii), with assumptions in (8.32), yields

for a massive vector boson ﬁeld. The mass parameter for the vector boson ﬁeld

can induce short-ranged self-interactions for the complex wave ﬁeld .x/: This
interaction, implicit in (8.34), is a generalization of the London equation and the
Meissner effect in superconductivity [169,179].

Remarks:

Klein–Gordon equations. For a homogeneous wave ﬁeld ./ D 0  eiEx4;
the special relativistic versions of (8.33i), (8.33ii), and (8.34) are derived in
that paper.
(ii) Compare and contrast the vector boson equation (8.34) with the short-
ranged gravitation (which is gravitation with vanishing Weyl tensor) in
Appendix 4.
(iii) The thesis by Gegenberg [109] also deals with vector boson ﬁeld equations
associated with a homogeneous complex wave function .x/ D 0  eiEx4:
Now we shall go back to static ﬁeld equations (8.29i–iii) and explore some
effective solution strategies. Without loss of generality, we consider the static metric:

following theorem.

Corollary 8.2.3. Let the complex wave function .x/ be in a homogeneous state,

In the limit r ! 1; the metric above asymptotically approaches a spherical polar
chart for the (ﬂat) Euclidean geometry. Therefore, in the limit r ! 1; the four-
dimensional metric in (8.58ii) asymptotically approaches a conformastat electro-
vac, or, charged-dust metric of the W–M–P–D class. (See (4.71) and (4.97).) Thus,
the modiﬁcation of the conformastat metric in (8.58ii) must be due to the presence of
the localizable complex wave ﬁeld. Using the coordinate transformation in (8.57i–

The coordinate chart discussed in (8.57i–iv) makes it simpler to analyze the
physical properties of the solutions. However, the corresponding ordinary differ-
ential equation (8.58iv) is mathematically more complicated and difﬁcult to explore
rigorously. Therefore, for mathematical analysis, we revert back to the coordinate
chart in (8.53) and (8.54i). To investigate the second order, ordinary differential
equation (8.53), we need another initial condition besides the one in (8.61). We
assume U 2 C 2 .Œ0; 1/  RI R/ ; so that lim
x!0C U 00.x/ exists. Therefore, by the
differential equation (8.53), and L’Hospital’s rule, we must have

Corollary 8.3.2. Let the constant be chosen as a  0: Then, for 0  x < 1; the
unique solution y.xI a/ of the initial-value problem (8.65ii) and (8.66) must satisfy
the weak inequality:

(8.67)
Proof of the corollary above was also given in [60].
Now, we are in a position to pose a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for a theoretical
ﬁne-structure constant. (See [60].) We call this quantity a theoretical ﬁne-structure
constant or a ﬁne-structure parameter due to the exact similarity of the constant
of the same name in electrodynamics. Here, we are including electrostatic and
gravitational self-interactions. We shall explore the possible, theoretical values that
this analogous parameter must possess in static, spherically symmetric, localized
systems.
Before proceding, we have to add a third condition for U.x/; in addition to the
two initial values in (8.63iii) and (8.63iv). We add as the third condition the equation
(8.60ii), yielding lim
L!1 U 0.L/ D 0: Thus, we summarize the nonlinear eigenvalue
problem for a theoretical ﬁne-structure constant as:

(8.68i–v). (For those who have studied electrodynamics, the experimental value of
the electrodynamic ﬁne-structure constant is known to be .e2=4/ D 1=137.)
In terms of the functions y.x/ and p.x/; deﬁned in (8.64i) and (8.65i),

Now, we shall state the existence theorem on the nonlinear eigenvalues e.n/ (for

Theorem 8.3.3. Consider the nonlinear eigenvalue problem of (8.68i–v). For each
nonnegative integer n  0; there exists a constant e D e.n/ and a corresponding
eigenfunction U.x/ D U.n/.x/ which has exactly n zeros in .0; 1/  R and satisﬁes
(8.68i–v).
(For the proof, see [60].) We depict the ﬁrst three eigenfunctions U.0/.x/, U.1/.x/,
and U.2/.x/ in Fig. 8.4.
Now we shall describe very brieﬂy the numerical method to compute the
nonlinear eigenvalue e D e.0/ and the corresponding eigenfunction U.0/.x/: We
consider (8.69i–v) in the interval Œ0; 1/  R: By Theorem 8.3.3, there exists a

interpret qualitatively the spatial geometry associated with the non-linear eigenvalue
e.0/ and the corresponding eigenfunction u.0/.r/: The Fig. 8.5a–d depict various

following: Consider the double cone .x1/2 C .x2/2  .x3/2 D 0 embedded
in Euclidean space E3. (Compare with Figs. 1.13 and 2.2.) This hypersurface
(which is actually a topological variety) has one curvature singularity at the
vertex where the two cones meet. That is why we have included the generalized
differential manifold characterized by Fig. 8.7d.
Now, let us go back to spherically symmetric ﬁeld equations (8.44i–vi), (8.45i,ii),
(8.46), (8.47), (8.48i–iii), (8.49), (8.50i–iv), (8.53), (8.54i–iv), (8.57i–iv), and

8.3

(8.58i–iii). These equations involve only electrogravitational self-interactions and
no external ﬁelds. The corresponding eigenfunctions u.j /.r/ are depicted in Figs.
8.5a–d and 8.7a–d for the scenarios when j D 0 and j D 2. We shall now make
some remarks about the physical properties of these solutions in the following:
Remarks:
(i) The wave-mechanical models of a charged, scalar particle under
consideration here are self-consistent and complete. The ﬁeld equations used in
this chapter emerge from the coupling of (a) Einstein’s gravitational equations,
(b) Maxwell’s electromagnetic ﬁeld equations, and (c) the (relativistic) Klein–
Gordon wave equation.
(ii) In a spherically symmetric space–time domain, rigorous techniques of solving
nonlinear eigenvalue problems are employed. The existence of a denumerably
inﬁnite number of (theoretical) eigenvalues for the charge parameter e, the
“ﬁne-structure parameter” (e2=4), and the (proper) mass parameter m is
established.
(iii) The “equilibrium condition” e D ˙
p
=2  m implies that a spectrum of
particles can exist with masses of the order of the Planck mass (
p
„  c=G 	
2:17  105 gm in c.g.s. units.) Thus, these particles are remarkably similar to
conjectured particles called geons [262]. Interestingly, the spectrum is discrete,
a result that is qualitatively similar to the result found in elementary particle
physics.
(iv) The lowest, theoretical eigenvalue of the positive charge parameter is given by
e.0/ D 9:57. It is worthwhile to compare this value with the experimentally
measured magnitude of the elementary charge (the charge of an electron),
je(e)j D 0:303. The ratio

represent gravitationally bound charged “particles”) out of the denumerably inﬁnite
number. These values are obtained from the graphs of the eigenfunctions U.j /.x/ as

Appendix 1
Variational Derivation of Differential Equations
Let us recall the deﬁnition of a critical point for a function f belonging to the
class C 2 ..a; b/  RI R/. Critical points are furnished by the roots of the equation
f 0.x/ WD df.x/
dx
D 0 in the interval .a; b/. Local (or relative) extrema are usually
given by a critical point x0 such that f 00.x0/ ¤ 0. In case f 0.x0/ D 0 and f 00.x0/ >
0, the function f has a local (or relative) minimum. Similarly, for a critical point
x0 with f 00.x0/ < 0, f has a local (or relative) maximum. In case a critical point
is neither a maximum nor a minimum, it is called a stationary point (or a point of
inﬂection). We will now provide some simple examples. (1) Consider f .x/ WD 1
for x 2 .1; 1/. Every point in the interval .1; 1/ is a critical point. (2) Consider
f .x/ WD x in the open interval .2; 2/. There exist no critical points in the open
interval. However, if we extend the function into the closed interval Œ2; 2, there
exists an extremum at the end points (which are not critical points). (3) The function
f .x/ WD .x/3, for x 2 R, has a stationary point (or a point of inﬂection) at the origin.
(4) The periodic function f .x/ WD sin x; x 2 R, has denumerably inﬁnite number
of local extrema, but no stationary points. (See, e.g., [32].)
Now, we generalize these concepts to a function of N real variables x 
.x1; : : : ; xN /. We assume that f 2 C 2.D  RN I R/. A local minimum x0 is
deﬁned by the property f .x/  f .x0/ for all x in the neighborhood Nı.x0/.
Similarly, a local maximum is deﬁned by the property f .x/  f .x0/ for all x
in the neighborhood. Consider f as a 0-form (see Sect. 1.2). The critical points are
provided by the roots of the 1-form equation:

Therefore, the critical curve X.0/, which is a part of a geodesic in the Euclidean
space, constitutes a strong minimum compared to other neighboring smooth
curves.

Remarks. (i) Local, strong minima provide stable equilibrium conﬁgurations.
(ii) Timelike geodesics in a pseudo-Riemannian space–time manifold constitute
strong, local maxima !
Now we shall consider .r C s/th order, differentiable tensor ﬁelds in an N -
dimensional manifold MN , as discussed in (1.30). (More sophisticated treatments of
tensor ﬁelds employ the concepts of tensor bundles [38,56].) For the sake of brevity,
we denote an .r Cs/th order tensor ﬁeld by the symbol .rCs/.x/ (in this appendix).
Various mappings, which are necessary for the variational formalism, are shown in

Thus, the critical functions .0/.x/ satisfy the wave equation in the prescribed
curved space–time.
Consider the wave equation (A1.22) in a domain D4
WD
D3  .0; T /,
0 < T
< T1. Let the prescribed metric functions gij .x/ be real-analytic and
g44.x/ < 0 in the domain D4. Consider the following initial value problem for the
wave equation:
.0/.x; 0/ D p.x/;
@4.0/j.x;0/ D q.x/;
x 2 D3:
Here, the prescribed functions p.x/ and q.x/ are assumed to be real-analytic. This
initial value problem, by the Cauchy-Kowaleski Theorem 2.4.7, admits a unique,
real-analytic solution .0/.x/ for a small positive number T . The “varied function”
.0/.x/C"h.x/, which respects the initial values, must have h.x; 0/ D 0 D @4hj.x;0/.
However, other than being real-analytic, there are no restrictions on h.x/ for 0 <
x4 < T . Thus, the integral in (A1.20ii),

Therefore, in general, initial value problems are not variationally admissible (due
to the fact that on the ﬁnal time hypersurface, the function h.x/ is completely
arbitrary).

Now, we shall investigate the variational derivation of the gravitational ﬁeld
equations. However, this process demands a slightly different mathematical ap-
proach. We explain the methodology by ﬁrst exploring the following toy model.

(A1.29ii)
The variables py yij and k
lij are analogous to the variables y and i
j respectively
of Example A1.4. Equations (A1.29i) and (A1.29ii) are exactly analogous to the
equations in (A1.4).
Equation (A1.29i) is obviously equivalent to the vacuum equations of (2.160i).
Moreover, (A1.29ii) provides implicitly the variationally admissible boundary
conditions for the vacuum equations.
There is an unsatisfactory aspect in the derivation of (A1.29i,ii). In that
process, we have varied the metric tensor and connection coefﬁcients independently.
However, the variational derivation does not reveal the actual relationship between
these two. We can rectify this logical gap by augmenting the Lagrangian in (A1.25)
with Lagrange multipliers 	ij
k to incorporate the required constraints. Deﬁning the

Example A1.5. The invariant Lagrangians (A1.25) and (A1.30) contain second-
order derivatives of the metric tensor components. In general, for Lagrangians
involving second-order derivatives of the metric, we would have obtained fourth-
order ﬁeld equations as the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations. However,
for the Lagrangian density
p
g.x/R.x/, the higher order terms are transformable
into a boundary term in (A1.29ii) and thus do not contribute to the ﬁeld equations.

It can be rigorously proved [171] that such an integral cannot be tensorially
invariant. That is why, in Example A1.5, we had to deal with a noninvariant action
integral.
The second comment is about a Lagrangian scalar density of the type
L

yij I yijkI yijkl

. It can be rigorously proved [170,171], that in a four-dimensional
manifold, the most general Lagrangian density (made up of curvature invariants),
which yields second-order Euler–Lagrange equations, must be of the form

Here, c.1/; c.2/; c.3/; c.4/ are four arbitrary constants with just one constraint Œc.1/2 C
Œc.3/2 C Œc.4/2 > 0. The ﬁrst term is simply proportional to the Einstein-Hilbert
Lagrangian density, giving rise to the equations of motion of general relativity
(2.161i). The second term gives rise to a cosmological constant (proportional to
c.2/) in the equations of motion (see (2.158)). The third term has been shown to yield
trivial equations of motion in four dimensions [157]. Finally, each term in the last
expression in (A1.47) produces fourth-order equations. However, their combination
yields second-order equations and, in four dimensions, its integral is simply a
topological number proportional to the Euler characteristic. This expression is
commonly referred to as the Gauss-Bonnet term.
Outside this appendix, we shall refrain from adding subscripts .0/ to critical

Appendix 2
Partial Differential Equations
In general relativity, a considerable amount of effort is expended in attempting to
solve partial differential equations. Therefore, we are including here an extremely
brief review of the subject. (For extensive study, we suggest [43,77,94].)
Consider the simplest partial differential equation known to mankind:
u D U.x; y/;
.x; y/ 2 D  R2 I
@xu D @U.x; y/
@x
D 0:
(A2.1)
The general solution of equation above is furnished by
u D U.x; y/ D f .y/;
y1 < y < y2:
(A2.2)
Here, f .y/ is an arbitrary differentiable function. Equation (A2.2) comprises of
inﬁnitely many solutions, and it is aptly called the most general solution of the partial
differential equation (p.d.e.) (A2.1).
Remarks.
(i) The function f .y/ in (A2.2) may be misconstrued as a function
of a single variable. Strictly speaking, it is a shortcut notation for a function
F.c; y/ of two variables such that the ﬁrst variable is restricted to a constant c.
(ii) The function f .y/ can be chosen to be discontinuous in the interval .y1; y2/,
and still it will satisfy the p.d.e. (A2.1) exactly!
(iii) In case the domain of validity D  R2 in (A2.1) is nonconvex, the set of
solutions in (A2.2) is not the most general. (See [112] for counter-examples.)

Appendix 2
Partial Differential Equations
Now, let us consider the two-dimensional (one space and one time) wave
equation given by the second order, linear p.d.e.:
w D W.x; t/;
.x; t/ 2 D  R2;
.x; 0/  D for x1 < x < x2 I

(A2.3)
The most general solution of the equation above is furnished by W.x; t/D f .xt/C
g.x C t/. Here, f; g 2 C 2.D  R2I R/, but otherwise arbitrary. Thus, there are
inﬁnitely many solutions of the p.d.e. (A2.3). A class of general solutions containing
inﬁnitely many solutions is provided by W.x; t/ D x  t C g.x C t/; g 2 C 2.D 
R2I R/. A particular solution W.x; t/ D x  t C exp.x C t/ solves uniquely the
initial value problem W.x; 0/ D x C ex;
@W.x;t/
@t
jtD0 D ex  1.
Let us employ a doubly null coordinate system u D x  t; v D x C t. (Compare
with the Example 2.1.17.) The p.d.e. in (A2.3) goes over into
w D b
W .u; v/ WD W.x; y/;
.u; v/ 2 b
D  R2 I
@2 b
W .u; v/
@u@v
D 0:
(A2.4)
The most general solution is provided by
w D b
W .u; v/ D f .u/ C g.v/; where f; g 2 C 2.b
D  R2I R/:
However, we notice that the condition of C 2 differentiability on f .u/ can be com-
pletely relaxed. Discontinuous functions f .u/ can yield exact solutions b
W .u; v/ D
f .u/Cg.v/ for the p.d.e. (A2.4), but not for the p.d.e. @2b
W .u; v/
@v @u
. Physically speaking,
such solutions yield shock waves not revealed in the usual x  t coordinate system.
However, the deﬁnition of a solution can be generalized to a weak solution [43],
which can extract rigorously discontinuous solutions in any coordinate system.
Instead of the p.d.e. (A2.3), a weak solution has to satisfy the integral condition:
Z
D
W.x; t/.@x@xf  @t@tf / dx dt D 0;
(A2.5)
for every C 1-function f with compact support in D. (Such functions are called
distributions [270].)
The second-order p.d.e. (A2.3) is exactly equivalent to the following linear, ﬁrst
order system:
@xw D Px.x; t/;
@tw D Pt.x; t/;
@xPx  @tPt D 0;
@tPx  @xPt D 0:
(A2.6)

The last of the above equations is the integrability condition. (We have already
discussed a system of .N  1/, ﬁrst-order, linear p.d.e.s in (1.236).)
In a general system of p.d.e.s in D  RN , the highest derivatives that occur
determine the order of the system. In a nonlinear system, the highest power (or
exponent) of highest derivatives, is called the degree of the system.
An N -dimensional ﬁrst-order p.d.e. is called a linear equation if it has the form:

 i.x/ @iw C  .x/w D h.x/;

Here,  i.x/,  .x/, and h.x/ are prescribed continuous functions. (For a homoge-
neous p.d.e., h.x/  0.)
An N -dimensional ﬁrst-order equation is called a semilinear p.d.e. provided it is
given by

We classify systems of p.d.e.s in an N -dimensional domain in Fig. A2.1.
We shall now sketch very brieﬂy some of the solution procedures for each of the
type of systems mentioned in the ﬁgure.
Linear systems with constant coefﬁcients are soluble usually by employing
Fourier series, Fourier integrals, or Laplace integrals. Special classes of linear p.d.e.s
admit separable solutions of the type W.x/ D QN
iD1 W.i/.xi/.
Consider a single quasilinear ﬁrst-order p.d.e. (A2.9). Lagrange’s solution
method involves .N C 1/ characteristic ordinary differential equations (o.d.e.s):

The general solution of (A2.13) consists of .N C 1/ arbitrary constants. Alterna-
tively, the solution curve for (A2.13) may be furnished by the intersections of the
following differentiable hypersurfaces:

Remark. Lagrange’s method is valid for a linear or a semilinear p.d.e. also.

Therefore, by (A2.14), the most general solution of the p.d.e. is implicitly pro-
vided by
F

(However, there is an additional singular solution, W.x1; x2/  0.) In case
@F..1/;.2//

Here, g is an arbitrary differentiable function. The solution above furnishes a
general class of inﬁnitely many explicit solutions. (The domain of validity D must
avoid the curve given by g.x1  x2I c/  x1 D 0.)
The quasilinear p.d.e. of this example is a disguised linear equation. By the
transformation of the variable s WD .w/1, the p.d.e. is transformed into the linear
equation:

interesting device for treating elliptic equations by complex conjugate coordinates

Now, we consider second-order, semilinear p.d.e.s in an N -dimensional domain.
Such p.d.e.s need not be tensor ﬁeld equations. (That is why we suspended the
summation convention in preceding discussions!) Let us now revert back to the usual
summation convention for tensorial, as well as nontensorial p.d.e.s. Recall that the
semilinear, second-order p.d.e. (A2.11), reinstating the summation convention, can
be expressed as

Here, the coefﬁcients  ji.x/   ij .x/ are continuous functions such that at least

has N real
(usual) eigenvalues so that at least one of them is nonzero. The eigenvalues can
be always arranged in the order:
	.1/ .x0/ > 0; : : : ; 	.p/ .x0/ > 0 I

is singular. (Without loss of generality, we can always arrange p  n  0. Compare
with the metric equation (1.90).) According to Sylvester’s law of inertia [177,240],
the numbers p; n;  remain invariant under a (real) coordinate transformation of
the type (A2.23iii) in (A2.43). Thus, it is logical to choose the classiﬁcation of the
general semilinear p.d.e. (A2.43) according to the following criteria:
I.

Example A3.8. We shall discuss an example from the general theory of relativity.
Consider the orthonormal components t.a/.b/ WD T.a/.b/.x0/ D t.b/.a/ of the energy–
momentum–stress tensor in (2.45) and (2.161ii) (at a particular event x0 2 D  R4).
The usual eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix

is always diagonalizable. However, the Lorentz invariant eigenvalues of 
t.a/.b/

The Segre characteristic is furnished by Œ4. The corresponding eigenvectors are
quadrupole null vectors along a single null eigendirection.
Since the signature of the Lorentz metric Œd.a/.b/ is C2 and t.b/.a/ D t.a/.b/,
the 14 cases in the equations above in this example contain all possible Segre
characteristics of the energy–momentum–stress tensor (with real Lorentz-invariant
eigenvalues). (See [90, 210].) Furthermore, it can be noted that an eigenvector
associated with a nonsimple, elementary divisor is null.

Now we shall deal with a real N  N matrix ŒM  D ŒM i
j  which possesses only
2s D N complex conjugate roots of the characteristic equation. (Thus, in this case,
there are no real roots.) The following theorem elaborates the canonical form of
such a matrix:

ample, we restricted the classiﬁcation only to the various cases of real, invariant

Every type of Œ.J/ exhibited in the previous example (involving energy–
momentum–stress tensor components T.a/.b/.x0/) violates energy conditions in
(2.190)–(2.192). Therefore, in the usual conditions of the macroscopic universe,
these types of energy–momentum–stress tensor components are usually deemed
unphysical. However, in the quantum realm, it may be possible to violate energy
conditions. An example of this is an effect known as the Casimir effect where
quantum ﬁelds subject to certain boundary conditions may violate energy conditions
(see, e.g., [236, 254] and references therein). Exotic solutions in general relativity
usually possess energy condition violation, as may be seen in Appendix 6 and
Sect. 5.3, as well as [68] where energy condition violation is shown to result inside
a black hole in a certain class of gravitational collapse models.

Let us recall the criterion for conformal ﬂatness of a Riemannian (or a pseudo-

Theorem A4.1. Let D  RN (with N > 3) be a domain corresponding to an

The set of coordinate transformations presented above constitutes a group. It is
called the conformal group C .p; nI R/ (with p C n D N ). This group involves
.1=2/  .N C 1/  .N C 2/ independent parameters. The following theorem provides
the importance of this group in regard to conformally ﬂat manifolds.

pseudo-Riemannian (or a Riemannian) manifold.

In case we would like to apply the preceding theorem to general relativity, we
must choose p D 3; n D 1, and N D 4 for the pseudo-Riemannian space–time
manifold. The theorem, that is suited to general relativity is stated and proved in the
following:
Theorem A4.5. Let the curvature tensor R:::.x/ of the pseudo-Riemannian space–
time manifold of differentiability class C 3 admit a twice differentiable tensor ﬁeld
T::.x/ in the domain D  R4 of consideration. Moreover, let the following tensor

Remarks.
(i) It is clear from (A4.5) and (A4.8) that Tij.x/  0 implies that
Rlijk.x/  0. In other words, mathematically, the support of R::::.x/ 
the support of T::.x/ in conformally ﬂat space–times. Therefore, the class
of gravitational phenomena governed by ﬁeld equation (A4.8) or (A4.9) is
nontrivial only in the presence of material sources. Outside material sources,
this class of gravitational forces just “switches off”! That is why we interpret
gravitational force, arising from ﬁeld equation (A4.9) as the “ﬁfth force”.1 (See
[101, 216].) This effect can equivalently be seen utilizing (1.169i) and ﬁeld
equation (2.163i). The trace of the latter implies that R.x/ D 0 and Rij .x/ D 0
when Tij .x/ D 0 holds. Then, condition (A4.6iv) for conformally ﬂat space–
times for N > 3, when used in (1.169i), implies that Rijkl.x/ D 0 whenever
Tij.x/ D 0.
(ii) Field equation (A4.9), governing the “ﬁfth force”, does not admit general
covariance. However, this equation does admit covariance under the 15-
parameter conformal group C .3; 1I R/.
(iii) The system of ﬁeld equations (A4.9) is highly overdetermined. (See [52].)
In spite of the fact that the system of ﬁeld equations is overdetermined, many
exact solutions of the system do exist. In fact, many of these exact solutions turn out
to be extremely important for understanding of the cosmological universe. We shall
furnish some of these exact solutions in the following examples.
Example A4.6. In this example, the following choice is made:
Tij .x/ WD  .3K0=/  gij .x/;
T .x/ D 12  1  K0:
(A4.15)
(Here, K0 is a constant.)
Substituting (A4.15) into (A4.8), we obtain
Rhijk.x/ D K0 

ghj .x/  gki.x/  ghk.x/  gji.x/

:
(A4.16)
Therefore, by (1.164i), the metric is that of a space–time of constant curvature.
Such a space–time is also called the de Sitter universe (for K0 > 0) and anti-de
Sitter universe (for K0 < 0). (See #1 of Exercise 6.1. Also see [126].)
By Theorem 1.3.30, we can transform this metric locally to the conformally ﬂat
form:
ds2 D

1 C .K0=4/ 

dkl  xkxl2  dij  dxi dxj :

Thus, an explicit expression for .x/ is furnished.

of gravitational effect, and not due to some new force.

Appendix 5
Linearized Theory and Gravitational Waves
In this appendix we brieﬂy review the linearized theory of gravitation and discuss a
class of solutions known as gravitational waves. There are currently several major
experiments in progress which hope to detect gravitational waves in the near future.
If they are successful, a new arena, known as gravitational wave astronomy, will
potentially yield insight into many interesting astrophysical phenomena. The subject
of gravitational waves and the detection of gravitational waves is vast, and we can
only touch upon the subject here. The interested reader is referred to [33,103,172,
230], and references therein.
Although wave solutions also exist in the full nonlinear theory, as mentioned
in Chap. 7, we shall study here the more physically relevant scenario where the
gravitational ﬁeld is weak. In such a case the metric may be written as a perturbation
about the ﬂat space–time metric:
gij .x/ D dij C "hij.x/ C O."2/ ;
(A5.1)
with ", a small parameter such that terms of order "2 or higher may be ignored.1
(We will use equalities below instead of approximate equalities, and it is understood
that this implies “equal to order ".”) The ﬂat space–time metric is known as the
background metric. Of course, one could also perturb a non-ﬂat solution to the
Einstein ﬁeld equations (in fact, many interesting phenomena do indeed consider
non-ﬂat backgrounds); however, (A5.1) will sufﬁce for our purpose.
In the linear approximation, the Einstein equations are computed utilizing metric
(A5.1), and terms to order " are retained. The conjugate metric tensor components
gij .x/ from (A5.1) are furnished by
1(1) Here, hij .x/ will be used to denote the perturbation of the metric. This notation should not
be confused with the one of hij .x/ in Appendix 1, where it represented the variation of the metric
tensor components.
(2) Weak gravitational ﬁelds, up to an arbitrary order O."n/, have been investigated in [64].

(A5.8)
One may simplify this expression even further by an appropriate choice of gauge

From (A5.8) it can be seen that considerable simpliﬁcation would occur if we could
choose a coordinate system such that
@khkj.x/ D 0 :
(A5.9)
The condition in (A5.9) is known as the Lorentz gauge condition (also known as
the harmonic, deDonder, or Fock-deDonder gauge condition). Establishing such a
condition is always possible under an inﬁnitesimal (and differentiable) coordinate
transformation of the form xi ! x0 i D xi C "i.x/. Under such a transformation,
the metric perturbation becomes

Remarks. (i) From physics, (A5.12) is the equation for a spin-two tensor ﬁeld
propagating on ﬂat space–time with a source Tij.x/ [98]. Gravitons (hypotheti-
cal quanta mediating gravitational interactions) should therefore carry a spin of
two in the corresponding quantum theory.
(ii) In the case where Tij.x/ D 0, (A5.12) is simply the wave equation for a second-
rank tensor ﬁeld h
0
ij.x/ with speed equal to unity (the speed of light, or massless
particles). Therefore, in the linearized theory, it can be argued that gravitational
interactions propagate at the speed of light.
If Tij .x/ is known and of compact support, one may ﬁnd a solution to (A5.12)
utilizing the ﬂat space–time retarded Green function for the wave operator:

(A5.13)
where the domain of integration, B, is over the source (see Fig. A5.1).
For the remainder of this appendix, we concentrate on the case where Tij.x/ D 0
(i.e., away from sources). In this scenario, (A5.12) reduces to the wave equation:
@k@kh
0
ij.x/ D 0:
(A5.14)
The Lorentz gauge condition is actually a class of gauges, as i.x/ is not
completely ﬁxed. Within the Lorentz gauge it is possible to add to i.x/ a vector
ﬁeld, i.x/, such that the condition
@k@ki.x/ D 0
(A5.15)
holds, as this will not spoil (A5.11). The Lorentz gauge condition, along with
the conditions (A5.15), allows us to reduce the number of components of hji.x/
(omitting primes from now on) from ten to two. At this stage, all coordinate freedom
has been exhausted, and the system of equations contains two physical (i.e., not

Appendix 5

629
arising from coordinate artifacts which do not affect the curvature) degrees of
freedom.
For physical considerations, it is convenient to choose 4.x/ such that h
k
k D 0
and choose .x/ such that h4.x/ D 0. This choice constitutes what is known
as the traceless-transverse gauge. Note that in this coordinate system there is no
distinction between hij .x/ and hij .x/. We therefore use the notation TThij .x/ to
denote metric perturbations in the traceless-transverse gauge below.
A class of important solutions to (A5.14) is comprised of a superposition of plane
waves. Let us consider a single wave
TThij.x/ D Re
h
Aij  eiklxli
;
(A5.16)
with Aij, the components of a symmetric, constant complex tensor (called the
polarization tensor) and kl, the components of a null vector (called the wave
vector). The traceless condition implies that Ai
i D 0, and the condition T T h4.x/ D
0 implies A4 D 0. Without loss of generality, let us consider the wave in (A5.16)
traveling in the x3 direction. The wave vector then possesses the form Œki D
Œ0; 0; !; ! with ! representing the frequency of the wave. The conditions (A5.9)
and A4 D 0 dictate that Ai3 D 0 and A44 D 0. Assembling all the information
we have gathered on the tensor, we see that the two degrees of freedom mentioned
previously are encoded in the two components A11 D A22 and A12 D A21 (the
ﬁrst equality arising from the traceless condition and the second equality from the
symmetric property of hij .x/).
To determine the physical effects of these gravitational waves, let us consider two
nearby test particles, located at x2 D x3 D 0 in the space–time of a gravitational
wave. Consider a vector connecting these two particles, whose components, at
some initial time, t0, are furnished by Œijt0 D Œ; 0; 0; 0. To the linear order

From the form of TThij.x/ in (A5.16), it is obvious that the geodesic separation
vector components, i.x/, are oscillatory. There exist two polarization states of
gravitational waves. One state affects particle motion, as shown in Fig. A5.2a and
is characterized by TTh11.x/ D TTh22.x/ ¤ 0 and TTh12.x/ D 0 D TTh21.x/.
This state is known as the C-state. The other state is characterized by TTh12.x/ D
TTh21.x/ ¤ 0 and TTh22.x/ D 0 D TTh11.x/ and is known as the -state. This
motion is depicted in Fig. A5.2b. These two states correspond to two independent
polarizations since A11 (or equivalently A22 D A11) and A12 (D A21) are
independent of each other. The two polarizations are orthogonal to each other in
the sense that Aij jCAij j D 0 (the bar here representing complex conjugation).
There are currently a number of gravitational wave detectors in operation
throughout the world, with several others in the advanced planning and design
stages. The largest land-based detector, Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory (LIGO), consists of two interferometers: one in Hanford, Washington,
and one in Livingston, Louisiana, which have characteristic lengths of approxi-
mately 4 km. The LISA detector (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), originally
scheduled for launch in the next decade, would consist of three orbiting satellites,
each separated by approximately 5 million kilometers. These mammoth devices
possess the sensitivity to detect gravitational waves from various astrophysical
sources (see Fig. A5.3) with amplitudes as small as 109 cm. (See, for example,
[182].) The current status of the LISA project is under assessment.
We have treated here only the very simplest type of gravitational wave, as a more
in-depth treatment is beyond the scope of this text. A more thorough review would

emitted via gravitational wave emission for various astrophysical processes such as
black hole collisions and binary neutron star orbits. (In closing this appendix we note
that the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Russell A. Hulse and Joseph
H. Taylor, Jr., for their discovery of a binary pulsar system which is observed to be
losing energy at a rate in agreement with gravitational wave calculations [137].)


Appendix 6
Exotic Solutions: Wormholes, Warp-Drives,
and Time Machines
This appendix deals with several interesting classes of exotic solutions to the
gravitational ﬁeld equations. The purpose of studying such solutions is several-fold:
On the one hand, they are interesting in their own right, as they illustrate just how
rich the arena of solutions to the ﬁeld equations can be. There are no analogs of
these solutions in pregeneral relativistic theories of gravity. It is therefore of great
interest in gravitational ﬁeld research to study just what is possible within general
relativity theory under extreme situations. Secondly, there is pedagogical value in
studying such solutions. As we will show below, these solutions concretely illustrate
the utility of many of the topics and techniques discussed in this text in a very
simple and clear fashion. Finally, the types of solutions mentioned here actually
have application in specialized physical topics within general relativity theory.
Wormholes, for example, provide a simplistic picture of “space–time foam,” a
potential model for the vacuum in theories of quantum gravity, depicted in Fig. A6.1.
(Whether this topology is allowed to ﬂuctuate is not clear at the moment, as some
arguments against topology change are indifferent to whether one is considering
classical or quantum effects [126].) An in-depth review of exotic solutions of the
type discussed here may be found in [168].
A6.1
Wormholes
The ﬁrst exotic solution we will discuss is the wormhole. This type of object has
already been mentioned previously. (See Fig. 2.17c.) Qualitatively, the wormhole
represents a handle (or shortcut) in space–time, which introduces a nontrivial
topology. The most often studied topology is R2  S2. The wormhole handle may
connect two otherwise disconnected universes (an interuniverse wormhole) or else
connect two regions of the same universe (an intrauniverse wormhole). The two
cases are depicted in Fig. A6.2. It should be noted that the near-throat region (the
“narrowest” section of the handle) has an uncanny resemblance to the manifold
depicted in Fig. 3.1 and, in fact, the part of the Schwarzschild manifold depicted in

Fig. 3.1 can actually represent one half of a type of wormhole known as an Einstein-
Rosen bridge. The shading in the throat region here represents the presence of some
matter ﬁeld, which is the source of the gravitational ﬁeld supporting the wormhole.
Let us now quantify the geometry represented in Fig. A6.2 . We shall be limiting
our attention to the case where the wormhole exhibits spherical symmetry and, for
simplicity, we will assume the space–time is static. In such a case, we may take
the line element to be that of (3.1) and utilize the ﬁeld equations and conservation
equations given by (3.44i–vii). Note that here, r1 is equal to the coordinate radius
of the throat. To avoid confusion, below we shall use coordinate indices .r; ; '; t/
instead of .1; 2; 3; 4/ as was used in Chap. 3.

Since we have a speciﬁc geometry in mind, the g or mixed methods of solving the
ﬁeld equations will be most useful here. To mathematically construct the wormhole,
we consider Fig. A6.3 which illustrates a cross-section or proﬁle curve of a two-
dimensional section, t D constant,  D =2, of the wormhole near the throat
(see also Fig. 1.18). The wormhole itself is constructed via the creation of a surface
of revolution when one rotates this proﬁle curve about the x3-axis. The surface of
revolution may be parameterized as follows:

For the case of a wormhole throat, the coordinate chart of (A6.3) is insufﬁcient
to describe the entire wormhole. Instead, two spherical charts are required, one for

636
Appendix 6
Exotic Solutions: Wormholes, Warp-Drives, and Time Machines
the upper half of the wormhole (the “+” domain) and one for the lower half (the “”
domain). (See [74,75,107,185,254] for various charts which cover both the + and
 domains.) Hence, we use the ˙ subscript in the above line element.
The constant m0 in (3.45i) can be set by the requirement that @rP˙.r/ ! ˙1
as r ! r1 or, equivalently, that (3.45i) vanish in the limit r ! r1. This condition
implies that the constant 2m0 D r1.
We are now in a position to analyze the geometry. For now we limit the analysis
to the upper half of the proﬁle curve (the “+” region) in Fig. A6.3 since the bottom
half is easily obtained once we have the upper half (for example, via reﬂection
symmetry through the x1  x2 plane if one wants a wormhole symmetric on either
side of the throat, although this is not required). It should also be noted that r D 0
is not part of the manifold, unlike in the case of stars studied in earlier chapters.
Therefore, divergences as r tends to zero are not an issue here. From the proﬁle
curve in Fig. A6.3, it may be seen that a function P.r/ is required with the following
properties:
1. The derivative, @rP.r/, must be “inﬁnite” at the throat and ﬁnite elsewhere.
2. The derivative, @rPC.r/, must be positive at least near the throat (negative for
the “” domain).
3. The function PC.r/ must possess a negative second derivative at least somewhere
near the throat region (positive for the “” domain).
4. Since there will be a cutoff at some r D r2, where the solution is joined to
vacuum (Schwarzschild or Kottler solution), no speciﬁcation needs to be made
as r tends to inﬁnity.
From now on, we often drop the explicit r dependence in functions for brevity.

in the immediate vicinity of the wormhole throat. This quantity is directly related
to the energy conditions discussed in Chap. 2. From the discussions above, it can
be seen that at the throat, nonnegativity of this combination can (barely) be met
(i.e., .r1/ C pr.r1/  0). However, as one moves away from the throat, note
that the quantity in braces in (A6.7) must go from a value of zero at the throat

638
Appendix 6

(where @rP ! 1) to a positive value away from the throat. Therefore, around the
throat region, the derivative of the expression in braces is positive and thus (A6.7) is
negative in a neighborhood of the throat. That is, a static wormhole throat violates
the weak/null and strong energy conditions! (See, e.g., [146].)
The reader interested in this topic is referred to Visser’s book on the subject of
Lorentzian wormholes [254].
A6.2
Warp-Drive Space–Times
We consider here brieﬂy another interesting class of solutions to the ﬁeld equations
known as warp-drive space-times. The ﬁrst such solution was put forward by Miguel
Alcubierre in 1994 [4], and since then much analysis has been done on these types
of solutions. We will present here the original Alcubierre warp-drive.
The basic idea is simple. One wishes to construct a space–time in which an object
(popularly, a spaceship is chosen) can be propelled between two points, such that
the travel time (as measured by both the proper time of the object and external
observers) is much less than the distance separating the points divided by the speed
of light. Ideally, one also wishes to demand that the interval of proper time of
the traveling observers is the same as the proper time interval for static external
observers (so that the two observers age by the same amount!). Before beginning
the analysis, it should also be noted that no object will be traveling faster than the
local speed of light.
It is useful to employ the ADM formalism here (see Appendix 1) utilizing the
metric (A1.42). An ADM form of the metric is useful, as a space–time domain
constructed from the ADM formalism will not contain any closed causal curves (to
be discussed in the next section) unless one introduces a topological identiﬁcation.
The original warp-drive used the following quantities:
N.x/ D 1 ;
(A6.8i)
N ˛.x/ D sv.x4/f .sr.x// ı˛
1 ;
(A6.8ii)
g˛ˇ.x/ D ı˛ˇ ;
(A6.8iii)
where we are employing a Cartesian-like coordinate system in the three-dimensional
spatial hypersurface. The line element therefore is the following:

of the ship is located at the
center of the top hat,
corresponding to sr D 0
ship is x1 Ds X 1.x4/; x2 D 0; x3 D 0 (note that we are assuming spatial motion
in the x1 direction only) and therefore sr.x/ represents the coordinate distance
from the ship. For the system to function as desired, the function f .sr.x// should
approximate a “top-hat” function. In the original warp-drive solution, the following
function was chosen (the explicit x dependence is henceforth dropped):
f .sr/ WD tanh Œ .sr C R/  tanh Œ .sr  R/
2 tanh .R/
;
(A6.10)
with R > 0 and  	 0 but otherwise arbitrary constants. This function is displayed
in Fig. A6.4 with the x3 coordinate suppressed.
This space–time possesses several interesting properties. Note from (A6.9) that
x4 D constant hypersurfaces are always ﬂat. Also, for distances sr 	 R2, the
full four-dimensional space–time is ﬂat, as is the space–time anywhere where the
ﬁrst two derivatives of f .sr/ are zero. As well, it is not difﬁcult to show that
observers possessing 4-velocity components ui D Œsvf .sr/; 0; 0; 1 are traveling
along geodesics. As a concrete example, consider an observer located at x1
O D
sX 1.x4/; x2
O D x3
O D 0 and therefore traveling with the ship. It may immediately
be seen that, for such an observer, the invariant inﬁnitesimal line element (A6.9)
yields the condition ds2
O D .dx4/2
O. (Note that f .sr/ D 1 in the immediate
vicinity of the ship.) Recalling that ds2 along a world line yields minus the
inﬁnitesimal proper time squared along that world line tells us that the lapse of
proper time for an observer traveling with the ship is equal to the lapse of proper
time for a static observer located at some distance > R from the ship, for whom
ds2 D .dx4/2 also holds. Therefore, there is no relative time dilation between
such observers. (We are assuming that the function f .sr/ is very close to a true
top-hat function, which is a good approximation as long as  is large.)
Qualitatively, the top hat, often called the warp bubble, is “propelled” through
the external space–time with a coordinate velocity sv, and any object enclosed in
the bubble moves along with it. This velocity can be very large, the important point
being that objects inside the bubble always possess 4-velocities that are timelike.
This emphasizes an important point in general relativity that the structure of the
light cones is a local phenomenon. As long as 4-velocities remain within their local
light cone, the velocity is timelike or subluminal (in the local sense).

located in a region with no expansion nor compression

This function is plotted (with the x3 coordinate suppressed) in Fig. A6.5.
It should be stressed that the contraction of volume elements in front of the
spaceship is simply a “by-product” phenomenon due to the type of metric chosen.
The space ship does not travel at apparent superluminal speed by moving through
the compressed space. The space ship is always located inside the warp bubble,
where the space is approximately ﬂat.
Finally, we brieﬂy analyze the properties of the matter ﬁeld required to support
a warp bubble such as the one described here. The energy density, as measured by

in order to generate this exotic geometry. The distribution of this negative energy
density is plotted in Fig. A6.6. Again, energy conditions are violated.
A6.3
Time Machines
We conclude our survey of exotic solutions by considering some space-times which
contain closed causal (null or timelike) or closed timelike curves (CTCs). We have
already brieﬂy touched upon such phenomena when discussing the Kerr space–time.
We shall present a few more such solutions here.
CTCs are associated with space-times which possess some property which allows
a continuous timelike curve to intersect with itself. That is, some observer may
travel into his or her own past. (These deﬁnitions may be extended to include null
curves as well.) Two qualitative examples of CTCs are displayed in Fig. A6.7, where
“forward light cones” have been drawn to indicate the timelike nature of the curves.
It should be noted that the space-times in the ﬁgures may possess an everywhere
nonvanishing vector ﬁeld which is timelike and continuous (and thus may be time-
orientable). Also, locally, one can deﬁne a “past” and a “future” in the ﬁgures.
However, globally this is not possible, as a forward-pointing timelike vector tangent
to a timelike curve may be Fermi–Walker transported along the curve in the forward
direction (see Fig. 2.13), only to wind up in the past of its point of origin.
Causality violation refers to the violation of the premise that cause precedes
effect, as would be possible in a space–time with CTCs. We deﬁne the causality
violating region of a space–time point p, C.p/, as
C.p/ WD C.p/ \ CC.p/;

b
Fig. A6.7 Two examples of closed timelike curves. In (a) the closure of the timelike curve is
introduced by topological identiﬁcation. In (b) the time coordinate is periodic
where C.p/ and CC.p/ represent the causal past and causal future of p, re-
spectively (see Fig. 2.2). For causally well-behaved space-times, this intersection
is empty for all p. The causality violating region of a space–time M is
C.M / D
[
p2M
C.p/;
and a space–time whose C.M / D ; is known as a causal space–time.
It is interesting to note that the source of causality violation in many space-times
with closed timelike curves is the presence of large angular momentum. Several of
the examples below shall reveal this phenomenon, and it will become clear that the
coupling of a time coordinate with an angular coordinate (caused by the presence
of rotation) can cause the angular coordinate to become timelike, and thus generate
causality violating regions of the type in part b) of Fig. A6.7.
We consider ﬁrst the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space–time (see Exercise 10 of
Sect. 2.3). AdS space–time is a constant (negative) curvature solution to the ﬁeld
equations which is supported by a negative cosmological constant, 
. The solution
may be obtained from the induced metric on the hyper-hyperboloid deﬁned by

The topology of the AdS manifold is therefore S1 R3. Referring to Fig. A6.8, it
can be shown that, for example, curves represented by circles orbiting around the X-
axis on the hyperbolic manifold are everywhere timelike. This space–time therefore
exhibits closed timelike curves of the type displayed in Fig. A6.7a). Usually, when
dealing with AdS space–time, one deals with the universal covering space of anti-
de Sitter space–time, which involves unwrapping the S1 part of the topology, thus
yielding R4 topology.
Next, in our brief review of causality-violating solutions, we present the G¨odel
universe [116]. The G¨odel universe represents a rotating universe supported by a
negative cosmological constant, 
, and a dust matter source and possessing R4
topology. The rotation is somewhat peculiar in the sense that all points in this
universe may be seen as equivalent. That is, there is no preferred point about which
the G¨odel universe is rotating. (See [126] for details.)
In one popular coordinate system, the G¨odel universe metric admits a line

2/, the metric
component g'' switches sign. This is one indication that the ' coordinate changes
character from a spacelike nature to a timelike nature.1 The ' coordinate is truly
an angular coordinate, that is, it is periodic. Therefore, for values of % > ln.1 C
p
2/, this “angle” is timelike. Although not a geodesic, an observer in the G¨odel
space–time at % > % could travel along a trajectory in the ' direction and meet
1One has to be cautious when applying this loose criterion. A more rigorous discussion is based
on the eigenvalue structure of the metric tensor as, for example, presented in various preceding
chapters.

Fig. A6.9 The light-cone structure about an axis % D 0 in the G¨odel space–time. On the left, the
light cones tip forward, and on the right, they tip backward. Note that at % D ln.1 C
p
2/ the
light cones are sufﬁciently tipped over that the ' direction is null. At greater %, the ' direction is
timelike, indicating the presence of a closed timelike curve
up with him/herself after one complete “revolution”! This type of causal structure is
similar to that depicted in Fig. A6.7b. A ﬁgure of this peculiar light-cone structure
is displayed in Fig. A6.9 (also see ﬁgure caption).
The ﬁnal solution we discuss is the Van Stockum space–time [251]. This solution
to the ﬁeld equations was one of the ﬁrst to exhibit the behavior of CTCs. Physically,
the solution describes an inﬁnitely long cylinder of rotating dust with a vacuum
exterior, the angular momentum preventing the gravitational collapse of the dust.
The interior solution admits the following line element in corotating cylindrical
coordinates:
ds2 D e!2%2 
d%2 C dz2
C %2.d'/2 

dt  !%2 d'
2 ;
(A6.17)
with 1 < t < 1, 0 < % < %0, 1 < z < 1 and  < ' <  .
Here, ! represents the (constant) angular velocity of the dust cylinder. Again
notice that the ' and t coordinates are coupled and that for !% > 1 the periodic '
coordinate becomes timelike. One could argue that by placing the boundary of the
dust cylinder at some % D %0 <
1
! , the problem of CTCs would be cured, as the
above interior metric is no longer valid at !% D 1. However, it has been shown that
if !%0 > 1
2 CTCs still appear in the vacuum exterior [248]. But causality violation
is avoided if !%0  1
2, although there may exist other pathologies. As can be seen

Appendix 6
Exotic Solutions: Wormholes, Warp-Drives, and Time Machines

here, strong rotation also causes the light cones to tip and a large enough value of
! will cause CTCs to occur somewhere in the space–time. This is analogous to the
situation shown in Fig. A6.7b.
Before closing this section, we mention that the wormholes described earlier in
this appendix may also be used as a time machine. One process involves the time
dilation effect when two mouths of a wormhole move with respect to each other.
The interested reader is referred to [247].

The partial differential equation above originates in the theory of gas dynamics
[43]. The p.d.e. is elliptic for the half-plane x1 > 0, but hyperbolic for the other
half-plane x1 < 0. Thus, this equation motivates us to consider mathematically the

Appendix 7
Gravitational Instantons
In case x4 > 0; the above metric is transformable to the Kasner metric of Example
4.2.1. However, in case x4 < 0; the metric yields a Ricci-ﬂat, positive deﬁnite
metric. Two distinct sectors of the manifold have a common three-dimensional,
positive deﬁnite hypersurface with the metric:

The toy model in (A7.2) goes beyond the traditional deﬁnition of either a Rieman-
nian or else a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The common boundary D can be called
an instanton-horizon.
The static, vacuum, space–time metrics can generate positive deﬁnite, Ricci-ﬂat
metrics as in (A7.2).
At this point, we should mention that a gravitational instanton metric is not
synonymous with a Riemannian metric. That is, the presence of a positive deﬁnite
metric is necessary but not sufﬁcient to guarantee that the solution is a gravitational
instanton.1
Theorem A7.1. Let the function w.x/ and the positive deﬁnite, three-dimensional
metric
ıg::.x/ be of class C 3 in D  R3: Moreover, let
g::.x/ WD e2w.x/ 
ıg::.x/  e2w.x/ 
dx4 ˝ dx4
satisfy vacuum ﬁeld equations R::.x/ D O::.x/ in D WD D  R: Then, the four-
dimensional, positive deﬁnite metric
bg::.x/ WD e2w.x/ 
ıg::.x/ C e2w.x/ 

dx4 ˝ dx4
is Ricci ﬂat in D  R:
Proof. For both of the metrics g::.x/ andbg::.x/; conditions of Ricci ﬂatness reduce
to the same equations (4.41i,ii).

However, such an easy transition to the positive deﬁnite status is not possible
from stationary, vacuum metrics (which are not static). Let us explore this situation
in more detail. Consider the “stationary,” positive deﬁnite, four-dimensional metric:

1A gravitational instanton metric is a C 3 class of vacuum metrics in a “space–time” with a positive
deﬁnite C4 signature which is geodesically complete. Often in cases of interest, they possess a
self-dual or anti-self dual Riemann tensor (to be discussed shortly).

(Obviously, the metric above admits the Killing vector

(i) Moreover, let N.x/ be continuous up to and on the boundary @D: In case

transformable to the “static form.”

x0 2 D: Then, the four-dimensional curvature tensor R::::.x/  O::::.x/ for all

The class of exact solutions given by (A7.13), (A7.11), and (A7.12) was discovered
by Kloster, Som, and Das (K–S–D in short) in 1974 [149]. Hawking rediscovered
the same metric in 1977 [125]. We shall call the metric in (A7.13) as the H–K–S–D
metric.
Now recall the Hodge-dual mapping in (1.113). It implies for the curvature tensor

Rijkl.x/  .1=2/  rskl.x/  Rij rs.x/ D Rijkl.x/;
(A7.16)
the curvature tensor is called anti-self-dual. Both (A7.15) and (A7.16) can be
combined into
Rijkl.x/  "  Rijkl.x/;
" D ˙1:
(A7.17)
It can be proved that in case of the H–K–S–D metric of (A7.13), the condition in
(A7.17) is identically satisﬁed by the use of (A7.9) [110].
Instantons are regular, ﬁnite-action solutions of the ﬁeld equations in a four-
dimensional, positive deﬁnite, ﬂat (or curved) “space–time”. For Yang-Mills type
of gauge ﬁeld theories, the construction of Atiyah, Drinﬁeld, Hitchin, and Manin
[11] allows one to compute all regular, self-dual (or anti-self-dual) solutions.
However, in the case of gravitation, the situation is more complicated. We deﬁne
gravitational instantons as positive deﬁnite metrics of class C 3; which are Ricci ﬂat
and geodesically complete. There exist gravitational instantons which are neither
self-dual, nor anti-self-dual. A class of these are provided by the “static metrics”
of Theorem A7.1. Fortunately, H–K–S–D metrics supply inﬁnitely many self-dual
(or anti-self-dual) gravitational instantons which are useful for some path-integral
approaches to quantum gravity.
Example A7.3. Consider the multicenter H–K–S–D gravitational instantons fur-
nished by the function

2mA
k x  xA k > 0:
(A7.18)
Here, a  0 and mA > 0 are constants. (Compare with the pseudo-Riemannian
Example 4.2.8.) If mA D m for all A 2 f1; : : : ; Ng and if x4 is a periodic variable
with the fundamental period in 0  x4  . m=N /; then singularities at x D xA
are removable. Such solutions qualify as gravitational instantons. In case a D 1 and
N D 1; the metric is called the self-dual Taub-NUT metric [126]. In case a D 0 and
N D 2; we obtain the Eguchi-Hansen gravitational instantons [85].

Computational Symbolic Algebra Calculations
In this appendix, we present some calculations relevant to general relativity utilizing
popular symbolic algebra computer programs. Calculations in general relativity are
notoriously lengthy and complicated, and therefore, computational symbolic algebra
programs are very useful in this ﬁeld. Two popular symbolic algebra programs are
MapleTM and MathematicaTM , both of which we concentrate on here. For the sake
of brevity, we do not discuss special packages, available for both programs, which
are designed to supplement the ability of these programs to do general relativistic
calculations. (For example, we do not discuss the use of the excellent add-on
package available for both MapleTM and MathematicaTM called GRTensorII, which
is available at http://grtensor.phy.queensu.ca/).

We next calculate the Christoffel symbols of the second
kind. The triplets such as fi; 1; 4g in the braces correspond
to the index (i) and the range of the index (1 to 4). The
operator DŒmetricŒŒs; j; coordŒŒk calculates the partial
derivative of the s  j metric component with respect to
the coordinate k.
