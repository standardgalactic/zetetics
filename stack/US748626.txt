LIZZIE J. MAGIE, OF BRENTWOOD, MARYLAND. 
GAMEBOARD 
SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 748,626, dated January 5, 1904. 
Application filed March 23, 1903, Serial No. 149,177. (No model) 
To all whom it may concern: 
Beit known that I, LIZZIE.J. MAGIE, a citi 
Zen of the United States, residing at Brent 
wood, in the county of Prince George and State 
5 of Maryland, have invented certain new and 
useful Improvements in Game - Boards, of 
which the following is a specification. 
My invention, which I have designated 
'The landlord's game,' relates to game 
boards, and more particularly to games of 
chance. 
The object of the game is to obtain as much 
wealth or money as possible, the player hav 
ing the greatest amount of wealth at the end 
o 
I5 number of circuits of the board have been 
made being the winner. 
In the drawingsforming a part of this speci 
fication, and in which like symbols of refer 
ence represent corresponding parts in the sev 
eral views, Figure 1 is a plan view of the 
board, showing the different spaces marked 
thereon. Figure2shows the various movable 
.ieces used in the game; and Fig. 3 is a view 
of one of the boxes, the same being designated 
as the 'bank.’ 
The implements of the game consist of a 
board which is divided into a number of 
spaces or sections and four (4) spaces in the 
center indicating, respectively, “Bank,’ 
“Wages,” “Public treasury,' and “Rail 
road.” Within these four spaces are prefer 
ably placed four (4) boxes, one of which is 
shown in the drawings and represented by 
the numeral 24. 
The movable pieces used in the game, only 
one piece of each set for convenience of illus 
tration being shown in the drawings, are as 
follows: Four pairs of dice, four shaking 
boxes, four checkers to check the throws 
made, boxes representing, respectively, 
“Bank,” “Wages,” “Public treasury,” and 
'Railroad,” and also various colored chips 
or tickets representing lots, money, deeds, 
notes, individual mortgages, bank mortgages, 
charters, legacies, and luxuries. These chips 
are not to be limited to any certain number 
or colors. 
25 indicates lot tickets; 26, the dice; 27,

5o shaking-boxes; 28, deeds; 29, notes; 30, in 
dividual mortgages; 31, bank mortgages; 32, 
of the game after a certain predetermined 
charters; 33, luxuries; 35, money; 36, check 
ers, and 34 legacies. 
The game is played as follows: Each player 
is provided with five hundred dollars. The 
lot tickets, twenty-two (22) in number, are 
placed face downward upon the board, and 
each player draws one until twelve have been 
taken. The rest are put back in the wages 
box. Each player looks at the tickets he has 
drawn and may purchase the lot correspond 
ing to his ticket if he can afford to or so 
chooses. If he does not purchase, he does not 
have to pay rent, but simply puts the ticket 
back into the wages-box again. When these 
twelve lots have been bought or the privilege 
refused and the owner's deeds placed upon 
those purchased, the game begins. 
The series of spaces upon the board are col 
ored to distinguish them; but of course other 
means of making them distinctive may be em 
ployed. The lot-spaces '1' to “22,’ which 
are preferably green, are for sale at the high 
est figure marked upon them or for rent-at 
the lowest figure marked upon them. If a 
player chooses to buy a lot, he must pay into 
the “Public treasury' the price of it and 
place his deed upon it. If he chooses to rent 
it, he must pay the rent to the “Public treas 
ury.” 
- 
Absolute necessities: These spaces, which 
are preferably blue, indicate absolute neces 
sities-such as bread, coal, shelter, and cloth 
ing-and when a player stops upon any of 
these he must pay five dollars into the “Pub 
lic fasury." (This represents indirect taxa 
tion. 
Notrespassing: Spaces marked “No tres 
passing' represent property held out of use, 
and when a player stops on one of these 
spaces he must go to jail and remain there 
until he throws a double or until he pays into 
the “Public treasury’a fine of fifty dollars. 
When he comes out, he must count from the 
space immediately in front of the jail. 
Railroad: 'R. R.' represents transporta 
tion, and when a player stops upon one of 
these spaces he must pay five dollars to the 
“R. R.” If a player throws a double, he 
'Gets a pass” and has the privilege of jump 
ing once from one railroad to another, pro 
vided he would in his ordinary moving pass

a “R. R.” If he stops upon it, however, he 
must pay five dollars. 
Luxuries: These spaces, preferably pur 
ple, represent the luxuries of life, and if a 
player stops on a “Luxury' he pays fifty dol 
lars to the Public treasury,' receiving in 
return a luxury ticket, which counts him 
sixty dollars at the end of the game. The 
player may purchase the luxury or not, as 
he chooses or can afford; but if he does not 
purchase it he loses his move. 
Franchises: These spaces, preferably yel 
low, indicate light franchise and water fran 
chise and are public necessities. The first 
player who stops upon one of these franchises 
puts his charter upon it, and all though the 
game he has the privilege of taxing all the 
other players five dollars whenever they 
chance to stop upon it. 
It costs him nothing 
and counts him nothing at the end of the 
game.

Public park: A player may stop in the 
“Public park' without paying anything. 
Legacy: If a player stops upon the “Leg 
acy,” he gets one hundred dollars cash and a 
legacy-ticket. 
Mother earth: Each time a player goes 
around the board he is supposed to have per 
formed so much labor upon mother earth, for 
which after passing the beginning-point he 
receives his wages, one hundred dollars, and 
is checked upon the tally-sheet as having 
been around once. 
Poorhouse: If at any time a player has no 
money with which to meet expenses and has 
no property upon which he can borrow, he 
must go to the poorhouse and remain there 
until he makes such throws as will enable 
him to finish the round. 
Rent: When a player stops upon a lot 
owned by any of the players, he must pay the 
rent to the owner. If he stops upon one of 
his own lots, of course he pays nothing. If 
two players stop upon the same lot, the sec 
ond must pay to the first one-half of the rent, 
(in case of an odd number giving to the first 
the benefit of the fraction.) If a third play 
er's throw brings him on the same-lot, he can 
not occupy it, but must remain upon the 
space next to it, counting his throw one less. 
In case of lot 1 the player gets the whole rent. 
Borrowing: A player may borrow from the 
“Bank” in amounts of one hundred dollars, 
and for every one hundred dollars borrowed 
the “Bank' takes a mortgage on one or more 
of the borrower's lots, the total value of 
which must be at least ten dollars more than 
is borrowed. For every one hundred dollars 
borrowed from the “Bank’ a bank mortgage 
is placed upon the property on which the loan 
is made, and the player puts his note in the 
“Bank,' paying upon each note five dollars 
(interest) every time he receives his wages. 
One player may borrow from another, giving 
a mortgage on any property he may own and 
making the best bargain he can as to inter 
est, terms of payment, &c. The player loan 
748,626 
ing the money places his individual mort 
gage on the top of the borrower's deed to 
show that he has a mortgage on that prop 
erty. Should a loan be repaid before passing 
the beginning-point, the borrower saves the 
interest. 
Five times around: When a player has 
been around the board five times, he may move 
in either direction, provided he is clear of 
debt, until each of the other players has been 
around five times; but having passed the be 
ginning-point the required number of times 
he receives no more wages. The game is 
finished when the last player has passed the 
beginning-point the fifth time. 
Counting up: As the deeds are removed 
from the lots each player is credited with the 
value of the lots owned by him. His cash on 
hand is counted, and the amount set down 
under the total value of the lots. Then the 
luxuries are counted, (remember that each 
one counts sixty,) and the amountset down un 
der cash. Add together these three amounts 
lots, cash, and luxuries-and the player who 
has the largest sum-total is the winner. 
Playing without the lot tickets: Some have 
found it more interesting to play the game 
without using the lot tickets at all, players 
simply purchasing lots as they come to them 
in the ordinary moving. In this case the 
player is provided with one hundred dollars 
to begin with. The number of times around 
the board may also be regulated by the will 
of the players. 
Emergencies: Should any emergency arise 
which is not covered by the rules of the game, 
the players must settle the matter between 
themselves; but if any player absolutely re 
fuses to obey the rules as above set forth 
he must go to jail and remain there until he 
throws a double or pays his fine, as explained 
in paragraph “No trespassing.' 
EIaving now fully described my invention, 
what I claim as new, and desire to secure by 
Letters Patent, is 
1. A game-board, having corner-spaces, one 
constituting the starting-point, and a series 
of intervening spaces indicating different de 
nominations, some of the spaces of the differ 
ent series corresponding, and distinguished 
by coloring or other marking, so that the cor 
responding divisions on the four spaces may 
be readily recognized. 
2. A game - board, provided with corner 
spaces, intervening spaces of different de 
nominations, some of the spaces of the differ 
ent series corresponding, and distinguished 
by coloring or other marking, so that the cor 
responding spaces in the different divisions 
may be recognized, and a series of movable 
pieces having reference to the different divi 
sions upon the board. 
3. A game-board, having a series of divi 
sions of different denominations upon its outer 
border, one constituting the starting-point, 
four divisions within said series for the recep 
tion of boxes, a series of movable pieces hav

ing reference to the spaces upon the board, and 
a chance device to control the movement of the 
pieces. 
4. A game-board, provided with corner 
spaces, intervening spaces of different de 
nominations, and distinguished by distinc 
TO 
tive marking, so that the coresponding divi 
sions on the different spaces may be recog 
nized, movable pieces having reference to the 
spaces, a chance device to control the move 
ment of the pieces, checkers, and tickets rep 
resenting money, deeds, notes, mortgages, 
bank mortgages, charters, legacies, and lux 
uries, adapted to be used in connection with 
the same. 
In testimony whereof I affix my signature 
in presence of two witnesses.
