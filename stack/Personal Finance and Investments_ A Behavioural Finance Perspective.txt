Personal Finance and Investments
‘The reader should not expect to ﬁnd unambiguous answers to all the many questions concerning personal ﬁnance and
investments,’ Keith Redhead argues in the preface to this new textbook, thus underlining the role personal judgement
plays in personal ﬁnance and investments. Personal judgement should be informed by many perspectives; hence his
interdisciplinary approach to the study of personal ﬁnance and investments.In this book,the author draws from ﬁnance,
psychology, economics and other disciplines in business and the social sciences, recognising that personal ﬁnance and
investments are subjects of study in their own right rather than merely branches of another discipline.
Considerable attention is given to some topics, which are either ignored or given very little attention in other texts.
These include:
■the psychology of investment decision-making
■stock market bubbles and crashes
■property investment
■the use of derivatives in investment management
■regulation of investments business.
More traditional subject areas are also thoroughly covered, including:
■investment analysis
■portfolio management
■capital market theory
■market efﬁciency
■international investing
■bond markets
■institutional investments
■option pricing
■macroeconomics
■the interpretation of company accounts.
Packed with over one hundred exercises,examples and exhibits and a helpful glossary of key terms,this book will help
the reader to grasp the relevant principles of money management.The book avoids non-essential mathematics and
provides a new approach to the study of personal ﬁnance and investments.The book will be essential for students and
researchers engaged with personal finance, investments, behavioural finance, financial derivatives, and financial
economics.
Keith Redhead is Principal Lecturer in the Department of Economics,Finance and Accounting at Coventry University
Business School. He is also the author of Introducing Investments:A Personal Finance Approach and Financial Derivatives:An
Introduction to Futures,Forwards,Options and Swaps.

Preface
This book approaches personal ﬁnance from an investments perspective, and investments from a
personal ﬁnance perspective.Texts in the area of ﬁnance tend to be either on corporate ﬁnance or
investments.However the appropriate dichotomy may be between corporate ﬁnance and personal
ﬁnance.Texts on personal ﬁnance would cover investments,as the current one does.In the future
texts may emerge covering other aspects of personal ﬁnance such as saving and debt.The present
text pays some attention to saving and debt,but the emphasis is on investments.This emphasis stems
largely from the fact that there is far more academic literature on investing than on saving and
borrowing.There are a few texts available speciﬁcally on personal ﬁnance with coverage of savings
and debt, but unfortunately they tend to be at a relatively elementary level of analysis with little
reference to the academic literature.
The current text differs from other texts on investments in a number of ways:
1.
It recognises that investing is a behaviour, which can be analysed from the perspectives of a
number of disciplines. Many investment texts are based solely on ﬁnancial economics.When
they allow another discipline into the analysis it is typically by means of a separate chapter,or
section of a chapter,on behavioural ﬁnance.This entails a consideration of the implications of
cognitive psychology.The present text does not separate behavioural ﬁnance into a separate
chapter, but integrates it into many aspects of investing. It also goes beyond cognitive
psychology and introduces the signiﬁcance of a number of other disciplines such as social
psychology, sociology, accounting, macroeconomics, politics, demography, gerontology,
media studies, and marketing.
2.
It uses less mathematics than most other texts.Although mathematics can provide rigour, it
can also be a barrier to communication. Many readers ﬁnd mathematics impenetrable, and
can lose sight of the fundamental principles by being distracted by mathematical methodology.
Furthermore mathematics can limit discussion to the measurable dimensions,whereas many
important aspects of personal ﬁnance and investing are not measurable.
3.
There has been an attempt to integrate the most recent (at the time of writing) literature
into the discussion so that readers become acquainted with the most recent ideas and
evidence.
4.
The text recognises that personal ﬁnance is about money management.Correspondingly the
concepts and principles covered are related to the money management problems of individual
investors.
5.
Many of the investment theories are illustrated by numerical examples.
6.
The text has a UK orientation.Whilst non-UK residents can use the text to learn about the
principles and processes of personal ﬁnance and investments,the institutional examples (e.g.
savings schemes, pension schemes, and the regulatory framework) are UK-based. However
about 95% of the text has universal relevance.
7.
There are chapters dealing with issues that are important but rarely given emphasis in other
texts. Examples include the psychology of ﬁnancial decision-making, stock market bubbles
and crashes,the signiﬁcance of institutional investors,the purposes and processes of regulation,

xxv
property investment and ﬁnance,and alternative investments such as structured products and
hedge funds.
8.
The text recognises that most investment at the personal level is carried out through
institutional investors. Consequently there is much more emphasis on institutional investors
than is typically the case with other texts.
THEORY AND PRACTICE
This book should be useful to practitioners in the ﬁelds of personal ﬁnance and investments as well
as to students. Sometimes practitioners dismiss theory as irrelevant to their needs. However an
understanding of relevant theory can be of great assistance to practitioners.It is worth quoting from
Cordell et al. (2006:78):
Although academic research is often obtuse and unrealistic,many articles have implications
that have relevance to the real world inhabited by practitioners. Plowing through the
mathematics and statistics of some articles may be a stretch for most practitioners, but the
inferences drawn from articles are often worthy of the ﬁnancial service professional’s time
and effort.Indeed,many of the ﬁnancial concepts used daily by practitioners . . .were born
in academic articles.
This book incorporates the contributions of more than 800 recent articles, which are of
relevance to both practitioners and academics.The intention has been to make the concepts and
implications of those articles readily accessible to those who lack the time to devote to reading the
articles themselves.However, the articles are referenced so the reader is able to refer to the articles
where this is desired.
THE ONLY THING THAT IS CERTAIN IS UNCERTAINTY
The reader should not expect to ﬁnd unambiguous answers to all the many questions concerning
personal ﬁnance and investments.One of the reasons for ambiguity is the existence of differences
in opinion.There is, in particular, a dichotomy between two schools of thought. One school is
known as the traditional or neoclassical tradition (but which could be referred to as the
arbitrage–optimisation tradition).According to this school of thought most people act rationally
(or nearly so) and ﬁnancial markets allow them to do so.Markets are expected to be accessible and
investors should have equal access to information. Arbitrage and optimisation are important
concepts in this tradition.The returns from investments are expected to be no more,nor less,than
fair compensation for delaying expenditure and accepting risk.This is probably the dominant school
of thought amongst academics.
The main alternative school of thought is referred to as behavioural.According to this approach
people are frequently irrational and ﬁnancial markets do not always provide conditions that permit
rational investors to fully achieve their objectives. Sentiment plays a large part in this tradition.
Practitioners are often more comfortable with this school of thought.
The reader may find that there are different answers to the same questions.This is to be
expected, particularly when there are radically different ways of thinking about problems.The
PREFACE

debates continue. It should not be assumed that one perspective is correct for all times and in all
markets.
According to the efﬁcient market hypothesis all investments are correctly priced since they
reﬂect all relevant information (or are sufﬁciently accurately priced to preclude the possibility of
proﬁting from mispricing).The debate about the efﬁcient market hypothesis may seem arcane but
it is central to the debate between the two main schools of thought.Traditional ﬁnance theory is
largely premised on market efﬁciency.If ﬁnancial markets were not efﬁcient,the case for traditional
ﬁnance theory would be weakened. It may be expected that degrees of efﬁciency vary from time
to time and from market to market.
There are many ﬁnancial market adages. One is:‘The only thing that is certain is uncertainty’.
This applies not only to financial markets but also to the analysis and understanding of those
markets.

Introduction
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide an understanding of:
1. The functions and operation of ﬁnancial systems.
2. The nature of personal ﬁnancial planning.
3. The nature of investment risk.
People save and invest for various purposes: for holidays, home improvements, cars, deposits
for house purchase, children’s education, old age, and general security. Some of these are short-
term objectives and others long term.The single biggest long-term objective is usually the provision
of a retirement income.The time horizon of the investment will inﬂuence the nature of the
investment. Savings for a holiday are unlikely to be put into a risky investment such as shares.
Saving for a pension is unlikely to be in low return investments such as bank or building society
accounts.
The largest investment item for many people is their pension fund. At an annuity rate of
8% per annum (p.a.), a pension of £20,000 a year requires a pension fund of £250,000.Whether
a pension is being provided by an employer or being funded by the employee,a substantial sum of
money needs to be accumulated. So successful investing is vital.
The need to invest for retirement is becoming increasingly important as governments
progressively back away from promising adequate state pensions. In Europe and North America,
as well as elsewhere in the world, the proportion of retired people in the population is rapidly
increasing.This is often called the demographic time bomb. In the United Kingdom (UK), for
children born in 1901,the average life expectancy was 45 for males and 49 for females (Harrison
2005).Those born in 2002 had average life expectancies of 76 for males and 81 for females. Life
expectancy is steadily increasing,and with it the average period of life in retirement.The result is
a rising ratio of pensioners to workers.It is often seen to be unrealistic to expect those of working
age to pay the increasingly high taxes needed to pay good pensions to members of the retired
population.One answer is to encourage people to provide for their own pensions by accumulating
pension funds during their working lives (another approach is to raise the retirement age).

According to a World Bank publication (Palacios and Pallares-Miralles 2000) the percentages
of the populations of the UK, Germany, and France over 60 in 2000 were 20.7%, 20.6%, and
20.2% respectively. The expected percentages for 2030 were 30.1%, 36.35%, and 30.0%
respectively.According to the US Census Bureau (1999),in Western Europe (the members of the
European Union as of 1999) the ratio of people of retirement age (65) to those of working age
(20–64) was about 0.15 in 1950. By 2000 it had nearly doubled to 0.29. It is projected to
approximately double again,to about 0.64,by 2050.The ratio of pensioners to people of working
age would have risen from about 1 to 6 in 1950, to around 4 to 6 in 2050. It is clearly unrealistic
to expect those of working age to be able,and willing,to pay sufﬁcient taxation to provide so many
retirees with adequate pensions.Table 1.1 shows some Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) ﬁgures that illustrate the ageing populations in a number of countries
(derived from OECD population pyramids).
There is also the issue of how to invest.Stock market investments,particularly shares,are seen
by many people to be too risky. However, historically shares have massively outperformed other
forms of investment such as bank deposits.The issue of relative risk needs to be seen in relation to
an investor’s time horizon.The picture from a 40-year perspective is very different from that of a
one-month perspective. Investments in shares can beneﬁt from time diversiﬁcation; over a long
time span good periods can balance out bad periods. Also from a long-term perspective, the
accumulated income from investments becomes more important in determining the ﬁnal sum
accumulated. For example £1,000 invested at 4% over 40 years will grow to £4,801, whereas at
8% it would grow to £21,725.The income receipts from stock market investments may be more
stable than the interest receipts on bank or building society deposits.
According to the Barclays Capital Equity Gilt Study (1999;the study is updated annually on the
Barclays Capital website),£100 invested in a balanced portfolio of UK shares in 1918 would have
grown to nearly £420,000 by 1998 (with dividends, net of basic rate tax, being reinvested).An
investment of £100 in Treasury bills over the same period would have grown to less than £2,500
(the Treasury bill rate of return is roughly equivalent to premium bank or building society deposits).
These represent rates of return of approximately 11% p.a. and 4% p.a. respectively. When
allowance is made for the effects of inﬂation on the purchasing power of money, the average rate
of return from bank and building society deposits has not been far above zero.The message seems
to be that the accumulation of wealth over long time periods,such as the periods typically required
for the accumulation of pension funds, requires investments to be made in stock markets.

FUNCTIONS OF FINANCIAL SYSTEMS
A ﬁnancial system can be looked upon as a combination of ﬁnancial markets, institutions, and
regulations that aim to perform a set of economic functions.Most of those functions have a direct
bearing on investment decisions and behaviour.The functions might be regarded as the provision
of means of:
1.
Settling payments.
2.
Investing surplus funds.
3.
Raising capital.
4.
Transferring funds from surplus units (savers) to deﬁcit units (borrowers).
5.
Managing ﬁnancial risk.
6.
Pooling resources.
7.
Dividing ownership.
8.
Producing information.
9.
Dealing with incentive problems.
1.
Settling payments.This refers to the mechanisms for making payments. Mechanisms include
cash, cheques, credit cards, and so forth.This relates to investment only in so far as there
needs to be a mechanism of paying for investments.
2.
Investing surplus funds.This is the investment process. Investors have varied needs and wishes
concerning risk,return,liquidity,and other characteristics of investments.A ﬁnancial system
should provide a wide range of investment choices so that individuals can satisfy their
investment objectives.
3.
Raising capital. Some people or organisations have expenditure that exceeds their income.
They would need to raise capital by borrowing or selling shares.A ﬁnancial system should
provide suitable ﬁnancial instruments for obtaining funds. Such instruments would include
bank loans, various forms of bond, and various types of share.
4.
Transferring funds from surplus units to deﬁcit units.This brings functions 2 and 3 together. Not
only should there be suitable ﬁnancial instruments for investors and those raising capital,but
there should be markets or intermediaries for bringing them together.For example banks are
intermediaries that transfer money from investors who deposit money to borrowers who
receive loans.Stock markets transfer money from investors,who buy shares or bonds,to the
ﬁrms that issue the shares and bonds.
5.
Managing ﬁnancial risk. Most people or organisations that invest or raise funds face risks from
price movements. For example an investor in shares will lose in the event of a fall in share
prices. Financial systems should provide instruments for managing such risks. Risk
management instruments include derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options.
There are also other risks that need to be managed, such as default risk. Financial systems
generate credit rating agencies that inform investors of the levels of such risks.
6.
Pooling resources.When businesses and governments borrow they want to raise large sums of
money. Individuals normally have small sums to invest. By pooling the small sums of a large
number of individuals, large sums are made available to businesses and governments.The
pooling of large numbers of small amounts is carried out by intermediaries such as banks,
pension funds, and unit trusts.
INTRODUCTION

7.
Dividing ownership.When an investor buys shares in a company, the investor becomes part
owner of the company. Share issuance is a means of dividing the ownership of a company
among a large number of investors.The transfer of ownership to investors entails the transfer
of risks as well as prospective proﬁts.
8.
Producing information.The most common form of information produced by ﬁnancial systems
is information about prices.This would include prices of shares, bonds, and money (interest
rates are prices of money).Information about prices allows investors to measure their wealth,
and helps them to take decisions about how to allocate their wealth between different types
of investment. Interest rates are likely to inﬂuence decisions about saving and borrowing.
9.
Dealing with incentive problems. Incentive problems include principal-agent,moral hazard,and
adverse selection problems.It is in relation to such matters that regulation can be particularly
important.
Principal-agent problems can arise when investors allow others to take decisions for them, or
follow the advice of others. For example an investor may allow a ﬁnancial adviser to choose
investments.There is a risk that the adviser chooses the investments that pay the highest commission
to the adviser,rather than the investments that are best for the investor.This would be a case of the
adviser exploiting the situation of having more information than the investor.The investor is
referred to as the principal,the adviser as the agent,and the inequality of information as asymmetric
information.
The principal-agent situation can lead to moral hazard. Moral hazard can arise when the agent
takes the decisions but the principal bears the risks arising from those decisions.For example a fund
manager may make investments that are riskier than the investors would like.This could be possible
as a result of the fund manager (the agent) having more information (asymmetric information) than
the investor (the principal).
Adverse selection can be another consequence of asymmetric information. Consider the case
of annuities.Annuities are incomes for life sold by insurance companies. In exchange for a lump
sum the insurance company guarantees a monthly income for the rest of the life of the person
buying the annuity. Individuals know more about their health and prospective lifespans than
insurance companies can know (asymmetric information). People with short life expectancy are
less likely to buy annuities than those who expect to live for a long time (adverse selection).Those
who expect long lives stand to beneﬁt most from annuities.If insurance companies price annuities
according to average lifespans,they will lose money because people buying them will tend to have
longer than average lives.Women tend to live longer than men. If annuities are priced to match
average life expectancy (average of men and women together), women will buy annuities to a
greater extent than men.
INVESTORS AND BORROWERS
The ﬁnancial system serves the function of transferring money from those who want to invest to
those wishing to borrow (the term borrower is being used loosely here since ﬁrms that raise capital
by issuing shares are, strictly speaking, not borrowing but selling equity in their enterprises).The
cash ﬂows are illustrated by Figure 1.1. Savers invest by depositing money in banks (or building
societies),by buying bonds,or by buying shares.The borrowers may be individuals who obtain bank

loans or mortgages, governments that sell bonds, or private companies that raise money by both
of these means plus the sale of shares.The money passes from investors to borrowers through the
intermediation of banks or stock exchanges.
Most stock market investment by individuals is through the medium of institutional investments
such as pension funds,insurance funds,unit trusts,and investment trusts.The ﬁnancial system cash
ﬂows where stock market investment is carried out through institutional investments is illustrated
by Figure 1.2.
PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING
Personal ﬁnancial planning is the process of planning one’s spending,ﬁnancing,and investing so as
to optimise one’s ﬁnancial situation. A personal ﬁnancial plan speciﬁes one’s ﬁnancial aims and
objectives.It also describes the saving,ﬁnancing,and investing that are used to achieve those goals.

A ﬁnancial plan should contain personal ﬁnance decisions related to the following components:

Financing Large Purchases.
4.
Long-term Investing.
5.
Insurance.
Figure 1.2

Budgeting
The budgeting decision concerns the division of income between spending and saving.Saving will
increase one’s assets and/or reduce one’s debts.If spending exceeds income (i.e.there is negative
saving), assets will be reduced and/or liabilities increased.The excess of assets over liabilities is
one’s net worth. Saving increases net worth (negative saving reduces it).
Some saving might be very short term, for example keeping some of this month’s salary to
ﬁnance spending next month.Very short-term saving is part of the process of managing liquidity.
Other saving is medium term:saving for a holiday,a car,or a deposit on a house are examples.Such
saving is for the purpose of ﬁnancing large purchases. Long-term saving can have an investment
horizon of 40 years or more.The most important long-term saving for many people is saving for
a pension to provide an income in retirement. Other purposes of long-term saving include the
ﬁnancing of children’s education, and building up an estate to pass to one’s heirs.
Long-term saving for a pension will feel much more important when the investor is 55 than
when that investor is 25.However,early saving is far more productive than later saving.For example
£1,000 invested for ten years at 8% p.a. will grow to £2,159, whereas the same sum invested at
the same rate of return for 40 years will grow to £21,725.
Managing Liquidity
Liquidity is readily available cash,or other means of making purchases.Liquidity is needed for items
such as day-to-day shopping and meeting unexpected expenses such as repair bills. Liquidity
management involves decisions regarding how much money to hold in liquid form,and the precise
forms in which the money is to be held.Generally the more liquid an asset is,the lower the return
to be expected from it.The most liquid assets are banknotes and money in chequeable bank
accounts.These assets provide little or no interest. Slightly less liquid assets, such as deposit
accounts in banks or building societies, provide more interest but are slightly less accessible. It is
normally inappropriate to hold all of one’s wealth in liquid form since assets that are less liquid
(such as bonds and shares) generally offer much higher expected rates of return.
The alternative to using one’s own liquidity might be to borrow, for example by using a credit
card. Credit management is concerned with decisions about how much credit to use, and what
sources of credit to use.Whilst credit is a source of additional liquidity,it has the disadvantage that
interest has to be paid; and often at a high rate.
Financing Large Purchases
The ﬁnance for large purchases may be generated by saving,or by borrowing.Savings need not be
in highly liquid form (until the purchase is made) but should not be in a risky form. Such savings
would be expected to yield more interest than liquid cash, but a lower return than should be
available from risky assets such as shares and long-term bonds.
The accumulation of money for an expenditure in one,two,or three years might be in the form
of bank deposits or other short maturity money market investments. Over such a timescale, the
risk of capital loss from investment in shares or long-term bonds might be seen as excessive relative
to the potential extra return from such investments.As a general rule, the value of stock market
investments increases more than in proportion to time whilst risk increases less than
INTRODUCTION
7

proportionately to the passage of time. Such relationships make stock market investments
unsuitable for short-term saving, but very suitable for the long-term accumulation of wealth.
The types of large expenditure for which saving or borrowing are likely to used include holidays,
car purchase,higher education,and house purchase.Large expenditures,such as house purchase,
are likely to be partly ﬁnanced by borrowing (for example by means of mortgages).Short timescale
expenditures such as holidays are more likely to be ﬁnanced by saving.The credit management
involved when borrowing requires consideration of factors such as the number of years required
for repayment and the affordability of the monthly repayments. For a particular size of debt,
reducing the monthly payments will entail increasing the number of years for which repayments
will be made. Consideration should also be given to the potential variability of regular payments.
For example mortgage borrowing typically carries the risk that interest rates,and hence monthly
repayments, will rise.
Long-term Investing
Although there may be some other reasons for long-term saving, such as funding children’s
education or provision of a legacy to pass on to one’s heirs,the most important is the provision of
a retirement income.To appreciate the scale of what is involved for an individual,consider the case
of someone expecting to fund 20 years of retirement income from 40 years of work.Suppose that
the aim is to maintain the standard of living at the level achieved during the working life. In the
absence of a prospective real rate of return on investments,one-third of the income received while
working needs to be saved in order to provide the retirement income.
The need to save one-third of one’s income is based on a zero real net rate of return on
investments (the real net rate of return is the return after taking account of inﬂation and taxation).
Historically the real net rates of return on bank and building society accounts have been only a little
above zero, on average.The achievement of high real net rates of return has required investment
in shares. So the attainment of good investment returns has necessitated acceptance of the risk
associated with investment in shares. However that risk needs to be seen from a long-term
perspective.Figures 1.3 and 1.4 illustrate the behaviour of expected asset value and risk in relation
to the passage of time.
The shape of the curve in Figure 1.3 can be explained as being similar to the effect of compound
interest.The shape of the curve in Figure 1.4 might be explained in terms of the effects of time

diversiﬁcation; over a long time span good periods tend to offset bad periods.The two ﬁgures
illustrate why stock market investments should be used for long-term rather than short-term
savings.In the short term shares provide high risk relative to return,in the long term they tend to
produce high return relative to risk. (Some academics have questioned the notion of time
diversiﬁcation. Fisher and Statman (1999) discuss the views of dissenters.)
The effects of time diversiﬁcation have been illustrated by Fidelity,which is a major investment
management company (Fidelity International 2005). Examining the period 1985 to 2005, they
found that the UK stock market (as measured by the FTSE All-Share Index) produced a proﬁt in
77% of one-year periods, where a one-year period is 12 consecutive months (e.g. June 1986 to
May 1987, March 1992 to February 1993).There was a proﬁt in 81% of ﬁve-year periods, where
a ﬁve-year period is 60 consecutive months (e.g.September 1988 to August 1993).Every ten-year
period (120 consecutive months) showed a proﬁt.An international portfolio of stocks (as measured
by the MSCI World Index) produced ﬁgures of 71%, 81%, and 100% respectively.
In the same publication,the sudden nature of stock market movements was highlighted.During
the period 1990 to 2005 the UK stock market produced an average return of nearly 9% p.a., and
the international portfolio showed an average return of around 7% p.a. However removing the
best 40 days reduced the UK average annual return to slightly less than zero. Removal of the best
20 days reduced the average annual return on the international portfolio to about minus 2%.
Swank et al. (2002) argued that since many occupational pension plans have an unlimited future
investment period (no foreseeable termination date),they should hold 100% of their assets in the
form of shares.There seems to be virtually no risk that shares (alternatively referred to as equities)
would underperform other investments over such a long investment horizon.They suggest that
the failure to hold 100% in shares partly arises from short-term unpredictability of stock market
performance, which could require the company (or other pension provider) to fund shortfalls in
some years.There is also the career risk of investment managers, who could ﬁnd that a few years
of poor investment returns result in the loss of their jobs.The time horizons of providers and
managers may be shorter than the investment horizon of the pension fund.Time diversiﬁcation is
elaborated further in Chapter 13 on portfolio diversiﬁcation.
Insurance
Insurance entails making payments to an insurer for ﬁnancial protection. There is property
insurance which provides compensation in the event of damage to, or loss of, property such as
houses and cars. Life assurance pays money to dependants in the event of one’s death.A range of
other eventualities can be insured against.For example it is possible to take out insurance to cover
health care expenses or loss of income.
Sometimes insurance is combined with a savings scheme.This is the case with life assurance
products such as endowment policies and whole-of-life policies. Someone considering such
schemes should give thought to the question of whether it might be advantageous to keep insurance
policies and savings schemes separate.
THE NATURE OF INVESTMENT RISK
When people think of risk they often focus on capital risk. Capital risk is the risk that the value
of the investment might fall. Stock market investments, shares and bonds, are subject to capital
INTRODUCTION

risk since the prices of such investments can fall. However this may not be the most important
source of risk for an investor.Two other risks, which are often overlooked, are inﬂation risk and
income risk.
Inﬂation risk is the risk that the purchasing power value of assets can be eroded by inﬂation.
To give an idea of the potential effect of inﬂation, consider the impact of 2.5% p.a. inﬂation over
40 years.The purchasing power of £1 would fall to 37p.At an inﬂation rate of 5% p.a., the real
value of the £1 would fall to 14p. Over the last half-century, a period during which UK inﬂation
rates have at times exceeded 20% p.a.,inﬂation has inﬂicted severe damage on the wealth of people
with investments in deposits and bonds.This is a major reason for the fact that real net interest rates
from banks and building societies have averaged little more than zero.There have been periods when
real net interest rates have been negative (investments in banks and building societies have declined
in real value even after reinvestment of interest). For example if the interest rate is 3% p.a. and
inﬂation is 5% p.a., there is a loss of purchasing power of about 2% p.a.
The apparent risk-free nature of bank and building society deposits is called further into doubt
when income risk is considered.This is a particular problem for investors who want an immediate
income from their investments.Income risk is the risk that income payments from an investment
(interest or dividends) can fall. Interest rates on bank and building society deposits ﬂuctuate with
variations in the economy’s short-term interest rates. For example during 2001 interest rates on
premium accounts in the UK fell from around 6% p.a.to about 4% p.a.,and in the US the fall was
from about 6% p.a. to less than 2% p.a. Someone who depends on interest to provide an income
would have found such falls to be very problematical.
Bank and building society accounts are not the only investments that suffer from inﬂation risk
and income risk.Conventional annuities,which are guaranteed ﬁxed incomes bought at retirement
using money in pension funds,also suffer from such risks.Inﬂation reduces the purchasing power
of ﬁxed incomes,and the level of the ﬁxed incomes depends on long-term interest rates at the time
of retirement (for example the annual income bought for a particular sum in 2001 was about half
the income bought with the same sum ten years earlier). As a result there is a move towards
annuities that are based on investment in shares.Although investment in shares has high capital risk,
it has relatively low inﬂation risk and income risk.
CORE PRINCIPLES OF PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING
The assessment of personal ﬁnancial needs, either by a ﬁnancial adviser or someone evaluating
their own needs, can be based on CORE: Circumstances, Objectives, Risk, Expenditure.
The circumstances of an individual would include factors such as age, income, existing assets
and liabilities,and family responsibilities.Age is important since it determines both the time span
over which regular savings can take place,and the level of risk that can be accepted.Someone who
starts saving for a pension at the age of 25 may have a prospective 40 years over which to accumulate
a pension fund,someone starting to save at 55 may have just 10 years.The monthly payments into
a pension scheme by the 25 year old will be much smaller than the payments required from the
55 year old. Also the longer time span will allow the younger person to make higher risk
investments since there is more scope for good future periods to offset bad periods.
Income, including prospective future income, has considerable signiﬁcance. Not only does a
high income allow for high savings, a high prospective future income might also be seen as

permitting greater risk taking, as the potential for replacing poor investments is greater. Stability
of prospective future income is also important; someone with a stable and predictable income is
in a better position to accept risk from investments than someone with an unstable and uncertain
future income.
Prospective future income is often seen as a form of wealth, referred to as human capital. In
addition to human capital there is wealth in the form of real estate property and wealth in the form
of ﬁnancial assets.A person’s existing wealth is a determinant of both the need to save,and the level
of risk that can be accepted. Someone with £250,000 in a pension fund has less need for another
£1,000 in the fund than someone with just £10,000.The person with the larger pension fund can
afford to accept more risk on the additional £1,000 than the person with the small fund.
The form of existing wealth has implications for the nature of additional investments.If existing
wealth is low risk, there may be a greater willingness to accept risk from new investments.There
is also the desirability of diversiﬁcation;that is the avoidance of ‘putting all of one’s eggs in the same
basket’. If a person’s wealth contains no shares, there may be a greater willingness to put new
saving into shares than if shares already constitute a substantial part of the person’s wealth.Likewise
the principles of portfolio diversiﬁcation would impact on the choice of shares,for example if the
existing share portfolio is entirely in UK shares then additional share investment may be made in
the shares of foreign countries.
Financial liabilities also impact on investment decisions. A person with a large mortgage
commitment, or other form of debt, may be reluctant to allocate money to risky investments.
Indeed the best strategy might be to use any available money to reduce the debt rather than make
investments.Financial liabilities could also be in the form of family commitments.Someone with
dependent children is in a very different position to a person who has no dependants.A person
with no dependants can save more and take greater risks with the savings.
The ﬁnancial objectives have signiﬁcance for the amount to be saved, the investment horizon,
and the acceptable level of risk. A 25-year-old person saving for a pension at 65 would invest
differently from a 25-year-old person saving for a deposit on a house in two years from the present.
The former has an investment horizon of 40 years, the latter one of 2 years. Long investment
horizons allow for more risk taking than short horizons.Also for the accumulation of a speciﬁc
target sum of money, long periods of accumulation require smaller monthly savings than short
periods.Someone wishing to accumulate money to meet unforeseen emergencies has a high need
for liquidity. By liquidity is meant the ability to turn the asset into cash quickly and without the
risk of loss. Bank and building society deposits are very liquid.
People vary considerably in their attitudes to,and perceptions of,risk.Some are extremely risk-
averse, even to the extent that large prospective gains are not seen as adequate compensation for
the possibility of small losses.At the other extreme some people are excited by the prospect of
potential gains to the extent that they are willing to accept the possibility of substantial losses.Some
people do not perceive risk in that they have full conﬁdence in their expectations; it has been
suggested that a feature of stock market bubbles and crashes is that some people forget that
markets are uncertain and behave as if the direction of share price movements is known with
certainty.There are also people with narrow perceptions of risk; someone needing income from
investments may choose a bank (or building society) rather than shares and bonds in order to avoid
the risk of capital loss. Such a person may be insufﬁciently aware of the income risk from bank
deposits.Interest rates are variable with the effect that the income from a bank or building society
INTRODUCTION
11

deposit ﬂuctuates; possibly much more than the dividends from shares and deﬁnitely more than
the coupons from bonds.
Expenditure on investments is affected by both the ability and the willingness to save.The
former is affected by income,the latter by attitudes and circumstances.Many people are reluctant
to save, preferring to ignore their future ﬁnancial needs or assuming that others (e.g. future
taxpayers) will provide for them. Others give saving to meet future needs a high priority in their
use of income.
CONCLUSION
The population of the UK (and Western Europe and North America) is ageing. The ratio of
pensioners to people of working age is increasing.The ability of governments to provide adequate
pensions will diminish as the proportion of pensioners to taxpayers (who pay for state pensions)
rises. Raising the age at which pensions start to be paid is one part of the solution; in the UK the
pension age is being increased from 65 to 68. Increasing private pension provision is another
dimension of the solution.The achievement of an adequate pension requires that people save. It
also requires the investment of those savings in a form that produces a high rate of growth.History
indicates that investment in shares provides much higher returns, on average, than investment in
bank or building society accounts.
Financial systems provide means of investing for the purpose of accumulating wealth. Most
people who accumulate wealth for the purpose of funding retirement income do so through
institutional investments. In the UK pension funds are the largest institutional investments but
insurance funds,unit trusts,OEICs (Open-Ended Investment Companies),and investment trusts
are also important. Saving is essential to the provision of an adequate retirement income. If the
necessary level of saving is not carried out by an employer which provides an occupational pension,
people need to budget in order to save adequately.The average return on stock market investments
(i.e.shares) is much higher over time than the interest paid on bank and building society accounts.
Although from a short-term perspective shares may be seen as too risky, over long periods (such
as those relevant to pension saving) the growth potential of investment in shares dominates
considerations of risk.
The message thus far is that people need to save, and to invest much of that saving in the stock
market.This will probably be through institutional investments. Later chapters will show that
the charges on those institutional investments can heavily affect long-term wealth accumulation,
so that low cost investments such as index tracker funds have advantages. It will also be seen that
the process of investing requires people to be aware of,and compensate for,psychological biases.
It will also be shown that ﬁnancial derivatives (particularly futures and options), whilst risky on
their own, can be useful for risk reduction. The availability of reduced-risk stock market
investments should encourage those investors with a high aversion to risk to put their savings into
stock market investments.

Chapter 2
The psychology of personal
investment decisions
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide an understanding of:
1. The purposes and constraints of personal ﬁnancial decisions.
2. The characteristics of various investments, including their risks.
3. The management of risk.
4. The psychology of personal ﬁnancial decisions.
5. Differences in attitudes to saving.
CHOICE UNDER CONSTRAINT
When making personal investment decisions investors seek to achieve objectives whilst
taking account of their circumstances (which might be regarded as the constraints that they
face). Objectives would include obtaining a high rate of return on their investments and the
avoidance of substantial risk.Another objective might be the maintenance of adequate liquidity.
Another could be the receipt of a high and stable income without resort to selling or cashing in
investments.
Relevant circumstances (constraints) are many and varied. Table 2.1 lists some relevant
circumstances. This chapter will consider these objectives and circumstances in turn. First,
however, the impact of various personal characteristics and circumstances will be illustrated by
Table 2.2 in which a ‘’ indicates a favourable disposition towards a particular characteristic of
an investment and a ‘’ indicates an aversion to a feature of an investment instrument.
OBJECTIVES
The objective of a high rate of return is based on the view that it is better to have more money rather
than less.A high rate of return means that, when the investment is eventually sold or cashed in,
the sum of money received by the investor is relatively large.Return comprises both income yield
and capital gains.

The objective of liquidity relates to the speed and cost of turning an investment into cash.A
liquid asset is one that can be transformed into cash quickly and at little cost.An illiquid asset is
one that cannot be converted into cash quickly and which may require the investor to accept a low
price in order to ﬁnd a buyer for the asset.
Many investors depend on their investments to provide income. Although income could be
obtained by selling investments (maybe to cash in capital gains),there may be reasons for not doing
so. One reason may be the avoidance of the possibility that selling investments could jeopardise
future income receipts.‘Never touch the capital’is a rule of thumb that aims to preserve the source
of future income. Another reason might be that an investment is indivisible, for example the
ownership of a house for the purpose of obtaining rental income – it is not possible to part sell the
house to augment rental income.
TYPES OF RISK
Low risk is probably the most complex and multifaceted of the objectives.This is largely because
risk has many dimensions. It has been suggested that there are more than 20 forms of risk that an
investor may face. Some of the more important risks will be mentioned here.
Market risk is the risk that the value of an asset falls because of a generalised decline in asset prices.
For example the price of a share may fall as part of a general decline in the stock market.
Market risk is a form of capital risk. Capital risk is the risk of a reduction in the value of an
investment. Market risk is alternatively known as systematic, or non-diversiﬁable, risk.
Non-systematic risk is the risk that the value of an investment may fall as a result of factors speciﬁc
to that investment.For example the price of a company’s shares may fall because a competitor
begins to offer a superior product. Non-systematic risk is alternatively known as speciﬁc, or

diversiﬁable, risk. It is called diversiﬁable risk because a well-diversiﬁed portfolio of shares
should eliminate such risk (strong performances tending to offset weak ones).
An increase in interest rates tends to be accompanied by declines in asset prices.This relationship
is particularly reliable in the case of long-dated bonds.A bond is an investment that typically
pays the investor a constant sum (the interest or coupon) each year and then repays the original
investment on a maturity date. If interest rates on other investments rise, bonds become
relatively less attractive and their prices fall.The impact of interest rate changes increases
with the maturity (strictly speaking the duration) of a bond.This is a form of capital risk, which
is the risk that the value of an investment may fall.
Interest rate changes are also associated with income risk. Income risk is the risk that the income
receipts from an investment will fall.A long-dated bond has little income risk since the coupon
receipts are known with certainty until the maturity date of the bond. On the other hand a
bank or building society deposit has high income risk.As short-term interest rates ﬂuctuate
so too will the interest payments to investors.
A source of both capital and income risk on bonds is default risk.This is the risk that the issuer of
the bond fails to make coupon (interest) payments, or fails to repay the principal amount on
the maturity date of the bond.
A related risk is credit risk. Bonds are given credit ratings by credit rating agencies.The ratings are
intended to indicate the likelihood of default. If the credit rating of an issuer, or bond, is
reduced the market price of the bond will fall.
A form of both capital and income risk is inﬂation risk.This is the risk that general price inﬂation
erodes the purchasing power value of an investment and the income derived from that
investment.This is alternatively known as purchasing power risk.
Currency, or exchange rate, risk relates to investments denominated in foreign currencies. If the
currency in which the foreign investment is priced falls relative to the investor’s own currency,
the value of the investment and income from it will fall in terms of the investor’s own currency.
Political risk is the risk that governmental decisions will adversely impact on the value of investments
or the income from them.Since the income relevant to investors is after-tax income,changes
in tax rates are a form of political risk.
World-event risk is the risk of events impacting negatively on investments.The terrorist attacks of
11 September 2001 provide an example of such risk.
Liquidity risk is the risk that it becomes difﬁcult to liquidate an investment.If buyers for a particular
investment become scarce it may become difﬁcult to sell, at least without having to
substantially lower the selling price.
So risk is varied in nature.The objective of achieving low risk may need to address a large number
of different risks.
CONSTRAINTS
Some constraints arise from the attitudes of the investor. It is sometimes said that investors are
motivated by greed and fear.Greed relates to the desired rate of return and fear is concerned with
the level of risk.An investor who seeks a high rate of return and who is tolerant of risk will tend
to choose investments that offer high potential returns albeit at the cost of high risk. Conversely
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
16

an investor who is content with a modest rate of return whilst being intolerant of risk (i.e. highly
risk-averse) would choose investments that offer limited returns and relative certainty.
A factor that should affect risk tolerance/aversion is the age of an investor. Someone saving in
order to fund a retirement pension but with 40 years to retirement is in a position to accept risk.
There is scope for periods of good investment performance to compensate for poor periods,
furthermore there is time for the investor to retrieve investment failures by increasing the rate of
saving in the future. Someone with just a few years to retirement does not have these advantages
of a long investment horizon and needs to be more conservative in terms of investment strategy.
A number of individual circumstances interrelate.The factor of age is linked with the issues of
investment horizon and stage in the life cycle.The investment horizon is the period to the moment
at which investments will be liquidated to ﬁnance expenditure (for example expenditure on an
annuity to provide a retirement income).Short investment horizons allow little scope for accepting
risk. Retirement is not the only source of an investment horizon during a person’s lifetime.The
life cycle can produce other horizons such as the purchase of a house,for which a deposit may need
to be saved, or the ﬁnance of children’s education.
The amount, and nature, of existing assets should also inﬂuence investment decisions. An
investor whose wealth is already substantial will be better able to tolerate risk than someone who
has little existing wealth.The nature of the existing wealth also has signiﬁcance. Someone who
already has a large sum in a safe and liquid form is in a strong position to put new savings into
relatively risky and illiquid investments.The value of existing wealth, relative to needs, will also
have implications for the amount of saving that someone should aim for. If assets are already
considerable, little further saving and investment may be necessary.
The nature of existing wealth has implications for new investment since investors should bear
in mind the desirability of diversiﬁcation.If one’s existing wealth is primarily in residential property
then one should consider investing new wealth in assets such as bonds and shares.Someone whose
existing wealth is primarily in residential property should be aware that investing in more property,
perhaps in pursuit of rental income, provides high exposure to any downturn in property prices.
An investor should also give thought to whether new investments should be inﬂuenced by his/her
income from employment.Employment income may already provide exposure to the fortunes of
a business,investing in shares or bonds issued by that business would increase exposure to the risk
of that ﬁrm performing badly. More broadly, someone employed in a cyclical industry might be
well advised to invest outside that industry in order to avoid compounding the losses from a
downturn in that industry.
It is not only the amount and nature of existing assets that should be considered when allocating
savings. Liabilities should also be considered. Someone with large debts relative to wealth and
income may not be in a strong position to accept risk.In fact the ﬁrst priority for any surplus funds
is often reduction of debt.This is particularly so if the interest payable on the debt is high relative
to potential returns on investments.
Income should also inﬂuence investment decisions.It is not only the size of current income but
also potential future income, and the prospective stability of income, that has implications for
investment behaviour.Someone with low prospective income may use any investments as a means
of augmenting income. Such an investor should be income risk-averse.There should be little
tolerance for the risk of a falling investment income. The investor should therefore avoid
investments that have income risk.This entails avoidance of investments such as bank or building
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
17

society deposits since the interest from such investments is subject to considerable variation.The
investor should prefer investment in long-term bonds and in shares with high and stable dividend
payments. Similar considerations apply to people whose employment income is prospectively
unstable since they might look to investments as a source of stable income.
If someone can conﬁdently anticipate a rising future employment income that person could not
only reduce current saving but could also be willing to accept a relatively high risk on current
investments. High future income would allow the investor to compensate for current low saving
by increased future saving,and would give scope to replenish investments in the event of any losses
incurred as a result of accepting high risk.
Family responsibilities also impinge on ﬁnancial decision-making. An unattached person is
probably in a better position to take risks than someone with dependants. Legacies are also
signiﬁcant.Someone who is conﬁdent of inheriting a substantial sum of money before retirement
has less need to save, and can take more risks with investment choices. Someone wishing to
bequeath money has a greater need to save from current income.
Taxation can impact on investment decisions.For example people often have different tax rates
for income and for capital gains. Someone in a high income tax bracket but subject to low capital
gains tax would tend to prefer investments whose returns are in the form of capital gains rather
than interest or dividend payments. Such an investor might be inclined to a growth-oriented unit
trust rather than a building society account or bond fund.
It appears to be the case that interest rates contain a component to compensate for expected
inﬂation. For example if inﬂation of 2.5% p.a. is expected and a bank account offers 3.5% p.a.,
the real interest rate is expected to be 1% p.a. because 2.5% of the interest simply compensates
for the erosion of the value of money due to rising prices. However income tax is applied to the
whole of the interest, not just the real interest. At an income tax rate of 40% the 3.5% p.a. is
reduced to 2.1% p.a.A pre-tax positive real interest rate becomes a post-tax negative real interest
rate (minus 0.4% p.a.).The procedure of taxing the whole of an interest return rather than just
the real interest can cause investments to provide negative after-tax real returns.People with high
income tax rates but low capital gains tax rates might prefer investments that provide returns in
the form of capital gains, such as unit trusts that invest in shares, rather than investments that
provide returns in the form of interest, such as bonds and building society accounts.
Some constraints are self-imposed.For example many people take an ethical view when investing.
This may cause them to look for investment funds that adopt an ethical dimension.Such funds may
avoid investments in ﬁrms involved in tobacco,alcohol,gambling,or armaments.Human rights and
environmental records are also likely to be considered by funds that have an ethical dimension.
Many people may feel that they lack the expertise to make informed investment choices.An
analogy could be drawn with medical treatment. Many people would prefer that a doctor decide
on their appropriate treatment on the grounds that the doctor has much greater understanding of
the medical condition, and its treatments, than they do.Although increased choice is usually seen
as a good thing, it may not be if people lack the expertise to exercise the choice.
CHARACTERISTICS OF INVESTMENTS
It is worthwhile considering the characteristics of some forms of investment popular amongst
individuals.The most popular is probably the bank or building society deposit.On the upside these
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
18

are free of capital risk, offer an income yield, and are usually liquid. On the downside they lack
substantial growth potential, are subject to a high level of income risk, and have inﬂation risk.
Rental,or buy-to-let,property has become popular in recent years.Such investment has growth
potential and provides an income yield. On the downside it is illiquid and subject to both income
and capital risk.The income risk relates to the possibility that rents fall, or that a property fails to
attract tenants and remains unoccupied for long periods.The capital risk exists because property
prices can fall.
A third investment alternative is provided by equity unit trusts,which invest in a broad portfolio
of shares.These provide growth potential and are liquid. On the downside they are prone to both
capital and income risk.The income risk is such that no income yield may be forthcoming during
some periods.
A related investment possibility is provided by high income equity unit trusts.These differ
from other equity unit trusts in persistently providing an income yield, and probably with less
income risk.
A higher current level of income is normally available from bond unit trusts.These are liquid
with relatively low levels of income and capital risk. However they do not usually offer much
growth potential and are vulnerable to inﬂation risk.
HUMAN CAPITAL
One source of wealth that is often overlooked when considering personal ﬁnance is human capital.
Human capital is the present value of future employment earnings. It is enhanced by investment
in education and training.
An individual’s wealth can be classiﬁed into four categories:an investment portfolio (including
residential property as well as ﬁnancial assets), the present value of future state and occupational
pension receipts, the present value of expected legacies, and human capital. Especially for young
people,human capital may be the largest element in total wealth.These four sources of wealth are
employed to meet the individual’s objectives.The objective may merely be to maximise lifetime
consumption of goods and services, but there may be other objectives.
The preparation for retirement involves converting human capital into ﬁnancial wealth.
Proximity to retirement also inﬂuences the choice of the type of ﬁnancial wealth. Bonds provide
a constant stream of income with relatively little risk that the bond price will fall substantially or
that the income will not be received.It is usually recommended that as retirement approaches the
proportion of ﬁnancial wealth held in the form of bonds should increase.There are three reasons
for this.
First,a short period to retirement gives little opportunity to recover from the effects of a stock
market crash. Switching towards bonds provides some immunity against a crash. Someone who
has a long period to retirement can compensate for investment losses by saving more (possibly with
the aid of working more) during the remaining period to retirement.Someone close to retirement
does not have this facility to the same extent.(The facility of choosing to save more could be seen
as an option that hedges, i.e. provides protection, against investment losses.)
Second, short of a stock market crash there is a risk of some decline in share prices.The value
of equity (share) investments tends to increase more than proportionately to the passage of time
(due to compound returns) whereas the risk (measured by the dispersion of possible values)
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
19

increases less than proportionately to the passage of time.This renders shares more suitable as
long-term investments and less suitable as a preparation for imminent retirement.
A third reason for switching towards bonds over time relates to the nature of human capital.
For most people human capital behaves like bonds in that it provides a fairly constant and regular
stream of income. Human capital declines as the remaining working life declines.The passage of
time reduces a bond-like form of capital (human capital) and it appears to be appropriate to replace
it with bonds on the grounds that they have similar characteristics.
Van Eaton and Conover (2002) drew the implication that,since human capital is relatively low
risk, investors whose assets are predominantly in the form of human capital should hold 100% of
their ﬁnancial assets in the relatively high risk form of shares. Later in life as human capital has
declined, and equity (share) holdings have increased, the risk level of the total portfolio will be
higher.At that stage some switching from shares to bonds would be appropriate in order to keep
portfolio risk within acceptable limits.This reasoning justiﬁes the common advice that investors,
as they grow older, should switch from equities to bonds.
Human capital is subject to mortality risk since death eliminates human capital. From the
perspective of the family,the death of an income-earner is a ﬁnancial loss as well as a personal loss.
Human capital can be insured by the purchase of life assurance.In the event of death the loss of human
capital is offset by the receipt of an insurance payment.Life assurance is not the only way of obtaining
protection against the death of an income-earner.Chapter 13 on portfolio diversiﬁcation develops
the theme of holding a diversiﬁed portfolio of assets as a means of obtaining protection from the
consequences of the loss of one asset. A portfolio of other assets (shares, bonds, mutual funds,
investment properties,etc.) provides a source of income for the family in the event of the death of
an income-earner.Portfolio construction and life assurance are alternative means of managing the
mortality risk of human capital.Conventionally decisions relating to investment portfolios and life
assurance are taken separately but Chen, Ibbotson et al. (2006) argue that portfolio decisions and
life assurance decisions should be taken jointly since they are alternative means of managing the
mortality risk of human capital.
RISK MANAGEMENT
All ﬁnancial decisions are inﬂuenced by the risks faced and the approach taken to management of
those risks. Individuals and households face a number of risks and effective decision-making
requires that those risks be recognised.
Risk may be regarded as uncertainty that matters (an alternative deﬁnition of risk is uncertainty
that can be measured).Our experience provides us with a vast number of uncertainties,but many
of them do not matter to us.The result of a football match is uncertain but if it is of no interest to
a person then it is not a risk for that person. House prices are uncertain and to a potential house
buyer that uncertainty is important; it is therefore a source of risk.
Risks facing individuals and households can be divided into six types.
1.
Sickness, disability, and death.
2.
Unemployment.
3.
Housing. Property is vulnerable to events such as ﬁre and a decline in market value.
4.
Consumer durable risk. For example cars are vulnerable to theft or accidental damage.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
20

5.
Liability risk.This is the risk that others may have a ﬁnancial claim against you because they
suffer a loss for which you could be held responsible,e.g.causing injury in a road accident or
being sued for negligence.
6.
Financial asset risk.The risk that the value of investments,or the income from them,may fall.
Many decisions, not just those that are speciﬁcally risk management decisions, will be inﬂuenced
by these risks.However a person may fail to identify some of the risks and hence fail to take account
of them.Approaches to decisions that speciﬁcally relate to risk management may be divided into
four categories.
1.
Risk avoidance. For example one way to manage stock market risk is to refrain from
investment in the stock market.
2.
Risk reduction.This is concerned with reducing the likelihood or severity of losses. For
example if stock market investment is through a well-diversiﬁed portfolio (perhaps by means
of a unit trust) the risk is reduced relative to an investment in a small number of stocks.
3.
Risk retention.This is a decision to accept risk and bear any losses that may arise.
4.
Risk transfer.This entails passing the risk to another person or organisation. For example a
property owner may insure against ﬁre.At the cost of the insurance premium,the risk of loss
through ﬁre is transferred to the insurance company.
In relation to investment (ﬁnancial asset) risk,investors could see risk in relation to three possible
benchmarks.One benchmark is zero;an investor may primarily be concerned with the possibility
of a return below zero, a loss in absolute terms. Another possible benchmark relates to an
alternative investment, for example performance relative to a stock index such as the FTSE 100;
underperformance may be regarded as an opportunity loss. A third benchmark could be a
predetermined personal goal; underperformance indicates that personal ﬁnancial planning is not
proceeding in line with expectations.
Risk means different things to different people. Investment decisions are often taken in
consultation with a ﬁnancial adviser. However what the adviser understands by risk may differ
from what the client understands by risk. Diacon (2004) found that advisers were less fearful of
losses (less loss-averse) than investors, and less likely to see ﬁnancial services products as
complicated. He also found that advisers were more willing to trust the providers of ﬁnancial
products and to trust regulators.
Experts tend to think of risk as objective and measurable, and to have a narrow deﬁnition of
risk. Individual investors are more likely to have a subjective and multidimensional view of risk.
The risk perceptions of individual investors may be widely shared as a result of social interaction.
Non-experts may demand certainty of expectations, which experts know cannot be provided.
Uncertainty of expectation could be frustrating for the clients of advisers.The differing perceptions
of risk, between adviser and client, could be responsible for some of the mis-selling claims in the
UK during the 1990s and 2000s.The adviser may not fully communicate the potential range of
variability of investment outcomes, possibly because of a failure to understand the extent of a
client’s misunderstanding of risk.Diacon suggested that it might be useful to include consideration
of risk perception and behavioural ﬁnance in the training of ﬁnancial advisers (behavioural ﬁnance
is the application of psychology to the understanding of ﬁnancial decision-making).
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
21

Among non-experts risk is perceived as greater if the person lacks information about,or control
over,outcomes.Lack of information and control in regard to investment outcomes leads to mistrust
of providers of ﬁnancial services and mistrust of ﬁnancial advisers (Sjoberg 2001).The mistrust of
ﬁnancial advisers may be based on a perceived afﬁliation bias whereby advisers are seen as being
too trusting of the providers of ﬁnancial services.Also experts tend to think in terms of an average
consumer, whereas individuals are concerned speciﬁcally with their own case.
Filbeck et al. (2005) examined the relationship between personality type and attitude to risk.
Personality types were classiﬁed according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which uses four
dimensions.
1.
Extroversion versus introversion. Extroverts focus their attention on other people whereas
introverts are inwardly focused.
2.
Sensing versus intuition. Sensing people tend to focus on facts whereas the intuition group
are more concerned with abstract ideas.
3.
Thinking versus feeling.The thinking group attempt to be objective and logical in their
decision-making. Feeling people are subjective decision-makers.
4.
Judging versus perceiving. Judging individuals lead organised, and orderly, lives. Perceiving
people lead ﬂexible and spontaneous lives.
They found that extroversion versus introversion had no bearing on attitude to risk. Sensing
individuals were more tolerant of risk than the intuition people.Thinking people were more
tolerant of risk than feeling people.Individuals with a preference for judging were able to tolerate
more risk than those with a preference for perceiving.
The management of risk is based on an investor’s attitude to risk.An investor who is tolerant
of risk would accept levels of risk that would be deemed unacceptable by someone with a strong
aversion to risk.Attitudes towards risk vary considerably between people. Grable et al. (2004)
found that men were more tolerant of risk than women.They also found that people with high
incomes were more willing to accept risk than those on low incomes.Hallahan et al.(2004) found
that risk tolerance is greater for men, young people, well-educated people, those on higher
incomes, those with higher wealth, and single people.
It is common for ﬁnancial advisers to measure attitude towards risk, typically using a set of
questions, before providing advice to a client. However another factor identiﬁed by Grable et al.
(2004) throws the usefulness of such risk measures into doubt.They found that recent stock market
performance inﬂuenced attitudes to risk;a ﬁnding conﬁrmed by Yao et al. (2004).A recent rise in
share prices makes people more tolerant of risk whereas a recent fall causes them to be more
averse to risk.The consequence is that attitudes to risk change over time and that measurement of
attitude to risk at a single point in time may produce an unrepresentative result.
Exhibit 2.1 indicates possible differences between ﬁnancial advisers and their clients in relation
to the perception of risk.This draws on psychological factors discussed in this chapter, and in
Chapter 24 on noise trading and behavioural ﬁnance. Differences in the perception of risk can
cause communication failures between advisers and their clients.Advisers may give what they see
as good advice,when the advice is viewed in the light of their own perceptions.The clients interpret
what they hear in the light of their perceptions, and their interpretations could differ from those
of the advisers.In consequence clients may feel that they were misled (mis-sold),whilst the advisers
believe that their advice was good.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL FINANCE
Many retail investments are stock market related.These include pension funds, Individual
Savings Accounts (ISAs),unit trusts,and investment bonds.It is desirable that decisions relating
to stock market related investments should be made rationally.
Psychological research has indicated that there are biases in decision-making.These biases
have implications for the decisions as to whether to invest in stock market related products,
the extent of such investment, and the nature of the investments.The biases could cause
investors to make poor decisions; or ﬁnancial advisers to give poor advice. If investors
understand the psychological biases to which they may be prone, they may be able to
compensate for them when making investment decisions. If a ﬁnancial adviser knows the
psychological biases that affect clients,the adviser can try to offset those biases by appropriate
information and advice. Whilst a ﬁnancial adviser should discover and accept a client’s

preferences,the adviser should attempt to dispel misperceptions and misjudgements that arise from
the client’s psychological biases.Simultaneously advisers should guard against the biases to which
they themselves may be prone.
Psychological research has found a number of systematic biases that affect investors.These
include: overconﬁdence, hindsight bias, representativeness, conservatism, narrow framing,
retrievability, and ambiguity-aversion. In addition social inﬂuences and moods (emotions) affect
investment decisions.All of these biases interfere with the process of rational decision-making.
Psychological factors can be divided into self-deception,heuristic simpliﬁcation,social inﬂuence,
and emotions (Hirshleifer 2001). Some psychological inﬂuences may belong to more than one of
these categories.
Self-deception
Self-deception is the process whereby people exaggerate their abilities. People tend to think that
they are better than they really are. One psychological bias is overconﬁdence. Overconﬁdence
arises partly from self-attribution bias.This is a tendency on the part of investors to regard successes
as arising from their expertise whilst failures are due to bad luck or the actions of others.This leads
to excessive conﬁdence in one’s own powers of forecasting.It is capable of explaining a number of
types of apparently irrational behaviour.For example it can explain why some investors hold poorly
diversiﬁed portfolios.If investors are highly conﬁdent about their selection abilities,they will not
feel the need to reduce risk by means of diversiﬁcation. It could also explain why some investors
trade very frequently,to the point where transaction costs cause their investment behaviour to be
loss making. Overconﬁdence can explain why some investors churn their portfolios; that is
persistently sell and buy.This behaviour entails a new set of initial charges each time with the effect
that the investors lose.This churning may be recommended by overconﬁdent ﬁnancial advisers
(who incidentally receive a new set of commission payments each time the churning occurs).
Odean (1998a) has shown that one of the effects of overconﬁdence is that turnover of
investments tends to be high,that is people trade shares more as a result of overconﬁdence.Statman
et al.(2006) found that trading volumes rose when stock prices had recently risen,which was seen
as consistent with the overconﬁdence bias;overconﬁdent investors trade more frequently following
market gains since they mistakenly attribute their gains to their investment skills.Barber and Odean
(2000) have shown that as turnover rises net proﬁts tend to fall.Psychological research has found
that men tend to be more overconﬁdent than women.Barber and Odean (2001a) found that single
men trade 67% more than single women. Correspondingly single men on average experienced
investment returns 3.5% per year lower than single women.
The hindsight bias is similar to the overconﬁdence bias except that it relates to evaluations of
the past rather than the future. Fischhoff (1982) explains that with the hindsight bias people
consistently exaggerate what could have been anticipated.People tend to view what has happened
as having been inevitable, and see it as having been predictable before it happened. People even
misremember their own predictions; memory is fallible. Azar (2000) suggested that if people
cannot remember their original judgement, they will reconstruct the recollection of the original
judgement in the light of subsequent information.‘I knew that would happen’ and ‘I knew it all
along’ are statements that characterise the hindsight bias.The hindsight bias is the inability to
correctly remember one’s prior expectations after observing new information.The hindsight bias
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
24

prevents people learning from their own mistakes, since they are unable to remember those
mistakes. People are unable to recognise their own errors.There is self-denial about past errors.
If someone has a self-image of being a clever investor, past errors in forecasting may be subject to
distortions of memory aimed at maintaining the self-image.Memory is never a faithful recollection
of the past; it is amended by the human mind.
Good decision-making in ﬁnancial markets relies on learning from the past.Learning may entail
the comparison of new information with previous expectations.This requires an accurate recall
of previous expectations. The hindsight bias involves the contamination of recollections of
expectations by new information.The recalled expectations of an outcome are biased towards
information about the outcome.The person remembers forming an expectation that is close to
what subsequently happened.
Another psychological bias, which is related to overconﬁdence, is referred to as optimism or
as self-enhancement bias.Most people believe that they are above average.Researchers have found
that this belief relates to choosing investments, academic performance, and driving ability.
To the extent that some investors attribute proﬁts from rising markets to their own talents,rising
markets could be self-perpetuating.Overconﬁdent investors may be encouraged to invest further
and thereby reinforce an upward movement in stock prices. Conversely a falling market reduces
conﬁdence and investing.This is consistent with the view that markets exhibit overreaction; they
rise too high and fall too low (known as the overreaction hypothesis). It also helps to explain why
small investors tend to buy following market rises, and sell following falls.
Another bias based on optimism is the outcome bias,which causes people to expect to get what
they want. Decisions are made in the expectation that what is wanted to happen will happen; in
other words, wishful thinking.An investor may expect a high return on an investment because a
high return is what is wanted.This could generate overconﬁdence and an underestimation of risk.
Overconﬁdence could be based on excessive belief in one’s own talents or on the belief that events
will turn out to be favourable. In both cases the investor may underestimate risk when making
investment decisions.
Some other biases have similarities with the concept of overconﬁdence. As a result of the
conﬁrmation bias investors pay more attention to evidence that supports their opinions than to
evidence that contradicts them.This can bolster overconﬁdence and cause investors to persist with
inappropriate investment strategies. Another cognitive bias is the illusion of control. In some
circumstances people behave as if they were able to exert control where this is impossible or
unlikely.The illusion of control,together with overconﬁdence,may explain why so many investors
choose actively managed funds when tracker funds outperform them and have lower charges.A
study by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of academic studies
which found that the relative past performance of actively managed funds is no indicator of future
relative performance.It may be that overconﬁdence in their own selection abilities,and the illusion
of control provided by the facility of choosing between funds, cause investors (or their ﬁnancial
advisers) to select actively managed funds when tracker funds offer better potential value. (Of
course ﬁnancial advisers might be inﬂuenced by the fact that actively managed funds typically pay
higher commissions.)
According to Langer (1975), people often ﬁnd it difﬁcult to accept that outcomes may be
random. Langer distinguishes between chance events and skill events. Skill events entail a causal
link between behaviour and the outcome. In the case of chance events, the outcome is random.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
25

People often see chance events as skill events.When faced with randomness, people frequently
behave as if the event were controllable.If people engage in skill behaviour,such as making choices,
their belief in the controllability of a random event appears to become stronger. There is
considerable evidence that investment managers are unable to consistently outperform stock
markets.This suggests that the outcome of investment management is random.However since the
investment managers engage in skill behaviour, analysis, and choice, they tend to see portfolio
performance as controllable. Retail investors and ﬁnancial advisers are also likely to see the
performance of their investment choices as controllable;the act of choosing enhances the illusion
of control.
Self-deception is increased by the distorting effects of memory. Memory is not a factual
recording of past events. Memories are inﬂuenced by many personality and emotional factors.To
some extent people remember what they want to remember.Inaccurate memories can lead to poor
decisions. Goetzmann and Peles (1997) and Moore et al. (1999) investigated the recollections of
investors.They found that investor memory of the past performance of their investments was
better than the actual performance of those investments.People tend to have a self-image of being
good investors and want to believe that their investment decisions have been good.The mind
perceives the past in such a way as to be consistent with the self-image. The mind feels
uncomfortable with information that contradicts the self-image. This is known as cognitive
dissonance.The mind will adjust memory in order to reduce cognitive dissonance and maintain
the positive self-image.
It is not just memory that adjusts in order to maintain a positive self-image.Planning might be
adjusted. For example a young person with a self-image of being ﬁt and attractive might avoid
saving for a pension since the idea of retirement produces a self-image of being old in the future.
Heuristic Simpliﬁcation
Heuristic simpliﬁcation arises from the limitations of people’s cognitive powers (such as memory
and thought).It involves the process of using short cuts to deal with complex decisions.Rules-of-
thumb are examples of heuristic simpliﬁcation. Such short cuts can produce a tainted perception
of the situation being thought about.
Representativeness helps to explain why many investors seem to extrapolate price movements.
Many investors appear to believe that if prices have been rising in the past then they will continue
to rise, and conversely with falling prices.The concept of representativeness suggests that this is
because those investors see an investment with recent price increases as representative of longer-
term successful investments, and conversely with price falls.
Another result of representativeness is a tendency to assume that good companies are good
investments. Good ﬁrms are often seen as representing good investments.The issue of whether a
share is a good investment depends upon whether it is over-, under-, or fairly priced. Shares of
a good company may be overpriced, and hence would not represent a good investment. Shares
of a weak company may be underpriced,and hence are attractive as an investment.An example of
this error was the enthusiasm for the ‘nifty-ﬁfty’stocks (actually 76 stocks) in the United States in
the early 1970s.The ﬁrms were seen as so good that their shares were considered to be a good buy
at any price (Fesenmaier and Smith 2002).The demand pushed the stock prices up to unrealistic
levels.Subsequently,as the mispricing was gradually corrected,the nifty-ﬁfty stock prices showed
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
26

relative declines and most of them underperformed the market over the following decades (Wal-
Mart was an exception).
The ﬁndings of Cooper et al.(2001) can be interpreted as evidence of representativeness.They
investigated companies that added ‘.com’ or ‘.net’ to their names between June 1998 and July
1999 (a period during which the Internet stock bubble was developing).They found that those
companies provided an average return,between 15 days before the name change to 15 days after,
that was 142% above that of similar companies.For the companies whose business had no relation
to the Internet, the ﬁgure was 203%. It would appear that investors saw companies with .com or
.net in their names as representative of potentially highly successful companies. Cooper et al.
(2005) found that mutual funds (unit trusts) can increase the ﬂow of investment funds from retail
investors by changing their names to something that reﬂects recently successful investment styles.
The effects of representativeness on thinking and decision-making can be illustrated by the
following example.A man has recently been convicted.You are told that he is aggressive, short-
tempered, and has a history of violence.You are asked to guess whether his conviction was for
murder or speeding. It is likely that many people would guess murder. This is because the
description ﬁts the popular image,or stereotype,of a murderer.The man is seen as representative
of murderers. However, since speeding convictions vastly outnumber murder convictions, it is
much more likely that the conviction was for speeding.
Next consider a coin being tossed ﬁve times. If there were ﬁve heads would you take the view
that the coin is biased? Many people might take that view since a run of ﬁve heads would be seen
as representative of biased coins. Five successive heads does not ﬁt the image or stereotype of
randomness.However there is a 3.125% chance that an unbiased coin would produce a run of ﬁve
heads. Since the number of unbiased coins is vastly greater than the number of biased coins, it is
much more likely that the coin is an unbiased one that has produced ﬁve heads purely by chance.
Next consider a unit trust that has beaten the average performance of similar trusts in ﬁve
successive years. Do you consider the fund manager to have investment skills that are superior to
the average? Bearing in mind the wealth of evidence that past performance is no guide to future
performance,and that relative performance in successive years appears to be random,perhaps the
appropriate conclusion is that the run of ﬁve successive good years has occurred by chance.
However,many people are likely to conclude that the fund manager has superior investment skills.
There is evidence that a run of successes tends to attract a lot of investors to a unit trust.A unit
trust with a recent run of success is seen as representative of long-term strong performers.
The concept of conservatism suggests that investors are slow to change their views following
the receipt of new information.This may help to explain why small investors often delay investing
until the market has risen for a period of time. It has been observed that small investors often
invest just before the market peaks, and sell just before it troughs.
A concept related to conservatism is anchoring. People are heavily inﬂuenced by past, or
suggested, prices when forming judgements about appropriate prices.The past, or suggested,
price acts as an anchor that becomes the basis for forming a judgement.This applies to various
markets, not just stock markets. For example Northcraft and Neale (1987) have shown that
anchoring operates in the housing market.They took two groups of estate agents to a house. One
group were told that the asking price was $119,900 and the second group were told $149,900.
When asked to give their own valuations the ﬁrst group averaged $117,745 and the second averaged
$130,981.This suggests that the best strategy when selling a property is to set the asking price at
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
27

the top of the range of possibilities (and when buying a newly constructed property it is probably
safe to assume that the house builder has done the same).
Professional analysts, such as stockbrokers, appear to be subject to anchoring. It might be
thought that if an analyst suggests an appropriate price for a share and the share price subsequently
moves away from that level,an investor would see a trading opportunity.For example a fall in the
share price below the analyst’s forecast should indicate a buying opportunity. Unfortunately for
the private investor, the effect of the share price move seems to be that the analyst moves the
forecast in the same direction as the share price.Cornell (2000) demonstrated this effect in relation
to Intel.Those results were consistent with studies by Womack (1996) and Brav and Lehavy (2001)
whose ﬁndings showed that adjustments subsequent to analysts’ forecasts took the form of the
forecasts being changed towards actual prices rather than actual share prices moving towards the
forecasts.
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) suggested the existence of a status quo bias (alternatively
known as an endowment bias). People have a tendency to hold the investments they already have
and exhibit some reluctance to change them.Status quo bias appears to increase as the number of
investment options increases.The more complicated the investment decision, the greater the
likelihood that the investor chooses to change nothing. Kempf and Ruenzi (2006) conﬁrmed this
ﬁnding.They found that when choosing a mutual fund (unit trust), individuals tended to choose
one that they had chosen previously.This tendency to repeat choices was found to strengthen as
the amount of choice increased.
Lin et al. (2006) found that the strength of the endowment effect (status quo bias) depended
on the emotional state of the investor.They found that the endowment bias only occurred when
people felt happy,and it was absent when they felt sad.Lerner et al. (2004) found that two negative
emotions,sadness and disgust,had opposing effects on the endowment bias.Disgust enhanced the
endowment effect, whereas sadness reduced it.These studies indicated that emotion and mood
could affect cognitive biases and hence decisions.
Narrow framing refers to the tendency of investors to focus too narrowly. One aspect is focus
on the constituents of a portfolio rather than the portfolio as a whole.Since individual investments
tend to be more volatile than the investor’s portfolio as a whole, such narrow framing causes
investors to overestimate price volatility.This could cause people to invest too little.
Another dimension of narrow framing is the focus on the short term even when the investment
horizon is long term. It is not rational for an investor accumulating assets for retirement 25 years
hence to be concerned about the week-to-week performance of the portfolio.Yet long-term
investors do focus on short-term volatility. Studies have shown that when, in experimental
situations, people have been presented with monthly distributions of returns they are less likely
to invest than when they are shown annual distributions (with the annualised volatility being the
same in both cases).The implication is that focus on short-term volatility deters investment. It
appears that people do not appreciate the effects of time diversiﬁcation. By time diversiﬁcation is
meant the tendency for good periods to offset bad periods with the effect that the dispersion of
investment returns does not increase proportionately with the period of the investment.Investors
who focus too much on short-term ﬂuctuations overestimate stock market risk and allocate too
little of their money to stock market investment.
Another bias is retrievability (alternatively known as availability), which suggests that more
attention is given to the most easily recalled information. Retrievability is consistent with the
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
28

overreaction hypothesis, one dimension of which is the overemphasis on recent information and
recent events when making investment decisions.
In terms of investments,one source of information is press coverage.If retrievability operates,
stocks that receive (favourable) press coverage are relatively likely to be bought in large numbers
and hence more likely to be overpriced.Gadarowski (2001) conﬁrmed this by demonstrating that
shares with extensive press coverage subsequently performed poorly (there was a relative decline
from excessively high prices). Katona (1975) indicated that what the media reports could have
considerable inﬂuence on social learning.The behaviour of large segments of population can change
suddenly in response to news. Retrievability can also lead people to the belief that investment
skills are more common than they actually are. Press coverage of successful fund managers such
as Warren Buffett and George Soros greatly exceeds press coverage of poor managers. In
consequence the retrievability of such coverage can result in the impression that many investment
managers are capable of outperforming stock markets.
Ambiguity-aversion (alternatively known as familiarity bias) suggests that investors prefer to
invest in companies that they feel they understand.Over 90% of the equity investments of investors
in the United States, UK, and Japan is in companies in their own countries.This home bias exists
despite the demonstrated beneﬁts of international diversiﬁcation.The preference for the familiar
results in the holding of portfolios that are insufﬁciently diversiﬁed.In consequence investors bear
more risk than is necessary.
Related to ambiguity-aversion (familiarity bias) are ﬁndings that investors may be affected by
the image of a company or sector. For example pharmaceutical companies may have an image of
‘health and beauty’ whereas chemicals companies might have an image of ‘dirty and polluting’.
MacGregor et al.(2000) showed that image affected investment decision-making.They found that
a positive image enhanced judgements of recent performance,expectations of future performance,
and the willingness to invest.
Ambiguity-aversion suggests that increased knowledge (or the feeling of increased knowledge)
about an asset renders investors more prepared to invest in it. Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found
that people are more willing to invest in a stock when an explicit distribution of potential outcomes
is provided.This could also be seen as an example of frame dependence,which means that decisions
are affected by the way in which the choices are presented. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) found
that an individual may reject an investment when it is presented in terms of risks surrounding
gains but may accept when the presentation is in terms of risks relating to losses.
Frame dependence can be illustrated by a coin-tossing choice. One option is that there
is a prize of £100 for tails.The other option is a gift of £100, which is contingent on a coin toss
such that heads would entail the loss of the £100. In both cases tails provides £100 and heads
provides nothing. However people are more likely to choose the second option. People are more
willing to take a bet when it is expressed in terms of losses than when it is presented in terms
of gains.
In relation to investment decisions, it has been found that the way information is framed
will inﬂuence choices. For example different stock indices can change at different rates.At the
time of writing, the FTSE All-Share Index has risen substantially more than the FTSE 100 Index
over recent years. If the performance of a fund is presented in relation to the FTSE 100, it would
appear to be much more impressive than if its performance is presented relative to that of the
FTSE All-Share Index.As another example it has been found that if stock market returns averaged
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
29

over 30 years are presented, people are more likely to invest than if 30 single year returns are
presented. Many single year returns are negative, but no 30-year period has yielded negative
returns.
Diacon and Hasseldine (2007) investigated framing effects and found that the presentation
format of prior performance affected investment fund choice.They found that presenting past
information in terms of fund values as opposed to percentage yields signiﬁcantly affected
investment choices.The alternatives were charts one of which showed the accumulated growth in
the value of a fund over time relative to a base value,such as 100,and the other showed a series of
vertical lines indicating the growth in each year.The charts of cumulative value growth evoked
considerably more positive response than series of growth rates.The presentation of a series of
vertical lines indicating annual growth rates produced perceptions of greater risk.
Choice bracketing could be deﬁned as ‘a series of local choices that each appear to be
advantageous but which collectively lead to a bad global outcome’(Read et al.1999:172).People
are seen as making appropriate decisions within narrow frames but, when these decisions are
aggregated, the overall outcome is not the best possible. For example if each new investment is
made without regard to the overall portfolio, whilst each investment seen in isolation may seem
rational,the resulting portfolio may be unbalanced and poorly diversiﬁed.Another example relates
to investment horizons. If an investor uses a short horizon, such as one month, for evaluating the
risk-return characteristics of investments the resulting portfolio may not be the best from a longer-
term perspective. Evaluating investments on a month-by-month basis may lead to the choice of
bank deposits in order to avoid the high short-term volatility of stock market investments.However
if the objective is to accumulate a pension fund over 35 years,bank deposits would be a poor choice
since they provide a low long-term return compared to stock market investments.The investor
should consider the risk-return characteristics of investments from a 35-year perspective, not
from a one-month perspective.
Mental accounting is the process of separating ﬁnancial decisions rather than seeing
them in aggregate (Thaler 1985). Someone who simultaneously has a bank deposit with a
low interest rate and a debt at a high interest rate exhibits mental accounting. Perhaps the
bank deposit is regarded as saving for the deposit on a house, and the debt was incurred for the
purchase of a car. By separating the two ﬁnancial decisions the person is losing money. It would
have been better to ﬁnance the car purchase by taking money (i.e. borrowing) from the house
deposit money and then making repayments into that bank account.There would have been a net
saving of interest.
Mental accounting can be similar to choice bracketing in its effects. Someone may have a
portfolio of investments but allocate investments to various mental accounts.This leads to a focus
on components of the portfolio rather than the whole portfolio. For example a person may have
investments in a pension fund and simultaneously hold investments in ISAs. In order to achieve a
well-diversiﬁed portfolio of investments, the person should take account of the nature of the
pension fund investments when deciding upon the ISA investments.If the pension money is invested
in a UK growth fund, it may be appropriate to invest the ISA money in a different fund.
Diversiﬁcation reduces dependence upon one fund,or type of fund,and hence reduces the potential
effect of relative underperformance on the person’s total wealth.The investor should see the
investments in aggregate rather than allocate them to mental accounts,which are then considered
in isolation.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS

This goes beyond ﬁnancial portfolios.Three major forms of wealth are ﬁnancial assets,residential
property,and human capital (i.e.future earnings).These three should be seen in aggregate rather
than allocated to three mental accounts.For example holding one’s ﬁnancial wealth in the form of
shares of the company for which one works produces an excessive dependence upon the success
of that company. When deciding on ﬁnancial assets the nature of the other assets should be
considered.Financial investing should not be seen in isolation from the other assets,that is it should
not be put into a separate mental account.Since shares tend to have returns unrelated to those from
property and human capital, they should have a place in a well-diversiﬁed portfolio. Shares may
provide good returns at times when property and human capital are underperforming. In the
context of the overall portfolio shares may reduce risk (see Chapter 13).The tendency of people
to put them into a separate mental account leads to an exaggeration of their risk.This may help to
explain why so many people are reluctant to invest in the stock market (Barberis et al. 2003).
Mental accounting helps to explain the preference for high dividend yield shares on the part of
many investors (Statman 1997). Some investors take a ‘never touch the capital’ approach when
investing for income. Capital growth could be converted into income by selling shares, but this is
not allowed by the mindset.Although cashing in on capital growth by share sales is an alternative
source of income to dividends, the investor feels that it would be reducing the capital.The only
acceptable source of income comes from dividends.This separation of dividends and capital is a
manifestation of mental accounting.
Mental accounting can be used to produce examples of frame dependence. Consider the offer
of a bet in which £15 is received from a coin toss that is heads,against a loss of £10 with tails.Also
consider the offer of a bet in which if heads results you keep all the money you have already plus
£15,whereas with tails you keep all your money except £10.People tend to prefer the second bet
despite the bets being identical.In the second bet the offer is framed in such a way that it removes
mental accounting.The bet, seen in isolation, is less attractive than when it is seen in the context
of the person’s existing wealth.
Hedesstrom et al. (2004, 2007) studied the use of heuristics in the context of the Swedish
Premium Pension Scheme,which is a compulsory pension scheme allowing subscribers to choose
between a large number of funds. If a participant failed to express a preference, their funds were
invested in a default fund.The study identiﬁed some heuristics and also investigated whether the
amount of interest (involvement) shown by participants affected the use of heuristics.The heuristics
found to be operating included a default bias, which is the tendency to choose the default fund.
This could reﬂect a view that the default fund was the fund recommended by the pension plan
managers.There was a tendency to avoid funds with either extremely high or extremely low risk;
referred to as extremeness aversion. Another heuristic was a tendency to choose own-country
funds (familiarity bias,ambiguity-aversion).Also there was a tendency to divide investments evenly
between the chosen funds;known as the 1/N bias on the grounds that 1/N is allocated to each of
the N chosen funds.
Hedesstrom et al. considered the possibility that the use of heuristics was related to the level
of investor motivation. It could be the case that participants showing little or no interest
(involvement) in the investment choice are more likely to demonstrate the use of heuristics than
more motivated investors.Although those showing high involvement were less prone to the default
bias, they were no less susceptible to other heuristics such as the familiarity bias and the 1/N
heuristic.

The Catering Theory of Dividends
According to the catering theory of dividends (Baker and Wurgler 2004) investors have a desire
for dividends,and that the resulting demand for dividends varies over time.In consequence there
will be times when the prices of dividend paying shares will be bid up relative to the prices of non-
dividend paying shares. Companies will adjust their dividend policies in response to this time-
varying demand for dividends. Firms initiate (or withdraw from) payment of dividends when
investors have a particularly strong (or weak) demand for dividends. Periods of high demand for
dividends are accompanied by increased dividend payouts.
Gemmill (2006) provided support for the catering theory of dividends using evidence from
split-capital investment trusts in the UK.He observed that over the period 1998–2001 split-capital
funds traded at a 9% premium (were worth 9% more) relative to conventional investment trusts.
He found that this arose from an increase in the demand for dividends on the part of retail investors.
He also observed that there was a large increase in the number of such funds issued during that
period.The increase in new issues was interpreted as a response to a demand for high dividend
investments.
Unlike conventional investment trusts,split-capital investment trusts can provide high dividend
investments by splitting themselves into different classes of share.One such class is the income (or
dividend) share, which pays all the dividends earned by the fund but at the cost of foregoing
potential capital gains from share price rises. Gemmill suggested that the rising stock market at
the time had reduced the rate of dividend yield (the dividend yield is the dividend divided by the
share price, so a rise in the share price reduces the dividend yield). In search of dividends some
investors turned to split-capital investment trusts. Gemmill noted that at the time investment
trust advertising emphasised yield.
It may be that the ‘never touch the capital’ attitude of some retail investors makes dividends a
salient feature which is valued.This can lead to high prices for investments that offer high dividend
payments.
The Social Dimension
In addition to personal biases there are biases that result from social inﬂuences. Schachter et al.
(1986) related the degree to which a person is dependent on what others think and do to a number
of factors.Social inﬂuence is strongest in conditions of uncertainty and when self-conﬁdence is low.
It is also strong when circumstances change substantially,and rises with the extent that previously
held views are demonstrated to be incorrect.Asch (1952) conducted experiments that showed that
people were inclined to follow others even when they felt that the others were wrong; he called
this ‘conformity’.
Hong et al. (2004) found that social households in the United States were more likely to
invest in the stock market than non-social households. A social household is one in which
the members interact with other people in the neighbourhood. Information is obtained
and opinions are formed through talking with others. In consequence social people are more
likely to become interested in, and learn about, investing than less socially active people. Shiller
and Pound (1989) found that when an investor pays attention to a stock it is often (more
than 50% of cases) because another person has mentioned the stock to the individual.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
32

Subsequent to buying the stock, the investor is likely to speak about it to a number of other
people.
Duﬂo and Saez (2002) investigated pension scheme participation in the United States.They
suggested that the decision to participate was strongly inﬂuenced by the social norms of peer
groups.People in a peer group tend to develop the same attitudes as other members of the group.
The group studied was very homogeneous in most respects (they were university librarians).
Despite a large degree of uniformity in respect of characteristics such as education and income,
there was a wide variation in pension scheme participation rates between locations.Participation
rates varied between 73% and 14%. Duﬂo and Saez took the view that the variation could be
explained in terms of differences in social norms, or culture, between the different locations.
Inﬂuence of Emotion and Mood
Investment decisions can be affected by unrelated emotions (Loewenstein et al.2001;Slovic et al.
2002).A favourable sports result or good news about a friend can engender a good feeling, and
the good feeling can affect investment decisions. The effect of emotions increases with the
complexity and uncertainty surrounding the decision. Decisions about complex and uncertain
matters are particularly inﬂuenced by emotions (Forgas 1995).
Studies by psychologists have found that mood appears to affect predictions about the future.
People in a good mood are more optimistic about the future than people in a bad mood (Wright
and Bower 1992). The impact of mood on ﬁnancial decisions has been referred to as the
‘misattribution bias’ (Nofsinger 2005). If a person is in a good mood, there will be a tendency to
be optimistic when evaluating an investment.Good moods may cause people to be more likely to
make risky investments (for example choosing shares rather than bonds).
Weather and the length of daylight are factors that can affect mood.The effects of such factors
on investment decisions have been researched. Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) investigated the
effects of sunshine on stock market returns.When the sun is shining people feel good.This may
increase optimism and affect investment decisions.It may be the case that investors are more likely
to buy shares when the sun is shining.The purchases would cause stock prices to rise.Stock markets
in 26 cities were examined. It was found that stock market returns (price increases) were higher
on sunny days.When comparing the sunniest days with the worst days,it was found that there was
an annualised difference of 24.6% on average.
Kamstra et al. (2003) looked at the relationship between hours of daylight and stock market
returns.They found that stock markets performed relatively poorly during the autumn as the hours
of daylight fell.This was most marked for the more northerly stock markets. Consistent with the
theory was the observation that the effect occurred over October to December in the northern
hemisphere, and over April to June in the southern hemisphere.This study is consistent with the
view that sunlight affects mood and mood affects investment decisions.Sunlight enhances optimism
about the future and the prospective future returns from investments.
According to the socionomic hypothesis (Prechter 1999; Nofsinger 2005), moods can be
transmitted through social contact and a widely shared,or social,mood emerges.Contact between
people conveys mood as well as information. Collectively shared moods influence individual
decisions,with the effect that trends emerge.At times mood can dominate reason in the decision-
making process.It has been found that people in depressed moods are less willing to take risks (Yuen
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
33

and Lee 2003) and a negative mood is associated with a desire for asset preservation and safety
(Kavanagh et al.2005).Positive mood renders people more trusting (Dunn and Schweitzer 2005),
and for many people trust in the ﬁnancial services industry is a big issue when considering
investments. Positive social mood results in perceptions of trustworthiness, low risk, and high
returns whilst negative social mood is associated with low trust, high perceived risk, and low
anticipated returns (Olson 2006).
It has often been suggested that investors in institutional investments, such as unit trusts and
OEICs, have a tendency to buy when the market has risen and to sell after the market has fallen.
The tendency to buy when prices are high and to sell when they are low could be explained by
social mood.As social mood reaches its peak the level of optimism in society draws more people
into investment.The optimistic social mood causes normally very risk-averse investors to begin
investing.They buy at the peak of social mood,which coincides with the peak of the stock market.
Conversely the pessimism associated with low social mood leads to the selling of investments,just
when the stock market is at its lowest.This helps to explain the tendency for many investors,
particularly retail investors, to buy at high prices and sell at low prices. Buying at high prices and
selling at low prices results in losses.
Alternatively the poor (buy high–sell low) investment strategy may be explained by the ‘house
money’and ‘snake bite’effects (Thaler and Johnson 1990).After making a gain people are willing
to take risks with the winnings since they do not fully regard the money gained as their own (it is
the ‘house money’). So people may be more willing to buy following a price rise. Conversely the
‘snake bite’ effect renders people more risk-averse following a loss.The pain of a loss (the snake
bite) can cause people to avoid the risk of more loss by selling investments seen as risky.The ‘house
money’ and ‘snake bite’ effects are contradicted by the predictions of prospect theory.
Prospect Theory
Prospect theory is arguably the most developed theory in behavioural ﬁnance (Kahneman and
Tversky 1972, 1973, 1982).There are three key elements to prospect theory: (1) perceived
probabilities are subject to bias;(2) investors are more concerned about gains and losses than levels
of wealth; and (3) investors feel losses more than gains.
In relation to perceived probabilities, the biases are tendencies to exaggerate small and large
probabilities and underweight medium ones. See Figure 2.1.
In Figure 2.1,subjective (perceived) probabilities are referred to as decision weightings.When
plotted against actual probabilities the decision weights are too high at low and high probabilities
and too low at medium probabilities.The exaggeration of low probabilities may help to explain
the popularity of lotteries.The exaggeration of high probabilities suggests that highly likely (but
not certain) events are treated as being certain.
Figure 2.2 is a value function. It depicts subjective values assigned to gains and losses relative
to a reference point.The reference point is subjective and may,for example,be the purchase price
of an investment.The reference point divides the region where someone feels that they are making
gains from the region in which they feel that they are making losses.
It is to be noted that the slope of the function for losses is steeper than the slope for gains.This
is because,on average,people ﬁnd the pain of losses to be about 2.25 times as intense as the pleasure
from gains. Given an evens chance of winning or losing, people on average require the prospect
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
34

of a £225 win to balance the prospect of a £100 loss.This relatively large fear of loss, known as
loss-aversion, will tend to deter retail investors from stock market related investments. Loss-
aversion may explain the popularity of guaranteed equity funds,which guarantee that the original
investment cannot be lost whilst providing gains from rises in share prices. Guaranteed equity
funds are described in Chapter 34 on structured products.
Another feature of Figure 2.2 is the tendency for the slope of the value function to become less
steep as gains or losses increase.This implies that as gains are made investors will become less
inclined to take risks,since the addition to value of a higher gain is less than the reduction in value
resulting from a lowered gain.It also implies that as losses increase investors become more willing

to accept risk.This is because the value of a loss reduction outweighs the value of a further loss.
So, for example, in a losing situation an ‘evens’ bet looks attractive.An aspect of loss-aversion is
that people will avoid the risk of making losses (by avoiding risks) when in a gaining situation but
will accept risk in order to attempt to recover from a loss.Prospect theory sees investors as being
loss-averse rather than risk-averse.
This behaviour in a loss-making situation is consistent with the idea of an escalation bias (Shefrin
2001). An escalation bias leads to ‘averaging down’ whereby as the price falls the investment is
treated as being an increasingly good bargain.The thinking is that if a share was a good buy at £2,
it is a fantastic bargain at £1 and more should be bought. It is psychologically difﬁcult to consider
the possibility that the initial purchase was at an excessively high price.The rational behaviour
would be to consider the possibility that an item of bad news justiﬁes the price fall.The investor’s
psychology makes it difﬁcult to look for the bad news and its implications for the value of the share.
The psychological difﬁculty in considering the possibility that the initial purchase was at an
excessively high price could be seen as an example of cognitive dissonance. Evidence that beliefs
or decisions are wrong causes mental stress.This may result in the reluctance to admit an error.
Holding a poorly performing investment too long is an aspect of the reluctance to admit that the
investment was a mistake.
The reference point is subjective, but is likely to be inﬂuenced by one or more past values.
Possibilities include the purchase price of the investment, the highest price seen, or an average of
observed previous values.Heath et al.(1999) concluded,on the basis of evidence from the exercise
of employee stock options, that the most likely reference point used is the highest price of the
previous 12 months. It appears that people periodically update the reference point to reﬂect
unrealised proﬁts.However the study of the Boston housing market by Genesove and Mayer (2001)
is consistent with the purchase price constituting the reference point.
Lin et al. (2006a), from a survey of investors, concluded that multiple reference points could
be present simultaneously.The most important was the outcome from not investing at all.Two other
signiﬁcant reference points were the expected outcome, and the outcome from the best-
performing alternative.The outcome from the worst-performing alternative was not a signiﬁcant
reference point;the observation that the outcome could have been worse did not appear to provide
any comfort. Consistent with the curvature of Figure 2.2 was the ﬁnding that the direction of
deviation from a reference point was more important than the size of deviation in the generation
of feelings of regret or pleasure.Contrary to prospect theory,no asymmetry between upward and
downward deviations was found. Upward and downward deviations from reference points
appeared to have equivalent effects on feelings of regret and gratiﬁcation.
Since reference points are subjective values they are susceptible to psychological biases. An
important feature of reference points is that they appear to be inﬂuenced by the form in which
information is presented, in other words according to how a situation is framed. For example
telling an investor that a portfolio has risen in value by 5% might give the feeling that the reference
point has been exceeded whereas saying that it has underperformed a benchmark by 5% could cause
a perception of loss, whilst both statements may record the same outcome.The latter framing is
likely to raise the reference level.A statement that share price gains have outweighed losses may
cause a different reference level than a statement that some losses have held back the overall proﬁt.
The former statement, which is positive, is likely to engender a more positive perception of the
outcome than the latter statement, which is negative.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
36

It has been suggested that reference points may evolve over time with the result that loss-
aversion is accompanied by disappointment aversion (Ang et al.2005;Fielding and Stracca 2007).
Under loss-aversion an investor has a ﬁxed reference point, which might be the current level of
stock prices or the current value of personal wealth. Gains and losses are evaluated against the
reference point.The reference point could evolve according to the investment horizon.If reference
points change over time there could be a disappointment aversion in addition to a loss-aversion.
In the case of loss-aversion the pain of losses exceeds the pleasure of gains,when the gains and losses
are of the same magnitude. In the case of disappointment aversion the pain or pleasure is brought
about by deviations from expectations.The disappointment related to outcomes below expectations
is stronger than the pleasure related to outcomes that exceed expectations. Although losses on
investments may occur only in the short term, there may be disappointments in the long term.
Although there may be gains in the long term, they would result in negative feelings if they fell
below expectations.Whether loss-aversion and disappointment aversion are alternatives or coexist,
the tendency for the pain of loss or disappointment to exceed the pleasure of exceeding reference
points could deter investors from risky investments such as stocks.
Reference points can be inﬂuenced by self-imposed rules aimed at establishing self-control.
People are prone to mental accounting, with different investments being allocated to different
purposes (Kahneman and Tversky 1982). For example one portfolio may be for the purpose of
funding retirement whilst another is for ﬁnancing children through university.Mental accounting
keeps these two portfolios separate so that neither is subsidised by the other. It may be that in
aggregate the two portfolios are showing strong gains whilst one is showing a loss.The mental
accounting will cause the perception of loss, in relation to a portfolio, despite the overall proﬁt.
One frequent rule for self-control is ‘never touch the capital’;this means that dividends and interest
should be used to ﬁnance spending but not the capital sum.A low dividend may lead to a forced
withdrawal of capital.There may have been a strong capital appreciation,but the mental accounting
that separates capital and dividends could result in feelings of failure and loss.Another example of
how the framing of information inﬂuences perceptions is the line often used by ﬁnancial advisers
when attempting to sell regular savings schemes: a share price rise is good because you become
richer but a fall is also good because your money buys more shares (these are both positive
statements).A client is less likely to be told:a share price rise is bad because your money buys fewer
shares but a fall is also bad because you become poorer (negative statements).
Shefrin and Statman (1984a) have argued that investors account for dividends, and capital
gains/losses, separately at some times and together at other times. In the event of a small fall in
share prices an investor may combine the capital loss with dividends in order to be able to see an
overall gain. In the event of a large fall in share prices, the investor may separate them in order to
be able to feel that there is a gain in relation to dividends.An implication of this ability to switch
mental accounting is that investors prefer a combination of dividends and capital growth to
receiving the whole beneﬁt in the form of capital gains.
A report produced jointly by Distribution Technology and the Pensions Institute in the UK
(Distribution Technology 2005) found that pension fund investment was consistent with prospect
theory. In the context of pre-retirement ﬁnancial planning, investors who are underfunded and
anticipating a low retirement income tend to take a high level of investment risk in an attempt to
remedy the underfunding.This is consistent with the observation that people in a loss-making
position are more willing to accept risk than people in a proﬁt-making position.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
37

The report put investors into three categories.The ﬁrst category, which accounted for more
than a half of people, was distinguished by ‘loss avoidance’.This category was characterised by a
refusal to take any risk.In terms of prospect theory,this group exhibited ‘total loss-aversion’.The
second category (the smallest) was distinguished by ‘extreme loss-aversion’.Whilst prepared to
take some risk, the compensation required to take risk (in terms of expected additional return)
was extremely high.The third category (the second largest) was distinguished by ‘moderate loss-
aversion’. It is among this group that realistic views of long-term investment were found.The
third category tended to have relatively high levels of general education and to be relatively young.
The Disposition Effect
Prospect theory appears to be able to explain the disposition effect.The disposition effect is the
willingness of investors to sell investments that show gains but not investments that show losses.
Odean (2001) found that investors using a discount brokerage held losing stocks for an average of
124 days and winning stocks an average of 102 days.He also found that an average of 15% of gains
were realised against only 10% of losses.Locke and Mann (1999) found that futures traders were
also prone to the disposition effect.Further evidence for the disposition effect comes from Ferris
et al. (1987) and from Schlarbaum et al. (1978).
Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) found that a large positive return in one week increased
the likelihood of a sale the following week.A large decrease reduced the likelihood of a subsequent
sale.The effects were most pronounced for investment behaviour which occurred very soon
after the price moves.The results were common to both individual investors and institutional
investors (institutional investors include pension funds,insurance funds,and unit trusts).Statman
et al. (2006) found that turnover in a particular stock was positively related to recent returns
(price movements) on that stock. This is consistent with the disposition effect proposition
that investors are more willing to sell following a price rise.They found the relationship to be
stronger in the cases of small capitalisation stocks and earlier time periods, which they saw as
evidence that individual investors may be more prone to the disposition effect than institutional
investors. Barber et al. (2007) found a disposition effect in the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where
investors appeared to be about twice as likely to sell a stock showing a gain than a stock showing
a loss. However, institutional investors (speciﬁcally mutual funds) did not demonstrate the
disposition effect.
Genesove and Mayer (2001) examined the disposition effect in the Boston housing market
during the 1990s.They found that owners who faced selling at a loss tended to set their asking prices
too high.To the expected selling price,they added 25–35% of the difference between the property’s
expected selling price and their original purchase price.As a result their houses were on the market
for a relatively long time before being sold.
Shefrin and Statman (1984) interpreted the disposition effect in terms of the fear of regret and
seeking pride. Selling a loss-making investment triggers feelings of regret.There is a realisation
that the decision to buy it was bad. Selling an investment at a proﬁt validates the decision to buy,
and produces a feeling of pride. In consequence investors prefer to sell investments whose prices
have risen rather than those whose prices have fallen.The disposition effect is reinforced by the
tendency for many investors to treat ‘paper losses’differently to realised losses.While the position
is still held prices could rise; when it is sold the loss is conﬁrmed.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
38

The disposition effect appears to be absent when share price movements are general rather
than speciﬁc to individual company shares.Nofsinger (2001) found that asset price rises and falls,
resulting from news about the general economy,did not result in the disposition effect.This could
be interpreted in terms of the signiﬁcance of personal decision-making. Pride and regret arise
when proﬁts and losses can be seen as resulting from one’s own decisions.Those feelings are less
likely when proﬁts and losses are seen as arising from events outside one’s control (Clarke et al.
1994).
The question arises as to whether psychological biases reﬂect an investor’s personality,whether
the biases can be reduced by learning, and whether interaction with others can affect the biases.
These matters have implications for ﬁnancial advisers when dealing with clients who are subject
to biases.Weber and Welfens (2006) have researched these issues in relation to the disposition
effect.They tested for individual differences, stability of the bias, and the effects of learning.They
found that there were substantial individual differences in proneness to the disposition effect.
While most people appeared to exhibit the disposition effect, some behaved in the opposite
manner.Loss realisation aversion (the reluctance to sell investments that were making losses) was
found to be much more common than the tendency to sell investments that had risen in price.
Investors exhibiting a strong tendency to sell proﬁt-making investments were not necessarily the
same as those reluctant to sell loss-making investments.The study suggested that the two sides of
the disposition effect were unrelated.
Weber and Welfens (2006) found that investors who were prone to the disposition effect in one
choice situation were also subject to the effect when making other choices.For example,an investor
prone to the disposition effect when making stock market decisions tended to be prone to the effect
when making housing market decisions.The strength of the effect was also stable over time.
Someone with a strong disposition effect at one point in time would tend to have a relatively strong
disposition effect at a later point in time.There appeared to be individual stability of the effect across
different decisions and over time. These observations are consistent with the view that the
disposition effect reﬂects stable personality traits. It was also found that interaction between
investors reduced the individual stability of the effect.This suggests that social inﬂuences can affect
the extent of individual psychological biases.
Weber and Welfens (2006) found that learning reduced the extent of the disposition effect.The
tendency to be affected by the disposition effect was stable when considering the relative strength
of the effect between individuals, but the absolute size of the effect was reduced by learning.This
is consistent with the view that the effect is the result of a lack of knowledge of investment.
A feature of Figure 2.2 is the tendency for the slope of the value function to become less steep
as gains or losses increase.This implies that as gains are made investors will become less inclined
to take risks,since the addition to value of a higher gain is less than the reduction in value resulting
from a lowered gain.This is consistent with the disposition effect since the sale of stocks would
achieve a reduction in risk. Figure 2.2 also implies that as losses increase investors become more
willing to accept risk.This is because the value of a loss reduction outweighs the value of a further
loss. So, for example, in a losing situation an ‘evens’ bet looks attractive.Again this is consistent
with the disposition effect since keeping stocks would avoid a reduction in risk.
The tendency for the slope of the value function to become less steep as gains or losses increase
is also consistent with the hedonic editing hypothesis, which posits a preference for integrating
losses and separating gains (Lim 2006). By selling a number of loss-making investments
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
39

simultaneously, an investor can reduce the pain of loss since the pain from each additional sale is
reduced as a result of the curvature of the value function (the diminishing sensitivity to loss). By
selling proﬁtable investments individually the pleasure is maximised since the diminishing pleasure
implied by the curvature is avoided; each sale makes its maximum contribution to the feeling of
pleasure. Lim found that there was a tendency for investors to sell losing stocks in bundles and
gaining stocks separately.
Frederick (2005) has presented evidence that the accuracy of the perception of risk, and
risk tolerance, are related to a personality characteristic referred to as ‘cognitive reﬂection’.
Cognitive reﬂection is the ability to resist the ﬁrst impulse or intuition. It is the tendency to
reﬂect and think about a problem rather than following initial inclinations.People who are high in
cognitive reﬂection tend to be good at evaluating risky investment situations,and tend to be willing
to take risks.
Avoidance of Psychological Biases
Montier (2003/2004) offered advice on how to counter some of the errors that arise from
psychological biases. His points (somewhat paraphrased) included:
1.
You know less than you think.
2.
Be less certain in your views.
3.
Listen to those who do not agree with you.
4.
You did not know it all along; you just think you did.
5.
Do not take information at face value; consider how it is presented.
6.
Do not confuse good ﬁrms with good investments.
7.
Easily recalled events are less likely than you think.
8.
Be prepared to sell your losers and hold your winners.
It has been suggested that ﬁnancial advisers should educate their clients not only about ﬁnancial
products, but also about the psychological biases that the clients may exhibit. Farrow (2006)
suggested that ﬁnancial advisers should recognise the role emotions play in the decision-making
of their clients and should help them to manage those emotions.Attempts at eliminating negative
behaviour on the part of clients can be an important part of an adviser’s service.Farrow proposed
that the recommendation of index tracker funds could be useful to such a process.However there
is a danger that an adviser who attempts to correct psychological biases, and to remove emotion
from decision-making, may ﬁnd that clients go to another adviser who treats the biases as
preferences to be accommodated.
SAVING AND SELF-CONTROL
Thaler and Shefrin (1981) describe the self-control problem as the interaction between a person’s
two selves: the planner and the doer.The doer wants to spend now rather than later, and delays
unpleasant tasks.The planner is inclined to save for the future and get unpleasant tasks dealt with
quickly.There is a conﬂict between desire and will power as a result of the inﬂuence of both short-
term emotion and long-term rational concerns.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS

When making decisions involving the present there is a tendency to procrastinate.For example
most people would rather receive £50 now than £100 in two years (foregoing a 41% p.a. return)
whereas £100 in six years is preferred to £50 in four years. From a ﬁnance perspective the two
choices are the same,except one is deferred (Ainsle 1991).People seem to view the present very
differently to how they view the future.The attitude to the present appears to be characterised by
strong desire and weak will power.
Choi et al. (2001) found that many low savers actually wanted to save more.They found that
two-thirds of their sample recognised that they were saving too little.The problem was one of will
power.They also found that whereas a third of the people surveyed intended to increase their
savings rates in the near future, most of those well-intentioned people (86%) did not do so.
Procrastination was present; the intended increase in saving was postponed.
Rabinovich and Webley (2007) focused their study on people who had expressed an intention
to save. In this way they separated the implementation of an intention from the formation of the
intention (arguably the two behavioural processes behind intentional saving).The factors that
increase the likelihood that saving intentions are implemented may be different to the factors that
lead to the formation of intentions to save. The study identiﬁed those who succeeded in
implementing their saving intentions as the ‘plan-and-do’group and those who failed to implement
their saving intentions as the ‘plan-in-vain’group.Time horizon and expenditure control techniques
were found to be important factors in the successful implementation of saving intentions.
Time horizon,the inclination to think ahead,has a positive effect on both the intention to save
and the implementation of the intention. Rabinovich and Webley found signiﬁcant differences in
time horizon between plan-and-do and plan-in-vain groups. The tendency to think ahead is
associated with the successful implementation of saving intentions.The expenditure control
techniques, which were found to help the successful implementation of saving plans, made the
saving process automatic and partially independent of will power.Automatic deduction of saving
from salary is an example of an automatic process.Use of mental accounting can also facilitate the
implementation of saving intentions.If money to be saved were transferred to a separate account,
psychology would give it a different status.The account containing savings is perceived differently
to an account for expenditure,and the designation of a separate mental account for savings reduces
the likelihood of spending from that account.
To help with will power people employ rules-of-thumb and environmental controls (Thaler and
Shefrin 1981; Hoch and Loewenstein 1991; Nofsinger 2002). Environmental controls include
automatic deductions from salary and monthly standing orders into savings or pension plans.Thaler
(1994) found that most people who invested in a pension plan one year, contributed again the
following year.They form a habit to help their will power.However,people tend to leave pension
contributions until close to the last possible date (Shefrin and Thaler 1992); they seem to need a
deadline in order to assert self-control.Thaler (1994) suggested that people ﬁnd it easier to save
from lump-sum payments than from regular income.Saving money from a monthly salary requires
more self-control (Thaler and Shefrin 1981).
It has often been wondered why many investors prefer cash dividends in preference to selling
shares as a means of turning capital gains into cash. Selling part of a shareholding as a means of
turning a capital gain into cash may have tax advantages relative to receiving dividends.Nonetheless
investors frequently prefer to receive cash dividends. This appears to be irrational from the
perspective of maximising income. It may be explicable in terms of rules-of-thumb employed to
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
41

help will power. One such rule-of-thumb is ‘never touch the capital’.The capital, be it a sum of
money in a bank deposit or a holding of shares, is treated as being untouchable.This piece of self-
discipline ensures that the capital remains intact in order to provide income in the future.
Distribution Technology and the Pensions Institute (Distribution Technology 2005) found that
most retirees with pension funds choose annuities (retirement incomes) that start at a high level,
but without rises,in preference to annuities that start lower but rise over time to compensate for
inﬂation.This is consistent with a preference for immediate expenditure.
Habitual Non-Savers
Scottish Widows, the UK ﬁnancial services company, carries out an annual survey into pensions
saving behaviour.The 2005 survey (Scottish Widows 2005) concluded that about 17% of people
with sufﬁcient income to save do not do so; this is consistent with the British Household Panel
Survey,which suggests that about 18% of people are persistent non-savers (Department for Work
and Pensions 2003).The Scottish Widows ﬁgure is possibly an underestimate since anyone in a
deﬁned-beneﬁt pension scheme (i.e.an occupational pension that relates the pension to salary and
years of service) is seen as saving, irrespective of whether they save outside the pension scheme,
and it excludes people under 30.The non-savers are consistent and habitual non-savers.Differences
in income levels do not seem to substantially affect this group;the proportion of non-savers remains
fairly constant as income levels rise (considering the 30–50 age group the Scottish Widows survey
found that 14% of those earning £30,000 to £40,000 were non-savers,and 12.5% of those earning
over £40,000 were non-savers).However the proportion of non-savers declines past the age of 50.
The Scottish Widows survey identiﬁed a number of characteristics that appeared to distinguish
habitual non-savers from savers.Non-savers are more likely to take a negative view of other people.
Non-savers see themselves as relatively less happy, less healthy, less emotionally secure, and as
having a worse romantic and social life. Non-savers are more likely to want a complete change in
their lives.They are more likely to feel that they are unable to control,and cope with,their situation
in life.They are less able to plan ahead.Non-savers are much more likely to be smokers.The main
reason given for not saving is that they cannot afford it (even though many have high incomes),and
many say that they could not reduce their spending without signiﬁcantly affecting their lifestyles.
Somewhat paradoxically, non-savers are more likely to believe that they will be able to live
comfortably on a low income in retirement.
Non-savers are less likely to own their own homes,and those who do own their homes tend to
have less valuable properties than savers (note that the survey was constructed so as to eliminate
income and age as explanatory factors). Non-savers are more likely to have non-mortgage debts;
they are less likely to see themselves as responsible in their borrowing and in their use of the
borrowed money.
The Scottish Widows ﬁndings are broadly consistent with the results of the ‘Family Resources
Survey 2003-04’, carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions (Department for Work
and Pensions 2005),which found that 27% of households had accumulated absolutely no savings.
It is not surprising that the Scottish Widows survey found that non-savers were less happy, less
satisﬁed,and less able to cope with their situations in life.It has been found that debt has a negative
effect on psychological well-being (Brown et al.2005) and that people in (non-mortgage) debt are
prone to stress, depression, and anxiety (Citizens Advice 2003). It would seem reasonable to
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
42

presume that, if debt causes stress and psychological disorders, the existence of accumulated
savings would improve psychological well-being. Possession of accumulated savings provides a
buffer against adversity.Possession of money gives a degree of control over the effects of unforeseen
adverse events, and reduces feelings of stress. Events that require expenditure to deal with
problems,cause much more stress when the required money is not available.Accumulated savings
provide a sense of independence,security,and control.However the study by Brown et al.(2005)
indicated that it was regular saving,rather than accumulated wealth,that had a beneﬁcial effect on
psychological well-being.
Watson (2003) researched the relationship between materialism and saving behaviour. It was
found that highly materialistic people were more likely to see themselves as spenders, and were
more inclined to borrow.In particular they were favourably disposed towards borrowing for non-
essential purposes and luxury items.People with low levels of materialism were more likely to save,
and were more likely to own ﬁnancial investments such as shares and mutual funds (unit trusts).
The complicated nature of the factors that affect the accumulation of debt (and possibly, by
extension,saving behaviour) has been highlighted in a study conducted by Stone and Maury (2006).
They developed a model capable of predicting indebtedness.The factors used in the prediction
included demographic, ﬁnancial, economic, psychological, and situational aspects.
Self-Control, Personality Traits, and Social Mood
The results of both the Scottish Widows survey and the Stone and Maury study suggested that
saving behaviour could be related to aspects of personality. Olson (2006) reported that the most
prominent classiﬁcation of personality types is the Five-Factor Model. The ﬁve factors are
extroversion versus introversion, agreeableness versus antagonism, conscientiousness versus
heedlessness, emotional stability versus neuroticism, and openness-to-experience versus closed-
to-experience. Some researchers have concluded that the ﬁve factors can be divided into two
groups, thus making a two-factor model. Olson posited engagement and self-control as the two
factors.Engagement encompasses extroversion and openness to experience,whereas self-control
covers emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Low scores on the self-control
traits have been found to be associated with stealing, drug and alcohol abuse, absenteeism from
work, bad behaviour towards other people, and poor handling of stress. Research has found that
deﬁciencies in self-control are linked to addiction, crime, domestic violence, bankruptcy, and
academic failure; and negative emotions appear to impair self-control (Tice et al. 2001).The
characteristics of low self-control people seem to be broadly consistent with the characteristics of
non-savers identiﬁed in the Scottish Widows study.
Personality traits are not immutably ﬁxed,and can be inﬂuenced by external factors.One such
factor is social mood,which is mood that is pervasive within society.Prechter (1999) posited that
during periods of negative social mood people are more likely to display the characteristics of low
self-control. Negative social mood appears to be associated with distress, anxiety, antagonism,
conﬂict,and reduced interest in work and achievement.For those who do save,social mood could
inﬂuence the way in which the savings are invested.Negative social mood is likely to be associated
with caution and risk-aversion, and hence the avoidance of stock market investments. Positive
social mood is thought to engender engagement,including engagement with the high return,high
risk investments associated with stock markets.

INFLUENCES ON RETIREMENT SAVING BEHAVIOUR
Jacobs-Lawson and Hershey (2005) investigated psychological determinants of retirement saving
behaviour.They found that the existence,and extent,of saving for retirement was related to three
psychological characteristics. One of those characteristics is ‘future time perspective’, which is a
measure of the extent to which people focus on the future (it is alternatively known as ‘future
orientation’).A number of studies (Burtless 1999;Hershey and Mowen 2000;Lusardi 1999) found
that future time perspective is positively related to the tendency to save for retirement.
Another characteristic that Jacobs-Lawson and Hershey (2005) found to be related to saving
for retirement was knowledge of ﬁnancial planning for retirement. A number of studies have
indicated that ﬁnancial knowledge is positively related to levels of retirement saving (Ekerdt et al.
2001; Grable and Lytton 1997; Hershey and Mowen 2000; Mitchell and Moore 1998;Yuh and
DeVaney 1996).The third characteristic investigated by Jacobs-Lawson and Hershey was risk
tolerance. Grable and Joo (1997) and Yuh and DeVaney (1996) found that risk tolerance was
positively related to the level of retirement saving.
The ﬁndings of Jacobs-Lawson and Hershey were consistent with the results of previous studies
in that higher levels of retirement saving were associated with greater degrees of future time
perspective, knowledge of ﬁnancial planning for retirement, and ﬁnancial risk tolerance.
Harrison et al. (2006) investigated attitudes to retirement saving by the use of focus groups.
One ﬁnding was that positive or negative feelings about ageing and retirement have effects on
saving.Some people dislike the thought of growing old whereas others relish the prospect of being
free of the need to work. It is possible that the fear of old age is dealt with by putting the future
out of mind,and that is likely to put preparation for the future out of mind.Those looking forward
to retirement may be more inclined to prepare for it.Three other factors found to deter saving for
retirement were (1) the view that pension savings would be offset by reduced state beneﬁts, (2) a
mistrust of ﬁnancial advisers, and (3) social pressures that encourage current spending.
Neukam and Hershey (2003) suggested that ‘ﬁnancial inhibition’and ‘ﬁnancial activation’were
important determinants of retirement saving. Financial inhibition encompasses fear-based factors
that deter saving.Such factors include the negative thoughts about growing old,as identiﬁed in the
Harrison et al. (2006) study. If old age is associated with images of poor health and faded looks,
people may be reluctant to prepare for it.Thoughts of old age evoke feelings of fear and anxiety.
Little thought is given to retirement since such thought has unpleasant connotations. Financial
activation relates to goal-based motives that encourage saving.If old age were associated with leisure
and freedom to choose how to use time,there would be a greater incentive to save for retirement.
Financial inhibition is fear-based and ﬁnancial activation is goal-based.They are two distinct
characteristics rather than two ends of the same dimension. Neukam and Hershey (2003) found
that the people who saved most were those with the strongest ﬁnancial goals and the lowest level
of fear.The goals and fears were not only related to visions of old age, but also to the planning
process.The personal characteristics interact.For example a strong drive towards saving (planning)
for retirement could be offset by a high level of fear about the planning process;a strong desire to
accumulate wealth for retirement could be offset by a fear of stock market risk or a distrust of the
ﬁnancial services industry.This latter point is close to the Harrison et al. (2006) observation that
mistrust of ﬁnancial advisers can deter retirement saving.The importance of fears concerning the
saving (retirement planning) process relates to the Jacobs-Lawson and Hershey (2005) ﬁndings that
ﬁnancial knowledge and risk tolerance are positively related to retirement saving.

Automatic Enrolment in Pension Schemes
Information overload can deter retirement saving (Turner 2006).If the choice between investment
alternatives is too large and too complex,many employees take a default option.The default option
may be to do nothing. One remedy is to provide default options other than non-participation.
Automatic enrolment in pension schemes (with the right to withdraw) makes the default option
one of participation.This is likely to bring into a pension scheme both those who wish to save but
fail to take action,and those who give little or no thought to ﬁnancial matters.Another dimension
of positive default options is to have a default fund that would be suitable for the average employee.
A suitable contribution rate might be provided as the default rate, perhaps with an element of
automatic escalation over time. Alternatives to the default options could be provided for the
employees who wish to exercise choice.Turner (2004) reported that in Sweden’s mandatory
scheme 82% of new entrants allowed their entire contributions to be paid into the default fund
whilst more than 600 other funds were available. Mitchell and Utkus (2006) provide evidence
that pension fund participants like to be at the average and like to avoid extremes when making
choices.This is consistent with the observation that plan participants tend to accept default options,
which may be seen as the average (middle-of-the-road) options.
Akerlof (1991) concluded that most people succumb to the desire of current expenditure
during their peak earning years and delay saving for retirement.Pension plan administrators often
ﬁnd that the most difﬁcult step is to get people to start contributing.People tend to procrastinate.
In the UK, the government is considering a change in company pension regulations so that
employees join pension schemes automatically.The decision of the employee is thus one of whether
to leave the scheme rather than one of whether to join.Procrastination would leave employees in
the pension scheme. Madrian and Shea (2000) concluded that automatic enrolment plans are
successful in increasing participation rates. In studying a plan that was changed to automatic
enrolment, they found an increase in the participation rate from 49% to 86%. However most
participants chose the minimum contribution level;the analysis of Madrian and Shea indicated that
many participants would have chosen a higher contribution rate if they had explicitly chosen to
opt into the scheme. Choi et al. (2001) found that people who would otherwise have contributed
more into a pension scheme accept the default contribution rate when enrolment is automatic.So
whilst automatic enrolment increases the number of members, those who would have joined
anyway contribute less than they would have done in the absence of automatic enrolment.
The temptation to spend immediately is also reﬂected in choices made at retirement.When
there is an option to take a lump sum in the place of part (or all) of the pension, people tend to
choose the lump sum.This would be reinforced by the fear of dying soon after retirement with the
effect that the money spent on an annuity would be lost.An annuity is an income for life that is
purchased with a pension fund.Annuities provide insurance against longevity risk,which is the risk
that someone could outlive their money. Longevity risk is the risk that a person’s money is fully
spent before death so that the person has no money during the later years of life.An annuity could
be the default option at retirement.
Save More Tomorrow:
Benartzi and Thaler (2004) used the principles of behavioural ﬁnance to develop a practical
programme for increasing the level of saving into pension schemes.The programme is called Save
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
45

More Tomorrow (SMarT).The programme was designed to help employees who want to save
more for retirement but ﬁnd that their will power is lacking.
One feature of SMarT is that there is a time lag between commitment to the scheme and the
date on which payments begin.This overcomes the problem that people tend to value immediate
money very highly (sometimes called hyperbolic discounting). People ﬁnd it easier to commit to
a future investment than an immediate one.
A second feature is that increases in payments to the scheme coincide with pay rises. By using
part of a pay rise, contributors do not feel that they are reducing their disposable income (take-
home pay).This avoids the aversion to loss identiﬁed by prospect theory.It does not seem to matter
whether the pay rise is a real one, or simply matches inﬂation, since people seem to suffer from
money illusion.The real rise is the increase in the purchasing power of the wage; if prices are
rising,the real rise is less than the rise in money terms.Money illusion causes people to see money
rises as real ones. Evidence for money illusion has been found by Kahneman et al. (1986) and by
Shaﬁr et al. (1997).
A third feature is that the contributions to the pension scheme increase every time there is a
pay rise, until a predetermined maximum proportion of income is reached.The status quo bias
indicates that when faced with a choice people tend to do nothing (i.e. they maintain the status
quo).This causes procrastination. If the decision has already been made to increase contributions
to the scheme,maintenance of the status quo entails proceeding with the existing arrangement to
increase contributions.
A fourth feature is that employees can opt out of the plan if they wish to.This makes commitment
to the scheme less binding, and hence makes the commitment more likely.The status quo bias
tends to keep people in the scheme.
Benartzi and Thaler applied SMarT in a company and found that it was successful in raising
rates of saving into a pension fund.They found that the average saving rate for participants in the
programme increased from 3.5% to 13.6% over 40 months.They also found that 78% of the
employees joined the programme, and that 80% of the joiners were still in the scheme after
40 months.
Benartzi and Thaler estimated that implementation of SMarT throughout the United States
could increase personal saving by $125 billion per year. Investment of such additional sums in
stock and bond markets would put substantial upward pressure on share prices and bond prices.
Successful plans to increase saving into pension funds could cause large rises in share (and bond)
prices.After all, share prices are determined by demand and supply.A large increase in demand
would be expected to result in a considerable rise in prices.The new savers would be rewarded
with capital gains, and that might further encourage saving.There could be positive feedback
investing whereby rising share prices lead to increased investment,which in turn raises share prices
(and hence investment).Behavioural biases would tend to reinforce this upward trend (as described
in Chapter 27 on stock market bubbles and crashes).
CLASSIFYING INVESTORS
Many of the predictions of behavioural ﬁnance are mutually inconsistent.Some behavioural biases
predict overreaction whilst others predict under-reaction, some indicate underestimation of risk
whereas others suggest overestimation, and some lead to excessive trading whilst others entail
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
46

inertia. Other opposing predictions can be deduced from the principles of behavioural ﬁnance.
Behavioural biases cannot apply equally to all investors. People differ in their susceptibility to
particular psychological biases.Different biases impact different investors to varying extents.The
question arises as to whether people can be categorised in terms of which behavioural biases are
most inﬂuential in their decision-making.
Categorisations of savers and investors have been proposed by Beckett et al. (2000) and by
Keller and Siegrist (2006).The Beckett et al. classiﬁcation is shown in Table 2.3.
The term ‘Consumer conﬁdence’ covers a number of attributes: uncertainty, perception of
risk,complexity,and knowledge.The term ‘Involvement’encompasses control,participation,and
contact.
The ‘No purchase’ group makes no investment.This group is characterised by low conﬁdence
and low involvement.The group includes people who leave large sums of money on deposit rather
than investing more proﬁtably.
The ‘Repeat-Passive’group takes little interest in the investment process (has low involvement)
but has sufﬁcient conﬁdence to take some risk.This group persistently invests in the same shares or
funds.Its members show loyalty to the particular shares or funds,which they repeatedly invest in.
The ‘Rational-Active’ group comes closest to the investors of conventional (non-behavioural)
ﬁnance theory.This group demonstrates the inclination,and has sufﬁcient conﬁdence in its ability,
to choose actively between investments.These investors are willing to accept risk and to exercise
control over their own investments.
The ‘Relational-Dependent’ group contains the investors who seek professional advice.They
take an interest in the investment process but do not have sufﬁcient conﬁdence, in their ability to
understand investment choices, to make their own evaluations of the alternatives.
The Keller and Siegrist (2006) classiﬁcation is shown in Table 2.4.
Keller and Siegrist make the (often overlooked) point that many people are not interested in
saving,investing,and wealth accumulation.Money is not very important to members of the ‘Money
dummies’ and ‘Open books’ clusters. Possessing money and increasing wealth are not important
goals for them.They show low interest and involvement in matters of personal ﬁnance.However,
‘Money dummies’are more favourably disposed towards stock market investing than ‘Open books’
(partly because ‘Open books’ tend to see stock market investing as immoral).

The investment of money is important to members of the ‘Risk seekers’ and ‘Safe players’
clusters. Possessing money and increasing wealth are important goals for them.They are more
inclined to save than the ‘Money dummies’ and ‘Open books’.They differ in their attitudes to
stock market investing.‘Safe players’ are more likely to keep their money on deposit rather than
investing in stocks.‘Risk seekers’are more favourably disposed towards stock market investments
and are relatively tolerant of risk.They are more conﬁdent about managing money than the other
groups.
Tables 2.3 and 2.4 have been intentionally drawn to show parallels between the two classiﬁcations.
Although the correspondence is far from perfect,there is a degree of correspondence between the
quadrants in the two tables (‘Repeat-Passive’ with ‘Money dummies’;‘No purchase’ with ‘Open
books’;‘Rational-Active’ with ‘Risk seekers’;‘Relational-Dependent’ with ‘Safe players’).
Possibly the weakest correspondence is between ‘Relational-Dependent’ and ‘Safe players’.
Both are concerned with saving and investing.However,with regard to stock market investments,
the ‘Relational-Dependent’group are probably more concerned with the complexity of the choices
such that they seek professional advice.The ‘Safe players’ have a tendency to avoid stock market
investment because it is seen as immoral. It is possible that this apparent difference between the
groups arises from the Keller and Siegrist questionnaire,which asked about attitudes to the morality
of stock market investing rather than its complexity or risk.
It is not difﬁcult to assign behavioural biases to the four quadrants.Investors in the top left-hand
quadrant are more likely to exhibit conservatism,status quo bias,and familiarity bias.The bottom
left-hand quadrant would tend to contain the non-savers and procrastinators.The top right quadrant
would be expected to contain the investors with a tendency towards overconﬁdence.The bottom
right quadrant could contain a signiﬁcant proportion of the investors for whom the complexity of
choice is a problem.
The more loss-averse investors are probably in the bottom quadrants. Investors in the lower
quadrants may be subject to biases that cause exaggerated perceptions of risk, such as the
retrievability (availability) bias and the narrow framing that leads to excessive focus on short-term
volatility.
An understanding of how different people think about saving and investment is important to
policy-makers seeking to encourage saving for retirement and to ﬁnancial institutions wanting to
market their own investment products.

The Need for Targeted Marketing
Lee (2002) took the view that there should be different approaches to marketing ﬁnancial services,
dependent upon the characteristics of the consumer group being targeted. Using cluster analysis
consumers of ﬁnancial services were divided into four groups.The four groups were named ‘open
to direct means’,‘cherry pickers’,‘needs human touch’, and ‘undecided’.Their relative levels of
afﬂuence followed that order.
The ‘open to direct means’cluster did not need contact with advisers when deciding upon the
purchase of ﬁnancial services. They preferred to arrange ﬁnancial services via the Internet,
telephone,or post.This group was the most afﬂuent,the most highly educated,the youngest,and
the most knowledgeable about ﬁnancial services.
The ‘cherry pickers’ were prepared to use direct means to arrange some ﬁnancial services,
such as credit cards and insurance, but preferred human contact for other services, such
as mortgages and investments. This was the second most afﬂuent group, and tended to be
middle-aged.They had a reasonably good level of education,but not as much as the ‘open to direct
means’ cluster.
The ‘needs human touch’group strongly preferred face-to-face interaction.They were relatively
poorly organised with respect to ﬁnancial management.The ‘undecided’ group expressed no
preference between direct and human contact delivery of ﬁnancial services.It was the least afﬂuent
cluster,and contained relatively older members.They were relatively poorly organised in respect
to ﬁnancial management, and often expressed budgeting difﬁculties.
It appears that it is not just the nature of ﬁnancial products that needs to be varied according to
the characteristics of the targeted groups,but the means of marketing and delivering the products
also need to be varied. Some groups require more personal input than others. Human contact is
a more expensive form of marketing and sales than direct means such as websites,telemarketing,
and post.Unfortunately it seems that the consumers who require the most expensive delivery are
the consumers whose relative lack of afﬂuence makes them the least attractive to the providers of
ﬁnancial services.
There is evidence that marketing effort should be inﬂuenced by economic factors as well as by
the characteristics of targeted groups.Tang et al. (2007) found that the effects of changes in
economic and stock market conditions differed according to the socio-demographic characteristics
of the consumers.A rise in unemployment is associated with reduced demand for ﬁnancial products
but the rich and the over 55s are less affected than other groups. Rises in inﬂation have a negative
effect on purchases of savings products but affect older people less than younger people.Conversely
the negative effect of stock market falls is greatest for the over 55s.
THE POSSIBILITY OF MISLEADING MARKETING
Investors should not only be aware of their psychological biases, but they should also be aware of
how marketing can be misleading. Capon et al. (1996) found that the main factor in the decision
of which fund to choose was the fund performance in the recent past.Zweig (2000) observed that
fund managers took advantage of this by timing their advertising to coincide with relatively good
performance of their funds. Investment companies typically operate a family of funds.The better
performing funds from the family can be advertised,and the company as a whole thereby appears
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS
49

in a favourable light.The time period over which the advertised performance is measured could
also be chosen with a view to achieving the most favourable presentation of a fund.
Huhmann and Bhattacharyya (2005) found that most mutual fund (unit trust) advertisements
did not provide the information necessary for informed choices.Advertisers were found to use
techniques that increase the likelihood that the advertisements are noticed but decrease the
likelihood that they are read.The advertisements were concerned with conveying perceptions of
success regardless of the accuracy of those perceptions.
Although there are publications that show performance ﬁgures for all funds in a company’s
range over standard time periods (e.g.Money Management and Money Observer in the UK),there are
still ways in which investment companies can legally manipulate information. One possibility is
‘burying the dead’.This entails merging poorly performing funds into stronger ones.Suppose that
a company has a ‘UK Special Situations’ fund that has performed poorly over a number of years.
Also suppose that the company has a ‘UK Growth’ fund that has performed well. If the company
merges the special situations fund into the growth fund, the poorly performing fund disappears
from the performance ﬁgures leaving only the strong fund.Investors in the special situations fund
would have suffered poor performance but no current performance ﬁgures would reveal that.
Jordan and Kaas (2002) investigated the potential of using behavioural ﬁnance biases in the
construction of advertisements.They found that the anchoring bias could be used to inﬂuence
expectations of fund returns. Including a high percentage in the advertisement, even if the
percentage is not related to investment returns, will raise the consumers’ expectations of fund
return.They found that the representativeness bias could be used. Representativeness entails the
use of stereotypes, and if the investment company is reputable and well known it conforms to a
positive stereotype. Funds managed by the company are seen as representative of the company.
Jordan and Kaas found that funds managed by reputable,well-known investment companies were
seen as relatively less risky.They also investigated the affect heuristic,which is the effect of positive
feelings towards a product.They found that if advertising could engender positive emotions
associated with a fund,the fund would be seen as relatively less risky.It was found that advertising
could be effective,in using the behavioural biases,on both knowledgeable and naive investors.The
effects were greater in the case of naive investors.
MAXIMIN AND MINIMAX
The measurement of risk by means of the standard deviation of a normal distribution of possible
outcomes assumes a symmetrical attitude to risk. A 50% probability of loss is seen as fully
compensated by a 50% probability of gain. Prospect theory suggests that this is not so, and that
the trauma of loss is greater than the pleasure of proﬁt. In the presence of such loss-aversion,
standard deviation may not be the most appropriate measure of risk.Maximin and minimax provide
alternative measures of risk.
The maximin approach to decision-making seeks to obtain the highest minimum value
(‘maximin’comes from the ‘maximum minimum’value).Someone using such a decision-making
criterion may choose to measure risk in terms of the maximum loss.
The minimax regret criterion seeks to minimise opportunity cost and implies that risk should
be measured as the maximum opportunity loss.Consider an investor who needs to choose between
investing wholly in deposits, an equal combination of deposits and shares, and wholly in shares.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS

Suppose that there are three possible outcomes:a 20% rise in share prices,stable share prices,and
a 20% fall in share prices.Table 2.5 depicts the outcomes from an investment of £100 for each of
the three share price scenarios.The opportunity loss relative to the most successful strategy, for
each share price scenario, is shown in brackets.
The minimax regret criterion suggests the investment strategy that has the lowest maximum
opportunity loss. In the case of Table 2.5, it suggests an even split between shares and deposits.
Risk is being measured as the maximum opportunity loss (10 in the case of the chosen strategy,
20 in the cases of the other two strategies).This approach is concerned with minimising regret
(‘minimax’ regret comes from the ‘minimum maximum’ regret).
CONCLUSION
Personal investment decisions are choices made under constraint. An obvious constraint is the
amount of money available for investment,which is affected by wealth,income,debts,and personal
(including family) commitments. Another constraint is limited knowledge of the investment
options. Investment objectives include growth, income, low risk, and liquidity (liquidity is the
ability to turn the investment into cash quickly and cheaply).These objectives may entail trade-
offs; for example high prospective growth may involve high risk.
Risk is not a simple characteristic.There are many types of risk. Some investments that are
commonly seen as risk-free do carry risks. For example, building society and bank accounts are
typically subject to the risk that interest rates might fall or that inﬂation would reduce the purchasing
power of the invested money. Some risks are not obvious. For example there is the risk that an
investment manager may perform relatively badly;this is known as management risk and provides
a reason for choosing index tracker funds that simply aim to follow a stock market index (such as
the FTSE 100) without attempting to outperform the stock market (see Chapter 9 on mutual funds).
People may choose to retain, avoid, reduce, or transfer risks. Diversiﬁcation is a major way of
reducing risk and entails holding a wide range of different investments in anticipation that losses
on some would be offset by gains on others (see Chapter 13 on portfolio diversiﬁcation). In this
context investors should be aware that residential property,occupational pension rights,and human
capital (earning power) are components of their wealth portfolios. Insurance transfers risks to an
insurance company. Some institutional investments, such as stock market investments that

guarantee that the capital cannot be lost, may use derivatives (particularly options) to insure the
capital against loss (see Chapter 34 on structured products).
Investors should be aware of their psychological biases when choosing investments.They should
also be aware of how marketing can seek to exploit their psychological biases. There are
psychological biases that entail self-deception.No one is perfectly rational.Everyone has a tendency
to see what they want to see, and remember what they want to remember. Self-image can affect
perceptions of investment decisions, and the outcomes of those decisions, just as it affects
perceptions of many aspects of people’s lives.
People are bombarded with more information than the human mind can handle.This has
implications for many decisions, including investment decisions. Mental short cuts (rules-of-
thumb),known as heuristic simpliﬁcations,are used.Everyone uses heuristic simpliﬁcations,even
when they are unaware of them.People are often reluctant to accept that events occur by chance,
and attempt to think of reasons and causes. People are often slow to change their opinions in the
light of new evidence.
A person’s ideas and behaviour are affected by the ideas and behaviour of others.There is a
tendency to conform to the standards and opinions of people with whom we interact.There can
be forms of ‘groupthink’ where all members of a group think and behave in similar ways.These
social inﬂuences affect investment decisions as well as other decisions. Likewise moods and
emotions affect investment decisions.Personality characteristics affect the level of saving,the types
of investment into which the savings are put,and the willingness to sell or change those investments.
People vary in terms of whether they are primarily concerned with the level of their wealth,
changes in the level of their wealth, or avoiding the regret of making bad decisions.

Interest rates and money
market investments
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide readers with the knowledge required to be able to:
1. Distinguish between simple interest and compound interest.
2. Calculate average compound rates of interest.
3. Understand the nature of variable and ﬁxed interest rates.
4. Be familiar with the convention for quoting interest rates on an annualised basis.
5. Distinguish between nominal and real interest rates.
6. Calculate interest rates and discount rates.
7. Distinguish between interest yield and total return.
8. Identify, and evaluate, money market investments.
9. Understand the implications of holding foreign currency deposits.
10. Compare the prospective returns from money market investments and stock market
investments.
Money market investments tend to be short term (maturities of a year or less) and low risk,in the
sense that their values are not strongly subject to market ﬂuctuations.The most common form of
money market investment is the deposit, although there are other forms such as bills and
commercial paper.The return on deposits is in the form of interest.There are a number of features
of interest rates and interest payments of which investors should be aware.
SIMPLE INTEREST AND COMPOUND INTEREST
Suppose that £100 is invested for two years at an interest rate of 10% p.a.At the end of year 1,the
£100 will have grown to £110 [£100  1.1].
The £110 is invested at 10% for year 2 and grows to £121 [£100  1.1  1.1].The interest
of £21 includes £20 interest on the original investment of £100. This is known as simple
interest.
55

There is also £1,which is interest on the ﬁrst £10 interest.This interest on interest is known as
compound interest.
The value of £121 at the end of two years is known as the future value of the initial £100.
When considering deposits with interest payable more frequently than once a year, the effective
interest rate is higher than the simple rate.Increased frequency of compounding raises the effective
rate. For example, an investment of £100 at an interest rate of 6% payable annually leads to the
receipt of £106 at the end of the year. If the interest were payable six monthly, the value of the
investment at the end of the year would be £100  (1.03)  (1.03)  £106.09.There is interest

Compound interest becomes more important as time and interest rates increase.

on interest since the £3 interest from the ﬁrst six months is reinvested for the second six months.
If the interest were payable three monthly,the value of the investment at the end of the year would
be £100  (1.015)  (1.015)  (1.015)  (1.015)  £106.14.A high frequency of interest
payment entails more interest on interest and hence a greater value at the end of the year.The
effective interest rate is alternatively known as the Annual Equivalent Rate (AER). In the UK
providers of savings products (retail deposits) are required to quote the AER so that savers can easily
make comparisons between the alternatives available.
When considering deposits covering periods of more than one year,simple annual returns are
based on dividing the returns over the period by the number of years in the period. For example
if a deposit produces returns of 0%,10%,and 20% in successive years,the average simple rate of
interest would be (0%  10%  20%)/3  10%.
Such an approach ignores the reinvestment of interest returns during the period of investment.
The compound rate of interest is based on receipts being reinvested and producing their own
returns.The average compound rate of interest would be (1.0  1.1  1.2)1/31  0.097 i.e.
9.7% p.a.When compounding (interest on interest) is allowed for, the interest rate required
for the realisation of a particular sum of money is lower (in this case 9.7% p.a. rather than
10% p.a.).
THE AVERAGE COMPOUND RATE OF INTEREST
The average compound rate of interest is the average rate of interest over a period of time taking
account of compounding.It is the rate of interest which,if applied each year of an investment,would
produce the same ﬁnal outcome as the succession of interest rates actually experienced.
It is a geometric average. A geometric average is calculated by multiplying together a series
of values, and then ﬁnding the appropriate root (this is illustrated by Exercises 3.1, 3.2, 3.3,
3.4, and 3.5).
Alternatively the geometric average, the average compound rate of return, can be calculated
as a root of the investment return over the full period. In this case the equation is:
R  (Final Value of Investment/Initial Investment)1/n 1
where R is the average compound rate of return and n is the number of years for which the
investment is made. Using the power of 1/n is equivalent to taking the nth root. For example if a
deposit grows from £100 to £130 over ﬁve years the average compound rate of return would be
calculated as:
R  (£130/£100)1/5 1  0.0539 as a decimal, or 5.39% p.a. as a percentage.
The 1 is subtracted as a means of removing the value of the original investment since only the
interest is being calculated.

rate of interest?
(b) If the bank account paid interest rates of 3%,6%,and 9% in successive years what would the

Answer
(a) √(1.03)(1.06) 1  √1.0918 1  1.0449 1  0.0449 as a decimal, i.e. 4.49% p.a. as
a percentage. (Note that √1.0918 could alternatively be expressed as 1.09181/2.)
(b) [(1.03)(1.06)(1.09)]1/3 1  1.19011/3 1  1.0597 1  0.0597 as a decimal,i.e.5.97%
p.a. as a percentage. (Note that 1.19011/3 is the cube root of 1.1901.)
Further examples of the calculation of average compound rates of return are provided in exercises
3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.
VARIABLE AND FIXED INTEREST RATES
A deposit at a variable interest rate is subject to interest rate variations as rates in the money
markets change.Typically the bank can make the change at any time with little or no notice. Such
deposits are subject to income risk.Income risk relates to the uncertainty as to the level of income
that an investor derives from a deposit.A fall in interest rates entails a fall in income receipts.
A ﬁxed rate deposit guarantees the interest rate for a speciﬁed period.For example a ﬁve-year
ﬁxed rate deposit will pay the speciﬁed interest rate for the full ﬁve years, irrespective of what
happens to interest rates in the money markets.
Both of these types of deposit typically pay, or accumulate, interest on an annual basis.The
compounding of interest is normally on a predetermined date,often the anniversary of the deposit.
An intermediate investment between these two is a deposit on which the interest is ﬁxed for a
period,after which it is revised.A typical example would be a six-month rollover deposit on which
the interest rate is ﬁxed for six months after which it is changed,in line with money market rates.
There would be a succession of six-month periods, during each period the interest rate is ﬁxed.
At the end of each period the interest rate is reset and the new rate is ﬁxed for the following six
months. In such a case interest is payable, or accumulates, twice a year. Compounding would be
six monthly.
CONVENTION FOR QUOTING INTEREST RATES
The wholesale money markets are the markets in which institutions such as banks, building
societies, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, large corporations, and
government bodies lend to, and borrow from, one another. In the wholesale money markets
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
58

interest rates are always quoted on a per annum (p.a., i.e. per year) basis. The interest rate
is quoted per annum whatever the period of the investment. If the investment period, or
frequency of compounding, is less than a year the annual interest rate is multiplied by the
fraction of the year. For example, a six-month deposit with an interest rate of 5% p.a. pays
interest of half 5%, i.e. 2.5%, over the six months. If the period is three months and the
quoted rate is 6% p.a., the interest paid each three months is a quarter of 6%, i.e. 1.5%. In
such cases the effective annual rate is greater than the quoted rate because of compounding
(1.015  1.015  1.015  1.015  1.0614 which is 6.14% p.a.). In the case of retail
deposits for personal savings it is the effective annual rate, i.e. the annual equivalent rate (AER),
that must be quoted.
If the investment period is longer than a year,interest rates are regarded as compounded annually
(unless a shorter period is speciﬁed).For example a three-year investment at 7% p.a.is treated as
paying interest annually at 7%.So at the end of three years an investment of £100 would be worth
£100  1.07  1.07  1.07  £122.50.
NOMINAL AND REAL RATES OF INTEREST
If inﬂation is expected, some interest is required simply to compensate for the expected rise in
prices.The real interest is the yield net of compensation for inﬂation.The real interest rate measures
the returns from an investment in terms of enhanced purchasing power.
For example if the rate of interest is 3% p.a., a deposit of £100 will grow to £103 over a year.
If prices rise by 3% over the year, £103 at the end of the year will buy the same amount as £100
bought at the beginning of the year.The investor makes no real gain from the deposit.The real
interest rate is zero.
The real interest rate is given by the expression:
Rr  (1  Rn)/(1  i) 1
where Rr is the real interest rate, Rn is the nominal interest rate, and i is the rate of inﬂation.
The nominal interest rate (alternatively known as the money interest rate) is the rate quoted by
banks, building societies, and other deposit takers.
In the previous example the real rate of interest can be calculated as:
Rr  (1.03)/(1.03) 1  0
i.e.the real rate of interest is zero.If the nominal rate of interest were 7% p.a.,the real interest
rate would be:
Rr  (1.07)/(1.03) 1  0.039 i.e. 3.9% p.a.
Note that in this case simply subtracting the rate of inﬂation from the nominal rate of interest
gives a close approximation to the real rate of interest. It should also be remembered that, when
evaluating prospective investments, it is the rate of inﬂation expected to occur during the period
of the investment that should be used in the calculation of the real rate of interest.

(iii) (0.97765)0.2 1  0.0045 i.e. 0.45% p.a.
According to the Fisher Effect, nominal interest rates exceed real interest rates by the amount
required to compensate for expected inﬂation. Laatsch and Klein (2003) found a relationship
between changes in nominal interest rates and changes in inﬂation.Their evidence was consistent
with a one-to-one relationship between changes in nominal interest rates and changes in inﬂation.
They found the changes in nominal interest rates and changes in inﬂation to be simultaneous.
Measuring Inﬂation – RPI and CPI
In the UK two measures of inﬂation are frequently quoted; the Retail Price Index (RPI) and the
Consumer Price Index (CPI).The RPI is used for indexing state beneﬁts such as pensions,interest
on national savings products such as index-linked savings certiﬁcates, and payments on index-
linked gilts.The CPI is used as the target inﬂation rate for Bank of England monetary policy.
Both the RPI and CPI are based on hypothetical shopping baskets containing representative
selections of the goods and services that people buy. Both indices are calculated monthly as
measures of the movement in the price of the shopping basket. It should be noted that it is highly
unlikely that any individual, or household, would buy exactly the same combination of goods and
services as the hypothetical shopping basket contains. Since everyone has a unique pattern of
expenditure, everyone will experience a different rate of inﬂation. Prices of goods and services
do not all rise at the same percentage rate.Published inﬂation ﬁgures are averages.Individuals and
households will experience inﬂation rates that differ from the averages in a way that depends upon
which goods and services they buy, and in what proportions. For example at the time of writing
there is concern that low-income pensioners have an inﬂation rate that exceeds the published rates
since a high proportion of their expenditures is on electricity and gas, which have experienced
relatively high rates of price increase.
There are differences between the two inﬂation measures in terms of which consumers, and
which goods and services,are covered.The RPI excludes the top 4% of people,in terms of income,
and pensioners dependent on state beneﬁts. So about 14% of UK households are excluded in the
sense that their expenditure patterns are not considered when determining which goods and
services should be covered, and in what proportions.The CPI excludes some important housing
costs,such as mortgage interest payments and council tax.According to statistics published by the
Ofﬁce for National Statistics, at the time of writing (early 2007) such housing costs explained
about 1.21% p.a. of the 1.78% p.a. excess of the RPI over the CPI.
INTEREST RATES AND MONEY MARKET INVESTMENTS

Another factor that helps to explain the difference between the rates is the method of averaging.
The RPI uses arithmetic averages whereas the CPI uses geometric averages (Ofﬁce for National
Statistics 2006).The arithmetic averaging of the RPI makes no allowance for the possibility that
consumers would switch between brands and products as their relative prices change. The
geometric averaging of the CPI allows for the possibility that people will make some switches
from goods whose prices rise rapidly to those whose prices rise more slowly.This reduces the CPI
relative to the RPI and,in early 2007,was estimated to account for about 0.55% of the difference
between the two measures of inﬂation.The difference in averaging techniques would normally tend
to reduce the CPI relative to the RPI.
RATES OF INTEREST VERSUS RATES OF DISCOUNT
Some investments,such as Treasury bills,pay no interest.Capital gain is the only source of return.
Bills promise the payment of a speciﬁc sum of money at maturity and provide a return to investors
by selling at a lower price.The price difference is known as the discount.The percentage rate of
discount on bills is expressed relative to the sum payable at maturity whereas the interest on
deposits is expressed relative to the sum invested.As a result a particular rate of discount is worth
more than the rate of interest of the same percentage.
As an illustration consider a discount rate of 10% and an interest rate of 10%. If the maturity
value of the bill is £100, a discount rate of 10% implies a current price of £90.The 10% discount
is applied to the £100 maturity value and is worth £10.An interest rate of 10% would be applied
to the current price and is therefore worth £9.A discount rate of 10% is equivalent to an interest
rate of (£10/£90)  100  11.1%.
EXERCISE 3.6
If the current rate of discount on Treasury bills is 11% p.a.,calculate the price of a £50,000 91-day
bill with 60 days to redemption.What would its price be in four weeks’ time if p.a. discount rates
remain unchanged?
Answer
The 60-day rate of discount is
(60/365)  11%  1.81%
So the price of the Treasury bill is:
[(100  1.81)/100]  £50,000  £49,096
After four weeks there would be 60  28  32 days to redemption.The 32-day rate of discount is:
(32/365)  11%  0.96%

So the price of the Treasury bill would be:
[(100  0.96)/100]  £50,000  £49,518
INTEREST YIELD AND TOTAL RETURN
When money is deposited in a bank account it leads to a ﬂow of interest payments, and these
payments are the only source of return on the deposit. Other investments have two sources of
return: not only are there income ﬂows such as interest payments but there are also capital gains
or losses.In the case of deposits there are no capital gains or losses,but investments such as bonds
are subject to price ﬂuctuations and gains/losses resulting from them.
The interest yield (also known as the coupon yield) on a bond is calculated as the annual coupon
divided by the current bond price.The coupon is the periodic payment to the investor where the
period is typically either six months or a year.The total return on a bond is known as the redemption
yield.The redemption yield incorporates both the coupon yield and the prospective capital gain.
Consider a bond that pays a coupon of £4 every six months (and hence £8 per year),is currently
priced at £97, and matures in one year at which point the investor will be paid £100 by the issuer
of the bond.The interest yield is:
£8/£97  0.0825 i.e. 8.25% p.a.
In addition there will be a capital gain of £100  £97  £3.As a rate of return the capital gain
is £3/£97  0.0309 i.e. 3.09% p.a.The redemption yield (total return) is 8.25%  3.09% 
11.34% p.a.
SHORT MATURITY (MONEY MARKET) INVESTMENTS
A variation on the normal deposit is the certiﬁcate of deposit (CD).A bank receiving a deposit may
issue a CD to the depositor stating that at maturity (which is frequently three months from issue)
the deposit plus interest will be paid to the holder (bearer) of the CD.An advantage of a certiﬁcate
of deposit to the investor, as compared to a normal time deposit, is that it can be sold and hence
is more liquid.When making a three-month bank deposit, the investor loses access to the money
for three months.When buying a three-month CD, the investor has an asset that can be sold to
another investor if the money is needed before three months have elapsed.This enhanced liquidity
leads investors to the acceptance of rates of interest below the rates for ordinary deposits of the
same maturity. Banks are thus able to borrow at lower interest rates than would otherwise be
applicable to the period of the deposit.
Certiﬁcates of deposit are used in the wholesale, rather than the retail, money markets.
The wholesale money markets deal only in large sums, for example multiples of £1 million
(whereas the retail money markets deal in any size of investment).As a result investors in CDs
tend to be companies, banks, and other ﬁnancial institutions. Retail investors would normally
have access to such instruments through collective investment vehicles such as unit trusts or
insurance funds.
INTEREST RATES AND MONEY MARKET INVESTMENTS

Another form of short-term investment is the bill.Bills are instruments that can be sold in the
money market prior to maturity.Unlike deposits bills do not have an interest yield.The return that
a bill provides to its holder arises from the fact that it is bought at a discount.The issuer of a bill
promises to pay a speciﬁed sum of money at its maturity date.An investor buying the bill will pay
a smaller sum for it and thus obtains a return in the form of a capital gain.
Bills may be issued by central government,in which case they are often known as Treasury bills
(e.g.in the UK and the United States),and typically have maturities of three or six months.Treasury
bills are sold by auction (tender).There are two forms of auction used. In a bid price auction
investors pay the price that they bid.In a striking price auction all successful bidders pay the same
price. In both cases the bills are sold to the highest bidders.The bid price auction is probably the
most frequent type.
Bills may also be issued by ﬁrms as a means of short-term borrowing,normally with maturities
of 12 months or less. Such private sector bills include bills of exchange. Bills of exchange are
used for trade credit. The buyer of the goods signs a bill drawn up by the seller. The buyer
thereby promises to pay,the holder of the bill,for the goods at the end of a speciﬁed time period.
If a bank guarantees payment (against default by the trade signatory), the bill is known as a bank
bill and is seen as having a lower risk of default. Bills can be sold, at a discount, in the money
markets.In this way the suppliers of goods can receive money immediately whilst the buyers defer
payment.
Commercial paper is similar to a bill of exchange,except that it is issued by a corporate borrower
or a bank for general borrowing rather than for ﬁnancing a speciﬁc trade transaction.An issuer of
commercial paper will set up a programme with a speciﬁed time period (for example ﬁve years)
and a stated borrowing ceiling (for example £500 million).The ﬁrm would not normally borrow
up to the ceiling immediately, but would issue commercial paper over time as the need arose.
Periodically paper would be sold,or repaid,subject to the borrowing ceiling not being exceeded.
A bank (or several banks) would be appointed to deal with issues.The bank dealers contact potential
investors in order to place the commercial paper. The market is wholesale with minimum
denominations that put it out of reach of most individual investors. Retail investors wishing to
access this market would normally do so by means of institutional investments such as unit trust
money market funds.
Money market investments have two roles in a portfolio. One role is as an investment.The
other role is as a lubricant.Typically there are constant inﬂows and outﬂows of cash.However the
inﬂows and outﬂows are not synchronised. Some periods have net inﬂows, and other periods
experience net outﬂows. Money market investments (including conventional bank deposits) are
a means of bridging the time interval between inﬂows and outﬂows, and thereby operate as a
lubricant.Also some investments are not continuously available and money market investments
may be held with a view to turning them into cash when opportunities arise. Such occasional
investment opportunities include properties and venture capital.
For individual investors the dominant form of money market investment is the bank or building
society deposit. Minhas and Jacobs (1996) found that the interest rate was not the only factor of
importance to such investors; it was not even the most important.They found that the personal
service obtained at their bank or building society branch was more important to investors than
the interest rate received. Interest rates were found to be the second most important factor, and
easy accessibility to cash was another signiﬁcant factor.

EXHIBIT 3.1
LEGAL & GENERAL CASH TRUST
OBJECTIVE
The investment objective of this Trust is to secure a high yield from those deposits or short-term
instruments in which investment is permissible for a money market fund.
The manager expects generally to invest in overnight and short-term deposits but may exercise
such flexibility within the objective as deemed desirable.
Total expense ratio: 0.50% p.a.*
The total expense ratio is the ratio of the Trust’s operating costs (excluding overdraft interest
and transaction charges) to the average net assets of the Trust.
Costanzo and Ashton (2006) found that there was reluctance, on the part of the suppliers of
ﬁnancial services,to be innovative in the provision of money market investments for retail investors.
They found recognition, on the part of ﬁnancial services suppliers, that the development of
innovative products is expensive in terms of time and resources.The suppliers were also found to
regard investors as conservative, and hence resistant to innovation. Investors were seen as being
unable to understand innovative investment products.There appeared to have been no committed
effort to develop new types of deposit.This lack of innovation may seem disappointing in the
light of the development of interest rate derivatives markets, and the potential for innovation
that they could provide (see Chapters 44 and 45 on interest rate futures and interest rate
swaps, respectively).
Interest rates in the wholesale money market may be higher than those in the retail money
market. One reason is lower administration costs arising from the fact that the wholesale money
market deals only in large sums of money.For example it is cheaper to administer 100 deposits of
£1 million than a million deposits of £100.One way in which retail investors can access wholesale
money market investments is through money market institutional investments such as unit trusts.
Exhibit 3.1 illustrates a money market unit trust.

In Exhibit 3.1 some of the banks are based outside the UK. Nevertheless they take deposits in
sterling,as well as many other currencies.For example National Australia Bank takes deposits not
only in Australian dollars but also in many other currencies,including the pound sterling.However,
UK investors can choose to make investments in foreign currencies.
FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS
An alternative to a deposit in an investor’s national currency is a deposit in a foreign currency.This
alternative may seem attractive if the foreign currency interest rate is high relative to the home
currency interest rate. Investors should be wary of such an alternative for two reasons.The ﬁrst
reason is based on what is known as the ‘International Fisher Effect’.
According to the International Fisher Effect,high foreign currency interest rates tend to be offset
by a fall in the value of the foreign currency.Although the difference between domestic and foreign
interest rates is unlikely to be exactly matched by exchange rate movements, deviations in one
direction are as likely as deviations in the other.The expected interest rate, net of the effects of
currency movements, should on average equal the rate available on domestic currency deposits.
The second reason for being wary of foreign currency deposits is the uncertainty of exchange
rate movements.The net rate of return from a foreign currency deposit could turn out to be either
above or below the rate on a domestic currency deposit, depending on how the exchange rate
moves.Since it is impossible to predict exchange rate movements,there is risk involved.So foreign
currency deposits provide risk without any expectation of a higher rate of return.
The same reasoning applies to borrowing in foreign currencies.This was highlighted in the
1980s when some UK residents took out mortgages in Swiss francs on the grounds that the Swiss
franc interest rate was lower than the pound sterling interest rate. Unfortunately for those
borrowers, the Swiss franc strengthened against the pound.The result was a dramatic increase in
the value of the mortgage debts, when measured in terms of pounds.

It may seem tempting to try to control the exchange rate risk by taking out forward contracts
to guarantee future exchange rates.Whilst this reduces the currency risk, it does not ensure the
beneﬁts of a higher foreign currency interest rate. Forward exchange rates embody the currency
price changes suggested by the International Fisher Effect.An interest rate advantage would be
precisely offset by a forward discount that precisely offsets the interest rate advantage.The forward
exchange rate guarantees that the currency price movement offsets the interest rate difference with
the effect that the interest rate on the foreign currency is rendered identical to the rate on the
domestic currency.This is known as ‘Interest Rate Parity’ and is a relationship that holds very
closely among the major currencies.
RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF MONEY MARKET INVESTMENTS
The outcome of investing in money market investments (such as building society accounts) needs
to be compared with other investments,such as stock market investments.Using the endowment
equation (as shown in Chapter 5) it is possible to calculate the outcome of investing on a regular
basis over a period of time.Table 3.1 shows the result of investing £1,000 a year at various interest
rates over periods of 20 and 40 years.
Over 20 years to July 2006 the rates of return from stock market investment (as represented
by the FTSE All-Share Index) and building society accounts (based on accounts paying relatively
high interest rates) were as shown by Table 3.2.These rates are based on data from Money Management
magazine,August 1996 and August 2006 issues.Table 3.2 also shows the results of investing £1,000
a year for 40 years (with net interest and dividends reinvested, assuming that the average rates of
return over 40 years equal the averages over 20 years).
These numbers are money values. In other words they take no account of the tendency for
inﬂation to reduce the purchasing power of money.When rates of return (rates of interest)
are adjusted for the effects of inﬂation, the results are real rates of return.The Barclays Capital

Equity Gilt Study (2006) provides the real annual rates of return on equities (i.e.shares) and cash
(i.e. money market investments) in the UK over periods of 20, 50, and 105 years to 2006, as
shown in Table 3.3.
Investing £1,000 a year for 50 years in equities (with net dividends reinvested) would have
produced £354,946 in real terms.Investing £1,000 a year in money market investments (with net
interest reinvested) would have produced £64,463 in real terms.Money market investments,such
as building society or bank accounts,may appear to be safe but history indicates that better returns
are available from investing in shares.
The amount by which the return on shares exceeds the return on money market investments is
referred to as the equity risk premium. It is named as such because the additional return on shares
(equities) is seen as the reward for accepting the higher risk of investing in shares.The Barclays
Capital ﬁgures in Table 3.3 suggest that over a recent 50-year period the equity risk premium was
6.6%  2%  4.6% p.a.This is lower than most estimates relating to other time periods. For
example Dimson and Marsh (2001) estimated that over the period 1955–2000 the equity risk
premiums for the UK,the United States,Germany,and Japan were all in the 6.2% to 7.0% p.a.range.
The comparison of performances should take account of risk as well as return. In relation to
risk money market investments, such as bank and building society deposits, are superior to stock
market investments.The value of £1,000 deposited in a bank cannot fall.The same amount invested
in shares can fall in value.The time span of the investment is important when considering risk.
Figures published in the Daily Telegraph (26 February 2005) and adapted by Rutterford (2007)
consider the frequency of outperformance of equities in the UK,relative to deposits,over various
investment horizons between 1899 and 2004.
The time periods (investment horizons) considered ranged from 2 years to 18 years.There
were 104 two-year periods (1899–1901, 1900–2, 1901–3, etc.) and equities outperformed
deposits during 66% of those periods.When considering ten-year time periods, there were 96
periods (1899–1909, 1900–10, 1901–11, etc.) and equities outperformed deposits in 93% of
those periods.In the case of 18-year investment horizons (1899–1917,1900–18,1901–19,etc.),
there were 88 periods and equities outperformed deposits during 87 of those 88 periods.Investing
in shares is more risky than investing in deposits but that relative risk appears to diminish as the
investment horizon gets longer.

CONCLUSION
Interest rates are varied in nature,and an investor who is presented with a rate of interest must be
aware of its nature.There is a difference between simple interest and compound interest.When
calculating an average rate of interest over a period of years, the effect of compounding needs to
be taken into account.There is sometimes a choice between variable and ﬁxed rates of interest.A
distinction should be made between nominal and real interest rates.The return on some money
market investments, in particular bills, is quoted as a rate of discount rather than as a rate of
interest.The investor should also be aware that the interest yield on an investment is not necessarily
the total return on that investment.
Money market investments have maturities of one year or less.They include CDs, bills, and
commercial paper.Bank and building society deposits are usually money market investments,and
may be in foreign currencies. Historically money market investments have provided much lower
average returns than stock market investments.
Although money market investments are typically seen as low risk, it will be seen in later
chapters that they bear substantial amounts of some forms of risk (particularly income risk and
inﬂation risk). Most people limit their money market investments to bank and building society
deposits. However other types of money market investment can be made by individuals,
particularly through the medium of institutional money market investments such as money market
unit trusts and pension funds.Although money market unit trusts,OEICs,and pension funds may
obtain higher rates of interest than individuals can obtain directly, investors should assure
themselves that the higher rates are not eliminated (or more than eliminated) by charges made by
fund managers.
Investors in the money markets should beware of ‘money illusion’.Money illusion is the failure
to realise that inﬂation erodes the purchasing power of money.Someone who suffers from money
illusion fails to see the distinction between nominal and real rates of interest.

Investing in bonds
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide:
1. An understanding of the nature of bonds.
2. An appreciation of the role of bond rating agencies.
3. A knowledge of the alternative forms of coupon payment.
4. An understanding of the various types of government bonds, as illustrated by UK gilts.
5. Knowledge of what is meant by bond strips, bond yields, and bond price volatility.
6. An appreciation of the nature of preference shares.
7. Information about the relative performance of bonds.
GOVERNMENT BONDS, CORPORATE BONDS, AND EUROBONDS
Bonds are used for long-term borrowing by the issuer. Central governments are major issuers of
bonds (and in the UK government bonds are called gilt-edged securities,or gilts).Bonds are issued
in a wide variety of forms. However, most government bonds conform to a conventional format.
A conventional government bond pays a ﬁxed sum of money, known as the coupon, at regular
intervals such as every six months. It has a deﬁnite redemption date on which the government is
obliged to pay the nominal,or par,value of the bond to its owner.Its market price is expressed in
relation to its nominal or par value. For example pounds per £100 nominal (so a market price of
£96 means that £96 must be paid for every £100 to be repaid at redemption).
Governments are not the only issuers of bonds. In particular, ﬁrms issue corporate bonds.
Corporate bonds vary very considerably in terms of their risk.Some corporate bonds are secured
against assets of the company that issued them, whereas other bonds are unsecured. In the UK,
bonds secured on the assets of the issuing company are known as debentures.Property companies
often issue debentures. Bonds that are not secured are referred to as loan stock. Banks are major
issuers of loan stock.The fact that unsecured bonds do not provide their holders with a claim on
the assets of the issuing ﬁrm in the event of default is normally compensated for by means of a higher
rate of coupon payment.

There are two types of debenture. Mortgage (ﬁxed charge) debentures entail a ﬁxed charge;
which means that there are speciﬁc assets that bondholders can sell (arrange to be sold by a receiver)
in order to reclaim their money in the event of default. Floating charge debentures allow the
company to change the assets used as security.The company can sell the relevant assets so long as
it replaces them with equally satisfactory assets. (Note that this meaning of the term ‘debenture’
is UK speciﬁc.)
Sometimes there are bonds with differing priorities of payment in the event of the issuer
becoming insolvent.Bonds with a high priority for repayment are often referred to as being senior
debt, whilst those bonds that would be redeemed only after the senior debt (and only if sufﬁcient
funds remain) would be termed subordinated debt. The greater risk of non-redemption of
subordinated debt is compensated for by a higher rate of coupon yield.
When new corporate bonds are issued, their yields are generally set with reference to
government bonds. Corporate bonds offer a spread over the government bond yield in order to
compensate for the greater risk of default. Companies, unlike the governments of developed
countries, can ﬁnd themselves in a position in which they cannot pay the money owing to the
holders of their bonds.
Bond issues are typically credit rated.There are credit rating agencies (such as Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s) that give ratings to bond issues. A high credit rating indicates a low risk of
default, whereas a low rating is suggestive of a high default risk. Low credit ratings are associated
with high rates of yield. Bonds with very low credit ratings and hence subject to very high risk of
default are often referred to as junk bonds.
Many corporate bonds have call features.This means that the issuer has the right to redeem the
bonds before the maturity date.A bond is likely to be called if interest rates fall below the coupon
rate, since the issuer could then redeem the bond with money borrowed at a lower coupon rate.
This is to the disadvantage of investors since they can only reinvest the money at a lower rate of
yield.This potential disadvantage would be compensated for by means of a higher coupon rate on
callable bonds.
Some corporate bonds are putable.This means that the investor has the right to sell the bond
to the issuer, at a predetermined price, before the maturity date. Investors might exercise this
right when interest rates rise so that the proceeds can be reinvested at a higher rate of yield.The
right to sell the bond at a predetermined price implies that the investor is protected against price
falls.Since the right to sell provides potential advantages to investors,it would be offset by a lower
coupon rate on the bond.
In the UK the corporate bond market is much smaller than the government bond (gilts) market.
The value of corporate bonds in the market is less than 10% of the value of outstanding gilts.
Frequently a gilt issue will have more than £5 billion of the issue in the market, corporate bond
issues rarely exceed £0.5 billion.Bond liquidity is the ability to trade a bond easily without having
to make price concessions (e.g.lowering the price in order to attract a buyer).The relatively small
size of corporate bond issues can render them illiquid.While gilts are usually very liquid, many
corporate bonds seldom trade.To compensate for the lack of liquidity, corporate bonds tend to
have higher yields than government bonds.
Eurobonds are bonds denominated in a currency that is not the currency of the country in which
the bonds are issued. So a bond denominated in sterling but sold in Paris would be a eurosterling
bond. Eurobonds are often issued in several ﬁnancial centres at the same time, for example a US
INVESTING IN BONDS
73

dollar eurobond might be simultaneously issued in London, Paris, Sydney, Hong Kong, and
Singapore (the preﬁx ‘euro’ has no geographical or currency signiﬁcance). Eurobonds are often
bearer bonds.This means that coupons and principal are payable to the holder (bearer) of a bond,
and bonds are not registered in the names of investors.This allows investors to retain anonymity.
Eurobonds tap the large stateless pool of cash and are traded in a secondary market of screens
and telephones.Eurobond markets are volatile and little regulated.They can become illiquid since
there is no obligation on any body to make a market in eurobonds.In other words there is liquidity
risk;in adverse market circumstances,holders of bonds may be unable to sell them because there
is no one willing to buy.
Eurobonds are not the only form of international bond. Bonds may be issued in the country
whose currency is being borrowed, by a borrower in another country.Those bonds are known as
foreign bonds. So a German company might borrow Canadian dollars by issuing Canadian dollar
bonds in Canada. Such bonds sometimes have names that symbolise the country whose currency
is being borrowed.For example bonds issued in the United States are called  Yankees,bonds issued
in Britain are known as Bulldogs, and those issued in Japan are called Samurais.
DEFAULT RISK AND BOND RATING AGENCIES
A bond rating is an assessment of the default risk of a bond by an independent agency.The ratings
reﬂect only default risk, which is the risk that the issuer of the bond will fail to meet coupon
payments or the repayment of principal.The ratings do not reﬂect other types of risk such as
interest rate risk (which includes the risk that interest rate changes will cause capital losses to
holders of bonds). Ratings are speciﬁc to a bond issue, rather than to the issuer.
There are a number of bond rating agencies worldwide,but the global market is dominated by
two agencies.These are S&P (Standard and Poor’s) and Moody’s.The rating agencies assign debt
issues to risk categories and label those categories with letters.Table 4.1 shows the letter grades
used by S&P and Moody’s.
Debt rated BBB by S&P (or Baa, by Moody’s) and above is classed as investment grade. Bonds
rated BB (or Ba) and below are classed as speculative grade.Speculative grade bonds are alternatively
referred to as high yield or junk bonds.The ﬁrst two categories (AAA/Aaa and AA/Aa) indicate a
very strong capacity to pay coupons and repay principal.The next four categories (A to B) indicate
that the issuer is currently able to meet payments but has some susceptibility to adverse changes in
economic conditions.The issues in the next two categories (CCC/Caa and CC) are prone to default
unless there is a favourable change in economic conditions.The next category (C/Ca) indicates that
a bankruptcy petition has been ﬁled,but payments are still being made.The bottom category (D/C)
indicates that the issuer has already failed to make coupon payments or principal repayments.
There is evidence that bond ratings provide a useful guide.For example Altman (1991) studied
the default rates for US bonds over the period 1971–90.It was found that ratings were a good guide
to subsequent default rates. For example bonds rated AAA had a default rate of 0.17% over ten
years whereas 37.85% of bonds rated CCC defaulted during the ten years following the rating.
Exhibit 4.1 illustrates the use of bond ratings in the construction of an investment fund.It will
be noted that the portfolio includes non-UK issuers. However non-UK issuers may issue bonds
denominated in pounds sterling.Some of the investments are described by the letters FRN,which
stand for Floating Rate Note.FRNs are bonds whose coupon rates are changed at regular intervals
(see Chapter 45 on interest rate swaps).

M&G CORPORATE BOND FUND
OBJECTIVE
The Fund invests in sterling denominated ﬁxed and variable rate securities, including corporate
bonds and debentures, with the aim of achieving a higher return from investment than would be
obtainable in UK Government ﬁxed interest securities (i.e. gilts) of similar maturities. The Fund
may, however, hold gilts where it is deemed appropriate. The investment manager has the power
to use futures traded or dealt on eligible derivatives markets (currently being the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange) for the purpose of hedging the capital
value of the Fund against the risks of adverse movements in long-term interest rates. More than
35% of the value of the property of the Fund may be invested in Government and other public
securities issued or guaranteed by any of:
■
the Government of the United Kingdom or of a member State other than the United Kingdom;
■
the Government of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, USA;
■

Policy for achieving objective
The Fund invests in sterling denominated ‘investment grade’ debt (BBB and above), typically with
an emphasis on A and BBB rated credits, although this may not always be the case. The Fund
endeavours to limit the exposure to any individual credit to 3% of the total value of the portfolio.

High default risk should be associated with high yields. Part of the additional yield reﬂects the
possibility of loss through default. If bonds with a particular risk rating are regarded as having a
speciﬁc probability of default,weighting the potential loss against the probability of loss indicates
the size of loss on the average bond of the risk class. If that loss is converted into an annual
percentage of the current price of the bond, it could be concluded that the percentage should be
added to the yield on the bond.For example a 20% chance of default over the next ten years might
be compensated by a 2% p.a.addition to the bond yield.This addition is often expressed as a spread
over the yield on a government bond of similar maturity (government bonds being regarded as
free of default risk). It is expected that there should also be a risk premium that reﬂects the
uncertainty about the statistical probability of default.The chances of default may be higher during
economic recessions, and there is uncertainty about the future state of the economy.The excess
(spread) of corporate bond yields over government bond yields would reﬂect both a default
premium and a risk premium.The pattern of yields associated with bonds of varying default risks
is known as the risk structure of bond yields.

In addition to default risk there is credit-migration risk.Default risk is the risk that an issuer of
bonds will fail to pay the coupons or the redemption value at maturity. Credit-migration risk is
the risk that the credit rating of a bond will fall (i.e. that default risk increases).
During the sub-prime mortgage crisis of the summer of 2007 the credit rating agencies were
subject to considerable criticism.A conﬂict of interests was highlighted.The issuers of bonds pay
the agencies, and the issuers of bonds want high credit ratings. If an issuer does not get a high
rating from one agency it could transfer its business to another agency. Credit rating agencies are
motivated to give excessively favourable credit ratings in order to attract and retain business. It
became apparent during the sub-prime mortgage crisis that some portfolios of assets had received
very high credit ratings despite containing some assets backed by sub-prime mortgages.
ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF COUPON PAYMENT
The conventional pattern of coupon payments is often deviated from, particularly by corporate
bonds and eurobonds.Some bonds have ﬂoating coupon payments wherein the coupon is changed
periodically to reﬂect the general level of interest rates.Typically each coupon payment will be
different,with the difference reﬂecting changes in interest rates.Floating rate bonds show less price
variation than conventional bonds since changes in the coupon tend to match changes in the
discount rate (see Chapter 40 on bond prices and redemption yields). Floating rate bonds
(alternatively known as ﬂoating rate notes – FRNs) can be a useful alternative to short-term bank
deposits, or to other short-term money market investments such as certiﬁcates of deposit and
bills.The investor receives short-term interest rates without the need to constantly reinvest
(rollover) money when short-term investments mature.At each interest rate reassessment date
the value of a ﬂoating rate note returns to its par value,thereby maintaining the value of the capital
invested. Floating rate notes are equivalent to short-term money market investments in terms of
both interest yield and low risk of capital loss.
There are deferred coupon bonds, which entail no coupon payments for a period of years, at
the end of which coupon payments commence. Step up bonds pay a low coupon initially, but the
coupon rises after a number of years.Zero coupon bonds pay no coupons;the return to the investor
arises from the difference between the buying and selling prices. Serial bonds repay part of the
principal (original sum invested), as well as the coupon, on the coupon payment dates.
GILTS (GILT-EDGED SECURITIES)
Gilts (gilt-edged stock) are bonds issued by the UK government as a means of borrowing money.
Since they are backed by the government’s ability to levy taxes, there is no risk of default (no risk
that the issuer will fail to make payments to investors).This absence of default risk means that they
are less risky than most other forms of long-term investment.
Issuing Gilts
Gilts are issued through the Debt Management Ofﬁce,which is a department of the Treasury (the
Treasury is part of the UK government). Until 1997 gilts were issued by the Bank of England on
behalf of the government. Gilts are issued by tender, by auction, or as tap stock.
INVESTING IN BONDS
77

Sale by tender entails the Debt Management Ofﬁce (DMO) offering a quantity of gilts and
stating a minimum acceptable price.The price at which the gilts are sold is the highest price at which
all the gilts can be sold,or the minimum price.For example £1 billion of gilts may be offered with
a minimum price of £100.The total demanded by investors at prices at, and above, £102 may
amount to the full £1 billion. In that case all investors pay £102.
If the amount tendered for at £100 or above is less than £1 billion,the gilts will be sold at £100.
The unsold gilts will be treated as tap stock.This means that the DMO will gradually sell them
over time when investors become ready to buy them.
In the auction process,professional investors (largely institutional investors) state the quantities
that they want and the prices that they are prepared to pay. If the auction is oversubscribed only
the highest bidders will receive the gilts.Successful bidders pay the price that they offered.Private
investors,seeking small quantities of gilts,may apply for gilts on the basis of paying the average of
the prices paid by the successful participants in the auction.Sale by auction involves no minimum
price.The gilts are sold to the highest bidders.All the gilts would be sold and none would be left
over as tap stock.
Tap sales involve the Debt Management Ofﬁce selling newly issued gilts to market-makers.
The market-makers subsequently sell them on to other investors.Market-makers undertake to be
always ready to quote prices at which they are prepared to buy and sell.They hold gilts as principals
which means that they invest in, and trade, gilts for their own proﬁt.
The gilt-edged market is part of the London Stock Exchange and the market-makers,dealers,
and brokers are members of the stock exchange.The Central Gilts Ofﬁce provides a computerised
service for payments and settlements between buyers and sellers.
Conventional Gilts
Most gilts issued by the UK Treasury are conventional in nature. Conventional gilts have two
standard characteristics. These are the payment of ﬁxed coupons every six months, and the
repayment of the nominal value of the gilt on a speciﬁed maturity date.The coupon and maturity
year are detailed in the descriptions of gilts published in the ﬁnancial media.
Most UK gilts are described as Treasury, Conversion, or Exchequer.There is no signiﬁcance
for the investor in the name of the gilt.The name is followed by an interest rate and a year.
These indicate the value of the coupon and the year in which the gilt is due to mature.The maturity
date of a gilt is the date on which the ﬁnal coupon and the nominal value are payable to the holder
of the gilt.
If a gilt is described by the title Exchequer 8% 2015, this gilt pays £4 every six months (£8 a
year) for each £100 of nominal value.The nominal value is the principal sum payable by the Treasury,
to the investor holding the gilt, on the maturity date of the gilt.The year of maturity is shown in
the title of the gilt. In the current example maturity will occur in 2015.
Double-dated Gilts
These gilts have two years in their title.This is because the Treasury can redeem them (pay the
nominal value to bondholders) at any time between two dates. In effect the Treasury has a call
option on the gilts (in the United States they are referred to as callable bonds).The Treasury has
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
78

the right to buy back the gilts at the nominal value at any time between the two dates.If the current
interest rate on other bonds is below the coupon rate of the gilt (the rate of interest on the nominal
value), it is advantageous to the Treasury to redeem the gilts before the ﬁnal maturity date. For
example if the current interest rate is 6% p.a. and a gilt pays a dividend of £8 a year (per £100
nominal), the Treasury could redeem it with money borrowed by selling gilts paying £6 a year.
The Treasury must pay for this call option.The Treasury has to pay for the right to redeem
the gilts before the ﬁnal maturity date. This payment is made by means of a coupon rate
(percentage dividend) that is greater than the rate on gilts that lack the right to redeem before the
ﬁnal maturity date.
Undated Gilts
Undated gilts have no maturity date.The Treasury is never obliged to redeem these gilts, it may
simply continue to pay coupons into perpetuity (hence these gilts are alternatively known as
perpetuities). It has been several decades since such gilts were last issued, but a quantity of them
remains in the market.They are unlikely to be redeemed by the Treasury so long as current interest
rates are above the coupon rates of the undated gilts.The undated gilts in existence tend to have
very low coupon rates.
Index-linked Gilts
Index-linked gilts give investors automatic protection against inﬂation by continually raising the
coupon payments,and the principal sum to be paid to the investor at maturity,in line with the Retail
Prices Index (RPI).Speciﬁcally the RPI ﬁgure used is the one current eight months before the date
that the coupon, or principal, is to be paid.The eight-month time lag is used so that the money
value of the next coupon is always known.
An index-linked gilt will have an initial nominal coupon and an initial nominal redemption
value.The sum actually payable is adjusted to reﬂect inﬂation from a point in time eight months
prior to the issue of the gilts.The sum payable is the initial nominal amount multiplied by the ratio
of the new RPI to the initial RPI (the ratio of the RPI eight months before the present to the RPI
eight months before the gilt was issued). So, for example, a doubling of the level of retail prices
causes a doubling of the money value of the coupons payable to the investor with the effect that
the real value (purchasing power value) of the coupons remains unchanged.The real value of the
principal payable to the investor at redemption (the redemption value) is also maintained by means
of the inﬂation adjustment.
In the UK index-linked government bonds provide a tax advantage, relative to other gilts, for
individual investors.Private investors pay income tax on gilt coupons but do not pay tax on capital
gains from gilts (capital gains are the proﬁts from price rises). A substantial proportion of the
returns from index-linked gilts takes the form of capital gains arising from the index-linking. It
might be thought that this tax advantage would increase the demand for index-linked gilts with
the effect that their prices would rise. It might further be thought that the price rise would go to
the point at which the prospective after-tax returns on index-linked gilts fell into line with the
expected after-tax returns on other gilts (bearing in mind the inverse relationship between bond
prices and their yields).However,since individuals constitute only a small proportion of the market
INVESTING IN BONDS
79

for index-linked gilts, the increased demand may not be sufﬁcient to remove the after-tax yield
advantage of index-linked gilts for private investors.
Rump Stocks
A rump stock is a gilt of which little remains in the market.They are often the result of conversion
offers. A conversion offer involves the Debt Management Ofﬁce making an offer to exchange
holdings of an existing gilt issue for a new issue of gilts. Investors may then choose to replace
existing gilts with new ones without incurring transaction costs such as dealing charges. Not
all investors respond to conversion offers. As a result some of the original gilt issue remains
in the market. If only a small amount remains in investors’ hands, liquidity may become very
poor. Poor liquidity means that it is difﬁcult to buy or sell the gilts since there are few potential
buyers and sellers.
GILT STRIPS
A gilt strip market began in the UK in December 1997.Strips is the acronym for Separately Traded
and Registered Interest and Principal Securities.Stripping a gilt involves breaking it down into its
individual cash ﬂows which can be traded separately.Each individual coupon payment date becomes
a maturity date for a strip,and the coupon becomes the redemption value.These are alternatively
known as zero coupon gilts since they provide the investor with just one cash ﬂow, which is the
redemption value of the strip payable at maturity.The nominal value of the original gilt can also
be traded separately from the coupons, it becomes a strip with a redemption (maturity) date
corresponding to the redemption date of the original gilt. For example a gilt with ﬁve years to
maturity can be broken down into 11 strips, one for each remaining coupon and one for the
redemption value (principal sum).These strips would have maturities of six months,one year,18
months, two years, and so forth.
Coupons from different strippable bonds that are paid on the same day are fungible
(interchangeable) when traded as strips.The maturity value of a strip could contain coupons from
a number of different conventional gilts.One purpose of conversion issues has been the replacement
of gilts that lack fungibility with gilts that are fungible with others (share coupon payment dates).
Gilts, inclusive of gilt strips, can be held either directly or through institutional investment
funds such as unit trusts or OEICs. Exhibit 4.2 illustrates a gilt fund. The percentages that
immediately follow the name of the bond are the coupon rates (e.g. UK Treasury 8% is a gilt,
which pays coupons of £8 per year for each £100 of nominal value).The dates that follow are the
dates on which the bonds mature. It should not be presumed that a bond issued by the European
Investment Bank is denominated in Euros.That bank could issue bonds in many other currencies,
including the pound sterling.

GILT YIELDS
There are two frequently used measures of the yield of a gilt. One is known as coupon yield
(alternatively known as interest, ﬂat, or running yield).This is calculated as the annual coupon
divided by the current market price of the gilt.The deﬁciency of this measure is that it ignores
potential capital gains or losses.The return from an investment comprises both periodic payments
(coupons or dividends) and capital gains or losses arising from changes in the market value of the
investment.
The other popular measure of yield, known as redemption yield or yield to maturity, takes
both forms of investment return into account.It includes prospective capital gains or losses as well
as coupons. It is the compound average annual rate of yield based upon the presumption that the
investor will hold the gilt until its redemption (maturity) date.
The redemption yield can be interpreted as the rate of discount that will equate the sum,of the
present values of the future cash ﬂows, to the current market value of the gilt.As such it is often
treated as the rate of interest offered by the gilt (more accurately it approximates an average of
interest rates relating to the various cash ﬂows from the gilt).
The holding period return is similar to the redemption yield except that the bond is not held
to its redemption date.A forecast is made of the future selling price.The holding period return is
the rate of discount that equates the future cash ﬂows, that is the future coupons plus expected
selling price,to the current price of the bond.If the bond has already been sold,the holding period
return is alternatively known as the realised compound yield.
When gilts are traded, the accumulated rights to the next coupon have to be paid for by the
buyer.These rights are referred to as accrued interest.For example if a bond that pays a £4 coupon
every six months is sold three months after the last coupon payment date,there will be £2 accrued
interest.This accrued interest is added to the market price when the buyer pays the seller.During
the seven working days prior to the payment of the coupon, the reverse occurs.The coupon is
payable to the investor who holds the gilt seven working days before the coupon payment date. If
the gilt is sold during this seven-day period the seller must compensate the buyer for the absence
of coupon receipts during this period.The compensation is referred to as rebate interest.The gilt
price exclusive of accrued or rebate interest is known as the clean price.The gilt price inclusive
of such adjustments is the dirty price. Prices quoted in the ﬁnancial media are clean prices.

GILT PRICE VOLATILITY
Gilt prices vary because interest rates vary.A relatively high sensitivity to interest rate movements
is observed amongst undated gilts. Suppose that an undated gilt pays coupons amounting to £4 a
year. If rates on other long-term investments (long-term interest rates) are 4% p.a., the undated
gilt would be priced at about £100.A coupon of £4 on an investment of £100 provides an interest
rate of 4% p.a., which matches rates of return elsewhere. If interest rates on other long-term
investments rose to 8% p.a., rational investors would not pay £100 for a gilt paying £4 a year.
Investors would be prepared to pay around £50 for the gilt since £4 on £50 produces a rate of return
of 8% p.a. Conversely a fall in interest rates on other investments to 2% p.a. would imply a price
INVESTING IN BONDS
83

of £200 for the gilt.The coupon of £4 a year provides 2% p.a. when the gilt price is £200. It can
be seen that the gilt price is inversely proportional to the long-term interest rate available elsewhere
in the market.A doubling of the interest rate causes a halving of the gilt price,and vice versa.This
degree of volatility is relatively extreme.There is always an inverse relationship between interest
rates and gilt prices but rarely a proportionally inverse one.Usually the change in gilt price is less
than proportionate to the interest rate change.
PREFERENCE SHARES
Preference shares, despite their name, are more like bonds than ordinary shares since most of
them pay a ﬁxed dividend each year. Unlike bonds they confer part ownership of a company, but
like bonds they normally entail no voting rights.They further differ from bonds in that the ﬁrm is
not obliged to make the dividend payments on preference shares if proﬁts are not sufﬁcient.Bonds
are debts of the issuer and the issuer is legally obliged to pay the coupons and to repay the principal
at maturity. Preference shares come in various forms, as follows:
■irredeemable
■redeemable
■cumulative
■non-cumulative
■participating
■convertible.
Apart from the irredeemable/redeemable and cumulative/non-cumulative distinctions these
characteristics are not mutually exclusive.For example a preference share could be irredeemable,
cumulative, participating, and convertible whereas another might be simply irredeemable and
cumulative.
Whilst most preference shares are irredeemable,some are redeemable (redeemable means that
the sum received from the issue of the shares would be repaid by a speciﬁed date). In the case of
cumulative preference shares,the ﬁrm is required to pay any missed dividends when proﬁts become
adequate. Back payments of missed dividends must be made before any dividends on ordinary
shares (common stock) can be paid. In the case of a non-cumulative preference share, there is no
obligation on the issuer to pay any previously missed dividends. So a missed dividend may be lost
forever.
Participating preference shares provide participation in unusually good proﬁt levels. If the
company’s proﬁts are exceptionally good, the payments to holders of participating preference
shares will exceed the normal dividend level. Convertible preference shares are similar to
convertible bonds in that the holder has rights to convert the preference shares into ordinary shares
on predetermined terms.
THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF BONDS
The investment performance of bonds is generally thought to lie between the performances of
shares and money market investments, in terms of both return and risk.The Barclays Capital
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
84

Equity Gilt Study (2006) found the average annual real rates of return in the UK,up to the end of
2005, as shown in Table 4.2.
Although gilts outperformed equities (shares) in the ten years up to 2005,that outperformance
was fairly unusual. Figures published in the Daily Telegraph (26 February 2005) and adapted by
Rutterford (2007) looked at the number of times gilts outperformed equities during various time
periods between 1899 and 2004. Over ten-year periods (1899–1909, 1900–10, 1901–11, etc.)
gilts outperformed equities in only 17% of the periods.
It is to be expected that corporate bonds should provide higher returns than gilts because of
the default risk of corporate bonds.Table 4.2 shows that corporate bonds outperformed gilts
during the period 1995–2005. However convincing judgements about the performance of
corporate bonds, relative to gilts and equities, requires data on more than a ten-year period.
CONCLUSION
There are many types of bond.The variety reﬂects the many different needs of borrowers and
investors.The variety entails the need for information on the part of investors when faced with a
plethora of choice. Credit rating agencies provide some of that information in that they help to
reduce uncertainty about the likelihood of default. It is not just default risk that investors need to
know about; they also need to be able to ascertain prospective returns and risks. There
are alternative measures of yield and of risk. Investors should understand measures of yield,
particularly redemption yield,and measures of risk,particularly duration (more detail is provided
in Chapters 40 and 41).The variety of investment alternatives is added to by preference shares,
which are often treated as virtually equivalent to bonds in many cases. It will be seen in later
chapters that many bonds have derivative features,particularly option features,and that this vastly
increases the variety of bonds.
In terms of both returns and risks, bonds lie between money market investments and shares.
They tend to have higher returns, but also greater risk, when compared to money market
investments.They tend to have lower average returns,and lower risk,when compared with equity
investments (i.e. shares).

Individuals can buy bonds directly (government bonds can even be bought at post ofﬁces in the
UK), and can also buy them indirectly by means of institutional investments. Buying through
institutional investments,such as unit trusts,has the advantage of risk reduction by diversiﬁcation
but there is the possibility that the fund charges seriously reduce the income derived from the
investment. Use of index-tracking bond funds could reduce this problem since their charges can
be much lower than those of actively managed bond funds.
The vast variety of bonds available provides the investor with immense choice.Although the
amount of choice allows investors to meet their investment needs closely,too much choice can be
confusing. In the bond market investors are faced with much more information than they can
typically handle. Substantial amounts of choice, and information, can cause procrastination.
Investors need to be aware of this possibility.They should also be aware that huge amounts of
choice and information could elicit the heuristic simpliﬁcation biases described in Chapter 2 on
the psychology of personal investment decisions.

Chapter 5
Property investment
and mortgages
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Investing in property.
2. Property pricing.
3. Various types of mortgage and their characteristics.
4. The debate about the desirability of ﬁxed-rate mortgages.
5. The use of mortgage schemes to turn home ownership into an income.
6. The equations on which mortgage and endowment calculations are based.
BUYING YOUR OWN HOME
When considering housing a choice needs to be made between buying a home and renting. Each
has its advantages and its disadvantages.The advantages of renting include mobility.When renting
it is relatively easy to move home since no buying and selling is involved.Another advantage is the
low initial cost.When buying a property a substantial deposit is usually required.In addition there
are other initial costs such as stamp duty (a tax on home purchases in the UK).These initial costs
are avoided when renting.A third advantage of renting is the absence of responsibility for repairs.
The landlord must pay for the maintenance of the property.
The disadvantages of renting when compared with buying include the likelihood that the rent
will increase over time,whereas the price at which you bought the property remains constant.Also
irrespective of how much rent is paid,and for how long it is paid,the resident never owns the rented
property.The buyer of a home does own it and, when the mortgage used to buy it is paid off, no
regular payments are required for the privilege of living there.Meanwhile the renter continues to
pay rent.The buyer of a home has an investment as well as a place to live. History shows that the
investment tends to rise in value over time.
Homeowners bear some risks,which are avoided by those who rent.One risk is that property
prices may fall.Although in the past property prices have tended to rise, that has not always been
the case.
87

There have been periods during which prices in general have fallen, such as the early 1990s in
the UK.Also prices in particular locations,or for particular types of property,may fall.For example
if a major local employer closes down,house prices could fall as people sell.People may sell their
homes because they move to a different area in order to obtain work.
Another risk facing homebuyers,when buyers ﬁnance purchases by borrowing,is that interest
rates may rise. Most buyers borrow money by way of mortgages. Most mortgages in the UK are
variable rate, which means that mortgage interest rates vary. A rise in mortgage interest rates
raises the cost of buying a home, perhaps to the point that the buyer is forced to sell as a result of
no longer being able to ﬁnance the mortgage payments.If this occurs at a time when property prices
have fallen, the selling price may not be enough to pay off the outstanding mortgage debt. People
are then left without a home,and in debt.The situation in which a person’s home is worth less than
the mortgage debt is known as negative equity.(A person’s equity in a home is its value minus the
outstanding mortgage debt.)
Opportunities for Gearing
By gearing is meant borrowing in order to ﬁnance an investment.When buying a home people
frequently borrow most of the purchase price. It is not unusual for 90% of the purchase price to
be ﬁnanced by borrowing by means of a mortgage.This has implications for percentage gains (and
losses) from property investment.
Suppose that someone pays £100,000 for a house using £10,000 of their own money plus a
mortgage borrowing of £90,000. Initially their equity in the house is £10,000. If the value of the
house subsequently rises to £120,000,the homeowner’s equity rises to £30,000 (£120,000 minus
£90,000).In consequence of a 20% rise in the value of the property,the house buyer’s investment
has risen in value by 200% (£10,000 to £30,000).
Borrowing to buy ampliﬁes percentage proﬁts (and losses). It is easy to ﬁnance a high
proportion of the cost of property purchase by mortgage borrowing. It is much less easy to
ﬁnance a high proportion of the cost of other forms of investment (such as stock market investment)
by borrowing.The facility of making highly geared investments is a characteristic of property
markets.
Lack of Diversiﬁcation
One difﬁculty with home ownership, when considered as an investment, is the absence
of diversiﬁcation.When investing in the stock market it is usual to hold shares in a number
of different companies (for example shareholdings in 50 different ﬁrms). This is known
as diversiﬁcation, and it helps to reduce risk. Poor performances from some shares might
be offset by strong performances on others. Holding a diversiﬁed portfolio of shares entails
less risk than holding the shares of just one company. The average price variation of a
diversiﬁed portfolio,of say 50 different shares,should be less than the price volatility of an individual
share.
Home ownership does not allow for such diversiﬁcation.Typically the whole investment is in
just one property. If a change in local circumstances reduces the value of a home, there are no
offsetting price increases from other properties.
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
88

Lack of Liquidity
Liquidity is the speed and ease with which an investment can be turned into cash without the need
to lower the price.Usually bank deposits can be cashed quickly,and stock market investments sold
quickly. Property is typically much less liquid. It usually takes several months to sell a residential
property.The property may be advertised for several months before a buyer is found.A protracted,
and costly, legal process then follows. An offer to buy may be withdrawn at a late stage in the
process with the result that the selling process starts all over again.
BUY-TO-LET
Many people do diversify their holdings of residential property by buying homes with the intention
of renting them to tenants.The objective is to gain from both price increases and the receipt of
rent. Often the rent receipts are used to make mortgage payments relating to the purchase of the
properties.
Buy-to-let can seem to be a very attractive investment.The mortgage used to buy the property
is ﬁnanced from the rent receipts, and eventually the buyer has a property without a mortgage.
However buying-to-let does have risks and drawbacks. One risk is that the property could stand
empty for long periods; it may not always be possible to ﬁnd tenants. Mortgage payments must
continue to be paid even when there is no rent being received.
Another risk is that tenants could damage the property and/or fail to pay rent.It is possible that
the general level of rents could fall,perhaps in consequence of a surplus of properties available to
rent. It is possible for mortgage interest rates to rise. It is also possible for property prices to fall.
The owner of the property has to deal with its maintenance,irrespective of whether the property
is occupied.Maintaining a property in good repair,and collecting rent,can be irksome functions.
If an agent is paid to carry out such roles, fees must be paid.
PROPERTY UNIT TRUSTS, REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT
TRUSTS, AND PROPERTY COMPANIES
A route to property investment,without the work and worry of its management,is through indirect
investment.This also provides a high level of diversiﬁcation.Three indirect forms of property
investment are property unit trusts (or property OEICs),Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs),
and the shares of property companies. Each of these holds a diversiﬁed portfolio of properties.
Individuals can become part owners in those portfolios by buying the units, or shares, issued by
these institutional investors. By combining the relatively small investments of individuals, these
institutions can buy large portfolios of properties.Aggregating the investments from a large number
of individuals provides the institutions with large sums of money to invest.
The types of property held by these institutional investors include:
retail outlets such as shops, shopping centres, and retail warehouses;
ofﬁce space such as ofﬁce blocks and business parks;
industrial premises including industrial estates and distribution warehouses;
leisure facilities such as hotels, cinemas, and pubs.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICY (ABRIDGED)
The investment objective is to achieve income and capital growth through investing generally in
real commercial property. The investment policy is to invest predominantly in commercial property
in the UK. The scheme will aim to diversify risk by seeking exposure principally in three main
sectors:
Retail (e.g. shopping centres, retail warehouses, standard shops, supermarkets, and department
stores);
Ofﬁces (e.g. standard ofﬁces and business parks); and
Industrial (e.g. standard industrial estates and distribution warehousing).
In addition, the scheme may also gain exposure to other commercial property sectors, including
the smaller leisure sector (e.g. leisure parks, restaurants, pubs, and hotels).
The scheme may also invest in other property-related assets (including property-related UK
transferable securities and mainly UK property-related collective investment schemes), in money
market instruments, deposits, money market-related collective investment schemes, and
government and public securities.

The diversiﬁcation of a portfolio entails a variety of different types of property in a variety of
locations.Poor returns for some types,and places,would tend to be offset by good yields elsewhere.
For example if only one property is held and it has no tenants, there is zero rental return. If a
hundred properties are held it is extremely unlikely that they would all lack tenants. The
diversiﬁcation provided by these institutional investments tends to be enhanced by the tendency
to hold indirect property investments in addition to direct property holdings. For example a
property unit trust is likely to hold REITs and property company shares in addition to a direct
property portfolio. In this way the spread of property investments becomes wider.
The returns to the individual investors come from both increases in the values of the properties
and the rent (and lease) payments from their tenants.The attractiveness of this type of investment
is enhanced by the fact that returns from property do not vary in line with stock market returns.
Since property market returns (proﬁts) and stock market returns (proﬁts) tend to vary
independently of each other, property investments can be useful for diversifying an investment
portfolio. In other words, by mixing property investments with stock market investments poor
performance from one may be offset by strong performance on the other. Exhibit 5.1 shows an
example of a property unit trust.

The trust expense ratio shows the operating expenses that relate to the management of the Trust
as a percentage of the average net assets of the Trust. The property expense ratio shows the
operating costs that relate to the management of the property assets as a percentage of the average
net assets of the Trust.
DETERMINANTS OF PROPERTY PRICES
Property prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply. So an analysis of the
determination of property prices entails a consideration of the inﬂuences on demand and those on
supply. In the case of residential property important factors affecting demand are thought to be
household incomes and mortgage interest rates. A rise in incomes provides the ﬁnance for an
increase in spending on residential property.A fall in mortgage interest rates makes mortgages,
and hence property purchase,more affordable.In the UK these factors have been accompanied by
a willingness, on the part of mortgage lenders, to lend increasing multiples of income (the
maximum mortgage loan used to be about three times annual income,at the time of writing loans
of around ﬁve times income were not uncommon).
Demographic factors also affect demand. If the population of a region or country were
increasing,there would be an increase in the demand for residential property.In the UK increasing
longevity (people living longer) and net immigration have added to the demand for housing.If there
were an increase in the proportion of single occupants, for example due to increasing divorce
rates, there would be increased demand for properties.
Demand for residential property is enhanced by the fact that it is seen as more than a source of
accommodation. It is also seen as a form of investment and as a status symbol.These reasons for
the purchase of property may lead to demand rising faster than incomes. It is interesting to note
that in the UK the ratio of the average price of a house to average annual earnings rose from about

3 in 1995 to 5.8 in 2005 (Nationwide Building Society 2005). Property prices are subject to
bubbles and crashes in a similar way to stock markets (see Chapter 27 on stock market bubbles
and crashes).The rise in the ratio of property prices to incomes may be the result of positive
feedback trading whereby increasing prices cause increases in demand because buyers extrapolate
price rises (that is past price rises are seen as indicating future price rises).
There is evidence that professional valuers emphasise different aspects of a property than the
buyers.Adair et al. (1996) found that buyers put more emphasis on house size and condition than
valuers.Valuers put more emphasis on location,in terms of characteristics of the neighbourhood,
than buyers.Adair et al. suggested that differences between valuers and buyers could produce a
difference between valuations and sale prices of the order of 10%.They found that valuers and
buyers both tended to use a larger number and range of characteristics when evaluating detached
properties as opposed to terraced properties.
A major factor affecting the supply of residential property is the availability of building land.
This is likely to be affected by planning permission from governmental bodies. In the UK one of
the reasons suggested for the rise in property prices has been the failure of new home construction,
resulting from low availability of building land, to match the increase in demand for homes.
In the case of commercial property,demand will be affected by the factors that determine other
forms of business investment.These factors are the prospective productivity of the investment
(the prospective rental income from the property) and the cost of ﬁnancing the purchase of the
property.The cost of ﬁnancing the purchase of commercial property,the cost of capital,is related
to interest rates. High interest rates would be associated with a high cost of capital.The demand
for commercial property rises when prospective rental income rises, but falls when the cost of
capital rises.
The supply of commercial property is affected by the availability of suitable building land. It is
likely to be affected by planning constraints. It is also affected by the attitudes of property
developers. If developers see construction as potentially proﬁtable, the supply from them would
increase.
THE ROLE OF ANCHORING IN PROPERTY VALUATION
Anchoring is a concept that has emerged from the literature on behavioural ﬁnance,notably from
Tversky and Kahneman (1974).Anchoring entails people being inﬂuenced in their estimations of
value by numbers provided,even when those numbers are irrelevant or inappropriate.Northcraft
and Neale (1987) found that estate agents anchored to the asking price of a property and were
heavily inﬂuenced by it. High asking prices tended to elicit high valuations. However Diaz (1997)
found no evidence that professional valuers operating in markets familiar to them anchored on
anonymous opinions, although Diaz and Hansz (1997) found that valuers operating in
geographically unfamiliar markets were inﬂuenced by anonymous opinions.They found that the
prices of comparable properties also became anchors. Gallimore (1994, 1996) concluded that
property valuers were subject not only to anchoring but also exhibited a conﬁrmation bias.The
conﬁrmation bias entails valuers making quick judgements,and then seeking evidence in support
of the early valuations.
Property valuation appears to be prone to ‘appraisal smoothing’,that is the tendency for values
based on expert estimates of price to ﬂuctuate less than prices observed from the process of buying
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
92

and selling. Diaz and Wolverton (1998) demonstrated that valuers anchor to their previous
valuations and adjust their valuations insufﬁciently to take full account of changing circumstances.
The effect of anchoring to asking price in property negotiations has been explored (Black and
Diaz 1996; Black 1997; Diaz et al. 1999). It was found that property professionals gave too much
weight to asking price, even when the asking price was inconsistent with relevant information. It
might be the case that market data is intellectually demanding whereas an asking price is a simple,
and undemanding, piece of information (Diaz 1999).
MOMENTUM IN PROPERTY PRICE TRENDS
One observed feature of share price movements is that they tend to demonstrate short-term
momentum and longer-term reversion.This means that, in the short term, strong performance
tends to persist whereas there is subsequent reversion. Stocks that have performed well in the
recent past will tend to show good performance in the near future.This strong performance is
likely to show some reversal after a time.The chapters in Part 7 on market efﬁciency,particularly
Chapter 23 on concepts and weak form evidence, indicate relevant evidence.
There have been a number of studies of property (real estate) markets,particularly commercial
property markets, indicating the existence of momentum (Young and Graff 1996, 1997; Graff et
al. 1999; Lee and Ward 2001; Marcato and Key 2005; Devaney et al. 2007). Marcato and Key
found evidence of some subsequent reversal.Although the studies tended to focus on commercial
property, the Young and Graff studies found momentum effects for residential property. Overall
the various studies found that the persistence of price trends was greatest for the extremes.The
top 25% of properties in one year tended to be high performers the following year,and the bottom
25% one year tended to be poor performers the following year.
One important difference between stock market prices and the property market prices used
in the studies is that, whereas stock prices are determined by trading, valuations by real estate
professionals were the source of the property prices.The observed serial persistence in property
price changes was actually persistence in the direction and size of valuation changes. If valuers
were conservative in revising values, those revisions might be smoothed over time rather than
occurring at one point in time.Such smoothing,which could be the result of anchoring on previous
valuations, would give the appearance of a momentum effect.
The question has been raised as to why, if serial persistence in returns from real estate exists,
the effect is not eliminated by property investors buying and selling on the basis of previous price
movements. If investors, particularly arbitragers who both buy and sell, act so as to fully exploit
proﬁtable opportunities those opportunities should cease to exist. Devaney et al. (2007) pointed
out that the information on property valuations may not be widely disseminated and that there are
signiﬁcant transaction costs. Momentum appears to exist in stock markets where price changes
are universally known and transaction costs are relatively low. So it is perhaps not surprising that
real estate investors do not trade so as to eliminate trends in property prices.
In both stock and real estate markets,trading on the basis of recent price movements could serve
to continue the trend rather than eliminate it. Such positive feedback trading could perpetuate
proﬁt opportunities rather than eliminate them.This raises issues relating to the efﬁcient market
hypothesis (see the chapters in Part 7 on market efﬁciency, particularly Chapter 23 on concepts
and weak form evidence). Proponents of the efﬁcient market hypothesis believe that traders
PROPERTY INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGES
93

eliminate any unjustiﬁed price moves by buying underpriced assets and selling overpriced assets.
Opponents of the efﬁcient market hypothesis believe that assets can continue to have unjustiﬁed
prices for long periods, and that deviations from justiﬁed prices can increase.The evidence of
momentum (serial persistence) is evidence against the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
A COMPARISON OF PROPERTY AND STOCK MARKET INVESTMENTS
In the UK housing is often seen as the best long-term investment in terms of total return.
At the same time the stock market is seen as the most risky.The perception of relative long-term
returns is more readily explained by the principles of behavioural ﬁnance than by reality.The
principle of retrievability (availability) says that perceptions are heavily inﬂuenced by ‘information’
that is readily recalled. It is possibly the case that the media tends to report stock market crashes
more readily than rises, whilst tending to report heavily housing market price rises.A perception
of housing as a proﬁtable and safe investment, that is superior to stock market investment, seems
to have formed.
It is informative to look at recent UK history.For example £100,000 spent on the average UK
residential property at the beginning of 1988 would have grown to about £288,000 by the end of
2003 (based on the Halifax Property Index) whereas £100,000 invested in a portfolio of shares
reﬂecting the FTSE All-Share Index would have grown to about £503,000 over the same period.
So in terms of ﬁnancial returns on the investment, stock market investment proved superior.
However it does appear that stock market investment provides more risk.The ﬁgures shown in
Table 5.1 indicate that both investments were subject to a substantial amount of risk.The ﬁgures
show the returns in each of the years during the period.The stock market was more volatile. It
also showed substantial losses in some years, whereas when the housing market produced losses
they were more modest.The stock market more than compensated for its loss-making years by
providing substantial gains in many years.However the perspective of behavioural ﬁnance is again
useful here.According to prospect theory, people weight the pain from losses more than twice as
heavily as the pleasure from gains.This is known as loss-aversion and would cause large stock
market losses, such as those in 2001 and 2002, to feel very painful to many investors.
The two years following 2003 saw relative outperformance by the stock market.During 2004
the FTSE All-Share Index showed a return of 31.9% against a rise in the Halifax UK House Price
Index of 17.9%. During 2005 the FTSE All-Share Index showed a yield of 15% against 9.6% for
the Halifax House Price Index (Money Management,April 2006).
McRae (1995) pointed out that in real terms (i.e. after adjusting for inﬂation) the rise in the
prices of detached houses in the UK averaged less than 2% p.a. over the period 1945 to 1993.
Figures relating to house price increases are not the full story of investing in residential property.
The property also provides accommodation if owner-occupied, or rental income if it is a buy-to-
let property.The value of the accommodation or rent should be added to the capital gains from
price increases when assessing the total return from housing.Against these items should be set
certain costs such as maintenance, insurance, and property taxes (council tax).
It can be seen from Table 5.1 that share prices and house prices often move in opposite directions.
This suggests that a combination of shares and property is good for portfolio diversiﬁcation.Poor
performances of one may be offset by good performances of the other,so an investment portfolio
containing both will be relatively stable (see Chapter 13 on portfolio diversiﬁcation).

MORTGAGES AND THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY
Mortgages are debts secured by property.They are often used for the purchase of homes.The
borrower borrows for a period such as 25 years.The borrower undertakes to make periodic,
typically monthly, repayments to the lender. If the borrower fails to maintain the payments, the
lender has the legal right to take the property by which the mortgage is secured.Lenders differ in
the amount they will lend but three times annual earnings is a typical upper limit.
Mortgage lenders like to protect themselves if they lend a high proportion of the value of a
property.They face the risk that a borrower might default after a fall in property prices.If the lender
repossesses the property and sells it, the selling price may be less than the outstanding mortgage
debt. Lenders often require borrowers who borrow a high proportion of the value of a property
to take out mortgage indemnity insurance. Such insurance would reimburse the lender for any
surplus of the debt over the selling price of the property.A situation in which the mortgage debt
exceeds the value of the property is known as negative equity.
Mortgages in the United Kingdom can be ﬁnanced on either a repayment, or an endowment,
basis (other possibilities include pension mortgages and ISA mortgages). Repayment mortgages
entail monthly payments that cover both interest and debt reduction. If the interest rate were
constant for the full period of the mortgage, the monthly payments would also be constant.With
variable-rate mortgages the monthly payment will change as interest rates change.In the UK most
mortgages are variable rate.

Interest rates on variable-rate mortgages are determined by the demand and supply for funds.
If there is an increase in borrowing, or a fall in saving, interest rates will rise.A fall in borrowing
or rise in saving will reduce interest rates.Monetary policy of the central bank (the Bank of England
in the UK, the European Central Bank in the Eurozone) will inﬂuence interest rates by operating
through demand and supply.The interest cost of a mortgage to a borrower reﬂects what the lender
(a bank or building society) has to pay for the funds. If demand and supply determines that the
mortgage lender must pay more to its depositors, the variable-rate mortgage borrowers should
expect the increased interest costs to be passed on to them. In the case of base rate tracker
mortgages, the mortgage interest rate is guaranteed to be a speciﬁed amount above the Bank of
England base rate (or other benchmark interest rate). It is to be expected that base rate tracker
mortgages are ﬁnanced by means of the bank or building society borrowing on a similar basis.
In the early years of a repayment mortgage most of the monthly payment would reﬂect interest
on the debt, with relatively little being left over for reducing the size of the debt. In later years,
when part of the debt has been repaid by means of these monthly sums and interest costs have
thereby been reduced, more of the monthly payment is available for reducing the debt.Towards
the end of the mortgage term, the outstanding debt will have been signiﬁcantly reduced with the
result that interest is a smaller portion of the payments.As a mortgage term nears its end, most
of the monthly sum is used for debt reduction (capital repayment).
Endowment mortgages entail none of the debt being repaid until the mortgage matures.The
borrower pays interest on the entire sum borrowed throughout the period of the mortgage. In
addition the borrower makes monthly contributions to an endowment fund operated by an
insurance company.The intention is that, at maturity, the accumulated endowment fund will be
sufﬁcient to pay off the mortgage debt.However there is a risk that the accumulated sum will not
be sufﬁcient (there is also the possibility that it will be more than sufﬁcient with the effect that there
is a lump sum available to the borrower in addition to the sum required to repay the mortgage).
Endowment mortgages are the most common form of interest-only mortgage.It is possible that
the lender does not insist that the borrower makes provision for repayment at the end of the
mortgage term. However it is usual for borrowers to be required, or at least encouraged, to
establish a savings scheme that will be expected to repay the mortgage when it reaches the end of
its term. Although endowment policies have been the most common savings schemes other
methods have included pension funds, where the lump-sum component pays off the mortgage
debt, and tax-advantaged savings schemes (PEPs and ISAs).
CHARACTERISTICS OF REPAYMENT MORTGAGES
The nature of repayment mortgages has implications for the pattern of interest and principal
payments on the part of the borrower.The characteristics of the repayment process can be seen
by demonstrating the effects of differing interest rates and terms to maturity on the monthly
payments, the total interest paid, and the rate at which the mortgage debt is reduced.
Characteristic 1
The monthly repayments increase as the interest rate rises,but not proportionately.For example,
at 5% p.a. a £100,000 15-year mortgage will cost £790 per month.At 10% p.a. the same
mortgage would cost £1,075 per month.A doubling of the interest rate entails a 36% increase
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
96

in the monthly payment.The absence of proportionality can be explained in terms of the
higher monthly payments reducing the mortgage debt more rapidly in the later years. In
consequence less of the debt needs to be paid off in the early years. Also the total debt
repayment is not affected by interest rates.
Characteristic 2
A reduction in the term of a mortgage increases the monthly payments, but not proportionately.
For example, a £100,000 30-year mortgage at 5% p.a. entails a monthly payment of £536
whereas an equivalent 15-year mortgage involves payments of £790 a month. Halving the
period of the mortgage causes a 47% increase in the monthly payments.The absence of
proportionality can be explained in terms of the reduced cumulative interest payment resulting
from the faster repayment of the mortgage debt.
Characteristic 3
The cumulative interest payments increase more than proportionately with the term of the
mortgage.For example,with an interest rate of 5% p.a.a £100,000 15-year mortgage would
entail cumulative interest payments of £42,342 whereas an equivalent 30-year mortgage
involves total interest costs of £89,493.Raising the term of the mortgage by 100% increases
the total interest payments by 111%. This can be explained in terms of the lower debt
repayments in the early years, in the case of the 30-year mortgage, and the resulting higher
annual interest costs together with the longer period over which interest is payable.
Characteristic 4
The cumulative interest payments are larger with higher interest rates and they rise more than
proportionately.A 25-year £100,000 mortgage at 5% p.a. entails total interest payments of
£75,377.An equivalent mortgage with a 10% p.a. interest rate would involve total interest
payments of £172,610.This can be explained in terms of less of the capital being paid off in
the early years when the interest rate is higher. Not only is the interest rate higher, so is the
average size of the mortgage debt.
Characteristic 5
The time taken to the repayment of half the mortgage debt will here be referred to as the half-life
of the mortgage.The relationship between interest rates and the half-life of a mortgage is that
the half-life rises with increases in the interest rate, but the rise is less than proportional.At
5% p.a. a 25-year £100,000 mortgage has a half-life of 16 years 2 months (i.e. 194 months).
At 10% p.a.the half-life is 18 years 10 months (i.e.226 months).With the higher interest rate
less of the debt is repaid in the early years.
Characteristic 6
The half-life of a mortgage rises with increases in the term of the mortgage and the increase in the
half-life is more than proportional to the increase in the term of the mortgage. A 15-year
£100,000 mortgage at 5% p.a. will have a half-life of 8 years 10 months (i.e. 106 months).
An equivalent mortgage with a term of 30 years would have a half-life of 20 years 2 months
(i.e. 242 months).

The Tilt
The tilt is the tendency for mortgages to exert cash ﬂow pressures on borrowers in the early years
of the mortgage.One source of the tilt is inﬂation,and the effects of expected inﬂation on interest
rates.Interest rates tend to incorporate expectations of inﬂation.If the real interest rate is 3% p.a.,
and inﬂation is expected to be 2% p.a., nominal (money) interest rates are likely to be about 3%
 2%  5% p.a. (see Chapter 3 on money market investments). High expected inﬂation is
associated with high interest rates, and hence high monthly repayments on a mortgage. However
inﬂation erodes the value of money.With an inﬂation rate of 2% p.a.,at the end of 25 years it would
require (1.02)25  £1.64 to buy what £1 would have bought at the beginning of the 25 years.This
implies that £1 at the end of 25 years is equivalent to a current 1/1.64 61p in terms of purchasing
power.So over time inﬂation reduces the value of money and hence the value,in purchasing power
terms, of monthly mortgage payments.
High expected inﬂation raises the real value of mortgage payments in the early years since
interest rates would be high but inﬂation would not have had time to substantially reduce the real
value of the monthly payments. By the end of the mortgage period, inﬂation would have
substantially reduced the real value of the monthly mortgage payments.Table 5.2 illustrates the
inﬂation tilt on a repayment mortgage for the cases of expected,and experienced,inﬂation of 0%,
2%, and 4% p.a. and corresponding nominal interest rates of 3%, 5%, and 7% p.a. It is assumed
that the initial mortgage debt is £100,000 repayable over 25 years and that inﬂation rates and
interest rates are constant (the validity of the basic principle does not depend upon the assumption
of constancy).
In the absence of inﬂation the real monthly cost remains at £474 throughout.With 4% p.a.
inﬂation the early real cost is high at £707 per month whereas by the end of the mortgage period
the real cost is down to £265. Inﬂation causes the real cost of the mortgage payments to be tilted
towards the early years.
One way to alleviate the tilt could be to have an interest-only period at the beginning. For
example the ﬁrst ﬁve years could be interest-only (there is no repayment of the debt, only the
interest is paid). At the end of the ﬁrst ﬁve years the mortgage becomes a 20-year repayment
mortgage.Table 5.3 shows the monthly payments during the ﬁrst ﬁve years and the subsequent
20 years.
It can be seen from Table 5.3 that,although the real value of the early payments is reduced,there
is not necessarily a moderation of the extremes. For example in the ‘2% and 5%’ case the highest
real value is £598,which exceeds the highest real value (£585) in the absence of the interest-only
period (in Table 5.2).

Other sources of the tilt include the tendency for the real value of salaries and wages to be
relatively low in a person’s earlier working years, and for the purchase of a home to be associated
with expenditure on ﬁttings and furniture.The latter source of the tilt can be partially compensated
by means of a cashback payment.A cashback entails increasing the mortgage borrowing above the
amount needed for the purchase of the property.The additional amount borrowed is paid to the
borrower as a lump sum at the time that the property is purchased. Effectively it is the provision
of a loan,for unspeciﬁed purposes,on the same terms as the loan for ﬁnancing the purchase of the
property.
FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES
It is often possible to obtain mortgages on which the interest rate is ﬁxed for a period of time,for
example ﬁve years.Theories of the term structure of interest rates throw light on such products,
including the advantages and disadvantages.
The starting point is the pure expectations theory of the term structure.This suggests that long-
term interest rates are averages of expected future short-term interest rates. For example the
interest rate for a ﬁve-year loan would be the average of the next ﬁve one-year rates.There would
be no expected difference between (a) borrowing for ﬁve years and (b) borrowing for one year
with a view to renewing the borrowing at the end of the year (and renewing on the next three
anniversaries).The word expected is important here since future interest rates are uncertain.
On this view the advantage of the ﬁxed-rate mortgage is that it provides certainty of interest
rate costs over the period of the loan,not that it entails an advantageous interest rate.The interest
rate payable matches the expected average rate to be paid on a variable-rate mortgage.At the end
of the ﬁve years the ﬁxed rate would have proven to be either higher or lower than the
corresponding average variable rate. However at the beginning of the period there is no way of
knowing which would be the case.The expected rate is in the middle of a range of possibilities.
The expected future interest rates are those that are anticipated by money market participants
(for example banks).The likelihood of an individual borrower (or adviser) being able to produce
a superior forecast of future interest rates is, at best, very remote. Interest rates are notoriously
difﬁcult to forecast, and the best advice is not to try.The choice between ﬁxed- and variable-rate
mortgages should not be made on the basis of whether the borrower believes that interest rates

will be higher or lower than the ﬁxed rate.The borrower should also be aware that making the
choice on the basis of whether the ﬁxed rate is higher or lower than the current variable rate
involves an implicit forecast of interest rates.The implicit forecast is that interest rates will remain
unchanged.
A decision to take out a ﬁxed-rate mortgage should be based on the value of the certainty that
the ﬁxed rate provides.The borrower with a ﬁxed rate avoids the risk that interest rates will rise
to the extent that repayments cease to be affordable.The borrower must expect to pay for the
reduction of risk.This relates to an extension of the pure expectations theory of the term structure
of interest rates.The principle of expectations with risk premium says that long-term interest
rates equal the average of the expected future short-term rates plus a risk premium.The risk
premium is an addition to the interest rate to reﬂect the higher risk (and lower liquidity) faced by
the lender.
This point can be elaborated by considering how the lender (bank or building society) obtains
the money to be lent to the borrower.The bank might borrow money for ﬁve years by selling ﬁve-
year bonds in the ﬁnancial markets.The rate of interest payable on the bonds will determine the
ﬁxed rate that the bank will charge its customers.Investors in ﬁve-year bonds face more risk than
investors in shorter-term assets;an increase in interest rates would reduce the market value of the
bonds.To compensate for this extra risk the investors would require extra interest; that is a risk
premium. So the bank has to pay a risk premium and this will be passed on to borrowers in the
form of higher interest rates.So ﬁxed-rate mortgage borrowers should expect to pay extra interest
for the increased certainty about the interest rates payable.Fixed-rate mortgage borrowers should
expect to pay the average of expected future variable interest rates plus a risk premium.
Consideration of how banks and building societies raise funds for the provision of ﬁxed-rate
mortgages also explains why early redemption penalties are often imposed.Often borrowers with
ﬁxed-rate mortgages want to change to a variable rate when interest rates fall. However the
provider has borrowed on a ﬁxed-rate basis and is committed to continue to pay the ﬁxed rate.
Early termination of the mortgage would leave the bank or building society paying the high rate
of interest, and making a loss in doing so since the money must now be lent at the lower interest
rate.The mortgage provider would therefore expect compensation for this loss from the borrower.
A borrower needs to realise that the interest rate certainty provided by a ﬁxed-rate mortgage
involves a guarantee that precludes advantageous interest rate movements as well as adverse ones.
A cost of avoiding rises is the loss of potential falls.
It has been suggested by the UK government (in 2003, by Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of
the Exchequer) that the UK system of mortgage lending should move towards the system of long-
term lending typical of the United States and mainland Europe. In the UK most mortgages are
provided on a variable interest rate basis, and ﬁxed rates have not normally been for more than
ﬁve years.In the United States and mainland Europe interest rates are typically ﬁxed for the duration
of the mortgage term (e.g. 25 years).The reason for this preference, on the part of the UK
government, for long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages is the view that the variability of short-term
mortgage rates has contributed to price instability in the UK housing market and that long-term
interest rates are more stable than short-term rates.It is certainly the case that short-term interest
rates are more variable than long-term rates.
The experience of the US Savings and Loan Associations (the American equivalent of the UK
building societies) during the 1980s indicates that there could be dangers in moving to the use of
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
100

long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages.Loans were made at interest rates ﬁxed for periods such as 25 years
whilst those loans were ﬁnanced by taking short-term deposits. Interest rates on deposits
could rise but interest rates on loans were ﬁxed. As interest rates rose the Savings and Loan
Associations were pushed into loss-making situations.Their interest receipts were ﬁxed but their
interest costs rose.
American mortgage providers now reduce those interest rate risks by collaterising the mortgage
loans.This involves bundling mortgages together into a form of bond and selling those bonds to
investors (particularly institutional investors). As a result the assets of the mortgage providers
cease to be long-term ﬁxed-rate loans and become short-term variable-rate deposits.The mortgage
providers thus avoid the risks arising from having ﬁxed-rate assets and variable-rate liabilities. If
long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages become commonplace in the UK, it can be expected that
mortgage-backed bonds will become an important component of the range of available
investments.
An important aspect of the long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages used in the United States is that
borrowers can choose to repay mortgages before they reach their maturity dates,perhaps in order
to replace a mortgage with a new one at a lower interest rate (in the event of interest rates falling).
This is a form of option given to the mortgage borrower by the mortgage provider,and it provides
the borrower with the potential for ﬁnancial gain at the expense of the provider.Options must be
paid for,and the payment would be in the form of an interest rate premium.Interest rates payable
by borrowers will be increased by the amount of the interest rate premium. In consequence the
interest rate payable by the ﬁxed-rate borrower will exceed the average expected future short-term
interest rate.
In the UK,ﬁxed-rate mortgage borrowers face early redemption (repayment) penalties if they
repay their mortgages before the end of the ﬁxed-rate period. Such penalties are often so high as
to make switching to a cheaper mortgage unproﬁtable.When the redemption penalty is added to
the new mortgage cost, the borrower is often no better off after the transfer to the cheaper
mortgage.Lenders impose redemption penalties because they typically ﬁnance ﬁxed-rate mortgage
lending by ﬁxed-rate borrowing. If a borrower redeems (repays) a mortgage when interest rates
fall,in order to switch to a mortgage with the new lower interest rate,the lender is left paying the
high ﬁxed rate whilst no longer receiving the high rate.This produces a loss for the lender,and the
redemption penalty is compensation for the loss.
The Miles Report on the UK Mortgage Market
In December 2003 Professor David Miles produced his ﬁrst report on the UK mortgage market.
A particular focus of the report was on the reasons for the relative lack of long-term ﬁxed-rate
mortgages in the UK. In order to put the report into the context of ﬁnance theory, it is useful to
begin by quoting from a Financial Times editorial on 10 December 2003.
It is easy to describe the perfect mortgage market. Lenders would compete ﬁercely.
Consumers would be well informed.Products on offer would be priced in relation to the
cost of funds. Over the length of the loan, a variable-rate mortgage would generally be
the cheapest.Borrowers would pay a little extra for the beneﬁts of a loan with an up-front
discount.The insurance beneﬁts of a ﬁxed-rate loan against interest rate volatility would
PROPERTY INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGES
101

also attract a premium.And a long-term ﬁxed-rate without redemption penalties would
cost more still.
What this quote is describing is a mortgage market based on the expectations-with-risk-premium
yield curve.The Miles report could be seen as an account of how, and why, the UK mortgage
market differs from what would be expected on the basis of that theory.
The expectations-with-risk-premium theory of the yield curve suggests that long-term interest
rates, which would be the basis for ﬁxed-rate mortgages, are based on averages of current and
expected short-term interest rates.There is an addition to the interest rate, a risk premium, to
compensate investors for the additional (capital) risk of long-term as opposed to short-term
investments.
In the absence of the risk premium,the expected costs of ﬁxed-rate and variable-rate mortgages
would be equal.This arises from the view that long-term interest rates (ﬁxed mortgage rates) are
averages of current and future short-term interest rates (variable mortgage rates). The risk
premium will cause the ﬁxed mortgage rate to be a little higher than the expected average variable
mortgage rate.The risk premium can be seen as the price to be paid for the additional certainty
provided by the ﬁxed-rate.
In some instances ﬁxed-rate mortgages allow the borrower to redeem the mortgage without
penalty.In the event of a fall in long-term interest rates,the borrower can take out a new mortgage
at the lower interest rate and use the proceeds to pay off the existing (high interest) mortgage.
This facility, which is common in the United States, gives the borrower an option.The borrower
has the choice between continuing to borrow at the existing interest rate and switching to a
lower rate,if a lower rate becomes available.The borrower pays for this option by way of an interest
rate premium; the interest rate should be higher than would be the case in the absence of
the option.
The interest rates that banks and building societies charge their mortgage borrowers should
reﬂect the rates at which the banks and building societies can themselves borrow.These are the
interest rates determined in the money and capital markets. If a mortgage initially has a rate of
interest below the market rate (discounted mortgage) it is to be expected that in later years there
will be a higher rate of interest such that, over the life of the mortgage, the average interest rate
paid by the house-buying borrower reﬂects the average interest rate paid by the bank or building
society.
All of these characteristics of a ‘model’mortgage market are based on certain assumptions.One
assumption, which the Miles report believes to be met, is that mortgage providers compete for
business. Another assumption, which is not fully met, is that borrowers are well informed and
rational.
Some borrowers appear to be well informed about mortgage choices whilst others are not.The
result is that banks and building societies compete actively for the business of the informed
borrowers whilst exploiting the uninformed borrowers.The uninformed borrowers subsidise the
informed borrowers.The uninformed borrowers typically pay a standard variable rate, which is
high. Informed borrowers frequently borrow at discounted rates, which are artiﬁcially low as a
result of cross-subsidy from the payers of the standard variable rate.
Borrowers might be divided into four groups: payers of the standard variable rate, borrowers
who initially pay a discounted rate but move to the standard variable rate after the discount period,
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
102

borrowers who move to another discounted rate after the initial discount period (possibly with a
new lender), and borrowers who choose a long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgage.
In the UK very few borrowers have long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages.Those borrowers who opt
for a succession of discounted rate mortgages, taking out a new mortgage (probably with a new
lender) each time the period of discount ends, have paid the least over time.These borrowers,
sometimes known as ‘rate tarts’, have enjoyed a relatively low average rate of interest over the
period during which they have had mortgage debts.The borrowers who have paid the standard
variable rate have paid a higher average interest rate over the life of the mortgage.The Miles report
concluded that those who pay the standard variable rate subsidise the rate tarts.
The report took the view that this cross-subsidy was a reason for the failure of long-term
ﬁxed-rate mortgages to become a signiﬁcant part of the UK mortgage market.The prospect
of a succession of discounted interest rates makes a long-term ﬁxed rate look relatively
expensive.
Another reason suggested for the reluctance to take long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages is the
failure to appreciate the presence and nature of interest rate risk.The report ventured the opinion
that people,typically,do not understand interest rate risk.They are often unaware of the possibility
of substantial interest rate rises.This is related to another opinion of the report: that borrowers
focus excessively on the immediate cost of a mortgage rather than taking a long-term view of
prospective costs over the life of the mortgage. If borrowers fail to appreciate interest rate risk,
they will not be prepared to pay the extra interest (interest rate premium) embodied in long-term
ﬁxed rates as the cost of protection against interest rate rises. So they are reluctant to take out,
apparently expensive, long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages.
The report takes the view that the relative absence of long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages in the
UK is a factor in the high house price volatility in the UK. Short-term interest rates, the rates
upon which variable-rate mortgage interest rates are based, are more volatile than long-term
interest rates, which are the rates that form the basis of long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages. If
borrowers choose variable-rate mortgages,and respond to immediate mortgage costs rather than
long-term prospects,there will be large increases in demand for houses when rates fall and declines
in demand when interest rates rise.The result is house price surges and collapses.
It might be noted that this,apparently short-sighted,behaviour of mortgage borrowers is what
would be expected on the basis of the principles of behavioural ﬁnance. Narrow framing,
retrievability, and anchoring between them predict that people focus on the recent past (narrow
framing), base their views about normal rates on what can be readily observed and recalled
(retrievability), and come to regard such recent interest rates as the norm (anchoring).
The Potential Use of Bond Options
The second part of the Miles report was published in March 2004. One aspect of the second part
was an examination of how mortgage lenders could manage the risk of early repayment of long-
term ﬁxed-rate loans. Lenders would raise money in the capital markets by selling long-term
bonds.The interest rate payable on those bonds would determine the long-term ﬁxed-rate interest
rate charged to mortgage borrowers. In the event that a fall in market interest rates causes
borrowers to repay their mortgages in order to remortgage at the lower rates, the lenders face
losses.The new mortgage lending that replaces the old mortgage lending is at the lower interest
PROPERTY INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGES
103

rate.The lenders are committed to paying interest on the bonds at the high interest rate whilst their
mortgage lending is at the low interest rate.
To mitigate against this loss,mortgage lenders could buy call options on bonds.This strategy is
based on two relationships.First,there is an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest
rates so that a fall in interest rates is associated with a rise in bond prices.Second,rising bond prices
generate pay-offs from call options.The call options provide the right to buy bonds at the old price
(the strike price).The bonds bought at the old (low) price can then be sold at the new (high) price.
So the use of call options provides the mortgage lender with a cash ﬂow that offsets the loss arising
from borrowers who remortgage in order to replace their mortgages with new ones at a lower
interest rate.
Miles also addressed the question as to who would provide the call options. It was suggested
that issuers of bonds, including the UK government, would ﬁnd it advantageous to write (i.e.
sell) call options.Writing call options is a hedging strategy for issuers of bonds.The sale of
the options entails the receipt of a sum of money corresponding to the price (premium) of the
options.That receipt of money offsets any fall in the bond prices that may occur prior to the sale
of the bonds.
The UK debate about the increased use of long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages needs to be seen
against the backdrop of the US debate about the virtues of moving away from them.In the United
States it is being argued that long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages have increased mortgage costs.This
is partly due to the risk premium on long-term loans, which is required to compensate lenders
for the higher risk of lending long term.It is also due to the cost of the call options bought by lenders
seeking to hedge the risk of early repayment of mortgages (a cost which is passed on to borrowers
in the form of higher interest rates).
CAPPED-RATE MORTGAGES
A mortgage that protects against interest rate rises whilst allowing rates to fall is known as a capped
mortgage. Capped mortgages contain an interest rate option that must be paid for (in the same
way that insurance policies have to be paid for).
A capped mortgage sets an upper limit to the variable interest rate to be paid without setting
a lower limit.The borrower avoids very high interest rates but is not committed to a ﬁxed rate.
The bank or building society offering such a mortgage buys an interest rate option from an options
dealer.
An interest rate option (or cap) will compensate for an interest rate rise above a particular
level.The seller of the option undertakes to pay the interest difference if the rate goes above a
particular level.The bank or building society thus has an upper limit to its interest payments, and
is thus able to pass an upper limit on to its customers.
The seller of the option takes on a risk.If interest rates rise the bank or building society receives
payments from the provider of the option,but if rates fall there are no payments to the option dealer.
The seller of the option has potential losses but no prospective gains.The provider of the option
will therefore require payment for the option.This payment will reﬂect the potential for loss.
So the bank or building society must pay for the option. It will pass the cost on to the ultimate
beneﬁciary of the interest rate cap, that is the borrower.This cost will be reﬂected in an addition
to the interest rate that the borrower pays. If the borrower makes an early withdrawal from the
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
104

mortgage agreement, the lender may not have fully recouped the price of the option from
the additional interest payments.The bank or building society may seek a cash payment from the
borrower to compensate for the unpaid portion of the cost of the option. If a borrower insures
against interest rate rises, the insurance has to be paid for irrespective of whether the insurance
subsequently turns out to be required.
In the case of collar mortgages,the lender sets an upper and a lower limit to interest rates.The
beneﬁt of avoiding high interest rates is obtained by forgoing the possibility of low rates. In effect
there are two options:one in the borrower’s favour and one that is potentially unfavourable.Because
the borrower has potential for both gain and loss from options, it may be that there is no net cost
for the options and hence no premium to be added to the mortgage interest rate.The cost of the
favourable option is met by the acceptance of the unfavourable option.The cost of protection from
high interest rates is the inability to beneﬁt from low rates.
OTHER FORMS OF MORTGAGE
Discounted-rate mortgages allow a percentage deduction from the standard variable interest rate
during the ﬁrst few years of the mortgage.This appears to be a marketing device aimed at attracting
business to the mortgage provider.Although there is an automatic transfer to the standard variable
rate when the period of discount ends, lenders will often offer a discounted rate for a further
period if borrowers request it (in order to avoid losing borrowers who switch mortgages in search
of a new discounted rate). Usually there are penalties for repaying mortgages before the end of
the discount period.Such penalties make transfer of a mortgage to a new lender during the discount
period (which entails repayment of the existing mortgage) unattractive.Sometimes mortgages offer
cashbacks, where a lump sum is paid to the borrower. Such cashbacks have to be repaid in the
event of the mortgage being terminated within a prescribed period.
A related product is the graduated-payment mortgage. This differs from the discounted-rate
mortgage in that the low rates of the early years are combined with higher than normal rates in
later years.When graduated-payment mortgages were introduced in the UK there were protests
(supported by seLctions of the media) from mortgage holders who found that they had signed
contracts that allowed them out of relatively high interest rates only at the cost of ﬁnancial penalties.
Graduated-payment mortgages were effectively abandoned in the UK as a result of the adverse
publicity surrounding them.The fact that some people could not understand them resulted in no
one having access to them.This lack of borrower (and media) sophistication in the UK may be the
reason why other types of mortgage popular in North America have not been introduced on a large
scale in the UK.
Two of these other types are balloon mortgagesand shared-appreciation mortgages.Balloon mortgages
may allow interest-only payments for a few years, after which the balloon mortgage is repaid by
taking out a conventional mortgage. Shared-appreciation mortgages entail the lender charging
reduced interest rates in return for a share of any capital gains arising from increases in the value
of the property. An attempt to introduce shared-appreciation mortgages in the UK resulted in
borrower (and media) protests when property price rises led to borrowers losing from the schemes.
Many borrowers were unwilling to accept that if house prices rise rapidly, the cost of shared-
appreciation mortgages would be much higher than the cost of other mortgages.Again,there was
a lack of ﬁnancial sophistication on the part of many borrowers (and sections of the media).
PROPERTY INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGES
105

One form of mortgage that has recently gained popularity in the UK is the offset mortgage.An
offset mortgage sets positive bank (or building society) account balances against a mortgage with
the effect that interest is paid only on the excess of the value of the mortgage over the value of the
positive bank balance. Positive bank balances reduce mortgage interest payments rather than
earning interest. Since interest on bank balances is taxable, this gives a net gain.The disadvantage
of offset mortgages is that the mortgage interest rate is typically higher than rates obtainable on
other types of mortgage.
A related scheme is the current account mortgage.Whereas the offset mortgage involves two
accounts,the mortgage account and the savings account,the current account mortgage entails just
one account. Expenditure increases the total debt and saving reduces it. Interest is payable on
whatever balance is outstanding.
Islamic Mortgages
Islamic teaching prohibits the paying and receipt of interest.Interest,referred to as riba,is banned
under Sharia (Islamic) law since it is regarded as usury. Conventional mortgages are therefore
unacceptable under Sharia law.
Islamic,or Sharia,mortgages avoid the explicit exchange of interest.The bank buys the property
and immediately sells it to the mortgagor at a higher price.The mortgagor pays for the property
in instalments over the term of the mortgage.This arrangement is called murabaha.The difference
between the price paid by the bank and the price at which the property is sold to the mortgagor
is equivalent to the cumulative mortgage interest.
Ownership is shared between the mortgagor and the bank.This is known as musharaka. Over
time,as instalments are paid,the bank’s share of the ownership declines and the mortgagor’s share
of the ownership increases. By the end of the term of the mortgage, the mortgagor gains full
ownership of the property.
EQUITY RELEASE MORTGAGES AND HOME REVERSION PLANS
An equity release mortgage is a means of obtaining an income from a person’s home.A mortgage
is taken out against the person’s property and the proceeds can be used to buy an annuity, which
provides an income for life. No payments are made in respect of the mortgage until the person
dies (or goes into long-term care).The mortgage interest is compounded over time until the
mortgage is repaid upon death.
The longer the person lives, the greater will be the mortgage debt to be repaid from the value
of the property. If the person has a long life, little or nothing of the value of the property would
be left to be passed on to the heirs.The mortgage interest rate tends to be relatively high; partly
to compensate the mortgage lender for the possibility that in some cases the accumulated mortgage
debt will exceed the value of the property.
Home reversion is another means of releasing equity from the value of a person’s home.This
entails exchanging a percentage of the value of the property for a lump sum or income for life (an
annuity).The proportion of the property value exchanged will exceed the proportion received as
cash or annuity value. For example, 50% of the value of the property may be given in exchange
for a cash value of 25%.This difference provides an interest return for the provider of the cash or
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
106

annuity.The person retains the right to live in the property for the rest of their life.The provider
of the cash or annuity receives no money until the property is sold upon the death of the person.
THE MORTGAGE AND ENDOWMENT EQUATIONS
A repayment mortgage entails an initial sum (debt) which is paid off over a succession of ensuing
time periods.The equation showing the periodic (e.g. monthly) payments to be made under a
repayment mortgage agreement is:
p 
where p  periodic payment
M  initial size of mortgage
r  periodic interest rate (annual interest rate/number of payments per year)
T  number of payments (e.g. number of months to maturity).
A factor that affects the application of the mortgage equation is the use of the annual rest.The
annual rest entails the recalculation of the outstanding mortgage debt for interest purposes just
once a year.So payments that reduce the value of the debt have no effect on interest costs until the
following year. Interest continues to be charged on the debt in existence at the beginning of the
year,rather than on the actual size of the debt.Not all mortgage lenders use the annual rest;many
lenders now recalculate the debt on a monthly or daily basis so that capital repayments have a
quick effect on interest costs.
With the annual rest the mortgage payments made during a year are accumulated by the lender,
without interest, and the accumulated sum is used to retire part of the mortgage debt at the end
of the year.When using the mortgage equation, use of the annual rest is equivalent to making
payments annually rather than monthly.Table 5.4 compares monthly mortgage payments without
(on the left) and with (on the right) the annual rest.Table 5.5 compares the accumulated total of
payments over the life of the mortgage in the two cases. (In both cases a ﬁxed interest rate is
assumed. 100,000 is borrowed.)
It can be seen from Table 5.4 that the annual rest raises the monthly payments.It has its greatest
impact when the mortgage term is short and interest rates are high. By multiplying the monthly

payments in Table 5.4 by the number of monthly payments over the term of the mortgage, the
cumulative sum of payments is obtained.The resulting values are shown in Table 5.5.
The annual rest increases the total cumulative payments.The effect is most pronounced when
the interest rate is high and the mortgage term is short.
In the case of loans, including mortgages, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) has to be quoted
to borrowers (in the UK).The APR takes into account not only the frequency of payment and the
annual rest,but also charges and fees that affect the effective rate of interest paid.The APR reﬂects
the ‘total charge for credit’, which includes payments such as fees and administration charges in
addition to the interest payments.
Another factor affecting the application of the mortgage equation is the issue of whether the
mortgage is a ﬂexible mortgage.A ﬂexible mortgage allows for overpayment so that the debt is
reduced more quickly. In the case of some ﬂexible mortgages there is even a facility to miss some
payments.
An endowment is the reverse of a mortgage, it involves a series of payments into a fund that
result in a sum at the end of the term.An endowment mortgage involves paying interest only on
the mortgage debt, which is paid off at maturity from the proceeds of an endowment policy.The
equation for an endowment is:
M  p[(1y)T 1] / y
where M  sum to be accumulated
p  periodic payment
y  rate of return on the endowment fund (per period)
T  number of periods (e.g. months).
The question as to whether an endowment policy will produce a sufﬁcient sum to repay a
mortgage rests on the rate of return on the endowment fund. If the rate of return on the
endowment equals the rate of interest on the mortgage,the endowment and repayment mortgages
will be identical in terms of the size of the periodic payments.This is illustrated by Exhibit 5.2. If
the rate of return on the endowment is higher than the mortgage interest rate, the endowment
mortgage will be the cheaper (or will provide more than enough to pay off the mortgage). If the
rate of return on the endowment is lower than the mortgage interest rate, the endowment
mortgage will entail the higher monthly payments (or will provide insufﬁcient funds to redeem
the mortgage at maturity). Since endowment policies are typically based on stock market

investments the relative performance of the two types of mortgage depends upon whether stock
market returns (net of the charges on an endowment policy) exceed, or fall short of, mortgage
interest rates. History suggests that holders of endowment mortgages would normally be better
off, but they bear more risk.

EXHIBIT 5.2
ENDOWMENT MORTGAGE
An endowment policy can be used to pay off a mortgage debt. For example if returns on an
endowment are 10% p.a., an annual payment of £16,380 into an endowment will be worth
£100,000 in ﬁve years. This can be used to repay a £100,000 debt. An endowment mortgage
involves paying interest on the £100,000 debt each year. If interest rates are 10% p.a., this
amounts to £10,000 p.a. So the total annual payment is £16,380  £10,000  £26,380.
REPAYMENT MORTGAGE
Repayment mortgages involve amortising the debt (gradually paying it off).
Mortgage repayment schedule on a £100,000 ﬁve-year debt with interest ﬁxed at 10% p.a.
There is a constant payment (interest plus repayment) of £26,380 each year. The £2 surplus
arises because of rounding to the nearest pound.
The annual payments on the two types of mortgage are the same (£26,380) because the rate
of return on the endowment fund equals the mortgage interest rate.

Have Endowment Mortgages Been a Bad Choice?
Since the late 1990s endowment mortgages have fallen into disrepute in the UK because in many
cases they failed to provide enough money at maturity to repay the mortgage debts.Correspondingly
there have been accusations that endowment mortgages were mis-sold.However,Booth and Rodney
(2002) made the point that the negative perception may be based on money illusion, which is
the failure to distinguish between real and nominal (i.e. money) values (see Chapter 3 on interest
rates and money market investments in relation to the distinction between nominal and real
interest rates).
The period since the early 1990s has been one in which inﬂation has fallen. Correspondingly
interest rates (nominal interest rates) have fallen. The returns on the investments in which
endowment policies are invested fell in consequence of the general fall in interest rates (and
associated fall in returns on investments such as bonds).As a result values of endowment policies,
in money terms,rose less rapidly than had been expected.The mortgage debts to be repaid when
the endowment policies matured were speciﬁed in money terms.The failure of the money values
of endowment policies to grow sufﬁciently to match the money values of the mortgage debts left

many people with shortfalls;their endowment policy values fell short of the mortgage debts to be
repaid.
The failure of the money values of endowment policies to grow to the anticipated values does
not mean that the policies failed to perform in real terms. The failure on the part of the
policyholders (and their advisers) was to incorrectly forecast the course of inﬂation. Looking at
the matter in real terms, the real values of the mortgage debts did not fall as rapidly as had been
expected. Over the period of the mortgages inﬂation, by eroding the value of money, eroded the
value of the mortgage debts.When the mortgages,and endowment policies,were commenced the
anticipated repayment at maturity would have been based on the real value of the endowment
policies rising whilst the real values of the mortgage debts fell.The problem can be seen as one in
which the endowment policies performed as expected in real terms, but in which the real values
of mortgage debts fell less rapidly than expected. In other words the fall in the rate of inﬂation
reduced the rate at which money lost its real value and hence reduced the rate at which the real
value of mortgage debts fell.
Thus far it appears that the people with endowment mortgages lost out, whether values are
expressed in money terms or real terms.However,they gained from a fall in interest rates.Lower
inﬂation is associated with lower nominal interest rates, which are interest rates in money terms.
The lower rate of decline in the real value of the mortgage debts would have been (approximately)
offset by lower nominal interest rates.
Nominal interest rates could be seen as real interest rates plus compensation for inﬂation
(compensation for the fall in the value of money).The element of nominal interest rates that
compensates for inﬂation fell because inﬂation was lower.The lower inﬂation caused slower erosion
in the real value of the mortgage debts. Endowment mortgage holders experienced shortfalls
because the fall in inﬂation rates reduced their total monthly payments (endowment policy
premiums plus mortgage interest).They were losers at the time that mortgages and endowment
policies matured, but had been gainers before the maturity dates.
COLLATERALISED LOANS AS OPTIONS
Mortgages are collateralised loans. A collateralised loan is a loan against which the borrower
provides collateral as security for the lender. In the case of mortgages, the collateral is usually
property; in most instances it is the property that is purchased with the proceeds of the loan.
Imagine that someone borrows £500,000 to buy a home, and that within a year local
circumstances have changed so dramatically that the market value of the property has fallen to
£25,000. Many people would choose to default on the loan.
A call option gives the right to buy something at a particular price, without the obligation to
do so.A mortgage can be seen as giving the borrower the right to buy the property for the value
of the mortgage (any deposit paid for the property is history and is no longer relevant to the
decision-making). If the value of the property rises, or stays above or near the value of the loan,
the borrower continues to make the mortgage payments.The borrower is said to exercise the right
to buy the property.If the value of the property were to fall below the value of the loan (a situation
known as negative equity) the borrower might choose to default on the loan.The borrower chooses
not to exercise the option to buy.(Of course by doing so the borrower could effectively forfeit the
chance of obtaining future loans.)
BASICS OF MONEY, BOND, AND PROPERTY MARKETS
112

The mortgage lender is giving the borrower an option.The lender might expect some payment
for the option in the form of a higher interest rate. Such an interest rate enhancement would
depend upon the likelihood of default. A borrower who has paid a substantial deposit (down
payment) on the property starts with the value of the loan being much less than the value of the
property.Such a borrower is unlikely to default because a substantial property price fall is required
to bring the value of the property down to below the value of the loan. Someone taking out a
mortgage equal to the value of the property (a 100% mortgage) is more likely to default.Any fall
in the value of the property induces negative equity and the incentive to default. So mortgage
lenders are likely to charge higher interest rates for 100% mortgages, or to levy other charges
(perhaps in the form of insurance premiums).
CONCLUSION
Residential property can be regarded as a form of investment. It can take the form of one’s own
home, or a property bought for the purpose of letting to tenants. One attraction of investing in
property is that it can be done in a geared manner;in other words the property can be bought with
borrowed money. Disadvantages include the inability to obtain a well-diversiﬁed portfolio of
properties,and the lack of liquidity (property is expensive to sell and cannot be sold very quickly).
Commercial property can be bought indirectly through institutional investments such as unit
trusts,investment trusts,property company shares,insurance bonds,and pension funds.However
management charges can be relatively high, and there is no possibility of reducing management
charges by buying an index tracker fund.
Property prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply.In consequence prices can
fall as well as rise.There have been times when many people have forgotten that property prices
can fall.As Coggan (2006a) states:‘When investors think any asset is “safe”and cannot fall in value,
they bid its price up to a level at which their intuition no longer applies.’ Not only can investors
forget that investment in property has risks but also property investment decisions are subject to
the same psychological biases as other investment decisions (see Chapter 2 on personal investment
decisions).There is a common perception that investment in property has provided greater gains
than stock market investment.The historical evidence does not clearly support this belief.
The gearing offered by property investment takes the form of mortgages. Mortgages come in
a wide variety of forms:variable,ﬁxed,discounted,capped,interest-only,and Islamic being some
of the popular mortgages in the UK.Capped mortgages entail the use of options.An interest rate
option is a form of derivative that provides insurance against adverse interest rate changes.A holder
of a capped mortgage must expect to pay for the option by way of higher interest rate payments,
just as other forms of insurance must be paid for.
An interest-only mortgage is usually combined with an endowment policy whose purpose is
to eventually pay off the mortgage debt.An endowment policy is a form of institutional investment,
which accumulates an investment sum over a period of years in the anticipation that the sum
accumulated will be sufﬁcient to repay the mortgage debt when the mortgage reaches its maturity

date (see Chapter 10 on life assurance and assurance-related investments).Repayment mortgages
gradually pay off the mortgage debt over time; slowly reducing the debt in the early years but
more rapidly in the later years.There has been some concern, particularly at government level,
about the economic implications of the UK preference for variable as opposed to ﬁxed-interest
rate mortgages.
There are also facilities to turn a property into an income. Equity release entails taking out a
mortgage loan in order to buy an annuity for the purpose of providing a pension (see Chapter 11
on pensions).

Part 2
Basics of Stock Markets


Chapter 6
Stock exchanges
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The purpose and functions of stock exchanges.
2. The distinction between primary and secondary markets.
3. Types of stock exchange.
4. Stock market trading systems.
5. Bid-offer spreads.
6. Types of purchase and sale order.
7. Processes by which shares are issued.
8. Different types of share.
THE FUNCTIONS OF A STOCK EXCHANGE
The main purpose of a stock exchange is the transfer of money from investors to those wishing to
obtain capital.The investors buy shares and bonds from issuers and thereby transfer money to
them in exchange for potential future cash ﬂows.
In the absence of a ﬁnancial intermediary such as a stock exchange,the direct transfer of money
from investors to those wishing to obtain funds would be problematical for a number of reasons.
First,there would be the difﬁculty of how investors and those seeking funds are to ﬁnd each other.
Second, companies and governments want to raise large amounts of capital whereas individual
investors normally want to invest relatively small sums. Individual investors have limited sums to
invest, and they usually prefer to spread their investments amongst a number of companies so as
to avoid the risk of suffering heavily from the poor performance of one ﬁrm.A stock exchange
provides size transformation:relatively small sums from a large number of investors are aggregated
so as to provide a large sum for the ﬁrm or organisation raising capital.
Third, stock exchanges provide maturity transformation. Companies need to obtain funds for
the long term,whereas investors typically want immediate access to their money.A stock exchange
117

provides a means of reconciling these two objectives. A ﬁrm may sell securities with distant
maturities (or, in the case of ordinary shares, with no maturity date) whilst the buyers of such
securities can obtain quick access to their money by selling the securities (securities include shares
and bonds).
Another function of a stock exchange, which is performed as a byproduct of the ﬁnancial
intermediation, is to communicate information about the companies whose securities are being
traded.The prices of stocks and bonds reﬂect the evaluation of investors and dealers (some of
whom carry out very detailed analyses of the ﬁrms) of the performance of the ﬁrms.Share prices,
and their changes, can communicate information of value to those inside as well as those outside
the companies whose shares are being traded.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MARKETS
When stocks and bonds are initially issued they are said to be sold in the primary market.
Subsequent to their initial sale they are traded in the secondary markets.Primary trading involves
buying and selling newly created securities,whereas secondary trading involves shares and bonds
that are already in existence.The fact that ﬁnancial investments can be sold in a secondary market
renders them more liquid, and hence more attractive.This enhanced liquidity makes investors
more willing to buy in the primary market, and causes them to be less demanding in terms of
required rates of return.An active secondary market improves the operation of the primary market
and allows companies to raise money easily and on favourable terms. Secondary-market trading
volume far exceeds the level of primary-market dealing.
The secondary market is the market in which previously issued securities are traded. It is the
means by which stocks or bonds bought in the primary market can be converted into cash.The
knowledge that assets purchased in the primary market can easily and cheaply be resold in the
secondary market makes investors more prepared to provide borrowers with funds by buying in
the primary market.A successful primary market depends upon an effective secondary market.
If transaction costs are high in the secondary market the proceeds from the sale of securities
will be reduced, and the incentive to buy in the primary market would be lower. Also high
transaction costs in the secondary market might tend to reduce the volume of trading and thereby
reduce the ease with which secondary market sales can be executed.It follows that high transaction
costs in the secondary market could reduce that market’s effectiveness in rendering primary market
assets liquid.In consequence there would be adverse effects on the level of activity in the primary
market and hence on the total level of investment in the economy.
Price volatility in the secondary market might also be detrimental to the operation of the
primary market.High volatility means that buyers in the primary market stand a considerable risk
of losing money by having to sell at a lower price in the secondary market.This can reduce the
motivation to buy in the primary market.Two factors that affect the price volatility of securities
in the secondary market are the depth and breadth of that market.
The depth of the market is based on the likely appearance of new orders stimulated by any
movement in price.If a rise in price brings forth numerous sell orders,the price rise will be small.
A decline in price that stimulates many buy orders would be a small decline.A deep market would
be characterised by the appearance of orders that tend to dampen the extent of any movement in
price. Greater depth is thus associated with lower volatility.
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
118

The breadth of the market reﬂects the number and diversity of the traders in the market.
If there is a large number of market participants with differing motivations and expectations
there is less likely to be substantial price changes than would be expected when there is a
small number of traders, or when the traders have common views such that they buy or sell
together. A broad market is a large heterogeneous market characterised by relative price
stability.
STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING
If a company wants its shares to be traded on a stock exchange, the shares must be listed on that
stock exchange.The ability to sell shares on the stock exchange makes people more willing to
invest in the company. Consequently they would accept a lower return on the shares and hence
the company can raise capital more cheaply.The stock exchange also provides a market price for
the shares, and thereby allows a valuation of the company.
Listing requires a substantial amount of documentation from the company,especially in terms
of published accounts.The substantial amount of documentation is costly for the company but is
useful for investors who want detailed information before investing.The information helps to
establish the correct share price.More certainty about the correctness of the share price encourages
investors and reduces the return that they require. Hence the cost of capital to the company is
reduced.
The information aids corporate governance, which entails monitoring the management of the
company.This governance is conducted by investors (especially institutional investors) and by the
media.A stock exchange listing makes takeover bids easier, since the predator company is able to
buy shares on the stock market.
TYPES OF STOCK EXCHANGE
In many countries there are both national and regional stock exchanges.National exchanges tend
to trade the stocks of large companies. National exchanges impose demanding listing conditions.
If shares in a company are to trade on a stock exchange, they must be listed.The exchange may
prescribe criteria for listing in terms of history of the company,its proﬁts,its capital,the integrity
of its management, and possibly other factors. Shares in a ﬁrm can be traded on a stock exchange
only if the stock exchange authorities give approval:that is list the stock.Examples of national stock
exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, London Stock
Exchange,Tokyo Stock Exchange,and the Frankfurt Borse.A single stock exchange,the Euronext
exchange, covers France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal.
Regional exchanges tend to cater for the stocks of smaller companies.Their listing requirements
are normally less stringent than those of the national exchanges.The ﬁnancial costs involved in
obtaining a listing also tend to be lower. So it is easier for a company to get its shares traded on a
regional exchange,but probably at the cost of being traded on a less liquid market (i.e.on a market
in which there is a lower frequency, and smaller volume, of trading). Regional stock exchanges
also cater for small stockbroking ﬁrms by offering cheaper membership than the national
exchanges. Examples of regional stock exchanges include the Paciﬁc and Midwest exchanges in
the United States, Osaka and Nagoya in Japan, Munich and Hamburg in Germany.
STOCK EXCHANGES
119

In addition to formal stock exchanges there are over-the-counter (OTC) markets. At one
extreme these markets are unorganised with trading taking place between individuals on an
unregulated basis, typically there is no restriction on the ability of people to buy and sell outside
of organised exchanges.At the other extreme over-the-counter markets may be highly organised
and sophisticated.Examples of organised over-the-counter markets are the NASDAQ and upstairs
markets in the United States.
The NASDAQ market specialises in the trading of high technology stocks.Trading takes place
via telephone or computer contacts.Market-makers display the prices at which they are prepared
to buy and sell on computer networks. Investors, normally via brokers, trade with the market-
makers by means of telephone or computer links.The upstairs market is mainly used by institutional
investors and handles large buy and sell orders (block trades).When an institution places an order
with a broker, traders at the brokerage ﬁrm will contact other institutions in an attempt to ﬁnd
one willing to trade.In the absence of ﬁnding a trading counterparty,the dealers at the stockbroking
ﬁrm will attempt to execute the order with market-makers.
Shares in a company may be listed on more than one stock exchange.This is referred to as
multiple listing. Shares in a company may also be simultaneously traded on formal exchanges and
over-the-counter markets. Stocks of very large multinational companies may be traded on more
than one national stock exchange. For example the London Stock Exchange lists more than 600
foreign stocks.Trading in such stocks can effectively be global and may operate on a 24-hour basis
(as one exchange closes,trading may continue on others).This is one dimension of the globalisation
of ﬁnancial markets: that is the tendency for ﬁnancial markets in different countries to become
integrated into a single market.A major factor leading to globalisation has been the development
of telecommunications. Other factors have been the tendencies towards international
diversiﬁcation of portfolios, and deregulation of national ﬁnancial markets.
STOCK MARKET TRADING SYSTEMS
Order-driven Systems
Order-driven systems operate by matching buy and sell orders. Investors are proactive in terms
of both price and quantity. Orders to buy and sell determine stock prices. Stock prices move
towards the level at which orders to buy are matched by orders to sell.This can be illustrated by
demand and supply curves as shown in Figure 6.1.
In Figure 6.1, PA is the ask (or offer) price which is the price at which investors buy. PB is the
bid price, at which investors sell. Investors offering PA or more will buy at PA. Sellers requiring
PB or less will sell at PB.The quantity that buyers demand at PA matches the quantity that sellers
wish to supply at PB.The excess of PA over PB is known as the bid-offer or bid-ask spread (the scale
of Figure 6.1 greatly exaggerates the size of the spread).
In an order-driven system stock prices are determined directly by demand and supply.The
agent or body facilitating the trading process (the stock exchange) holds no position in shares and
is entirely reactive to those seeking to buy or sell.
Order-driven systems involve investors stating the quantities that they wish to buy or sell.The
quantities may be linked with maximum buying,or minimum selling,prices.These are limit orders
in which buyers state the highest price they are willing to pay and sellers state the lowest price they
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
120

will accept.Alternatively an order could simply state a quantity,with an acceptance of the market
price (these are known as market or ‘at best’orders).The operation is illustrated by Table 6.1,which
shows a hypothetical situation at the beginning of a trading day.
Table 6.1 illustrates the demand and supply schedules for a share.At a high share price, 105p,
there are only 1 million shares demanded by potential buyers.At lower share prices more investors
want to buy the shares.When the share price is low,at 95p,investors want to buy 6 million shares.
At a high share price,105p,many investors want to sell shares.At 105p,8.5 million shares are
offered for sale. At lower share prices investors are less keen to sell. At a price of 95p only
1.5 million shares are offered for sale.

The buy orders might consist of 1 million market orders (investors willing to accept whatever
the market price may be), with the remainder being limit orders (stipulating a maximum buying
price).The quantities are cumulative, for example the orders at 103p comprise the market (‘at
best’) orders plus the 103p limit orders plus orders with higher limit prices (i.e.the 2 million shares
are the desired purchases by those investors willing to pay 103p or more).
The sell orders might consist of 1.5 million market (‘at best’) orders,with the remainder being
limit orders. Again the quantities are cumulative. However, as opposed to the buy orders, the
cumulative number of sell orders increases with increasing price.The fall in the cumulative number
of buy orders and rise in the cumulative number of sell orders at progressively higher share prices
is consistent with a downward sloping demand curve and upward sloping supply curve.
At the beginning of the trading day the stock price will be set at the level that results in the
highest number of shares traded.The stock exchange would establish a price at which the largest
possible number of investors can carry out their desired trades.That price is 99p per share.At 99p
there are 3.2 million shares traded.All the sellers can trade and buyers can buy 3.2 out of their
desired 3.5 million shares. At any other price fewer shares would be traded, and hence fewer
investors would be satisﬁed. For example at a price of 98p only 3 million shares would change
hands,and potential buyers would fail to acquire 2 million of the desired shares.At a price of 100p,
there would be 3 million shares traded.In that case sellers would be unable to sell all that they want
to (0.75 million shares would be unsold).At the share price of 99p the highest possible number
of shares are traded;and the largest possible number of investors are able to carry out their desired
transactions.
After the trades at 99p are executed the number of remaining orders at each price would
be as shown in Table 6.2.Table 6.2 shows the situation immediately after 3.2 million shares
have been traded at 99p per share.All the investors that were willing to sell at 99p or less have
been able to sell,and so there are no investors wanting to sell at 99p or less.Most of the potential
buyers who were willing to pay 99p or more have been able to buy.The unsatisﬁed demand is just
0.3 million shares (in Table 6.2 it is assumed that the highest price offered by the unsatisﬁed
investors is 99p, although it is possible that some of the unsatisﬁed potential buyers are willing to
pay more).
The buy and sell orders in Table 6.2 would be limit orders. Limit orders specify maximum
buying prices or minimum selling prices.A limit order to buy stipulates the highest price that the
buyer is prepared to pay. A seller using a limit order indicates the lowest price that would be
acceptable.
A market order is an order to buy or sell at the best available price.If an investor makes a market
order to buy in the situation of Table 6.2, the purchase would be at 100p (so long as the desired
purchase is for 0.55 million shares or less).The price of 100p is the lowest price at which sellers
are willing to sell.An investor who makes a market order to sell in the circumstances of Table 6.2
would sell at 99p (so long as the sale is of 0.3 million shares or less).The price of 99p is the highest
price at which buyers are willing to buy.(It might be noted that this provides a bid-offer spread of
1p, i.e. 100p – 99p where 100p is the offer price and 99p is the bid price.)
New limit orders would either add to the existing number of orders, or would allow existing
orders to be satisﬁed. For example a new limit order to buy at 98p or less would add to the
unsatisﬁed demand at 98p.A new limit order to buy at 100p or less could be immediately satisﬁed
by being matched with limit order sellers who are prepared to sell at 100p (so long as the purchase
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
122

is of 0.55 million shares or less).This would allow some limit order sales to be executed at 100p,
thereby reducing the number of sell orders at 100p in Table 6.2 to less than 0.55 million.
A new limit order to sell at 101p or more would add to the size of the orders in Table 6.2.A
new limit order to sell at 99p or more could be satisﬁed immediately at a price of 99p (so long as
it is for 0.3 million shares or less). It would reduce the number of unsatisﬁed buy orders. For
example a limit order to sell 0.1 million shares at 99p would reduce the outstanding buy orders
at 99p from 0.3 million shares to 0.2 million shares.
Limit orders remain on the limit order book until they are withdrawn by the investors,or until
they can be executed as a result of new orders arriving.The arrival of buy orders at 100p or above
will allow execution of some of the sell orders in Table 6.2. If sell orders at 99p or less are
submitted, some of the buy orders in Table 6.2 can be executed. In this way order matching can
be continuous throughout the trading day.Typically these order-driven matching systems are
computerised.
If some but not all orders at a price can be executed, the oldest orders get priority. Normally
buyers and sellers are not shown the whole of the limit order book,only the highest buy price and
the lowest sell price are shown (99p and 100p in Table 6.2).
Quote-driven Systems
In a quote-driven system, market-makers quote prices at which they are willing to sell (offer or
ask prices) and prices at which they are willing to buy from investors (bid prices). Stockbrokers
(on behalf of private investors),or institutional investors,transact with the market-makers on the
basis of the quotes provided. Market-makers are proactive and investors reactive in terms of the
prices.The ﬁrms that operate as market-makers are usually banks or stockbrokers.
Market-makers, or dealers as they are sometimes known, trade as principals. Trading as
principals entails buying and selling for their own account and holding positions in the stocks for

which they make a market.In terms of transactions,they are reactive rather than proactive.Their
trading is in response to buy or sell orders from investors. If they wish to change their stock
positions, they must move their price quotes.
If investors are net buyers, market-makers would ﬁnd that their stockholdings decline. If they
want to stop such a decline, they raise their quoted prices so as to deter buyers and encourage
sellers. Conversely net sales by investors might raise the stockholdings of market-makers to
undesirable levels. In response, market-makers would lower prices in order to encourage buyers
and deter sellers. In these ways, the price quotes of market-makers respond to the pressures of
demand and supply.
The excess of the offer price over the bid price is known as the bid-offer spread. It provides a
source of proﬁt for the market-maker as well as compensating for the risks inherent in the process
of market-making.The market bid-offer spread is the excess of the lowest offer price over the
highest bid price and is normally smaller than the spreads of individual market-makers.
Bid-offer Spreads
Bid-offer spreads (alternatively known as bid-ask spreads) are the spreads between the buying and
selling prices of share dealers. A dealer, operating as a market-maker, quotes a price at which
he/she is prepared to sell – the offer price – and a price at which he/she is willing to buy – the
bid price.The offer price is always above the bid price.The difference between the offer and bid
prices,the bid-offer spread,is the proﬁt of the dealer.The question arises as to what factors affect
the bid-offer spread.
From the perspective of investors, dealers (in their role as market-makers) provide two
important services.The ﬁrst is immediacy.The dealer sells from, and adds to, their own holdings
of a stock in order to accommodate the trades of investors.As a result investors can immediately
execute a trade without having to wait for a counterparty to emerge. For example a buyer need
not wait for a seller to come forward since the dealer stands ready to sell.
A second service is the maintenance of price stability. For example buy orders, in the absence
of corresponding sell orders, would tend to push up prices. Sell orders would push prices down.
By being willing to trade from their own stockholdings, dealers reduce such price ﬂuctuations.
The bid-offer spread of dealers can be seen as the price to be paid, by investors, for these
services.The spread can also be seen,from the perspective of the dealer,as compensation for costs
and risks.The costs would include the administrative costs of transferring shares.The risks arise
from price ﬂuctuations and information-based investors.
A dealer,who operates as a market-maker,holds shares.The dealer is at risk from a fall in share
prices when shares are held (and from a price rise when the dealer has a short position).The bid-
offer spread can be seen as a source of compensation for accepting such risks. For shares that are
infrequently traded, such as shares in smaller companies, the risks are greater.This is because
positions are held for longer between trades. If shares are held for a long time, the risk of losses
from price falls is greater.As a result the bid-offer spreads for such shares tend to be relatively high.
Another form of risk arises from the possibility that some investors may possess information
that the dealer does not. Such investors are able to make proﬁts at the expense of the dealer. For
example if an investor has information that suggests a share price fall, that investor could sell the
shares to the dealer at a price that turns out to be high. It is the dealer who suffers the loss from a
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
124

fall in the share price.The bid-offer spread can be viewed as providing the dealer with compensation
for bearing the risk that such information-based trading may occur.
Markets in which the Trading Systems Operate
Order-driven systems are the most common.They predominate in Europe and the Far East.In the
United States there is considerable use of quote-driven systems.NASDAQ,which has become the
main market in North America for high technology stocks,is quote-driven.Market-makers display
their quotes on computer screens. Investors (or brokers on their behalf) will buy or sell at the
quoted prices by means of computer or telephone links.
Hybrid systems combine order-driven and quote-driven systems.The New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) is probably the best known example of a hybrid system. On the NYSE there are ﬁrms
acting as ‘specialists’. Each stock is allocated to a specialist. Specialists will operate by matching
orders when there is a sufﬁcient volume of trading.When trading volumes are low, such that
matching buy and sell orders is not possible, specialists will act as market-makers (providing a
quote-driven system). In other words, to the extent to which specialists are unable to match buy
and sell orders they will trade on their own account.They buy from unmatched sellers, and sell
to unmatched buyers. In this way they maintain the liquidity of the market.
It is to be noted that trades do not have to go through a specialist.There will be a ‘crowd’ of
traders and brokers around each specialist.Members of this crowd are able to trade with each other.
This is possibly an additional source of both order-driven and quote-driven trading.
On the New York Stock Exchange, specialists have the additional function of ensuring orderly
markets.This function requires them to ensure that price changes between one deal and the next
are small.To achieve this they must sell in rising markets and buy in falling markets.Whilst most
of the time the specialists succeed in moderating price movements,the system broke down during
the stock market crash of October 1987. At the height of the crash, many specialists stopped
trading.They lacked the resources to cope with the huge volumes of sell orders with which they
were presented.
The London Stock Exchange also uses a hybrid system. The major stocks (including the
constituents of the FTSE 100 Index) are traded by order-driven matching. Smaller stocks are
traded on a quote-driven (market-maker) basis. Up to 1996 all stocks were traded by means of a
quote-driven system.The change to a hybrid system reﬂected the belief that for major stocks
order-driven systems generate lower bid-offer spreads, whilst for smaller stocks market-makers
are required in order to ensure liquid markets.There is also a market-maker system for small deals
in the major stocks, but the prices have to reﬂect the prices in the order-driven market.
Most other exchanges in the world are purely order-driven.However market-makers are often
very important to order-driven as well as to quote-driven systems. In particular the limit orders
in order-driven systems often come from market-makers. Market-makers may be especially
important in continuous-matching order-driven systems.They provide trades when other potential
counter-parties are absent.In these ways market-makers provide liquidity to order-driven systems.
In the UK trading in gilts (government bonds) is quote-driven. Gilt-Edged Market-Makers
(GEMMs) provide continuous two-way prices (bid-offer).They are obliged to trade at their quoted
prices if approached by investors or their brokers.To facilitate this role they are able to borrow
gilts from institutional investors via money-brokers.They are also able to borrow money through
STOCK EXCHANGES
125

money-brokers.These borrowing facilities are essential for the maintenance of the ability to meet
their obligations to buy and sell at their quoted prices.
TYPES OF ORDER
An investor who wants to buy shares on a stock exchange has a number of different types of order
available.The simplest,and most common,is the market order.A market order stipulates that the
shares should be traded at the most favourable price available.The most favourable price would be
the lowest available price for a purchase, and the highest available price for a sale.The trade takes
place at a price that is currently available in the market.
Other types of order specify particular prices. A buy limit order speciﬁes that the purchase
should take place only if the price is at, or below, a speciﬁed level.A sell limit order speciﬁes a
minimum selling price such that the trade should not take place unless that price,or more,can be
obtained.
A market-if-touched order becomes a market order if the share price reaches a particular level.
This differs from a limit order in that there is no upper limit to the buying price,or lower limit to
the selling price.As soon as there has been a trade in the market at the speciﬁed price, the order
becomes a market order.The speciﬁed price is not necessarily obtained.
A stop order is also an order that becomes a market order once there has been a trade in the
market at a particular price.However it involves selling after the price has fallen to a speciﬁed level,
or buying after the price has risen to a level. Stop orders are concerned with protecting proﬁts,
or limiting losses.They seek to ensure that a selling price is not too low, or that a buying price is
not too high.
Another dimension to an order is the length of time for which it remains in force.A ﬁll-or-kill
order is to be cancelled if it cannot be executed immediately.An open order, otherwise known as
a good-till-cancelled order, remains in force until it is speciﬁcally cancelled by the investor.
Alternatively the investor can specify the period of time for which the order should remain open,
e.g. a day, a week, or a month.
SELLING SHARES IN THE PRIMARY MARKET
The sale of shares in the primary market entails the sale of newly created shares.These may be the
ﬁrst issue of shares by a newly ﬂoated company.The other source of new shares is the issue of
additional shares where an initial issue has already taken place.
The issue of shares by a company that has not previously sold shares could be through a number
of routes.Three popular means of issue are public offers, tenders, and placements. Public offers
invite investors, including private investors, to subscribe for shares. Often there would be
application forms in newspapers.The share price would be set by the issuing company. Investors
would choose the number of shares for which they apply. If the aggregate number applied for
exceeds the number being issued, individual investors may receive fewer shares than the number
for which they applied.
Tenders invite investors to quote prices.Those quoting the highest prices receive the shares for
which they apply.Placements involve the investment bank,which is handling the share issue,selling
the shares to institutional investors. Placements do not involve general invitations to apply for
shares. Selected institutions are approached directly.

EXHIBIT 6.1
RIGHTS ISSUES
A one for four rights issue entails one new share for every four held. A one for four rights issue
may be at 160p when the current share price is 200p.
It is to be expected that the rights issue would cause the share price to fall by 
200p  192p  8p.

Introductions take place when there are already a number of shareholders,and the company is
simply seeking permission for the shares to trade on the stock exchange. Introductions do not
entail raising capital.They may be part of the process of moving from AIM (Alternative Investment
Market) to the main market, or may allow a foreign company to have its shares traded in London
as well as in its home country.
The issue of additional shares,when shares in the company are already in the market,is normally
by means of rights issues. In many countries, any addition to the total number of shares must be
offered ﬁrst to existing shareholders.The offer would be in proportion to the number of shares
already held.For example a one for two rights issue entails one new share being offered for every
two already held.
To encourage the take up of the offer, the new shares are usually offered at a lower price than
the existing shares.One effect of this discount is that the share price subsequent to the rights issue
is lower than the share price before it. For example if the shares are initially 100p and there is a
one for two rights issue at 70p,the share price might be expected to fall to 90p [(100p  100p 
70p)/3  90p].As an alternative to buying additional shares,investors can sell their rights to new
shares. In the current example, the buyer of such rights obtains the ability to pay 70p for shares
that are expected to be worth 90p.
Share issues are often underwritten by banks.A bank underwriting a share issue agrees, for a
fee,to buy any shares not taken up by investors.This guarantees that the issuing company receives
the money that it expects. In the case of rights issues, ﬁrms sometimes avoid paying a fee to
underwriters by using the deep discount route. In a rights issue, failure to sell the new shares
would result from the share price (prior to the issue) falling below the sale price of the new shares.
The deep discount method prices the new shares at such a low level that the market price is
extremely unlikely to fall so far.

127

Instead of exercising the right to buy at 160p, the investor could sell the right. The price
receivable could be around 192p – 160p  32p, since the buyer has the right to buy shares for
160p when they are prospectively worth 192p.
DEEP DISCOUNT
A one for one rights issue may be used.
Instead of exercising the right to buy at the discounted price an investor could sell the rights.
In the one for one case, the rights might be sold for 80p (120p40p).
It might be noted that the one for four rights issue at 160p raises the same amount of money
as the one for one rights issue at 40p (the latter involves selling four times the number of shares
at a quarter of the price).

TYPES OF SHARE
The most common type of share is known as the ordinary share (alternatively referred to as
common stock). Ordinary shares represent part ownership of the issuing company.They pay
dividends at regular intervals (typically every six months).The sizes of the dividends are at the
discretion of the issuing company, and are likely to be related to the level of proﬁt made by the
company.There is no legal obligation for the company to pay dividends.In the case of bankruptcy,
holders of ordinary shares are the last to receive any proceeds from the winding up of the company,
and typically will receive nothing. However the holders of ordinary shares are not liable for any
outstanding debts of the company.
Shareholders (the holders of ordinary shares) are residual claimants on a company’s proﬁts and
assets.Creditors have to be paid before shareholders.In bad times there may be no proﬁts left for
the shareholders after the creditors have been paid. In good times the creditors (who include
bondholders) get the same amount as usual; the additional proﬁts and asset values belong to the
shareholders. Ordinary shares are therefore risky, but have the potential to be very proﬁtable.
Another type of share is the preference (or preferred) share. In some ways preference shares
are more similar to bonds than to ordinary shares. In particular, most pay a ﬁxed dividend each
year and typically do not confer voting rights on the holder. Unlike bonds, preference shares
constitute part ownership of the issuing company and the company does not have a legal obligation
to pay the dividends.The absence of the legal obligation to pay dividends is related to the fact that
preference shares are seen as part of the equity of the company rather than the debt of the company
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
128

STOCK EXCHANGES
129
(bonds are debts).However no dividends can be paid to the holders of ordinary shares if preference
shareholders have not received their full dividend payments.In the event of bankruptcy the holders
of preference shares have a prior right,relative to the holders of ordinary shares,to the receipt of
remaining assets. However bondholders, and other creditors, have a prior right to the holders of
preference shares.
There are many varieties of preference share.These varieties include:
■cumulative preference shares
■non-cumulative preference shares
■redeemable preference shares
■convertible preference shares
■participating preference shares
■stepped preference shares.
With the exception of the ﬁrst two,these characteristics are not mutually exclusive.For example
it is possible to issue non-cumulative, redeemable, convertible preference shares.
Cumulative preference shares entail the obligation on the part of the issuing company to pay
any missed past dividends before any dividends are paid to the holders of ordinary shares. Non-
cumulative preference shares entail no such obligation with the effect that missed dividends may
be lost forever. A redeemable preference share has a maturity date on which the original sum
invested is repaid, whereas most preference shares have no maturity date (the issuer may pay the
dividends forever and never repay the principal sum).Some redeemable preference shares provide
the issuer with the right to redeem at a predetermined price without the obligation to do so; in
effect such preference shares provide the issuer with a call option,which would be paid for by means
of a higher dividend for the investors. Convertible preference shares give the holder the right to
convert preference shares into ordinary shares at a predetermined rate; the investor pays nothing
to convert apart from surrendering the convertible preference shares. In some cases the right to
convert arises only in the event of a failure to pay dividends.Participating preference shares allow
the issuing company to increase the dividends if proﬁts are particularly high;the preference share
dividend can exceed the ﬁxed level if the dividend on ordinary shares is greater than a speciﬁed
amount. Stepped preference shares pay a dividend that increases in a predetermined way.
CONCLUSION
Stock exchanges exist to facilitate the transfer of funds from savers to organisations, which need
to raise money.They also provide a means whereby existing investors can sell their investments.
Stock exchanges may be order-driven,quote-driven,or a hybrid of these two systems.In all stock
market trading systems, the forces of demand and supply determine share prices. In addition to
market orders,which accept the ruling share price,it is possible to place limit orders which specify
upper limits to buying prices or lower limits to selling prices. Newly issued shares are said to be

sold in the primary market;they can be sold by public offer,tender,placement,or through a rights
issue. In addition to ordinary shares there are various types of preference share.
Most individual investors buy shares indirectly through institutional investors such as insurance
companies, pension funds, and unit trusts. As a result much of the trading on stock exchanges
involves institutional investors. Some types of institutional investment, namely investment trusts
and exchange-traded funds,are bought and sold on a stock exchange rather than being transacted
with institutional investors (see Chapter 9 on mutual funds).
Stock markets operate most efﬁciently if they exhibit depth and breadth.A market that is deep
has a large number of traders such that small price movements bring forward many new buy or
sell orders.This helps to avoid excessive share price swings since price falls are met by new purchase
orders,and price rises are met by new sales.As a result price falls and rises are moderated.A broad
market contains traders with differing opinions such that some will be forecasting price rises whilst
others expect falls.Such heterogeneity of views also helps to prevent large price swings.However,
as will be seen in Chapter 27 on stock market bubbles and crashes,the heterogeneity of views can
be replaced by homogeneity.When stock markets are characterised by uniformity of opinion,
extreme share price movements can result.If the overwhelming majority of investors expect a rise,
there would be many buyers and few sellers. Sharp price rises (a bubble) would result. If the
majority expects a price fall, sales would dominate purchases and share prices could fall
dramatically (and hence a stock market crash could occur).

Chapter 7
Stock indices
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. How stock indices differ in respect to the method of calculation.
2. Unweighted, price-weighted, and value-weighted approaches to the calculation of stock indices.
3. The use of arithmetic and geometric means in the calculation of stock indices.
4. The adjustment for changes in the constituent stocks of an index.
5. How to evaluate alternative stock indices.
TYPES OF INDEX
Stock indices are measures of the price performance of stock portfolios, which may be seen as
representative of a stock market as a whole or of a segment of the market.The better known
indices include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the NASDAQ
in the United States; the FTSE 100 in the United Kingdom; the Nikkei 225 in Japan; the DAX in
Germany; the CAC 40 in France; and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong. All countries with stock
markets have at least one index,and some countries (in particular the United States) have numerous
indices.
Indices are not only calculated for national stock markets, there are also regional and global
market indices.For example FTSE,MSCI,S&P,and Dow Jones all produce stock indices for both
the world as a whole, and Europe as a whole.There are often sub-indices, for example European
indices exclusive of the UK.
Indices are also calculated for bonds.There are indices of bond yields as well as indices of bond
prices. Each bond index relates to a particular type of issuer (e.g. government, AAA-rated
corporate, etc.) and to a speciﬁc maturity band.
This chapter is primarily concerned with the mechanics of the calculation of indices.This is of
importance since it determines the comparability of the movements of different indices, and the
interpretation that can be put upon a change in a particular index. Indices can be categorised in a
131

number of ways:(1) the number of stocks included;(2) the method of weighting the stock prices;
and (3) the nature of the averaging.
The number of stocks can vary from a small number of large company stocks (for example the
Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on just 30 stocks) to inclusion of every stock traded on a
particular market (for example the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index).The indices
based on a small number of stocks have the advantage of easy calculation, but the disadvantage of
being imperfectly representative of the market as a whole.
Index Weighting
The contribution of individual stock prices to an index may be unweighted (as in the case of the
Financial Times Ordinary Share Index), value weighted (for example the Financial Times Stock
Exchange (FTSE) 100), or price weighted (such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average).
In the case of unweighted indices an average of daily rates of share price change is calculated
each day; this is an average of stocks on one day.The product of such changes (that is multiplying
them together,for example an average 10% rise one day followed by an average 20% rise the next
gives a rise of 32% over the two days:1.1  1.2  1.32) since a base date provides the index.The
calculation involves two stages: one is averaging stock price changes on a single day; the other
involves compounding the daily averages over time.The calculation gives all stocks equal inﬂuence
irrespective of the sizes of the companies.
To illustrate the calculation of an unweighted index,suppose that it is to be based on just three
stocks whose prices and numbers of shares issued are as shown in Table 7.1.The changes relate to
just one day (so no compounding over time is involved).It is further supposed (a) that stock A rises
in price by 15% during the day while the other two prices remain unchanged, and (b) that stock
C undergoes a 15% price rise while the other two prices remain constant during the day. Before
the price rise, the index equals 100.
In the event of a 15% rise in the price of A, the new index will be (using arithmetic means):
 100 
 100  1.05  100  105
If the price of C rises by 15%, the new index will be:

C

5 million

It can be seen that a 15% rise in either stock price has the same effect on the index despite the
fact that C has a higher stock price and is issued by a larger company.
Price-weighted indices weight percentage price increases by the initial stock prices.The index
at time T can be calculated as follows:
 Base value (Initial index)
The calculations,using the data in Table 7.1 and 15% price rises for stocks A and C respectively
but based on a price-weighted approach, produce the following indices:
(a)
 100 
 100  1.0215  100  102.15
(b)
 100 
 100  1.086  100  108.6
It can be seen that the impact on the index is four times as great when the price rise is in stock
C rather than stock A.This reﬂects the fact that stock price C is initially four times stock price A.
So stocks with high prices have the greatest inﬂuence on the index.
Using the same example but calculating a value-weighted index (weighting percentage increases
by the market capitalisations of the companies: market capitalisation being stock price times
number of shares issued) may be based on the formula:
Index at time  T 
Base value (Initial index)
Using the ﬁgures from the previous example, a 15% increase in the price of stock A raises the
index from 100 to:
 100 
 100  1.03  100  103
whereas a 15% increase in the price of stock C raises the index to:
 100 
 100  1.06  100  106
The impact of the rise in stock price C is double that of the rise in stock price A.This reﬂects
the fact that the initial market capitalisation of C (200p  5 million) is twice that of A (50p 
10 million).When indices are value weighted, large companies have the greatest inﬂuence. Some
indices,rather than using the full market capitalisation,use the value of shares available to investors
in the free ﬂoat.This alternative excludes shares held by the issuer and not available for purchase
by investors (such shares are said to be ‘closely held’).

ADJUSTING FOR CHANGES IN THE 
CONSTITUENT STOCKS OF AN INDEX
In most cases the constituent stocks in an index are changed as some ﬁrms grow and
others experience relative decline.For example every three months some companies are removed
from the FTSE 100 Index and replaced by others in order to ensure that the index remains
close to covering the largest 100 ﬁrms by market capitalisation. Such changes in the composition
of the index portfolio should not affect the value of the index, since they do not result from
overall market movements.This requires adjustments to the formula used for calculating the
index.
Suppose that a value-weighted index stands at 1120 and is based on the three stocks in
Table 7.2.
STOCK INDICES
137
Table 7.2

Shoddigoods plc
£100 million
Nore Turn Airlines plc

Cowboy Construction plc

When the periodic review date is reached, it is found that the constituents of the index
portfolio are no longer the three largest companies.The index is still at 1120 and the market
capitalisations are still as shown in Table 7.2. However the market capitalisation of a fourth
company, Gonoff Foods plc, has grown to £45 million.As a result Gonoff Foods replace Cowboy
Construction in the calculation of the index (so that the index continues to be based on the three
largest ﬁrms).
The index had been calculated as:
 1000
i.e.
 1000  1120
Consequent upon the change in the constituent stocks,an adjustment needs to be made to the
formula to ensure that the change in the composition of the index portfolio does not change
the index.A change in the stocks used to calculate the index should not, in itself, cause a change
in the index.The adjustment factor is shown as AF in the following equation.
 1000 AF  1120
AF will take the value of (100  50  40) / (100  50  45)  190/195  0.974.

The share prices and numbers of shares are:
(a) If stock C were to be replaced by stock D,which is priced at 20p with 5,000,000 shares issued,
calculate the adjustment factor required to ensure that the replacement does not affect the
index.
(b) Subsequent to the replacement, the price of stock D rises to 25p. What will the new
index be?

(a) The total market capitalisation before the replacement is:

The adjustment factor required is:
£3,800,000/£4,000,000  0.95
Use of this adjustment factor produces an index of:
 1000  0.95  1000
(b) If the price of stock D rises to 25p, the new market capitalisation will be:
(£1  1,000,000)  (£2  1,000,000)  (£0.25  5,000,000)  £1,000,000 

EVALUATING ALTERNATIVE STOCK INDICES
When evaluating a stock index, it is necessary to consider it in relation to the functions that it is
expected to perform. If an index fulﬁls its intended purposes then it will be evaluated positively.
Indices have a number of uses.First,they are used to measure and monitor market movements.
Second,they should provide a means of ascertaining changes in aggregate wealth over time.Third,
they have a role as barometers of the wider economy;in particular stock market movements tend
to be leading indicators which means that they provide indications of likely future changes in the
level of activity in the economy as a whole. Fourth, they provide a means of evaluating the
performance of fund managers by providing benchmarks against which portfolio managers can be
compared.Fifth,they provide the basis for derivative instruments such as futures and options.Sixth,
they provide the framework for the creation of tracker funds whose aim is to reﬂect closely the
performance of a stock market.Seventh,they are required by capital market models,in particular
the capital asset pricing model, for a number of purposes: ascertaining discount rates for capital
projects,estimating required rates of return on shares,and deriving fair rates of return for utilities.
Unweighted, price-weighted, and geometrically averaged indices are much less satisfactory
than indices that are value weighted and arithmetically averaged.For the purpose of measuring stock
market values,it is necessary to have an index that accurately reﬂects the total market capitalisation
of the market. An arithmetically averaged value-weighted index does accurately measure the
aggregate value of the stocks covered by the index,whereas other indices do not.A reliable measure
of the total value of the market is also required for ascertaining changes in aggregate wealth over
time and as a basis for derivative instruments.Arithmetically averaged value-weighted stock indices
are the only indices that are macroconsistent, which means that it is possible for all investors to
hold the index portfolio simultaneously (Enderle et al. 2003).An index portfolio is a portfolio of
shares that matches a stock index in terms of the constituent shares and their relative proportions.
An index will also perform its functions more effectively if it covers a large number of stocks.
Indices that provide a very broad coverage, and hence reliably reﬂect the whole market, include
the Wilshire 5000 in the United States (which covers about 7,000 stocks) and the FTSE All-Share
Index in the UK (which covers about 750 stocks). Such stock indices are referred to as broad-
capitalisation indices.Enderle et al. (2003) suggested a number of factors that characterise a good
broad-capitalisation index.One desirable characteristic is completeness,which is a measure of the
comprehensiveness of the coverage of relevant stocks.Another desirable feature is investability;it
should be possible for fund managers to buy all the shares in the index.Investability is particularly
important for the managers of index tracker funds,but may require some sacriﬁce of completeness

EXHIBIT 7.1
AN EXAMPLE OF AN INVESTMENT FUND THAT
AIMS TO TRACK THE FTSE 100 INDEX
HSBC FTSE 100 INDEX FUND (31 AUGUST 2007)
Proﬁle
The fund aims to match the performance of the FTSE 100 Index. Investments are made in each
stock held within the index, a technique known as full replication.
in order to eliminate illiquid stocks. Indices should also have investor acceptance. It is ironic that
the world’s most closely followed index,the Dow Jones Industrial Average,covers only 30 stocks
and is price weighted. So the index which possibly exhibits the highest investor acceptance is
characterised by very low completeness.
Although the FTSE All-Share Index is probably the most informative general stock index in the
UK, since it is value weighted and based on a broad coverage of shares, it is not the most widely
quoted.The most frequently quoted index in the UK is the FTSE 100.Whilst beneﬁting from
being value weighted, the FTSE 100 is based on only 100 stocks. Roughly speaking, these are the
shares of the largest 100 UK companies (although the stocks covered will tend to differ slightly
from the top 100 due to technicalities of index construction). Since the performance of smaller-
company shares can differ substantially from that of larger-company shares,the focus of the FTSE
100 on larger companies means that it does not fully reﬂect the behaviour of the stock market as
a whole.The FTSE 100 is also dominated by a small number of sectors: oil, telecommunications,
pharmaceuticals,and ﬁnancial sector companies.This bias towards a few sectors reduces the ability
of the FTSE 100 to reﬂect the whole market.
Other UK indices, which are also value weighted, are the:
FTSE 250 – the 250 companies below the FTSE 100 ranked by market capitalisation
FTSE 350 – the constituents of the FTSE 100 plus those of the FTSE 250
FTSE SmallCap – the FTSE All-Share stocks, excluding those in the FTSE 350.
At the time of writing the FTSE 100 companies represented about 80% of the total market
capitalisation of the UK stock market, the FTSE 250 about 16%, and the FTSE SmallCap about
2%.The FTSE 100, FTSE 250, and FTSE SmallCap added together comprise the FTSE All-Share
Index.The FTSE All-Share Index covers about 98% of the market capitalisation of UK stocks.The
other 2% accounts for more than 1,000 very small companies whose shares are not eligible for
inclusion in the FTSE All-Share Index. These percentages indicate the dominance of large
companies.That dominance is further emphasised by the fact that the top ten companies accounted
for nearly half of the FTSE 100 by market capitalisation, and hence nearly 40% of the total UK
stock market.

Unfortunately most stock indices consider only stock price changes and fail to incorporate
dividends.An index that incorporates dividends would be most appropriate if the aim is to have a
benchmark against which to evaluate fund managers, a structure that tracker funds can try to
replicate, and a measure of market return that can be used in models such as the capital asset
pricing model. Clarke and Statman (2000) pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
which was initiated on 26 May 1896 at a value of 40.94, had reached 9,181.43 by 31 December
1998.They estimated that, with dividends included, it would have grown to 652,230.87.The
inclusion of dividends increases the ﬁnal outcome by more than 71 times.Taking account of inﬂation
the ﬁgures would become 442.87 and 31,460.30. It is rare for a stock index to include an
adjustment to take account of inﬂation.
In recent years there has been a change in the way that value-weighted indices are constructed.
The move has been towards a free-ﬂoat basis and away from a total-capitalisation basis. Free ﬂoat
includes only those shares that are seen as available for purchase, rather than all shares.The free-
ﬂoat basis excludes shares held by governments, founding families, and non-ﬁnancial companies.
The stock-index weighting is thus based on the total value of a company’s shares available for
purchase,and not on the full market capitalisation of the company.One reason for this change has
been the growth of funds that seek to track stock indices. Such a fund may aim to buy shares in
proportion to their weights in an index. If the weights are based on total capitalisation but only a

small proportion of the shares are available in the market, the purchases by index-tracking funds
could distort the market by causing unjustiﬁed increases in the prices of such stocks.
Not only are there stock indices for individual countries, but also there are indices for the
world as a whole and for regions of the world (e.g. Europe).There are alternative views as to the
most appropriate weighting for multi-country stock indices. One approach is to weight each
country by its contribution to global market capitalisation. However the ratio of stock market
capitalisation to national income (GDP) varies considerably between countries. If the wish is that
the weighting of an index should reﬂect the total asset base of a country, using national income
(GDP) rather than market capitalisation might provide a better means of weighting.This approach
would provide a more stable weighting since relative GDP is less volatile than relative market
capitalisation.
Emerging market indices raise particular issues. Markets are classiﬁed as emerging markets
either as a result of the country having a low national income per head, or because of a low stock
market capitalisation relative to national income. Emerging market countries often have heavy
restrictions on foreign ownership of shares.The market capitalisation available for foreign investors
can be much less than that available for domestic investors.The restrictions on foreign ownership
can arise from either national governments or from the companies themselves.Two types of
emerging-market stock index are available.There are indices based on total market capitalisation
and indices based on the shares available for foreign investors.The performances of the two different
types of index can be dramatically different. Indices are available both for individual emerging
markets, and for groups of emerging markets.
Institutional investors, such as unit trusts, use stock indices as benchmarks for performance
measurement.Index tracker funds aim to replicate the performance of an index.European Union
legislation prevents unit trusts (and OEICs) holding more than 10% of their portfolio in a single
stock.Vodafone’s takeover of Mannesmann in 2000 raised its market capitalisation to more than
10% of the FTSE 100.To enable institutional investors to benchmark against a relevant index,
FTSE International (a major indexing organisation) has introduced capped versions of its FTSE 100
and All-Share indices.These capped indices limit the maximum weighting of a stock in the index
to 10%.
One criticism of the use, by institutional investors, of value-weighted stock indices as
performance benchmarks is that it encourages closet tracking.The portfolio managers keep their
portfolios close to the composition of the stock index in order to avoid the risk of underperforming
the index by a substantial amount. In consequence they tend to resemble index tracker funds
(without the low cost advantages of index tracker funds). One consequence is that smaller
companies tend to be omitted from portfolios because they play little, if any, part in a value-
weighted stock index. Also a value-weighted stock index may be dominated by a few large
companies or sectors; with the effect that it does not constitute a well-diversiﬁed portfolio. A
portfolio manager who keeps close to the index would not be holding a well-diversiﬁed portfolio;
the portfolio would be too dependent on a small number of companies or sectors.
It may be argued that, in order to avoid those consequences, an unweighted index should be
used as the performance benchmark.An unweighted index might encourage more consideration
of the shares of smaller companies, since the index would give them as much signiﬁcance as the
shares of large companies. An unweighted index would also remove the tendency to become
dependent on a small number of large companies or sectors.The effect might be that a portfolio
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
142

manager who operates as a closet tracker would have a well-diversiﬁed portfolio, which includes
a signiﬁcant holding of the shares of smaller companies.
Although most stock indices are based on arithmetic averages,there are some that use geometric
averaging.A UK example is the FT Ordinary Share Index (the FT30), which is a geometrically
averaged equal-weighted index based on 30 stocks.In the past this was the most quoted UK index,
but has been overshadowed by the FTSE 100 and the FTSE All-Share Index since the 1980s.
Geometric averaging has particular problems.
The geometric mean overestimates the effects of rises in the prices of smaller company stocks
and underestimates the effects of changes in the stock prices of larger companies. Since large
corporations are large because of rapid growth in the past, it follows that the use of geometric
means gives too little weight to the stock prices of rapidly growing companies and too much weight
to the stock prices of slow growth companies.So the use of geometric means underweights stocks
whose prices rise rapidly and overweights stocks whose prices increase slowly.In consequence,over
time,indices based on geometric means tend to understate the true rate of increase in stock prices.
The same argument and conclusion applies to indices based on unweighted arithmetic means.
There is a more general way in which geometric averaging understates rises in a stock market.
This arises because geometric averages are lower than arithmetic averages. Consider an index
based on three shares which experience price increases of 25%, 50%, and 75%.The arithmetic
average increase is 50%.The geometric average is:
(1.25  1.5  1.75)1/3 1  0.486 i.e. 48.6%
The mathematical properties of geometric averages cause understatement of average price
increases.The cumulative effect of such understatement over time can substantially distort the
calculated market rise.
CONCLUSION
Stock indices can be unweighted,price weighted,or value weighted.Either arithmetic or geometric
means may be used when calculating indices. In the last few decades, new indices have normally
been value-weighted indices using arithmetic means.This type of index is generally seen to provide
the most accurate representation of movements in the overall stock market.
One popular use of stock indices is the provision of a basis for index tracker funds.These are
institutional investments that aim to track the performance of an index rather than outperform
the index (see Chapters 9 and 16 on mutual funds and styles of portfolio construction,respectively).
Index tracker funds have the advantage of relatively low management costs, and in consequence
fund charges can be low. In addition index tracker funds avoid the risk of underperformance by a
fund manager (evidence shows that, on average, fund managers underperform stock indices; as
detailed in the chapters in Part 7 on market efﬁciency and Chapter 17 on fund managers’
performance evaluation).
STOCK INDICES

Another major use of stock indices is the provision of a value that underlies ﬁnancial derivatives
such as futures, options, and swaps.These derivatives are used for risk management, either to
reduce existing risk or to take on risk in the hope of making proﬁts (see the chapters in Part 8 on
stock index futures and Part 9 on stock options). Financial derivatives based on stock indices are
widely used in fund management for the purpose of managing risk or increasing returns. Some
institutional investments, such as stock market related funds that guarantee that the investment
cannot fall below a particular value,use derivatives especially options (see Chapter 34 on structured
products).Stock index futures are often used in the structuring of futures funds,which frequently
are forms of index tracker fund (see Part 8 on stock index futures).

Chapter 8
The rationale and 
conduct of regulation
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The reasons for regulation of investment business and markets.
2. The drawbacks of regulation.
3. Informal self-regulation
4. The system of regulation in the United Kingdom.
5. Quality assurance in investment services.
6. How systems of regulation differ between countries.
7. The role of the European Union in the regulation of investments business.
8. The lessons of the Enron and Worldcom experiences.
Investments can be mis-sold.There can be malpractice and misrepresentation.These could arise
from inadequate training of advisers or from conﬂicts of interest.For example if advisers are paid
by commission, they may be inclined to sell the products that pay the highest commission rather
than the products most suitable for the needs of their clients.A major source of possible malpractice
is asymmetric information;the supplier of an investment product knows much more about it than
the consumer does. Full and accurate information could be withheld from the consumer.
The economic rationale for regulation can be described under three headings.The ﬁrst is the
need to correct market imperfections.The second relates to the existence of economies of scale
in monitoring the suppliers of ﬁnancial products. The third involves the establishment and
maintenance of consumer conﬁdence in the market by ensuring that the suppliers do not fall below
a speciﬁed standard.
CORRECTION OF MARKET IMPERFECTIONS
There are numerous potential imperfections in the market for retail ﬁnancial products.A perfect
market requires all participants to have full information.Consumers of ﬁnancial services typically
lack full information. It is difﬁcult to ascertain the quality of ﬁnancial products at the point of
145

purchase.The technicalities of many products render them difﬁcult to assess by consumers.Many
ﬁnancial products are long term in nature,the realisation that a poor product has been bought does
not occur until it is too late.There is a temptation for consumers to take a ‘free-rider’ approach
whereby each consumer assumes that other consumers have investigated the soundness of products
and their providers.There may be a temptation for commission-seeking sales personnel to distort
the information provided to consumers. Many ﬁnancial products are not purchased frequently
(for example pensions and endowment policies) with the result that consumers do not develop
knowledge of products and providers.
One purpose of regulation is thus the imposition of requirements upon providers in relation
to the provision of information to consumers.This regulation should encompass not only the
provision of adequate and accurate information to consumers,but also the ability of sales personnel
to communicate such information. Financial advisers should not only provide high quality
information, but should be able to understand the information that they give. It is possible for
poor advice to be given as a result of the adviser failing to fully understand the product being
offered.
ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND DELEGATED MONITORING
In the absence of regulation and supervision by an agency, consumers would need to investigate
and monitor the providers of ﬁnancial services.This would require time,effort,and money on the
part of the consumers.This would entail considerable duplication, as all consumers would be
carrying out the same process.There would also be the loss of the economies of scale derived
through a specialist regulator acquiring expertise by means of carrying out investigation and
monitoring on a frequent basis.
In the absence of such a regulatory agency many consumers would ﬁnd the investigation and
monitoring of ﬁrms beyond their level of expertise or resources. Consumers might be tempted
to take a free-rider approach wherein each assumes that other consumers are carrying out
the investigations and monitoring (with the possible result that no one performs these
functions).Each individual consumer is unable to derive the full beneﬁts of their own supervision,
since the beneﬁts would accrue to all consumers (many of whom may not contribute to the
process of supervision). Meanwhile the costs of investigation and monitoring are likely to be
disproportionately high for any individual consumer who chooses to carry out a supervisory
function.
Since there are high costs involved in investigating and monitoring the providers of ﬁnancial
services, it is rational for consumers to delegate some of the supervisory role to a regulatory
agency.The rationality of this is reinforced by the economies of scale in regulation, and by the
desirability of spreading the costs of regulation amongst all those who beneﬁt from it.This rationale
is a variation on delegated monitoring theory.
CONFIDENCE IN MINIMUM STANDARDS
The theory relevant to this point is known as Akerlof’s Lemons paradigm.If consumers know that
there are good and bad products on the market,but do not have enough information to distinguish
between them,they may decide not to buy in order to avoid the possibility of ﬁnding that they have
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
146

bought a bad one. In this way the existence of substandard products can reduce the total level of
demand in the market.When consumers know that there are low quality products in the market,
good products may become tarnished by the generalised reputation of poor products. (The sub-
prime mortgage crisis of the summer of 2007 provided an example of Akerlof’s Lemons. Some
banks and hedge funds had heavy exposure to the weak sub-prime mortgage assets, but nobody
knew which had the heavy exposures.Banks became reluctant to lend to any organisation because
they did not know whether the borrower was one of those with heavy exposure to the weak assets.)
One role of regulation is to set minimum standards and thereby remove substandard products
from the market. Suppliers would also have an interest in regulation, which enhances consumer
conﬁdence by eliminating the possibility of low quality products. It is doubtful whether such
conﬁdence can be created without formal regulation. There would always be the risk that
unscrupulous ﬁrms would attempt to exploit the conﬁdence created by reputable ﬁrms.The chance
that some providers of ﬁnancial services will fail to abide by an informal (explicit or tacit)
agreement about minimum standards would disincline the honest providers from abiding by the
agreement. Indeed ﬁrms that abide by such an agreement, when other ﬁrms do not, may put
themselves at a competitive disadvantage – particularly if the maintenance of a good standard
entails additional costs, and hence higher prices.
In the UK, the House of Commons Treasury Committee (2004) highlighted sources of low
consumer conﬁdence:
The bear market has exposed a catalogue of problems and scandals that has left a large
body of savers feeling disillusioned with the long-term savings industry.These problems
include:
■about half of all with-proﬁts policyholders, with savings worth around £160 billion, now
ﬁnd themselves in closed funds offering very limited long-term growth prospects;
■endowment mortgage policyholders are suffering a collective shortfall of approaching £40
billion;
■a £3 billion shortfall emerged at Equitable Life;
■savers with precipice bonds have suffered capital losses estimated at £2.2 billion;
■the FSA is pressing for £350 million to compensate investors for losses on split capital
investment trusts.
HAZARDS OF REGULATION
Regulation has a number of potential hazards. Regulators may be subject to institutional capture,
which means that those being regulated gain control of the regulatory process.Regulation involves
costs, which are likely (at least in part) to be borne by the consumers that the regulation aims to
protect.Regulation can reduce competition between ﬁrms supplying ﬁnancial services.Regulators
may pursue their own agenda with objectives other than the protection of consumers.Moral hazard
can emerge,which means that consumers cease to take care in the mistaken belief that the regulator
eliminates all risks.
Related to the point about institutional capture is the issue of whether self-regulation or
statutory regulation is the most appropriate structure. More accurately the issue concerns the
THE RATIONALE AND CONDUCT OF REGULATION
147

appropriate point on the spectrum between these two extremes. Self-regulation is regulation of
the ﬁnancial services industry by the ﬁnancial services industry. Self-regulation, with no
governmental dimension, is unlikely to command full public conﬁdence. Statutory regulation
(regulation by central government) can be bureaucratic and inﬂexible.
Self-regulation can, in large part, be identiﬁed with practitioner input into the regulatory
process. Practitioner input has advantages but also poses potential dangers. On the plus side,
practitioner input utilises the expertise of the ﬁrms being regulated.This helps to avoid the situation
in which the regulated ﬁrms are able to hide or obscure deﬁciencies by exploiting the relative
ignorance of non-practitioner regulators. Second, practitioners are likely to have a professional
interest in ensuring that standards and public conﬁdence are maintained.Third, those being
regulated may be more prepared to cooperate if the regulators have experience within the industry.
Fourth,practitioners would have an interest in ensuring that the potentially less scrupulous ﬁrms
do not gain a free-rider advantage (exploiting an enhanced public image of the industry) arising
from the responsible behaviour of the more scrupulous suppliers.
On the downside,self-regulation could be more susceptible to regulatory capture.This involves
the ﬁnancial services industry gaining control over the regulatory agency and using it for the
industry’s purposes. Related to this is the potential for using regulatory requirements as a means
of hindering the entry of new ﬁrms to the industry.The imposition of such barriers to entry would
reduce competition and thereby operate against the interests of consumers.Another drawback is
that a regulatory agency without statutory powers may be unable to fully enforce its decisions.This
would result in reduced credibility and low public conﬁdence.
Costs of Regulation
A regulatory authority supplies regulatory services to both consumers and providers of ﬁnancial
services.The costs of this regulation are likely to be borne partly by consumers,and partly by the
ﬁrms supplying ﬁnancial services.The consumer pays through higher prices and the industry pays
to the extent that it does not fully pass on its own costs to consumers. One problem is that there
is not a market for regulation. So the beneﬁciaries of regulation are unable to express their
preferences in terms of the amount of regulation and the price they are prepared to pay for it.
Regulation and its costs are excessive if the regulator supplies more regulation than the beneﬁciaries
would choose to pay for under a market mechanism. Since it is impossible for the recipients of
regulation to express their preferences as to quantity and price through a market mechanism it is
impossible to know whether the extent of regulation exceeds, or falls short of, the level that the
beneﬁciaries would demand.
Moral Hazard
Moral hazard leads to people taking too much risk since they believe that they are protected
against loss.Consumers may cease to take care in the mistaken belief that the regulator eliminates
all risks.
Investors may be unclear about the scope and level of protection that can be expected from a
regulatory body.Consumers cannot expect to be protected against all possibility of losing money.
It is possible that consumers perceive an implicit contract between themselves and a regulator.An
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
148

implicit contract can create the impression that the consumer need not take care when buying
ﬁnancial services.
Moral hazard can create a situation in which regulation renders adverse events more likely
to occur.For example if regulation guarantees that investments are safe,investors would be tempted
to put their money into high risk (and hence high prospective yield) investments knowing that
they are protected from the risk of capital loss. In this way protection against loss makes the loss
more likely.
Moral hazard may affect not only the consumers of ﬁnancial products but also the providers and
advisers.This was pointed out by the House of Commons Treasury Committee (2004):
Across the industry there is a danger that companies and trade bodies are abrogating their
responsibilities in relying so heavily on the FSA to police and deliver good standards of
behaviour.External regulation by a body such as the FSA should not be seen as a substitute
for effective self-regulation within the industry via codes which react quickly and ﬂexibly
to problems as they arise.All the major trade bodies in the long-term savings industry
should have clear codes of practice which take the standards of behaviour laid down by
the FSA as a minimum but aim to improve on the FSA’s requirements in those areas where
the industry feels that better standards will do most to help its customer base.
The sub-prime mortgage crisis of summer 2007 provided possible examples of moral hazard.
Mortgage lenders were packaging portfolios of mortgages and selling those packages to banks and
other ﬁnancial institutions. It was suggested that the facility of selling the mortgages caused the
mortgage lenders to make excessively risky loans, since the mortgage lenders would not have to
bear the consequences of default by borrowers.Another source of moral hazard identiﬁed during
the crisis arose from the readiness of monetary authorities (particularly the US Federal Reserve
and the European Central Bank) to support the ﬁnancial system during the crisis. It was argued
that the support protected the institutions,which had made risky loans,from the full consequences
of their actions. Correspondingly it could be seen as encouraging risky lending in the future.
Regulation cannot be expected to be perfect;there is always a risk that unscrupulous operators
will slip through the regulatory net. Furthermore there are risks that regulation does not seek to
reduce.For example regulators do not seek to protect investors from the risk that the investments
underlying the ﬁnancial products may fall in value.The possibility that stock markets could fall and
thereby reduce the value of a pension fund or endowment policy is not a risk that a regulator could
try to reduce. Regulators cannot protect consumers against all possibility of loss. A regulatory
system cannot be expected to relieve the consumer of responsibility for exercising judgement and
care.
INFORMAL SELF-REGULATION
It should not be forgotten that there is always informal, as well as formal, regulation. Abolaﬁa
(1996) has argued that to understand the operation of ﬁnancial markets it is important to
understand their social structures especially the social rules which inﬂuence and constrain
behaviour within them.Markets cannot operate without some restraint on individual opportunism,
particularly since there needs to be a degree of trust between market participants.The effective
THE RATIONALE AND CONDUCT OF REGULATION
149

operation of markets requires broadly shared ideas of what constitutes appropriate behaviour,such
as shared conventions and social norms.
Abolaﬁa (1996) observes that individual traders conduct themselves within a set of rules (formal
and informal) and social arrangements.Trading transactions are carried out within a context of
norms of exchange and the wish to maintain personal reputations.Traders who contravene rules
or norms may be sanctioned by other traders and could be excluded from trading opportunities.
Baker (1984) studied trading on an options exchange and found that the effectiveness of informal
policing of social norms of trading behaviour depended on the size of the market.In larger markets
the contravention of norms of behaviour was less easily constrained by informal sanctions.He saw
this as an explanation for the observation that the larger markets were more volatile despite their
greater depth and breadth. However, particularly in the case of derivatives, it may be that high
volatility is the cause of the large size of a market rather than the large size of the market being the
cause of the high volatility.
Fenton-O’Creevy et al.(2005) point out that the informal social pressures have their limits.They
found, in the City of London, that the tacit norms about the extent to which it is acceptable to
exploit the information asymmetry between traders and private individuals varied signiﬁcantly
between ﬁrms.
REGULATION OF INVESTMENT BUSINESS IN THE UK
The Financial Services Authority
Regulation of investment business in the UK is conducted by the Financial Services Authority
(FSA),and is a form of statutory regulation.The FSA recognises that it is impossible to remove all
risk and failure from the ﬁnancial system. It therefore seeks to prioritise in seeking to achieve its
four statutory objectives set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act (2000).Those objectives
are to (1) maintain market conﬁdence,(2) promote public understanding of the ﬁnancial system,
(3) secure appropriate consumer protection, and (4) reduce ﬁnancial crime.
Securing appropriate consumer protection includes ensuring that consumers receive accurate
advice and information. Communications with consumers should be clear, fair, and accurate. It is
accepted that consumers should take some responsibility for their decisions, but the information
upon which the decisions are based should be of a good standard.
The ﬁnancial crime that the FSA seeks to reduce includes money laundering, fraud and
dishonesty,and criminal market conduct.Criminal market conduct comprises insider dealing and
market manipulation. Insider dealing is the use of privileged information for personal gain. For
example the ﬁnance director of a ﬁrm may have information about company proﬁts before anyone
else, and may trade shares on the basis of that privileged information. Market manipulation may
entail issuing false or misleading information with the intention of inﬂuencing share prices for
personal gain.
The FSA has identiﬁed a set of generic risks to its objectives.For example risks to the consumer
protection objective could be classiﬁed under: failure of companies; crime and market abuse;
misconduct or mismanagement; market malfunction; and inadequate understanding of products
or services.Prudential risk is the risk that a ﬁrm collapses because of poor management.Bad faith
risk is the risk of dishonest behaviour such as fraud,misrepresentation,and mis-selling.Complexity
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
150

(or unsuitability) risk is the risk that customers fail to understand products.The FSA aims to reduce
prudential,bad faith,and complexity risk.However the FSA does not deal with performance risk,
which is the risk that investments fail to provide expected returns.
After identifying risks to objectives,it is necessary to prioritise.The FSA assesses the likelihood
of a risk being realised,and evaluates the impact of such a realisation.The risks focused upon would
be those with high likelihood of resulting in problems, and with substantial signiﬁcance for the
attainment of one of the four objectives.
Rather than carrying out routine compliance visits to all ﬁnancial services companies,the FSA
focuses on companies that pose the greatest risk. Each company is allocated to one of four
categories,ranging from high risk to low risk.High risk companies receive close attention whereas
low risk ﬁrms are monitored less closely.In addition the FSA pursues themes that are common to
large numbers of ﬁrms, for example the provision of comparative information about ﬁnancial
products to consumers so that consumers can make informed choices.
The FSA is empowered to undertake general investigations into the business of persons or ﬁrms.
It may also conduct speciﬁc investigations if there is suspicion of a particular unacceptable activity.
The FSA has the power to require questions to be answered, information to be provided, and
documents to be submitted.The FSA is able to apply for a search warrant to enter a property
and seize documents.The FSA can remove permission to pursue particular activities from ﬁrms
and individuals.It can also take disciplinary action in the form of issuing private warnings,publishing
statements of misconduct, and imposing ﬁnancial penalties.
Financial Advisers and their Clients
UK ﬁnancial advice ﬁrms,and individual advisers,are characterised by depolarisation.This means
that they fall into three categories.Independent ﬁnancial advisers offer ﬁnancial products from the
whole market.Multi-tied advisers offer products from a limited range of providers.Tied advisers
offer the products of just one ﬁnancial services provider. Advisers are required to inform their
clients as to which of the three categories they belong.
A ﬁnancial adviser must not give investment advice unless the client’s personal and ﬁnancial
circumstances have been fully ascertained. These circumstances include information about
employment, assets, liabilities, expenditure, attitudes, and objectives. Of particular importance
is the client’s attitude to risk.The adviser must ascertain the client’s attitude to risk and also try to
ensure that the client understands the risks that accompany relevant ﬁnancial products.
Financial advisers paid by commission have a conﬂict of interest.The products that are best for
the client are not necessarily those that pay the highest commission.It might be argued that advisers
should have sufﬁcient integrity to consider only the interests of their clients, but even the highest
integrity does not eliminate bias. Research into the behaviour of auditors has indicated that the
psychological processes involved in conﬂicts of interest can occur without any conscious intention
to indulge in corruption (Moore et al.2006).Conﬁrmation bias,which entails a focus on supporting
information and rejection of opposing information,is not a conscious process.Montier (2007) has
referred to the notion that people are able to exclude self-interest in decision-making as the ‘illusion
of objectivity’.Biases from motivated reasoning are widespread;evidence exists for their presence
amongst medics and judges.The human mind is not a disinterested computer; its operation is
affected by moods, emotions, motives, attitudes, and self-interest.
THE RATIONALE AND CONDUCT OF REGULATION
151

The Financial Ombudsman
The Financial Ombudsman Service helps to settle disputes between consumers and ﬁnancial ﬁrms.
The existence of the ombudsman service is intended to increase public conﬁdence in ﬁnancial
services and thereby to encourage people to invest.It is also intended to help to redress the effects
of asymmetric information wherein consumers have much less knowledge about investments than
the ﬁrms that provide them.
The ombudsman can consider complaints about a wide range of ﬁnancial services and
there is no cost to consumers.The decisions of the ombudsman are binding on ﬁrms but not
on consumers. Consumers are expected to ﬁrst complain to the ﬁrm with which they have a
grievance, and then turn to the ombudsman if they are not satisﬁed. If consumers are not
content with the rulings of the ombudsman they are able to pursue their complaints further through
the courts. The ombudsman can order that a ﬁrm pays compensation to a consumer but,
unlike the Financial Services Authority, cannot impose ﬁnes on ﬁrms.The ombudsman cannot
intervene if the ﬁrm against which the complaint is made is not authorised by the Financial Services
Authority.
The Pensions Regulator, the Pension Protection
Fund, and the Pensions Ombudsman
In the UK the regulation of occupational pension schemes is separate from the regulation of private
pensions and other ﬁnancial services.The Pensions Regulator oversees all work-based pension
schemes.Work-based schemes include not only occupational pensions but also stakeholder and
personal pension schemes where employees have arrangements for deduction from wages and
salaries.The Pensions Regulator takes a proactive approach in aiming to identify and prevent
potential problems, such as underfunding of pension schemes.
The Pension Protection Fund aims to protect members of deﬁned-beneﬁt (ﬁnal-salary)
occupational pension schemes where the employer becomes insolvent leaving insufﬁcient in the
pension fund.It also compensates members of occupational pension schemes (deﬁned contribution
as well as deﬁned beneﬁt) in cases of fraud or misappropriation.The Pension Protection Fund is
largely ﬁnanced by a levy on all private sector deﬁned-beneﬁt pension schemes,where the levy on
a scheme rises with the degree of underfunding of that scheme.
The Pensions Ombudsman deals with complaints relating to occupational pension schemes,and
some aspects of personal pension schemes.The Pensions Ombudsman decides about complaints
and disputes relating to the operation of pension schemes, but not those relating to sales and
marketing (which are dealt with by the Financial Ombudsman Service). A decision from the
Pensions Ombudsman is binding on all parties.
QUALITY ASSURANCE IN INVESTMENT SERVICES
Many people take the view that competition has failed consistently to ensure good quality for retail
consumers of ﬁnancial products and services. This has been evidenced by the mis-selling of
unsuitable pensions; the tendency for many consumers to cancel policies before they mature,
which suggests that the products were unsuitable; and many endowment policies have failed to
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
152

satisfy customers since they have not met the consumer expectation that they would be sufﬁcient
to redeem mortgage debts at maturity.
Quality could be seen as the satisfaction of the retail investor with the service provided.This is
dependent upon whether the expectations of the investor are met.One problem in the investment
service industry is that the outcomes of investment decisions are largely beyond the control of
investment advisers and investment managers.The behaviour of ﬁnancial markets is the main
determinant of whether expectations, in the sense of desired investment returns, are met.The
quality assurance role of the investment professionals may be limited to ensuring that the
investments of their clients perform at least as well as the average.
Karapetrovic and Willborn (1999) suggest that quality could be deﬁned in terms of the
perception of the retail investor about achieving satisfactory returns under acceptable risks within
a planned time. However investment professionals can only be responsible for returns relative to
benchmarks determined by market performance.The quality assurance role of investment advisers
may entail managing customer expectations.In particular investment advisers may need to ensure
that the expectations of clients are clear and realistic (Ojasalo 2001). Investment advisers may
need to explain the nature of market risk to their clients.The need for professional integrity is
considerable since some clients may withdraw when they understand the risks.Advisers need to
be willing to explain risks even though it could cause them to lose clients.
Quality assurance involves providing conﬁdence to clients that their requirements for quality
are met.In quality assurance the word ‘quality’is used in the sense of conformity,or compliance,
of product (or service) speciﬁcation to a standard.Product,or service,speciﬁcation can be deﬁned
in terms of the function of the product or service, in terms of its structure, or in terms of the
manner of production or provision (Groocock 1998).
For function to be used for the speciﬁcation, it is necessary for the product to have a speciﬁc
outcome. For example a bank deposit offering a ﬁxed rate of interest over a speciﬁed number
of years would promise a speciﬁc future sum of money.If the investor receives that sum of money,
the function of the investment would have been performed and the investor’s expectations
met.The possibility that the bank will fail to pay the investor is a remaining weakness in the
quality assurance. To complete the quality assurance the investor would need to deﬁne the
product speciﬁcation in terms of the manner of production, perhaps by choosing a large, well-
capitalised bank.
Speciﬁcation of function cannot be used for products for which it is not possible to specify the
future sum of money to be received by the investor. In such a case speciﬁcation of structure may
be appropriate. For example the speciﬁcation of structure might, for a unit trust, include details
of the investment strategy (e.g.diversiﬁed portfolio of UK shares);the investment managers (e.g.
Acme Portfolio Management plc); the charges (initial, annual, and terminal); and the dates and
nature of periodic reports. It would be easy for a regulator to check that these features had been
complied with.This may appear to be assurance of form rather than content but,when dealing with
ﬁnancial markets characterised by uncertainty,it is not possible to assure content in the sense of a
speciﬁc future monetary value.
Product, or service, speciﬁcation deﬁned in terms of the manner of production or provision
tends to entail a much larger set of prescriptions in the form of long rule books.Such a rule book
would cover aspects such as:the training and assessment of investment professionals;requirements
for independence and unbiased ‘best’advice;and requirements for ﬁnancial advisers to know their
THE RATIONALE AND CONDUCT OF REGULATION
153

clients and to conduct fact-ﬁnds for that purpose.Ascertaining the investment goals and ﬁnancial
circumstances of the client is crucial for an adviser.This is necessary to ensure that the goals are
appropriate and achievable.The adviser should determine the client’s net worth, income, and
expenditure. Projections of future income (both level and stability) and expenditure are also
necessary.
Accountability could be a component of quality assurance,and of regulation.If ﬁnancial advisers
have to document their reasons for their recommendations, inappropriate criteria such as
commission rates may be used less. Hilton (2001) suggested that giving explanations could force
decision-makers to make assumptions explicit and to examine other options more closely.Hilton
pointed out that experimental research had shown that if people know that they will have to justify
their decisions, they would use more information and be less subject to conﬁrmation bias.
Conﬁrmation bias is the behavioural ﬁnance bias that takes the form of ignoring information that
contradicts a person’s existing views. Reduction of conﬁrmation bias entails the consideration of
a wider range of alternatives.There are risks to such accountability requirements; advisers may
make recommendations on the basis of what is most easily defended, which may not necessarily
be the ideal advice for the client. Accountability could produce excessive conformity and
conservatism.
COMPARATIVE REGULATORY SYSTEMS
An important issue arises as to how the regulation of asset managers can improve investor
protection without limiting competition.Inadequate investor protection can cause investors to be
reluctant to invest.Good companies can be tainted by the reputation of bad companies.Conversely
excessive regulation may increase the costs of entry to the industry and hence reduce competition.
For example consumer protection may be improved by demanding high capital requirements,but
if new entrants to the market need to have large amounts of capital many potential ﬁnancial services
ﬁrms will be unable to enter the market; the result would be less competition and reduced
innovation. More generally excessive regulation can deter both companies and consumers by
imposing substantial costs on them.
The organisation of the ﬁnancial services industry can signiﬁcantly affect investors’ exposure
to loss. Large groups have greater ﬁnancial resources than small independent companies. Also
large groups may wish to compensate investors for any losses in order to maintain their own
reputations. Large groups thus have both the resources and the motive for protecting investors.
Large groups dominate European markets with the exceptions of the UK and France which have
many smaller independent ﬁrms (the United States also has many independent investment
companies). Arguably markets in which retail investment operations are predominantly within
large ﬁnancial conglomerates require less regulation by authorities.
Forms of regulation include (1) capital requirements, (2) conduct of business rules, (3)
requirements concerning the separation of clients’assets,(4) disclosure requirements,(5) auditing,
and (6) investor compensation schemes.The relative importance of each of these reﬂects the
organisational structure of the respective national markets. For example countries in which
investment services operations are part of large ﬁnancial conglomerates tend to have less need of
consumer compensation schemes than those in which there are many small independent investment
companies.
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
154

European regulation tends to rely on monitoring by public agencies, such as the Financial
Services Authority in the UK.The US system puts more emphasis on private contracting in which
more responsibility falls on investors and investment ﬁrms.In the United States there is an emphasis
on ensuring that investors have good information (through disclosure requirements) so that they
can make informed decisions.
The Enforcement Theory of Regulation
The distinction between the European and US systems could be seen in terms of a spectrum of
imperfect approaches to regulation described by Shleifer (2005) as the enforcement theory of
regulation.At one extreme of the spectrum is the approach of no external intervention on the basis
that the market mechanism would produce optimum solutions.The next approach is to allow
private litigation wherein aggrieved participants can take an offending counterparty to court.
Next along the spectrum is regulation, which entails intervention by a regulatory agency with a
view to preventing abuse.The other extreme along the spectrum is public ownership such that the
government owns the relevant organisations (e.g. state ownership of banks).
The enforcement theory of regulation recognises a trade-off between two social costs:disorder
and dictatorship.Disorder is an ability of private agents to disadvantage others through overcharging,
cheating, defrauding, imposing arbitrary costs, and so forth. Dictatorship is an ability of the
government,and government ofﬁcials,to disadvantage people in the same ways.Movement along
the spectrum of regulation, from a purely free market to government ownership, is paralleled by
movement from disorder to dictatorship.
None of the methods of regulation is perfect.A perfectly free market could entail,for example,
providers of ﬁnancial services using information asymmetries to take advantage of private
individuals.The opportunity for litigation is not perfect since there are legal costs.Arguably investors
would prefer that abuse is prevented rather than needing to undergo the costs,inconvenience,and
uncertainty involved in court proceedings. Furthermore the – relatively wealthy – providers of
services could afford superior legal representation.
An intermediate system between litigation and regulation is litigation based on public rules.The
government could create a set of rules and then leave the enforcement of those rules to private
parties using the courts.For example the government may lay down requirements for the disclosure
of information and conduct of business. Private parties could then take legal action against an
offending organisation if those requirements are not met.That type of legal action could be easier,
cheaper,and less susceptible to relative legal talent than action based on vague and imprecise criteria.
Regulation has the advantage that the regulators can accumulate expertise and could be backed
by speciﬁc laws, but there are risks that the processes and ofﬁcials could fail to be even-handed.
The regulator could be subject to political inﬂuence, open to bribery, or vulnerable to capture.
Capture entails the organisations being regulated gaining inﬂuence over the regulator with the
effect that regulation comes to be used to the advantage of those organisations rather than to the
advantage of consumers such as individual investors.
From the perspective of the enforcement theory of regulation,the European approach is close
to regulation whereas the US approach is closer to a market mechanism subject to the use of
litigation.Both make some use of the intermediate approach of litigation based on public rules laid
down by government.
THE RATIONALE AND CONDUCT OF REGULATION
155

THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE REGULATION
OF INVESTMENTS BUSINESS
The 1957 Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, set as a target
the free movement of goods and services among member countries.This included ﬁnancial services
and required,ultimately,the abolition of all restrictions on the freedom to supply ﬁnancial services
across national frontiers.A major barrier to the achievement of this aim related to the regulation
of ﬁnancial services.A single ﬁnancial market across the European Union appeared to require the
harmonisation of the regulatory systems of the different countries, in other words agreement on
a common set of rules.
Member countries proved reluctant to make concessions regarding their own regulations.The
issue then arose as to which regulations should apply to a ﬁrm that sold services across borders or
established branches in other countries.Should the regulations be those of the home country (the
country in which the ﬁrm is based) or those of the host country (the country in which the sales
are taking place)? For a period it was taken that the regulations of the host country should apply.
One justiﬁcation for this was the view that if home-country regulation applied then ﬁrms from
countries with lax regulatory requirements (and hence low costs of compliance with regulations)
would have a competitive advantage. A related argument concerned competitive laxity.There
would be an incentive for ﬁnancial services ﬁrms to locate their head ofﬁces in the member
countries with the most relaxed regulations, and for national governments to relax regulation in
order to attract ﬁnancial services ﬁrms. By relaxing its regulatory regime a country could give its
ﬁnancial services ﬁrms a competitive advantage.
However a European Court case in 1979 eased the problem of different national regulations.
The outcome of the case implied that the Treaty of Rome merely required the mutual recognition
of national laws.This meant that harmonisation of national laws was not necessary for the movement
to a single market. Mutual recognition of national laws is much easier than harmonisation.The
Cockﬁeld report of 1985 proposed that,in cases of mutual recognition,regulation should be based
on home-country requirements.The regulations of the country in which the ﬁnancial institution
was registered or licensed would apply no matter where it was doing business.This accepted the
principles of freedom of establishment and the cross-border provision of services within the
European Union since an institution authorised in one country would be deemed to be authorised
in all other member states.
The principles of mutual recognition and home-country regulation were applied in two
directives on the marketing of unit trusts (and OEICs) in 1985 and 1988.These allowed a unit trust
(or OEIC) that had been approved in one member country to be sold anywhere in the European
Union without further authorisation, provided it met investor protection requirements in force
in the host country.
The UK example of the creation of a single national regulator (the FSA),as opposed to regulation
being divided between a number of bodies,has been followed by other European Union member
states (Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Austria). It has also been suggested that there should be
a single pan-European ﬁnancial regulator.The idea of a pan-European regulator was taken up by
the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament. Currently the
approach being pursued is towards a single regulator in each country rather than a single pan-
European regulator. It has been pointed out that a pan-European regulator would need cross-

border enforcement powers,which would be difﬁcult without harmonised civil and criminal law
(Roberts 2004).
ENRON, WORLDCOM, AND LEMONS
George Akerlof, a Nobel prize-winning economist, wrote an article entitled ‘The Market for
“Lemons”:Quality,Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism’(Akerlof 1970) in which he discussed
asymmetric information and its implications.Asymmetric information is the term referring to the
fact that the managers of a corporation know more about its operation than investors know.
Investors cannot be sure about which corporations are good (the peaches) and which are bad (the
lemons). However the managers do know whether their ﬁrm is a peach or a lemon.
Shares as Lemons
The accounting scandals surrounding Enron and Worldcom have been used as explanations of
stock market falls in the period subsequent to the revelations.This sequence of events can be
interpreted as a problem of asymmetric information.
Since investors cannot easily distinguish between peaches and lemons, the price that they are
willing to pay for shares will fall between the high value of a peach and the low value of a lemon.
The price of the stock would be depressed by the knowledge that lemons are more likely than
peaches to issue shares. Lemons are happy to sell shares since the price obtainable exceeds their
value (the price being between the values for peaches and lemons). Peaches are less prepared to
sell their shares because they are priced too low. So lemons are more likely to sell shares with the
result that investors are more likely to be offered shares in lemons than in peaches.This is known
as adverse selection.
Another consequence of asymmetric information is moral hazard. Moral hazard is the
temptation for the managers to take excessive risks, or engage in activities that are not in the
interests of shareholders.
A form of moral hazard is the principal–agent problem. Shareholders are the principals and
managers are their agents.The agents may act in their own interests rather than in the interests of
the principals.
Asymmetric information can interfere with the effective operation of stock markets. If good
ﬁrms are unwilling to sell shares because the price is too low,and if investors are unwilling to buy
shares since the corporations that sell them may be lemons, there will be an insufﬁcient volume
of trading in shares. It is thus desirable to increase the amount of information about corporations
available to potential investors.
Information could be generated privately.Investors could engage in the search for information,
or employ others to do so.Unfortunately this encounters the free-rider problem.Some investors
will stand back and allow others to bear all the effort and cost of information acquisition whilst
sharing in the beneﬁts.This discourages the active investors since they will not draw all the beneﬁts
arising from their information-generating activities.The result is that the amount of information
produced privately will fall below the most desirable level.
One way in which the free-rider problem may be reduced is by the use of collective investments
(such as unit trusts,investment trusts,investment bonds,and pension funds) to channel the wealth
THE RATIONALE AND CONDUCT OF REGULATION
157

of individuals into stocks.The managers of such collective (institutional) investments might engage
in information-seeking activities on behalf of the individual investors.The fact that the cost of the
information generation is spread amongst a large number of individuals moderates the free-rider
problem.However,there is a risk that the principal–agent problem might be present.The managers
of the collective investments may reward themselves to such a degree that the beneﬁts of the
information acquired are used to enrich those managers rather than the individuals who provided
the money for the collective investments.
An alternative would be for the government, or other regulatory authority, to intervene with
a view to ensuring the provision of an adequate amount of information about ﬁrms.This normally
entails a requirement, placed upon corporations, to produce accounts that meet prescribed
standards and for those accounts to be veriﬁed by independent auditors.For this to be effective as
a means of reassuring investors that they can distinguish between peaches and lemons,the audited
accounts need to be regarded as reliable sources of information.
The revelations of accounting irregularities at Enron and Worldcom have undermined
conﬁdence in audited accounts. Investors found themselves unsure about which corporations
were peaches, and which were lemons. Corporations that had appeared to be good could no
longer be regarded as such with conﬁdence.The perceived likelihood of a ﬁrm turning out to be
a lemon had increased.To the extent that share prices reﬂect an average of the values of peaches
and lemons, the increased probability that ﬁrms are lemons reduces that average and hence the
share prices.
Bonds as Lemons
It is useful to consider the implications of asymmetric information from the point of view of
bondholders as well as from the perspective of shareholders. In relation to proﬁt uncertainties,
such as those arising from the revelation of accounting irregularities,bondholders suffer less than
shareholders. Bondholders receive ﬁxed coupon (interest) payments to which the corporation is
legally committed. Bondholders will suffer only if the proﬁt/loss position is so weak that the
corporation is unable to meet its legal obligations to bondholders.
From a different perspective, bondholders are more vulnerable than shareholders. Borrowers
may have an incentive to take on investment projects that are riskier than lenders (which include
bondholders) would like. Risky investments may be very proﬁtable, but entail the possibility that
everything will be lost. In the event of high proﬁts, bondholders do not share in the increased
payouts.The gains accrue to shareholders,who may include the managers.The beneﬁts to managers
would be enhanced if they are incentivised by share option schemes.Bondholders receive the same
coupon payments whatever the level of proﬁt. If the investment fails, bondholders, as well as
shareholders,may lose everything.Shareholders have an incentive to take risks whilst bondholders
would prefer a low risk approach.
This moral hazard increases as share prices fall.At low share prices, the shareholders have less
to lose from taking risks.The incentive to take risks is therefore greater. Since falling share prices
increase moral hazard,investors will become more reluctant to buy a ﬁrm’s bonds when its share
price falls.
Adverse selection occurs when those most likely to beneﬁt from a transaction are the ones who
most actively seek out the transaction and are thus most likely to be selected.In the case of bonds,
BASICS OF STOCK MARKETS
158

adverse selection implies that borrowers who are bad credit risks are the ones that most actively
sell bonds (selling bonds is a form of borrowing).
Bonds may be subject to legally binding restrictive covenants aimed at reducing moral hazard.
Such restrictive covenants are of four types: covenants to discourage undesirable behaviour,
covenants to encourage desirable behaviour, covenants to keep collateral valuable, and covenants
to provide information.
Restrictive covenants need to be monitored and enforced. Bondholders need to check on
whether the covenants are being adhered to, and take legal action if they are not.The free-rider
problem arises again.Not all bondholders will participate in policing restrictive covenants.Many
will assume that others are doing it.Those that do participate may be discouraged from doing so
by the fact that others are taking the beneﬁts without incurring the costs.The free-rider problem
is likely to cause the degree of monitoring and enforcement to fall below desirable levels.
Institutional investors,such as pension funds and insurance companies,may be more willing to
monitor and enforce restrictive covenants since the beneﬁts would accrue to a large number of
individual investors in their funds. Such institutional investors may hold a signiﬁcant quantity of
the bonds. However the principal–agent problem remains.The institutional fund managers are
agents operating on behalf of individual investors,who are the principals.The agents may be more
concerned with their own interests than with those of the principals.
CONCLUSION
Regulation is justiﬁed on the grounds of correcting market imperfections, the exploitation of
economies of scale in monitoring suppliers of ﬁnancial services,and the maintenance of consumer
conﬁdence. Regulation has its problems; these include the costs of regulation, the emergence of
moral hazard, and regulatory capture.
In the UK the Financial Services Authority (FSA) is the regulator for investment business.
Objectives of the FSA are the maintenance of market conﬁdence,promotion of ﬁnancial education,
consumer protection,and the reduction of ﬁnancial crime.Approaches to regulation differ between
countries, partly because of the different structures of the ﬁnancial services industries. The
European approach to regulation differs signiﬁcantly from the American approach, but recent
history indicates that regulatory systems on both sides of the Atlantic have been unable to prevent
all errors and abuses. No means of regulation is perfect, and the consumer must remain wary of
possible failures and abuses.
The rise of institutional investments has made the regulation of such investments central to the
maintenance of consumer conﬁdence.There are types of risk that regulation does not attempt to
remove, such as the risk of loss from stock market movements.The regulator may seek to ensure
that consumers and advisers understand those risks, but does not prevent consumers taking such
risks.If investors do not want the risk of equity investment,they may choose lower risk (and lower
prospective return) bond or money market investments.Ensuring that consumers understand the
risks is part of the educational aim of the FSA.However it is not just the consumers that may need
THE RATIONALE AND CONDUCT OF REGULATION
159

ﬁnancial education;the ﬁnancial advisers and investment managers may also need it.The following
quote is of interest:
The recent fall in equity markets has exposed the fact that some of those manufacturing
or selling long-term savings products often have a poor understanding of the underlying
risks inherent in them. Too often, therefore, savers have bought long-term savings
products without any satisfactory explanation of the inherent risks.
(House of Commons Treasury Committee 2004)
The quote also highlights another risk that is only indirectly addressed by regulation.This is
management risk, which is the risk that the manager of a fund performs poorly relative to the
market.Consumers can avoid this risk by investing in index tracker funds,which aim to track the
stock market rather than trying to outperform it (see Chapter 9 on mutual funds).They thus avoid
the possibility that fund managers,in attempting to outperform the market,actually underperform
the market. The regulatory role is limited to attempting to ensure that fund managers are
competent. Chapters 9 on mutual funds, Part 7 on market efﬁciency, and Chapter 17 on the
evaluation of the performance of fund managers cite considerable evidence to the effect that, on
average, investment managers underperform stock markets.
Moral hazard is a major problem. Investors may believe that regulation is more pervasive than
it actually is and,in consequence,they fail to take proper precautions.Investors,and their advisers,
should not only be fully aware of the risks inherent in investments; they should also be aware of
the risks inherent in themselves.The risks inherent in themselves include the psychological biases
identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance. Investors should be aware of the psychological and social
inﬂuences on their investment decisions,as described in Chapters 24 and 2 dealing with behavioural
ﬁnance and the psychology of personal ﬁnance, respectively. Investors should be prepared to
regulate themselves.

Institutional Investments


Chapter 9
Mutual funds (unit trusts,
OEICs, investment trusts)
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The purposes of mutual funds.
2. Unit trusts, OEICs, and investment trusts.
3. Index (tracker) funds.
4. The effects of charges and taxation on investment returns.
5. Tax-advantaged investment schemes.
6. Pound cost averaging.
7. Evidence on the performance of mutual funds.
BENEFITS OF MUTUAL FUNDS
A major form of institutional investment is the mutual fund.Mutual funds come in many varieties.
In the United Kingdom there are three broad types.These are investment trusts, unit trusts, and
OEICs (Open-Ended Investment Companies – pronounced ‘oiks’).Some people prefer to restrict
the term ‘mutual funds’ to unit trusts and OEICs, but this is just a matter of semantics. Similar
instruments exist in other countries, but often with different names.These forms of collective
investment have both similarities and differences.
All forms of mutual fund allow investors to have a spread of investments for a small money
outlay. For example £1,000 can buy part of a fund, which contains more than 100 different
shareholdings.In this way small investors can enjoy the risk-reduction beneﬁts of a well-diversiﬁed
portfolio.Stockbroker commission costs would render the acquisition of a large number of different
shareholdings impractical for small investors.The returns from mutual funds come in two forms:
one is the dividend (or interest) income from the investments and the other is the increase in the
prices of the investments.There is a risk that prices fall but diversiﬁcation reduces this risk since,
to some extent, losses on some investments will be offset by gains on others.
Mutual funds provide other advantages to investors. They provide administration of the
investments on behalf of investors. For example dividends could be automatically reinvested on
163

behalf of the investors.They remove the need for investors to ascertain which shares or bonds to
buy;the choice is made by professional fund managers.However these services have to be paid for
by annual fees taken from the dividends (or from the capital of the fund),and it is controversial as
to whether the investment choices of professional fund managers are, on average, superior to
random stock selections.
Mutual funds permit a choice of investment strategy.There are general,high income,and growth
funds.There are funds that focus on asset classes, for example funds that invest exclusively in
bonds. Many funds allow for particular geographical orientations (Europe funds, North America
funds, Far East funds, etc.).
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNIT TRUSTS,
INVESTMENT TRUSTS, AND OEICs
A unit trust is a fund managed by a bank, insurance company, or investment company. Individual
investors buy units in the fund.An investment trust is a company whose purpose is to invest in other
companies. Individual investors buy shares in the investment trust company. An OEIC (Open-
Ended Investment Company) is a company whose purpose is to invest in other companies (like an
investment trust).Individual investors buy shares in funds operated by the OEICs,but these shares
are similar to the units sold by unit trusts.
An investment trust has a board of directors, which decides on broad investment strategy and
objectives. The implementation of the strategy and objectives is normally carried out by an
investment management company.A unit trust is constituted by a trust deed.The unit trust manager
is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the fund (the manager is normally an insurance
company, bank, or investment company). Each unit trust fund has a trustee, which must be
independent of the manager.The role of trustee is normally taken by a bank or insurance company.
The trustee is custodian of the assets (e.g. it holds the share certiﬁcates), maintains a register of
unit holders,and generally oversees the management of the trust fund.The trustee has the role of
protecting the interests of unitholders and ensuring that the managers do not stray from their
stated objectives.The managers are able to advertise and market unit trusts directly to the public.
The funds are exempt from capital gains tax; instead such taxes are payable by unitholders whose
individual capital gains exceed the personal exemption limit (investment trusts and their investors
receive similar treatment in relation to capital gains tax). UK authorised unit trusts investing in
equities can hold no more than 10% of the fund in any one company, and no more than 10% of
the issued capital of a company can be held.
Unit trusts are open-ended.The purchase or sale of units by individual investors causes the
fund to expand or contract.Likewise the number of units increases or decreases.The transactions
are carried out with the investment manager. OEICs are similar to unit trusts in these respects.
Investment trusts are closed funds.The purchase or sale of shares by individual investors has no
effect on the size of the fund. An unchanged number of shares change hands.Transactions are
carried out with other investors through the medium of a stock exchange.In the case of investment
trusts day-to-day ﬂuctuations in demand are reﬂected in moving share prices.By contrast,unit trust
(and OEIC) managers regularly issue new units (or shares) or buy back existing ones in order to
accommodate ﬂuctuations in demand.
Since sales of shares in investment trusts do not require the fund manager to sell any of the assets,
the manager need not be concerned about the liquidity of the assets.This facilitates investments
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
164

in illiquid markets such as private equity (venture capital),other small ﬁrms,and emerging markets.
The sale of unit trusts and OEICs involves the liquidation of part of the fund.Assets need to be
sold in order that the investment manager can redeem units. For this reason the managers of unit
trusts and OEICs need to hold part of the fund in liquid assets.In particular part of the fund might
be held on deposit in banks so as to avoid the sale of securities (shares,bonds) in the event of units
being redeemed.This is likely to reduce the expected rate of return on the fund. If there is a
substantial volume of sales by investors, the fund manager will be forced to sell securities. If the
markets for those securities are not liquid,the sales could be at unfavourable prices.The problem
is compounded by the possibility that redemptions will peak during times of market uncertainty
with the result that asset sales occur when the markets are least liquid.The inﬂows and outﬂows
of funds generated by retail investors can cause unit trusts and OEICs to be active buyers and
sellers.As a result they can have a signiﬁcant effect on stock market prices.
In the case of unit trusts, the value of a unit is directly based on the value of the investments in
the fund.The total value of the units equals the total value of the investments in the fund. OEICs
are similar to unit trusts in this respect.Unit trusts and OEICs must be valued on a daily basis,and
to facilitate this they tend to restrict their investments to those whose prices are quoted every day
(such as shares that are listed on a stock exchange).In the case of investment trusts,the total value
of the investment trust shares normally differs from the total value of the investments held by the
fund.The prices of investment trust shares are determined by demand and supply,and these forces
can pull the value of an investment trust company away from the value of the investments that it
holds.Net asset value (NAV) is the market value of all the assets held by the investment trust (net
of liabilities) divided by the number of investment trust shares issued.If the price of the investment
trust shares is less than the net asset value, those shares are said to trade at a discount to net asset
value. If the price of the shares exceeds the net asset value, they are said to trade at a premium. In
other words,if the total value of the investment trust shares is less than the value of the investments
(net of any debts) held by the trust,the price of the investment trust shares is said to be at a discount
to net asset value; in the opposite situation the shares are said to be trading at a premium to net
asset value.

MUTUAL FUNDS
165

Unit trusts typically involve a difference between the buying (offer) price and the selling (bid)
price. Frequently buying prices are 5–7% higher than selling prices (buying from the unit trust
manager and selling back to the manager).Investment trusts and OEICs have a single price,although
the buyer of an OEIC may have to pay an initial charge or the seller of an OEIC may have to pay
an exit (withdrawal) charge.In the case of investment trusts,transaction costs are incurred through
commission payments to brokers rather than via a spread between buying and selling prices
(although, as with other shares, there will be a small bid-offer spread).
Unit trusts and OEICs are bought from the investment manager, and are redeemed by being
sold back to the investment manager. In the case of investment trusts, shares are bought and sold
through the stock market. One feature that distinguishes OEICs from unit and investment trusts
is the fact that they are umbrella funds.There are several different funds within an OEIC.
OEICs came into existence in 1997 as a result of European legislation to create a single European
market for investment products (Roberts 2004).Unlike unit trusts,OEICs are not based on trust
law.They are based on specially framed company law. In common with European practice, OEIC
shares have a single price rather than the separate buying (offer) and selling (bid) prices of unit
trusts. OEICs seem to be gradually replacing unit trusts.
Another difference between investment trusts,on one hand,and unit trusts and OEICs,on the
other,concerns the ability to borrow.Investment trusts have very extensive borrowing powers and
can thereby increase their exposure to stocks by using borrowed money to buy shares.This is
known as gearing or leverage.This increase in market exposure can render investment trust prices
more volatile than those of unit trusts and OEICs,which are able to borrow only up to 10% of the
fund.Another factor that can cause investment trust prices to be more volatile than those of unit
trusts and OEICs is the existence of discounts and premiums. Investment trust prices can change
as a result of variations in discounts and premiums,whereas unit trusts and OEICs do not have this
source of price volatility. The increased risk arising from gearing has been suggested as an
explanation for the discount on many investment trusts.
EXERCISE 9.2
An investment trust has 100% gearing (the principal investment has been matched by borrowing
so as to double the size of the shareholding). If the money is borrowed at 6% p.a., what would be
the return on the principal investment in the event of stock returns of (a) 0%,(b) 3%,(c) 8%,and
(d) 15% p.a.?
In the event of a sudden (e) halving, and (f) doubling, of the value of the shares held by the
investment trust, what would happen to the value (NAV) of the investment trust?
Answers
(a) If the portfolio return is 0% p.a. but 6% must be paid on a sum equal to the principal
investment, the rate of return on the principal investment would be 6% p.a.
(b) If the total portfolio return is 3% p.a.,this is equivalent to 6% p.a.on the principal investment
since the total portfolio is double the principal investment.There is 6% p.a.interest on a sum
equal to the principal investment. So the net return is 6%  6%  0% p.a.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
166

(c) If the total portfolio return is 8% p.a.,this is equivalent to 16% p.a.on the principal investment
since the total portfolio is double the principal investment.There is a 6% p.a.rate of interest
on a sum equal to the principal investment. So the net return is 16%  6%  10% p.a.
(d) If the total portfolio return is 15% p.a., this is equivalent to 30% p.a. on the principal
investment. So the net return is 30%  6%  24% p.a.
(e) If the value of the shares held by the investment trust suddenly halved in value, there would
be a loss equal to the principal investment (the value of the total portfolio was double the
value of the principal investment).The assets would now be matched by liabilities (invest-
ments matched by debts) meaning that the investors have lost all their money but the debt
can be repaid.
(f) If the value of the shares had suddenly doubled, the value of the shareholding would be four
times the original principal investment.Net of the debt,the investment trust (its NAV) would
be three times the value of the original principal investment.Investors would have tripled their
wealth as a result of the doubling of share prices (ignoring any changes in discounts/premiums).
Some investment trusts are split-capital trusts.Split-capital trusts are split into income shares and
capital shares.The holders of the income shares receive all the dividends from the investment trust
plus a predetermined return of capital.Since the holders receive the dividends from the investments
in capital shares as well as the dividends on their own investments, the holders of income shares
may have a very high yield (high income yield) investment.The holders of the capital shares receive
all the capital gains.The holders of the capital shares have a highly geared investment.They receive
all the capital gains (from both their own investments and those of the holders of income shares)
but would suffer the whole of any capital losses. Split-capital investment trusts have a winding up
date on which the assets are sold and the proceeds distributed to the holders of the investment trust
shares.
Some split-capital investment trusts issue zero dividend preference shares,alternatively known
as zeros.Zero dividend preference shares pay nothing to the investor until the share matures.The
return to the investor arises from the fact that the shares are bought at a discount to (a lower price
than) the sum to be paid at maturity.
Unit investment trusts also have maturity dates. Unit investment trusts use passive fund
management in the form of the buy-and-hold strategy.Assets are bought and held until the unit
investment trust matures.The investments purchased are not changed during the life of the fund.
The fund accepts initial capital from investors, and that capital is invested.There are no further
cash ﬂows into the fund from investors.The initial investments are held until the fund matures,
and income from those investments is distributed to the investors.On the maturity date of the fund
the investments are sold and the capital returned to the investors.Unit investment trusts frequently
invest in bonds.
In the cases of unit trusts and OEICs the ultimate investor is taxed in almost exactly the same
way as if he or she held the underlying assets directly.It is the unitholder or shareholder who is liable
to tax,not the fund.In order to be exempt from capital gains tax,an investment trust must satisfy
the following conditions.The company’s income is derived at least 70% from securities.No single
MUTUAL FUNDS
167

holding can exceed 15% of the fund.The investment trust’s shares are quoted on the London
Stock Exchange.The company must not distribute realised capital gains as dividends. It does not
retain more than 15% of the income it receives from investment in securities. If an investment
trust meets these conditions, liability for capital gains tax falls upon the investor rather than
the investment trust (and many investors would have capital gains that fall below the annual
exemption limit).
Unit trusts and OEICs are often available as either income or accumulation units (or shares).
Income units pay the dividends to the investors whereas accumulation units reinvest the dividends
(so as to enhance the rate of price increase). Investment trusts do not have such a division.
Investment trusts distribute most of the dividends to their shareholders, but may retain some to
reinvest within the fund.
Investment Trust Share Buy-Backs
In some cases the managers of investment trusts attempt to reduce the size of the discounts. One
method entails the investment trust buying its own shares in order to increase demand and hence
the share price.The bought-in shares can either be cancelled or held in treasury. Shares held in
treasury can be reissued at a later date. If the repurchase of shares maintains a limit to the size of
the discount,and if investors come to believe that the discount will be limited to that size,arbitrage
could maintain the limit without the investment trust managers repurchasing shares.Arbitragers
would buy shares,if the discount exceeded the limit,in the belief that the investment trust manager
would maintain the limit.The arbitragers would buy the investment trust shares at the high
discount,and hence low price,in the knowledge that they will be able to sell the shares at a lower
discount (and hence higher price) to the investment trust manager. By buying the shares, the
arbitragers raise the share price and thereby maintain the limit.In consequence the investment trust
manager may not need to buy back shares.
The repurchase of shares by the investment trust manager is likely to enhance the
return to shareholders. This is partly because the buy-back reduces the discount and hence
raises the share price. It is partly because repurchasing at a discount entails buying into the
investment trust portfolio at an advantageous price.The latter effect is illustrated by the following
example.
The shares of an investment trust are priced at 320p and the net asset value (NAV) per share is
400p. This implies a 20% discount. The investment trust has issued 100 million shares. The
investment trust holds investments of £400 million (400p 100 million).The market capitalisation
of the investment trust is £320 million (320p  100 million).
Suppose that the investment trust buys back 15 million shares (15% of the outstanding issue is
the maximum allowed in one ﬁnancial year).The cost of the buy-back would be 320p  15 million
 £48 million (assuming that the buy-back does not immediately raise the share price).The money
used for the buy-back is taken from the assets held by the investment trust.The NAV falls to £352
million (£400 million  £48 million).The number of shares has fallen to 85 million (100 million
 15 million) with the result that the NAV per share has risen to £352,000,000/85,000,000 
£4.14 (414p).This is a 3.5% increase in NAV per share.If the discount remains at 20%,there would
also be an increase in the share price of 3.5% (since the ratio between NAV per share and the share
price would be unchanged).
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
168

This effect on the share price arises from the fact that buying at a discount entails buying the
shares,held by the investment trust,cheaply.Investors who sell the investment trust shares receive
£48 million but give up a claim on £60 million of investments within the trust.The remaining
shareholders proﬁt by £12 million (£60 million  £48 million).The effect would be lessened if
the share price rose during the buy-back. However such a share price rise would directly beneﬁt
existing shareholders (it would reduce the discount). (This example is based on one given in the

An investment trust trades at a 20% discount to net asset value, which amounts to £100 million.
The investment trust manager spends £10 million on buying back shares.
(a) If the discount remains at 20%, what happens to the share price?
(b) If the discount immediately falls to 10%, and remains at that level, what happens to the
share price?
Answers
The market capitalisation (share price  number of shares) is £100 million  0.8  £80 million.
(a) For every £100 of previous net asset value, £90 now remains since £10 has been used to
repurchase shares. For every £80 of previous market capitalisation, £70 now remains since
£10 worth of shares has been repurchased.
The implied discount rate is: 1  (market capitalisation/net asset value).
The implied discount is: 1  (70/90)  0.2222, i.e. 22.22%.
In order for the discount to return to 20%, the market capitalisation must rise to £90 million
0.8 £72 million.The required rise in the share price is (72/70) 1 0.0286,i.e.2.86%.
The share price rise is brought about by the purchase of a portion of the portfolio at a
discounted price.
(b) For every £100 of previous net asset value, £90 now remains since £10 has been used to
repurchase shares.
The market capitalisation ﬁrst moves to £90 million to reﬂect the 10% discount.
It then falls to £80 million because of the share buy-back.
The implied discount is: 1  (80/90)  0.1111, i.e. 11.11%.
A further change is required to restore the 10% discount.The market capitalisation should
rise to £81 million.
For every 100 shares previously in issue, there are now (80/90)  100  88.88 shares.
For every £80 of previous market capitalisation, there is now £81.This implies a share price
rise of [(100/88.88) (81/80)] 1 0.1391,i.e.13.91%.(If the market capitalisation were

unchanged a fall in the number of shares from 100 to 88.88 would need to be offset by a share
price rise of 100/88.88.If the market capitalisation increases,the share price rise would need
to be correspondingly greater.)
The share price rise is brought about by two factors. One factor is the effect of buying a
portion of the portfolio at a discounted price.This factor can be repeated in subsequent
periods.The other factor is a narrowing of the discount.There is likely to be a limit to the effect
of this factor such that it cannot be repeated for many periods.
The narrowing of the discount provides a return of (90/80) 1  0.125,i.e.12.5%.This
implies that the effect of buying at the discounted price is an addition to return of 13.91 
12.5  1.41%. It might be noted that this ﬁgure is very close to half the return arising from
buying into the portfolio at a discount of 20%.
Another approach to reducing discounts is to allow, at frequent intervals, investors to sell their
shares to the investment trust manager at a small, predetermined discount.The belief is that this
facility will support the share price and prevent large discounts from occurring since the emergence
of a large discount would entice share purchases by investors who know that they can resell the
shares to the manager at a low discount.The danger of a regular buy-back programme is that the
investment trust could shrink until it is too small to be viable. It also removes the advantage that
investment trusts have in being able to buy illiquid investments knowing that they cannot be forced
to sell them to meet investor redemptions.
Share buy-back programmes also compromise the closed-ended nature of investment trusts.
The closed-ended nature of investment trusts is also reduced by the new (since 2003) facility to
hold shares in treasury.Shares held in treasury can be reissued so that increases in demand may be
accommodated by the reissue of shares.The effects are that both reductions in demand, and
increases in demand, can be met by changes in the number of shares in issue rather than by
movements in the share price.

Share Repurchases
The Board has maintained its active approach towards share repurchases in order to enhance
the net asset value and minimise the absolute level and volatility of the discount on the
Company’s shares. In the six months to 31 July 2007, 17,398,801 shares were repurchased for
cancellation at a total cost of £233.6m. Those purchases added approximately 22.6p to the
net asset value per share. The discount, with debt at fair value, has ranged between 7.6% and
12.3% in the period from 1 February to 21 September 2007, with the average discount during
the period 9.9%.

Explanations for Investment Trust Discounts and Premiums
It is not well understood why many investment trusts trade at a discount to net asset value. One
explanation is that the discount reﬂects the management charges that are paid out of the fund. If
the share price is seen as the present value of expected future dividends, and dividends are net of
fund management charges,the share price will be depressed by the effect of charges on net dividend
receipts.Gemmill and Thomas (2006) found that charges tend to be high when there is a large board
of directors,and when the members of the board largely come from the fund management company
running the investment trust.However high fees were found to be associated with low ownership
of the investment trust shares by the management company whereas discounts were large when
the fund management company owned a large stake.This seems to suggest that large discounts are
associated with low charges.
Another explanation runs in terms of poor investment performance causing share sales,
which push down the prices of investment trust shares,thereby creating (or increasing) discounts.
(Conversely strong investment performance could produce premiums to net asset value.) Fund
charges and the perceived quality of fund management, as explanations for discounts and
premiums, have been discussed by Ross (2002). A third explanation points to the fact
that investment trusts often hold assets that are not easily valued. Such assets include unquoted
shares and the infrequently traded shares of very small companies. Uncertainty as to net asset
value may be partially responsible for discounts. Pontiff (1996) demonstrated that deviations
of price from net asset value were related to (non-systematic) risk; high risk was associated
with large deviations.The analysis of the discounts (and occasionally premiums) continues to be a
subject of research (for example Ferguson and Leistikow 2001; Barclay et al. 1993; Lee et
al. 1991).
Much of the debate concerning the explanation of discounts and premiums centres around the
issue of investor rationality. Lee et al. (1991) propose that ﬂuctuations in discounts are driven by
changes in investor sentiment,and changes in sentiment are seen as reﬂecting irrational behaviour.
Discounts are high when investors are pessimistic about future returns, and low when investors
are optimistic.This is a general market sentiment that affects all investment trusts and other

investments.The reason why investment trusts,on average,exhibit discounts is explained in terms
of the additional risk imparted by the effects of unpredictable changes in sentiment.
Ferguson and Leistikow (2004) take the view that discounts and premiums can be explained
without supposing that investors behave in an irrational manner.They explain discounts and
premiums in terms of expected investment performance. One piece of evidence cited in favour
of their view is the mean reversion of discounts following changes in fund managers.When the
managers of a fund change the discount reverts towards the average investment trust discount.This
is consistent with the view that the previous discount reﬂected the expected performance of the
previous fund managers, and is not easily explained in terms of market-wide changes in investor
sentiment. Conversely it is difﬁcult to invoke a rational explanation for the tendency of investors
to buy newly created investment trusts at a premium when past experience indicates that initial
premiums soon turn into discounts, thereby providing early losses for the investors. It is notable
that both approaches explain discounts in terms of expected fund performance; the difference
appears to lie in how those expectations are formed.
EXERCISE 9.4
An investor has £100,000 to invest.The investor does not want to manage the investment over time.
Assuming an average dividend yield of 4% p.a. on shares, compare the net dividend yield from:
(a) direct investment in a portfolio of shares,
(b) purchase of shares in an investment trust which has annual charges of 1% on NAV and whose
shares sell at a 25% discount.
(c) What implications might be drawn about the explanation of the discount?
(d) How might the implications change if the discount were 20%?
Answers
(a) The dividend yield is 4% p.a., i.e. £4,000 p.a.
(b) If the investment trust sells at a 25% discount, the share price is 0.75  NAV. So
NAV  share price/0.75  1.33  share price.
There is a dividend yield of 4% p.a. on NAV, and charges of 1% p.a. on NAV, leaving a net
dividend yield of 3% p.a.The net dividend yield for a holder of the investment trust is 3% 
1.33  4% p.a., i.e. £4,000 p.a.
The value of the dividends on NAV is 4% of £133,333,that is £5,333.From this,a charge
of 1% of £133,333 (i.e. £1,333) is deducted.The dividend payable to the investor amounts
to £5,333  £1,333  £4,000.
(c) The dividend yields from (a) and (b) are equal.The effect of the discount offsets the charges
when considering the rate of yield on the investment trust.This might be seen as implying that
MUTUAL FUNDS
173

charges can explain the discount.The price of the investment trust falls to the extent required
to raise the rate of yield sufﬁciently to offset the cost of the charges.
(d) If the discount were 20%, the share price would be 0.8  NAV. So
NAV  share price/0.8  1.25  share price.
The dividend yield on NAV,after charges,is 3% p.a.The dividend yield on the investment trust
shares is 3%  1.25  3.75% p.a.This is below the 4% p.a.from direct investment in shares.
The perceived quality of investment management, or the convenience of the management
being carried out on the investors’ behalf, could explain why the discount is less than 25%.
Investors are willing to forgo 0.25% p.a. in order to beneﬁt from professional investment
management.
INDEX (TRACKER) FUNDS
An index fund,alternatively known as a tracker fund,aims to replicate the performance of a stock
index.The emergence of index funds arose from the observation that actively managed funds fail,
on average,to outperform stock indices.This is related to the issue of market efﬁciency.Active fund
management is predicated on the view that portfolio managers can forecast market movements
and the performance of individual stocks relative to the market with the effect that they can
consistently outperform stock indices.If the efﬁcient market hypothesis is correct,it is not possible
to consistently forecast either overall market movements or the relative performance of individual
stocks. If this is the case, investors should avoid the transaction and management costs associated
with actively managed funds by investing in index funds whose aim is merely to move in line with
the stock market (as measured by a stock index).
One advantage of index funds, to the individual investor in collective investments, is that they
avoid management risk.The performance of actively managed funds can, during any period of
time,vary considerably.Some will outperform a stock index and others will underperform it.The
difference between the best and the worst can be considerable. If the direction and size of the
deviations from the index occur by chance, as empirical evidence seems to suggest (see Part 7 on
market efﬁciency and Chapter 17 on the evaluation of fund managers), the individual investor
faces a management risk.Individual investors run the risk that their chosen funds are relatively poor
performers. By investing in index funds they avoid this management risk (which is also known as
active risk).
Another advantage of index funds, relative to actively managed funds, is that they ensure that
the portfolio remains diversiﬁed. Actively managed funds, in their attempts to outperform the
market, may hold poorly diversiﬁed portfolios. For example they may tilt the portfolio towards
particular sectors. To the extent that actively managed funds hold inadequately diversiﬁed
portfolios,they sacriﬁce part of the risk-reduction beneﬁt of diversiﬁcation.However some stock
indices, and hence some index tracker funds, can be concentrated on a few sectors.
Probably the greatest advantage of index funds is that they are much cheaper to run than actively
managed funds. For example many actively managed UK unit trusts and OEICs have a 6% initial
charge, an annual 1.5% management charge, and transaction costs around 1% per year.This
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
174

compares with index tracker funds which typically have a zero initial charge,a 0.5% annual charge,
and minimal transaction costs.
In 2002 the Sandler report noted that the average actively managed UK unit trust under-
performed the stock market by about 2.5% p.a., largely because of charges. However more than
90% of retail investors choose actively managed unit trusts rather than index trackers.The Sandler
report suggested that this predominance of actively managed fund purchases  was probably because
they pay more commission to ﬁnancial advisers. Since tracker funds pay lower commission to
ﬁnancial advisers, the advisers are less likely to recommend them to their clients.
A drawback of index funds is that they tend to omit the shares of very small ﬁrms. Even broad
indices have a cut-off in terms of company size. For example, in the UK the FT All-Share Index
covers about 800 stocks.This eliminates more than 1,000 ﬁrms whose market capitalisations are
not sufﬁcient.Actively managed funds are able to include any stocks,including those with very small
market capitalisations.
TRACKING ERROR
Portfolios constructed to replicate an index rarely succeed in precisely tracking the index.The
tracking error is the difference between the total return on the replicating portfolio held by the
index fund, and the total return on the index.The total return consists of both dividends and
capital gains (or losses).
An index fund may hold all the stocks in the index, with weights corresponding to those of
the index. This involves little tracking error but can involve signiﬁcant transaction costs.
Alternatively a subset of the index might be used.This approach reduces transaction costs but
increases tracking error.
Even if the replicating portfolio contains all the stocks in the index, appropriately weighted,
there are sources of tracking error.The constituent stocks of an index are subject to change.
Replacing stocks involves transaction costs. Furthermore the replacement is not instantaneous.
Tracking is imperfect during the time taken to replace stocks.
Changes in the composition of an index can also affect stock prices. If index funds are widely
used,stocks leaving the index will be sold in large numbers by index funds.As a result their prices
fall and the funds receive unfavourable prices.Conversely stocks entering the index will be bought
by index funds with the effect that their prices rise.The funds thus buy these stocks at raised prices.
So the marginal stocks,those prone to move in and out of an index,are sold at low prices and bought
at high prices.This weakens the performance of index tracker funds.
EXERCISE 9.5
An investor has £100,000 to invest.The investor does not want to manage the investment over time.
Assuming an average dividend yield of 4% p.a. on shares, compare the net dividend yield from:
(a) direct investment in a portfolio of shares,
(b) investment in an actively managed OEIC with an annual management charge of 1.5% and
annual trading costs of 0.5%,
MUTUAL FUNDS
175

(c) investment in an index tracker OEIC with an annual management charge of 0.3% and annual
trading costs of 0.2%,
(d) purchase of shares in an actively managed investment trust with an annual management charge
of 0.5% and annual trading costs of 0.5%. Suppose that the investment trust sells at a 20%
discount to NAV.
(e) What other considerations would inﬂuence the choice between the investment alternatives?
Answers
(a) The yield is 4% p.a., i.e. £4,000 p.a.
(b) The net dividend yield on the actively managed OEIC is 4%  1.5%  0.5%  2% p.a.,i.e.
£2,000 p.a.
(c) The net dividend yield on the index tracker OEIC is 4%  0.3%  0.2%  3.5% p.a., i.e.
£3,500 p.a.
(d) If the investment trust discount were 20%, the share price would be 0.8  NAV.
So NAV  share price/0.8  1.25  share price.
The dividend yield on NAV,after costs,is 4%  0.5%  0.5%  3% p.a.The dividend yield
on the investment trust shares is 3%  1.25  3.75% p.a.
The value of the dividends on NAV is 4% of £125,000, that is £5,000. From this, costs of
1% of £125,000 (i.e.£1,250) are deducted.The dividend payable to the investor amounts to
£5,000  £1,250  £3,750.This is 3.75% of the £100,000 invested.
This is below the 4% p.a. (£4,000 p.a.) from direct investment in shares but better than
the net dividend yields from the OEICs.
(e) The advantage of the OEICs and investment trust relative to direct investment is the
convenience of professionals managing the investment on the investors’ behalf.
The index tracker fund avoids management risk, which is the risk that the investment
managers perform badly.This risk is present in actively managed funds.Investment trusts also
suffer from the risk that the discount might increase and thereby reduce the market value of
the investment.
EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a recent innovation on stock exchanges.An institutional investor
creates an exchange-traded fund by depositing a block of shares with the ETF. In return the
institution receives ETF shares,which may then be sold on a stock exchange.ETFs are shares that
replicate stock indices such as the FTSE 100. In other words they are index tracker funds.They
are not unit trusts,investment trusts,or OEICs.Relative to unit trusts and OEICs,exchange-traded
funds have the advantage of being tradable at prices that continuously reﬂect the current value of
the relevant index. Unit trusts and OEICs are bought and sold at prices that are established just
once a day.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
176

Relative to investment trusts, ETFs have the advantage of not being subject to discounts and
premiums to net asset value.This is because ETFs are open-ended (like unit trusts and OEICs).
Large blocks of ETF shares can be exchanged for portfolios of the underlying shares.The fact that
trades can be settled using the underlying shares rather than cash serves to prevent the emergence
of discounts and premiums. If discounts were to emerge they should be removed by arbitrage.
Institutions could buy large blocks of ETFs at the low price and immediately exchange them for
shares at a proﬁt.So discounts should lead to large purchases that push prices up so as to eliminate
the discounts.Premiums should lead to sales of ETFs as the underlying shares could be purchased
at a lower price.Shares in exchange-traded funds can be bought and sold through stockbrokers in
the same way as any other shares.It might be noted that ETFs are open-ended with respect to large
trades (and with respect to redemptions rather than the creation of ETF shares) but are closed-
ended for small investors since small investors would not be in a position to exchange large blocks
of ETF shares for the underlying portfolios.Traded index securities (TRAINS) are similar to
exchange-traded funds.
ETFs have two disadvantages for small investors.The ﬁrst is that there may be poor liquidity;
it could be difﬁcult to ﬁnd buyers and sellers (although this has not proven to be a general problem).
The other is that ETFs are not useful for regular savings plans. Since each purchase entails
stockbroker commissions,the cost of regular monthly purchases would be prohibitive.On the plus
side, ETFs tend to have low fund management costs.
EFFECTS OF FUND CHARGES
Investment managers charge fees.These fees cover the costs of investment analysis, portfolio
management,marketing,and administration.Sometimes the annual management charge is related
to fund performance,but this is the exception rather than the norm.The payment of such charges
reduces the returns to investors.The charges levied by fund managers vary considerably.In relation
to unit trusts the cheapest tend to be index tracker funds (which aim to parallel a stock index).
Tracker funds (index funds) typically have no front-end or exit charge and annual management
charges of as little as 0.25% or 0.5%. Conversely actively managed funds tend to have initial
charges of 5 to 7% and annual management charges of up to (and sometimes exceeding) 1.5% p.a.
These differences in charges can have considerable effects on investment returns over time.
(Comparison of management charges actually understates the difference in total annual costs since
actively managed funds tend to trade shares more frequently and hence incur greater brokerage
fees than index tracker funds.)
In addition to management charges there are stockbroker commissions. Each time that shares
are bought or sold commission is paid to stockbrokers.For many funds such commissions can add
well over 1% per year to the costs of operating the fund.This is particularly true for funds with
high portfolio turnover (high churning).A portfolio turnover of 100% means that, on average,
shares are bought and sold once a year. Some shares would be kept for several years whilst others
are held for a fraction of a year, but the average holding period is one year.The average holding
period is given by:
Average Holding Period 
12 Months

Portfolio Turnover/100
MUTUAL FUNDS
177

So an annual turnover of 100% gives an average holding period of 12 months and an annual
turnover of 200% implies that shares,on average,are held for six months.High rates of turnover,
and low average holding periods, entail high brokerage costs.As with other costs, unless there is
an offsetting improved investment performance,the costs will reduce the rate of return obtained
by investors in the funds. Index tracker funds have relatively low rates of portfolio turnover, and
hence low brokerage costs, compared with actively managed funds.
There are three ﬁgures commonly used for the purpose of making cost comparisons between
funds.First,there is the annual management charge (AMC).Second,there is the total expense ratio
(TER), which is the annual management charge plus other fees such as audit and custody fees.
However,TER does not necessarily include brokerage and other share dealing costs.Nor does the
TER take account of initial charges.The reduction in yield (RIY) shows the effect of the TER costs,
plus any initial or exit charges, on the percentage yield from the investment.The calculated RIY
is very sensitive to the assumed period of investment.The normal practice is to assume a ten-year
investment.Shorter investments have higher RIYs since the initial (and/or exit) charge would be
spread over a smaller number of years.Conversely longer investments have lower RIYs.If published
RIYs are based on ten-year investments, they can be misleading for investors with different
investment horizons.
Consider the investment of £1,000 in each of fund A and fund B.Suppose that the investments
in both funds grow at an average of 7% p.a. in real terms (that is in excess of what is needed to
compensate for inﬂation).This growth rate is in line with historical experience of equity funds and
incorporates both capital gains and net dividend income.The ﬁgure of 7% p.a. does not take
account of management charges.
Suppose that A is an index tracker fund with no front-end charge and an annual management
fee of 0.5%. All of the investors’ money is invested and the charge reduces the average annual
return to 6.5%. Suppose that B is an actively managed fund with a front-end charge of 6% and
an annual management fee of 1.5%. Such a fund would also experience transaction costs from
share dealing.If half the fund is traded each year at an average bid-offer spread of 1%,annual costs
would increase by a further 0.5% to a total of 2%.An investor in B would ﬁnd that only £940
is invested and that average annual returns, net of costs, are 5%.Table 9.1 shows the expected
value of the two funds over various time periods. (The transaction costs of the actively managed
fund are likely to be even higher than 0.5% p.a. since brokerage fees and taxes (stamp duty)
need to be added.)

Another way of looking at the effects of fund charges is to consider the situation of an investor
who is holding an investment for the purpose of providing an income (for example to supplement
a pension).Consider the holder of a ﬁxed-income (i.e.bond) unit trust.If the bond portfolio held
by the unit trust yields 5% p.a.and fund charges are 1.25% p.a.,the investor loses a quarter of the
income to fund charges. It would be worth considering the possibility of holding bonds directly.
This possibility may be attractive in the light of the lower risk-reduction beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation
in the case of bonds (particularly government bonds) when compared to shares.Besides government
bonds can be bought in relatively small quantities quite cheaply through post ofﬁces (in the UK).
Reichenstein (1999) examined bond fund returns in the United States for the period 1994–98
and found a strong inverse relationship between expenses and net returns. Low cost funds
consistently ranked among the best over the ﬁve-year period.The negative relationship between
expenses and net returns was virtually one-to-one,suggesting that investors obtained no beneﬁts
from the payment of high charges.Any increment in expenses was at the cost of reduced net returns
for investors.

EXERCISE 9.8
You are considering an investment of £10,000 in a mutual fund for the purpose of adding to your
retirement income.You expect to retire 40 years from now.You are choosing between an index
tracker fund and an actively managed fund.The index tracker fund has no initial charge,an annual
management charge of 0.5% of the value of the fund, and other costs (including brokerage fees)
amount to 0.3% p.a.The actively managed fund has an initial charge of 5% of the value of the
investment, an annual management charge of 1.5% of the value of the fund, and other costs
(including brokerage fees) amount to 1.1% p.a. of the value of the fund.You have read that over
the long term the average real rate of return on a balanced portfolio of shares has been 6% p.a.
You expect that performance to continue for the next ten years.On the assumption that the funds
match the general market performance:
(a) What is the annual total expense ratio (inclusive of brokerage fees) in each case?
(b) What do you expect the value of the index tracker fund to be after 10 years?
(c) What are the effects of expenses on the expected average annual return of the tracker fund?
(d) What do you expect the value of the actively managed fund to be after 10 years?
(e) What are the effects of expenses on the average annual return of the actively managed fund?
(f) What would be the effects of charges on the expected average annual returns of each fund if
the investment horizon were ﬁve years rather than ten years?

Answers
(a) The annual total expense ratio for the tracker fund is 0.5%  0.3%  0.8%.For the actively
managed fund it is 1.5%  1.1%  2.6%.
(b) The expected real rate of return on the index tracker fund, net of expenses, is 6%  0.8%
 5.2% p.a.The expected value of a £10,000 investment after ten years is:
£10,000  (1.052)10  £16,601.89
(c) Expenses reduce the expected annual return on the tracker fund from 6% to 5.2%.There is
a reduction in yield (RIY) of 6%  5.2%  0.8% p.a.
(d) The expected real rate of return on the actively managed fund,net of management charges and
share dealing costs,is 6% 2.6% 3.4% p.a.Net of the initial charge the investment amounts
to £9,500 (95% of £10,000).The expected value of the investment after ten years is:
£9,500  (1.034)10  £13,271.78
(e) The expected average annual return on the actively managed fund is:
(13,271.78/10,000)0.1 1  0.0287 i.e. 2.87%
The effect of expenses is to reduce the expected average annual return from 6% to 2.87%.
The reduction in yield (RIY) is 6%  2.87%  3.13% p.a.
(f) If the investment horizon were ﬁve years,the expected average annual return from the index
tracker fund would still be 5.2%.
The expected value of the actively managed fund after ﬁve years would be:
£9,500  (1.034)5  £11,228.62
The average annual rate of return would be:
(£11,228.62/£10,000)0.2  1  0.0234 i.e. 2.34%
The effect of expenses is to reduce the expected average annual return from 6% to 2.34%.
The reduction in yield (RIY) is 6%  2.34%  3.66% p.a.The reduction is greater than in
the case of the ten-year investment horizon because the initial charge of 5% is spread over a
smaller number of years.
NBThe RIY ﬁgures quoted by fund managers do not take account of share dealing costs
such as brokerage fees and taxes. It is possible for brokerage costs to exceed 1% of the value
of the fund per year.In the UK there is a 0.5% tax (known as stamp duty) on share purchases.
This tax raises share dealing costs.
EXERCISE 9.9
Suppose that it is observed that the long-term real rate of return on the stock market, net of tax,
has been 6% p.a. and an investor believes that the return will be the same in the future. If the
investor invests £1,000 in an OEIC fund with a view to leaving the money invested for 40 years,
MUTUAL FUNDS
181

allowing net dividends to be reinvested,what would be the expected future value of the investment
if it were invested:
(a) In an actively managed fund with an initial charge of 5%,an annual management fee of 1.5%
of the value of the fund, other annual charges of 0.2%, and annual stockbroking fees of 1%.
(b) In an index tracker fund with no initial charge,an annual management fee of 0.1% of the value
of the fund, other annual charges of 0.2%, and annual stockbroking fees of 0.1%.
Assume that the expected annual return, before charges, is the same for both funds.
(c) Is this a reasonable assumption?
(d) A fund of funds is a portfolio of OEICs/unit trusts. The fund manager buys and sells
OEICs/unit trusts in an attempt to be invested in the most successful funds at any time.An
additional management fee is charged by the manager of the fund of funds. If the manager of
the fund of funds charges 1.5% p.a.,and the charges of the component funds are as indicated
in (a) above, what would be the expected future value of £1,000 invested for 40 years if the
manager of the fund of funds does not,on average,identify the most successful funds? (Assume
that the initial charge is paid only when the ﬁrst investment is made,and is not repeated each
time that funds are switched.)
Answers
(a) The initial charge of 5% would reduce the sum invested to £1,000  (1  0.05)  £950.
The total annual cost of operating the fund is 1.5  0.2  1  2.7% of the value of the fund.
This reduces the expected real return to 6  2.7  3.3% p.a.The expected future value of
the investment would thus be:
£950  (1.033)40  £3,481.26
(b) The full £1,000 would be invested.The total annual cost of operating the fund is 0.1  0.2
 0.1  0.4% of the value of the fund.This reduces the expected real return to 6  0.4 
5.6% p.a.The expected future value of the investment would be:
£1,000  (1.056)40  £8,842.13
(c) The assumption that the expected annual return, before charges, is the same for both funds
is reasonable if it were the case that the actively managed fund fails to produce consistent
outperformance of the stock market. If the active fund management were to succeed in
enhancing returns by more than an average of 2.7  0.4  2.3% p.a., the actively managed
fund would prove to be superior to the index tracker fund.The efﬁcient market hypothesis
suggests that actively managed funds will not consistently beat the stock market,even before
charges are considered.The empirical evidence suggests that any average outperformance
from actively managed funds is unlikely to exceed the effect of fund charges.
(d) The expected real return in (a) is further reduced to 3.3  1.5  1.8% p.a.The expected
future value of the investment would thus be:
£950  (1.018)40  £1,939.25

A fund of funds is a unit trust, OEIC, or investment trust that invests in other collective
investments, for example a unit trust that invests in other unit trusts and OEICs. It should be
borne in mind that whilst the investor in a fund of funds gains from two layers of fund management
if the fund management is successful, underperformance could be compounded if the fund
management were poor.Two layers of charges would be payable. Charges are payable to the
manager of the fund of funds and to the managers of the funds held within the fund of funds. So
the total amount of charges may be high. Exhibit 9.2 provides an example of a fund of funds.

The portfolio is normally limited to shares of investment trust companies. These shares provide
a wide spread of investment in the UK and overseas stockmarkets and are often available at
substantial discounts in relation to underlying asset values. Income is not a major factor, and the
yield can be expected to be slightly less than the average for investment trust companies.

Charges, Commission, and Factory Gate Pricing
One factor that increases the level of charges is the payment of commission to the ﬁnancial adviser
who recommends the investment product to a customer.The adviser would receive a percentage
of the money invested; in the case of a unit trust this might be 3%.This percentage is part of the
initial charge on purchases.There is often a trail commission, which is a sum paid to the adviser
each year that the investment is held by the customer.This might be 0.5% of the value of the
investment,and is part of the annual charge on the fund.Paying advisers by means of commission
is very controversial, and leads to the suspicion that advisers often recommend investments that
pay high commissions rather than investments that are best for the customer.
The controversial nature of commission-based advice was highlighted by the House of Commons
Treasury Committee (2004):
In the Committee’s view it seems likely that as long as most of the selling activity in the
long-term savings industry is rewarded on a commission basis, many savers may remain
suspicious that they are being sold a product for the wrong reasons. Shifting away from
the current commission-based sales system common in much of the industry is likely to
be a key component of any strategy to rebuild consumer conﬁdence in the industry after
the long catalogue of mis-selling scandals in recent years.
For IFAs to receive trail commission whether or not they are providing any real on-
going advice to the client is unacceptable.The persistence of this practice is a clear sign
that the market for ﬁnancial advice is not working in the best interests of consumers.
An alternative to paying for ﬁnancial advice indirectly via fund charges (and thereby commission)
is for the customer to pay the adviser directly by means of a fee.An irony is that commission-based
advisers often advertise their advice as being ‘free’, despite the fact that indirect payment by the
customer via fund charges is often more expensive than paying a fee to the adviser.
Harris (2007) cited an opinion poll,which indicated that only one-third of consumers of ﬁnancial
products believed personal ﬁnancial advisers to be trustworthy.This was accompanied by a report
of the view that the fact that producers of ﬁnancial products (ﬁnancial institutions) pay ﬁnancial
advisers to sell those products (via commission) creates problems concerning the way consumers
(clients) view ﬁnancial advisers.Harris suggested a ‘factory gate pricing’approach to the payment
of advisers (the suggestion was made in relation to investment bonds, but is applicable to other
ﬁnancial products such as unit trusts and OEICs). Factory gate pricing by the producer would
entail an annual management charge (and possibly an initial charge) but would not incorporate any
element of cost to cover payments to advisers. Payment would be directly from consumer to
adviser,and not from producer to adviser.Payments would be agreed between the adviser and the
consumer.
The payment could take one or more of a number of forms such as a percentage of the sum
invested being paid to the ﬁnancial adviser (equivalent to initial commission), an annual charge
payable to the adviser (equivalent to trail commission), or a single payment speciﬁed in money
terms (which may be related to the number of hours of work carried out by the adviser).
This factory gate pricing approach should make the charging structure more transparent to
the consumers of ﬁnancial products. It might also make advisers more likely to recommend
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
184

products that do not pay commission, such as investment trusts and money market investments.
Such a broadening of the range of constituent investments could result in the recommended
portfolio being more closely tailored to the needs of the consumer.However so long as commission-
based advisers continue to promote their services as free, the less sophisticated consumers are
likely to choose them in preference to advisers who are transparent about their charges.
Are Investors Deterred by High Charges?
For most goods and services consumers prefer to pay low prices.The question arises as to whether
this is also the case for mutual funds.Do retail investors prefer to invest in funds with low charges?
It may be the case that retail investors do not appreciate the impact of charges on the long-term
performance of mutual funds.
Barber et al. (2005) investigated this issue in the United States.They found that investors were
deterred by initial charges (front-end loads) but not by high annual charges.They found that initial
charges were associated with lower demand, particularly from experienced investors. However
investors, even experienced investors, appeared to be unaffected by the level of annual charges.
This implies that mutual fund managers are able to raise annual charges without adversely affecting
the sales of their funds.
This may help to explain the increase in annual charges over time.Bogle (2005) reported that,
in the United States, the six decades after 1945 experienced nearly a doubling of charges as a
proportion of the value of funds. This is despite strong economies of scale in mutual fund
management as found by Latzko (1999).
Latzko took the view that mutual fund charges could be divided into three major categories.
There are fees paid to investment managers.These fees normally rise less than proportionately to
the increase in fund size.The second category is administrative expense,which can also be expected
to rise less than proportionately to the size of the fund.The third category is the cost of marketing,
which need not rise in proportion to the size of funds under management. Latzko found that the
cost of operating mutual funds rose at a slower rate than the size of the funds.
The implication seems to be that retail investors do not appreciate the impact of fund charges
on investment performance.In consequence retail investors are prepared to pay high charges,and
the mutual fund industry has taken advantage by raising charges.Barber et al. (2005) took the view
that investors undergo a learning process.Although many have learned to avoid initial charges,few
have learned to avoid high annual charges (which can be avoided by investing in low cost index
tracker funds).
EFFECTS OF TAXATION ON INVESTMENT RETURNS
Taxation has a considerable effect on the returns to an investment.Table 9.2 illustrates the outcome
of a lump-sum investment of £1,000 over investment horizons of 10 years,20 years,and 30 years.
It is assumed that the value of the investment grows at an average of 8% p.a.
The ﬁrst row shows the outcome of an investment that is tax deductible and accumulates tax-
free. If the investment is tax deductible then the sum actually invested, as the result of an outlay
of £1,000,is £1,000/0.6  £1,667.(If an investment of £1,667 could be deducted from income
for tax purposes, a 40% taxpayer would enjoy a £667 reduction in income tax liability. So the
MUTUAL FUNDS
185

investment, net of tax relief, would cost £1,000.) The sums of money shown are the values of the
investment at the end of the respective periods.The percentages in parentheses show the (average
compound per annum) rates of return.
The second row shows the outcome of an investment that is not tax deductible but which
is allowed to accumulate free of tax.The third row shows the results of an investment that is
free of tax during the life of the investment but which is subject to tax at 24% on investment
returns when the investment is liquidated.The fourth row is similar to the third row except
that the tax rate is 40%.The ﬁfth row shows the outcomes when the investment returns are taxed
each year.
It can be seen that the tax treatment makes a considerable difference.For example the 30-year
outcome with the most favourable tax treatment is more than four times the outcome with the
least favourable treatment. In the UK pension funds are highly favoured investments, in terms of
tax treatment.Pension contributions are tax deductible,pension funds are free of capital gains tax,
interest and bond coupon receipts are tax free, and dividends from shares receive favourable tax
treatment (from the perspective of payers of the 40% tax rate).
Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) and Personal Equity Plans (PEPs), whilst not being tax
deductible, do receive favourable tax treatment. Such investments are free of capital gains tax,
interest and bond coupons are tax-free,and dividends from shares receive favourable tax treatment
(from the perspective of payers of the 40% tax rate).
In the UK capital gains tax is payable only when investments are sold,in other words the tax is
deferred. Furthermore the rate of capital gains tax is lower than the rate of income tax (24% as
against 40% if the investment is held for ten years or more). So investments that provide returns
in the form of capital gains are more favourably treated than investments whose returns are in the
form of periodic payments such as interest, coupons, or dividends.This means that shares are
treated more favourably than bonds and bank (and building society) deposits since shares produce
more of their return in the form of capital gains.
These conclusions are applicable to payers of the standard rate of tax as well as to those
who pay the higher (40%) rate.The relative advantage of shares is further reinforced by the fact
that the ﬁrst £9,200 (the ﬁgure at the time of writing) of capital gains in any ﬁnancial year is free
of tax.

the value of a £1,000 investment after 25 years when the returns are (a) tax-free, (b) subject to a
deferred tax (i.e.taxed at the end of the 25 years) of 20%,and (c) subject to an annual tax of 20%.

(b) {(£6,098  £1,000)  0.8}  £1,000  £5,078
(The investor retains 80% of the accumulated return plus the initial investment of £1,000.)
(c) £1,000  (1.06)25  £4,292
(The annual tax of 20% turns a 7.5% p.a. return into a 6% p.a. return since 0.8  7.5  6,
and 0.8 is the portion that the investor retains after tax.)
EXERCISE 9.11
Suppose that an investor anticipates an (annual) income tax rate of 40%, and a (deferred) capital
gains tax rate of 20%.What would be the ﬁnal value of an investment of £1,000 for ten years under
the following circumstances?
(a) The investment yields an average of 6% p.a. entirely in dividends.
(b) The investment yields an average of 6% p.a. entirely in price rises.
Answers
(a) The yield after income tax is 6  (1  0.4)%  3.6% p.a.
(1.036)10  1.42429
1.42429  £1,000  £1,424.29
(b) The value of the investment, after ten years, before tax is deducted is:
(1.06)10  £1,000  1.79085  £1,000  £1,790.85
The capital gains tax to be paid is:
£790.85  0.2  £158.17
The investment, after capital gains tax, amounts to:
£1,790.85  £158.17  £1,632.68
It is to be noted that although the investment of part (b) yields the same pre-tax total return
as that of part (a),it provides the higher post-tax value at the end of ten years.That is because
the return in the case of (b) is in the form of capital gains, which are relatively lightly taxed.

EXERCISE 9.12
You have £5,000 to invest for a period of 40 years.The chosen investment fund has a prospective
yield of 6% p.a., of which 3% p.a. is from dividends and 3% p.a. from capital gains. If the
government introduces a tax-advantaged investment scheme with 20% income tax and no capital
gains tax, what would you expect the value of the fund to be after 40 years?
Answer
After income tax at 20%, the rate of dividend yield is 3  (1  0.2)  2.4% p.a.The total rate
of return is therefore 3  2.4  5.4% p.a.The value of the investment after 40 years is:
£5,000  (1.054)40  £5,000  8.196424  £40,982.12
INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS
ISAs were introduced in the 1999 Finance Act and are due to have unlimited lives.They provide
tax-advantaged investments.As of 6 April 2008,up to £3,600 per year could be invested in a cash
ISA with a bank, building society, or other deposit taker.The interest on the cash is tax-free and
the money can be withdrawn at any time without loss of the tax relief (although if the money is
withdrawn subsequent to the ﬁnancial year in which the investment was made, it cannot be
reinvested in that year’s ISA).
Up to £7,200 (minus any amount invested in a cash ISA) could be invested in a stocks and shares
ISA.The investment could be in the form of collective investments such as unit trusts,investment
trusts, open-ended investment companies (OEICs), and life assurance funds. Alternatively (or
additionally) the investment could be in direct holdings of shares or bonds.
Stocks and shares ISA investments are free of capital gains tax and bond coupons are free of
income tax. Investors receive a tax credit on bond coupons.At the time of writing UK investors
in bonds are treated as having paid a 20% tax on bond coupons and this implied tax is reclaimable,
by the ISA manager,from the Inland Revenue.The reclaimed tax is paid to the ISA investors in the
form of tax credits added to their ISA accounts. In the case of equity investments (either direct
shareholdings or collective investments in shares) no tax is payable on dividends but there is no
tax credit to be reclaimed. Higher-rate taxpayers avoid the additional tax on dividends that arises
from being higher-rate taxpayers, but there is no income tax advantage for basic-rate taxpayers.
Cash ISAs,and stocks and shares ISAs,can either be with two different providers (the providers
include banks, building societies, insurance companies, and investment companies) or with the
same provider.There is a facility to switch from a cash ISA to a stocks and shares ISA, but not in
the opposite direction.Investments can be withdrawn at any time without loss of the tax advantages.
An investor may choose different providers for ISAs in successive years.
CAT-marking
‘CAT’ stands for Charges,Access, and Terms. CAT standard investments must have low charges,
provide easy access, and be subject to fair terms. ISAs that bear the CAT label must abide by a set
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
188

of rules. In the case of stocks and shares ISAs there should be a maximum annual management
charge of 1% (in the case of life assurance funds this is 3%),regular saving must be possible at £50
per month (£25 for life assurance funds), and lump-sum investments of £500 allowed (£250 for
life assurance funds).In the case of cash ISAs,the CAT label implies easy withdrawal of small sums
at short notice.
Interest rates on cash ISAs are also required to follow changes in market interest rates without
signiﬁcant delay. Stakeholder savings plans and Child Trust Funds can be held in an ISA and they
replicate CAT standards (although management charges can be up to 1.5% p.a.).
Self-select ISAs
Self-select ISAs offer high flexibility. Instead of choosing between funds offered by a single
investment manager,the holder of a self-select ISA can hold funds from several different investment
managers. Self-select ISAs also provide the facility of investing directly in shares and bonds. Self-
select ISAs are sold by stockbrokers and by ﬁrms of ﬁnancial advisers.There will be charges to be
paid to the plan operator (charges that are additional to those of the funds held within the ISA)
whereas holding ISAs operated by individual investment managers (packaged ISAs) usually avoids
the additional layer of charges.
It is possible to take out a self-select ISA with a discretionary service.With a discretionary
service the stockbroker (or ﬁnancial adviser) takes the investment decisions.With an advisory
service the investor receives advice from the stockbroker but the investor takes the decisions.With
an execution-only service the investor takes the decisions and the stockbroker merely follows the
investor’s instructions.
Fund Supermarkets
Fund supermarkets allow an investor to invest across a range of investment managers within a
single ISA. It is also possible to operate through a fund supermarket when investing in collective
investments outside an ISA.A fund supermarket is a form of wrap account.
Wrap accounts are online platforms that allow investors to see their full range of investments
in one place.They also provide valuations of the investment totals.Liabilities may also be included.
A fund supermarket can be seen as a wrap account that is limited to collective investments.Those
collective investments could be inside ISAs,inside pension plans,or outside both and could include
unit trusts, OEICs, investment trusts, life assurance funds (investment bonds), and exchange-
traded funds.
VENTURE CAPITAL TRUSTS AND ENTERPRISE INVESTMENT SCHEMES
VCTs and EISs are UK schemes that encourage investment in small companies.The encouragement
is through the provision of tax breaks.At the time of writing, venture capital trusts (VCTs) had
been the more successful in attracting investors.
Venture capital trusts are similar to investment trusts. A VCT holds a portfolio of shares of
unquoted companies and/or companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM),which
is the junior stock exchange in the UK.These companies are new and/or small enterprises that
are too new and/or too small to have their shares listed on the main stock exchange (that is to have
their shares traded on the main stock exchange).Since April 2006 the maximum size of a company
MUTUAL FUNDS
189

that qualiﬁes for VCT funding has been £7 million of gross assets (previously it was £15 million).
The VCT has a stock exchange listing and is professionally managed by a fund manager.
Like investment trusts,the market value of a VCT usually differs from the sum of the values of
its investments in companies.VCTs often trade at a discount to their net asset values. Since the
market for VCTs tends to be illiquid,sales of VCTs are likely to involve large discounts to underlying
value.The fact that the tax breaks apply only to investment in new issues, and not to the purchase
of existing VCTs, also makes large discounts likely.
Investments in a VCT attract tax relief at 20% up to the investment ceiling of £100,000 per year.
Investments are also free of income tax and capital gains tax.All dividends from a VCT are free
from income tax. No capital gains tax is payable on gains made on the sale of VCT shares.VCTs
can distribute realised capital gains tax-free as enhanced dividends.These tax breaks are subject to
minimum holding periods (which can be as low as three years).A further tax concession relates
to the facility of sheltering capital gains from other sources. Capital gains from other sources are
sheltered from tax if they are invested in a VCT.The capital gains tax is not payable until the VCT
investment is sold.
The tax advantages of VCTs tend to be variable.For example for a two-year period,2004–6,the
tax rules were changed.The tax relief was raised to 40% for most investors.The investment ceiling
for these tax breaks was raised from £100,000 to £200,000 per year.However the facility of sheltering
capital gains from other sources was removed.For the 2006–7 tax year the maximum tax relief was
lowered to 30%,but otherwise the tax rules were the same as those for the 2004–6 period.
Venture capital investment in a company is usually for a limited period,typically ﬁve to ten years.
The investment is often accompanied by the provision of some managerial expertise.The company
(VCT) that provides the capital looks towards making a capital gain from selling its stake in the
enterprise to another investor (possibly through a takeover) or from selling shares following a
stock market ﬂotation.Venture capitalists also fund MBOs (Management Buy-Outs).MBOs entail
the purchase of a company by its existing management.
Enterprise investment schemes (EISs) involve the investment being made in a single unquoted
company rather than a portfolio of companies.Unlike VCTs,EIS investments do not have an upper
limit to the annual investment. However only the ﬁrst £200,000 per year attracts the tax
concessions of 20% relief plus freedom from capital gains tax.The whole of the investment can be
used to shelter capital gains from other sources. Capital gains from other sources are not taxable
until the EIS investment is sold.The EIS tax concessions may also be applicable to investments in
AIM (Alternative Investment Market) quoted companies, where shares are being issued to raise
capital for investment.EIS investments are likely to be less liquid than VCTs since EISs are not stock
exchange listed and hence cannot be sold through a stock exchange.
POUND COST AVERAGING
Pound cost averaging refers to an advantage of buying unit trusts (or other institutional investments)
on a regular basis. More units are bought at low prices than at high prices so that the average
purchase price is less than the average price of units.
Suppose that a monthly investment of £150 is made for three months during which the price
per unit is 75p for one month,100p for one month,and 125p for one month.(So the average price
is [75  100  125]/3  100p.)
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
190

When the price is 75p, 150/0.75  200 units are bought.At 100p, 150/1  150 units are
acquired.At 125p, 120 are received.The total is 470 units.
If the whole £450 were spent on units at the average price of 100p,450 units would be acquired.
Monthly investing led to 20 more units.
An additional advantage of investing on a periodic basis, rather than investing the whole sum
at a single point in time,is that there is some time diversiﬁcation.When investing at a single point
in time there is a risk that the shares or units would be bought at their highest price.Although it
may be that the purchase occurs at the lowest price, it is impossible to know when prices are low
until after the event. Single lump-sum investments bear the risk that purchases are made at high
prices. By investing on a periodic basis, ups and downs are smoothed out with the result that the
average purchase price avoids the extreme values. In other words, risk is reduced by time
diversiﬁcation (in the sense of diversiﬁcation of the timing of investments).
When compared with investing an initial lump sum,the gain from pound cost averaging has to
be weighed against the returns from the unit trust over the relevant period. Monthly investment
involves a delay in investing that entails foregoing some of the returns from the units. However
lump-sum investing bears the risk that the investment is made when prices are high.The chapters
dealing with behavioural ﬁnance,in particular 2 and 24,indicate that investors often buy after the
market has risen. Emotional factors and psychological biases tend to cause people to invest when
prices are high. Pound cost averaging takes the emotion and adverse psychology out of the
investment process.
EXERCISE 9.13
The prices of a unit trust at the end of each of 12 successive months are:
50p, 40p, 50p, 60p, 50p, 70p, 65p, 80p, 75p, 60p, 80p, and 100p.
How does a regular monthly investment of £100 compare with investing the whole £1,200 at the
average unit price (in terms of the value of the investment at the end of the twelve months)?
Answer
The average unit price is 65p. Spending £1,200 at 65p buys 1200/0.65  1846.15 units, which
are worth £1846.15 at the end of the year.
Spending £100 per month acquires:
100/0.5  100/0.4  100/0.5  100/0.6  100/0.5  100/0.7  100/0.65  100/0.8

EXERCISE 9.14
The prices of shares in an OEIC at the end of six successive months were:
125p, 100p, 150p, 75p, 125p, and 175p
(a) What was the average (end of month) price of the shares?
(b) How many shares could be bought with £1,500 at the average price?
(c) What would the resulting shareholding be worth at the end of the six-month period?
Suppose that an investor spread the £1,500 investment evenly over the six months in order
to beneﬁt from pound cost averaging (investing £250 at the end of each month):
(d) How many shares were bought?
(e) What was the average price of the shares bought?
(f) What was the value of the resulting shareholding at the end of the six-month period?
(g) Comment on the results.
Answers
(a) (125  100  150  75  125  175) / 6  125p
(b) £1,500 / £1.25  1200 shares.
(c) 1200  £1.75  £2,100.
(d) £250/£1.25  £250/£1  £250/£1.50  £250/£0.75  £250/£1.25  £250/£1.75
 200  250  166.67  333.33  200  142.86  1292.86 shares.
(e) The average price of the shares bought through monthly investment is £1,500/1292.86
 116p.
(f) 1292.86  £1.75  £2,262.51.
(g) As a result of the pound cost averaging,more shares are bought at low prices than at high prices.
In consequence the average purchase price of the shares is less than the average (end of month)
price: 116p as opposed to 125p. Correspondingly the number of shares bought through
monthly investment is greater than the number that could have been bought at the average
price: 1292.86 as opposed to 1200.
Investing all the money at the lowest price would be ideal, but it is not possible to know
the lowest price until the end of the investment period (by which time the opportunity to buy
at the lowest price has gone).
An advantage of spreading the investment over time is that there would be a tendency for
low prices to offset high prices thereby removing the risk that the whole investment is made
at a high price (this is time diversiﬁcation).

DILUTION LEVIES, DILUTION ADJUSTMENTS,
AND FAIR VALUE PRICING
Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) have a single published price.In principle buyers and
sellers face the same price (unlike unit trusts in which the buying price is higher than the selling
price). However the underlying securities (typically company shares) do not have single prices.
The price of the OEIC is based on the mid-prices of the shares held in the fund.The mid-prices lie
halfway between the offer and bid prices,which are the prices at which shares are bought and sold
respectively.The effect of the single pricing of OEICs is that buyers of OEICs pay less than the true
cost of the shares,and sellers of OEICs receive more than the actual receipts from the sale of shares
held by the fund.This beneﬁts investors who buy and sell frequently (holding the OEICs for short
periods) at the expense of long-term investors.
The subsidy for short-term investors becomes greater when other transaction costs are
considered.Buying and selling the shares held by the fund entails brokerage fees.These fees increase
the effective cost of buying, and reduce the receipts from selling. If OEIC investors face a single
price for buying and selling,they do not pay the brokerage costs.Those who buy and sell frequently
receive free brokerage at the expense of the value of the fund, and hence at the expense of long-
term investors.The effect is increased where taxes are payable on share transactions (such as the
0.5% stamp duty payable on share purchases in the UK).
The negative effect of single pricing on the value of the fund (arising from bid-offer spreads,
brokerage costs,and taxation) is known as dilution.To overcome the cross-subsidy,between long-
term and short-term investors, management companies may impose dilution levies or dilution
adjustments.A dilution levy is a charge imposed on a buyer or seller of an OEIC for the purpose
of covering the difference between the price of the OEIC and the actual net value of the transactions
in the shares traded by the fund. A dilution adjustment is similar to a dilution levy, with the
difference that the price of the OEIC is adjusted. If purchases of OEICs by investors exceed sales
(redemptions),the price may be adjusted upwards to reﬂect the true net cost of buying shares for
the fund. If sales of OEICs by investors exceed purchases, the price may be adjusted downwards
in order to reﬂect the real net receipts from the sale of shares by the fund.This is sometimes known
as swinging single pricing.A typical dilution adjustment may be / 0.30%.However in the cases
of OEICs that deal in investments with high bid-offer spreads the adjustment may be much higher.
For example a smaller companies fund could experience a dilution adjustment of / 1%.One
result is that OEIC prices can ﬂuctuate even when stock prices are stable.
Chapman (2006a) points out that dilution levies and dilution adjustments are little used by
OEIC managers in the UK. It is frequently the case that several months, and in some cases more
than a year, pass between occasions on which a levy or adjustment is imposed.The application of
levies or adjustments is typically reserved for days on which net sales or purchases are particularly
large,or when an exceptionally large single transaction is made.However dealing costs are incurred
continuously; and those costs are borne by long-term investors. Chapman cites the Financial
Services Authority as suggesting that the average annual dilution cost is 0.19% of fund value but
he expresses the view that dilution could be much greater,and estimates that in some cases annual
dilution costs could exceed 0.6%. Over long periods of time these dilution costs would have a
substantial impact on the values of the investments of long-term investors. Forcing long-term
investors to pay the trading costs of short-term investors can be very detrimental to the former.
MUTUAL FUNDS
193

It would also be disadvantageous to the marketing efforts of the fund manager to the extent that
marketing makes use of experienced long-term returns.
One way of dealing with the issue is to use dual pricing,so that there is a higher price for buying
the OEIC than for selling.The difference could incorporate the transaction costs. In that way
investors who frequently move into, and out of, OEICs pay the transaction costs instead of those
costs falling on investors who remain invested for long periods. Another possibility is to use a
futures fund (stock index futures combined with bank deposits;see Part 8 on stock index futures)
as part of the total fund.As short-term investors buy and sell OEICs, the resulting cash ﬂows are
matched by purchases and sales of futures contracts.The transaction costs of dealing in futures are
much lower than the costs of dealing in shares.
Fair value pricing may be applied to both OEICs and unit trusts. It becomes necessary when
market prices are stale (out of date).Published share prices are the prices at which the shares were
last traded.In the cases of the shares of small companies there may be long periods between share
deals. It may be several hours, days, or even weeks since the shares in a particular company were
last traded.In consequence the published share price may be very different from the price at which
the shares would trade in the present.When valuing OEICs (or unit trusts) it may be inappropriate
to use published share prices when those prices are stale.Investors in OEICs and unit trusts would
be paying and receiving prices that are poorly related to the true values of the shares held by the
funds.When the companies whose shares are held by the fund experience infrequent trading in
their shares, investment management companies may adjust the prices of the shares held in an
attempt to more accurately reﬂect the prices at which the shares would trade currently.The share
prices used as a basis for valuing OEICs and unit trusts are the prices that the fund managers believe
would prevail in the light of current market conditions.
MUTUAL FUNDS AND THE PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY
Mutual funds provide investors with liquidity since it is easy to acquire, and dispose of, portfolios
of shares by means of buying and selling mutual funds. If investors were to create or liquidate
portfolios directly, they would be involved in high costs in terms of time, effort, and money. By
using mutual funds they avoid the expenditure of time and effort.In the case of index tracking funds,
where initial charges are usually zero, they also avoid the ﬁnancial costs. In the case of investment
trusts,the ﬁnancial costs are greatly reduced since only one purchase or sale transaction is involved.
However there are costs to the mutual funds of providing such liquidity.These costs arise from
fund managers being forced to trade in shares when their retail investors choose to buy or sell,
rather than when the fund managers would choose to trade.Since investment trusts (closed-ended
funds) are not affected by retail trades in this way they do not bear these costs.
Retail investors tend to buy into mutual funds (e.g. buying units in a unit trust) when markets
are rising and sell when markets are falling.The immediate effect of retail investment is an addition
to the cash held in the fund,and the immediate effect of retail sales is a reduction of the cash held.
A result of this is that mutual fund managers have a relatively large proportion of their funds in
cash during rising markets (just when the funds should have a relatively large proportion in shares)
and a low proportion in cash during falling markets (when a high proportion in cash would be
preferable).Even during stable markets the transactions of retail investors will force fund managers
into trades that they would otherwise not choose to make.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
194

In these ways the provision of liquidity, by mutual funds, to retail investors can adversely
impact on the performance of the funds. This would suggest a case for initial and/or exit
(withdrawal) charges that are payable into the fund. In this way frequent transactors in unit trust
units, or OEIC shares, would compensate long-term investors for their negative impact on fund
performance.This could be seen as payment, by frequent transactors, for the liquidity provided
by the funds.
EXERCISE 9.15
An OEIC keeps 5% of its fund in bank deposits in order to meet potential redemptions.If the real
rate of return on the stock market as a whole is 7% p.a.whilst the real interest rate on bank deposits
is 2% p.a., what is the effect of this liquidity provision on the rate of return of the fund?
Answer
The expected real rate of return on the fund is reduced from 7% p.a. to:
(0.95  7%)  (0.05  2%)  6.75% p.a.
The provision of liquidity has reduced average real return from 7% p.a. to 6.75% p.a.
EXERCISE 9.16
An OEIC keeps an average of 5% of its fund in bank deposits in order to meet redemptions of shares
(i.e.to provide liquidity for investors).When the market rises,increased demand for its shares leads
to a net cash inﬂow and the bank deposits held increase to 10% of the fund.When the stock market
falls, net sales of shares reduce the holding of bank deposits to 0% of the fund. During periods of
market rise the real return on the (non-cash) portfolio is 17% p.a. During periods of market
weakness the real return is 3% p.a.Bank deposits yield a real return of 2% p.a.Periods of market
strength,and periods of weakness,occupy equal lengths of time.What is the effect of holding part
of the fund in bank deposits on the average real return of the fund?
Answer
In the absence of bank deposits (no provision for the redemption of shares) the average real
return is:
(0.5  17%)  (0.5  3%)  7% p.a.
In the presence of bank deposits the real return during market strength is:
(0.9  17%)  (0.1  2%)  15.3%  0.2%  15.5% p.a.
During market weakness the real return is 3% p.a. (there are no bank deposits).
MUTUAL FUNDS
195

So in the presence of bank deposits (during periods of market strength) the average real 
return is:
(0.5  15.5%)  (0.5  3%)  6.25% p.a.
The provision of liquidity in a volatile market reduces the average real return from 7% p.a. to
6.25% p.a.
It might be noted that index tracker funds maintain 100% exposure to the stock market rather
than holding part of the fund in deposits.Index tracker funds thereby avoid the reduction in returns
arising from the holding of bank deposits (or other money market investments).
EVIDENCE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF MUTUAL FUNDS
There have been numerous studies of the performance of mutual funds.Performance is measured
in terms of total return,that is dividend yield plus capital gains.Generally these studies have found
that (1) on average funds underperform stock indices,(2) past relative performance is not a good
guide to future relative performance, and (3) funds with low charges and low portfolio turnover
tend to outperform those with high charges and high turnovers.
A number of studies have found that mutual funds produce higher returns than indices before
charges and costs are considered, but underperform indices after allowance is made for such
expenses (for example Shukla 2004;Wermers 2000; Daniel et al. 1997). Although on average
mutual funds appear not to outperform stock indices,some funds will provide better returns than
indices.The question arises as to whether some funds persistently provide superior returns.
Although a few studies have suggested some persistence in relative performance in the short term
(up to three years) there is probably a consensus that there is no long-term persistence in
performance (for example Hendricks et al. 1993; Kahn and Rudd 1995; Jain and Wu 2000). It
appears that past performance is not a useful guide for choosing between mutual funds.Although
the evidence of research studies indicates an absence of long-term persistence in the relative
performance of funds,many investors believe that particular fund managers are persistently good
or bad (and switch funds to follow favoured fund managers when those preferred managers move
on to other funds).There is little research evidence on the effectiveness of this strategy,but Gallo
and Lockwood (1999) found that when poorly performing funds change manager the result is on
average an improvement in performance.
The majority of studies suggest that funds with high expenses tend to provide investors with
lower returns (for example Reichenstein 1999; Indro et al. 1999; Bogle 1998; Carhart 1997).
However,some studies point the other way (for example Shukla 2004).There is also evidence that
high portfolio turnover (and hence high brokerage costs) is associated with lower net returns
(Carhart 1997). Bogle (2002) compared the performance of high cost US mutual funds (top
quartile for annual costs,1.8%) against the performance of low cost mutual funds (bottom quartile,
0.6% p.a.) over 1991–2001 and found that the low cost funds outperformed the high cost funds
by more than the cost differential (by 2.2% p.a.).The low cost funds also exhibited lower risk than
the high cost funds.The strongly performing low cost funds included index tracker funds.The
relative advantage of index tracker funds was further enhanced by the consideration that they
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
196

tended not to have front-end fees (loads) and by the fact that many of the worst performing actively
managed funds had been withdrawn or merged into other funds with the effect that the weakest
funds were removed from the data when the average performance was calculated.
The question arises as to why investors predominantly buy actively managed funds if the
evidence tends to suggest that index tracking funds are likely to perform better.One explanation
comes from behavioural ﬁnance.Investors incorrectly perceive their ability to select funds that will
perform well.Goetzmann and Peles (1997) measured the recollections of investors in relation to
the recent performance of their mutual funds.They investigated two groups of private investors
and found that both groups overestimated the absolute performance,and performance relative to
the market.These overestimates were substantial:both groups overestimated performance relative
to the market by around 5% p.a.It was suggested that memory adjusts in such a way as to improve
the recalled performance. Cognitive dissonance has been suggested as an explanation (Baker and
Nofsinger 2002).If people like to see themselves as wise investors,their memories of investment
performance adjust to conﬁrm their self-image. If reality conﬂicts with self-image, the memory
of reality changes in order to be consistent with the self-image.
Another explanation arises from the inﬂuence of ﬁnancial journalism on investors.Winnett and
Lewis (2000) pointed out that ﬁnancial journalists often promote the idea that it is possible to
identify prospective future outperformers.A theme that runs through much ﬁnancial journalism
is that it is possible to spot winners and to beat the market.There is often a focus on identifying
‘stars’and ‘dogs’from league tables of funds.Financial journalism often implies that relative returns
can be forecast from selective samples of past performance. However, Winnett and Lewis
acknowledged that some deviation from typical ﬁnancial journalism has emerged from
presentations and discussions of index tracker funds.As a result some ﬁnancial journalists are now
willing to discuss the idea that the market cannot be beaten.
An alternative explanation may lie in the fact that many mutual fund investors know little about
the relative performance of actively managed funds. If a ﬁnancial adviser recommends an actively
managed fund, the investor is likely to follow that advice. If ﬁnancial advisers were paid by means
of commission, relative commission levels could affect their memories of relative performance. If
actively managed funds pay more commission to the adviser than index tracker funds,the adviser’s
perception and memory of relative performance may be inﬂuenced. If one’s livelihood is at stake,
one’s perception and recollection of the evidence is likely to be affected by self-interest. It will be
seen from the chapters that deal with behavioural ﬁnance (social and psychological biases in
investment decision-making),in particular Chapters 2 and 24,that no one is immune from bias.The
human mind is not a disinterested computer,and memory is not a mechanical recording of the past.
Financial advisers may have a conﬂict of interests.The investments most suitable for their clients
may not be those that pay the highest commission to the advisers. Fund managers may also face
conﬂicts of interest.Maximising returns for investors in their funds,whilst avoiding unacceptable
risk, might be seen as the only objective. However the fund managers also have a loyalty to the
investment management companies that employ them. Gaspar et al. (2006) investigated the
possibility that loyalty to the employing company could dominate loyalty to the fund investors.In
particular they investigated the possibility of cross-subsidisation between funds managed by the
same company.
There is some evidence of a ‘smart money effect’ in that returns on new cash ﬂows to mutual
funds are higher than the average return for all mutual fund investors.This appears to be evidence
MUTUAL FUNDS
197

supporting the view that investors can identify superior fund managers.However,Sapp and Tiwari
(2005) concluded that the relative outperformance of new money arose from a momentum
effect.There is evidence that over a three- to twelve-month period there is some persistence in
the performance of shares in that good performances continue for a few months, as do bad
performances (see Chapter 23 on weak form market efﬁciency). Sapp and Tiwari concluded that
mutual fund investors invest in funds with recent good performance, and that the momentum
effect causes the relatively good performance to persist for a few months following the investment
of new cash. So the superior returns to new investments were seen to be a result of momentum
rather than the result of identifying good fund managers.
Weigand et al. (2004) presented evidence that mutual fund managers tended to be momentum
traders.It appeared that mutual fund managers often chose stocks on the grounds that those stocks
had recently performed well.Weigand et al. found that this had adverse effects on mutual fund
performance since the momentum effect (continuation of past price rises) soon ceased or reversed.
They recommended that individual investors should not be guided in their choices of stocks by the
choices of mutual fund managers.
Walter and Weber (2006) also found that mutual fund managers had a tendency towards
momentum trading.They also concluded that mutual fund managers were prone to herding,which
entails making the same trading decisions as other managers.To the extent that mutual fund
managers share a tendency towards momentum trading they would all buy following price rises,
and sell following price falls,with the effect that they make the same trading decisions.There may
be other factors that lead to herding, such as the desire to avoid substantial underperformance
relative to other fund managers.One source of risk for the retail investor is the possibility that their
fund manager underperforms relative to the average fund manager;this is known as active risk or
management risk. Copying other fund managers reduces such active risk.
Walter and Weber (2006) found evidence consistent with the view that herding is most
pronounced among successful fund managers.This may be because successful managers want to
preserve earlier relatively strong performance in order to guarantee their bonuses, whereas
unsuccessful ones gamble by deviating from the consensus in the hope of achieving relative
outperformance. It is also consistent with prospect theory, which predicts that gainers act
conservatively (and preserve their gains) whereas losers take risks,which could reverse the losses.
Another factor explaining herding among mutual fund managers may be window dressing.
Managers may ﬁll their portfolios with recently successful stocks at times when they are due to
report their portfolios in order to give the impression that they had selected successful stocks.
It is often the case that an investment management company will have a range (or family) of
different unit trusts or OEICs. For example a family of funds might include UK equity general,
UK equity growth,UK equity income,UK smaller companies,and UK special opportunities funds
together with a range of other funds covering overseas investments and other asset classes.Gaspar
et al. (2006) suggested that the investment management company might regard some funds as high
value. High value funds would include those charging high fees. Also since retail investors are
disproportionately attracted to funds exhibiting recent high performance,particularly when those
funds are new, such funds are likely to be regarded as high value funds by the company. Gaspar et
al. found evidence that investment management companies reallocate performance among funds
within a family so as to favour high value funds. One mechanism appears to entail the trading of
shares between funds at prices favourable to the high value funds.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
198

Dowen and Mann (2004) found that the existence of a large family of funds was advantageous
to the average performance of funds within the family.There appeared to be cost savings when the
same investment management company managed a large number of funds. They also found
economies of scale such that large totals of assets under management were associated with lower
average percentage management costs.The implication is that,on average,individual investors are
better off in large funds, which are members of large fund families.
Star Performers and the Role of Chance
Financial journalists often make play of the idea of star funds that have performed exceptionally
well over a past period. However the laws of probability suggest that a few funds will show
consistently good performance,but purely as a matter of chance.If there is a 50% chance of beating
the average in any year, it is to be expected that a fund has a (0.5)10  0.1% chance of
outperforming the average every year for ten years. So out of 1,000 funds, one can be expected
to outperform every year for ten years,purely as a matter of chance.The corresponding ﬁgure over
ﬁve years is 31 funds [(0.5)5 1000]. Since there are thousands of funds available to investors, it
is not surprising that a few will appear to be star funds with consistently high returns.
When ranking funds on a risk-adjusted basis some will appear to be outstanding performers.
The question arises as to whether such funds should be seen as having superior investment
management. If they do exhibit high-quality fund management, they would be candidates for
purchase.However some funds would show exceptional performance simply as a matter of chance.
Marcus (1990) looked at the performance of the Magellan fund in the United States.That fund had
outperformed the S&P 500 index in 11 out of the 13 years up to 1989, and appeared to be a star
performer. Using computer simulations Marcus found that, in a sample of 500 funds, the
expectation was that there is a 99.8% chance that the best performing fund would beat a stock index
in 11 years or more.
Evidence consistent with the existence of star performers comes from Kosowski et al. (2006).
They employed a distribution of returns that provided a better representation of experienced
returns than the normal distribution.They concluded that there were more top-performing fund
managers than would be expected on the basis of chance.They found that in a sample of 1,788 US
domestic equity mutual funds, 29 met their criterion of superior performance as opposed to the
9 that would have been expected on the basis of pure chance.However they found that the superior
returns apparently resulting from skill mostly occurred before 1990,and were limited to growth
funds (as opposed to income funds).They also found that these apparently superior skills showed
persistence over time,a result also found by Harlow and Brown (2006).Harlow and Brown found
that by identifying causes of persistence in relative performance, it was possible to successfully
identify future high performers with nearly 60% accuracy.
Fund managers have a vested interest in promoting the funds that have shown such high returns,
since the information will attract many new clients.Journalists will also report on such funds since
they provide a degree of sensationalism.A cynic might be tempted to suggest that newspapers may
be more inclined to report on such funds if the fund managers pay for advertisements in those
newspapers.
Arguably publicised strong performance is a very effective form of advertising.Atkinson and
Sturm (2003) examined the selection of ‘all-stars’ by a major US mutual fund advisory service.
MUTUAL FUNDS
199

Describing a mutual fund as an ‘all-star’ appeared to have a positive effect on the ﬂow of money
into the fund;so it proved to be effective advertising.The authors reported no convincing evidence
of post-selection performance that was superior to the market.
CONCLUSION
Mutual funds comprise unit trusts, OEICs, and investment trusts. They are all collective
investments in that they aggregate the investments of a large number of individuals.The sums thus
accumulated are used to buy a portfolio of assets,which has more diversiﬁcation than can normally
be achieved by an individual.
Financial journalists often describe particular mutual funds as stars or dogs. Stars are the top
performers, and dogs are at the bottom (this is easy reporting for the journalists since their
investigations need go no further than published performance tables).This categorisation is always
based on past performance and is typically taken to imply something about the quality of investment
management (and hence prospective future performance). However, investment performance
will vary simply as a matter of chance. It is far from clear that the stars and the dogs reach their
relative positions as a result of anything other than pure chance. In Chapter 17 on evaluating the
performance of fund managers and in Part 7 on market efﬁciency,it will be seen that the evidence
indicates that past performance is a very poor guide to future performance.
In the chapters – 2 and 24 in particular – that deal with behavioural ﬁnance (the social and
psychological biases that inﬂuence investors), it is contended that people are reluctant to accept
that some outcomes are the result of chance. People tend to look for causes, and for patterns in
events,and are prone to see causes and patterns that do not exist.Investors should seek to overcome
this psychological bias, along with the other biases that are common amongst investors.
If it is accepted that good performance is a matter of luck,rather than investment management
skill,the individual investor may be advised to buy an index tracker fund that simply aims to follow
a stock market index. Index tracker funds avoid the costs of active fund management (and hence
have lower charges) and they avoid management risk, which is the risk that a particular fund will
perform relatively badly.Over long periods of time,even small differences in fund charges can make
a large difference to the ﬁnal value of an investment.Taxation can also have a substantial impact on
the long-term outcome of an investment.
The evidence on mutual fund performance tends to be unfavourable to active fund management,
and hence favourable to index tracker funds (the evidence is presented in this chapter and in Part
7 on market efﬁciency and Chapter 17 on evaluating the performance of fund managers).However,
as indicated in Chapters 7 and 13 on stock indices and portfolio diversiﬁcation,respectively,index
tracker funds may not provide the best possible diversiﬁcation. Portfolio diversiﬁcation reduces
portfolio risk since the weak performance of some shares would tend to be offset by strong
performance from others. However stock indices may not represent well-diversiﬁed portfolios.
For example in the UK the largest ten companies represent nearly half the total value of the stock
market, and those companies are concentrated in a small range of sectors.

Mutual funds often use ﬁnancial derivatives (futures,options,and swaps).Although when used
on their own derivatives can be very risky,when used in conjunction with a portfolio of investments
they can reduce risk (as shown in Parts 8,9,and 10 on futures,options,and swaps).Not only can
derivatives reduce risk, but also they can be used to enhance returns. Chapter 34 on structured
products shows how whole new classes of mutual funds can be constructed by using financial
derivatives.

Chapter 10
Life assurance and assurance-
related investments
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Life assurance without an investment component.
2. Life assurance with an investment component.
3. With-proﬁts policies.
Human capital is the present value of prospective future earnings. For many people, particularly
young people, human capital is their most valuable asset. It is an asset that can be enhanced by
undertaking education and training. It is an asset that can be reduced by illness, and lost through
death.Insurance policies can be taken out to protect against the effects of illness on earning power
(often known as Permanent Health Insurance).Insurance policies can protect a person’s dependants
against the ﬁnancial effects of the person’s death; this is life assurance. Human capital combined
with insurance is much less risky than human capital alone.
Life assurance policies pay out a sum of money upon the death of the insured person.They
divide into term assurance, whole-of-life policies, and endowment policies.
TERM ASSURANCE
Term assurance provides a payout in the event of death occurring before the expiry date of the
policy.The term involved may range from a few weeks to cover a foreign trip to 25 years to cover
a mortgage.Normally the client would pay a regular monthly sum (the premium) for the duration
of the policy.The sum assured could be constant,increasing,or decreasing.The payment in the event
of death may be a lump sum or a stream of income payments (the income alternative is known as
family income beneﬁt).
Renewable term assurance allows the client to extend the term assurance when, or before, the
original policy reaches its expiry date.Convertible term assurance policies allow the client to convert
to a permanent life assurance within the term of the original policy.These options to renew or
convert guarantee future insurability for an additional cost of about 10% of the premium payments.

The insurance company holds two portfolios.There is a portfolio of liabilities in the form of
prospective payments to policy beneﬁciaries.There is also a portfolio of assets, ﬁnanced by client
premiums.Both portfolios are subject to uncertainty.The uncertainty relating to the liabilities arises
because it is not possible to predict precisely the number and timing of claims. However, due to
the law of large numbers, there is a reasonably high predictability.Actuarial tables provide good
predictions of average life expectancy, and if an insurance company has a large number of clients
it can reasonably expect that claims would reﬂect the averages.The uncertainty of the portfolio of
assets arises from asset price changes,and changes in the rates of return on reinvested investment
income.The insurance company is involved in asset-liability management.This entails attempts to
offset the risks of the two portfolios against each other. In the case of the portfolio of assets the
law of large numbers cannot be relied upon since there are risk factors common to many ﬁnancial
assets (these are known as systematic risks).
A portfolio of bonds is often used since bonds are long term (as are the liabilities) and provide
relatively predictable cash ﬂows if they are held to maturity.Another factor that favours investment
in bonds is that the cash flows (coupons and repayment of principal) from most bonds are
predetermined in nominal (i.e.money) terms.Life assurance liabilities are also speciﬁed in nominal
terms.However equity investments (shares) are also held because,over long periods,shares tend
to provide much higher returns than bonds.Also the long-term nature of the investment allows
for returns in bad periods to be offset by those of good periods with the effect that the risks of equity
investment do not rise in proportion to the period of the investment. Insurance companies
frequently have surpluses of assets,which are funds in excess of what is required to match expected
liabilities. It is possible to use such surpluses for relatively risky investments, such as shares and
property.
WHOLE-OF-LIFE POLICIES
An important form of institutional investment is the insurance fund (or life assurance fund).These
funds typically aim to provide a sum of money at a point of time in the future (or at death if that
occurs earlier).They incorporate an element of life insurance.Commonly they require the investor
to make a constant stream of contributions to the fund over the period covered by the policy.
However some allow for lump-sum contributions or for variable periodic payments.Life assurance
investments divide into whole-of-life policies, endowment policies, and investment bonds.
Whole-of-life assurance policies are permanent; they pay out upon death. Since payouts are
inevitable,whole-of-life policies are more expensive than term assurance policies.(In some cases
such policies have a termination age, for example 70. In such cases policyholders must cancel the
policy and take a surrender value when they reach the termination age.) The life ofﬁce’s need
to build an investment reserve to pay beneﬁts on policies means that the policies acquire a surrender
value.The policyholder may cancel the policy and take its cash value. However the cost of the
life assurance renders such policies unsuitable for someone whose concern is simply with
accumulating savings.
Without-proﬁt policies invest solely in ﬁxed income securities such as bonds.With-proﬁts
policies invest in shares and property as well as ﬁxed income securities.In consequence,with-proﬁts
policies entail more potential for growth in the value of the investment. Unit-linked whole-of-
life policies (which are usually invested in unit trusts) provide even greater growth potential, but
LIFE ASSURANCE AND RELATED INVESTMENTS
203

at the cost of greater risk. Unit-linked policies often allow the client to vary the relative levels of
insurance cover and investment over time. For example when family commitments are high
the life assurance cover may be raised at the expense of the rate of accumulation of units in the
investment funds. In some cases the monthly premium to be paid may be varied at the discretion
of the policyholder.
Without-proﬁt policies may ensure a ﬁxed rate of interest for the life of the policy.In such cases
the insurance company may permit policyholders to borrow against the accumulated value of the
fund.A policy taken out when interest rates are low will provide a low return, but could allow
the policyholder to borrow at a correspondingly low rate of interest. Policyholders thus have the
facility of borrowing against their policies at a low rate of interest and investing the proceeds at a
higher rate when interest rates rise.
ENDOWMENT POLICIES
Endowment policies can be likened to savings plans with attached life assurance.They typically
specify a period of time,such as 10 or 25 years,during which regular monthly payments are made.
These monthly premiums ﬁnance the cost of insurance cover and contributions to an investment
fund.At the end of the policy term, the accumulated value of the investment fund is paid to the
policyholder.If the holder dies before the end of the term,the policy beneﬁciaries receive the higher
of the value of the investment fund or the guaranteed sum assured.The guaranteed sum assured is
the amount for which the person’s life is insured.The investment funds are usually either with-
proﬁts or unit-linked.With-proﬁts funds are discussed later in this chapter. Unit-linked funds are
similar to unit trusts and frequently entail stock market investment.There is thus a risk that the
value of a policy could fall sharply just before maturity if the stock market slumps at that time.
However the sum assured will be paid to the policyholder if that sum is greater than the value of
the units on the maturity date.
An endowment policy can be used to pay off a mortgage debt.Throughout the term of the
mortgage,interest is paid on the debt.In addition regular payments are made into an endowment
fund.At the end of the mortgage term the sum of money accumulated in the endowment fund is
used to pay off the mortgage debt. For example if returns on an endowment are 10% p.a., an
annual payment of £16,380 into an endowment will be worth £100,000 in ﬁve years.This can be
used to repay a £100,000 debt.An endowment mortgage involves paying interest on the £100,000
debt each year. If interest rates are 10% p.a., this amounts to £10,000 p.a. So the total annual
payment is £16,380  £10,000  £26,380.
The main alternative to an endowment mortgage is a repayment mortgage. Repayment
mortgages involve amortising the debt (gradually paying it off).A repayment mortgage is illustrated
in Table 10.1.
The repayment mortgage entails a constant payment of £26,380 each year, which is identical
to the annual sum paid in the above case of an endowment mortgage.This identity of payments
arises because the assumed annual return on the endowment fund equals the assumed rate of
interest.
However endowment funds are normally largely invested in equities (shares). Over long
periods,such as the typical term of a mortgage,equity investments have provided average returns
that exceed interest rates.This excess return means that the endowment fund not only pays off the
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
204

mortgage but also produces a lump sum for the policyholder.Alternatively the prospective excess
return allows for reduced payments into the endowment fund,but with the risk that equity returns
turn out to be less than anticipated so that there is insufﬁcient to pay off the mortgage.In the event
of the policyholder dying before the policy matures,the insurance component of the endowment
policy will provide a sum of money to pay off the mortgage debt.
Endowment policies are portable, which means that an endowment policy taken out to repay
the mortgage associated with the purchase of one property can be transferred to a new mortgage
taken out for the purchase of another property.This is usually much better than terminating a
policy and starting another.This is partly because the charges of the endowment policy (particularly
the charges that pay commission to the ﬁnancial adviser who sold the policy) tend to be
concentrated in the ﬁrst year or two of the policy,with the effect that little or nothing is returned
to the investor if the policy is terminated in the early years.It can be many years before investment
returns cover these early costs.Not only do early costs impair the surrender value of an endowment
policy, but also the insurance company may not pay the true value of the policy upon surrender.
It may be better to sell a policy than surrender it. Some institutional investors will buy second-
hand endowment policies.The institution pays less than the full value of the policy, but still pays
more than could be obtained by surrendering the policy.Indeed there are mutual funds that invest
in portfolios of second-hand endowment policies.
FRIENDLY SOCIETY POLICIES
Friendly society policies are a form of endowment policy.They are savings schemes with a small
amount of life assurance attached.They differ from other endowment policies in that the fund is
exempt from income and capital gains taxes.At the time of writing contributions are limited to
£25 per month (£300 per year).The tax concessions are dependent upon a policy running for at
least ten years.
INVESTMENT BONDS
Investment bonds, alternatively known as single premium bonds, are investment products with a
nominal amount of life assurance cover.Typically life cover is 1% of the value of the original
investment.If the investor dies the life assurance company would pay the beneﬁciaries either 101%

Investment bonds may be unit-linked or with-proﬁts.
An investor in a unit-linked bond normally has a choice of funds.These include managed,
general, ﬁxed interest, and specialist funds. Managed funds are invested in a spread of shares,
bonds,property,and deposits.General funds invest in a diversiﬁed portfolio of shares,which may
or may not include shares in foreign companies.General funds might aim to meet the investment
objective of capital growth, or high income, or a balance of the two. General funds can take the
form of index tracker funds that seek to parallel the performance of a stock index such as the
FTSE All-Share Index.Fixed interest funds invest primarily in bonds,often with a high proportion
of government bonds.Some insurance companies offer guaranteed equity bonds that are based on
a stock market but which use options to guarantee that the value of the fund will not fall below a
minimum level.
Specialist funds can have various types of specialisation.The specialisation might be geographic,
for example focusing on Europe, North America, or Japan.There may be an industry focus, such
as high technology or ﬁnancials.The specialisation could be related to ﬁrm size or situation, for
example smaller company or recovery funds.
Other funds often made available to investors include property,money market,and with-proﬁts
funds. Property funds invest in industrial and commercial property. Money market funds invest
in bank deposits and other money market instruments such as Treasury bills and commercial paper.
With-proﬁts funds are often unitised; investors acquire units in a with-proﬁts fund.
Specialist funds are the most risky,particularly since they involve non-systematic (speciﬁc) risk
as well as systematic (market) risk. General equity funds are next in order of riskiness, although
they avoid much of the non-systematic risk if they are well diversiﬁed. Managed funds and with-
proﬁts funds are less risky than pure equity funds since they mix shares with less risky assets such
as bonds and deposits.Money market funds are the least risky in the sense of uncertainty of capital
value. Historically the average annual returns are related to the proportion of shares in the fund;
the higher this proportion, the higher the returns over the long term.
Investment bonds usually allow the bondholder to switch between investment funds at any
time. However there may be a charge for a switch. Investment bonds are often segmented into a
number of separate policies,perhaps ﬁve or ten.The policies within the bond are usually identical.
An advantage of the segmentation is that each policy can be surrendered (i.e. encashed) at a
different point in time.
One disadvantage of investment bonds relative to unit trusts, investment trusts, and OEICs
arises from the tax treatment of capital gains. In the cases of unit trusts, investment trusts, and
OEICs a capital gains tax liability arises only if the individual investor has gains above the exemption
limit (and only when the investment is sold).In contrast investment bonds pay tax on capital gains
within the fund with the effect that investors suffer the effects of tax on capital gains irrespective
of whether they,as individuals,fall below or above the threshold at which capital gains tax becomes
payable.Since the taxation of investment bonds treats capital gains as income,the taxation occurs
as gains are realised.Although it is the fund rather than the investor that is taxed, the effect is the
same from the perspective of the investor.
Another relative disadvantage of investment bonds is that that they tend to have relatively high
initial charges (it is not unusual for as much of 7% of the initial investment to be lost in payment
of up-front charges). Part of the high initial charge is used to pay relatively generous commission
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
206

to the ﬁnancial adviser; in consequence ﬁnancial advisers could recommend investment bonds
even though they may not be the most suitable investment for their clients.
The Financial Times on 16 July 2005 (Knight 2005, based on ﬁgures provided by Hargreaves
Lansdown) compared direct investment in unit trusts with investment in the same funds within a
single premium investment bond (provided by Skandia).Table 10.2 shows the results of £10,000
invested in a unit trust, and in an investment bond, over a period of 15 years.
Many investment bonds require the investment to be held for a minimum period such as
ten years; this contrasts with unit trusts and OEICs, which can be sold back to the managers
at any time. It also contrasts with investment trusts, which can be sold on the stock market at
any time.
An attraction for higher-rate taxpayers who want current income is the facility of top slicing.
It is possible to take 5% of the initial investment as tax-free income each year, for up to twenty
years (in effect this amounts to a return of the sum invested).No tax is payable until the investment
bond matures, and the tax on the gains from the bond are then taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal
rate of tax in the year of maturity.This has advantages for a higher-rate taxpayer who will have
retired by the time the bond matures. If the marginal rate of tax after retirement is the basic rate,
the whole of the gains from the bond over its entire life could be taxed at the basic rate.The total
gain,from an investment bond held for twenty years,would be divided by twenty and the resulting
sum added to the investor’s total income at maturity.If the gains (divided by twenty),when added
to the person’s income at maturity,fail to take the total income into the higher-rate tax band there
will be no higher-rate tax payable.
As an example, consider an investor who has a pension of £25,000 and a maturing investment
bond. If the gains on the bond over twenty years amount to £200,000, the sum of £200,000/20
 £10,000 is added to the £25,000 pension in order to ascertain tax liability.If the resulting sum
of £25,000  £10,000  £35,000 falls below the higher-rate tax threshold, basic rate tax is
applied to the whole £200,000. Since the Inland Revenue deems basic rate tax to have been paid,
no tax liability arises.The result is that the higher-rate taxpayer has taken an income from the
investment bond over twenty years, and has received a maturity value, without having incurred a
higher-rate tax liability on the returns from the investment bond.This advantage of top slicing needs
to be weighed against the disadvantage of incurring capital gains tax paid by the fund in which the
bond is invested. If the investor normally pays capital gains tax, this disadvantage does not apply.
Investment bonds are likely to be useful for higher-rate taxpayers,who have ongoing capital gains
tax liabilities and who anticipate a substantial fall in income at retirement. (They can also have
advantages for inheritance tax planning when held in trust.)

Maximum investment plans (MIPs) are similar to investment bonds, but entail the investment
of regular monthly or annual premiums.They run for speciﬁed periods, frequently ten years.At
the end of the period the investor can either cash in the bond or leave it to accumulate without
necessarily investing any more money in it.
WITH-PROFITS FUNDS
Like unit trusts and investment trusts,with-proﬁts funds offer the means of pooling the investments
of thousands of small investors into a large fund that can hold a diversiﬁed portfolio of investments
without incurring disproportionate transaction costs.Compared with unit and investment trusts,
with-proﬁts funds provide a reduced risk means of participating in stock market investment.Such
a fund might be the basis of a pension plan,investment bond,or an endowment policy.If an investor
puts a lump sum into a with-proﬁts investment bond, for example, the value of that investment
cannot fall below its initial value irrespective of what happens in stock markets. Furthermore the
scheme provider (typically an insurance company) will add a sum of money to the plan holder’s
personal fund each year.This sum is known as an annual or reversionary bonus and once added
cannot be taken away.The money value of the investor’s personal fund can only grow; it cannot
fall.The scheme provider will normally add a further bonus,known as the terminal bonus,on the
date that the investor’s investment matures.
The term ‘with-proﬁts’ arises from the participation in the proﬁts (or losses) of other parts of
the insurance company’s business.‘With-proﬁts’policyholders share in the proﬁts and losses of the
company’s other lines of business,such as term assurance and annuities.In the case of a proprietary
insurance company (one that has shareholders),proﬁts from the other lines of business are shared
between ‘with-proﬁts’ policyholders and shareholders.A mutual insurance company is owned by
its ‘with-proﬁts’ policyholders, who receive all the proﬁts (and bear all the losses).
In the case of a with-proﬁts endowment policy the insurance company, in exchange for a
commitment by the policyholder to pay monthly premiums over an agreed number of years,
guarantees the payment of a lump sum at the end of the period.The reversionary (annual) bonuses
are added to that guaranteed lump sum. For example a reversionary bonus of 5% increases a
guaranteed lump sum of £10,000 to £10,500. In the case of an endowment policy, reversionary
bonuses are dependent upon the policy being held for the full term agreed when starting the
policy. A terminal bonus will be added on the maturity date of the endowment policy. Both
reversionary and terminal bonuses are subject to change from year to year.
So a with-proﬁts investment provides a high degree of security.It further reduces risk through
the smoothing of investment returns over time.The insurance company (or other provider) will
manage a fund that will typically consist of shares, bonds, property, and bank deposits (and other
money market investments).Investments into a with-proﬁts scheme will go into this fund and the
returns on the fund will pay for the bonuses.The provider of the with-proﬁts scheme will put
some of these returns into a reserve in years in which the fund performs particularly well and will
take money out of the reserve in order to pay bonuses in years that show relatively poor investment
performance.Good and bad years are averaged out so that the private investor in the with-proﬁts
scheme is protected against the extremes of stock market ﬂuctuations.
The operation of a with-proﬁts scheme can be illustrated by means of Table 10.3. It shows the
returns from £1,000 invested in 1989.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
208

In Table 10.3 the second column shows the percentage returns on the with-proﬁts fund net of
charges.The third column indicates the value of the individual’s investment on the basis of having
a proportionate share of the assets of the fund (proportionate to the initial investment); this is
sometimes referred to as the ‘asset share’.The fourth column shows the percentage addition to
the fund value allocated to the individual investor.This is often referred to as the smoothed
allocation since it reﬂects the principle of reallocating investment returns between time periods.
For example in 1993 only 21% of the 28.8% return was allocated to investors whereas in the
following year the allocation was 8.2% higher than the returns on the fund.
This is not the only possible means of smoothing.Another approach is revealed by the following
abstract.
HOW WE APPLY SMOOTHING
We work out the value of the unsmoothed asset shares underlying three sample plans
which are identical to yours in all respects except that one will have started one year
earlier than yours, and one two years earlier.We then take the average of these three
values, which gives what we call the smoothed asset share value of the sample plan that
started at the same time as yours.
(Tunbridge Wells Equitable 2006)
The ﬁfth column shows the cumulative total of allocations made to the individual investor.
The sixth column contains the percentage allocations that are guaranteed, and hence cannot ´´be
lost by the investor.These guaranteed returns correspond to the reversionary bonuses.They may
be based on the present cumulative total of allocations, or on a projection of the cumulative total
by the maturity date of the policy.The ﬁnal column shows the cumulative guaranteed total which
consists of the initial investment plus the sum of the annual reversionary bonuses.The values in

this column constitute the lowest level that the investment could reach irrespective of what happens
in stock markets.
At maturity of the pension or endowment plan (or at death if earlier) a terminal bonus is added
to the guaranteed total.The terminal bonus is the difference between the total guaranteed and the
total allocated. At maturity the investor receives the sum in the ﬁfth column, made up of the
guaranteed total (initial investment plus annual bonuses) and a terminal bonus.The difference
between the sums in the third and ﬁfth columns remains with the scheme provider as reserves.
These reserves, sometimes known as orphan funds, are available for the payment of bonuses in
future years in which investment returns are poor.
From the perspective of the scheme provider the value of the private individuals’ policies
constitutes a liability, whereas the underlying portfolio of investments is an asset.The surplus (or
excess) is the amount by which the value of the investments held by the underlying fund exceeds
the aggregate value of the liabilities (the total value of all the individual with-proﬁts policies).
Companies providing the schemes are required to maintain a surplus as reserves,and this surplus
must be at least equal to a speciﬁed minimum value.This minimum surplus used to be known as
the solvency margin,but since 2004 the minimum amount of solvency capital that must be shown
in the balance sheet has been known as the ‘risk capital margin’.
The surplus remaining above the required minimum solvency margin (risk capital margin) will
be divided between the current payment of bonuses to the scheme members,the reserves (available
for bonus payments in future years), and dividends for shareholders (this is not applicable if the
company is a mutual and hence owned by its with-proﬁts policyholders – a mutual has no
shareholders).
It is sometimes argued that the annual (reversionary) bonuses reﬂect the current income on
investments (dividends, interest, etc.) whilst the terminal bonuses arise from capital gains on the
investments. This cannot be precisely true since in many years annual bonus rates deviate
substantially from the rates of income yield on investments. Nevertheless there may be a kernel
of truth in the idea, although it seems likely that some part of expected capital gain would be
incorporated into the annual bonus if the annual bonus were based on prospective long-term
returns.In the case of the Prudential (2006):‘Rates of regular bonus are determined for each type
of policy primarily by targeting them at a prudent proportion of the long-term expected future
investment return on the underlying assets.’ (Here the annual or reversionary bonus is called the
regular bonus.)
One question concerns the cost of the risk reduction provided by the guaranteed sums. Some
argue that the risk reduction is more apparent than real. Instead of ﬂuctuations in the current
value of the policy, there is uncertainty as to the size of the terminal bonus. However with
proﬁts policies do provide a form of disaster insurance; in the event of an extreme collapse of
share prices the policyholder is protected. It is likely that the provider covers its guarantees to
policyholders by investing a sufﬁcient proportion of the fund in low risk securities such as
government bonds,Treasury bills,and high-grade bank deposits.A cost of the risk reduction is the
lowering of prospective investment returns arising from investment in low risk (and hence low
return) assets.
Some providers of with-proﬁts policies seek further risk reduction, as an individual’s policy
approaches maturity,by switching the mix of investments allocated to the particular policyholder.
A gradual switch from higher risk to lower risk investments aims at ensuring increasing stability
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
210

of the asset share relating to that policy,and seeks to ensure that the fund value does not fall below
the sum required to meet the guaranteed bonuses.
Unitised with-proﬁts policies were introduced in response to the emergence of unit-linked
policies based on unit trusts. Unitised with-proﬁts policies were introduced in order to facilitate
switches with other units within unit-linked policies.Investors could now sell units in one type of
fund in order to buy units in another. In some cases the value of the with-proﬁts units will never
fall (so long as the policy is not terminated before the maturity date).In other cases the protection
against a fall only applies towards the end of the policy term.The cost of the protection may be
covered by the type of smoothing illustrated by Table 10.3, or by means of a more mechanical
procedure such as deducting 0.5% from the annual return on units.The ﬁnal return to the investor
will be the value of the units plus any terminal bonus.Whether the policy is conventional or
unitised, the maturity value should be similar. As with conventional with-proﬁts policies,
termination of a unitised with-proﬁts policy before its maturity date could involve a reduction in
value in the form of an exit penalty or ‘market value adjustment’ (which may also be applied in
the event of switching from with-proﬁts units to units in other funds).
Companies justify ‘market value adjustments’ by pointing out that when policyholders
prematurely terminate their policies at a time of low stock market prices, the declared value of
holdings may be greater than the true values.If the declared values were paid,the fund – and hence
other investors – would lose.The market value adjustment is intended to ensure that the money
paid to those investors who prematurely terminate reﬂects the true value of their investments as
measured by the ‘asset share’.The asset share represents the policyholder’s fair share of the fund
taking account of premiums paid,returns on the fund,deductions for fund charges and expenses,
and proﬁts (or losses) from other lines of business. If the declared values of holdings exceed asset
shares, bonuses need to be reduced in order to remove the discrepancy.
The Signiﬁcance of Financial Strength
Financial strength refers to the amount of money that a life ofﬁce has in its ﬁnancial reserve. It is
a measure of a life company’s ability to meet its liabilities and provides an indication of how likely
the company is to pay future bonuses.A company with large reserves has more investment freedom,
allowing greater exposure to equities (more emphasis on shares).Large reserves also allow bonus
rates to be maintained when markets fall.
Only those with sufﬁcient ﬁnancial strength can invest in the relatively volatile asset classes of
equities and property and continue to deliver consistent returns.Weaker companies are forced to
maintain a higher proportion of their investments in bonds and deposits.Bonds and deposits tend
to offer less growth potential than equities.
One way of determining a company’s ﬁnancial strength is to look at its ‘free asset ratio’.This is
a measure of the free assets that a company holds expressed as a percentage of total assets. Free
assets are assets remaining after liabilities have been accounted for. However the information
provided by the free asset ratio is not unambiguous;free assets may be large because the company
tends to be mean with its bonus payments.
Since 2004, in order to improve the transparency of with-proﬁts funds, the Financial Services
Authority has required fund providers to use a ‘realistic balance sheet’measure of ﬁnancial strength.
This is intended to replace the ‘free asset ratio’, which failed to take account of all balance sheet
LIFE ASSURANCE AND RELATED INVESTMENTS
211

risks.This new measure is based on a more realistic calculation of free assets (assets that are
genuinely in excess of all current and potential future liabilities, allowing for all possible
eventualities).The new measure is sometimes referred to as ‘excess realistic assets’.
Under the new system the minimum amount of solvency capital that must be shown in the
balance sheet is known as the ‘risk capital margin’.The size of the ‘risk capital margin’depends on
the level of investment risk;so a fund provider with a high proportion of the fund in shares (equity)
will have a higher ‘risk capital margin’than one invested mainly in bonds.The ‘risk capital margin’
must be put aside out of what would otherwise be free assets.
The free assets,or reserves,of a with-proﬁts fund are often called the inherited estate.Typically
asset shares are not credited with any part of the investment return earned on the inherited estate.
However the inherited estate would be used to provide resources for smoothing and the provision
of guarantees (Prudential 2006). Inherited estates are alternatively known as orphan estates, or
orphan funds.Not all of the money in such estates may be required for meeting risk capital margins,
for paying bonuses to policyholders, or for smoothing. Such estates could be accumulated over
many decades and would be enhanced by the fact that some policyholders fail to claim the value
of their policies at maturity (sometimes because of death, or possibly because the policy is
forgotten). Inherited estates may arise partly through past bonus payments being too low.
Companies (typically life assurance companies) may distribute orphan funds amongst current
policyholders and shareholders but approval from the Financial Services Authority is required for
such a move. Previous policyholders (who may have received low bonuses) would have no rights
to a share of such a distribution. So existing policyholders would receive money that was
accumulated as a result of the with-proﬁts policies of past policyholders.
Criticisms
One criticism made of with-proﬁts policies is that the term ‘with proﬁts’is in reality a misnomer.
Originally this term was used on the grounds that with-proﬁts policyholders shared in the
proﬁts made from the company’s other operations (non with-proﬁts business). In reality
with-proﬁts funds typically do not receive income from sources other than the with-proﬁts
fund itself.
Another criticism sometimes made is that most companies give policyholders little information.
Most companies give no information about investment returns, asset shares, or the smoothing. It
has been suggested that this lack of information allows companies to manipulate payouts so that
transfer values (the sums transferred when switching to other providers) are reduced in order to
boost maturity values (which are the values used in sales and marketing). It may also be possible
that transfer values are trimmed for the purpose of replenishing reserves.
If a policyholder terminates a policy before maturity a transfer value is payable.This transfer
value should equal the cumulative value of the allocated returns (inclusive of the initial investment).
If this value exceeds the asset share (the accumulated assets resulting from the initial investment
plus investment returns) then the transfer value should equal the asset share.The use of the asset
share rather than the cumulative smoothed allocation is referred to as a ‘market value adjustment’.
Many observers suspect that,under the cover of incomplete information,some companies set
transfer values below both the asset share and the smoothed allocation.The surplus might be used
to enhance maturity values. Potential new clients may be made aware of maturity values but not
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
212

experienced transfer values. It is possible for companies to boost their sales of new policies by
boosting maturity values at the expense of transfer values.
CONCLUSION
Life assurance provides a lump sum,or an income,for dependants in the event of the death of the
insured person. It is possible to take out life assurance on its own, or in combination with an
investment.Whole-of-life policies, endowment policies, and investment bonds combine life
assurance with investments.These are collective investment schemes that have much in common
with mutual funds such as unit trusts.In particular they provide means of investing in a diversiﬁed
portfolio of assets such as shares, bonds, and property.
A disadvantage of life assurance linked investments is that in the UK they are taxed unfavourably
relative to other collective investments (such as unit trusts,OEICs,investment trusts,and pension
funds). In addition to the tax disadvantages, they tend to be subject to higher charges than other
collective investments.It was shown in Chapter 9 on mutual funds how taxation and charges could
severely reduce investment values,especially when investments are long term.These disadvantages
render life assurance linked investments unsuitable for most individuals, when compared to the
alternatives. However they continue to be recommended by many ﬁnancial advisers, presumably
because they provide relatively high commission payments for the advisers.
With-proﬁts funds have the feature that the sum invested, plus subsequent annual bonuses,
cannot be lost.This protection against loss should have appeal for loss-averse investors. Prospect
theory (see Chapter 2 on personal investment decisions, and Chapter 24 on noise trading and
behavioural ﬁnance) indicates that the pain of a loss is greater than the pleasure from a gain of the
same size.This renders people fearful of losses.In consequence the protection against loss,provided
by with-proﬁts funds, should appeal to many people.
Another collective investment that provides protection against loss is a guaranteed equity bond
(see Chapter 34 on structured products).One difference between these types of fund is that with-
proﬁts funds invest in a wide range of assets (including shares,bonds,property,and cash) whereas
guaranteed equity bonds are normally based solely on shares.This difference should render the
returns on with-proﬁts funds less volatile, but at the expense of a lower long-run return.
Another difference lies in the means of providing the protection against losses. In the case of
with-proﬁts funds,a part of the returns from investments is allocated to a reserve.Money is taken
from the reserve and allocated to investors in the event of a fall in asset prices. In the case of
guaranteed equity funds,the protection is provided by the purchase of options by the fund managers
(see Chapters 31 and 34 on stock options and structured products,respectively).In both cases the
protection comes at a cost to the investor,so that the reduced risk is accompanied by lower expected
returns.

Chapter 11
Pensions
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Types of pension schemes and pension funds.
2. Annuities.
3. The life-cycle analysis of pension funding.
In most developed countries the pension system has three components.First,there is a state pension
that aims to provide a basic retirement income for everyone. State pensions are ﬁnanced from
current tax receipts. Pensions ﬁnanced from current revenues are referred to as pay-as-you-go
pensions. In the UK there is a basic state pension plus an earnings-related state pension known as
the state second pension.In the UK there is a pensions tax credit whose function is to guarantee a
minimum level of income, which exceeds the basic state pension.The pensions tax credit adds to
the basic state pension on a means-tested basis.If a retiree has pension rights in addition to the basic
state pension (e.g. state second pension, occupational pension, private pension), the pensions tax
credit is reduced by 40p for every pound of additional pension. If the additional pension exceeds
a particular level, no pensions tax credit is payable.There is concern that the pensions tax credit
may deter people from saving for a pension since the private pension receipts would reduce
entitlement to the pensions tax credit. Unlike private sector pensions, state pensions are backed
by the ability of the government to tax and borrow (this guarantee extends to other state-funded
pensions such as those of civil servants, the armed forces, and teachers).
Second,there are pensions arranged by employers.Such pensions are usually called occupational
pensions. Occupational pensions may be operated on a pay-as-you-go basis or may be funded.
Funded schemes entail the accumulation of investments with which to ﬁnance the pensions.Third,
there may be a layer of pension ﬁnanced on a voluntary basis. UK examples would be additional
voluntary contributions (AVCs), personal pension plans, and stakeholder pensions. Employees
can supplement their occupational pensions by paying into an AVC fund,a personal pension plan,
or a stakeholder pension. So an employee can retire with a state pension, plus an occupational
pension, plus a supplementary pension. For many people either the occupational pension or the

EXHIBIT 11.1
THE FRENCH STATE PENSIONS RESERVE FUND
Since 2004 the French government has been investing in a portfolio whose function is to support
the state pension scheme in future years.
It was estimated that by 2040 state pensions would be costing 2.8% of national income.
It has been estimated that, if the French government contributes the legal minimum amount each
year until 2020, the fund would meet 22% of the cost of the state pension scheme.
In 2007 the fund comprised 26% in bonds, 62% in equities (shares), and 12% in cash.
The fund is largely ﬁnanced from taxation and the sale of state-owned assets (such as
privatisations and the sale of licences).
supplementary pension is absent, and frequently both are absent. Many people do not have an
occupational pension available, in which case the non-state part of the pension provision is a
personal pension plan or a stakeholder pension.
In many countries, pension funds are the dominant form of institutional investment.These
funds are built up during the working life of the investor and then used to ﬁnance an income during
retirement.They may be operated by the company for which the person works.The company
invests over time to build up a fund that is used to provide a retirement income for its employees.
Alternatively the employees invest in a fund of their choosing with a view to building up a sum of
money that can be used to buy an annuity (guaranteed stream of income) at retirement.The most
important assets within the portfolios of pension funds tend to be stock market investments in the
form of shares and bonds. However other assets are frequently held, particularly deposits and
property.Some funds have even been known to hold alternative investments such as works of art.
The importance of funded pensions varies considerably between countries. For example IFSL
(International Financial Services, London) estimated that in 2004 the UK accounted for $1,464
billion in pension funds whereas Germany had just $268 billion and France $164 billion.However
the importance of pension funds in Germany and France seemed to be increasing rapidly since
pension funds in both had more than doubled in the previous three years (the 2001 ﬁgures being
$125 billion for Germany and $65 billion for France).
It seems likely that many people see the different forms of pension as substitutes for each other.
For example the provision of an occupational pension by an employer may make it less likely that
people personally save for their retirements.There is evidence that there is perceived substitutability
between state pensions and personal provision.Attanasio and Rohwedder (2004) investigated the
behaviour of pension investors in the UK.They found a negative relationship between state pension
provision and private retirement saving.They found that the extent of perceived substitutability
increases with age, up to the point where each additional £1 of state pension provision reduces
personal provision by £0.75. Fraser et al. (2000) found that the provision of state pensions in the
United States affected the form of personal pension saving.State pensions increased the proportion
of personal pension savings held in equity-related investments.This is presumably because state
pensions are seen as low risk and hence allow the acceptance of high risk investments such as
equities (shares) in personal pension schemes.

TYPES OF PENSION SCHEMES
Pension schemes can be divided into deﬁned-beneﬁt and deﬁned-contribution schemes.Deﬁned-
beneﬁt schemes are virtually always pensions provided by employers for their employees.They
stipulate a particular level of income in retirement, normally based on ﬁnal salary and length of
service.Deﬁned-contribution pension schemes do not involve a prescribed income in retirement,
instead they prescribe levels of contribution to the fund prior to retirement.The retirement income
obtained through a deﬁned-contribution scheme depends upon the growth rate of the fund and
the annuity rates available at the time of retirement. In the UK both employer and employee
contributions to pension schemes are tax-deductible. However the pension is taxable.
Pensions may be personal or occupational. Personal pensions are arranged by individuals in
order to provide incomes for their retirement. Occupational pensions are arranged by their
employers.Occupational pensions may be ﬁnal salary or money purchase.Occupational schemes
will either involve contributions to the pension fund by the employer only (non-contributory
schemes), or by both employer and employee.
Final-salary pension schemes link the size of the pension income to the employee’s salary at
retirement,and to the number of years worked for the employer.Such schemes are deﬁned-beneﬁt
schemes.The pension beneﬁts are speciﬁed,in part by Inland Revenue rules,rather than the means
of ﬁnancing them being speciﬁed. For example a pension may be set at 1/80th of ﬁnal salary for
every year worked for the employer (so 40 years service provides a pension of 40  1/80
 40/80th, i.e. 1/2, of ﬁnal salary). Members of deﬁned-beneﬁt occupational pension schemes
usually have to wait until the ‘normal retirement age’ of the scheme (typically either 60 or 65)
before drawing the pension.If a member wishes to draw a pension earlier,there would usually be
an actuarial reduction of around 5% per year of early retirement. For example retirement at 55,
when the normal retirement age is 60,would entail a reduction in the annual pension of about 25%.
In the case of deﬁned-beneﬁt pensions there is a difference between the pension plan and the
pension fund.The plan is a contractual obligation on the part of the employer to provide speciﬁed
pension beneﬁts.The pension fund is a pool of investments,which is intended to ﬁnance the pension
payments stipulated by the pension plan. It is not unusual for the value of the investments in the
pension fund to fall short of the present value of the payments promised by the pension plan; in
other words pension plans are often underfunded.
Although there are actuarial reductions for retirement before the normal retirement age,there
are not usually actuarial enhancements for retirement after the normal retirement age.Arguably
this asymmetry is an anomaly in occupational pension schemes. If the annual payment is reduced
when the expected number of years of payment rises,the annual payment should be increased when

The fund is intended to provide a better distribution between generations. The fund aims to avoid
passing an unacceptably high proportion of the pensions burden on to future generations. By
ﬁnancing the fund the generation, which will soon retire, is partially ﬁnancing its own
prospective pension needs. Otherwise the full cost would be borne by future generations.
Source: Newlands (2007).

the expected number of years of payment is reduced. It is notable that in the UK there are
enhancements to the basic state pension if the pension claim is deferred.
An alternative form of deﬁned-beneﬁt scheme is the CARE scheme (career average revalued
earnings). In the case of CARE schemes the link is not with ﬁnal-salary, but with the employee’s
average salary during their career with the employer. Each year’s salary is revalued in line with
inﬂation up to the retirement date when assessing the size of the pension.Those who enjoy rapid
promotion will gain more from a ﬁnal-salary scheme than from an average salary scheme.However
some employees may ﬁnd that their earnings peak at the beginning, or in the middle, of their
careers rather than at the end.Those employees may gain from an average salary scheme.When
average earnings are revalued in line with price inﬂation,rather than wage inﬂation,average salary
schemes will tend to provide less than ﬁnal-salary schemes if wage inﬂation exceeds price inﬂation
(as it normally does).
Money-purchase schemes entail payments into a pension fund.At retirement the pension fund
is usually used to buy an annuity.Taking money out of a pension fund and using it to buy an annuity
is known as ‘vesting’.A retirement annuity is an income guaranteed for the life of the recipient.
The retirement income depends upon the performance of the pension fund up to the retirement
date,and upon the annuity rates available at the retirement date.Money-purchase schemes are also
known as deﬁned-contribution schemes since the size of the contributions to the scheme are
prescribed by rules.There is no upper limit to the level of income that a deﬁned-contribution
scheme can provide at retirement (whereas UK Inland Revenue rules put an upper limit on the
pension income from a deﬁned-beneﬁt scheme).
Personal pensions are always of the money-purchase type. Personal pension plans and
stakeholder pensions are variants of personal pensions.Stakeholder pensions are distinguished by
relatively low charges and liberal conditions. Not only can working people who do not have an
occupational pension use stakeholder pensions,but also people without employment incomes and
people who are members of occupational schemes can use stakeholder pensions.They are restricted
to people whose incomes fall below a speciﬁed level.Employers may use stakeholder pensions for
their employees.Employers could also use group personal pensions,which are effectively groups
of individual personal pension plans. Additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) are a form of
personal pension that aims to top up occupational schemes.They may be contributions into a
pension fund arranged by the employer, or into an independently operated fund in which case
they are known as free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs).
Most of the money in pension funds is invested in stock markets.In consequence there is a high
degree of uncertainty concerning the future value of a pension fund.In the case of money-purchase
schemes,it is the recipient of the pension who bears this risk.The recipient also bears the risk that
annuity rates, and hence the retirement income that can be purchased, will be low at retirement.
Since annuities are based on government bonds (gilts),this risk relates to the possibility that rates
of yield on government bonds will be low at the time of retirement.
In the case of ﬁnal-salary schemes, the employer bears the risks. A combination of poor
investment performance, low bond yields, and high rates of salary growth can result in pension
funds being insufﬁcient to meet the pension commitments. In such a case the employer must
replenish the pension fund out of that employer’s business revenues.
In the UK up to 25% of a pension fund can be taken as a tax-free lump sum rather than
being used to buy an annuity. In the case of money-purchase (deﬁned-contribution) schemes, the

EXHIBIT 11.2
TEACHERS’ PENSION SCHEME
(ENGLAND AND WALES)
The teachers’ pension scheme in which the lump sum is compulsory is the scheme applicable to
teachers in service before 31 December 2006. There is a new scheme for teachers entering service
from 1 January 2007 onwards.
Old scheme (for teachers in post by 31 December 2006)
The normal pension age is 60. Pension of 1/80th of ﬁnal salary for each year served, plus lump
sum of three times annual pension. The pensions are index-linked to the Retail Prices Index (RPI).
New scheme (for teachers joining from 1 January 2007)
The normal pension age is 65. The pension is 1/60th of ﬁnal salary for each year served. Option
of taking up to 25% as a lump sum on the basis of the lump sum being twelve times the annual
pension foregone. Pensions index-linked to the RPI.
To see the effect of taking 25% of the pension rights as a lump sum consider a teacher with
40 years service retiring with a ﬁnal salary of £36,000. The pension without taking the lump sum
would be:
(£36,000/60)  40  £24,000 p.a.
The pension when the lump sum is taken would be:
£24,000  0.75  £18,000 p.a.
And the lump sum would be:
(£24,000  £18,000)  12  £6,000  12  £72,000
tax-free lump sum can be taken at a different time than the annuity purchase. In the case of
ﬁnal-salary schemes there may also be a choice of taking part of the pension rights as a tax-free
lump sum (this is known as commutation).However this may not be on favourable terms.The lump
sum available is often less than the value of the income that is given up.
The Teachers’ Pension Scheme in the UK may be used as an example. In this case the pensioner
has no choice,part of the pension rights must be taken as a lump sum.The lump sum is three times
the annual pension and is regarded as constituting 20% of the total pension rights.The Teachers’
Pension Scheme pays 1/80 of ﬁnal salary for each year of full-time employment. So for a teacher
with 40 years of service the annual pension is 50% (40/80) of ﬁnal salary.The lump sum is considered
to be equivalent to a further 12.5%.In other words the lump sum is regarded as equivalent to 25%
of the annual pension.However at the annuity rates available at the time of writing such a lump sum
would buy an annuity of about 15% of the annual pension. (The annuity rate is the annual income
purchased as a percentage of the sum paid for it.) For the lump sum to be equivalent to 25% of the
annual pension, the lump sum should be about ﬁve times the annual pension.

Under the old scheme a teacher retiring after 40 years service with a ﬁnal salary of £36,000 would
receive a pension of:
(£36,000/80)  40  £18,000 p.a.
And a lump sum of £18,000  3  £54,000
In the case of the UK Teachers’ Pension Scheme employees have no choice; they must take the
lump-sum component. In most private sector ﬁnal-salary pension schemes there is a choice.The
employee should look carefully at whether the lump sum is a true equivalent of the pension income
foregone (the relationship between the pension income foregone and the lump sum is often called
the commutation factor).Typically the maximum lump sum after 40 years service is 1.5 times ﬁnal
salary.At the time of writing annuity rates would generate an income from such a lump sum that
is well short of the pension income given up.
It might be noted that commutation of part of the pension effectively turns a 1/60th scheme
(which is typical of UK private sector occupational pension schemes) into a 1/80th scheme.
Someone taking a full pension after 40 years in a 1/60th scheme receives 40/60th of ﬁnal salary
as annual pension. Commutation of 25% into a lump sum reduces this to 30/60th, which is the
same as 40/80th. So commutation turns a 40/60 pension into a 40/80 pension plus a lump sum
of 1.5 times ﬁnal salary (three times annual pension).This is the same as public sector pensions
such as the Teachers’Pension Scheme.However public sector pensions are normally fully indexed
to inﬂation whereas private sector ﬁnal-salary schemes are not compelled to match price increases
above 2.5% p.a.
OCCUPATIONAL PENSION SCHEMES IN THE UK
Since the early 1900s large UK companies have operated staff pension schemes,which are managed
by the companies themselves rather than by outside organisations such as insurance companies.
They are known as ‘self-administered’pension schemes.They are based on the concept of the legal
trust, which is a legal entity that separates the control of assets from the right to beneﬁt from
them. A board of trustees administers the pension scheme on behalf of the beneﬁciaries.
Investments are put into a ring-fenced fund separated from the employer’s ﬁnances.An alternative
form of occupational pension arrangement, used by many employers, is the insurance company-
administered group pension scheme. Insurance company group schemes have been attractive to
small and medium-sized ﬁrms.The attraction for such ﬁrms arises from the reduced risks, and
administration costs,made possible by the pooling of funds (the insurance company operates a fund
in which a number of ﬁrms can invest their pension payments).
There are examples of multi-employer pension schemes where a group of employers jointly
operate a scheme. The Universities Superannuation Scheme is an example, which covers
UK universities (those designated as universities before 1992;post-1992 universities are covered
by the Teachers’ Pension Scheme which is not a funded scheme). Another UK example of a
multi-employer pension scheme is the Building and Civil Engineers’Beneﬁts Scheme,which covers
about 7,000 employers and over 200,000 employees.
PENSIONS
219

Investment managers within the company that operates the scheme may manage the investments
in a ‘self-administered’ pension fund, but this is rare. Frequently the investment management is
put into the hands of ﬁnancial institutions.Alternatively the investments can be put into tax-exempt
unit trusts managed by ﬁnancial institutions; often insurance companies.
Pension scheme trustees are often not investment specialists.They tend to engage pension fund
consultants for assistance with the selection and monitoring of institutions that undertake
investment management.The companies that operate as pension fund consultants are often ﬁrms
of actuaries.They draw up shortlists of investment management organisations, from which the
trustees choose.
If the trustees operate on a ‘balanced’ basis they assign the asset allocation decision to the
appointed investment manager.The asset allocation decision relates to the allocation of funds
between asset classes,where asset classes are categories such as UK shares,overseas shares,bonds,
property, and money market investments. If the trustees operate on a ‘specialist’ basis, they
themselves decide on asset allocation (with advice from pension consultants) and then award
mandates to investment management organisations.The management of each asset class may be
awarded to a different investment manager (or managers).The specialist approach often uses a core-
satellite style, which entails a core fund being managed as an index tracker (or group of index
trackers) and the remainder being managed by a number of specialised active fund managers.
How a pension fund is managed is influenced by the age of the fund.Younger funds (with
relatively young members) can take more risk and are likely to be tilted towards equities (shares)
in order to enhance long-term growth prospects.Older funds (with older members) are likely to
emphasise bonds in order to achieve security and predictability.
Personal pension funds are sometimes managed in a similar manner,but with regard to the age
of the individual member rather than the average age of a group of members.This is referred to as
lifestyling.The lifestyling strategy gradually switches the person’s pension fund out of shares and
property and into bonds and cash (money market investments) during the last few years before
retirement.The intention is to protect the person from any sharp fall in share or property prices
that might occur shortly before retirement. More sophisticated versions of the lifestyle approach
not only relate the switch to period to retirement but also to market performance.In such versions
the switch out of shares is greater following strong stock market performance than after weak
performance.The better the performance the quicker the move from shares to bonds;the weaker
the performance the slower the move.In this way there is less likelihood of switching from shares
to bonds when share prices are particularly low. In some cases the automated asset allocation
strategy may be based entirely on market performance rather than time to retirement.
Until 1999 most company pension schemes were deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes (pension based on
salary and years of service).Since 1999 many companies have been closing deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes
to new employees and replacing them with deﬁned-contribution schemes (pension based on an
accumulated pension fund).This has been partly due to the risks that deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes
impose on employers.These risks take several forms.There is the risk of stock markets performing
poorly with the effect that the employer has to make large additional contributions to the pension
fund.Another major form of risk arises from changes in longevity; if pensioners live longer they
draw more from the pension fund. Falling bond yields and unexpectedly fast salary increases can
exacerbate these risks.The Pensions Act 1995 imposed requirements to top-up pension funds
when they appear to be insufﬁcient to meet projected liabilities (pension payments). In addition
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
220

to the risks Accounting Standard FRS17,issued in 2001,meant that changes in pension fund assets
would impact on company accounts.This potentially increases the problems,for companies,of falls
in stock market prices.
In the UK the law requires the employer to guarantee the pensions of deﬁned-beneﬁt scheme
members.Employers have the right to wind up a scheme.When a scheme is wound up,the pension
fund is sold and the proceeds are used to buy annuities.The annuities immediately pay an income
to retired members,and provide for future incomes for those who have not yet retired.However
before June 2003 it was legal for an employer to wind up a pension scheme that was underfunded.
Winding up a pension scheme in such a situation was a particular problem for active members
(those who had not yet retired) since the law required that existing pensioners should get ﬁrst
priority in the allocation of funds. In June 2003 the UK government introduced emergency
measures that prevented a solvent company choosing to abandon its pension commitments. A
problem remained where an employer became insolvent when the pension fund was underfunded.
The Pensions Act 2004 established a Pension Protection Fund, which will pay pensions up to
£25,000 p.a. in circumstances where an employer becomes insolvent when the pension scheme
is underfunded. This is in addition to the Pension Compensation Scheme, which provides
compensation when an employer steals assets from the pension fund.The Pension Protection Fund
is funded by a levy on occupational pension schemes.
Before the Pensions Act 2004 the law required that a fund being wound up should be used to
secure the full cost of pensions in payment (i.e.pensions to those who had already retired).Those
still working received a share of what was left over. Someone recently retired received the whole
pension whilst someone about to retire received a (perhaps substantially) reduced pension.The
Pensions Act 2004 sought a fairer distribution of funds.
National Pension Savings Scheme
One of the recommendations of the UK Pensions Commission report of 2005 was the
establishment of a National Pension Savings Scheme for workers not covered by occupational
pension schemes.Workers would be automatically enrolled in the scheme although they would have
the right to opt out. It appears that the UK government is likely to introduce the scheme
(Department for Work and Pensions 2006).
The proposed National Pensions Savings Scheme deals with some of the behavioural ﬁnance
issues concerning pension participation (see Chapter 2 on the psychology of personal investment
decisions; and Ambachtsheer 2007). One issue is that of procrastination, which entails people
persistently delaying participation in a scheme with the effect that membership occurs late in a
person’s working life if at all.Automatic enrolment deals with this problem.
Another behavioural problem is bad decision-making in relation to investment choices.Although
there is evidence that many people choose a default option, many people make inappropriate
investment decisions. For example myopic risk-aversion (concern with short-term risk when an
investment is long term) could cause participants to choose ‘low risk’ bank or building society
deposits,which yield very low returns.More balanced portfolios,inclusive of ‘risky’stock market
investments,offer much higher rates of return (see Chapter 3 on interest rates and money market
investments for an indication of the prospective differences in rates of return). Other investors
could move between investment alternatives in counterproductive ways. For example there is
PENSIONS
221

evidence that many people move between investment alternatives too frequently,thereby incurring
high transaction costs. Furthermore individual investors have a tendency to buy when prices are
high (after a period of rising prices) and sell when prices are low (following a period of falling
prices).It appears likely that the scheme managers would make investment choices for participants,
thereby preventing scheme members from making behavioural errors (Chapter 2 on the psychology
of personal investment decisions details many of the thought patterns that lead to investment
errors).

KEY CONCLUSIONS OF THE FIRST REPORT –
‘PENSIONS: CHALLENGES AND CHOICES’ (2004)
Chapter 1: The demographic challenge
and unavoidable choices
Life expectancy is increasing rapidly and will continue to do so. This is good news. But combined
with a forecast low birth rate this will produce a near doubling in the percentage of the population
aged 65 years and over between now and 2050, with further increase thereafter. The baby boom
has delayed the effect of underlying long-term trends, but will now produce 30 years of very rapid
increase in the dependency ratio. We must now make adjustments to public policy and/or individual
behaviour which ideally should have been started in the last 20–30 years.
Faced with the increasing proportion of the population aged over 65, society and individuals
must choose between four options. Either:
(i) pensioners will become poorer relative to the rest of society; or
(ii) taxes/National Insurance contributions devoted to pensions must rise; or
(iii) savings must rise; or
(iv) average retirement ages must rise.
But the ﬁrst option (poorer pensioners) appears unattractive; and there are signiﬁcant barriers
to solving the problem through any one of the other three options alone. Some mix of higher
taxes/National Insurance contributions, higher savings, and later average retirement is required.

PENSION TRANSFERS AND PENSION UNLOCKING
Employees with occupational pensions have three possibilities when leaving the employer. First,
the pension could be left where it is.This is known as a preserved or deferred pension.The individual
can then draw the pension at pension age. In the UK the law requires that the value of a deferred

pension should rise in line with inﬂation (as measured by the Retail Prices Index) up to 2.5% p.a.
This is known as limited price indexation.
A second possibility is to transfer the pension to another company scheme.This would be the
scheme operated by the individual’s new employer.A third alternative would be to take a transfer
to a personal pension.A problem with these two possibilities is that the transfer value of the pension
rights may not reﬂect their full value.
Pension unlocking involves the transfer of (normally deferred) deﬁned-beneﬁt pension rights
to a personal pension.The individual then immediately draws the pension, inclusive of the cash
lump sum.Pension unlocking has been criticised by regulators (the Financial Services Authority).
Taking a pension early can substantially reduce the size of the annual pension.The reduction is
even greater if the ﬁrm arranging the pension unlocking takes a large commission payment (as is
usually the case).
PENSION FUNDS
One means of accumulating assets whilst enjoying tax breaks is to invest in a pension fund. In the
UK,contributions to a pension fund are deductible against income tax.The investments in a pension
fund accumulate free of capital gains tax.The income from bonds, cash, and property within a
pension fund is free of tax. Dividends from shares within the fund do not attract any tax liability
beyond the basic rate, which is assumed to have been paid (a ﬁrm’s payment of corporation tax is
deemed to preclude shareholders from the requirement to pay tax at the basic rate).
Before April 2006 there were limitations as to how much could be paid into a pension plan each
ﬁnancial year. In the case of personal pension plans the limit varied between 17.5% and 40% of
earned income; the percentage rising with age.There was also an upper limit to the income that
could be used as a basis for contributions into a personal pension fund (this upper limit was about
4.5 times average earnings).From April 2006 the whole of a person’s earned income in a year was
eligible for tax-deductible pension contributions (i.e. the entire income could be invested in a
pension fund) but with annual and lifetime limits.The initial annual ceiling on tax-deductible
contributions was £215,000.The initial lifetime limit was £1,500,000. If the pension fund at
retirement were to exceed the lifetime ceiling, there would be tax penalties. It is intended that
the limits will rise over time, for example the lifetime limit is due to rise to £1,800,000 by the
2010–11 tax year.
Before April 2006,the maximum that an employee could pay into an employer’s pension scheme
was 15% of income (salary plus bonus). If the employee paid less than 15%, that employee
was able to make payments into an AVC (additional voluntary contribution) fund so long as the total
of the two payments did not exceed 15% of income.The AVC payments could be paid into the
pension fund arranged by the employer, or into a fund operated by another provider (such as an
insurance company).Employees whose pensions were not payable from the proceeds of investment
funds (for example civil servants, teachers, and armed forces personnel have their pensions
paid from general taxation) could also pay into AVCs, so long as their total pension contributions
were not more than 15% of income. AVC payments are tax deductible (they are subtracted
from income when tax is assessed) and AVC funds attract the same tax advantages as other pension
funds. As a result of the Pensions Act 2004, from April 2006 the sum of occupational pension
contributions and AVC payments (and any other pension contributions) was subject to the same
PENSIONS
223

limits as all other pension schemes.From that date all UK private pension schemes became subject
to the same rules.
Personal pensions are usually tax-advantaged wrappers in which institutional investments,such
as unit trusts, are held.The pension plan is a legal and administrative arrangement for holding an
investment fund, which is usually managed by an institutional investor such as an insurance
company.In the UK there is an alternative to institutional investments.The alternative is the Self-
Invested Personal Pension (SIPP).SIPPs allow policyholders to manage their own funds.SIPPs may
contain both institutional investments and directly held shares and bonds. Property may also be
held within a SIPP.Rent and capital gains from the property would be tax-free within the SIPP fund.
ACCUMULATION OF PENSION FUNDS
Tables 11.1 and 11.2 illustrate the result of investing £1,000 a year in a pension fund.They show
how pension funds accumulate over differing periods and at varying rates of growth of the pension
fund.The number of years is shown vertically and the average rates of investment growth, as
percentages per annum,are shown horizontally.It can be seen that the effects of increased periods,
and increased rates of growth, are dramatic.The combination of a long period with a high rate of
growth is particularly striking.The tables also demonstrate the effects of management charges.
A charge by the fund manager of 2% p.a.may not sound much,but it has a huge effect on the ﬁnal
value of the fund.The effect of the management charge becomes increasingly dramatic with long
periods and high rates of growth.
The sensitivity of the ﬁnal outcome to the period of time, over which pension contributions
are paid, indicates the desirability of starting pension contributions early in life. For example in
Table 11.1 it can be seen that with 6% growth,someone starting contributions 20 years late (e.g.

could be obtained from £1,000 per year over 40 years ([£154,758/£36,785]  £1,000 
£4,207.10).
The sensitivity of the ﬁnal pension fund to differences in growth rates shows the level of
uncertainty involved. It also indicates the risk taken by companies offering ﬁnal-salary schemes.
A lower than expected rate of growth can leave the company with a substantial shortfall to make
up.This helps to explain why so many employers are closing ﬁnal-salary pension schemes to new
employees, and replacing them with money-purchase (deﬁned-contribution) pension schemes.
With money-purchase pension schemes,it is the employee rather than the employer who runs the
risk of low investment returns.
EVIDENCE ON THE RATE OF GROWTH OF PENSION FUNDS
There has been research on the performance of pension funds,with a particular focus on whether
actively managed or index tracker funds provide the highest prospective returns for the equity
component of pension funds.Much of the relevant evidence comes from research on mutual funds.
For example Wermers (2000) found that although gross returns from actively managed equity
funds outperform a broad stock market index by 1.3% p.a.,the net fund returns underperformed
by 1% p.a.The 2.3% difference arose because actively managed funds had high management costs,
high share-trading costs, and held part of the fund in (low-yielding) cash and bonds. Drew and
Stanford (2001) found that the average actively managed equity pension fund underperformed a
benchmark by about 0.5–1.0% p.a. Malkiel and Radisich (2001) found that the average actively
managed fund produced rates of return 1–2% p.a.less than index tracker funds,partly because of
fund management fees and partly because of trading costs.
Although actively managed funds, on average, may underperform the question remains as to
whether some funds persistently perform strongly so that investors (or their advisers) can choose
the funds that will perform well in the future.There is evidence from studies of mutual funds to
indicate that there is some persistence in the relative performance of actively managed funds (Bal
and Leger 1996; Elton et al. 1996a; Stewart 1998; Carpenter and Lynch 1999). However these
studies indicate only a short-run persistence in relative performance of one to three years.Other
studies (Carhart 1997; Cheng et al. 1999) found that there was no persistence of relative fund
performance. Drew et al. (2002) found that choosing the pension funds that had performed best
in the past was of no use for the purpose of obtaining high relative performance in the future.They
found that the market index tended to outperform actively managed pension funds.They concluded
that a fund’s track record was not a useful guide to fund selection and investors would be best
advised to invest in index tracker funds.Bogle (1992) and Malkiel (1995) had also concluded that
the best strategy for investors was to choose index tracker funds.
ANNUITIES
Annuities are guaranteed incomes.They may be for speciﬁc periods, for example ten years. More
frequently the income is guaranteed for the life of the holder.They are often used for pension
purposes. Upon retirement a person would buy an annuity and thereby guarantee a retirement
income payable until death. Once the annuity is taken out it cannot be changed.The buyer of the
PENSIONS
225

annuity also needs to be aware that the money used to buy the annuity is not usually refundable. If
someone dies immediately after buying an annuity, the money used to buy the annuity is normally
lost.However it is possible to buy a guarantee,which ensures that the annuity is paid for a minimum
period such as ﬁve or ten years from the date of purchase.This ensures that the annuity is not wholly
lost if death occurs within the period of the guarantee, but there is a cost in the form of a reduced
annuity rate. Since April 2006 value protection annuities have been available.Value protection
annuities guarantee a lifetime income but also pay a lump sum if death occurs before the age of 75.
This potential lump-sum payment comes at the cost of a lower lifetime income (lower annuity rate).
Annuities can be looked upon as a form of insurance.Annuities that pay an income for the rest
of a person’s life insure the individual against the possibility of outliving the money set aside for
retirement.As with other forms of insurance,risk is pooled so that there are both gainers and losers.
The pooling mechanism uses the funds of those who die early to subsidise the income of those who
live longer than average.There is a ‘mortality cross-subsidy’whereby those who die young subsidise
those who live long lives.
When an annuity is taken out, an annuity rate is stipulated. For example an annuity rate of 7%
p.a.means that a payment of £100,000 secures an annual income of £7,000 per year.Annuity rates
vary with age, sex, and sometimes also the health of the individual.The annuity rate will improve
as the age at which the annuity is undertaken increases. Since an older person has a shorter life
expectancy,the annuity provider would expect to pay the income over fewer years.The prospective
shorter period allows for increased annual payouts.Since women have longer life expectancies than
men,annuity rates tend to be lower for women than for men.Existing health problems that could
shorten life might entail higher annuity rates.The same is true for lifestyle factors such as smoking.
When calculating the annuity rate, the insurance company will estimate the number of years
that the person will live. For this purpose an average life expectancy is estimated, and each
individual is treated as if they will die at the expected age.The insurance company assumes that it
will return the individual’s capital over the number of years it expects the person to live.In addition
there would be some interest on the capital, typically based on the yield of government bonds
(annuity funds are typically invested in government bonds).The interest will decline over time
because the capital is progressively returned to the individual.
Where a person has a lower than average life expectancy,it may be possible to obtain an ‘enhanced
rate annuity’ or an ‘impaired life annuity’. Enhanced rate annuities are available for people with
moderately reduced life expectancies (e.g.reduced by an average of ﬁve years in the case of smokers).
Such people would include smokers, the obese, and diabetics. In such cases the annual annuity
income may be enhanced by,perhaps,10% or 20%.Impaired life annuities are available for people
with very serious conditions. Impaired life annuities can provide very large enhancements, for
example inoperable cancer may be associated with a six-fold increase in the annual annuity income.
Wealth also affects longevity (life expectancy); rich people live longer than poor people. So
insurance companies give richer people lower annuity rates. Insurance companies tend to look at
the size of the pension fund in order to ascertain relative wealth (Budden 2006). Large pension
funds will attract lower annuity rates.An insurance company may have several trigger points at
which annuity rates are reduced.As the size of the pension fund increases beyond a trigger point
the annuity rate is reduced. Longevity is also affected by the region in which the annuitant lives.
Life expectancy is greater in some parts of the country when compared to others.Higher annuity
rates could be paid in regions with relatively low life expectancies.

Annuities as Pensions
When used as a pension, an annuity is a regular payment made by an insurance company for the
rest of the pensioner’s life in return for a pension fund.The pension fund would have been built
up over the working life of the pensioner.The annuity payments will depend upon the size of the
pension fund available for the purchase of the annuity.The annuity payments will also depend upon
the rates of yield available from government bonds at the time that the annuity is purchased.
Annuities normally invest in government bonds (gilts).The annuity payments to the pensioner
arise partly from the yield on the government bonds,and partly from the repayment of the initial
purchase price of the annuity.The purchase price of the annuity is returned to the pensioner over
time at a rate that would return the entire sum by the (actuarially) expected date of death.Insurance
company statisticians (actuaries) determine the expected date of death.
Conventional annuities pay the same sum of money each year until death (they are called level
annuities).The real value of the income (value in terms of purchasing power) will fall over time
as prices rise. It is possible to buy annuities that are inﬂation-proofed (index-linked). In that case
the insurance company would fund the annuity using index-linked gilts.Alternatively an escalating
annuity might be chosen such that the annuity income rises by a set percentage each year, for
example 3% p.a. An index-linked annuity, or a 3% escalating annuity, might reduce the initial
annuity income by about one-third.
To the extent that the annuity payments depend on the yields on government bonds,potential
pensioners face a high degree of uncertainty.Yields on government bonds can vary considerably
over time.In consequence annuity rates can change substantially from year to year.If a person retires
in a year in which annuity rates are relatively low, that person suffers a low pension for the rest of
his or her life.The system of obtaining a pension by buying an annuity at retirement involves a
considerable amount of risk.The size of the pension depends upon when this occurs. Retirement
at a time when government bond yields are low results in a low pension.
Booth and Wood (2000) made the point that a historically low annuity rate does not necessarily
mean that the annuitant is disadvantaged.It depends upon why the bond yields,which determine
the annuity rates, are low. Interest rates, and bond yields, can be divided into real rates and
compensation for expected inﬂation (see Chapter 3 on interest rates and money market investments
for the distinction between nominal and real interest rates).If bond yields are low because expected
inﬂation is low, and if the expectation of low inﬂation subsequently proves to be accurate, the
apparently low annuity rates are low only in money terms.The difference between historically high
and historically low annuity rates would be one of the distribution of future real payments over
time rather than average levels.
Booth and Wood (2000) provided a numerical example,which contrasted a situation of 3% p.a.
real yield and 6% p.a. expected inﬂation (producing 9.2% p.a. nominal yield) with a situation of
3% p.a. real yield and 2.5% p.a. expected inflation (a 5.6% p.a. nominal yield). In the ﬁrst
circumstance the sum of £98,205 bought a level annuity of £10,000 p.a. whereas in the second
case the annuity was £7,832 p.a.However inﬂation of 6% p.a.erodes the real (purchasing power)
value of the £10,000 annuity faster than inﬂation of 2.5% p.a.reduces the real value of the £7,832
annuity.Whereas initially the real value of the £10,000 annuity was the higher of the two, Booth
and Wood showed that within eight years the real value of the £7,832 annuity was the greater one.
Thereafter the difference in favour of the £7,832 annuity became progressively greater.
PENSIONS
227

Arguably the risk is not so much whether there will be a low or high annuity rate on the
retirement date as whether the expected rate of inﬂation reﬂected by the annuity rate will be
realised. A subsequent inﬂation rate lower than the rate reﬂected in the annuity rate would be
good for the annuitant whereas if inﬂation turns out to be higher the annuitant would lose.
There is no obligation to buy an annuity from the manager of the pension fund.The ‘open
market option’ allows the policyholder to take the proceeds of the pension fund away from the
fund manager and to buy an annuity from another provider.This is an important facility since the
difference between the best and worst annuity rates can be as much as 25% (e.g. 6% p.a. against
7.5% p.a.). However there could be a penalty charged by the pension fund manager if the money
is transferred to another provider. In the case of occupational money-purchase (deﬁned-
contribution) pension schemes, the trustees of the scheme usually buy the annuities.
People are often reluctant to buy an annuity upon retirement. One reason might be an
underestimation of life expectancy. People will be reluctant to pay for an income for life if they
expect that life to be relatively short.O’Brien et al. (2005) found that,in the UK,on average men
underestimated life expectancy by 4.6 years and women underestimated their life expectancies
by 6 years.As well as underestimating longevity people may also underestimate longevity risk,
which is the risk that their own lifespans will differ signiﬁcantly from the average (Drinkwater and
Sondergeld 2004). Longevity risk makes the insurance dimension of annuities, the annuity cross-
subsidy, important as a means of ensuring that retirees do not outlive their assets.
Concepts from behavioural ﬁnance may also help to explain the reluctance to buy annuities
(Mitchell and Utkus 2006). Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to heavily overweight
the present relative to the future. People prone to hyperbolic discounting dislike any delay in
enjoying their money such that even short postponements of the receipt of income entail heavy
discounting of the future receipt. A ‘live for today’ attitude is a manifestation of hyperbolic
discounting.The possibility that death could occur soon after buying an annuity poses the possibility
of loss. Prospect theory suggests that there is a high loss-aversion, and hence may indicate that
retirees might avoid the possibility of loss by not buying an annuity.However since the loss would
be accompanied by death,the loss would not be painful (loss-aversion is based on the pain of losing
money). If the concern is with passing on wealth to heirs, the purchase of an annuity normally
prevents that inheritance so that the timing of death is not a concern from the perspective of
inheritance.
ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF ANNUITY
Alternatives available to the buyer of an annuity include the level annuity,escalating annuity,index-
linked annuity, with-proﬁts annuity, and unit-linked annuity. A related possibility is an income
drawdown scheme.
A level (or conventional) annuity pays a ﬁxed amount each year for the rest of the person’s life.
An escalating annuity increases the payments by a predetermined percentage each year.The cost
of these annual increases is a lower initial payment relative to a level annuity.Index-linked (inﬂation-
linked) annuities guarantee that the payment rises each year to keep pace with inﬂation, again at
the cost of a lower initial payment compared with a level annuity.Someone who is prepared to delay
the receipt of an annuity (or part of it) may do so.The effect of the delay is to enhance the size of
annuity to be received in later years.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
228

Investment-linked annuities allow the person to beneﬁt from investment returns within a tax-
favoured fund.As with other annuities,the mortality cross-subsidy applies and the fund normally
reverts to the insurance company when the annuitant dies.Some investment-linked annuities allow
the annuitant to convert to a conventional annuity.
A with-proﬁts annuity links the payments to the with-proﬁts fund of an insurance company.
When taking out the annuity, the holder speciﬁes a growth rate for the with-proﬁts fund (an
anticipated bonus rate).A high speciﬁed growth rate implies a relatively large fund over time,and
hence a high level of income that can be drawn from the fund.However if the fund fails to grow at
the speciﬁed rate (the actual annual bonus falls short of the anticipated rate) those withdrawals will
prove to be excessive.The consequence is a smaller fund and a lower income in subsequent years.
If the speciﬁed growth rate is less than the rate actually achieved,the fund size increases as does
the income that can be drawn in future years.A low speciﬁed rate implies an assumption that the
fund will be relatively small in future.This entails a low initial income. If the actual growth rate
turns out to be higher than the speciﬁed rate, the low initial income is less than could have been
paid with the result that the fund becomes larger.This means that future income payments will
exceed the initial payment.
If the speciﬁed growth rate matches the actual annual bonus rate, the fund size and income
would be stable. In addition with-proﬁts annuities may produce terminal bonuses.Typically the
entitlements to terminal bonuses are paid out as they arise. An annuity holder will receive any
entitlement to a terminal bonus, which arises in a year, as an addition to that year’s income.
The regular bonus declared each year has a permanent effect on the income received.This
income will increase if the bonus declared is higher than the anticipated bonus rate
selected by the policyholder or (subject to the minimum income guarantee) decrease if
the bonus declared is lower than the anticipated rate.
An additional bonus may be declared each year which increases the income received
for 12 months only.
(Prudential 2006)
The annual (or regular) bonus rate does not determine the current year’s income from the annuity.
That income is determined by an annuity rate in the same way as other annuities.The annual bonus
rate determines the future growth rate of the annuity fund,and thereby the future growth rate of
the income paid to the policyholder.A with-proﬁts annuity cannot be surrendered (i.e.exchanged
for a cash sum) but typically can be converted to a conventional annuity.
Unit-linked annuities operate in a similar way to with-proﬁts annuities, but are linked to unit
trusts.This entails an additional risk.Unit trust prices can go down as well as up (as opposed to an
investment in a with-proﬁts fund).A consequence is that the income payments can fall as a decline
in unit trust prices pulls down the value of the fund (and hence the potential ﬂow of income that
it can support). Conversely there is a potential for increased income resulting from rising unit
prices. As is normal for investments, the relatively high risk is associated with relatively high
expected returns and hence income levels.There are few unit-linked annuities available.With-
proﬁts annuities tend to be the preferred form of investment-linked annuity because of the
smoothing mechanism that provides some protection against stock market ﬂuctuations.
Investment-linked annuities, either with-proﬁts or unit-linked, will provide a better pension
than conventional annuities if the investment funds produce better returns than gilts.Although
PENSIONS
229

funds that invest in the stock market typically tend to outperform gilts, there is a risk that they
may fail to do so during some periods.
INCOME DRAWDOWN (UNSECURED PENSIONS)
AND PHASED RETIREMENT SCHEMES
With-proﬁts and unit-linked annuities may be attractive to pensioners who face low annuity rates
at retirement due to low yields on government bonds.Another alternative for such pensioners is
to use income drawdown (alternatively known as an unsecured pension).This enables people to
defer buying an annuity whilst drawing an income from their pension fund.
The pensioner leaves the pension fund invested but takes part of the fund each year as an income.
The amount that is taken each year is subject to upper and lower limits. Between 0% and 130%
of an income benchmark can be withdrawn each year.The income benchmark is approximately
equal to the annual annuity that could have been purchased with the money.
The pensioner can choose to use the fund to buy an annuity when annuity rates are judged to
be satisfactory.A fall in the value of the investments held by the pension fund would reduce the
income available from exercising the drawdown.Also an implication of the absence of the mortality
cross-subsidy is that there is a risk that the fund will be exhausted before death.
Income drawdown is useful for people who would like their pension fund to pass to their heirs
upon death. Prior to the purchase of an annuity, there is no loss through funds being retained by
the insurance company at death in order to ﬁnance the mortality cross-subsidy.Income drawdown
avoids the risk that the pension fund might be lost as a result of death shortly after retirement. In
the event of death the remainder of the pension fund becomes part of the person’s estate (subject
to a tax deduction).Another means of avoiding the loss of the whole pension fund upon death is
the use of phased retirement.
Under phased retirement a person vests only part of the pension fund each year. Many
personal pension funds are segmented (clustered) with the effect that it is possible to use some of
the segments to buy annuities whilst leaving the remainder in the pension fund. For each
segment vested, 25% can be taken as tax-free cash.The tax-free cash received each year upon
vesting some segments becomes part of the income stream generated by phased retirement.Any
segments of the pension fund that remain unvested at the time of death are part of the estate that
is inherited by the heirs.Phased retirement is subject to the risk that the unvested segments of the
pension fund would fall in value in the event of a stock market downturn.Such a fall would reduce
the income generated through the phased retirement. However it could be seen as less risky than
using the whole pension fund to buy an annuity at a single point in time since that point in time
may prove to be one at which pension funds and/or annuity rates are low.Phasing the purchase of
annuities avoids the risk that the chosen single point in time may prove to be particularly
unfavourable.
Before 6 April 2006 retirees who used income drawdown or phased retirement had to use their
pension funds to buy an annuity by the age of 75. Since 6 April 2006 it has been possible to use an
ASP (Alternatively Secured Pension).This is similar to income drawdown without age limit.The
portion of the pension fund that remains upon death is available to be passed to heirs, but there
are restrictive limits to the amount of income that can be drawn each year.The maximum that can
be withdrawn each year is 70% of an income benchmark (which reﬂects the income available from
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
230

buying a level annuity).At the time of writing the UK government was looking at ways of restricting
the availability of Alternatively Secured Pensions.
Unsecured pensions (income drawdown schemes) and Alternatively Secured Pensions pose
questions concerning the appropriate form of investment.Low growth investments (such as bank
deposits) combined with drawdown near to the maximum could lead to a depletion of the fund
over time. Riskier investments could entail an abrupt fall in the value of the pension fund and the
income from it.
APPLYING THE PRINCIPLE OF DIVERSIFICATION
Someone with a very large pension fund could use a mixture of annuities and arrangements.Every
annuity and arrangement has its advantages and drawbacks. An individual may ﬁnd that a
combination is most suitable.For example a mixture of conventional and inﬂation-linked annuities
may be used to provide a core income with some protection against inflation.This could be
combined with an investment-linked annuity to provide some scope for real income growth.Part
of the fund could be used for drawdown and/or phased retirement in order to provide something
for heirs.A combination would constitute a portfolio of retirement incomes and portfolios tend
to reduce risk. Every annuity and arrangement has risks (even inﬂation-linked annuities bear the
risk that the income will fail to keep pace with rising standards of living, whereas investment-
linked annuities might help the income to do so).A portfolio would tend to dampen the effects of
particular types of risk. Retirees with occupational pensions plus AVCs could consider the
diversiﬁcation dimension when deciding how to use the AVC funds. Using the AVC to buy an
annuity that is of the same type as that provided by the employer may not be the best strategy.
CALCULATING A LEVEL ANNUITY
The calculation of an annuity rate can be illustrated by the following example. Someone has a
pension fund of £100,000.The actuarial expectation is that the person will live for another ten
years. If the ten-year interest rate (yield on government bonds) is 8.5% p.a., how much can be
paid to the pensioner each year? The ﬁrst payment is to take place one year from the present.
The annuity equation is:
p  M/ [{1 (1r)T} / r]
where p is the annual income, M is the size of the pension fund, r is the relevant rate of
(redemption) yield on government bonds, and T is the period for which the annuity is expected
to be paid.
p  100,000 / [{1 (1.085)10 } / 0.085]
p  £15,240.77
An annual income of £15,240.77 can be paid to the pensioner.
It can be noted that a mortgage is equivalent to a negative annuity.An annuity entails the initial
payment of a lump sum, and a subsequent series of cash receipts.A mortgage involves the initial
receipt of a lump sum (which is typically used to buy a property), and a subsequent series of cash

231

payments.This equivalence of annuities and mortgages implies that the annuity equation can be
used for the purpose of calculating mortgage payments.
There is a related equation for the calculation of the ﬁnal sum to be expected from a series of
cash payments.The accumulation of a pension fund may entail periodic payments into an investment
scheme.The equation for the expected ﬁnal value of the pension fund to be generated by those
payments is:
M  p.[(1  r)T 1]/r
where M is the expected ﬁnal sum of money, p is the periodic payment into the fund, r is the
average rate of return on the fund, and T is the length of time for which the payments are made.

EXERCISE 11.2
A person has an annual income of £20,000,of which £2,500 each year is invested in a pension fund.
The contributions to the fund are made over 40 years, and the average rate of return on the fund
is 5% p.a. in real terms (i.e. allowing for inﬂation).The expected life expectancy at retirement is
20 years.The real rate of return on government bonds at the time of retirement is 2.5% p.a.What
annual pension should the person receive?
Answer
The ﬁrst step is to calculate the expected value of the pension fund at the end of the 40 years
during which contributions are made.
M  p.[(1  r)T 1]/r
M  £2,500 [(1.05)40 1] / 0.05
M  £302,000
The next step is to calculate the annuity payments to be expected from that sum of money.
p  M/ [{1 (1r)T } / r]
p  £302,000/[{1  (1.025)20 }/0.025]
p  £19,372
The annual pension is £19,372.
COMPANY PENSION SCHEME BALANCE SHEETS
Final-salary (deﬁned-beneﬁt) pension schemes pay a pension based on the salary at retirement and
the number of years worked for the employer. Since the year 2000 many UK companies have
withdrawn ﬁnal-salary pension schemes, at least for new employees.To understand why that has
happened it is useful to look at the composition of company pension scheme balance sheets.Table
11.3 depicts a hypothetical balance sheet.
As for liabilities the ‘current liability’is the present value of prospective future payments based
on current,or ﬁnal,salaries and number of years served to date.The pension beneﬁciaries include
existing pensioners, existing employees, and past employees with paid-up pension rights.The
calculation of the current liability is based on ﬁnal salary (or, in the case of existing employees,
current salary), years of service (up to the present), predicted lifespans (based on actuarial
statistics), and the rate of discount chosen to convert future values into a present value.
Since existing employees may experience salary increases prior to retirement, their pension
rights can be expected to rise in consequence.The item ‘liability in respect of future salary increases’
is the present value of the additional pension arising as a result of future salary increases.Added
together,‘current liability’ and ‘liability in respect of future salary increases’ amount to ‘accrued
PENSIONS
233

liability for past service’. The ‘current liability’ is alternatively known as the ‘accumulated
beneﬁt obligation’ and ‘accrued liability for past service’ is alternatively known as the ‘projected
benefit obligation’. Inclusion of ‘liability in respect of future salary increases’ is controversial
because these additional pension costs will be realised only if the employees continue to work for
the employer.
Pension rights will also increase as a result of the number of years served rising with the
passage of time. The item ‘future service liability’ is the present value of the expected
increase in pension payments brought about by prospective increases in the number of years of
employment.
On the asset side of the balance sheet,the ‘pension fund’is a portfolio of investments;it is likely
to include bonds, shares, cash, and property.The investments may be valued at market prices but
could be given valuations that aim to smooth out market fluctuations. Any such smoothing is
referred to as actuarial smoothing.For example instead of the full value of an increase in share prices
being accredited to the pension fund in the year of the rise, only 20% might be allocated in that
year with four further 20% tranches being credited in each of the following four years. If the
pension fund is less than ‘accrued liability for past service’,there is an ‘unfunded liability’.It is the
purpose of the pension fund to meet the ‘accrued liability for past service’.
The other item on the asset side of the balance sheet is the present value of contributions
for future service.These are contributions,to which the company is committed,to meet the ‘future
service liability’. Since it is a commitment, it is treated as an asset despite the fact that the
actual payments have not yet been made. (For the same reason ‘unfunded liability’ appears
as an asset. The employer has a commitment to pay this sum and effectively owes it to the
pension fund.)
Pension funds have tended to invest heavily in shares and property.This is partly because of the
long-run return potential of shares,and the fact that long-term investing allows some amelioration
of risk due to periods of good performance offsetting periods of poor investment returns.It is also
because deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes are usually linked to salary or price levels (salary levels up to
retirement and price levels after retirement). Such linking provides inﬂation protection to the
beneﬁciaries of deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes.The pension fund managers thus invest in assets that
provide protection against inflation: shares and property. Asset-liability management requires
assets that match the risks produced by liabilities that are measured in real terms, as opposed to

nominal (money) terms. Since the cash ﬂows from bonds are usually speciﬁed in nominal terms,
bonds are not ideal for matching liabilities that are determined in real terms.
During the stock market downturn of 2000–3, many company pension schemes became
underfunded.The fall in share prices reduced the value of pension funds and created unfunded
liabilities.In some cases the risk of becoming underfunded caused pension fund trustees to switch
from shares to bonds in order to guarantee the pension funds’ability to meet the ‘accrued liability
for past service’.Another reason for the emergence of underfunding was the fall in the rates of
yield on bonds. Bonds are important for the ﬁnancing of pension liabilities once employees have
retired. If bond yields fall more bond investment is needed and the difference in size between the
pension fund accumulated, and the pension fund required, is increased. Unfunded liabilities
imposed increased pension contribution commitments on companies.They were black holes in
pension schemes, and needed to be ﬁlled from company proﬁts. In order to reduce the risk that
underfunding would occur in the future,many companies closed their ﬁnal-salary pension schemes
to new employees. Over time this is likely to bring about a further switch from shares to bonds,
in deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes, as pension schemes mature.The maturity of a pension scheme is
measured by the ratio of retired to active members. If a scheme is closed to new members it will
steadily mature as active members retire. As schemes mature fund managers tend to rebalance
portfolios from shares towards bonds.
In the UK the Pensions Act 1995 required a minimum funding requirement (MFR) to be met.
If assets were less than 90% of liabilities, the shortfall must be made up within one year. If assets
were less than 100% of liabilities, the shortfall must be made up within ﬁve years. If assets were
not well in excess of liabilities,the MFR encouraged funds to move towards less risky investments
(typically from shares to bonds).The employer normally underwrites the liabilities of a ﬁnal-salary
occupational pension scheme.The employer makes good any deﬁciency by topping up the fund.
MFR did not work well and the Pensions Act 2004 replaced it with a ‘scheme-speciﬁc funding
requirement’.
In addition to meeting any unfunded liabilities,companies are faced with ‘normal costs’.‘Normal
costs’are the costs to be paid by the company in respect of additional pension liabilities that emerge
with the passage of time.Actuaries use several methods to estimate ‘normal cost’. One approach
is to estimate how much would need to be invested now to provide for any beneﬁts that have been
earned during the year.If the employees are young relatively little needs to be invested since there
is a long time for the investments to grow in value,but if employees are close to retirement larger
sums must be invested because of the short time available for investment growth.This means that
the ‘normal costs’tend to rise over time.Often actuaries prefer to even out the ﬂow of contributions
by way of constant annual money payments, or paying a constant percentage of the wage bill.
The values that appear in a pension scheme balance sheet are subject to a large amount of
judgement. One ﬁgure that is very dependent on judgement, and which can make a considerable
difference to balance sheet values, is the discount rate used to ascertain the present value of the
projected pension payments.Another number that requires a substantial input of judgement is the
expected rate of increase in salaries.
In the UK the funds of a pension scheme are kept separate from those of the employer by being
placed in a trust. A trust is a legal relationship whereby assets are placed under the control of
trustees.The trustees have to ensure that the pension fund is managed in accordance with the
terms of a trust deed.

LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS OF PENSION FUNDING
Computer software models exist for estimating the level of saving (as a percentage of earnings)
required for a pension.The relevant variables (determining factors) are:
The required pension as a percentage of pre-retirement income.
Whether the required pension is measured in money or real terms.
The expected period of retirement (based on the expected retirement age and actuarial projections
of longevity).
The period over which pension fund contributions will be paid.
The expected real rate of return on investments prior to retirement.
The expected rate of return on the investments that fund the annuity payments.
The amount of the pension requirement provided by state beneﬁts.
The amount of the pension requirement provided by existing personal and occupational pension
rights.
Two approaches to determining the desirable level of retirement income are:(1) using a proportion
of pre-retirement income,for example planning for a pension that is two-thirds of pre-retirement
income, and (2) planning for a pension that maintains the pre-retirement standard of living.The
method of calculation differs between the two approaches.
Fixing a Proportion of Pre-retirement Income
The calculations in this case involve two stages.First,the size of the pension fund required for the
retirement income is calculated using the annuity equation. Second, the level of annual saving
required to produce that pension fund is calculated using the endowment equation.
The annuity equation is:
p  M/ [{1 (1r)T } / r]
where p is the annual income, M is the size of the pension fund, r is the relevant rate of
(redemption) yield on government bonds, and T is the period for which the annuity is expected
to be paid.
The equation for an endowment is:
p  (M  y)/[(1  y)t 1]
where p is the annual investment, M is the sum to be accumulated, y is the expected rate of
return on the endowment fund, and t is the number of years until retirement.
It is to be noted that the expected retirement lifespan is an actuarial average.The individual is
assumed to live for the average period. Some people live for longer, and others for shorter,
retirement periods.Since a life assurance company provides annuities (pensions) for a large number
of people, it can assume that those living shorter lives balance those living longer lives. In effect
those that die before the average retirement period subsidise those that live longer lives.This allows
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
236

the life assurance company to calculate each person’s pension fund requirement on the basis of an
average retirement lifespan.

237
EXAMPLE 11.1
Suppose that someone expects to earn £30,000 a year for the next 40 years and anticipates
20 years of retirement. Further assume that the person expects zero real interest (interest net of
inflation). How much should be saved for retirement on two-thirds income?
Answer
The person needs £400,000 at retirement in order to fund £20,000 a year for 20 years. In order
to accumulate £400,000 the person must save £10,000 a year for the 40 years of work.
It can be noted that the level of expenditure (consumption) in this case is the same before, and
after, retirement. In other words this rate of saving achieves not only the desired proportion of
income but also the maintenance of a constant level of consumption (a constant standard of
living). There is a permanent income of £20,000 p.a.
EXAMPLE 11.2
Consider the case in Example 11.1 but with an expected real rate of interest of 5% p.a.
The annuity equation:
£20,000  M/[{1  (1.05)20 }/0.05]
should be solved for M.
£20,000  [{1  (1.05)20 }/0.05]  M
M  £249,244
The sum of £249,244 needs to be accumulated.
The next step is to ﬁnd the rate of saving that would achieve that sum.
The endowment equation needs to be solved for p.
p  [ £249,244  0.05 ] / [(1.05)40 1]
p  £2,063
It can be seen from these two examples that a rate of return on the invested funds makes a
considerable difference to the amount that must be saved.With zero real interest £10,000 a year
needs to be saved, with 5% p.a. real interest the required annual saving is just £2,063.

Fixing a Constant Consumption Stream
If the aim is to have the same standard of living in retirement as before,the calculations should seek
to ensure that the level of expenditure (consumption) could be maintained into retirement.The
calculation involves equating the present value of expected income with the present value of
planned expenditure.The constant level of expenditure (consumption) calculated in this way is
sometimes referred to as ‘permanent income’ (Friedman 1957).The equation is:
C/(1  r)t  Yt/(1  r)t
(1)
C is the constant expenditure per annum (permanent income) throughout the lifetime of the
individual.Yt is the level of (after tax) income in period t.Yt is not necessarily the same in every
period.The rate at which the cash ﬂows are discounted to the present is shown by r.
EXERCISE 11.3
Suppose that someone expects to earn £30,000 a year for 40 years, and then to have 20 years of
retirement.
What would be that person’s permanent income if interest rates were expected to be 5% p.a.?
Answer
C/(1  r)t  Yt/(1  r)t
These can be treated as two annuities, and the annuity equation can be rewritten as:
M  p  [{1  (1  r)T }/r]
where M is the present value of the annuity.
With an interest rate of 5% p.a., equating the present values of the two annuities gives:
C[{1  (1.05)60 }/0.05]  £30,000[{1  (1.05)40 }/0.05]
Solving for C gives:
C  £30,000 
C  £30,000 
C  £30,000 
 £30,000  0.9064833  £27,194.5
The person has a permanent income of £27,194.5; in other words the income of £30,000 a
year for 40 years can ﬁnance consumption at £27,194.5 a year for 60 years. By saving

£30,000  £27,194.5  £2,805.5 a year whilst working,the level of expenditure enjoyed during
the person’s working life can be maintained during retirement.The annual level of consumption
of £27,194.5 is achieved both during the working life and in retirement.
This permanent income approach is challenged by evidence that many people fail to maintain their
consumption levels into retirement.Banks et al. (1998) found that many people experienced a drop
in consumption at retirement.This evidence suggests that it is often the case that people do not
save enough to smooth consumption levels over their lifetimes, with the effect that their living
standards fall when they retire.
Variations on the Basic Equation
The basic equation can be varied in order to encompass real life circumstances.For example suppose
that an individual expects a state pension in addition to his/her own provision. Equation 1 would
be amended as follows:
 C/(1  r)t  Yt/(1  r)t   Pt/(1  r)t
Pt is the expected state pension in year t (Pt will be zero prior to the state retirement age).
ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF DELAYING PENSION FUND CONTRIBUTIONS
Byrne et al. (2006) estimated the effects of delaying the start date for contributions to a deﬁned-
contribution pension scheme in the UK. Realistic assumptions were made about the pattern of
earnings during a person’s lifetime, about the prospective growth rates of pension funds, and of
annuity rates available at retirement.The outcomes were measured in terms of replacement rates,
deﬁned as level annuities as a proportion of income immediately prior to retirement.It was assumed
that retirement occurs at age 65 and that 10% of income is contributed to the pension fund (which
is about average).Table 11.4 selects some ﬁgures,for men,from the study.Two of the investment

alternatives used in the study were 100% equities (shares) and a life-cycle fund, which invests
1  age (1 minus the person’s current age) in equities and the remainder in bonds.Table 11.5
provides ﬁgures for women who take a career break.
A few points need to be noted.The pensions are level annuities,which are not index-linked and
hence are susceptible to erosion by inﬂation.The replacement ratios are averages (medians) of
distributions of possible outcomes.The dispersions of those distributions are greater for the 100%
equity funds than for the life-cycle funds.
CONCLUSION
As in other developed countries,the population of the UK is ageing.The ratio of retired people to
those of working age is increasing.Future governments,and taxpayers,are unlikely to be able and
willing to ﬁnance generous state pensions. Employers are also showing increased reluctance to
provide substantial pensions.Pension provision is increasingly the responsibility of the individual.
Pension funds are institutional (collective) investments but differ from other institutional
investments, such as unit trusts, in important ways. First they are very long term.A UK resident
starting work at the age of 21, for example, faces the prospect of retiring at the age of 68 or later.
Payments into pension funds could occur over 47 years or more.The length of the investment
period has implications for the type of asset within the pension fund. It also implies that it is
particularly important to avoid high fund charges. It was seen in Chapter 9 on mutual funds that
high fund charges have a devastating effect on the long-term accumulation of capital.
A second distinguishing feature is that pension fund accumulation is a necessity. The
accumulation of money through unit trusts could strongly enhance future purchasing power, and
is thus very desirable.However the accumulation of funds for retirement is essential;it is required
for the avoidance of poverty in old age. This has implications for the form of pension fund
investment. Pension fund investments, particularly as a person approaches retirement, should
avoid excessive risk.The pension fund investor should ensure that an adequate retirement income
is guaranteed.The risk of an inadequate pension should be avoided.
The avoidance of high charges would lead an investor towards index tracker funds since such
funds typically beneﬁt from low charges.However most index tracker funds are invested in shares,
and only in shares.This is risky. It is important, especially as retirement is being approached, to

hold a balanced portfolio that provides diversiﬁcation of risk (see Chapter 13 on portfolio
diversiﬁcation).Such a fund would hold bonds,property,and cash as well as shares.Even in relation
to the component of a pension fund invested in shares, index tracker funds may not provide
optimum diversiﬁcation. For example, in the UK, the largest ten companies account for
approximately half the total value of the stock market.So a small number of companies dominate
stock indices, and the index funds that track the stock indices.
An implication is that,although index tracker funds have cost advantages over actively managed
funds (and also have slightly higher expected returns on average – as indicated in Chapters 9 and
17 on mutual funds and on the evaluation of fund management,respectively,and Part 7 on market
efﬁciency),there is still an important role for fund managers and ﬁnancial advisers.Index tracker
funds do not answer the question of how a fund should be allocated between asset classes (i.e.
between shares, bonds, property, cash, etc.).There is also a decision to be made in respect to
which index, or indices, should be tracked. For example in the UK a ﬁnancial adviser, or pension
trustee, may choose not to invest in a fund that tracks the FTSE All-Share Index on the grounds
that the index is dominated by a small number of companies and hence may not provide the best
diversiﬁcation.Investing part of the money in a fund that tracks the FTSE 250,and part in a FTSE
All-Share tracker, might be a solution.The FTSE 250 covers the 250 companies that are next in
size below the FTSE 100 (which covers the 100 largest UK companies). By putting some of the
equity (share) investment into a fund that tracks the FTSE 250,the pension fund manager reduces
the unbalancing effect of the dominance of very large companies.
Studies in behavioural ﬁnance have found that people tend to procrastinate when thinking about
pension investment,with the effect that the start of pension investment can be excessively delayed.
In fact studies in neuroﬁnance have suggested that the human brain ﬁnds it unnatural to plan so far
ahead. Saving for such a distant goal requires more self-control than many people can manage.
Schemes,based on the principles of behavioural ﬁnance,have been developed to increase the rate
of investment in pension funds. One such scheme is ‘Save More Tomorrow’ (see Chapter 2 on
personal investment decisions).In the UK distrust of pension advisers and providers,resulting from
pensions mis-selling scandals and the problems of Equitable Life, has probably added to the
reluctance to start pension plans.

of institutional investors

The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The importance of institutional investors in ﬁnancial markets.

3. The issue of whether institutional investors take a short-term view.
4. The importance of institutional investors to corporate governance.

RISE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR
In most developed economies the dominant form of investment is indirect. Indirect investment
involves individuals putting money in a fund, which then uses that money to buy shares or other
securities.Typically most of the shares issued within an economy are held indirectly through
various types of fund.These funds are known as institutional, or collective, investments. Pension
funds, insurance funds, and mutual funds (such as unit trusts and OEICs) are major institutional
investors. Direct shareholding by individuals accounts for a minority of the total number of
shares held.
Institutional investors have come to dominate securities markets. For example it has been
estimated that around 75% of UK shares are held through institutional investments (UK and
overseas institutions), as opposed to being held directly by individuals. In 1963 UK individual
investors held 54% of UK company shares.According to Hill and Dufﬁeld (2000), by the end of
1998 UK private investors held only 16.7% of UK shares.This fall continued and by the end of
2006 the ﬁgure was down to 12.8% (Ofﬁce for National Statistics 2006).A signiﬁcant trend in share
ownership has arisen from the international diversiﬁcation of portfolios. By the end of 2006 the
proportion of UK shares held by overseas investors had risen to 40% (Ofﬁce for National Statistics).
Another signiﬁcant trend has been a steady increase in the relative importance of institutional
investments over time,for example it has been estimated that in 1957 less than 20% of UK shares

IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
243
were held by institutional investors; by the end of 2006 institutional investors held about 75% of
the UK shares held by UK investors.
Randall et al. (2003) reported that in the United States net cash ﬂows into equity mutual funds
grew from $13 billion in 1990 to $310 billion in 2000.In the same period the number of investor
accounts rose from 22 million to 162 million, and the value of US mutual fund assets increased
from $239 billion to $3,962 billion. Best (2005) suggested that the rise in institutional investors
has led to the emergence of an investment culture wherein investment has become part of the
lifestyle of many people.This is evidenced by the growing importance of newspaper ‘money’
sections,which help to turn investment into entertainment (Shiller 2000).The media coverage of
stock market issues helps to further the investment culture, and the expenditure by institutional
investors on newspaper advertising encourages newspaper coverage of investment issues.The
expansion of media (print,broadcast,and Internet) coverage of stock market and other investment
issues has been paralleled by an increase in investment-related advertising. Just as the advertising
of consumer goods has helped to create a consumer culture as well as increasing demand for the
speciﬁc goods advertised, the advertising of speciﬁc investments by institutional investors would
have helped to create an investment culture.
According to IFSL (International Financial Services, London) worldwide funds in pension,
insurance, and mutual funds reached $45.9 trillion ($45,900,000,000,000) by the end of 2004.
This was approximately evenly split between pension, insurance, and mutual funds.This con-
trasts with $30.8 trillion in private wealth. According to IFSL, fund management accounts
for about 0.5% of national income (GDP) in the UK. In 2004 it employed over 40,000 people in
the UK and generated net exports of £1.42 billion.The revenues of the fund management industry
totalled £7.7 billion.
One social implication of the growth in the relative importance of institutional investments is
the disappearance of the distinction between workers and owners. In aggregate workers (in large
part) own the companies for which they work.The term ‘in aggregate’ is important here since it
is not a direct ownership of the speciﬁc companies for which they work.Each worker through rights
in pension funds, life assurance policies, and other institutional investments owns a slice of the
aggregate of ﬁrms that have issued shares.
The trend towards increased importance of institutional investors is likely to continue,
particularly with regard to pension funds.A major factor behind this expectation is the phenomenon
often referred to as the demographic time bomb.The ratio of pensioners to workers is relentlessly
rising.It has been estimated that by 2020 a ratio of just three workers for every pensioner is likely
to be typical in developed countries (compared, for example, to more than ﬁve workers per
pensioner in 1990). It is projected that the ratio will continue to fall as life expectancy increases.
The question arises as to whether members of the workforce will be able (and willing) to pay the
taxes required to support such a large number of pensioners. It is likely that the current (and
future) workforce will need to accumulate substantial pension fund investments in order to avoid
poverty in retirement or the need to continue working beyond present retirement ages (an often
suggested partial solution to the problem is an increase in the age at which state pensions become
payable).
Many governments allow savings schemes that provide tax advantages for people.Much of this
saving goes into institutional investments. One purpose of such schemes is to encourage people
to save and make their own provision for retirement. UK tax-advantaged schemes motivated

by this objective include personal pension plans, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs),
stakeholder pensions, Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), and friendly society policies.Another
purpose of encouraging ﬁnancial investment is the provision of a ﬂow of capital to businesses,
which seek to raise money by issuing shares or bonds. One implication of a decline in the ratio of
workers to pensioners is that pension funds could move from a position of being net buyers of shares
and bonds to being net sellers.An ageing population could create a situation in which payments
from pension schemes exceed contributions to the schemes. Among other consequences, this
would reduce the ﬂow of capital to businesses.
The main purpose of some schemes is to encourage investment in enterprises that might
otherwise have difﬁculty raising ﬁnance. In the UK, venture capital trusts (VCTs) and enterprise
investment schemes (EISs) provide tax concessions for investments in companies that are too small
to raise capital by means of issuing shares via a listing on a stock exchange.A venture capital trust
is a form of investment trust that holds the shares of companies that are too small, or too young,
to be able to have their shares traded on a stock exchange.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND PRIVATE EQUITY
Institutional investors can have a role in providing ﬁnance for young businesses beyond the provision
of collective investments such as venture capital trusts. Institutional investors may own private
equity ﬁrms,which are ﬁrms that buy the shares of new or small businesses even though the shares
are not tradable on a stock exchange. Money invested in such companies is often described as
private equity.In the UK and Europe the terms private equity and venture capital tend to be used
synonymously.Private equity ﬁrms become co-owners of the companies in which they invest and
take an active managerial role in the companies.The expectation may be that the shares will
eventually be sold to another private equity ﬁrm, to another ﬁrm that makes a takeover bid, or
through a stock exchange when the shares are accepted for a stock exchange listing.
Institutional investors, particularly pension funds and insurance companies, are important
providers of funds to private equity ﬁrms whether or not they own the private equity ﬁrms.Private
equity ﬁrms put together funds for their purchases,and institutional investors are major suppliers
of such funds.Often considerable debt is incurred when a private equity ﬁrm makes acquisitions.
The acquired ﬁrms are usually bought with borrowed money.The amount borrowed will normally
substantially exceed the capital provided by the private equity ﬁrm for the acquisition. One way
in which private equity ﬁrms take their proﬁts is through reﬁnancing.When improvements in an
acquired company become clear the private equity ﬁrm may borrow more from banks on the basis
that the acquired company is now more valuable (and provides more collateral for the loans).The
private equity ﬁrm takes the newly borrowed money as proﬁt.
Private equity ﬁrms not only provide ﬁnance for new and expanding privately owned businesses,
but also for reorganised privately owned businesses.Although some of the ﬁnance goes to start-
up and early stage companies,in recent years much of the funds have been used to help ﬁnance the
purchases of existing enterprises by the managers of those enterprises – known as management
buyouts (Roberts 2004). It is not only privately owned businesses that are acquired. Public
companies (i.e.companies whose shares are traded on a stock exchange) may be bought and turned
into private companies (i.e. companies whose shares are not traded on a stock exchange).
Subsidiaries of other companies may be bought and then operated as private companies.

In 2006 the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association released ﬁgures relating
to sources of European private equity in 2005 (Valdez 2007). Pension funds provided 24.8% of
the ﬁnance, banks 17.6%, funds of funds (such as venture capital trusts) contributed 13.1%,
insurance companies provided 11.1%, and individual investors 6%. Individual investors are
deterred by the large minimum sums, and low liquidity. Individuals wishing to invest in private
equity would normally do so through venture capital trusts (or other collective schemes).
Private equity is important to the economy. It has been estimated that companies ﬁnanced by
private equity employ around 2.7 million people in the UK, which is around 18% of the private
sector workforce (Valdez 2007).Private equity deals entail large sums of money;it is common for
deals to be for much more than £100 million, and they are sometimes for more than £1 billion.
The timescale of the investment is typically three to ﬁve years. Private equity ﬁrms aim to buy
businesses that have potential for development.Private equity ﬁrms aim to improve the businesses
acquired, and to sell them at a proﬁt.
THE LIQUIDITY THEORY OF ASSET PRICES
Pepper and Oliver (2006) proposed the liquidity theory of asset prices.Their suggestion is that
a major driver of stock markets is the amount of liquidity available for investment.In other words,
if people have more money to invest, they will invest more and thereby push up share prices.
Pepper and Oliver illustrate the point by considering a takeover ﬁnanced by bank borrowing (this
is not the only possible source of increased liquidity). Money is created when loans are made.
So the act of ﬁnancing a takeover with borrowed money increases the money supply (liquidity).
The purchase of the shares of the target company pushes the share price up.The sellers of the
shares then have money available for investment,and may use the money for the purchase of other
shares thereby pushing share prices up.The people who sell those shares will receive money,some
of which will be used for share purchases.This process can continue through a number of rounds,
and at each round share prices are pushed up.The cumulative increase in expenditure on shares
can be estimated by means of a multiplier equation:
I  E  [1/ (1  k)]
where I is the cumulative increase in spending on shares,E is the initial expenditure on the shares
of the target of the takeover bid, and k is the proportion of receipts from sales of shares that is
invested in other shares.A high rate of reinvestment (a high level of k) produces a large multiplier
effect and a large cumulative expenditure on shares (a large I).In the event of a substantial number
of takeovers in a time period,this liquidity impact on the stock market could be considerable.There
would be strong upward pressure on share prices.
Institutional investors are potentially signiﬁcant for this process since the proportion of shares
held by institutions has signiﬁcance for the value of k.Whereas individual investors may use part
of the receipts from share sales for purposes other than purchase of other shares, institutional
investors are likely to use a high proportion (in many cases 100%) on the purchase of other shares.
So if institutional investors hold a high proportion of the shares traded on stock markets,the value
of k will be high and so will the value of I.As the importance of institutional investors increases,
so too would the effect of liquidity changes on the level of stock indices.

It should be borne in mind that decreases in liquidity can occur with consequent downward
multiplier effects.The presence of institutional investors could serve to magnify both upward and
downward movements in stock indices.
EXERCISE 12.1
The takeover of a company is ﬁnanced by borrowing £10 billion from banks.The sellers of shares
in the company that is taken over spend 95% of their receipts on other shares.The sellers of these
shares in turn spend 95% of the receipts on other shares. Each time shares are sold 95% of the
proceeds are spent on other shares.What is the cumulative increase in spending on shares?
Answer
The cumulative increase in spending on shares, I, is given by the multiplier equation:
I  E  [1/(1k)]
where E  £10 billion and k  0.95 (95%).
I  10  [1/(10.95)]  10  [1/0.05]  10  20  200
The cumulative increase in spending on shares is £200 billion.
The liquidity multiplier described above explains a process that drives the stock market either
up or down. It indicates the cumulative increase in spending on assets but does not indicate the
size of the resulting rise or fall in the average price of the assets. Congdon (2006) has suggested
that the extent of the market movement can be estimated by considering the demand for liquidity
on the part of institutional investors. He demonstrated that institutional investors (life assurance
and pensions) have a fairly stable demand for liquidity in the sense of the ratio of liquid assets to
other assets.
If the institutional investors experience a change in liquidity that moves the liquidity ratio away
from the desired level,they will attempt to restore the desired ratio.For example the central bank
(Bank of England) may buy government bonds from the institutions.The money used to pay for
the bonds adds to the liquidity of the institutions.The institutions attempt to restore their liquidity
ratios to the desired values by spending the surplus liquidity on assets such as shares, bonds, and
commercial property.This will drive up asset prices. Share, bond, and property prices will rise.
So long as the holding of liquidity exceeds the desired amount investment spending will continue.
To the extent that each institution’s expenditure is another institution’s receipt of money, the
attempt by each institution to reduce its holding of liquidity does not reduce the aggregate holding
of liquidity by institutions.Although each institution attempts to reduce its liquidity holding to the
desired level, the institutions in aggregate fail to do so.
Some of the additional money will be lost to the institutions, for example to individual
shareholders who sell to institutions,but much will remain with the institutions.If the institutions
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
246

IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
247
hold a high proportion of total investment assets, most of the additional money may remain with
the institutions.The desired ratio of liquidity to other assets is restored by a rise in share, bond,
and property prices.
Suppose that institutional investors,in aggregate,hold non-liquid assets of £1,000 billion.Also
suppose that, on average, the institutions desire to hold liquid assets equal to 4% of non-liquid
assets.Together they require £40 billion of liquid assets.If the Bank of England buys £30 billion of
gilts from them,they would have a liquid assets ratio of about 7%.In aggregate they would not rid
themselves of the surplus £30 billion,since the institutions would tend to pass the money between
themselves as shares and bonds (and commercial property) are bought from each other. Some of
the money, say £10 million, would be lost to the institutions.This would reduce the aggregate
holding of liquidity to 6% of the original value of non-liquid assets.The institutions would still have
£60 billion of liquid assets.
The desired ratio of liquid assets to non-liquid assets is restored by a rise in asset prices.Share,
bond,and property prices would rise until the desired ratio is restored.So long as the actual ratio
exceeds the desired ratio, spending on shares and bonds (and commercial property) would
continue,as would the resulting rise in prices.Prices would rise until the total value of non-liquid
assets reached £1,500 billion.The liquidity ratio of 4% would then have been restored (£60 billion
of liquid assets against £1,500 billion of non-liquid assets).A £20 billion increase in the money held
by the institutions leads to a £500 billion increase in the aggregate value of shares and bonds
(and commercial property) held by the institutions.This £500 billion increase results from rising
share and bond (and commercial property) prices.An initial reduction in liquidity would generate
falling prices.
The amount of liquidity lost to the institutions in this process will be low if the institutions hold
a high proportion of the available non-liquid assets.A low loss would entail a high rise in asset prices.
For example if all of the £30 billion increase in the money supply remained with institutional
investors, the aggregate value of non-liquid assets would need to rise to £1,750 billion.The
institutions would have liquidity amounting to £70 billion (the original £40 billion plus the new
£30 billion) and the restoration of a 4% liquidity ratio would require prices to rise until the total
value of non-liquid assets reached £1,750 billion.
The major source of liquidity to the institutions comes from net investment by individual
investors.There is evidence that the ﬂow of money into equity funds has an impact on stock market
movements.Evidence for a positive relationship between fund ﬂows and subsequent stock market
returns comes from Edelen and Warner (2001),Neal and Wheatley (1998),Randall et al. (2003),
and Warther (1995).The question arises as to what inﬂuences the net investment by retail investors
into institutional funds. Indro (2004) suggests that market sentiment (an aspect of crowd
psychology) plays an important role. Indro found that poll-based measures of market sentiment
were related to the size of net inflows into equity funds. It appears that improved sentiment
(optimism) generates investment into institutional funds,which in turn brings about a rise in stock
market prices (and vice versa for increased pessimism).
SHORT-TERMISM
The proponents of the short-termism view believe that stock markets systematically misprice
shares. It is claimed that this results in a misallocation of investment funds such that long-term

investment by companies falls below the level consistent with economic efﬁciency. Institutional
investors are seen as often being short-termist.They are frequently evaluated on the basis of recent
short-term performance and this could incline them to take a short-term view of the investments
they make.
During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s American and British rates of investment, and rates of
economic growth, lagged behind those of Japan and West Germany. One theory put forward to
explain this relates to the structure and behaviour of ﬁnancial markets. In the United States and
the United Kingdom stock markets have been important sources of corporate ﬁnance.In Japan and
Germany banks have been the dominant source of funds for ﬁrms seeking to ﬁnance investment.
(It might be noted that since the 1980s the relative economic performance of these countries
has reversed.)
Adherents of the short-termist view say that stock market investors have been too concerned
with immediate, rather than long-term, proﬁts and dividends.They claim that stock prices are
determined primarily by short-term proﬁt and dividend prospects, with long-term proﬁtability
receiving too little attention.This has resulted in companies overemphasising short-term proﬁts.
It is argued that companies have reduced investment in order to boost short-term proﬁts. Firms
that fail to focus on the short term, and which invest for the long term, ﬁnd that the market
undervalues their shares.The low share price renders these companies vulnerable to takeover by
other ﬁrms.In order to protect themselves from takeover,ﬁrms avoid investment projects whose
pay-offs are long term.
This short-termism theory is popular among some politicians (usually of the left) and journalists,
and hence has been widely publicised. Research undertaken by economists tends to refute the
theory. Economists who have looked for evidence relating to short-termism have concluded that
the facts do not support the view that American and British stock markets are short-termist.
If stock markets place too much weight on current dividends, low-yielding stocks would
be relatively undervalued. However evidence from both the United States and the UK indicates
that the opposite is the case:low-yielding stocks are overvalued relative to higher yielding stocks.
Empirical evidence concerning the relationship between price-earnings ratios and relative
mispricing is also inconsistent with the notion of short-termism. It is widely believed that the
major factor underlying variations in price-earnings ratios relates to differences in growth
prospects.A high ratio of stock price to proﬁts per share is thought to reﬂect potential for future
growth in proﬁts.If participants in ﬁnancial markets were short-termist there would be a tendency
to shun such stocks, which would thereby become undervalued. However research evidence
suggests that high price-earnings ratio stocks tend to be overvalued.Also the evidence from studies
of the effects of announcements relating to investment projects indicates that announcements of
investment spending result in stock price increases.This is opposite to what would be expected
from short-termist ﬁnancial markets. (The empirical evidence, relating to the relationship of
dividend yields and price-earnings ratios to relative mispricing, is discussed in Chapter 25 on
market anomalies.)
Investment analysts often appear to focus strongly on current proﬁts and dividends. However
this is not evidence of short-termism.Current proﬁts and dividends convey information about the
future.The proportion of proﬁts that ﬁrms choose to pay out as dividends can provide clues about
the knowledge and thinking of senior executives within the company, with regard to its future
prospects.

Fund managers are also often seen as being short-termist.This is believed to arise from the fund
managers being subject to appraisal on a short-term,often quarterly,basis.Many would deny that
the main appraisers take such a short-term view. Even if they did, the achievement of short-term
performance might depend upon taking a long-term view.A rise in the price of a stock, relative
to the market, in the short term is likely to be based on a re-evaluation of the ﬁrm’s long-term
prospects.By taking a long-term view of a company’s prospects a fund manager can assess whether
the stock is correctly valued. If the fund manager turns out to be right in deciding that a stock is
mispriced,and trades accordingly,the resulting proﬁt could arise in the short term as other market
participants subsequently revise their views of the ﬁrm’s future prospects (and trade accordingly).
The stock price change that generates short-term proﬁts occurs as a result of a re-evaluation
of the company’s long-term prospects.The fund manager makes a short-term proﬁt by taking
a long-term view.
Some support for the short-termist view of fund managers comes from behavioural ﬁnance.
The chapters – 2 and 24 in particular – dealing with behavioural ﬁnance indicate that the
psychological biases that affect investors include heuristics that cause an excessive focus on the short
term.Narrow framing entails an excessive focus on short-term performance and the recency bias
causes a focus on the recent,rather than longer-term,past.A fund manager may have a preference
for a long-term perspective but if clients, such as trustees or retail investors, judge a manager’s
performance in terms of short-term returns then the manager may feel compelled to adopt a
short-term perspective.
Noise trading is trading based on sentiment rather than market fundamentals, and such
trading can cause stock prices to deviate from fundamental values for long periods of time (see
Chapter 24 on noise trading and behavioural ﬁnance). Stock prices may be overpriced but still
continue to rise.A fund manager who sells overpriced shares before prices stop rising could be
judged to have failed. Stock prices may be cheap but continue to fall.A fund manager who buys
underpriced shares whose prices then fall may be judged to have failed.Such pressures might cause
a fund manager to focus on predicting the behaviour of noise traders rather than ascertaining the
long-term fundamental values of stocks.This may explain the frequent use of technical analysis by
fund managers.Technical analysis could be regarded as a means of forecasting market psychology
and its effects (see Chapter 22 on technical analysis).
If it becomes commonplace for fund managers, or their clients, to focus on the short term it
becomes very difﬁcult for individual fund managers to stand out from the crowd. Investing is
subject to substantial uncertainty and there is a high risk of being wrong.A fund manager who makes
a wrong judgement is likely to be called upon for an explanation.If the fund manager had followed
the practice of other fund managers there is likely to be less criticism than if the fund manager had
been unconventional. To fail when everyone else fails is safe; to fail when others succeed is
dangerous.Fund managers may feel impelled to follow the behaviour of other fund managers as a
means of self-protection,in the same way as many animals herd for self-protection.Self-protection
could also lead them to adopt strategies expected by their clients, even when the fund manager
believes that they are wrong. If it is the case that (psychologically biased and ﬁnancially naive)
clients expect a focus on short-term past and future performance,fund managers may feel obliged
to adopt such a strategy. Following a strategy understood by clients makes it easier to explain
failures. Guyatt (2005) referred to this as ‘gravitation towards the defensible’ and in a study
of institutional fund managers found that this tendency,plus a pull to short-termism and a tendency

to herd, inﬂuenced active fund managers whereas managers of index tracker funds were free of
such inﬂuences.
It is sometimes claimed that institutional investors put pressure on companies to make large
dividend payments.These large dividends are seen as reducing the funds available to ﬁnance
investment.The problem with this line of argument is that it assumes that ﬁrms face a choice
between dividend payouts and investment.There is no such choice since ﬁrms are able to ﬁnance
investment by means other than undistributed proﬁts. Investment can be ﬁnanced by borrowing
or by issuing shares. Furthermore, the reinvestment of proﬁts is only beneﬁcial if there are good
investment opportunities.
The payment of dividends that investors may choose to use for the purchase of bonds or shares
has advantages for the economy.Investors are likely to fund the companies with the most promising
prospects. In this way the market works to ensure that money is directed towards its most
productive uses.Proﬁts retained by ﬁrms,and used to ﬁnance internal investments,might be used
more proﬁtably by other companies with better investment opportunities.
Another factor that concerns adherents of the short-termism theory is the effect of hostile
takeover bids.The belief is that the threat of takeover encourages managers to maximise short-term
proﬁts and dividends in order to boost the share price and deter predators.This is seen as involving
the curtailment of long-term investment.However,as has been pointed out above,such a response
would not be expected to result in an increase in the share price.There is no evidence that
companies that invest heavily are more likely to be taken over.
High inﬂation in the United States and the UK, relative to that in Japan and Germany, could
also provide a rationale for the suggestion that ﬁrms have been short-termist in their approach to
investment. High levels of inﬂation tend to bias the repayment of debt, in real terms, towards the
early part of the repayment period. High inﬂation tends to be reﬂected in high interest rates. It
also erodes the real value of debt.The effect of the high interest rates is immediate, whereas the
process of eroding the real value of money (and hence of debt) takes time to have its cumulative
effect.In consequence the real interest cost is biased towards the early years of the debt.This may
incline management away from investment projects whose returns are not generated relatively
quickly.It is interesting to note that the relatively poor performance of the US and UK economies
during the 1960s and 1970s tended to coincide with the period during which their inﬂation rates
were relatively high.The improved economic performance of the United States and the UK since
the 1980s has coincided with reduced rates of inﬂation.
INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
ON COMPANIES AND ANALYSTS
The growing importance of institutional investors, in terms of their holding an increasing
proportion of the total number of shares issued, has implications for corporate governance.
Corporate governance concerns the way in which companies are controlled. Until the 1970s
‘managerial capitalism’ was dominant.A feature of managerial capitalism was that shareholding
was fragmented.A company’s shares were held by thousands of different shareholders.As a result
shareholders could not easily coordinate to influence the management of companies. In
consequence the managers of ﬁrms often operated them for their own beneﬁt rather than for the
beneﬁt of shareholders.

The concentration of shareholdings in the hands of a relatively small number of institutions has
made it possible for those shareholders to exert inﬂuence over the management of companies.
Shareholders have voting rights at the annual general meetings, and those voting rights include
elections for the board of directors.Institutional shareholders can now force the managements to
give priority to ‘shareholder value’, in other words the interests of shareholders can now take
precedence over the interests of managers. In the last resort institutional investors can replace
directors. However that possibility may be enough to ensure compliance by managers.There are
other methods available,for example putting investors on the board of directors as non-executive
directors.Also share option schemes may be introduced in order to give the managers a personal
interest in the value of the shares.
Most individual shareholders do not own enough stock in a company to be able to inﬂuence its
management.Most individual shareholders do not believe that it is worth their time and effort to
try, particularly since they would bear the costs whilst the beneﬁts are shared with shareholders
who do nothing. Selling shares is easier than trying to inﬂuence managements.
The situation is different for large institutional shareholders. Since such shareholders often
have large numbers of shares in a ﬁrm, they may be able to influence the ﬁrm’s managers.
The large shareholdings also allow a substantial proportion of the beneﬁts to accrue to their
funds.
The question of whether institutional shareholder activism has been effective is controversial.
M.P. Smith (1996) investigated the effects of activism by the Californian public sector pension
fund CalPERS. He found that CalPERS activism in relation to 34 ﬁrms from 1987 to 1993
gained the fund $19 million at a cost of $3.5 million. Other studies have found no evidence
of the effectiveness of activism. Song et al. (2003) examined the effects of activism by the
Council of Institutional Investors (a coalition of US pension funds).They found very little evidence
of the efﬁcacy of the activism. Karpoff et al. (1996) concluded that shareholder proposal
submissions did not lead to any obvious improvement in ﬁrm performance, even when the
proposals had passed.
The US evidence suggests that, whereas some public sector pension funds are activist, few if
any company pension funds are.This may be because company managements choose who runs their
pension funds, and company managements do not like activism. Investor activists are likely to be
seen as nuisances by corporate managers.
The need for diversiﬁcation of a fund tends to reduce the level of shareholdings in any one
company.This diversiﬁcation is often enforced by regulations.To the extent that this reduces the
holdings of shares in a particular ﬁrm, it reduces both the ability to inﬂuence managements and
the rewards from doing so.The alternative of selling shares in a poorly performing company may
often be preferred to activism. One type of fund, the index tracker, does not have the alternative
of selling.It may be that the only way in which an index tracker fund can improve its performance
is by taking an activist approach.The larger institutional investors may also be drawn towards
activism on the grounds that the relatively large size of their stockholdings renders those holdings
illiquid.
Evidence in support of the effectiveness of institutional investor activism comes from Gillan
and Starks (2000) who found that corporate governance proposals from institutional investors
received more votes than those sponsored by individuals or religious organisations. Hartzell and
Starks (2003) found an inverse relationship between institutional ownership and executive pay.

Chung et al. (2002) concluded that large institutional shareholdings deterred the use of creative
accounting to distort proﬁt ﬁgures. Cornett et al. (2007) found a positive relationship between
institutional investor shareholding and operating cash flow returns.They found that both the
percentage of stock held by institutional investors, and the number of institutions holding the
stock, were positively related to performance.
There is some evidence that,even when choosing to sell rather than intervene,institutions can
be influential. Parrino et al. (2003) found that some institutional sales are motivated by poor
investment returns,and that institutional sales may play a role in bringing about changes in company
management. In particular institutional sales can lead to the replacement of a chief executive
ofﬁcer and increase the likelihood of an outsider being appointed.
Cremers and Nair (2005) classiﬁed corporate governance mechanisms as internal and external.
The internal mechanism entails monitoring of the company by block holders. Block holders
are investors who hold large blocks of shares, and institutional investors are major block holders.
The external mechanism entails the threat of takeover by other companies. External corporate
governance is often measured in terms of the level of shareholders’ rights. A high level of
shareholders’rights renders takeovers easier.Research has shown that a high level of shareholders’
rights is associated with high rates of return for shareholders. Cremers and Nair demonstrated
that those high rates of return for shareholders depend upon high levels of internal corporate
governance,which means relatively high levels of block holding.This complementary relationship
between internal and external corporate governance was found to be particularly strong for
small companies.
Institutional investors may not only inﬂuence the companies in which they invest but also the
investment analysts who make recommendations about the shares of the companies. Chapter 21
on ratios and Chapter 26 on further evidence on market efﬁciency,indicate that investment analysts
have a tendency to be too optimistic about the prospects of particular stocks.This appears to be
the case when their investment bank does (or prospectively does) business with the company
whose shares are being analysed.There is a conﬂict of interest wherein pressure from within their
investment bank inﬂuences the recommendations of analysts.Good recommendations are favoured
in order to please corporate clients (or prospective clients). If an analyst makes a negative
recommendation on the stock of a company, that company could transfer its business to another
investment bank.
There is evidence that institutional investors exert a counteracting influence, which acts
to push analysts towards making more accurate and balanced recommendations. Ljungqvist et al.
(2007) made the point that analysts are dependent on institutional investors for performance
ratings and trading commissions.When institutional investors were major shareholders, analyst
recommendations were found to be more accurate.This tendency for the presence of institutional
investors to moderate internal pressures towards excess optimism is consistent with research
indicating that institutional investors are able to recognise biases in analysts’ forecasts and
recommendations. Malmendier and Shanthikumar (2007) provided evidence consistent with
the view that institutional investors perceive the biases of investment analysts whereas
private investors do not.The inﬂuence from institutional investors over the output of investment
analysts could serve to make stock markets more informationally efﬁcient (see Part 7 on market
efﬁciency).

THE SANDLER REPORT
The Sandler report into the long-term savings industry in the United Kingdom was published on
9 July 2002 (HM Treasury 2002).The main points of the Sandler report included:
1. Individuals face a choice that is too large, too complex, and with too much obscure jargon.
2. Consumers do not understand savings products.
3. There should be simple low cost stakeholder investments that could be sold without ﬁnancial
advisers.
4. Pensions taxation and rules should be simpliﬁed.
5. Consumers often pay high fees for poor performance.
6. There is no relationship between fund charges and performance.
7. Competition does not operate to keep charges down.
8. There is a wide disparity in charges.
9. Sales of tracker funds should rise relative to sales of actively managed funds.
10. Financial advisers should be paid by means of fees rather than commission.
11. Life companies should not be able to take part of the proﬁts of with-proﬁts funds.
12. Investors should receive information about the smoothing of with-proﬁts funds.
13. Tax breaks on with-proﬁts bonds should be ended.
The suggestion that the choice facing retail investors is too large and too complex, and that there
should be simple (stakeholder) options available, receives support from one of the principles of
behavioural ﬁnance.The ‘status quo bias’ predicts that, when faced with complex choices, people
tend to do nothing (Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988). In their theory of ‘choice under conﬂict’
Tversky and Shaﬁr (1992) suggested that the decision to take no action,or to postpone an action,
increases when there are many options.When faced with many choices,the task of taking a decision
can be overwhelming.The result can be inaction.This may help to explain why so many people fail
to take saving and investing decisions, and hence fail to save and invest.
Kempf and Ruenzi (2006) found that evidence from the US mutual fund (unit trust) market
provided support for the status quo bias.The status quo bias suggests that when faced with a
complex choice people make no change to their existing position. If their existing position is one
of having no investment,they will continue to have no investment;in other words they do nothing.
If they have investments,they will continue with the same investments.Kempf and Ruenzi looked
at the relationship between previous inﬂows into particular mutual funds and subsequent rates of
investment into those funds.They found that the funds with high previous inﬂows tended to be the
funds with subsequent high inﬂows.This indicates that investors tend to invest in the same funds
as they already hold. Of particular interest was the observation that this tendency was especially
strong when the choice of funds was very large. For example they found that the status quo bias
was three times stronger when there were more than 100 alternative funds in a sector than when
there were 25 funds to choose from.
Agnew and Szykman (2004) suggested that there could be a problem of information overload.
As a result of information overload investors have too much information to comprehend, and
consequently take no investment decisions. Iyengar and Lepper (2000) showed that having too

much choice hampers investors’ ability to identify the most suitable options. Other researchers
have found that information overload can lead to decisions being based on emotion rather than
reason (Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999; Dreman 2004).
Two contributions to Mitchell and Utkus (2004) support the view that increased choice can
result in reduced saving. Sethi-Iyengar et al. (2004) found that if US pension plans offered more
funds, employee participation fell.When employees became overwhelmed with the complexity
of the decision they reduced their pension plan participation. Faced with complex investment
choices, some employees simpliﬁed the decision by choosing the default option of doing nothing.
Scott and Stein (2004) also found an inverse relationship between the number of options available
and the extent of participation. People may feel overwhelmed by too much choice, and abandon
interest. However it is not to be presumed that zero choice achieves maximum pension plan
participation. Papke (2003) found that workers with pension plans that offered some choice of
investments, as opposed to no choice, were more likely to join the pension scheme.
The view that if investors do not understand savings products they will not invest receives
support from the behavioural ﬁnance concept of the illusion of truth (Reber and Schwartz 1999).
According to this idea people are more ready to believe what they ﬁnd easy to understand rather
than what they ﬁnd difﬁcult to understand.It is a short step to extend the idea to personal ﬁnance.
People are less likely to invest if they are unable to understand the investment.
The suggestion that there should be simple investment products,such as stakeholder products,
which could be sold without ﬁnancial advice, has received criticism from Diacon (2004). Diacon
compared perceptions of risk between ﬁnancial advisers and investors.He found that perceptions
of risk differed between them, and that the risk perceptions of investors tended to be the higher.
Without the ﬁnancial advice, which could modify perceptions of risk, investors may be too
risk-averse in their investment decisions. In particular they may avoid stock market investments,
and hence avoid the equity investments that should provide the highest potential returns.The view
of Diacon accords with that of Benartzi and Thaler (1999).
One area of attention in the Sandler report was the issue of actively managed versus index
tracker funds.Actively managed funds attempt to outperform stock markets by stock selection
and market timing. Index tracker funds aim to move in line with stock markets. Sandler pointed
out that, when allowance is made for charges, actively managed funds on average underperform
stock indices.Yet the vast majority of retail sales (93%) was of actively managed funds as opposed
to funds that track a stock index.This is possibly because actively managed funds tend to pay
ﬁnancial advisers more commission.Index trackers are also less risky since they avoid management
risk (active risk), which is the risk that an actively managed fund may perform badly relative to
a stock index.
The average underperformance of actively managed funds is what would be expected on the
basis of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.According to the efﬁcient market hypothesis, if the stock
market is informationally efﬁcient it is not possible for fund managers to consistently outperform
the market.This is consistent with the wealth of empirical research that indicates that there is
little,if any,persistence in fund performance (e.g.Rhodes 2000).The evidence indicates that there
is no reason to believe that funds that have performed well in the past will continue to do so in the
future. In fact the winner–loser phenomenon, for which evidence exists, suggests that today’s
good performers will be tomorrow’s bad performers, and vice versa (DeBondt and Thaler 1985;
Bremer and Sweeney 1991).Ambachtsheer et al. (1998) found two characteristics of pension funds
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS
254

IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
255
that were positively related to fund performance.Those characteristics were fund size and the
proportion of the fund invested in index tracker funds.Large size provides economies of scale and
hence lower percentage costs.Many of the costs of managing and administering funds do not rise
in proportion to the size of the fund.The authors suggested that the positive association between
performance and use of index tracking arose since use of index tracking was a sign of fund
management competence.An alternative explanation might be the relatively low cost of operating
index tracker funds.
Sandler did not suggest that there is no place for active fund management.However he said that
most customers,and advisers,lack the expertise to choose between active fund managers in order
to ﬁnd the potentially successful ones.
Informational efﬁciency is conventionally divided into the weak,semi-strong,and strong forms.
The weak form of the efﬁcient market hypothesis suggests that all historical market information
(past prices, past trading volumes) is fully taken into account in current market prices. An
implication of the weak form of the hypothesis is that there is no scope for making proﬁts from
analysis of historical share prices and trading volumes.So technical analysis,particularly chartism,
is expected to be of no value.Attempts to forecast stock prices using charts based on previous
stock prices will fail since all the information available from past price data is already reﬂected
in stock prices.
A semi-strong form efﬁcient market is one in which security (share and bond) prices fully take
account of all publicly available information.In addition to market information on past prices and
trading volumes publicly available information includes macroeconomic data (such as interest
rates, inﬂation rates, economic growth rates), company data (such as dividends, proﬁts, sales),
and non-economic events (such as political events, technological developments, discoveries of
natural resources).The implication is that asset prices immediately move to reflect any new
information so that no one can make proﬁts by means of purchases or sales based on analysing the
new information.
The fairly high level of informational efﬁciency in stock markets is to be contrasted with the
low level in the market for retail investments. The retail investor is often very ignorant of
institutional investments such as unit trusts and investment bonds.There is therefore asymmetric
information between the client and the ﬁnancial adviser, and between the fund manager and the
individual investor. Individual investors have less information than the professionals with whom
they deal.The asymmetric information can lead to adverse selection where advisers seek to sell
the products that pay them the highest commission, rather than the products that offer the best
value to their clients.
The report suggested that fees should replace commission-based remuneration.This should
remove commission bias where advisers recommend the investments that pay the highest
commissions. It should also lead to competition based on charges that results in lower, and more
uniform,charges.Sandler pointed out that there is little consistency in charges with large variations
in charges for essentially identical products.This is symptomatic of low informational efﬁciency
and ineffective competition.The report also points out that there is a lack of correlation between
charges and performance.
Ambachtsheer (2005) highlighted both information asymmetry and the principal-agent problem
as reasons for many retail investors paying too much for too little.The principal-agent problem
arises from agents (ﬁnancial advisers and fund managers), who should be acting on behalf of the

principals (individual investors), acting in their own best interests rather than the interests of the
investors.Advisers and fund managers could exploit the relative ignorance of retail investors by
imposing excessive charges on investment products such as unit trusts, OEICs, pensions, and life
assurance related investments.
Cocco and Volpin (2007) found principal-agent problems in the operation of company pension
schemes.They found that the proportion of company executive directors among the pension
scheme trustees affected the operation of the schemes.A large proportion of company insiders was
associated with lower company contributions to the schemes and higher risk taking in the fund
management.This evidence was seen as supporting the view that insider trustees acted on behalf
of their companies rather than on behalf of the pension scheme members.Trustees (the agents)
should act on behalf of the members of the pension scheme (the principals).
George Akerlof, a Nobel prize-winning economist, wrote an article entitled ‘The Market for
“Lemons”: Quality, Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism’ (1970) in which he discussed
asymmetric information and its implications.Asymmetric information, as mentioned in Chapter
8,is the term referring to the fact that the managers of a corporation know more about its operation
than investors know. Investors cannot be sure about which corporations are good (the peaches)
and which are bad (the lemons).However the managers do know whether their ﬁrm is a peach or
a lemon. Likewise ﬁnancial advisers may be peaches or lemons, but retail investors do not know
which are the lemons.The same may be true of funds and their managers.Individual investors may
be aware that some ﬁnancial advisers do not offer good advice, and that many fund managers do
not perform well.Since investors cannot easily distinguish between peaches and lemons,they are
less willing to invest for fear of buying a lemon.
Another consequence of asymmetric information is moral hazard. One form of moral hazard
is the temptation for fund managers to take excessive risks, or engage in activities that are
not in the interests of investors.An aspect of moral hazard is the principal-agent problem.Investors
are the principals and managers are their agents. The agents may act in their own interests
rather than in the interests of the principals. Likewise ﬁnancial advisers may recommend
investments that pay high commissions at the expense of the investors.This is a form of adverse
selection and moral hazard. Many people believe that ﬁnancial advisers provide free and
unbiased advice.They do not realise that the adviser is paid according to the amount, and type,
of sales.
Simple stakeholder products and more information about with-proﬁts policies (both
recommended by Sandler) would help to overcome problems of asymmetric information,adverse
selection, and moral hazard.The Sandler report called for the introduction of simple stakeholder
investments that would have no initial charge,annual charges capped at 1% (subsequently amended
to 1.5%), and carefully designed investment policies.They could be sold without the need for a
ﬁnancial adviser.
With-proﬁts policies were criticised for being opaque with respect to performance and charges.
Sandler suggested that investors should be provided with more information about with-proﬁts
funds.Investors would have to be given information on smoothing,the process by which managers
hold money back in good years in order to top up policies in bad years.Customers should be given
four ﬁgures each year: the redemption value of the policy, the proceeds available on death,
projections of the payout at maturity, and the value of the unsmoothed assets.

IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
257
CONCLUSION
The main institutional investors are pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds
such as unit trusts, OEICs, and investment trusts. In recent years another group of institutional
investors,hedge funds,have gained considerable importance (see Chapter 16 on styles of portfolio
construction).
Most investment by individuals is carried out through institutional investors. In the UK,
institutional investors account for around 75% of stock market investment. The investment
behaviour of the institutions therefore has considerable signiﬁcance for the behaviour of the stock
market. It might be thought that this dominance of the institutions would introduce considerable
rationality to the stock market. However evidence presented in Chapter 24 on noise trading and
behavioural ﬁnance, and in Chapter 27 on stock market bubbles and crashes, suggests that
institutional investors are prone to the same psychological and social influences as individual
investors.In particular institutional investors appear to have a tendency towards herding.There is
little evidence to support the view that institutional investors tend to be short-termist in their
investment behaviour.
It might be thought that,since institutional investment managers are professionals,institutional
investors should be able to outperform the stock market by their management of funds.However,
on average, they fail to do so. Furthermore the empirical evidence suggests that no institutional
fund manager is capable of consistently outperforming the stock market, except by chance.
Evidence on such matters is presented in Chapters 9, on mutual funds, and 17, on evaluating the
performance of fund managers, and in Part 7 on market efﬁciency.The evidence suggests that
individual investors should avoid the expense of actively managed institutional funds, and should
invest in institutional funds that aim to track stock indices (and that charge individual investors
much less).The Sandler report on the savings products provided by institutional investors in the
UK suggested that more use should be made of index tracking funds.
There is one way in which the managers of index tracker funds can enhance their fund
returns.This entails investor activism. Investor activism involves the participation, by investors,
in the decision-making processes of companies. Institutional investors may seek to get their
representatives elected on to the board of directors of a company as non-executive directors.
The institutional investors may do this if they feel that they can improve the management of
the company. Alternatively, institutional investors could block the election of board members
who are seen as detrimental to the company or its shareholders.The rise in the importance
of institutional investors has allowed such investor activism. Since the institutions hold large
blocks of shares they can cooperate on activism in a way that thousands of small investors
could not.
One way in which the relative expertise of institutional investors has impacted on their strategies
has been through their use of derivatives (see Chapters 28 and 31 on stock index futures and on
stock options, respectively). In particular funds that guarantee that the original capital cannot

be lost,or that pay high yields,have been structured and sold to individual investors (see Chapter
34 on structured products). Some hedge funds have used more complex derivatives strategies.
Derivatives can be used either to reduce portfolio risk,or to increase risk in the hope of increased
returns.
Some economists have argued that changes in the money supply are major driving forces for
share prices. It is further argued that institutional investors form an important element in the
transmission mechanism whereby money supply changes impact on stock markets. In particular
attempts by institutions to maintain their preferred ratios of money to shareholdings may result
in the ratios being maintained through the medium of share price movements.

Portfolio diversiﬁcation
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The principle of Markowitz diversiﬁcation.
2. Efﬁciency frontiers.
3. The use of the Markowitz equations to calculate the expected return and risk of a portfolio.
4. The merits of international diversiﬁcation.
5. The role of property in portfolios.
6. The advantages of adding a risk-free asset to the investment alternatives.
7. Asset allocation lines.
8. The signiﬁcance of asymmetric correlation and leptokurtosis.
9. Behavioural portfolios.
10. Value-at-risk.
11. Post-modern portfolio theory.
12. Time diversiﬁcation.
13. The importance of ﬁnancial advice and ﬁnancial education.
The idea that investment portfolios should be diversiﬁed is well established.The saying ‘Don’t put
all your eggs in one basket’ expresses a basic principle of diversiﬁcation. Spreading one’s assets
among a large number of investments lessens the risk of losing everything as a result of adverse
developments relating to one investment. Share portfolios are often in the form of 50 or more
different stocks since poor performances on some of the investments tend to be offset by strong
performances on others.The observation that industries vary in their performances over time
leads to the shareholdings being spread across a number of different industries.So a portfolio may
have shares in ﬁrms involved in engineering, chemicals, banking, electricals, transport, brewing,
insurance, food processing, retailing, oil, computing, water, and pharmaceuticals. Spreading
investments across industries, as well as across individual ﬁrms, allows for poor performances in
some industry sectors to be offset by strong performances elsewhere. A more complete
261

diversiﬁcation would involve a spread of investments across asset classes.The main asset classes are
equities (shares), bonds, deposits, and property (real estate).
Spreading one’s wealth amongst asset classes,and within those classes among different sectors,
will tend to provide most of the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation.This approach is sometimes referred to
as naive diversiﬁcation.A more sophisticated approach has been suggested by Harry Markowitz
(Markowitz 1952, 1959).This involves basing the choice of investments upon their correlations
(or upon their covariances) in order to maximise the expected degree of offset between them.What
follows will focus on this latter form of diversiﬁcation,often known as Markowitz diversiﬁcation.
The exposition will initially be concerned with diversiﬁcation between asset classes; particularly
equities,bonds,and deposits.A more complete approach would extend to the choice of individual
securities,for example the speciﬁc shares to be bought and the relative contribution of each stock
to the portfolio.
EXPECTED RETURN AND RISK
In ﬁnance the term ‘expectation’ does not suggest that a speciﬁc single outcome is anticipated.
Instead the word ‘expectation’ is used in the statistical sense, which is the average of a range of
possible outcomes. Consider Table 13.1.
There are three possible returns on an investment,and each of those returns has the probability
(likelihood) indicated in Table 13.1.The expected return is the weighted average of the three
possible returns, with the weighting being based on the probability of occurrence.The expected
return is therefore:
(2%  0.25)  (6%  0.5)  (10%  0.25)  6%
EXERCISE 13.1
The most frequently used measure of risk is standard deviation. The equations for standard
deviation are:
V  ( f d2)/(N1)
  √V
where V is variance,fis frequency,d is deviation from the mean,N is the number of observations,
and  is standard deviation.

Estimate the expected return and standard deviation of returns.

The ﬁrst step is to calculate the expected return, which is:

The expected return is 5% p.a., and is the mean (average) of the observed returns.
The next step is to calculate the value of fd2.
V  (fd2)/(N1)  30/11  2.727

The standard deviation of returns is 1.65% p.a.

(a) The average deviation of returns is:

(b) The standard deviation of returns can be calculated as:

In the table here the returns are more spread out than in the table in Exercise 13.1,the deviations
are more extreme which means that volatility is greater.This is reﬂected in higher values for the
average and standard deviations.
It is to be noted that standard deviation can be calculated using either frequencies or
probabilities.
THE PRINCIPLE OF DIVERSIFICATION
The role of correlation in the determination of portfolio risk can be seen from the following
example in which the combination of risky assets produces a risk-free portfolio.
There are two securities in this example, A and B. There are three possible eventualities
(circumstances).Examples of eventualities might be economic boom,equilibrium,and recession.
Table 13.2 shows the returns from the securities in each of the three different circumstances.Table
13.3 shows the returns from a portfolio comprising 0.8A and 0.2B. In eventuality 1 the
contribution to total return from holding 0.8A is 0.8  7.5  6%,the contribution from the 0.2B
is 0.2  20  4%, giving a total return of 6  4  10%. In the second circumstance A provides
0.8  10  8%,B contributes 0.2  10  2%,so that the total portfolio return is 8%  2% 
10%. In eventuality 3 security A contributes 0.8  12.5  10%, and B contributes 0.2  0 
0%, with the result that the total portfolio return is 10%.
The portfolio of 0.8A plus 0.2B is a risk-free portfolio. Under all three of the possible
eventualities the return is 10%. Since there is no uncertainty about the return, there is no risk.
The expected return is 10% and the standard deviation of returns is 0%.So by combining two risky
investments in an optimal ratio, risk has been eliminated.The optimal proportions of 0.8 and 0.2
(4 to 1) arise from the ratio of deviations from the expected return; B has a deviation four times

that of A (10% compared with 2.5%).The other factor involved in ascertaining the optimal
proportions in a portfolio is the correlation of returns, although this factor was not relevant to
ascertaining the proportions in the example above since only one correlation was involved
(between A and B).
EXERCISE 13.3
An investor wants to combine two shares, A and B, into a portfolio.There are four possible
eventualities, based on the growth rate of the economy.The probabilities of the four eventualities
and the rates of return on the two shares in the four situations are as shown in the table.
(a) What are the expected returns for the two shares?
(b) How can the shares be combined into a portfolio whose risk is zero? What is the expected
return of that portfolio?
(c) Why is it not normally possible to ﬁnd a portfolio of two shares that has zero risk?
Answers
(a) The expected return on share A is:
(8  0.2)  (6  0.3)  (4  0.3)  (2  0.2)  5% p.a.
The expected return on share B is:

(b) The average deviation of returns for share A is:
[(8  5)  0.2]  [(6  5)  0.3]  [(5  4)  0.3]  [(5  2)  0.2]  1.8% p.a.
The average deviation of returns for share B is:
[(5 {4})  0.2]  [(5  2)  0.3]  [(8  5)  0.3]  [(14  5)  0.2]  5.4% p.a.
Since the ratio of average deviations is 3 to 1 (5.4/1.8) the ratio in the portfolio should be 3
to 1, i.e. 0.75% A and 0.25% B.The expected portfolio return in each of the four situations
is shown in the table.
Since the expected return is the same in all four cases, the risk is zero.
(c) The construction of a portfolio with zero risk requires the combination of shares with perfectly
negative correlation. It is highly unlikely that a perfectly negative correlation exists between
a pair of stocks.
The Markowitz approach seeks to incorporate securities with low correlations of returns. By
minimising correlations, the chance of poor performances by some investments being offset by
strong returns on others is increased.In the examples above the coefﬁcient of correlation was 1,
with the result that it was possible to completely eliminate risk.Although negative correlations
rarely exist, there is still scope for reducing risk by using the criterion of low correlation. It can
be seen from equation (2) in the Markowitz equations below, that lower correlations will tend to
result in lower variances.An important insight of the Markowitz approach is the observation that
the risk-reduction effects of diversiﬁcation can be maximised by choosing investments with
relatively low correlations with each other.
Risk is often divided into systematic and non-systematic risk.Systematic risk is the risk arising
from movements in the market as a whole. Systematic risk cannot be removed by diversifying a
portfolio (hence it is also known as non-diversiﬁable risk). Non-systematic risk is the risk that is
speciﬁc to a particular ﬁrm or industry sector.Non-systematic risk can be removed by diversifying
a portfolio (and is therefore alternatively known as diversiﬁable risk). Non-systematic risk tends
to decline as the number of different stocks in the portfolio increases.The presence of systematic
risk tends to cause correlations to be positive.The presence of non-systematic risk causes the
positive correlation to be less than perfect, and provides scope for risk reduction by means of
diversiﬁcation.Figure 13.1 shows that as the number of different stocks in the portfolio increases
total risk decreases. Greater diversiﬁcation reduces non-systematic risk but not systematic risk.

THE EFFICIENCY FRONTIER
Another conclusion of the Markowitz analysis is that it is possible to construct a set of points, in
risk-return space, that cannot be improved upon. Such a set of points is depicted in Figure 13.2.
The curve in Figure 13.2 is known as the efﬁciency frontier. Portfolios that produce points
on the efﬁciency frontier provide the highest expected returns for each level of risk, and the
lowest level of risk for each expected rate of return. Once on the efﬁciency frontier it is not
possible to increase expected returns without increasing risk, nor is it possible to reduce risk

without reducing expected returns. Points on the efﬁciency frontier are said to dominate points
in the shaded area below it.Any point below the efﬁciency frontier can be improved on, in terms
of increasing expected returns and/or reducing risk, by changing to a portfolio on the efﬁciency
frontier. Rational investors would be expected to hold portfolios on the efﬁciency frontier.
THE MARKOWITZ EQUATIONS
There is an equation for the expected return on a portfolio (in the sense of statistical expectation)
and an equation for the expected variance (risk) of the portfolio.The equations used here will be
based on the choices between the three asset classes of equities, bonds, and deposits.
The equation for the expected rate of return can be written as:
E(Rp)  (We)E(Re)  (Wb) E(Rb)  (Wd) E(Rd)
(1)
where E(Rp) is the expected return on the portfolio; (We), (Wb), and (Wd) are the portfolio
weightings in equities, bonds, and deposits respectively (the weightings sum to 1); E(Re), E(Rb),
and E(Rd) are the expected returns on equities, bonds, and deposits respectively.
The equation for the expected portfolio variance can be written as:
Vp  (We) 2 e
2  (Wb) 2 b
2  (Wd) 2 d
2  2(We) (Wb) e b eb  2(We) (Wd) e
d ed  2(Wb) (Wd) b d bd
(2)
Where Vp is the variance of the portfolio;e,b , and d are the expected standard deviations
of returns on equities, bonds, and deposits respectively; eb is the expected correlation between
the returns on equities and the returns on bonds,ed and bd have corresponding interpretations.
The portfolio standard deviation is the square root of the portfolio variance, i.e. p  √Vp.
By using equations (1) and (2) it is possible to ﬁnd the highest expected return for any level of
expected risk, and the lowest risk for each level of return.This optimisation procedure is based
on the use of the coefﬁcients of correlation and standard deviations of returns. This use of
correlation coefﬁcients and standard deviations distinguishes Markowitz diversiﬁcation from naive
diversiﬁcation. Markowitz diversiﬁcation achieves the best (optimal) level of diversiﬁcation
possible, whereas naive diversiﬁcation cannot aspire to such optimality.
Combining assets in a portfolio achieves an expected return that is a weighted average of the
expected returns of the individual assets.However the risk is less than the average of the individual
risks, unless the coefﬁcients of correlation all equal 1. Consider equations 3 and 4, which are
generalised versions of equations 1 and 2 (generalised to allow for any number of assets in a portfolio).

The expected return of a portfolio, E(Rp), is the weighted average of the expected returns

In equation 4,Vp is the variance of the portfolio returns (therefore √Vp is the standard deviation
of returns).The standard deviations of securities j and k are represented by j and k respectively.
The coefﬁcient of correlation between the returns of j and k is shown as jk.
If all the coefﬁcients of correlation equal 1, the portfolio standard deviation would be a
weighted average of the standard deviations of the individual securities.This averaging of the
standard deviations is illustrated by Example 13.1.
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
269
EXAMPLE 13.1
Suppose that a portfolio comprises equal values of two securities with standard deviations of
return of 0.2 (20% p.a.) and 0.4 (40% p.a.). If the correlation between returns is 1 then:
Vp  (0.5)2(0.2)2  (0.5)2(0.4)2  2(0.5)(0.5)(0.2)(0.4)(1)
 (0.25)(0.04)  (0.25)(0.16)  0.04
 0.01  0.04  0.04  0.09
∴p  √0.09  0.3
The standard deviation (risk) of the portfolio, shown as p , is 0.3 (i.e. 30%). This is the average
of the risks of the individual securities (20% and 40%).
If the coefﬁcients of correlation are less than 1, the portfolio risk would be less than the
average of the risks of the individual securities.This is illustrated by Example 13.2.
EXAMPLE 13.2
If the correlation is 0.4, but other values are the same as in Example 13.1, the portfolio risk would
be calculated as follows:
Vp  (0.5)2(0.2)2  (0.5)2(0.4)2  2(0.5)(0.5)(0.2)(0.4)(0.4)
 (0.25)(0.04)  (0.25)(0.16)  (0.04)(0.4)
 0.01  0.04  0.016  0.066
p  √0.066  0.257
The standard deviation (risk) of the portfolio is less than the average of the standard deviations
(risks) of the two securities.

It can be seen that as the correlation falls below 1, the risk of the portfolio falls below the
average of the risks of the individual securities that comprise the portfolio. As the correlation
falls,the risk of the portfolio declines.Portfolio risk is at its lowest when the correlation is 1.When
the correlation is 1 it is possible to ﬁnd a proportion, for the two securities, that reduces risk
to zero.

∴p  √0.01  0.1
The standard deviation (risk) of the portfolio is 0.1 (i.e. 10%). Since there is a perfectly
negative correlation it is possible to ﬁnd weights that reduce risk to zero.

If the share with a standard deviation of 0.4 has half the weighting (1/3) of the share
with a standard deviation of 0.2 (a weighting of 2/3), the portfolio will have a standard deviation
of zero.

Figure 13.3 illustrates some possible expected return/risk combinations for securities X and
Y. If the correlation of returns between X and Y were 1, it would be possible to ﬁnd a portfolio
of X and Y that reduces risk to zero. It would be possible to achieve a point such as A. If the
correlation were 1, a portfolio of X and Y would be on the straight line XY; the risk of the
portfolio would be an average of the risks of the two securities.
Between these extremes lie the more realistic correlations. Correlations would usually be
between 0 and 1. In such cases portfolio risk would be greater than zero but lower than an
average of the risks of the two securities.The possible combinations of expected return and risk
would lie on a curve such as XY.The curve XY is an efﬁciency frontier for portfolios comprising
X and  Y.Along this curve the expected return is an average of the expected returns of X and Y,but
the portfolio risk (standard deviation) is less than an average of the two risks.
The importance of correlations in the estimation of portfolio risk is illustrated by Exercises 13.4,
13.5, and 13.6.

It is to be noted that the share with the lower standard deviation has the higher weighting. A

(c) The calculations in (a) and (b) have involved just three shares. In reality there are thousands
of shares that might be incorporated into a portfolio and calculating correlation coefﬁcients
between each possible pair of shares would be problematic. Even a portfolio of 50 different
shares (not an unusual number) would involve 1,225 correlation coefﬁcients. Correlating
each share with a stock index would be a little less accurate but would reduce the number of
correlations required to 50.
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
274

Another practical difﬁculty is that past statistical data may not be a reliable guide to future
values. Returns, risks, and correlations can change over time so that the past is not always a
reliable guide to the future.
It is often stated that the main insight of the Markowitz equations is the observation that low
correlation is crucial to risk reduction.In the extreme,if perfectly negative correlations can be found
then it is possible to construct entirely risk-free portfolios. However (near) zero risk could be
achieved in the absence of correlations of 1. This can be seen from another feature of the
Markowitz equations,namely that an increase in the number of different shares tends to reduce risk.
Consider a case in which all correlations are zero, and in which all shares have a standard
deviation of returns of 20% p.a.(i.e.0.2).Where there are two shares held in the portfolio,in equal
proportions, the portfolio variance (2) and standard deviation () will be:

  √0.01332  0.1154, i.e. 11.54% p.a.
Where there are four shares held in the portfolio, in equal proportions, the portfolio variance
and standard deviation will be:

  √0.01  0.1, i.e. 10% p.a.
It can be seen that increasing the number of different shareholdings will reduce portfolio risk.
By increasing the number of shares held sufﬁciently,portfolio risk can be reduced to (close to) zero.
However positive correlations would mean that risk cannot be reduced to zero (although
increasing the number of shareholdings still reduces risk).
The risk-reduction effect would be greatly reduced if some shares have high weightings in
portfolios. For this reason index tracker portfolios may not provide maximum risk reduction.
Index tracker portfolios aim to reﬂect the composition of a stock index such as the FTSE 100.The
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
275

larger companies tend to account for substantial proportions of the index, e.g. BP has accounted
for about 10% of the FTSE 100.
Consider the three-share example above but with the weighting of one company being twice
that of the other two.

  √0.015  0.1225, i.e. 12.25% p.a.
The increased concentration of the portfolio increases risk from 11.54% to 12.25% p.a.
Another reason why index tracker funds do not minimise risk is that the shareholdings do not
take account of correlations.Stock indices are often dominated by a few sectors,for example more
than 50% of the FTSE 100 is comprised of shares from the oil,ﬁnancial,telecommunications,and
pharmaceutical sectors. Shares from the same sector are likely to exhibit relatively high
correlations. It seems likely that a 1/N portfolio (i.e. a portfolio holding shares in equal
proportions) that holds a very large number of different shares,including shares of companies that
are too small to be included in most stock indices,would provide lower risk than an index tracker
portfolio.
The downside of a 1/N portfolio is that transaction costs are incurred when the portfolio is
rebalanced to maintain the equal proportions.The rebalancing entails selling shares whose prices
have risen and buying those whose prices have fallen. In other words, rebalancing enforces a
contrarian investment strategy.
FOREIGN INVESTMENTS AND PORTFOLIO RISK
Investing in the securities of foreign countries has two opposing effects on the risk of a portfolio.
Risk is reduced since the foreign investments increase the degree of diversiﬁcation of the portfolio.
On the other hand there is an additional source of risk to the extent that foreign investments are
priced in foreign currencies.The consensus view is that the risk-reducing effects are greater than
the risk-enhancement effects.
Both of these effects can be interpreted in terms of the Markowitz equation for the measurement
of portfolio risk.The risk-reduction effect of increased diversiﬁcation is enhanced by choosing
investments in those countries whose stock markets show the lowest correlations with the domestic
market (and with one another).The effects of international diversiﬁcation on portfolio risk can be
illustrated by means of Figure 13.4.
Figure 13.4 shows how the risk of a portfolio tends to decline as the number of different stocks
in the portfolio increases.The decline is most rapid when the correlation of returns between the
stocks is low.The correlation is likely to be lower between a domestic and a foreign stock than
between two domestic stocks.As a result the risk of the international portfolio (comprising both
domestic and foreign stocks) tends to decline faster than the risk of the portfolio containing only
domestic stocks. Furthermore since the returns on the domestic and foreign stock markets will
not be perfectly correlated,the lowest achievable risk will be lower for the international portfolio
than for the domestic portfolio. Systematic (non-diversiﬁable) risk for internationally diversiﬁed
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
276

portfolios is lower than systematic risk for domestic portfolios.
Whereas the increased diversiﬁcation provided by foreign investments reduces risk, the
acquisition of currency exposure increases it.For the most part foreign stocks are priced in foreign
currencies. If a foreign currency loses value relative to the domestic currency, the domestic
currency value of the foreign investment will fall.A security may provide high returns in terms of
its own currency,but a relative fall in that currency would offset those returns for foreign investors.
Exchange rate movements can turn strong proﬁts into heavy losses (or vice versa).A US dollar
investment might produce a 10% return in dollar terms,but if the dollar falls 20% against the Euro
the result for a European investor is a 10% loss.
This can be expressed in terms of the Markowitz formula.The risk of a foreign security, held
as an investor’s only asset, is represented by F in equation 5.
F
2  D
2  C
2  2 DC D C
(5)
In equation 5, D represents the risk (standard deviation of returns) of the security from the
point of view of an investor in the foreign country. The currency risk is shown as C . The
correlation between the returns on the security (to an investor in the foreign country) and the
exchange rate movements is represented by DC.It might be noted that the weighting for both the
security risk and the currency risk is 1; this is because they both relate to the full value of the
investment.
A numerical example can illustrate some of the implications of equation 5. Suppose that the
risk (standard deviation of returns) for an investor in the foreign country is 20% p.a. and that a
UK investor faces a 15% p.a. exchange rate risk. If this relates to a UK investor buying a US

security, the risk for a US investor is 20% whereas the UK investor faces that risk plus a 15% p.a.
currency risk. Suppose further that there is zero correlation between the returns on the
security for a US investor and the currency movements. Introducing these values into equation
5 gives:

F
2  625
∴F  25
The combination of a security risk of 20% p.a. and a currency risk of 15% p.a. produces a
foreign security risk of 25% p.a.
From the perspective of a well-diversiﬁed international portfolio,the contribution of currency
risk to total risk depends upon the correlations between the various foreign currencies. If such
correlations are low, as appears to be the case, much of the currency risk is removed as a result of
diversifying among currencies.
It could be argued that not all of the currency risk should be included in the calculation of
total risk. For example the investor’s annual expenditure might be partly spent on imported
goods.This may give a currency risk, which is opposite to that on foreign investments. A rise
in the US dollar against the Euro will make imports from the United States more expensive
for Europeans, but that currency movement enhances investment returns on US securities
held by Europeans. One currency exposure offsets the other.To the extent that this happens,
the exchange rate exposure of foreign investments can be seen as reducing risk rather than
increasing it.
In most countries investors, even institutional investors, invest primarily in their own
country.The UK stock (equity) market is less than 10% of the world market by value,and the UK
bond market is about 3% of the world market. However most UK pension, insurance fund, and
unit trust investments are in UK shares and bonds.This has been referred to as home bias,and the
behavioural ﬁnance concept of familiarity has been used as a possible explanation. It is suggested
that investors prefer familiar investments, such as those of their own country, and perceive those
familiar investments as both yielding higher prospective returns and providing lower risk.
Strong and Xu (2003) reported a Merrill Lynch survey in which fund managers from conti-
nental Europe predicted that their stock returns would outperform UK, US, and Japanese
stock returns.Simultaneously UK fund managers were forecasting that UK stocks would perform
better than the others. Fund managers were optimistic about their domestic stocks, relative to
foreign stocks, in terms of both return and risk.When investors do buy foreign stocks, they
buy them in companies that are familiar.These tend to be large, and export-oriented, com-
panies (Kang and Stulz 1997). The home bias hinders the achievement of the full degree of
international diversiﬁcation required to obtain the greatest possible beneﬁts from international
diversiﬁcation.

These calculations illustrate that diversifying a portfolio internationally can reduce risk.The
risk reduction appears to increase as the number of countries (or regions) is increased.The
addition of currency risk partially offsets the risk-reduction effects of diversiﬁcation.The risk-
reduction from international diversiﬁcation would be enhanced by lower currency risk and
lower correlations between stock markets. Including both the US and the Eurozone helps to
diversify currency risk when compared with including just one of them.Raising the proportion
of UK investment slightly would reduce risk because the UK has the lowest risk, but the UK
proportion should not be raised very much otherwise the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation would be
reduced.

ASYMMETRIC CORRELATION AND LEPTOKURTOSIS
Problems arise for the use of Markowitz diversiﬁcation when two of its assumptions are violated.
One of these assumptions is that correlation coefﬁcients are the same irrespective of whether
prices are rising or falling (the assumption of symmetric correlation). The other is that the
distribution of asset returns can be described by a normal distribution.

There is evidence that correlations are much higher during market falls than during rises. Erb
et al. (1994) found that correlations among the stock markets of the US,Japan,UK,and Germany
were higher when both of the correlated markets were falling than when both were rising.This is
known as asymmetric correlation and implies that the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation fall just when they
are most needed.
The ﬁnding that correlations are higher in falling markets than in rising markets has been
conﬁrmed by other studies using both international and single economy correlations,e.g.Longin
and Solnik (1995,2001),Ang and Chen (2001),Jacquier and Marcus (2001),Meric et al. (2002).
A study by Roll (1988) of the stock market crash of October 1987 found that all 23 of the countries
studied suffered the crash.
However there is evidence that international diversiﬁcation can substantially reduce risk during
periods of weak market performance.Asness (2005) provided some ﬁgures that were indicative
of the prospective beneﬁts of international diversiﬁcation during stock market weakness.The
ﬁgures related to the beneﬁts of holding internationally diversiﬁed portfolios for investors in
France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Using data from 1950 to
2004, the worst ten-year periods from a home-country portfolio were compared with the worst
ten-year periods from a global portfolio (formed by equally weighting each country’s contribution
to the portfolio).The worst case returns, in real terms, were as shown in Table 13.4. In each case
the global portfolio proved to show a lower downside risk in the sense of the highest ten-year loss.
Correlations between national stock markets not only vary as a result of market direction,but
also vary between country pairs.Bessler and Yang (2003) investigated the interdependence between
national stock markets.They found that the Japanese market was relatively isolated from the other
markets studied,in that it was not strongly inﬂuenced by the other markets and had little inﬂuence
over those others.The French and Canadian stock markets showed a high degree of correlation
with movements in other markets.These ﬁndings suggest that Japan is useful for diversiﬁcation,
whilst France and Canada are less so.The US market was found to have a consistently strong
inﬂuence over other markets.The Meric et al. (2002) study found that during a falling market the
US market had considerable inﬂuence over other (France, Germany, Japan, UK) stock markets
whilst the other markets had no inﬂuence over the US market, or over each other.
The Markowitz equation for the measurement of risk uses a single number for correlation.This
coefﬁcient of correlation may be based on a period containing rising, falling, and relatively stable
markets. Such a value is likely to understate the correlation when both assets (or markets) are

falling. In consequence the true risk of the portfolio would also be underestimated. Most of the
research on correlation between national markets seems to have focused on equity markets.Hunter
and Simon (2005) considered the government bond markets and found that the beneﬁts of
diversiﬁcation across major government bond markets did not decrease following sharp market
falls, or during periods of high volatility.
Leptokurtosis is alternatively called fat tails.The ends of the distribution of returns decline less
rapidly than in the case of a normal distribution. In other words, extreme values are more likely
than a normal distribution would predict. In the presence of leptokurtosis, normal distributions
understate the true level of risk.The use of risk measures (standard deviations) based on normal
distributions when using the Markowitz equation to estimate risk will tend to cause the level of
risk to be underestimated.The distributions of returns on shares appear to exhibit leptokurtosis.
In the presence of asymmetric correlation and leptokurtosis, the Markowitz equation for
estimating risk could have a downward bias.The equation might understate the level of risk of a
portfolio.
If ﬁnding low correlations (symmetric or otherwise) is a problem, a portfolio manager might
carry out research to ﬁnd investments with low correlations. Daniel and Blank (2002) looked for
asset classes that showed negative correlation with equities.They also applied criteria that required
the assets to be suitable for institutional portfolio managers. Such criteria included adequate size
of trades, liquidity of markets, and acceptable transaction costs.Assets identiﬁed included gold,
copper, crude oil, farmland, and forestry. Other researchers have concluded that real estate can
provide good diversiﬁcation for an equity, or broader, portfolio.
CONSISTENCY AND THE ROLE OF DIRECT
PROPERTY INVESTMENT IN PORTFOLIOS
The Markowitz equations are applied using computer software.Values for expected asset returns,
risk,and correlations are the inputs and expectations of portfolio return and risk are the outputs.
The application can be conducted for varying investment horizons (investment holding periods).
If a particular asset appears in the resulting portfolios for all investment horizons,that asset is said
to have consistency. Direct property investment is the purchase of the property itself rather than
shares in property companies or property-based institutional investments.If direct property were
to be included in an investment portfolio, and if there were uncertainty concerning the length of
time for which properties would be held, it would be desirable that property has consistency.
Direct property investments need to have a place in an optimum portfolio for all relevant
investment horizons.
Lee and Stevenson (2006) found that property possesses the attribute of consistency.Property
appears to be particularly useful for risk reduction. Portfolios with investment horizons ranging
from 5 to 25 years were investigated. Not only did they check for consistency but also they
compared optimum portfolios inclusive and exclusive of direct property.They found that the
inclusion of property both increases returns and reduces risk, particularly towards the low
return/low risk end of the efﬁciency frontier. It was found that the inclusion of property tended
to reduce bond holdings rather more than it reduced share and cash holdings.
Lee and Stevenson (2006) found that the consistency of direct property investment was robust
in the sense that the Markowitz-based software indicated that property had a place in optimal
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
282

portfolios for all investment horizons from 5 to 25 years, and for most levels of portfolio return.
This result held irrespective of whether property was used for return enhancement or risk
reduction.The research results indicated that the risk reduction effects were greater than the
return-enhancement effects.The beneﬁts of including property tended to rise as the investment
horizon extended.
Fraser et al.(2002) conﬁrmed the particular advantage of property in long-term portfolios.They
found no long-run correlation between property returns and returns on either shares or bonds.
Stevenson (2004) conﬁrmed that property real estate has diversiﬁcation beneﬁts but indicated that
it was likely to reduce expected return as well as risk. It was suggested that this could be because
property is low risk compared with both shares and bonds. McGreal et al. (2006) concluded that
the income streams from property portfolios had little risk, but there was higher risk associated
with the price change element of property returns.
DIRECT PROPERTY INVESTMENT
IN INSTITUTIONAL AND PRIVATE PORTFOLIOS
Montezuma (2004) made the point that there are important differences between institutions and
individuals in relation to direct residential property investment. One important difference is that,
for investing institutions,property is an investment and serves no other function.For an individual
household property is likely to have a consumption role, as a place to live, as well as an investment
function.The optimum amount of housing from a consumption perspective will differ from the
optimum contribution to an investment portfolio. For example the optimum from an investment
view may be a one-bedroom ﬂat,but the family may be unhappy with that amount of accommodation.
Another important difference is that an institutional investor would be able to hold a diversiﬁed
portfolio of residential properties. Most individual property owners have just one property.
Institutional investors beneﬁt from the risk-reduction effects of diversiﬁcation whereas most
individual households do not.Institutional investors may have systematic risk only.The properties
of individuals will bear both systematic and non-systematic risk.The greater risk of property
investment, for most households, would tend to reduce the optimum amount of property from
an investment perspective.
Institutions have more ﬂexibility as to the amount of property to be held.If an institutional fund
manager decides to reduce the weighting of residential property in the portfolio by 10%, the
manager could reduce the weighting by selling properties.The individual household is not able to
sell 10% of its home.
There are common features between institutions and households in relation to investment in
residential property.There are low correlations with other asset classes such as bonds and shares.
The low correlations make housing attractive as a means of diversifying portfolios.Transaction costs
are high relative to other assets,and transaction times are also high (it takes time to sell a property).
These transaction features make residential properties unsuitable as short-term investments,inhibit
frequent portfolio adjustments, and prevent quick response to changing conditions.
MARKOWITZ DIVERSIFICATION VERSUS THE 1/N STRATEGY
One popular form of naive diversiﬁcation amongst retail investors is the 1/N strategy.The 1/N
strategy entails equal division of investment money between the available funds.For example when
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
283

given a choice of ﬁve funds for pension investments people will often divide their pension
contributions equally between the funds. Siebenmorgen and Weber (2003) found that ﬁnancial
advisers were also prone to recommending 1/N strategies, and to ignoring correlations between
investments when estimating portfolio risk.The 1/N strategy is often seen as irrational behaviour
since it involves the loss of the beneﬁts of Markowitz diversiﬁcation.
However if the range of available funds reasonably reﬂects the distribution of asset classes, the
improvement available from Markowitz diversiﬁcation may be marginal.The ranges of funds that
allow reasonable diversiﬁcation from the 1/N strategy might include the following: a UK equity
fund (i.e.a fund of UK shares),an international equity fund,a commercial property fund,a bond
fund, and a cash (or money market) fund. Conversely if the available funds comprised four bond
funds and one equity fund, the 1/N strategy would not provide good diversiﬁcation.
Exercise 13.8 illustrates how it might be difﬁcult to unambiguously improve on the 1/N strategy
by a simple application of the principle of Markowitz diversiﬁcation.At a more sophisticated level,
DeMiguel et al. (2006) have demonstrated that a 1/N strategy may be superior to Markowitz
diversiﬁcation when account is taken of the fact that estimated values of expected returns,standard
deviations,and correlations are subject to statistical error.The fact that the estimated values of these
parameters,which are used in the Markowitz model,are subject to uncertainty adds to the risk of
a portfolio based on Markowitz diversiﬁcation.This addition to risk may exceed the beneﬁts of
Markowitz diversiﬁcation relative to the 1/N strategy.
EXERCISE 13.8
(a) A ﬁnancial adviser suggests that a client should divide an investment equally between ﬁve
OEIC funds: a UK equity fund, a European equity fund, a property fund, a bond fund, and a
cash fund. (Equal division between funds is known as a 1/N strategy.)
(b) The ﬁnancial adviser considers an adjustment to the asset allocation that involves increasing
the weightings of the UK equity fund and the bond fund to 25% each, and lowering the cash
fund to 10%.The change is based on the observation that the UK equity fund and the bond
fund both have higher prospective yields than the cash fund, and on the observation that the
UK equity fund and the bond fund have a low correlation.Would the ﬁnancial adviser improve
on the 1/N strategy by achieving both higher expected returns and lower risk (as measured
by standard deviation)?

Using the tables what are the expected (forcast) return and risk of the portfolio?

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, hence:
p  √46.8775  6.85 (to two decimal places).
Risk is higher than in the case of the 1/N strategy.Despite attempting to follow the principles
of Markowitz diversiﬁcation by choosing to emphasise a low correlation combination of funds,
the adviser has not succeeded in raising returns without increasing risk.Even if the correlation
between the UK equity and bond fund had been as low as 1, the alternative strategy would
not have succeeded in reducing risk relative to the 1/N strategy. Despite the beneﬁts of low
correlation,switching from a low risk fund to high risk funds raises portfolio risk.The movement
of money from the very low risk cash fund to the higher risk funds increases the overall risk.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INCLUDING A RISK-FREE ASSET
AMONGST THE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES
If a risk-free asset (treasury bill or bank deposit) is available to them, investors may hold
combinations of the risk-free asset and a portfolio of risky assets.Rational investors would choose
a portfolio of risky assets on the efﬁciency frontier. More speciﬁcally they would choose the
portfolio depicted by point A in Figure 13.5.This is known as the market portfolio.
The rate of return on the risk-free asset is shown as Rf. Rational investors would hold
combinations of the risk-free asset and the portfolio at A. Point A indicates the expected return/
risk combination of the portfolio that produces the highest capital market line. The capital
market line is the set of points that represent combinations of the risk-free asset and the market
portfolio.
To the left of point A investors are combining positive amounts of the risk-free asset with the
portfolio at A.To the right of point A investors combine negative amounts of the risk-free asset
with the portfolio.In other words,to the right of point A investors borrow money in order to hold
an amount of the market portfolio that exceeds their wealth.

Note that this is exactly half the risk as that provided by the portfolio in part (a).This is to
be expected since the portfolio of part (b) comprises 50% of the portfolio of part (a) and 50%
the risk-free asset.

The expected standard deviation of returns would be:

(the risky assets amount to double the portfolio of part (a)).
It is often argued that when the investment horizon is very long term, as may be the case
with a pension fund,the best portfolio would be one invested 100% in equities (i.e.shares,stocks)
on the grounds that the probability of shares underperforming deposits or bonds over the very long
run is extremely low. However Asness (2005) makes the point that a better portfolio might be a
combination of equities and bonds,which is leveraged by means of borrowing to increase the sum
invested.An examination of the US markets found that a portfolio of 60% stocks plus 40% bonds,
when leveraged to the risk level of a 100% stocks portfolio, provided higher long-run returns
than an unleveraged portfolio invested 100% in equities. In terms of Figure 13.5, the optimal
portfolio at point A was 60% equities and 40% bonds. By borrowing to add sufﬁciently to the
portfolio to bring the risk level up to that of 100% equities,the resulting portfolio provided a higher
return than a 100% equities portfolio. By borrowing money an investor was able to leverage the
portfolio to a point on the capital market line to the right of point A and obtain a return in excess
of what an unleveraged portfolio invested solely in stocks could provide.
ASSET ALLOCATION LINES
Farrar (1962) found that US mutual funds (unit trusts) were,typically,not on the efﬁciency frontier.
This ﬁnding has been supported by subsequent studies by other researchers. Individual investors
can nevertheless create investment opportunities that correspond to the capital market line by
combining holdings of risk-free assets (e.g. bank or building society deposits) with holdings of a
unit trust.The resulting opportunities will be on what is termed an asset allocation line. Such an
asset allocation line is illustrated in Figure 13.6.
The point marked by X describes the risk-return characteristics of a unit trust.An investor can
attain a point along the asset allocation line by combining a holding of the unit trust with a bank
deposit (or debt if the chosen position is to the right of point X).
The investor could get closer to the capital market line by holding a portfolio of unit trusts
(which will further reduce non-systematic risk and move point X towards the efﬁciency frontier).

Alternatively the investor might choose a unit trust that tracks a broad stock index, for example
the FT All-Share Index. In this way an investor can get close to the capital market line (however
even index tracker funds based on broad indices do not fully correspond to the market portfolio
at A in Figure 13.5,since the market portfolio contains all possible investments – domestic stocks,
foreign stocks, bonds, property, etc.).
BEHAVIOURAL PORTFOLIOS
The Markowitz model of portfolio construction suggests an optimal,or ideal,approach to portfolio
building. However people do not typically think in terms of the Markowitz model. In particular,
people are prone to mental accounting (Thaler 1985;Prelec and Loewenstein 1998).Investors tend
to place each investment into a separate mental account.This means that each investment is treated
separately and interactions are overlooked. People tend to ignore correlations when gauging the
risk contributed by an investment to a portfolio.
Investors tend to ignore the interactions between mental accounts and between investment
assets. For example an investor may have two pension funds, four Individual Savings Accounts
(ISAs), a unit trust savings scheme, and an endowment policy. Mental accounting implies that
the investor is concerned about the risk and return of each of these separately rather than
seeing them as components of a total portfolio.An implication is that an additional investment,
for example a new ISA, is evaluated in isolation from the other investments without regard to its
correlation with the other investments.This tendency to ignore correlations between components
of the total portfolio leads to a sub-optimal portfolio construction from the perspective of
Markowitz portfolio theory.
A person may keep retirement savings in one mental account whilst keeping savings for a
new car in another mental account. Separating funds according to their goals is a mechanism
that helps with self-control, and with the ability to monitor progress towards goals. Shefrin and
Statman (2000) showed how the psychological biases of investors cause them to think of their
portfolios as a pyramid of assets. Each layer in the pyramid represents assets intended to meet a

particular goal, and each layer forms a mental account. People are seen as having separate mental
accounts for each investment goal, and as being willing to take different levels of risk for each
goal.Investments are chosen for each mental account in order to meet the desired risk and return
characteristics of that mental account.There may be a goal of safety and a mental account is
established to meet that goal with investments in risk-free assets.There may be a goal of income
generation, which is met by the establishment of a mental account containing investments with a
high income yield.There may be a goal of capital growth with a mental account containing growth-
oriented investments.The result of the various goals and mental accounts is that the investor ends
up with a group of mini-portfolios.There is a pyramid of mini-portfolios, each focused on a
different goal. As a result the overall portfolio fails to be efﬁcient in the sense of Markowitz
diversiﬁcation.
A study applying acquisition pattern analysis to ﬁnancial products appears to be consistent with
the Shefrin and Statman pyramid.Paas et al.(2007) found a common order of acquisition of ﬁnancial
products reﬂecting risk levels of the products.The ﬁrst product to be acquired is normally a savings
account, followed by a pension fund, then mutual funds and ﬁnally shares.This is consistent with
the idea of building a pyramid of assets beginning with the least risky assets as the base of the
pyramid followed by layers comprising assets of increasing levels of risk.Paas et al. also found that,
when disposing of investments,the more risky assets tended to be the ﬁrst to go and the least risky
were the last to be discarded.
Other aspects of investment behaviour that undermine the achievement of Markowitz optimality
have been identiﬁed by Benartzi and Thaler (2001) in a study of employee pension funds in the
United States. One aspect is the tendency to use a ‘1/N rule’.When offered a choice of N funds
into which to invest, many employees choose to put 1/N of the money into each of the funds.
In other words the money is divided equally between the funds irrespective of whether that
produces an optimal diversiﬁcation from the perspective of Markowitz theory.Even more perverse
is the tendency to invest a large proportion of the money (Benartzi and Thaler found it to be 42%)
in the shares of the employing company. Not only does this result in a poorly diversiﬁed ﬁnancial
portfolio but, when human capital is considered, the diversiﬁcation is even worse. Employees
are making both their current and their retirement incomes dependent upon the fortunes of a
single company.
Another psychological bias that affects portfolio construction is the familiarity bias (alternatively
known as ambiguity-aversion).Investors appear to prefer investments that seem familiar to them.
Huberman (2001) found that investors tend to buy the shares of local companies. Coval and
Moskowitz (1999) found that professional investment managers were also subject to this familiarity
bias.French and Poterba (1991) identiﬁed a home bias,which deters investors from international
diversiﬁcation.
VALUE-AT-RISK
The concept of value-at-risk (VaR) uses the principles of portfolio diversiﬁcation in risk
management.Risk management is the process of identifying,measuring,and controlling risk.This
does not necessarily mean attempting to eliminate or reduce risk. Some amount of risk may be
seen as desirable, particularly if higher risk is seen as being associated with higher prospective
returns. Risk management aims to ensure that the risk-taking aspects of investing are carried out
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
291

in an understood and controlled manner.Risk management is a continuous process since there are
continuous changes in the composition of an investor’s portfolio, the risk characteristics of the
assets in the portfolio, and the attitudes and circumstances of the investor.
Value-at-risk is the maximum loss that a portfolio is likely to suffer during a speciﬁed period
and with a speciﬁed probability.If there is a 5% probability that the value of a portfolio will fall by
more than £1 million during a month, the value-at-risk for one month and 95% conﬁdence is £1
million.The ﬁgure for the value-at-risk might be interpreted as the loss,which has a chance of 5%
of being exceeded (when the conﬁdence level is 95%) or a chance of 1% of being exceeded (if the
conﬁdence level is 99%).
Figure 13.7 illustrates value-at-risk with conﬁdence levels of 95% (5% chance that there will
be a loss greater than the value-at-risk) and 99% (1% chance that there will be a loss greater than
the value-at-risk).In these cases value-at-risk is expressed as a number of standard deviations from
the mean.This value is determined by the chosen conﬁdence level;on the basis that the distribution
of returns follows the standard normal distribution.A conﬁdence level of 95% will always have a
value-at-risk of 1.645 standard deviations, and a conﬁdence level of 99% will always have a
value-at-risk of 2.326 standard deviations.Turning these numbers into money values requires
multiplication by the money value of the standard deviation. If a portfolio is estimated to have a
monthly standard deviation of returns of £100,000,the value-at-risk at a conﬁdence level of 95%
is £164,500 and the value-at-risk at a conﬁdence level of 99% is £232,600.

A big advantage of value-at-risk is that it measures risk as a single number.However it does have
drawbacks. One problem is that while it tells the user about the maximum loss on, say, 99% of
time periods it says nothing about the size of the loss on the remaining 1% of occasions.Another
problem is that it can be difﬁcult to estimate value-at-risk in practice.Different estimation methods
can produce very different results.
It is necessary to estimate the future return distribution of a portfolio from data on the historical
returns of the assets in the portfolio. A simple approach would be to use a recently observed
distribution, for example the percentage gains and losses on the last 100 trading days. If a 99%
conﬁdence level were to be used,the value-at-risk would be the largest daily percentage loss during
the last 100 trading days.Using a 95% conﬁdence level the value-at-risk would be the ﬁfth largest
percentage loss during the last 100 trading days. Once the value-at-risk as a percentage of the
portfolio is ascertained, the money value of value-at-risk can be derived from the value of the
portfolio. A more sophisticated approach to determining value-at-risk is to use the Markowitz
equations described earlier in this chapter (equations 3 and 4).
EXERCISE 13.11
A pension fund holds £20 million in a portfolio of shares and £30 million in a portfolio of bonds.
The daily volatility (standard deviation) of the portfolio of shares is 2% and the daily volatility of
the portfolio of bonds is 1%.The coefﬁcient of correlation between the returns of the two portfolios
is zero.What is the value-at-risk on the total portfolio for a conﬁdence level of 99%?

The volatility (standard deviation) of the total portfolio is 1%.
In money terms the standard deviation is 0.01  (£20m  £30m)  £0.5m.At a conﬁdence
level of 99% the value-at-risk is 2.326 standard deviations.So the value-at-risk is 2.326  £0.5m
 £1.163 million.
One problem with the measurement of value-at-risk using the Markowitz model is that the model
assumes a normal distribution of returns.However there is considerable evidence that investment
returns do not follow the normal distribution. In particular they are characterised by fat tails. In
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
293

other words extreme values have higher probabilities than suggested by normal distributions.This
is a particular problem for a measure that focuses on a tail of the distribution of returns.The
signiﬁcance of this deﬁciency can be checked by back-testing. This may entail checking the
proportion of times value-at-risk has been exceeded in the past against the proportion predicted
by the normal distribution (and chosen conﬁdence level).
Using Value-at-Risk to Ascertain Investor Risk Preferences
Nevins (as described by Veres 2006) has suggested that a value similar to value-at-risk could be used
to ascertain the risk-aversion of the clients of ﬁnancial advisers.If the value-at-risk were presented
as a ‘worst case scenario’, the client could then see both an expected value (mean of the
distribution) and the worst case scenario.This combination of values could be presented for a
number of investment strategies. It is likely that the client would ﬁnd that a low expected value is
associated with a relatively high worst case scenario,and vice versa.The client’s attitude to the risk-
return trade-off would be revealed by the choice made. Risk-averse clients would choose low
expected return and high worst case strategies.Risk-tolerant clients would choose high expected
return and low worst case strategies.
The presentation of pairs of numbers is a simpler procedure than the usual practice of
administering a questionnaire to the client as a means of ascertaining attitude to risk. It becomes
possible to separate out portfolios designed for different purposes, and hence having varying
investment horizons. For example saving for a car has a much shorter investment horizon than
saving for retirement.Each investment horizon would have its own investment strategy,and its own
risk preference. Presentation of combinations of values in relation to each investment horizon
would be practical whereas use of a questionnaire for each investment horizon would probably not
be feasible.
This is consistent with ideas presented by Valentine (and reported by Ramachandran 2006).
Valentine argues that there are different time horizons for different investment purposes (saving
for a holiday, saving for a home extension, saving for children’s education, saving for retirement,
etc.),and that a single questionnaire cannot ascertain the risk-return preferences applicable to all
the investment horizons.Each investment horizon would have a different risk-return preference.
Arguably portfolios for long investment horizons (such as pension fund investment) should accept
more risk and expect more return than portfolios developed for shorter-term objectives (such as
ﬁnancing home improvements).
POST-MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY
Markowitz diversiﬁcation (often referred to as modern portfolio theory) treats risk as being
measurable in terms of the standard deviation of returns, as illustrated by Figure 13.8.
The use of the normal distribution is questionable from the perspectives of both behavioural
ﬁnance and statistics. Prospect theory (see Chapters 2 and 24 on the psychology of personal
investment decisions and noise trading and behavioural ﬁnance,respectively) suggests that investors
have an asymmetric attitude to risk: that the pain of losses is stronger than the pleasure of gains.
The symmetric normal distribution does not reﬂect this loss-aversion, since the normal distri-
bution gives equal weight to upside and downside deviations from the mean.The normal distribution
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
294

is a distribution around the mean of the distribution, whereas an investor may have a different
reference point. An investor may have a Minimum Acceptable Return (MAR) against which
prospective deviations are measured, rather than measuring deviations relative to the mean of the
distribution.
There are also statistical issues concerning the nature of the distribution.A distribution may be
skewed. It is useful to see skewness in relation to the mode of the distribution. The mode
corresponds to the highest probability. In the case of a normal distribution, the mode coincides
with the mean and the dispersion of prospective returns is the same in both the upside and downside
directions.A skewed distribution is characterised by a larger dispersion in one direction than in
the other.A negatively skewed distribution has a wider dispersal on the downside, so that there is
enhanced probability of very poor outcomes.For a loss-averse investor this possibility of very large
losses may cause a perception of high risk.This would be magniﬁed if kurtosis is present, in other
words if there is a fat-tailed distribution indicating relatively high probabilities of extreme values.
If returns exhibit high downside semi-variance, then returns that fall below the mean tend to be
a long way below.High downside semi-variance would be associated with perceptions of high risk.
Post-modern portfolio theory (Swisher and Kasten 2005) seeks to reformulate Markowitz
diversiﬁcation in terms of downside risk rather than total risk.The risk-return trade-off is between
downside risk and return.Not only does prospect theory suggest that downside deviations impact
most strongly on risk perceptions, but also it is questionable as to whether upside dispersion
constitutes risk at all.Some would argue that investors are concerned only with deviations below
their minimum acceptable returns when judging risk, and that uncertainty about the prospective
deviations above the minimum acceptable returns does not impact on perceptions of risk.
Downside risk is measured in terms of deviations below the minimum acceptable return.
Swisher and Kasten (2005) report that F.Sortino provided a formula for measuring downside risk
that combined three elements:
1.
Downside frequency,which is the proportion of returns falling below the minimum acceptable
return.
2.
Average downside deviation, which is the average size of the deviations below the minimum
acceptable return.
3.
Downside magnitude,which is the ‘worst case scenario’deviation.It may be measured as the
deviation below which just 1% of returns would fall.

The resulting single number is expressed as a percentage rate of return (just as standard deviation
is expressed as a percentage rate of return). Unfortunately the measure of downside risk cannot
simply be inserted into the Markowitz equations.
TIME DIVERSIFICATION
If diversiﬁcation across different investments reduces risk by way of bad performances from some
investments being offset by good performances from others, it might be expected that over time
bad periods could be offset by good periods.The idea of time diversiﬁcation is that over time there
are periods when returns are low and other periods when investment returns are high.If an investor
holds assets for a long time span,it might be expected that good periods would offset bad periods
so that long-term risk is moderated.
The shape of the curve in Figure 13.9 can be explained as being the result of compounding
returns.The shape of the curve in Figure 13.10 might be explained in terms of the effects of time
diversiﬁcation; over a long time span good periods tend to offset bad periods.The two ﬁgures
illustrate why stock market investments should be used for long-term rather than short-term
savings.In the short term shares provide high risk relative to return,in the long term they tend to
produce high return relative to risk.
In Figure 13.10, risk is measured as standard deviation of returns.Variance of returns is seen
as being proportional to the length of time that an investment is held.This is what would happen
if prices changed randomly from day to day (known as a random walk). Standard deviation is the
square root of variance; so standard deviation is proportional to the square root of time. For
example extending the length of time from one year to four years entails a doubling of the risk
(√4 / √1  2/1  2), and an extension from four to nine years increases risk by a further 50%
(√9 / √4  3/2  1.5).Whereas risk,as measured by standard deviation,increases with time,it
does so at a decreasing rate as depicted in Figure 13.10.The decelerating rate of increase of standard
deviation could be explained in terms of a tendency for movements towards extremes to be offset
by opposite movements;random movements mean that there is a tendency for deviations towards
extreme values to be offset by subsequent changes in the opposite direction.
The evolution of portfolio value over time could be envisaged in terms of Figure 13.9 adjusted
for risk.The curve in Figure 13.9 shows the means (mid-points) of possible outcomes at different
points in time.The width of the distributions of possible values around the means is indicated by
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY

the curve in Figure 13.10. As the length of the investment period increases the dispersion of
possible values around the mean becomes greater.Whereas the means increase at an accelerating
rate,the dispersions increase at a declining rate.One consequence is that the chance of a very poor
outcome, such as an overall loss, declines over time.
Swank et al. (2002) argued that even the curve of Figure 13.10 may exaggerate the rise in the
risk from holding stocks for increasing periods of time.They provided evidence that returns on
stocks had some tendency towards mean reversion, which means that there is some tendency for
price movements to subsequently reverse.It is slightly more likely that a good period will be followed
by a bad period,and vice versa.The curve of Figure 13.10 is based on the price change in each period
being unrelated to that of previous periods.A tendency towards mean reversion increases the time
diversiﬁcation effect such that risk (standard deviation) rises more slowly than Figure 13.10 shows.
The effects of time diversiﬁcation have been illustrated by Fidelity,which is a major investment
management company (Fidelity International 2005), as mentioned in Chapter 1. Examining the
period 1985 to 2005, they found that the UK stock market (as measured by the FTSE All-Share
Index) produced a proﬁt in 77% of one-year periods, where a one-year period is 12 consecutive
months (e.g. June 1986 to May 1987, March 1992 to February 1993).There was a proﬁt in 81%
of ﬁve-year periods, where a ﬁve-year period is 60 consecutive months (e.g. September 1988 to
August 1993).Every ten-year period (120 consecutive months) showed a proﬁt.An international
portfolio of stocks (as measured by the MSCI World Index) produced ﬁgures of 71%, 81%, and
100% respectively.
Swank et al. argued that since many occupational pension plans have an unlimited future
investment period (no foreseeable termination date),they should hold 100% of their assets in the
form of shares.There seems to be virtually no risk that shares (equities) would underperform
other investments over such a long investment horizon.They suggest that the failure to hold 100%
in shares partly arises from short-term unpredictability of stock market performance,which could
require the company (or other pension provider) to fund shortfalls in some years.There is also the
career risk of investment managers, who could ﬁnd that a few years of poor investment returns
result in the loss of their jobs.The time horizons of providers and managers may be shorter than
the investment horizon of the pension fund.
Figure 13.10 uses the conventional (amongst ﬁnance academics) approach to deﬁning risk,
which is as standard deviation of returns. However some researchers (Payne 1973; Olsen 1997;
Fortuna 2000) report that most investors deﬁne risk as the chance of losing money.When risk is
deﬁned in this way, equity risk (stock market risk) declines with the length of the investment
horizon.This is partly because of the rise in the expected values of investments over time and
partly because of the behaviour of standard deviation, which reﬂects the effects of time
diversiﬁcation (Mukherji 2002).
Historically the real net rates of return on bank and building society accounts have been only a
little above zero, on average. The achievement of high real net rates of return has required
investment in stocks.So the attainment of good investment returns has necessitated acceptance of
the risk associated with investment in stocks.However that risk needs to be seen from a long-term
perspective. If risk is deﬁned in terms of the likelihood of making a loss, or underperforming a
low yield investment, then risk declines to low levels as the investment horizon lengthens.
Consideration of time diversiﬁcation leads to the standard recommendation of ﬁnancial advisers;
bank deposits for short-term investments and shares for long-term investments.By extending the
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
297

analysis to bonds,whose returns and risks are generally believed to fall between those of deposits
and equities, the recommendation becomes: deposits for the short term, bonds for the medium
term,and stocks for the long term.An increase in the investment horizon reduces the probability
of making losses from equity investments; in other words it reduces the likelihood of shares
underperforming an investment with zero return.Likewise a long investment horizon reduces the
probability of equities underperforming other investments with lower returns than stocks, such
as deposits and bonds (although the probability of underperformance is greater than in the case of
a zero-return investment). Correspondingly an increase in the length of the investment horizon
reduces the chance of a medium-return and medium-risk investment, such as bonds,
underperforming a low return and low risk investment such as bank deposits.
Mukherji (2002) pointed out that individual investors need to bear horizon risk in mind.A 25
year old may have a retirement horizon of 40 years and anticipates investing over that period.
However personal circumstances can change and could shorten investment horizons.So even if it
is accepted that equities are appropriate for a 40-year investment, horizon risk could lead to the
holding of some deposits and bonds in a portfolio.
THE ROLES OF FINANCIAL ADVICE AND FINANCIAL EDUCATION
Most people have little expertise in personal ﬁnance matters, and many have little interest in
ﬁnancial decision-making.The question arises as to whether people should seek professional
personal ﬁnance advice.There is also an issue of the need for increased education in matters of
personal ﬁnance.
In the UK experiences of ﬁnancial advice have been mixed,and there is widespread distrust of
ﬁnancial advisers.The regulator,the Financial Services Authority,and the ﬁnancial services industry
are attempting to increase levels of trust.One aspect of this is the elevation of education,training,
and qualiﬁcations requirements of ﬁnancial advisers with a view that in future all advisers should
have chartered status, which reﬂects levels of training and qualiﬁcation on a par with other
professionals such as accountants and solicitors. Many UK consumers of ﬁnancial products have
unpleasant memories of the 1980s and 1990s when unqualiﬁed ﬁnancial advisers sold, on a
commission basis,ﬁnancial products without full understanding of either the products or the needs
of their customers. One result was a spate of mis-selling scandals, and another was widespread
distrust of ﬁnancial advisers and of the ﬁnancial services industry.This distrust is now holding back
the general level of participation in ﬁnancial services, such as pensions, with the result that many
people have inadequate provision.
The United States appears to be ahead of the UK in terms of levels of both adviser expertise
and consumer conﬁdence.The development of ﬁnancial services training and qualiﬁcation for
advisers in recent years is reﬂected in a generation gap amongst US consumers. Elmerick et al.
(2002) examined the use of ﬁnancial planners (advisers) by US households.They found that people
under 35 were more likely to consult ﬁnancial planners than those over 35.The use of professional
ﬁnancial advisers was also found to be higher amongst consumers with higher levels of education
and income.A distinction is made between specialist ﬁnancial advice and comprehensive advice.
Specialist advice is concerned with just one aspect of personal ﬁnance; some advisers would be
concerned only with mortgage advice, others only with investments, and others only with
insurance.Comprehensive advice covers the full range of ﬁnancial services.The ﬁndings of Elmerick
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
298

et al. (2002) with respect to the inﬂuence of factors such as age and income relate primarily to the
use of comprehensive ﬁnancial advice.
Black et al. (2002) highlight the need for a theoretical basis for personal ﬁnancial planning.
Comprehensive ﬁnancial advice allows for the application of portfolio theory, such as Markowitz
diversiﬁcation, to the management of personal ﬁnances. Comprehensive ﬁnancial planning also
gives considerable scope for the management of the psychological biases identiﬁed by behavioural
ﬁnance.In particular,comprehensive ﬁnancial planning can avoid the mental accounting tendency
to put different aspects of personal ﬁnance into separate compartments whose interrelationships
are ignored.
Byrne (2007) examined the behaviour of members of a UK deﬁned-contribution pension
scheme.It was found that those members who had received professional advice about their pension
were more likely to be aware of their saving needs, to have more investment knowledge, and to
take more interest in their investments. An interesting ﬁnding was that UK pension scheme
members avoided the common US error of including a substantial amount of their own company’s
shares in their pension funds.This error is commonly assigned to a familiarity bias, which leads
people to invest in what they feel they understand. However there appeared to be a bias towards
property investment amongst the UK pension scheme members. This may also be due to a
familiarity bias, and can result in an overweighting of property in investors’ portfolios.To the
extent that advice can offset the biases identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance,such as familiarity biases,
its importance is enhanced.
Dolvin and Templeton (2006) demonstrated the beneﬁts of ﬁnancial education to pension
scheme members in the United States.They found that those who attended seminars on ﬁnancial
education subsequently rebalanced their pension fund portfolios in a manner that rendered those
portfolios more efﬁcient, when compared to the portfolios of those who did not attend. In
particular portfolio diversiﬁcation was improved.
CONCLUSION
Diversiﬁcation is a key element in portfolio construction. By including a diverse variety of
investments in a portfolio,risk can be reduced.There would be a tendency for poor performances
of some investments to be offset by good performances from others. Institutional investments
such as pension funds and mutual funds (which include unit trusts and OEICs) offer individual
investors diversiﬁed portfolios. Individuals with limited investment funds would not be able to
directly build a well-diversiﬁed portfolio since the transaction costs of acquiring many small
shareholdings would be prohibitive. Institutional investments can hold diversiﬁed portfolios so
that investors in those institutional investments indirectly acquire diversiﬁed portfolios.
The process of diversiﬁcation goes beyond shareholdings from the investors’ own country.
International diversiﬁcation further reduces portfolio risk since stock markets around the world can
provide differing performances.A poor return from investments on one stock market could be offset
by stronger performance from another stock market.Nor need diversiﬁcation be limited to shares.
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
299

Risk reduction can be enhanced by the inclusion of other asset classes such as property, bonds, and
cash. If a portfolio manager feels uncertain about how to select assets in some markets, futures
contracts could be used.Stock index futures could be used as a means of incorporating exposure to
a broad coverage of shares in a foreign stock market.Likewise bond futures could be used to provide
effective inclusion of overseas bonds. Currency futures could be used to remove the currency risk
of foreign investments.The use of futures in portfolio management is discussed further in Parts 8
and 10 dealing with stock index and currency futures,respectively,and bond futures in Chapter 43.
In principle optimum diversiﬁcation is achieved by the application of the Markowitz equations.
However this requires a huge amount of data input since it entails estimating expected returns and
standard deviations for all assets, and correlation coefﬁcients between each pair of assets.The
estimates of expected returns, standard deviations, and correlation coefﬁcients are subject to
statistical error.These problems have led some to suggest that 1/N approaches,which hold assets
in equal proportions, may be as good as the use of the Markowitz equations.
There are further problems with the measures of standard deviation and correlation.The
standard deviation measure of risk treats upside deviations, as well as downside deviations, as
undesirable.However investors do not dislike unexpected gains;they only dislike losses.A problem
with both standard deviation and correlation is that their estimated values are based on the past,
which is not necessarily a good guide to the future. In particular correlation coefﬁcients may be
affected by the direction and speed of stock market movements.A dramatic fall in markets may be
accompanied by rising correlations.In other words the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation are reduced when
they are needed most.
For the private investor,who considers institutional investments,achieving diversiﬁcation may
appear to be simple.The manager of the institutional fund might be expected to achieve the full
beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation. However managers of actively managed funds could intentionally
unbalance their portfolios in an attempt to outperform the stock market. Even index tracker
funds,which mirror the whole stock market,may not provide optimum diversiﬁcation since a few
large companies might dominate the stock market.A fund that mirrors such a stock market would
hold a disproportionate amount of the shares of a few large companies. However a combination
of such an index tracker fund with one that tracks an index of smaller company shares would help
to overcome this problem.
Behavioural ﬁnance suggests that people do not fully diversify their portfolios since they do
not see their portfolios as single entities. Mental accounting causes people mentally to divide
their portfolios into a number of separate portfolios. From the perspective of Markowitz
diversiﬁcation this appears to be irrational since it prevents full diversiﬁcation (for example
the same asset may appear in several of the sub-portfolios). However if mental accounting
is accepted as a useful tool for the management of personal ﬁnances it is not necessarily irrational.
Mental accounting might better be seen as an investor preference than as a form of irrational
behaviour.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The meaning of beta.
2. The single index model.
3. The use of the security market line to estimate the required rate of return of a stock or a

THE MEANING OF BETA
The beta of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) can be interpreted in several ways. One is as
the relationship between expected percentage changes in the stock price and percentage changes
in a stock index.A beta of 1 indicates that a 1% rise in a stock index would be expected to be
associated with a 1% rise in the stock price. Likewise a stock with a beta of 2 would be expected
to experience a 2% price rise.A stock with a beta of 0.5 has an expected price rise (fall) of 0.5%
when the stock index rises (falls) by 1%.This view of beta sees it as a measure of market risk
(systematic risk – the risk to a share price of movements in the stock market as a whole). High
beta stocks tend to show high price volatility.
A second interpretation of beta views it in terms of the characteristic line.The characteristic
line relates the excess return of the individual stock (the excess of the stock return over the risk-
free interest rate) to the excess return of the stock index portfolio.A graph is drawn based on a
set of points that have excess return on the stock on the vertical axis,and the excess return on the
market index on the horizontal axis.These points are based on a series of observations from past
time periods (a time series). Figure 14.1 shows a hypothetical example of a characteristic line.
The points marked by an  are observed combinations of the excess return on the individual
stock (ri  rf) and the excess return on the stock index portfolio (rm  rf),where the stock index
portfolio is used as a proxy for the market portfolio.The characteristic line is the straight line that
301

provides the best ﬁt to the set of observed points.The beta of the stock is the gradient of the
characteristic line (a/b).The intercept of the characteristic line with the vertical axis is the alpha
(∝) of the stock.The vertical distances between the characteristic line and the observed points
reﬂect non-systematic risk (risk speciﬁc to a particular stock as opposed to systematic risk which
is the market risk to which all stocks are subject), whilst movements along the characteristic line
reﬂect systematic risk (the effects of changes in market return;beta is the measure of the magnitude
of those effects).
The alpha of a stock is its risk-adjusted excess return,in other words the amount by which the
excess return is above the level justiﬁed by beta. In equilibrium alpha will be zero.Arbitrage will
tend to move alpha towards zero (through purchases of positive alpha stocks and sales of negative
alpha stocks).
A third interpretation of beta is in terms of covariances and variances or,equivalently,in terms
of correlations and variances.
Beta  im / m
2
alternatively
beta  .i /m
im is the covariance between the returns on the individual stock and those on the market (or
stock index) portfolio,m
2 is the variance of the market (stock index) portfolio, is the coefﬁcient
of correlation between the returns on the individual stock and the returns on the market (stock
index) portfolio, i is the standard deviation of returns on the individual stock, and m is the
standard deviation of returns on the market (stock index) portfolio.
These three interpretations of beta are different ways of looking at the same thing.They are
alternative perspectives on the same measure of systematic (market) risk.
The third way of expressing beta () can be extended to illustrate the decomposition of the
variance of a share (or a portfolio of shares) into systematic (general market) risk and non-
systematic (sector- or ﬁrm-speciﬁc) risk.This decomposition is shown by the equation:
i
2  i

The variance of the share or portfolio (i

systematic risk (ei

When dealing with portfolios of shares, the non-systematic risk term ei
2 can be replaced by
Wi
2ei
2. In this case ei is the standard deviation of share i within the portfolio, and Wi is the
weight (by value) of share i in the portfolio.The effect, of an expansion in the number of stocks,
on the portfolio non-systematic risk can be understood by considering the case of equal weighting.
If the number of different stocks is N,the weighting of each stock is 1/N and Wi
2 is equal to 1/N2.
As N increases, 1/N2 diminishes rapidly causing non-systematic risk to decline.
In the case of actively managed portfolios,such as the majority of mutual funds,another source
of risk enters the equation.This is management risk.Management risk is the risk that the portfolio
manager produces a relatively poor performance with the effect that the portfolio provides a low
(risk-adjusted) rate of return.Exercise 14.1 illustrates the effect of management risk on the total
risk of a portfolio.
EXERCISE 14.1
A mutual fund has a beta of 0.9.The market risk (standard deviation of returns of the market
portfolio) is 20% p.a.,there is speciﬁc (non-systematic) risk of 10% p.a.,and there is a management
risk of 15% p.a.
(a) On the assumption that the three sources of risk are uncorrelated,what is the total risk of the
fund?
(b) What would be the total risk if there were correlations of 0.25 between the sources of
management risk and the sources of market risk,and 0.25 between the sources of management
risk and the sources of speciﬁc risk (and zero between market and speciﬁc risk)?
(c) How much has management risk added to total risk in cases (a) and (b)?

So the standard deviation (p) is √0.0424  0.2059 i.e. 20.59% p.a.
Management risk has added 29.31  20.59  8.72% p.a.
There are reasons for supposing that the sources of management risk are correlated with the
sources of both systematic risk and non-systematic risk.The sources of management risk can be
divided into market timing (tactical asset allocation) and stock selection. It seems reasonable to
presume that the effects of market timing are related to the size of the systematic risk (market
volatility). It also seems reasonable to presume that the sizes of the effects of stock selection are
related to the extent of non-systematic risk (ﬁrm-speciﬁc factors).
ESTIMATING FUTURE VALUES OF BETA
It is to be emphasised that stock index portfolios are used as proxies for the market portfolio,
which cannot be measured. It is therefore to be expected that the resulting measure of beta
is imperfect. Some researchers have noted that other sources of risk premiums are positively
correlated, and hence might be incorporated into a measure of beta. These sources include
ﬁrm size, price-earnings ratio, and the price/book-value ratio. A beta that takes account
of the fundamental characteristics of the ﬁrm, as well as its covariance with the market
portfolio, is known as a fundamental beta. Evidence suggests that fundamental beta produces
a better estimate of future beta than does historical beta alone, where historical beta is the
beta estimated from the characteristic line or from covariances and variances (Rosenberg and
Guy 1976).
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
304

Another reﬁnement used in forecasting beta is to adjust historical beta to reﬂect the observation
that portfolio betas tend to regress towards 1 over time (Blume 1971). Some users of individual
stock betas take the view that beta tends to revert to the mean where the mean is the market beta,
i.e. 1.When estimating future beta, this mean-reversion is taken into account by calculating a
weighted average of historical beta and the value 1.A weighting of 2/3 for the historical beta and
1/3 for 1 may be typical. So a beta estimated from the past to be 1.3 would become (1.3  2/3)
 (1  1/3)  1.2.
Such an adjusted estimate of beta is sometimes called a shrinkage estimate. Regression
towards 1 is not the only possible justiﬁcation for using shrinkage estimates of beta. Bayesian
mathematics provides another rationale (Pastor 2001).Bayesian estimates reﬂect not only sample
data but also prior knowledge. For example when considering an individual share, say Tesco, it is
known that it is a stock and that on average stocks have a beta of 1.This prior knowledge provides
an estimate of the Tesco beta (estimated to equal 1).The Bayesian estimate is then a weighted
average of the beta estimated from past data and the value 1. It is also known that Tesco is a
supermarket company.If supermarket companies on average have a beta of 0.8,this value provides
a third estimate of the Tesco beta.The Bayesian estimate would now be a weighted average of three
estimates.
It has been widely observed that betas for individual stocks are unstable over time whereas
portfolio betas exhibit much greater stability.This is consistent with the view that beta encompasses
a number of different sources of systematic risk (such as interest rates, exchange rates,
and commodity prices).An individual stock beta may be unstable as a result of the stock returns
reacting to changes in some of the sources of systematic risk underlying beta but not to others.
The market as a whole reacts to all sources of systematic risk but an individual stock responds
to only some of them. So the individual stock will appear to have a high beta at some times and a
low one at others, dependent upon which source of systematic risk is changing at the time.
Portfolios are likely to contain stocks which, taken together, react to a wide variety of sources of
systematic risk.
THE SINGLE INDEX MODEL
The estimation of portfolio risk using the Markowitz equation requires a huge input of data.The
standard deviation of returns is required for every security.In addition the coefﬁcient of correlation
of returns between each pair of securities is required. Since the available securities are numbered
in thousands,the number of correlations to be estimated is massive.Although the development of
computer technology has rendered the task feasible,there is an alternative approach that requires
less information.This alternative is the single index model, which has proven to be effective in
portfolio analysis.
To estimate the systematic risk of a portfolio, the single index model requires just the beta of
each stock and the standard deviation of the market portfolio.The standard deviation of returns
of the market portfolio is usually proxied by the standard deviation of a market index portfolio,
such as the portfolio that the FTSE 100 or the S&P 500 is based on.
The systematic risk of each stock equals its beta multiplied by the standard deviation of the
market portfolio.The beta of a portfolio is the weighted average of the betas of the individual
shares in that portfolio.The systematic risk of the portfolio is the portfolio beta multiplied by the
THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
305

standard deviation of returns of the market portfolio. For a well-diversiﬁed portfolio, systematic
risk approximates total risk.
THE SECURITY MARKET LINE
Risk on the capital market line is total risk (see Chapter 13 on portfolio diversiﬁcation).Total risk
is the sum of systematic (non-diversiﬁable) risk and non-systematic (diversiﬁable) risk.However,
all rational investors would be expected to hold the market portfolio.The market portfolio would
contain all investment assets. It follows that the market portfolio is perfectly diversiﬁed and has
only systematic (non-diversiﬁable) risk.If the market portfolio has only systematic risk,the variable
on the horizontal axis could be beta.
Investments along the capital market line are available to all investors.The risk of any investment
along that line (any combination of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio) will be limited to
systematic risk.Therefore when considering investments on the capital market line, beta can be
the measure of risk on the horizontal axis.
The derived relationship between required rates of return and betas is known as the security
market line (SML).For any security,or portfolio of securities,there is a required (expected) rate
of return related to the beta of the investment. Increases in beta (systematic risk) are associated
with increases in the expected rate of return. Systematic risk is compensated for by enhanced
expected return.The acceptance of non-systematic risk does not result in higher expected returns.
Since non-systematic risk can be eliminated by diversiﬁcation, and since rational investors are
assumed to eliminate it in this way, the acceptance of non-systematic risk is not rewarded by
increased expected returns.
The security market line (often referred to as the capital asset pricing model) can be described
by means of equation 1.In equation 1,E(Ri) represents the expected (required) rate of return on
security i. Rf is the return on the risk-free asset,  is the beta of the security, and E(Rm) is the
expected return on the market portfolio.
E(Ri)  Rf  [ E(Rm)  Rf ]
(1)
The expected (required) rate of return on security i consists of two components.The ﬁrst
component is the risk-free rate of return, Rf.The second component is the risk premium, shown
as [E(Rm)  Rf ].The risk premium is the reward for accepting systematic risk,which is measured
by beta.
The market portfolio is treated as having a beta of 1.So the risk premium of the market portfolio
is [E(Rm)  Rf] and the expected return is:
Rf  E(Rm)  Rf  E(Rm)
It might also be noted that if beta is zero,indicating an absence of systematic risk,the expected
return is the risk-free rate Rf.
The risk premium of a share (security), [E(Rm)  Rf], is the addition to the expected
(required) rate of return on the share arising from the systematic risk of the share.That addition
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
306

to return must reﬂect the risk preference of investors. If investors are highly risk-averse, the risk
premium should be high. If investors were risk tolerant, the risk premium would be lower.This
suggests that E(Rm) should be interpreted as the required rate of return on the market portfolio.
It is the rate of return required to compensate for accepting the systematic risk of the market
portfolio.However if markets are in equilibrium,E(Rm) can also be interpreted as the forecast rate
of return on the market portfolio.In equilibrium the forecast,or anticipated,rate of return equals
the required rate of return.Likewise in equilibrium E(Ri) can be interpreted as both the required
rate of return, and the forecast rate of return, on an individual security.
The application of the security market line is illustrated by Exercise 14.2.
EXERCISE 14.2
The rate of return on Treasury bills (a risk-free asset) is 5% p.a. over the next three months.The
expected rate of return on the FT All-Share Index portfolio over the same period is 8% p.a.An
investment trust portfolio has a beta of 1.2 and an expected rate of dividend yield of 4% p.a.What
might be the expected rate of capital growth of the investment trust portfolio?
Answer
The security market line (the capital asset pricing model) states that:
E(Rp)  Rf  (E[Rm]  rf)
i.e. E(Rp)  0.05  1.2 (0.08  0.05)  0.086
i.e. 8.6% p.a.
So the expected rate of return on the investment trust portfolio is 8.6% p.a., of which 4% p.a. is
in the form of dividend yield.So the expected rate of capital gain on the investment trust portfolio
is 8.6%  4%  4.6% p.a. Since the period under consideration is three months (1/4 of a year)
the per annum percentage needs to be divided by four.So the expected rate of capital growth over
three months is 4.6/4  1.15%.
TRADING RULES BASED ON THE SECURITY 
MARKET LINE (CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL)
The security market line provides a required rate of return. In equilibrium the required rate of
return would equal the anticipated rate of return. However the market for a particular security
may not be in equilibrium. If the market is out of equilibrium, trading opportunities would be
available.A trading opportunity is the ability to achieve an anticipated rate of return in excess of
the required rate of return (or to avoid an anticipated rate of return lower than the required rate).
Such opportunities are illustrated by Figure 14.2.

Estimating Anticipated Returns
There are many potential ways of estimating the future returns from holding a share.One approach
is based on the Gordon growth model.The Gordon growth model is a model for estimating the
fair (i.e. theoretical) price of a share.The equation is:
P  D/(r  g)
(2)
where P is the fair price of the share, D is the expected next dividend, r is the required rate of
return, and g is the expected growth rate of dividends.
The equation can be rearranged to give:
r  (D/P)  g
(3)
where r is the anticipated rate of return on the share, D the expected next dividend, P the
current share price, and g the expected growth rate of the share price. Equation 3 equates the
anticipated rate of return to the expected dividend yield (D/P) plus the expected rate of capital
gain on the share (g).
The question arises as to how g may be estimated. One approach is to use equation 4.
g  ROE  (1  d)
(4)
where g is the growth rate of the ﬁrm’s equity (net worth), ROE is the return on equity,
and d is the dividend payout rate (i.e. the proportion of proﬁts paid to shareholders). An
analogy can be drawn with a bank account;g can be looked upon as the rate of growth of the bank
balance, ROE is analogous to the rate of interest, and d is the proportion of the interest that is
withdrawn.
If ROE is assumed to be constant, the rate of growth of proﬁt (i.e. equity  ROE) equals the
rate of growth of the ﬁrm’s equity.Thus g is both the rate of growth of equity and the rate of growth
of proﬁt.
If the dividend payout rate is constant,the rate of growth of dividends equals the rate of growth
of proﬁts.Thus g is the rate of growth of equity,the rate of growth of proﬁts,and the rate of growth
of dividends.
Returning to the Gordon growth model (equation 2),it can be seen that (with a constant r and
g) the growth rate of the share price equals the growth rate of the dividends. So the expected
growth rate of the share price (i.e.the expected rate of capital gain) is equal to g,which is estimated
from equation 4.

EXERCISE 14.4
The share price of a company is 200p. Its expected next dividend is 5p.The dividend (and share
price) growth rate is expected to be 4% p.a.The risk-free interest rate is 4.5% p.a.The share has
a beta of 1.2 and the expected rate of return on the stock market as a whole is 8.5% p.a.
(a) Estimate the expected (forecast) rate of return on the share.
(b) Estimate the required rate of return.
(c) Consider whether the share is suitable for purchase.
Answers
(a) Rearranging the Gordon growth model gives an expression for expected (forecast) returns.
The Gordon growth equation:
P  D/(r  g)
(where P  share price, D  expected next dividend, r  required rate of return, and g is
the expected growth rate of dividends) can be rearranged to give:
R  (D/P)  g
(where R  forecast rate of return, and g  expected growth rate of dividends  expected
growth rate of the share price.* (D/P) is the expected rate of dividend yield and g the expected
rate of capital gain).
Thus
R  (5/200)  0.04  0.065
The forecast rate of return is 6.5% p.a.
(b) The security market line can be expressed as:
r  rf  [E(rm)  rf]
(where r  required rate of return, rf  risk-free rate of return,   beta of the share,
and E(rm)  expected return on the market).
Thus
r  0.045  1.2[0.085  0.045]  0.045  0.048  0.093
i.e. 9.3% p.a.
(c) The forecast rate of return, 6.5% p.a., is below the required rate of return, 9.3% p.a.This
share is not a good buy. In other words it is overpriced.
* The equality between the expected growth rate of dividends and the expected growth rate of the share price can be
seen from the Gordon growth model.
P  D/(r  g)
P(1g)  D(1g)/(r  g)
A growth in dividends of g produces a growth in the share price of g.
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
310

There are limitations to the usefulness of the security market line.Estimates of beta are subject to
statistical error; this is partly due to non-systematic risk. Betas can change over time, and hence
an estimate based on the past may not be a good guide to the future beta.The security market line
uses just one source of risk (market beta); other sources of risk may affect expected returns.The
expected return on the market portfolio is usually proxied by the expected return on a stock index
(since the market portfolio and its return are not measurable).The chosen stock index may not
be a good proxy for the market portfolio.The expected return on a stock index (portfolio) is very
uncertain since historical returns may not be a reliable guide to the future.
In the equation for the security market line (equation 1), E(Ri) is appropriately interpreted as
the required rate of return on the stock and E(Rm) as the required rate of return on the market
portfolio.E(Rm) reﬂects risk-aversion.High risk-aversion is associated with high required rates of
return; more return is required to compensate for risk.The required rate of return on a stock is
compared with the forecast rate of return on that stock, with a view to selecting stocks whose
forecast returns exceed their required returns. Likewise the required rate of return on stocks in
aggregate may be compared with the forecast rate of return when deciding upon whether part of
an investor’s wealth (or how much of that wealth) should be invested in shares.
Evidence from psychological research indicates that risk-aversion (and perception) is inversely
related to forecast returns.Alhakami and Slovic (1994) found that judgements of risk and beneﬁt
were inversely related.People in a positive mood perceive choices as less risky,and the prospective
outcomes as more favourable (Isen 1997; Nygren et al. 1996). Social mood is collectively shared
mood that is widespread in society.The socionomic hypothesis (Prechter 1999; Nofsinger 2005;
Olson 2006) sees risk-aversion declining and forecast returns increasing with improvements in
social mood (conversely with declining social mood);an inverse relationship between risk-aversion
and anticipated return. So circumstances that induce a more positive approach to risk taking also
enhance forecasts of return.A change in mood,either individual or collectively shared,inﬂuences
investment decisions in two ways that reinforce each other.
In terms of Figure 14.2, a decline in risk-aversion (or perception of risk) reduces the gradient
of the security market line.This is consistent with the requirement for less return to compensate
for risk. Simultaneously anticipated (forecast) return increases. Both changes enhance the
attractiveness of the investment; they reinforce each other.The converse would be the case for
adverse mood changes.
Supply and Demand
If the anticipated rate of return on a share differs from that derived from the security market line
(the required rate) the market is out of equilibrium.Since each investor has their own anticipations,
investors are likely to differ in their opinions as to whether the market for a security is in
equilibrium. Investors would also tend to differ in their views as to whether alpha is positive or
negative. In other words investors would differ in their views as to whether a share is overpriced
or underpriced.
This is consistent with a downward sloping demand curve for the asset. Investors who believe
that there is an anticipated return in excess of the required rate would see the market price as being
too low, and could be prepared to buy at a higher price than the current market price. Investors
with the opposite view regard the share as overpriced and would require a lower price before they
THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
311

considered buying. As the stock price falls an increasing number of investors will see it as
underpriced (offering an anticipated return in excess of the required return). Hence as the stock
price falls the number of investors willing to buy increases.The demand, supply, and equilibrium
price for the share are shown by Figure 14.3.
The line DD shows the number of shares demanded (by investors in aggregate) at each price.
The vertical line S indicates the number of shares issued.Pe is the equilibrium share price and the
actual share price should tend to equal the equilibrium share price.The price that each investor is
prepared to pay could be based on that investor’s use of a dividend discount model (with the
required rate of return obtained from the security market line) and/or the price-earnings ratio
(see Chapters 19 and 21 on dividend discount models and on ratio analysis, respectively).
OTHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS
Beta and the security market line have other applications in investment management.An investment
manager who attempts to time market movements might switch into high beta shares when market
rises are expected and into low beta stocks when prices are expected to fall.In this way gains from
a rising market are enhanced and losses from a falling market are reduced.
The slope of the security market line can be looked upon as the price of risk.A shallow slope
might incline an investment manager to hold low beta shares on the grounds that the reward, in
terms of expected extra return, is insufﬁcient to compensate for the risk of holding high beta

stocks.Conversely a steep gradient would favour the choice of high beta stocks since the expected
addition to return would be substantial.
The level of the security market line, relative to the yield on zero-beta investments such as
bonds,will inﬂuence the choice between shares and other investments.If the security market line
were high relative to bond yields,shares would offer relatively attractive returns.In such a situation
a portfolio would be weighted towards shares and away from bonds. If the security market line is
low relative to bond yields,portfolios are likely to have a lower proportion invested in shares.(This
highlights the point that,although the security market line uses the return on short-term risk-free
assets such as Treasury bills or high-grade bank deposits, arguably the relevant comparison for
share investments is the return on government bonds since both shares and bonds are long-term
investments.)
USING THE SINGLE INDEX MODEL TO MAKE THE
CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL OPERATIONAL
With respect to applying the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), there are two particular
difﬁculties to overcome. First the model uses a market portfolio that cannot be observed or
measured.The market portfolio contains every investment asset, ﬁnancial and physical, from
throughout the world. Even if it could be identiﬁed, many of its constituent assets are not traded
and hence could not be incorporated into portfolios.The other difﬁculty is that the CAPM is
expressed in terms of expectations of future values whereas observable data relates to the past.
The single index model is a variation on the ideas of the CAPM.The single index model uses a
broad stock index (such as the FTSE All-Share Index or the S&P 500) in place of the market
portfolio. It is based on observations of the past rather than expectations of the future.
The CAPM is expressed in terms of the security market line:
E(Rs)  Rf  [E(Rm)  Rf]
(5)
where E(Rs) is the required (expected) rate of return on a share, Rf is the risk-free rate of
return, is the beta of the share,and E(Rm) is the expected rate of return on the market portfolio.
The equation can be rewritten in excess return form as:
E(Rs)  Rf  [E(Rm)  Rf]
(6)
The single index model is written as:
RSt  RFt  	  (RIt  RFt)  et
(7)
where RSt is the observed return on a share during a period, RFt is the risk-free interest rate
during that period,	 is the average return (on the share) in excess of what would be expected on
the basis of the return on the index,  is the beta of the share, RIt is the observed return on the
stock index, and et is the deviation (during a period) of the excess return on the share from the
excess return that would be expected on the basis of 	, , RIt, and RFt. In terms of Figure 14.1,
et is the vertical distance between the characteristic line and the observed point for a period.
THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
313

The term et does not appear in the equation of the security market line because the expected
value of et, in a period, is zero.The security market line reﬂects the CAPM, which is based on
expectations.
The risk of a share, as measured by standard deviation of returns, is estimated as:
(2I
2  e
2)0.5
(8)
The term 2I
2 measures systematic risk, which is the risk from movements in the index (I
is the standard deviation of returns on the index portfolio).The term e
2 measures the non-
systematic risk, which is the risk speciﬁc to a particular share (e is the standard deviation of the
error terms, et).
If certain assumptions are made about the values of et, the parameters (	, , e) of the single
index model (equation 7) can be estimated by a statistical technique known as regression. In
particular the value of et in a period should be unrelated to its value in other periods, and should
also be independent of past and present values of RIt and RFt.
Regression analysis provides estimates of 	,,and e rather than their true values.Departure
of the estimates from true values can arise because of the random nature of the deviations et.The
random deviations produce ‘noise’ (irrelevant information).The noise distorts the statistical
estimates.The deviations, et, are assumed to average zero but in reality rarely do so. Randomly
chosen numbers may have a (statistical) expectation of a zero mean but the actual mean from a
sample is unlikely to be zero.The actual (non-zero) mean of the deviations will influence the
regression estimates of 	, , and e.
The estimated value of beta will be affected by a number of factors such as the time period from
which data is taken,the frequency of the data (daily,weekly,monthly),and the stock index chosen.
Taking monthly observations from the most recent ﬁve-year period of a broad market index is a
frequently used approach. The estimated beta should be stable over time (that is exhibit
stationarity).A beta value that does not exhibit stationarity is unreliable.
MULTIFACTOR FORMS OF THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
Fama and French (1993,1996) proposed a three-factor form of the capital asset pricing model.In
addition to the market excess return of the standard (i.e. one-factor) model, the three-factor
model adds factors relating to ﬁrm size and the value/growth distinction.The factor SMB is the
return on the shares of small ﬁrms minus the return on the shares of big ﬁrms.The factor HML
(high minus low book/market) is the return on value stocks minus the return on growth stocks.
The three-factor model can be written as:
RSt  RFt  	  1(RMt  RFt)  2(SMBt)  3(HMLt)  et
(9)
where RSt is the return on a share in period t,RFt is the risk-free interest rate,RMt is the market
return, and 1, 2, 3 are the betas relating to the three factors.
An additional factor that has been investigated is liquidity. Liquidity can be seen as the ability
to trade shares quickly, at low cost, and without signiﬁcantly moving the share price. Liquidity is
seen as desirable by investors and its absence may be a reason for enhanced return on an investment;
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
314

that is a premium. Pastor and Stambaugh (2001) set out to discover if liquidity risk is reﬂected in
share prices and returns. Using the Fama and French three-factor model, they found that 	 was a
function of sensitivity to liquidity.Stocks with high sensitivity to liquidity (i.e.with high liquidity
betas) exhibited higher returns. Liu (2006) also found a liquidity premium, which was additional
to the Fama–French three-factor premiums.
One implication of liquidity being a determinant of the required rate of return is that stock
market trading systems can have signiﬁcance for share prices.Trading systems that enhance liquidity
will reduce the liquidity premium within required returns.The reduction in required rates of
return will, according to dividend discount models, increase share prices.To the extent that high
trading volumes are associated with high liquidity,high volumes of stock trading could be expected
to help in lowering liquidity premiums.
Momentum is another factor that has been used in capital asset pricing models. Momentum
is the tendency for recent high returns (stock price increases) to persist for a time. So a stock
that has exhibited a recent high rate of return may be expected to have a higher return in
the (near) future. Adding a momentum term to the Fama–French three-factor model gives
equation 10.
RSt  RFt  	  1(RMt  RFt)  2(SMBt)  3(HMLt)  4 (UMDt)  et
(10)
The momentum factor, UMD (up-minus-down), measures the recent return on a portfolio of
the best performing stocks minus the recent return on a portfolio of the worst performing stocks.
Arguably adding the momentum factor incorporates a behavioural ﬁnance dimension to the capital
asset pricing model, since momentum is thought to arise from behavioural factors such as
representativeness, herding, and social mood (Hirschey and Nofsinger 2008).
Sapp and Tiwari (2006) suggested that retail investors tend to follow a strategy of selecting
mutual funds that have exhibited high recent returns.In consequence retail investors often initially
show apparent talent in the selection of mutual funds (this is sometimes called ‘the smart money
effect’).The momentum effect tends to conﬁrm the wisdom of their choices, in the period
immediately following the investments,as the stocks held by the chosen mutual funds continue to
perform relatively well.The behavioural ﬁnance concepts of overconﬁdence and illusion of control
could turn such initial success into exaggerated expectations of returns.
An alternative form of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is the Consumption-based capital
asset pricing model (CCAPM). According to the CCAPM the required return from a stock is
related to the extent that its returns protect consumption during economic downturns.When the
economy goes into recession incomes fall and it becomes difﬁcult to maintain consumption. If
investment yields also fall the impact on consumption is greater. Stocks that threaten reduced
dividends during economic downturns would be required to offer higher average returns in
compensation.So betas should reﬂect the sensitivity of stock yields to macroeconomic conditions.
If small company shares and value stocks pay dividends that fall during economic downturns, the
enhanced returns from such stocks are explained by the CCAPM.So the CCAPM may be capable
of explaining the usefulness of the Fama–French three-factor model (Jagannathan and Wang 2007).
Jagannathan and Wang pointed out that empirical evidence is not generally supportive of the
CCAPM and, in particular, the evidence does not indicate that the CCAPM could replace the
Fama–French three-factor version of the CAPM.

CONDITIONAL AND UNCONDITIONAL FORMS
OF THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
In equations such as 1, 9, and 10 the betas (1, 2, 3, etc.) are treated as being constant. Forms
of the capital asset pricing model with constant betas are known as unconditional forms.
Conditional forms allow the values of the betas to vary.Variation in beta over time is referred to
as time-varying risk. It can be argued that the proliferation of risk factors, as shown in equation
10, is the result of using unconditional forms when a conditional form of the capital asset pricing
model should be used (Scheicher 2000). Even if the evidence is seen as rejecting unconditional
forms of the capital asset pricing model, it does not necessarily refute conditional forms. It could
be the case that a one-factor conditional form is superior to multi-factor unconditional forms.
Not only might betas be time varying but also the aggregate risk premiums (RMt  RFt;SMBt;
HMLt;UMDt) could be time varying.A model is conditional if either betas and/or risk premiums
are time varying (Merton 1980).There is some evidence that aggregate risk premiums are related
to business cycles (see Chapter 18 on the economic environment). For example some studies
(such as Fama 1990; Lovatt and Parikh 2000) have found that market returns could be predicted
by the dividend yield on shares, the default spread on bonds (the difference between yields on
government and corporate bonds), and the term spread (the latter being the difference between
yields on short maturity and long maturity bonds).The studies found all three to be positively
related to expected (required) rates of return,and hence to aggregate risk premiums.The default
and term spreads were seen as having a business-cycle pattern; so the associations between those
spreads and required returns provided evidence for an association between the business cycle and
required returns (and hence risk premiums).
The evidence on the usefulness of conditional models is mixed. For example Lewellen and
Nagel (2006) concluded that variations in beta and the risk premium would have to be implausibly
large.The results of a study by Fletcher and Kihanda (2006) indicated that conditional models
performed better than unconditional models, although their results were not unambiguous.
CONCLUSION
The capital asset pricing model is one of the pillars of ﬁnance theory. Unfortunately it appears to
be a wobbly pillar.
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is used in investment analysis since the security market
line provides a required rate of return for a stock.This required rate of return is compared with
anticipated returns or used to discount expected dividends (see Chapter 19 on dividend discount
models).CAPM is used in the evaluation of portfolio performance,including the performance of
institutional fund managers, since it provides a means of risk adjustment (see Chapter 17 on
evaluating the performance of fund managers). CAPM, as a means of risk adjustment of returns,
has been central to empirical tests of the efﬁcient market hypothesis (see Part 7 on market
efﬁciency).Beta is used as a means of ascertaining hedge ratios when using stock index futures (see
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
316

Chapter 30 on hedging with stock index futures). CAPM, and the single index model, could be
regarded as providing a theoretical justiﬁcation for index tracker funds. The risk premium
component of the security market line provides a justiﬁcation for the excess of stock market returns
over returns from risk-free investments (as compensation for accepting risk).
Doubts about the capital asset pricing model arise from its assumptions, some of which are
clearly unrealistic. It assumes that all investors have the same expected holding period for
investments, that all investors have unlimited lending and borrowing facilities at the risk-free
interest rate, that all investors use the Markowitz model, and that all investors have identical
expectations about returns, risk, and correlations in relation to shares and other securities.
It could be argued that the validity of assumptions is not important so long as the model provides
good predictions. It has been argued that the capital asset pricing model is incapable of making
predictions because the market portfolio cannot be identiﬁed and measured. Attempts to test
predictions of CAPM give ambiguous results because failures may be due to failures of informational
efﬁciency rather than failures of the model (see Part 7 on market efﬁciency).It will be seen in the
next chapter that the empirical evidence on CAPM has often failed to support it. Further, some
researchers have found that the model needs to be amended in order to give good predictions. If
there is uncertainty as to which variation of CAPM should be used,there is uncertainty as to what
CAPM predictions are.

4. Critical evaluation of capital market theory.
5. The zero-beta capital asset pricing model.

ASSUMPTIONS OF THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is developed on the basis of a number of assumptions.
1.
Investors are able to hold a portfolio of all investment assets, the market portfolio. All
investment assets are divisible, so that fractions of assets can be held.
2.
Investors maximise returns for any level of risk (and minimise risk for any level of return).
Investors are risk-averse and measure risk in terms of standard deviations of returns.
3.
All investors have the same investment horizon. All investment decisions are made at the
beginning and no changes are made during the period of the investment horizon.
4.
All investors have the same expectations about risk and return on investment assets.
Information is freely available to all investors.
5.
There is a single borrowing and lending rate.
6.
There are no taxes and no transaction costs.All investors are allowed to sell short.
A central idea of the standard CAPM is that there is only one risk that affects the long-term average
return on an investment.That risk is market risk, which is the tendency of a stock to move in
response to movements in the market as a whole. Market risk is measured by beta. Beta is often

ALTERNATIVES AND CRITICISMS
319
approximated as the expected percentage change in a share price divided by the percentage
change in a stock index. High beta stocks embody greater market risk; their price volatilities
tend to be high relative to that of the market as a whole. (The multi-factor version of the CAPM
proposed by Fama and French (1993) moves the model away from its reliance on a single risk
factor.)
The capital asset pricing model is reﬂected in the security market line (SML).The equation for
the security market line is:
E(Ri)  Rf  (E[Rm]  Rf)
(1)
where E(Ri) is the expected (or required) rate of return on security i,Rf is the risk-free rate of
return (e.g.the return on Treasury bills), is the beta of the share,and E(Rm) is the expected return
on the market portfolio (where the market portfolio is often approximated by a stock index
portfolio).The term (E[Rm]  Rf) is referred to as the risk premium.
THE ARBITRAGE PRICING MODEL
Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) has been proposed as an alternative to the capital asset pricing
model.APT makes fewer assumptions than CAPM,particularly in regard to the market portfolio
(Ross 1976).A core idea of arbitrage pricing theory is that several systematic inﬂuences (rather
than just one) affect the long-term average returns of securities.As in the CAPM,risks other than
the systematic inﬂuences are regarded as diversiﬁable and hence are not compensated for by way
of increased expected returns.The several sources of systematic risk are dealt with by means of
using several betas.Each beta captures the sensitivity of the stock to the corresponding systematic
factor.Examples of systematic factors could include unexpected interest rate changes,unexpected
exchange rate movements, unexpected changes in the rate of inﬂation, and unexpected changes
in the level of industrial production (Chen et al. 1986).
Arbitrage pricing theory suggests that the security market line should be replaced by the
following equation (which uses the example of three systematic inﬂuences):
E(Ri)  Rf  1(RPF1)  2(RPF2)  3(RPF3)
(2)
where E(Ri) is the expected (or required) rate of return on the security and Rf is the return on
a risk-free asset.The three beta values applicable to the three risk factors are shown as 1,2,and
3.The three risk premiums are shown as RPF1 (Risk Premium of Factor 1), RPF2, and RPF3.
The theory stipulates neither the number,nor the nature,of the risk factors.This information has
to be obtained by empirical investigation.
The Role of Arbitrage
In the case of the capital asset pricing model,equilibrium exists when all stocks lie on the security
market line.If stocks exhibit risk/return combinations that deviate from the security market line,
arbitrage opportunities will arise.Those stocks that exhibit returns below the line can be sold
(sold short if necessary) and the proceeds used to buy stocks with expected returns above the line.

Such an arbitrage procedure allows an investor to increase expected returns without committing
more capital (in the case of short selling no capital is used).This arbitrage will involve selling
overpriced stocks and buying underpriced stocks.This will tend to move stocks on to the security
market line and hence restore market equilibrium.
There is a corresponding equilibrium relationship in the arbitrage pricing model.Instead of the
one-dimensional relationship of the CAPM (i.e.the security market line which uses only one risk
factor),APT has an n-dimensional relationship (n being the number of risk factors).In the case of
the CAPM, equilibrium requires all stocks to be on the security market line.This equilibrium
condition could alternatively be expressed as an absence of arbitrage opportunities.The equilibrium
relationship of arbitrage pricing theory can also be expressed as an absence of arbitrage
opportunities. However the arbitrage of APT needs to take account of all n risk factors.
If the arbitrage entails short selling (borrowing shares and selling them), the short positions
provide negative betas.The arbitrage transactions would be in a proportion that involves the positive
betas of purchased stocks exactly cancelling the negative betas of the short positions in stocks.There
would be net zero betas.The difference between the market values of the short and long positions
would be matched by investing, or borrowing, at the risk-free rate.
The stocks sold would tend to fall in price,and hence their expected rates of return would rise
towards the equilibrium rates.The stocks purchased would rise in price with the effect that the
expected rates of return fall towards the equilibrium rates.The pursuit of arbitrage proﬁts thus
tends to move stocks towards equilibrium.
According to the arbitrage pricing model, all investments (portfolios) with identical
risk characteristics should exhibit the same expected rate of return. If this is not the case, it is
possible to short sell stocks (portfolios of stocks) with low expected returns and buy those
with high expected returns.The purchases and sales should be such as to render all the net
betas equal to zero. In other words, the resulting portfolio is risk-free.The difference in the
costs of the two portfolios (short sold and bought) is matched by investing or borrowing at the
risk-free rate.The result is an arbitrage that produces a proﬁt without risk.Pursuit of such arbitrage
proﬁts will tend to move stock prices towards their equilibrium values. Equilibrium exists when
all stocks, and portfolios, with identical risk characteristics provide the same expected rate
of return.
An Example of Arbitrage
This example will use a one-factor version of the arbitrage pricing model for the sake of clarity of
exposition,but the principle extends to multi-factor versions of the model.Suppose it is possible
to construct a portfolio of stocks that provides a return that exceeds the return implied by the risk
of the portfolio. In equation 3 this is represented by a positive alpha ().
E(R1)  Rf    1(E[R]  Rf)
(3)
E(R1) is the anticipated return on portfolio 1,Rfis the risk-free return,1is the beta of portfolio
1, and E[R] is the expected return from the single risk factor (the return required to compensate
for the risk of that factor). By diversifying the portfolio all non-systematic risk is eliminated.The
positive alpha can be exploited in an arbitrage trade by taking a long position in (i.e. buying)
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
320

ALTERNATIVES AND CRITICISMS

portfolio 1 and taking a short position in (short selling) a portfolio with an alpha of zero (portfolio
2). Portfolio 2 provides the expected return E(R2) in equation 4.
E(R2)  Rf  2(E[R]  Rf)
(4)
The two portfolios should be combined with the following weights:
W1 
W2 
It is to be noted that the two weights add up to 1. If it were the case that portfolio 1 has a beta
of 0.8 and portfolio 2 has a beta of 1.2 (i.e. 1  0.8 and 2  1.2), the weights would be:
W1 
 3
W2 
 2
This provides a net beta of zero:
W1  1  3  0.8  2.4
W2  2  2  1.2  2.4
2.4  2.4  0
The alpha of the arbitrage portfolio is (based on the weighting of portfolio 1):
3  
So if  were 2% p.a.,the arbitrage portfolio would produce a return of 6% p.a.The monetary
amount by which the long portfolio exceeds the short portfolio is ﬁnanced by borrowing.The
interest paid on the borrowed money is matched by the risk-free component (the component that
excludes alpha) of the return on the arbitrage portfolio (the risk-free return component arises from
the fact that there is a net long position with zero beta).
Arbitrage should move alpha towards zero.The purchase of the positive alpha portfolio would
raise its price and hence reduce its return.The tendency of arbitrage to move alpha to zero ensures
that the return on a portfolio comprises the risk-free rate plus a component that compensates for
systematic risk.
The arbitrage of the arbitrage pricing theory would not take place unless it was risk-free.This
requires an absence of non-systematic risk.So the arbitrage process,and the resulting equilibrium
relationship between systematic risks and return, will only apply to well-diversiﬁed portfolios.
Arbitrage pricing theory does not generate a risk-return relationship for individual stocks.
The capital asset pricing model does produce a risk-return relationship (the security market
line) that applies to individual stocks as well as to portfolios. However the CAPM depends upon
the use of the market portfolio which is impossible to fully identify, measure, or trade.Arbitrage
pricing theory does not require the market portfolio to generate its results.The CAPM assumes
that all investors are rational and well informed.The APT merely requires that a small number of
arbitragers are rational and well informed.The CAPM assumes that all investors hold the same
portfolio (the market portfolio) whereas the APT does not. So APT requires fewer assumptions
than CAPM; in particular it does not need the assumptions relating to the market portfolio.

The Nature of Risk Factors
The risk factor used in the basic form of the CAPM is the excess return on the market portfolio,
(E[Rm]  Rf).The amount of exposure of an investment to that risk factor is measured by its beta.
Correspondingly the risk premium required by investors is proportional to the beta of the
investment.The risk premium, (E[Rm]  Rf), is the compensation required by investors for
accepting exposure to market risk.
The risk factors of the APT can also be described as excess rates of return.In each case the risk
factor is the addition to return required to compensate for accepting that particular risk (with a
beta of 1).The risk factor can, at least in principle, be measured by isolating the risk factor in
question. For each risk factor a portfolio (involving both long and short positions) is constructed
such that all other risk factors are zero (net betas are zero) and only one source of risk remains.
The resulting portfolio is known as a factor portfolio.The excess return on the factor portfolio
(portfolio return minus risk-free interest rate) is used as the risk factor within a multi-factor
version of the arbitrage pricing model.This deﬁnition of a risk factor might also be regarded as the
risk premium of that factor.The required return on a portfolio is the risk-free interest rate plus
the sum of factor risk premiums weighted by the factor betas.
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
Three UK studies (Clare et al. 1997a;Garrett and Priestley 1997;Antoniou et al. 1998) have found
four or ﬁve risk factors when investigating arbitrage pricing models.For example Clare et al. found
the return on the market portfolio, a price index (the RPI), bank lending, corporate bond yields,
and spreads between corporate bond yields and government bond yields to be risk factors.There
was some (but not perfect) consistency between the studies.
RETURNS ON BONDS
The factor approach to ascertaining the required rate of return on bonds parallels the approaches
of the capital asset pricing model and arbitrage pricing theory.Whereas the CAPM uses just one
factor (the excess return on the market portfolio) and APT uses a number of factors which can
vary according to the user, the factors employed when analysing bond returns tend to be related
to the yield curve.The yield curve is the relationship between bond yields on a per annum basis
(vertical axis) and bond maturity in years (horizontal axis).The two most important factors relate
to the level and slope of the yield curve. In particular an intermediate rate of interest (e.g. the
redemption yield on bonds with ten years to maturity) may be used to proxy the level of the yield
curve and the spread between short- and long-term interest rates (i.e. the difference between
them) may be used to proxy the slope of the yield curve.The equation for the required rate of return
can be presented as equation 5.

CRITICISMS OF CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
There are three main criticisms of the capital asset pricing model.There is the argument that it is
impossible to identify, and measure, the market portfolio.There is the point that it is not possible
for individual investors to borrow at the risk-free rate of interest.Third, there is the observation
that not all empirical studies have established a direct link between beta and average annual returns.
The argument that it is not possible to identify the market portfolio is often referred to as the
Roll critique (Roll 1977; Roll and Ross 1980). Since every investor is assumed to hold the same
portfolio, that portfolio must contain all available investments.All available investments includes
not only shares and bonds but also a wide range of other investments.Those other investments
include property, land, works of art, human capital, and other tangible and intangible assets.
Furthermore,those assets would be drawn from throughout the world.To approximate the market
portfolio with a national stock index would involve limiting the measure to one type of asset
(shares) in one country.Even an international stock index would exclude a wide variety of ﬁnancial
and non-ﬁnancial wealth.The Roll critique suggests that the capital asset pricing model can be
neither tested nor used since it rests on a wealth aggregate that cannot be measured,or even fully
identiﬁed.
The arbitrage pricing model avoids this critique because it does not require the use of the market
portfolio.The risk factors to be used are not predetermined by theoretical considerations; they
are to be established by empirical research.
The point about risk-free borrowing is as troublesome to arbitrage pricing theory as it is to the
capital asset pricing model. Individual investors are able to acquire risk-free assets, for example
Treasury bills issued by national governments or deposits in banks with high credit ratings.However
individuals are not free of default risk, consequently they cannot expect to be able to borrow at a
risk-free rate.The lenders would require a risk premium to compensate for the risk of default by
individual investors.One consequence of this is that the capital market line takes the shape shown
in Figure 15.1.
In Figure 15.1,Rd is the rate of interest at which money can be deposited or invested (the risk-
free rate).The rate of interest at which money can be borrowed is shown as Rb.The range of
investment alternatives is no longer shown as a straight line tangent to the efﬁciency frontier.The
range is shown as Rd-A-B-C. Signiﬁcantly this new range includes part of the efﬁciency frontier,
A-B.An implication of this is that investors will not all hold exactly the same portfolio of risky assets.
Any portfolio between A and B could be held by rational investors.
Another implication of an inability to borrow and lend at the same rate concerns the choice of
techniques for acquiring high beta portfolios. If an investor wants a high beta portfolio, there are
two alternatives.The investor could buy a portfolio of high beta stocks, or the investor could
borrow in order to hold a larger portfolio of lower beta stocks. If borrowing rates are relatively
high investors are more likely to choose the ﬁrst method.The demand for high beta stocks would
be higher than the CAPM predicts.In consequence high beta stocks would be relatively overpriced
and their returns lower than would be predicted on the basis of their betas. High beta stocks

would not provide full compensation, by higher expected returns, for their relatively high
systematic risks.
THE ZERO-BETA CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
Referring back to Figure 15.1, when investors have a choice of efﬁcient portfolios the chosen
portfolio could be on the curved efﬁciency frontier between points A and B. In Figure 15.2 such
a point is indicated as D.
Taking a tangent at point D gives the broken line that intercepts the vertical axis at R0.The rate
R0 can be transferred into the ﬁgure for the security market line,as shown in Figure 15.3.The result

is the zero-beta security market line (or zero-beta capital asset pricing model).In Figure 15.3 the
market portfolio (the chosen portfolio on the efﬁciency frontier, point D) has a beta of 1 and an
expected return of Rm (the market return).The zero-beta security market line has a slope that is
less steep than that of the normal security market line.
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
The third source of criticism of the CAPM arises from the empirical evidence on the relationship
between beta and average annual returns.Not only is the evidence mixed,but also it is bedevilled
by the difﬁculty of separating tests of the capital asset pricing model from tests of the efﬁcient
market hypothesis.A failure to ﬁnd a relationship between beta and returns could be due to an
inadequacy of either, or both, of the theories.There have been fewer tests of the APT than of the
CAPM,and hence it remains to be seen whether the APT is a better predictor of investment returns
than the CAPM.
Two early empirical studies of the capital asset pricing model supported the zero-beta version.
These studies were by Black et al. (1972) and Fama and MacBeth (1973). Not only did they ﬁnd
that the security market line intersected the vertical axis above the risk-free interest rate,but they
also found that the vertical intersect and gradient of the line varied between periods.In particular
it appeared that there were periods during which the gradient was downward sloping, in other
words there were times when higher beta entailed lower returns.
A body of evidence has supported the positive relationship between beta and returns; some
studies were based on individual stocks and some on portfolios of shares.Kothari et al. (1995) and
Clare et al. (1998) found positive relationships between beta and return for individual stocks.

Sharpe and Cooper (1972), Chan and Lakonishok (1993), and Grundy and Malkiel (1996)
demonstrated that high beta portfolios have higher returns than low beta portfolios.
However other studies have either refuted the usefulness of beta as a predictor of relative
returns, or suggested that beta is not the only risk factor that is related to returns. Such studies
include Basu (1977), Banz (1981), Fama and French (1992, 2006), Chan and Chui (1996), Miles
and Timmermann (1996),Strong and Xu (1997),and Liu (2006).Factors that appeared to explain
returns (either in addition to,or instead of,beta) included book-to-market ratios,price-earnings
ratios,ﬁrm size,momentum,and liquidity.Book-to-market ratios (the ratio of the book value per
share to the share price) often appeared to be signiﬁcant. Some studies suggested that non-
systematic (i.e.diversiﬁable) risk was related to returns.Such studies included Friend et al. (1978),
Gooding (1978), Lakonishok and Shapiro (1984), Fuller and Wong (1988), and Corhay et al.
(1988).Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003) found that non-systematic risk was related to returns whereas
systematic risk was not; the converse of what the capital asset pricing model suggests.
A form of the capital asset pricing model that treats beta as constant over time is referred to as
an unconditional capital asset pricing model. Some research, which has been carried out on the
one-factor (market-risk premium) version of the model,has allowed beta to vary over the business
cycle.The form of the model that entails such a time-varying beta is referred to as the conditional
capital asset pricing model.The evidence on the usefulness of the conditional model is mixed
(Lewellen and Nagel 2006).
MUTUAL FUNDS AND THE DEATH OF BETA
Erosion of conﬁdence in the strength, or existence, of a positive relationship between beta and
returns has been referred to as the death of beta. Karceski (2002) suggested that the weakness of
the relationship could be explained in terms of the importance of mutual funds,and the response
of mutual fund managers to the behaviour of retail investors.
Karceski observed that people invested in mutual funds about eight times as much during bull
(rising) markets as during bear (falling) markets. Since mutual fund managers tend to be paid in
relation to the size of funds under management,they would want to maximise cash inﬂows during
bull markets.Retail investors favour mutual funds showing relatively strong recent performance.
Achievement of strong performance in bull markets,relative to other funds,might be obtained by
holding a portfolio of high beta stocks.The eight-to-one investment ratio between bull and bear
markets implies that the relative gain from high beta stocks during bull markets outweighs the
relative loss during bear markets,with respect to maximising cash inﬂows from retail investors over
stock market cycles. Karceski found that, on average, the shares held by mutual funds had betas
higher than one.Bathala et al. (2005) also found that institutional investors,such as mutual funds,
had a preference for higher beta stocks.Antunovich and Laster (2003) provided another reason
why mutual fund managers might prefer high beta stocks.Top performers among mutual fund
managers are rewarded disproportionately to managers whose performance is average (Brown et
al. 1996).This reward structure increases the motivation to outperform, and to accept increased
risk in the pursuit of outperformance.
If mutual fund managers favour high beta shares there would be a disproportionate demand for
such shares, which would cause a rise in their prices relative to lower beta shares.The rise in the
prices of higher beta stocks would bring about a fall in their percentage rates of return (since the
CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
326

ALTERNATIVES AND CRITICISMS
327
money value of returns would be divided by higher prices).The result would be a weakening of
the relationship between beta and returns.The mutual fund bias against lower beta shares would
lower those share prices and hence raise returns,further reducing any positive relationship between
beta and returns.The conclusion is that the rise in the relative importance of institutional investors,
such as mutual funds,in stock markets may be a factor in reducing (or eliminating) the relationship
between beta and returns.In other words the increase in the importance of mutual funds has been
a causal factor in the death of beta.
CONCLUSION
Arbitrage is central to much of ﬁnance theory, particularly in relation to establishing equilibrium
prices. So it is not surprising that a capital market theory based on arbitrage has emerged: the
arbitrage pricing model.
The arbitrage pricing model avoids some of the doubtful assumptions of the capital asset pricing
model.In particular it does not need to assume the ability to identify a market portfolio containing
all investment assets. However it does assume the effectiveness of arbitrage; and it requires very
sophisticated arbitrage.
In Chapter 23 on the concepts and weak form evidence of market efﬁciency,it will be seen that
very simple arbitrage often fails. Effective arbitrage requires arbitragers to process considerable
amounts of information. It also requires that arbitragers are able to borrow without limit.The
limitless borrowing potential not only relates to money but also to borrowing investment assets
such as shares and bonds.This assumption does not hold.In fact many investors are not even allowed
to borrow shares and bonds.
The real test might be whether the arbitrage pricing model produces good predictions, or at
least better predictions than the capital asset pricing model.Thus far there is a limited amount of
evidence on this. One problem for researchers is that the model does not indicate the nature of
the risk factors to be used.


Part 5
Portfolio Management


Chapter 16
Styles of portfolio construction
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Active and passive fund management.
2. Index (tracker) funds.
3. Stages of portfolio construction.
4. Goals-based investing.
5. Value stocks and growth stocks.
6. Style investing and style rotation.
7. Hedge funds.
8. Ethical investing.
9. Emerging market funds.
A portfolio manager faces a number of choices in relation to portfolio construction.In particular
there is the choice between active and passive management.This choice may be made in relation
to each of a number of stages of portfolio construction.
ACTIVE AND PASSIVE MANAGEMENT
Active portfolio management attempts to outperform the market by choosing investments that
are likely to show high returns.The market is often proxied by a broad-based stock index,such as
the S&P 500 or the FTSE All-Share Index.Active portfolio managers believe that they have the
ability to identify the individual securities (shares and bonds),sectors,or asset classes (shares and
bonds are the main asset classes) that will perform relatively well.In effect this involves the belief
that the fund manager has superior knowledge or understanding that provides a forecasting ability
that is better than that of other market participants. Asset prices reﬂect the market consensus
forecasts,active portfolio managers believe that they have the ability to produce forecasts that are
better than the market consensus.Active portfolio managers take the view that they can identify
situations in which the consensus of other investors is incorrect as to what the price of a security
331

should be.Active fund managers may alternatively (or additionally) take the view that they can
successfully time markets.Market timing is the attempt to identify points where the market is about
to rise or about to fall.The fund manager would aim to sell before falls and buy before rises.Market
timing is alternatively known as tactical asset allocation.
Portfolio managers who employ a passive style do not seek to outperform the market.They
operate as if either assets are fairly priced or it is not possible to make proﬁts from any mispricing.
Passive management can take one of three forms: a buy-and-hold strategy, responsive portfolio
changes, and index tracking.
PASSIVE MANAGEMENT
In the buy-and-hold strategy of passive management,the fund manager buys a portfolio of securities
and holds them for the duration of the investment horizon (the investment horizon is the period
for which the investment will be held).While the portfolio is held no attempt is made to change
its composition.There may be a dimension of active management in the original construction of
the portfolio, but thereafter the portfolio is left unaltered.
A second form of passive management involves portfolio changes, but not changes that result
from the fund manager taking views that differ from the market consensus.This type of passive
management entails adjusting the composition of the portfolio in response to three types of change.
The three factors whose variations can lead to alterations in the portfolio are the risk-free interest
rate, the consensus view on the risk and return characteristics of the market portfolio, and the
degree of risk-aversion exhibited by the investors on whose behalf the fund is managed.This form
of passive fund management entails holding a combination of a risk-free investment (such as a bank
deposit) and a portfolio of risky securities (which is likely to be the portfolio corresponding to a
stock index).A rise in the risk-free interest rate would cause an increase in the proportion of the
fund held on deposit. A rise in the (market consensus) expected return on the portfolio of
securities, or a fall in the consensus expectation of risk, would cause the fund manager to switch
money from deposits into the portfolio of securities. Increased risk-aversion on the part of the
investors in the fund would lead to the manager increasing deposits as a proportion of the fund.
The relative proportions of risk-free and risky investments (e.g. bank deposits relative to shares)
within the fund are subject to frequent change,but not as a result of the portfolio manager trying
to outperform the market by forecasting asset price movements.
INDEX TRACKING
A third type of passive management entails the attempt to track the performance of a stock index.
Such funds are known as index funds or tracker funds. Index funds give up the possibility of
outperforming an index for the security of not underperforming.
An index (tracker) fund aims to replicate the performance of a stock index.The emergence of
index funds arose from the observation that actively managed funds fail,on average,to outperform
stock indices.This is related to the issue of market efﬁciency.Active fund management is predicated
on the view that portfolio managers can forecast market movements and the performance of
individual stocks relative to the market. If the efﬁcient market hypothesis is correct, it is not
possible to consistently forecast either overall market movements or the relative performance of
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
332

individual stocks. If this is the case, investors should avoid the transaction and management costs
associated with actively managed funds by investing in index funds whose aim is merely to move
in line with the stock market.
The ﬁrst issue to resolve is the question of which index to track.This largely depends upon the
objectives of the fund manager. For a fund that aims to track the UK market, a fund manager
wishing to focus on the shares of large companies may choose the FTSE 100 whereas a fund manager
looking for a broader portfolio may choose the FTSE All-Share Index.
The choice of index would be inﬂuenced by the fact that many fund managers are prevented
from buying particular shares. Some countries have regulations that prevent certain shares being
acquired by foreign investors.Overseas managers of index funds would choose indices that exclude
those shares. Some share issues are not fully marketed; for example parts of some privatisation
issues may continue to remain in the hands of the government.There are stock indices that include
only the marketed component of share issues when weighting shares in the index.Those indices
are likely to be the ones preferred by the managers of index funds,who wish to avoid any liquidity
problems arising from share issues that are only partially available for investors.
One advantage of index funds over a buy-and-hold strategy of passive investment is that the
index fund may provide an optimal level of diversiﬁcation whereas a buy-and-hold strategy is less
likely to do so.The market portfolio of the capital asset pricing model is the ultimate perfectly
diversiﬁed portfolio.When using a broad stock index as the benchmark to track, an index fund
could be seen as seeking to approximate the market portfolio of the capital asset pricing model.
To the extent that this is the case, the capital asset pricing model might be seen as providing a
theoretical justiﬁcation for index funds.
One advantage of index funds, relative to actively managed funds, is that they are more likely
to ensure that the portfolio remains well diversiﬁed.Actively managed funds,in their attempts to
outperform the market, may hold poorly diversiﬁed portfolios. For example they may tilt the
portfolio towards particular industries.To the extent that actively managed funds hold inadequately
diversiﬁed portfolios, they sacriﬁce part of the risk-reduction beneﬁt of diversiﬁcation.
However these arguments rest on the use of a suitable stock index. Some stock indices fail to
provide optimal diversiﬁcation.For example in October 2005 the top ten UK companies accounted
for 54% of the FTSE 100 Index,and that top ten was concentrated in just four sectors (oil,banks,
pharmaceuticals, and telecoms). Even the FTSE All-Share Index, which is broader, was
concentrated in four sectors:oil & gas (18%),banks (17%),pharmaceuticals (8%),telecoms (8%).
Even if a stock index provides a reasonable degree of diversiﬁcation at a point in time, changes in
relative share prices can cause the index to become unbalanced. Kat (2004) cited the example of
the S&P 500,in which technology and ﬁnancial services stocks together accounted for about 18%
of the index in 1990.By 2000 the combined weighting of those two sectors had risen to about 44%.
Another advantage of index tracker funds,to the individual investor in collective investments,
is that they avoid management risk (alternatively known as active risk).The performance of actively
managed funds can,during any period of time,vary considerably.Some will outperform the index
and others will underperform it.The variation between the best and the worst can be considerable.
For example over the ten-year period to 1 October 2005 the best performing unit trust/OEIC in
the UK equity sector provided total returns of 346% whereas the worst performer lost 4%.Over
the same period three index tracker funds gained 97%,97%,and 98%,the FTSE All-Share Index
produced 111%, and the average (median) unit trust/OEIC provided 92% (Money Management,
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
333

October 2005). If the direction and size of the deviations from the index occur by chance, as
empirical evidence seems to suggest, the individual investor faces a management risk. Individual
investors bear the risk that their chosen funds will be relatively poor performers. By investing in
index tracker funds they avoid this management risk.
Probably the greatest advantage of index funds is that they are much cheaper to run than actively
managed funds. For example many actively managed UK unit trusts and OEICs have a 6% initial
charge, an annual 1.5% management charge, and transaction costs around 1% per year.This
contrasts with index tracker funds which typically have a zero initial charge, a 0.5% annual
management charge,and minimal transaction costs.At the time of writing the cheapest UK index
tracker fund had a zero initial charge and a 0.1% annual management charge.
A drawback of index funds is that they tend to omit the shares of very small ﬁrms. Even broad
indices have a cut-off in terms of company size. For example in the UK the FTSE All-Share Index
covers about 750 stocks.This eliminates more than 1,000 ﬁrms whose capitalisation is not sufﬁcient.
Actively managed funds are able to include any stocks,including those with very small capitalisations.
Another drawback is that an index tracker fund will hold disproportionately high amounts of
overpriced shares,and disproportionately low amounts of underpriced shares.Even if it is accepted
that it is not possible to identify mispriced shares, or to make proﬁts from identiﬁed mispricing,
it may still be the case that many shares are mispriced. Stock indices, on which index tracking
funds are based,are normally value-weighted indices.The proportions of stocks in the indices,and
hence in index tracking funds, reﬂect the relative market capitalisations of the respective
companies. Since market capitalisation is equal to the number of shares in issue multiplied by the
share price, overpriced shares will have excessively high capitalisations and underpriced shares
will have disproportionately low capitalisations.Index tracking funds will therefore have excessive
holdings of overpriced shares and too few underpriced shares. This will be bad for fund
performance.This is a problem for the whole of the fund management industry,not just for index
tracking funds. If indices are biased towards overpriced shares it is because the stock market is
similarly biased.In turn the average portfolio will have an overweight holding of overpriced shares
(and be underweight in underpriced shares).
One suggested solution for tracker funds is to use measures other than market capitalisation
on which to base the size weighting.Possible alternative measures of size include proﬁts,dividends,
sales, and book value. For the fund management to remain passive the size criterion must be
permanently adhered to.However the initial choice of size criterion would impart an active aspect
to the fund management. Funds that use such approaches to weighting are sometimes called
fundamental trackers. An example of a situation in which they would have been superior to
conventional index trackers was the bubble in high technology stocks in the late 1990s.The
extraordinary rise in the prices of high technology stocks massively increased their market
capitalisations and hence raised their weightings in index tracker funds.When the bubble burst,
the tracker funds lost money. Holding high technology stocks in proportion to their proﬁts,
dividends, or book value would have kept them at a tiny weighting within the tracker funds and
the large losses would have been avoided.
One problem with fundamental trackers is that rebalancing of shareholdings would be required
as relative proﬁts,dividends,sales,or book value changed.Rebalancing entails transaction costs and
may involve buying when prices have risen and selling when they have fallen. For example if a
fundamental tracker weights holdings in proportion to proﬁts, the shares of a company whose
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
334

proﬁts have risen may need to be bought.If the rise in proﬁts (or the anticipation of the rise) were
accompanied by a rise in the share price, the fund may be buying the shares after their price has
risen.A conventional index tracker would unambiguously gain from the price rise.A conventional
index tracker would also avoid transaction costs in that rebalancing automatically follows the
market; if the market capitalisation of a company rises because of an increase in its share price, its
weighting in the tracker portfolio would automatically rise as a result of the higher share price.
A further difﬁculty faced by open-ended mutual funds (unit trusts and OEICs) that track indices
arises when redemptions exceed new investment.Actively managed funds tend to keep a small
proportion of the fund in cash with a view to using that cash to ﬁnance withdrawals. If an index
tracker fund holds cash, the part of the fund held in cash will not track the index.This would be a
source of tracking error.If 100% of the fund is held in shares,the portfolio could be unbalanced by
the sale of shares in order to ﬁnance redemptions by investors.One way round this problem would
be to match cash holdings with stock index futures,particularly since futures can be traded quickly
and cheaply. Cash can be held and exposure to the index maintained by using stock index futures.
Futures, matched by cash, may provide a means of avoiding the potentially unbalancing effects of
small inﬂows and outﬂows.Inﬂows and outﬂows of cash can be accompanied by purchases and sales
of stock index futures with the effect that a balanced exposure to the stock index is maintained.
METHODS OF INDEX TRACKING
There are four main methods of indexation:full replication;stratiﬁed sampling;optimisation;and
synthetic funds.
Full Replication
This may be achieved by holding all the stocks in the index in the proportions in which they occur
in the index.Whereas this could be feasible for indices covering a small number of individual
stocks, more broadly based indices are difﬁcult to replicate in this way.Tracking a narrow index
by full replication will be reasonably accurate and will involve few portfolio changes (which will
occur only when the composition of the index changes).However a narrow index may not provide
a well-diversiﬁed portfolio.
The management of even a narrow index has its problems.For example dividends would need
to be reinvested in the index proportions, and this may entail some small transactions that are
disproportionately expensive.Indices do not have management and brokerage costs whereas index
funds do incur such costs.Such costs make it unlikely that perfect tracking will be achieved (there
will be some tracking error).When attempting to fully replicate a broad index the problems
increase. In particular a broad index may include stocks that are small and illiquid.The trading of
small illiquid stocks can be disproportionately expensive,and may in some instances not be possible.
Stratiﬁed Sampling
The tracking of a broad index involves constructing a portfolio with characteristics similar to those
of the index portfolio.Tracking a broad index will involve more frequent portfolio changes and
less accuracy (there will be more tracking error) since perfect replication of the index is unlikely.
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
335

On the positive side a broad index is likely to provide a more balanced portfolio,and one that more
faithfully represents the overall market.
Stratiﬁed sampling is one approach to the construction of a fund that tracks a broad index.
Instead of holding all the stocks in an index, stratiﬁed sampling holds only a sample of the stocks.
It is likely that the shares of all companies above a particular size are held. For example if a UK
index fund is based on the (more than) 750 shares in the FTSE All-Share Index, it may be that all
of the top 100 stocks are held (in the same proportions as in the index).A representative sample
of the remaining shares is then purchased.There are many ways in which the sampling could be
undertaken.
A sampling technique should try to ensure that the portfolio held reﬂects the index being
tracked.It may be that the portfolio held invests in sectors proportionately to the sector distribution
of the index.This may be further reﬁned in order to have a similar distribution between large,
medium, and small companies. There could even be further reﬁnements in terms of other
characteristics of the companies and their shares.
Generally the tracking error from stratiﬁed sampling can be expected to be a little greater than
from full replication.However holding a sample,rather than all of the shares in the index,is likely
to reduce brokerage costs.There is a trade-off; more precise tracking may entail increased costs.
It should be borne in mind that, since transaction costs produce some downside tracking error, it
could even be the case that the stratiﬁed sampling approach reduces tracking error.
Optimisation
Optimisation is a sample method based on the view that stock returns are determined by a set of
attributes such as size, price-earnings ratio, volatility, liquidity, etc. (Rudd 1980). Optimisation
attempts to ensure that the shares in the portfolio reﬂect the attributes of the shares covered by
the stock index. Shares for the portfolio are chosen in an attempt to mirror the attributes of the
shares in the index.
One problem with optimisation is that it relies on the past being a good guide to the future. In
particular it relies on historical risk-return relationships continuing into the future,which may not
happen.Also as the attributes–of the market and of individual stocks–change,portfolio rebalancing
will be needed.This raises transaction costs and allows tracking error if there are any delays. It
should also be remembered that statistical relationships are never precise;statistical estimates are
subject to errors that could undermine the reliability of the sampling.

Synthetic Index Funds (Futures Funds)
Synthetic index funds involve the use of stock index futures, and will be discussed further
in Part 8 on stock index futures. A stock index futures contract is a notional agreement to
buy a portfolio of shares (the portfolio reﬂected by the stock index) on a future date at a price
(index level) agreed in the present. Stock index futures reﬂect the actual (spot) stock index
and tend to show parallel price movements. Buying futures contracts does not entail an

expenditure of money; a relatively small (returnable) deposit called initial margin is all that
is required.
Futures funds keep most of the investment in bank deposits (or cash equivalent investments such
as Treasury bills) and use a small portion to meet the initial margin requirements of futures
contracts.The futures contracts provide exposure to movements in the stock index.The result is
an investment that is the equivalent of a full replication index tracker fund.
Futures funds have a number of advantages when compared with other approaches to
constructing index tracker funds (Bruce and Eisenberg 1992).One advantage is simplicity in that
only one instrument is bought, the futures contract, rather than a large number of individual
stocks. Also the potentially complex decision-making of sampling and optimisation is avoided.
Futures also tend to have lower transaction costs: lower commissions, smaller bid-offer spreads,
and typically no taxes. Liquidity is normally not a problem with futures whereas it could be a
problem with many stocks.When money ﬂows into, and out of, a fund on a continuous basis the
adjustments to a futures fund are much easier than in the case of a share-based fund.
Futures funds have some disadvantages relative to other index tracker funds.One disadvantage
is that futures are not available for all stock indices. For example they are available for the FTSE
100 but not the FTSE All-Share Index whereas most UK index tracking funds are based on the FTSE
All-Share Index.There is also a risk that the futures will be mispriced at the time of purchase,and
that they are bought when overpriced. Since futures tend to have short maturities (especially the
liquid contracts) they need to be rolled over (replaced with new contracts) at frequent intervals.
The risk of mispricing will occur at each rollover date.
TRACKING ERROR
Portfolios constructed to replicate an index rarely succeed in precisely tracking the index.Tracking
error is the amount by which an index tracker fund deviates from its benchmark index.The tracking
error is the difference between the total return on the index tracker fund and the total return on
the index.The total return consists of both dividends and capital gains (or losses).
The portfolio may hold all the stocks in the index, with weights corresponding to those
of the index. This involves little tracking error but can involve signiﬁcant transaction costs.
Alternatively a subset of the index might be used.This approach reduces transaction costs but
increases tracking error. However it should be remembered that transaction costs impart a
(downward) tracking error.
Even if the portfolio contains all the stocks in the index, appropriately weighted, there are
sources of tracking error.The constituent stocks of an index are subject to change. Replacing
stocks involves transaction costs. Furthermore the replacement is not instantaneous.Tracking is
imperfect during the time taken to replace stocks.
Changes in the composition of an index can affect stock prices. If index tracker funds are
widely used, stocks leaving the index will be sold in large numbers by index tracker funds.
As a result their prices fall and the funds receive unfavourable prices. Conversely stocks entering
the index will be bought by index tracker funds with the effect that their prices rise.The funds
thus buy these stocks at raised prices. So the marginal stocks, those prone to move in and out of
an index,are sold at low prices and bought at high prices.This weakens the performance of index
tracking portfolios.
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
339

It is not just the sales and purchases of the funds that will affect the prices of the marginal stocks.
Other traders (arbitragers), in anticipation of the reconstitution of stock indices, would seek to
take advantage by selling the stocks to be removed and buying the stocks to be added.When the
sales by index tracker funds reduce the prices of deleted stocks arbitragers would buy back at the
lower price (having sold at a higher price). Likewise arbitragers, having initially bought stocks to
be added,would subsequently sell the added stocks when the purchases by index funds have driven
their prices up.Stocks expected to be removed will fall in price before the reconstitution date,and
the prices of prospective additions will rise.By the reconstitution date prospective deletions would
have fallen in price,and prospective additions would have experienced price rises.Deleted stocks
may subsequently rise in price, and additions fall in price, when arbitragers subsequently reverse
their positions.The result is that index tracker funds experience losses on stocks to be deleted,prior
to the reconstitution date, and losses on added stocks subsequent to the reconstitution date.
Whilst there seems to be no doubt that stock prices move around the time of the reconstitution
date,there is some controversy concerning whether they subsequently fully return to their previous
prices.In other words,there is a question as to whether some or all of the initial price movement
is permanent.The view that initial price changes are fully reversed is known as the Price Pressure
Hypothesis and the view that they are permanent is the Imperfect Substitution Hypothesis.
According to the price pressure hypothesis, prices revert as arbitragers unwind their arbitrage
positions or as other investors switch to other stocks.If prices have risen,other investors may sell
the expensive stocks and buy cheaper stocks; conversely when prices have fallen.According to
the imperfect substitution hypothesis there are impediments to arbitrage and other investors do
not switch because other stocks are not good substitutes in their portfolios. Studies of these
hypotheses include those of Lynch and Mendenhall (1997) on the S&P 500 and Vespro (2006) on
the FTSE 100, CAC 40 and SBF 120. Both studies indicated that there was partial reversion of
prices, with the Vespro results being the closer to complete price reversion. It appears that index
tracker funds tend to change their portfolios close to index reconstitution dates despite the price
disadvantages incurred.
Madhavan and Ming (2003) report a study by Blitzer according to which additions to the S&P
500 index tended to gain 8.5% between the announcement and reconstitution dates,whilst stocks
removed fell by an average of 11.7%.The price changes reversed subsequent to the reconstitution
dates.There are reasons to believe that indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index (the index most
commonly tracked by UK index funds) are less susceptible to such effects.In the case of the FTSE
All-Share Index,additions and subtractions are likely to be a very small proportion of the value of
a fund.In the case of the S&P 500,the additions and subtractions could be a signiﬁcant proportion
of the total fund value since S&P 500 additions and subtractions are decided by committee rather
than by criteria such as relative size (for example additions and subtractions in the FTSE 100 are
based on replacing declining ﬁrms with growing ﬁrms so that the index continues to represent the
largest UK companies).Another problem with the S&P 500 system is that there is a chance that
the additions and subtractions could be of substantially different sizes with the effect that
rebalancing may be necessary throughout the portfolio (replacement of a relatively small
capitalisation stock with a large one requires increased investment in that stock at the expense of
all the other stocks in the index).
Chen,Noronha et al. (2006) found that the problem was greatest for funds that tracked indices
of small company shares since the index changes are usually large relative to the market
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

capitalisation of the index.They found the effect on the Russell 2000 index (a small-cap index) to
be around 1.5% p.a.Large capitalisation indices are less affected since the changes are small relative
to the total market capitalisation of the index.They found the effect on the S&P 500 (a large-cap
index) to be about 0.1% p.a.
It is to be noted that these negative effects are effects on the index;they do not reﬂect a failure
to accurately track the index.In fact if investors were to accept some imperfection in tracking the
worst of these effects could be avoided.By reconstituting an index tracker fund some time before,
or after,the index reconstitution date much of the detrimental effect on the fund could be avoided.
By accepting a little more tracking error the index tracker investors could enjoy a higher rate of
return. It might also be noted that there is a reduction in the ability of stock indices accurately to
measure aggregate stock market movements since a downward bias is imparted. In other words
the existence of index tracker funds leads to a situation in which stock indices underestimate
market rises over time.It is also a factor that should favour actively managed funds since such funds
should be able to avoid the detrimental effects.
One issue concerns the importance of the tracking error. If the objective of index tracking is
the avoidance of dramatic underperformance,a small tracking error is not necessarily important.
Since the reduction of tracking error is likely to involve increased costs of share trading, as the
portfolio is frequently and precisely rebalanced,imperfect tracking may be seen as worth tolerating.
However if the tracking error is not random, or appears to be increasing, the fund manager may
decide that some portfolio rebalancing is required.
PASSIVE CORE (CORE-SATELLITE) FUNDS
A hybrid strategy is known as the passive core (or core-satellite) approach. In this case the fund
manager manages part of the portfolio passively, and the remainder actively. If the passively
managed component seeks to track an index, the resulting portfolio might be seen as a closet
tracker.A passive core strategy that uses index tracking for the passive core of the portfolio allows
the fund manager to exercise judgement whilst ensuring that the performance of the portfolio does
not fall substantially below that of the index, and hence the average of funds.A variation on this
theme is the ‘enhanced’index fund,which is primarily an index tracker but with a tilt in a direction
that is seen as potentially providing outperformance.
STAGES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
The construction of a portfolio may involve one stage, two stages, three stages, or possibly even
more.The fund manager must decide on the number of stages and their nature.There is also a choice
between active and passive management at each stage (and if passive, which type of passive
management).
A one-stage process involves the portfolio manager seeking the optimum portfolio from the
entire range of securities available (or under consideration).This could be achieved by employing
the Markowitz equations or Sharpe’s single index model. Alternatively a stock index portfolio
might be used.In reality many fund managers would employ less formal procedures.If the optimum
portfolio is amended in the light of the manager’s market forecasts,or is affected by such forecasts,
the strategy would be an active one.The strategy would be an active one if the manager takes bets
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
341

on individual securities (or sectors or asset classes).A passive strategy would be uninﬂuenced by
any forecasts that the fund manager may make.
A two-stage process might involve the optimisation process being divided into separate stock
selection (and bond selection) and asset allocation stages.In the ﬁrst stage a stock portfolio is decided
upon, and simultaneously a bond portfolio is established.These two separate portfolios can be
derived using the types of approach indicated for the one-stage process (Markowitz diversiﬁcation,
index portfolios, etc.). In the second (asset allocation) stage the fund manager seeks an optimum
combination of the stock and bond portfolios.This could be based on Markowitz optimisation, or
a less formal procedure.The operation could additionally involve portfolios of investments in asset
classes other than stocks and bonds, for example real estate and money market instruments.The
fund manager has the choice between active and passive styles at each of the two stages.
A three-stage process might introduce a sector allocation (sector rotation) decision between
the stock selection and asset allocation stages. Stocks may be divided into sectors such as oils,
banks, insurance, pharmaceuticals, utilities, construction, retailers, and so on. Bonds may be
divided according to types of issuer, maturity, and credit rating.The fund manager might seek an
optimum portfolio for each sector or division. An optimum portfolio of the sector portfolios
would then constitute the stock portfolio.Likewise a portfolio of various bond portfolios (one for
each chosen category of bond) would be constructed.The stock and bond portfolios would then
be combined to form the portfolio of risky assets.The fund manager might then choose to combine
this with a holding of risk-free assets (such as deposits or Treasury bills).An active manager would
then deviate from such a base portfolio by increasing the proportion held in some assets, and
decreasing the weighting in others,according to the manager’s forecasts of relative performance.
If the fund manager includes foreign securities in the portfolio there would be more
stages. Separate portfolios might be created for each country.There would then be a portfolio of
country portfolios.
An approach that involves determining ﬁrst the asset allocation,then the sector allocation,and
ﬁnally the stock selection is referred to as a top-down strategy.An approach that seeks undervalued
investments,irrespective of sector or asset class,is known as bottom-up.In the top-down strategy,
a passive approach at the asset allocation and sector allocation stages may involve determining
percentage allocations for each asset or sector (perhaps allowing the fund manager a limited amount
of discretion to vary the percentages on the basis of market views, in which case the strategy is a
hybrid between passive and active).
As prices change the original percentages are disturbed.For example an increase in share prices
relative to bond prices raises the proportion of the portfolio in shares relative to the proportion
in bonds.The fund manager then faces a choice between two alternative passive strategies. One
strategy, a form of buy-and-hold, would be to accept the new proportions and not carry out any
buying and selling transactions.Another strategy would be to sell shares and buy bonds in order
to restore the original percentage allocations.
Country Diversiﬁcation versus Sector (Industry) Diversiﬁcation
If an investment manager faces a choice between diversiﬁcation across countries or diversiﬁcation
between industrial sectors, or needs to decide on the order of country and sector allocation in a
multi-stage process, the relative scope for diversiﬁcation beneﬁts could inﬂuence the choice.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
342

However the empirical evidence on relative diversiﬁcation beneﬁts does not give unambiguous
guidance.The consensus seems to be that in the past country diversiﬁcation has been the more
effective in portfolio risk reduction (improving the risk-return proﬁle) but that more recently
sector diversiﬁcation has improved its relative merits,particularly in relation to portfolios invested
in European markets.
Estrada et al. (2005) pointed out that there were differences in opinion such that some argue
that country diversiﬁcation is the more effective means of risk reduction,and should therefore be
the ﬁrst stage in the portfolio optimisation process, whereas others suggest that industry
diversiﬁcation is more effective and should take precedence. They compared country and
industry effects in Europe over the period 1989 to 2003 and found that they offered approximately
equal diversiﬁcation opportunities. The result held even when TMT (technology, media,
telecommunications) stocks were excluded.TMT stocks might be thought to have distorted the
results since their bubble and crash could have reduced the correlation of TMT with other industry
sectors.When the sample period was divided into two,1989–96 and 1997–2003,it was found that
in the earlier period country diversiﬁcation was the more effective whereas in the latter period
industry diversiﬁcation came to the fore.These results held even after the exclusion of TMT stocks.
Hauser and Vermeersch (2002) investigated the relative merits of country and industrial sector
diversiﬁcation based on international portfolios invested in developed capital markets (US,Japan,
UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Canada).Their sample period was 1980 to 2001.
Until 1994 country diversiﬁcation surpassed industrial sector diversiﬁcation, but by a decreasing
margin.In the post-1994 period the two diversiﬁcation effects were approximately equal.However
it should be borne in mind that the international diversiﬁcation of the study was limited to a group
of countries, which were homogeneous in the sense of having well-developed capital markets.
The apparent change in the relative effectiveness of country and industry diversiﬁcation may
be explained in terms of increasing correlation between countries and falling correlation between
industrial sectors.Barnes et al. (2001) found that,in the second half of the 1990s,industrial sector
correlations fell and cross-country correlations rose.The rise in cross-country correlations, and
decline in potential for country diversiﬁcation, was most marked in the European Union.
STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL ASSET ALLOCATION
A portfolio manager may determine a strategic asset allocation and allow some tactical asset
allocation.The strategic asset allocation may entail weighting asset classes at the levels applicable
in the absence of any views about short-term market movements.Table 16.1 illustrates such a
strategic asset allocation.
Tactical asset allocation would be allowed by stipulating ranges around the central percentages
of Table 16.1.Movements within the ranges would be made in the light of short-term expectations
of market movements.Table 16.2 illustrates possible ranges.
GOALS-BASED INVESTING
Goals-based investing is a structure for personal investment management that draws on both
traditional investment principles and behavioural ﬁnance (Nevins 2004). It has been suggested
that it is a useful framework for ﬁnancial advisers to use when dealing with clients.The central
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
343

behavioural ﬁnance principle involved is mental accounting.The proponents of mental accounting
suggest that many people do not see their wealth as forming a single portfolio.Instead ﬁnances are
divided into separate accounts; the separation may take the form of distinct, observably separate,
pools of assets or the separation may merely be in the mind of the investor. Each account has its
own portfolio and is related to its own speciﬁc goal. It is likely that each account has its own
investment horizon.
Nevins (2004) suggests measures of risk that differ from the conventional one of standard
deviation. He points out that prospect theory sees people as loss-averse rather than risk-averse;
that is people are primarily concerned with losses. Correspondingly risk should be measured in
terms of the likelihood and severity of loss. The conventional standard deviation measure is
concerned with a single time period and ignores price movements within the period and the
potential cumulative effect of losses in successive periods. Conventional measures of return and
risk are concerned with annualised measures whereas measurement that relates to the whole
investment horizon may be more appropriate.
If risks are measured in terms of the violation of investor goals,the prospective achievement of
goals could override attitudes to risk.A risk-tolerant investor need not hold a risky portfolio if a
low risk portfolio would meet a goal.Conversely if a conservative portfolio could not meet a goal,
a higher yielding risky portfolio must be accepted even by a highly loss-averse investor.For example
portfolios whose goal is the provision of a pension would normally need to hold risky assets.
Conventionally investment advice begins with ascertaining the client’s attitude to risk, using
verbal questioning and/or a questionnaire, in order to obtain a single measurement of risk-
aversion/tolerance.In the case of goals-based investing,several measurements of risk are required:
one for each mental account. Each measurement of risk would be related to a speciﬁc goal, and
would be measured against a reference value expressed in terms of the goal. For example when
saving for retirement the goal may be in terms of retirement income and risk would then be
measured in terms of deviations from the desired level of retirement income.

One problem is that verbal questioning requires very good communication with the client. If
clients have a poor understanding of risk, and are unclear about their own feelings towards risk,
the process of measuring their attitudes to risk can be difﬁcult.There is considerable scope for a
failure of communication (Callan and Johnson 2002).The alternative of using questionnaires is also
open to difﬁculties.There is the problem of whether a questionnaire accurately measures attitude
towards risk.Yook and Everett (2003) found that different questionnaires produced very different
results; so at least some of the questionnaires were inaccurate. Conﬁdence in the questionnaires
was also undermined by the observation that the relationships between questionnaire responses
and investment decisions appeared to be weak.
The approach of conventional portfolio management is to treat the investor’s portfolio as a
single entity, and to measure attitude to risk in relation to the whole portfolio.The behavioural
ﬁnance alternative is to allow for multiple investment strategies,each relating to a separate mental
account (Shefrin and Statman 2000;Brunel 2003).Each strategy is linked to the goal encompassed
by a mental account, on the basis that there would be a separate mental account for each goal.
Arguably mental accounting should be seen as a preference rather than as a bias, such that the
adviser should accommodate to the preference rather than treating it as an aberration that should
be eliminated.Mental accounting may be a useful technique for organising personal ﬁnances,and
for achieving self-control in ﬁnancial matters.
Goals-based investing may not be suitable for investors who do not have precise goals,but where
goals are clear to the investor it may be an appropriate approach.There are alternative ways of
describing goals. One approach is to link them to life-cycle factors such as saving for a deposit on
a home, saving for children’s education, and saving for a retirement pension. Shefrin and Statman
(2000) suggest that mental accounts might be differentiated in terms of risk;for example between
low risk funds that are intended to ensure that poverty is avoided through to funds that can be
risked in the hope of very large gains. Chhabra (2005) took the view that investors divide their
portfolios according to three types of risk:speciﬁcally a personal risk concerned with the avoidance
of loss, the market risk of conventional theory, and aspirational risk concerned with the prospect
of falling behind other people in terms of wealth.Correspondingly there may be a holding of risk-
free assets to satisfy safety risk,a balanced portfolio for the market risk,and an aggressive portfolio
aimed at high growth to satisfy aspirational risk.Chhabra suggests that risk allocation precedes asset
allocation.Brunel (2003) suggested that there are four fundamental goals:liquidity,income,capital
preservation,and growth.It could be the case that an individual separates mental accounts in terms
of their investment horizons;for example long-term,medium-term,and short-term pools of assets.
It may be that an investor would feel more comfortable with a goals-based investment strategy
than with a single-portfolio strategy. One problem in the ﬁnancial services industry has been the
tendency for many people to terminate savings plans early (such as pension plans and endowment
policies).If goals-based investing makes them feel more comfortable with their savings plans,they
may be more likely to persist with them. For an asset allocation to be useful, the investor must
adhere to it even in falling markets.Feelings of regret may cause an investor to abandon a strategy
in adverse conditions. Brunel refers to this as ‘decision risk’.
The goals-based investing proposed by Brunel would entail a separate sub-portfolio to meet each
of the four fundamental goals.For example,liquidity may be achieved with a bank deposit;income
by a mixture of value stocks and corporate bonds;capital preservation by government bonds;and
growth by a portfolio of value and growth stocks.The proportions of the four sub-portfolios in
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
345

the total portfolio would reﬂect the goals and risk attitude of the investor. Brunel’s argument
implies that a portfolio comprising such a set of sub-portfolios could be more resilient and robust
to decision risk in the face of adverse developments.The investor might remain more committed
to it than to a traditional portfolio, which does not have goals-based sub-portfolios.
A problem with goals-based investing is its complexity. From the perspective of a ﬁnancial
adviser, several measures of risk may need to be made and several investment strategies devised
and implemented. The task could be simpliﬁed by the creation of a variety of institutional
investment products suited to different goals (see Part 3 on mutual funds,pensions,and assurance-
related investments).Structured products can be created to meet investment goals that cannot be
otherwise achieved (see Chapter 34 on structured products and the other chapters in Parts 8 and
9 on futures and options).The adviser can then customise an investment portfolio for an individual
by choosing the institutional investments that best match the investment goals of the individual.
VALUE STOCKS AND GROWTH STOCKS
There is a widespread belief that there are groups of shares that have common features in terms of
characteristics and behaviour.The most favoured grouping appears to be between value stocks and
growth stocks.Value stocks are shares that appear to be relatively underpriced in terms of criteria
such as price-earnings ratios, price-to-book ratios, and the fair prices determined by dividend
discount models (see Chapters 19 and 21 on dividend discount models and on ratio analysis,
respectively).Value stocks tend to have relatively high dividend yields.Growth stocks are identiﬁed
by an expectation of rapid growth in earnings (company proﬁts) and hence in share price.
Probably the most frequently used measure, to classify shares into the value and growth
categories, is the price-to-book ratio.The book value of a ﬁrm is its net value (assets minus
liabilities) as shown on its balance sheet. Division of this book value by the number of shares in
issue gives the book value per share.The price-to-book ratio is the share price divided by the book
value per share. (The price-to-book ratio is alternatively known as the market-to-book ratio.)
Stocks of companies with a low price-to-book ratio are generally classiﬁed as value stocks,
whereas a high ratio indicates a growth stock.The total number of stocks under consideration is
referred to as the universe of stocks. Sometimes this universe of stocks is divided into value
and growth stocks such that half the total market capitalisation is classiﬁed as value and the other
half as growth.Allocating the whole universe in this way creates style jitter.Style jitter is the term
given to the tendency for stocks to move from one category to the other.An alternative procedure,
that reduces style jitter, is to divide the universe of stocks three ways. One-third of the market
capitalisation is seen as consisting of value stocks, one-third as growth, and one-third as not
readily classiﬁable as either.
Style investing involves the concentration of a portfolio on either value or growth stocks.
Passive style investing keeps the portfolio to one of the two styles (or keeps the emphasis on one).
Active style investment entails switching between styles in the light of forecasts of the relative
performance of the two styles.Active style investment might take the form of moving the whole
portfolio from one style to the other, or of changing the relative emphasis from one to the other.
Often the value-growth classiﬁcation is further reﬁned by allocating stocks along other
dimensions.A popular additional dimension is the size of ﬁrms as measured by market capitalisation.
The simplest of these divides companies into large and small,so that half of the market capitalisation
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
346

falls into each of the two groups.The addition of this reﬁnement produces four styles:large value,
small value, large growth, small growth.
Lakonishok et al. (1994) deﬁned growth stocks as the shares of ﬁrms with high growth rates,
and value stocks as those of ﬁrms with low growth rates. Investigating US stocks over the period
1963 to 1990,they found that over ﬁve-year periods growth stocks averaged a total return of 81.8%
whereas the return from value stocks averaged 143.4%.(The growth stocks were shares of the top
10% of companies in terms of growth, and value stocks were from the bottom 10% of ﬁrms.)
Ahmed and Nanda (2001) expressed the view that investors are best served by combining
value and growth features when selecting shares.They deﬁned value stocks as those with low
price-earnings ratios,and growth stocks as those with relatively high growth rates of earnings per
share. High returns were available from both the lowest (bottom quintile) of stocks in terms of
price-earnings ratios and the highest (top quintile) of stocks in terms of the growth rate of earnings
per share.They found that the best performance was obtained from portfolios containing shares
that were in the highest categories (quintiles) in terms of both the value and the growth
characteristics; that is shares that had both the lowest price-earnings ratios and the highest
growth rates of earnings per share.A conclusion was that value and growth investment styles are
not mutually exclusive.
IMPLICATIONS OF STYLE INVESTING
Barberis and Shleifer (2001) developed a model of style investing.According to this model investor
behaviour is driven by relative returns.The model makes two key assumptions.First,money moves
towards styles that have done relatively well in the past. Second, these ﬂows of money affect the
relative prices of the investments.A style could be any categorisation that investors judge to be
relevant, e.g. value/growth, passive/active, large company/small company.
Investors do seem to be attracted to styles that have performed well in the recent past. Sirri
andTufano (1998) found that retail investors (i.e.private individuals) appear to base their unit trust
choices on prior performance.This was supported by Odean (2001) who found that nearly half of
new investment went into the top 10% of funds, ranked in terms of recent performance.
According to the Barberis and Shleifer (2001) model, the prices of favoured styles are driven
up to levels that are probably not warranted by the fundamental merits of the investments.Funds
ﬂow from styles that are out of favour to those in favour.The model divides investors into two
groups: fundamentalists and switchers.The fundamentalists look at the underlying quality of
investments, whereas switchers chase the market by buying into the style that has recently
performed well (the switchers might be described as momentum or positive feedback traders).
The switchers may be inﬂuenced by the representativeness bias (a behavioural ﬁnance psychological
bias) and see an investment with recent good results as representative of investments with good
long-term returns.There may also be agency factors, for example the trustees of a pension fund
may choose a style that has performed well recently on the grounds that it is easier to justify such
a choice when they have to account for their decision.
An investment style can go through a life cycle.The style arises as the result of good fundamental
factors, which attract those investors who focus on fundamental factors.The investment by the
fundamentalists causes prices to rise and the rising prices attract switchers.Switchers then invest
and thereby push prices up further.When the fundamental value of the investments covered by
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
347

the style turns downward,the process is reversed.The success of a style may arise because of good
fundamentals relating to its investments, or to bad fundamentals relating to the opposite style.
Style investing could produce co-movement of returns, even when the investments are
otherwise unrelated.The returns from an investment may be inﬂuenced by the success of a style
with which it is associated.In consequence a factor other than general market risk (systematic risk)
will inﬂuence returns.It can also produce some apparent anomalies.For example Royal Dutch and
Shell are the same company, so they should trade at the same price. Froot and Dabora (1999)
found that Royal Dutch moves with the US market whilst Shell moves with the UK market.Royal
Dutch is a constituent of the US S&P 500 index and hence is a constituent of the S&P 500 style.
Shell is a constituent of the UK FTSE 100 and hence is subject to the behaviour of investors for
whom the FTSE 100 is a style (e.g. FTSE 100 index trackers and funds for which the FTSE 100 is
the benchmark).
STYLE ROTATION
The principles of behavioural ﬁnance have been used to produce models that suggest rotation
between momentum and contrarian styles of investing.The momentum style entails positive
feedback trading:rising share prices lead to purchases and falling prices are seen as a signal to sell.
The contrarian style involves selling after rises and buying after falls;it is based on the premise that
markets will reverse direction. Swaminathan and Lee (2000) produced a diagrammatic
representation of style rotation.This is shown in Figure 16.1.
In Figure 16.1,glamour stocks have high price-to-book ratios,high trading volumes,and a long
history of earnings being better than expected.Value stocks have low price-to-book ratios, low
trading volumes, and long-term negative earnings surprises.
Swaminathan and Lee (2000) refer to the process shown in Figure 16.1 as the momentum life
cycle.According to the momentum life-cycle hypothesis, stocks are subject to bouts of under-

reaction and overreaction, and of popularity and neglect. A stock that experiences good news
moves up the left-hand side.When the stock begins to disappoint investors in terms of earnings,
it will begin to decline – initially slowly but subsequently more rapidly.As the stock moves down
the right-hand side, the pace of price fall increases. Eventually the rate of price decline becomes
subject to overreaction as investors extrapolate recent price movements too far into the future.
The momentum life cycle suggests that early stage winners and losers exhibit return
continuation so that momentum trading should be proﬁtable.An investor should buy recent risers
and sell recent fallers. Late stage winners and losers tend to exhibit reversals, so contrarian
strategies should be proﬁtable.An investor should buy recent fallers and sell recent risers.
Behavioural ﬁnance has been criticised for predicting both momentum and contrarian effects.
Style rotation models have been developed to reconcile these opposing predictions.Barberis et al.
(1998) base initial under-reaction and subsequent overreaction on conservatism, anchoring, and
representativeness.Following a long history of good news about earnings and share price rises,bad
news items are initially given little weight.This is the effect of conservatism and anchoring affecting
the thinking of investors.A consequence is that there is little price decline in the face of bad news.
There is under-reaction to the bad news.This is the situation in the top right-hand quadrant of Figure
16.1.The opposite situation occurs in the bottom left-hand quadrant for the same reasons.The
psychological biases of conservatism and anchoring cause under-reaction to a change in news.
The top left and bottom right quadrants reﬂect the effects of representativeness on the thinking
of investors.Stocks with good recent histories are seen as being representative of long-term strong
performers.This leads investors to extrapolate the past into the future and to become over-
optimistic about the potential success of the respective stocks. Conversely poor recent histories
can lead to excessive pessimism.These stages exhibit overreaction on the part of investors.
Daniel et al. (1999) used the overconﬁdence and conﬁrmation biases of behavioural ﬁnance.In
their model,an investor estimates the value of an investment and also assesses the precision of the
estimate. Conﬁrmation bias causes the investor to overweight information consistent with the
estimate and underweight information that contradicts the view taken.In consequence,conﬁdence
in the accuracy of the estimate increases.The increased conﬁdence then leads to overreaction.
PASSIVE STRATEGIES, ACTIVE STRATEGIES,
AND PARRONDO’S PARADOX
There is considerable evidence that active trading can reduce investment returns (e.g.Barber and
Odean 2000; and Odean 1999). It has been supposed that this is because of the transaction costs
incurred by active investors.Although transaction costs are part of the explanation, they may not
be the whole explanation. Parrondo’s paradox may contribute to the explanation (Spurgin and
Tamarkin 2005).Parrondo’s paradox was ﬁrst discovered in physics,but seems to have applicability
in many other disciplines (Spurgin and Tamarkin illustrate its applicability to investments).The
operation of the paradox can be illustrated by a coin-tossing game (this illustration is based on
Harmer and Abbott 1999).
In game A the player tosses a biased coin and bets on each throw.The player is aware of the bias
and therefore expects a positive outcome over time. In game B the player tosses one of two coins
and bets on each throw; one coin is biased and the other unbiased. Coin 1 is tossed if the player
holds a sum of money which is a multiple of three (the number three has no particular signiﬁcance,
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
349

any number could be used), otherwise coin 2 is tossed. Since the player knows the bias of coin 1,
the game has a prospective positive return over time.
Either game played alone is expected to yield a positive return, but alternating between
the games (either randomly or in a pattern) generates losses.This is an illustration of the paradox.
The reason for the paradox remains a mystery but there are numerous examples of its operation
in many different applications.The operation of the paradox depends upon there being some
connection between the two games (the role of the number three links the wealth from game
A to the playing of game B). It is believed that the explanation lies in a ratchet effect whereby
losses are not easily reversed.
The implication for investment strategy is that switching between proﬁtable investments could
result in losses. For example remaining invested in value stocks prospectively yields a positive
return, and remaining invested in growth stocks also has an expectation of positive return, but a
strategy of switching between the two investment styles could yield negative returns.The reason
for Parrondo’s paradox is not yet understood, but its existence strengthens the case for passive
portfolio strategies.
HEDGE FUNDS
Although hedge funds have existed since 1949,it is only since the mid-1980s that they have achieved
a signiﬁcant role amongst investment vehicles.Hedge funds are typically private partnerships with
the management team being general partners, and accepting unlimited liability for losses, and
other investors being limited partners (with liability limited to the sums invested).The partnership
structure tends to dictate that there should be a small number of partners, and hence that each
partner should contribute a large amount of capital.
There is no generally accepted deﬁnition of hedge funds. However a typical characteristic is
that they attempt to proﬁt in all market conditions: rising, falling, and stable. Hedge funds are
often absolute return investments, which seek positive returns irrespective of the direction
of markets; in contrast to mutual funds whose returns tend to move in the same direction as
markets as a result of their holding only long positions.The performance of hedge funds may
therefore be linked more closely to the investment skills of the managers than to market
performance.An investor in a hedge fund could be seen as investing in the investment skills of the
fund managers.
Hedge funds are characterised by their ﬂexibility of investment style and strategy.Hedge fund
managers have the ﬂexibility to make substantial changes to security selection,asset allocation,and
trading strategy.They often use short selling,leverage,and derivatives.Although early hedge funds
were hedged in the sense that they held offsetting long and short positions,nowadays many hedge
funds do not follow such a strategy.Arguably the term ‘hedge fund’is a misnomer for those funds
that do not adopt the style of offsetting long and short positions.
By short selling is meant the practice of borrowing shares and selling the borrowed shares.This
means that stock is owed and needs to be returned to the lender in the future.Such a short position
in stock beneﬁts from a falling price.If stock prices fall it costs less to buy the shares for the purpose
of returning them to the lender.A fund that has a long position in (that is owns) some stocks and
a short position in others is hedged against general market movements.The fund manager short
sells overpriced stocks and buys underpriced stocks, with a view to proﬁting when the prices
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

move to their appropriate values, whilst being immune from movements in the stock market as a
whole.To the extent that it is possible to identify mispriced shares, hedge funds that employ
such a long-short equity strategy are able to proﬁt from both under and overpricing whereas
conventional (long only) funds are limited to making proﬁts from underpriced shares.Hedge funds
that seek complete offsetting of long and short positions take no net position on the stock market;
such funds are said to follow absolute return strategies.
This is risk arbitrage rather than pure arbitrage.The fund is exposed to the speciﬁc (non-
systematic) risks of the individual securities that arise from ﬁrm- or sector-speciﬁc events. In the
case of shares there is the risk that the fund manager has not correctly discerned which are
overpriced and which are underpriced.There is no certainty as to how long it will take for relative
mispricing between shares to be corrected. It is also unlikely that exposure to overall market
movements is completely avoided (particularly since stock betas cannot be precisely ascertained
and are liable to change).
Sometimes a hedge fund will be hedged in one dimension whilst being speculative in another.
For example during the period 2004–5 some hedge funds used Collateralised Debt Obligations
(CDOs).A CDO is a portfolio of bonds divided into tranches according to default risk such that
the buyers of the tranche with the highest default risk are the ﬁrst to lose money in the event of a
bond defaulting.Those who buy the riskiest tranche suffer immediately if one of the bonds defaults.
Some hedge funds took a long position in the more risky tranches and short sold less risky tranches.
There was a gain in that the yields on the more risky tranches were higher than those on the less
risky with the effect that income receipts exceeded payments. As far as interest rate risk is
concerned this position is largely hedged.An unexpected rise in interest rates would cause losses
in the long position but offsetting proﬁts in the short position;an unexpected fall in interest rates
causes losses in the short position offset by proﬁts in the long position (recall that there is an inverse
relationship between interest rates and bond prices). However as far as default risk is concerned
the hedge funds are being speculative.They are betting that the yield difference between the
tranches is more than is required to compensate for the difference in default risk. In the event of
an unexpectedly high level of defaults,or credit rating downgrades,the hedge funds stood to lose
(and in many cases did lose).
The process of short selling entails additional risk in that the borrower of stock must pay a
deposit, known as margin, and more must be paid if the stock price rises. It is possible that the
mispricing worsens before it improves, in particular the price of the short sold stock could rise
before it falls.There could come a point where the fund is unable to meet the calls for additional
margin payments and is forced to close out the short position by buying shares at a high price,which
would result in losses.
Other characteristics of hedge funds are that they are largely exempt from regulation,typically
prevent investors from withdrawing their money early, and levy fees that are related to fund
performance. The avoidance of regulatory control over investment strategy is achieved by
organising funds as limited partnerships.Although this provides ﬂexibility of investment strategy,
it reduces the liquidity of hedge fund investments. Investors may lose access to their funds for
several years;hence investments in hedge funds may be very illiquid.A small number of hedge funds
are listed on stock exchanges.This improves their liquidity but subjects them to a greater degree
of scrutiny. Many hedge fund managers desire not only ﬂexibility and independence with respect
to their investment strategies, but also secrecy.
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
351

The ﬂexibility allows hedge funds to borrow heavily. An implication of this leverage is
that proﬁts and losses for investors are magniﬁed. If a £100 million investment is ﬁnanced by
£20 million from investors and by borrowing £80 million, and if the fund grows to £120 million,
the investors would make a proﬁt of 100% on their investment (£120 million minus £80 million
debt repayment leaves £40 million – ignoring interest payments). If the investment falls to £80
million, the debt can be repaid but the investors are left with nothing. Hedge funds often borrow
several times the sums provided by investors.This high leverage substantially increases the risks of
investing in hedge funds.
One attraction of hedge funds to other fund managers is that their returns show low correlations
with the returns on other investments, such as shares and bonds. So the inclusion of hedge fund
investments in a portfolio is useful for the purpose of reducing portfolio risk by diversiﬁcation.
This arises from the wide variety of investments and strategies available to hedge fund managers.
A downside of the ﬂexibility is that such a high degree of discretion by hedge fund managers means
that there is a considerable risk of mistakes on the part of managers.In other words there is a high
level of management risk.This is not helped by the high degree of secrecy employed by many
hedge fund managers concerning their investments and strategies. Hedge funds are often small,
and reliant on just one or two fund managers.Hitherto they have shown a high failure rate,although
there is disagreement about the size of failure rates with Roberts (2004) suggesting that around
20% of funds fail each year whereas Baquero et al. (2005) found an annual failure rate of 8.6%
between 1994 and 2000.
Managers of hedge funds are often rewarded in relation to performance in addition to receiving
a ﬁxed proportion of the fund value each year.This aligns the interests of managers and investors.
This alignment of interests is often reinforced by the hedge fund managers having substantial
personal investments in the fund. However there are disadvantages for the investors.Whilst the
managers receive large performance-related rewards in the good years,at the expense of investors,
there are no cash ﬂows from the managers to the investors in bad years. Second, this reward
structure may encourage the managers to take excessive risks.Since managers receive a proportion
of proﬁts but do not make payments in the event of losses, the incentive is to take high risks.The
managers gain if the risks pay off,but they do not lose if the risks result in losses.Third,a succession
of poor performances may cause the managers to abandon the funds.This may explain why such
a high proportion of hedge funds terminate.
Hedge funds can be categorised according to their investment strategy. A broad division is
between directional and non-directional funds. Directional funds take a position on the direction
of movement of a market;the market could be a stock market,a bond market,a currency market,
or a commodity market.Non-directional funds aim to make arbitrage proﬁts.The arbitrage proﬁts
would be sought from buying underpriced assets and taking short positions in (short selling)
overpriced assets.The long and short positions tend to hedge each other,thus removing exposure
to general market movements.
Hedge funds following directional strategies can be divided into a number of categories
according to the type of strategy.Those that follow macro strategies seek to make proﬁts from
economic changes at the country or regional level. Some funds take the strategy of focusing on
emerging markets, such as those of countries with new or small stock markets.Another strategy
is to take long positions in equities, that is buying shares. Other hedge funds concentrate on the
opposite strategy, that is short selling securities, which they consider to be overpriced.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
352

Hedge funds pursuing non-directional strategies can also be divided into more speciﬁc
categories.There are funds that use ﬁxed-income arbitrage,which entails long and short positions
in bonds.Event-driven hedge funds seek to take positions in stocks so as to proﬁt from events such
as mergers,takeovers,or restructuring.Equity hedge is an investment style that uses long and short
positions in equities,buying underpriced and short selling overpriced shares.Distressed securities
hedge funds focus on companies that are in ﬁnancial difﬁculties. Hedge funds that specialise in
convertible arbitrage buy and sell securities of the same company thereby proﬁting from relative
mispricing, for example between convertible bonds on the one hand and combinations of shares
and non-convertible bonds on the other.
Non-directional strategies may be at the macro level, for example long in European
equities and short in US equities to take advantage of an expected relative outperformance in
Europe. It does not matter if there are global market movements, since the combination of
long and short positions hedges the fund against stock market movements that are common to
Europe and the United States.What matters to the fund is the relative performance in Europe
and the United States. It is likely that such a fund uses stock index futures (see Part 8 on stock
index futures). Stock index futures proﬁt (or lose) from movements in stock indices without the
need to directly invest in shares. Not only does the use of futures avoid the costs of selecting
and trading individual stocks, but also it can remove the risk of adverse movements in exchange
rates between the US dollar and European currencies.The only initial cash ﬂow when acquiring a
futures position is the provision of a (returnable) deposit, which represents a small percentage of
the value of the underlying stocks (e.g. 5% of the value of the shares covered by the futures
contracts).The use of stock index futures thus provides a means of achieving leverage, since the
value of shares covered by the futures is far greater than the value of the deposit (a 5% deposit means
that exposure to a £1-million’s worth of shares is obtained from a cash outlay of just £50,000;
a twenty-fold leverage).
Merger arbitrage hedge funds may buy the securities of a company that is being acquired and
short sell the securities of the acquiring company. Alternatively they may seek to proﬁt from
superior assessments of the likelihood of success of takeover bids. For example suppose that £3 is
bid for the shares of the target company whereas the share price was previously £2. If the share
price rises to £2.60, the market is taking the view that the takeover bid has a 60% probability of
success [(2.60  2)/(3 2)  0.6,i.e.60%].A hedge fund manager who believes that success is
more than 60% probable would buy the shares, whereas a view that the probability of success is
less than 60% would lead to short selling.
Shleifer and Vishny (1997) pointed out that there is a principal-agent (asymmetric information)
problem in the operation of hedge funds.Those who invest in hedge funds are often ignorant of
the strategies and markets used by the hedge fund managers. Being ignorant of the investment
processes,the investors are likely to judge hedge funds on their past performance.The behavioural
ﬁnance principles of retrievability and narrow framing suggest that the investors would tend to
focus on recent performance.
An implication of these features is that funding could be at its weakest just when arbitrage
opportunities are at their strongest.When prices and fundamental values show greatest divergence,
the potential proﬁts from arbitrage are at their highest.The fund managers know this, but the
investors do not. It is possible that the wide discrepancy between actual and fundamental prices
has resulted from a recent widening of the difference between them. Such a widening is likely to
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
353

have caused losses on a fund that is using an arbitrage strategy.The investors have seen losses in the
recent past and are reluctant to invest more money, and may even be inclined to withdraw funds.
Dunbar (2000) tells of the difﬁculty that Long-Term Capital Management faced when it tried to
raise more capital following losses. Hedge fund managers face the possibility of involuntary
liquidation of positions because of the withdrawal of funds.That involuntary liquidation could
occur when the arbitrage positions are making losses.Long-Term Capital Management experienced
increased divergence in its arbitrage positions, and hence losses, following the default on Russian
bonds in 1998.
Many hedge funds have lock-up periods during which investors cannot withdraw their funds.
Such lock-up periods can be as much as ﬁve years. Investments in such hedge funds are
illiquid.Most individuals who invest in the hedge fund sector do so through a fund of funds.A fund
of funds invests in a portfolio of hedge funds.A disadvantage to the individual investor is that there
are two sets of charges.The hedge fund managers make charges, and so does the manager of the
fund of funds.There are advantages from investing through a fund of funds. First they provide
risk reduction by diversiﬁcation. Since hedge funds vary considerably in their strategies,
correlations can be expected to be low and hence the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation are likely to be high.
Another advantage is that funds of funds are typically much more liquid than the hedge funds.
An investor can sell holdings in a fund of funds immediately, or in a relatively short period of
time.The manager of the fund of funds bears the liquidity risk. If large numbers of individual
investors redeem their fund of funds holdings, the fund of funds managers can have problems.
They have to return money to investors but may be unable to turn their holdings of hedge funds
into cash.The charges made by the managers of funds of funds may in part be seen as compensation
for accepting liquidity risk.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that by the end of 2004 there were
9,000 hedge funds managing a total of $1,000 billion. HedgeFund Intelligence estimated
that by early 2006 a total of more than $1,500 billion was being managed by hedge funds.The
investors in hedge funds are very wealthy individuals and institutional investors such as
pension funds and insurance companies. Most individuals are limited to investing through
funds of funds operated by institutions since minimum sums for direct investment in hedge
funds are very high.An individual hedge fund may manage a sum in the region of $100 million
to $1,000 million but a hedge fund company may manage many funds, sometimes more than
a hundred.
At the time of writing (2006) there are moves to introduce some regulation of hedge funds.
This is partly driven by anxiety about the high degrees of leverage among funds.If a large number
of funds default on their debts to banks,the international banking system may be unable to absorb
the losses.Also hedge funds have the potential to distort markets,for example it has been estimated
that 20% of the oil price increase during 2005 was the result of purchases by hedge funds.The
impact of hedge funds on markets is not necessarily negative. It has been argued that they beneﬁt
markets by adding depth and liquidity; the fact that hedge funds trade securities such as shares,
bonds,and derivatives makes it easier for others to ﬁnd counterparties with whom to trade.They
may also help to move assets to their correct prices. For example buying underpriced shares and
simultaneously selling overpriced shares would tend to move both towards their correct prices.
A situation in which securities trade at their correct prices is referred to as informational efﬁciency
(see Part 7 on market efﬁciency).

Hedge Fund Performance
The question of whether hedge funds are good investments remains unresolved.They often claim
to offer double-digit rates of return irrespective of whether stock markets are rising or falling.
However there is considerable evidence that conventional funds, on average, fail to outperform
stock markets (see Chapters 9,11,and 17 on mutual funds,pensions,and portfolio performance
evaluation, respectively, and Part 7 on market efﬁciency). If conventional fund managers cannot
consistently pick successful shares or time changes in the direction of markets, why should we
expect better from hedge fund managers? Even if the ﬁrst few hedge funds could ﬁnd proﬁtable
opportunities,the massive increase in their numbers and size must raise doubts about whether there
are enough proﬁtable opportunities for them all to succeed.Their potential is undermined by their
tendency to incur high trading costs;it has been estimated that they trade about eight times as much
as conventional funds.This entails enormous transaction costs such as brokerage commissions,
bid-offer spreads,and taxes.At the time of writing (November 2006) the FTSE Hedge Fund Index
had shown a return of 4.5% over the previous twelve months whereas the FTSE All-Share Index
had shown a return in excess of 18%.This is a very crude comparison, but more sophisticated
research has suggested that hedge fund returns are far from exciting (Kat and Amin 2001;Kat and
Palaro 2006).It appears that hedge funds could be useful for portfolio diversiﬁcation,although not
through funds of funds because of the second layer of charges. Even the portfolio diversiﬁcation
beneﬁts of hedge funds have to be qualiﬁed.Whereas they may reduce portfolio risk when risk is
measured solely in terms of standard deviation,they may increase risk when kurtosis is considered
(Kat 2003). Kurtosis measures the likelihood of extreme falls in value.
The evaluation of hedge fund performance is difﬁcult for a number of reasons. One of those
reasons is that data on hedge funds is far from perfect, in particular data is frequently provided by
the fund managers without any independent veriﬁcation.Amenc et al. (2004) reported that more
than 40% of hedge funds covered by two major databases were not effectively audited, which
reduced the reliability of the reported data.Another reason for the difﬁculty of evaluating hedge
fund performance is survivorship bias. If the analysis of returns considers only those hedge funds
that survive for the whole period being examined,the performance ﬁgures would be enhanced by
the absence of the hedge funds that failed during the period.Although this is a problem with all
fund performance measurement, it is a particular problem for the measurement of hedge fund
performance since hedge funds have a high failure rate. In other words hedge funds, on average,
have short lives.
Gregoriou (2002) carried out a survival analysis of hedge funds. Survival analysis estimates
the probable life of an entity and seeks to ascertain what factors affect the length of its life.
Gregoriou found that the median life of a hedge fund was 5.5 years (based on data from the period
1990 to 2001). It was also found that factors associated with relatively long life were large size,
high returns, low leverage, and low minimum purchase requirements. It appeared that poor
performance was the main reason for funds becoming defunct and that the early years were the
most dangerous for funds.Funds of hedge funds had a median survival time of 7.5 years.Baquero
et al.(2005) also found that mature,large hedge funds with high returns were less likely to liquidate.
Amin and Kat (2003) found that the attrition rate of hedge funds was lower for the larger and
better performing funds but, contrary to other studies, found that newer funds suffered less
attrition than older funds.
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
355

Publicised ﬁgures for hedge fund returns often suggest that their average annual rates of return
are much higher than those available on other types of fund. However performance may be
exaggerated by survivorship bias.The exclusion of the poorer performing hedge funds,which are
discontinued because of the poor performance, from calculations of average rates of return leads
to an overstatement of average hedge fund returns (i.e.a survivorship bias).Baquero et al. (2005)
concluded that survivorship bias accounted for 2.11 percentage points of the average annual return
on hedge funds.Amin and Kat (2003) estimated that the survivorship bias was about 2 percentage
points per annum on average,and also concluded that survivorship bias caused an understatement
of risk.Taking dead funds into account leads to higher measures of risk as well as lower measures
of return. Amin and Kat found results for funds of hedge funds that were similar to those for
individual hedge funds,but more modest;for example their estimated survivorship bias for funds
of hedge funds was 0.63% p.a.Research by Fung et al. (2004) indicated that,when allowance was
made for survivorship bias, hedge fund returns showed no outperformance on average. In other
words they found no evidence of investment management skill.Amin and Kat (2003a) took the
view that,on average,hedge fund returns fell between the averages for shares and bonds (i.e.less
than shares but more than bonds).
Evaluation of investments requires attention to risk as well as return.Amin and and Kat (2003a)
observed that the risk of hedge funds, as measured by their standard deviations, fell between
the risks of shares and bonds.They also pointed out that, since the returns on hedge funds are not
highly correlated with the returns on shares and bonds, hedge funds appear to offer good risk
reduction through diversiﬁcation. However standard deviation alone is not an adequate measure
of risk when considering hedge funds. In particular kurtosis and skewness are important as
additional measures of risk.
Hedge funds appear to be subject to greater kurtosis than other investments,which means that
extreme returns are more likely. If the high kurtosis is accompanied by negative skewness, the
probability of very large losses is enhanced.Amin and Kat (2003,2003a) show that the introduction
of hedge funds into a portfolio will increase the kurtosis and distort the skewness of the portfolio.
So although the diversiﬁcation effect of hedge funds may reduce risk as measured by standard
deviation, the introduction of hedge funds into a portfolio would increase risk as measured by
kurtosis and skewness.
Even the reduction of standard deviation may be limited, dependent upon the hedge fund
strategy.Amenc et al. (2003) measured the correlations of hedge fund returns with stock returns
during declining stock markets.Some,such as convertible arbitrage and event-driven hedge funds,
were found to have rising correlations with stocks.So an investment manager seeking to diversify
with hedge funds should be selective about which hedge fund strategies are appropriate. In the
extreme, hedge funds that use a short-selling strategy may be unlikely to improve risk-return
trade-offs since their risk-reduction effects would be at the cost of lower expected portfolio
returns. Stock market rises would be offset by losses on the hedge funds.
Kat (2005) found that forming portfolios of hedge funds, known as funds of hedge
funds, reduces standard deviation but worsens skewness and kurtosis. Furthermore it was found
that correlations with portfolios of shares increased when hedge funds were combined into
portfolios; so the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts were reduced. Using funds of hedge funds, rather than
individual hedge funds, as an addition to other portfolios reduces risk to the extent that the
fund of hedge funds has a lower standard deviation than individual hedge funds. However it
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
356

entails higher risk by way of skewness, kurtosis, and higher correlation with other components
of the total portfolio.
Lhabitant and Learned (2002) also found that whilst reducing some measures of risk,
the combination of hedge funds into funds of hedge funds worsened skewness and kurtosis.
They found that between ﬁve and ten funds was enough to achieve the risk-reduction
beneﬁts whereas increasing the number of funds further worsened skewness and kurtosis.
Additionally, increasing the number of hedge funds raises the correlation of the hedge fund
portfolio with portfolios of shares, thereby reducing the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts. Too much
diversiﬁcation in the hedge fund portfolio reduces that portfolio’s value as a diversiﬁer of the
total fund.
Amenc et al. (2004) examined the extent to which managers of funds of hedge funds in
Europe took account of the peculiar risk and diversiﬁcation characteristics of hedge funds.They
found that funds of hedge funds tended to contain an excessive number of funds.This ignores
research ﬁndings on the relationship between the number of hedge funds in the portfolio and the
effects on the portfolio into which the fund of hedge funds is placed. Many managers of funds of
hedge funds fail to consider the adverse effects of kurtosis, skewness, and correlation with other
portfolio assets.
Investors may consider high liquidity, as well as high return and low risk, to be a desirable
characteristic of investments. Hedge funds perform poorly in this regard since they tend to be
illiquid.
Long-Term Capital Management
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) is one of the most famous hedge funds.One reason for
its fame is the eminence of its founders who included Nobel Prize winning ﬁnance professors and
star traders. In the ﬁrst three years the fund generated very high returns and by 1998 the value of
the fund was about $125 billion (of which about $120 billion was ﬁnanced by borrowing; so the
fund was highly geared).
The strategy of the fund was to pursue arbitrage opportunities.When similar assets traded at
different prices the more expensive one would be sold short,and the cheaper one would be bought.
The strategy depended on the prices of the two assets converging within a time scale over which
the fund could afford to maintain the trading position.Another feature of the fund strategy was its
high degree of diversiﬁcation.The positions that were taken covered a wide range of uncorrelated
markets.
An example of an early success was the purchase of $2 billion of 29.5-year US Treasury
bonds and the simultaneous short sale of $2 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds on the grounds
that the spread between the prices was incorrect. Since two similar bonds were held, the
position was hedged against general market movements.The fund made a $25 million proﬁt
on this position very quickly (Levy and Post 2005). When a trading position aims to proﬁt
from a narrowing of a wide difference between two values it is often referred to as a ‘convergence
trade’.
In 1998 LTCM bought a large quantity of Russian bonds and simultaneously short sold a large
quantity of USTreasury bonds.LTCM took the view that Russian bond prices were too low relative
to US Treasury bonds and that the difference between the prices should reduce. Russian bond
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
357

prices were expected to rise relative to US Treasury bond prices. However the spread widened
rather than narrowing.
In August 1998 the Russian government defaulted on its bonds.This led to panic in the markets
and a ‘ﬂight to quality’as investors tried to sell risky bonds and buy safer ones.Russian bond prices
fell relative to US Treasury bond prices. Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) tried to sell
some of its bonds but found that it was difﬁcult to do so.There were two major reasons for the
difﬁculty encountered.
First, there was a sharp decline in market liquidity. Buyers were few and the bonds could not
be sold without substantial price reductions.Banking regulations compounded this problem.One
way in which banks make money is by providing liquidity.When other investors want to sell assets
the banks may buy.The buying price gives the banks a proﬁt margin,and the other investors forego
this margin in order to be able to sell.In other words the banks make money by providing liquidity.
So in August 1998 banks should have bought the bonds that other investors wanted to sell.However
banking regulations required banks to increase their capital reserves when market volatility
increased.In order to increase their capital the banks sold assets.Rather than being buyers the banks
were sellers.Instead of providing liquidity the banks required liquidity.Instead of stabilising markets
the banks added to the market instability.
Second, the assets held by the fund had become highly correlated (Stulz 2001). In theory the
well-diversiﬁed investments should have had low correlations. However Long-Term Capital
Management became a victim of herd behaviour. Observing its success, and the calibre of its
management, other investors were copying its trades.The assets held by the fund had become
correlated because they had a common set of owners.The prices of investments held by LTCM
had become a function of market expectations of the trading decisions of the fund’s managers.As
the fund tried to sell its investments, so did those who were copying its trading behaviour.This
increased the difﬁculty encountered by LTCM when attempting to make its sales.There was a
problem of reﬂexivity in that LTCM was not simply reacting to market conditions;it was creating
market conditions.
Having a risky position combined with a high degree of gearing can be very dangerous.LTCM
nearly became bankrupt.By late 1998 investors in LTCM had suffered losses of over 90%.LTCM
had to be rescued by a group of major banks organised by the US Federal Reserve.LTCM suffered
from aspects of markets that are explicable in terms of behavioural ﬁnance rather than traditional
economic analysis. One aspect was the tendency for ‘irrational’ trading behaviour to persist for a
long time.The ‘irrational’sentiment behind a price anomaly could persist for a long time,and due
to herding it could be shared by a large number of investors.In such a situation betting against the
herd can be dangerous.A trader taking such a bet can make substantial losses if the anomaly is slow
to be corrected, and if it becomes larger before it becomes smaller. In principle arbitrage should
correct price anomalies, but arbitragers may be overwhelmed by ‘irrational’ traders for long
periods.One is reminded of J.M.Keynes’s adage that markets can remain irrational for longer than
you can remain solvent. Even when hedge funds do hedge, the hedging is not complete. Some
dimensions may be hedged, for example exposure to general bond market movements, whilst
other dimensions remain exposed (dimensions such as factors that affect relative price movements).
A signiﬁcant amount of risk may be borne. Long-Term Capital Management was dissolved in
December 1999.

SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING
There is an investment style, or family of styles, that considers more than the return and risk
characteristics of portfolios.These styles also encompass an ethical dimension.The funds following
a Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) approach would avoid investments in companies that fail
certain ethical criteria.
SRI funds vary as to what type of investment is avoided.Investments that are commonly avoided
by such funds include the securities of companies involved in armaments,alcoholic drinks,tobacco
products, and gambling. SRI funds might also avoid investments in companies that are seen as
having poor records in terms of environmental pollution, exploitation of labour, or cruelty to
animals. There are some investments that are regarded as desirable by some SRI funds and
undesirable by others. For example nuclear power may be seen as desirable by some funds since
it avoids the emission of greenhouse gases,whereas other funds could see it as undesirable because
of the risk of accidents and contamination.The relative aversion to particular industries can vary
over time. For example Statman (2005) pointed out that in 1999 gambling was the second most
likely industry to be screened out by SRI funds whereas by 2003 it had fallen to ﬁfth.
It might be thought that investors would have SRI real estate funds available, as well as SRI
equity funds, since different building designs and locations can have considerable signiﬁcance for
the environment.Property funds holding only environment friendly real estate might be expected
to appeal to environmentally conscious property fund investors.Rapson et al. (2007) reported that
there were few SRI property funds available.They also found that the institutional investors,which
were active in the provision of SRI funds for ﬁnancial assets, did not necessarily show an SRI
approach in their real estate investments.Also companies showing environmental concerns with
regard to property were not necessarily very active in the provision of SRI equity funds.
Statman (2005) suggested that SRI funds vary in terms of how strictly they adhere to the
principles of social responsibility. If the adherence is so strict that investment returns could be
reduced, the number of investors in a fund might be reduced. Statman cited evidence that most
investors would avoid SRI funds if they believed that investment returns would be adversely affected
by the SRI approach.There may be a trade-off in that some relaxation of the adherence to SRI
principles could be required in order to attract enough investors to render a fund viable.
Some funds use a positive ethical screening approach. Such funds would choose to invest in
companies whose objectives are seen as ethically desirable.Examples might include companies that
recycle waste or supply organically produced food. More typical is the fund that adopts negative
ethical screening. Negative ethical screening eliminates ethically undesirable companies. Some
funds go a step further and attempt to inﬂuence company policy by means of investor activism or
engagement with companies (Hudson 2006).For example the fund managers may propose motions
at the annual general meetings of companies, or even attempt to get their representatives onto
boards of directors as non-executive directors.
The ethics upon which a fund may be based could be derived from religious beliefs. Muslims
often seek investments that conform to Shariah (Islamic) law. In this case companies eliminated
by the screening process would include those involved in alcohol,gambling,pork,and pornography.
Although Shariah law forbids the payment or receipt of interest, share dividends and other
forms of proﬁt sharing are acceptable. FTSE International, a major producer of stock indices, has
STYLES OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
359

created a Global Islamic Index that tracks the performance of stocks regarded as consistent with
Shariah law.
Ethical screening poses practical problems.There is the issue of whether a company is seen as
ethical. For example avoidance of companies involved in alcohol would obviously preclude
breweries and distilleries. Does the preclusion extend to pub chains, which sell food and soft
drinks as well as alcohol? Does it extend to restaurant chains that offer alcohol to be consumed
with meals? Does it extend to hotel groups, which make alcohol available to residents? Does it
extend to chocolate manufacturers who include liqueurs within their range of products? Judging
companies as ethical or unethical involves deciding upon where to draw the line between the two
types of company.
Another practical issue concerns the difﬁculty of obtaining relevant information about
companies. It is not necessarily easy to ﬁnd out everything that a company does, and how it does
it. If a company is engaged in unethical operations, it may be reluctant to provide information
about them.Fortunately the investor’s task is eased by organisations that specialise in ascertaining
whether companies meet ethical criteria. In the UK the Ethical Investment Research Service
(EIRIS) maintains a database of ethical funds and individual companies.
Ethical screening could remove many companies from consideration for investment portfolios.
Up to 60% of the FTSE 100 companies could be eliminated (Harrison 2005). Large companies
are prone to disqualiﬁcation because they are involved in a vast number of operations, and
somewhere among the operations ethical criteria are likely to be contravened. One result is that
ethical funds are likely to be disproportionately weighted towards small and medium-sized
companies.There is a danger that ethical screening leaves a fund dependent upon a small number
of sectors.To help with the evaluation of the performance of ethical funds,stock indices based on
ethically acceptable stocks have been constructed.These include the FTSE4Good stock indices.
It might be thought that SRI funds would,on average,underperform other funds since they are
more restricted in their investment choices.Funds able to choose any investment might be expected
to outperform those with a more restricted range from which to select.Also SRI funds might be
expected to be relatively poor in terms of portfolio returns (and risks) because they have multiple
objectives; a situation which renders their task more difﬁcult than that of funds whose objectives
are deﬁned solely in terms of return and risk. Furthermore the companies in which they invest
may pursue multiple objectives rather than simply proﬁt-maximisation. For example the Global
Reporting Institute seeks a ‘triple bottom line’ reporting framework, wherein accounting proﬁt
is not the only measure of company performance.The satisfaction of ethical criteria must,according
to this framework, also be treated as objectives.
The research evidence appears not to support the view that SRI funds underperform other
funds in terms of investment returns and risk. Guerard (1997) and Diltz (1995) concluded that
there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between ethically screened and unscreened equity
portfolios in terms of performance.Van de Velde et al. (2005) also found no statistically signiﬁcant
difference between the returns on SRI funds and other funds. D’Antonio et al. (1997) obtained
similar results for the case of bond investments.There is some evidence that SRI funds have enjoyed
higher returns than the average (Heal 2001).This is reﬂected in the relative performance of stock
indices that are based on the types of stock used in SRI funds.The Goodmoney Industrial Average
is a stock index designed to cover the same industries as the stocks used to calculate the Dow Jones
Industrial Average but screened according to ethical criteria.The Goodmoney has outperformed
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
360

the Dow Jones over some periods.Likewise another index of ethically acceptable stocks,the Dow
Jones Sustainability Index, has outperformed its corresponding general index, the Standard &
Poor’s 500. Hussein and Omran (2005) presented evidence that stock indices based on stocks
chosen to be consistent with Islamic principles outperformed general stock indices over a period
from 1996 to 2003.This period included a bull market and a bear market.Islamic indices showed
relative outperformance during the bull phase but underperformed during the bear market (with
a net outperformance over the whole period).
Of the explanations for the relatively good performance of ethically acceptable stocks, one
concerns management and another relates to consumer behaviour. The management-based
argument suggests that attention to ethical dimensions and strong proﬁtability are two aspects
of high quality management. Managers who succeed in the ethical dimension are seen as being
generally aware and capable, and their abilities also show through in the achievement of high
proﬁts.The consumer-based argument suggests that the companies shunned by SRI funds are
also boycotted by socially concerned consumers. Such consumer boycotts undermine the
proﬁtability of companies that fail SRI criteria, and cause the relative underperformance of their
stocks.
To the extent that investors in SRI funds believe that their investment behaviour affects the
ethical behaviour of companies,their motivation for such investment appears to contradict standard
investment theory. Standard theory suggests that people investing on the basis of ethical criteria
would push up the prices of their chosen stocks, and thereby reduce the anticipated returns.
Investors unconcerned by ethical considerations then sell such overpriced stocks,and in doing so
negate the effects of the ethical investors.Winnett and Lewis (2000) argue that ﬁnancial journalists
promote the idea that SRI investing will have effects on the behaviour of corporations.This could
be seen as a dimension of the ‘illusion of control’identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance.Ethical investors
and ﬁnancial journalists could be seen as suffering from the illusion that investment behaviour
affects corporate behaviour.
Webley et al. (2001) found that ethical investors demonstrated a strong commitment to ethical
investment.They were prepared to persist with ethical investments even if the funds performed
badly. In fact some investors were found to increase their ethical investments when those
investments performed badly, whereas poor performance by other funds led to reduced
investment.The ethical nature of a fund is seen as a desirable characteristic alongside high expected
return and low risk; to many investors it may be the most important characteristic. For some
investors ethical investment is based on ideology and identity,and they may regard their investments
as making a statement about their identity. Ethical investments are seen as contributors to their
self-image.Such investors might be committed to ethical investments even if ethical investing had
no effect on the behaviour of businesses. Some ethical investors hold both ethical and ordinary
funds.This could be explained in terms of the behavioural ﬁnance concept of mental accounting,
whereby investors are seen as separating their wealth into a number of different portfolios.The
separate portfolios are then managed according to differing criteria. Ethical criteria may be used
for some of the portfolios, but not all.

EMERGING MARKET FUNDS
The term ‘emerging markets’ tends to be used for stock markets in countries with low national
income per person,or for markets where the total capitalisation of the stock market is low relative
to national income. Emerging markets, especially those in the ﬁrst group, tend to be particularly
risky.There are certain forms of risk to which they are particularly prone.
Political risk can be very high.A number of commercial services,such as Political Risk Services,
assess political risk.Political risk exists in all markets,but is probably greatest in emerging markets.
Diamonte et al. (1996) found that changes in political risk had a greater impact on emerging
markets than on developed markets. Emerging market countries are sometimes prone to abrupt
changes in government. Mei and Guo (2004) found an association between political uncertainty
and ﬁnancial crises.Their study revealed that most ﬁnancial crises had happened during periods of
elections and political transition.There was increased market volatility in election and transition
periods.Corruption is often endemic in emerging economies.Sometimes major shareholders are
also members of the government of the country.External shareholders could be at a disadvantage

PRINCIPLES
SWIP ISLAMIC GLOBAL EQUITY FUND
The SWIP Islamic Global Equity Fund aims to provide investors with long-term capital growth
by investing in global equities. The portfolio contains shares from around 75 companies whose
activities are compliant with Islamic Shariah principles. This means we aim to avoid investing in
companies whose activities include:
■
gambling
■
tobacco
■
the production or sale of pork products
■
the production of intoxicating liquor
■
arms manufacturing
■
non-Islamically structured banking, ﬁnance, investment or life insurance business, or any
other interest-related activity.
The benchmark index of the fund is the FTSE Global Islamic index, which contains around 1,500
stocks. We will normally hold stocks contained within the index. We may also invest in a company
not on the index if we think it will beneﬁt long-term performance. To ensure such companies are
appropriate under Islamic law, we have employed a specialist screening provider to research their
suitability. The Shariah Advisory Board will then ultimately approve the stock.

in such cases.New taxes may be imposed on investment income payable to non-residents,foreign
investors may face restrictions on the nature of their investments, and investments may even be
expropriated. Regulations relating to the repatriation of capital can be a concern for foreign
investors.The prospect of such regulations being introduced or tightened can be a signiﬁcant
deterrent to investment in the affected country, and such regulations severely affect the liquidity
of existing investments.
Liquidity is often a problem in emerging markets. Finding trading counterparties can be a
problem. Large price concessions may be necessary to ﬁnd buyers or sellers. Ownership is
sometimes concentrated in a few hands.In such cases large investors may have market power that
can be used to an investor’s disadvantage.
There is also information risk in that accounting standards,and ﬁnancial analysis,are often poor
in emerging markets.This may be combined with poor market regulation, inadequate corporate
governance,and little legal protection for investors.When such factors are combined with a culture
of corruption,plus family and social networks that intertwine between markets and governments,
the outside investor is at risk of being severely disadvantaged relative to the insiders.
La Porta et al. (2000) pointed out that countries with well-functioning legal systems and legal
protection of investors have more developed capital (stock and bond) markets.The type of legal
system affects the level of investor protection;the common law system,which tends to be used in
British Commonwealth countries, gives relatively good protection since it allows the application
of the principle of fairness.They also found a negative relationship between investor protection
and concentration of ownership, particularly where the concentration entailed family control of
companies.Concentration of ownership,within a family,of a company may be associated with poor
protection for the other investors.Such concentration of ownership is a feature of many emerging
markets.
One attraction of emerging market investments, as components of diversiﬁed portfolios, is
their low correlations with investments in developed markets.This gives scope for reducing
portfolio risk.However Barry et al. (1998) found evidence of an increase in correlations.They also
found that emerging markets, considered individually, tend to display much more risk without
providing more return than developed markets.
Bruner et al. (2003) provided an overview of issues relating to investments in emerging markets.
Their deﬁnition of an emerging market entailed criteria that indicated that the market was in
transition to becoming developed (so many of the underdeveloped markets were not considered
to be emerging markets).They pointed out that many emerging markets were not completely
open to foreign investors.They also suggested that the availability and reliability of information
are signiﬁcant features in the distinction between emerging and developed markets, as is the
transparency of the market.The information concerned encompasses both market-wide and
company-speciﬁc data.The quantity and quality of information, together with the speed and
accuracy with which the market processes information, tend to be inferior in emerging markets
compared with developed markets.They also conﬁrmed that,whereas relatively low correlations
with developed markets continues to make emerging markets attractive from the perspective of
risk reduction by diversiﬁcation,the correlations are tending to increase as the emerging markets
become increasingly integrated with global markets.In consequence the diversiﬁcation advantages
are being reduced.They also conﬁrmed that,individually,emerging markets tend to have relatively
high volatility without necessarily offering higher prospective returns.

Objective
To aim to provide capital growth by investing in emerging market companies. These companies
will either be incorporated in emerging markets or, if incorporated elsewhere, derive a majority
of their revenue from, or from activities related to, emerging markets. For the avoidance of doubt
the Fund may also invest in securities of other investment vehicles whose objectives are compatible
with that of the Fund.
Summary
The Fund’s investment process is designed to provide exposure to the growth potential of the
world’s emerging markets by delivering performance comparable to that of the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index. The Fund is managed primarily on a passive basis to replicate the performance
of its benchmark by using risk control techniques such as optimisation and stratiﬁed sampling.
Where the fund manager can identify good potential for excess returns on a risk-adjusted basis,
she may seek to add value through Henderson’s proprietary Multi-Strategy Enhanced Index
process.

CONCLUSION
Chapter 13 on portfolio diversiﬁcation described the principles of portfolio construction
based on the Markowitz equations; an approach known as mean-variance optimisation. Investors
were seen as choosing between combinations of risky assets and a risk-free asset, along the
capital market line.
In practice, fund management deviates from mean-variance optimisation. Many investors like
to make forecasts about the relative performance of shares (and other securities),and to bias their
portfolios towards the prospective strong performers to the extent that they deviate from mean-
variance optimisation.This is referred to as active fund management.
Other investors take passive approaches to fund management, which entail deviation from
mean-variance optimisation.One form of passive management is the buy-and-hold strategy,which
involves buying a portfolio of investments and holding that same portfolio irrespective of any
subsequent changes in views about prospective returns, risks, and correlations. So even if the
portfolio is initially mean-variance efﬁcient, it would deviate from mean-variance efﬁciency over
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
366

time.Another form of passive fund management is index tracking.This is the attempt to mirror
the performance of a stock index. Stock indices are unlikely to be mean-variance efﬁcient.
The Markowitz equations may be applied to the entire portfolio.This is referred to as one-stage
portfolio construction. Multi-stage portfolio construction entails the construction of sub-
portfolios, and the combination of the sub-portfolios into a total portfolio. Each sub-portfolio
may be constructed using the Markowitz equations, or may use a different approach. The
construction of a portfolio of sub-portfolios may be based on the Markowitz equations, or may
entail a different approach.When a multi-stage portfolio strategy is used, it may utilise a variety
of different techniques of portfolio construction.
Prospective returns, risks, and correlations may not be the only criteria used for the selection
of investments for a portfolio. Many investors are concerned about the ethical dimension of their
investments. Such investors may wish to avoid investments in companies involved in armaments,
gambling,tobacco,and alcohol.They may also take account of companies’attitudes to environmental
or human rights issues when deciding upon where to invest.
Psychological biases can affect investment choices. For example the familiarity bias causes
people to invest in companies that they feel that they know and understand. Mental accounting
leads people to create a set of separate portfolios, perhaps each being related to a particular goal.
The use of a set of distinct portfolios may help people to organise their ﬁnancial affairs.Although
mental accounting leads investors away from mean-variance optimisation, it may nonetheless be
useful. However it may be the case that people ignore correlations between assets to an excessive
extent, and could beneﬁt from the Markowitz insights concerning the desirability of low
correlations for risk reduction.
One group of institutional investors, hedge funds, use a very wide variety of portfolio
constructions. Some emphasise arbitrage, some use high levels of gearing, some take heavy bets
on the direction of price movements, and many make substantial use of derivatives.Those using
derivatives sometimes construct very complex structured products. The variety of styles of
portfolio construction used by hedge funds is vast. Hedge funds are primarily aimed at other
institutional investors and high net worth individuals.However retail investors can invest in them
through funds of hedge funds.

Chapter 17
Evaluating the performance
of fund managers
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The measurement of money-weighted and time-weighted rates of return.
2. The evaluation of risk.
3. The assessment of portfolio performance using reward per unit of risk.
4. The assessment of portfolio performance using differential return.
5. The inadequacies of the alternative measures of portfolio performance.
6. The attribution of fund performance between asset allocation and stock selection.
7. The assessment of market-timing skills.
8. Evidence relating to the persistence of fund performance.
Frequently portfolio performance is evaluated by means of comparison with general stock indices,
such as the FTSE 100 or FTSE All-Share Index.However this may not be appropriate if the evaluated
fund follows a particular style.For example a smaller companies fund should be compared with a
smaller companies index rather than a general stock index.Also portfolios have management and
transaction costs, whereas indices do not. For this reason it may be more appropriate to evaluate
the performance of a fund against that of other funds. For this purpose a comparison universe of
other funds may be used.
The evaluation of portfolio performance is often made on the basis of returns alone. Since
maximising the rate of return is seldom the sole objective of a fund manager, the evaluation of
performance should address itself to more than one criterion of success. Furthermore merely
measuring realised performance is insufﬁcient;attention should also be paid to the sources of over-
or underperformance.
Portfolio return is the most obvious criterion of success, but it is not obvious how return is to
be measured. In addition to the question of the start and end dates to be used (a decision that can
make a huge difference to apparent performance) there is the choice between money- and time-
weighted measures.These alternatives will be detailed in the ﬁrst section.

Risk is the second most frequently cited measure of performance.The second section will look
at alternative measures of risk.This will be followed by a consideration of risk-return relationships
and the various measures that aim to provide a single number that simultaneously evaluates return
and risk. Related to this is the matter of the benchmarks against which values can be judged.
Although return and risk will be the criteria to receive most attention in what follows it is
important to bear in mind that they are not the only criteria. Other criteria will relate to speciﬁc
fund objectives.For example a high income fund might be judged to have failed if its rate of dividend
yield is less than that on the average general fund, or an ethical fund could be viewed negatively if
it is found to be holding shares in a tobacco company. Management, administration, and trading
costs may be another criterion for evaluation.Although it may be argued that if return is measured
net of costs then the ﬁgure for return takes costs into account, some people might contend that
relative returns are partly due to luck and hence cannot be relied on to be repeated in the future
whereas costs are less prone to variation.
MONEY- AND TIME-WEIGHTED MEASURES OF RETURN
The distinction between money- and time-weighted measures of return arises when there are cash
inﬂows to,or outﬂows from,the portfolio during the period of assessment.The money-weighted
measure uses the rate of discount that equates the present values of the inﬂows and outﬂows.
Suppose that a share is bought for £1 and one year later another is purchased at the new price of
£1.06.The price at the end of the second year is also £1.06. A dividend of £0.04 per share is
received at the end of each year.The money-weighted rate of return is given by r in the following
expression:
£1  £1.06/(1r)  £0.04/(1r)  £0.08/(1r)2  £2.12/(1r)2
This gives a rate of return of about 5.8% p.a.
The time-weighted approach calculates a rate for each period separately and ﬁnds the
average.Thus:
Period 1
(£0.04  £0.06)/£1  0.1 i.e. 10%
Period 2
£0.08/£2.12  0.0377 i.e. 3.77%
This implies a compound average rate of:
√(1.1)(1.0377) 1  0.0684  6.84% p.a.
The time periods used will depend on the frequency of cash ﬂows.The time-weighted measure
of return should be based on periods during which no cash ﬂows take place.
Although it is not the case that one measure is always more appropriate than the other, the
time-weighted approach seems to be more favoured than the money-weighted method when
evaluating the performance of fund managers.This preference arises because portfolio managers
typically do not control the cash inﬂows and outﬂows to which their funds are subjected.Additions
to,and withdrawals from,a fund will affect the money-weighted rate of return.Two fund managers
EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF FUND MANAGERS
369

may choose identical portfolios but differ in their money-weighted rates of return because of
different patterns of additions and withdrawals on the part of clients. Money-weighted rates of
return should not be compared with rates on a benchmark portfolio since the two portfolios are
unlikely to have the same pattern of cash inﬂows and outﬂows, and the pattern of such cash ﬂows
will affect the money-weighted rate of return.
A third approach is to take the arithmetic mean of a succession of periodic returns. For
most purposes this is unsatisfactory.To illustrate its unsatisfactory nature, consider an outcome
in which an investment doubles in value during one period and halves the next period.
Obviously the investment has the same value after the two periods as it had at the beginning.
The two-period return is zero. Using an arithmetic average, the two-period return is
calculated as:
(100%  50%)/ 2  25%
which is clearly incorrect.In this case the time-weighted approach provides the correct answer,
since it uses a geometric rather than an arithmetic average.
2  0.5  1
√1  1  0
There is one possible use of the arithmetic average. It could be seen as indicating the typical
periodic return. Consider the following series of returns:
10% 15% 20% 10% 15% 20%
Arguably the typical rate of return is 15%.This ﬁgure is provided by the arithmetic average,
but not by the geometric average.If the investor asks the question ‘What rate of return can I expect
this period?’the answer is provided by the arithmetic average.The arithmetic average has its worth
when the focus is on the return of a single period. It is not satisfactory when the concern is with
the average rate of return over a number of periods.
THE EVALUATION OF RISK
Much of the academic work on portfolio performance evaluation has been concerned with whether
the returns are more than, or below, what would be expected on the basis of the level of risk
incurred. Substantial attention will be paid to such risk-adjusted measures of portfolio return in
what follows. Prior to that, two general points relating to risk should be mentioned.
If the fund objectives include maintenance of a particular risk proﬁle, then deviation from the
corresponding risk level would be regarded negatively.A fund with the objective of below average
risk should not exhibit risk levels above those of otherwise similar funds.
There is a widespread acceptance that some risk cannot be diversiﬁed away, whereas
other forms of risk can. It is reasonable to expect that a fund manager will diversify the portfolio
to the extent required to remove unnecessary risk. Although some funds, for example high
technology funds, may have objectives that render full diversiﬁcation impossible, portfolio
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
370

managers should still be expected to avoid risk that can be removed by means of the level of
diversiﬁcation permitted by the fund policy.While some risk will always remain, fund managers
should be judged negatively if they fail to employ diversiﬁcation to the full extent consistent
with fund objectives.
REWARD PER UNIT OF RISK
A crude approach to risk adjustment is to rank the performance of a fund relative to a class of funds.
For example if a fund were classiﬁed as an international growth fund, its performance would be
ranked against other international growth funds. However this is an unsatisfactory form of risk
adjustment since international growth funds would have varying levels of risk and there may be
sub-groups of funds, which may be more relevant as benchmarks (for example international
technology, or international smaller companies).
More sophisticated risk-adjusted measures of return fall into two types. One type is
concerned with the returns relative to the risk undertaken, and involves a division of returns
by the level of risk incurred in order to obtain those returns. This is often referred to as
‘reward per unit of risk’.This section will elaborate that approach.The following section will be
concerned with an alternative approach, which ascertains the difference between the returns on
the managed portfolio and those on a benchmark portfolio, often referred to as the ‘differential
return’ measure.
The Sharpe and Treynor Measures
Two portfolio performance measures that use reward per unit of risk are the ‘Sharpe’and ‘Treynor’
measures.Both use excess return in the sense of the excess of the portfolio return over the return
on a risk-free investment such as a Treasury bill or a short-term bank deposit.This excess return
is then divided by a measure of risk so as to ascertain the amount of excess return for each
unit of risk undertaken.The Sharpe measure uses the standard deviation of returns of the port-
folio to measure risk whereas the Treynor measure uses the portfolio beta as the numerical
indicator of risk.
Algebraically these can be described as:
Sharpe measure
(Rp  Rf)/p
Treynor measure
(Rp  Rf)/p
Rp is the rate of return on the portfolio,Rf is the rate of return on a risk-free investment,p is
the standard deviation of returns on the portfolio, and p is the portfolio beta.
The Treynor measure tends to be favoured when the portfolio being assessed is one of a number
of portfolios being held such that any non-systematic (ﬁrm-speciﬁc) risk can be expected to be
removed by diversiﬁcation. In such a case only the non-diversiﬁable (systematic) risk is relevant.
Beta is a measure of non-diversiﬁable risk.
The Sharpe measure is appropriate when the portfolio stands alone rather than being part of a
portfolio of portfolios.In that case all risk should be included.So the portfolio standard deviation,
which encompasses both diversiﬁable and non-diversiﬁable risk, should be used.
EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF FUND MANAGERS
371

M Squared
A variation of the Sharpe measure is known as the M2 (or Modigliani squared) measure
(Modigliani and Modigliani 1997; Graham and Harvey 1997).The M2 measure uses the standard
deviations of the portfolios being compared but instead of obtaining ﬁgures for reward per unit
of risk, it obtains measures of return for the purposes of the comparison. The M2 measure
brings the standard deviations of the portfolios into equality with the standard deviation of a stock
index, such as the FTSE All-Share Index, by (hypothetically) investing in risk-free assets
or borrowing. For example if a portfolio has a standard deviation which is twice that of the
stock index, the portfolio would be adjusted so that it is 50% invested in the original portfolio
and 50% invested in risk-free assets (such as Treasury bills or bank deposits).Conversely a portfolio
that has a standard deviation which is two-thirds that of the stock index would be geared
by borrowing a sum equivalent to half the value of the original portfolio.The borrowed money
would be invested in a portfolio with the same composition as the original portfolio with the
effect that the new adjusted portfolio would have a standard deviation equal to that of the
stock index.
Since all the adjusted portfolios have a standard deviation equal to that of the stock index there
is no need for any further risk adjustment.The portfolios can be evaluated simply by comparing
the returns of the adjusted portfolios.The M2 measure of the performance of a portfolio is the
return on the adjusted portfolio minus the return on the stock index.
Information Ratios
Another variation on the Sharpe measure is the information ratio.The information ratio typically
uses the return on a stock index portfolio in the place of the return on a risk-free investment
(Chapman 2006). Since performance measures are seen as indicators of investment management
skill, comparison of returns with a passive strategy seems appropriate.This is approximated by
comparing portfolio returns with the returns from a stock index (which may have been the index
used in an index tracking strategy).
The divisor would also be based on the returns from a stock index portfolio. Instead of using
the standard deviation of returns of the evaluated portfolio (or the standard deviation of the excess
returns over a risk-free rate) information ratios often use the standard deviation of returns relative
to those on the portfolio of shares that reﬂects a stock index (the standard deviation of the excess
returns over the returns from a stock index portfolio).On this measure it is the investment manager
who keeps the variations in portfolio returns close to those of the stock index portfolio who is
judged to be low risk. Information ratios use non-systematic risk, rather than total risk, when
measuring excess return per unit of risk.This non-systematic risk tends to arise from active
investment management decisions, and hence could be referred to as management risk or active
risk. If an investment manager comes close to tracking the stock index, the standard deviation
would be very low. If the manager simultaneously succeeds in outperforming the index, the
information ratio would be high.
An information ratio might be expressed as:
(N  S) / (NS)
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
372

where N is the return on the portfolio being evaluated,S is the return on a stock index portfolio,
and (NS) is the standard deviation of the difference between N and S.The information ratio
could be seen as the return from taking non-systematic risk divided by the amount of non-
systematic risk taken, or as the return from active portfolio management divided by the
management (active) risk incurred.
A Generalised Sharpe Ratio
Dowd (2000) pointed out that,when considering an addition to an existing portfolio,the evaluation
of the additional investment should take account of its correlation with the existing portfolio.
The additional investment could be either an individual security or a portfolio. For example a
relatively poor Sharpe ratio may be acceptable if it is associated with negative correlation between
the additional investment and the existing portfolio (so that the additional investment reduces
portfolio risk). In other words the benchmark against which returns are measured should not be
the risk-free interest rate, or the returns on a stock index, but a benchmark reﬂecting the
correlation with the existing portfolio.Dowd suggested that the required (i.e.benchmark) return
on the additional investment should be the expected return on the existing portfolio adjusted by
a risk premium. The risk premium depends on the ratio between the standard deviation of
the existing portfolio and the standard deviation of the prospective new portfolio, which
incorporates the additional investment.
To be acceptable, an additional investment that increases portfolio risk must enhance the
portfolio rate of return.The Sharpe ratio of the prospective new portfolio (the portfolio following
the incorporation of the additional investment) should be at least equal to the Sharpe ratio of the
existing portfolio.Evaluation of whether an additional investment meets this criterion requires use
of the generalised Sharpe measure.Whereas the conventional Sharpe measure uses the risk-free
interest rate as the benchmark,and the information ratio uses a stock index as the benchmark,the
generalised Sharpe ratio uses the return on the existing portfolio adjusted for a premium reﬂecting
correlation.
The generalised Sharpe measure might be expressed as:
(N  B) / (NB)
where N is the expected return on the additional investment, B is the benchmark return
(expected return on the existing portfolio adjusted by a premium), and (NB) is the standard
deviation of the difference between N and B.
DIFFERENTIAL RETURN
The differential-return method of evaluating fund performance involves comparing the return
on the fund with the return on a benchmark portfolio.The benchmark could be a stock index
portfolio,such as the FTSE 100,or could be an average of funds with similar objectives to the fund
being assessed. Using a stock index fails to take account of differences in risk between the stock
index portfolio and the fund being evaluated.Comparison with the average performance of similar
funds comes closer to comparing like with like,in particular it involves a benchmark with broadly
EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF FUND MANAGERS
373

equivalent risk.However the risk adjustment is crude,and it could be the case that funds on average
underperform some absolute benchmark (one advantage of using a stock index portfolio is that it
can be interpreted as an absolute benchmark).
An alternative benchmark could be the returns on a hypothetical portfolio whose risk matches
that of the fund being evaluated.This provides a relatively precise risk adjustment together with
provision of an absolute benchmark (but begs the question as to whether it represents an attainable
portfolio;only portfolio characteristics that can be attained with an actual portfolio can reasonably
be used to assess the performance of real portfolios).
Jensen’s Alpha
One technique that utilises hypothetical fund characteristics is the ‘Jensen’ measure.This derives
a benchmark rate of return using the securities market line from the capital asset pricing model.
The securities market line provides a theoretical rate of return comprising two components.The
ﬁrst component is a risk-free rate of return (such as the return on Treasury bills or deposits in major
banks), the second component is a reward for accepting risk.
The component of expected return that is seen as the reward for accepting risk is the product
of the portfolio beta (the beta of the portfolio being evaluated) and the market excess return.The
market excess return is the difference between the return on a balanced portfolio,consisting of a
mix of all available investments (often approximated by a stock index portfolio), and the return
on risk-free assets.Algebraically:
Rb  Rf  p( Rm  Rf)
(1)
where Rb is the expected or theoretical rate of return on the assessed portfolio,Rm is the return
on the market portfolio,Rf is the risk-free rate of return,and p is the beta of the portfolio being
assessed.By using the beta of the portfolio under assessment,the comparison of the observed and
expected returns provides a risk-adjusted evaluation.The systematic risk of the hypothetical
portfolio is rendered equal to that of the evaluated portfolio so that returns can be compared
without any further need for risk adjustment.
The differential return is expressed as Rp  Rb.If this is positive the realised return on the fund
being evaluated exceeds the benchmark rate of return and the fund is viewed as over-performing.
Conversely a negative value indicates underperformance.Rp  Rb is often referred to as Jensen’s
alpha. It is estimated simultaneously with beta by regressing portfolio excess returns (portfolio
returns minus the risk-free rate of interest) against market excess returns. Both positive and
negative alphas often fail to be (statistically) signiﬁcantly different from zero.
The use of beta as the measure of portfolio risk is appropriate when diversiﬁable risk can be
ignored.Such would be the case if the portfolio being evaluated is extremely well diversiﬁed or is
part of a larger portfolio such that the larger portfolio contains no diversiﬁable (ﬁrm-speciﬁc)
risk.If neither of these conditions holds then the standard deviation of returns becomes the relevant
measure of risk.
Jensen’s alpha uses the security market line of the single-factor capital asset pricing model
to obtain an index of portfolio performance.Corresponding performance indices can be generated
using multi-factor models.The single-factor model treats market risk (measured by beta) as
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
374

the only risk factor that determines the benchmark return (required rate of return) of a
portfolio. Multi-factor forms of the capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing
model allow for other risk factors (such as company size and macroeconomic variables) to
have an inﬂuence on the benchmark rate of return. Multi-factor models entail multiple betas
and, like the single-factor model, ignore non-systematic risk which is assumed to be removed
by diversiﬁcation.
Appraisal Ratios
The appraisal ratio extends the Jensen alpha to provide a measure of abnormal return per unit
of non-systematic risk. Jensen’s alpha represents the average of the deviations from the
security market line. Non-systematic risk could be measured as the standard deviation of
the observed deviations from the security market line. The appraisal ratio is obtained by
dividing Jensen’s alpha by this standard deviation. If the evaluated portfolio is well diversiﬁed,
or is part of a broader portfolio that removes non-systematic risk by diversiﬁcation, the
appraisal ratio has no signiﬁcance. Appraisal ratios are similar to information ratios, with the
difference that a benchmark return based on the security market line is used instead of the
return on a stock index portfolio.
Use of the Capital Market Line
Parallel to the use of beta and the securities market line by the Jensen measure it is possible to
produce a benchmark rate of return using the portfolio standard deviation within the capital market
line of the capital asset pricing model.The algebraic formulation would be:
Rb  Rf  (Rm  Rf)Sp/Sm
(2)
which differs from the Jensen measure in using the ratio of the standard deviation of the
evaluated portfolio (measuring the total risk, diversiﬁable as well as non-diversiﬁable) to the
standard deviation of the market portfolio.This ratio is used in the place of beta, which measures
non-diversiﬁable risk only.

PROBLEMS WITH PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In relation to the performance measures that use beta a problem arises because of the unreliability
of estimates of beta. Betas are calculated from historical price data.The values of beta derived
from the statistical analysis will vary according to the time intervals used (e.g. upon whether
weekly, monthly, or quarterly data is employed).They will also vary with differences in the time
spans from which the data is taken (e.g. upon whether observed values are taken from the last
year, last ﬁve years, or last ten years). Betas can also vary when different stock indices are used as
proxies for the market portfolio (which in principle contains all assets).The rankings of portfolios,
relative to one another,will thus be dependent upon the database used for the estimation of beta.
It should also be remembered that beta values are estimates. Statistical analysis of historical
data produces an estimate of the true beta.The estimate is unlikely to equal precisely the true
beta.The estimate is subject to a margin of error (standard error).Portfolio performance evaluation
that uses beta is vulnerable to the possibility that the estimate of beta used may be substantially
different from the true value that should be used.The difﬁculties are compounded by the likelihood
that the true value of the portfolio beta varied over the time period being considered.This is partly
because of changes in individual stock betas and partly due to changes in the composition of the
portfolio.Fama and French (2004) go so far as to suggest that,because of the failures of the capital
asset pricing model when tested empirically, beta should not be used in portfolio performance
evaluation.
Measures of performance using standard deviations of return face problems of interpretation
when a fund manager deliberately changes the beta of the portfolio during the period of assessment.
Such variations in beta are likely to reﬂect market views taken by the portfolio manager; a bullish
view leads to an increased beta, vice versa for a bearish view. Changes in beta are associated with
changes in expected portfolio returns. In effect the fund manager is engineering variations in
portfolio returns.These controlled ﬂuctuations in returns should not be regarded as resulting from
uncertainty, and should not be deemed to be due to portfolio risk. Unfortunately the standard
deviation of returns incorporates such variations and hence treats them as reﬂecting risk.
In addition,over- or underperformance may be the result of luck rather than the relative skills
of the fund managers. Over- or underperformance needs to be shown to persist for a number of
years before conclusions can be drawn about fund managers’ investment skills.
When ranking funds on a risk-adjusted basis some will appear to be outstanding performers.
The question arises as to whether such funds should be seen as having superior investment
management. If they do exhibit high-quality fund management, they would be candidates for
purchase.However some funds would show exceptional performance simply as a matter of chance.
Marcus (1990) looked at the performance of the Magellan fund in the United States.That fund had
outperformed the S&P 500 index in 11 out of the 13 years up to 1989, and appeared to be a star
performer. Using computer simulations Marcus found that, in a sample of 500 funds, the
expectation was that there is a 99.8% chance that the best performing fund would beat a stock index
in 11 years or more.
Weidig et al. (2005) pointed out that when evaluating private equity funds (which include
venture capital trusts) data problems are signiﬁcant.The absence of continuous fund pricing based
on actual transactions,and the frequent absence of dividend distributions,render the measurement
of performance difﬁcult.The problems of evaluating funds also apply to the evaluation of funds of
EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF FUND MANAGERS
377

funds, which are portfolios of private equity funds. Although these problems may prevent the
evaluation of individual funds of funds,it may be possible to evaluate funds of funds as an asset class.
Weidig et al. constructed hypothetical funds of funds and found a number of features. Using a
technique known as Monte Carlo simulation they randomly constructed 50,000 historically
possible funds of funds, and recorded measures of return and risk. They found that the
diversiﬁcation provided by funds of funds reduces risk,both in terms of standard deviation and in
terms of skewness. Sharpe ratios were found to be three to ﬁve times higher for funds-of-funds
than for individual funds.
Comparison Portfolios
When seeking a basis for comparison of a fund manager’s performance,there are two possibilities.
There is comparison against an average of other fund managers,and comparison against an index.
The reward-per-unit-of-risk approaches above tend to compare a fund’s performance against that
of other investment managers,whereas the differential-return measures use benchmarks based on
market indices.
When making a comparison against an average of managers it is important that it should be an
average of the managers who started the comparison period rather than an average of the managers
who ﬁnished it. If a manager loses the management of a fund during the period of comparison,
that fund should be considered when calculating average performance.Typically if a manager loses
the management of a fund,it is because of poor performance.A failure to consider such funds when
calculating averages imparts an upward bias to the average.This bias is known as ‘survivorship bias’
and it should be avoided.
Value-at-Risk and the Omega Measure
Instead of measuring portfolio performance in terms of reward per unit of risk or differential
return,value-at-risk provides an evaluation in terms of the size of prospective losses.Behavioural
ﬁnance (in particular prospect theory) suggests that investors exhibit loss-aversion. Investors are
seen as being particularly concerned about the possibility of loss. Measures based on reward per
unit of risk take account of risk-aversion but not loss-aversion. Risk-aversion treats upside
deviations and downside deviations as equally bad,whereas prospect theory indicates that downside
deviations (in particular losses) are the more important dimension of risk to investors.Value-at-
risk provides a measure that indicates the prospective size of losses,and hence may be of relevance
to loss-averse investors.
Value-at-risk is the maximum loss that a portfolio is likely to suffer, during a speciﬁed period
and with a speciﬁed probability.If there is a 5% probability that the value of a portfolio will fall by
more than £1 million during a month, the value-at-risk for one month and 95% conﬁdence is £1
million.The ﬁgure for the value-at-risk might be interpreted as the loss,which has a chance of 5%
of being exceeded (when the conﬁdence level is 95%) or a chance of 1% of being exceeded (if the
conﬁdence level is 99%).
Figure 17.1 illustrates value-at-risk with conﬁdence levels of 95% (5% chance that there will
be a loss greater than the value-at-risk) and 99% (1% chance that there will be a loss greater than
the value-at-risk). In these cases, as shown in Chapter 13, value-at-risk is expressed as a number
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
378

of standard deviations from the mean.This value is determined by the chosen conﬁdence level;on
the basis that the distribution of returns follows the standard normal distribution.A conﬁdence
level of 95% will always have a value-at-risk of 1.645 standard deviations,and a conﬁdence level
of 99% will always have a value-at-risk of 2.326 standard deviations.Turning these numbers
into money values requires multiplication by the money value of the standard deviation. If a
portfolio is estimated to have a monthly standard deviation of returns of £100,000, the value-at-
risk at a conﬁdence level of 95% is £164,500 and the value-at-risk at a conﬁdence level of 99% is
£232,600.
Shadwick and Keating (2002) and Murphy (2002) have proposed a measure of portfolio
performance,which they term omega.This measure entails the speciﬁcation of a threshold portfolio
value, or a threshold rate of return. Omega is the ratio of the area, under the distribution curve,
on the right of the threshold to the area on the left of the threshold. In Figure 17.1, omega for a
threshold of 1.645 standard deviations would be 95/5 and omega for a threshold of 2.326
standard deviations would be 99/1.The threshold may be chosen to correspond to a return of zero,
so as to provide a performance measure of use to loss-averse investors.
An advantage of omega is that,unlike measures such as the Sharpe ratio,it does not assume that
the distribution of returns is normally distributed.The normal distribution illustrated in Figure
17.1 is not the typical distribution of returns from investments. More typically distributions of
returns are characterised by kurtosis,which means that the probability of extreme values is greater

than indicated by normal distributions (this is often referred to as ‘fat tails’ since the ends of the
distribution are higher than those of the normal distribution). Distributions are also commonly
characterised by skewness, which means that the peak (known as the mode) of the distribution is
not in the middle. For example the mode may be tilted to the left indicating a concentration of
possible returns towards the low end.A combination of returns skewed towards the bottom, and
a high probability of extreme returns, would be unwelcome to loss-averse investors since it
indicates a signiﬁcant chance of extreme losses.The standard deviation, as used in performance
measures such as the Sharpe ratio, does not reﬂect kurtosis and skewness whereas those two
characteristics of distributions are important dimensions of risk. Loss-averse investors are likely
to be concerned about kurtosis and skewness. Omega does not assume a normal distribution and
it takes account of the effects of kurtosis and skewness.
ATTRIBUTION
The performance of a fund manager depends partly on the allocation of the portfolio between asset
classes (for example between equities,bonds,and deposits) and partly upon selection within classes
(which stocks to buy). If a portfolio contains foreign currency investments there is a currency
dimension to the returns:proﬁts or losses arising from exchange rate movements.It is possible to
measure the contribution of each of these different decisions (asset allocation, stock selection,
and currency choice) to the overall performance of the portfolio.
To separate the effects of asset allocation from those of stock selection,it is necessary to compute
an average return for all investments (weighted by the total market value of each asset class)
for the investment period being considered e.g. the past year.Then an average rate of return of
each asset class is calculated.The results may (hypothetically) be those illustrated by Table 17.1.It
can be seen that equities over-perform by 1.8% p.a., bonds underperform by 2.2% p.a., and
deposits underperform by 4.2% p.a. relative to the average rate of return for the aggregate of all
investments.
The next step is to compare the portfolio that is being evaluated with the average portfolio.
The average portfolio reﬂects the total values of the different asset classes available to be held.
Table 17.2 compares hypothetical ﬁgures for a portfolio being evaluated and an average
portfolio.
It can be seen that the portfolio being evaluated is 15% overweight in equities,10% underweight
in bonds,and 5% underweight in deposits.The portfolio return (relative to the average portfolio)
arising from the asset allocation decision is based on the extent to which it is overweight in the

over-performing asset class and underweight in the underperforming asset classes.The asset
allocation contribution to portfolio performance is thus calculated as shown in Table 17.3.
It can be seen that the total contribution of the asset allocation decision to fund perfor-
mance is:
0.27%  0.22%  0.21%  0.7% p.a.
The portfolio being evaluated has a rate of return of 9% p.a.,whereas the average portfolio has
a rate of return of 8.2% p.a.Thus there is an additional return of 0.8% p.a. of which 0.7% is due
to asset allocation. It follows that the return arising from stock and bond selection is 0.1% p.a.
The contribution of stock and bond selection can be further broken down into sector allocation
and selection within sectors using a procedure similar to that illustrated by Table 17.3.
In order to determine the currency contribution to portfolio return when foreign invest-
ments are included, one approach is to compare a fully hedged version of the fund with a version
that is completely unhedged against currency movements.The proﬁt or loss on the forward
or futures position that is needed to hedge the portfolio equals the loss or proﬁt on the currency
exposure.The currency contribution to portfolio return is the negative of the proﬁt or loss on
the forward or futures position that would be needed to hedge the fund against currency
movements.
Another approach,which aims to ascertain the contribution of currency selection,is to use the
analysis of Tables 17.1, 17.2, and 17.3 but with different currencies rather than different asset
classes.The weightings of the average portfolio of currencies might be based on the relative stock
market capitalisations of the respective countries.
The contribution of country selection to portfolio performance could be ascertained in a similar
way;again possibly using a weighting system based on relative stock market capitalisations.In this

case the returns on broad stock indices could be used in order to separate the effects of country

Style Analysis
Sharpe (1992) developed a technique for ascertaining the asset allocation of a portfolio together
with the extent to which asset allocation explains portfolio returns.The importance of these ideas
is underlined by studies that suggest that more than 90% of portfolio returns can be explained by
asset allocation (e.g. Brinson et al. 1991).
Sharpe considered twelve asset classes (styles).The asset classes were:
■bills
■intermediate bonds
■long-term bonds
■corporate bonds
■mortgages
■value stocks
■growth stocks
■medium-cap stocks
■small stocks
■foreign stocks
■European stocks
■Japanese stocks.
Sharpe regressed fund returns on indices representing the asset classes.The regression coefﬁcient
on each index measures the allocation to that asset class.The R-square of the regression indicates
the proportion of returns explained by the asset allocation.The proportion of return variability
not explained by asset allocation is attributed to security selection within asset classes. The
contribution of security selection to returns was found to average nearly zero (0.074% per
month) and to be normally distributed around the mean (based on 636 mutual funds).
It is common for institutional portfolios, particularly unit trusts and OEICs, to be evaluated
by means of comparison with funds that follow a similar style. Not only does style provide the
relevant peer group of funds against which the performance of a portfolio is to be compared but
it also provides a criterion for evaluation.Investment managers may be evaluated in terms of how
well they remain within the bounds of a style, as well as being evaluated in terms of criteria
such as risk-adjusted return.So,for example,a UK fund that has the stated objective of following
a high income style would be evaluated negatively if its dividend yield were below that of the
FTSE All-Share Index.
An alternative to comparing a fund with a peer group of other funds is to use a style benchmark.
A style benchmark is a portfolio of style indices.Style indices are stock indices designed to reﬂect
the performances of securities belonging to particular styles. Style benchmarks are particularly
useful for evaluating portfolios that exhibit a mixture of styles rather than a single style.For example
a fund might be judged to have a style that is 50% large capitalisation value stocks and 50% small-
capitalisation growth stocks.The benchmark against which its performance is judged would
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
382

comprise an index of large capitalisation value stocks and an index of small capitalisation growth
stocks,in equal proportions.The comparison against the style benchmark could be on either a raw
basis or a risk-adjusted basis.
When evaluating a portfolio that has a mixture of styles, it is necessary to ascertain the
combination of styles possessed by the portfolio. Two approaches to the discovery of the
combination of styles are ‘holdings-based style analysis’and ‘returns-based style analysis’.Holdings-
based style analysis determines investment style by examining the individual securities
(investments) that comprise the portfolio. Each security is classiﬁed as belonging to a particular
style and the combination of securities in the portfolio provides a corresponding combination of
styles. For example if 40% of the portfolio value is accounted for by shares classiﬁed as large
capitalisation growth stocks,the portfolio is seen as being 40% large capitalisation growth.There
would be percentages relating to other styles.For example the remaining 60% might be composed
of 20% small capitalisation growth and 40% high-grade corporate bonds.
One problem with holdings-based style analysis is that fund managers do not continuously
provide updated information about the composition of their portfolios.Information about portfolio
composition is provided at discrete intervals, such as every six months.There is a risk that the
portfolio being analysed and evaluated is out of date. Other problems relate to the difﬁculty of
determining the styles of individual securities,and the large number of securities whose styles may
need to be determined. Returns-based style analysis determines the style (or combination of
styles) of a portfolio by analysing the relationship between its returns and the returns of a portfolio
of style indices. Returns-based style analysis attempts to identify the style(s) of a portfolio by
ﬁnding the combination of style indices that would have most closely replicated the observed
performance of the portfolio over a recent period.
Returns-based style analysis estimates the parameters () of an equation that takes the following
form:
Rp  0  1I1  2I2  3I3
(3)
where Rp is the return on the portfolio being analysed.I1,I2,I3 are the returns on style indices
1, 2, and 3 (there could be any number of style indices). 1, 2, 3 represent the exposures
of the portfolio to the style indices (the s sum to 1). 0 is the component of portfolio return
that is not explained in terms of exposure to style indices, and which may be ascribed to stock
selection.
Equation 3 states that the portfolio behaves as if it comprises three style indices (index
portfolios) in the proportions indicated by the  values.There is a risk that the regression result
is spurious.The portfolio may appear to behave as if it comprises style indices 1,2,and 3 whilst in
reality it might be comprised of styles 4 and 5.
ASSESSING MARKET-TIMING SKILLS
Market timing entails forecasting market movements with a view to adjusting a portfolio to take
advantage of the expected movements. If a fund manager were capable of timing the market, that
manager would raise the portfolio beta before the market rises and lower it before a fall.The
characteristic line for a successful market timer would be concave to the vertical axis as illustrated
EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF FUND MANAGERS
383

in Figure 17.2.The concave characteristic line shows that excess returns on the portfolio being
managed rise more than proportionately to those on the market portfolio; and fall less than
proportionately (excess returns in the sense of excess over the risk-free rate). In Figure 17.2, Rp
represents the excess return on the portfolio being managed and Rm represents the excess return
on the market portfolio.
Treynor and Mazuy (1966) tested US mutual funds (unit trusts) to ﬁnd whether the fund
managers exhibited market-timing ability.The research involved testing whether an equation of
the form shown by equation (4) had a positive 2.
Rp    1Rm  2Rm
2
(4)
A positive 2 would show that the portfolio excess return rises more than in proportion to (and
falls less than proportionately to) the excess return of the market portfolio.They found that 2
was not signiﬁcantly different from zero and therefore concluded that their sample of mutual fund
managers did not exhibit market-timing ability.
Similar research by Henriksson (1984) also cast doubt on the effectiveness of market timing.
Studies of US mutual funds by Daniel et al. (1997) and by Wermers (2000) found no timing ability.
Kon (1983), Chang and Lewellen (1984), and Coggin et al. (1993) found that fund managers had
negative market-timing skills.
Tactical asset allocation applies market timing to a set of asset classes, rather than just equities
(versus bank deposits).Typically both stock (equity) and bond markets would be timed.Weigel
(1991) produced a model in which an investment manager with perfect market timing would
obtain a return, during a period, equal to:

R    e(Re  rf)  b(Rb  rf)  {max[(Re  rf), (Rb  rf), 0]}
(6)
where  indicates the extent to which market-timing skill is present.Weigel found that the group
of investment managers investigated showed a statistically signiﬁcant value of ,indicating that there
was some market-timing ability (albeit far from perfect market timing).However  was negative,
which suggests that the positive market timing was offset by negative performance in other aspects
of investment management.
Volkman (1999) investigated the ability of US mutual fund managers to select underpriced
securities, and to time the market, during the 1980s. It was found that, on average, there was no
apparent ability to identify underpriced shares (or other securities).Attempts to time the market
were found to have, on average, negative effects on performance. In a number of cases there
appeared to be a trade-off whereby the apparent ability to identify underpriced shares (and other
securities) was associated with a tendency to lose money through attempts to time the market.
Blake and Timmermann (2005) examined the performance of UK-based international-equity
pension funds over the period 1991–1997 by decomposing performance into stock selection and
market-timing elements.They found that both elements usually made negative contributions to
performance.The losses from poor stock selection were seen as possibly resulting from information
asymmetries between UK and overseas investment managers whereby investors have an
information advantage when investing in their own country. Correspondingly there is a relative
disadvantage when investing in a country other than one’s own.The negative effects of market
timing indicated that UK pension fund managers were not able to determine good asset allocations
between overseas stock markets in terms of enhancing returns.
HOLDINGS-BASED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Grinblatt and Titman (1993) developed a measure of investment management performance that
gives information about the quality of stock selection.By observing the changes in the composition
of a portfolio over time it may be possible to ascertain which stock selection decisions made
positive,or negative,contributions to performance.The performance measure is provided by the
equation:
Ht  	(Wjt Wjt1 ) Rjt
where Ht is the holdings-based measure of performance,Wjt is the portfolio weighting of asset
j at time t,Wjt1 is the weighting at time t  1,and Rjt is the return on asset j between dates t1
and t.
For each share or bond (j) the equation multiplies the return on that asset during a period,Rjt,
by the change in its portfolio weighting during that period,Wjt Wjt1.The results for all N assets
in the portfolio (j  1 to N) are added together in order to ascertain Ht.
EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF FUND MANAGERS
385

If the investment manager increases the weights of securities with positive returns, there
will be a positive contribution to Ht. If the manager decreases the weighting of assets that have
negative returns, there will be a positive contribution to Ht. Increasing the weights of assets with
relatively strong performance, whilst reducing the weightings of assets with relatively poor
performance,would result in a high value for Ht.The values of Ht over a number of successive time
periods could be averaged in order to obtain a measure of the stock selection ability of the
investment manager.
One advantage of this holdings-based measure is that it allows a detailed analysis of how each
investment decision contributes to overall performance. One disadvantage is that it detects only
the immediate effects of investment choices.If the weighting of a share is increased but the relative
outperformance of that share does not occur until a later period, the beneﬁcial effects of the
investment choice are not shown by this holdings-based measure.
PERSISTENCE OF PERFORMANCE
A fund shows persistence of performance if its relative performance is consistently good, or
consistently bad,from year to year.The market consists (in large part) of investment professionals
trying to outperform the market. Since in aggregate professionals are (most of) the market, their
attempts to outperform the market amounts to professionals attempting to outperform each other.
They cannot all be successful.The question arises as to whether any of them are persistently
successful, and whether any success is due to skill rather than to luck. Arguably if there is no
persistence of relative performance, there is no point in conducting portfolio performance
evaluation. If past performance is not a guide to future performance, knowing how well fund
managers have performed in the past is of no use for investment choice.
Studies of UK pension funds have been conducted by Brown et al. (1997); Blake et al. (1999),
and by Gregory and Tonks (2006). Overall their ﬁndings were that there was some persistence of
performance but that it was small and short-lived. In the United States, studies by Lakonishok et
al. (1992) and Malkiel (1995) on mutual funds found some evidence of persistence.However this
persistence did not apply to all periods and in some cases was susceptible to alternative
explanations.When looking at the strategy of using the most consistent outperformers from the
past in order to choose funds,Malkiel found that the strategy was not useful for long-term investing.
Malkiel suggested that most investors should buy low cost index tracker funds rather than try to
ﬁnd outperforming funds.
Kahn and Rudd (1995) found persistence of return for bond funds (but not equity funds).
However such persistence was outweighed by the average underperformance of bond funds
due to management and trading costs.A study of US mutual funds by Carhart (1997) found evidence
of persistence of relative performance over the four years following ranking.The problem with
such a time span is that it may take nearly four years to identify potential strong performers, by
which time the relatively strong performance may be waning (reminiscent of the Monty Python
sketch in which the expert says ‘it is too early to know but too late to do anything about it’).Gains
from knowledge of four-year outperformance may not offset the costs of moving from fund
to fund as the strong performers change. Rhodes (2000) in producing a report for the UK
Financial Services Authority based on both a review of existing literature and original research
concluded that:
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
386

The literature on the performance of UK funds has failed to ﬁnd evidence that information
on past investment performance can be used to good effect by retail investors in choosing
funds.The general pattern is one in which investment performance does not persist.
Small groups of funds may show some repeat performance over a short period of time,
particularly poorly performing funds. However the size of this effect and the fact that it
is only very short lived means that there is no investment strategy for retail investors that
could usefully be employed.The results from the US literature are similar.
The results concurred with the earlier analyses in ﬁnding that there was no persistency
in the performance of managed funds after 1987. There was evidence of repeat
performance before this point but it would be misleading to suggest that retail investors
could use this ﬁnding in the present day.
The weight of evidence is that information on past performance cannot be exploited
usefully by retail investors.
Some evidence of persistence in US mutual fund performance has been presented by Jan and Hung
(2004).They estimated fund alphas over three-year periods.The alphas were used to forecast
relative fund performance after a short lag and after a long lag (immediately after the end of a three-
year period, and two years after the end of a three-year period).They found that a positive short-
lag alpha was predictive of good relative performance, and that this effect was stronger when
combined with a long-lag positive alpha. Recent past winners had some tendency to be future
winners, and funds that were both recent and more distant past winners were the most likely to
be future winners.
Using Transition Matrices to Measure Persistence of Performance
Tables 17.4 and 17.5 illustrate transition matrices (Chapman 2006,based on research by the WM
Company).Table 17.4 relates to pension funds investing in UK equities (shares) and Table 17.5
relates to pension funds investing in European equities (exclusive of UK equities).The ﬁrst period
was 1997/99 and the second period was 2000/02.The left-hand column divides the funds into
quartiles based on ﬁrst period performance (the ﬁrst quartile is the top 25%,through to the fourth
quartile being the bottom 25%).Performance was measured by information ratios.The other four
columns show performance, in the second period, divided into quartiles. So, for example,Table
17.4 shows that of the top quartile performers from the ﬁrst period only one was in the top quartile

in the second period whereas 18 had dropped to the fourth quartile whilst 16 of the bottom
quartile performers from the ﬁrst period had risen to the ﬁrst quartile during the second period.
If there were persistence in performance,funds in the top quartile in the ﬁrst period would be
in the top quartile in the second period and funds in the bottom quartile in the ﬁrst period would
be in the bottom quartile in the second period.Tables 17.4 and 17.5 indicate that the opposite was
the case. For example in Table 17.4 of the 38 funds in the top quartile in the ﬁrst period, 31 were
in the lowest two quartiles in the second period. Of the 37 bottom quartile funds from the ﬁrst
period, 16 were in the top quartile in the second period. Rather than showing persistence in
performance, the tables indicate reversal. It is probably not a coincidence that the ﬁrst period
experienced a bull market whereas the second period covered a bear market.It appears that fund
performance tables are turned upside down when markets change direction (Chapman 2006).
CONCLUSION
There are various ways of judging the relative performance of an investment fund. A simple
approach is to compare its performance with that of similar funds.However this does not fully take
account of differences in risk between funds. Return is one dimension of portfolio performance,
and risk is another. When comparing funds some risk adjustment is necessary so that both
dimensions of performance are taken into account. If a fund achieves higher returns by incurring
more risk, it cannot unambiguously be said that the fund has superior performance.
Risk-adjusted measures of performance may aim to rank the performances of funds, possibly
including stock indices as hypothetical funds amongst the funds being ranked. It would be
informative to include index tracker funds, including trackers that use futures funds, among the
funds being ranked.Alternatively a benchmark rate of return for a portfolio may be derived from
a formula that takes account of the risk of the portfolio.
Portfolio performance evaluation also looks for the reasons for variations in performance.For
example attribution analysis seeks to ascertain whether outperformance, or underperformance,
arises from stock selection or asset allocation.

The results of empirical research suggest that, on average, institutional fund managers do not
persistently perform well.Not only do they (slightly) underperform stock indices,on average,but
there is little tendency for the strong performers in one period to be strong performers in
subsequent periods. For individual investors there seems to be little, if any, scope for successfully
picking prospective winners amongst institutional funds such as mutual funds and pension funds.
Some researchers have concluded that the best strategy for retail investors is to buy low cost index
tracker funds, on the grounds that if the future winners amongst actively managed funds cannot
be identiﬁed investors should avoid paying their high charges and avoid the risk that their chosen
funds turn out to be very poor performers.
However the chapters dealing with behavioural ﬁnance,in particular Chapters 2 and 24,indicate
that retail investors will continue to believe that they can identify prospective winners.The
psychological biases of overconﬁdence and illusion of control engender the belief that selection
can be successful.The representativeness bias will provide part of the explanation for the choices,
and the hindsight bias plus cognitive dissonance will convince the investors that they chose well.

Part 6
Investment Analysis


Chapter 18
The economic environment
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The relationship between economic cycles and stock market cycles.
2. The determinants of macroeconomic values, including interest rates.
3. The money supply transmission mechanism and its implications for share prices.
4. The importance of politics and demography for share prices.
5. Theories of exchange rate determination.
The difﬁculties of investment analysis are summarised by Coggan (2006):
The most obvious problem is the sheer amount of information that needs to be
analysed.When deciding to buy a particular share, investors need to assess the probity
of the management, the appeal of the group’s products, the threat from competitors in
the sector and the economic conditions before even beginning to calculate the
correct value of the shares, using a host of different measures. Not only do they need
to understand conditions now,but predict how they will develop over the next ﬁve years
or so.
But even a very well-informed investor can struggle.That is because predicting ﬁnancial
markets is not like predicting the weather, an area where, over the years, short-term
forecasting has improved because of better collection of data and sophisticated computer
models.
The key is that the weather does not change because of our forecasts.But a stock market
is made up of humans interacting; their perceptions (and the way they act upon them)
changes the conditions.
In the current text, the discussion of investment analysis begins with the economic
environment.
393

BUSINESS CYCLES AND STOCK MARKETS
There are periodic ﬂuctuations in economic activity.Economies move through cycles of expansion
and recession. Fluctuations in the level of economic activity are accompanied by ﬂuctuations in
corporate proﬁts,interest rates,inﬂation rates,and other economic variables.Stock market prices
also appear to have cycles,and those cycles are thought to be related to the cycles of the economy.
If there is some regularity to the business cycle (economic cycle), and if stock market cycles are
related to the business cycle, forecasting business cycles could be used as a means of forecasting
stock market movements.
It should be made clear that the present discussion is concerned with ﬂuctuations in the economy
rather than the long-term growth of the economy.The long-term growth could be seen as providing
a trend,and the ﬂuctuations (cycles) as deviations around that trend.Sometimes the economy will
be above the long-term trend, and sometimes below it. Somewhat surprisingly strong long-term
economic growth does not appear to be associated with strong long-term stock market
performance.For example Ritter (2005) investigated 16 countries over the 1900–2002 period and
found a negative relationship between national income growth per head and stock market returns.
However this has no bearing on the relationship between stock market cycles and economic cycles,
which is the concern of the present discussion.
Share prices depend upon prospective proﬁts and the dividends paid out of those proﬁts.An
important determinant of the proﬁtability of a company is the proﬁtability of the industry to which
it belongs.In turn the proﬁtability of the industry is strongly affected by the state of the economy.
It is easier for a ﬁrm to be proﬁtable when the economy is strong, and expenditure on goods and
services is growing rapidly, than when growth is weak.
Fluctuations in stock markets will be affected by ﬂuctuations in economic activity.Stock market
cycles are related to economic cycles (alternatively known as business cycles).However industries
are affected to differing extents. Some industries such as food and pharmaceuticals barely have
cycles since they produce necessities that are little inﬂuenced by consumer incomes. Other
industries such as consumer durables (e.g. cars) and capital goods (e.g. industrial machinery) are
heavily affected by business cycles.
Industries that are relatively unaffected by economic ﬂuctuations are referred to as defensive
in stock market terms.The shares tend to have low betas. Industries that are heavily affected by
business cycles are referred to as cyclical.The shares have high betas.
One factor that affects sensitivity to the business cycle is the inﬂuence of economic activity
on sales. In some industries consumers cannot easily reduce or delay purchases when actual
or prospective income falls; examples are food, pharmaceuticals, and water. In other industries
reduction or delay is easier. For example the replacement of a car could be delayed until income
prospects improve.
Two other signiﬁcant factors that affect sensitivity to business cycles are operational and
ﬁnancial leverage. Operational leverage is the extent to which the company has ﬁxed costs.
Fixed costs cannot be reduced when demand for a ﬁrm’s products falls. Since costs cannot
be reduced in line with revenues, proﬁts fall more than proportionately to a decline in sales.
This tendency is strengthened if the ﬁrm has ﬁnancial leverage. Financial leverage is the use
of borrowing for obtaining ﬁnance. Interest on debt must be paid irrespective of the level
of sales.
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
394

Suppose a ﬁrm has ﬁxed costs of £2 million per year, sells its products at £5 each and incurs
variable costs of £1 per unit of output. Sales of 1 million units provide a proﬁt of £2 million
(sales revenue of £5 million minus costs of £3 million). Sales of 0.5 million provides zero proﬁt
(sales revenue of £2.5 million minus costs of £2.5 million).A 50% fall in sales completely removes
the proﬁt.
Suppose that the ﬁrm also has debt ﬁnancing (interest) costs of £1 million per year. Sales of
1 million units provide a proﬁt of £1 million (sales revenue of £5 million minus costs of £3 million
minus interest of £1 million).A fall in sales to 0.75 million would eliminate proﬁts (sales revenue
of £3.75 million minus costs of £2.75 million minus interest of £1 million).A 25% fall in sales
completely removes the proﬁt.
Arguably the ﬁrst stage in investment analysis is to forecast movements in the economy
as a whole.This will affect both the extent of one’s investment in shares, and the particular
shares chosen.
However forecasts need to be not only accurate, but also early.An accurate forecast, which is
made after other analysts have reached the same conclusion and acted upon it, is unlikely to lead
to proﬁts.The trades of the early investors would tend to move prices so as to remove proﬁt
opportunities for those that act later. Forecasts may suggest share price increases would provide
proﬁts for those who buy before prices rise, but the purchases would push up prices and thereby
remove further proﬁt opportunities. Investors who are late with their investment decisions will
tend to miss opportunities to make proﬁts.
DeStefano (2004) found that stock markets rose during the early stages of economic expansion
but that the stock price rises fell towards zero as the expansionary phase of the business cycle
approached its end. Stock markets cease to rise while the economy is still growing; the stock
market peaks before the economy peaks. During the early stages of economic contraction
(recession) the stock market tends to fall, but in the later stages of the contraction stock markets
rise strongly.The stock market rises while the economy is still contracting, so the stock market
reaches its lowest point before the economy does.As a crude approximation it might be said that
stock markets rise when the rate of economic growth is rising (becoming more positive or less
negative) and stock markets fall when the rate of economic growth falls (becoming less positive
or more negative).DeStefano suggested that changes in expectations about future company proﬁts
largely explained the stock market cycle.
Moore and Cullity (1988) have established an average sequence of business cycle and ﬁnancial
market leads and lags in the United States for the period 1920–82 as follows:
Stock price peak to business cycle peak
7 months
Stock price trough to business cycle trough
5 months
Siegel (1991,1998,2001) has examined US data for the period 1802–1997.He too has found
a tendency for stock market turning points to precede turning points in economic activity.
His analysis suggests an average lag between stock market peaks and peaks in economic activity of
5.6 months,with a standard deviation of 4.4 months.However,particularly since 1945,there have
been a number of stock market falls that were not followed by economic downturns. He found
that the average lag between stock market troughs and troughs in economic activity was 5.1 months
with a standard deviation of 1.73 months. Not only was there a smaller variation in the length of
THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
395

the lag between stock market and economic upturns (than in the case of downturns) but also stock
market upturns were more reliable indicators of economic upturns.
The ability to forecast upturns was more proﬁtable than the ability to forecast downturns.The
average percentage rise in stock prices between stock market and economic troughs was 23.86%
whereas the average fall between the peaks was 6.49%. Siegel found that the best timing was to
switch out of stocks four months before peaks in economic activity and into stocks four months
before the troughs.
There are a number of causal factors that help to explain the pattern of observed cycles. In
particular, interest rates tend to follow corresponding cycles.When the economy is in recession,
interest rates tend to be low. If economic activity is low, there is reduced demand for loans and
low demand to borrow is associated with low interest rates.Recession also leads to central banks,
such as the Bank of England, reducing interest rates. Interest rates are reduced by central banks
because low economic activity tends to entail low inﬂation. If inﬂation falls below target, the
central bank will lower interest rates. Conversely during periods of economic expansion interest
rates tend to be relatively high.
One problem with using business cycle anticipation as an investment timing strategy is
the variability of the lags between stock market and economic peaks and troughs.The seven-
month and ﬁve-month lags mentioned above are averages, and there is a wide dispersion
around the averages. In consequence there is considerable uncertainty concerning the length
of the lags.As indicated above,Siegel also found considerable variation in lags,especially between
the peaks.
Since stock prices lead the economy,what investors need are factors that lead both stock markets
and the economy.There is a need for indicators that lead the stock market and hence provide a
means of forecasting the stock market. One possibility is that stock price movements in some
industries might precede general stock price movements.Hong et al. (2007) found that movements
in the stock prices of mining and metals companies preceded general stock market movements
by about two months.
Zweig (1986) used a combination of monetary and momentum indicators to forecast the
direction of US stock markets.The method gave good results for the period between the early 1950s
and mid-1980s. However Vergin (1996) found that over the period 1984–95 the method failed
to be useful.
A study by Boehm and Moore (1991) attempted to allocate between stocks,bills,and bonds in
ﬁve countries by using leading indicators.The results did not suggest a consistently useful means
of forecasting stock market movements.
Siegel (1991, 1998, 2001) has cited numerous examples of failures by market professionals in
their attempts to forecast turning points in economic activity.Despite the huge potential rewards
from successful forecasting, and the substantial sums spent on economic forecasting, the general
result of forecasting efforts has been one of failure.
Fama and French (1989) examined the periods 1927–87 and 1941–87 for the United States.
They found that both the dividend yield on stocks and the default spread (the difference in yield
between corporate and government bonds) were related to returns (and prices) of both stocks and
bonds.The dividend yield and default spread were highly correlated.The signiﬁcance of dividend
yield and default spread increased from high-grade to low-grade bonds and from bonds to stocks.
This is consistent with dividend yield and default spread being indicative of risk premiums.
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
396

When the dividend yield and the default spread are high, investors are requiring a high return
from their investments.This occurs when the economic environment is poor. Investors perceive
a higher risk from investing in such periods.This suggests a time-varying-risk explanation of market
swings. Adverse economic conditions provide more risk, and in consequence investors require
higher returns to compensate for the increased risk.The increase in investment yield entails a fall
in stock and bond prices so that dividends and coupons represent higher percentage returns on
investments.
Further studies (Fama 1990; Lovatt and Parikh 2000) found that market returns could be
predicted by the dividend yield, the default spread, and the term spread (the latter being the
difference between yields on short maturity and long maturity bonds).The studies found all three
to be positively related to expected (required) rates of return.The default and term spreads were
seen as having a business cycle pattern; so the associations between those spreads and required
returns provided evidence for an association between the business cycle and required returns.
Since required returns have an inverse relationship with stock market prices, the evidence is
consistent with a relationship between the business cycle and stock market prices (returns).
It is not only the level of real economic activity that inﬂuences stock market prices. Inﬂation
also has an impact.Ibbotson and Brinson (1993) and Boudoukh and Richardson (1993) have found
that high inﬂation (above 4% p.a.) adversely affects stock market prices. Flannery and
Protopapadakis (2002) found that announcements about changes in inﬂation rates affected stock
markets.Higher-than-expected inﬂation rates were found to depress stock markets (vice versa for
lower-than-expected inﬂation rates).They found that announcements of higher-than-expected
money supply growth also negatively affected stock markets (conversely for lower-than-expected).
It may be the case that announcements of higher-than-expected rates of inﬂation or monetary
expansion dampen stock markets by raising the fear of interest rate increases.Bernanke and Kuttner
(2005) found that when interest rate changes by the US Federal Reserve were separated into
expected and unexpected components, the unexpected component had a signiﬁcant inverse
relationship to stock market prices.They also found that reversals in the direction of change of
interest rates resulted in extreme stock market reactions.For example a fall in interest rates,which
follows a series of rises, brings about a sharp rise in share prices.
Social mood has been proposed as an explanation for the tendency for stock market move-
ments to lead movements in the economy (Prechter 1999; Nofsinger 2005). Social mood is
related to the general level of optimism or pessimism within society. Such positive or negative
feelings are transmitted between people with the result that there is a widely shared emotional
state. It is not limited to ﬁnancial and economic aspects of people’s lives, but those aspects are
affected.
The responses of ﬁnancial markets to changes in social mood are much faster than the responses
of other markets. Jansen and Nahius (2003), in a study of 11 European countries, found that the
stock market and consumer conﬁdence moved simultaneously rather than with a lag.This is
consistent with both being responses to changes in social mood. The response of consumer
conﬁdence,and business conﬁdence,to change in social mood takes time to have an impact on the
economy. Increased stock market investment can be carried out almost instantly whereas
expenditures,particularly business spending,can take time to plan and execute.So stock markets
respond faster to a change in social mood than the rest of the economy, and hence stock markets
lead the business cycle.
THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
397

Increases in consumer and business spending may be ﬁnanced largely by borrowing. Since
borrowing from the banking system increases the money supply, another consequence of an
improvement in social mood would be monetary expansion.Conversely,declining social mood is
characterised by a falling stock market and subsequent reductions in expenditure and money
creation.
Saving Ratios and the Economy
Money for investment is generated by saving. If people save more, there is more money available
to be invested. In the UK the saving ratio, the proportion of disposable income that people save,
has been very variable.For example during the 1990s it varied between 11.6% in 1992 and 4.9%
in 1999 (Halifax Financial Services 2005).
It has been suggested that the household saving ratio is related to macroeconomics (see, for
example, Rutterford 2007). One observation is that the saving ratio tends to be higher when
inﬂation is high, possibly because people save more in order to offset the erosion in the real value
of their existing savings caused by rising prices.There also appears to be a relationship between
house prices and saving.The saving ratio appears to fall when house prices are rising rapidly.This
could be due to a wealth effect whereby rising house prices make people feel richer, and hence
causes them to feel that they do not have to save much. Also many people borrow against the
increased value of their homes, and spending borrowed money is negative saving.
There appears to be a relationship between economic growth rates and saving ratios.When the
economy is growing rapidly, and unemployment is low, saving tends to be low. During periods of
low growth or recession saving ratios are higher.This has been explained in terms of high growth
causing high consumer conﬁdence and a perceived reduced need to save.An alternative explanation
of the relationship is that high saving is accompanied by reduced consumer spending,which slows
economic growth.This may help to explain why stock markets tend to fall when inﬂation rises;
higher inﬂation causes higher saving and lower spending. Another worrying feature of higher
inﬂation, for stock markets, is that it tends to be associated with higher interest rates.
AN OVERVIEW OF MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS
IS-LM Analysis
Macroeconomists frequently employ an IS-LM framework to analyse aggregate demand in the
economy.This framework is illustrated by Figure 18.1.
The IS curve reﬂects expenditure on goods and services and slopes downwards on the grounds
that expenditure,particularly investment in plant and equipment,increases as the cost of borrowing
to ﬁnance that expenditure declines. Changes in expenditure (demand) arising from factors such
as increased government spending or higher exports (i.e. increases unrelated to interest rate
or national income changes) will shift the IS curve to the right.This is illustrated in Figure 18.1
by the shift from IS1 to IS2. It can be seen that the result is an increase in aggregate demand and in
interest rates.Autonomous reductions in expenditure would have the opposite effects.
The LM curve reﬂects conditions in the money markets. It is based on the view that increased
economic activity is associated with rising interest rates.If the central bank (e.g.Bank of England,
European Central Bank, or US Federal Reserve) increases the money supply the LM curve will
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
398

shift to the right.This is illustrated as a shift from LM1 to LM2 in Figure 18.2.The shift is associated
with a lower interest rate and higher level of demand in the economy.In terms of monetary policy
higher money supply and lower interest rates tend to be two sides of the same coin. Irrespective
of whether the money supply change causes the interest rate change, or vice versa, the two tend
to be linked.The opposite, a tightening of monetary policy, would be shown as a leftward shift of
the LM curve.
From the perspective of stock, bond, and property markets (i.e. asset markets) the money
supply and interest rates have a direct bearing. Increased money supply and lower interest rates
tend to be supportive of asset price increases.A higher money supply means that there is more cash
available for investment in shares,bonds,and property.Lower interest rates render the alternative

of keeping money in bank (or building society) deposits less attractive, and make borrowing to
invest less costly.
Aggregate Demand and Supply
The IS-LM framework is commonly used as the basis for analysing the determination of aggregate
demand (expenditure) in the economy. However, economic analysis requires that supply is also
taken into account. Figure 18.3 illustrates aggregate demand and supply schedules.
D1 and D2 are aggregate demand curves derived from IS-LM analysis. One reason for the
downward slope is the reduction in the real money supply,and hence leftward shift of the LM curve,
resulting from an increase in the general price level.The intersection of the aggregate demand and
supply curves is shown as determining the general price level and national income.The vertical
section of the aggregate supply curve depicts full employment, which puts an upper limit on
national income.The rightward shift of the aggregate demand curve from D1 to D2 may result from
expansionary economic policy (e.g.higher government spending and/or an increase in the money
supply) and in this case can be seen to restore full employment at the cost of an increase in the
general level of prices.
Inﬂation and the Phillips Curve
The rise in the general price level as full employment is achieved is unlikely to be a one-off increase.
It is more likely to be a persistent tendency towards inﬂation.This can be explained with the help
of Figure 18.4, which depicts an expectations-augmented Phillips curve.
The Phillips curve shows the relationship between unemployment and the rate at which wages
rise (i.e.wage inﬂation).The basic relationship is one in which lower unemployment is associated
with a higher rate of wage inﬂation.The rate of wage inﬂation is affected not only by the level of
unemployment but also by expectations of price inﬂation.Wage demands are seen as incorporating
compensation for expected price inﬂation. Expected price inﬂation shifts the Phillips curve

upwards, for example from PC1 to PC2 in Figure 18.4. PC1 is the Phillips curve without
expectations of price inﬂation and PC2 is the Phillips curve inclusive of expected price inﬂation
of E(I).The Phillips curve rises by the amount of the expected inﬂation.
It is widely believed that the trade-off between unemployment and wage inﬂation is not
permanent and that in time unemployment returns to a natural rate. The natural rate of
unemployment (alternatively known as the non-accelerating inﬂation rate of unemployment) is
the rate corresponding to equality of demand and supply in the labour market, and at which the
unemployed are in the process of moving between jobs rather than being permanently unemployed.
Expectations of inﬂation have implications for interest rates.The nominal interest rate is the real
interest plus an addition to compensate for inﬂation. For example, if 3% inﬂation is expected a
3% interest rate would be required merely to compensate for rising prices.That 3% would be added
to the rate of interest that would otherwise be paid (the real rate of interest).Thus:
rn  rr  E(I)
where rn is the nominal interest rate,rr is the real interest rate,and E(I) is the expected rate of
inﬂation.
If there were uncertainty about the rate of inﬂation,a risk premium may be required.If inﬂation
were expected to be 3% p.a. but could range between 0% and 6%, investors may require a risk
premium to compensate for the possibility of a high inﬂation rate since a high inﬂation rate would
seriously reduce the real rate of interest received.The uncertainty about the rate of inﬂation is
referred to as inﬂation risk.Thus:
rn  rr  E(I)  RP

where RP is the risk premium (Pilbeam 2005).To the extent that higher inﬂation carries higher
inﬂation risk,and hence a higher risk premium,this may help to explain why stock markets often
fall when inﬂation unexpectedly rises.
Interest Rates
A macroeconomic variable that is particularly important from the perspective of investment
analysis is the rate of interest. In reality there are many different interest rates at any one time
(depending upon the maturity and risk of the investment) but it is convenient to summarise them
into a single rate for the purpose of analysing the factors that determine interest rates.
Two approaches to explaining interest rates entail (1) the demand and supply of loanable
funds, and (2) the demand and supply of money. Figure 18.5 shows the demand and supply of
loanable funds.
The demand for loanable funds (DD) comes from businesses wanting to ﬁnance investment,
governments funding budget deﬁcits, and individuals ﬁnancing expenditure (e.g. purchasing
housing).The supply of loanable funds (SS) comes from the savings of individuals and businesses,
and government budget surpluses.A change in the money supply by a central bank (e.g. Bank of
England, European Central Bank) would also affect the supply of loanable funds.
Figure 18.5 depicts a rightward shift of the supply curve, for example due to an increase in
savings by individuals or an increase in the money supply by a central bank. It can be seen that the
result is a decline in the interest rate from I1 to I2 and an increase in lending from L1 to L2.
Factors that lie behind the loanable funds approach can be broken down into the productivity
of capital and the time preferences of people. Capital includes land, buildings, machinery,
vehicles, software, knowledge, and anything else whose purchase can increase the potential to
produce goods and services.The productivity of capital can be expressed as a percentage per
year, referred to as the rate of return on capital. This return on capital is the source of the
dividends, coupons, and interest paid on shares, bonds, and loans. It is largely the expected rate
of return on capital that determines the position of the demand curve for loanable funds.A high

productivity of capital causes the demand curve to be high, with a high interest rate at each level
of borrowing.
A factor that determines the position of the supply curve of loanable funds is the time preference
of people. Generally people require some compensation for delaying consumption. If they are to
save in the present with a view to spending in the future, the prospective future spending should
exceed the current spending foregone.The achievement of this excess of future value over current
value requires a rate of interest on the saving.An increased level of saving requires an increased
interest rate.
For the demand to come together with the supply to determine the rate of interest by their
interaction requires that the interest rate (rate of return) of the demand curve is compatible with
that of the supply curve. In particular the supply curve may be based on risk-free interest rates
(i.e. known for certain) whereas the productivity of capital is very uncertain. A risk premium
should be subtracted from the productivity of capital in order to provide the risk-free component
of return.It is the risk-free component that is compatible with the interest rate of the supply curve.
The risk premium to be subtracted depends upon the degree of uncertainty surrounding the
productivity of capital, and upon the degree of distaste for uncertainty (risk-aversion) exhibited
by the people who supply the loanable funds.
Another way of looking at the determination of interest rates is in terms of the demand and
supply of money.It should be borne in mind that notes and coin constitute only a small portion of
the money supply. Most money is in the form of bank deposits. Figure 18.6 illustrates this view
of interest rate determination.
It can be seen that an increase in the money supply by a central bank from M1 to M2 will reduce
the interest rate from I1 to I2.This is consistent with the prediction from the loanable funds model.
The process whereby an increase in the money supply becomes associated with a fall in the
interest rate can be looked upon from different perspectives. One process entails open market
operations. Open market operations involve the central bank buying or selling government
securities such as bonds and Treasury bills.The purchases,by the central bank,put money into the

hands of the sellers and thereby increase the money supply (the money would be newly created
by the central bank). Simultaneously the purchase of bonds and bills would push up their prices
and thereby lower their yields.The higher money supply is associated with lower yields, on bills
and bonds, and hence lower interest rates.
There is a chain of causation that runs from the interest rate to the money supply. Bank credit
is a form of money.When someone borrows from a bank newly created money is added to their
bank balance. To the extent that lower interest rates cause increased borrowing they will
simultaneously generate an expansion of the money supply.
By announcing a base rate, or repo rate, the central bank (e.g. the Bank of England) signals to
the money markets the level of interest rates that it would like to see.Money market interest rates
then move to the desired levels with the assistance of open market operations by the central bank.
The announcement of a new interest rate may be enough without the need for signiﬁcant open
market operations. For example if an interest rate fall is announced traders will realise that this
implies a rise in Treasury bill prices.In anticipation of a rise in prices traders will buy Treasury bills,
thereby causing the price rise.The higher price of Treasury bills reduces their rate of yield into line
with the newly announced interest rate.There is a transfer of funds from Treasury bills to other
money market investments in search of higher rates of yield.The increased supply of funds into
those other investments lowers their rates of interest.In this way an announcement by the central
bank of a change in interest rates moves interest rates in the money markets to the desired level,
with little need for further action by the central bank.
Central banks and the money market forces of demand and supply can both play a part in the
determination of interest rates.For example during the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007 interest
rates in the London inter-bank market rose by more than 1 percentage point as a result of a reduced
supply of loans rather than in consequence of Bank of England action.The relative importance of
central bank decisions and money market forces could vary over time. Many take the view that
short-term interest rates are normally determined by the central bank rather than by the forces
of supply and demand (Pepper and Oliver 2006). If the interest rate does not move to bring the
demand for, and supply of, money into equality some other mechanism must be present. Surplus
money may be used to buy goods and services, or to buy investment assets such as shares, bonds,
and property.An excess demand for money (insufﬁcient supply) could be remedied by reduced
expenditure or the sale of investments.The process of adjusting to a discrepancy between demand
and supply of money is known as the money supply transmission mechanism.
STOCK MARKETS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY
TRANSMISSION MECHANISM
The chain of causation that runs from money supply changes to interest rate changes,and thereby
to the demand for goods and services, has been referred to as the Keynesian transmission
mechanism. An alternative view of the transmission mechanism, referred to as the monetarist
transmission mechanism,entails the money supply having a direct effect on the demand for goods
and services as well as operating through interest rates.From the perspective of investment analysis,
the monetarist transmission mechanism seems to suggest that increases in the money supply would
have a direct impact on stock markets.An increase in the money supply is associated with increased
expenditure on goods and services, and on all forms of investment.This effect of money supply
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
404

changes on investment markets is probably also consistent with Keynesian theory (Leijonhufvud
1968; Redhead 1981).
The transmission mechanism of how money supply changes are transmitted to the real economy
(the economy of goods, services, and workers) is an issue that has concerned macroeconomists.
The early Keynesian view was that money supply changes operated through interest rate
movements. An increase in the money supply was seen as lowering interest rates and thereby
increasing borrowing for the purpose of ﬁnancing investment in productive capacity. This
investment in goods and services increased the incomes of the producers of investment goods,who
increased their expenditure as a result thereby providing another round of increased incomes.
This process leads to a multiple increase in incomes and expenditure.The monetarist transmission
mechanism accepted this effect via interest rates, but added that there would be a direct effect.
An increase in the money supply would directly cause an increase in expenditure on goods and
services (both investment and consumer) as people sought to exchange their additional holdings
of money for goods and services.
These transmission mechanisms did not always explicitly allow for effects that operated via
shares. Leijonhufvud in his reinterpretation of Keynes’s general theory broadened the Keynesian
transmission mechanism (Leijonhufvud 1968;Redhead 1981).More recently,and more explicitly,
Pepper and Oliver (2006) have proposed a liquidity theory of asset prices.According to this theory,
changes in the money supply are a major driver of share prices.An increase in the money supply,
relative to the demand for money, causes an increase in expenditure on shares as people attempt
to reduce their surplus holdings of money. In this way an increase in the money supply can cause
an increase in share prices. So the transmission mechanism is broadened such that an increase in
the supply of money has impacts on the real economy via interest rates, share prices, and direct
expenditure on goods and services.
Congdon (2006) has also proposed a transmission mechanism that includes changes in share
prices. He demonstrated that institutional investors (life assurance and pensions) have a fairly
stable demand for liquidity in the sense of the ratio of liquid assets to other assets.If the institutional
investors experience a change in liquidity that moves the liquidity ratio away from the desired
level,they will attempt to restore the desired ratio.Money is a component of liquidity.An increase
in the money supply could disturb the liquidity ratio of institutional investors.The institutions
attempt to restore their liquidity ratios to the desired values by spending the surplus liquidity on
assets such as shares and bonds.This would drive up share and bond prices. So long as the holding
of liquidity exceeds the desired amount,investment spending will continue.To the extent that each
institution’s expenditure is another institution’s receipt of money,the attempt by each institution
to reduce its holding of liquidity does not reduce the aggregate holding of liquidity by institutions.
Some of the additional money will be lost to the institutions, for example to individual
shareholders who sell to institutions,but much will remain with the institutions.The desired ratio
of liquidity to other assets is restored by a rise in share and bond prices.Suppose that institutional
investors,in aggregate,hold £1,000 billion of shares and bonds.Also suppose that,on average,the
institutions desire to hold liquid assets equal to 4% of non-liquid assets.Together they require
£40 billion of liquid assets to match the share and bond holdings.
Suppose that the central bank (Bank of England) buys government bonds from the institutions.
The money used to pay for the bonds adds to the liquidity of the institutions. If they receive
additional money of £30 billion, they would have a liquid assets ratio of about 7%. In aggregate
THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
405

they would not rid themselves of the entire surplus of £30 billion,since the institutions would tend
to pass the money between themselves as shares and bonds are bought from each other. Some of
the money, say £10 million, would be lost to the institutions.This would reduce the aggregate
holding of liquidity to 6% of the original value of shares and bonds.The institutions would still have
£60 billion of liquid assets.
The desired ratio of liquid assets to share and bond holdings is restored by a rise in share and
bond prices.Prices would rise until the desired ratio is restored.So long as the actual ratio exceeds
the desired ratio, spending on shares and bonds would continue, as would the resulting rise in
prices. Prices would rise until the total value of shares and bonds reached £1,500 billion.
The liquidity ratio of 4% would then have been restored (£60 billion of liquid assets against £1,500
billion of shares and bonds).An initial £30 billion increase in the money held by the institutions
leads to a £500 billion increase in the aggregate value of shares and bonds held by the institutions.
This £500 billion increase results from an average rise in asset prices of about 50%. Conversely,
an initial reduction in liquidity would generate falling prices.
The empirical evidence of the effects of money supply changes on stock market prices seems
generally to indicate that money supply movements affect share prices,with money supply increases
appearing to cause share price rises (Dhakal et al. 1993;Hashemazadeh and Taylor 1988;Mookerjee
1987). However not all studies have found such a causal relationship (Singh 1993).
Congdon (2005) criticised macroeconomists,and macroeconomics texts,for ignoring the role
of share prices (and property prices) in the transmission mechanism. He illustrated the potential
power of the role of share prices in the transmission mechanism by describing three recent episodes
in UK ﬁnancial history.The early 1970s,mid-1980s,and late 1990s were all characterised by rapid
money supply growth accompanied by sharp share price rises. In these cases the money supply
growth was particularly marked in the ﬁnancial sector.There appeared to be a strong relationship
between growth in the money holdings of institutional investors (particularly life assurance
companies and pension funds) and rises in share prices as measured by stock indices.
Giuliodori (2005) found that the housing market formed part of the monetary transmission
mechanism. It was found that house prices were signiﬁcantly affected by interest rate changes.
In particular house price movements may enhance the effects of interest rate changes on consumer
expenditure in countries where housing and mortgage markets are relatively developed and
competitive.
POLITICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC EFFECTS ON SHARE PRICES
The discussion of the liquidity theory of asset prices highlights the point that share prices are
determined by the forces of demand and supply.Prices rise when there are net purchases of shares
and fall when there are net sales.
Political and demographic developments can impact on the demand for shares.There is a
worldwide trend to shift the emphasis from state provision of pensions to private provision.This
arises from an ageing population and the tax implications of maintaining generous state pensions.
Private pension schemes are largely invested on stock markets. So an increase in the amount of
investment in private pensions leads to expenditure on shares and a consequent rise in share prices.
This trend is likely to be strengthened by the ‘baby-boomer’ generation. During the period
1945 to 1963 there was an exceptionally high birth rate in Western Europe and North America.
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
406

The resulting population bulge (the baby-boomers) is now approaching retirement. It might be
expected that they will increase their saving, and hence stock market investment, as the need to
fund their retirement becomes increasingly apparent.This suggests rising share prices brought
about by the increased demand for shares.
There are aspects of the details of government policy towards private pension provision that
will have an effect on the demand for shares.For example the introduction of a system of additional
voluntary contributions by the UK government will have added to the demand for shares,as would
the removal of restrictive limits to pension fund contributions in 2006.
Mosebach and Najand (1999) presented evidence consistent with the life-cycle investment
hypothesis, which suggests that the demand for shares rises as the average age of the population
increases.Their ﬁndings indicated that,in the United States,investing for retirement had produced
a relatively stable inﬂow of funds to the stock market.Their research also found that net inﬂows
of funds to the stock market led to stock price rises.
There are some factors that may be acting to reduce the demand for shares.The switch by some
pension funds away from shares and towards bonds would have dampened the demand for shares,
and resulted in sales of shares.The fall in popularity of endowment mortgages would have had a
similar effect. Endowment policies add to the demand for shares, and their decline reduces this
effect. Furthermore as endowment policies mature they are encashed with the result that shares
are sold.
Both pension fund switches from shares to bonds and the decline in the popularity of endowment
mortgages were largely caused by poor stock market performance during the period 2000–3.
A vicious circle emerged.Falling share prices led to these effects on pension funds and endowment
policies, and these effects in turn put further downward pressure on share prices.
EXCHANGE RATES
When investing overseas, exchange rate movements can make substantial differences to returns.
An overseas investment is simultaneously an investment in a foreign stock (or bond) market, and
an investment in a foreign currency. Strong positive returns on the foreign stock market can be
turned into losses if the value of the foreign currency (relative to the investor’s home currency)
experiences a substantial fall. Conversely appreciation of the foreign currency, relative to the
investor’s home currency, can turn an investment loss into a proﬁt.The analysis of overseas
investments involves an analysis of currency exchange rates.
The economic analysis of exchange rates can involve analysis of:
1.
The balance of payments.
2.
Purchasing power parity.
3.
Monetary policy.
4.
International portfolio balance.
These four factors have strong interrelationships.One common factor appears to be that they are
much more useful for predicting long-term (horizons of several years) than short-term (horizons
of days, weeks, or months) currency movements.
The analysis of exchange rate movements from the perspective of the balance of payments
is premised on the view that exchange rates (the prices of currencies in terms of one another)
THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
407

are determined by the forces of demand and supply.If the demand for a currency increases,its price
in terms of other currencies will rise. If the supply of a currency increases, its price will fall.The
balance of payments on current account is the balance between exports and imports of goods and
services. Exports entail demand for the home currency since foreign buyers will need the home
currency to pay for their purchases.Imports entail supply of the home currency;the home currency
would be sold for the purpose of buying the foreign currencies required for the purchase of the
imports.An excess of exports over imports suggests that demand for the home currency is greater
than the supply with the effect that its price rises in terms of other currencies.An excess of imports
over exports suggests an excess supply and a fall in price.So if the balance of payments on current
account is in surplus (exports greater than imports) the home currency should appreciate in value,
whereas if the balance is in deﬁcit (imports greater than exports) the home currency should
depreciate in terms of other currencies.
The balance of payments on current account is not the whole balance of payments.There is
also the balance of payments on capital account.The balance of payments on capital account is the
balance of investment ﬂows into, and out of, a country. It is the aggregate of the balance of
payments on current account and the balance of payments on capital account that provides the
demand/supply relationship for a currency. For example the huge US current account deﬁcits of
recent years (and decades) have been balanced by net inﬂows on capital account as the residents of
other countries (particularly Japan) have invested heavily in US government bonds. Arguably
the balance of payments on current account is more permanent than the balance on capital
account, which could change very quickly if investors’ preferences change. So countries with
persistent current account deﬁcits, such as the UK and the United States, are vulnerable to sharp
falls in their currencies if international investment ﬂows cease to support their currencies.
Conversely surplus countries and regions, such as Japan and the Eurozone, are vulnerable to
currency appreciations.
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) relates to relative prices between countries.The theory comes
in two forms:absolute PPP and relative PPP.According to absolute PPP,tradable goods should cost
the same in every country after adjusting for exchange rates.According to relative PPP,exchange
rate movements should parallel differences in inﬂation rates.So,for example,according to relative
PPP,if the UK has an inﬂation rate 1% p.a.higher than in the Eurozone then the pound should fall
by 1% p.a. against the Euro. Froot and Rogoff (1995) estimated that, when disturbed, relative
PPP takes an average of eight years to become re-established.
This view is closely related to a monetary policy analysis of exchange rates,according to which
exchange rate movements should reﬂect relative rates of money supply growth. If the UK has a
rate of money supply growth that is 1% more than in the Eurozone,the pound would be expected
to fall at 1% p.a. against the Euro.This is related to the view that there is a close relationship
between money supply growth and inﬂation.
Another possible link between monetary policy and exchange rates operates through interest
rates. A rise in interest rates on a currency renders that currency more attractive, and hence
increases demand for it. In this way higher interest rates on a currency are likely to be associated
with an increase in the price of that currency in terms of other currencies.This is consistent with
the portfolio balance approach to explaining exchange rate movements.According to this view
exchange rate movements occur as a result of international investors adjusting the distribution
of their portfolios between currencies.
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

CONCLUSION
Stock markets do not exist in isolation from the economies and societies in which they operate.
Changes in the economy affect the factors that inﬂuence share prices, such as proﬁts, company
growth prospects, and interest rates. Changes in society also have impacts.As the average age of
a population increases, the ability of the state to provide good pensions declines. It becomes
increasingly important for people to make their own provision for retirement.This is typically
carried out through the medium of institutional investments, especially pension funds.
One particular economic variable, highlighted by some economists, is change in the money
supply.Economists have long observed that money supply growth impacts on the prices of assets,
such as shares,bonds,and property;a portion of the extra money is spent on such assets.Changes
in the money holdings of institutional investors may be particularly signiﬁcant,particularly if they
have preferences in relation to the proportion of their funds to be held in cash.An increase in the
money supply that leaves institutional investors with more money than they want to hold is likely
to result in share (and bond) price rises as the institutions spend their surplus cash on such
investment assets.The resulting rise in asset prices could be an important part of the mechanism
that restores the desired ratio of cash to other assets.
Exchange rates are important for investments,particularly international investments.A strong
performance from a foreign stock market can be negated by weakness in that country’s currency.
This exchange rate risk can be dealt with, particularly by large investors such as institutional
investors, by the use of derivatives. Currency derivatives can be used to hedge exchange rate risk
(see Chapter 39 on currency forwards,futures,swaps,and options).Stock index and bond futures
can be used to structure futures funds with low exchange rate risk (see Part 8 on stock index
futures and Chapter 43 on bond futures). Futures funds using futures on foreign stock indices
effectively create index tracker funds based on those foreign stock markets.
Not only does the economic environment have signiﬁcance, but also the social environment is
important to stock (and other asset) markets.Attitudes towards saving and investing are crucial
for stock market behaviour. Levels of saving, and hence investing, are greatly inﬂuenced by the
attitudes prevalent in society. For example if there were social pressure towards conspicuous
consumption,the result would be more spending and hence less saving.With less money being spent
on investments, the growth in asset prices would be reduced. Conversely high levels of spending
on goods and services could be beneﬁcial for company proﬁts,and thereby beneﬁcial for dividends
and share prices.If investing becomes a subject of general interest,and successful investing a source
of social status, the result could be enhanced levels of investment and consequent asset price
increases.
Chapter 27 on stock market bubbles and crashes discusses how the spread of ideas in society
can have consequences for stock market behaviour. People are greatly inﬂuenced by social
pressures, which can result in the spread of ideas.These include ideas concerning investments.
Investors can show herding behaviour,in which common beliefs lead to common actions resulting
in stock market bubbles and crashes.

Dividend discount models
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Discounting future cash ﬂows to obtain a present value.
2. The use of dividend discount models to obtain the fair prices of shares.
3. Variations on the dividend discount model, such as the Gordon growth model, stochastic
dividend discount models, and multi-period models.
4. The estimation of the growth rate of dividends.
5. The effects of investment opportunities on share prices.
6. Problems with the use of dividend discount models.
Investment analysts need to produce estimates of what stock prices should be. Stock selection
requires views as to which shares are underpriced or overpriced in the market.There are several
approaches. One involves discounting prospective future dividends in order to arrive at their
present value,which is regarded as the fair price of the share.Another approach obtains estimates
of the price-earnings ratio and of prospective earnings and uses those estimates to ascertain the
appropriate, or fair, price of the stock.
DISCOUNTING CASH FLOWS
A sum of money received (or paid) in the present is worth more than the same sum in the future.
One explanation for this runs in terms of the fact that money can earn interest.A unit of money
received now is worth more than the same unit received one year from now because it can earn
interest over the year. If the interest rate were 10% p.a., then receipts in the present are worth
10% more than identical receipts one year hence.
To render a future cash ﬂow comparable with a current one, the future sum is discounted.
This involves dividing the future sum by one plus the decimalised rate of interest. In the case

of a receipt of S one year hence, when the interest rate is 10% p.a., the present value (PV)
is given by:
PV  S/1.1
More generally:
PV  S/(1  r)
where r is the decimalised rate of interest.
If the cash ﬂow is to occur two years from now, then (assuming a rate of interest of 10% p.a.)
because of compound interest an identical sum in the present is worth 21% more (21% being the
total interest received over two years).The present value of the future sum would be:
PV  S/(1.1)2  S/1.21
(Note that S/1.21 invested for two years at 10% p.a. would be worth [S/1.21]1.21  S.)
More generally:
PV  S/(1  r)2
Correspondingly the present value of a sum three years hence is S/(1  r)3, four years hence
S/(1  r)4, and so on. It follows that the present value of a future stream of cash ﬂows of S per
year is:
PV  S/(1  r)  S/(1  r)2  S/(1  r)3  . . .  S/(1  r)n
where the ﬁnal receipt (or payment) occurs n years from the present.This can be more formally
expressed as:
PV    
n
k1
S/(1  r)k
which states that the present value equals the sum of the discounted cash ﬂows (the cash ﬂow
being S at the end of each year) relating to the next n years.
DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS
411
EXAMPLE 19.1
The present value of £100, to be received at the end of each of the next three years, with a discount
rate (i.e. interest rate) of 10% p.a. would be:
PV   
3
k1
100/(1.1)k

The time period is not necessarily a year. If it is not, an adjustment needs to be made to the
interest rate. For example for six-monthly cash ﬂows, an interest rate of 10% p.a. would be
expressed as a rate of 5% per six-month period. (Interest rates are always expressed on a per
annum  p.a.  basis; a six-month rate of 10% p.a. means 5% over six months. Likewise
a three-month rate of 10% p.a. means 2.5% over three months.)
The cash ﬂow may not be the same at the end of each time period, in which case the equation
becomes:
PV  S1/(1  r)  S2/(1  r)2  S3/(1  r)3  . . .  Sn/(1r)n
or PV    
n
k1
Sk/(1  r)k
where S1, S2, S3, . . ., Sn are the cash ﬂows at the ends of periods 1, 2, 3, . . ., n respectively.
There may also be a different interest rate (discount rate) for each time period.
DISCOUNTING EXPECTED FUTURE DIVIDENDS
This approach to share price valuation uses variations on the discounted cash ﬂow model.
The simplest variant is based on an unchanging annual dividend payment on the shares.

P is the fair price of the share, D is the annual dividend on the share, r is the discount rate, and
n is the number of years for which the ﬁrm is expected to exist.The rate of discount,r,is also known
as the required rate of return.The required rate of return is the rate required by investors in
the light of what is available on other investments.The required rate of return can be looked
upon as composed of the rate of yield on long-term government bonds plus a risk premium to
reﬂect the fact that shares are riskier than government bonds.The required rate of return is
often calculated by means of the security market line, which is derived from the capital asset
pricing model.

THE GORDON GROWTH MODEL
The assumption of an unchanging annual dividend is unrealistic for most stocks.The Gordon
growth model takes a step towards greater realism by allowing for a growth in annual dividends.
Dividends are assumed to grow at a constant annual rate.This growth rate of dividends is shown
as g in equation (3).

D is the most recent dividend,so D(1  g) is the next dividend.Equation (3) assumes that the
next dividend is payable one year from the present.If the company is expected to continue forever
(n approaches inﬁnity), equation (3) can be simpliﬁed to equation (4):

ESTIMATING THE GROWTH RATE OF DIVIDENDS
An investment analyst using the Gordon growth model would need to forecast the rate of dividend
growth.This can be done by using equation (5):
g  ROE  (1d) 
(5)
In equation 5, g is the growth rate of proﬁts, ROE (return on equity) is the rate of return that
the company can obtain from reinvested proﬁts,and d is the dividend payout rate (the proportion
of proﬁts paid as dividends to shareholders).With a constant dividend payout rate,the growth rate
of dividends will equal the growth rate of proﬁts.
For example, if the ﬁrm pays out 60% of proﬁts as dividends (whilst reinvesting 40%) and the
new investment yields 20% p.a. then:
g  0.2  (1  0.6)  0.08
Dividends (and proﬁts) are expected to grow at 8% p.a. Out of each pound of proﬁt 40p is
reinvested to yield 40p  0.2  8p more proﬁt per year. For every £1 proﬁt this year, there will
be £1.08 proﬁt next year.
From equation 4 it would appear that a reduction in the dividend payout rate would
reduce the share price by reducing dividends. From equation 5 it would appear that a reduction
in the dividend payout rate would increase the share price by increasing the expected growth
rate of dividends. Miller and Modigliani (1961) showed that, under certain conditions, changes
in the dividend payout rate have no effect on the share price.This is known as the Dividend
Irrelevance Theorem.
EXERCISE 19.2
The share price of a company is 100p. Its expected next dividend is 3p.The dividend (and share
price*) growth rate is expected to be 4% p.a.The risk-free interest rate is 5% p.a.The share has a
beta of 0.8 and the expected yield on the stock market as a whole is 8% p.a.
Use the Gordon growth model and the security market line to form an opinion as to whether
the share is correctly priced.
Answer
Rearranging the Gordon growth model gives an expression for expected returns.
The Gordon growth equation:
P  D(1  g)/(r  g)
(where P  share price,D(1  g)  expected next dividend,r  required rate of return,and
g is the expected growth rate of dividends) can be rearranged to give:
R  [D(1  g)/P]  g
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
414

where R  forecast rate of return,and g  expected growth rate of dividends  expected growth
rate of the share price.* [D(1  g)/P] is the expected rate of dividend yield and g the expected
rate of capital gain.Thus:
R  (3/100)  0.04  0.07
The forecast rate of return is 7% p.a.
The security market line can be expressed as:
r  rf  [E(rm)  rf]
where r  required rate of return,rf  risk-free rate of return,  beta of the share,and E(rm)
 expected return on the market.Thus:
r  0.05  0.8[0.08  0.05]  0.05  0.024  0.074 i.e. 7.4% p.a.
The forecast rate of return, 7% p.a., is below the required rate of return, 7.4% p.a.This share is
not a good buy. In other words it is overpriced.
The equality between the expected growth rate of dividends and the expected growth rate of the share price can be
seen from the Gordon growth model.
P  D(1  g)/(r g)
P(1g)  D(1g)2/(r g)
A growth in dividends of g produces a growth in the share price of g. In other words a growth in dividends by a factor
of (1  g) entails an increase in the share price by a factor of (1  g).
STOCHASTIC DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS
Stochastic dividend discount models allow for the possibility that dividends do not increase every
year.A stochastic form of the Gordon growth model is shown by equation (6):
P  D(1  pg)/(r  pg)
(6)
In equation (6),p is the probability that the dividend will increase in a period (e.g.a year).For
example if p is 0.5, there is a 50% chance of a dividend increase in a particular year.
Stochastic dividend discount models provide a distribution of possible future stock prices rather
than a single price.The equation indicates the average (mean) of a distribution of possible prices
but actual prices could differ from that average. Stochastic models can be reﬁned to allow for the
possibility of dividend reductions.
MULTI-PERIOD MODELS
A further step towards greater realism is provided by multi-period dividend discount models.The
simplest of these is the two-period model.The two-period model assumes dividend growth at an
untypical rate for a number of years after which growth proceeds at a normal rate.The ﬁrst step,
DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS
415

when using a two-period model, is to estimate the share price that will prevail at the future point
in time at which the growth rate will change.If the untypical growth rate is G,the normal growth
rate g, and the untypical growth is expected to continue for N years, the estimate of what the
share price will be N years from now (using the Gordon growth model) is given by equation (7).
PN  D(1  G)N(1  g)/(r  g) 
(7)
The term D(1  G)N(1  g) represents the dividend expected at the end of period N  1.
Application of the Gordon growth model then estimates the share price N years from the present.
This expected future share price is represented by PN.The current fair price of the stock is given
by discounting the expected future price and the dividends expected during the period of untypical
dividend growth.The current fair price is given by equation (8),which assumes that the untypical
dividend growth continues for three years.
P  D(1  G)/(1  r)  D(1  G)2/(1  r)2
 D(1  G)3/(1  r)3  PN/(1  r)3
(8)
Some investment analysts use three-period models in which the period of untypical growth is
followed by a period during which growth changes from the untypical to the typical rate.At the
end of this transition period the third period, during which growth proceeds at a normal rate,
begins.The Gordon growth model,used in multi-period dividend discount models,could be either
stochastic or non-stochastic.

by means of the Gordon growth model.The dividend expected in four years is:

P3  12.04/(0.08  0.04)  12.04/0.04  301p
This expected share price is discounted to the present together with the next three dividends
in order to estimate the current fair price of the share.
P  10(1.05)/1.08  10(1.05)2/(1.08)2  10(1.05)3/(1.08)3  301/(1.08)3

DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS

Answer
The ﬁrst step is to forecast what the share price will be at the end of year 6.The Gordon growth
model can be used for this purpose.
P6  50(1.14)/(0.160.14)
P6  57/0.02
P6  2850
This predicted price, and the year 6 dividend, are then discounted to the present.
P  50/(1.16)6  2850/(1.16)6
P  1190p
So the fair price of the shares is 1190p, i.e. £11.90.
(Alternatively: P5  50/(0.16  0.14)  50/0.02  2500
P  2500/(1.16)5  1190p)
DISCOUNTING CAPITAL GAINS
The future returns to be discounted in ascertaining the fair prices of shares need not be only
dividends. Relevant returns include capital gains. Indeed for a share that pays no dividends, the
prospective capital gains are the basis for estimating the current fair value.In such a case the current
fair price is the discounted value of an expected future price (future prices contain accumulated
capital gains).
This became apparent when considering the two-period version of the dividend discount model.
In that case the current fair price was the sum of the discounted expected future value and the
discounted values of the interim dividends.The model still holds if the expected interim dividends
are zero.
Expected future prices indicate prospective capital gains, and capital gains are as much
part of the return on shares as dividends. The expected future price, which is discounted,
may be based on a dividend discount model or some other means of forecasting the future share
price.
EFFECTS OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
ON THE SHARE PRICE
The Gordon growth model has implications for the relationship between the dividend policy
of a ﬁrm and its share price. This can be illustrated by the case of a ﬁrm that has to choose
between (a) distributing all of its proﬁts, and (b) distributing half its proﬁts. In these two cases
the rate of reinvestment would be zero and 50% respectively. Suppose that expected next
period proﬁts are 20p per share and that the required rate of return is 10% p.a. In the ﬁrst
case the expected rate of growth is zero (ignoring the possibility of growth unrelated to
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
418

investment). So in case (a) the fair price of the share, using the Gordon growth model, is
given by:
P  20/(0.10)  200p.
In the second case 50% of proﬁts are reinvested.Suppose that proﬁts can be reinvested to earn
16% p.a.The growth rate of proﬁts (and dividends) would be:
0.16  0.5  0.08 (i.e. 8% p.a.).
With proﬁts of 20p, there is reinvestment of 10p at 16% yielding 1.6p. Hence proﬁts grow at
the rate of 1.6/20  0.08.A constant dividend payout rate implies a growth rate of dividends of
0.08.
Using the Gordon growth model (noting that the next period dividend is expected to be
20p  0.5  10p):
P  10/(0.1  0.08)  10/(0.02)  500p.
It can be seen that the decision to reinvest half the proﬁts raises the fair price of the share from
200p to 500p.
The conclusion that lowering the dividend payout rate increases the share price rests on the fact
that the proﬁts can be reinvested to earn a rate of return that exceeds the required rate of return.
It can be shown that if the best investment opportunity available to the ﬁrm offers a rate of return
lower than the required rate, reinvestment of proﬁts will tend to reduce the share price. For
example if reinvested proﬁts were expected to earn 4% p.a.,the expected growth rate of dividends
would be:
0.04  0.5  0.02 (i.e. 2% p.a.).
The fair price of the share would be:
P  10/(0.1  0.02)  10/0.08  125p.
In this case the reduction of the dividend payout rate (and increase in the reinvestment rate)
reduces the fair price of the share from 200p to 125p.When the ﬁrm lacks strong investment
opportunities, reinvestment of proﬁts will tend to reduce the value of the ﬁrm.
Another Perspective on Share Pricing
The analysis of the effects of investment of proﬁts on share prices presents another way of looking
at the determination of share prices.
P  (E1/r)  value added by investing proﬁts
DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS
419

where P is the current fair price of the share, E1 the expected next period’s earnings (proﬁts),
and r the required rate of return.
The value added by investing proﬁts is the difference between the share price estimated on the
basis of all proﬁts being paid as dividends, and the share price estimated on the basis of part of
the proﬁts being invested to expand the ﬁrm.Consider a case in which the required rate of return
is 12.5% p.a. and proﬁts can be invested to earn 20% p.a.The growth rate of earnings (proﬁts)
would be:
g  dividend payout rate  return on investment.
In the case in which all proﬁts are paid as dividends,g  0.As a result the estimated share price
would be (using the Gordon growth model and expected earnings of 100p):
P  100/(0.125  0)  800p (which equals E1/r).
In a case in which half of the proﬁts are invested, g  0.5  0.2  0.1. In consequence the
estimated share price would be (using the Gordon growth model):
P  50/(0.125  0.1)  2000p.
In this case the value added by investing proﬁts is 2000p  800p  1200p.
The equation:
P  (E1/r)  value added by investing proﬁts
helps to explain price-earnings ratios.A high price-earnings ratio may be the result of a low
required rate of return, r, or a high value added by investing proﬁts. Stocks whose price-earnings
ratios are high as a result of high value added by investing proﬁts are often referred to as growth
stocks.
PROBLEMS WITH DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS
A number of difﬁculties arise when attempting to apply dividend discount models to stock price
valuation. One is the issue as to which form of dividend discount model to use. One approach to
that problem is to use several forms and use a weighted average of the results with the weighting
based on the relative likelihood of a form being the most appropriate.According to a survey carried
out by Dukes et al. (2006), the constant dividend version of the model is rarely used by market
professionals. Even the more sophisticated versions, such as multi-period models, are used only
by a minority.This is despite the tendency for practitioners to use several valuation approaches
simultaneously. However a survey by Glaum and Friedrich (2006) indicated that discounted cash
ﬂow was considered to be the most important valuation technique.The Glaum and Friedrich
survey found that analysts changed the relative importance of different techniques over time. In
particular they found evidence that,at a point in time,the favoured technique was the one providing
price estimates in line with currently observed prices.
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
420

Another issue is the reliability of the estimates of variables such as the required rate of return
and the growth rate of dividends.Estimates of the fair price of a share are highly sensitive to small
changes in such variables, particularly when the required rate of return and the growth rate of
dividends are very close.
Suppose that the most recent dividend was 10p, the expected rate of dividend growth is 9%
p.a., and the required rate of return is 10% p.a.The Gordon growth model would estimate the
fair price of the share as:
P  10(1.09)/(0.1  0.09)  10.9/0.01  1090p.
If the expected rate of dividend growth were 8% p.a., the fair price of the share would be
estimated as:
P  10(1.08)/(0.1  0.08)  10.8/0.02  540p.
Small variations in the expected rate of dividend growth or the required rate of return can
result in large changes in the estimated fair prices of shares.
Dividends do not normally grow at a constant rate. Estimating the future growth rate of
dividends is very difﬁcult and subject to considerable uncertainty.For example Dimson and Marsh
(2001) found a very high level of independence of annual dividend growth from one year to the
next,thus making annual dividend growth largely unpredictable.The required rate of return is very
uncertain because it will differ dependent upon the capital market model used (single-factor capital
asset pricing model,multi-factor capital asset pricing model,arbitrage pricing models,etc.).The
required rate of return will also vary with the values of beta and expected market return used,and
these are subject to considerable uncertainty.For example estimates of beta,and expected market
return,will vary with the choice of stock index used to proxy the market portfolio.They will also
vary with the time period from which data is taken.
Dividend discount models are inappropriate for companies that pay no dividends, or pay
shareholders in other ways. In some cases ﬁrms pay money to shareholders by means of
repurchasing shares in addition to, or instead of, paying dividends.
The Gordon growth model fails to give meaningful results when the expected growth rate of
dividends exceeds the required rate of return. In such cases the estimated share price is negative,
and negative share prices are impossible.
Changes in interest rates cause changes in the discount rates used in dividend discount models.
A fall in interest rates lowers discount rates and raises the estimated stock prices. It is important
to distinguish between interest rate movements caused by changes in real interest rates, and
movements caused by changes in expectations of inﬂation (see Chapter 3 on interest rates and
money market investments).A fall in nominal interest rates caused by a fall in real interest rates
justiﬁably indicates a rise in the fair prices of shares.A fall in nominal interest rates resulting from
lowered expectations of inﬂation does not imply a change in fair prices. In such a case the fall in
nominal interest rates would tend to be offset by a fall in expected dividend growth.The expected
rate of dividend growth,in money terms,comprises an element of real growth and an element of
inﬂation. Failure to make the distinction between real and nominal interest rates, and to take
account of the effects of variations in inﬂation on nominal dividend growth,is referred to as inﬂation
DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS
421

illusion (or money illusion).Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004a),Feinman (2005),and Modigliani
and Cohn (1979) suggested that investment analysts have been susceptible to such inﬂation bias.
The bias implies that stock prices have been too low in periods of high inﬂation, and too high
in periods of low inﬂation.
In the chapters dealing with behavioural ﬁnance, in particular Chapters 2 and 24, it is
shown that social and psychological factors distort decision-making.These distorting factors
affect investment analysts as well as other participants in investment markets. It seems
likely that social inﬂuences, cognitive biases, mood, and sentiment affect users of dividend dis-
count models. For example, expectations of dividend growth rates may be inﬂuenced by
such factors.
Psychological research has indicated that people in a positive mood may underestimate risk
and overestimate prospective returns,and vice versa for negative moods (Isen 1997;Nygren et al.
1996). Consider the Gordon growth model (equation 4):
P  D(1  g)/(r  g)
(4)
A favourable mood might increase the estimated dividend growth rate,g.In addition a reduction
in perceived risk, or in risk-aversion, would reduce the required rate of return, r. Both of these
effects would raise the estimated fair price of the stock, P.To the extent that moods are widely
shared, the market as a whole could produce distorted prices. According to the socionomic
hypothesis moods are transmitted between people and spread throughout society to bring about
widely shared social moods (Prechter 1999; Nofsinger 2005; Olson 2006). So society as a whole
can be in either a positive or a negative mood, and stock prices can correspondingly be biased
upwards or downwards.

(c) Uncertainties as to the reliability of an estimate of the fair price of the share arise from the
possibility that (i) the models used are wrong, (ii) the way the models are used is wrong, and
(iii) the data used in the application of the models is wrong.
(i) The capital asset pricing model,from which the security market line is derived,may not
be the best asset pricing model.Another model, such as the arbitrage pricing model,
might be more suitable.Also the Gordon growth model may not be the most relevant
variation on the dividend discount model; and the dividend discount approach to share
pricing might not be the most suitable approach.
(ii) The market portfolio of the capital asset pricing model should include all forms
of asset:stocks,bonds,property,human capital.It should also include all such assets from
every country. To approximate the market portfolio with a stock index from
a single country (as is typically done in applications of the security market line) may
provide a very inaccurate ﬁgure.
(iii) The data used in the models is based on history and judgement. Even if history
reliably repeats itself, it is impossible to know precisely what history tells us. Statistical
techniques that aim to estimate values such as beta, based on past values, do not
provide single unique numbers but merely provide a distribution of possibilities (it is the
average, or mean, of the distribution that is used). Furthermore there may be
changes in circumstances that render the past unreliable as a guide to the future. Such
factors render variables such as beta, expected market return, and expected dividend
growth rates difﬁcult to estimate.As a result the values actually used may not be accurate.
To the extent that judgement plays a part in estimating variables, the uncertainty is
increased.
ALTERNATIVES TO EXPECTED DIVIDENDS
Expected dividends are seen as appropriate cash ﬂows to discount on the grounds that people
invest for the purpose of receiving future cash ﬂows.Dividends are the cash ﬂows that are provided
by shares.However where shares do not pay dividends alternative cash ﬂows need to be considered.
One cash ﬂow that can be used is the sum of money available for distribution to shareholders,
even though it may not actually be paid to them.This sum of money might be termed Free Cash
Flow to Equity (FCFE) and could be measured as:
Net Earnings  Depreciation Expense  New Borrowing
 Capital Spending  Increase in Working Capital  Debt Repayments
DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS
423

FCFE can then be used in equations that mirror those used by dividend discount models.
For example the parallel to the Gordon growth model would be:
P  FCFE1/(r  g)
where P is the fair price of the share,FCFE1 is the expected next period FCFE,r is the required
rate of return, and g is the expected growth rate of FCFE.
FUSION INVESTING
Arguably one defect of dividend discount models is that they ignore psychological factors in the
determination of share prices.Shiller (1984) proposed a model in which a dividend discount model
is combined with a term that indicates investor sentiment.The combination of dividend discount
models and investor sentiment in the valuation of shares has been referred to as ‘fusion investing’
(Lee 2003).
In Shiller’s model the market price of a share is the discounted value of expected dividends plus
a sentiment term.The sentiment term indicates the demand from noise traders who reﬂect investor
sentiment. Noise traders are unsophisticated investors with no particular expertise.When noise
traders are bullish prices will exceed their fair (fundamental) values.Conversely when noise traders
are bearish prices will be below fundamental values. Sometimes noise traders are largely inactive
and prices reﬂect the fair values indicated by dividend discount models.At other times noise trader
sentiment can have a major impact on prices.
Fisher and Statman (2000) measured the investment sentiment of large, medium, and small
investors by means of published survey data.They found a negative relationship between sentiment
and subsequent equity returns.This suggests that positive sentiment causes stock prices to be too
high, with subsequent low returns as prices move down towards their fair levels (fundamental
values). Conversely negative sentiment is associated with excessively low prices, and subsequent
high returns as share prices move up towards their fundamental values.
Brown and Cliff (2005) also used survey data to measure investor sentiment, and found that
investor sentiment affected stock prices.They found that investor optimism led to overvaluation,
and subsequent low returns as prices moved back towards their fundamental values. The
relationship appeared to be strongest amongst large capitalisation shares with high price-to-book
ratios (i.e.large-cap growth stocks).Sentiment was more important in causing overvaluation than
undervaluation.This asymmetry could result from the relative difﬁculty of short selling, so that
sales of shares in response to perceived overpricing is difﬁcult with the result that overpricing
could be substantial. Underpricing would be more readily corrected since there are no restraints
on buying stock.
Baker and Wurgler (2006) measured investor sentiment by means of proxies such as closed-end
fund (investment trust) discounts and share turnover.They also found that sentiment affected stock
prices such that positive sentiment caused overpricing and subsequent low returns, and negative
sentiment was associated with underpricing and subsequent strong returns.They concluded that
sentiment was most important in the cases of stocks that were not easily valued by means of dividend
discount models.They suggested that the companies whose share prices were most affected by
sentiment were those which did not pay dividends or were characterised by being new,small,high

growth,unproﬁtable,or distressed.The valuation of such stocks was seen as being very subjective
and hence susceptible to sentiment.On the other hand shares yielding stable dividends were seen
as amenable to objective evaluation and their prices were less affected by investor sentiment.Baker
and Wurgler concluded that the valuation of shares should incorporate investor sentiment.
In a survey of analysts, Glaum and Friedrich (2006), found that discounted cash ﬂow was the
most favoured technique for estimating the fair prices of shares.They also found that analysts paid
considerable attention to market sentiment when estimating fair prices.These ﬁndings suggest
that stock analysts use a form of fusion investing.
CONCLUSION
Active fund management requires investment analysis. An active fund manager may seek to
ascertain which shares are underpriced, and which overpriced. Underpriced shares would be
candidates for purchase whereas overpriced shares should be avoided.There are a number of
approaches to investment analysis. Chapter 14 on the capital asset pricing model described one
approach.The current chapter has described another approach,or group of approaches,based on
discounting expected future cash receipts. Later chapters will consider the use of accounting
information, ﬁnancial ratios, and technical analysis. In practice investment analysts and fund
managers use a number of different methods for estimating the fair prices of shares.The managers
of tracker funds do not bear the costs of investment analysis, and the efﬁcient market hypothesis
suggests that investment analysis is pointless (see Part 7 on market efﬁciency).
Dividend discount models are based on the view that investors buy shares because of the income
(dividends) to be received from them.The models can be reﬁned in many ways such as allowing
for dividend growth, variations in the growth rate, and interruptions to the process of dividend
growth.Even very sophisticated models have their problems.Can the analyst be sure that the most
appropriate version of the model is being used? Are the values of variables used good estimates?
The accuracy of the variables input into a model is crucial. However good the model is, it will
fail if the inputs are poor.Unfortunately the values of variables such as required rates of return and
dividend growth rates are subject to considerable uncertainty.Furthermore,even small variations
in the values of such inputs can cause large variations in the estimated fair price of a share.
Estimation of required rates of return entails the use of capital market theory such as the capital
asset pricing model.There is considerable uncertainty about the validity of such models, and the
estimates derived from them are subject to statistical error (see Part 4 on capital market theory).
Estimates of prospective rates of dividend growth are vulnerable to psychological biases.
For example the estimates of dividend growth could be affected by optimism bias and the moods
of investment analysts.Even market professionals,such as investment analysts and fund managers
employed by institutional investors, are subject to such behavioural biases.
What superﬁcially appears to be a potentially objective means of estimating what share prices
should be is,in reality,very subjective.The same could be said of the other approaches to investment
analysis. Personal judgement lies at the heart of investment analysis.

Company accounts and
economic value added
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The structure of company balance sheets.
2. Proﬁt and loss accounts.
3. Cash ﬂow statements.
4. The analysis and interpretation of company accounts.
5. Tobin’s q.
6. Economic value added and other abnormal earnings share pricing models.
Company accounts are important for analysing investments because they provide information
about the amount, and sources, of proﬁt. Items in the accounts also provide the data for ratio
analysis.The accounts comprise the balance sheet, the proﬁt and loss account, and the cash ﬂow
statement.
THE BALANCE SHEET
Table 20.1 shows the balance sheet for a hypothetical company (all values are in £million;numbers
in brackets are liabilities).
The balance sheet shows the ﬁnancial position at a point in time, and is alternatively known
as the position statement.The balance sheet could be looked upon as an accounting equation.
Sources of funds  Uses of funds
Shareholders’ funds £156m  Creditors £120m Assets £276m
The more permanent assets are termed ﬁxed assets while the less permanent are referred to
as current assets. Intangible assets include items such as patents and goodwill. Goodwill arises
from acquiring another company and paying more for it than the value of its assets (more generally,

goodwill can be looked upon as the difference between the book value and the market value of
a company).Tangible ﬁxed assets include land, buildings, machinery, equipment, and vehicles.
The values of tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at their net book value.The net book value of an item
is its original (historic) cost minus an estimate of the extent to which it has depreciated in value
with use and time.
Current assets are the less permanent items,typically having prospective lives of less than a year.
Trade creditors and bank overdrafts,where the debt is to be settled within one year,are subtracted
from the current assets to give the net current assets ﬁgure. Net current assets are alternatively
known as working capital.The sum described as shareholders’ funds is the amount that balances
the accounts.The money allocated to the category of shareholders’ funds is the sum that equates
sources of funds with uses of funds. It could be looked upon as the difference between what the
company owns and what it owes.
Shareholders’ funds are alternatively referred to as the book value of the company.This is not
necessarily what the company is worth to the shareholders.The book value is based on Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).One of those principles is that assets are usually valued
at their historic cost (what the company paid for them). From the historic cost a sum is deducted

to reﬂect the depreciation arising from use and the passage of time.In the case of debtors a provision
may be made for bad debts (debtors likely to default), alternatively known as non-performing
debts.The value of the investors’ shareholdings is determined by the market value of the shares,
and is equal to the number of shares issued times the share price.This value is alternatively known
as the market capitalisation of the company.The value of shareholders’ funds that appears in the
accounts is not the same as the value of the shareholdings as determined by the stock market.
The ratio between the market value and the book value is known as the market-to-book ratio,
or the price-book value ratio.In the present example,if the share price were 200p and there were
150 million shares in issue the market value of shareholders’investments would be £300 million.
This implies a market-to-book ratio of 300/156  1.92.The difference between the market and
book values might be looked upon as value added by the management of the company.
THE PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
The proﬁt and loss account is alternatively referred to as the income statement. It indicates how
well the company has performed over a period of time, typically a year.Table 20.2 shows a
hypothetical proﬁt and loss account (values in £million; values in brackets are outﬂows).
The proﬁt and loss account shows the sales income minus the costs of trading (the costs of
production and distribution).The sum available for distribution to shareholders is the proﬁt after
tax. In Table 20.2 it can be seen that proﬁt after tax is £28 million, of which £14 million is paid to
shareholders as dividends and £14 million is retained for investment in the business.
Another useful value is the operating proﬁt,alternatively known as earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT).
EBIT  total revenues  operating costs (including depreciation)
In the present example operating proﬁt (EBIT) is £44 million.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) is calculated by
adding back depreciation and amortisation to EBIT.Depreciation and amortisation (amortisation
is the depreciation of intangible assets) are costs that do not involve immediate cash outlays.
EBITDA could be looked upon as the amount of cash created by the company. In the present
example:
EBITDA  EBIT  depreciation  £44m  £54m  £98m.
One justiﬁcation for the use of EBITDA is that depreciation and amortisation expenses are not
cash ﬂows, and they represent the allocations of historic costs rather than expectations of future
capital expenditure. In consequence they may not be particularly useful for assessing the ongoing
proﬁtability of a company.The current cost of acquiring ﬁxed assets (capital expenditure rather
than depreciation) is of greater relevance for this purpose.
Another justiﬁcation for the use of EBITDA is that it indicates a company’s ﬂexibility to respond
to changing circumstances. Since depreciation and amortisation are not cash ﬂows, EBITDA is a
better measure than operating proﬁt of the cash ﬂow available for new investment.An alternative
to EBITDA in this context is operating cash ﬂow.
Earnings per share (EPS) are derived from the proﬁt and loss account, such that:
EPS 
The EPS can be inﬂuenced by exceptional and extraordinary items that impact on proﬁts
temporarily. For example the sale of a building will add to proﬁts in a year, but would not be
repeated and hence that part of proﬁt does not arise from ongoing business. Investment analysts
will often adjust the EPS ﬁgure in order to remove the effects of exceptional and extraordinary
items.This normalised EPS is referred to as headline EPS.
THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The third ﬁnancial statement in a published set of company accounts is the cash ﬂow statement.
This statement shows sources of cash and how the cash has been used. Table 20.3 shows a
hypothetical cash ﬂow statement for a period (which is usually a year).The uses of funds (outﬂows)
are shown in brackets.
The item ‘Financing’ refers to additional ﬁnance, for example borrowing more money.The
item ‘Servicing of ﬁnance’ refers to repaying debt and paying interest on debt.The uses of funds
are alternatively known as applications of funds. It can be seen from Table 20.3 that the largest
application of funds was on capital expenditure (i.e. investment in the business).
Cash ﬂow statements can be seen as dealing with three types of activity: operating activities,
investing activities, and ﬁnancing activities. Operating activities provide sales revenue and incur
costs of production.Investing activities include purchases and sales of plant,property,and ﬁnancial
assets. Financing activity refers to issuing or redeeming shares and debt, and the payment of
dividends. Proﬁts and losses from operating activities must be matched by offsetting net ﬂows
from the combination of investing and ﬁnancing activities.

ANALYSIS OF ACCOUNTS
Accounts may be subjected to cross-section analysis and time-series analysis. One form of
cross-section analysis entails common-size statements. In order to facilitate comparison between
companies of differing sizes balance sheet items may be expressed as percentages of net assets
or total capital employed. Common-size proﬁt and loss accounts could express components
as percentages of turnover. Financial ratios can also be used for cross-section analysis, that is for
comparing ﬁrms.
Time-series analysis may use the techniques of trend statements, ratio analysis, and
variability analysis.Trend statements can be used for components of proﬁt and loss accounts.
A base date is chosen and the component of the accounts is given a base value of 100.
Subsequent years’ values are then expressed relative to the base value.A rise of 10% leads to a
value of 110 being recorded.The results over a number of years are examined for any patterns
or trends. Financial ratios can also be subjected to time-series analysis in order to identify
any trends.
Variability analysis aims to measure the dispersion of ﬁnancial ratios and trend-statement values
over time. One approach might be to subtract the lowest observed value from the highest and
divide the result by the average. Another approach would entail the division of the standard
deviation of observed values by the average value.
A number of changes over time can render time-series analysis difﬁcult. Changes in
accounting standards, accounting policies, and accounting practices over time can make
the interpretation of apparent patterns difﬁcult. Changes in the composition of a ﬁrm’s business
over time can also pose problems for the interpretation of a time-series. A particular source
of change that creates problems of interpretation is price change, in other words inﬂation
(Redhead 1976).
The inﬂation problem arises because most items in accounts are valued at historic cost, which
are the prices originally paid. However historic costs are likely to differ from current prices.
As a result historic cost accounting can cause published accounts to be misleading. A highly
simpliﬁed example can illustrate this.
Suppose that a ﬁrm buys 50 units of raw material each year and sells 50 units of ﬁnished output.
Further suppose that inﬂation is running at 100% p.a.(i.e.prices double each year).The simpliﬁed

proﬁt and loss account for a year in which the raw material costs £2 per unit and the output sells
at £3 per unit might look like that of Table 20.4.
The proﬁt and loss account shows a proﬁt of £50. However to maintain the same level of
production into the next year requires expenditure of £200 (£4  50) on raw materials.The
receipt of £150 from sales is not enough to meet the new raw material costs; an extra
£50 is needed. Looked at from this perspective there is a loss of £50 rather than a proﬁt of
£50.The adjustment of accounts to incorporate the effects of inﬂation is known as inﬂation
accounting. In the example of Table 20.4, inﬂation accounting would involve using replace-
ment costs (the costs of replacing the raw materials) rather than historic costs when valuing
cost of sales. Using replacement costs rather than historic costs would produce the accounts
of Table 20.5.
The use of historic costs is known as FIFO (ﬁrst in ﬁrst out) and the use of replacement costs
is LIFO (last in ﬁrst out).
CREATIVE ACCOUNTING AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTS
When interpreting a set of accounts the user should be aware of how accounts can be rendered
misleading.The process of attempting to mislead users of accounts is often referred to as ‘creative
accounting’.The following list indicates some creative accounting techniques.
1. Revenue may be recorded too early. In particular revenue from sales may be recorded in the
accounts before the sale is agreed.
2. Bogus revenues may be recorded. For example refunds from suppliers might be recorded as
revenues.
3. Income from recurring business may be artiﬁcially boosted by the inclusion of one-off gains.
There could be a failure to fully separate non-recurring gains from recurring income.
Also losses from recurring business might be described as non-recurring.
4. Current expenses could be allocated to a later period.This could take the form of depreciating
or amortising too slowly or failing to write off worthless assets immediately.

5. Future expenses may be shifted to a current period.For example depreciation or amortisation
may be too rapid.
6. There may be a failure to record all liabilities.
7. Current income may be allocated to a later period.
8. Unrealistic valuations might be given to inventories.
9. Unrealistic bad debt provisions could be made.
10. Items may be held ‘off-balance sheet’.
Indications of the range of creative accounting techniques can be found in Schilit (1993),Grifﬁths
(1995), and T.Smith (1996).
From an investor’s perspective creative accounting is only important if investment analysts
fail to see through it. Breton and Tafﬂer (1995) found that many analysts were unable to spot
creative accounting. Foster (1979) found that public revelations of creative accounting caused
falls in share prices, which suggests that analysts had not previously been aware of its use by
the respective corporations. The deﬁciency of accounting skills on the part of investment
analysts would not matter too much if most ﬁrms sought to be fair and accurate in their accounts.
Naser and Pendelbury (1992) found that UK auditors believed that creative accounting was widely
used. However Aboody et al. (1999) investigated one particular source of creative accounting,
namely revaluations of ﬁxed assets, and concluded that upward revaluations were generally
not creative fabrications. (Fixed assets could be revalued upwards in order to lower debt to
asset ratios and thereby reduce apparent gearing, which could result in being able to borrow
on improved terms.)
Chung et al. (2002) investigated whether the extent of institutional ownership of a com-
pany’s shares inﬂuenced the tendency of the company management to manipulate accounts.
They found that high institutional ownership was associated with mitigation of the manipu-
lation of accounts. Institutional ownership was found to deter manipulation of accounts in
companies with poor returns on their shares (or with low values for Tobin’s q), but not in those
with good returns (or with high values of Tobin’s q). The conclusion of the study was that
institutional shareholders appeared to be able to reduce earnings management, which suggests
that such shareholders were aware of actual or potential manipulation of accounts (earnings
management).
TOBIN’S q
It is possible to give an economic interpretation to a concept related to the price-book value ratio
(market-to-book ratio) if assets are valued at replacement cost.The replacement cost is the amount
that a company would have to pay to replace its assets.
Where assets are valued at their replacement costs, the price-book value ratio is known as
Tobin’s q. By dividing shareholder value and replacement cost of assets by the number of shares
issued, a ratio of share price to replacement cost per share is obtained.

The constant dividend version of the dividend discount model states that the fair price of a
share is given by P in the equation:
P  D/r
where D is the constant dividend and r is the required rate of return.This can be expressed in
terms of market capitalisation where N is the number of shares issued, and hence P  N is the
market capitalisation.
P  N  (D  N)/r
If the rate of return on the replacement cost of assets is R (and bearing in mind that a constant
dividend is consistent with all earnings being paid as dividends,i.e.zero reinvestment),this equation
can be rewritten as:
P  N  (R  replacement cost of assets)/r
That is:
shareholder value  (R  replacement cost of assets)/r
and
shareholder value/replacement cost of assets  R/r
So:
Tobin’s q  R/r
It can thus be seen that when book value is interpreted as replacement cost,the price-book value
ratio can be interpreted as:
R/r
The beneﬁt of valuation at replacement cost is that book value represents the current cost of
investing in the business.What holds in this case does not necessarily hold for the price-book value
ratio in general.Valuation in the accounts is generally not at replacement cost.
Sometimes q is used as a guide to investment.When applied to the stock market as a whole it
may be expressed as:
q 
It has been suggested that when q is relatively high investors should switch out of shares
since companies are likely to sell shares for the purpose of investing in their businesses (since
shares are highly valued relative to investment assets).The sale of shares would tend to depress
their prices.

Conversely a low q is seen as a buy signal.When q is low it is cheaper for ﬁrms to expand
by takeovers than by internal growth.The purchase of shares during takeover bids would raise
share prices.
THE ABNORMAL EARNINGS SHARE PRICING MODEL
This approach to estimating the fair price of a share decomposes the share price into two
components. One component is the book value, and the other is the present value of expected
abnormal earnings. Abnormal earnings are deﬁned as the excess of earnings over the required
return on the book value.These relationships are described by equations 1 and 2.
P0  B0 A1/(1r) A2/(1r)2 A3/(1r)3  . . . A∞/(1r)∞
(1)
where P0 is the fair price of the share, B0 is the current book value per share, r is the required
rate of return, and A1,A2, etc. are the expected abnormal earnings per share in years 1, 2, etc.
A1  E1  (B0  r)
(2)
where E1 is expected earnings per share in year 1.There would be corresponding equations for
subsequent expected values of A [e.g.A2  E2  (B1  r)].
The share price estimates produced by the abnormal earnings model are not dependent upon
accounting practices.They are not affected by decisions as to how to allocate depreciation over time.
This can be demonstrated by means of a (highly) simpliﬁed set of accounts.
Suppose that shareholders invest £100 in a company and that the company immediately spends
the £100 on capital equipment.The company has net cash ﬂows of £110 in each of two years,and
then ceases business at the end of the second year.There are no payments to shareholders until the
end of year 2, at which point all assets are paid to shareholders as a dividend.The company has a
required rate of return (cost of capital) of 10% p.a.The accounts are shown as Tables 20.6 and 20.7.

In Table 20.6,all of the depreciation is assigned to year 1.In Table 20.7,the depreciation is equally
divided between years 1 and 2.
From Table 20.6 it can be seen that adding together book value (at the beginning of year 1)
and discounted abnormal earnings gives £181.82 as the estimated share price (at the beginning of
year 1). It can be seen that this equals the discounted value of the expected dividends.
In Table 20.7, the initial capital expenditure is depreciated over two years; £50 in each of the
years.Adding together the initial book value and the discounted abnormal earnings gives £181.81
as the fair price of the share.This is the same as the sum from Table 20.6 and the discounted
dividends (except for £0.01 due to rounding). It can thus be seen that accounting practice, in
terms of the allocation of depreciation charges between years,has no effect on the estimated share
price when the abnormal earnings model is used.
As a digression,these observations highlight the difﬁculty of giving an economic interpretation
to accounting values.ComparingTables 20.6 and 20.7 shows differences in the pattern of earnings
and book values. However they have identical cash ﬂows, dividends, and estimated share prices.
Both of the accounting practices are acceptable in terms of accounting principles (deferring
depreciation beyond the year in which the capital was acquired is referred to as accruals
accounting). It thus appears that accounting measures of earnings (proﬁt) and book value do not
necessarily have a clear economic interpretation.
Ohlson’s Model
Ohlson’s (Ohlson 1995) variation of the abnormal earnings model simpliﬁes the abnormal earn-
ings component of the valuation using the approach of the Gordon growth model. A persis-
tence parameter is used to model the pattern of future abnormal earnings. The persistence
parameter, denoted by ω, deﬁnes the relationship between successive values of abnormal earn-
ings such that:

The abnormal earnings of one year are ω times the abnormal earnings of the previous year.
Ohlson proposed that ω should take values between 0 and 1.
Within equation 1, the term:
A1/(1r) A2/(1r)2 A3/(1r)3  . . . A∞/(1r)∞
becomes:
A0ω/(1r) A0ω2/(1r)2 A0ω3/(1r)3  . . . A0ω∞/(1r)∞
which can be simpliﬁed to A0ω/(r  1  ω). It might be noted that ω  1 corresponds to g
in the Gordon growth model; they both represent the growth rate of a cash ﬂow.
Thus the abnormal earnings model estimates the fair price of the share to be:
P0  B0 A0ω/(r  1  ω)
(3)
According to the abnormal earnings model, the difference between the share price and book
value per share equals the present value of expected abnormal returns. If the share price exceeds
the book value,the ﬁrm is adding to shareholder value by prospectively making abnormal returns.
A share price below book value suggests that the ﬁrm’s operations reduce shareholder value.
ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED
Economic Value Added (developed by Stern, Stewart, & Co.) is a special case of the abnormal
earnings model.The distinguishing feature of Economic Value Added is that it imposes a speciﬁc
method of accounting.Different methods of accounting produce different measures of book value
and earnings (proﬁts) for a year.The method of accounting used with Economic Value Added
attempts to give increased economic meaning to measures of book value and earnings.The results
should provide a good measure of value added during a year.
One aspect of Economic Value Added is that intangible assets such as research and development,
training,advertising,and software development should be treated in the same way as other forms
of investment when compiling company accounts.This moves the book value of invested capital
closer to a true measure of how much has been invested. However a high degree of subjectivity
remains when drawing up accounts (Barker 2001).Judgement is required in deciding which items
of expenditure should be treated as investments (i.e.capitalised in the balance sheet).There is also
subjectivity involved in decisions such as the choice of the number of years over which such
intangible investments should be amortised (depreciated).
To a large extent Economic Value Added is similar to the concept of residual income in that it
subtracts the cost of equity capital from proﬁts.Normal accounting proﬁt makes no allowance for
the fact that equity capital has an opportunity cost (which is its earnings in the best alternative use).
Residual income is obtained by subtracting the opportunity cost of equity capital from accounting
proﬁt.The result indicates whether the ﬁrm is creating or destroying economic value. Economic
value is created if accounting proﬁt exceeds the opportunity cost of equity capital. If accounting
proﬁt falls short of the cost of equity capital, the ﬁrm is destroying economic value.

Value-added measures evaluate recent management performance based on the ability of
management to add value to a company.They are used by investment analysts as indicators of
future equity returns, on the premise that past performance is indicative of future performance
that should affect the returns on the shares of the company.The question arises as to whether
accounting proﬁt or Economic Value Added is the more useful for investment analysis. Biddle et
al. (1997, 1999) found that accounting proﬁt was more highly associated, than Economic Value
Added,with returns on shares.Kyriazis and Anastassis (2007) provided evidence in support of those
ﬁndings.The results of a survey of stock analysts by Glaum and Friedrich (2006) indicated that
abnormal earnings models (residual earnings models) were little used by stock analysts.
CONCLUSION
Thorough investment analysis requires attention to the accounts of the company whose share price
is being analysed.The proﬁtability and ﬁnancial strength of a company are important considerations.
An analyst should also be aware of the techniques used by some accountants to present misleading
representations of companies.Analysts should be able to see through creative accounting techniques
in order to see a true picture of the company.
The consideration of company accounts leads to other groups of investment analysis techniques.
Some are based on price-to-book ratios.Tobin’s q is a well-known variant of this approach.Others
are related to dividend discount models (see Chapter 19 on dividend discount models) but the cash
ﬂows to be discounted are expected abnormal earnings. Economic Value Added (developed by
Stern, Stewart, & Co.) is a well-known variant.
The interpretation of accounts can be subject to many of the psychological biases identiﬁed in
the chapters (particularly 2 and 24) dealing with behavioural ﬁnance. Many of those biases relate
to inaccurate perceptions.There is the possibility that analysts and investors will see what they want
to see.Accounts are sufﬁciently complex and multifaceted to allow for considerable ambiguity and
scope for subjective interpretation. Accounting is not a purely objective process. There is
considerable scope for opinion, both in the construction and in the interpretation of accounts.

Chapter 21
Ratio analysis
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Price-earnings ratios as means of valuing shares.
2. Other market ratios.
3. Financial adequacy ratios.
4. Z scores
5. Ratios as indicators of general market movements.
6. Yield gaps, yield ratios, and ‘The Fed Model’.
7. Problems with ratio analysis.
8. The usefulness of following professional investment analysts.
An investment analyst needs to combine all the information provided by ratios and accounts.This
may involve a search for trends in these ﬁnancial indicators together with comparisons with other
companies.A thorough analysis of a company would go beyond the ratios and accounts, but this
ﬁnancial data provides an essential component for an analysis of the prospects of a company from
the perspective of an investor.
PRICE-EARNINGS RATIOS
Price-earnings ratios provide a means of ascertaining the appropriate price of a stock.The price-
earnings ratio is the ratio of the share price to the earnings (proﬁts) per share.This can be expressed
by equation 1.
PE  P/eps
(1)
PE is the price-earnings ratio, P is the current share price, and eps is the earnings (i.e. proﬁts)
per share.

The price-earnings ratio can be either backward looking or forward looking. In the back-
ward-looking version, eps could be interpreted as the most recent earnings per share. In the
forward-looking version, eps is an estimate of earnings per share during the next period. Pub-
lished price-earnings ratios (in the ﬁnancial media or company reports) are normally backward
looking. For the purposes of investment analysis, it may be necessary to have a forward-
looking ratio.(Alternatively the past earnings per share could be used in conjunction with a justiﬁed
price-earnings ratio relating to the present. The justiﬁed price-earnings ratio would be the
ratio that the investment analyst believes should prevail in the present. If this justiﬁed ratio
differs from the published ratio, it follows that the fair price of the share differs from the
actual price. The fair price is the price that the investment analyst believes is justiﬁed by
current information.)
According to a survey of US market professionals carried out by Dukes et al. (2006) the use of
price-earnings ratios for stock price valuation is widespread.Forward-looking versions are the most
popular, but many use current ratios and past earnings. Sometimes the past earnings are averages
from a number of previous years. Such trailing earnings averages could be based on ﬁgures up to
ten years into the past (Harney and Tower 2003). Block (1999) also found a tendency for stock
analysts to make considerable use of multiples, such as price-earnings ratios, and found that
multiples were more used than discounted cash ﬂow techniques. However Glaum and Friedrich
(2006) found discounted cash ﬂow to be more popular and that multiples tended to be used as
checks to ascertain that the discounted cash ﬂow results were broadly consistent with the multiples.
Glaum and Friedrich found that the relative popularity of valuation techniques changed over time,
and that the favoured technique tended to be the one that gave price estimates close to observed
current prices.
Estimation of a forward-looking price-earnings ratio,and the simultaneous forecast of earnings
per share for the corresponding future period (normally the next period),allows for the estimation
of a fair price for the share.This is shown by equation 2.
P  PE  eps
(2)
Multiplication of the price-earnings ratio (PE) by the earnings per share (eps) provides an
estimate of the fair price of the share (P).The fair price of the share is the price that the analyst
believes that it should be. If the fair price differs from the actual price, there may be a perceived
proﬁt opportunity from trading in the share.
The use of equation (2) requires that PE is estimated separately from eps.The estimation of
PE can be carried out in at least four distinct ways. First an average of past price-earnings ratios
for the company (whose share price is being analysed) can be used. Second, an average of
price-earnings ratios for similar ﬁrms can be used.The similarity may be based upon sector, for
example the appropriate price-earnings ratio for a ﬁrm in the airline sector could be estimated from
other companies in the same sector.
A third approach is based on the Gordon growth model.The Gordon growth model can be
written as shown in equation 3.
P  D/(rg)
(3)
RATIO ANALYSIS
439

P represents the fair price of the share, D the expected next dividend, r the required rate of
return (comprising a risk-free interest rate plus a risk premium),and g is the expected growth rate
of dividends. Dividing both sides of equation 3 by eps gives equation 4.
P/eps  (D/eps)/(rg)
(4)
P/eps is the price-earnings ratio (PE).The term D/eps is the dividend payout rate; that is the
proportion of earnings (proﬁts) paid as dividends to shareholders.
From equation 4,it can be seen that the price-earnings ratio rises with increases in the dividend
payout rate and the expected growth rate of dividends. However it should be noted that these
two variables are not independent, a higher dividend payout rate involves lower reinvestment
of proﬁts and hence might be expected to reduce the growth rate (but there is evidence that
higher dividend payout ratios are associated with higher subsequent growth rates; Arnott
and Asness 2003;Asness 2005). Equation 4 also shows that the price-earnings ratio is inversely
related to the required rate of return.This implies that a rise in interest rates or an increase in
the perceived riskiness of the share (which raises the risk premium) would cause a fall in the
price-earnings ratio.
Suppose that the dividend payout rate is 0.5, the required rate of return is 12% p.a., and the
expected growth rate of dividends is 2% p.a., then putting these ﬁgures into equation 4 gives:
PE  0.5/(0.12  0.02)  5
If the expected next period earnings per share are £3, use of equation 2 gives:
P  5  £3  £15
The fair price of the share is £15. If the market price is below £15, this stock should be
considered for purchase.
Regression analysis constitutes a fourth means of estimating the price-earnings ratio.Regression
analysis is a technique for ascertaining the statistical relationship between one variable and one or
more other variables. Equation 5 illustrates a hypothetical example of the result of a regression
analysis.
PE  3  2g  0.5 (D/eps)
(5)
This hypothetical regression equation estimates the price-earnings ratio to be equal to three plus
twice the growth rate of company earnings plus half the dividend payout rate.Putting forecasts of
the growth rate of earnings,and of the dividend payout rate,into equation 5 yields a number which
is the estimated price-earnings ratio.
Whitbeck and Kisor (1963) used a sample of 135 US stocks and produced the following
regression equation:
PE  8.2  (1.5  earnings growth)  (6.7  dividend payout rate)  (0.2  standard
deviation of earnings)
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
440

[8.2 is referred to as the constant and 1.5,6.7,and 0.2 as the coefﬁcients].Whitbeck and Kisor
claimed that the equation was useful for selecting stocks (buying when the actual PE is below the
PE estimated by the equation on the grounds that the actual stock price was too low – vice versa
when the actual PE is above the estimate).
Malkiel and Cragg (1970) regressed the price-earnings ratio on analysts’ forecasts of earnings
growth rates, estimates of normal earnings, forecasts of future earnings, and expectations of the
future variability of earnings.They concluded that such regression equations were not useful for
selecting stocks.This was because:
1.
The constant and the coefﬁcients varied from year to year (i.e. they were unstable).
2.
Analysts’ forecasts were not accurate.
3.
The equations exclude important ﬁrm-speciﬁc factors.
EXERCISE 21.1
A company has a dividend payout rate of 0.4,the required rate of return on its shares is 12% p.a.,
there is a 2% p.a. expected growth rate of dividends, and earnings per share are forecast to be

Using the formula for the price-earnings ratio that states:

With a price-earnings ratio of 4, and earnings per share forecast at 50p, the fair price of the share
is estimated to be:

At £40 the share appears to be underpriced and hence should be regarded as a potential

EXERCISE 21.3
XYZ plc has a constant dividend payout rate of 0.5.The required rate of return is 10% p.a. and
the expected rate of dividend growth is 4% p.a. Earnings during the next year are expected to be
20p per share. (a) Estimate the fair price of the share. (b) Is it possible to be sure that an estimate
of the fair price is accurate?
Answers
(a) The price-earnings ratio may be estimated as:
PE  0.5/(0.1  0.04)  0.5/0.06  8.33
The fair price of the share is then estimated as:
8.33  20p  167p (to the nearest whole number).
(b) There are a number of sources of uncertainty about the accuracy of the estimate.
(i) Only one method of estimating the price-earnings ratio was used, the method based on
the Gordon growth model. Other methods such as sector average, historical average,
or regression analysis may have given different answers.
(ii) All of the variables used are subject to uncertainty in their estimation.The dividend payout
rate, the required rate of return, the growth rate of dividends, and the future level of
earnings cannot be known with certainty.They are estimated on the basis of past values
and judgement. Personal judgement is fallible and the past may not be a reliable guide to
the future. Besides, the statistical methods for estimating future values from past values
provide distributions of possible values rather than speciﬁc numbers.The required rate of
return is derived from a model such as the capital asset pricing model,which may not be
a very reliable model on which to base estimates.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
The earnings-per-share ratio can be broken down into two other ratios.These are return on equity
and book-value-per-share.Thus:
Earnings-per-Share  Distributable Earnings/Number of Shares
(Distributable Earnings/Stockholder’s Equity) (Stockholder’s Equity/Number of Shares)
The ratio Distributable Earnings/Stockholder’s Equity is the return on equity (ROE).
Distributable earnings are the earnings (proﬁts) available for distribution to shareholders.
The second ratio, Stockholder’s Equity/Number of Shares, is the book-value-per-share.
The number of shares typically means the number of ordinary shares.
The return on equity ratio can be broken down into two other ratios.These are the return on
assets (ROA) and the asset/equity ratio.The return on assets ratio is:
Distributable Earnings/Total Assets
The Asset/Equity ratio is:
Total Assets/Stockholder’s Equity.
The return on equity is thus calculated as:
ROE  ROA  (Asset/Equity).
The return on assets (ROA) can be seen as the product of two further ratios, these being the
proﬁt margin and the turnover-of-assets.
ROA  Proﬁt Margin  Turnover of Assets
where
Proﬁt Margin  Distributable Earnings/Sales
and
Turnover of Assets  Sales/Total Assets.
DIVIDEND YIELD, EARNINGS YIELD, AND ROCE
Dividend yield is the dividend per share divided by the share price.The dividend yield shows the
income (cash ﬂow) obtained by the investor but ignores the capital gain that accrues as a result of
a rise (or fall) in the share price.
RATIO ANALYSIS
443

Earnings yield is earnings (proﬁts) divided by market capitalisation (which is the share price
times the number of shares).It is alternatively measured as earnings per share divided by the share
price.Earnings yield reﬂects the potential for capital gains as well as dividends.If a ﬁrm pays a small
proportion of its earnings as dividends but invests a high proportion to expand the ﬁrm,the result
may be faster growth and a consequent rise in the share price.
ROCE (return on capital employed) is earnings divided by the total capital.Total capital includes
both market capitalisation (value of shares issued) and long-term debt (value of bonds issued).
ROCE is a measure of the percentage return on the total capital used by a ﬁrm.An investor could
compare this return with the yield on alternative investments such as government bonds.When
interpreting earnings yield and ROCE, an investor should take note as to whether the earnings
ﬁgures being used are pre-tax or after-tax.
OTHER MARKET RATIOS
Ratios that entail the share price or market capitalisation may be referred to as market ratios.The
price-earnings ratio is a market ratio. Market ratios that can be used in addition to the price-
earnings ratio are the price/cash-ﬂow ratio and the EV/ebitda ratio.To calculate the price/cash-
ﬂow ratio it is necessary to ascertain free cash-ﬂow.
To obtain a ﬁgure for free cash-ﬂow, depreciation and amortisation charges (and any other
charges that are book entries rather than cash expenses) are added to proﬁts after interest and tax
paid.From this ﬁgure,maintenance capital spending (spending needed to maintain capital) should
be subtracted.The ﬁgure needs to be adjusted to recognise that proﬁts resulting from changes in
unpaid invoices or stock levels do not provide cash-ﬂow.Division of free cash-ﬂow by the number
of shares issued gives free cash-ﬂow per share.Division of the share price by the free cash-ﬂow per
share produces the price/cash-ﬂow ratio.
EV is an abbreviation for enterprise value,which is market capitalisation plus debt minus cash.
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation. It is calculated by
adding back interest,depreciation,and amortisation (amortisation is the depreciation of intangible
assets) to pre-tax proﬁt.
Three other ratios that may be used by investment analysts are the price-to-book, price-to-
liquidation, and price-to-sales ratios.
The price-to-book ratio is:
Share price/Book-value-per-share
where book-value-per-share is:
Shareholders’ funds/Number of shares
Shareholders’funds amount to the ﬁrm’s assets minus its liabilities.Book value is alternatively
known as net asset value. (The book-to-market ratio is the inverse of the price-to-book ratio, i.e.
book-value-per-share/share price.)
The price-to-liquidation ratio is:
Share price/Liquidation value per share
where liquidation value per share is:
Liquidation value/Number of shares
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
444

The liquidation value is the sum expected from selling the ﬁrm’s assets and repaying its debts.
The liquidation value per share is based on the ﬁrm going out of business and may be regarded as
the minimum value of the share.
The price-to-sales ratio is:
Share price/Sales per share
The price-to-sales ratio may be used where a ﬁrm has no earnings. It could be used as an
alternative to the price-earnings ratio for new ﬁrms that have yet to generate any proﬁts, or for
ﬁrms that are performing too badly to be proﬁtable.
FINANCIAL ADEQUACY RATIOS
Three sets of ratios are used as indicators of the ability of a ﬁrm to meet its ﬁnancial obligations.
First, ﬁnancial leverage ratios show the extent to which the ﬁrm is ﬁnanced by debt. Second,
coverage ratios assess the ability of the ﬁrm to meet the obligations arising from its debts.Third,
short-term solvency ratios indicate the ability of the ﬁrm to repay debts becoming due over the
coming year.
Financial Leverage (Gearing) Ratios
Debt provides risk for a company since servicing of the debt must be undertaken whatever the
operational proﬁtability of that company.There is a possibility that operational proﬁts are insufﬁcient
to meet debt interest and repayments with the result that the ﬁrm becomes bankrupt.This risk
rises with increased importance of debt in the ﬁnancing of the ﬁrm;that is with increased leverage.
(Debt arises from bank loans and the sale of bonds.The sale of shares does not constitute debt;the
ﬁrm has no legally binding commitment to make payments to shareholders.)
There are many forms of ﬁnancial leverage ratio.Two possibilities are as follows:
Long-Term Debt to Equity  Long-term debt/Shareholders’ equity and
Total Debt to Equity  (Long-term debt  Current liabilities)/Shareholders’ equity
Long-term debt is debt that is repayable more than a year into the future and current liabilities
constitute debt that matures in a year or less. Long-term debt includes bonds issued by the ﬁrm.
For the purposes of the ratios, bonds are usually valued at book value. Book value is the price at
which the bonds were originally sold. Shareholder’s equity is the total value of all the shares held
by shareholders.Often each ratio is calculated twice,once using the original issue price of the shares
and once using the current market price of the shares.High ratios indicate high leverage and hence
risk. Ratios may alternatively divide debt by shareholders’ equity plus debt.
Coverage Ratios
Coverage ratios are concerned with the assessment of the ability of a ﬁrm to meet interest and other
inescapable payments.They relate the resources available for the payments to the level of payments
due.The interest coverage (or debt coverage) ratio is:
(Earnings  Interest charges paid)/Interest charges paid
RATIO ANALYSIS
445

Since earnings are quoted net of interest payments,it is necessary to add the interest payments
back in order to ascertain the total sum available for the payment of interest.
A more comprehensive coverage ratio that takes lease payments into account is the ﬁxed-charge
coverage ratio which is:
Short-Term Solvency Ratios
Before buying a stock an investor might wish to feel sure that liquidity problems are not likely to
appear.Four of the ratios that may be calculated in order to assess the adequacy of a ﬁrm’s working
capital are the current ratio, the acid-test ratio, the inventory-turnover ratio, and the accounts-
receivable-turnover ratio.
The current ratio is shown as:
Current ratio  Current assets/Current liabilities
Current assets are assets either in the form of cash,or due to be converted into cash during the
coming year (i.e. liquid assets). Current liabilities are either payable already, or due to be payable
in the coming year.The current ratio thus provides an assessment of the company’s ability to meet
its immediate liabilities.
Current assets include inventories, and in some circumstances there may be difﬁculty in
converting inventories into cash.The acid-test ratio (alternatively known as the quick ratio or
liquid asset ratio) recognises this by removing inventories from current assets.
Acid-Test Ratio  (Current assets  Inventories)/Current liabilities
The inventory-turnover ratio indicates the speed with which inventories can be converted into
cash.The accounts-receivable-turnover ratio shows how quickly the ﬁrm’s customers pay their bills.
These factors also affect the ability of the ﬁrm to meet its commitments.
Z SCORES
Altman (1968) generated a Z score, which uses ﬁnancial ratios to produce a number which is
purported to provide a method of gauging whether a company is likely to fail in the short or medium
term. Ratio 1 is the ratio of working capital to total assets. Ratio 2 is the ratio of accumulated
retained earnings to total assets.The third ratio is that of ebit (earnings before interest and taxes)
to total assets. Ratio 4 is market capitalisation to total liabilities. Ratio 5 is sales to total assets.
For publicly listed companies (i.e. companies whose shares are traded on a stock exchange):
Z  (1.2  Ratio 1)  (1.4  Ratio 2)  (3.3  Ratio 3)  (0.6  Ratio 4) 
(1.0  Ratio 5)
A healthy company should have a Z score of 2.99 or more;an unhealthy one a score of 1.81 or
less.Some would take the view that the direction of change in the Z score is more important than
the current value.
Earnings  Interest charges paid  Lease payments

Interest charges paid  Lease payments
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
446

Other analysts have used different ratios and weightings.For example Marais (1982) developed
a Z score for UK companies. Four ratios were used. Ratio 1 was the ratio of pre-tax proﬁt plus
depreciation to current liabilities.Ratio 2 was that of current assets less stocks to current liabilities.
The third ratio was that of total borrowing to total capital employed less intangibles. Ratio 4 was
stocks to sales.
There are drawbacks to the use of Z scores. One drawback is that the method is not suitable
for some types of company, namely utilities, property companies, and companies in the banking,
insurance,and ﬁnancial sectors.A second drawback is that Z scores tend to favour long-established
companies relative to new ones. A third problem is that some of the accounting values are
capable of manipulation by management; at the least differences in accounting practices will
inﬂuence ratios.
There is empirical evidence that Z scores are useful for predicting bankruptcies,and for helping
investors to choose shares that will perform well (and avoid those that will perform badly). Such
evidence comes from Altman (1968), Altman et al. (1977), Tafﬂer (1983, 1997), Clark and
Weinstein (1983),Aharony et al. (1980),and Katz et al. (1985).However there is no economic or
accounting theory underlying the models, which can be accused of data mining.There are those
who doubt the usefulness of the models, for example Pratt (1993) and Zavgren et al. (1988).
RATIOS AS INDICATORS OF GENERAL MARKET MOVEMENTS
Ratios can be used not only for analysing individual stocks but also for forecasting movements in
the stock market as a whole. Bleiberg (1989) sorted quarterly US price-earnings ratios for the
period 1938–87 into quintiles (top 20%, second 20%, etc.). He found that periods of low price-
earnings ratios were followed,on average,by strong market performance whilst periods with high
ratios tended to be followed by poor performance.For example periods when the ratio was in the
bottom 20% were followed,on average,by market rises of 29.79% over the following two years.
Periods when the ratio was in the top 20% were followed, on average, by falls of 0.68% over the
subsequent two years.
Bierman (2002) suggested that the price-earnings ratio would have more explanatory power if
it were adjusted for liabilities and cash holdings. If companies have debts, buyers of shares accept
responsibility for those debts.The value of a debt,per share,should be added to the share price to
obtain an effective purchase price.The share price used in the price-earnings ratio should be the
market price plus the value of the debt, which the buyer of the share is committed to paying.
Conversely the presence of cash holdings effectively reduces the share price since part of the
purchase price of the share could be returned to the shareholder.
The appropriate measure for earnings per share is also controversial. It is often suggested
that the earnings in a single year are not appropriate since they reﬂect temporary factors such
as the position in the business cycle, and that a cyclically adjusted measure of earnings per share
should be used. Harney and Tower (2003) found that, for the purpose of predicting stock
market performance,earnings averaged over long periods were more useful than the most recent
earnings ﬁgures.
Asness (2005) used the average real earnings over the previous ten years to produce price-
earnings ratios for the S&P 500 over the period 1927–2004. For each rolling ten-year period
(1927–36, 1928–37, 1929–38, etc.) the initial price-earnings ratio was compared with the real
RATIO ANALYSIS
447

return over the following ten years. It was found that subsequent returns were inversely related
to the initial price-earnings ratios.With initial price-earnings ratios of less than 10.1 the average
(median) annual return was 10.9%, whereas for initial price-earnings ratios above 19.9 the
subsequent average annual return was 0.1%.
Market yield (the ratio of dividends to share prices) also appears to bear some relationship to
subsequent market performance.Campbell and Shiller (1998) found that in the US market yields
were indicative of market movements over the following ten years.A period with a high dividend
yield tended to be followed by a strong market performance over the following ten years.
They found a similar relationship in a number of other countries.
The use of the stock market’s dividend yield as an indicator of subsequent market performance
suffers from problems. One of these problems is that some companies repurchase shares instead
of paying dividends.The repurchase of shares is an alternative to dividends as a means of transferring
money to shareholders.Another problem is that some companies do not pay dividends, choosing
to reinvest proﬁts instead.A change in the proportion of companies following such a practice can
impact on the market dividend yield although the dividend yield of other companies may remain
unchanged.
THE YIELD GAP, THE YIELD RATIO, AND ‘THE FED MODEL’
The yield gap is a long-standing approach to rating equities (shares) relative to bonds.It is expressed
either as:
Yield gap  dividend yield  gilt yield or as:
Yield gap  gilt yield  dividend yield
The gilt yield is usually measured as the redemption yield on long-dated gilts (UK government
bonds) and the dividend yield is measured as the stock market’s dividend payments divided by the
aggregate value of shares.
One problem with this approach is that, whereas the gilt redemption yield is the whole
return on gilts, the dividend yield is not the whole return from equities.To obtain the whole
return on equities, in money terms, it is necessary to add the real rate of capital growth and
the rate of inﬂation (the product of these amounts to the capital growth in money terms) to
the rate of dividend yield.Whilst the real rate of capital growth varies little over time, inﬂation
can vary substantially. In consequence changes in the yield gap are more indicative of variations
in inﬂation rates than of relative real returns.The gilt yield incorporates the expected rate of
inﬂation whereas the dividend yield does not. Investment rules may suggest that investors should
switch from shares to bonds if the gilt yield rises relative to the dividend yield. However such a
guide to investment is not valid if the relative rise in the gilt yield merely reﬂects higher expected
inﬂation.
The same argument concerning inﬂation relates to the yield ratio.This is the ratio of the
redemption yield on gilts to the dividend yield on shares.Whilst a high ratio is seen as indicative
of a strong performance from gilts relative to shares, and hence as a sign to favour gilts against
shares, it may simply reﬂect expected inﬂation rates. Despite this reservation some studies have
found that the yield ratio does have some value as an indicator of future relative investment
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
448

performance between equities and gilts (Wadhwani and Shah 1993; Clare et al. 1994; Levin and
Wright 1998).
The yield gap, and yield ratio, can alternatively be expressed in relation to index-linked gilts.
This eliminates the distortions introduced by inﬂation.The gilt yield and dividend yield would
now both be expressed in real terms.The only remaining lack of comparability would come
from the fact that capital growth should be added to dividend yield in order to obtain the total
real return from equities,whilst the redemption yield on index-linked gilts constitutes their entire
real return.
Another possibility is to compare the redemption yield on gilts with the inverse of the price-
earnings ratio of the aggregate stock market.This approach is popular in the United States where
it is referred to as ‘The Fed Model’,despite the absence of evidence that the Federal Reserve uses
it.The earnings yield (the reciprocal of the price-earnings ratio) is compared with the redemption
yield on government bonds.Either the difference between them,or their ratio,can be used.If the
difference or ratio is at variance from the expected value,it may be concluded that the general level
of the stock market is incorrect.The analyst may then ascertain the change in the level of stock
prices required to move the earnings yield into the appropriate relationship with the redemption
yield on government bonds.However this is based on the assumption that the mispricing is in the
stock market rather than the government bond market. It is also subject to the criticism that the
redemption yield on government bonds comprises compensation for inﬂation as well as a real rate
of return,whereas the earnings yield is purely a real yield.A change in the government bond yield
caused by a change in expectations of inﬂation should not imply a change in the earnings yield since
stocks would compensate for inﬂation by way of increased price appreciation.
Consider equation 4 again:
P/eps  (D/eps)/(rg)
(4)
where P is the stock price,eps is earnings per share,D/eps is the dividend payout rate,r is the
required rate of return,and g is the expected growth rate of dividends.An increase in the yield on
government bonds raises r and lowers P/eps,but if the rise in government bond yields (and hence
r) is the result of higher expected inﬂation there should be an offsetting rise in g.The increase in
the discount rate could be matched by a rise in the expected growth rate of dividends (and hence
growth rate of stock prices).The failure to recognise the need to adjust g is referred to as inﬂation
illusion and can lead to mispricing of equities in the aggregate (Asness 2003; Campbell and
Vuolteenaho 2004a; Feinman 2005).
PROBLEMS WITH RATIO ANALYSIS
Care needs to be taken when using ratios for investment analysis. One source of difﬁculty is that
companies use differing accounting methods in the measurement of earnings and other values.
Reported values would be affected by accounting practices. Variations in ratios between
companies may reﬂect differences in accounting methods rather than more fundamental
differences.Also differences in reporting dates can reduce the usefulness of ratios for comparing
companies.The aggregation of accounts across a group of companies can hide the problems of
some subsidiaries within the group.
RATIO ANALYSIS
449

The effects of differences in accounting practices would be particularly extreme where creative
accounting is used. Creative accounting involves the deliberate abuse of the subjectivity inherent
in accounting to select accounting policies or make assumptions in order to bias the ﬁgures in the
direction chosen by management.At a less extreme level ﬁgures could be distorted by window
dressing,for example advancing or delaying transactions so that they are included in,or excluded
from, the end of year accounts.
Looked at from the viewpoint of some ﬁnancial ratios a ﬁrm may be seen as healthy while
other ratios may indicate that it is not healthy.There is no established means of weighting the
relative importance of different ratios.There will therefore be ambiguity with regard to the
evaluation of the company.Also some analysts believe that it is the direction of change in the ratios,
rather than the current values of the ratios, that reveals most about a company. Such analysts take
the view that trends in ratios over a number of years are more important than their values in a
particular year.
There is a risk that the focus on ratios distracts the analyst from the multitude of other factors
that are pertinent to the potential success of a company. It should also be borne in mind that the
past is not necessarily a reliable guide to the future. A company may be successful because
it responds to poor ﬁnancial ratios by reorganising its structure and procedures.
It is important not to confuse a good company with a good investment. Firms with strong
ratios,robust earnings growth,good sales potential,and quality management are good companies.
If all these positive attributes are fully (or more than fully) reﬂected in the share price, the share
is not necessarily a good investment. Good investments are shares that increase in price more
than other shares (Solt and Statman 1989).A good investment is a share whose price inadequately
reﬂects its value. Such an undervalued share may be from a good company or a weak one.
An undervalued share provides gains when its value becomes fully realised. Counter-intuitively
good companies may be the worse investments if it is the case that many investors confuse
good ﬁrms with good investments and hence buy the shares of good ﬁrms, thereby driving up
their prices too far.
FOLLOWING PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT ANALYSTS
As an alternative to carrying out investment analysis themselves, individual investors may
choose to follow the recommendations of professional analysts. Analysts typically possess
better information, about a company, than private investors.Their assessments of companies,
and of the prospective earnings of those companies, might be expected to be superior to that
of non-professionals.The analyses that are made public are those of stockbrokers and investment
banks. A purpose of making them public is to attract business from investors. Stockbroker and
investment bank analysts are known as sell-side analysts. Institutional investors also use invest-
ment analysts, who are referred to as buy-side analysts.The opinions of buy-side analysts are
not made public.
Analysts will make earnings predictions, which may be useful to investors who use price-
earnings ratios when making investment decisions.Analysts also make trading recommendations
as to whether particular shares should be bought or sold.Private investors may choose to base their
decisions on the recommendations of analysts. One problem that arises is that it may be difﬁcult
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
450

to interpret and compare the recommendations of different analysts.There is a lack of consistency
in the terminology used.There are also sources of ambiguity.To what investment horizon does
a recommendation relate? What expected percentage outperformance is a buy recommendation
based on?
Another difﬁculty faced by individual investors relates to the timeliness of recommendations.
Analysis is not static.Analysts constantly review their opinions as new information becomes available.
Their big clients may be phoned or e-mailed to inform them of updates to recommendations.The
general public is not likely to receive such updates. Private investors who follow analysts’
recommendations may be using out-of-date recommendations.
Another source of uncertainty faced by individual investors concerns the accuracy of the
predictions and recommendations of professional analysts. In terms of predictions of earnings,
analysts are often thought to be a little conservative (e.g. Degeorge et al. 1999).This is because
company managements like to beat the earnings estimates,and this is more readily achieved if the
estimates are low. Analysts like to please company managements on the grounds that access to
information would be more readily provided.
It is unclear whether professional analysts are any good at stock selection.The studies referred
to in Part 7 on market efﬁciency tend to suggest that either there is no ability to pick winners, or
that the gains from picking winners are eliminated by transaction costs.For example Barber et al.
(2001) found that if an investor without transaction costs bought stocks recommended as a ‘strong
buy’during 1985 to 1996 and held them until the rating was downgraded,the investor would have
outperformed the market.However when transaction costs are considered,the investor would have
underperformed the market.
Francis et al. (2004) found that analysts’forecasts of earnings were more accurate than forecasts
produced by the mechanical application of earnings models. However they reported that the
earnings forecasts of analysts tended to be too optimistic in that their forecasts overestimated
earnings.They also reported a common cognitive bias, which appeared to reduce the ability of
analysts to fully incorporate new information when revising earnings forecasts with the result that
there was underreaction to new information.This cognitive bias is consistent with the conservatism
and anchoring biases identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance.
Cornell (2001),in a study of Intel,threw doubt on the usefulness of the recommendations and
forecasts of investment analysts.It was observed that a negative announcement regarding revenue
caused a fall in the stock price of about 30%.Cornell concluded that this was an overreaction such
that the stock could not have been accurately priced both before, and after, the announcement.
Following Intel’s announcement of lower expected revenue growth a number of analysts lowered
their buy/sell recommendations, which seems perverse if the stock price was either too high
before the announcement or too low after it.A change from sell to buy recommendations might
have been expected. No analyst raised their recommendation. Cornell examined a number of
analysts’ reports on Intel and found that none contained sufﬁcient detail to determine what the
analysis was based on.
One source of doubt about the accuracy of analysts’ recommendations is the relative absence
of recommendations to sell. Overwhelmingly recommendations are positive or neutral; they are
rarely negative.Yet one might expect recommendations to be approximately evenly spread between
buy, neutral, and sell. It seems likely that this imbalance arises from conﬂicts of interest. One
RATIO ANALYSIS
451

conﬂict of interest arises from the need for access to information from the management of a ﬁrm
whose shares are being analysed.Analysts may be reluctant to give negative recommendations for
fear that an annoyed management will cease to be accommodating in relation to the provision of
information. Francis et al. (2004) cite anecdotal evidence indicating that analysts who produce
unfavourable forecasts of earnings experience reprisals by way of blocked or withheld
communications with corporate managers.
Analysts at investment banks have another source of conﬂicts of interest. The companies
whose shares are being analysed may be clients (or potential clients) of the investment banking
arm of the bank. A poor stock recommendation by an analyst could result in the loss of the
company as a client for investment banking services. The investment banking people may
put pressure on analysts with a view to encouraging positive recommendations. Evidence
consistent with such a conﬂict of interest is provided by Michaely and Womack (1999) and by
Francis et al.
Investment bankers are not the only source of pressure. Gibson (2004) suggests that analysts
in both stockbroking and investment banking ﬁrms face pressure from equity clients and traders.
If a stockbroker (or investment bank) has clients with large holdings of a particular share, those
clients would be unhappy to ﬁnd that an analyst working for the stockbroker downgrades the
recommendation on the share. A recommendation downgrade is likely to result in a fall in the
share price.For similar reasons traders working for the stockbroker or investment bank might be
upset by a downgrade. Some institutional investors, particularly hedge funds, pay their fund
managers on a performance-linked basis.Such managers may see pressure on analysts to improve
recommendations as a means of raising the performance of shares held in their funds.Analysts are
likely to come under pressure from clients and traders to maintain a positive recommendation on
a share.
Investors following the recommendations of analysts should also appreciate the motivations of
those analysts.A signiﬁcant portion of an analyst’s pay is based on reputation (Kim and Nofsinger
2004; Gibson 2004). For example institutional investors conduct annual surveys in which they
evaluate analysts.There is a risk that analysts focus more on promoting themselves than on working
on their analyses.
Investment analysts can be expected to exhibit a wide variety of opinions about the fair
prices of shares.There are many techniques and models for valuing shares (various dividend
discount models, abnormal earnings models, ﬁnancial ratios, and so forth).There are also many
sources of data.At numerous points judgement is required as to which techniques or models to
use,which data to use,how to interpret the data,how to analyse the data,and so forth.The results
of statistical analysis are affected by the choice of time periods and observation intervals.
The results of analysis are also affected by the choice of capital market theory to be used (the one-
factor capital asset pricing model, multi-factor capital asset pricing models, arbitrage pricing
theory, and so forth).With so much judgement involved it is to be expected that there would
be a wide variety of opinions amongst investment analysts about what share prices should be.It is
also clear that there is plenty of scope for manipulating the results of investment analysis for the
purpose of achieving desired forecasts and recommendations.The chapters in Part 7 dealing with
evidence relating to market efﬁciency discuss other studies concerning the usefulness of analysts’
recommendations.

CONCLUSION
Financial ratios have been one of the most favoured tools of investment analysis for a long time.
They provide a means of interpreting company accounts,and constitute a step towards an objective
analysis of accounting information.They can shed light on a number of characteristics of a company,
such as its proﬁtability, its ﬁnancial strength, and its ability to provide a ﬂow of dividends to
shareholders.They can also indicate whether the stock market as a whole is fairly priced,particularly
relative to other investment assets such as bonds.
Ratio analysis does not provide an entirely objective and reliable means of investment analysis.
Ratios are derived from company accounts.The ﬁgures used in the construction of ratios are likely
to be inﬂuenced by the accounting procedures adopted by the company.To the extent that subjective
judgement is used in the production of accounts, that subjectivity will affect ratios derived from
the accounts.There is no established way of ranking the importance of different ratios, so if they
give contradictory messages the analyst must make subjective judgements. Although individual
ratios may seem to give unambiguous messages, the aggregate of ratios can give very ambiguous
information. In the presence of ambiguity, the psychological biases described in the chapters on
behavioural ﬁnance (especially Chapters 2 and 24) can strongly inﬂuence the reasoning of
investment analysts.
The psychological biases can affect professional analysts, irrespective of their techniques of
analysis.The individual investor may decide to look at the recommendations of the professionals
on the grounds that the professionals have more expertise, resources, and time for investment
analysis. However professionals could be inﬂuenced not only by psychological biases but also by
conﬂicts of interest.They are also likely to be inﬂuenced by each other. People are normally
inﬂuenced by the opinions of others. In the same way analysts are likely to move their forecasts
into line with those of other analysts.There may be a rational reason for this on the grounds that
the other analysts may have based their forecasts on information that is not generally available.
Conformity might, alternatively, be the result of herding behaviour. If you were wrong when
everyone else was wrong,your error may be forgiven.If you were wrong when others were right,
your job may not be secure.

THE NATURE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Technical analysts believe that stock markets have a dynamic of their own,independent of outside
economic forces.Technical analysis is the study of internal stock market information.Any relevant
outside information is seen as being embodied in stock market data so that there is no need to look
for information outside the market.Technical analysts study the market itself, not the external
factors that might be reﬂected in the market prices and volumes.The information produced by the
stock market, particularly in relation to prices and trading volumes, is what technical analysis is
concerned with. Whereas fundamental analysis (such as dividend discount models and ratio
analysis) uses economic data that is usually obtained from sources other than the stock market,
technical analysis uses data from the stock market itself.
Technical analysts base trading decisions on prior price and volume data in order to determine
past market trends and patterns from which predictions of future market behaviour are derived.
Technical analysts usually attempt to forecast short-term price movements.The methodology rests
on the belief that stock market history tends to repeat itself. If a certain pattern of prices and
volumes has previously been followed by particular price movements, it is suggested that a
repetition of that pattern will be followed by similar price movements.Technical analysts assert

that the study of past patterns of variables such as prices and trading volumes allows investors to
identify times when particular stocks (or sectors,or the overall market) are likely to fall or rise in
price.The focus tends to be on the timing of purchases and sales.Most technical analysts use charts
of stock prices (and frequently also data on volumes of buying and selling).
Levy (1966) suggested that technical analysis is based on the following assumptions:
1.
The market price of securities (such as shares and bonds) is determined by supply and demand.
2.
Supply and demand are determined by numerous rational and irrational factors.These include
both objective and subjective factors.
3.
Apart from minor ﬂuctuations the prices of individual securities, and the level of the market
as a whole, tend to move in trends which persist for signiﬁcant periods of time.
4.
Trends change in reaction to shifts in supply and demand.These shifts in supply and demand
can be detected in the action of the market itself.
Assumptions 3 and 4 are controversial.Supporters of the efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH) take
the view that new information is very quickly reﬂected in security prices. If information is very
quickly reﬂected in prices,trends do not have an opportunity to emerge.Technical analysts believe
that new information does not arrive in the market at a single point in time; they take
the view that new information comes to the market over a period of time. For example new
information may be available ﬁrst to insiders, second to professionals, and lastly to the public.
As the information gradually becomes more widely available, the share price gradually moves
to its new equilibrium price.Technical analysts look for the beginning of a movement from
one equilibrium price to another without attempting to predict the new equilibrium price.
They attempt to proﬁt from forecasting the direction of movement;that is they try to identify trends
and proﬁt from them.
Whatever the reason for a change in price,if the share price responds sufﬁciently slowly,a trend
emerges.A slow response of prices to shifts in supply and demand provides the potential to proﬁt
from technical analysis.
BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
An alternative underpinning for the technical analysts’ belief in trends comes from the theories
of behavioural ﬁnance. Batchelor and Ramyar (2006) point to psychologists’ ﬁndings on the
illusion of control. People ﬁnd it difﬁcult to accept that events are random, and will imagine the
existence of patterns among random events. The illusion of control is particularly likely in
circumstances wherein people are expected to maintain an appearance of competence,for example
amongst traders in ﬁnancial markets. Fenton-O’Creevy et al. (2003) reported an experiment in
which professional traders were given the task of using a computer mouse to control the position
of a dot on a computer screen. Changes in the position of the dot were random, the mouse was
not even connected to the computer,but the traders believed that they were inﬂuencing the position
of the dot.
Behavioural ﬁnance suggests that people have a conservatism bias, which causes them to be
slow to update their beliefs in response to new information.They might initially under-react to
news so that prices will fully reﬂect new information only gradually.As a result there is momentum
in stock market movements; in other words trends appear.The disposition effect can also slow
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
455

adjustment to new information and thereby allow trends to emerge as gradual adjustment takes
place.The disposition effect causes investors to be reluctant to sell losing positions. Since stocks
that show loses are sold reluctantly and slowly,the downward price movement is gradual.Gradual
price movement produces a trend.
Other behavioural ﬁnance theories that can explain some types of pattern examined by technical
analysts are ‘sample size neglect’and representativeness.It appears that many people treat a small
sample as being just as indicative as a large one.They may trade on the basis of a short succession
of pieces of news. For example a short run of good company earnings news might cause share
purchases that result in price increases when the length of the run of earnings news is insufﬁcient
to produce statistically signiﬁcant conclusions.A company with a recent short run of good earnings
news may be seen as representative of companies with strong long-run potential.The upward
movement is reversed when the run of good news stops (Chopra et al. 1992). So a pattern of
momentum (trends) and reversals emerges.
Representativeness might be seen as judgement based on stereotypes. The mind makes
the assumption that situations sharing similar characteristics are alike. A long-term upward
price movement starts as a short-term upward price movement. Representativeness causes
investors to assume that a short-term upward move is indicative of a forthcoming long-term
upward trend (conversely for falls). Many investors buy shares that have recently experienced
price rises. Investors like to buy recent winners since they believe that a past price trend
is representative of a future price trend. Dhar and Kumar (2001) found that private investors
tended to buy stocks that had risen in price during the three months prior to purchase. DeBondt
(1993) found that the market forecasts of private investors reﬂected the recent performance
of the market.
There is research indicating that recent stock market performance affects attitude to risk, and
hence the willingness to invest (Shefrin 2000; MacKillop 2003; Grable et al. 2004).A recent rise
in share prices makes investors more risk tolerant, and hence more prepared to invest.A recent
fall raises risk-aversion, and hence creates an inclination to sell.These changes in attitude to risk
reinforce existing market movements, and thereby perpetuate trends. Price rises lead to share
purchases and hence to further price rises; price falls result in sales which further depress prices.
Momentum,the tendency for a market to continue to move in the current direction,is reinforced
by changes in attitude to risk.
The sample size neglect bias (alternatively known as the law of small numbers) is associated with
the ‘gambler’s fallacy’.The gambler’s fallacy is the belief that if numbers appear at random, there
is some mechanism that ensures that each number appears on the same number of occasions
(Nofsinger 2002a).There is a belief that a self-correcting mechanism exists to ensure this. For
example people affected by the gambler’s fallacy might expect that since the number 17 has not
been drawn in a lottery for several weeks,it is likely to be drawn next time.Of course the likelihood
of it being drawn continues to be based on a random process;the past frequency has no signiﬁcance
for future occurrences.The gambler’s fallacy may help to explain the reversal patterns that technical
analysts look for.It may be the case that investors who are subject to the gambler’s fallacy feel that
a succession of rises must soon be followed by falls, or vice versa. If the gambler’s fallacy leads to
the belief that rises and falls are approximately equal in number, investors subject to this bias will
tend to sell after a few rises (or buy after a few falls).Their trades may then cause the price reversals
they expect.
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
456

Representativeness may help to explain the trends that technical analysts attempt to exploit.
Technical analysts might be regarded as seeking to proﬁt from the psychological biases, such as
representativeness, of other investors. However technical analysts could also be subject to
psychological biases.If representativeness is based on the assumption that situations sharing similar
characteristics are alike,technical analysts who look for standard chart patterns that indicate future
share price changes may be inﬂuenced by the representativeness bias.Looking for chart patterns that
are repetitions of previous patterns might be looking for stereotypes on which to base judgements.
The proposition that markets exhibit trends may be interpreted as a view that markets have
memory.Today’s price behaves as if the market remembers previous price movements.This might
be justiﬁed by observing that investors and traders have memories; and the market comprises
investors and traders. Fenton-O’Creevy et al. (2005) point out that a residue of emotion and
reasoning is carried forward from one investment decision to the next.If a feeling of optimism or
pessimism has been engendered by investments,the feeling will impact on subsequent investment
decisions.
Benartzi and Thaler (1995) suggest that the reference price is the share price that an investor
compares to the current share price.Investors anchor on their reference prices in that they measure
proﬁts and losses in relation to the reference price. It may be the case that a large number of
investors, in a share, anchor on the same reference price; for example the highest price reached
over the previous 12 months.This imparts memory to the market, which effectively remembers
the reference price.This could help to explain the concept of trading ranges,which are much used
by technical analysts.A trading range entails a price ﬂuctuating around a central value,and within
limits (the limits are known as support and resistance levels).The central value of a trading range
may correspond to the reference price.
Zielonka (2004) gave support to the view that behavioural ﬁnance can provide a rationale for
technical analysis.A sample of technical analysts was presented with a number of technical analysis
rules.The rules were of three types.Some were rules already used by technical analysts (and which
could be explained in terms of behavioural ﬁnance principles).The second set of rules was invented
by the researcher,and the rules were based on behavioural ﬁnance principles.The third set of rules
was invented by the researcher, and was not based on principles of behavioural ﬁnance.The
technical analysts saw the ﬁrst two sets of rules as having high predictive power.The third set of
rules was seen as having low predictive power. In other words the technical analysis rules based
upon, and explicable in terms of, behavioural ﬁnance were seen as having strong predictive value
whereas the rules not based on behavioural ﬁnance were not.
Behavioural ﬁnance can be used to explain the use of volume data by technical analysts.
The evidence on overconﬁdence indicates that overconﬁdence is associated with high volumes
of trading, and that overconﬁdence is also associated with rising stock prices.
PRICE CHARTS
The following exposition aims to describe some of the more frequently used charts.
Figure 22.1 shows a bar chart.For each day,or other chosen time interval,there is a vertical line.
The top of the vertical line indicates the highest price reached during the day and the bottom shows
the lowest price.There is a short horizontal line on each vertical line.This horizontal line indicates
the closing price on the day. Japanese candlestick charts also indicate the opening price. Marshall

et al. (2006) examined the proﬁtability of Japanese candlestick technical analysis using the stocks
that comprised the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the period 1992–2002.They found that the
candlestick trading strategies were not proﬁtable;the candlestick analysis lacked predictive power.
Figure 22.2 illustrates a line chart. It involves daily closing prices joined by straight lines to
make a graph.

Figure 22.3 illustrates a point-and-ﬁgure chart.A price interval is decided upon, for example
10p.For every successive one-interval increase in price,an X is entered in the same column (going
upwards).If the stock price falls by 10p from a previous high,an O is entered in the next column.
Each successive 10p price decline is then indicated by a O (going downwards) in the same column.
When the price rises by 10p above the lowest price,an X is entered in the next column.An unusual
aspect of point-and-ﬁgure charts is that although the horizontal axis plots time,it is not in regular
intervals of time.
One aim is to ﬁnd areas where price reversals are frequent since this is seen as presaging a
substantial price movement (break out from a trading range).This would appear as a horizontal
stretching out of the chart.
CHART PATTERNS
There are a vast number of chart patterns employed by technical analysts.What follows is merely
indicative of some of the patterns. Line charts will be used for the examples.
Price Channels (Trend Channels)
Figure 22.4 illustrates a rising trend channel.The share price remains within the channel shown
by the upward sloping parallel lines until point A. At point A, it breaks out of the channel in a
downward direction.The chartist may interpret this as a signal to sell the stock since it is seen as
forecasting a fall in the stock price.Trend channels could also be horizontal or downward sloping.
In these cases a breakout in the upward direction could be seen as indicative of a price rise, and
would therefore be a buy signal. Horizontal trend channels with parallel bounds are sometimes
referred to as trading ranges.
Behavioural ﬁnance provides reasons for thinking that trends are possible.Conservatism suggests
that investors do not respond quickly to new information, since they take time to change their
opinions in the light of new evidence. In consequence price adjustments to new information may

be gradual, and gradual adjustments provide trends. Conﬁrmation bias, the tendency to give too
little weight to evidence that contradicts an existing opinion, reinforces conservatism.Another
source of an emerging trend may be the disposition effect, this is the preference for selling an
investment that is showing a proﬁt rather than one that is making a loss.This could hamper upward
price adjustments and delay downward price movements.Price adjustments are thus slowed with
the result that trends appear (Grinblatt and Han 2001).
Once a trend has started representativeness and overconﬁdence could render it persistent.
Representativeness can lead investors to believe that recent price movements are indicative of the
future direction of price movements; it thus induces buying in a rising market and selling in a
falling one.The result is positive feedback trading (buying because prices have risen and selling
because they have fallen) which reinforces price trends.Overconﬁdence causes investors to forget
that markets are uncertain and to believe too ﬁrmly in their forecasting powers.An overconﬁdent
investor may be inclined to invest (or disinvest) heavily on the basis of a view arising from
representativeness.
The lines constituting the bounds of a trading range are not necessarily parallel. Figure 22.5
illustrates a triangle. In this case converging lines bound the series of stock prices.The upward
breakout at point A might be interpreted as an indication of subsequent price rises.
Price channels are often interpreted in terms of the bounds providing limits to the extent of
variation of share prices, such that share prices tend to remain within the bounds.The rationale
may be in terms of investors seeing share prices as being too high when they rise above the higher
bound (so shares are sold and as a result prices fall) and too low when they fall below the lower
bound (so that investors buy and thereby push prices back up into the channel). It may be that
investors who regret not having sold before the previous price fall regard a rise to the upper bound
as providing a good selling opportunity, and investors who regret not having bought prior to the
price rise see a price fall as providing a good buying opportunity. Such an interpretation would

see the upper bound as a resistance level and the lower bound as a support level.These patterns
may be based on horizontal price channels (trading ranges).Figure 22.6 illustrates such a channel.
However sometimes the lower bound is seen as the resistance level,and the upper bound as the
support level. Such support and resistance patterns may be based on the premise that people
remember past share prices and may regret lost opportunities.Users of this approach suggest that
for a period of time stock prices trade within the range bounded by the support and resistance
levels. If the share price breaks out of the range in an upward direction people who had not
previously bought regret not having done so.As a result they would buy if the price re-enters the
trading range.There would be buying at the top of the trading range,the support level.This buying
will tend to prevent the share price falling below the support level.
If the stock price falls below the bottom of the trading range, the investor regrets not having
sold. Investors decide to sell if they can do so within the trading range. If the stock price returns
to the trading range, many investors will sell.The bottom of the trading range becomes an upper
limit to the share price.This is the resistance level.If the share price rises above the resistance level,
many investors will sell with the result that prices fall.
It could be the case that the upper price is seen as the resistance level and the lower price as the
support level,until the price makes a signiﬁcant move out of the trading range.When that happens,
the upper price level becomes the support or the lower price level becomes the resistance.Support
and resistance levels reﬂect a market memory,which allows past price history to inﬂuence current
price prospects.
If sufﬁcient traders took the same view about the resistance and support levels of prices, the
resistance and support levels could become self-fulﬁlling prophecies.Resistance and support levels

emerge because traders believe in their existence and trade accordingly.The shared opinion might
arise from the social inﬂuences identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance.People in a group have a tendency
to conform to each others’ opinions.Traders constitute a group of people who interact with one
another and form shared opinions.Those shared opinions may include resistance and support levels.
Resistance and support levels could also be explained in terms of the behavioural ﬁnance concept
of anchoring.Faced with uncertainty,which is frequently the case in ﬁnancial markets,people will
tend to anchor on numbers presented to them.Those numbers become benchmarks against which
prices are compared. If a trader is presented with resistance and support price levels, anchoring
could cause that trader to treat those levels as benchmarks.Trading is then conducted in relation
to those benchmarks.
Another possible explanation comes from the observation of price-end biases.There is evidence
that investors favour price quotes ending in 0 or 5, most particularly 0. In the absence of a bias,
each of the ten end numbers would experience approximately 10% of quotes.Varki et al. (2006)
found that more than 25% of price quotes ended in 0.One explanation lies in the reduction of the
‘cost of thinking’ (Shugan 1980). Investors trade off the beneﬁts of accuracy against the mental
cost of achieving that accuracy.Estelami (1999) found that cognitive difﬁculty is a function of price
ends, with price ends of 0 requiring the least computational effort. Despite their greater use of
sophisticated investment analysis techniques, the professional investors managing institutional
investments are prone to the price-end bias as well as private investors.
The microstructure of stock markets provides a means of introducing the price-end bias into
share prices. In particular many orders to buy or sell are limit orders. Limit orders to buy specify
purchase at a stated price, or a lower price if possible. Limit orders to sell specify sale at a stated
price,or a higher price.An investor making a market order (an order that does not specify a price)
to buy would be matched against the best limit order to sell.A market order to sell is matched
against the most favourable limit order to buy. Many trades entail triggering limit orders. If the
limit orders tend to have price endings of 0, many trades will be at prices ending in 0.
If the price-end bias results in limit orders that specify prices ending in 0, there may be a
tendency for prices to oscillate between prices ending in 0. Market orders to buy would push
prices up until the limit orders to sell at a price ending in 0 are triggered. Market orders to sell
push prices down until the market orders are matched against limit orders to buy at a price ending
in 0. Share prices would move between two prices, each ending in 0, with limit orders serving to
prevent prices moving outside those upper (resistance) and lower (support) limits. Limit orders
to sell would satisfy market orders to buy, thereby stemming further upward price movement.
Limit orders to buy would satisfy market orders to sell,thereby preventing further price falls.The
result is the type of trading range used by technical analysts,with resistance and support prices at
share prices ending in 0.
Evidence consistent with the existence of resistance and support levels comes from a study by
Cyree et al. (1999).They investigated whether psychological barriers exist in the values of stock
indices,speciﬁcally at index levels ending in 00.They researched stock indices in several different
countries and found statistically signiﬁcant barriers for most of the stock indices studied.
Reversal Patterns
Chartists frequently believe that when the direction of a share price (or market index) changes,
characteristic chart patterns may develop as the turn occurs.The head-and-shoulders conﬁguration
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

illustrated by Figure 22.7 is one of those reversal patterns.The peak at C is the head,and the lower
peaks at A and E are the shoulders.When the share price falls from E to a level below D, further
price falls are forecast. In other words, such an eventuality constitutes a sell signal.
The volume (quantity) of trading in shares may also play a role in the interpretation of a head-
and-shoulders pattern.It is suggested that the shoulder at A follows a substantial rise in the market
and is based on a heavy volume of trading.The surge in prices to the head at C is expected to be
accompanied by a lighter volume of trading.Following another correction (i.e.fall) the price rises
again, to E, but on a much lighter volume of trading.
One explanation of the head-and-shoulders pattern is based on behavioural ﬁnance.Investors,
under the inﬂuence of psychological biases such as representativeness and overconﬁdence,
participate in positive feedback trading.That is, they invest on the basis that the recent direction
of price movement will continue. Recent share price rises are seen as indicating future rises with
the effect that investors buy more shares.These share purchases cause further increases in stock
prices; the forecasts become self-fulﬁlling.The result is an upward trend in share prices. Some
investors,less inﬂuenced by the psychological biases,take proﬁts periodically by selling shares.As
a result there are dips in the share price.These dips are followed by a resumption of the upward
trend as the psychological biases reassert their inﬂuence.Each new share price peak is higher than
the previous one, and each new trough is higher than the previous trough.
A partial explanation of the process comes from the behavioural ﬁnance concept of anchoring.
Mussweiler and Schneller (2003) examined the effects of charts with salient highs and salient lows.
The peaks of a head-and-shoulders pattern are examples of salient highs.Mussweiler and Schneller
found that both private and professional investors anchored on the salient highs and lows. Salient
highs and lows became comparison standards to which price expectations were assimilated.They
also found that the process of assimilation was based on a selective accessibility mechanism similar

to the operation of a conﬁrmation bias.Subsequent to a salient high investors would look for,and
give emphasis to, information that justiﬁed the expectation of a price rise.The converse followed
a salient low. Investors anchor on peaks and expect them to be repeated; what goes up will go up
again.Vice versa for troughs.
A chartist may see the head-and-shoulders pattern as indicating that the psychological biases,
causing the positive feedback trading, are losing their strength.The ﬁrst sign is the failure of a
trough to be higher than the previous one (point D, sometimes referred to as the neckline).The
second sign is a peak below the previous peak (point E, a shoulder).The third sign is a fall in the
share price below the previous trough (below D).The chartist may then conclude that the positive
feedback trading, caused by psychological biases, has run its course and that there is no longer an
upward impetus to the market.A peak below a previous peak could be seen as indicating that the
anchoring effect is weakening,or that it is being dominated by an underlying downward trend.On
the grounds that the psychological biases would have led to an unjustiﬁably high stock price, the
trading message drawn by a chartist would be that shares should be sold since they are due for a
fall in price. Converse reasoning would explain the use of a reverse head-and-shoulders, which
indicates that stock prices will rise and that therefore shares should be bought.Osler (1998) tested
the head-and-shoulders pattern on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and concluded that the pattern
was not a useful predictor.
Figures 22.8 to 22.11 illustrate some other reversal patterns looked for by chartists. In each
case the dotted line indicates the general pattern that the actual charts (unbroken lines) are
interpreted as revealing.
Moving Averages
Technical analysts use not only prices relating to individual dates, but also moving averages. A
moving average is an average of a series of previous prices,for example the average of the last 200

daily prices.(Each day the oldest price is removed from the calculation of the average and the most
recent price introduced). Chart patterns can be based on moving averages as well as daily prices.
One popular technique is to use moving averages and daily prices on the same chart. If the
current price is a predetermined percentage above or below the moving average, a buy or sell

signal may be indicated.For the market as a whole,the proportion of stocks currently above their
moving average is seen as an indicator of general market sentiment.Points at which a chart of daily
prices crosses a chart of moving averages are seen as signiﬁcant. For example, a daily price chart
that crosses a moving average chart from below might be seen as providing a buy signal.The signal
may be dependent upon whether the moving average is rising or falling at the time. Each investor
will have his or her individual trading rules.
A study by Brock et al. (1992) suggested that moving average strategies could be successful.
They found that stock returns following buy signals from a moving average rule were higher
than those following sell signals. However Ready (2002) found that the moving average rule
would not, in practice, be proﬁtable because of transaction costs and the fact that stock prices
would have already moved by the time the trader could act upon the signal. Bessembinder and
Chan (1998) concluded that, although moving averages have some forecasting power, they
could not produce proﬁtable trading strategies when transaction costs are taken into account.
Sullivan et al. (1999) found that the most proﬁtable trading rule tended to change over time.
In a UK study Hudson et al. (1996) also found that moving average technical trading rules had
predictive value,but that when transaction costs were considered the trades would not have been
proﬁtable.They found that the predictive value was stronger for sell signals than for buy signals,
and that the predictive value appears to have declined over time.Mills (1997) also found the decline
in the predictive value over time in the UK.Taylor (2001) used techniques similar to those of
Brock et al. and concluded that, net of transaction costs, it was unlikely that trading proﬁts
were available for the tradable assets studied. Taylor also found that simple autocorrelation
(serial correlation) between consecutive returns had greater predictive power than the strategies
used by Brock et al.

DOW THEORY
One of the oldest technical tools is the Dow theory. Its main purpose is to forecast the future
direction of the overall stock market.The Dow theory is based on the belief that market movements
are analogous to movements of the sea.It sees three simultaneous movements in the market.Daily
or weekly ﬂuctuations correspond to ripples.Secondary movements (which last a few months) are
the waves. Primary trends of a year or more are analogous to tides. It is the primary trend that is
referred to as either a bull or a bear market.The daily or weekly movements are seen as having
little or no predictive value. However secondary movements in stock indices are used to forecast
changes in the direction of the primary trend.
A bull market is characterised by both high and low points of successive secondary movements
moving in an upward trend,especially if this were accompanied by rising volumes of stocks traded.
Each new peak is above the previous peak, and each new trough is above the previous trough.
Trading volume should increase with moves made in the direction of the primary trend;for a rising
primary trend, volume should be heavier for advances than for falls.The market is sustained by
rising support levels and would break through successively higher resistance levels.When the
market eventually falls through a support level and then is unable to bounce back beyond a previous
resistance level, the beginning of a bear market is signalled.
A bullish primary trend is seen as being initiated by informed investors, who anticipate a
recovery.Subsequently uninformed investors start buying,thereby reinforcing the upward trend.
While the uninformed investors continue to buy, the informed investors start to sell. Sales by
informed investors cause the temporary downturns (the waves).This is consistent with theories
of the emergence of stock market bubbles (Kindleberger 1989). Support for the Dow theory has
been provided by Glickstein and Wubbels (1983).
ELLIOT WAVE THEORY
Elliot wave theory sees markets as moving in cycles.There are very long-run cycles that last many
decades. Superimposed on these are cycles of shorter duration. In turn there are cycles of even
shorter duration superimposed upon the latter cycles.This pattern of cycles within cycles continues
down to cycles of very short duration.
Analysis of the Elliot cycles is based on waves.Each cycle has eight waves.Five waves carry the
market up and three waves carry it down.At the end of the cycle the market is higher than at the
beginning.This is illustrated by Figure 22.12. It can be seen that the ﬁrst ﬁve waves include three
up-waves and two down-waves.The peak is then followed by three waves,two of which are down-
waves.
The pattern of waves entails a succession of support and resistance levels, in a similar way to
Dow theory. Elliot wave theory assumes that markets are driven by investor psychology.After a
fall in prices investor optimism is seen as growing slowly at ﬁrst but later the optimism becomes
excessive and leads to a bubble at which prices peak.The bubble bursts and the market is then
carried lower in the wave pattern.
Elliot wave theory is sometimes supplemented by the use of Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci
numbers seem to ﬁt the pattern of development of a range of natural phenomena from the
reproduction of petals on a ﬂower to the formation of galaxies.Some people believe that they can
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
467

also explain stock market developments. Fibonacci numbers are taken from a sequence in which
each number is found by adding together the previous two in the series.The sequence runs 1, 1,
2,3,5,8,13,21,34,and so forth.Users of the theory employ various combinations and ratios of
Fibonacci numbers to predict market tops and bottoms,along with support and resistance levels.
Elliot wave theory seems to lend itself to the use of Fibonacci numbers since it sees cycles as
comprising eight waves, ﬁve on the upswing and three on the downswing.These are Fibonacci
numbers. Batchelor and Ramyar (2006) found no evidence that Fibonacci numbers worked in
US stock markets over the period 1914–2002.
Although Batchelor and Ramyar (2006) found no empirical support for technical trading based
on Fibonacci numbers,they suggested that the principles of behavioural ﬁnance could explain the
use of those numbers.The relevant principle is that of anchoring.They refer to Chapman and
Johnson (2002) in pointing out that if traders are presented with numbers, albeit irrelevant
numbers, before making a judgement then those numbers could become starting points when
thinking about prospective prices.(However it could be argued that if a sufﬁcient number of traders
take them seriously, the numbers could become relevant as a result.)
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) presented subjects with a number determined at random by a
wheel of fortune, and asked whether the percentage of African nations belonging to the United
Nations was above or below that number.The subjects were also asked to estimate the actual
percentage.There was a high correlation between the number from the wheel and the estimates
of the percentage membership.The subjects had anchored on the irrelevant number from the
wheel when making their estimates of the percentage membership.
OTHER TECHNICAL INDICATORS
The forecasting techniques of technical analysts are not limited to charts.Technical analysts also
use ﬁlter rules, relative strength, and short interest ratios amongst many other indicators.
A ﬁlter rule states that an investor should buy when a stock price (or market index) has risen
by a predetermined percentage above a previous low point. Conversely the investor should sell
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
468
Price
Time
Figure 22.12

when the price or index falls by a particular percentage below a previous high.The percentages
are at the discretion of the investor, but should be established prior to the market movements.
Relative strength is measured by the ratio of a stock price to a market index. Changes in the
ratio are taken to indicate buying or selling opportunities.A momentum trader would take a rise
in the ratio as a signal to buy the stock (and a fall as a signal to sell).A contrarian would interpret
a rise in the ratio as a sell signal (and a fall as a buy signal).
The short interest ratio is the ratio of short sales (selling borrowed stock) to total trading.
A rise in the ratio has two opposing interpretations. Some technical analysts see a rise in the ratio
as indicative of bearish sentiment, and hence as constituting a sell signal. Others interpret a rise
as a buy signal on the grounds that the short positions will have to be covered by stock purchases.
These stock purchases would tend to push up stock prices.
The trin statistic is the ratio of the average trading volume in declining stocks to average volume
in rising stocks.Ratios above 1 are considered bearish on the grounds that a relatively high volume
of trades in declining stocks is indicative of net selling pressure.Conversely ratios below 1 are seen
as bullish.Apart from the trin statistic,generally trading volume is seen as indicative of the strength
of a trend.A price movement accompanied by a relatively high quantity of trades is seen as more
signiﬁcant than one in a low volume market.
To a technical analyst the breadth of the market is the extent to which movement in a market
index is reﬂected widely in the price movements of individual stocks.The most common measure
of breadth is the difference between the number of stocks that rise and the number that fall.If the
difference is large, the market movement is seen as strong since it is widespread. For example a
market rise is regarded as stronger if a large majority of stocks are rising as opposed to the rise
being the result of price increases for a few large capitalisation stocks.
Some technical analysts watch mutual fund cash holdings. If mutual funds (unit trusts and
OEICs) have large cash holdings, technical analysts might forecast a market rise on the grounds
that the cash will be used to buy shares.This demand for shares would tend to push prices up.
Conversely low mutual fund cash holdings are seen as a bearish signal.There is little scope for
purchases by mutual funds to support the market.Edelen and Warner (2001),Neal and Wheatley
(1998) and Warther (1995) found that an increased ﬂow of money into equity funds was followed
by rises in share prices.
Another measure used by technical analysts is the put-call ratio. Put options give the right
to sell shares at a speciﬁed price, and are bought by investors who expect share prices to fall.
Call options give the right to buy shares at a speciﬁed price, and are bought by investors
who expect share prices to rise.The ratio of puts bought to calls bought is used as an indicator of
the expectations of investors. However technical analysts differ as to their interpretation of the
ratio. Some see a high put-call ratio as bearish on the grounds that it indicates that investors (on
balance) expect price falls. Other technical analysts take a contrarian view and see a high put-
call ratio as a buy signal. Contrarian analysts base their analysis on the belief that investors are
usually wrong.
Simon and Wiggins (2001) investigated a trin indicator, the put-call ratio, and an index of
volatility (VIX, which is based on the volatility implied by prices of options) as technical indica-
tors of market sentiment.They found that these technical indicators had predictive power for
stock index futures prices. In particular they concluded that traders could make proﬁts from
contrarian strategies based on these indicators.The view taken is that when market sentiment is
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
469

very negative, favourable news may lead to large cash inﬂows and hence price rises. Contrarian
investors may invest when sentiment is poor in order to make proﬁts when the cash inﬂows occur.
The researchers suggested that the ﬁndings for stock index futures markets could be generalised
to stock markets.
Since there are many technical trading techniques, most technical analysts use a number of
techniques (both chart and non-chart).It is typical for technical charts to contain several indicators.
Technicians often include as many price and volume indicators as are reasonable on one chart. It
is unlikely that all the techniques point to the same conclusion. In the absence of consistency
between the different indicators,a technical analyst is likely to use judgement to seek a consensus
of the signals.
SOME CAVEATS
The foregoing should be seen as merely indicative of the wide range of technical analysis techniques
employed.However what might appear as mechanical trading rules are in reality subject to a high
degree of subjective interpretation.Technical analysts differ as to which charts,or other indicators,
they use.They also differ as to the interpretation and signiﬁcance to be assigned to a particular chart
pattern or indicator.They even differ as to whether a particular chart pattern is present at all. It
has been suggested that the recommendations of technical analysts can be so heavily qualiﬁed that
they could be seen as consistent with any outcome (Batchelor and Ramyar 2006).Rules are often
both vague and complex.
If technical analysis is seen as subjective and ambiguous,it may be the case that technical analysts
are the victims of the psychological biases identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance. For example the
representativeness bias causes people to see patterns where there are none.The conﬁrmation bias
leads to events being interpreted as supportive of one’s views.The hindsight bias distorts memory,
which becomes selective in only remembering what a person wants to remember with the effect
that past analysis is recalled as successful.
When using trading rules an investor should be wary of ‘data mining’. Observation of large
numbers of ﬁgures from the past will always throw up some patterns and rules that would have
been proﬁtable in the past. Purely as a matter of chance some rules would have been proﬁtable;
since there are an inﬁnite number of potential rules the laws of chance would suggest that some
would have been proﬁtable.The acid test is whether such patterns and rules will turn out to be
consistently proﬁtable in the future (a valid test of a pattern or rule cannot be on the facts from
which it was hypothesised; it has to be tested on new data).
It is possible for a trading rule to continue working simply because it has become a self-fulﬁlling
prophecy.If a number of technical analysts believe that a pattern signals a price rise,they will buy.
Their purchases push up the price and hence bring about the forecast price movement. Patterns
could cease to repeat themselves because of changes in the market. It is not unusual for a trading
rule to be abandoned because it no longer works.
Chart patterns may be self-destructing,which means that if a successful pattern becomes widely
used it will cease to be successful. If a pattern indicates an upward trend, and if the pattern is
known by many investors,that pattern could induce trading by many investors as soon as it becomes
apparent.The result could be that the price immediately moves to its ‘correct’level with the effect
that the trend does not emerge.A pattern, which in the past has successfully predicted a gradual
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
470

upward price trend,could induce many purchases with the effect that the stock price immediately
increases to its new level.The widespread anticipation of the trend eliminates the trend.There may
be a continual search for new proﬁtable trading rules, followed by destruction of successful rules
through overuse.The proﬁts available from successful rules would accrue only to the ﬁrst investors
to use them.An implication is that well-known rules are unlikely to be useful.
The idea of resistance and support levels raises a paradox. Suppose that 200p is seen as a
resistance level for a particular share.No one would buy at 199p since there is apparently no scope
for a rise of more than 1p,but plenty of scope for a price fall.If no one is prepared to buy at 199p,
then 199p becomes the resistance level. Hence no one would be prepared to buy at 198p. So the
conundrum develops implying lower and lower prices. If investors are to buy (or hold) at 199p,
they must believe that the price can rise above 200p.
GAMES PEOPLE PLAY
If one takes the view that the fundamentals that should determine share prices are factors such as
the level of savings available for stock market investment, the proﬁtability of businesses, and the
rates of return available on other investments (e.g. interest rates) then technical analysis may be
seen as focusing on irrelevant factors.Technical analysts could be seen as playing games with each
other, probably with professionals tending to outplay amateurs. Much of technical analysis is
concerned with forecasting the behaviour of other technical analysts.Those who are the ﬁrst to
identify (and act upon) the trend or indicator that everyone else is looking for will be able to proﬁt
when the others act upon it. Double guessing the behaviour of other investors is more important
to a technical analyst than assessing the true values of shares based on factors such as the expected
proﬁtability of companies.
Such points were identiﬁed by J. M. Keynes (1936) in The General Theory of Employment,Interest
and Money.A few quotes from the book may be of interest.
The actual, private object of the most skilled investment to-day is ‘to beat the gun’, as
the Americans so well express it,to outwit the crowd,and to pass the bad,or depreciating,
half-crown to the other fellow. (p. 155)
For it is,so to speak,a game of Snap,of Old Maid,of Musical Chairs - a pastime in which
he is victor who says Snap neither too soon nor too late, who passes the old maid to his
neighbour before the game is over,who secures a chair for himself when the music stops.
(pp. 155–6)
We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating
what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. (p. 156)
Technical analysis is often much derided. Its usefulness is often dismissed because of the absence
of statistical evidence supportive of its effectiveness, the absence of convincing explanations as to
why it should work,and the body of evidence that supports the weak form of the efﬁcient market
hypothesis (according to which past price movements cannot be used to forecast future price
movements).
However the fact that many investors use technical analysis provides a justiﬁcation for learning
about it.To the extent that successful investing requires an understanding of how other investors
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
471

think (their investment behaviour inﬂuences price movements),it is useful to have an appreciation
of the technical analysis that some of them would be using.
Also technical analysis could, at times, produce self-fulﬁlling prophecies. If many users of
technical analysis believe that prices will go up, and buy as a result, their behaviour will cause the
expected price rise.Conversely if technical analysis charts overwhelmingly suggest falling prices,
and their users are induced to sell, the sales would cause the predicted price falls. So in some
circumstances technical analysis may be valid simply because many investors believe in its validity.
IMPLICATIONS OF CROWD PSYCHOLOGY
From the perspective of fundamental analysis, technical analysis appears to be very narrow in its
focus.Fundamental analysis considers a multitude of pieces of information about the economy and
about individual companies.Fundamental analysis also uses many models,such as dividend discount
models and earnings multipliers (price-earnings ratios). In contrast technical analysis largely
focuses on just one variable, namely the share price (or the level of a stock index).
Pepper and Oliver (2006) suggest that the narrow focus of technical analysis can be justiﬁed in
terms of the nature of crowd psychology.When people behave as a crowd, their behaviour is
different from what would be observed if they operated as individuals.Fundamental analysis (and
much of ﬁnance theory) sees investors as operating as rational individuals.The behaviour of the
investment community is seen as the aggregate of the actions of millions of individuals each
rationally operating in their individual self-interests. However when people start behaving as a
crowd, different patterns of behaviour emerge. A crowd does not use sophisticated models to
conduct a detailed analysis of a complex set of pieces of information.A crowd reacts to things that
are simple and easily observed. In the context of stock markets, crowds may react to share prices
(and stock index values) to the exclusion of all other information. If technical analysis is seen as a
means of forecasting the behaviour of investors when behaving as a crowd, technical analysis may
be justiﬁed in its focus on prices.
Flanegin and Rudd (2005) suggest a cyclical pattern of crowd psychology, which generates a
cyclical movement in stock markets.They also propose that technical trading rules can detect the
presence of such cycles.They say that bulls and bears have opposed views about the future of the
market.The bulls and bears are two crowds whose sizes are in a constant state of change (it is
suggested that Internet investing has assisted in the development of a crowd mentality). For one
of the crowds to grow, investors must switch from the other crowd.As fewer investors remain in
the other crowd, it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to recruit from that crowd.As the relative size
of the larger crowd increases,its growth rate falls.To the extent that stock market movements arise
from the trading of investors who switch from being buyers to being sellers,or vice versa,the share
price movements reﬂect the movement of investors between the two groups.When movement
between the groups stops,share prices stop moving.This could create the conditions for a reversal
in the direction of share prices.This implies that when the vast majority of investors are thinking
and doing the same thing, the wise investor should do the opposite.
Fundamental analysis (such as dividend discount models,company accounts,and ratio analysis)
is based on the view that stocks have fair (or fundamental) prices, which are the correct prices
that accurately reﬂect all relevant information.Any deviation of stock prices from such fundamental
values, perhaps resulting from crowd psychology, would be subsequently corrected by well-
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
472

informed rational investors.In other words,prices revert to the mean.Technical analysis does not
suggest that there is a fundamental, or correct, price.Technical analysis is concerned with the
direction in which prices move.There is no assumption of a reversion to fundamental value
(i.e. there is no mean reversion).The implication is that prices could persistently rise, or fall,
without constraint. Prechter and Parker (2007) suggested that socionomic analysis provides the
same possibility. High degrees of uncertainty about valuations, together with herding and
ﬂuctuations in social mood, produce markets that do not move towards fundamental values
(i.e.do not mean revert).The implication seems to be that prices could rise or fall without apparent
limits.This is a frightening thought in the light of the importance of stock market investments;
for example for the accumulation of pension funds.
FURTHER EVIDENCE FROM EMPIRICAL RESEARCH
Park and Irwin (2004) reviewed the academic research on the proﬁtability of technical analysis.
They divided the research into ‘early’and ‘modern’studies.The modern studies were distinguished
by the increased sophistication of the research methodology.They concluded that the early studies
predominantly failed to ﬁnd evidence to support the usefulness of technical analysis in stock
markets but that many of the modern studies produced results favourable to technical analysis.They
surveyed 92 modern studies: 58 found that technical analysis could be proﬁtable, 24 reported
negative results, and the remaining 10 indicated mixed results. However the modern studies
indicated that technical trading ceased to be proﬁtable in US stock markets after the late 1980s.
Studies of emerging stock markets indicated continuing scope for proﬁts from technical analysis.
Testing the proﬁtability of technical trading is difﬁcult for a number of reasons. One problem
arises from the risk of data snooping. Data snooping (which is similar to data mining) entails
investigating the data to see which rules might work before testing the rules.Technical trading rules
that ﬁt the past are created and then tested. If the rules are derived from the data on which they
are tested, positive outcomes are to be expected.The researcher may test rules currently used in
markets,and those rules may be ones that are used because they would have been proﬁtable in the
past. Data snooping may also involve the selection of markets and time periods favourable to the
discovery of afﬁrmative results.To avoid the effects of data snooping, the tests might be carried
out on a completely fresh set of data. It may take a number of years for the new data to become
available since the new period to be studied should not overlap with the original period (otherwise
it would contain data from the original period).
For proﬁtability to be unambiguous it must exceed any required compensation for additional
risk.If apparent proﬁts are gained through accepting increased market risk,they cannot genuinely
be attributed to technical analysis.Merely gearing up a stockholding (increasing a stockholding with
borrowed money) would be expected to increase proﬁts at the cost of higher market risk. For
technical trading to add value it should raise proﬁts to an extent that exceeds the addition to proﬁts
expected from accepting more risk. However the measurement of market risk, and hence the
measurement of the enhancement to proﬁts required to compensate for risk,is problematical.The
difﬁculties involved are shown in Chapter 15 on the criticisms of capital market theory, and Part
7 on market efﬁciency.
Another problem entails obtaining good estimates of transaction costs. For technical trading
to be proﬁtable it must cover transaction costs. Proﬁts that are absorbed by transaction costs
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
473

are not real proﬁts. Estimating transaction costs, particularly bid-offer spreads, is difﬁcult.
Non-synchronous trading also poses problems for the researcher. Available price information
relates to the price at which a stock was last traded.The researcher could, in consequence, base
conclusions on prices that are not those at which actual traders could transact.The researcher
would be using out-of-date prices whereas investors would trade at new prices.Transaction costs
and non-synchronous trading are referred to as aspects of market microstructure. Earlier in this
chapter it was mentioned that Brock et al. (1992) found that technical trading rules, based on
moving averages,had predictive power.Day and Wang (2002) found that adjustment for transaction
costs,and for the effect of non-synchronous prices on the closing levels of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, eliminated the proﬁts reported in the Brock et al. study.
COMPLEX, ILL-STRUCTURED TASKS
Olsen (1998) suggested that investment analysis was an example of a ‘complex, ill-structured
task’.Such tasks are characterised by a lack of a generally agreed set of characteristics that clearly
deﬁne the methodology and information required for analysis. In this chapter it has been shown
that there is a large variety of rules,techniques,and data sources used by different technical analysts.
In previous chapters in this part it was shown that there are many other approaches to investment
analysis.There were various dividend discount models,many types of ﬁnancial ratio,capital market
models such as the capital asset pricing model,and so on.The list of investment analysis techniques
covered in the present text is not exhaustive;there are many other techniques.The decision process
differs widely between analysts. Differences in data interpretation, data selection, weighting,
manipulation,and analysis prevail.Complex,ill-structured tasks are common in the social sciences
and are characterised by the frequent failure of experts to outperform simple strategies.This is
illustrated in investment analysis by the tendency of analysts and portfolio managers to
underperform stock market indices (see Chapters 9, on mutual funds, and 17, on the evaluation
of the performance of fund managers,and Part 7 on market efﬁciency).In contrast many analysts
appear to be convinced that their views are correct. Perhaps it is appropriate to remember the
maxim that ‘the only thing that is certain is uncertainty’.
CONCLUSION
Technical analysis has tended to divide academics from investment professionals.Whilst market
practitioners often regard it as an essential tool of investment analysis,ﬁnance academics have felt
uncomfortable with it.The criticisms made by academics tend to focus on the absence of a coherent
body of theory to explain technical analysis,and on the difﬁculty of using statistical tests to ascertain
its effectiveness.
In the past when technical analysts have proposed theories those theories have tended to be ad
hoc and inconsistent.There has been no coherent rationale as to why technical analysis should
work.However the recent development of behavioural ﬁnance could contribute to the emergence
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

of theoretical justiﬁcations of technical analysis. If social and psychological forces inﬂuence stock
market behaviour in consistent ways,technical analysis could be seen as a technique for identifying
those forces and forecasting their effects.Behavioural ﬁnance could also be applied at another level
in that it might be used to explain the behaviour of technical analysts.Technical analysts may be
inﬂuenced by the same social and psychological biases as other market participants.Those biases
would tend to inﬂuence technical analysts’ interpretations of their charts and other data.The
forecasts of technical analysts could be affected by the same biases as the analysts may be seeking
to identify among others.
Academics are often frustrated by the imprecise nature of the forecasts made by technical
analysts.The lack of precision makes statistical testing difﬁcult.Furthermore attempts by academics
to do their own technical analysis, and test its predictions, can be open to the charge of being too
mechanical and simplistic.One possible solution is to examine whether users of technical analysis
make proﬁts. Institutional investors tend to use technical analysis alongside other methods of
investment analysis.The research evidence on the ability of institutional investors to outperform
stock market indices indicates that,at best,such outperformance is marginal (see Chapters 9 and
17 on mutual funds and on evaluating the performance of fund managers,respectively,and Part 7
on market efﬁciency).This evidence throws doubt on the effectiveness of investment analysis,
including technical analysis. However since the stock market in aggregate is equal to the sum of
investment portfolios, such ﬁndings might be expected. Investment analysis may be a zero-sum
game in that those making proﬁts make them at the expense of other analysts.

Market Efﬁciency


Chapter 23
Market efﬁciency: Concepts
and weak form evidence
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The concepts of weak, semi-strong, and strong form informational efﬁciency.
2. Evidence of arbitrage failures.
3. Empirical evidence on the weak form of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
4. Evidence on overshooting and mean reversion.
5. Evidence on momentum and contrarian strategies.
6. The implications of market efﬁciency for investment analysis.
TYPES OF EFFICIENCY
Market efﬁciency can be divided into three types:allocative efﬁciency,operational efﬁciency,and
informational efﬁciency. Allocative efﬁciency is concerned with whether funds are directed to
their most productive uses.This is mainly a primary market issue; the primary market being the
market in which borrowers issue securities and receive payment from the initial investors (the word
‘borrowers’here includes companies that raise money by issuing shares although,strictly speaking,
share issuance is not borrowing). Allocative efﬁciency is concerned with the issue of which
borrowers receive the ﬁnance.An allocatively efﬁcient market is one in which the available funds
go to the borrowers who will make the most productive use of them.Allocative efﬁciency is not
the main concern here.However,it is important to be aware that allocative efﬁciency is dependent
on operational and informational efﬁciency.
Allocative efﬁciency is dependent upon securities (shares and bonds) being accurately priced.
Accurate pricing requires informational efﬁciency.If securities are not accurately priced,investors
could direct their money to uses that are not the most productive. For example during 1999 and
early 2000 shares in Internet-related companies were seriously overpriced. For those people
establishing Internet-related companies,the proceeds from share sales heavily exceeded the costs
of establishing the companies.So there was a great incentive to set up Internet-related companies.
479

Too many Internet-related companies were created and most of them subsequently failed.The
overpricing of shares issued by Internet-related companies had caused too much money to be
invested in such companies. Much of this money could have been invested more productively
elsewhere.
Operational efﬁciency relates to the costs and risks involved in the process of carrying out
transactions in ﬁnancial markets. One dimension relates to transaction costs such as bid-offer
spreads,brokers’commissions,and taxes.The primary market is the market in which newly issued
shares and bonds are sold. High transaction costs in the primary market would raise the cost of
funds for companies and lower returns for investors (i.e.the costs would tend to be borne by both
issuers and investors).The result would be a reduction in the total level of investment in the
economy since issuers and investors would be deterred.
The secondary market is the market in which previously issued securities are traded. It is the
means by which shares or bonds bought in the primary market can be converted into cash.The
knowledge that assets purchased in the primary market can easily and cheaply be resold in the
secondary market makes investors more prepared to provide companies with funds by buying in
the primary market.A successful primary market depends upon an effective secondary market.
High transaction costs in the secondary market would adversely impact on the primary market and
hence on the total volume of investment.
If transaction costs are high in the secondary market the proceeds from the sale of securities
will be reduced, and the incentive to buy in the primary market would be lower. Also high
transaction costs in the secondary market would tend to reduce the volume of trading and thereby
reduce the ease with which secondary market sales can be executed.It follows that high transaction
costs in the secondary market would reduce that market’s effectiveness in rendering primary
market assets liquid. In consequence there would be adverse effects on the level of activity in the
primary market and hence on the total level of investment in the economy.
Price volatility is the extent to which share and bond prices ﬂuctuate, such that high volatility
of prices entails frequent large price movements.High volatility of prices in the secondary market
may be detrimental to the operation of the primary market. High volatility means that buyers in
the primary market stand a considerable risk of losing money by having to sell at much lower
prices in the secondary market.This could reduce the motivation to buy in the primary market.
Two factors that affect the price volatility of securities in the secondary market are the depth and
breadth of that market.
The depth of the market is based on the likely appearance of new orders stimulated by any
movement in price.If a rise in price brings forth numerous sell orders the price rise will be small.
A decline in price that stimulates many buy orders would be a small decline.Market depth would
be enhanced by a relatively large number of market participants. A deep market would be
characterised by the appearance of orders that tend to dampen the extent of any movement in price.
Greater depth is thus associated with lower volatility.
The breadth of the market reﬂects the diversity of the traders in the market.If there are a large
number of market participants with differing price expectations,substantial price changes would
be less likely than would be expected when the traders have common views such that they buy or
sell together.A broad market is a heterogeneous market characterised by relative price stability.
Operational efﬁciency is important for informational efﬁciency.An informationally efﬁcient
market is one in which security prices reﬂect all relevant information. By buying underpriced
MARKET EFFICIENCY
480

securities and selling overpriced securities, traders will tend to move prices to the levels that
correspond with the available information.High transaction costs will reduce (or even eliminate)
the potential proﬁts from buying low or selling high (with a view to reversing the transaction when
the pricing error has been corrected).Since such transactions move prices to the levels consistent
with the available information, transaction costs that deter them will lessen the informational
efﬁciency of the market.
Informational efﬁciency of the secondary market is important for the operation of the primary
market.This is partly because issuers of shares or bonds in the primary market are likely to look
at prices in the secondary market when determining the prices of new issues.For example the issue
price of new shares may be based on the prices of shares of companies in the same sector. If the
secondary market were informationally inefﬁcient the guidance provided would be poor.The
primary market, and its allocative efﬁciency, is thus dependent upon the informational efﬁciency
of the secondary market.
THE MEANING OF INFORMATIONAL EFFICIENCY
Informational efﬁciency is conventionally divided into the weak,semi-strong,and strong forms (a
classiﬁcation originally suggested by Fama (1965)). The weak form of the efﬁcient market
hypothesis suggests that all historical market information (past prices,past trading volumes,short
selling) is fully taken into account in the current market price.
An implication of the weak form hypothesis is that there is no scope for making proﬁts from
analysis of historical market prices and volumes. So technical analysis, particularly chartism, is
expected to be of no value. Attempts to forecast share price movements using charts based on
previous share prices will fail since all the information available from past price data is already
reﬂected in the share price.
Suppose it was discovered that a particular chart pattern was successful in forecasting share
prices. One day it may be found that the chart pattern suggests that a particular share will rise in
price from 100p to 200p over the next month.Everyone familiar with the prediction of the chart
pattern will try to buy shares, and no holder of the shares would be prepared to sell at less than
200p.This buying pressure will bring about a rapid rise in the share price to 200p.The share price
rises immediately to the level predicted by the chart pattern. In other words the information
contained in the chart pattern is immediately incorporated into the share price.Since nobody was
prepared to sell at less than 200p, no one was able to proﬁt from knowledge of the chart pattern
by buying shares.
If prices move instantly to their new correct (fair) levels following the receipt of new
information,it follows that new information is the only possible reason for a price movement.New
information is unpredictable;if it were predictable it would not be new.Share prices that move in
response to new information, and only to new information, must be unpredictable.This suggests
that share prices should follow a random walk.
A random walk involves each day’s price movement being independent of every previous day’s
price movement. Upward and downward movements are regarded as having equal likelihood on
a day, irrespective of the previous direction of movement. Price movements reﬂect news coming
into the market, and news is random both in timing and in nature (good and bad news have equal
likelihood). However the efﬁcient market hypothesis deviates from a pure random walk since it
CONCEPTS AND WEAK FORM EVIDENCE
481

allows for upward price movements to dominate downward movements so that over the
long term share prices tend to move upwards (there are random ﬂuctuations around a rising
trend).
A semi-strong form efﬁcient market is one in which security prices take account of all publicly
available information. In addition to market information on past prices and trading volumes,
publicly available information includes macroeconomic data (such as changes in interest rates,
growth rates, inﬂation rates), company data (such as proﬁts, sales, quality of management and
workforce, balance sheets), and non-economic events (such as political events, technological
developments, and discoveries of natural resources). The implication is that asset prices
immediately move to reﬂect any new information so that no one can make proﬁts by means of
purchases or sales based on analysing the new information.
Both types of market efﬁciency require prices to fully reﬂect any new information without any
time lag. Incomplete or slow price movements will allow traders successfully to forecast price
movements,and possibly to make proﬁts from those movements.Although allowance is made for
the possibility that a security price will not attain its true level until time has been taken to carry
out the relevant analyses, it is proposed that any initial deviation from the true level is equally
likely to constitute an over- or undervaluation.Temporary deviations from fair prices are equally
likely to be positive or negative.
It is the ‘news’ element of information that is important, and to which the market is expected
to react.For example if a company announces a 25% increase in proﬁts whilst a 10% increase had
been expected, the ‘news’ element is the 15% that had not been expected.The share price prior
to the announcement should already reﬂect the expected 10% increase. If the increase in proﬁts
were 10%, there would be no news and the share price should not react. If the increase in proﬁts
had been 5%, the news would be negative despite the fact of the proﬁts rise; in this case the share
price should fall.
There remains the question of how asset prices move to their new levels if no one is able to proﬁt
from trading in the assets following the emergence of new information. In principle prospective
buyers and sellers could adjust their buying and selling prices so that the equilibrium price moves
without any shares being traded.However it seems likely that trading activity would play a part in
moving prices.The buying of underpriced shares would push their prices up, and the selling of
overpriced shares would push their prices down.One might expect that those traders who respond
most quickly to new information will be able to make proﬁts from the use of that information.A
paradox is that the market efﬁciency that results from their trading depends upon those traders
believing that markets are not efﬁcient.If a trader believed that markets were efﬁcient,that trader
would not trade unless he or she had information that is not available to anyone else.
To make proﬁts (speciﬁcally abnormal returns,which are returns in excess of what is normally
available from an investment with a particular level of systematic risk) an investor may need
information that is not available to other investors. Such additional information may be data or a
different technique for analysing the data.It is not sufﬁcient to identify good ﬁrms.If other analysts
have also concluded that a ﬁrm is good,its share price will already be high.A good company is not
a good investment (in the sense of earning abnormal returns) unless other investors have failed to
fully recognise its quality.Conversely a weak ﬁrm may be a good investment if other investors have
exaggerated its weakness,in which case its share price will be too low.A share price that is too low
offers proﬁtable investment opportunities.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
482

Strong form efﬁciency allows no information to be used proﬁtably,not even insider information.
It suggests that security prices reﬂect all available information even if some of that information is
held by only one person.The puzzle of how the information becomes reﬂected in the asset prices,
without proﬁtable trading by the possessor of the information, is even greater in this case.
The efﬁcient market hypothesis has two separate (but related) interpretations. One
interpretation is that all relevant information is reﬂected in existing prices. The second
interpretation is that it is not possible to reliably proﬁt from the identiﬁcation of incorrect prices.
The second interpretation does not necessarily require that all relevant information be reﬂected
in share prices. It requires either that shares (or securities generally) are correctly priced, or that
there is no reliable way of proﬁting from incorrect pricing.
Thousands of talented and highly trained analysts working for banks and brokers and employing
state-of-the-art technology are constantly looking for proﬁtable trading opportunities.Managers
of large funds may be prepared to pay large sums to achieve marginal improvements in
performance.For example the manager of a £10-billion fund would gain £10-million from a 0.1%
improvement in performance. In the presence of such activity, it seems likely that few proﬁtable
opportunities remain and that investment assets are close to their correct (fair) prices.
It should be realised that although the efﬁcient market hypothesis suggests that investment
analysis may not be proﬁtable,it does not imply that portfolio management is pointless.Portfolio
management remains important even in perfectly efﬁcient markets. It is still necessary to ensure
that portfolio risk is consistent with the investor’s attitude to risk,and that unnecessary risk (non-
systematic risk) is eliminated. Portfolio management may also be necessary to achieve other
objectives such as high yield,tax efﬁciency,and consistency with ethical principles.In an efﬁcient
market the role of a portfolio manager is to tailor the portfolio to the investor’s needs rather than
to try to outperform the stock market by stock selection or market timing.
ASSUMPTIONS OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS
The efﬁcient market hypothesis makes ﬁve important assumptions.One assumption is that investors
are rational.This does not require all investors to be rational, but it does require that the rational
investors outweigh the irrational ones.
A second assumption is that rational investors have adequate funds. If rational investors are
going to dominate the markets, they must have the funds necessary to take advantage of all
investment opportunities. It is only by being able to trade shares, which requires resources, that
they are able to incorporate information into share prices.The adequacy of funds could arise either
from having money or from being able to borrow money.A related point is that rational investors
should be able to sell shares short.Selling short means borrowing shares and selling those borrowed
shares.The ability to sell is as important as the ability to buy in relation to ensuring that share
prices reﬂect all relevant information.Rational market participants should be able to sell overpriced
securities (shares and bonds) as well as being able to buy underpriced ones.
A third assumption is that information is available instantaneously to many investors and that
rational investors immediately use the information to make good assessments of share prices. If
some investors were able to make good assessments more quickly than others,they would be able
to make proﬁts from the information received. Although this assumption will not hold in its
absolute form, a high degree of market efﬁciency would be achieved if a substantial number of
CONCEPTS AND WEAK FORM EVIDENCE
483

rational investors analyse the information,and trade on it,within one day of the information being
available.
A fourth assumption is that rational investors do not believe that markets are efﬁcient.This is
a paradox.The existence of market efﬁciency depends upon rational investors not realising that it
exists.If rational investors believed that markets are efﬁcient,they would not carry out investment
analysis and trade on the basis of that analysis.Investment analysis is based on the belief that shares
may be mispriced so that proﬁt can be made by estimating the correct price and buying or selling
accordingly.It is through investment analysis and trades based on that analysis that share prices come
to reﬂect new information.
A ﬁfth assumption is that transaction costs, market impact effects, and required compensation
for risk are not large enough to deter trading at prices close to fundamental value.Transaction costs
include brokers’ commissions, bid-offer spreads, and taxes such as stamp duty. Market impact
effects are the effects of an investor’s own purchases and sales on the share price.An investor may
require some additional expected proﬁt to compensate for the possibility that their own analysis
may provide an inaccurate forecast.These factors could lead to investors not trading unless their
estimate of fundamental value is substantially different from the actual share price.Investors would
react only to very important pieces of new information. In consequence smaller deviations of
share prices from their fundamental values are not corrected. Less important news would not be
acted upon.Share prices would remain at levels that do not reﬂect all relevant information.Shares
would not be efﬁciently priced.
PRICE ANOMALIES (ARBITRAGE FAILURES)
The law of one price suggests that identical assets should have the same price in different markets.
If prices differed between markets, arbitragers would buy in the cheaper market and sell in the
expensive one.This would generate a proﬁt,and would also tend to move the prices into equality.
The extra demand in the low-price market would tend to raise the price there,and the additional
supply in the high-price market would tend to reduce the price in that market.The efﬁcient market
hypothesis implies that the price of an asset should be the same in all markets.
A related idea is that similar ﬁnancial assets should trade at similar prices.If they did not,there
would be an arbitrage proﬁt available from buying the cheaper and simultaneously selling the more
expensive one. Such arbitrage would tend to bring the prices into equality.The efﬁcient market
hypothesis suggests that similar assets should trade at similar prices. Effective arbitrage is useful
(probably essential) for the maintenance of market efﬁciency.
There are reasons why arbitrage may fail to maintain equality between the prices of similar (or
identical) assets. First, arbitragers may need a mechanism for selling short.They may need to be
able to borrow securities (shares or bonds) in order to sell them with a view to taking advantage
of overpricing.Such a mechanism may not be available for many potential arbitragers.Second,the
correction of the relative mispricing should occur quickly. If arbitragers have to wait years to
collect their arbitrage proﬁts, they are unlikely to conduct arbitrage trades.Third, there is not
always an identical, or similar, asset against which to arbitrage. For example it may be possible to
arbitrage one UK share against a similar UK share (e.g.one large bank against another large bank)
but there is nothing against which the UK stock market as a whole can be arbitraged. One
implication is that arbitrage may establish correct relative prices,but cannot ensure correct absolute
MARKET EFFICIENCY
484

prices. Fourth, arbitragers must have sufﬁcient money and/or borrowing facilities.Without
such adequate ﬁnancial resources, arbitragers would not be able to conduct the requisite
trading.
Froot and Dabora (1999) found that the law of one price was violated in stock markets.Twin
securities and dual-listed shares involve identical investments trading simultaneously on more than
one stock exchange.For example,Royal Dutch/Shell was traded on nine different stock exchanges
around the world and Unilever was traded on eight. Rather strangely the prices (when making
appropriate exchange rate adjustments) differed considerably between exchanges, in some
instances by as much as 50%.The fact that shares in the same company had different prices on
different stock exchanges contradicted the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
The fact that arbitragers do not exploit, and thereby correct, these price discrepancies might
be explained by the concept of noise trader risk.With this type of arbitrage there is no guarantee
that the price discrepancy will ever be corrected; there is no date by which it is guaranteed to be
corrected. Indeed the discrepancy may become larger before it becomes smaller. Noise traders
(irrational traders) can keep prices away from equality for prolonged periods.
An equity carve out occurs when a ﬁrm ﬂoats part of itself.Thaler and Lamont (2000) examined
equity carve outs in the US high-tech sector between 1995 and 2000 (the latter part of that period
coincided with the emergence of the high-tech bubble).A particular case was that of 3Com and
Palm. In February 2000, 3Com sold 5% of its stake in Palm via a public offering.The remaining
95% of the shares were to be issued by the end of the year by giving existing shareholders in 3Com
about 1.5 shares in Palm for every 3Com share held.It follows that the price of 3Com should have
been at least equal to 1.5 times the price of Palm.After the ﬁrst day of trading, Palm closed at
$95.06 implying a minimum price for 3Com of $142.59. However 3Com closed at $81.81.This
violation of the law of one price persisted for over two months.Although the 3Com/Palm case
was probably the most dramatic, there were several other examples of carve out mispricing
revealed by Thaler and Lamont (and also by Cornell and Liu 2001).
Apparent price anomalies are not restricted to equity markets.A callable bond allows the issuer
to buy the bond back at a predetermined price.As a result an investor could lose proﬁts since a
substantial rise in the price of the bond might be lost if the issuer chooses to repurchase the bond
at the predetermined price. It would be expected that a callable bond has less value than an
otherwise identical non-callable bond to an investor.A callable bond should trade at a lower price
than an equivalent non-callable bond.Longstaff (1992) found that some callable bonds were more
expensive than their non-callable equivalents.
Lamont and Thaler (2003) pointed out that if the market fails to arbitrage away glaring
discrepancies, there must be a strong suspicion that there is a widespread failure of arbitrage.
Arbitrage failures are cases in which the market is failing to incorporate information into market
prices. If information were being incorporated into prices efﬁciently, arbitrage opportunities
would not persist. Each pair of similar assets should trade at similar prices if traders were
considering all relevant information. The price of one member of a pair of similar assets is
information that is relevant to the pricing of the other member of the pair.The persistence of
arbitrage opportunities indicates that not all of the relevant information is being used. If relevant
information is failing to determine prices when the price relationships are obvious,there must be
doubt about less obvious cases. If the market gets simple cases wrong, it seems likely that it is
getting much else wrong.
CONCEPTS AND WEAK FORM EVIDENCE
485

For many (probably most) investment assets there are no close substitutes against which to
arbitrage.It is unlikely that there is a close substitute for the shares of a particular company.There
is no close substitute for the whole stock market.There are no unambiguous ‘correct’prices since
different investors take different views using different pricing models (dividend discount, price-
earnings ratios, technical trading rules, etc.). If investors do not pay attention to relevant
information when deciding on fair prices, the uncertainty about the accuracy of market prices
becomes greater. Market prices are consensus estimates of fair prices, but consensus does not
necessarily imply truth or substance (Trumble and Cavazotte 2000).Behavioural ﬁnance research
has shown that social pressures strongly inﬂuence opinions,and hence the consensus (see Chapter
27 on stock market bubbles and crashes).There is evidence that professional analysts are inﬂuenced
by each other when determining price forecasts (see Chapter 21 on ratio analysis).The resulting
consistency of views between analysts can give a spurious perception of accuracy and certainty,in
the belief that if most experts agree on something then they are likely to be right.
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE WEAK FORM
OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS
Kendall (1953) attempted to identify cycles in stock indices.He could not ﬁnd any.One day’s level
appeared to be equal to the previous day’s plus or minus a random amount.Roberts (1959) showed
that a series of cumulative random numbers looked like a series of share prices such that observers
believed that they could identify price patterns.Osborne (1959) found that share price movements
conformed to the Brownian motion of physics in that successive movements appeared to be random
and the standard deviation of cumulative changes was proportional to the square root of time.
Moore (1964) looked for correlations between share price changes and previous price changes
(serial correlation).The average coefﬁcient of correlation was not signiﬁcantly different from zero
(statistically).He concluded that past price changes cannot be used to forecast future price changes.
Fama (1965) conﬁrmed the absence of serial correlation. He also employed runs tests, which
sought to ascertain whether runs of successive upward or downward price movements were longer
or shorter than would be expected on the basis of random price movements. He concluded that
lengths of runs were consistent with a random series of price movements. So there was no
observable tendency for prices to trend upwards or downwards. However Niederhoffer and
Osborne (1966) found slight evidence of serial correlation and runs using intra-day rather than
weekly or daily data. Intra-day serial correlation appeared to be slightly negative.
Conrad and Kaul (1988) and Lo and MacKinlay (1988) found positive serial correlations over
short periods using weekly returns of New York Stock Exchange stocks, but the correlation
coefﬁcients were small. Campbell et al. (1997) and Lovatt et al. (2007) found that daily stock
returns contained a strong element of predictability. In an investigation of intermediate horizon
(3- to 12-month periods) stock price movements,Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) found that stocks
exhibit a momentum in which good or bad recent performance continues.They concluded that
while the performance of individual stocks is insufﬁciently predictable, portfolios of the best
performing stocks from the recent past appear to outperform other stocks with enough reliability
to provide opportunities for proﬁt.
The question arises as to whether any correlation between current and previous returns provides
the possibility of earning excess returns (trading proﬁts) net of transaction costs.Transaction costs
MARKET EFFICIENCY
486

could exceed any potential gains. Efﬁcient markets should be characterised by transaction costs
setting upper limits to correlation coefﬁcients,with higher transaction costs allowing greater serial
correlation. Jennergren and Korsvold (1975) observed higher correlation coefﬁcients in markets
with higher transaction costs when examining Norwegian stocks.
Another approach to testing for weak form efﬁciency is to ascertain whether trading rules,
such as those used by chartists,have any predictive value.One trading rule that has been investigated
is the ﬁlter rule.A typical ﬁlter rule might involve buying when a stock price rises 5% above its
previous low point and selling when the stock price falls 5% from its previous high.Alexander
(1964) and Fama and Blume (1966) concluded that it was not possible to make proﬁts by using
ﬁlter rules to forecast price movements. However Sweeney (1988, 1990) suggested that ﬁlter
rules can produce statistically signiﬁcant risk-adjusted excess returns after adjusting for the types
of transaction costs faced by professional traders.
Chartists argue that tests of simple and mechanical trading rules cannot be used to draw
conclusions about the complex and subtle techniques actually employed.There is also the point
that it is impossible to test the whole inﬁnite variety of trading rules,and hence it is always possible
that effective trading rules exist among those that have not been tested. Furthermore technical
analysts would not publicise effective techniques for fear that widespread knowledge of the
techniques would reduce the proﬁts available to themselves. Perhaps it is only the ineffective
trading rules that become widely known, and hence subject to testing.
Contrary to much of the other evidence, one study has suggested that some widely known
chartist techniques have predictive power. Lo et al. (2000) found that some technical analysis
patterns occurred far more frequently than would be expected on the basis of chance.The most
common patterns were double tops (and bottoms),followed by head and shoulders (and inverted
head and shoulders).Although the researchers ascertained that the charts provided information
about future share prices,they did not investigate whether the information could be used to make
trading proﬁts. Niarchos and Alexakis (2003) found that on the Athens stock exchange there was
a possibility of proﬁtable intra-day (i.e.within a trading day) trading based on stock price patterns.
There are counterviews and debates about the evidence.Shiller (1984,1988) has suggested that
there may be fads and fashions in investment.If such fashions spread slowly,share price trends could
emerge as a result.Fashion is not the only possible driving force.Since the late 1990s some people
have argued that demographic trends are having a similar effect.In North America and Europe the
post-war bulge generation (people born in the baby boom of the late 1940s to the early 1960s) is
moving into the last decade or so before retirement.They are reaching the stage at which family
responsibilities are lessening as their grown-up children leave home,their mortgages are being paid
off,and the necessity of saving for retirement is becoming increasingly apparent.They thus become
more able and willing to save.The additional saving would involve increased ﬁnancial investment.
This may have an upward pull on stock market prices that continues for a long period of time. If
this line of reasoning is accurate, a strong and long-lasting upward price trend may be expected.
A study by Peters (1991), which analysed S&P 500 price changes from 1928 to 1989, showed
that securities markets are highly leptokurtotic. Leptokurtotic markets exhibit fat tails in their
returns distributions.The probabilities of very high and very low values are greater than would be
predicted by normal distributions.This is consistent with markets trending in a particular direction,
i.e.consistent with price movements being related to previous price movements.Peters suggested
that as few as three variables can accurately predict market movements.However since these three
CONCEPTS AND WEAK FORM EVIDENCE
487

variables frequently change, there may be no practical way of making proﬁts from predicting
market movements.Also leptokurtosis may have alternative explanations, such as the observed
distribution being an amalgam of several different normal distributions (it is likely that over a
prolonged period a stock index would have been subject to numerous different distributions of
returns).
Overshooting (Overreaction) and Mean Reversion
Summers (1986) simulated a series of share prices, which overreacted to new information.
Overreaction means that prices rise too high and fall too low.He went on to show that the techniques
used in the early tests of serial correlation were not able to discriminate between an overreacting
series and a random series.The tests could not identify the presence of overreaction. Such tests
cannot therefore be used to refute the proposition that markets are prone to overreaction.
It has often been suggested that the observed volatility of stock markets is greater than might
be expected from the efﬁcient market hypothesis.The stock market crash of October 1987 is an
example of volatility that is difﬁcult to explain in terms of new information coming into the market.
Share prices are seen as being the present values of expected future dividend receipts,but dividends
show much less ﬂuctuation than share prices.
Shiller (1981) tested the hypothesis that stock price volatility exceeds what is justiﬁed on the
basis of variations in dividends.The basic premise of these studies is that stock prices should be
more stable than dividends since stock prices reﬂect expectations of dividends.Consider an analogy
with tossing a coin.If a coin is tossed 100 times the expectation is that there will be 50 heads.Each
time the coin is tossed 100 times the forecast would be of 50 heads.The forecast does not vary; it
has zero volatility.However on most occasions that the coin is tossed 100 times the actual number
of heads will differ from 50.The observed numbers of heads will tend to form a normal distribution
with a mean of 50.The observed number of heads is more volatile than the forecast number of
heads.The implication of this reasoning for share prices is that they should exhibit greater stability
than dividends. Share prices are based on expected dividends, which should be more stable than
actual dividends.The volatility of share prices should be less than the volatility of dividends.Shiller’s
research found that stock prices were much more volatile than dividends.
These studies have their critics. It has been suggested that the price ﬂuctuations arise from
variations in the required rate of return by which expected dividend streams are discounted,
perhaps due to changes in the risk premiums (Cochrane 1991).It has also been suggested that the
apparent serial correlation arises from small sample bias,the tests being based on a small number
of observations (Cecchetti et al. 1990).
Although studies of short-term serial correlation tended to ﬁnd that there was no signiﬁcant
correlation coefﬁcient,investigations of longer time periods have suggested that markets overreact
to new information.Tests covering periods of several years (Poterba and Summers 1988;Fama and
French 1988) have found a tendency for prices to deviate from their fair values and then revert
towards them (mean reversion). In other words signiﬁcant negative serial correlation has been
found over multi-year time horizons.This is consistent with Shiller’s (1984, 1988) view that fads
appear to exist in securities markets. Episodes of apparent overshooting followed by corrections
give the appearance of asset prices ﬂuctuating around their fair values. Market prices seem to
exhibit excess volatility.

Research by Brown and Cliff (2005) is consistent with the view that fads,or sentiment,inﬂuence
stock prices. Brown and Cliff used a measure of sentiment based on the balance between bullish
and bearish investment newsletters.Their results were consistent with the view that share prices
initially overreact and then mean revert with the effect that, following positive sentiment, there
are relatively low returns for a period as prices mean revert.Prices initially show unjustiﬁed rises,
but subsequently experience falls as the unjustiﬁed rises are corrected. Conversely periods of
negative sentiment are followed by relatively high returns as the underpricing, caused by the
negative sentiment, is subsequently corrected.
DeBondt and Thaler (1985, 1987) have put forward an overreaction hypothesis. The
overreaction hypothesis suggests that when investors react to unanticipated news, which will
beneﬁt a company’s stock, the price rise will initially be greater than it should be.There will be a
subsequent price decline to the level justiﬁed by the new information. Conversely the price fall
arising from adverse news will initially be exaggerated, requiring a subsequent correction.
DeBondt and Thaler proposed a directional effect and a magnitude effect.The directional effect
is the tendency for an initial overreaction to be followed by a moderating movement in the opposite
direction.The magnitude effect is the tendency for the size of the correction to be related to the
extent of the initial overreaction. A relatively large initial overreaction will be followed by a
relatively large compensating correction. Brown and Harlow (1988) added the intensity effect,
which states that the shorter the duration of the initial price change, the more extreme the
subsequent response will be.Brown and Harlow found that overreaction (all three effects) was most
marked in the case of short-term responses to negative news.
A related observation by DeBondt and Thaler (1985, 1987) is sometimes referred to as the
winner-loser problem.Stocks that have been relatively good performers over the last three to ﬁve
years will tend to underperform during the next three to ﬁve years, conversely past
underperformers become future outperformers. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) found evidence
consistent with this observation.
Momentum and Contrarian Strategies
Investment strategies based on the view that the recent direction of share price movement will
continue are known as momentum strategies.Contrarian strategies are based on the view that the
direction of movement will reverse. There is evidence that technical trading rules based on
momentum and contrarian strategies might produce opportunities for proﬁt.A number of studies
have divided stocks into ‘winner’and ‘loser’portfolios.The winner portfolios contain those stocks
that have performed well in the recent past;the loser portfolios contain those that have shown poor
recent returns.The studies have then investigated whether there is a signiﬁcant difference in their
subsequent performances. If markets are weak form efﬁcient there should be no signiﬁcant
difference between the returns (price movements) of the two portfolios.
Research has shown there to be signiﬁcant differences between the returns to winner and loser
portfolios. Some studies have found that winner and loser portfolios chosen on the basis of the
returns (price changes) during one week exhibit contrarian behaviour in the following week.A
relatively good performance one week tends to be followed by a relatively bad performance the
next week, and vice versa (Lehmann 1990). Similar ﬁndings have arisen from consideration of
returns over one month and the following month (Jegadeesh 1990).However when the period used
CONCEPTS AND WEAK FORM EVIDENCE
489

has been six months or a year momentum strategies appear to have been successful; winner
portfolios continue to signiﬁcantly outperform loser portfolios (Jegadeesh 1990; Jegadeesh and
Titman 1993;Fama and French 1996).Paradoxically tests using three- and ﬁve-year periods have
found contrarian strategies to work; the losers from one period become the winners in the next
period, and vice versa (De Bondt and Thaler 1985, 1987; Chopra et al. 1992).
Hong et al. (2000) provide evidence to indicate that momentum in share prices is the result of
gradual diffusion of information about a company,and that stocks with slower information diffusion
provide more potential for momentum proﬁts.They point out that over investment horizons of
three to twelve months, there appear to be opportunities to proﬁt from trading strategies based
on momentum in that winners continue to perform well and laggards continue to perform poorly.
They propose that slow diffusion of information is particularly characteristic of poorly performing
small companies whose shares are neglected by analysts. Company managements do not
enthusiastically publicise bad news, and few investors seek information about neglected small
companies. In consequence share prices adjust very gradually to new information and exhibit
momentum during the adjustment process.
Doukas and McKnight (2005) used a sample of 13 European stock markets over the period
1988–2001 to test the hypothesis that momentum was caused by slow diffusion of information.
They also tested an alternative explanation of momentum, which is that it results from investor
conservatism. Investor conservatism is a cognitive bias identiﬁed in behavioural ﬁnance.
Conservatism causes investors to be slow to change their opinions. So even if information were
provided quickly, investors would be slow to respond to it.The slow response results in a slow
adjustment of stock prices to the new information.The information-induced trades that move
prices to their new levels occur gradually over time, rather than immediately after the release of
the information. Doukas and McKnight concluded that both hypotheses contributed to the
explanation of the momentum effect.
Further evidence on momentum and contrarian strategies comes from Chan et al. (1999) who
used measures of price momentum and earnings momentum.The earnings momentum measures
considered the impact of unexpected earnings (proﬁts) announcements on the behaviour of share
prices,and the impact of changes in analysts’earnings forecasts.Unexpectedly good earnings and
upward revisions of analysts’forecasts tend to cause share price rises;conversely for bad earnings
and downward revisions.It was found that investing on the basis of price momentum and the two
forms of earnings momentum could produce proﬁts over six-month and one-year periods. No
evidence of reversals,and hence no evidence of proﬁtable contrarian strategies,was found.It was
suggested that the evidence was consistent with the view that information is gradually incorporated
into share prices.An explanation proposed for the gradual incorporation of information was the
procrastination of analysts in the adjustment of their forecasts. Downward revisions of forecasts
may be particularly slow since analysts do not want to antagonise the companies whose shares are
being evaluated.
Chan et al. (2000) found that momentum strategies could work in international investing. In
particular they found that increasing portfolio weights in countries whose stock markets had
recently performed well, and reducing weights in relatively poorly performing markets, could
improve portfolio performance.Schiereck et al. (1999) used German data to test for momentum
and reversion.The momentum effect was found to be strong for six months. Based on periods of
two to ﬁve years they found reversal effects,which would allow proﬁts from contrarian strategies.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
490

Forner and Marhuenda (2003) found momentum and contrarian effects in the Spanish stock
market.They concluded that momentum strategies could be proﬁtable on a 12-month basis and
that contrarian strategies offered proﬁtable opportunities over 60-month periods.Antoniou et al.
(2005) found overreaction and contrarian effects on the Athens stock exchange.
Levy and Post (2005) have pointed out that there are practical considerations that reduce the
likelihood of successful momentum strategies. First, momentum strategies are likely to require
high turnover of shareholdings with the effect that transaction costs are high. Second, the
momentum effect is strongest among small capitalisation stocks. Small capitalisation stocks tend
to be illiquid, which makes high turnover impossible.Third, most of the return available from
momentum strategies comes from taking short positions in poorly performing shares. For many
investors short positions (borrowing shares which are then sold) are not possible.However Kothari
and Shanken (2002) found that portfolio performance could be improved by tilting the portfolio
towards high momentum stocks.
Some studies have concluded that prospective proﬁts from momentum trading are illusory
(Lesmond et al. 2004;Agyei-Ampomah 2007).Agyei-Ampomah found that for periods up to six
months transaction costs eliminated proﬁts from momentum trading,but did not fully offset proﬁts
when longer periods were considered. However it was also found that most of the apparent
momentum trading proﬁts arose from short selling poorly performing stocks.The process of
borrowing shares can be expensive, difﬁcult, and subject to risk.Agyei-Ampomah suggested that
the costs and difﬁculties of taking short positions in stocks were capable of preventing the
exploitation of the apparent proﬁt opportunities.
Research on relative strength has also produced conﬂicting ﬁndings. Proponents of relative
strength strategies look at the ratio between a stock price and the level of a stock index.A change
in this ratio may signal a trade. Momentum traders see an increase in the ratio as indicative of a
buying opportunity (and a decline as a sell signal). Levy (1966) produced ﬁndings that suggested
that a strategy based on relative strength could outperform a buy-and-hold strategy (a strategy of
simply buying stocks and holding them without indulging in any further transactions). Arnott
(1979) found that a stock that had been strong in the past would tend to be weak in the future.
Brush (1986) found that relative strength models could not be used to predict which stocks would
achieve superior performance after adjusting for risk and transaction costs.Ryan and Overmeyer
(2004) found that momentum trades on the basis of relative strength in the German stock market
were proﬁtable,even after allowing for transaction costs.Proﬁts from the strategy appeared to be
available for about 12 months. Of interest was the apparent absence of any subsequent reversal
during the following two years; in other words there was no sign of overreaction and consequent
proﬁts from a contrarian strategy.They interpreted the evidence as being consistent with delayed
reaction to ﬁrm-speciﬁc news.
Serial Correlation in Volatility
ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) and GARCH (generalised ARCH) models
allow price changes to be serially uncorrelated but not independent. Predictability comes not
through being able to forecast price changes but by being able to forecast the variance of the
changes.Although the best forecast of a price change may be zero, the variance of possible price
changes will depend upon past volatility.Al-Loughani and Chappell (1997) found that the FTSE
CONCEPTS AND WEAK FORM EVIDENCE
491

100 Index between 1983 and 1989 did not follow a random walk but demonstrated signiﬁcant
heteroscedasticity (variances were serially correlated).Their results provided evidence against the
random walk hypothesis.The results did not necessarily provide evidence against the weak form
of the efﬁcient market hypothesis since they did not test whether the predictability of volatility
provided the opportunity to earn excess proﬁts. However, it has been suggested that the serial
correlation in variance arises from the inappropriateness of the asset pricing model used rather
than from market inefﬁciency (e.g. Schwaiger 1995).
THE MAGNITUDE AND SELECTION BIAS ISSUES
Investment analysis is concerned with improving portfolio returns (without increasing risk). For
a fund manager an improvement of 0.1% p.a. would be worthwhile. For example in the case of a
£10-billion fund an increase of 0.1% amounts to £10 million.The fund manager would regard the
strategy that provides the 0.1% increase as successful. However a researcher looking for success,
or otherwise, in investment analysis is unlikely to detect an improvement of 0.1% p.a. Given the
typical volatility of stock markets, statistical techniques would not identify such a small increase.
A small increase would be swamped by typical annual volatility with the effect that it becomes
invisible to the statistician.So the researcher would conclude that there is no evidence for successful
investment analysis, despite the fact that the analysis was successful.This has been referred to as
the magnitude issue.It might also be noted that the fund manager cannot be sure that the investment
analysis has been successful; an increase of 0.1% p.a. could easily occur by chance.
The selection bias issue is concerned with the choice of techniques to be investigated. A
researcher is limited to investigating publicly known techniques.This may preclude the successful
techniques. If an analyst has a technique that is successful, that analyst would not reveal it.The
analyst would use it to make money. So researchers do not investigate successful techniques.The
techniques available for investigation are the ones that analysts are willing to make public;in other
words the ones that are unsuccessful.So a volume of research that suggests the failure of investment
analysis may merely reﬂect the absence of research on successful analysis.
CONCLUSION
Finance academics and investment practitioners have not always been in agreement. Perhaps the
biggest source of division has been the efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH).Although the academic
world is less committed to the hypothesis than it used to be, the EMH remains one of the pillars
of capital market theory. However the strength of that pillar is questionable.
If the weak form of the EMH is correct,technical analysis is futile.The weak form of the EMH
suggests that it is not possible to use market data, particularly past prices, to make proﬁts from
investment analysis.According to the weak form of the EMH,popular techniques such as chartism
(predicting share price movements from charts) are no more useful than reading tea leaves.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
492

Many investors, including institutional investors, use technical analysis.The EMH implies that
retail investors would do well to shun funds that waste money on such analysis, and to invest in
low cost index tracker funds instead.
Some of the early empirical studies indicated that past price data did not provide a means of
predicting future price movements. It was also observed that people tended to see patterns and
trends in randomly generated series of prices.This receives support from behavioural ﬁnance,
which indicates that people are uncomfortable with the idea of randomness and see patterns and
causes where there are none.
Later empirical research has produced more ambiguous results.In particular the EMH appears
to be contradicted by blatant failures of arbitrage.If it is easy to make proﬁts from obvious failures
of arbitrage to maintain the law of one price, it seems likely that proﬁt opportunities will be
available where price discrepancies are less obvious. If the price of a share in one market fails to
take full account of the price of the same share in another market,it seems likely that other market
data is also incompletely reﬂected in prices.
Behavioural ﬁnance suggests that investors are less than perfectly rational. In particular the
concept of representativeness suggests that there is a tendency for investors to extrapolate price
movements (see the chapters – in particular 2 and 24 – dealing with behavioural ﬁnance and
investor psychology). If prices have been moving in a direction, many investors believe that they
will continue to move in that direction.There is a body of empirical research that ﬁnds a tendency
for markets to overreact;both rises and falls are exaggerated.The existence of stock market bubbles
and crashes could be seen as evidence in support of this idea (see Chapter 27 on stock market
bubbles and crashes).

Chapter 24
Noise trading and
behavioural ﬁnance
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of the implications of noise trading and
behavioural ﬁnance for market efﬁciency, particularly in regard to:
1. The role of rumours in ﬁnancial markets.
2. Underreaction to news.
3. Overreaction to news.
4. Inaccurate perceptions of risk.
5. Moods and emotions.
One of the assumptions of the efﬁcient market hypothesis is that,in aggregate,market participants
behave in a rational manner.There are lines of reasoning that suggest that irrational behaviour can
have signiﬁcant impacts on ﬁnancial markets.The concepts of noise trading and behavioural ﬁnance
suggest that individual market participants do not consistently behave rationally.
NOISE TRADING AND RUMOURS
Fisher and Statman (2004) distinguish between information traders and noise traders.Information
trading is driven by the fundamental values of stocks (and other securities) whereas noise trading
is driven by sentiment (Shefrin and Statman 1994).In an efﬁcient market there are only information
traders and value alone determines prices.Noise traders can move prices away from fundamental
value and render markets inefﬁcient.According to Fisher and Statman stock markets are in a bubble
when bullish sentiment moves prices above fundamental value and in a negative bubble when
bearish sentiment pushes prices below fundamental value.
Roll (1988a) found that value-related news explained only 35% of the variation in monthly stock
returns and Fair (2002) found that many large price changes occurred in the absence of value-
related news.Noise traders appear to have a substantial impact on price movements.Bullish noise
trading can drive prices higher as fundamental value falls,and bearish noise trading can push prices

NOISE TRADING AND BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE
495
down even when fundamental value rises.When a market movement occurs in the absence of
value-related news, the market movement becomes the news. Investors may react to such price
changes on the grounds that they reveal how other investors are thinking. In particular it may be
assumed that other investors know something,or understand something,that justiﬁes the market
movement and an informational cascade ensues with investors copying each other.Fama and French
(2004a) showed that unless noise traders (stupid or misinformed investors) exactly cancel each
other out there would be a noise trader effect on prices.Unless there is a mistaken overpricing to
offset every mistaken underpricing, the mistakes affect prices.
A noise trader uses irrelevant, or inaccurate, information when making investment decisions.
One type of unreliable information, on which noise traders may base their trades, is rumour.
However rumours may affect even professional traders.If trading on rumour is regarded as noise
trading, then market professionals are sometimes noise traders. Even respected ﬁnancial
newspapers and magazines participate in the spreading of rumours,and websites are an abundant
source of rumours.
For ﬁnancial market traders to proﬁt from new information,they must act on the news before
other traders.There is pressure to respond quickly.There may not be time to check on the accuracy
of a rumour before acting on it. As a result even competent professionals may engage in noise
trading.Pressure to act quickly is likely to engender anxiety and stress,which renders people more
susceptible to accepting rumours.It is not always possible to know whether a piece of information
is good or bad. One of the behavioural ﬁnance heuristics is the dilution heuristic according to
which use of poor information can dilute the use of good information,and hence noise trades can
crowd out information trades.
Kimmel (2004) points out that rumours emerge in conditions of uncertainty,which are frequent
in ﬁnancial markets.Rumours are particularly prone to emerge when emotions,especially feelings
of fear, are high. In a situation of change people may be unable to understand the changes.The
resulting uncertainty generates fear and the need for information relevant to the future.
Uncertainty about the future creates stress, and interacts with stress, to produce a need for
information which can be used to guide actions.
Rumours are more likely to circulate if they are credible. Rumours received from trusted
sources are more likely to be believed. In addition to the plausibility and source of a rumour, its
frequency of repetition affects its acceptability.The more often a rumour is heard,the more likely
it is to be believed. Repetition fosters belief.
It appears that in ﬁnancial markets the most prevalent rumours concern short-term events;
it is the immediate future that is of greatest concern. Kimmel and Audrain (2002) found that
the number of rumours was related to the importance of their content,to the accuracy of previous
rumours, and to levels of anxiety.They also found that rumours that subsequently turned out
to be true, became more precise over time. In contrast, false rumours became increasingly
distorted.
Rumours, true or false, have an impact on market prices. For example DiFonzo and Bordia
(1997) showed that rumours affect investment decisions, even when the rumours come from
sources that lack credibility.They found that price changes resulting from rumours tend to follow
trends that exhibit persistence.Apart from their speciﬁc ‘information’content,rumours can have
a further effect on markets by inﬂuencing market sentiment. Rumours can generate feelings of
optimism or pessimism.

Some researchers have considered the role of the media in the provision of stock market
information, and in particular whether the media provide good information or noise.Tetlock
(2007) found that media optimism/pessimism could inﬂuence market prices but that the effects
were subsequently eliminated,which was interpreted as suggesting that the information conveyed
was noise. Noise was seen as having a merely temporary effect on prices. Media pessimism was
followed by price falls,which were subsequently reversed.The falls were larger,and lasted longer,
in the case of the stocks of smaller companies.This latter point was interpreted as indicating that
small investors were most strongly affected by the media.This view was based on the grounds that
the stocks of smaller companies tend to be held by private individuals.
Liden (2006) investigated the value of stock recommendations from newspapers and magazines.
It was found that, although the overall value of the information was about zero, there was a
difference between buy and sell recommendations. Sell recommendations tended to be useful
indicators; they contained good information. Buy recommendations were actually misleading in
the sense that recommended stocks tended to fall in price.
Another source of noise appears to be advertising of the products of the company whose shares
are being considered. Fehle et al. (2005) found that when a company advertises its products, it
simultaneously advertises its shares.When a company advertises its products,its stock price tends
to rise.From the perspective of stock trading,the advertising could be seen as noise.It was observed
that the increase in share purchases took the form of small purchases, which indicates that small
investors are the ones inﬂuenced by the product advertising when making their investment
decisions.
Rational investors might be expected to correct the errant price movements caused by noise
traders. Unjustiﬁed falls would be countered by purchases on the part of rational investors,
conversely unwarranted rises would tend to cause rational investors to sell and thereby eliminate
the inappropriate price movement.Trading that tends to maintain prices at stable, equilibrium
levels is referred to as negative feedback trading.The efﬁcient market hypothesis assumes that
negative feedback trading dominates ﬁnancial markets.
Shleifer and Summers (1990) suggested that rational investors face two forms of uncertainty
that could result in them not correcting the effects of noise traders.First,their rational valuations
may be wrong.This possibility could make them reluctant to pursue the more modest proﬁt
opportunities, so that small deviations from fair value may remain uncorrected. Second, rational
investors face uncertainty as to how long the stock prices will stay away from their fundamental
values.The effects of uncertainty on the trading behaviour of rational investors allow noise traders
to move prices away from the values that would accurately reﬂect the available information.
Shleifer and Vishny (1997) also pointed out limits to the correction of mispricing including the
particular difﬁculty of exploiting overpricing.To proﬁt from overpricing an investor needs to short
sell; that is, borrow shares and then sell them.The resulting short position provides a proﬁt from
a fall in the share price since the shares could be bought at a price lower than the selling price when
being returned to the lender.The extent of such trades is limited by the fact that many investors
are not allowed to short sell.The possibility that the return of the shares to the lender could be
demanded at any time renders the time horizon of the short sale uncertain,and thereby causes the
short sale to be riskier and less desirable.
A constraint on the rationality of investment behaviour is the limit to the amount of information
that investors can process. Bounded rationality is the limited rationality that arises when, in the
MARKET EFFICIENCY

face of a deluge of information,investors fail to analyse it all and as a result do not behave in a totally
rational manner. In addition, behavioural ﬁnance suggests that there are systematic psychological
biases that distort decision-making and prevent rational behaviour.The limitations on the price-
correcting trades of rational investors makes it less likely that they would correct mispricing arising
from the psychological biases identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance.
Noise traders are sometimes referred to as uninformed traders.Jordan and Kaas (2002) found
that whilst both informed and uninformed investors are subject to behavioural ﬁnance biases,
uninformed investors are more strongly affected by the biases. In other words, noise traders are
particularly prone to psychological biases in their trading behaviour.
BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE
Behavioural ﬁnance applies the ﬁndings of psychological research on decision-making to
investment decisions. Apparent irrationalities in decision-making are seen as arising from two
sources. First, there are errors in the processing of information.This partly arises from self-
deception. Second, there are biases and errors in the decision-making based on the processed
information.This is partly due to heuristic simpliﬁcation.In other words people perceive situations
inaccurately,and then make decisions that are inconsistent with perceptions.There are two layers
of errors.
There is evidence from psychological studies that there are systematic biases in the way people
think. Research has found a number of systematic biases that affect investors.These include
overconﬁdence, illusion of control, hindsight bias, conﬁrmation bias, cognitive dissonance,
representativeness, retrievability, narrow framing, mental accounting, conservatism, status quo
bias,anchoring,ambiguity-aversion,loss-aversion,regret,emotion,group-think,and herding (see
Chapter 2 on the psychology of personal investment decisions).All of these biases interfere with
the process of rational decision-making that is assumed by the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
However Ko and Huang (2007) have suggested that overconﬁdence could be beneﬁcial,rather
than detrimental,to market efﬁciency.There is a view that since it is costly to acquire information
in terms of time and money, it is rational to limit the amount of information acquired.This is
referred to as rational inattention (Huang and Liu 2007).According to Ko and Huang overconﬁdent
investors would devote more resources to the acquisition of information than more rational
investors.Since overconﬁdent investors believe that they can use information proﬁtably,they will
seek relatively large amounts of information.An effect of this behaviour of overconﬁdent investors
is that more information is put into the market.In consequence stock prices reﬂect a larger amount
of information and hence get closer to their fundamental, or true, values. In other words
overconﬁdent investors make markets more efﬁcient.
UNDERREACTION
Figure 24.1 illustrates the share price movements when there is overreaction or underreaction.
At time T there is an item of news to which the share price should move,from P1 to P2,as indicated
by the unbroken line. If the market overreacts, the price rises to P3 before moving to P2. If there
is underreaction, the initial price movement is insufﬁcient. Initially the share price moves only to
P4, the remaining price movement occurring subsequently.

If there were a consistent tendency to under- or overreaction to new information, investors
could proﬁt from the information. Underreaction would imply that investors could proﬁt from
buying subsequent to the news. Overreaction would provide proﬁts from selling after the news.
The opportunity to make such proﬁts is inconsistent with the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
The concept of conservatism suggests that investors are slow to change their views following
the receipt of new information. This is consistent with the research ﬁndings that following
unexpected earnings announcements it can take several weeks for the resulting stock price
movements to be completed. Investors take time to change their views about a stock, following
news of unexpectedly high or low company proﬁts.
The idea of cognitive dissonance relates to the desire to avoid dissonance. Dissonance occurs
when new information contradicts existing beliefs.The extent of the dissonance depends on the
level of commitment to the beliefs. Commitment develops when the individual has a choice to
make.The level of commitment to that choice (and the commitment to the beliefs associated with
it) increases with the amount of money, time, and effort invested in that choice or set of beliefs.
The level of commitment is stronger where the choice or belief deviates from the norm. Group-
think is a name given to the tendency for members of a group to share beliefs and to mutually
reinforce those beliefs (Hilton 2001). If an individual takes a view that deviates from the group-
think norm, the degree of commitment to that view will be high.
A phenomenon similar to conservatism is anchoring. People often start from a particular
value,the anchor,and then adjust their evaluation from this point.The anchor might,for example,
be the purchase price of a share or the highest price that it has reached. It has been suggested
that most people adjust too conservatively and hence give too much weight to the anchor value
when evaluating the appropriate value for an investment.This can cause investors to underestimate
possible deviations from their original estimates (Shefrin 2000;Tversky and Kahneman 1982,
1982c).

In an experiment Tversky and Kahneman (1974) asked people to answer such questions as
‘What is the percentage of African nations in the UN?’A wheel of fortune was spun in front of the
subjects who were then asked whether their answer was above or below the number provided by
the wheel.They were then asked to give their answers.The subjects were found to be heavily
inﬂuenced by the wheel of fortune. For example the average estimate was 25 and 45 for groups
that received 10 and 65 respectively from the wheel.
Professional analysts,such as stockbrokers,appear to be subject to anchoring.It might be thought
that if an analyst suggests an appropriate price for a share and the share price subsequently moves
away from that level, an investor would see a trading opportunity. For example a fall in the share
price below the analyst’s forecast should indicate a buying opportunity. Unfortunately for the
private investor, the effect of the share price move seems to be that the analyst moves the forecast
in the same direction as the share price. Cornell (2000) demonstrated this effect in relation to
Intel.Those results were consistent with studies by Womack (1996), and Brav and Lehavy (2001)
whose ﬁndings showed that adjustments subsequent to analysts’ forecasts took the form of the
forecasts being changed towards actual prices rather than actual share prices moving towards the
forecasts.This throws doubt on the idea that investment analysts move share prices towards the levels
consistent with relevant information,and hence throws doubt on the idea that markets are efﬁcient.
The appropriate prices of shares are uncertain and past prices are likely to be anchors for
current prices.Stock markets tend to underreact to information such as earnings reports (e.g.Liu
et al. 2001);and investors may expect a company’s earnings to be in line with an apparent historical
trend (and underreact to a deviation from that apparent trend).This is consistent with past prices
acting as anchors for future prices. Anchoring may also explain the expectation, held by many
investors including technical analysts,of a share price trading within a range of values for a period
of time.All of these effects of anchoring can hinder the process of incorporating new information
into a share price,with the effect that it takes time for the price to reﬂect all relevant information.
The fear of regret is another explanation for underreaction. If an investment decision proves
to be incorrect there would be the pain of regret at having made a bad decision. One defence
against the risk of regret is the avoidance of decisions. Fear of regret could slow the process of
incorporating new information into share prices through transactions in the shares.
Ambiguity-aversion (alternatively known as familiarity bias) suggests that investors prefer to
invest in companies that they feel that they understand. Over 90% of the equity investments of
investors in the United States, UK, and Japan is in companies in their own countries.This home
bias exists despite the demonstrated beneﬁts of international diversiﬁcation. Likewise there are
biases towards the investor’s local region and the ﬁrm that employs them.This preference for the
familiar results in the holding of portfolios that are insufﬁciently diversiﬁed. In consequence
investors bear more risk than is necessary.The bias also hinders the ﬂow of money to some areas
or sectors. In consequence asset prices are slow to adjust to new information.The unfamiliar
remains underpriced and the familiar remains overpriced.
OVERREACTION
Overconﬁdence causes people to overestimate their abilities and to overestimate the accuracy of
their forecasts. Overconﬁdence arises partly from self-attribution bias.This is a tendency on the
part of investors to regard successes as arising from their expertise whilst failures are due to bad

luck or the actions of others.This leads to excessive conﬁdence in one’s own powers of forecasting.
Overconﬁdence appears to be greater when feedback on decisions is deferred or ambiguous
(Fischhoff et al. 1977).Financial markets are characterised by delayed feedback,since anticipated
price adjustments can take a considerable amount of time.The feedback is also ambiguous (are
outcomes to be judged in absolute terms, or relative to a benchmark – and what benchmark is
appropriate?). Noise trading in ﬁnancial markets can cause feedback to be inconclusive (might
apparently successful forecasting merely be the accidental result of noise?).
Overconﬁdence is capable of explaining a number of types of apparently irrational behaviour.
For example it can explain why some investors hold undiversiﬁed portfolios.If investors are highly
conﬁdent about their stock selection abilities, they will not feel the need to reduce risk by means
of diversiﬁcation. It could also explain why some investors trade very frequently, to the point
where transaction costs cause their investment behaviour to be loss making (Barber and Odean
2000, 2001a).
To the extent that some investors attribute their proﬁts from rising markets to their own talents,
rising markets could be self-perpetuating. Overconﬁdent investors may be encouraged to invest
further and thereby reinforce an upward movement in stock prices. Conversely a falling market
reduces conﬁdence and investing.This is consistent with the view that markets exhibit overreaction.
In one study of overconﬁdence Lichenstein and Fischoff (1977) gave people market reports on
12 stocks and asked them to forecast the direction in which their prices would move.Whereas only
47% of the predictions were correct, on average people were 65% conﬁdent that their forecasts
would be correct.
Odean (1998a) has shown that one of the effects of overconﬁdence is that turnover of
investments tends to be high,that is people trade shares more as a result of overconﬁdence.Barber
and Odean (2000) have shown that as turnover rises net proﬁts tend to fall.Psychological research
has found that men tend to be more overconﬁdent than women.Barber and Odean (2001a) found
that single men trade 67% more than single women. Correspondingly single men on average
experienced investment returns 3.5% per year lower than single women.
Some other biases tend to reinforce overconﬁdence. According to the conﬁrmation bias,
investors pay more attention to evidence that supports their opinions than to evidence that
contradicts them.This can cause investors to persist with unsuccessful investment strategies.
Another cognitive bias is the illusion of control. In some circumstances people behave as if they
were able to exert control, or able to forecast events, where this is impossible or unlikely.The
illusion of control is associated with the underestimation of risk.Also related to the concept of
overconﬁdence is optimism bias. Optimism bias is the tendency for people to regard themselves
as better than average (Hilton 2001).
The hindsight bias is the inability to correctly remember one’s prior expectations after observing
new information.The hindsight bias prevents people learning from their own mistakes,since they
are unable to remember those mistakes.People are unable to recognise their own errors.There is
self-denial about past errors. If someone has a self-image of being a clever investor, past errors in
forecasting may be subject to distortions of memory aimed at maintaining the self-image.Memory
is never a faithful recollection of the past; it is amended by the human mind.
Good decision-making in ﬁnancial markets relies on learning from the past.Learning may entail
the comparison of new information with previous expectations.This requires an accurate recall
of previous expectations. The hindsight bias involves the contamination of recollections of
MARKET EFFICIENCY

expectations by new information.The recalled expectations of an outcome are biased towards
information about the outcome.The person remembers forming an expectation that is close to
what subsequently happened.
The hindsight bias can lead to overreaction by investors. People may form expectations by
averaging outcomes with their previous expectations of those outcomes.For example expectations
of future returns could be formed by averaging realised investment returns with previously
expected returns.Hindsight-biased investors,when forming such averages,incorrectly remember
their prior expectations. They amend their memories in the light of realised returns. New
information about returns thus becomes overweighted, and hence has excessive inﬂuence on the
formation of expectations. Expectations change too much.The result is overreaction to the new
information. Hindsight bias is not limited to naive investors; Biais and Weber (2006) found that
market professionals were prone to hindsight bias.
Representativeness helps to explain why many investors seem to extrapolate price movements.
Many investors appear to believe that if prices have been rising in the past then they will continue
to rise, and conversely with falling prices.The concept of representativeness suggests that this is
because those investors see an investment with recent price increases as representative of longer-
term successful investments, conversely with price falls. DeBondt and Thaler (1985) argued that
because investors are subject to the representativeness bias, they could become too optimistic
about past winners and too pessimistic about past losers. Trading that is inﬂuenced by the
representativeness bias can move share prices away from the levels that accurately reﬂect all relevant
information.
Everyone uses heuristics. Heuristics are rules of thumb that help people to make sense of the
deluge of information with which they are bombarded. Social psychology has established that we
tend to judge people by appearances. If someone, who is newly encountered, resembles a person
one has known then it is assumed that the new acquaintance has a similar personality to the older
acquaintance. Representativeness refers to the tendency to evaluate something with reference to
something else, which it resembles.A share price pattern that was followed by a price rise in the
past may be seen as indicating a price rise in the future.
One aspect of representativeness is often referred to as the law of small numbers. It is a belief
that random samples will resemble each other more closely than the principles of statistical
sampling theory would predict.People tend to have an image of what a random sample should look
like, and take the view that samples that differ from the image are not random. Consider the
following two sequences of coin tossing:
THTHHT
and
TTTHHH
Both sequences are equally likely but when asked which is more likely most people will say the
ﬁrst.The ﬁrst series ﬁts the image of a random sequence whereas the second does not.
This may help to explain the popularity of chartism;people do not always see random sequences
as being random, and tend to attribute patterns to the sequences. People are biased towards

believing that a causal factor is the reason for a sequence of events and ﬁnd it difﬁcult to accept
that events can occur by chance; they are reluctant to accept that an apparent pattern can emerge
purely by chance.Investors tend to over-interpret patterns that arise from coincidence.A pattern
arising from coincidence may be interpreted as indicative,or representative,of a genuine pattern
of events.A result could be overreaction to a random sequence of events even when the number
of events is small or the length of the sequence is short (Kahneman and Riepe 1998).
Cooper et al. (2001) provided an interesting example of representativeness.They studied ﬁrms
that changed their names to incorporate some mention of dot.com between June 1998 and July
1999,a period which coincided with the dot.com share price bubble.Some of the ﬁrms that made
the change did not signiﬁcantly operate in the Internet business. It was found that those non-
Internet ﬁrms,on average,experienced a 140% increase in share price during the 60 days following
the name change.The name changes conveyed no information about the operations of the ﬁrms.
Some investors appear to have seen the letters ‘dot.com’ in a name as representative of potential
strong performers.
Retrievability bias causes too much attention to be given to the most easily recalled information
(it is alternatively known as the availability or memory bias). In consequence there is a tendency
to give too much emphasis to the most recent information. Retrievability is consistent with the
overreaction hypothesis, one dimension of which is the overemphasis on recent information and
recent events when making investment decisions.According to the overreaction hypothesis share
prices are prone to rise too high and fall too low. Experiments by Kahneman and Tversky (1972,
1973) indicated that people not only give too much weight to recent experience when making
forecasts but also make forecasts that are too extreme.Another aspect of the retrievability bias is
the overemphasis on one’s own experience. Some people appear to learn only from their own
mistakes, rather than being able to learn from the experiences of others.The retrievability bias
limits the amount of information used in investment decision-making,and hence limits the amount
of information reﬂected in asset prices as a result of trading.
It has been observed that the shares of companies with low price-earnings ratios tend to
outperform those of companies with high price-earnings ratios.This has been called the price-
earnings ratio effect.DeBondt and Thaler (1990) argued that this price-earnings ratio effect could
be explained in terms of extreme expectations of future earnings growth.The extreme forecasts
of earnings growth lead to excessively high share prices and hence price-earnings ratios that are
too high,and which subsequently fall when the error is realised.Thus the shares of ﬁrms with high
price-earnings ratios tend to perform less well than the shares of ﬁrms with low price-earnings
ratios,since some price decline is required in order to correct the exaggerated price-earnings ratio.
Francis et al. (2004) cited evidence that professional investment analysts’ earnings forecasts
tend to be overoptimistic with the degree of exaggeration increasing as the forecast horizon
becomes longer.Cornell (2001),when examining the case of Intel,concluded that many analysts’
recommendations were based on factors other than divergences between market price and
fundamental value. Possible factors mentioned were rating the company, as well as the stock, and
reacting to the recent price movement of the stock (the momentum effect of extrapolation).
Francis et al. cited evidence that professional investment analysts exhibited herding behaviour such
that they were inﬂuenced by each other’s forecasts and hence produced similar forecasts.Any of
these possible factors could exaggerate market swings in response to announcements of changes
in company performance, and hence generate overreaction.

INACCURATE PERCEPTIONS OF RISK
Narrow framing refers to the tendency of investors to focus too narrowly. One aspect is focus on
the constituents of a portfolio rather than the portfolio as a whole.Another dimension of narrow
framing is the focus on the short term even when the investment horizon is long term. It is not
rational for an investor accumulating assets for retirement 25 years hence to be concerned about
the week-by-week performance of the portfolio.Yet long-term investors do focus on short-term
volatility. Studies have shown that when, in experimental situations, people have been presented
with monthly distributions of returns they are less likely to invest than when they are shown annual
distributions (with the annualised volatility being the same in both cases).The implication is that
focus on short-term volatility deters investment.It appears that people do not appreciate the effects
of time diversiﬁcation.By time diversiﬁcation is meant the tendency for good periods to offset bad
periods with the effect that the dispersion of investment returns does not increase proportionately
with the period of the investment. Investors who focus too much on short-term ﬂuctuations
overestimate stock market risk and allocate too little of their money to investment in shares.
This has been suggested as a possible explanation of what is called ‘The Equity Premium Puzzle’.
The puzzle is why the excess of equity returns over returns on bonds and deposits is so high (when
averaged over long periods of time). Although additional return is appropriate in order to
compensate for the extra risk, it is generally thought that the additional return actually received
is much more than is justiﬁed by the extra risk.However if investors focus too strongly on the short
term they may overestimate equity risk and hence require an excessive premium on the expected
rate of return in order to induce them to invest in shares. Focus on individual stocks, rather than
the portfolio as a whole, would also cause investors to overestimate stock market risk since the
risk of individual shares exceeds the risk of portfolios.In terms of explaining the equity premium
puzzle, these factors may be reinforced by loss-aversion.The idea of loss-aversion comes from
prospect theory and suggests that people are much more sensitive to losses than to gains.Investors
may not only overestimate the likelihood of large losses,they also feel a disproportionate amount
of pain as a result of losses (Benartzi and Thaler 1995).
The idea of mental accounts has similarities with narrow framing.The principle of mental
accounts sees people as separating aspects of their ﬁnances into separate accounts rather than seeing
their ﬁnancial situation as an integrated whole.For example income and wealth may be segregated
such that only current income is used for current spending, and wealth is treated as something to
be preserved. In consequence changes in the level of wealth have little effect on spending.
The concept of mental accounts has been proposed as an explanation of the apparent preference,
on the part of many investors, for stocks that pay high dividends (Statman 1997). Such investors
may be prepared to use dividends to ﬁnance spending since dividends are seen as income,whereas
they would not sell some of their shares to fund expenditure even when the real value of the shares
has increased. Dividends are treated as available for spending but capital gains are not.
Mental accounting can cause investors to overestimate risk by failing to take the risk-reduction
effects of diversiﬁcation into consideration. Chapter 13 on portfolio diversiﬁcation shows how
combining assets into a portfolio reduces risk since poor performances from some investments
may be offset by good performances from others.If an investor separates investments into different
mental accounts, the potential risk reduction of such offsetting is ignored. In consequence total
risk is overestimated.

Hindsight-biased investors may underestimate volatility.This is because they amend their
recollected expectations into line with observed outcomes.A rational investor, upon observing a
return that is substantially different from the previously expected return, would raise the
expectation of volatility. A hindsight-biased investor would not be aware of the substantial
discrepancy, and would therefore underestimate volatility. Hindsight-biased investors form
distorted expectations of future returns and risk, and as a result construct inefﬁcient investment
portfolios. Hindsight bias, by distorting expectations of return and risk, can prevent share prices
from reﬂecting relevant information.
The illusion of control is the tendency to believe that chance events are amenable to personal
control (Langer 1975).The illusion of control can cause an underestimation of risk. If events are
seen as controllable,they will be seen as less risky (Gollwitzer and Kinney 1989).DeBondt (1998)
suggested that one manifestation of the illusion of control was the belief of many investors that they
would be sufﬁciently astute to sell before a large fall in prices.This belief that they would be able
to avoid losses by selling in time causes such investors to underestimate the risks of their
investments.The degree of illusion of control can be affected by the individual’s environment
(Taylor and Armor 1996).Competitive and stressful environments can produce illusion of control
(Friedland et al. 1992).Fenton-O’Creevy et al. (2005) found that traders in ﬁnancial markets were
subject to the illusion of control.They also found that the illusion of control was associated with
poorer performance.
The illusion of knowledge is the tendency for people to believe that additional information
always increases the accuracy of their forecasts.It is the belief that more information increases the
person’s knowledge and hence improves decisions (Peterson and Pitz 1988).For example people
often believe that knowledge of previous drawings of lottery numbers improves their ability to
predict future lottery numbers.Some information is irrelevant,or may be beyond a person’s ability
to interpret,but the person may still regard the information as improving their ability to forecast.
Tumarkin and Whitelaw (2001) found that, despite providing no useful information, website
message board postings increased trading volume in the respective shares. Despite the absence of
useful information from the messages, as indicated by subsequent price movements, it appeared
that some investors believed that it added to their knowledge and expertise (and traded as a result).
The illusion of knowledge causes investors to be overconﬁdent and to misinterpret the amount of
risk from an investment.Investors,who overestimate the accuracy of their forecasts,underestimate
the risks taken.
Fenton-O’Creevy et al. (2005) found that professional traders also failed to appreciate the
signiﬁcance of sample size for risk. In the case of an illiquid stock there would be few trades, in
other words a small sample size. In the case of liquid stocks there would be a high volume of
trading, and hence a large sample of trades. A particular percentage deviation from a previous
price is more likely to be a chance event when trades are infrequent than when they are frequent.
A 10% price change in an infrequently traded share is more likely to be the result of random
variation than the same percentage change in the price of a heavily traded share.
According to the familiarity bias, people tend to prefer things that seem familiar to them.
Correspondingly investors prefer investments with which they feel familiar. Familiarity appears
to reduce the perceived risk.Arguably the most familiar investments are those in the company for
which the investor works.A study by John Hancock Financial Services (Driscoll et al. 1995) found
that a majority of employees believed that shares in their own company were less risky than a

diversiﬁed portfolio. Benartzi (2001) reported the ﬁndings of a survey which indicated that only
16.4% of respondents believed that shares in their own company were more risky than the stock
market as a whole. Kilka and Weber (2000) found that Americans believed the US stock market
would perform better than the German stock market whereas Germans believed that their stock
market would be the stronger performer.Generally the evidence indicates that people view familiar
stocks favourably,expecting them to deliver both higher returns and a lower level of risk.The result
is that portfolios are biased towards investments that seem familiar.Tourani-Rad and Kirkby (2005)
conﬁrmed the familiarity bias in New Zealand,in that they found that the portfolios of New Zealand
investors contained a disproportionate amount of New Zealand stocks but they did not conﬁrm that
it was the result of higher optimism with regard to the future performance of New Zealand stocks.
Finance professionals typically measure risk as the expected standard deviation of returns on
an investment. The standard deviation of returns is a measure of volatility. It is assumed by
conventional ﬁnance models,such as the Markowitz portfolio diversiﬁcation model,that volatility
and perceived risk are closely related. However research has found that there can be substantial
differences between volatility and perceived risk. Choices appear to be better explained by
perceived risk than by volatility (Jia et al.1999).Perceived risk,in contrast to volatility,incorporates
affective (emotional) reactions to uncertainty (Loewenstein et al. 2001).The distinction between
volatility and perceived risk was reinforced by Weber et al. (2005).They found that presentational
factors that affected expected volatility had no effect on perceived risk,and that perceived risk had
more effect on investment choice than expected volatility.The familiarity of asset names, which
may be expected to elicit emotional responses,had strong effects on risk perception and investment
choice.This is consistent with the other evidence relating to the familiarity bias.
Vividness appears to be a factor in the incorporation of emotion into the perception of risk.
Vividness refers to the emotional interest or excitement engendered by an event (Plous 1993).
Stock market bubbles and crashes are examples of vivid events.The effects of vividness on attitudes
and behaviour are not necessarily reasonable but are not permanent (Grable et al. 2006).
Prospect Theory
There are three key elements to prospect theory: (1) perceived probabilities are subject to bias,
(2) investors are more concerned about gains and losses than levels of wealth, and (3) investors
feel losses more than gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1972, 1973, 1982).
In relation to perceived probabilities, the biases are tendencies to exaggerate small and large
probabilities and underweight medium ones. See Figure 24.2.
In this ﬁgure,subjective (perceived) probabilities are referred to as decision weightings.When
plotted against actual probabilities the decision weights are too high at low and high probabilities
and too low at medium probabilities.The exaggeration of high probabilities suggests that highly
likely (but not certain) events are treated as being certain.This is consistent with the idea of
overconﬁdence. Investors can become overconﬁdent about their forecasts to the extent that they
forget that markets are uncertain.
Figure 24.3 is a value function. It depicts subjective values assigned to gains and losses relative
to a reference point.The reference point is subjective and may,for example,be the purchase price
of an investment.The reference point divides the region where someone feels that they are making
gains from the region in which they feel that they are making losses.

It is to be noted that the slope of the function for losses is steeper than the slope for gains.This
is because,on average,people ﬁnd the pain of losses to be about 2.25 times as intense as the pleasure
from gains. Given an evens chance of winning or losing, people on average require the prospect
of a £225 win to balance the prospect of a £100 loss.This relatively large fear of loss, known as
loss-aversion, will tend to deter retail investors from stock market related investments.When
combined with narrow framing and mental accounting,this asymmetric perception of risk increases
the total perceived risk and thereby distorts decision-making. Risk premiums are too high, and
hence asset prices are too low.

This is consistent with the ‘endowment effect’(Thaler 1980).People often require much more
to sell something than they were originally prepared to pay for it (Kahneman et al. 1990, 1991).
This is seen as being associated with the pain of giving something up.
Another feature of Figure 24.3 is the tendency for the slope of the value function to become
less steep as gains or losses increase.This implies that as gains are made investors will become less
inclined to take risks,since the addition to value of a higher gain is less than the reduction in value
resulting from a lowered gain.It also implies that as losses increase investors become more willing
to accept risk.This is because the value of a loss reduction outweighs the value of a further loss.
So, for example, in a losing situation an ‘evens’ bet looks attractive.An aspect of loss-aversion is
that people will avoid the risk of making losses (by avoiding risks) when in a gaining situation but
will accept risk in order to attempt to recover from a loss.Prospect theory sees investors as being
loss-averse rather than risk-averse.
This behaviour in a loss-making situation is consistent with the idea of an escalation bias (Shefrin
2001).An Escalation Bias leads to ‘averaging down’ whereby as the price falls the investment is
treated as being an increasingly good bargain.The thinking is that if a share was a good buy at £2,
it is a fantastic bargain at £1 and more should be bought. It is psychologically difﬁcult to consider
the possibility that the initial purchase was at an excessively high price.
According to prospect theory,people in a position of gain become increasingly risk-averse and
unwilling to accept gambles.When people are in a position of loss they become more inclined to
accept risk.This may help to explain the disposition effect.The disposition effect is the inclination,
when selling part of a portfolio,to sell assets that have risen in price relative to their purchase prices
rather than assets that have fallen in price.The disposition effect can move share prices away from
their fair values.Prices rise too slowly because of sales,and fall too slowly because of lack of sales.
Prices thus fail to reﬂect all relevant information.
The disposition effect can be explained in terms of the avoidance of regret and the pursuit of
pride.People want to feel good about themselves and hence take decisions that provide pride and
avoid regret.Shefrin and Statman (1984) showed that these factors inﬂuence investment decisions.
The sale of an investment that has risen in price produces the pleasant feeling that the investment
decision was a good one.The sale of an investment that has fallen in price produces the unpleasant
feeling that the original investment choice was a bad one. By realising successes through selling
successful investments,and not realising failures,an investor can preserve the self-image of being
a good investor. In consequence investors are more likely to sell investments showing gains than
investments showing losses.
There is empirical research evidence in support of the disposition effect. For example Odean
(1998) found that, on average, investors are approximately 50% more likely to sell a winner than
a loser. Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) found that if a share outperforms the market by 10%, the
likelihood of sales increases by 26%,whereas an underperformance of 10% decreases the likelihood
of sales by 14%. It is not just private individuals; professional investors such as institutional fund
managers are also prone to the disposition effect (Frazzini 2006). Investors seem to prefer to sell
winners rather than losers.
Narrow framing and mental accounting also help to explain the disposition effect. The
disposition effect would not operate unless investors mentally separated components of portfolios.
There is evidence from mutual funds supportive of the prospect theory proposition that risk
taking increases following losses, and declines following gains. Elton et al. (2003) studied mutual

fund managers who were paid incentive fees; in other words whose fees were related to the
performance of the funds managed by them.They observed that mutual fund managers when paid
incentive fees were more likely to increase risk after periods of poor performance and to decrease
risk following periods of strong performance. Incentive fees mean that the fund manager has a
personal ﬁnancial interest in fund performance and the ﬁndings of Elton et al. may be dependent
upon the presence of incentive fees.This dependence is suggested by a study from Ammann and
Verhofen (2007) who found that the behaviour of mutual fund managers seemed to contradict
prospect theory.They found that strong prior performance led to increased risk taking (for example
increased beta and more small capitalisation stocks) whereas poor performance tended to lead to
the adoption of passive strategies, which exhibit lower risk.
INVESTORS HAVE FEELINGS
The size effect is the apparent tendency for the shares of small ﬁrms to outperform the shares of
large ﬁrms.The book-to-market effect is the apparent tendency for the shares of companies with
high book values relative to share prices to outperform the shares of companies with relatively low
book values. DeBondt and Thaler (1987) argue that regret theory is consistent with both the size
and book-to-market effects.Psychologists have found that individuals who make decisions that turn
out badly have more regret (blame themselves more) when that decision was relatively
unconventional.Losses on shares in a major blue-chip ﬁrm cause less regret than losses on a small,
little-known ﬁrm.The former loss may be regarded as bad luck whereas the latter loss may be
attributed to poor judgement. Higher book-to-market ﬁrms tend to have lower stock prices,
perhaps because they are unfashionable, or in difﬁculties. Investments in ﬁrms that are small,
unfashionable,or in difﬁculties are more unconventional.There is a high risk of feeling regret.Such
investments are not the choices of the majority and require more courage and risk taking on the
part of investors. Investors are betting on the accuracy of their own judgement. More courage is
required to make investments in the shares of small, unfashionable, or problematic ﬁrms and as a
result the shares of such ﬁrms tend to be shunned by many investors.In consequence those shares
tend to have current prices that are low relative to the objective characteristics of the ﬁrms. Such
relative underpricing provides potential for future outperformance in terms of the total returns
on the shares.
In addition to cognitive biases, moods and emotions may have a role in investment decision-
making. Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) found that sunshine is strongly correlated with
stock returns. Presumably sunshine causes investors to be happy and makes them feel more
favourable towards investments.The relationship,between mood (emotions) and decision-making,
has also been established by other researchers (Loewenstein et al. 2001; Slovic et al. 2002; Forgas
1995;Wright and Bower 1992; Kamstra et al. 2003). Even quantitative share pricing models
involve an element of judgement that is affected by mood and emotion. For example dividend
discount models, such as the Gordon growth model, involve estimates of future dividend growth
rates. It may be that optimism arising from a good mood leads to a high estimate for the growth
rate of dividends.That high estimate would result in the expected (fair) price of the share being
relatively high.The rational investor of the efﬁcient market hypothesis is an unemotional decision-
maker. Emotions and moods may be irrelevant pieces of information that become reﬂected in
share prices.

Users of pricing models are likely to be professionals. Shiller (1984) pointed out that most
non-professional investors do not have knowledge of pricing models and investment analysis.They
are likely to be noise traders affected by rumour and social mood. Social mood is a collectively
shared state of mind (Prechter 1999;Nofsinger 2005;Olson 2006).Investors with no knowledge
of analysis are particularly likely to be inﬂuenced by social mood when making investment
decisions. DeLong et al. (1990) posited a class of investors whose expectations were not justiﬁed
by fundamentals; they referred to them as noise traders. Unjustiﬁed expectations are referred to
as investor sentiment.When sentiment is shared amongst investors,stock prices can deviate from
fundamental values for long periods.
Evidence for the impact of social mood on stock prices is provided in Chapter 2 on the
psychology of personal investment decisions and in Chapter 27 on stock market bubbles and
crashes. Further evidence for the inﬂuence of social mood on share prices comes from Edmans et
al. (2007) who measured social mood using the results of international football (soccer) matches.
Stock markets were found to decline following defeats.The effects were related to the importance
of the matches, and to the importance of football to the country (very important in Europe and
Latin America, unimportant in North America).The effects were most pronounced amongst
smaller company stocks;which is consistent with the observation that smaller company stocks are
predominantly held by investors in the company’s own country rather than in international
portfolios. It is also consistent with other studies, which have found that the shares of small
companies are the most affected by investor sentiment.The effect was found to be present in
relation to other sports, but not as strongly as in the case of football.There was no apparent
tendency for stock markets to rise following wins.
The ﬁndings of Edmans et al. (2007) are consistent with the results of other studies relevant to
the relationship between football results and social mood.For example Schwarz et al. (1987) found
that the results of international football matches affected feelings of well-being and views on
national issues. Carroll et al. (2002) found a 25% increase in heart attacks in England following
England’s defeat by Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. Other studies have found that murder and
suicide rates increase following sports defeats.There appear to be no corresponding improvements
in social mood following wins.Edmans et al. relate the asymmetry of responses to losses and wins
to prospect theory.According to prospect theory the pain of a loss is more than twice the pleasure
of a win.Also prospect theory measures gains and losses against a reference point.If allegiance bias
causes supporters to expect their team to win,the outcome of a match is evaluated relative to that
expectation. So a win merely conﬁrms the expectation whereas a loss represents a downward
deviation from the expected outcome.
Lee et al. (1991) found that investment trust (US closed-end fund) discounts were not affected
by macroeconomic factors.Those ﬁndings imply that the discounts are not affected by economic
fundamentals.The researchers observed that investment trusts were particularly popular among
small investors, as were smaller company stocks and new issues (initial public offerings).They
found that movements in investment trust discounts,small company share prices,and the volume
of new issues were correlated.They interpreted this as evidence for the inﬂuence of sentiment
among small investors.
Emotions can be particularly important when there is ‘ego-involvement’,which entails investors
identifying with their investment choices (Dweck and Leggett 1988).There is evidence that such
people may hold on to particular investments too long (Sandelands et al. 1988).Ego-involvement

is also likely to magnify the effects of stress (Riess and Taylor 1984) and thereby reduce the quality
of investment decision-making.
Baker and Nofsinger (2002) suggest an attachment bias,whereby investors become emotionally
attached to particular investments. Emotional attachment can cause investors to focus on good
features and ignore bad ones. Bad news may be ignored.This could hinder the incorporation of
information into a share price.If investors ignore bad news,the share price may fail to fully reﬂect
that bad news. Baker and Nofsinger suggest that one way to avoid the effects of emotion, and
perhaps other psychological biases, is to invest in index tracker funds. Arguably investors are
relatively unlikely to become emotionally attached to index tracker funds.
Investors not only have feelings, they are also prone to superstitions. Kahneman and Tversky
(1983) have suggested the existence of a ‘conjunction fallacy’.The conjunction fallacy is the belief
that contiguous events have a causal relationship. Unrelated, but simultaneous, events in two
markets might be seen as causally linked whereas they are actually unrelated. Also events in
successive time periods may be seen as forming a pattern when in reality they are independent
events. From this perspective technical analysis might be seen as a complex set of superstitions.
Evidence on the possibility of negative effects of emotions and moods on investment decision-
making comes from research on expert systems. Expert systems are computer programmes that
use relationships, provided by experts, to make decisions. Camerer (1981) found that expert
systems frequently outperformed the experts whose knowledge had been used in their creation.
This phenomenon is known as bootstrapping.It may be the case that the superior performance of
the computer arises from the absence of the effects of emotions and moods.
CRITICISMS OF BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE
There has been a tendency to establish psychological biases in laboratory conditions, and then to
assume that they operate in the real world. In the real world investors have data and models for
the generation of expectations. In the real world money is at stake. It may be that when money is
involved people make a greater effort to behave rationally. Competition between investment
professionals might be expected to remove errors of judgement resulting from psychological
biases. If rational investors seek proﬁts from arbitraging against irrational investors, the result
could be that the market as a whole behaves rationally even though some investors do not.This
argument is dependent upon arbitrage being effective.
Some behavioural ﬁnance theories predict that markets overreact to new information, whilst
others predict underreaction. This may lead to an inability to make forecasts and testable
predictions. Further, Fama (1998) has argued that apparent overreaction to information is about
as common as underreaction,and that this is consistent with the efﬁcient market hypothesis.There
are other conﬂicting predictions from behavioural ﬁnance. For example the endowment effect
and status quo effect predict that investors hold what they have, or do nothing, whereas the
overconﬁdence bias predicts that investors trade too much.The herding tendency to follow the
investment behaviour of others also appears to conﬂict with biases, such as overconﬁdence, that
cause investors to overestimate their abilities to choose potentially successful investments.
The ideas of noise trading and behavioural ﬁnance have been used as criticisms of the efﬁcient
market hypothesis. However the impact of these criticisms may depend upon how efﬁciency is
deﬁned. Damodaran (2001) deﬁnes market efﬁciency in terms of market prices being unbiased
MARKET EFFICIENCY

NOISE TRADING AND BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE

estimates of true value.According to this interpretation of informational efﬁciency the market price
of a share is not necessarily correct at a point in time, it is merely unbiased.An unbiased price is
one that randomly deviates from the true value,and the deviations are not related to other variables.
If market efﬁciency is deﬁned in terms of prices being unbiased estimates of true value,rather than
as fully reﬂecting all relevant information,it may be consistent with noise trading and behavioural
ﬁnance. Such consistency would depend upon deviations from true value being totally random.
This would imply an inability to consistently exploit the deviations in order to make proﬁts from
inaccurate pricing.
CONCLUSION
The efﬁcient market hypothesis assumes that investors behave rationally in the sense that they use
all relevant information and analyse it in the most effective way with a view of achieving the best
possible outcomes (maximising expected utility) for themselves.However many investors appear
to behave in irrational ways; irrelevant information such as rumour is used and the analysis may
be subject to misperceptions, emotions, and other psychological biases.
The behaviour of such irrational, or noise, traders may nonetheless be consistent with the
market being rational in two circumstances. One circumstance would be offsetting behaviour
among irrational investors, and the other would be market dominance of rational investors over
irrational investors. If the behaviour of irrational investors were random, their irrational actions
would tend to cancel out. Irrationally motivated purchases by some would tend to be offset by
irrational sales by others with little effect on the market as a whole, so that the investors who
behave rationally would determine market movements. Even if there were some uniformity of
behaviour among irrational investors, a sufﬁcient preponderance of rational investors could
neutralise the effects of the irrationality.For example if irrational behaviour caused an unwarranted
fall in the price of a share, rational investors would take advantage of the underpricing by buying
the shares.Those purchases would move the share price back up to its appropriate level. In this
way the rational investors would ensure that the market, as a whole, remained rational.
There are reasons to expect that irrational trades would not be mutually offsetting.Behaviours
such as herding and positive feedback trading will tend to point the market in a particular direction
(see Chapter 27 on stock market bubbles and crashes).For rational investors to offset the resulting
distortions they should be sufﬁcient in number, adequately capitalised, and unrestricted. It might
be expected that market professionals, such as the managers of institutional investment funds,
would be rational. However there is evidence that market professionals are prone to the same
social and psychological inﬂuences as other investors.Furthermore the fact that obvious arbitrage
opportunities can remain unexploited (see Chapter 23 on weak form market efﬁciency) suggests
that the professionals are either inadequately funded or otherwise constrained from investment
behaviour that would remove the effects of irrational trading.
From the perspective of the individual retail investor it may seem that irrational institutional
investment managers could be avoided by investing in funds that aim to track stock indices.

Unfortunately this does not completely avoid irrationality.If irrational investing increases the price
of a stock, index tracker funds will hold a higher proportion of that stock since the price rise
increases its market capitalisation. So index tracker funds hold disproportionately large amounts
of overpriced shares. Conversely shares that become underpriced would have low weightings in
tracker funds because of their low capitalisations.Index tracker funds would hold disproportionately
large amounts of overpriced shares, and disproportionately low quantities of underpriced shares.

Chapter 25
Market anomalies
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of the implications of market anomalies for
market efﬁciency, particularly in regard to:
1. Earnings surprises.
2. The size effect.
3. Value investing.
4. Calendar effects.
And also to provide knowledge of the difﬁculties encountered when interpreting evidence about
the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
A market is semi-strong form efﬁcient if either (1) security (share and bond) prices reﬂect all
relevant publicly available information, or (2) it is not possible to make proﬁts from the
identiﬁcation of mispricing.
An anomaly is an exception to a rule; in this case an observation that appears to contradict the
view that markets are informationally efﬁcient.The observation of anomalies provides evidence
against the semi-strong form of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
EARNINGS SURPRISES
One anomaly relates to the market response to earnings announcements. Although some early
studies of price reactions to earnings announcements concluded that the price changes were
completed very quickly, later research has suggested that part of the price response is subject to
a signiﬁcant time lag. If a lag occurs, investors would have the opportunity to make proﬁts
from knowledge of the earnings announcement.They would have time to undertake trades that
take advantage of the resulting price trends. For example if it takes two months for a share price
to complete a rise,an investor could buy after the earnings announcement and achieve proﬁts for
two months.
513

Latane and Jones (1979) developed the concept of standardised unexpected earnings, which
could be deﬁned as:
(actual earnings  predicted earnings)/(standard deviation of earnings).
The division by the standard deviation of earnings (or standard error of the estimate) reﬂects
the fact that the element of surprise or news in a particular difference between actual and predicted
earnings depends upon its relationship to previous differences.The surprise element in a particular
difference is greater for a ﬁrm whose earnings are normally stable.
Jones et al. (1984) found that a substantial part of the price adjustment to unexpected earnings
occurred after the day of the earnings announcement.Indeed price adjustments were still occurring
more than 60 days after the announcement.In an efﬁcient market,prices should adjust very quickly
to earnings announcements,rather than with a lag.Other researchers,using different samples and
different methods, have found similar results. For example Kanto et al. (1998) found that on the
Helsinki stock exchange the adjustment of share prices to unexpected reported earnings was
delayed by a statistically signiﬁcant period. Liu et al. (2003), when investigating UK data, also
found a post earnings announcement drift in share prices and hence concluded that the UK stock
market was inefﬁcient with respect to publicly available information about corporate earnings.
Doyle et al. (2006), whilst conﬁrming the earnings surprise effect, made observations about
the stocks with the greatest earnings surprises.They tended to have lower analyst coverage,small
market capitalisation, low institutional ownership, high book-to-market ratios, low trading
volumes, high trading costs, and high variation of analyst forecasts. So the stocks offering the
greatest apparent proﬁts tended to be the most difﬁcult and costly to trade, with the largest risk
of being mispriced. However the authors concluded that there was still value from following
investment strategies based on earnings surprise,even if the most extreme surprises are excluded
from the strategy.
THE SIZE EFFECT
Another anomaly has been referred to as the size effect.Banz (1981) found that small ﬁrms,in terms
of market capitalisation, had provided much greater investment returns than large ﬁrms. Other
researchers have conﬁrmed the size effect. Fortune (1991) calculated the cumulative value of
investments made in January 1926,one being in an S&P 500 portfolio and the other in a portfolio
of small ﬁrms’ stocks. He found that the latter signiﬁcantly outperformed the former. Heston et
al. (1999) found a size effect for a group of 12 European countries.Jensen et al. (1997) found that
US small ﬁrms generated a statistically signiﬁcant premium only when monetary policy is
expansionary. Reinganum (1999) found that small company shares only outperformed when
markets rose. Hulbert (1993) conﬁrmed the outperformance of small capitalisation stocks, but
concluded that there was no relative advantage from small company stocks when account is taken
of commissions. Dimson et al. (2004) questioned the continued existence of the size effect by
citing evidence that the small ﬁrm advantage reversed during the 1980s.
The shares of small companies are often traded infrequently.The absence of trades could mean
that their prices do not move while the market as a whole is moving. In consequence their betas
are underestimated. Also small ﬁrms would include those that have recently encountered
MARKET EFFICIENCY
514

difﬁculties, and borrowed heavily as a result.The increased gearing might have raised their betas
so that the betas based on past data are underestimates. If the estimated betas are too low then
expected returns would be too low.The observed high returns on small company stocks, relative
to expected returns, could be the result of low expectations rather than high returns.
Banz (1981) suggested that the higher returns could be due to higher betas (greater systematic
risk) and that the apparent excess of returns over what was expected on the basis of betas arose
from underestimating beta. More generally Banz suggested that the apparent size effect could be
due to inadequacies of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).The expected rate of return is
calculated by means of the CAPM.A deviation between the observed and expected rates of return
could be due to the CAPM providing incorrect estimates. Tests of market efﬁciency tend
simultaneously to be tests of the CAPM and the efﬁcient market hypothesis.Differences between
expected and observed rates of return could be the result of market inefﬁciency or defects of the
CAPM (or both). Evidence indicating that the size effect arises from problems with the CAPM
rather than from market inefﬁciency is provided by Chan et al. (1985).They showed that when
another pricing model (the arbitrage pricing model) was used to measure expected return, the
size effect disappeared.
Chen (1988) sought to explain the size effect in terms of arbitrage pricing theory.The small
ﬁrm premium was seen as a reward for risk;small ﬁrms suffer disproportionately during recessions
and provide higher expected returns to compensate for this risk. Chan and Chen (1991) argued
that many small ﬁrms have problems that render them more risky,and suggested that their relatively
high returns reﬂect increased risk.Berk (1995,1997) pointed out that market capitalisation is not
the only measure of size.If two ﬁrms are equal in size with respect to assets and cash ﬂows but one
has more risk than the other, the riskier ﬁrm will have a lower market capitalisation. So small
ﬁrms, measured by market capitalisation, tend to be relatively risky.The high returns to small
ﬁrms are compensation for high risk.Carvell and Strebel (1987) took the view that the small ﬁrm
effect was a proxy for the neglected ﬁrm effect. Small ﬁrms are neglected by analysts, and in
consequence there is more uncertainty about the market prices of small ﬁrms.Since little analysis
is carried out on small ﬁrms there is considerable risk of mispricing – either upwards or
downwards.The chance that an investor may be overpaying for a stock is a factor that increases the
risk of the stock to the investor. From this perspective, return premiums on small ﬁrms can be
regarded as compensation for bearing risk.
Another explanation of the size effect comes from behavioural ﬁnance.The familiarity bias
implies that people prefer investments that seem familiar. Familiar shares may feel less risky than
unfamiliar ones.Investors will normally have heard much more about large companies than small
ones.The resulting familiarity may lead to increased purchases of the shares of large companies.
In consequence those share prices are bid up,and hence the prospective rates of return fall.So the
size effect may derive more from the low yields of large (familiar) ﬁrms than from the high returns
of small ﬁrms.The current author is not aware of any studies that have investigated this explanation
of the size effect. However there are several studies that have found the familiarity bias in other
investment contexts (Huberman 2001; French and Poterba 1991; Coval and Moskowitz 1999).
The issue of whether the apparent abnormally high returns from smaller company stocks is
explicable in terms of market inefﬁciency, problems with the capital asset pricing model, or
compensation for risk remains unresolved. However the size effect appears to be related to two
other anomalies: the price-earnings ratio effect and the January effect.

VALUE INVESTING (RATIO EFFECTS)
The main ratios that have been researched and used in stock selection are (1) the price/earnings
ratio,(2) the dividend/price ratio (i.e.dividend yield),and (3) the book-price ratio (alternatively
known as the book-to-market ratio).Shares exhibiting one or more of a low price-earnings ratio,
a high dividend yield, and high book-to-market (low price-to-book) ratio are often referred to as
value stocks.Value investing is an investment style that weights portfolios towards such shares.
The price-earnings ratio effect has been investigated by Basu (1977) and Reinganum (1981)
among others.They both found that the shares of ﬁrms with low price-earnings ratios tended
to yield abnormally high returns. However Reinganum concluded that the price-earnings ratio
effect is a proxy for the size effect, whereas Basu took the view that the size effect was a proxy
for the price-earnings ratio effect. Since companies with low price-earnings ratios tend to be
small, it is difﬁcult to judge whether the high returns are the result of size or the price-earnings
ratio. Levy and Lerman (1985) found that after adjusting for the transaction costs necessary to
rebalance a portfolio in order to maintain the low price-earnings ratio as prices and earnings
change over time, the superior performance of portfolios of low price-earnings ratio stocks no
longer held.
Jaffe et al. (1989) investigated US stocks over the period 1951–86.They ranked ﬁrms by
earnings-price ratios (the reciprocal of the price-earnings ratio) and placed them in six groups.
The ﬁrst group had negative earnings (losses) and the other ﬁve groups contained stocks with
successively greater earnings-price ratios.The stocks in each earnings-price group were then
ranked according to size, with ﬁve size-based sub-groups within each earnings-price group.This
procedure produced 30 stock portfolios.They found that returns rose with increasing earnings-
price ratios (decreasing price-earnings ratios).They also found that returns were inversely related
to ﬁrm size (i.e. ﬁrms with smaller market capitalisations had the higher returns). However the
high earnings-price ratio ﬁrms tended to be small ﬁrms,so the question arose as to whether there
were two different effects.When attempting to separate the two effects they concluded that they
were separate and that each effect produced an increase in return of more than 3% p.a. when
moving between the bottom and top groups in each case.
Roll (1995) reported that low price-earnings ratio stocks in the US (1985–94) produced the
highest risk-adjusted returns, whether the risk adjustment was based on the capital asset pricing
model or arbitrage pricing theory. Lakonishok et al. (1994) studied US stocks for the period
1968–90 and found that low price-earnings ratio stocks substantially outperformed high price-
earnings ratio stocks.They established that this was distinct from a size effect on returns.However
Fama and French (1992) found no price-earnings ratio effect that was distinguishable from the
effects of ﬁrm size and price-to-book ratios.As for UK studies, Levis (1989) found that shares of
low price-earnings ratio ﬁrms provided higher returns than shares of high price-earnings ratio
ﬁrms.Levis found that this effect was most pronounced amongst small ﬁrms.However UK studies
by Miles and Timmermann (1996) and by Strong and Xu (1997) did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant
relationships between low price-earnings ratios and returns.
Fama and French (1988) showed that the return on the aggregate stock market tended to be
higher when the dividend-price ratio, the dividend yield, is high.This might be interpreted as a
violation of the efﬁcient market hypothesis since a piece of public information,the dividend yield,
appears to be capable of being used to predict returns on the aggregate stock market. However
MARKET EFFICIENCY
516

the relationship between dividend yield and subsequent returns could be the result of changes in
the risk premium. A high risk premium results in low stock prices, and hence a high ratio of
dividends to price.The high risk premium entails a high expected (required) rate of return.The
ﬁnding,by Fama and French (1989),that the yield spread between high- and low-grade bonds has
predictive power for stock returns seems to support the risk premium interpretation. If this
interpretation is accepted, the dividend yield, whilst being useful for predicting market returns,
cannot be used to obtain returns in excess of a normal risk-adjusted rate.In the UK,Chan and Chui
(1996) found that high dividend yields were related to high returns over the 1973–90 period,
whereas Miles and Timmermann (1996) found no relationship over the 1979–91 period. Levis
(1989) found that high dividend yield and high return were related during the 1961–85 period.
Levis also found that risk, as measured by beta, had no effect on return. In the United States,
Naranjo et al. (1998) found that, even when adjusting for risk, returns increased with increasing
dividend yield during the 1963–94 period.
Owners’ equity is the excess of the assets of a ﬁrm over its liabilities.The price-to-book value
ratio is the stock price divided by owners’ equity.There is evidence that shares of ﬁrms with low
ratios tend to outperform those of ﬁrms with high ratios.Rosenberg et al. (1985) found that stocks
with low price-to-book ratios signiﬁcantly outperformed the average stock. Fama and French
(1992) found that two variables,ﬁrm size and the price-to-book ratio,between them captured the
cross-sectional variation in average stock returns during the period 1963–90. Furthermore, the
price-to-book ratio had a consistently stronger role. Roll (1995) also found that a low price-to-
book strategy was proﬁtable. Kothari et al. (1995) suggested that the price-to-book effect was
much reduced when survivor bias was controlled for (some ﬁrms with low price-to-book ratios
may have folded and been removed from the data set with the effect that their dampening effects
on returns did not appear in the data).Capaul et al. (1993) studied France,Germany,Switzerland,
the UK, and Japan for the 1981–92 period.They concluded that low price-to-book ratio shares
provided superior risk-adjusted performance to high price-to-book ratio shares. Miles and
Timmermann (1996), Chan and Chui (1996), and also Strong and Xu (1997) found such a price-
to-book effect for the UK. Loughran (1997) suggested that fund managers who follow a value
investing approach (low price-to-book) in the United States do not show outperformance. He
proposed that this is because the price-to-book effect does not exist for the largest ﬁrms,whereas
most fund managers invest primarily in large ﬁrms – after all the large ﬁrms constitute most of
the stock market (by market capitalisation).
Cohen et al. (2003) conﬁrmed the price-to-book effect.Kothari and Shanken (2002) found that
tilting portfolios towards low price-to-book stocks improved portfolio performance.The question
arises as to why such a well-known anomaly should persist.In principle anomalies,which present
opportunities for enhancement of proﬁt without additional risk,should be removed by arbitrage.
Arbitragers would be expected to buy low price-to-book shares and simultaneously short sell high
price-to-book shares. Pursuit of proﬁts by such a strategy should lower returns on low price-to-
book stocks by raising their prices.At the same time returns on high price-to-book stocks would
be raised because sales would reduce their prices.Ali et al. (2003) suggest that there are reasons
to expect that such arbitrage will not take place. One reason relates to timescale.The price-to-
book effect offers proﬁts over a three- to ﬁve-year time period whereas arbitragers have shorter
timescales.Notably Ali et al. found that the price-to-book effect declined as institutional ownership
increased. Institutional investors may have longer investment horizons than arbitragers, and may
MARKET ANOMALIES
517

seek to exploit the price-to-book effect by buying low price-to-book stocks (i.e.by value investing).
Their purchases of such value stocks would tend to raise share prices and thereby reduce the
relative returns.
Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) proposed a division of beta into ‘bad beta’ and ‘good beta’.
The beta of the capital asset pricing model measures the sensitivity of the returns on a stock to
changes in the returns on the stock market as a whole. From a discounted cash ﬂow perspective
(see Chapter 19 on dividend discount models,and Chapter 20 on company accounts and economic
value added) variations in the general level of share prices arise either from changes in expected
cash ﬂows or changes in the rates at which they are discounted. Likewise the prices of individual
stocks can change as a result of either of these factors.‘Bad beta’ measures the sensitivity of
individual stock prices to general market movements caused by shifts in expectations concerning
future cash ﬂows.‘Good beta’ measures share price sensitivity based on variations in discount
rates, or variations in market sentiment.
Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) found that the betas of value stocks (low price-to-book)
have a greater ‘bad beta’component,whereas growth stocks (high price-to-book) have the higher
‘good beta’.‘Bad beta’ earns a high risk premium since changes in expectations of cash ﬂow are
seen as being associated with permanent (long-term) losses.‘Good beta’earns a relatively low risk
premium since its ﬂuctuations are seen as temporary (short-term).‘Good beta’losses are reversed
when discount rates or sentiment reverse. From this perspective it is to be expected that value
stocks should earn a higher risk premium, and hence higher return, than growth stocks.
This division of beta into ‘bad beta’ and ‘good beta’ may also help to resolve some other
controversial issues.First,the risk premium that shares appear to have over bonds (their historical
excess returns over bonds) might be explained in terms of shares having both ‘bad beta’and ‘good
beta’ whereas bonds have only ‘good beta’. Second, the issue of time diversiﬁcation might be
addressed in terms of ‘good beta’. Since the discount rate and sentiment factors that cause ‘good
beta’ share price movements are temporary and reversible, market rises and falls resulting from
such forces could be expected to even out over time.In other words down-periods and up-periods
would diversify each other just as poor-performing and successful stocks diversify each other.
MISPRICING AS AN EXPLANATION OF ANOMALIES
Even if it is accepted that it is not possible to identify mispriced shares, or to make proﬁts from
identiﬁed mispricing, it may still be the case that many shares are mispriced. Since market
capitalisation is equal to the number of shares in issue multiplied by the share price, overpriced
shares will have excessively high capitalisations and underpriced shares will have disproportionately
low capitalisations.If mispricing is corrected over time,there should be relatively low subsequent
returns on overpriced shares and relatively high returns on underpriced shares. Correspondingly
(on average) the shares of large capitalisation ﬁrms would be expected to underperform relative
to the shares of low capitalisation ﬁrms.
Low price-earnings ratio shares are likely to be (on average) mispriced downwards since they
tend to be low price shares.Conversely high price-earnings ratio shares are likely to be overpriced.
So low price-earnings ratio shares may be expected to outperform high price-earnings ratio shares
as the mispricing is corrected.The capital gains from the initially underpriced shares would exceed
those of the overpriced shares.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
518

Similarly high dividend yield shares are likely to be underpriced (a high dividend yield is obtained
by dividing the dividend by a low share price) and low dividend yield shares overpriced. As
mispricing is corrected over time the high yield shares should outperform the low yield shares.
The size effect, the price-earnings ratio effect, and the dividend yield effect might be explicable
in terms of mispricing.
Conversely DeBondt and Thaler (1985) have argued that stocks that have performed poorly in
recent years are likely to be underpriced, whereas those with strong performance in the recent
past are prone to be overvalued. Underpriced shares would be relatively likely to fall into the
categories of small size, low price-earnings ratio, and high book-to-market ratio.The subsequent
high returns to small, low price-earnings, and high book-to-market ﬁrms might be explained in
terms of them being initially underpriced.The under- and overpricing could be explained in terms
of particular shares (or types of share) being subject to swings in fashion amongst investors. De
Bondt and Thaler provided empirical evidence in support of their proposition. Of note is their
ﬁnding that the extra returns available from investing in stocks that had recently performed poorly,
occurred mainly in January.Bremer and Sweeney (1991) found similar results in that stocks were
mean reverting.Loser portfolios (whose prices had performed poorly in the past) tend to become
winners whilst the winners in the past become losers.A trading strategy based on selling winner
portfolios (portfolios of stocks that have performed relatively well) and buying loser portfolios
could have earned proﬁts in excess of risk-adjusted expectations.
Lakonishok et al. (1994) argued that anomalies were evidence of market inefﬁciency.Speciﬁcally
they argued that anomalies were evidence of systematic errors in the forecasts of stock market
analysts.They presented evidence that analysts extrapolate recent past performance too far into
the future, and hence exaggerate the signiﬁcance of such past performance for the fair prices of
stocks.Their evidence suggests that professional analysts may be subject to the decision-making
biases identiﬁed by behavioural ﬁnance, such as representativeness. La Porta (1996) provided
support for these views by ﬁnding that analysts seem too pessimistic about ﬁrms with low growth
prospects and too optimistic about ﬁrms with high growth prospects.
ANOMALIES OR RISK PREMIUMS?
Some commentators take the view that the evidence relating to anomalies implies that the efﬁcient
market hypothesis should be rejected (e.g. Fortune 1991). Others take the view that rather than
the anomalies providing evidence against market efﬁciency they provide evidence of the inability
of the capital asset pricing model to adequately incorporate risk (e.g. Clare et al. 1997).Williams
(1994) posed the question as to whether a systematically higher return from certain stocks or at
certain times simply compensates for greater risk or less information or the need to make more
complex or more time-consuming decisions.
Fama and French (1993) argued that some of the anomalies could be explained in terms of risk
premiums.They developed a three-factor model in which risk was measured by the sensitivity of
a stock to (1) the returns on the market portfolio,(2) the relative returns from small versus large
ﬁrms, and (3) the relative returns from high versus low book-to-market ratio ﬁrms.They found
the model to be effective in explaining stock returns.Whilst size and book-to-market may not be
risk factors themselves,they could be proxies for more fundamental risk factors.Fama and French
concluded that some of the anomalies were not inconsistent with market efﬁciency when the
MARKET ANOMALIES
519

appropriate risk adjustment was made.Daniel and Titman (1995) found that the factors of size and
book-to-market themselves, not the betas on these factors, explained returns. In other words
Daniel and Titman concluded that high returns could not be explained as risk premiums.
CALENDAR EFFECTS
The January effect was demonstrated by Rozeff and Kinney (1976) who found that average stock
market returns in January tended to be much higher than in other months.Gultekin and Gultekin
(1983) studied stock markets in 15 different countries and discovered a January effect in all of them.
This implies that the January effect is not explicable in terms of the speciﬁc tax (or other
institutional) arrangements in a country. Keim (1983) found that about half of the size effect
occurred in January.In fact about a quarter of the size effect for the year was typically accomplished
during the ﬁrst ﬁve trading days in January.
Kato and Shallheim (1985) studied the Tokyo stock exchange and found excess returns for
January and a strong relationship between size and returns (small ﬁrms substantially outperforming
large ﬁrms).Fama (1991) reported results from the United States for the period 1941–81.Stocks
of small ﬁrms averaged returns of 8.06% in January, whereas the stocks of large ﬁrms averaged
January returns of 1.342% (in both cases the January returns exceeded the average return in the
other months).For the period 1982–91 the January returns were 5.32% and 3.2% for the stocks
of small and large ﬁrms respectively.
One possible explanation of the January effect is window dressing by fund managers.They are
often required to publish the details of the portfolios that they hold at the end of the year. It has
been suggested that they prefer to show large,well-known companies in their published portfolios.
So they sell small company shares and buy large company shares in December, and then do the
opposite in January.So the prices of small company shares rise in January.Although this may explain
the relative outperformance of smaller company shares in January,it does not explain the general
January effect (unless the window dressing entails a relative move to bonds and cash in December).
Cooper et al. (2006) discovered another January-related anomaly.They found that stock market
returns in January were predictive of returns during the next 11 months. Strong January returns
were indicative of strong returns during the rest of the year.The effect was referred to as the ‘other
January effect’.
Cross (1973), French (1980) and others have documented a weekend effect.They found that
the average returns to stocks were negative between the close of trading on Friday and the close
of trading on Monday. Gibbons and Hess (1983) examined a 17-year period between 1962 and
1978 and found that on average Monday returns were negative on an annualised basis (33.5%
p.a.).Keim and Stambaugh (1984) investigated the daily returns on the S&P 500 from 1928 to 1982
and found that,on average,Monday returns were negative.Kohers and Kohers (1995) also found
a weekend effect,suggesting that there would be an advantage from buying on Mondays and selling
on Fridays.
Calendar effects, such as the January effect and the weeekend effect, have been brought into
doubt by Sullivan et al. (1999).They claim to have shown that the calendar effects can be completely
explained by what they refer to as data snooping.They found that the same data that was used to
identify a calendar effect was also used to test for the existence of the effect.They also demonstrated
that, although the small number of calendar effects that have been reported are statistically
MARKET EFFICIENCY
520

signiﬁcant,there are about 9,500 conceivable calendar effects.From 9,500 some can be expected
to be statistically signiﬁcant through chance.
Malkiel (2003) concluded that anomalies do not persist in the long run since they lose their
predictive power when they are discovered.As an example he stated that as soon as evidence of
the January effect was made public investors acted on the information and the effect disappeared.
Gu (2003, 2004) provided evidence consistent with Malkiel’s view by showing a decline in the
January effect and a reversal of the weekend effect.
Some calendar anomalies may persist since it is difﬁcult for arbitragers, and other traders, to
make proﬁts from them.One could be ‘Sell in May and go away’.This is an old stock market adage,
which was researched by Keppler and Xue (2003).They studied the 18 most developed national
stock markets over the period 1970 to 2001. It was found that during the months November to
April the average rate of stock price rise was 8.36%.The average rate of price rise during the
months May to October was 0.37%. Not only were returns higher between November and
April,but also risk was lower.Keppler and Xue suggested a number of explanations including the
observation that bonuses tend to be paid around the end, or the beginning, of the year. Research
on saving behaviour has found that people ﬁnd it easier to save and invest from a lump sum than
from regular earnings. Investment of such lump sums would tend to increase demand for stocks,
and hence their prices, during the period in which the bonuses are invested.
OTHER ANOMALIES
The efﬁcient market hypothesis implies that publicly available information in the form of analyses
published by investment advisory ﬁrms should not provide means of obtaining rates of return
in excess of what would normally be expected on the basis of the risk of the investments.However
stock rankings provided by The Value Line Investment Survey appear to provide information that
could be used to enhance investors’ returns (Huberman and Kandel 1990). However there is
evidence that the market adjusts to this information within two trading days (Stickel 1985).
Similarly Antunovich and Laster (2003) and Anderson and Smith (2006) found that companies
identiﬁed by Fortune magazine as the most admired subsequently performed better than a
stock index (the S&P 500).The Antunovich and Laster study indicated that stock price reaction to
the information is subject to drift in that it takes a signiﬁcant amount of time to occur hence
permitting investors to proﬁt from the information. Conversely Shefrin and Statman (1997)
obtained the opposite result when analysing annual surveys of ﬁrm reputation published by Fortune
magazine.They found that,on average,the shares of ﬁrms with good reputations turned out to be
relatively poor investments whereas the shares of companies with poor reputations subsequently
performed well.
A positive relationship between the reputations of companies,as measured in a publicly available
source, and returns on the shares of those companies contradicts the efﬁcient market hypothesis
since it implies that published information could be used to enhance investment returns.However
it also contradicts some of the theories that have been used to criticise the efﬁcient market
hypothesis. One of the psychological biases proposed by behavioural ﬁnance theorists is the
representativeness bias. Investors may assume that the shares of a good company are a good
investment.The shares of ﬁrms with good reputations might be heavily bought such that their
prices reach excessive levels.In consequence the subsequent returns on those shares would be low.
MARKET ANOMALIES
521

This behavioural prediction is contradicted by the results of the Antunovich/Laster (2003) and
Anderson/Smith (2006) studies.
Agency problems could also cause the stock prices of ﬁrms with good reputations to reach
excessive levels.Agency problems arise when people acting on behalf of investors behave in their
own interests rather than in the interests of the investors.For example a fund manager (the agent)
may operate in a self-interested way.One manifestation could be the investment of clients’money
in the shares of companies with good reputations.This protects the fund manager from criticism
in the event of poor investment performance since the fund manager could point to the reputations
of the companies as a justiﬁcation for the investments.To the extent that this increases the demand
for the stocks of well-regarded ﬁrms, the prices of those stocks could rise above fair values.The
result would be subsequent poor returns.The Antunovich/Laster (2003) and Anderson/Smith
(2006) ﬁndings provide evidence against such predictions.
Another apparent anomaly is the deviation between the prices of investment trust shares and
the net asset values.It is not clear why a portfolio of shares within an investment trust should have
a different price to the same portfolio outside the investment trust.A suggested explanation is that
the differences arise from the relationship between fund charges and the perceived quality of
investment management. If the potential contribution of fund managers to returns is seen as less
than the charges, there would be a discount to net asset value. In terms of dividend discount
models,in the absence of any expected enhancement to returns from fund management,the future
management charges are a deduction from future dividend receipts and the present value of the
expected future net receipts is correspondingly reduced.
Lee et al. (1991) suggest that the existence of investment trusts (closed-end funds) is an anomaly
because rational investors would not be expected to buy new issues.The tendency for investment
trusts to fall to a discount subsequent to issue appears to offer an early loss. Rational investors
should not make an investment that is expected to result in an almost immediate loss.
An anomaly that is consistent with the belief that markets in the shares of large ﬁrms are more
likely to be efﬁcient than the markets for small company shares is the neglected ﬁrm effect.Neglect
means that few analysts follow the stock,or that few institutional investors hold it.So fewer market
participants put new information into the market. Neglected stocks are more likely to be
mispriced,and hence are more prone to offer proﬁt opportunities.Arbel and Strebel (1983) found
that an investment strategy based on changes in the level of attention devoted by security analysts
to different stocks could lead to positive excess returns.Allen (2005) observed that,in aggregate,
institutional investment funds specialising in small capitalisation companies in the United States
outperformed the Russell 2000 (a stock index for small companies) whereas the institutions
underperformed stock indices when managing funds of large capitalisation stocks.Allen suggested
that the outperformance in the small capitalisation sector was partly due to an ‘instant history bias’
wherein performance ﬁgures are not reported unless there is a history of good performance prior
to records being reported for the ﬁrst time.However the view was taken that the outperformance
was primarily because small company stocks were often neglected and that the resulting mispricing
offered fund managers proﬁtable opportunities.
Merton (1987) showed that neglected ﬁrms might be expected to earn high returns as
compensation for the risk associated with limited information.The information deﬁciency resulting
from the limited amount of analysis renders neglected ﬁrms riskier as investments.The relative
absence of investment analysis makes it less likely that all relevant information is reﬂected in the
MARKET EFFICIENCY
522

share price.There is greater likelihood that the share is mispriced,and the mispricing could entail
the share being overpriced. Investors may require compensation for the risk that the share is
purchased at an overvalued price.This view sees the neglected ﬁrm premium as a form of risk
premium rather than as a contradiction of the efﬁcient market hypothesis. Investors require the
higher returns as compensation for the additional risk, and the higher required rates of return
entail lower prices.On a risk-adjusted basis neglected ﬁrms do not provide returns above a normal
level.
Doukas et al. (2005) observed that not only were the stocks of neglected ﬁrms likely to trade
at relatively low prices but also the shares of ﬁrms receiving excessive attention from analysts may
trade at abnormally high prices. It was suggested that when an investment bank anticipates
investment-banking business with a company, the coverage of that company by the bank’s
investment analysts increases. If it were accepted that investment analysts tend to be overly
optimistic about the stocks of ﬁrms which are prospective clients of their banks, the result of
increased attention from analysts could be rises in the prices of such stocks. If a number of
investment banks seek business with a ﬁrm, the result could be excessive attention from analysts
and a resultant overpricing of its shares.
Related to the small ﬁrm and neglected ﬁrm effects is the effect of liquidity on returns.Amihud
and Mendelson (1991) argued that investors demand a premium to invest in illiquid stocks that
entail high transaction costs.They found that such stocks did provide relatively high rates of return.
Since the shares of small and neglected ﬁrms tend to be relatively illiquid,the liquidity effect may
constitute part of the explanation of their high returns. However the lack of liquidity, and high
transaction costs, may remove the potential to proﬁt from the liquidity effect on stock returns.
The semi-strong form of the efﬁcient market hypothesis has been brought into doubt by
econometric studies which suggest that it is possible to forecast stock market movements to some
extent. Pesaran and Timmermann (1994) looked at excess returns on the S&P 500 and the Dow
Jones measured over one year, one quarter, and one month for the period 1954–71. For annual
excess returns a small set of variables including dividend yield,inﬂation,interest rate changes,and
the term premium explain about 60% of the variation in excess returns.For quarterly and monthly
data, similar variables explain about 18% and 10% of excess returns respectively.
A number of studies have found that combinations of accounting ratios can be used to select
shares that outperform.These studies include those of Ou and Penman (1989),Setiono and Strong
(1998),Lev and Thiagarajan (1993),Abarbanell and Bushee (1997,1998),and Al-Debie and Walker
(1999).These studies have looked for combinations of accounting ratios (sometimes combined with
macroeconomic variables) which appear to provide useful information for forecasting returns on
shares.Whilst they were successful in ﬁnding such combinations they could be criticised for data
mining, particularly since there seems to be no economic or accounting theory underlying the
choices of ratios. (The data mining critique is based on the view that, since there is an inﬁnite
number of combinations of ratios and variables, the law of probabilities suggests that some
combinations will be successful purely by chance. It is necessary to test an observed relationship
on sets of data that are independent of the data set used to hypothesise the relationship. Such
independent veriﬁcation would indicate that there is a causal relationship rather than a statistical
aberration.)
Some of the anomalies that apply to stocks within countries also seem to apply to national stock
markets.Selecting countries for overseas investment on the basis of the anomalies appears to have
MARKET ANOMALIES
523

potential. Asness et al. (1997) noted that within the United States the relative performance of
stocks was positively related to high book-to-market ratios, small size, and high past year returns
(momentum).For a 20-year period ending in 1994 they found that countries satisfying those three
characteristics outperformed countries that did not. Richards (1997) investigated 16 national
markets over the period 1970–95 and found that the type of winner–loser reversals found for US
stocks also applied to countries. In particular he found that for periods up to a year relatively
strong performance persisted (momentum) whereas over longer periods past relative
outperformers (winners) became underperformers (losers) and vice versa (reversal). Emanuelli
and Pearson (1994) studied 24 national markets and separated them on the basis of relative earnings
revisions.They found that a portfolio of stocks from the countries with the greatest relative
experience of positive earnings revisions outperformed an average of the 24 countries.A portfolio
from the countries with the lowest positive (highest negative) earnings revisions underperformed.
A recently identiﬁed anomaly is the apparent failure of share prices to fully reﬂect underfunding
of a company’s pension scheme (Franzoni and Marin 2006).In an efﬁcient market the valuation of
the shares of a company should take account of the future costs arising from the need to remedy
pension scheme underfunding. It appears that the market overvalues companies with severely
underfunded pension plans.
THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND PROBLEMS 
WITH TESTING THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS
Tests of the efﬁcient market hypothesis tend to compare experienced returns with expected
returns.The expected returns are typically based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).The
security market line, shown by equation 1, summarises the CAPM.
E(Ri)  rf   [ E(Rm)  rf ]
(1)
E(Ri) is the expected return on security i, rf is the risk-free rate of return (normally proxied
by the Treasury bill rate),  is the beta of the security, and E(Rm) is the expected return on the
market portfolio (normally proxied by a stock index). Informational efﬁciency is tested by
ascertaining whether E(Ri) can be consistently bettered.If it can then excess returns can be made
and the market is not informationally efﬁcient.
Such tests are dependent upon the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) providing a reliable
estimate of the expected (required) return on the share. However the usefulness of the security
market line in providing such a benchmark has been questioned. For example Fama and French
(1992) found that long-term equity returns do not depend on beta. Roll (1977) has argued that
the market portfolio should contain every available asset, and that it is impossible to measure the
expected return on such a broadly based portfolio. Fama (1998) suggested that even small errors
in choosing a benchmark against which to compare returns could accumulate large apparent
anomalies over the long-term. Many of the results in studies of anomalies are sensitive to small
benchmarking errors. If these lines of reasoning are correct, many of the tests of the efﬁcient
market hypothesis may be seen as invalid.
MARKET EFFICIENCY

DATA MINING
Some studies,particularly studies of market anomalies,may be guilty of data mining.There are an
inﬁnite number of possible relationships between variables. For example UK stock market
performance could be related to interest rate changes, corporate proﬁtability, goals scored by
Arsenal,migrations of African wildebeest – the list is endless.The ﬁrst two in the list can be justiﬁed
by ﬁnance theory,the others cannot.Any relationship between the latter two variables and UK stock
market behaviour would be spurious since they are irrelevant variables. However if a researcher
investigated UK stock market performance against every irrelevant variable some would show a
relationship, purely by chance. Such a research procedure is called data mining. Relationships
produced by such an approach should be treated with scepticism.
Errors of data mining should be revealed if a relationship is tested against out-of-sample data.
Out-of-sample data is data that is different from the original set, from which the relationship was
deduced. Out-of-sample data might be from a different time period or a different country. If the
only testing is carried out on the same data that was used to deduce the relationship, there must
be doubt about the adequacy of the tests.
The available empirical evidence on market efﬁciency is predominantly the evidence reported
in academic journals.There is a bias from this source of information.There is a tendency for the
journals only to publish statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings; indeed researchers may decide to submit
only research ﬁndings that are statistically signiﬁcant (on the grounds that they are the only papers
likely to be published). All the research that ﬁnds no statistically signiﬁcant relationships is
consequently ignored. If it is the case that investigations of techniques of analysis tend to be
statistically signiﬁcant when they refute the efﬁcient market hypothesis,and fail statistical signiﬁcance
when they support it, the literature has a bias against supporting the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
SURVIVOR(SHIP) BIAS
Survivor bias is concerned with the possibility of dropouts from data sets. For example when
examining a group of shares, or set of companies, it is important to ensure that the ﬁnal group is
identical to the initial group.Some published data sources remove some members of the group.If
a company closes down and its shares become valueless, that company and its shares might be
removed from published data.The set of companies or shares at the end of the period being studied
would be different from the group at the beginning.The worst performers are removed from the
data. Use of the published data in research studies imparts an upward bias. Removal of the worst
performers improves the observed average.The performance of the group appears to be better
than it really is.This may explain size and value effects.Small ﬁrms are more likely than large ﬁrms
to cease trading and disappear from the reported data.If failed ﬁrms could be added back into the
data sets, the relatively strong performance of small ﬁrms might disappear. Likewise ﬁrms with
low share prices relative to fundamentals such as earnings,dividends,and book value may have low
share prices because they are experiencing problems.Such ﬁrms are relatively likely to fail.If those
that fail are removed from the sample under study,the reported average return is biased upwards
(Kothari et al. 1995).
MARKET ANOMALIES
525

TESTING IMPOSSIBLE STRATEGIES
There is a possibility that prospective trades investigated by researchers would be impossible in
practice.One possible source of error in research arises from non-synchronous trading.Published
security (shares, bonds) price data is based on the last trade. In the case of the shares of large
companies,or large government bond issues,the last trade is likely to have been only minutes ago.
In the case of small company shares,or illiquid corporate bonds,the last trade may have been days
ago. In the latter case the published prices are out of date and may be a poor guide to the price at
which an investor could actually buy or sell in the present. Studies that use published price data
could therefore be using irrelevant prices.
Another possible source of distortion is sometimes called ‘look-ahead bias’.A researcher,using
historical information, may ﬁnd a relationship between two variables. For example a relationship
might be found between money supply growth in a month and stock market performance in the
same month. However money supply ﬁgures for a month are not published until a later month.
Both the practical usefulness and some possible explanations of the relationship could be
compromised by this bias. It must be remembered that markets can only be efﬁcient with respect
to knowable information.
Many studies of the efﬁcient market hypothesis have assumed short selling.Short selling entails
borrowing securities and then selling them;so the trader may owe shares without holding shares –
a short position. In particular many studies have been based on hedged positions; the purchase of
shares is ﬁnanced by short selling other shares. However in many countries (including the UK)
most investors are not allowed to short sell. Even where short selling is possible, not all of the
money raised can be used for share purchase.A study may ﬁnd that an investment strategy based
on short selling (and perhaps investing all the proceeds) is proﬁtable, and may conclude that the
availability of such proﬁt opportunities refutes market efﬁciency.However if the proﬁt opportunities
cannot practically be exploited, they cannot be regarded as refuting market efﬁciency.
CONCLUSION
Contradictions of the efﬁcient market hypothesis tend to be called anomalies.Some people regard
behavioural ﬁnance as an anomaly, or group of anomalies.Apart from behavioural ﬁnance there
are apparent contradictions of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
Two well-researched anomalies are the size effect and the value effect.The size effect is based
on observations that the shares of small ﬁrms tend to outperform those of large ﬁrms.The value
effect is based on the observation that shares with low price-earnings, or low price-book, ratios
tend to outperform those with high ratios.Tests of the efﬁcient market hypothesis have been
complicated by the fact that they are simultaneously tests of the capital asset pricing model.The
size and value effects may indicate deﬁciencies of the capital asset pricing model rather than
deﬁciencies of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.In particular adding size and value as additional risk
MARKET EFFICIENCY
526

factors in the capital asset pricing model could remove these anomalies.The additional return
from small and low ratio shares could be compensation for risk associated with these characteristics.
The size and value effects could also result from mispricing of shares.If shares were frequently
mispriced, underpriced shares would be the more likely to exhibit low market capitalisations
(small size), low price-earnings ratios, and low price-book ratios. However if it is not possible to
identify the underpriced shares, it is not possible to make abnormal proﬁts from them.
There are other apparent anomalies such as calendar effects, the neglected ﬁrm effect, and
techniques that appear to produce abnormal proﬁts. It has been suggested that there are dangers
of data mining and data snooping. Since there is a vast amount of data available to researchers, it
is not surprising that some of the data appears to be inconsistent with market efﬁciency purely by
chance. If researchers look long enough (mine deep enough) they will ﬁnd apparent anomalies.
Rather than testing theory with the data,researchers may look at the data (snoop on it) to see which
theories might be supported before embarking on the tests. Since research appearing to support
an anomaly is more likely to be published than research that ﬁnds no relationships (and since
promotion in academia rests upon publication),mining and snooping probably have assured futures.
For academics they are pursuits that appear to offer abnormal proﬁts.
If anomalies exist, and if they were means to attain abnormal proﬁts, professional investors
(who are presumably aware of the anomalies) should be able to outperform stock indices.
Chapters 9, 11, 17, and 26 on mutual funds, pensions, the evaluation of fund managers, and the
strong form of the efﬁcient market hypothesis, respectively, present evidence that market
professionals (institutional investors) do not on average outperform stock indices.This suggests
that even if the efﬁcient market hypothesis, in the sense that security prices reﬂect all relevant
information, fails it remains possible that the efﬁcient market hypothesis, in the sense that there
are no opportunities to make abnormal proﬁts from publicly available information,may nonetheless
be reliable.

Chapter 26
Further evidence on
market efﬁciency
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Evidence relating to the semi-strong form of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
2. Evidence relating to the strong form of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
3. The adaptive and fractal market hypotheses.
A purpose of using investment analysis to estimate the fair prices of shares is to assist in investment
decisions. If the market price of a share is below its fair price, it is cheap and therefore a
potential buy.If the fair price is below the market price,the share is overpriced and should not be
bought.
The efﬁcient market hypothesis suggests that such investment analysis is futile.This is because
either (1) share prices already reﬂect all relevant known information with the effect that they are
already at their fair prices, or (2) it is not possible to make proﬁts from any mispricing.
A semi-strong form efﬁcient market is one in which security prices take account of all publicly
available information. In addition to market information on past prices and trading volumes,
publicly available information includes macroeconomic data (such as interest rates and inﬂation
rates),company data (such as proﬁts,sales,quality of management and workforce,balance sheets),
and non-economic events (such as political events, technological developments, and discoveries
of natural resources).The implication is that asset prices immediately move to reﬂect any new
information or that no one can make proﬁts by means of purchases or sales based on analysing the
new information.
EVIDENCE SUPPORTING SEMI-STRONG FORM EFFICIENCY
The evidence indicating the existence of anomalies is evidence against the semi-strong form of the
efﬁcient market hypothesis.Much of the evidence supporting the semi-strong form of the efﬁcient
market hypothesis comes from event studies.These studies aim to establish whether it is possible

to make proﬁts from a publicly available item of news, particularly ﬁnancial news relating to a
speciﬁc company. If stock prices adjust very quickly to news, the market is efﬁcient and there is
no scope for trading proﬁts following the news.If stock prices adjust slowly there is an opportunity
for ascertaining, and trading upon, the direction of price change. Slow price changes indicate
market inefﬁciency.
Ball and Brown (1968) investigated the usefulness of earnings published in company accounts
from the point of view of making trading proﬁts.Their sample of companies was divided into two
groups,one with earnings that exceeded expectations and the other with disappointing earnings.
In both cases most of the share price adjustment occurred during the 12 months leading up to the
earnings announcement as information became gradually available through interim reports,
brokers’analyses,and newspaper articles.The information not previously known was found to be
incorporated into the share price almost immediately after the earnings announcement.
Excess returns on stocks,which are subject to revisions in the consensus of analysts’estimates
of earnings, have been found to be available for up to 12 months.The market appears not to
immediately react to changes in the consensus forecast. Furthermore studies have shown that
revisions in the consensus of analysts’ estimates of earnings tend to have momentum; that is an
increase in the consensus forecast one month is often followed by another increase in the next
month (Givoly and Lakonishok 1979).
Fama et al. (1969) investigated the potential for making proﬁts from news about stock splits
(for example replacing one old share with two new shares).A stock split adds nothing to the value
of a company,and should have no effect on the total value of shares outstanding.However the split
might convey information about future cash ﬂows.The study hypothesised that announcements of
forthcoming stock splits generated expectations of higher future dividends. After the split the
ﬁrms that raised dividends experienced stock price rises whereas those that failed to meet the
expectation of higher dividends underwent share price falls.The interpretation was that stock
prices adjusted to the expectation of higher dividends very quickly after the announcements of the
stock splits, and the price rise was subsequently added to or removed dependent upon whether
the dividend expectations were realised.
Takeover and merger announcements can raise stock prices substantially, especially where
premiums are being paid to the shareholders of an acquired ﬁrm.Dodd (1980) found no evidence
of abnormal price changes subsequent to the immediate reaction.Firth (1975) studied the effects
of a ﬁrm having 10% of its shares bought by a single entity (which may be seen as an indicator of
a pending takeover bid) and found that most of the increase in share value occurred between the
last trade before the announcement and the next trade.Only those with inside information (prior
knowledge) could earn excess returns net of transaction costs.
Sunder (1973) investigated the effects on the stock market values of ﬁrms arising from a change
to LIFO (last in ﬁrst out) stock valuation.The beneﬁt from the reduced tax liability showed up in
higher share prices prior to (due to the change being anticipated) or immediately after the
announcement of the change.Once the information about the change was public there was no scope
for making trading proﬁts from knowledge of the change. It also seems likely that the stock price
rises resulted from the changes in the net of tax cash ﬂows rather than the accounting changes as
such. Research on the effects of alterations to accounting practices such as the treatment of
depreciation has indicated that share prices do not react to changes that have no impact on expected
net of tax cash ﬂows (Kaplan and Roll 1972).The reaction of the market to dividend announcements
FURTHER EVIDENCE ON MARKET EFFICIENCY
529

has also been investigated. Pettit (1972) found that the information content of dividend
announcements was immediately reﬂected in share prices.
Initial public offerings of shares are often made at prices below fair value in order to ensure that
the offering is fully subscribed.This tends to provide the initial buyers with a capital gain.The proﬁts
appear to be limited to those investors who are allocated shares in the initial sale. Purchases in the
secondary market,soon after issue,do not provide proﬁts.It seems that prices reach their fair values
very quickly.All relevant information is quickly incorporated into prices (Ibbotson et al. 1988,
1994). Results from Miller and Reilly (1987), Chalk and Peavy (1987), and Hanley (1993) show
that the price adjustment takes place within one day of the offering.Research into the effects of sales
of large blocks of shares in the secondary market has found that any resulting price change is
corrected within a day so that after the day of the sale there is no scope for making proﬁts from
knowledge of the disposal (Kraus and Stoll 1972).
A study of announcements relating to economic news (such as news concerning money supply,
inﬂation, and interest rates) found no resulting trend in stock prices beyond the day of the
announcement (Pearce and Roley 1985). One study has even found that stock price reactions to
economic news are completed within an hour (Jain 1988).
EVIDENCE RELATING TO THE STRONG FORM
OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS
According to the strong form of the EMH even non-public information is quickly reﬂected in asset
prices; so the small number of investors who have that information are unable to proﬁt from it.
Non-public information can be divided into two categories.There is the information held by
corporate insiders on matters such as forthcoming earnings announcements,or takeover bids.The
other arises from stock analyses that have not been made public (arguably this should include only
analyses that use research methods that are not public,since publicly known techniques of security
analysis could be regarded as publicly available information).If actively managed mutual funds are
able consistently to outperform the market, that outperformance provides evidence that their
private analyses can be used proﬁtably.If the recommendations of investment analysts can be used
to earn proﬁts (in excess of normal or average returns), there is evidence against the efﬁcient
market hypothesis.Either the semi-strong or strong form of the hypothesis is challenged according
to whether the analyst recommendations are made public or kept private.
The Trades of Insiders
Corporate insiders include directors and senior executives of the company. Insiders have access
to privileged information and could use the information to proﬁt from trading in securities markets
before the information becomes public. Several studies of corporate insiders found that they
consistently obtained abnormally high rates of return on their stock transactions (Jaffe 1974;
Finnerty 1976, 1976a; Nunn et al. 1983; Nejat and Seyhun 1986).A later study by Peers (1992)
conﬁrmed these results but indicated that the opportunities for trading proﬁts were limited to the
most senior insiders.A UK study by Gregory et al. (1994) suggested that insider purchases were
proﬁtable but that there was no evidence of beneﬁts from insider sales.Kiymaz (2002),in a study
of the Turkish stock market, found that abnormal returns were available in the days preceding
MARKET EFFICIENCY
530

publication of price-sensitive information. The share price movements prior to publication
suggested that insiders were trading proﬁtably during the period preceding publication.
Niederhoffer and Osborne (1966) found that specialists on the New York Stock Exchange, who
have privileged knowledge of advance buy and sell orders (limit orders), can consistently obtain
abnormally high rates of return.
A related issue concerns the potential for earning enhanced returns by following the trading
behaviour of insiders. Studies by Lee and Solt (1986), Rozeff and Zaman (1988), Seyhun (1988,
1992),and Chowdhury et al. (1993) showed that it was not possible to earn excess returns in this
way. Pope et al. (1990) estimated returns from following directors’ trades, as reported by the
London Stock Exchange, during the period 1977–84. Generally they found little evidence for
beneﬁts from following purchases but more evidence for the advantages of following sales.
The enormous illegal proﬁts made by insider traders such as Ivan Boesky are suggestive that the
market is not strong form efﬁcient. Since a strong form efﬁcient market is one in which proﬁts
could not be made on the basis of privileged information, prosecutions of insider traders who
have made fortunes from using inside knowledge are evidence against strong form efﬁciency.
Using Non-Public Analysis: Mutual Fund Performance
There have been a number of studies of the ability to proﬁt from non-public security analyses.
Friend et al. (1962) studied the performance of US mutual funds (unit trusts) and found that, on
average,they did not outperform stock indices.Jensen (1968) concluded that mutual funds earned,
on average,about 1% p.a.less than would be expected on the basis of their betas (systematic risk).
In aggregate they were not able to predict stock price movements well enough to outperform a
buy-and-hold strategy. Also past performance of funds could not be used to predict future
performance,suggesting that not even star fund managers possessed knowledge or expertise that
would enable them to consistently outperform the market.Firth (1978) studied the performance
of UK unit trusts.He found that,on a risk-adjusted basis,their performance tended to match that
of the market as a whole.Also the past performance of individual trusts gave no guide to future
performance. Cowles (1933) failed to ﬁnd any evidence that professional investors achieved a
performance that was superior to the results of a market tracking strategy.A study undertaken by
Malkiel (1988) showed that during the 20 years to 1987,over 70% of pension fund managers were
outperformed by the S&P 500 index.
Sharpe (1966) found that US mutual funds failed to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Ippolito (1989) concluded that US mutual funds outperformed the market, but not by
enough to offset charges.Elton et al. (1993) concluded that mutual funds underperform the market
and that funds with high fees and turnover do worse than those with low fees and turnover.Malkiel
(1995) found that mutual funds underperform the market even before fund charges are considered.
Daniel et al. (1997) and Wermers (2000) found that there was outperformance before fund charges
were considered, but not net of fund charges. Blake et al. (1993) found that US bond funds
underperformed bond indices and that the degree of underperformance was directly related to
the fund charges.The majority of the evidence on the performance of professional fund managers
is that returns, net of costs, are at best average.
Malkiel (1995) and Elton et al. (1996) suggest that many studies of market efﬁciency have
overstated the true performance of mutual funds because of survivorship bias.Most data sets used
FURTHER EVIDENCE ON MARKET EFFICIENCY
531

have included records of all existing mutual funds. Mutual funds that were taken off the market
due to poor performance (or were merged with other funds in order to bury their poor records)
do not appear among the existing funds.The removal of such weak funds artiﬁcially boosts the
apparent success of funds as a whole.
Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) and Cornell and Roll (1981) suggested that market equilibrium
should provide some incentive for analysis.Those who acquire and process information should
receive superior gross returns,but only average returns net of costs (which include the costs of the
analysis).If no analysts were operating,the market would be inefﬁcient and large proﬁts would be
available for the ﬁrst analysts.As more analysts,attracted by the proﬁts,enter the market efﬁciency
improves and proﬁts fall.Eventually the number of analysts expands to the point where the market
efﬁciency is such that returns from analysis merely match the costs of analysis.At that point no
more analysts enter the market.Equilibrium would have been reached where returns from analysis
equal the costs of analysis so that there is no further incentive for new analysts to enter the market.
If some fund managers possessed investment management skills that enabled them to
consistently outperform the market, it would be expected that those fund managers should
persistently outperform the fund managers who lack the requisite skills. Hendricks et al. (1993)
found the strongest consistency to be among the weakest performers. Carhart (1997) found that
there was some persistence of relative performance across fund managers, but that it was largely
due to charges and costs rather than investment returns.There was consistent inferior performance
resulting from high management charges and high trading costs (as would result from high portfolio
turnover).This is consistent with the efﬁcient market hypothesis since persistence in relative
performance resulting from differing management charges and trading costs does not imply any
ability to outperform the market.The apparent absence of relative outperformance arising from
investment management skills is consistent with the efﬁcient market hypothesis, which predicts
an absence of proﬁts from stock selection and market timing.
Rhodes (2000) in producing a report for the UK Financial Services Authority based on both a
review of existing literature and original research concluded that:
The literature on the performance of UK funds has failed to ﬁnd evidence that information
on past investment performance can be used to good effect by retail investors in choosing
funds.The general pattern is one in which investment performance does not persist.
Small groups of funds may show some repeat performance over a short period of time,
particularly poorly performing funds. However the size of this effect and the fact that it
is only very short lived means that there is no investment strategy for retail investors that
could usefully be employed.The results from the US literature are similar.
The results concurred with the earlier analyses in ﬁnding that there was no persistency
in the performance of managed funds after 1987. There was evidence of repeat
performance before this point but it would be misleading to suggest that retail investors
could use this ﬁnding in the present day.
The weight of evidence is that information on past performance cannot be exploited
usefully by retail investors.
Against all this evidence is the observation that a few individuals seem to have track records of
persistently good investment performance. Such names include Warren Buffet, George Soros,
MARKET EFFICIENCY
532

Peter Lynch, John Templeton, John Neff,Anthony Bolton, and Neil Woodford.They present an
unresolved anomaly from the perspective of the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
Gregory and Tonks (2006) found some persistency in relative performance amongst pension
schemes in the UK. They estimated risk-adjusted performances where the risk-adjustment
was based on the single-factor capital asset pricing model and on forms of the Fama–French
multi-factor variations of the model.They investigated the subsequent relative performance of
the top quintile, from a period, against the bottom quintile from the same period. The top
quintile tended to outperform during the following period. The effect was strongest when
comparing successive six-month periods and successive 12-month periods (the relative
outperformance being in the range 1.6% to 1.9% p.a.).The relative outperformance was lower
for three-year periods (0.2% to 0.8% p.a.), and tended to be negative for one-month and three-
month periods.
Implications for Rational Retail Investors
One issue facing retail investors who are looking to buy an institutional investment such as a mutual
fund is whether to invest in an actively managed fund or in an index tracker fund. If markets
were efﬁcient the answer would appear to be unambiguous; actively managed funds cannot be
expected to consistently outperform the market and so it is pointless to pay their management fees.
If markets were efﬁcient, individual investors should invest in low cost index tracker funds.
However the evidence from behavioural ﬁnance and studies of market anomalies throw doubt
on the efﬁcient market hypothesis. If markets are not informationally efﬁcient, should investors
choose to invest in actively managed funds on the grounds that it is possible to outperform
the market?
Malkiel (2003a) argued that even if market efﬁciency is not accepted, retail investors
should still choose index tracker funds. One point is that investment outperformance and
underperformance is a zero-sum game. If some investment managers outperform the market,
others must underperform the market.Obviously,in aggregate,the market performs in line with
the market.Index tracker funds perform in line with the market.The aggregate market minus index
tracker funds must therefore perform in line with the market. Actively managed funds are the
aggregate market minus index trackers.So actively managed portfolios,in aggregate,must perform
in line with the market. If some actively managed portfolios outperform others must
underperform.This suggests that, on average, actively managed funds perform in line with the
market before their costs are considered.When costs are taken into account actively managed
funds, on average, could be expected to underperform the market.The conclusion seems to be
that individual investors should invest in index tracker funds rather than waste money on
management fees whilst taking the risk that their particular managers are relatively poor
performers. However the existence of noise traders may allow professional fund managers, in
aggregate,to outperform at the expense of those noise traders (assuming that the professionals are
not noise traders themselves).
Evidence from empirical research cited in this chapter (and in Chapters 9 and 17 on mutual
funds and on evaluating the performance of fund managers, respectively) tends to conﬁrm the
expectation that actively managed funds, on average, underperform stock markets after costs are
considered. However questions still remain since some funds do outperform the market. Is such
FURTHER EVIDENCE ON MARKET EFFICIENCY
533

outperformance due purely to chance, since chance would generate outperformers as well as
underperformers,or is investment management skill involved? If skill were involved,it would be
expected that there would be some persistence in relative performance;in particular more funds
would show continued outperformance than would be expected on the basis of chance.
The evidence referred to in this text tends to indicate that there is probably no statistically signiﬁcant
persistence in performance,and if there is any such persistence it is limited to a very small number
of investment managers. If relative performance of actively managed funds arises from chance
rather than skill, the implication remains that retail investors should choose index tracker
funds. (Malkiel provides additional evidence in support of the ﬁndings that funds, on
average, underperform after costs and that there appears to be no persistence of relative
performance.)
If any persistence in outperformance were the result of investment management skill,one more
condition should be met before individual investors choose actively managed funds.There should
be means of ascertaining which investment managers demonstrate the skill that leads to persistent
outperformance. Furthermore the techniques for ascertaining which managers have skill should
be reasonably easy to use, and should give reasonably precise and unambiguous results (it is of
little use to an individual investor if the technique merely changes a 50:50 chance of correctly
choosing to a 55:45 chance of correctly choosing).There is also the risk that if everyone identiﬁes
the outperformers,so much money would be switched to the outperformers that they are unable
to continue the outperformance.The balance of evidence appears to be that it is probably not
possible to forecast relative performance, and that if accurate forecasts are possible they are not
sufﬁciently reliable for retail investors.
For it to be rational for retail investors to choose actively managed funds a number of conditions
must be met, as indicated above, and those conditions do not appear to be met. It is not sufﬁcient
for markets to be informationally inefﬁcient in the sense that stock prices fail to accurately reﬂect
all relevant information. It must also be the case that markets are informationally inefﬁcient in
the sense that it is possible to consistently make proﬁts from inefﬁciencies. Furthermore retail
investors should be able to readily identify the fund managers capable of consistently making
such proﬁts.
Is it possible to conclude that investors in actively managed funds are irrational and that investors
in index tracker funds are rational? Not necessarily. For example a rational investor might
prefer an index tracker but also require a high dividend yield.In the absence of a low cost tracker
fund based on an index of high income shares, the investor may choose a high income actively
managed fund.Outside the United States the markets for retail investments tend to be incomplete
in that they do not cater for all needs (whilst providing a plethora of choice for some types
of fund).
Nor can it be concluded that investors in index tracker funds are all,or even typically,rational.
Elton et al. (2004) found that a high proportion of investors in index tracker funds chose funds
whose charges were similar to those of actively managed funds. In the UK annual management
charges on index tracker funds range between 0.1% and 1.5%.It is surely irrational to invest in a
fund charging 1.5% p.a. when exactly the same (pre-costs) performance could be obtained for
0.1% p.a.The low cost funds offer a virtually guaranteed advantage of 1.4% p.a. Elton et al.
suggested that one explanation for high levels of investment in high cost tracker funds is the
compensation structure for ﬁnancial advisers. If a ﬁnancial adviser were paid by means of
MARKET EFFICIENCY
534

commission,and if the level of commission were related to the level of fund charges,the ﬁnancial
adviser could be inclined to recommend high cost funds.Where charges are very low there is little
cash ﬂow from which fund managers can pay commission to ﬁnancial advisers.
Using Non-Public Analysis: Analysts’ Forecasts
Ambachtsheer (1974) found a correlation of 0.16 between forecast and actual outcomes.Even the
low forecasting ability, indicated by this correlation coefﬁcient, is useful in achieving better than
average returns.Dimson and Marsh (1984) examined the ability of analysts to forecast returns on
the shares of over 200 of the largest UK quoted companies.They found a coefﬁcient of correlation
of 0.08 between forecasts and outcomes. Although the correlation was extremely small,
transactions carried out in the light of the forecasts appeared to result in a 2.2% outperformance
of the market over the following year. Over half of the informational content of the forecasts was
reﬂected in share prices within one month of the forecast.
Studies on American,British,and Canadian analysts have shown that excess returns are available
to investors who follow the published recommendations of analysts employed by stockbrokers.
These studies have shown that analysts’ stock recommendations have a positive Information
Coefﬁcient (IC),where information coefﬁcient is deﬁned as the correlation between predicted and
actual stock returns.The mean analyst IC appears to be about 0.1.Relevant studies include Davies
and Canes (1978);Stanley et al.(1981);Bjerring et al.(1983);Dimson and Marsh (1984);and Elton
et al. (1986).
Dimson and Marsh (1984) and Elton et al. (1986) found that there was little advantage from
acting on the advice of a single ﬁrm of stockbrokers. However they suggest that by combining the
advice of a number of brokerage ﬁrms the resulting information can lead to excess returns.Womack
(1996) concluded that analysts seem to have good ability in both market timing and stock selection.
Barber et al. (2001) found that there was a signiﬁcant difference in returns between the previously
most highly, and least favourably, rated stocks but the difference offered no proﬁt opportunities
when transaction costs were considered.Jha et al.(2003) concluded that analysts’recommendations
were useful when combined with other information particularly when uncertainty is particularly
high, such as in the cases of small company stocks and technology stocks.The direction of change
in a recommendation may be more useful than the level of recommendation.The ﬁndings of
Woolridge (2004) indicated that there was no advantage to be gained from following the stock
recommendations of brokerage ﬁrms.
Some studies have concluded that there are no differences between analysts in their ability to
forecast stock returns (Coggin and Hunter 1983;Dimson and Marsh 1984).Another study found
that there was no evidence that one US brokerage ﬁrm was consistently better than another in
recommending stocks (Elton et al. 1986).These results might be interpreted as evidence that the
informational value of analysts’ reports arises from the usefulness of commonly used analytical
techniques rather than individual talent. Desai et al. (2000) investigated the recommendations of
the analysts, identiﬁed by the Wall Street Journal as the top three for each industry, and found that
they were successful in specifying the best buys amongst stocks.There is the possibility that the
success of analysts’forecasts arises from self-fulﬁlling prophecies.If investors buy,when forecasts
suggest price rises, their purchases would tend to bring about the rises. Conversely forecasts of
falls would induce sales, thereby causing the falls that were forecast. Mikhail et al. (2004) found
FURTHER EVIDENCE ON MARKET EFFICIENCY
535

that there was some persistence in analysts’abilities to select stocks in that superior (and inferior)
ability tended to continue. Investors react to the recommendations of the superior analysts, with
the reactions continuing for up to three months.However it was found that,net of transaction costs,
knowledge of such persistence provided no opportunities for proﬁt.
Herzberg and Wang (2002) developed a technique for identifying the best analysts. One
criterion was whether the analyst was a leader or a follower. Leading analysts are prepared to
produce recommendations that move away from the consensus view, whereas recommendation
changes by followers are towards the consensus.A record of leading is seen as indicative of superior
analysis, and this indication is seen as stronger when the movements away from the consensus are
large.Another desirable attribute is accuracy of forecasts.Respect from other analysts,as measured
by the extent to which those other analysts revise their recommendations towards the revised
recommendations of lead analysts,is another characteristic of a superior analyst.Whether,and to
what extent, revisions of recommendations by an analyst affect stock prices is another factor.An
analyst who has a relatively substantial affect on stock prices is presumably highly regarded by
market participants. Herzberg and Wang investigated whether the analysts identiﬁed as best,
according to their criteria, provided recommendations that could be proﬁtably followed. It was
found that when such analysts made revisions to recommendations,investors could make proﬁtable
use of those revisions: particularly when they were leading revisions.The conclusion was that by
cherry-picking the best analysts from brokerage ﬁrms it is possible to obtain better information
than either the consensus or any individual brokerage ﬁrm provides,especially when lead revisions
from those superior analysts are used.
Prediction Markets (Decision Markets)
Ray (2006) has argued that prediction markets exhibit strong form efﬁciency (and hence also weak
and semi-strong form efﬁciency).Prediction markets are betting markets that exist beyond national
frontiers, and beyond regulatory authorities. There is nothing to prevent people from using
privileged (inside) information when placing bets.The markets thus draw out information from
informed bettors who want to proﬁt from their knowledge.The markets are able to elicit inside
and expert information.The resulting prices may therefore exhibit a degree of informational
efﬁciency that exceeds that of any regulated market.Regulated markets typically prohibit the use
of privileged information, so that it is less easy for inside information to inﬂuence trading and
thereby become incorporated into market prices. Prediction markets can be based on anything
whose future value is uncertain, including ﬁnancial values. Ray cites a number of studies, which
indicate that prediction markets have been unusually accurate in their forecasts.
Prediction market bets relate to whether a particular event will occur. For example bets
could relate to whether the FTSE All-Share Index will exceed 10,000 points on a particular date.
If the index exceeds 10,000 on the speciﬁed date, someone betting that it would exceed 10,000
receives a sum of money.That sum of money might be £1,000 and people placing bets for and
against the event occurring would determine the price of the bets. For example the price could
be £200. Buyers would pay £200 for the prospect of winning £1,000. If the stock index does
exceed 10,000 points, the buyer would receive £1,000 from a seller thereby making a proﬁt of
£800. If the index does not exceed 10,000 points, the seller receives the £200.The price of £200
implies a 20% probability that the index will exceed 10,000 points.In other words the prediction
MARKET EFFICIENCY
536

market forecasts a 20% probability that the FTSE All-Share Index will exceed 10,000 points on
the designated date.
DEGREES OF EFFICIENCY AND THE ADAPTIVE MARKETS HYPOTHESIS
Arguably the issue is not whether a market is, or is not, efﬁcient.The issue is how efﬁcient a
particular market is.Market efﬁciency could be seen to parallel the perfectly competitive market
of economic theory.They are rarely, if ever, achieved in reality. Nonetheless they both constitute
a useful benchmark against which to compare actual markets.They also serve to provide models
that are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the real world.
Simon (1955) argued that investors exhibited ‘bounded rationality’, which means that they
have limited capacities to absorb and analyse information.They are not able to make the precise
calculations, which would provide the optimum solutions to their investment problems.
Correspondingly market prices do not reach their precisely correct levels. Instead investors
satisﬁce,which means they attain acceptable approximations to their optimum positions.Satisﬁcing
portfolios could be achieved by trial-and-error processes based on the use of behavioural heuristics.
When market participants have achieved such satisfactory portfolios,the market will approximate
informational efﬁciency.
Lo (2004) argued that, from time to time, circumstances would change. Changes in
circumstances require new portfolios and new equilibrium prices. Market participants move
towards the new satisﬁcing portfolios using heuristics in a trial-and-error process.According to this
view,behavioural heuristics are not incompatible with the efﬁcient markets hypothesis.Behavioural
heuristics are an aspect of the process whereby markets move from one approximation to efﬁciency
to another. Lo called this the ‘adaptive markets hypothesis’. Markets could be seen as following
evolutionary paths wherein they adapt to changed circumstances by behavioural iterative processes
that mirror the survival of the ﬁttest process of natural selection.Successive solutions to the problem
of determining optimal portfolios are tried using heuristics,and the solutions that approximate most
closely to the optimum are the ones that survive.The heuristics of behavioural ﬁnance are the means
of adjusting from one approximation to market efﬁciency to the next. Behavioural ﬁnance is
complementary to, rather than a contradiction of, the efﬁcient markets hypothesis.
An implication of the adaptive markets hypothesis is that the degree of market efﬁciency is not
constant. Lo (2004) presented evidence showing that market efﬁciency, as measured by serial
correlation, ﬂuctuates over time. It is tempting to think that a market becomes steadily more
efﬁcient over time as the market participants become more sophisticated,but that does not appear
to be the case. Degrees of efﬁciency show periods of decline as well as periods of advance.This is
consistent with the view that changes in circumstances disrupt (approximate) efﬁciency and that
markets take time to reach a new (approximate) efﬁciency.
Lo (2004) also explains how the new equilibrium positions can be path dependent.A new set
of stock prices are path dependent if they are affected by the process by which the new equilibrium
is achieved.A stock market crash could permanently deter some investors from the market. In
consequence the market will have fewer investors.The absence of those investors will also affect
the risk preference of the market,and hence the equilibrium stock prices (Part 4 on capital market
theory shows how risk preferences,through models such as the capital asset pricing model,affect
equilibrium prices by way of affecting risk premiums).A stock market crash does not simply cause
FURTHER EVIDENCE ON MARKET EFFICIENCY
537

a temporary deviation of stock prices from their ‘correct’levels;it also changes the ‘correct’levels
towards which the market eventually tends to move.
It is interesting to reﬂect on some views expressed by Fisher Black (1986). He argued that
traders could be divided into information traders, who are rational traders using relevant
information,and noise traders.Noise is irrelevant or meaningless information.Noise trading puts
noise into market prices, causing them to depart from their true values.The deviations caused by
noise trading can be cumulative.As a stock price diverges further from its true value, the scope
for proﬁts from information trading becomes greater.Although information trading tends to pull
prices towards their true values, it can be difﬁcult to distinguish noise from relevant and accurate
information. Black argued that a market could be efﬁcient even if a share price differs from its
fundamental value by a factor of as much as two.This view appears to allow a market to be regarded
as efﬁcient even if the degree of efﬁciency varies over time.
THE FRACTAL MARKET HYPOTHESIS
Peters (1994) suggested that the efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH) should be replaced by a fractal
market hypothesis (FMH). One feature of fractal analysis is that it allows for a multiplicity of
investment horizons.This contrasts with the capital asset pricing model, which assumes that all
investors have the same investment horizon.
Peters (1994) offered some basic assumptions of the FMH, including:
1.
The market consists of many individuals covering a large number of investment horizons.At
one extreme is the day trader who changes the investment portfolio on a daily basis,whereas
at the other extreme may be a pension fund that changes its portfolio slowly and has a long
investment horizon.However both types of investor trade in the market,and they both provide
liquidity for the other.
2.
Reaction to information depends upon the investment horizon. Short-horizon investors and
long-horizon investors react to different types of information.Correspondingly they may use
different types of analysis;perhaps technical analysis in the case of short-horizon investors and
fundamental analysis in the case of long-horizon investors.
3.
The stability of the market depends on liquidity, and a large number of investors with
many different investment horizons create liquidity in the market.A market crash,as perceived
by a short-horizon investor, may be a buying opportunity when seen by a long-horizon
investor.The sales of the former provide the purchases of the latter,and stability ensues.If long-
horizon investors shorten their investment horizons, perhaps due to increased uncertainty,
the liquidity and stability from the variety of horizons is reduced.When horizons become
uniform a market bubble,or market crash,could ensue as all investors react to the same news
in the same way.
4.
Prices reﬂect a combination of short-term technical trading and long-term fundamental
valuation. The long-term trend in the market reﬂects changes in expected earnings,
which are likely to be related to economic cycles. Short-term trends are more likely to
reﬂect crowd psychology. Economic cycles are less volatile than trading activity, which
makes long-term stock market returns less volatile than short-term movements (Rachev et
al. 1999).

CONCLUSION
There is a body of research evidence from event studies that supports semi-strong form efﬁciency,
but the support is not unambiguous. Strong form efﬁciency appears to be contradicted by the
observation of insider trading proﬁts,although studies of such trading are complicated by the fact
that in many countries insider trading is illegal.
The private investment analysis of institutional investors is a form of inside information.This
inside information does not appear consistently to provide proﬁts. On average institutional
investors fail to outperform the market, as represented by stock indices. Although some
institutional investors have long runs of above-average performance,it is to be expected that a few
would do so purely as a matter of chance.
The publicly available opinions of investment analysts,in aggregate,appear to have some value
for making abnormal proﬁts. Although such analysis seems to provide information of use to
investors (albeit a modest amount) institutional investors do not seem to be able to make proﬁts
from it.The evidence on the inability of institutional investors consistently to outperform stock
indices provides a persistent argument in support of the efﬁcient market hypothesis (evidence on
this is also provided in Chapters 9, 11, and 17 on mutual funds, pensions, and the evaluation of
fund managers, respectively, and Part 7 on market efﬁciency).
Market efﬁciency has two alternative meanings. One is that security prices fully reﬂect all
relevant information.The other is that there is no possibility of making abnormal proﬁts (e.g.
consistently outperforming stock indices).The mixed evidence on the ﬁrst meaning leads to a
conclusion that it is a matter of degrees of efﬁciency,rather than the existence or otherwise of full
efﬁciency.However the evidence on the latter meaning seems to provide strong support for market
efﬁciency.Efﬁciency in the second sense leads to suggestions that retail investors are better off with
low cost index tracker funds than with actively managed funds. Why pay fund managers to
outperform the market when they appear to be unable to do so?

Chapter 27
Stock market bubbles
and crashes
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Characteristics and causes of bubbles and crashes.
2. The implications of behavioural ﬁnance for the understanding of bubbles and crashes.
3. The role of investor overreaction.
4. The roles of borrowing and liquidity.
5. Portfolio insurance and its potential role.
6. Research using experimental markets.
7. Complexity theory as an explanation of bubbles and crashes.
8. Catastrophe theory as an explanation of crashes and surges
9. How crashes can generate banking crises.
The occurrence of stock market bubbles and crashes is often cited as evidence against the efﬁcient
market hypothesis. It is argued that new information is rarely, if ever, capable of explaining the
sudden and dramatic share price movements observed during bubbles and crashes. Samuelson
(1998) distinguished between micro efﬁciency and macro efﬁciency. Samuelson took the view
that major stock markets are micro efﬁcient in the sense that stocks are (nearly) correctly priced
relative to each other,whereas the stock markets are macro inefﬁcient.Macro inefﬁciency means
that prices, at the aggregate level, can deviate from fair values over time. Jung and Shiller (2002)
concurred with Samuelson’s view and suggested that waves of over- and undervaluation occur for
the aggregate market over time. Stock markets are seen as having some predictability in the
aggregate and over the long run.
CHARACTERISTICS OF BUBBLES AND CRASHES
Bubbles and crashes have a history that goes back at least to the seventeenth century (MacKay
1852).Some writers have suggested that bubbles show common characteristics.Band (1989) said
that market tops exhibited the following features:

1.
Prices have risen dramatically.
2.
Widespread rejection of the conventional methods of share valuation, and the emergence of
new ‘theories’ to explain why share prices should be much higher than the conventional
methods would indicate.
3.
Proliferation of investment schemes offering very high returns very quickly.
4.
Intense, and temporarily successful, speculation by uninformed investors.
5.
Popular enthusiasm for leveraged (geared) investments.
6.
Selling by corporate insiders, and other long-term investors.
7.
Extremely high trading volume in shares.
Kindleberger (1989) and Kindleberger and Aliber (2005) argued that most bubbles and crashes
have common characteristics.Bubbles feature large and rapid price increases,which result in share
prices rising to unrealistically high levels. Bubbles typically begin with a justiﬁable rise in stock
prices.The justiﬁcation may be a technological advance, or a general rise in prosperity. Examples
of technological advance stimulating share price rises might include the development of the
automobile and radio in the 1920s and the emergence of the Internet in the late 1990s.Examples
of increasing prosperity leading to price rises could be the United States,Western Europe,and Japan
in the 1980s. Cassidy (2002) suggested that this initial stage is characterised by a new idea or
product causing changes in expectations about the future. Early investors in companies involved
with the innovation make very high returns, which attract the attention of others.
The rise in share prices, if substantial and prolonged, leads to members of the public believing
that prices will continue to rise.People who do not normally invest begin to buy shares in the belief
that prices will continue to rise. More and more people, typically people who have no knowledge
of ﬁnancial markets, buy shares.This pushes up prices even further.There is euphoria and manic
buying.This causes further price rises.There is a self-fulﬁlling prophecy wherein the belief that
prices will rise brings about the rise,since it leads to buying.People with no knowledge of investment
often believe that if share prices have risen recently,those prices will continue to rise in the future.
Cassidy (2002) divides this process into a boom stage and a euphoria stage.In the boom stage share
price rises generate media interest, which spreads the excitement across a wider audience. Even
the professionals working for institutional investors become involved. In the euphoria stage
investment principles,and even common sense,are discarded.Conventional wisdom is rejected in
favour of the view that it is ‘all different this time’. Prices lose touch with reality.
One assumption of the efﬁcient market hypothesis is that investors are rational.This does not
require all investors to be rational, but it does require that the rational investors outweigh the
irrational ones.However there are times when irrational investors are dominant.A possible cause
of market overreaction is the tendency of some investors (often small investors) to follow the
market. Such investors believe that recent stock price movements are indicators of future price
movements. In other words they extrapolate price movements.They buy when prices have been
rising and thereby tend to push prices to unrealistically high levels.They sell when prices have
been falling and thereby drive prices to excessively low levels.There are times when such naive
investors outweigh those that invest on the basis of fundamental analysis of the intrinsic value of
the shares. Such irrational investors help to generate bubbles and crashes in stock markets.
Some professional investors may also participate on the basis of the greater fool theory.The
greater fool theory states that it does not matter if the price paid is higher than the fundamental value,
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
541

so long as someone (the greater fool) will be prepared to pay an even higher price.The theory of
rational bubbles suggests that investors weigh the probability of further rises against the probability
of falls.So it may be rational for an investor to buy shares,knowing that they are overvalued,if the
probability-weighted expectation of gain exceeds the probability-weighted expectation of loss.
Montier (2002) offers Keynes’s (1936) beauty contest as an explanation of stock market bubbles.
The ﬁrst level of the contest is to choose the stocks that you believe to offer the best prospects.
The second level is to choose stocks that you believe others will see as offering the best prospects.
A third level is to choose the stocks that you believe that others will expect the average investor
to select.A fourth stage might involve choosing stocks that you believe that others will expect the
average investor to see as most popular amongst investors. In other words, the beauty contest
view sees investors as indulging in levels of second-guessing other investors.Even if every investor
believes that a stock market crash is coming they may not sell stocks.They may even continue to
buy.They may plan to sell just before others sell.In this way they expect to maximise their proﬁts
from the rising market.The result is that markets continue to rise beyond what the vast majority
of investors would consider to be the values consistent with economic fundamentals.It is interesting
to note that Shiller’s survey following the 1987 crash (Shiller 1987) found that 84% of institutional
investors and 72% of private investors said that they had believed that the market was overpriced
just before the crash. Shiller suggested that people did not realise how many others shared their
views that the market was overpriced.
SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
As Hirshleifer (2001) points out, people have a tendency to conform to the judgements and
behaviours of others. People may follow others without any apparent reason. Such behaviour
results in a form of herding,which helps to explain the development of bubbles and crashes.If there
is a uniformity of view concerning the direction of a market,the result is likely to be a movement
of the market in that direction.Furthermore,the herd may stampede.Shiller (2000) said that the
meaning of herd behaviour is that investors tend to do as other investors do.They imitate the
behaviour of others and disregard their own information.
Brown (1999) examined the effect of noise traders (non-professionals with no special
information) on the volatility of the prices of closed-end funds (investment trusts). A shift in
sentiment entailed these investors moving together and an increase in price volatility resulted.
Walter and Weber (2006) found herding to be present among managers of mutual funds.
Walter and Weber (2006) distinguished between intentional and unintentional herding.
Intentional herding was seen as arising from attempts to copy others. Unintentional herding
emerges as a result of investors analysing the same information in the same way.Intentional herding
could develop as a consequence of poor availability of information. Investors might copy the
behaviour of others in the belief that those others have traded on the basis of information.When
copying others in the belief that they are acting on information becomes widespread, there is an
informational cascade.
Another possible cause of intentional herding arises as a consequence of career risk. If a fund
manager loses money whilst others make money, that fund manager’s job may be in jeopardy. If a
fund manager loses money whilst others lose money,there is more job security.So it can be in the
fund manager’s interests to do as others do (this is sometimes referred to as the reputational reason
MARKET EFFICIENCY
542

for herding). Since fund managers are often evaluated in relation to benchmarks based on the
average performance of fund managers, or based on stock indices, there could be an incentive to
copy others since that would prevent substantial underperformance relative to the benchmark.
Walter and Weber (2006) found positive feedback trading by mutual fund managers. In other
words the managers bought stocks following price rises and sold following falls.If such momentum
trading is common,it could be a cause of unintentional herding.Investors do the same thing because
they are following the same strategy. It can be difﬁcult to know whether observed herding is
intentional or unintentional.
Hwang and Salmon (2006) investigated herding in the sense that investors, following the
performance of the market as a whole, buy or sell simultaneously. Investigating in the United
States, the UK, and South Korea they found that herding increases with market sentiment.They
found that herding occurs to a greater extent when investor expectations are relatively
homogeneous. Herding is strongest when there is conﬁdence about the direction in which the
market is heading.Herding appeared to be persistent and slow moving.This is consistent with the
observation that some bubbles have taken years to develop.
Kirman (1991) suggests that investors may not necessarily base decisions on their own views
about investments but upon what they see as the majority view.The majority being followed are
not necessarily well-informed rational investors.The investors that are followed may be uninformed
and subject to psychological biases that render their behaviour irrational (from the perspective of
economists).Rational investors may even focus on predicting the behaviour of irrational investors
rather than trying to ascertain fundamental value (this may explain the popularity of technical
analysis among market professionals).
There are theories of the diffusion of information based on models of epidemics.In such models
there are ‘carriers’ who meet ‘susceptibles’ (Shiller 1989). Stock market (and property market)
bubbles and crashes are likened to the spread of epidemics.There is evidence that ideas can remain
dormant for long periods and then be triggered by an apparently trivial event. Face-to-face
communication appears to be dominant,but the media also plays a role.Cassidy (2002) suggested
that people want to become players in an ongoing drama in which ownership of stocks gives them
a sense of being part of a social movement. People invest because they do not want to be left out
of the exciting developments.
The media are an integral part of market events because they want to attract viewers and
readers. Generally, signiﬁcant market events occur only if there is similar thinking among large
groups of people, and the news media are vehicles for the spreading of ideas.The news media are
attracted to ﬁnancial markets because there is a persistent ﬂow of news in the form of daily price
changes and company reports.The media seek interesting news.The media can be fundamental
propagators of speculative price movements through their efforts to make news interesting (Shiller
2000).They may try to enhance interest by attaching news stories to stock price movements,
thereby focusing greater attention on the movements.The media are also prone to focus attention
on particular stories for long periods. Shiller refers to this as an ‘attention cascade’. Attention
cascades can contribute to stock market bubbles and crashes.
Davis (2006) conﬁrmed the role of the media in the development of extreme market
movements.The media were found to exaggerate market responses to news, and to magnify
irrational market expectations.At times of market crisis the media can push trading activity to
extremes.The media can trigger and reinforce opinions.
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
543

It has been suggested that memes may play a part in the process by which ideas spread (Lynch
2001). Memes are contagious ideas. It has been suggested that the success of a meme depends
upon three critical factors: transmissivity, receptivity, and longevity.Transmissivity is the amount
of dissemination from those with the idea.Receptivity concerns how believable,or acceptable,the
idea is. Longevity relates to how long investors keep the idea in mind.
Smith (1991) put forward the view that bubbles and crashes seem to have their origin in
social inﬂuences. Social inﬂuence may mean following a leader, reacting simultaneously and
identically with other investors in response to new information, or imitation of others who are
either directly observed or observed indirectly through the media. Social inﬂuence appears to
be strongest when an individual feels uncertain and ﬁnds no directly applicable earlier personal
experience.
Deutsch and Gerard (1955) distinguish between ‘normative social inﬂuence’and ‘informational
social inﬂuence’. Normative social inﬂuence does not involve a change in perceptions or beliefs,
merely conformity for the beneﬁts of conformity.An example of normative social inﬂuence would
be that of professional investment managers who copy each other on the grounds that being wrong
when everyone else is wrong does not jeopardise one’s career,but being wrong when the majority
get it right can result in job loss.This is a form of regret avoidance. If a bad decision were made, a
result would be the pain of regret.By following the decisions of others,the risk of regret is reduced.
This is safety in numbers.There is less fear of regret when others are making the same decisions.
Informational social inﬂuence entails acceptance of a group’s beliefs as providing information.
For example share purchases by others delivers information that they believe that prices will rise
in future.This is accepted as useful information about the stock market and leads others to buy
also.This is an informational cascade;people see the actions of others as providing information and
act on that information. Investors buy because they know that others are buying, and in buying
provide information to other investors who buy in their turn. Informational cascades can cause
large, and economically unjustiﬁed, swings in stock market levels. Investors cease to make their
own judgements based on factual information,and use the apparent information conveyed by the
actions of others instead.Investment decisions based on relevant information cease,and hence the
process whereby stock prices come to reﬂect relevant information comes to an end. Share price
movements come to be disconnected from relevant information.
Both of the types of social inﬂuence identiﬁed by Deutsch and Gerard (1955) can lead to positive
feedback trading. Positive feedback trading involves buying because prices have been rising and
selling when prices have been falling, since price movements are seen as providing information
about the views of other investors. Buying pushes prices yet higher (and thereby stimulates more
buying) and selling pushes prices lower (and hence encourages more selling). Such trading
behaviour contributes to stock market bubbles and crashes.
People in a peer group tend to develop the same tastes, interests, and opinions (Ellison and
Fudenberg 1993). Social norms emerge in relation to shared beliefs.These social norms include
beliefs about investing.The social environment of an investor inﬂuences investment decisions.This
applies not only to individual investors,but also to market professionals.Fund managers are a peer
group; fundamental analysts are a peer group; technical analysts are a peer group. Indeed market
professionals in aggregate form a peer group. It is likely that there are times when these peer
groups develop common beliefs about the direction of the stock market.Common beliefs tend to
engender stock market bubbles and crashes.

Welch (2000) investigated herding among investment analysts.Herding was seen as occurring
when analysts appeared to mimic the recommendations of other analysts. It was found that there
was herding towards the prevailing consensus, and towards recent revisions of the forecasts of
other analysts.A conclusion of the research was that in bull markets the rise in share prices would
be reinforced by herding.
Research on investor psychology has indicated certain features about the behaviour
of uninformed investors, who are often referred to as noise traders in the academic literature.
Tversky and Kahneman (1982) found that they have a tendency to overreact to news. DeBondt
(1993) found that they extrapolate trends, in other words they tend to believe that the recent
direction of movement of share prices will continue.Shleifer and Summers (1990) found evidence
that they become overconﬁdent in their forecasts.This latter point is consistent with the view that
bubbles and crashes are characterised by some investors forgetting that ﬁnancial markets
are uncertain,and coming to believe that the direction of movement of share prices can be forecast
with certainty. Barberis et al. (1998) suggested that noise traders, as a result of misinterpretation
of information,see patterns where there are none.Lee (1998) mentioned that a sudden and drastic
trend reversal may mean that earlier cues of a change in trend had been neglected. Clarke
and Statman (1998) found that noise traders tend to follow newsletters, which in turn are prone
to herding.
It seems that many investors not only extrapolate price trends but also extrapolate streams of
good or bad news, for example a succession of pieces of good news leads to the expectation that
future news will also be good. Barberis et al. (1998) showed that shares that had experienced a
succession of positive items of news tended to become overpriced.This indicates that stock prices
overreact to consistent patterns of good or bad news. Lakonishok et al. (1994) concluded that
investors appeared to extrapolate the past too far into the future.
There is evidence that the ﬂow of money into institutional investment funds (such as unit trusts)
has an impact on stock market movements.Evidence for a positive relationship between fund ﬂows
and subsequent stock market returns comes from Edelen and Warner (2001),Neal and Wheatley
(1998), Randall et al. (2003), and Warther (1995). It has been suggested by Indro (2004) that
market sentiment (an aspect of crowd psychology) plays an important role.Indro found that poll-
based measures of market sentiment were related to the size of net inﬂows into equity funds. It
appears that improved sentiment (optimism) generates investment into institutional funds,which
in turn brings about a rise in stock market prices (and vice versa for increased pessimism).If stock
market rises render market sentiment more optimistic, a circular process occurs in which rising
prices and improving sentiment reinforce each other.
It has often been suggested that small investors have a tendency to buy when the market has
risen and to sell when the market falls. Karceski (2002) reported that between 1984 and 1996
average monthly inﬂows into US equity mutual funds were about eight times higher in bull markets
than in bear markets.The largest inﬂows were found to occur after the market had moved higher
and the smallest inﬂows followed falls. Mosebach and Najand (1999) found interrelationships
between stock market rises and ﬂows of funds into the market. Rises in the market were related
to its own previous rises,indicating a momentum effect,and to previous cash inﬂows to the market.
Cash inﬂows also showed momentum,and were related to previous market rises.A high net inﬂow
of funds increased stock market prices, and price rises increased the net inﬂow of funds. In other
words, positive feedback trading was identiﬁed.
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
545

This buy high/sell low investment strategy may be predicted by the ‘house money’ and ‘snake
bite’ effects (Thaler and Johnson 1990).After making a gain people are willing to take risks with
the winnings since they do not fully regard the money gained as their own (it is the ‘house money’).
So people may be more willing to buy following a price rise. Conversely the ‘snake bite’ effect
renders people more risk-averse following a loss.The pain of a loss (the snake bite) can cause people
to avoid the risk of more loss by selling investments seen as risky.When many investors are affected
by these biases, the market as a whole may be affected.The house money effect can contribute to
the emergence of a stock market bubble.The snake bite effect can contribute to a crash.
The tendency to buy following a stock market rise, and to sell following a fall, can also be
explained in terms of changes in attitude towards risk. Clarke and Statman (1998) reported that
risk tolerance fell dramatically just after the stock market crash of 1987.In consequence investors
became less willing to invest in the stock market after the crash. MacKillop (2003) andYao et al.
(2004) found a relationship between market prices and risk tolerance.The ﬁndings were that
investors became more tolerant of risk following market rises, and less risk tolerant following
falls.The implication is that people are more inclined to buy shares when markets have been rising
and more inclined to sell when they have been falling;behaviour which reinforces the direction of
market movement.Shefrin (2000) found similar effects among ﬁnancial advisers and institutional
investors. Grable et al. (2004) found a positive relationship between stock market closing prices
and risk tolerance.As the previous week’s closing price increased,risk tolerance increased.When
the market dropped,the following week’s risk tolerance also dropped.Since risk tolerance affects
the willingness of investors to buy risky assets such as shares, the relationship between market
movements and risk tolerance tends to reinforce the direction of market movement. During
market rises people become more inclined to buy shares,thus pushing share prices up further.After
market falls investors are more likely to sell, thereby pushing the market down further.
Projection bias is high sensitivity to momentary information and feelings such that current
attitudes and preferences are expected to continue into the future (Loewenstein et al. 2003).
Mehra and Sah (2002) found that risk tolerance varied over time and that people behaved as if their
current risk preference would persist into the future. In other words the current level of risk
tolerance was subject to a projection bias such that it was expected to continue into the future.
Grable et al. (2006) pointed out that this interacts with the effects of market movements on risk
tolerance.A rise in the market enhances risk tolerance,projection bias leads to a belief that current
risk tolerance will persist, people buy more shares, share purchases cause price rises, price rises
increase risk tolerance,and so forth.A virtuous circle of rising prices and rising risk tolerance could
emerge.Conversely there could be a vicious circle entailing falling prices and rising risk-aversion.
The Role of Social Mood
People transmit moods to one another when interacting socially. People not only receive
information and opinions in the process of social interaction,they also receive moods and emotions.
Moods and emotions interact with cognitive processes when people make decisions.There are
times when such feelings can be particularly important,such as in periods of uncertainty and when
the decision is very complex. The moods and emotions may be unrelated to a decision, but
nonetheless affect the decision.The general level of optimism or pessimism in society will inﬂuence
individuals and their decisions, including their ﬁnancial decisions.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
546

There is a distinction between emotions and moods. Emotions are often short term and tend
to be related to a particular person,object,or situation.Moods are free-ﬂoating and not attached
to something speciﬁc.A mood is a general state of mind and can persist for long periods. Mood
may have no particular causal stimulus and have no particular target.
Positive mood is accompanied by emotions such as optimism, happiness, and hope.These
feelings can become extreme and result in euphoria. Negative mood is associated with emotions
such as fear,pessimism,and antagonism.Nofsinger (2005a) suggested that social mood is quickly
reﬂected in the stock market, such that the stock market becomes an indicator of social mood.
Prechter (1999,2001),in proposing a socionomics hypothesis,argued that moods cause ﬁnancial
market trends and contribute to a tendency for investors to act in a concerted manner and to
exhibit herding behaviour.
Many psychologists would argue that actions are driven by what people think,which is heavily
inﬂuenced by how they feel. How people feel is partly determined by their interactions with
others. Prechter’s socionomic hypothesis suggests that human interactions spread moods and
emotions.When moods and emotions become widely shared, the resulting feelings of optimism
or pessimism cause uniformity in ﬁnancial decision-making.This amounts to herding and has
impacts on ﬁnancial markets at the aggregate level.
Slovic et al. (2002) proposed an affect heuristic.Affect refers to feelings, which are subtle and
of which people may be unaware. Impressions and feelings based on affect are often easier bases
for decision-making than an objective evaluation,particularly when the decision is complex.Since
the use of affect in decision-making is a form of short cut, it could be regarded as a heuristic.
Loewenstein et al. (2001) showed how emotions interact with cognitive thought processes and how
at times the emotional process can dominate cognitive processes.Forgas (1995) took the view that
the role of emotions increased as the complexity and uncertainty facing the decision-maker
increased.
Information can spread through society in a number of ways: books, magazines, newspapers,
television, radio, the Internet, and personal contact. Nofsinger suggests that personal contact is
particularly important since it readily conveys mood and emotion as well as information.
Interpersonal contact is important to the propagation of social mood.Such contact results in shared
mood as well as shared information.
Prechter suggested that economic expansions and equity bull markets are associated with
positive feelings such as optimism and enthusiasm whereas economic recessions and bear markets
correspond to an increase in negative emotions like pessimism, fear, and anger. During a stock
market uptrend society and investors are characterised by feelings of calmness and contentment,
at the market top they are happy and enthusiastic, during the market downturn the feelings are
ones of sadness and insecurity, whilst the market bottom is associated with feelings of anger,
hostility, and tension.
Dreman (2001) suggested that at the peaks and troughs of social mood,characterised by manias
and panics, psychological inﬂuences play the biggest role in the decisions of investment analysts
and fund managers.Forecasts will be the most positive at the peak of social mood and most negative
at the troughs. Psychological inﬂuences can contaminate rational decision-making, and may be
dominant at the extreme highs and lows of social mood. At the extremes of social mood the
traditional techniques of investment analysis might be rejected by many as being no longer
applicable in the new era.
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
547

Shiller (1984) took the view that stock prices are likely to be particularly vulnerable to social
mood because there is no generally accepted approach to stock pricing; different analysts use
different models in different ways.The potential inﬂuence of social mood is even greater among
non-professionals who have little, or no, understanding of pricing models and ﬁnancial analysis.
Nofsinger (2005a) saw the link to be so strong that stock market prices could be used as a measure
of social mood.
Peaks and troughs of social mood are characterised by emotional decision-making rather than
rational evaluation. Cognitive evaluations indicating that stocks are overpriced are dominated by
a mood of optimism. Support for one’s downplaying of rational evaluation receives support from
the fact that others downplay rational evaluation.The optimism of others validates one’s own
optimism.It is often argued that the normal methods of evaluation are no longer applicable in the
new era. Fisher and Statman (2002) surveyed investors during the high-tech bubble of the late
1990s and found that although many investors believed stocks to be overpriced, they expected
prices to continue rising.
Eventually social mood passes its peak and cognitive rationality comes to dominate social mood.
Investors sell and prices fall. If social mood continues to fall, the result could be a crash in which
stock prices fall too far.The situation is then characterised by an unjustiﬁed level of pessimism,
and investors sell shares even when they are already underpriced. Investors’ sales drive prices
down further and increase the degree of underpricing. Fisher and Statman (2000) provided
evidence that stock market movements affect sentiment.A vicious circle could develop in which
falling sentiment causes prices to fall and declining prices lower sentiment.
A PSYCHOANALYTIC PERSPECTIVE
Tafﬂer and Tuckett (2002) provided a psychoanalytic perspective on the technology stock bubble
and crash of the late 1990s and early 2000s,and in so doing gave a description of investor behaviour
totally at odds with the efﬁcient markets view of rational decision-making based on all relevant
information.They made it clear that people do not share a common perception of reality;instead
everyone has their own psychic reality. These psychic realities will have varying degrees of
connection with objective reality. Decisions are driven by psychic reality, which is a realm of
feelings and emotions.Reason may be secondary to feeling.Feeling affects the perception of reality.
People are seen as engaging in wish-fulﬁlment wherein they perceive reality so that it
accommodates to what they want.People see what they want to see.Unpleasant aspects of reality
may be subject to denial, which is the pretence that unpleasant events and situations have not
happened. Denial reduces the ability to learn from unpleasant experiences, since unpleasant
experiences are removed from conscious awareness.
The unconscious mind operates as a censor that keeps out unpleasant information. People
are constantly bombarded by far more information than the human mind can handle.
The unconscious mind reduces incoming information to a quantity that can be dealt with.Although
much of this rejected information is peripheral to needs, some information may be rejected
because it is unpleasant.The conscious mind, the mind of which we are aware, does not receive
complete information.The efﬁcient market view of rational investors who base decisions on all
relevant information does not sit comfortably with this psychoanalytic view of mental
processes.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
548

In relation to stock market bubbles, the psychoanalytic view of Tafﬂer and Tuckett (2002) sees
stocks as taking on a signiﬁcance for the unconscious mind,which reﬂects experiences of infancy.
The unconscious mind has considerable inﬂuence over thinking and decision-making.Since people
are not aware of their unconscious minds, they are not aware of the inﬂuence of the unconscious
mind over decision-making.The unconscious mind may exclude uncomfortable aspects of reality
from awareness.When the bubble bursts, and prices fall, it becomes impossible to completely
exclude unpleasant aspects of objective reality from awareness.Feelings of anxiety,loss,panic,and
shame emerge. Selling the shares as quickly as possible could then become part of the process of
denial.
In the view of Bargh and Chartrand (1999) people’s goals, as well as their behaviours, are
affected by factors outside conscious awareness. Investment behaviour is likely to be affected by
emotions, which are outside conscious awareness.
THE IMPLICATIONS OF BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE
FOR UNDERSTANDING BUBBLES AND CRASHES
Behavioural ﬁnance applies the psychology of decision-making to investment behaviour.
Psychological research has indicated that there are a number of systematic distortions that cause
investors to deviate from the model of rationality typically assumed by ﬁnancial economists.Some
of these biases help to explain how stock markets can experience bubbles and crashes.
Representativeness and Narrow Framing
It is not difﬁcult to see how behavioural ﬁnance concepts can be used in the explanation of
stock market bubbles and crashes.For example the concept of representativeness helps to explain
the apparent tendency for investors to chase the market.Many people seem to believe that recent
price rises will continue into the future, likewise recent price falls. As a result they buy when
they see that prices have been rising, causing prices to rise further, and sell when they see that
prices have been falling, accentuating the price falls. DeBondt (1993) reported a study of 38,000
forecasts of stock prices and exchange rates.He found that non-experts expected the continuation
of apparent past trends in prices. They were optimistic in bull markets and pessimistic in
bear markets.
One interpretation of representativeness is that investments that have shown recent price rises
are representative of longer term successes (and conversely for those showing recent price falls).
Another way of looking at representativeness views it as suggesting that people see patterns and
trends where they do not exist. Recent upward price movements are interpreted as an upward
trend that will continue into the future (conversely with price falls).
Thus representativeness explains how opinions about price trends can emerge, and through
affecting trading those opinions become self-fulﬁlling.The persistence of such opinions,and hence
the resulting bubbles or crashes, may be explained by the concepts of conservatism and
conﬁrmation bias.Conservatism renders people unwilling to change their opinions in the light of
new information, so they may adhere to a view about the direction of prices even when those
prices have moved too far. Conﬁrmation bias is the tendency for people to pay attention to
information that supports their opinions,and to ignore contrary evidence.Again this causes them
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
549

to persist with market views,and trading behaviour,even when evidence suggests that those views
may be incorrect.
Narrow framing suggests that investors focus too much on the short term.In consequence the
very recent behaviour of share prices is focused upon and the longer term past is ignored.This
reinforces the tendency of representativeness to lead to unjustiﬁed long-term expectations on the
basis of short-term price movements.
These ideas are consistent with the emergence of stock price bubbles and crashes.Recent price
increases cause expectations of future increases and investors buy shares.This pushes prices up
further, and hence generates expectations of more increases and leads to yet more buying.There
is an upward spiral often referred to as positive feedback trading or as ‘chasing the market’.There
is a corresponding, but opposite, pattern as the market falls.
Overconﬁdence
Psychological research has indicated that there is a self-attribution bias in decision-making.When
an investment is successful, the investor believes that it is due to his or her skill.An unsuccessful
investment is seen to fail as a result of bad luck or the actions of others.This self-attribution bias
leads to overconﬁdence.Overconﬁdence is also reinforced by the hindsight bias,which is the false
belief held by people who know the outcome of an event, that they would have predicted the
outcome.Overconﬁdence may be particularly characteristic of inexperienced investors who ﬁnd
that their initial investments are proﬁtable.Their belief in their own skill leads them to invest more.
So a bull market can generate overconﬁdence, which causes more investing thereby reinforcing
the upward price movement.There is a Wall Street adage, which says:‘Don’t confuse brains with
a bull market.’
However there are those who interpret their gains in a bull market as arising from their own
skills.They see certainty where there is uncertainty.This can lead them to invest beyond a rational
level, and painful losses result when the market falls.
Overconﬁdence can arise from excessive conﬁdence in the quality of one’s information and an
exaggerated view of one’s ability to interpret that information.This leads to an unwarranted degree
of certainty about the accuracy of one’s forecasts and a corresponding underestimation of risk
(Barber and Odean 1999).In consequence overconﬁdent investors are prone to invest to a greater
extent than would be the case if they properly understood the quality of their forecasts.Barber and
Odean have found that overconﬁdent investors tend to take more risk than less conﬁdent investors.
During the late 1990s there was a bull market, particularly in technology stocks. During the
bull market, individual investors increased their levels of trading. Investors allocated higher
proportions of their portfolios to shares, invested in riskier (often technology) companies, and
many investors borrowed money in order to increase their shareholdings (Barber and Odean
2001). It is likely that, during the bull market, individual investors attributed too much of their
success to their own expertise and became overconﬁdent as a result.
A psychological bias that helps to produce overconﬁdence is the illusion of control. People
often behave as if they have inﬂuence over uncontrollable events (Presson and Benassi 1996).A
number of attributes have been identiﬁed as fostering the illusion of control. One of these is the
outcome sequence. Positive outcomes early give a person more illusion of control than negative
outcomes early.This is akin to the tendency for some people to become addicted to gambling if
MARKET EFFICIENCY
550

their ﬁrst few bets are successful. In a rising stock market people investing for the ﬁrst time will
experience gains. This is likely to engender the illusion of control, overconﬁdence, and the
inclination to invest more. If signiﬁcant numbers of people invest more, prices will continue to
rise thereby reinforcing these psychological biases.
Another attribute that fosters the illusion of control is the acquisition of information.Increased
information increases the illusion of control and the degree of overconﬁdence.This has been called
the illusion of knowledge (Nofsinger 2005;Peterson and Pitz 1988).The information may or may
not be relevant to the investments.Particularly for investors with little knowledge of investment,
information does not give them as much understanding as they think because they lack the expertise
to interpret it.They may be unable to distinguish relevant and reliable information from irrelevant
and unreliable information. However to the extent that stock market gains lead investors to seek
information, the information obtained is likely to increase the illusion of control and the extent
of investing.The resulting investment will help to perpetuate the share price rises and thereby the
psychological biases.
In addition to the outcome sequence, Presson and Benassi (1996) showed that choice, task
familiarity, information, and active involvement foster the illusion of control. Barber and Odean
(2002) pointed out that online investors tend to experience these attributes. In particular they
make choices, become familiar with the process of trading, and have access to large amounts of
information.The implication is that the development of online trading is likely to enhance the
illusion of control,and hence any market instability to which the illusion of control might contribute.
At the time of writing, the most recent bubble was in technology stocks. During 1999 and up
to March 2000 such stocks rose dramatically in price.Novice investors piled in either through direct
share purchases or via unit trusts specialising in technology stocks. Many people came to believe
that they could make a living out of trading shares (as ‘day traders’). It seemed that some people
even believed that their proﬁts were due to their investment skills (typically people with no prior
knowledge of investment or ﬁnancial markets).
Familiarity and Celebrity Stocks
Best (2005) investigated the Internet stock bubble, which occurred in the late 1990s and burst in
2000. One conclusion was that Internet stocks acquired a form of celebrity status.Their prices
exceeded fundamental value just as the earnings of celebrities appear to surpass the talent of the
individuals concerned.Just as the perception of celebrities has an emotional dimension,investors
in Internet stocks were seen as having an emotional attachment to them.Just as the media promotes
celebrities, and the cult of celebrity, the media promoted Internet investing and a culture of
Internet investing.
Part of the reasoning of the analysis provided by Best is similar to the familiarity bias of
behavioural ﬁnance.The familiarity bias leads people to prefer to invest in things they think they
know and understand. At the time of the Internet stock bubble large numbers of people were
beginning to use the Internet,which therefore felt familiar to them.The Internet was new,exciting
and appeared to offer huge potential. It is possible that Internet stocks, by association with the
Internet itself, came to be seen as exciting investments with huge potential.
Arguably an Internet culture was emerging,wherein the Internet came to be seen as symbolic
of a new age: the information age.A social mood emerged amongst Internet enthusiasts. People
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
551

who identiﬁed with the information age saw use of the Internet as an expression of their
personalities; they saw themselves as part of the new era. Investment in Internet stocks was an
extension of their personal attachment to the internet.This parallels celebrity cults.The celebrities
with whom a person identiﬁes become part of that person’s perception of self.To a fan,a celebrity
is more than an actor or singer.To many buyers of internet stocks, the shares were more than
ﬁnancial investments.Another comparison might be with supporters of a football team;supporters
identify with the team and have an emotional attachment such that association with the team helps
to describe them as individuals. Behavioural ﬁnance has identiﬁed both familiarity and emotional
involvement with particular investments as inﬂuences on ﬁnancial decision-making.It seems likely
that these factors were inﬂuential during the internet stock bubble of the late 1990s.
Best (2005) emphasised the role of the media in talking up the prices of internet stocks, and
the creation of celebrity status for such stocks. Shiller (2000) argued that the media had become
more involved in reporting stock market news,and in generating an investment culture.In doing
so the media has made the subject of investment more entertaining and exciting to many people.
An investment culture has been promoted,with investment being seen as part of a lifestyle option.
Within this context it is not surprising that the media focused attention on internet stocks since
such stocks offered excitement and glamour.The media became part of the process of generating
the internet stock price bubble (Lovink 2002).The media played an important role in the creation
of the celebrity status of internet stocks, just as the media plays an important role in the creation
of celebrity status for people.
INVESTOR OVERREACTION
Empirical evidence on investor overreaction over some time periods is consistent with these ideas
from behavioural ﬁnance. DeBondt and Thaler (1985) found that stocks with very poor returns
over a three-year period subsequently outperformed those with the highest returns.A portfolio
comprising the 35 biggest losers earned a cumulative return 25% higher than the portfolio of the
35 biggest winners over the subsequent three years.This may be the result of investor overreaction
during the ﬁrst three years.
This may be because of an extrapolation of news. Suppose that a company announces good
news over the initial three years, such as proﬁts that are repeatedly above expectations. It may be
that investors come to expect more good news in the future and become excessively optimistic
about the company’s prospects.The stock price is driven up and the stock becomes a winner.
However good news in the past is not an indicator of good news in the future, and as the
expectations about the future prospects of the company shed the rosy bias of the extrapolation
the stock price will move back down towards a more realistic level.The converse could be true of
the effects of a run of bad news.
This phenomenon could take hold at the general market level. By early 2003 world stock
markets had fallen over the previous three years.This may in part have been the result of an
extrapolation of bad news.A sequence of negative news had occurred:the dot.com bubble burst;
the global economy went into recession;corporate proﬁts fell;terrorism escalated on September
11th, 2001; corporate scandals emerged from Enron,Worldcom, and Arthur Anderson; the
likelihood of another Gulf war appeared;and the consequent general fall in share prices was another
form of bad news.Investors’reactions may have been to expect the ﬂow of bad news to continue.
If the extrapolation of bad news was an incorrect reaction, stock prices at the beginning of 2003
MARKET EFFICIENCY
552

were reﬂecting too much negative news and should have shown an upward movement if the ﬂow
of negative news ceased. It is also to be noted that not all of the recent news had been negative,
for example interest rates had fallen substantially over the previous two years. Conﬁrmation bias
may have caused investors to ignore, or at least give too little weight to, such positive news.
Another explanation of overreaction is in terms of the retrievability (availability/recency) bias.
People have a tendency to overweight recent information.When new information relevant to the
price of an asset becomes available investors give disproportionate weight to this recent news
relative to existing information. So they overreact to the new information. Subsequently, as the
news becomes older, the weight attached to it declines. In consequence prices tend to move back
to some extent. DeBondt and Thaler (1990) found that this psychological bias, and the resultant
overreaction,occurs amongst professional security analysts (and institutional investors) as well as
individual investors.
Mood affects investment behaviour (Baker and Nofsinger 2002; Nofsinger 2002). It has been
suggested that good moods make people less critical. Good moods can lead to decisions that lack
detailed analysis. Determinants of mood include weather, and the number of hours of daylight.
Research by Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) and by Kamstra et al. (2003) has indicated that these
factors affect investment behaviour.Good weather,and long hours of sunlight,appears to encourage
net buying and market rises.Nofsinger (2002b) has suggested an optimism bias.Optimism reduces
critical analysis during the investment process,and it causes investors to ignore negative information.
One factor that can affect mood,and the level of optimism,is the recent performance of stock
markets.A market rise is likely to improve the mood of investors, and their degree of optimism.
A positive feedback cycle could emerge. Price rises improve mood and increase optimism. In
consequence there are net purchases, so prices rise.These price rises positively affect mood and
optimism. Such a positive feedback cycle could contribute to the development of a bubble.
Conversely a downward vicious circle could arise with falling prices, worsening moods, and
declining optimism.
THE CRASH
The bubble phase leads to share prices reaching unrealistic levels.These are share price levels far
in excess of what can be justiﬁed by fundamental analyses using dividend discount models or price-
earnings ratios (see Chapters 19 and 21 on dividend discount models and ratio analysis,
respectively).Indeed one feature of bubbles,identiﬁed by Kindleberger (1989),is the emergence
of ‘new age’ theories. New age theories are ad hoc theories that seek to justify why prices should
be far in excess of what conventional share valuation models suggest.
There may then be an occurrence that causes prices to fall rapidly. One such occurrence might
be the emergence of new companies.The new companies compete with existing ones and push down
their proﬁts.Also when the new companies ﬂoat on the stock market,the additional supply of shares
will help to depress share prices.Towards the end of the 1999–2000 technology stock bubble many
new companies were issuing shares.This increased supply of shares overtook the growth in demand
for shares.The result was that the prices of shares in the technology sector began to fall.
Rising interest rates could be another occurrence that leads to falling share prices. Bubbles
often involve people borrowing money in order to buy shares. High interest rates could cause
investors to sell shares in order to pay the interest.Such sales could set off a crash.In Japan in 1990
interest rates rose sharply.This was followed by collapses in the prices of both shares and property.
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
553

Rising interest rates can also reduce the demand for shares by making alternatives such as bank
deposits more attractive.Higher interest rates also reduce expenditure on goods and services and
thereby lower corporate proﬁts. Lower expected proﬁts can cause a fall in share prices.
Other factors that can precipitate share price collapses include share sales resulting from
negative statements by people who are looked upon as experts.These may be genuine experts such
as governors of central banks,or self-appointed experts such as newspaper gurus.Also prospective
investors may stop buying because they deplete their sources of money.The ﬂow of new investors
on to the market will eventually stop.These factors can start a crash by increasing sales of shares
and decreasing purchases.Cassidy (2002) suggested that a crash could be precipitated by a random
event, or have no apparent catalyst, if stock prices have reached sufﬁciently unrealistic levels.
To the extent that shares are bought with borrowed money (leveraged buying), stock market
crashes can cause banking crises. If investors are unable to repay their debts, banks may become
bankrupt.This could result in depositors losing their money.The effects of leveraged buying
worsened the 1929 stock market crash in the United States.That crash was also followed by a
banking crisis in which banks failed and depositors lost money. Figure 27.1 illustrates the vicious
circle that can emerge when shares are used as collateral against borrowing.
POST-KEYNESIAN PERSPECTIVES ON STOCK
MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
There has been a tendency for central banks to inject large amounts of money (usually referred to
as liquidity) into the ﬁnancial system following a crash.This may be to avert a banking crisis and
may be for the purpose of stabilising the stock market.Some of that additional liquidity would be
used for the purchase of shares,and would therefore slow or reverse the downward movement of
share prices.Since this is equivalent to giving the stock market a put option,which gives protection
against price falls,it has sometimes been called the Greenspan put (named after a past head of the
US Federal Reserve,Alan Greenspan).

Raines et al. (2007) highlighted the asymmetry involved.They pointed out that central banks
take action to soften crashes but take no action to weaken bubbles.The monetary authorities behave
as if they believe that markets are efﬁcient during bubbles but inefﬁcient during crashes.Raines et
al. supported this interpretation of central bank behaviour by making a number of references to
the writings and speeches of Alan Greenspan. Such actions by monetary authorities lessen stock
market risk, and could therefore serve to give an upward bias to stock prices.
The discussion of stock market bubbles and crashes in terms of social and psychological factors
seems to be broadly consistent with the post-Keynesian interpretation, which is particularly
associated with Galbraith (for example Galbraith 1988).Galbraith has focused on social mood and
excessive optimism,with the latter often manifesting itself as a belief that the stock market offers a
means to ‘get rich quick’.Stock market speculation is seen as most likely to occur after a period of
prosperity,which has allowed the accumulation of a substantial amount of savings.Those savings are
available for investment.The facility of borrowing in order to enhance the level of stockholding also
strengthens the conditions for the development of a bubble.The role of the accumulation of money
(liquidity) available for investment is a factor emphasised in both the post-Keynesian and monetarist
traditions.The monetarist view gives the money supply the central role in the explanation of bubbles
and crashes.The liquidity theory of asset prices could be seen as being in the monetarist tradition.
BUYING ON MARGIN AND THE LIQUIDITY THEORY OF ASSET PRICES
A feature of bubbles is that share purchases are often ﬁnanced with borrowed money.This is
sometimes referred to as buying on margin, or leveraged buying. Shares are used as collateral for
loans taken out for their purchase.There can be a circular process that entails rising share prices.
This circular process is illustrated by Figure 27.2.
Pepper and Oliver (2006) have proposed the liquidity theory of asset prices.Their suggestion
is that a major driver of stock markets is the amount of liquidity available for investment.In other
words if people have more money to invest they will invest more and thereby push up share prices.
Money is created when loans are made. So the act of ﬁnancing share purchases with borrowed
money increases the money supply (liquidity).The sellers of the shares then have money available
for investment,and may use the money for the purchase of other shares thereby pushing share prices
up.The people who sell those shares will receive money, some of which will be used for share
purchases.This process can continue through a number of rounds, and at each round share prices
are pushed up.The cumulative increase in expenditure on shares can be estimated by means of a
multiplier equation:
I  E  [1/(1  k)]
where I is the cumulative increase in spending on shares, E is the initial expenditure on shares,
and k is the proportion of receipts from sales of shares that is invested in other shares.A high rate
of reinvestment (a high level of k) produces a large multiplier effect and a large cumulative
expenditure on shares (a large I).There would be strong upward pressure on share prices.It should
be borne in mind that decreases in liquidity can occur with consequent downward multiplier effects.
Congdon (2006) demonstrated that institutional investors (life assurance and pensions) have a
fairly stable demand for liquidity in the sense of the ratio of liquid assets to other assets. If the
institutional investors experience a change in liquidity that moves the liquidity ratio away from the
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
555

desired level,they will attempt to restore the desired ratio.Money is a form of liquidity.An increase
in the money supply could disturb the liquidity ratio of institutional investors.The institutions
attempt to restore their liquidity ratios to the desired values by spending the surplus liquidity on
assets such as shares.This would drive share prices up. So long as the holding of liquidity exceeds
the desired amount investment spending will continue. To the extent that each institution’s
expenditure is another institution’s receipt of money,the attempt by each institution to reduce its
holding of liquidity does not reduce the aggregate holding of liquidity by institutions.
Some of the additional money will be lost to the institutions, for example to individual
shareholders who sell to institutions,but much will remain with the institutions.If the institutions
hold a high proportion of the total value of shares,most of the additional money may remain with
the institutions.The desired ratio of liquidity to other assets is restored by a rise in share prices.
Suppose that institutional investors, in aggregate, hold £1,000 billion of shares.Also suppose
that, on average, the institutions desire to hold liquid assets equal to 4% of non-liquid assets.
Together they require £40 billion of liquid assets to match the shareholdings. If they receive
additional money of £30 billion,they would have a liquid assets ratio of 7%.In aggregate they would
not rid themselves of the surplus £30 billion, since the institutions would tend to pass the money
between themselves as shares are bought from each other. Some of the money, say £10 million,
would be lost to the institutions.This would reduce the aggregate holding of liquidity to 6% of the
original value of shares.The institutions would still have £60 billion of liquid assets.
The desired ratio of liquid assets to shareholdings is restored by a rise in share prices.Share prices
would rise until the desired ratio is restored. So long as the actual ratio exceeds the desired ratio
spending on shares would continue, as would the resulting rise in share prices. Prices would rise
until the total value of shares reached £1,500 billion.The liquidity ratio of 4% would then have
been restored (£60 billion of liquid assets against £1,500 billion of shares).An initial £30 billion
increase in the money held by the institutions leads to a £500 billion increase in the aggregate
value of shares held by the institutions.This £500 billion increase results from a 50% rise in share
prices.An initial reduction in liquidity would generate falling prices.

The amount of liquidity lost to the institutions in this process would be low if the institutions
held a high proportion of the available shares.A low loss would entail a high rise in share prices.
For example if all of the £30 billion increase in the money supply remained with institutional
investors,the aggregate value of shares would need to rise to £1,750 billion.The institutions would
have liquidity amounting to £70 billion (the original £40 billion plus the new £30 billion) and the
restoration of a 4% liquidity ratio would require share prices to rise until the total value of shares
reached £1,750 billion. Share prices would rise by 75%.
TYPES OF TRADE
Pepper and Oliver (2006) have suggested that stock market trades can be divided into portfolio
trades and liquidity trades.They subdivide portfolio trades into information trades and price trades.
Portfolio trades are concerned with improving the prospective risk/return characteristics of
a portfolio.They may entail selling some shares and buying others, or switching between asset
classes such as between cash and shares or between bonds and shares. Information trades are
responses to news that has implications for share prices. Price trades are responses to price
movements that are not justiﬁed by new information. Portfolio trades tend to ensure that share
prices are efﬁcient in the sense of accurately reﬂecting all relevant information.
Liquidity trades occur because investors have money to invest, or need to sell investments in
order to raise money. Pepper and Oliver (2006) suggest that a major reason for liquidity trades is
monetary imbalance in the sense of inequality between the demand for, and supply of, money. If
people ﬁnd that they are holding more money than they want, they may spend part of the surplus
money on investments (shares, bonds, property). If they have less money than they need,
investments may be sold in order to restore money holdings to the desired level. In these ways
changes in the rate of increase of the money supply can affect share prices.Liquidity and portfolio
trades are depicted in Figure 27.3.
Pepper and Oliver (2006) suggest that liquidity trades move the prices of shares (and
other assets) away from their efﬁcient levels so that prices no longer accurately reﬂect all
available information. Price trades move prices back towards their efﬁcient levels. Underpriced
assets are bought, thereby pushing up their prices. Overpriced assets are sold, thereby pushing
their prices down. Pepper and Oliver suggest that the volume of price trades is normally
sufﬁcient to restore prices to their efﬁcient levels following disturbances arising from monetary
imbalance.

Arguably this division of types of trade is incomplete. One omission is noise trading.This is
trading based on irrationality, including trading based on irrelevant information or psychological
biases. Figure 27.4 includes noise trading.
Noise trades might be regarded as irrational trades on an individual basis. Individuals may be
affected by psychological biases such as the biases that lead to self-deception.Noise trading causes
deviations of share prices from the efﬁcient prices.Sometimes prices are above,sometimes below,
dependent upon whether noise traders are net buyers or net sellers.The resulting movement of
share prices around their efﬁcient levels is noise. It may be that the prospective volume of price
trades is sufﬁcient to keep the level of noise to a low level. In other words price trading may be
sufﬁcient to prevent deviations from efﬁcient prices becoming large.
Irrational trading is not always at an individual level. If investors operate as a crowd, herding
can result.There can be synchronisation of investment behaviour.The irrational investors might
be overwhelmingly buyers or overwhelmingly sellers.The result is powerful upward or downward
pressures on markets. Price trades may be insufﬁcient to offset the effects of herding with the
result that there is a bubble or crash in share (or bond,or property) prices.Figure 27.5 adds herd
trading to the diagram.
There may be another division to be made. Monetary imbalance is not the only source of
liquidity trades. People save money and some of that saved money is invested. Savings provide a
source of expenditure on investments. Net saving in an economy would tend to push up share
prices. If the issue of new shares fails to keep pace with savings available for investment in shares,
the result would be an increase in share prices.It is questionable whether price trades would offset
a long-term accumulation of savings.Figure 27.6 includes net saving as a source of liquidity trades.

The portfolio trades tend to maintain market efﬁciency whereas the liquidity and irrational
trades tend to disturb market efﬁciency.The maintenance of efﬁciency depends upon the relative
power of these forces. In the case of long-term saving, a long-term upward trend in share prices
and property prices (and fall in bond yields) might be expected if the cumulative level of net saving
exceeds the cumulative issue of shares and bonds plus the cumulative construction of property.
MONETARY IMBALANCE AND EXTRAPOLATIVE EXPECTATIONS
Pepper and Oliver (2006) suggest that, if monetary imbalance persists in one direction for a long
period,extrapolative expectations can result.By extrapolative expectations is meant the tendency
to expect that price changes will continue in the direction recently observed. Extrapolative
expectations lead to momentum (positive feedback) trading with the effect that a price movement
continues in a particular direction.The psychological bias of representativeness helps to explain
the emergence of extrapolative expectations. If extrapolative expectations are widespread the
result is herd trading, and herd trading can overwhelm any tendency for price trades to restore
‘efﬁcient’ prices.
Price traders could become part of the momentum trading process.Maximising returns entails
following prices upwards until they peak.Selling too soon causes a loss of potential proﬁts.This is
the idea of rational bubbles,or the greater fool theory.It makes sense to buy overpriced investments
if you expect that a greater fool will later buy at an even higher price.Rather than moderating price
rises, price traders may accentuate the rises.
According to Pepper and Oliver (2006), a long period of rising prices is associated with an
accumulation of investors who need to sell (since their holdings of money are less than the desired
levels). Such investors may delay asset sales while prices continue to rise. A continuing rise in
prices is likely to attract speculative investors who do not plan to hold the investments for the long
term; Pepper and Oliver refer to their investments as being loosely held.A long period of rising
prices would lead to many investors needing to sell shares in order to raise money for other
purposes, and to many speculators with loosely held shares.When the expectation of price rises
disappears, both groups of investors will sell. Share prices fall sharply.

STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES

The role of momentum in the development of the bubble was particularly signiﬁcant according
to Boswijk et al. (2007). They divided investors into two groups. One group comprised
fundamentalists who believed in the mean reversion of stock prices towards a true (fundamental)
value such that deviations from true values would be corrected.The other group consisted of trend
followers who believed that a direction of price movement would continue.The proportions of
investors in the two groups vary over time.The researchers found that in the late 1990s almost all
investors were trend following, and that the dominance of trend followers persisted for several
years.This is consistent with strong momentum in the formation of the bubble.The studies by Best
(2005) and by Muga and Santamaria (2007) indicated that high-technology (including dot.com)
stocks were particularly susceptible to momentum trading (trend following).
PORTFOLIO INSURANCE
Portfolio insurance refers to the attempt to hedge a portfolio by simulating a put option.The
purchase of a put option will provide the holder of the option with proﬁts when stock prices fall.
The decline in the value of a portfolio of stocks would be (at least partially) offset by proﬁts from
the option.The nature of a put option is such that the compensation for incremental falls becomes
greater as the cumulative decline increases.Initially only a small part of the loss is covered,but after
substantial falls the majority of any further falls are matched by gains on the option.Effectively the
put option progressively reduces the exposure of the portfolio to the market as stock prices fall.
The same effect can be achieved by gradually selling stocks in response to falling stock prices
with the effect that the exposure to the stock market is progressively reduced.This process is
known as portfolio insurance, or dynamic hedging.
One effect of portfolio insurance is that falls in stock prices lead to sales of shares.Those sales
cause further falls in the market and hence more sales. A vicious circle can develop. Price falls
stimulate sales, which cause further price falls.This process can increase the intensity of a market
decline, and possibly cause a crash.
In the presence of portfolio insurance, market rises can be reinforced. Price rises stimulate
share purchases and hence further price rises.A virtuous circle can develop.Rising prices encourage
purchases,which further increase prices and hence yet more purchases.This process can contribute
to the development of a stock price bubble.
RESEARCH USING EXPERIMENTAL MARKETS
Laboratory experiments have been used to throw light on the development of bubbles and crashes,
and in particular on whether they are based on ‘rational’ fundamental factors or ‘irrational’
behavioural factors. One problem with attempts to resolve this issue is that fundamental values
(for example based on dividend discount models) are not observable in real market environments.
Laboratory markets have the advantage of providing unambiguous fundamental values.The results
of laboratory experiments,in which fundamental values are observable,might provide insights into
analogous real-world markets.
Caginalp et al. (2000) surveyed results from laboratory experiments on stock trading. One
study, whose results were typical, provided participants with a share whose fair (i.e. true) price
was very easy to calculate on the basis of a dividend discount model.Participants were then asked

to trade the shares over two hours, which were divided into a total of 15 periods. Demand and
supply were matched in each period.
Although the share had an unambiguous value in each period, based on future cash ﬂows, the
price at which it traded deviated substantially from that value.Bubbles and crashes emerged from
the trading.For example the trading of a group of business executives produced prices that varied
between 20% of fair value and 630% of that value.It appears from such experiments that deviations
of actual prices from fair, or fundamental, value can be long-lasting.
Dufwenberg et al. (2005) reported that laboratory experiments had shown that bubbles tend
to occur with inexperienced traders but not with experienced traders.The extent to which this
provides insights into the operation of real markets depends upon whether real markets are
dominated by experienced or inexperienced investors.Dufwenberg et al. conducted experiments
with mixtures of experienced and inexperienced traders.They found that bubbles were eliminated
if at least one-third of participants were experienced. Since experienced investors probably
dominate real markets,the implication is that bubbles are likely to be rare and unlikely to be caused
by the relatively small proportion of inexperienced investors.They observed that bubbles and
crashes in real markets were unusual (for example US stock markets had experienced just three
clear cases in the twentieth century).They suggested that markets might be understood as being
based on fundamentals for most of the time, with occasional lapses.
In general, the evidence from experimental trading (Caginalp et al. 2000) has indicated that
speculative bubbles are more likely to emerge where:

The proportion of inexperienced traders is high.
2.
The uncertainty about true (fair or fundamental) value is high.
3.
The investment promises a small chance of proﬁt, but that proﬁt would be very high.
4.
It is possible to ﬁnance purchases by borrowing money.
5.
Short selling is difﬁcult (i.e. it is difﬁcult to borrow shares for the purpose of selling them).
It is interesting to note how well these characteristics describe the market in high-tech shares in
the few years up to 2000.
COMPLEXITY THEORY AS AN EXPLANATION
OF BUBBLES AND CRASHES
Complexity theory comes from physics and seems to be able to explain a wide variety of natural
events. Montier (2002: 138–9) quotes Langton’s description of complexity:
From the interaction of the individual components . . . emerges some kind of global
property . . . something you couldn’t have predicted from what you know of the
component parts. And the global property, this emergent behaviour, feeds back to
inﬂuence the behaviour of the individuals . . . that produced it.
Complexity theory predicts two features of systems (referred to as complex adaptive systems).
The ﬁrst is that a power law captures the distribution of the probability of an event.A power law
may be represented by the equation:
N  1/sτ
MARKET EFFICIENCY
562

In the case of stock markets N might represent the number of stock market crashes of a
particular size and s might represent the size of the crash. It will be noted that an implication of
the power law is that small crashes are relatively frequent whilst large crashes are rare.
The other feature that is predicted by complexity theory is that a crash is preceded and followed
by periods of high volatility involving oscillations of increasing frequency and falling duration. It
is suggested that this reﬂects increasing synchronisation of investor behaviour and that the crash
results from nearly complete synchronisation (i.e.nearly all investors think and behave in the same
way).When the market is distant from the crash investors are not synchronised with the effect that
buyers and sellers tend to balance out.As the crash approaches there is increasing synchronisation
of views concerning the direction of the market.When nearly everyone takes the view that the
market will fall sellers overwhelm buyers with the result that prices fall dramatically.
Vandewaller et al. (1999) demonstrated that in the context of stock markets there is a tendency
for volatility to cluster around stock market crashes.Volatility tends to be high just before,and just
after,a crash.Johansen and Sornette (1999,2001) found that the pattern of (increasingly frequent)
oscillations is characteristic of market bottoms as well as market peaks.
Others take the opposite view about volatility.For example Olsen (1998) and Schwartz (1988)
suggested that it is divergence of opinion that leads to share price volatility.This increase in
divergence of opinion would emerge during periods characterised by increased differences in
decision-making processes.Differences in data perception,selection,weighting,and analysis lead
to variations in opinion among investors.Panchenko (2007) provided evidence that heterogeneity
in views is associated with increased volatility (also Shalen 1993).Panchenko described periods in
which investment analysts issue heterogeneous recommendations as ‘analysts’ wars’ and found
that volatility was about twice as high during such periods than in ‘peace’ periods.
Olsen (1998) suggests that standard ﬁnance theory has difﬁculty in explaining divergences of
opinion; for example the efﬁcient market hypothesis sees rational investors using all relevant
information to establish stock prices that reﬂect all relevant information.There seems to be little
scope for differences in opinion unless some investors have less information than others; in other
words asymmetric information might be the only explanation for differences in opinion offered
by standard ﬁnance theory. Behavioural ﬁnance suggests that differences in opinion are to be
expected.
If all investors were provided with exactly the same information there would be differences in
opinion about the direction of stock prices because of differences in the perception and
interpretation of the information, differences in views about the relative importance of pieces of
information, and differences concerning the appropriate way to analyse the information.
Olsen (1998) took the view that investment analysis is an example of ‘complex, ill-structured
tasks’, which are common in the social sciences. Complex, ill-structured tasks are characterised
by a lack of agreement concerning what is relevant information and how it should be analysed.The
wide variety of approaches to investment analysis is symptomatic of a complex,ill-structured task.
Experts do little better than novices when dealing with such tasks. Chapters 9, 11, 17, and 26,
which provide evidence on the performance of investment analysts and fund managers, indicate
that professional analysts and managers show little,if any,tendency to outperform passive strategies
such as index tracking.
Investment analysis, as a complex, ill-structured task, gives rise to considerable variety in
opinions, partly because of the wide variety of techniques of investment analysis. Such tasks are
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
563

also likely to be subject to the psychological biases, emotional and social inﬂuences described
in the chapters dealing with behavioural ﬁnance and the psychology of decision-making,especially
Chapters 2 and 24.Those chapters also indicate that such psychological and social factors can be
particularly important in times of great uncertainty.
Complexity theory extends observations made in the natural sciences to the explanation of the
behaviour of ﬁnancial markets. Increasing synchronisation may be an appropriate explanation of
increasing volatility in the study of inanimate matter,but the view that increasing volatility in ﬁnancial
markets arises from increasing differences rather than increasing synchronisation has intuitive
appeal.High price volatility suggests alternate episodes of net buying and net selling,which seems
more consistent with differences in opinion than with a developing uniformity of opinion.
CATASTROPHE THEORY AS AN EXPLANATION
OF CRASHES AND SURGES
Catastrophe theory has used the possibility of a backward-sloping demand curve for shares as an
explanation of stock market crashes. Figure 27.7 shows the form of demand-and-supply model
used.The curves 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are demand curves with both downward and backward sloping
sections.Good news moves the demand curve to the right,and bad news moves it to the left.The
general level of the market is represented by ‘Price’, which might be looked upon as the value of
a stock index.
Starting from demand curve 1 and price P1 (determined by the intersection of demand curve
1 with the ﬁxed supply) bad news will move the demand curve to the left.When it has moved to

Figure 27.7

the position of demand curve 2 the new price,P2 ,is determined at the point of tangency of demand
curve 2 and the supply function.Further bad news could produce demand curve 3 and a dramatic
fall in price to P3.The fall from P1 to P2 is gradual (continuous).When the demand curve moves
to the left of curve 2 the fall in price to the new intersection of demand and supply functions is
sudden (discontinuous).The jump in price from P2 to P3 constitutes a crash.
If the news then improves, the demand curve will move to the right. However a full recovery
in share prices is not achieved from a move back to demand curve 2,or even demand curve 1.Since
the crash is not easily reversible, it is referred to as a catastrophe. It is called a catastrophe
because the size of improvement of the news needed to reverse the fall is much greater than the
size of deterioration that caused the fall.Correspondingly the model is an application of catastrophe
theory.
If the news continues to improve,demand curve 4 and price P4 might be achieved.There would
be a point of tangency between the demand and supply functions.A further improvement in the
news would cause demand to exceed supply until the price has risen substantially. If the news
produces a move to demand curve 5, the result would be a sudden jump in price to P5. There is
thus a surge in share prices.The rise in price from P3 to P4 is continuous (gradual), whereas the
rise from P4 to P5 is discontinuous (there is a jump in price).
So allowing for a section of the demand curve to be backward sloping leads to the prediction
that there will be sudden (discontinuous) jumps in the general level of share prices.The question
arises as to why a section of the demand curve should be backward sloping.
Leland (1987) developed a model similar to the one described here.Leland suggested that the
backward-sloping section of the demand curve might be due to dynamic hedging (portfolio
insurance).Dynamic hedging involves investors reducing their shareholdings in response to falling
share prices (perhaps in an attempt to simulate a protective put option). So price falls lead to
reduced demand for shares.Conversely price rises cause the hedge to be unwound,which entails
buying shares.
Behavioural ﬁnance may provide explanations.The backward-sloping demand curve could be
the result of investors extrapolating recent price movements, perhaps as a result of the
representativeness bias.Recent falls are seen as indicating future falls,so investors sell in response
to falling prices.Conversely price increases raise demand for shares since they are seen as indicative
of further increases in price. These behaviour patterns are likely to be reinforced by other
psychological biases such as overconﬁdence, conservatism, and conﬁrmation bias.
Other explanations may run in terms of the use of technical analysis.Falling prices may trigger
a sell signal. If a majority of charts point to a fall in the market, there will be selling of shares. So
price falls may be the cause of a fall in demand for shares. Conversely rising prices could provide
a buy signal with the result that a price rise stimulates additional demand.
PRICE BUBBLES AND BANKING CRISES
Crashes not only hurt investors, they can also damage banks. Slumps in stock prices can be
detrimental to banks, particularly if banks have bought shares as well as lending to other buyers.
The American stock market crash of 1929, and the Japanese stock market slump of the 1990s,
involved stock price falls impacting on banks.However stock market crashes do not always severely
damage banks.
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES AND CRASHES
565

Property price slumps nearly always damage the banks.This is because property speculation is
primarily ﬁnanced with money borrowed from banks. Bubbles in property prices are typically
based on borrowing from banks. Property developers and speculators ﬁnance their purchases by
borrowing.The purchased property is used as collateral for the loans.
So long as property prices continue to rise interest payments can be made, and loans repaid.
When prices stop rising,problems appear.If interest is paid out of the proﬁts from price rises (or
from increased borrowing based on the enhanced collateral),a pause in the rises means that interest
cannot be paid. Banks may then require loans to be repaid.
The developers and speculators may then sell property in order to pay off the loans.The property
sales cause prices to fall.The fall in property prices reduces the value of the collateral.As a result
banks demand repayment of loans. More property is sold, prices fall further, collateral declines
further,and the banks demand more repayment.There is a downward spiral leading to bankruptcy
of property developers and speculators.The values of their properties fall below the values of their
debts. Such bankruptcies mean that bank loans are not fully repaid.The banks lose money.The
Japanese property market slump and banking crisis of the early 1990s involved banks being severely
weakened by such a process.
Banks lend money to each other. If one bank became bankrupt, the banks from which it had
borrowed would lose money.There could be a domino effect wherein the collapse of some banks
causes others to fail.This systemic effect could lead to a collapse of the whole banking system.
The prospect of banks failing might cause depositors to panic and attempt to withdraw
their money.If depositors rushed to withdraw their money,banks could run out of cash and hence
be unable to pay out the money.This is especially so since bank loans normally are not repayable
on demand, and so banks cannot get their money back quickly. Failure to pay depositors would
increase the sense of panic and encourage more attempts to withdraw cash. Such a run on the
banks by depositors wanting to withdraw cash would hasten the collapse of the banks. Such
behaviour by depositors was a feature of the American banking crisis that followed the Wall Street
crash of 1929.
The possibility of a run on the banks is one reason why central banks, such as the Bank of
England, act as lenders of last resort.This means that they will lend to banks in an emergency so
that banks can pay their customers. Governments also often guarantee that bank deposits will be
repaid in order to avoid the panic that leads to runs on the banks.
Even if banks do not collapse (and normally they do not), the effect of losses on their capital
can cause a credit crunch.A credit crunch is a situation in which banks stop making new loans (or
at least reduce the amount of new lending).A credit crunch may also entail the refusal to renew
many loans, with the effect that the borrowers must repay the loans when those loans reach their
maturity dates. Investors may become forced sellers if they need to sell assets in order to repay
loans.If a fund has ﬁnanced investments by means of borrowing from a bank,the refusal of the bank
to renew the lending could force the fund to sell assets.Such forced selling puts downward pressure
on asset prices and would exacerbate a crash.A credit crunch can bring about contagion between
asset markets. For example in the summer of 2007 banks reduced lending, and refused to renew
some maturing loans, because they feared that the borrowers held assets backed by sub-prime
mortgages. Many borrowers became forced sellers since they needed to sell assets in order to
repay the borrowed money.The forced selling extended to stocks and the sales of shares contributed
to sharp falls in stock markets.

CONCLUSION
Arguably the strongest evidence against the efﬁcient market hypothesis is the existence of stock
market bubbles and crashes.Whilst there is a wide variety of views about what causes, and what
drives,bubbles and crashes,few observers suggest that they are caused by new information coming

into the market.Such is the width of explanations for bubbles and crashes that some explanations
come from physics (phynance) and some from biology using models of disease contagion.Models
of contagion seem to ﬁt comfortably with the concepts of information cascades and herding as
explanations of investor behaviour during bubbles and crashes.
The concept of ‘rational bubbles’ suggests that the emergence of stock market bubbles is
consistent with rational behaviour. It may be rational for investors to buy shares that they believe
to be overpriced, so long as they expect to sell them at an even higher price. Weighing the
expectation of proﬁt against the possible loss in the event of price falls could lead to the conclusion
that prospective proﬁts outweigh possible losses (when both are weighted by probability of
occurrence). It could be rational to buy in an overpriced market.
Another mechanism that does not depend on irrational behaviour is portfolio insurance.During
the 1987 stock market crash some institutional investors simulated the purchase of put options.
This simulation involved selling stock as the market fell, thereby reinforcing the downward
movement in prices.
Behavioural ﬁnance suggests that the occurrence of stock market bubbles and crashes stems from
irrational behaviour on the part of investors.The concept of positive feedback trading,reinforced
by the representativeness bias,seems to provide a driving force that causes stock market prices to
overreact. Laboratory experiments have shown that bubbles and crashes tend to emerge from
trading behaviour, particularly in the presence of relatively naive investors.
Another possible driving force comes from money supply changes.A bubble could be generated
by a rapid growth in money supply.The additional money is partially spent on assets such as shares
and property,thereby producing asset price inﬂation in stock and property markets.The effect of
money supply changes could then interact with positive feedback trading (based on extrapolative
expectations) reinforced by representativeness.
A catastrophe is an event which whilst caused by a minor occurrence is not remedied by a
reversal of the minor occurrence.The application of catastrophe theory to the explanation of stock
market bubbles and crashes requires the demand curve for shares to have a backward-bending
section.A backward-bending section could be explained in terms of either portfolio insurance or
behavioural ﬁnance.

Stock Index Futures


Chapter 28
Stock index futures
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Financial futures.
2. Hedging, speculation, and arbitrage with futures.
3. The margin system and closing out.
4. Futures funds.
5. The relative merits of using futures and stocks for achieving investment objectives.
6. Contracts for Difference (CFDs).
7. Equity swaps.
FINANCIAL FUTURES
A ﬁnancial future is a notional commitment to buy or sell, on a speciﬁed future date, a standard
quantity of a ﬁnancial instrument at a price determined in the present (the futures price).It is rare
for a futures contract to be used for the exchange of ﬁnancial instruments.Indeed many contracts,
including stock index futures,have no facility for the exchange of the ﬁnancial instrument.Instead,
ﬁnancial futures markets are independent of the underlying cash markets,albeit operating parallel
to those markets.
The main economic function of futures is to provide a means of hedging. A hedger seeks to
reduce an already existing risk.This risk reduction could be achieved by taking a futures position
that would tend to show a proﬁt in the event of a loss on the underlying position (and a loss in the
case of a proﬁt on the underlying position).
Positions in futures markets can be taken much more quickly and much more cheaply (in terms
of transaction costs) than positions in the underlying spot markets.For example a position in stock
index futures can be established within a few minutes (from the time of the decision) at little cost
in terms of commissions and bid-ask spreads.The construction of a balanced portfolio of stocks
would take much longer and would be more costly in terms of commissions and spreads.For these
571

reasons,futures markets tend to be more efﬁcient than the underlying spot markets;futures prices
respond to new information more quickly.Hence futures have a second economic function,which
might be termed price discovery.Futures prices may be indicative of what prices should be in the
markets for the underlying instruments.This price discovery function is particularly important
where the underlying spot market is poorly developed or illiquid, as in countries with poorly
developed ﬁnancial systems or for instruments that are not frequently traded.
Example of Hedging with Futures
The FTSE 100 Index stands at 6,000 on 14 February and a fund manager expects to receive
£900,000 on 15 March.The intention is to invest that money immediately in a balanced portfolio
of shares.The fund manager fears that share prices will rise by 15 March,meaning that fewer shares
can be bought with the £900,000. Since the risk is that share prices will increase, the requisite
futures position is one that would proﬁt from a rise in share prices.Stock index futures are bought.
A FTSE 100 futures contract relates to a value of stock equal to the futures index multiplied by
£10. So, if the futures index were 6,000, each futures contract would relate to 6,000  £10 
£60,000 worth of shares.Hedging a purchase of £900,000 of stock (at 14 February prices) requires
the purchase of 15 FTSE 100 futures contracts.
Suppose that the index rises by 600 points by 15 March.The quantity of stock that could have
been bought for £900,000 on 14 February now costs £990,000.This could be regarded as a loss
of £90,000. However, if the futures FTSE 100 Index also were to rise by 600 points, there would
be a futures proﬁt of £90,000.
600 index points  £10 per point  15 contracts  £90,000
The futures proﬁt, when added to the £900,000, provides the £990,000 required to buy the
quantity of stock that £900,000 would have bought on 14 February.
SPECULATION AND ARBITRAGE
In addition to hedgers, ﬁnancial markets also have speculators and arbitragers. Speculators are
traders who buy and sell in order to make proﬁts from positions held for short periods of time.
Speculators buy and sell futures simply to make proﬁt, not to reduce risk.They believe that they
have better information than other market participants concerning the appropriate price.Futures
are very attractive to speculators because of the gearing provided.Traders need only make margin
payments and hence can take positions for a cash outlay that is only a small fraction of the value of
the positions.
If a speculator believes that something is overpriced the decision will be to sell, whereas
perceived underpricing will result in buying.Speculators operate on the basis that the market will
quickly correct any mispricing.The aim is to take positions earlier than other market participants
with a view to making proﬁts when the others trade.The trades of the others would push prices
towards their new levels. If the new price is consistent with the speculator’s expectation, a proﬁt
is realised. A variety of views will lead to two-way trading by speculators with the result that
market liquidity is enhanced. Frequently, speculative trades heavily outnumber hedging trades.
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
572

Speculators are vital to futures markets.They facilitate hedging,provide liquidity,tend to ensure
accurate pricing,and can help to maintain price stability.It is unlikely that hedgers wishing to buy
futures will precisely match hedgers selling futures in terms of numbers of contracts. If hedgers
are net sellers, there will be a tendency for futures prices to fall and that may generate proﬁt
opportunities for speculators.Speculators will buy the underpriced futures (the situation in which
hedgers are net sellers and hence futures are underpriced is sometimes referred to as ‘normal
backwardation’).The purchases by speculators will allow the net sales on the part of the hedgers.
In effect,speculators ﬁll the gap between sales and purchases by hedgers.In so doing,they tend to
maintain price stability since they will buy into a falling market, and sell into a rising one (in the
event of hedgers being net buyers). If hedgers are net buyers, with the result that futures are
overpriced, the situation is sometimes called ‘contango’. Contango entails speculators selling
futures.
A liquid market is one in which there is considerable buying and selling on a continuous basis.
In a liquid market, hedgers can make their transactions with ease and with little effect on prices.
Speculative transactions add to market liquidity. In the absence of speculators, hedgers may have
difﬁculty in ﬁnding counterparties with whom to trade and they may need to move prices in order
to entice counterparties.
Speculators also help to make a market informationally efﬁcient.A market is informationally
efﬁcient when prices fully reﬂect all available relevant information. Speculators are likely to
consider all relevant information when deciding upon the appropriate price of a futures contract.
If actual prices differ from those judged appropriate, they will be brought into line with the
estimated prices by speculative trades; underpriced futures will be bought (and so their prices
will tend to rise), while overpriced futures will be sold until their prices have fallen to the level
considered correct.
Some have taken the view that since futures provide a means of low cost speculation,a resulting
increase in speculation would increase stock market volatility. Others point to the role of futures
in conveying new information to markets, and in transferring speculation from the stock market
to the futures market.These latter points are used to suggest that futures trading is more likely to
reduce,rather than increase,stock market volatility.A number of researchers have investigated the
impact of the introduction of futures on stock market volatility. Rahman (2001) investigated the
effect of the introduction of futures based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average,looking at the three-
month periods immediately preceding and following the introduction of those futures in 1997.It
was found that the introduction of the futures had no effect on the price volatility of the stocks
covered by the index.McKenzie et al. (2001) examined the impact of the introduction of individual
share futures in Australia on the price volatility of the underlying shares.They found that in most
cases the introduction of the futures resulted in a reduction of price volatility.
In addition to hedgers and speculators,there is a third category of trader known as arbitragers.
Arbitragers also help to make markets liquid,ensure accurate pricing and enhance price stability.
Arbitrage involves making proﬁts from relative mispricing.Futures prices should bear a consistent
relationship to stock prices. If this relationship is violated, an arbitrage opportunity may arise. If
the futures price were too high relative to the stock prices, arbitragers could make a proﬁt by
simultaneously buying stocks and selling futures. Such trades will tend to restore the appropriate
relationship between stock prices and futures prices (by raising stock prices and reducing futures
prices).
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
573

THE MARGIN SYSTEM
The margin system is central to futures markets.There are three types of margin: initial margin,
maintenance margin, and variation margin.The initial margin is a sum of money to be provided
by both the buyer and the seller of a futures contract when they make their transaction; it is a
deposit that is returned when the contract expires or is closed out.This margin is a small percentage
of the face value of the contract (perhaps 5%).The initial margin is subject to variation (by a
clearing house) and will depend on the volatility of the stock market.One function of initial margin
is the provision of market discipline.The payment of initial margin may deter poorly capitalised
speculators from entering the market.
Whereas initial margin is the sum to be initially deposited (with a clearing house), the
maintenance margin is the sum that must remain deposited while the futures position is held.
Initial and maintenance margins are frequently identical in value.Initial and maintenance margins
could be in the form of money (which may earn interest) or other securities (which continue to
provide a yield to the holder of the futures position).The margin will be drawn upon (by the
clearing house) in the event of the holder of a futures position failing to make a variation margin
payment.
Variation margin is payable and receivable on a daily basis.It reﬂects the proﬁt or loss made from
a futures contract during the course of a day. If the futures price moves to the holder’s advantage,
the holder will receive variation margin; if the futures price moves adversely, a payment must be
made.This process of realising proﬁts and losses on a daily basis is known as marking to market.If
a contract holder fails to make a variation margin payment, the contract will be automatically
closed out and the outstanding sum deducted from the maintenance margin (which is set at a level
that is expected to exceed any likely variation margin call).
When a futures deal is agreed between a buyer and a seller,a clearing house takes over the role
of counterparty to both buyer and seller.So,although buyer A bought from seller B,once the deal
is registered the clearing house becomes the seller to buyer A and the buyer from seller B. An
implication of this is that there is no need to investigate the creditworthiness of the person or
entity with whom a deal is made (the need for such investigation could slow up futures dealing
and undermine market efﬁciency). All default risk is taken by the clearing house.The clearing
house protects itself from counterparty default risk by means of the variation and maintenance
margins.Marking to market (the daily settlement of proﬁts and losses) prevents the accumulation
of counterparty debt and the maintenance margin is a source from which one day’s outstanding
variation margin payment can be drawn. If a trader fails to pay variation margin on a day, their
futures contracts are closed out by the exchange and the variation margin payment taken from their
maintenance margin.The remainder of the maintenance margin is then returned to the trader.
Another implication of the margin system is that futures are highly geared investments.For example
an initial margin of 5% of the value of the underlying stock means that the exposure acquired is
20 times the initial money outlay.
CLOSING OUT
The majority of futures contracts are closed out before they mature.There are typically only four
maturity dates each year, and it is unlikely that the needs of futures users will coincide with one
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
574

of those four dates (for many futures contracts there are maturity dates in March,June,September,
and December). Closing out involves taking a futures position opposite to the original position.
If a trader opened a position by buying a contract with a March maturity date, the trader could
close out the position by selling a March futures contract; likewise, a trader with a short position
(futures sold) could close it out by buying futures with the same maturity date.When futures
contracts are closed out, the trader is left with no futures position; the purchases and sales cancel
each other.
The closing transaction will typically not be with the same counterparty as the opening
transaction;but,none the less,the transactions will cancel out,leaving the trader with no remaining
futures position.This is because of the counterparty role of the clearing house.As soon as a futures
trade is agreed, the clearing house becomes the counterparty to both buyer and seller. It is as if
the buyer has bought from the clearing house and the seller sold to the clearing house. So when a
closing out transaction occurs, the trader is left with identical long (bought) and short (sold)
positions with the clearing house and the clearing house deems these to cancel each other out.
FUTURES FUNDS
Futures funds are structured investments that operate by means of keeping most of their assets in
a liquid form such as short-term bank deposits,while the remainder is used to ﬁnance the margin
requirements of futures trading. Proﬁts and losses from stock market movements come from
futures rather than from holding shares.The futures may relate to a sum of securities equal to the
value of the fund,but not necessarily.Futures provide the ﬂexibility to gain exposure to a quantity
of assets in excess of the value of the fund,or to take a short position in the underlying investment.
The gearing offered by futures provides an opportunity for futures funds to be highly geared.The
market exposure of a futures fund might be several times the value of the fund. Obviously, such
highly geared funds are very risky.
Futures funds are not always limited to stock index futures.They may contain a wide variety of
futures contracts. Multi-sector funds would contain not only a range of ﬁnancial futures, but also
commodity futures. Furthermore, the contracts could derive from exchanges in a number of
different countries.Such diversiﬁcation helps to reduce the risk of the futures funds.Commodity
futures may be particularly attractive to fund managers since they are likely to exhibit little or no
correlation with the assets (such as stocks and bonds) that constitute the major part of investment
portfolios.An asset that has low correlation with the other elements of a portfolio will tend to
reduce the risk of the portfolio. Losses on some types of asset may be offset by proﬁts on assets
from other markets.
Trading on market movements can normally be achieved more quickly and cheaply by using
futures than by using spot instruments such as shares and bonds. Futures bid-offer spreads and
commissions are often much lower than in the spot markets and time need not be spent on deciding
between speciﬁc securities. It follows that a fund that is likely to shift frequently between asset
classes (e.g. between shares and bonds) would beneﬁt from the use of futures rather than spot
market instruments.
Futures allow quick and cheap movement not only between classes of asset, such as between
shares and bonds,but also between national markets.The time and expense of researching foreign
stocks can be avoided by using stock index futures relating to the foreign stock markets.

Furthermore, only margin payments are subject to currency exposure (exchange rate risk); the
bulk of the fund can remain in the home currency.

CONTRACTS FOR DIFFERENCE AND 130/30 FUNDS
An instrument that has similarities with a futures contract is a contract for difference (CFD).
Frequently it relates to a particular stock (in the UK a CFD contract relates to 1,000 shares), but
could relate to any marketable asset (or even non-marketable instruments such as stock indices).
CFD contracts do not have ﬁxed expiry dates and can be closed at any time.A CFD is a deal between
an investor and a broker.The investor is expected to pay a deposit (typically 10% of the value of
the shareholding to which the CFD relates). If losses are made the broker takes cash from the
deposit (margin) and the investor is required to provide more cash in order to maintain the value
of the deposit at 10%. If the position makes a proﬁt, the investor receives cash.
An investor who takes a long position in a CFD relating to a share would proﬁt from a share
price rise, and lose in the event of a share price fall.The proﬁts or losses would be calculated by
reference to a speciﬁed share price (typically slightly above the share price when the contract was
entered into;the offer price of the share might be used).If the share price were above the speciﬁed
price, there would be a proﬁt equal to the difference between the current price and the speciﬁed
price. Conversely there would be a loss equal to the extent to which the current price is below
the speciﬁed price.An investor with a long CFD is treated as if the shares are bought with borrowed

EXHIBIT 28.1
130/30 FUNDS
130/30 funds take a 100% long position in equities (shares). In addition they take a further
market-neutral position by adding a further long position matched by a short position in other
equities. In this way they take a short position in those shares about which they have a bearish
view, balanced by a long position in stocks about which they are bullish. The name 130/30 implies
that the market-neutral addition represents 30% of the basic long position (i.e. 30% of the net
value of the fund). However the chosen percentage may differ from 30%.
money (which is what the broker might do in the absence of offsetting short positions).The investor
pays interest and receives dividends.
An investor who takes a short position in a CFD proﬁts from price falls and loses from price
rises.The extent of proﬁt or loss is based on the difference between the current share price and
(typically) a share price slightly below the share price at the time that the contract was entered into
(the bid price of the share might be used).An investor with a short CFD is treated as if the shares
are sold short and the receipts are put on deposit (which is what the broker might do in the absence
of offsetting long positions).The investor receives interest and pays sums equal to the share
dividends.
Bid/offer prices might be quoted,for example,as 119p121p.The buyer of a CFD would make
a proﬁt if the share price rises above 121p.
At a share price of 136p there would be a proﬁt of (136121)  1,000  15,000p, i.e. £150.
A share price of 110p would provide a loss of (121110)  1,000  11,000p, i.e. £110.
At a share price of 110p,the seller of a CFD would proﬁt by (119110)  1,000  9,000p,i.e.
£90.
At a share price of 136p the seller of the CFD would lose (136119)  1,000  17,000p, i.e.
£170.
Potential losses are very large in the event of prices moving heavily against an investor.A stop-loss
arrangement entails automatic closure of a position in the event of a price movement beyond a
particular level. However there is a risk that the price movement is so rapid that closure occurs
only after the price has moved well beyond the chosen stop-loss price; such an occurrence is
sometimes known as gapping.
A broker providing CFDs could take corresponding positions in the share.However if a broker
has investors on both the long and short sides, the need to take positions in the share is reduced
since the cash ﬂows of long and short investors would match each other. Some concern has been
expressed that if investors use CFDs as a substitute for share purchases,liquidity is taken from the
stock market.Although brokers take offsetting positions in the stock market, liquidity is reduced
to the extent that there is matching between long and short positions.
By using CFDs investors can obtain geared investments in, or short positions on, a share (or
other instrument).An almost identical alternative is spread betting.

As a result of the European Ucits III rules, the short positions are attained by using contracts
for difference (CFDs) rather than by selling borrowed shares.
The question arises as to how a 130/30 fund differs from a hedge fund, which chooses a
strategy of a long position plus a market-neutral (hedge/arbitrage) addition. Some might regard
130/30 funds as a form of halfway house between long-only funds and hedge funds. However they
differ from hedge funds in that (1) they are relative value (e.g. relative to a stock index) rather
than absolute return funds, (2) there is less secrecy about their strategy and operation, (3) they
are more liquid in that they do not lock up investors’ money for long periods, (4) they do not charge
the very high fees often charged by hedge fund managers, and (5) their choice of strategy is more
restricted than in the case of hedge funds.
The advantage of 130/30 funds, compared to long-only funds that simply buy stocks without
taking short positions, rests on the success of the fund managers in identifying prospective
outperforming and underperforming stocks. If the managers were wrong in their judgements, the
130/30 funds would underperform long-only funds. 130/30 funds entail more active risk
(management risk), which is the risk of underperformance resulting from errors in fund
management.

EQUITY SWAPS
Equity swaps provide an alternative to futures funds as means of creating derivatives-based
investment funds.An equity swap involves an agreement to exchange the returns on a stock index
portfolio for a ﬂow of interest payments.Such swaps could be arranged for any of the major stock
indices, e.g. the S&P 500, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225, CAC 40, and DAX. Figure 28.1 illustrates an
equity swap for the CAC 40 (the main French stock index).
Investor A has a balanced portfolio of French stocks but is bearish about the French stock
market. As an alternative to selling the portfolio, the investor could enter an equity swap.The
swap illustrated by Figure 28.1 would be suitable if the investor were bullish on the US dollar and
US dollar interest rates.

getting involved in the analysis of individual French stocks.(Note that stock returns include capital
gains or losses as well as dividends.)
Investor A has a portfolio of French shares and wishes to swap the returns for the interest on a
US dollar bank deposit, thereby eliminating exposure to the French stock market without selling
shares. Investor B obtains exposure to the French stock market without buying shares.
CONCLUSION
Stock index futures are signiﬁcant tools for fund management.They allow fund managers to vary
the level of market risk of their portfolios.Hedgers seek to reduce risk,speculators accept increased
risk, and arbitragers pursue risk-free proﬁts.
Stock index futures have advantages over shares. It is much easier to take a short position in
futures than in shares.Transactions in futures can be carried out more quickly and more cheaply
than transactions in shares. Stock index futures provide a very flexible tool for portfolio
management.
It is even possible to create equity funds without buying shares. Futures funds entail
combinations of risk-free investments, in the form of money market investments (see Chapter 3
on money market investments), and futures contracts.The use of futures enables fund managers
to go beyond equity investments and to include bond, currency, and commodity futures (see
Chapters 43 and 39 on bond futures and on currency forwards, futures, swaps, and options,
respectively). In this way risk reduction by diversiﬁcation can be increased (see Chapter 13 on
portfolio diversiﬁcation).Hedge funds often make considerable use of futures contracts of various
types (see Chapter 16 on styles of portfolio construction).
One limitation of futures funds is that the shares of smaller companies are not covered since
the indices on which futures are based tend to exclude the shares of smaller companies.In the UK
there are futures contracts that cover the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 shares,but companies whose
market capitalisations fall below the top 350 are not covered.
This chapter has provided hypothetical examples of the construction of futures funds,and more
examples are presented in Chapter 29 on stock index futures prices. Futures funds are a form of
structured product (see Chapter 34 on structured products).Futures funds based on stock indices
are, when the notional value of the futures matches the value of the fund, a form of index tracker
fund (see Chapters 9 and 16 on mutual funds and styles of portfolio construction, respectively).
Futures funds could allow institutional fund managers to offer retail investors index tracker funds,
which give better diversiﬁcation than that provided by an index such as the FTSE 100 or the FTSE
All-Share Index.These indices are dominated by the top ten companies and hence may not provide
optimally diversiﬁed portfolios (see Chapters 7 and 13 on stock indices and portfolio
diversiﬁcation, respectively). For example a balanced combination of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
579

futures would reduce the dominance of the very large companies, and would also give a broader
coverage of industrial sectors.
Funds that use stock index futures rather than shares are still affected by, and impact on, the
stock market.The link between the futures and stock markets is provided by cash and carry
arbitrage (see Chapter 29 on stock index futures prices).Cash and carry arbitrage ensures that stock
market movements are reﬂected by futures prices,and that futures price movements are reﬂected
by the stock market.

Stock index futures prices
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The role of arbitrage in the determination of stock index futures prices.
2. Arbitrage strategies to make profits from observed mispricing.
3. The roles of hedgers and speculators in the determination of futures prices.
4. The role of risk in the pricing process.
5. The relationship between futures prices and expected future spot prices.
ARBITRAGE PRICING
The pricing of stock index futures can be looked upon as being based on cash-and-carry arbitrage.
The futures price should be such that there is no arbitrage proﬁt from simultaneously buying stock
(with borrowed money) and selling futures.Likewise there should be no proﬁt opportunity from
selling stock (short) and simultaneously buying futures.
The excess of the ﬁnancing cost (interest on the borrowed money) of holding the stock over
the dividend receipts constitutes the net cost of carry.The selling price guaranteed by the futures
should match the initial cost of the stock plus the net cost of carry.In other words,the futures price
should provide a guaranteed capital gain that exactly compensates for the excess of the interest
payments over the (expected) dividend receipts. Such a futures price is referred to as the fair
futures price.
The fair value premium is the excess of the fair futures price over the spot (i.e. actual) stock
index.The formula for the fair value premium is:
FP  I  [{(ry)/100}  {d/365}]
FP is the fair value premium,I is the spot FTSE 100 Index,r is the interest rate,y is the expected
percentage dividend yield on the index portfolio, and d is the number of days to maturity of the
futures contract.
581

For example, let I  6,000, r  7% p.a., y  2% p.a., and d  91 days.Then:
FP  6,000  [{(72)/100}  {91/365}]  75 index points
(So the fair futures price is 6,000  75  6,075.)
Short cash and carry involves selling (borrowed) stock and buying futures.In this case the excess
of interest over dividends is a net inﬂow and this gain should be matched by having a guaranteed
future purchase price that exceeds the spot sale price by the amount of this net inﬂow.The money
from the stock sale is put on deposit. In the case of short selling, the borrower of the stock must
pay sums equivalent to the dividends to the lender of the stock.The excess of interest over dividends
is a net inﬂow that should be matched by a capital loss guaranteed by the futures price.
EXERCISE 29.1
If the rate of interest on risk-free bank deposits were 7.5% p.a.,and if money could be borrowed
at the same rate of interest, estimate the price of a FTSE 100 futures contract which matures in
four months on the basis of a spot index of 4,000 and a zero expected rate of dividend yield on the
FTSE 100 portfolio.How would the answer change if the expected rate of dividend yield were 4.5%
p.a. (while the other values were as before)?
Answers
Using the formula:
FP  I 
 d/365
and treating four months as exactly one-third of a year gives (with zero expected dividend yield):
FP  4,000 

FP  4,000  0.025  100
If the fair value premium is 100, the fair futures price is 4,000 100  4,100.
With an expected rate of dividend yield of 4.5% p.a. the calculation becomes:
FP  4,000 

FP  4,000  0.01  40
If the fair value premium is 40, the fair futures price is 4,000  40  4,040

(a) How many futures contracts, with a one-year maturity, are required for a fund that has a
£1,000,000 exposure to the FTSE 100?
(b) What is the fair futures price?
(c) What is the rate of capital gain on the fund if the FTSE 100 rises by 20% over the year, and
the futures price is initially at its fair level?
(d) What is the total return on the fund if the FTSE 100 rises by 20% over the year?
(e) How would the answers to (a),(c), and (d) change if the futures contracts were to provide a

(f) Is it the case that the whole of the £1,000,000 can be kept in a bank deposit?
Answers
(a) £1,000,000/(5,000  £10)  20 contracts.
(b) The fair futures price is 5,000  5,000(0.050.03)  5,100.

(d) 18%  5%  23%. (Capital gain on futures plus interest on deposit. Note that this is equal
to the capital gain on the shares plus the dividends on the shares.)
(e) The number of contracts required would be 40.The futures proﬁt would double to 1,800,so
the rate of capital gain doubles to 36%.The total rate of return is then 36%  5%  41%.
EXERCISE 29.3
(a) If the FTSE 100 stands at 5,000, how can a futures fund with £5,000,000 be constructed so
as to provide (i) £5,000,000 and (ii) £10,000,000 exposure to the market?
(b) The interest rate is 5% p.a.,the expected dividend yield on the FTSE 100 is 3% p.a.,and the
futures mature in one year.What is (i) the capital gain, and (ii) the total return, on the two
funds if the FTSE 100 rises by 30% over the year?
Answer
(a)
(i) At £10 per index point each FTSE 100 futures contract relates to £50,000 of stock.The
purchase of 100 contracts would provide exposure of £5,000,000 (most of the
£5,000,000 is put on deposit but part may be used for paying initial margin).
(ii) £10,000,000 exposure would entail the purchase of 200 futures contracts.
STOCK INDEX FUTURES PRICES
583

(b) The net cost of carry is 5%  3%  2% p.a.The fair futures price is 5,000  1.02  5,100.
If the FTSE 100 rises by 30%, it will increase to 6,500.
(i) A 30% rise in the FTSE 100 would increase it to 6,500.The futures price converges on
to (i.e.moves into equality with) the spot price by the futures maturity date.If the futures
are fairly priced, the capital gain for the £5,000,000 exposure fund will be 6,500 
5,100  1,400 index points (1,400  £10  100  £1,400,000).The capital gain for
the £10,000,000 exposure would be 2,800 (£2,800,000).
(ii) The total return includes the 5% interest on the £5,000,000 (£5,000,000  0.05 
£250,000) in addition to the capital gains.
The actual futures price may differ from the fair futures price.This is due to transaction costs such
as commissions and bid-offer spreads.An arbitrager must make a gain that covers transaction costs
before showing a net proﬁt.The actual futures price can deviate from the fair futures price by as
much as the transaction costs without arbitrage taking place.Arbitrage becomes proﬁtable only
when the actual futures price deviates from the fair futures price by an amount that exceeds the
transaction costs.
In the absence of transaction costs, cash-and-carry arbitrage would tend to keep the actual
futures price equal to the fair futures price because undervalued futures would be bought by
arbitragers (pushing up the futures price) and overvalued futures would be sold (pushing
the futures price down towards its fair value). In the presence of transaction costs, the cash-and-
carry arbitrage merely keeps the futures price within a range of values known as the no-arbitrage
band.The no-arbitrage band is between the fair futures price plus transaction costs and the fair
futures price minus transaction costs.When the futures price is within the no-arbitrage band,
there will be no further buying or selling by arbitragers to move the futures price towards the fair
futures price (i.e.towards the middle of the no-arbitrage band).Within the no-arbitrage band,the
gains from arbitrage are not sufficient to offset transaction costs. Figure 29.1 illustrates a no-
arbitrage band.
If the futures price falls below the bottom of the no-arbitrage band, arbitragers would buy
futures until the futures price reaches the bottom of the band, at which point arbitrage would
stop. A futures price above the top of the no-arbitrage band would induce long cash-and-carry
arbitrage, which involves selling futures.The sale of futures would move the futures price to the
top of the no-arbitrage band, but no further. Once the futures price is within the band, arbitrage
opportunities cease.
So the arbitrage pressure that tends to prevent deviations of actual futures prices from
fair futures prices merely serves to keep the actual futures prices within a range (the no-
arbitrage band) rather than ensuring equality with the fair futures price. Arbitrage occurs
only when the actual futures price moves outside the no-arbitrage band (i.e. away from the fair
futures price by more than the sum of the transaction costs).This is illustrated by the following
exercises.

The FTSE 100 is 6,000.The three-month interest rate is 8% p.a.and the expected rate of dividend

How might an arbitrage proﬁt be made if the actual futures price were (a) 6,100 and (b) 6,000

The no-arbitrage band

corresponding net cost of carry is 60 index points (£600).So there is a net proﬁt of 40 index
points (£400).
(b) If the actual futures price were 6,000, the futures would be undervalued. So stock should be
sold and futures bought (short cash-and-carry).There is neither proﬁt nor loss from the stock
and futures position.The net cost of carry accrues as proﬁt and is 60 index points (60  £10
 £600).The net cost of carry accrues as proﬁt since interest is received at 8% p.a. (it is
interest on the proceeds of selling borrowed stock) whilst dividends are paid to the lender of
the stock at 4% p.a.
If the total of transaction costs were £500, there would be no net proﬁt remaining in case
(a) and only £600  £500  £100 in case (b).The futures price has to deviate by 50 index
points from its fair value before any arbitrage proﬁts become available.
In this case there is a no-arbitrage band of 50 index points either side of the fair futures price
(6,010  6,110).Futures prices within this band do not induce arbitrage since they offer no
net arbitrage proﬁt.
In the absence of transaction costs,cash-and-carry arbitrage would tend to keep the actual
futures price equal to the fair futures price because undervalued futures would be bought
by arbitragers (pushing up the futures price) and overvalued futures would be sold (pushing
the futures price down towards its fair value). In the presence of transaction costs, the cash-
and-carry arbitrage merely keeps the futures price within the no-arbitrage band.When the
futures price is within the no-arbitrage band, there will be no further buying or selling by
arbitragers to move the futures price towards the fair futures price (that is towards the middle
of the no-arbitrage band).
If the futures price falls below the bottom of the no-arbitrage band arbitragers would buy
futures until the futures price reaches the bottom of the band,at which point arbitrage would
stop.A futures price above the top of the no-arbitrage band would induce long cash-and-carry
arbitrage, which involves selling futures.The sale of futures would move the futures price to
the top of the no-arbitrage band, but no further. Once the futures price is within the band,

the effects of arbitragers pursuing such a proﬁt?
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
586

Answers
(a) The futures premium over spot, FP, is given by :
FP  I  [(ry)/100]  [d/365]
Treating d/365 as 0.25 (a quarter of the year) gives:
FP  5,000  [(73)/100]  0.25  50
So the fair futures price is 5,000  50  5,050
(b) Both long and short cash-and-carry arbitrages involve the purchase and sale of stock.So each
arbitrage incurs transaction costs amounting to 1.2% of the value of the stock. Based on an
index of 5,000 this amounts to 60 index points. So the no-arbitrage band would be 5,050
/ 60, i.e. 4,990 to 5,110.
(c) A futures price of 5,200 would be above the no-arbitrage band. Arbitragers could sell the
overpriced futures and simultaneously buy stock (long cash-and-carry arbitrage).These
transactions would tend to reduce the futures price and raise the spot index (and hence the
fair futures price and the no-arbitrage band).The futures price would fall,and the no-arbitrage
band would rise, until the futures price equalled the top of the no-arbitrage band. At that
point arbitrage would cease, since it would no longer be proﬁtable.
Since cash-and-carry arbitrage merely determines a band of possible futures prices around the fair
futures price,there may be opportunities for enhancing proﬁts by buying futures when the futures
price is towards the bottom of the range of possible values (i.e.below the fair futures price).A rise
in the actual futures price relative to the fair futures price would add to the proﬁts arising from
movements in the fair futures price.Buying when the actual futures price is below the fair futures
price enhances the probability of a rise in the actual futures price relative to the no-arbitrage band
of possible values.This is known as basis trading,and can be used to enhance the proﬁts of hedgers
and investors.
If the futures contracts are held to maturity,such an addition to proﬁt is assured since the actual
futures price and the fair futures price converge as maturity is approached (on the futures maturity
date the spot stock index, the fair futures price, and the actual futures price are equal).
No-arbitrage bands provide both problems and opportunities for the managers of futures funds.
The problems arise because movements of the actual futures price within the no-arbitrage band
can produce tracking error.If the futures fund is used as a form of index tracker fund,such tracking
error reduces the accuracy with which the futures fund tracks the index.This can be seen as basis
risk.However there is an opportunity for basis trading.By buying futures when the actual futures
price is below the fair futures price,the fund manager can add to returns.This adds an element of
active fund management to a futures fund, which is used as a form of index tracker fund.
THE ROLE OF HEDGERS AND SPECULATORS
Arbitrage determines that the futures price will fall within a range of values, the no-arbitrage
band. However it does not determine where, within that range, the futures price will lie.
STOCK INDEX FUTURES PRICES
587

This provides a role for hedgers and speculators to inﬂuence futures prices. Net buying by
hedgers and speculators would move the futures price towards the top of the no-arbitrage band,
while selling would induce a price movement towards the bottom of the band.Since net purchases
would result from bullish views and net sales from bearish views,it follows that market expectations
will play a part in determining the position of the futures price within the band.
Not only might such expectations affect the position of the futures price within the no-arbitrage
band,but also they have the potential for moving stock prices,and hence the position of the band.
To understand the processes involved,consider the situation in which hedgers and/or speculators
buy futures to the extent that the futures price rises above the top of the no-arbitrage band.When
the futures price rises above the top of the band,the opportunity for long cash-and-carry arbitrage
arises.Arbitragers buy stock and sell the (overpriced) futures.This tends to put upward pressure
on stock prices (and hence on the fair futures price and on the no-arbitrage band) as well as
downward pressure on futures prices.
Conversely if futures prices were to fall below the bottom of the no-arbitrage band,the potential
for profits from short cash-and-carry arbitrage would emerge. In that case futures would be
underpriced,and so arbitragers would buy the cheap futures and simultaneously sell shares.Share
prices would be pushed down and futures prices would be pushed up.However the process of short
cash-and-carry arbitrage could be more difﬁcult than long cash-and-carry arbitrage because short
selling might be difﬁcult. For arbitragers to sell shares they need to acquire the shares to sell.The
shares would be borrowed,typically from institutional investors,and then sold.Such short selling
could be restricted,expensive,and subject to uncertainties.Not everyone can borrow stock,fees
must be paid to the lenders, and the lenders can demand return of the shares at any time (and in
particular before the arbitrage proﬁt has been obtained).
The ﬁndings of research carried out by Fung (2007) are consistent with the type of process
just described.Fung identiﬁed net buying pressure in the stock market by a predominance of trades
at offer (ask) prices,which are the buying prices of shares.A predominance of trades at bid prices,
the prices at which shares are sold,indicated net selling pressure.Futures prices above no-arbitrage
bands were associated with net buying pressure in the stock market, as would be expected
from long cash-and-carry arbitrage.When the futures prices were below the bottom of the
no-arbitrage band there was net selling pressure in the stock market, as would be expected
from short cash-and-carry arbitrage.The response times to short cash-and-carry opportunities were
longer than for long cash-and-carry opportunities,as would be expected from the difﬁculty of short
selling.
EXERCISE 29.6
The FTSE 100 is 6,000,the three-month interest rate is 6% p.a.,and the expected rate of dividend
yield on the FTSE 100 over the next three months is 3% p.a.
(a) What is the fair price of a futures contract due to mature in three months?
(b) If ﬁnancial institutions face transaction costs of 0.3% on both purchases and sales of stock,
plus 0.5% tax on purchases, what is the no-arbitrage band of futures prices?

(c) If speculators adopt the view that that the FTSE 100 will be 6,200 in three months from the
present, what would you expect to happen in the futures and spot markets?
Answers
(a) The fair futures premium is:
6,000 

 45
The fair futures price is:
6,000  45  6,045
(b) The no-arbitrage band will be 1.1% each side of the fair futures price.The 1.1% is based on
buying costs of 0.3% plus 0.5% tax,and selling costs of 0.3%.These costs are incurred in the
case of both long and short cash-and-carry arbitrage.
Based on the initial index of 6,000, the 1.1% is equivalent to 66 index points. So the no-
arbitrage band should be:
6,045  66  6,111
to
6,045  66  5,979
(c) If speculators believe that the FTSE 100 will be 6,200, they would buy futures at any price
below 6,200 with a view to selling when the price rises to 6,200 (on the futures maturity date
spot and futures prices are equal).These purchases would tend to pull the futures price out
of the no-arbitrage band. As the futures price rises above the no-arbitrage band, arbitrage
opportunities emerge.Arbitragers would sell the relatively overpriced futures and buy the
relatively underpriced stock.This would put downward pressure on the futures price and
upward pressure on the FTSE 100 (and hence the no-arbitrage band).If both speculators and
arbitragers have adequate funds,the no-arbitrage band should rise until the value of 6,200 falls
within the band. Speculation will cease when the FTSE 100 futures price reaches 6,200 and
arbitrage will stop when the no-arbitrage band encompasses the value of 6,200.
THE ROLE OF RISK AND NOISE TRADERS
The arbitrage process is not entirely risk-free. Stock prices might move against the arbitrager
during the time taken to assemble the portfolio. Indeed an arbitrager’s own trading in pursuit of
arbitrage proﬁts could move prices such as to remove proﬁt opportunities. Furthermore, future
dividends cannot be known with certainty.In consequence,some risk remains and arbitragers may
require compensation for such risk.Any compensation for risk tends to widen the no-arbitrage
band but by amounts that differ between arbitragers and vary over time. So the boundaries of a
no-arbitrage band should be seen not as deﬁnite values, but as imprecise borders.
These risk factors that arbitragers face are compounded by other uncertainties relating to
arbitrage.One of these other uncertainties concerns non-synchronous trading.The prices quoted
1

STOCK INDEX FUTURES PRICES
589

at a point in time are those of the last trade.For some stocks the most recent trade might have been
one minute ago, for others an hour or more ago, whilst other shares might not have traded for a
day or more.The result is that listed prices relate to different points in time and are therefore not
comparable.The relevant prices are those that would pertain to the present moment, but not all
prices do so. Since prices move over time, listed prices may be misleading. If an up-to-date price
were available, it might differ from the published price. In consequence apparent arbitrage
opportunities may not be real ones.
Arbitrage that involves short selling shares faces additional uncertainties. Not only might it be
difﬁcult to ﬁnd a shareholder willing to lend stock, but also that shareholder could demand the
return of the shares at an unfavourable point in time.The arbitrager could be forced to liquidate
the arbitrage transactions before proﬁts have been made, or whilst prices have moved so as to
render the trade loss making.
Another set of risks might be described as noise trader risks.Noise traders are irrational traders
(see Chapter 24 on noise trading and behavioural finance). Such traders can move markets in
unpredictable directions. In particular they can increase mispricing for periods of time. Futures
contracts have maturity dates on which spot (i.e. actual) and futures stock indices will be equal,
with the consequence that the effects of noise traders would not be permanent. However futures
contracts with distant maturities can experience prolonged price discrepancies. Not only does
this delay the receipt of the arbitrage proﬁts, but it can also create cash ﬂow problems.When
futures prices move against a trader,that trader must pay variation margin.If futures prices move
against an arbitrager (before moving favourably), the arbitrager would need to ﬁnance variation
margin payments.There is a risk that an arbitrager may be forced to terminate an arbitrage trade
when it is loss making because of an inability to fund further calls for variation margin payments.
Holmes and Tomsett (2004) and McMillan and Speight (2006) conducted research on the
signiﬁcance of noise traders for FTSE 100 futures, with conﬂicting results. Holmes and Tomsett
found that trading was predominantly informed trading rather than noise trading.This suggests that
arbitragers are not faced with high degrees of price overreaction arising from psychological biases
of noise traders.
McMillan and Speight (2006) concluded that mispricing arising from noise trading can persist
and that the discrepancy between observed and fair prices can widen.They referred to the ﬁndings
from behavioural ﬁnance to the effect that noise traders engage in momentum (positive feedback)
trading reinforced by overconfidence and resulting in overreaction to news. Arbitragers face
uncertainty as to whether pricing discrepancies will widen before they narrow.Do they take a small
proﬁt or wait for an uncertain larger one? Do they take the risk that further movement of futures
prices away from fair prices will drain their resources available for ﬁnancing variation margin
payments?
EXERCISE 29.7
(a) If the FTSE 100 Index stands at 4,000 points, how can a futures fund with £10,000,000 be
structured so as to provide (i) £10,000,000 and (ii) £20,000,000 exposure to the stock
market?
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
590

(b) The interest rate is 4% p.a.,the expected dividend yield on the FTSE 100 is 3% p.a.,and the
futures mature in one year.What is (i) the capital gain, and (ii) the total return, on the two
funds if the FTSE 100 rises by 20% over the year and futures are fairly priced?
(c) How could a fund be structured to take advantage of an expected fall in the stock market? What
would happen to the value of such a fund in the event of a 20% rise in the FTSE 100 over a
year (with a 4% p.a. interest rate and a 3% p.a. expected dividend yield)?
(d) Why might a futures fund fail to perfectly track a stock index?
Answers
(a)
(i) At £10 per index point each futures contract relates to £40,000 of stock.The purchase
of 250 (£10,000,000/£40,000  250) contracts would provide exposure of
£10,000,000 (most of the £10,000,000 is put on deposit in a bank but part may be used
for paying initial margin, which also earns interest).
(ii) £20,000,000 exposure would entail the purchase of 500 (£20,000,000/£40,000  500)
futures contracts.
(b) The net cost of carry is 4%  3%  1% p.a.The fair futures price is 4,000  1.01  4,040
(the fair futures premium is 0.01  4,000  40). If the FTSE 100 rises by 20%, it would
increase to 4,800 by the end of the year. Due to convergence the futures price will also be
4,800 when the futures mature at the end of the year.
(i) If the futures are fairly priced,the capital gain for the £10,000,000 exposure fund would
be 4,800  4,040  760 index points (760  £10  250  £1,900,000).The capital
gain for the £20,000,000 exposure fund would be 760  £10  500  £3,800,000.
(ii) The total return includes the 4% interest on the £10,000,000 (£10,000,000  0.04 
£400,000) in addition to the capital gains.
In percentage terms,the rate of return on the £10,000,000 exposure fund is (£1,900,000 
£400,000)/£10,000,000  23%.The rate of return on the £20,000,000 exposure fund is
(£3,800,000  £400,000)/£10,000,000  42%.This demonstrates the beneﬁts of gearing
in a rising market.
(c) Instead of buying futures contracts, they are sold. For example 250 contracts might be sold.
The change in the futures price would produce a loss.In this case there would be a loss of 760
index points,which amounts to £1,900,000.Taking account of the £400,000 interest reduces
the loss to £1,500,000, i.e. 15% of the investment.
(d) A futures fund would fail to precisely track an index if basis changes (basis is the difference
between the values of the spot and futures indices).The extent of potential basis change will
depend upon the width of the no-arbitrage band,which in turn depends upon factors such as
transaction costs and risks faced by arbitragers. Basis may also change as a result of liquidity
problems, or as a result of arbitrage failing to keep futures prices within the no-arbitrage
band.Changes in interest rates or expected dividend yield could change basis by changing the
fair futures price. Small funds might ﬁnd that the indivisibility of futures contracts prevents
full replication of the index,and hence causes tracking to be imperfect.The index that the fund
STOCK INDEX FUTURES PRICES
591

aims to track could be one on which no futures contracts are based, for example the FTSE
All-Share Index.Replication of such an index with futures on another index,such as the FTSE
100,would be subject to the imperfections associated with cross-hedging.The two indices do
not move precisely in line with each other.
EXERCISE 29.8
An actively managed OEIC keeps, on average, 5% of its fund in bank deposits in order to meet
potential redemptions. If the real rate of return on the stock market as a whole is 7% p.a. whilst
the real interest rate on bank deposits is 2% p.a., what is the effect of this liquidity provision on
the rate of return of the fund?
If the liquidity provision were matched by stock index futures,what would be the effect on the
rate of return of the fund (assuming that the total rate of return on the fund portfolio matches the
total rate of return on the portfolio on which the stock index is based)?
Answers
The expected real rate of return on the fund is reduced from 7% p.a. to:
(0.95  7%)  (0.05  2%)  6.75% p.a.
The provision of liquidity has reduced average real return from 7% p.a. to 6.75% p.a.
If futures are fairly priced, the return on futures plus bank deposits equals the total return on
the share portfolio (capital gains plus dividends).The futures plus deposit is equivalent to an index
tracker fund. Matching the bank deposit with futures should restore the expected real return on
the fund to 7% p.a. (See Exercise 29.2 part (d) for an illustration of the equality, of total return,
between a futures fund and an index tracker portfolio.)
FUTURES PRICES AND EXPECTED FUTURE SPOT PRICES
The activity of speculators might be expected to keep the futures index close to the expected
future index.If the futures index is low relative to the expected spot value,speculators would buy
in order to proﬁt from a price rise as the futures index converges on to the expected index. If the
futures index is above the expected index, speculators would sell futures in order to proﬁt when
the futures index falls towards the expected index.The purchases and sales of speculators would
tend to push the futures price towards the expected future spot price.The normal situation would
appear to be equality between the futures price and the expected future spot price.
However, according to the capital asset pricing model, the holder of a futures contract bears
risk for which there should be compensation in the form of expected return.This expected return
requires that the futures index should be below the expected future spot index.In such a situation
the futures index should rise towards the expected index steadily over time in order to provide
the expected return. So the convergence of the futures index onto the expected index would be
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
592

gradual rather than rapid.The normal situation would be inequality between the futures price and
the expected future spot price.
CONCLUSION
Stock index futures have a signiﬁcant role in the management of investment portfolios, including
those of institutional investors. Investment managers who use futures need to know about
inﬂuences on futures prices. Some knowledge of whether futures are overpriced or underpriced
could inﬂuence the timing of trades.An investor who needs to buy futures may look for a moment
when the futures price is below the fair price. Likewise a prospective seller may attempt to time
the sale to coincide with the futures price being above fair value.To achieve favourable timing it is
necessary to understand what determines the fair price,and what determines deviations from the
fair price.Whether stock index futures are used for managing portfolios of shares,or whether they
are used as a class of investment in their own right (e.g. in futures funds), obtaining favourable
deviations from fair price can add to investment returns. For example if a futures fund is used as
a form of index tracker fund, trading futures when their prices show favourable deviations could
enhance the return on the fund (this would add a dimension of active management to the index
tracking strategy).
Although arbitrage may constrain the extent of deviations from fair value,it cannot prevent such
deviations.The behaviour of hedgers and speculators will inﬂuence the direction and extent of
deviation. In so far as hedgers and speculators are inﬂuenced by sentiment and other behavioural
biases,an understanding of the principles of behavioural ﬁnance should be useful when using stock
index futures.

Hedging with stock
index futures
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Hedging with stock index futures.
2. Hedge ratios.
3. Sources of hedge imperfection.
4. Adjustment for futures premiums.
Stock index futures are contracts for notional purchases or sales of portfolios of shares on future
dates at predetermined prices.The word ‘notional’is signiﬁcant because stock index futures provide
no facility for delivery and receipt of stock via exercise of the contract. Stock prices to be paid or
received in the future are guaranteed to be close to predetermined prices because stock price
movements are (approximately) matched by compensatory cash ﬂows from the futures.
Futures contracts are available on many stock indices.Stock indices on which futures are traded
include the S&P 100, S&P 500, Nikkei 225, FTSE 100, DAX, CAC 40, and the Hang Seng.There
are contracts relating to all the major stock markets. Contract sizes are based on sums of money
per index point. So if an S&P 500 contract is based on $500 per index point and the index (in the
futures market) stands at 1,200,then each futures contract relates to 1,200  $500  $600,000
of stock. Similarly, at £10 per index point, a FTSE 100 futures price of 6,000 indicates that each
futures contract relates to 6,000  £10  £60,000 worth of shares.
THE NATURE OF HEDGING
Hedging is the reduction of an existing risk.When using stock index futures to reduce stock market
risk, the anticipation is that any losses arising from movements in stock prices are offset by gains
from parallel movements in futures prices.An investor might be anxious about the possibility that
the prices of his or her stocks might fall.He or she could reduce the risk of a reduction in the value
of the portfolio by taking a position in the futures market that would provide a gain in the event
of a fall in stock prices.In such a case the investor would take a short position in stock index futures

EXAMPLE 30.1
A portfolio holder fears a generalised fall in equity prices and wishes to avoid a fall in the value
of his or her portfolio.
5 April
The investor holds a balanced portfolio of shares valued at £1,000,000, but fears a fall in its value.
The current FTSE 100 Index is 5,000.
The investor hedges by selling 20 June FTSE 100 futures contracts at a price of 5,000 each. The
investor is thus committed to the notional sale of £1,000,000 of stock on the June futures expiry
date at the level of equity prices implied by the futures price on 5 April. (£1,000,000  20 
5,000  £10, where each of the 20 futures contracts relates to stock worth £10 per index point,
i.e. 5,000  £10.)
10 May
The FTSE 100 Index has fallen to 4,500. Correspondingly, the value of the portfolio has declined
to £900,000.
The investor closes out the futures position by buying 20 June FTSE 100 futures contracts at a
price of 4,500. The notional buying price of each contract is thus 500 index points below the
notional selling price.
contracts. By taking a short position, he or she guarantees a notional selling price of a quantity of
stock for a speciﬁc date in the future. Should stock prices fall and stock index futures behave in a
corresponding fashion,the notional buying price for that date would be less than the predetermined
notional selling price.The investor could close out his or her position in futures by taking a long
position in the same number of contracts (i.e. by buying futures).The excess of the selling price
over the buying price is paid to the investor in cash in the form of variation margin.This gain on
the futures contracts is received on a daily basis as the futures price moves (the daily settlement is
known as marking to market).Had the prices of stocks risen,the investor would have gained from
his or her portfolio of equities,but lost on futures dealings.In either case,the investor has succeeded
in reducing the extent to which the value of the portfolio ﬂuctuates.
The use of futures to hedge the risk of a fall in stock prices does not require any alteration of
the original portfolio. It is thus preferable to any form of hedging that involves changing the
composition of the portfolio, such as liquidating part of the portfolio.The transaction costs of
hedging with futures are also much lower than those of selling, and subsequently buying back,
shares.There may be poor liquidity in many shares,particularly those of small companies.It could
be difﬁcult to sell illiquid shares, and the price may need to be reduced in order to entice buyers.
If only the liquid, large company, shares are sold the portfolio becomes unbalanced.
HEDGING WITH STOCK INDEX FUTURES

EXAMPLE 30.2
Example 30.2 shows how a long position in futures can be used as a hedge. In this case, a fund
manager anticipates receipt of £1 million on 10 January and intends to use it to buy a balanced
portfolio of UK equities. The fund manager fears, one month earlier, that stock prices will rise before
the money is received (with the consequence that fewer shares can be bought with the £1 million).
10 December
An investor anticipates the receipt of £1 million on 10 January. The current FTSE 100 Index is
5,500. The investor fears a rise in the index.
The investor buys 18 March FTSE futures contracts at a price of 5,500. The investor is thereby
notionally committed to paying £990,000 (18  5,500  £10) for stock on the futures maturity
date.
10 January
The new FTSE 100 Index is 5,750.
The investor closes out by selling 18 March FTSE 100 futures contracts at a price of 5,700. The
investor notionally guarantees a receipt of £1,026,000 (18  5,700  £10) upon maturity of
the futures contracts.
The investor requires an additional £45,455 in order to buy the quantity of stock that £1 million
would have bought on 10 December (£1,000,000  [5,750/5,500]  £1,045,455).
There is a proﬁt from the futures of £36,000 [18  (5,700  5,500)  10].
Loss on the portfolio
 £100,000
Gain from futures trading
 £100,000 (20  500  £10)
This is a perfect hedge since the futures proﬁt precisely offsets the loss on the portfolio.
This strategy is one that reduces variations in the value of the portfolio holder’s assets. If the FTSE
100 Index had risen, there would have been a cash market gain offset by a futures market loss.
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
596

SOURCES OF HEDGE IMPERFECTION
In Example 30.2 futures prices did not move precisely in line with the FTSE 100 Index and, as a
result, the hedge was imperfect. Basis is the difference between the spot and futures indices.A
change in basis will render a hedge imperfect. In Example 30.2, basis changes from 0 to 50 index
points.The possibility of a change in basis is known as basis risk.
One risk faced by hedgers is the possibility that futures are mispriced at the time they are
traded. Mispricing could arise as a result of the fair price being based on inaccurate estimates
of future dividends. Another source of mispricing is the deviation of the actual futures
price from the fair futures price within the no-arbitrage band. If a hedger buys when futures
are overpriced, or sells when they are underpriced, there is a strong risk that an adverse
change in basis reduces the effectiveness of the hedge. Futures with distant maturities often
exhibit poor liquidity. Trading in illiquid markets may require large price concessions in
order to attract trading counterparties. Buyers have to offer high prices and sellers must
accept low prices. Large price concessions move futures prices, and hence basis, against the
hedger.
Even if basis did not change, and the futures index rose to 5,750 in line with the spot index,
the hedge would still be incomplete.The futures proﬁt would be £45,000 whereas £45,455 is
required.This hedge imperfection arises from the indivisibility of contracts. Indivisibility of
contracts means that it is not possible to trade fractions of contracts, only whole contracts can be
bought and sold. In consequence it is not possible to hedge the £1,000,000 precisely.The nearest
whole number of contracts covers just £990,000. So £10,000 is left unhedged, and the hedge is
thus incomplete.
Another source of hedge imperfection might be differences in the percentage price changes
between the hedged portfolio and the FTSE 100 Index arising from the portfolio having a beta
different from that of the index.This latter source of hedge imperfection can be dealt with by the
use of hedge ratios.
HEDGE RATIOS
Hedge ratios become necessary when the price behaviour of the futures contract is likely to differ
from that of the portfolio to be hedged. If the portfolio to be hedged shows relatively large
variations, then it is appropriate to use more futures contracts than in the case of a more stable
portfolio. It is unlikely that a portfolio of stocks, for which hedging is required, precisely
corresponds to the composition of a stock index. It is thus probable that it will show more or less
volatility than the index.
The beta factor of a stock is a measure of the extent to which it moves in line with stock prices
in general. A balanced portfolio is likely to have a beta of about 1. A stock with only half the
movement of the market as a whole would have a beta of 0.5, while one with double the degree
of change has a beta of 2.The beta of a portfolio of stocks is the weighted average of the betas of
the stocks that constitute the portfolio.
If a calculation indicates a beta of 1.2, the portfolio tends to change by 20% more than the
stock index. Hedging the portfolio would require the value of the stock index futures contracts
to exceed the portfolio value by 20%.The relatively large losses (or proﬁts) arising from the high
HEDGING WITH STOCK INDEX FUTURES
597

volatility require correspondingly large offsetting proﬁts (or losses) from futures contracts, and
this necessitates a relatively large number of futures contracts.
The calculation of the appropriate number of futures contracts to trade will involve ascertaining
the market exposure of the stock portfolio.The market exposure of the stock portfolio is not the
same as its market value. Market value needs to be adjusted by the stock betas.Table 30.1 shows
hypothetical stock betas and the corresponding market exposures, which are calculated by
multiplying the market values of the stocks by the betas.
Having ascertained that the market exposure of the portfolio is $2,097,875, it is necessary
to ﬁnd the market exposure of a stock index futures contract.If the S&P 500 futures are to be used,
if the contract size is $500 per index point, and if the S&P 500 index stands at 1,350, then
each futures contract would relate to 1,350  $500  $675,000 of stock.The requisite number
of futures contracts would be $2,097,875/$675,000  3.1 contracts (the beta of a stock index
futures contract is being assumed to equal 1).This rounds down to three contracts.Although this
technique of selling stock index futures in order to neutralise the general market exposure of a
speciﬁc stock portfolio is not perfect (due to the imperfect reliability of betas and the inability to
trade fractions of futures contracts),it can remove most of the market exposure of a portfolio and
thereby allow an investor to take positions on the performance of individual stocks or sectors
relative to the market as a whole.
The successful use of hedge ratios depends upon the estimates of beta being reasonably reliable.
Estimates of beta,based on historical evidence,are subject to error and are therefore not perfectly
reliable.This is due to the fact that the methods of statistical analysis do not provide a precise
estimate of beta, instead a distribution (range) of possible values is provided.
Furthermore history is not always a reliable indicator of the future. If the characteristics of a
company change, the beta of its shares may also change. Future betas, rather than past betas, are
required for hedge ratios.
It should also be borne in mind that stock index futures hedge only systematic (market) risk.
This is the risk to individual stocks from movements in the stock market as a whole. Stock index
futures do not reduce non-systematic (stock-speciﬁc) risk. Unexpected changes in a company
cause share price movements that are not hedged by stock index futures.(Portfolio diversiﬁcation
is required for the reduction of non-systematic risk.)
Investment managers may exploit this characteristic. If an investment manager wants to trade
on the relative movements of equities (stock selection) rather than movements in the market as a
whole,hedging with stock index futures can remove the general market exposure.Conversely an

EXERCISE 30.1
A fund manager anticipates the receipt of £3 million in two months.The intention is to invest the
money equally between the three stocks X,Y, and Z.These stocks have betas of 0.9, 1.1, and 1.4
respectively.The FTSE 100 stands at 6,800.How can the fund manager hedge against a rise in stock
prices using futures?

The market exposure of the proposed portfolio shown in the table is the sum of:

It is 15 November and the FTSE 100 Index is 4,700.How can the investor hedge the portfolio
with futures? What factors could reduce the effectiveness of the hedge?
Answers
Calculate the market exposure of the portfolio by adding up the market exposures of the individual
stocks (market exposure  number of shares  share price  beta).
The total market exposure is 23,700,000p, i.e. £237,000.The market exposure provided by
one futures contract is:
4,700  £10  £47,000 (assuming that the futures have a beta of 1)
Hedging the portfolio with futures would involve selling:
£237,000/£47,000  5.04 contracts.
Since it is not possible to trade fractions of contracts the investor would sell ﬁve futures contracts.
Factors that could reduce hedge effectiveness include changes in basis, the indivisibility of
contracts (the inability to trade fractions of futures contracts), statistical error in the estimation
of beta, instability of beta (beta can change over time), and non-systematic risk.
Hedges that have the objective of minimising risk are known as minimum variance hedges.Hedges
can have other objectives,but minimising risk is probably the most usual.The optimum minimum
variance hedge ratio is the ratio of the value of futures contracts to the value of the portfolio being
hedged, which minimises risk.There have been a number of studies of optimum hedge ratios and
hedging effectiveness including one by Chen et al. (2004).They examined futures on a number of
underlying instruments,including stock indices and currencies,and hedges for periods ranging from
one day to eight weeks.They found that for short-term hedges the optimum hedge ratios were less
than one,and that optimum ratios rose towards one as the length of the hedging period increased.
The hedge ratio of one was referred to as the naive hedge ratio.Also the effectiveness of hedging
was found to be greater for the longer hedging periods, but effectiveness never reached 100%.
The tendency for the hedge ratio to approach one as the hedging period increases suggests that
investment managers should not try to estimate hedge ratios (such as the beta-based ratios
described above) but simply match the value of the futures to the value of the portfolio being

hedged.The apparent rejection of beta as a useful hedge ratio is perhaps not too surprising in the
light of the criticisms of beta (see Part 4 on capital market theory).
WHAT INDEX LEVEL IS ‘GUARANTEED’ BY FUTURES?
On the day that futures contracts reach maturity,the futures stock index will equal the spot (actual)
stock index.The futures and spot indices will tend to converge as the futures maturity date
approaches.The difference between the two indices is based on the expected difference between
ﬁnancing costs and dividend yields,and the cash ﬂow signiﬁcance of this difference falls as the time
to maturity shortens.
A hedger can expect to guarantee the spot index only if intending to close out immediately after
taking out futures contracts. If the intention is to hold futures contracts until their maturity date,
the index guaranteed is the futures index (the futures index at the time of acquiring the futures
contracts). Otherwise the locked-in index will fall between the initial spot and initial futures
indices.This is illustrated by Figure 30.1, which makes the simplifying assumption of a constant
spot index (this simplifying assumption does not negate the generality of the conclusion).
Consider a hedger attempting to guarantee the value of a portfolio that is being held.The
objective is to make a futures proﬁt (or loss) that matches the loss (or proﬁt) on the portfolio.The
hedger will sell futures to achieve this aim. In Figure 30.1, the futures index starts at a premium
to the spot index and declines over time towards the spot index.(It converges onto the spot index.)
If the futures were closed out at maturity, there would be a futures proﬁt equal to the initial

difference between the spot and futures indices.This means that the total portfolio value,inclusive
of the futures proﬁt, would correspond to the initial futures index. On the futures maturity date
the original portfolio will be at its original value because the index has not changed (assuming that
the portfolio maintains its relationship with the index),but will be enhanced by the futures proﬁt.
If the futures were closed out immediately after being sold the futures index would not have
had time to change.There would be no proﬁt from the futures contracts and the value of the
portfolio would correspond to the initial spot index. If the futures were closed out halfway to
maturity,the portfolio value should fall midway between the values implied by the initial spot and
initial futures indices.The ‘guaranteed’ portfolio value is a function of the period to closing out
the futures contracts.
This conclusion is not invalidated if the spot index fails to remain constant. Movements of the
spot index would tend to be accompanied by equivalent movements in the futures index so that
futures proﬁts/losses tend to offset losses/proﬁts on the portfolio being hedged.In consequence,
whatever happens to the spot index,early closing out guarantees the initial spot index and closing
out on the futures maturity date guarantees the initial futures index.The futures provide a hedge
against movements in the spot index.
Previously basis risk was deﬁned as the possibility of a change in the relationship between the
value of the portfolio being hedged and the futures index.Part of the basis is the difference between
the futures index and the spot index.Convergence implies that some change in basis can be expected
because the difference between the futures and spot indices will move from its initial value towards
zero. Consequently basis risk could be alternatively deﬁned as an unexpected change in basis.
There is no certainty that the ‘guaranteed’ portfolio value will be achieved.This is largely
because of basis risk in the sense of the possibility of unexpected changes in basis. Part of basis is
the difference between the spot and futures indices.Prior to maturity,this component of basis will
rarely equal zero.However,at the maturity of the futures contract the futures index will equal the
spot index. So at maturity this component of basis will equal zero. Prior to the futures maturity
the relationship between the spot and futures indices may not change precisely as expected (e.g.
due to changes in interest rates or changes in expectations of dividends). Unexpected changes in
basis render hedges imperfect. In terms of Figure 30.1, the futures index may deviate from the
dotted line with the effects that the futures proﬁt differs from the expected level and the
‘guaranteed’ index shown by the unbroken line is not achieved.
Unexpected changes in basis can have a number of causes, particularly if basis is deﬁned in
terms of a relationship between the futures index and the value of the portfolio being hedged.
Changes in interest rates or expected dividends will cause unexpected alterations in the relationship
between the fair futures index and the spot index. Any change in the relationship between the
actual futures and fair futures index (such as might arise from a change in market sentiment about
the stocks covered by the index) would further disturb basis in an unpredictable way.In addition,
the relationship between the hedged portfolio and the spot index may unexpectedly change.
This is particularly likely if the portfolio is not completely diversiﬁed and hence demonstrates
non-systematic risk.Even if well diversiﬁed a portfolio could experience an unpredictable change
in its beta, with the result that the existing hedge ratio becomes inappropriate and hedge
imperfection ensues.
The effect of the relationship between the futures and spot indices should be considered when
calculating hedge ratios.Typically futures trade at a premium to the spot index.This means that
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
602

futures price movements tend to exceed spot price movements since they are magniﬁed by the
premium.To offset this effect it may be appropriate to divide the market exposure by the futures
index (or an average of spot and futures indices) rather than by the spot index. Speciﬁcally if the
intention is to close out quickly the futures index should be used.The magniﬁcation effect of the
futures premium is offset by a corresponding reduction in the number of futures contracts used.
Division by the futures index entails division by the futures premium with the effect that the
magniﬁcation factor is offset by a reduction in the number of futures contracts. If the intention is
to close out at the futures maturity, the spot index might be used; convergence eliminates the
futures premium by the futures maturity date. More generally, an average of spot and futures
indices should be used depending upon the expected date of closing out (Redhead 1994, 1995,
1997).
CONCLUSION
There are times when investment managers want to reduce their stock market risk. Derivatives,
such as stock index futures, can be used for risk reduction.The reduction of risk by taking an
offsetting position in derivatives is known as hedging.The objective is to make a gain from the
derivatives that compensates for a loss on the existing investment.
Perfectly predictable outcomes are not to be expected.There are a number of ways in which
hedging with stock index futures may fail to be perfect. Some sources of hedge imperfection can
be anticipated,and adjustments made.In particular hedge ratios could be employed to compensate
for differences in volatility between the futures and the stock portfolio being hedged.
One approach to a hedge ratio is to use betas,speciﬁcally the beta of the futures relative to the
beta of the portfolio.The beta of the stock index futures is sometimes assumed to be one,but this
assumption may be questioned.Betas are based on the capital asset pricing model,which has been
the subject of much criticism (see Part 4 on capital market theory).The effectiveness of beta as a
source of hedge ratios is ultimately an empirical issue.An investment manager in search of a hedge
ratio should compare the usefulness of beta-based hedge ratios with other approaches to the
formulation of hedge ratios.

Stock Options


Chapter 31
Stock options
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The profit and loss potential of call and put options.
2. The factors that affect option prices.
3. The risks and potential pay-offs from selling (writing) options.
4. Boundary conditions.
A stock option is the right to buy or sell a speciﬁed number of shares at a pre-arranged price on,or
before,a particular date.A right to buy is referred to as a call option,and the right to sell a put option.
There are two other important distinctions. First, between European-style and American-style
options.European-style options can be exercised (the right to buy or sell can be used) only on the
maturity date of the option, which is known as the expiry date.An American-style option can be
exercised at any time up to,and including,the expiry date.It is to be noted that the distinction has
nothing to do with geography. Both types of option are traded throughout the world.
The second distinction is between over-the-counter (OTC) options and exchange-traded
options. OTC options are the result of private negotiations between two parties (typically, a bank
and a client).They may relate to any amount of any stock at any agreed price and have any expiry
date. In other words, they can be tailor-made to the speciﬁc requirements of the client buying the
option. Exchange-traded options are bought and sold on an organised exchange. They are
standardised as to the amount and price of the stock,and the available expiry dates.Contracts would
provide a limited range of strike prices and expiry dates.(Strike prices are the prices at which stocks
can be bought or sold,and expiry dates are the dates on which the options cease to exist.) There is
also a limitation as to which stocks are available.Most exchange-traded options are American-style.
CALL OPTIONS
A call option gives the buyer of that option the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares at a
particular price.That price is known as the exercise or strike price. At the time of buying the

option, there will be at least two strike prices available to choose from. For example, when the
price of BP shares was 568p, the option strike prices available were 550p and 600p. If the holder
of a call option decides to exercise it,he or she would buy a speciﬁc number of shares at the strike
price chosen when buying the option.The number of shares covered by one option contract varies
from country to country; examples are United States 100, UK 1,000, Germany 50.
It could be proﬁtable to exercise a call option if the market price of the stock turns out to be
higher than the strike price.In the event of the market price being lower than the strike price,the
option holder is not obliged to exercise, and presumably will not, since exercising would realise
a loss.The buyer of an option thus has potential for profit without the risk of a loss. For this
favourable situation, the buyer of an option pays a premium. Continuing the previous example,
the premiums for BP call options might be as shown in Table 31.1.January,April,and July are expiry
months.The expiry month of an option is the month in which it ceases to be exercisable. Option
premiums (i.e.prices) are expressed in the same currency units as the shares,e.g.pence in the UK,
dollars in the United States. Premiums are payable at the time the option is bought.
Sometimes the word ‘premium’ is reserved for the price originally paid for the option by an
investor whilst the term ‘price’ can relate to the market value of the option at any time. In the
current text this distinction will not be made so that ‘premium’ and ‘price’ are treated as being
synonymous.Even so the reader must bear in mind three different prices:the stock (share) price,
the strike price of the option, and the price of the option (the latter being the price at which the
option trades in the market).
EXAMPLE 31.1
An investor buys a 550p call option on BP shares at a premium of 27p per share when the share
price is 568p (550p refers to the strike price, the price at which shares are bought if the option
is exercised). Since each option contract on LIFFE relates to 1,000 shares, the cash outﬂow is
£270. (LIFFE is the acronym for the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange – LIFFE is pronounced ‘life’.) Subsequently, the share price rises to 650p. The investor
can then exercise the right to buy at 550p. There is a 100p pay-off (£1,000 per option contract).
This 100p pay-off is the intrinsic value of the option. The net profit must take account of the 27p
premium paid for the option. The net profit is thus 100p  27p  73p (£730 per option contract).
The investor has guaranteed that the effective price to be paid for the shares will not exceed 577p;
this comprises the strike price plus the premium paid for the option.

The Profit/Loss Profile at Expiry
Since an option buyer is not obliged to exercise an option,he or she has the right simply to disregard
it.In such an event the premium paid is lost,but there would be no further loss.The premium paid
is the maximum loss that can be incurred. On the other hand, the proﬁt potential is subject to no
limits. In principle, there is no upper limit to the stock price and hence no upper limit to the
potential proﬁt from the call option. Figure 31.1 shows the proﬁt/loss proﬁle of a call option at
expiry (i.e. on the date at which it expires).
The option used for the illustration is the 550p BP call whose premium is 27p.If the buyer holds
the option to the expiry date and the share price turns out to be 550p or less,there will be no point
in exercising the option.There is no beneﬁt from exercising an option to buy shares at 550p when
those shares can be bought at a lower price in the market.In such a situation,the option buyer makes
a net loss because of the payment of the 27p premium, which is non-returnable.This is shown in
Figure 31.1, which depicts a loss of 27p at all stock prices up to 550p.
If the price of the share turns out to be greater than 550p, it could be worthwhile to exercise
the option. The option holder could choose to exercise the right to buy at 550p and then
immediately sell the shares at the higher price, thereby realising a gain.At a share price of 577p,
this gross proﬁt would exactly offset the premium paid. Hence, 577p is the break-even price at
which net proﬁt is zero.At prices above 577p, the gross proﬁt exceeds the premium paid so that
there is a net proﬁt.(These ﬁgures would need some adjustment if bid-ask spreads and commission
costs were to be taken into account.)
The gross proﬁt referred to is alternatively known as the intrinsic value of the option.Intrinsic
value can be defined as the pay-off to be obtained by immediately exercising the option
(disregarding the premium paid) and is equal to the difference between the strike price and the
market price of the stock when the option is in-the-money.
An in-the-money call option is one whose strike price is less than the market price of the stock,
and which therefore offers an immediate gross proﬁt.An at-the-money option is one whose strike
price is equal to the market price.An out-of-the-money call option is one whose strike price is
greater than the market price of the stock. Only in-the-money options have intrinsic value.

The Profit/Loss Profile Prior to Expiry
At the time that a traded option expires, its price (premium) will be equal to its intrinsic value.
Prior to expiry the price of the option would normally exceed the intrinsic value.This excess of
the price of the option over the intrinsic value is known as the time value.When an option is
exercised, only the intrinsic value is realised.The seller of an option would obtain a price that
incorporates time value as well as the intrinsic value; see Figure 31.2.
Time value is at its highest when the option is at-the-money.Time value declines as the option
moves either in or out of the money and will approach zero as the market price of the stock diverges
substantially from the strike price.
Time value is zero at the time that an option expires.So Figure 31.1,which shows the proﬁt/loss
proﬁle at expiry, shows no time value. However prior to expiry an option would normally have
some time value.When account is taken of the time value, the proﬁt/loss proﬁle of an option
differs from the at-expiry proﬁle depicted in Figure 31.1.A prior-to-expiry proﬁle is shown by
the broken curve in Figure 31.3.
The broken curve indicates the market price of the option minus the initial premium paid (27p
in this case).The net proﬁt shown by this prior-to-expiry proﬁle is the price that the trader could
sell the option for,minus the price (premium) that was paid for it.At stock prices below the option
strike price, the option price consists of time value only.Above the strike price, the option price
consists of both time and intrinsic values.

DETERMINANTS OF THE OPTION PRICE (PREMIUM)
The explanation of an option price divides into ascertaining intrinsic value and assessing the
inﬂuences on time value.The intrinsic value of a call option is equal to the stock price minus the
strike price of the option, with zero being the minimum intrinsic value. In principle, the option
price cannot fall below the intrinsic value.If the option price were below the intrinsic value,there
would be a guaranteed proﬁt from buying the option and immediately exercising it (and selling
the shares acquired). It would be irrational for anyone to sell an option for a price that is less than
its intrinsic value,since more could be obtained from exercising it.These points are elaborated in
the Boundary Conditions section at the end of this chapter.
The determination of time value is more complex.Major inﬂuences on time value include the
expected volatility of the stock price, the length of the period remaining to the expiry date, and
the extent to which the option is in or out of the money.
Time value can be looked upon as the price to be paid for (or the value of) the possibility of a
future increase in intrinsic value.The higher the expected share price volatility,the greater will be
the option price.An option on a volatile stock has a strong chance of acquiring intrinsic value at
some stage prior to expiry. Similarly, the probability of an option acquiring intrinsic value prior
to expiry rises with the length of time remaining to its expiry date.It can be seen from Table 31.1
that the options with the more distant expiry dates have the higher prices.
Time value is at its peak when the option is at-the-money and declines as the option moves either
in or out of the money.Out-of-the-money options have less time value than at-the-money options
because the share price has further to move before intrinsic value is acquired.In-the-money options
have less time value than at-the-money options since their prices contain intrinsic value, which is
vulnerable to a fall in the stock price, whereas at-the-money option prices contain no intrinsic
value.The risk that existing intrinsic value might be lost reduces the attractiveness of the option
and lowers its price.
PUT OPTIONS
A put option gives its holder the right,but not the obligation,to sell shares at a speciﬁed price prior
to, or on, the expiry date of the option.The holder of an option can exercise it, sell it, or allow it
to expire. It is worthwhile exercising an option – that is, exercising the right to sell shares at the
strike (exercise) price – only if the market price of the stock turns out to be lower than the strike
price. If the strike price is greater than the stock price, the option is said to have intrinsic value.
The intrinsic value would be equal to the excess of the strike price over the stock price.An option
without intrinsic value might simply be allowed to expire since its holder is not obliged to exercise
it,and presumably would not if the strike price were below the market price of the stock (it would
be better to sell the stock in the market).
Table 31.1 shows prices of BP put options.The price of BP shares was 568p.The months referred
to in Table 31.1 are expiry months.At any one time the buyer of a BP put option would have three
expiry dates from which to choose.When the April expiry date is reached,options with a January
expiry date would be introduced. Substantial movements of the stock price would invoke the
introduction of additional strike prices,so that there are strike prices either side of the stock price.
As a result the number of available strike prices would exceed two.

The Profit/Loss Profile at Expiry
In the case of traded stock options,the premium is usually payable in full on the day following the
purchase of the option. However, since the buyer is not obliged to exercise the option, and
presumably will not do so if it involves selling at less than the market price of the share,the premium
paid is the maximum loss the buyer of the option can incur. So, for example, a buyer of BP April
550p puts faces a maximum loss of 7p per share, which amounts to £70 per contract, since each
put option contract is for the sale of 1,000 shares.
The maximum proﬁt is limited only by the fact that stock prices cannot fall below zero. Since
a stock price can fall to zero,the net gain from a put option can be as much as the strike price minus
the premium paid.The buyer of April 550p BP puts stands to gain as much as 550p  7p per share.
This amounts to £5,430 per option contract.
Figure 31.4 shows the proﬁt/loss proﬁle of BP April 550p puts at expiry (i.e.on the day in April
upon which the option ceases to be capable of being exercised). If the stock price is 550p, or
higher, when the option expires the holder of the option records a net loss of 7p per share (£70

EXAMPLE 31.2
An investor buys a 550p put option on BP shares at a price of 7p per share when the share price
is 568p. Since each option contract relates to 1,000 shares, the cash outflow is £70.
Subsequently, the share price falls to 400p. The investor can exercise the right to sell at 550p.
There is a gross profit from the option of 150p (£1,500 per option contract). This gross profit
of 150p is the intrinsic value of the option. The net profit from the option must take account of
the 7p premium paid for the option. The net profit is thus 150p  7p  143p (£1,430 per option
contract). The investor has guaranteed that the effective selling price of the shares cannot fall
below 543p, this sum being the sale receipts of 550p minus the 7p premium paid for the option.

per option contract). If the stock price turns out to be less than 550p, there is a gross proﬁt to be
made by exercising the option.Exercising the option will allow the option holder to sell shares at
550p, while buying them at a lower price.This gross proﬁt from exercising the option minus the
premium paid for the option is the net proﬁt.If the stock price lies between 543p and 550p there
is a net loss, whereas below the break-even stock price of 543p there is a net proﬁt. (It can be
worthwhile exercising the option at stock prices between 543p and 549p since exercise would
realise some intrinsic value to set against the premium paid for the option.In other words,exercise
of the option would reduce the loss.)
The Profit/Loss Profile Prior to Expiry
Intrinsic value is the gross proﬁt to be made from exercising the option.At expiry an option would
have only intrinsic value,which could be equal to zero.Prior to expiry the option would have time
value as well as intrinsic value.The proﬁt/loss proﬁle of Figure 31.4 is based on intrinsic value only.
Since intrinsic value is the gross proﬁt to be made from exercising the option it will be zero at stock
prices at or above the strike price of 550p, whereas below 550p it will be equal to the difference
between the stock price and the strike price.The net proﬁt or loss at expiry is equal to the intrinsic
value minus the premium paid.
Prior to expiry the price of an option will exceed its intrinsic value.The difference is the time
value and is shown by the vertical distance between the prior-to-expiry proﬁle and the at-expiry
proﬁle in Figure 31.5.The price of an option is the sum of the intrinsic and time values.When an
option is exercised only the intrinsic value is obtained.When an option is sold both the intrinsic
and time values are obtained.
The prior-to-expiry proﬁle indicates the current market price of the option minus the price
that the present holder paid for it.As time passes,the prior-to-expiry proﬁle will tend to converge
on to the at-expiry proﬁle, with the convergence becoming complete as expiry is reached.
This convergence reflects the tendency for the time value of an option to decline with the

passage of time.This erosion of time value can be explained in terms of the likelihood of a substantial
increase in intrinsic value falling as the time available for the requisite stock price movement
declines.A second factor affecting time value is the expected volatility of the stock price.With high
volatility there is a relatively high chance of substantial gains in intrinsic value at some stage prior
to expiry. So, the greater is the expected volatility of a stock price, the greater will be the time
value of an option on that stock.
A third factor affecting time value is the relationship between the stock price and the strike price
of the option.Time value is at its highest when the stock price is equal to the strike price.When
the stock price is equal to the strike price,the option is said to be at-the-money.As the stock price
and strike price diverge, in either direction, time value declines.
When the stock price exceeds the strike price, the put option is said to be out-of-the-money.
A better price can be obtained by selling the shares in the market than by exercising the option.
Time value declines as the option moves further out of the money (in other words, as the stock
price rises), reﬂecting the decreasing likelihood of the stock price declining sufﬁciently to cause
exercise of the option to become proﬁtable.
When the stock price is lower than the strike price, the put option is said to be in-the-money.
A better price can be obtained by exercising the option than by selling the shares in the market.
The option has intrinsic value since there would be a pay-off from immediate exercise of the option.
Time value declines as the option becomes deeper in the money (i.e. as the stock price falls).
This can be understood in terms of there being an increasing amount of intrinsic value that is at
risk of being lost.The price of an in-the-money option contains the intrinsic value of that option.
The buyer of an in-the-money option bears the risk that a stock price rise will reduce intrinsic value,
whereas the buyer of an at-the-money option does not.The risk borne rises as the option becomes
deeper in the money.This risk is reﬂected in the time value.When there is more intrinsic value at
risk,the time value will be lower.The buyer of an at-the-money option pays a higher price for time
value than the buyer of an in-the-money option,with the price paid for time value declining as the
option becomes deeper in the money.
WRITING OPTIONS
For every buyer of an option there must be a seller.The seller of an option is often referred to as the
writer.The buyer of an option is said to have a long option position,whereas the writer of the option
is said to have a short position.The proﬁt/loss proﬁle of a short (written) option is the mirror image
of that of the long (bought) option.Proﬁts of the buyer must equal losses of the seller,and vice versa.
Figures 31.6 and 31.7 compare long and short positions for call and put options respectively.
The premium paid by the buyer obviously equals the premium received by the writer.The proﬁt
(loss) of the buyer will always equal the loss (proﬁt) of the writer.It should be noted that the buyer
of a call option has loss potential limited to the premium paid, but unlimited proﬁt potential.
Conversely,the writer of a call has a maximum proﬁt equal to the premium received,but unlimited
loss potential.In the case of put options,the buyer has a maximum loss equal to the premium,which
constitutes the maximum proﬁt of the writer.With put options the maximum proﬁt of the buyer
(maximum loss of the writer) occurs at a stock price of zero.
In the case of exchange-traded options, a long option position can be closed out by selling an
identical option; leaving no option position remaining. Likewise, a trader can close out a written
option by buying an identical option.Long and short positions in identical options cancel each other.

EXAMPLE 31.3
An investor writes a 550p call option on BP shares at a premium of 27p per share when the share
price is 568p. Since each option contract on LIFFE relates to 1,000 shares, the premium receipts
amount to £270. Subsequently, the share price rises to 650p. An option buyer might then exercise
the right to buy shares at 550p. If the option writer is assigned to the option buyer (assignment
of writers to meet the requirements of buyers who exercise is usually carried out on a random
basis), the writer must sell shares for 550p to the option buyer. The option writer may need to
buy shares at 650p in order to sell them at 550p. This entails a gross loss of 100p (the intrinsic
value of the option). Taking account of the option premium received indicates a net loss of 73p
(£730 per option contract). The loss of the option writer is equal to the profit of the option buyer.

EXERCISE 31.1
It is 6 January.The Lonrho share price is 662p. Lonrho March expiry option prices are:
(a) Calculate the intrinsic and the time value for both of the options.
(b) Suggest two alternative option strategies for proﬁting from a price rise. In each case what
would be the proﬁt, or loss, in the event of the share price reaching (i) 700p, and (ii) 800p,
by the expiry date of the option?
Answers
(a) Calls: intrinsic value 662  650  12p, time value 55  12  43p.
Puts: intrinsic value 0, time value 43p.
(b) Buy a call: at 700p there would be a net cash ﬂow of 700p  650p  55p  5p, i.e. a loss
of 5p.
at 800p there would be a net cash ﬂow of 800p  650p  55p  95p, i.e. a proﬁt of 95p.
Write a put: at 700p there would be a net cash ﬂow of 43p, i.e. a proﬁt of 43p.
at 800p there would be a net cash ﬂow of 43p, i.e. a proﬁt of 43p.
MARKET PRACTICES AND TERMS
All the call options on a particular underlying stock together constitute a class of options.Similarly,
all the puts on the same underlying stock would together comprise another class.Within each class
there will be a number of series. An option series is specific to a particular strike price and a
particular expiry month, as well as to a particular stock and call/put categorisation. So, for
example, 50p December calls and 60p March calls on the stock of ABC are two different series
within the same class (the class being ABC call options).There are often position limits to the
number of option contracts in any one class that can be held or written by any one individual or
organisation.
An option can be bought either to establish a new option position, or to close out an existing
(opposite) option position.An opening purchase is a transaction whereby the buyer of an option
becomes its holder;a closing purchase is a transaction in which a writer of an option buys an option
identical to the one previously written, whereupon the two positions are deemed to cancel each
other out.An opening sale is a transaction in which the seller of an option becomes its writer; a
closing sale involves the cancellation of a previously purchased option.

Premiums in respect of exchange-traded options are normally payable via the broker to the
clearing house on the morning following the day of the trade.Payment to the writer of the option
would come from the clearing house,which usually acts as a registrar for all open contracts.If the
holder of an option exercises it, the clearing house, using a random selection process, chooses a
writer who is then assigned to sell shares (in the case of calls) or buy shares (in the case of puts) to
or from the holder of the option at the strike price.
EXERCISE 31.2
The shares of Big Con plc stand at 110p.Put options with a strike price of 120p are priced at 14p.
(a) What is the intrinsic value of the options?
(b) What is the time value of the options?
(c) If the share price fell to 50p by the expiry date,what would be the proﬁt/loss for a holder and
for a writer of the option?
(d) What is the maximum loss for the writer of the option?
Answers
(a) 10p (120p  110p, strike price minus stock price).
(b) 4p (14p  10p, option price minus intrinsic value).
(c) The holder makes a proﬁt of 56p, which equals the loss of the writer (70p  14p, the new
price of the option minus the premium paid; the new price is the intrinsic value of 120p 
50p  70p).
(d) 106p (120p  14p, the loss if the stock price falls to zero which amounts to the intrinsic
value minus the premium received).

(c) If the September 90p options are held to expiry and the share price remains at 98p, what
would you expect the option prices to be at expiry?
Answers
(a) The put options have an intrinsic value of 100p-98p2p.The call options have no intrinsic
value; they are out-of-the-money.
(b) Write a 100p put option.
(c) The 90p call would have an intrinsic value of 98p-90p8p.At expiry time value is zero. So
the option price should be 8p.The 90p put would have expired out-of-the-money and hence
would have zero value at expiry.
BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
Arbitrage possibilities impose minimum and maximum values for options; these values are often
referred to as option price boundaries. For practical purposes, only the minimum values are of
signiﬁcance and hence the following account will focus exclusively on them.
It is useful to begin by considering American-style options, which are options that can be
exercised at any stage prior to expiry.The prices of such options should not fall below their intrinsic
values,otherwise the options could be purchased for less than their intrinsic values and immediately
exercised to realise the intrinsic values.The possibility of such arbitrage will tend to prevent option
prices being below the intrinsic values by inducing arbitrage-based purchases whenever option
prices fall below such levels.
STOCK OPTIONS

EXAMPLE 31.4
A share is priced at 100p and its 120p strike price put option is priced at 18p. The option price
is below its intrinsic value, which is 120p – 100p  20p. An arbitrage profit can be made by
simultaneously buying the share and the put option for a total expenditure of 100p  18p 
118p and immediately exercising the put. Upon exercise the share is sold for the strike price of
120p. Receipts exceed expenditures by 2p, which constitutes the arbitrage profit.
Any put option price below 20p provides an arbitrage opportunity, which involves buying the
option. The additional demand for the option will tend to pull up its price until it reaches 20p, at
which point arbitrage opportunities will cease.

EXAMPLE 31.5
If the call option strike price is 100p and the present value of 100p is 90p, a stock price of 95p
would imply a minimum option price of 5p. For example if the option price is 3p, it is possible
to make a profit of at least 2p by short selling the stock (i.e. borrowing the shares and selling 
them) for 95p while putting 90p on deposit and buying the options for 3p. There is a cash inﬂow
of 95p (share sale) and an outﬂow of 93p (90p deposit plus 3p option price). There is a net cash
inﬂow of 2p.
If the option is in-the-money on the expiry date (share price above 100p), the option is exercised
and the stock returned to the lender. There is a zero net cash ﬂow at expiry since the deposit pays
the 100p required for the share purchase resulting from exercise of the option. There is a profit
because of the original net cash inﬂow of 2p.
If the option expires out-of-the-money (share price below 100p), the stock can be bought for
less than 100p at expiry. In this case the profit will exceed the original 2p net cash inﬂow. The
deposit produces 100p but less than 100p is required for the purchase of the share (that has to
be returned to the stock lender). The difference between the share price and 100p accrues as
additional profit.
Since the arbitrage involves buying the underpriced option, it would tend to push the option price
up towards its minimum value. At the minimum value (5p), there would be no further arbitrage
opportunities.

Although the intrinsic value constitutes the minimum value in the case of American-style put
options, the minimum values of American-style call options tend to be higher than their intrinsic
values.This latter point can be appreciated by considering the case of European-style call options.
European-style options can be exercised on only one date:the expiry day.So a European-style
option,prior to its expiry date,cannot be exercised to realise the intrinsic value.So it is not possible
simply to buy the option and immediately exercise it for an arbitrage proﬁt.Instead,the arbitrage
is more complex in that the arbitrage transactions cannot all be completed in the present for an
instant proﬁt. Positions need to be held until the option expiry date.
STOCK OPTIONS
619

If the original option price were 5p, there would not be a guaranteed proﬁt from arbitrage. There
would be an initial zero net cash ﬂow: an inﬂow of 95p from the sale of the share and an outﬂow
of 90p  5p  95p for the deposit and purchase of the option. In the event of the option being
in-the-money on the expiry date, there would be an inﬂow of 100p from the deposit and an outﬂow
of 100p for the share purchase (by means of exercising the option).
In the case of a call option on a non-dividend paying stock, the arbitrage would involve selling
the stock short (borrowing stock and selling it), using most of the proceeds to put money on
deposit and buy a call option, and then waiting until the expiry date to exercise the option and
return the stock to the lender.The arbitrage proﬁt would be the excess of the initial proceeds of
the stock sale over the combined amount of the sum on deposit and the cost of the option. Since
the sum on deposit can earn interest up to the option expiry date, only the present value of the
option strike price needs to be deposited. So an absence of arbitrage opportunities requires that
the option price plus the present value of the strike price exceeds (or equals) the initial stock
price. So the minimum value of the option should be the stock price minus the present value of
the strike price (rather than the American-style case of stock price minus strike price), but if this
is negative, the minimum value is zero (options cannot have negative prices).Arbitrage tends to
prevent option prices falling below their minimum values, as demonstrated by Example 31.5. In
the event of an option price falling below its minimum value, arbitrage-induced purchases of
options would tend to push the option price towards the minimum value.
The excess of the stock price over the present value of the strike price is greater than the
intrinsic value of the option (deﬁned as stock price minus strike price).An American-style option
should not have a price lower than that of a European-style option since the American-style provides
everything offered by the European-style plus the facility of exercise before the expiry date.
Consequently, the minimum value of an American-style call option should not be lower than the
minimum value of a European-style call option.It follows that the minimum value of an American-
style call option is the excess of the stock price over the present value of the strike price (i.e. the
same as the minimum value of the European and greater than the intrinsic value).Again,if this value
is negative the minimum option price is zero.See Figure 31.8,in which K is the strike price of the
option, r is the risk-free interest rate, and T is the time to expiry of the option.

In the case of put options on non-dividend paying stocks, arbitrage possibilities determine a
minimum value of a European-style option below the intrinsic value (and hence below the
minimum value of the corresponding American-style option).The minimum value of the European-
style put option equals the present value of the strike price minus the stock price,and that boundary
is below the minimum value of the corresponding American-style put option (the strike price
minus the stock price). See Figure 31.9.
These analyses of boundary conditions can be readily amended to allow for dividends.
CONCLUSION
Another important form of derivative for investment managers is the stock option.Stock options
provide their holders with rights,but not obligations,to buy (call options) or to sell (put options)
shares at a specified price. Stock index options give notional rights to buy or sell stock index
portfolios at speciﬁed index values. Hedging by buying options is similar to buying insurance;
protection against adverse events is obtained.Adverse price (or stock index) movements are offset
by the options whilst advantageous movements are not offset by losses from options since there is
no obligation to exercise options.Options can also be used as means of enhancing income receipts
from portfolios since selling (writing) options entails the receipt of premiums; the premiums
received add to the dividend receipts from portfolios.
Investment managers, including institutional investors, may use options in conjunction with
portfolios of shares. Options could also be used as an investment class. Buying call options in
conjunction with holding money in bank deposits (or other money market investments) structures
options funds,which provide gains from rises in share prices whilst avoiding losses from price falls.

Chapter 32
Speculation with
stock options
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The gearing effects of call options.
2. Volatility trading.
THE EFFECTS OF GEARING
An option can be bought for a fraction of the price of the stock to which the option relates.This is
the gearing provided by an option. Options can be looked upon as either low risk or high risk
investments. In both cases the interpretation of risk is based upon the gearing effect offered by
options.The maximum loss from buying stock is the price of that stock, whereas the maximum
loss from buying a call option on that stock is the option premium. So buying a call option on
1,000 shares of stock can be seen as less risky than buying 1,000 shares of stock.
However, if the choice is between investing £1,000 in stock and spending £1,000 on stock
options, then the options are the more risky. Again, this arises from the gearing offered by the
options. Since the price of the option is a fraction of the price of the stock, percentage changes in
the option price are prone to be much greater than percentage changes in the stock price.Suppose
that XYZ stock is priced at 100p and a call option to buy at 100p is priced at 5p.A rise in the stock
price to 110p might plausibly cause a rise in the option price to 13p.The stock price rises by 10%,
whereas the option price rises by 160%.This arises from the gearing offered by the option.However,
the possibility of high percentage proﬁts is accompanied by potential large percentage losses.A fall
in the stock price to 90p might cause a fall in the option price to 3p.The 10% fall in the stock price
is accompanied by a 40% drop in the option price (and hence a 40% loss on the option).It may be
that a more substantial fall in the stock price,say to 65p,virtually eliminates the value of the option
so that a 35% fall in the stock price brings about a 100% fall in the option price.So if the choice is
between £1,000 invested in stock and £1,000 in options, the latter is the more risky.
The foregoing example involved an at-the-money option gaining just 8p in value as a result of
the stock price rising by 10p.One might think that the right to buy at 100p should rise in price by

10p as a result of a rise in the stock price from 100p to 110p. However, although there is an
additional 10p in intrinsic value,the other component of the option premium,time value,falls as
the stock price moves away from the option strike price (the initial option price of 5p was entirely
time value;at the stock price of 110p the time value of the option is 3p).The change in the option
price as a proportion of the change in the stock price is known as the delta of the option (in the
present example the delta is (13  5)/10  0.8).

(iii) What would be the return from using options to gain exposure to £5,000 worth of shares
whilst keeping the rest of the £5,000 uninvested?
(b) If by the expiry date of the options the share price had fallen to 450p, what would be the

(iii) £5,000 worth of shares is 1,000 shares. Since each option contract relates to 1,000
shares, one option contract is bought.The cost of a contract would be 12.5p  1,000
 £125. Its value rises to £500 as a result of the increase in the option price.There is a
gain of £375.The return on the £5,000 is thus:

(ii) If the share price were 450p on the expiry date of the options, the options would be
worthless.The whole of the £5,000 invested in options would be lost.The return would
be 100%.
(iii) The £125 spent on the option contract would have been lost,but the uninvested £4,875
remains.The return is:
£4,875/£5,000  0.975
0.975  1  0.025, i.e. 2.5% (12.5/500)
It can be seen that strategy (ii) has the highest risk and strategy (iii) the lowest risk. Options
can be seen as either high risk or low risk investments according to whether the objective is
to use options to match the expenditure on shares,or to match the number of shares to which
the investor is exposed.
The gearing effect of options relates to the high percentage proﬁts and losses, relative to
shares, that arise because options cost much less than shares.The results above show that this
gearing means that investing a speciﬁc sum of money in options,rather than shares,produces
much greater risk (higher potential proﬁts and losses). However using options to gain an
exposure equivalent to that of a share holding may entail lower risk,relative to the shares.The
most that can be lost using options are the premiums paid, whereas the entire value of a
shareholding could be lost.
VOLATILITY TRADING AND THE COLLAPSE OF BARINGS BANK
Speculation with options may be based on forecasts of the direction of share price movements,and
could take advantage of the gearing provided by options. Speculation can also be based on views
about future share price volatility. Proﬁting from such views involves volatility trading.A simple
volatility trading strategy is the straddle.
A long straddle is the simultaneous purchase of a call and a put on the same stock, at the same
strike price and for the same expiry month (see Figure 32.1).A short straddle is the simultaneous
sale of two such options (see Figure 32.2).A trader buying a straddle is taking the view that volatility
will be high in the future,whereas the seller of a straddle takes the view that volatility will be low.
Suppose that 100p call options are 2p,while 100p put options are 3p.A long straddle could be
constructed by simultaneously buying a 100p call and a 100p put so as to produce the proﬁt/loss
proﬁle illustrated by Figure 32.3.The holder of the long straddle depicted in the ﬁgure would
make net proﬁts if the stock price moved outside the range 95p–105p.The maximum loss would
be the sum of the premiums paid,5p.This loss would be incurred if the stock price moved to,and
stayed at, 100p.
A short straddle could be structured by means of writing a 100p call and simultaneously writing
a 100p put.The resulting proﬁt/loss proﬁle is illustrated in Figure 32.4.The seller of the short
straddle shown in the ﬁgure will make a proﬁt if the stock price remains within the range
95p105p.The maximum proﬁt of 5p, equal to the sum of the premiums received, would be
made in the event of the stock price moving to, and stabilising at, 100p.

Thus the holder of a long straddle hopes for high volatility,whereas the holder of a short straddle
desires low volatility.
The use of short straddles played a part in the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Baring’s
derivatives trader in Singapore,Nick Leeson (the ‘Rogue Trader’upon whom the ﬁlm of that name
was based),took large unauthorised derivatives positions,which he concealed from the managers
of the bank.These included substantial long positions in Nikkei 225 stock index futures, short
positions in Japanese government bond futures, short Nikkei 225 call options, and short Nikkei
225 put options.The options positions amounted to short straddles.The long stock index futures
stood to proﬁt from rises in the Japanese stock market, and lose from falls.The short straddle
Figure 32.1
Figure 32.2
Figure 32.3

stood to proﬁt from a stable market,and to lose from movements in either direction.Unfortunately
for Leeson and Barings Bank, the Nikkei 225 fell heavily.There were losses on the stock index
futures and the short put options.The accumulated losses exceeded the capital of Barings Bank,
which was rendered insolvent. Barings Bank was subsequently sold to ING for the sum of £1.
OTHER VOLATILITY TRADING STRATEGIES
Use of volatility trading strategies such as the straddle is not necessarily based on making proﬁts
from stock price movements. It may be based on anticipated changes in market expectations of
volatility. In Figure 32.5 the broken curve represents the proﬁts/losses on the straddle prior to
expiry.The vertical distance between the broken curve and the unbroken lines (which depict the
proﬁt/loss at expiry) is the sum of the time values of the two options.The time value is sensitive
to changes in market expectations of stock price volatility.An increase in expected volatility would
raise the time value and move the broken line up (vice versa for a decrease).The long straddle of
Figure 32.5 may be constructed with a view to proﬁting from a rise in market expectations of
volatility, which would cause the broken curve to rise.
The change in the price of an option (or combination of options), resulting from a change in
the market expectation of stock price volatility,is referred to as the vega (or kappa) of the option.

Another sensitivity of importance is the delta of the option (or combination of options).The delta
of an option (or combination of options) is the change in the price of the option (or combination
of options) resulting from a 1p change in the stock price.In the case of stock index options,it would
be the option price change resulting from one index point change in the stock index.
Volatility trading strategies are often structured to have deltas as close as possible to zero.
This is to ensure that the exposure is to changes in market expectations of volatility rather than
to changes in the stock price. Long call options have positive deltas (the option price rises with
stock price increases) and long put options have negative deltas (the option price falls with
increases in the stock price).As a result the deltas tend to offset each other. For at-the-money
options the call delta is about 0.5 and the put delta is about 0.5. So combining call and put
options, which are both close to being at-the-money, brings the net delta to about zero.A zero
delta entails no net option price change as a result of a small movement of the stock price.
The straddle is not the only strategy for trading (speculating) on expectations of stock price
volatility.There are many other strategies,two of which are strangles and butterﬂies.A long strangle
is constructed by buying a low strike price put option together with a high strike price call option.
A short strangle entails writing the options. Figure 32.6 illustrates a long strangle.
A short butterﬂy can be structured by writing a low strike price call option,buying two middle
strike price call options,and writing a high strike price call option.Alternatively it can be constructed
by means of buying and selling put options in the same order.Figure 32.7 illustrates a short butterﬂy.
The long straddle exhibits the highest maximum loss, since the options are close to being at-
the-money (therefore they have high time value).
The long strangle has a lower maximum loss,since the options are out-of-the-money (therefore
they have relatively low time value).However the range of stock prices over which losses occur is
greater than in the case of the straddle.
The short butterﬂy has lower loss potential than the long straddle or long strangle, but has
restricted proﬁt potential.

The current FTSE 100 stands at 5,480.Using the data from the table,and with a view to keeping
the delta of the strategy as close as possible to zero, construct (a) a short straddle, (b) a short
strangle, and (c) a long butterﬂy.What are the maximum proﬁts and losses? What are the break-
even index values? (d) Compare the three strategies.
Answers
(a) In order to keep delta as close as possible to zero,the options that are closest to being at-the-
money should be used for the straddle. So 5,475 strike price calls and puts are written.
The maximum proﬁt is 49 index points (£490 per pair of option contracts),which is realised
if the index is 5,475 when the options expire.The maximum loss on the downside is 5,426
index points (£54,260 per pair of option contracts),which would be realised if the index fell
to a value of zero.There is no maximum loss on the upside since there is no upper limit to the
index.The break-even values of the index are 5,426 and 5,524 (5,475 /49).
(b) In order to ensure that the delta of the strangle is as close as possible to zero,the option strike
prices should be approximately equal distance from the current index. A 5,425 strike put
option, and a 5,525 strike call option, are written.

The maximum proﬁt is 17 index points (£170 per combination of option contracts).This
maximum proﬁt would be received if the options were to expire at an index between 5,425
and 5,525.The maximum loss on the downside is 5,408 index points (£54,080),which would
be incurred in the event of the value of the index falling to zero.The maximum loss on the
upside is unlimited.The break-even index levels are 5,408 (5,425  17) and 5,542 (5,525
 17).
(c) Construction of a long butterfly entails buying a 5,425 call, writing two 5,475 calls, and
buying a 5,525 call.Alternatively a 5,425 put is bought, two 5,475 puts are written, and a
5,525 put is bought.The net expenditure using the calls is 15.5 (68  31  31  9.5),
whereas the net expenditure using the puts is 17.5 (7.5  18  18  46).The butterﬂy is
structured using call options because the lower cost enhances proﬁts.
The maximum proﬁt is 34.5 index points,which is obtained at an index level of 5,475.The
maximum loss is 15.5 index points, obtained below 5,425 and above 5,525.The break-even
index levels are 5,440.5 and 5,509.5.
(d) The straddle provides the highest maximum proﬁt,the strangle entails the highest likelihood
of proﬁt, and the butterﬂy limits the size of prospective losses.

CONCLUSION
Although the main economic function of ﬁnancial derivatives is probably hedging, most trades
may be for the purpose of speculation.Speculators accept risk in the anticipation of making proﬁt.
The risk accepted by speculators is the risk that hedgers want to insure against.In aggregate hedgers
transfer their risk to speculators.So speculators are vital to the successful operation of derivatives
markets.
Whereas there is considerable speculative trading in both futures and options markets,
speculators in options markets have more dimensions available for speculation. In particular, in
options markets changes in stock price volatility can be traded as well as the direction of stock price
change.An options speculator can take a position not only on the direction of stock price movement
but also on whether market expectations of volatility will rise or fall.
This additional dimension of trading is important for another function of derivatives markets,
which is discovery.Both futures and options markets can be used for price discovery.The price that
is discovered is the future price expected by market participants, and from this a corresponding
spot price can be inferred.Options also allow the discovery of market expectations of stock price
volatility.An options price reﬂects the market participants’ expectation of stock price volatility,
which is known as implied volatility.Chapters 36,37,and 38 on option pricing show how fair prices
of options can be deduced from pricing models, wherein the expectation of stock price volatility
is one of the values to be put into the model. Such models can be reversed so that instead of
expectations of volatility being used to ascertain fair option prices,the actual option prices are used
to deduce the market expectation of stock price volatility.

Chapter 33
Hedging with options
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Hedging the value of a shareholding with options.
2. The relative merits of long and short option positions for hedging.
3. Hedging anticipated purchases of stock.
4. Vertical spreads.
5. Option cylinders.
Call options provide the right to buy shares at a particular price (the strike price), and put options
give the right to sell at a strike price. Someone who is at risk from a price change can use options
to offset that risk.A call option can be seen as a means of establishing an upper limit to the purchase
price of a share (if the market price exceeds the strike price, then the option may be exercised in
order to buy at the strike price).A put option provides a minimum selling price (exercise of the right
to sell,at the strike price,might occur in the event of the market price being below the strike price).
So options can be regarded as means of insurance against adverse price movements.Call options
provide insurance against share price rises since the price to be paid cannot exceed the strike price.
Put options provide insurance against share price falls since the lowest price that could be received
is the strike price.
HEDGING THE VALUE OF A SHAREHOLDING
Consider a holder of shares who seeks protection from a fall in the share price.The protection can
be obtained by buying a put option. Proﬁts from the option offset losses on the stock. However,
proﬁts from the rise in the stock price are not offset by losses from the option (apart from the
premium paid for the option). So gains are made from a rise in the stock price.
A put option provides a lower limit to the selling price for a block of 1,000 shares.Table 33.1
shows the prices of BP put options when the price of BP shares was 568p.A holder of 1,000 BP

shares would be able to ensure that the value of the stockholding could not fall below £5,500
(1,000  £5.50) by buying a 550p put option.The option would provide the right to sell 1,000
BP shares at 550p.If the investor chooses an option that expires in April,the cost of providing such
protection until the April expiry date would be £70 (1,000  7p). Of course, should the stock
price remain in excess of 550p,the shareholder would not exercise the right to sell at 550p.In such
a situation a better share price is obtained by selling in the stock market.
Although the shareholder has the right to exercise a put option and thereby sell shares at 550p,
he or she is more likely to sell rather than exercise the option if the share price falls below 550p.
This can be understood by considering the elements that make up an option price.The price of an
option can be divided into its intrinsic value and its time value.The intrinsic value represents the
pay-off that could be obtained by immediately exercising the option. For example, an April 600p
put option has an intrinsic value of 32p when the stock price is 568p since, by exercising the
option, shares can be sold at 32p more than the price at which they can be bought.The difference
between the option price and the intrinsic value is termed time value, which is 3p in the case of
the April 600p put options.Time value can be regarded as a payment for the possibility that intrinsic
value will increase prior to the date on which the option expires, i.e. the date beyond which it
cannot be exercised. If a stockholder exercises an option, only the intrinsic value is received,
whereas if the option is sold, both the intrinsic and time values are obtained. It thus makes sense
to sell an option in preference to exercising it.
In Table 33.1 the 550p puts have a strike price below the market price of the stock.Therefore,
they offer no pay-off upon exercise and have zero intrinsic value.Their prices consist entirely of
time value. Put options with strike prices below the market price of the stock are said to be out-
of-the-money.When the stock price is equal to the strike price, the option is said to be at-the-
money. Put options with strike prices above the stock price (the only ones with intrinsic value)
are termed in-the-money.
Long Versus Short Option Positions
Hedging against a price fall can be carried out by means of buying a put option, and protection
against a price rise can be obtained from the purchase of a call option.Alternatively, a call option
might be written (sold) as a means of protection from a price fall or a put option written as a
means of hedging against a price rise.Writing options is the better approach if the price change is
relatively modest,whereas buying options is the more effective strategy in the event of a substantial

movement in the price of the stock. Figure 33.1 compares the purchase of a put option with the
sale of a call option.The purchase of a put option constitutes a long put,and the sale of a call option
provides a short call position.
In the example illustrated by Figure 33.1, the two options have the same strike price of 100p.
The put is priced at 5p and the call at 6p.The long put provides protection against a fall in the stock
price below 100p but,considering the premium (option price paid) of 5p,the put option does not
confer a net advantage over an unhedged position until the stock price has fallen below 95p. So
the long put is beneﬁcial only in the event of a substantial price fall.
By writing the call for 6p, the option price (premium) is received and that receipt can be seen
as providing downside protection.A stock price fall from 100p to 94p would leave the hedger no
worse off since the loss of 6p on the stock would be offset by the proceeds of selling the option.
However,the downside protection is constant in money terms and stock prices below 94p would
entail a net loss. Of course, stock prices above 94p would entail a net proﬁt. So the short call is
advantageous in the case of a modest stock price fall.
The short call is superior to the long put down to a stock price of 89p.This is demonstrated
in Figure 33.1. The net proﬁt from the put option does not exceed that of the call option
until the stock price has fallen sufﬁciently to generate an intrinsic value for the put option of
5p (to offset the put premium) plus 6p (to match the call premium). So the short option position
is superior to the long option position until the stock price has moved by the sum of the two option
premiums. In this case, a hedger seeking protection from a price fall but anticipating a fall of
less than 11p would prefer the short call, whereas a hedger fearing a greater fall would buy a put
option.
Writing call options whilst holding the respective shares can alternatively be seen as a means
of enhancing portfolio returns. Lofthouse (2001: 418) expresses this point as a potential sales
pitch to an investor:

HEDGING WITH OPTIONS
635
Are there any stocks in your portfolio that you think are fairly valued? If there are, you
must be indifferent between holding them or selling them.Imagine a strategy that,if the
price of a stock remains much the same or falls, gives you an extra income by way of
premium  it’s effectively another dividend. If the stock rises and you are forced to sell
the stock to meet a call, and you said you were indifferent whether you held it or not,
the premium effectively gets you a higher selling price.
The drawback is the limited ability to gain from a rise in the share price.
EXERCISE 33.1
It is 14 November 2005. FTSE 100 Index Options have the prices shown in the table.
The FTSE 100 stands at 5,480.
(a) How can long and short option positions be used to hedge a portfolio of shares against a
market fall (with a view to holding the option contracts to their expiry date)? What would
affect the choice between the long and short option positions?
(b) What are the implications of having expectations of volatility that differ from the implied
volatilities?
(c) Assuming that the portfolio of shares moves in line with the FTSE 100 (and that the number
of option contracts matches the size of the portfolio) what would be the effect of a 20% fall
in the FTSE 100, by the option expiry date, on the hedged portfolio?
(d) What would be the effect of a 20% rise in the FTSE 100?
(e) Comment on the results.
(f) What would be the effect of a 20-point fall in the FTSE 100,by the option expiry date,on the
hedged portfolio?
(g) What would be the effect of a 20-point rise in the FTSE 100?
(h) Comment on the results.
Answers
(a) Option positions that would provide gains in the event of a market fall are required. Put
options could be bought or call options sold. If necessary, the numbers of option contracts
would be weighted by the beta of the portfolio.As to the choice between the long put and the
Table 33.A
Strike price
Calls
Puts

short call,the decision is likely to be based on the prospective size of the market decline.The
short call is better for relatively small market falls of up to 31  18  49 index points (the
sum of the option premiums).The long put would be better as a hedge against declines greater
than 49 index points.
(b) If the investor believes that the expectations of market volatility implied by an option price is
too high, the investor would regard the option as being overpriced.This would deter the
investor from buying the option,but would encourage a sale.If the implied volatility were seen
as too low, the option would be regarded as underpriced.This would favour a purchase but
discourage a sale. So considerations of expected market volatility could inﬂuence the choice
between long and short option positions.
(c) A 20% fall in the market would reduce the FTSE 100 to 4,384.The long put would provide
a pay-off of 5,475  4,384  1,091,and a proﬁt of 1,091  18  1,073.Adding this proﬁt
to the new index gives 4,384  1,073  5,457.Hedging by means of buying the put option
limits the loss to 5,480  5,457  23 index points.There would be a loss of 1,096 from the
fall in the market offset by a proﬁt of 1,073 on the option, resulting in a net loss of 1,096 
1,073  23 index points.
Writing the call option would have yielded a premium receipt of 31 index points.When
added to the new index the result is 4,384  31  4,415.Hedging by writing the call option
has limited the loss to 5,480  4,415  1,065 index points.There would be a loss of 1,096
from the fall in the market offset by a proﬁt of 31 from the option resulting in a net loss of
1,096  31  1,065 index points.
(d) A 20% rise in the FTSE 100 would take it to 6,576; a rise of 1,096 index points. If the long
put had been used as the hedge,a premium of 18 index points would have been paid with the
result that the effective rise in the index would have been limited to 6,576  5,480  18 
1,078 index points.There would be a gain of 1,096 index points from the rise in the market
offset by a loss of 18 index points from the option leaving a net gain of 1,096  18  1,078
index points.
If the short call had been used, there would have been a loss of 6,576  5,475  31 
1,070 from the option. So the gain would have been limited to 6,576  5,480  1,070 
26 index points.There would be a gain of 1,096 index points from the rise in the market offset
by a loss of 1,070 from the option resulting in a net gain of 1,096  1,070  26 index points.
(e) Since large movements in the market occurred, the long put was superior to the short call
both when the market fell and when it rose.
(f) A 20-point fall in the market would reduce the FTSE 100 to 5,460.The long put would provide
a pay-off of 5,475  5,460  15, and a loss of 18  15  3. Subtracting this loss from the
new index gives 5,460  3  5,457. Hedging by means of buying the put option entails a
loss of 5,480  5,457  23 index points. There would be a loss from the option
(3) in addition to the loss from the fall in the market (20).
Writing the call option would have yielded a receipt of 31 index points.When added to the
new index the result is 5,460  31  5,491.Hedging by writing the call option has provided
STOCK OPTIONS
636

HEDGING WITH OPTIONS
637
a proﬁt of 5,491  5,480  11 index points.The premium received from writing the option
(31) would exceed the loss from the fall in the market (20) by 11 index points.
(g) A 20-point rise in the FTSE 100 would take it to 5,500. If the long put had been used as the
hedge, a premium of 18 index points would have been paid with the result that the effective
rise in the index would have been limited to 5,500  5,480  18  2 index points.The 20
index point gain from the market rise would be offset by an 18 index point loss on the option.
If the short call had been used, there would have been a loss on the option of 5,500 
5,475  25 index points from the rise in the index offset by the 31 index points received from
writing the call giving a net proﬁt from the option of 6 index points. So the rise in the index
would have been enhanced by 6 index points to 5,506 index points.The effective rise in the
index is 26 index points.There would be a proﬁt from the option (6) in addition to the rise
in the market (20).
(h) Since small movements in the market occurred, the short call was superior to the long put
both when the market fell and when it rose.
HEDGING ANTICIPATED PURCHASES
Options can be used to hedge intended purchases of stocks. Suppose it is 30 March and that a
portfolio manager intends to buy BP shares with funds expected to become available in early April.
The current price of BP shares is 568p and the portfolio manager wishes to avoid the risk of having
to pay a much higher price.The prices of BP call options are shown in Table 33.1.
The portfolio manager could buy April 600p call options at 5p. Each option contract provides
the right, but not the obligation, to buy 1,000 BP shares at a price of 600p per share.The price of
the option is 5p per share, which amounts to £50 (5p  1,000) per option contract.
If when the stock was purchased in April the price were 650p, the portfolio manager could
exercise the options and thereby buy stock at 600p.This represents a saving of 50p per share at a
premium cost of 5p per share: a net beneﬁt of 45p per share.The effective purchase price would
be 605p (strike price plus premium paid).
By exercising an option the hedger obtains its intrinsic value, which is the difference between
the stock price and the option’s strike price. However the price of an option includes time value
in addition to the intrinsic value.If the hedger sold the option,the time value as well as the intrinsic
value would be received.The time value might be 2p and hence the sale price of the option would
be 52p.The portfolio manager would have bought options for 5p and sold them for 52p.There
would have been a proﬁt of 47p per share rather than the 45p proﬁt (intrinsic value minus premium)
obtained from exercising the options.The effective price of the shares becomes 603p (650p  47p).
The shares are bought in the stock market for 650p (rather than being acquired by exercising the
options) and are partially ﬁnanced by the 47p proﬁt from the options with the result that the net
cost is 650p  47p  603p per share.
If the stock price were 600p or less at the time the stock was purchased,the options held would
have no intrinsic value and therefore could not be proﬁtably exercised. However, they would still
have time value. For example if the share price were still 568p, the April 600p call options might

be selling at 2p.The options would have been bought for 5p and could be sold for 2p.The net cost
of 3p (i.e. £30 per contract covering 1,000 shares) compares favourably with the net cost of 5p
(£50) incurred if the options were allowed to expire.
EXERCISE 33.2
A fund manager has a portfolio worth £100 million.The portfolio beta is 1.2.Both the FTSE 100
and the FTSE 100 futures are currently 5,000.FTSE 100 futures and options are based on £10 per
index point. FTSE 100 at-the-money call options are priced at 20, and at-the-money put options
cost 18.
(a) If the fund manager wants to hedge half the portfolio using futures,how many contracts should
be used? Should they be bought or sold?
(b) If the futures index subsequently falls by 300 points, what is the proﬁt or loss on the futures?
(c) What could cause the futures hedge to be imperfect?
(d) How could the hedge be carried out with options?
(e) If the FTSE 100 stands at 4,700 when the options expire, what is the proﬁt or loss on the
options?
(f) What are the merits of options, relative to futures, as instruments for hedging portfolios of
shares?
Answers
(a) The market exposure of the portfolio is 1.2  £100 million  £120 million.Half of this value
is to be hedged by futures.
£60,000,000/(5,000  £10)  1,200 futures contracts.
To hedge against a stock price fall, futures contracts should be sold.
(b) The proﬁt per futures contract is 300  £10  £3,000.The proﬁt on 1,200 contracts is
£3,000  1,200  £3,600,000.
(c) Basis risk, the indivisibility of contracts, the instability of beta, and the existence of non-
systematic risk.
(d) Either stock index put options are bought, or stock index call options are written.
(e) An at-the-money put option would have an intrinsic value of 300 points.The proﬁt per contract
would be 300  18  282 points,i.e.£2,820 per contract (£2,820  1,200  £3,384,000).
The proﬁt on the written calls equals the premium received,i.e.20 points or £200 per contract
(£200  1,200  £240,000 on 1,200 contracts).

(f) An advantage of buying options is that proﬁt opportunities are preserved;in this example the
fund manager continues to be able to proﬁt from rising share prices if the hedging is carried
out by buying put options.A disadvantage of buying options is that a premium (price) must
be paid for the options.
An advantage of writing options is that a premium is received.A disadvantage of hedging
by writing options is that protection is only partial;writing options is suitable as a hedge against
small index falls but not large falls since the protection is limited to the premium received.In
the present example,writing calls protects the portfolio against a fall in the index of up to 20
points (i.e.down to 4980),but does not provide an offset against any further falls in the index.
SWITCHING BETWEEN STOCKS WITHOUT TRADING IN STOCKS
There may be occasions when a switch between shares is intended to be very temporary,needs to
be carried out extremely quickly, or without affecting expected dividend receipts. In such
circumstances there may be advantages in using an options strategy either as a replacement for,or
as a means of changing the timing of,the switch.The options strategy would entail constructing a
synthetic short position in the stock to be sold and simultaneously establishing a synthetic long
position in the stock to be purchased.The synthetic short position eliminates the exposure to the
stock that is currently held,whilst the synthetic long position creates an exposure to the stock that
the fund manager wants to own.
A synthetic short position is created by buying put options and writing (selling) an equal number
of call options with the same strike price and expiry date.The construction of a synthetic short
position (short synthetic) is illustrated by Figure 33.2.
The synthetic short position could be looked upon as guaranteeing the sale of shares at the
strike price. Consider the case of European-style options (i.e. options that can be exercised only
on the expiry date). If the share price at expiry is less than the strike price, the put option is

exercised and the shares are thereby sold at the strike price. If the share price at expiry exceeds
the strike price the holder of the call option would exercise the right to buy shares at the strike
price, and hence the writer of the call option (the holder of the short synthetic) sells at the strike
price. In either case shares are sold at the strike price. Conversely a synthetic long position could
be seen as ensuring the purchase of shares at the strike price.
A synthetic long position is constructed by means of buying call options and writing
(selling) an equal number of put options with the same strike price and expiry date. In
terms of market exposure the synthetic long position can be regarded as equivalent to buying
the stock. The construction of a synthetic long position (long synthetic) is illustrated by
Figure 33.3.
If the stock price on the option expiry date were above the option strike price, the call option
would be exercised to buy shares at the strike price.If the stock price were below the strike price,
the holder of the put option would exercise the right to sell shares with the result that the option
writer (the holder of the synthetic long position) buys shares at the strike price. So the structure
is equivalent to a forward purchase of shares at the strike price.Whatever happens to the share price,
shares are bought at the strike price on the option expiry date.The construction of a synthetic is
not dependent upon holding the options until the expiry date.The synthetic position exists even
if the intention is to close out the options before the expiry date.
The possibility of constructing synthetic positions in stocks using options is potentially a source
of considerable ﬂexibility for fund managers.Switches between stocks can be achieved very quickly.
The synthetics may subsequently be unwound as actual stock trades are undertaken,or as the need
for a short-term switch disappears.The achievement of a switch without affecting dividend receipts
in the near future would be another potential motivation for using the synthetics strategy.The
construction of a short synthetic position in a stock also allows a trader to proﬁt from a decline in
the stock price, and the construction of a long synthetic can be a means of acquiring a highly
leveraged exposure to a stock.

EXAMPLE 33.1
Suppose that a fund manager wants to switch from Sainsbury’s shares to Tesco shares when
Sainsbury’s shares stand at 521p and Tesco shares at 563p. The Sainsbury’s option prices for
the nearby month (earliest expiry date) are as shown in the table.
The Tesco option prices for the earliest expiry date are as shown in the second table.
The price of a synthetic position in shares is equal to:
(PV) Strike price  Call price  Put price.
The present value of the strike price [(PV) Strike price] is given by
K/(1  rt)
where K is the strike price, r the interest rate, and t the time to expiry of the option as a fraction
of a year. Interest rates at the time were 7.5%. Sainsbury’s options had 58 days to expiry; Tesco
options had 13 days to expiry.
The synthetic price of Sainsbury’s shares was:
[550/(1  {0.075  0.159})]  17  46.5  514 p.
The synthetic price of Tesco shares was:
[550/(1  {0.075  0.036})]  21  6  563.5 p.
The fund manager could construct a synthetic short position in Sainsbury’s shares, thereby
removing the exposure to Sainsbury’s shares. Simultaneously a synthetic long position in Tesco
shares is created, thereby obtaining an exposure to Tesco shares.

Whilst the price of the Tesco synthetic is close to the actual share price (563.5p as against 563p),
the price of the Sainsbury’s synthetic is signiﬁcantly lower than the actual share price (514p as
against 521p). This could be explained in terms of a dividend on Sainsbury’s shares, prior to the
option expiry date, being expected. Indeed this could provide the reason for using the synthetics
rather than immediately trading in shares. Switching exposure by means of the synthetic enables
the fund manager to retain the right to the forthcoming Sainsbury’s dividend. Subsequent to the
receipt of the dividend Sainsbury’s shares might be sold, Tesco shares purchased, and the synthetics
unwound. The synthetics would have been used to achieve the switch between the stocks whilst
retaining the right to the forthcoming dividend.
EXERCISE 33.3
It is 14 November 2005. FTSE 100 Index Options, which expire on 28 November, have prices as
shown in the table.
The FTSE 100 stands at 5,480.
(a) How can a synthetic short futures position be used to hedge a portfolio of shares against
a market fall?
(b) Assuming that the portfolio of shares moves in line with the FTSE 100 (and that the numbers
of option contracts match the size of the portfolio), what would be the effect of a 20% fall in
the FTSE 100, by the option expiry date, on the hedged portfolio?
(c) What would be the effect of a 20% rise in the FTSE 100?
(d) Comment on the results.
Answers
(a) Option positions that would provide gains in the event of a market fall are required. Put
options would be bought,and call options sold,to produce a synthetic short futures position.
If necessary,the numbers of option contracts would be weighted by the beta of the portfolio.
(b) A 20% fall in the market would reduce the FTSE 100 to 4,384.The long put would provide
a pay-off of 5,475  4,384  1,091. Buying the put and simultaneously writing the call
provides the pay-off of 1,091 from the long put and there would have been a net premium
receipt of 31  18  13 index points. So the outcome would be 4,384  1,091  13 

5,488 index points.There is no loss from the market fall;there is a net gain of 5,488  5,480
 8 index points.
(c) A 20% rise in the FTSE 100 would take it to 6,576,a rise of 1,096 index points.There would
have been a loss of 6,576  5,475  31  1,070 index points from the written call option.
If the long put and short call had been used together,the loss of 1,070 on the call option would
have been incurred.Additionally a premium of 18 index points would have been paid for the
put option. So the net rise in the index would have been limited to 6,576  5,480  1,070
 18 8 index points.
(d) Use of the long put and short call together (the synthetic short futures position) virtually
eliminated any movement of the FTSE 100.The short synthetic guarantees an index value of
5,488, which represents an 8-point gain relative to the original index level of 5,480.
VERTICAL SPREADS
Vertical spreads provide a strategy for hedging with options at a reduced cost.The cost reduction
is achieved by the sale of options alongside purchases.The sales receipts offset the costs of purchase.
Vertical spreads involve the simultaneous buying and selling of options on the same underlying share
or stock index for the same expiry month but with different strike prices. Figure 33.4 illustrates
a bull call spread: bull because it proﬁts from a price rise; a call spread because it is constructed
from call options. For clarity of exposition the situation on the expiry date of the options will be
considered; in that way the complexity added by time value can be ignored.
The FTSE 100 Index is 4,700.
The FTSE 100 4,725 call is bought at a price of 60 index points.
The FTSE 100 4,825 call is written at a price of 20 index points.
The net price is 60  20  40 index points (at £10 per index point this amounts to £400).

Below 4,725 neither option is exercised: the loss is the net premium of 40 index points.The
maximum proﬁt occurs above 4,825.The proﬁt from exercising the 4,725 option,minus the loss
from exercise of the 4,825 option and minus the initial net premium of 40,equals 60 index points.
(If both options are exercised, the intrinsic value of the long call minus the intrinsic value of the
short call is 4,825  4,725  100.)
Above 4,825 the additional proﬁts from the long 4,725 call are offset by losses from the short
4,825 call.The net proﬁt remains at 60 index points since further gains from the long option,
produced by rises in the index, are offset by increased losses from the written option.
Figure 33.5 illustrates a bear put spread:bear because it proﬁts from a price fall and put because
it is constructed using put options.
The FTSE 100 Index is 4,700.
The FTSE 100 4,725 put is bought at a price of 65 index points.
A FTSE 100 4,625 put is written at a price of 25 index points.
At stock indices above 4,725 neither option would be exercised and the investor makes a net
loss equal to the balance of the premiums: 65  25  40 index points.As the stock index falls
below 4,725,there is a pay-off from exercising the purchased 4,725 put option (the pay-off equals
the intrinsic value).This pay-off increases until it reaches 100 index points, when the stock index
is 4,625.The net gain at 4,625,taking account of the net premium,is 100  40  60 index points.
If the FTSE 100 falls below 4,625,the 4,625 put will be exercised.Thus as the stock index falls
below 4,625,the additional gains from exercising the 4,725 put are cancelled by losses on the 4,625
put leaving the net proﬁt at a constant 60 index points. Below 4,625 both options are exercised.
The pay-off from the 4,725 option, minus the intrinsic value of the 4,625 option and minus the
net premium paid (40), equals the net proﬁt of 60 index points.

In addition to the bull call spreads and bear put spreads,there are bull put spreads and bear call
spreads.Writing a put option with a high strike price (and high premium) and buying a put option
with a low strike price (and consequent low premium) creates a bull put spread.A bear call spread
involves selling a call option with a low strike price (and high premium) and buying a call option
with a high strike price (and low premium).
Vertical spreads provide a relatively low cost means of hedging, but the extent of the hedge is
limited. Protection is provided only within a price range. For example in Figure 33.4 there is no
upside protection beyond an index level of 4825,and in Figure 33.5 there is no downside protection
below 4,625.
OPTION CYLINDERS
Option cylinders provide protection outside a range of prices.They provide insurance against
adverse price movements at the cost of foregoing the beneﬁts of advantageous price movements.
Figure 33.6 illustrates a short cylinder.
The purchase of a 6,525 put option might be ﬁnanced by the sale of a 6,725 call option.The
result is a zero-cost option, which provides protection against a fall in the index below 6,525 at
the cost of foregoing gains from a rise in the index above 6,725.
A long cylinder could be structured by buying a 6,725 call option ﬁnanced by writing a 6,525
put option, and would provide insurance against index rises above 6,725 at the cost of foregoing
gains from falls below 6,525.Of course,when using traded options it is very unlikely that the option
premiums would precisely offset each other. Figure 33.7 illustrates a long cylinder.
CRASH OPTIONS
Crash options are designed to give protection against sudden large market falls.Crash options are
put options whose pay-offs are typically based on the fall in a stock index on a single day during
the life of the option. For example a crash option may have a life of one year and pay the holder a
sum of money based on the largest one-day market fall during the year.Longin (2001) pointed out
that in 1987,in the United States,such an option would have paid out 20.5% of the notional value
of the contract since the market fell 20.5% on 19 October.A standard one-year put option for the
year of 1987 would have expired worthless because the market at the end of the year was higher
than at the beginning of the year.
6,525
6,725
Figure 33.6

Crash options are normally cheaper than standard put options since the pay-off is not cumulative
over time; it is limited to the size of the market fall on just one day.The value of a crash option
comprises a sure value and a time value.At the end of the day of the ﬁrst market fall, the option
acquires some sure value.The sure value can increase only if there is a larger fall on a subsequent
day. Crash options normally have daily settlement of the sure value.The sure value is payable to
the option holder immediately after the market decline has occurred.
CONCLUSION
Options, as tools of investment management, can achieve outcomes that would otherwise be
impossible. Provision of insurance against adverse price changes, whilst retaining the ability to
beneﬁt from favourable changes,is one such outcome.There is considerable ﬂexibility available in
the achievement of the outcome.The protection against adverse price movements can be relative
to a particular price, as is the case when a single option position is taken. Alternatively the
protection could be within a range of prices (when an options spread is used), or outside a range
of prices (when an options cylinder is used).When using spreads or cylinders, the net cost of the
options position can be reduced.
The ﬂexibility goes further in that there is the choice between protection against any adverse
price movement and protection only against extreme price movements.The investment manager
could choose between hedging the whole value of a portfolio,and hedging part of it.There is also
a choice between ﬁxed hedging and delta hedging.The current chapter has considered ﬁxed
hedging, which entails holding options to their expiry dates. Chapter 39 on currency derivatives
considers delta (dynamic) hedging, which entails using gains from option price movements prior
to the option expiry date.

Chapter 34
Structured products
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Options funds (guaranteed investment funds).
2. High yield funds (precipice bonds).
3. Bonds with variable principals (structured notes).
Behavioural ﬁnance predicts that investors may want investment products that do not match the
characteristics of shares, bonds, or deposits. Prospect theory indicates that the pain from losses
exceeds the pleasure from gains; this is known as loss-aversion. Loss-aversion suggests that
investments,which allow for gains whilst providing protection from losses,would appeal to many
investors. Options funds are able to meet this need since they are funds which guarantee that the
investment value cannot fall below a speciﬁed level (for example the initial sum invested) whilst
allowing for gains arising from rises in the stock market.
Another behavioural ﬁnance ‘bias’is mental accounting.Mental accounting entails the separation
of the components of a person’s ﬁnances into a number of distinct accounts,as opposed to treating
the ﬁnances as a uniﬁed whole.One result of mental accounting can be the separation of investments
between their principal values and the incomes from them.The rule of thumb of ‘never touch the
principal’is an outcome of mental accounting.The possibility of drawing income by selling shares
or bonds is rejected on the grounds that the sale of investments reduces the source of future
income.This leads to a preference for shares and bonds with high dividend yields when high income
is desired.High yield funds go a step further in meeting the desire for high income without selling
any of the investment.Such funds enhance yields by selling options and adding the option premiums
received to the dividends payable to investors.
Loss-aversion and mental accounting are often seen as preferences rather than as
biases. Preferences should be accommodated rather than corrected. Structured products, such
as option funds and high yield funds, provide means of accommodating the preferences of
investors.

OPTIONS FUNDS (GUARANTEED EQUITY FUNDS)
The Nature of Options Funds
Options funds,or guaranteed equity funds,are a means of providing some of the potential proﬁts
from stock market investment whilst guaranteeing the return of the investors’capital.Such funds
are marketed under a variety of different names such as guaranteed investment bonds,guaranteed
equity bonds,guaranteed investment accounts,and guaranteed capital bonds.They are investments
for ﬁxed terms, often ﬁve years.These funds typically guarantee the return of at least the initial
investment plus a proportion, such as 70%, of any increase in a stock market index.
The opportunity cost, when compared with a bank deposit, is the interest foregone.The
opportunity cost,when compared with buying shares,is the proportion of the stock market return
that fails to accrue to the investors (typically some of the capital gain and all of the dividends).
Generally the guarantees only apply if the investments are held for the full ﬁxed term.Another
potential problem concerns taxation. Many of the funds are subject to income tax rather than
capital gains tax.This is a disadvantage for many investors,since it is often the case that an individual
is above the threshold for paying income tax but below the threshold for paying capital gains tax.
The Fiduciary Call Approach
An options fund is characterised by upside exposure to a stock index together with a lower limit
to the value of the fund.This proﬁle of returns can be achieved in two main ways. One is the
ﬁduciary call, which involves investment in risk-free assets (such as ﬁxed-rate bank deposits, gilt
strips, or high-grade zero coupon bonds) and call options. The risk-free assets provide the
guaranteed minimum value, while the call options provide the exposure to the stock market.
The ﬁduciary call approach involves calculating the present value of the guaranteed sum and
investing it in ﬁxed-rate bank deposits (or other risk-free assets).This generates the guaranteed
sum upon maturity of the fund.The remainder of the fund is used to buy call options.The cost of
the downside protection is reduced proﬁt on the upside. Potential returns from a rising stock
market are less than would be obtained if the entire fund were to be invested in shares.
Whether options funds perform better than the alternatives, of a bank deposit or investment
in shares,depends upon the performance of the stock market.This is illustrated by Exercise 34.1.
EXERCISE 34.1
(a) A fund manager has £1,000,000 and invests £952,381 in a bank deposit for one year at 5%

(b) How does the investment strategy in (a) compare with (1) investing the £1,000,000 in a bank
deposit, and (2) investing the £1,000,000 in a balanced portfolio of FTSE 100 shares?

Answers
(a) (i) £1,000,000, (ii) £1,000,000, (iii) £1,180,000 (the guaranteed £1,000,000 plus 0.9 of
the 20% stock price rise), (iv) £1,360,000 (the guaranteed £1,000,000 plus 0.9 of the
40% stock price rise).
(b)
(1) In cases (i) and (ii) the investment strategy in (a) is inferior to the deposit by £50,000 (5%
interest on £1,000,000).In cases (iii) and (iv) the strategy in (a) is superior to the deposit
by £130,000 and £310,000 respectively (since the deposit of £1,000,000 would grow to
£1,050,000).
(2) In case (i) the strategy in (a) is superior to the investment in shares (which would
have provided £800,000 plus dividends). In case (ii) the strategy in (a) is inferior to
the investment in shares by the amount of the dividend yield on the shares. In case
(iii) the investment in shares would have provided £1,200,000 plus dividends,and in case
(iv) the share investment would have produced £1,400,000 plus dividends. So in cases
(iii) and (iv) the investment in shares would have outperformed the strategy in (a).
The Protective Put Approach
The other main approach to the structuring of options funds is the protective put.This entails
holding a portfolio of shares together with put options that guarantee a minimum value of that
shareholding.Protective put strategies (sometimes referred to as portfolio insurance) also involve
some investment in risk-free assets in order to fully guarantee the minimum value of the fund.The
guaranteed value is ensured by a combination of an investment in risk-free assets such as bank
deposits,and a lowest possible value of the shareholding based on the strike price of the put options.
In the case of options funds created using the protective put approach, since the guaranteed
minimum value is provided from two sources – the investment in risk-free assets and a shareholding
combined with put options – it is necessary to use simultaneous equations to calculate the amounts
of the constituent components. If M is the guaranteed minimum value, X is the amount to be
invested in risk-free assets, K is the option strike price, r is the interest rate on risk-free assets,T
is the maturity of the fund,and N is the number of put options (which matches the amount of stock
purchased), then:
M  X(1  r)T  NK
i.e. the guaranteed minimum fund value equals the maturity value of the investment in risk-
free assets plus the minimum value of the shareholding guaranteed by the put options.
The value of N can be calculated as:
N  (V  X)/(S  P)
where V is the initial value of the fund, S is the value of stock covered by one option, and P is
the price of a put option. N is thus the number of combinations of stock and put option that can
STRUCTURED PRODUCTS
649

be purchased after X has been allocated to investment in risk-free assets.The portfolio of shares
purchased would be the stock index portfolio, which is the portfolio of shares comprising all the
shares in the index in proportions that correspond to their weightings in the index.The stock
index would be that upon which the options are based:for example,the FTSE 100 Index and FTSE
100 options.
The two equations can be simultaneously solved for X and N. In this way, the amount to be
invested in risk-free assets can be ascertained together with the number of matched combinations
of stock and put option.
EXERCISE 34.2
A fund manager wants to construct an options fund.The value of the portfolio is £10 million and
the fund has an investment horizon of one year.The FTSE 100 stands at 4,000, and the 12-month
interest rate is 5% p.a.The prices of FTSE 100 options with one year to expiry and a strike price
of 4,000 are 250 index points for calls and 200 for puts.
On the basis of the guaranteed minimum value for the fund being £10 million, show how the
ﬁduciary call and protective put approaches can be used to structure the fund.In each case indicate
the proportion of any rise in the FTSE 100 that would be received.What are the relative merits of
the two approaches?
Answer
At an interest rate of 5% p.a., a deposit of £9,523,809 (£10,000,000/1.05) would provide
£10,000,000 at the end of the year. So £9,523,809 is deposited to provide the guaranteed return
of capital.This leaves £10,000,000  £9,523,809  £476,190 available for the purchase of call
options.At £10 per index point each call option costs £2,500.The number of call options that can
be bought is £476,190/£2,500  190.48. Since option contracts are indivisible (only whole
numbers can be bought), the number purchased would be 190.The value of stock to which 190
contracts relates is 4,000  £10  190  £7,600,000. So the proportion of any increase in the
FTSE 100,above 4,000,obtained by the fund would be £7,600,000/£10,000,000 0.76,i.e.76%.
The use of the protective put approach involves the solution of the following simultaneous
equations:
M  X(1  r)T  NK

£4,880,000 of stock are purchased.The fund will receive £4,880,000/£10,000,000  0.488,i.e.
48.8%, of any rise in the FTSE 100 above 4,000 (the stocks purchased would be the FTSE 100
portfolio).
The ﬁduciary call approach realises a higher proportion of any rise in the FTSE 100, but the
protective put structure beneﬁts from receipt of the dividends on the shares held (whereas the
ﬁduciary call fund entails no receipt of dividends).
EXERCISE 34.3
A fund manager has £20 million for an options fund.The FTSE 100 Index stands at 4,500 points.
Five-year European-style at-the-money call options are priced at 700 index points.The ﬁve-year
risk-free interest rate is 6% p.a.
(a) Construct a ﬁduciary call options fund (guaranteed investment fund) that guarantees the
return of the initial £20 million at the end of a ﬁve-year period while providing upside exposure

(b) If the objective is to obtain exactly 100% of the increase in the FTSE 100,what return can be
guaranteed from the guaranteed investment fund?

(a) The sum that needs to be deposited now in order to guarantee the return of £20,000,000 in
ﬁve years is:

The sum available for the purchase of call options is:
£20,000,000  £14,945,163  £5,054,837.
STRUCTURED PRODUCTS

The price of a call option contract is:
700  £10  £7,000.
The number of call option contracts that can be bought is:
£5,054,837/£7,000  722 (rounding down to the nearest whole number).
Each contract would provide a return of £10 from a 1 point rise in the index,so 722 contracts
would provide £7,220.A £20,000,000 fund invested wholly in shares (the FTSE 100 portfolio)
would provide a percentage increase of:
[(4501/4500)  1]  100%  0.02222%.
In money terms this amounts to £20,000,000  0.0002222  £4,444.44.So the proportion
of the increase in the FTSE 100 is £7,220/£4,444.44  1.6245 (i.e. 162.45%).
(b) The closest to obtaining 100% of the rise in the index would come from 444 option contracts.
A 1-point rise in the index provides £10 per contract on 444 contracts, which is £4,440.
£4,440/£4,444.44  0.999 (i.e. 99.9% of a rise in the index is obtained).
444 call option contracts would cost 444  700  £10  £3,108,000. This leaves
£20,000,000  £3,108,000  £16,892,000 available to be deposited to produce the
guaranteed sum.The sum guaranteed at the end of ﬁve years is:
£16,892,000  (1.06)5  £22,605,306
which as an annual rate of return is:
(£22,605,306/£20,000,000)0.2 1  0.0248 , i.e. 2.48% p.a.
A return of 2.48% p.a. can be guaranteed.
Since 2003 a new product has become available: Constant Protection Portfolio Insurance (CPPI)
funds.These link to a stock index and the investors’ money is split between shares and cash.As
markets fall shares are sold in order to reduce exposure to the stock market.The reverse happens
when markets rise.It is possible to obtain the stock market exposure by using stock index futures
rather than shares. One disadvantage is that shares are sold as markets fall, and bought when they
rise,with the result that the fund sells at low prices and buys at high prices.Buying high and selling
low is a strategy that loses money. However this may be seen as an acceptable cost of obtaining
protection against the worst effects of market falls.(In fact the strategy amounts to simulating the
purchase of a put option to obtain insurance against a falling market.The buy high/sell low losses
are the counterpart of paying an option premium.) There is also the risk that markets may fall so
rapidly that there is no opportunity to sell the shares in time to obtain protection. For example
during the stock market crash of October 1987 most of the losses occurred in one day so there
was little time to unwind shareholdings (and there were few buyers so selling was difﬁcult).In fact
this portfolio insurance strategy was suggested as one of the causes of the crash since it entailed
selling into a falling market, thereby adding to the downward pressure on share prices.

Break-Even Points
The break-even point of an options fund is the index value that must be reached for the return on
the fund to match the return on a risk-free investment (such as a ﬁxed-rate bank deposit).Suppose
that the current index value is 5,000,that the ﬁxed ﬁve-year interest rate available is 4% p.a.,and
that the fund guarantees the return of the original sum (without interest). Over ﬁve years a sum
of £1,000 deposited at 4% p.a. would grow to £1,000  (1.04)5  £1,216.65 (i.e. there is a
21.665% increase).If a fund provides 100% of the increase in the stock index then the break-even
index, at the end of ﬁve years, is equal to X in the following equation:
X/5,000  £1,216.65/£1,000
So X is (£1,216.65/£1,000)  5,000  6,083.25
In other words, a 21.665% increase in the index is required.
If the fund provides less than 100% of the increase in the index, the break-even index is
correspondingly higher.If,in the previous example,the fund offered 80% (0.8) of the increase in
the index then the break-even point is equal to Y in the following equation:
Y  5,000  (6,083.25  5,000)/0.8  6,354.06
In other words, the index should rise by 21.665/0.8  27.081%.
EXERCISE 34.4
A fund manager has £100 million for an options fund.The FTSE 100 Index stands at 5000 points.

upside exposure to the FTSE 100 Index.What proportion of the increase in the FTSE 100
would be obtained?
(b) What is the break-even point?
(c) If the fund manager aimed to provide a return of 100% of the rise in the FTSE 100,what rate
of interest could be guaranteed in addition to matching rises in the index?

(e) If the FTSE 100 rises to 7,000 over the ﬁve years, how do the returns on the options funds
compare with investing the £100 million in an index tracker fund (which aims to match
movements in the FTSE 100).

Answers
(a) The sum that needs to be deposited now in order to guarantee the return of £100,000,000
in ﬁve years is:
£100,000,000/(1.05)5  £78,352,617.
The sum available for the purchase of call options is:
£100,000,000  £78,352,617  £21,647,383.
The price of a call option contract is:
500  £10  £5,000.
The number of call option contracts that can be bought is:
£21,647,383 / £5,000  4,329 (rounding down to the nearest whole number).
Each option contract would provide a return of £10 from a 1-point rise in the index,so 4,329
contracts would provide £43,290.A £100,000,000 fund invested wholly in shares (the FTSE
100 portfolio) would provide a percentage increase of [(5,001/5,000) 1]  100%  0.02%
from a 1-point rise in the index. In money terms this amounts to £100,000,000  0.0002
 £20,000.So the proportion of the increase in the FTSE 100 is £43,290/ £20,000  2.1645
(i.e. 216.45%).
(b) At 5% p.a. over ﬁve years £100,000,000 would grow to:
£100,000,000  (1.05)5  £127,628,156

5,000  (6381.408  5,000)/2.1645  5,638 (to the nearest whole number)
(2.1645 is the decimal of 216.45%)
Alternatively
A pay-off of £27,628,156 from 4,329 call option contracts requires an increase in the index of:
£27,628,156/£43,290  638 points.
The break-even index is 5,000  638  5,638 points.
(c) For a fund invested wholly in shares,a 1-point rise in the index returns £20,000.Each option
contract returns £10 for a 1-point rise in the index. Matching the rise in the share portfolio
requires £20,000/£10  2,000 option contracts.The cost of 2,000 contracts is 2,000 
£5,000  £10,000,000.This leaves £100,000,000  £10,000,000  £90,000,000 from
the original fund.A deposit of £90,000,000 at 5% p.a. for ﬁve years produces £90,000,000
 (1.05)5  £114,865,340.This is equivalent to a rate of return of:
(1.1486534)0.2 1  0.0281057 i.e. 2.81% p.a.
The fund manager could guarantee an interest rate of 2.81% p.a.in addition to matching the
rise in the FTSE 100 Index.

Fund objective:
The Close Escalator 100 Fund is a protected unit trust which has been designed to provide returns
linked to stockmarket growth with 100% capital protection in the event of a fall. It is a lower
risk investment, suitable for investors tempted by stockmarket returns, but who are unwilling to
risk loss of capital should the stockmarket fall.
The 100% capital protection was on a quarterly basis with the quarter dates being the third

The number of call option contracts that can be bought is:
£21,647,383 / £12,000  1,803 (rounding down to the nearest whole number).
The return from a 1-point rise in the index arising from options is £18,030.So the proportion
of the return on the FTSE 100 is £18,030 / £20,000  90.15%.The options fund receives
90.15% of any rise in the FTSE 100.
The break-even index would be based on an increase in the index of £27,628,156 / £18,030
 1,532 points (to the nearest whole number).So the break-even point is 5,000  1,532 
6,532.
Since the fund manager cannot provide a return of 100% of the rise in the FTSE 100,there
is no possibility of an interest return in addition to matching the rise in the index.
(e) In the case in which 4,329 call option contracts are bought the total return from the options,
when the index rises from 5,000 to 7,000,would be 4,329  £10  2,000  £86,580,000.
In the case in which 1,803 call option contracts are bought,the total return from the options
would be 1,803  £10  2,000  £36,060,000.
If the £100,000,000 were invested in an index tracker fund,the return from share price rises
would be [(7,0005,000)/5,000]  £100,000,000  £40,000,000.To obtain the total
return, dividends should be added. For example if the dividend yield were 3% p.a., the
additional return over ﬁve years would be (1.03)5 1  0.1593 i.e.15.93% (£15,930,000).
If the dividends were reinvested in shares, this additional return would be further boosted by
the share price rises.The options funds would not provide the additional returns from dividends.

With reference to Exhibit 34.1,it would appear that in the case of the Escalator 100 the investor
could not lose money and that the gain made during a quarter became guaranteed in subsequent
quarters.The guaranteed fund value in a quarter would be the value reached at the end of the
previous quarter.The initial investment and the subsequent quarterly gains were guaranteed.
In the case of the Escalator 95 it was possible to lose 5% of the investment in a quarter, so that
in a worst case scenario the value of the investment could fall by 5% in each of successive quarters.
However in the event of market rises,the higher values become those to be protected in subsequent
quarters.
The cost of protection (presumably using options) would be much less in the case of the
Escalator 95 than for the Escalator 100.This may explain why the recorded actual performance
over the previous eight quarters was 10.3% for the Escalator 100 but 25.7% for the Escalator 95.
If protection had been obtained by buying put options, the out-of-the-money options used for
the Escalator 95 would have been cheaper than the at-the-money options bought for the Escalator
100 fund.
If protection had been obtained by combining money market investments with call options,the
need to deposit enough to guarantee 95%, rather than 100%, of the fund would release much
more cash for the purchase of options. Since more money would have been available for the
purchase of call options, the proﬁt prospects of the Escalator 95 would have been enhanced.
Options Funds as Disaster Insurance
Retail investors do not normally have access to long-term options.Options funds provide indirect
access to long-term options. In the case of the ﬁduciary call approach, the investor buys a long-
term call option combined with a money market investment (e.g.bank deposit).In the case of the

protective put approach,the investor buys a long-term put option combined with part of a portfolio
of shares.
Another possibility might be a long-term put option combined with a money market
investment.In this case proﬁts would arise from market falls rather than from rises.Such a structure
could be attractive to investors who seek protection from an extreme fall in the stock market; in
other words, disaster insurance. Since retail investors are not normally able to acquire long-term
options directly, this structured product would provide indirect access to long-term put options.
Exercise 34.5 illustrates the use of such a structured product for disaster insurance.
EXERCISE 34.5
The FTSE All-Share Index is currently 2,800 points. Five-year put options with a strike price of
2,100 are available for 101 index points.The ﬁve-year interest rate is 5% p.a.
(a) If a fund manager wanted to create an options fund that provides proﬁts in the event of a fall
in the index below 2,100, how could the fund be structured so that the initial investment is
guaranteed to be returned after ﬁve years?
(b) What proportion of the fall below 2,100 would be realised as proﬁt?
(c) If an investor spends £1,000 on the fund,what would be the sum returned to the investor after
ﬁve years if the index value falls to 1,400 points?
(d) What would be the sum returned if the index fell to 700 points?
(e) Why might an institutional fund manager want to construct such a fund?
Answers
(a) Consider an investment of £28,000. If £28,000 is to be guaranteed for ﬁve years hence, the
sum to be deposited at 5% p.a. is:
£28,000/(1.05)5  £21,938.7
£21,938.7 invested at 5% p.a. realises £28,000 at the end of ﬁve years.
The sum available for expenditure on options is:
£28,000  £21,938.7  £6,061.3
At £10 per index point each option contract costs 101  £10  £1,010.
So £6,061.3/£1,010  6 (to the nearest whole number) options can be bought.
(b) Since six options are bought,the proportion of any fall below 2,100 received as gains is 600%.
(c) There would be a pay-off from each option of 700 (2,100  1,400) index points.The pay-off
from six options would be 6  700  4,200 index points. In addition, the original 2,800 is
guaranteed by the deposit. So the investor would receive:
[(4,200  2,800) / 2,800]  £1,000  [7,000 / 2,800]  £1,000  £2,500.

657

(d) There would be a pay-off from each option of 1,400 (2,100  700) index points.The pay-off
from six options would be 6  1400  8,400 index points.In addition,the original 2,800 is
guaranteed by the deposit. So the investor would receive:
[(8,400  2,800)] / 2,800]  £1,000  [11,200 / 2,800]  £1,000  £4,000.
(e) An institutional investor might create,and market,such an options fund as a form of disaster
insurance. Retail investors might buy such an investment as a means of obtaining protection
against extreme falls in the stock market. Effectively the price paid for the insurance, by the
retail investor,is the interest that would otherwise have been obtained on the sum invested in
the fund.
USE OF EXOTIC OPTIONS AND OPTION COMBINATIONS
The examples above used simple options. However the options used in options funds could be
exotic options. In particular investors might be offered protection from a sharp fall in the index
towards the end of the investment period. For example a ﬁve-year guaranteed equity bond may
be on course to provide a good return when, a few months before maturity, a stock market crash
wipes out all of the gain in the stock index.
Three possibilities would be Asian options, cliquet options, and ladder options. In the case of
an Asian option the return is based on an average of experienced stock indices rather than the
index at the end of the investment period. For example when using the ﬁduciary call approach,
the average of the stock indices at the end of each of the ﬁve years could be used as the basis for
assessing the ﬁnal value of a ﬁve-year bond.
A cliquet option is effectively a series of options.In the case of a ﬁve-year bond,which uses the
ﬁduciary call approach, there could be a new option for each of the ﬁve years.At the end of each
year any proﬁts from that year’s option is added to the sum that is guaranteed.A new option,with
a strike price matching the new level of the index, would then become operational.The investor
is protected against a substantial fall in the stock market to the extent that the option proﬁts from
previous years would have been added to the guaranteed sum.
A ladder option would lock in proﬁts when the stock index reaches pre-speciﬁed levels. For
example the fund may be created when the stock index is 5,000, using call options with a strike
price of 5,000.It may be pre-speciﬁed that,if the index reaches 6,000,proﬁts from the ﬁrst option
will be added to the guaranteed sum. New call options with a strike price of 6,000 would then
become operational.The addition of the proﬁts from the ﬁrst option to the guaranteed sum provides
investors with some protection against a substantial fall in the stock market.

An investment, described as a Capital Guaranteed Bond, is offered to retail investors.The bond

£1,000 invested the bond would return £1,000 if the FTSE 100 is below its initial value at the end
of the three years or £1,250 if the FTSE 100 equals, or exceeds, its initial value at the end of the
three years.When the bond is issued the three-year interest rate is 5% p.a.
(a) How can the provider structure the bond?
(b) Is it a good investment?
(c) In what ways is the pay-off dependent on the rise in the FTSE 100?
Answers
(a) The bond could be structured by depositing £1,000/(1.05)3  £863.84 per £1,000 invested.
This guarantees that £1,000 will be available after three years.In addition a FTSE 100 binary
call option would be bought.The binary option is an all-or-nothing option,which pays a ﬁxed
sum of money in the event of the FTSE 100 exceeding a particular value. In the present case
the binary option pays £250,at the end of three years,so long as the FTSE 100 at least equals
its initial value.
(b) The return on the bond,in the event of £1,250 being received,is equivalent to (1.25)1/3 1
 0.0772, i.e. 7.72% p.a. From the perspective of statistical expectation, this is superior to
the 5% p.a. available on three-year deposits if the probability of the FTSE 100 falling over a
three-year period is less than (7.725.0)/7.72  0.3523, i.e. 35.23%. Historically three-
year declines in the FTSE 100 have been less frequent than 35.23%. If the investor is not too
concerned about the risk of receiving a return of 0% p.a., the bond appears to be a good
investment.
(c) The pay-off is not dependent upon a rise in the FTSE 100, but it is dependent on the FTSE
100 not falling.The £250 return is based on the expectations,of the seller of the binary option,
concerning the statistical distribution of future values of the FTSE 100.The bond converts the
expectations of the seller of the option, concerning the distribution of the future FTSE 100,
into a distribution of interest rates (the distribution comprising the values of 0% p.a. and
7.72% p.a.)
In Chapter 33 on hedging with options, a form of option combination, often referred to as a
cylinder option, was described. Option cylinders provide insurance against adverse price
movements at the cost of foregoing the beneﬁts of advantageous price movements. Figure 34.1
illustrates a short cylinder.
The purchase of a 5,875 put option might be ﬁnanced by the sale of a 6,625 call option (the
sale receipts may not necessarily equal the purchase cost).The result is a cylinder option, which
provides protection against a fall in the index below 5,875 at the cost of foregoing gains from a
rise in the index above 6,625.The options may subsequently be replaced by options with different
strike prices so that the strike prices continue to be on either side of the spot index. For example
in the event of the index rising above 6,625, the put option may be replaced by one with a strike
price of 6,250 and the call option replaced by one with a strike price of 7,000.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
To provide long-term capital growth. It is the Manager’s policy to achieve that objective by
selecting a diversiﬁed portfolio of shares of companies being primarily those included in the FTSE
100 Index. The Manager will enter into appropriate derivative transactions so as to enable the
Trust to have the beneﬁt of continuous downside protection.
Benchmark: FTSE 100
Fund size:
£10.7 million
Initial charge: 5.54%
Annual management charge: 1.5%
ACTIVITY
The Trust’s portfolio of equities is designed to closely mirror the return of the FTSE 100 Index,
with a derivative overlay to protect the portfolio when equity markets fall. The effect of this
overlay is to also cap the potential for gain during periods of rising markets. In January the Trust
rolled over its derivative exposure into higher strike price puts and calls to lock in the gains in the
index during 2006. At the same time the equity holdings in the portfolio were rebalanced to more
closely match the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index.

DERIVATIVE DISCLOSURE (ABRIDGED)
The Trust has purchased a put option, this means that the Trust’s capital exposure is restricted.
Should the index of leading shares as measured by the FTSE 100 Index fall beneath 5,897.51
the Trust’s capital losses resulting from this fall will be matched by gains from the put option.
Similarly the Trust’s gains are limited through it writing a call option. This means that should
the FTSE 100 Index rise above 6,605.21 the Trust’s gains will be restricted due to losses on the
call option.

HIGH YIELD FUNDS (COVERED CALL 
FUNDS/PRECIPICE BONDS/SCARPS)
Another use of options, in the structuring of funds, is their use in enhancing income. In some
high yield funds, options are written and the premiums received are used to enhance the income
paid to investors.This is likely to be at the cost of the capital value of the funds. Such funds are
illustrated in exercises 34.7, 34.8, and 34.9.At the time of writing, options that enhance income
by writing call options are being marketed as a ‘new’ form of investment and are being called
‘covered call funds’ (Richards 2007). In some cases the writing of call options is accompanied
by buying out-of-the-money put options in order to give some protection against share price
falls.It is often the case with structured products that ‘new’investment ideas are really repackaged
old ones.
The CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) publishes an index based on a covered
call strategy.The strategy writes S&P 500 call options against the S&P 500 stock index and the
index is called the CBOE S&P 500 Buy-Write (BXM) index.Feldman and Roy (2005) found that
this index outperformed the S&P 500 index and suggested that this could be because option
prices were higher than might be expected on the basis of option pricing models (in other words
there appeared to be unjustiﬁably high implied volatility).They suggested that call option buyers
may be systematically overestimating the value of call options and that such overestimation is
consistent with behavioural ﬁnance biases such as overconﬁdence.Buyers of call options are likely
to be more conﬁdent than other investors; a level of conﬁdence evidenced by a desire to take
geared (leveraged) positions. If this behavioural explanation for high option prices is correct, the
additional return from the BXM buy-write strategy could be seen as a monetisation of the
overconﬁdence bias.
When a high yield fund writes stock index put options, a decline in the relevant stock
index below the strike price can cause a dramatic fall in capital value. The loss from the
written put options adds to the loss on the portfolio. In consequence, high yield funds that write
put options are often referred to as precipice bonds (the value of the investment can fall off a
precipice).

(d) In the case of (a) the investor risks losing part of any increase in share prices so that long-term
capital growth is reduced. In the case of (b) upside potential is lost and downside risk is
increased.In the case of (c),upward movements are restricted and downward movements may
be exaggerated. In all three cases, the increased income yield could be at the expense of the
capital value of the fund.

EXERCISE 34.8
The FTSE 100 stands at 4,375. FTSE 100 option prices, with a year to maturity, are as shown in
the table.
(a) If the holder of a balanced portfolio of FTSE 100 shares takes the view that 4,525 is a
satisfactory selling price,and 4,225 a suitable buying price,what strategy might be undertaken?
(b) If the option contracts match the value of the stock portfolio,what is the enhancement to the
rate of yield on the portfolio provided by the use of this strategy?
Answers
(a) A short strangle could be used.The investor might write puts with a strike price of 4,225,
and would buy stocks at that level if the index falls below it and the puts are exercised. Calls
are written with a strike price of 4,525.The investor would then sell at 4,525 in the event of
the options being exercised.
(b) The options provide a total of 80  60  140 index points of income.This amounts to a rate
of return of 140/4,375  0.032 i.e. 3.2%.This is the enhancement to the rate of return
otherwise obtained on the portfolio of shares.
EXERCISE 34.9
The FTSE All-Share Index is currently 2,800 points. Five-year put options with a strike price of
2,100 are available for 90 index points. Five-year put options with a strike price of 2,800 are
available for 320 index points.A fund manager decides to write put options in order to enhance
portfolio returns. If the number of options written matches the size of the portfolio, what is the
enhancement to portfolio returns in the cases of using (a) the 2,100 strike price options, and (b)
the 2,800 strike price options? (c) Compare the risks of the two cases.
Answers
(a) Writing the 2,100 strike price options provides an addition to the portfolio return of
90/2,800  0.0321 (i.e.3.21%).This relates to a ﬁve-year period.The annual enhancement
to return is:
(1.0321)0.2  1  0.0063 (i.e. 0.63% p.a.)

(b) Writing the 2,800 strike price options provides an addition to the portfolio return of
320/2,800  0.1143 (i.e. 11.43%). This relates to a ﬁve-year period. The annualised
enhancement to return is:
(1.1143)0.2  1  0.0219 (i.e. 2.19% p.a.)
(c) In the case of writing the 2,100 strike price put options,there would be a loss from the options
if there were a substantial fall in the stock market.Any fall below 2,100 would entail an option
loss,which is additional to the loss on the portfolio of stocks.A 50% fall in the market to 1,400
would entail a loss on the written put options of 700 index points (2,100  1,400), which
would take the total loss to 2,100 index points (1,400  700). In total 75% of the original
investment would be lost (this ignores the premium receipts).
In the case of writing the 2,800 strike price put options, any fall in the stock market below
the current 2,800 index points would entail a loss on the options that adds to the loss on the
portfolio. If the portfolio falls in line with the stock index, the options would double the
portfolio loss.If the stock market fell by 50%,the original investment fund would be reduced
to zero (this ignores the premium receipts).
Between March 2000 and March 2003 the UK stock market approximately halved in value
and many investors in high yield (precipice) bonds lost the whole of their investments.
The Financial Services Authority has given precipice bonds the alternative name of scarps
(structured capital-at-risk products).There is a common characteristic amongst them of written
options, particularly put options.They may vary as to whether the rest of the investment is in
shares or cash. It may be that the put options are deeply out-of-the-money.This means that stock
prices (and stock indices) have to fall substantially before losses arise from the written options.In
the past this feature seems to have led some ﬁnancial advisers to sell scarps as low risk products,
on the grounds that such large falls in the stock market were unlikely.Unfortunately the heavy fall
of the period 2000–3 (from peak to trough the FTSE 100 lost more than half its value) brought
about losses from written put options that completely wiped out the value of some funds.So funds
sold as low risk turned out to be very high risk.
A variation on the high yield theme takes the form of catastrophe bonds, which are used as
insurance against natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes (Vaugirard 2003). Buyers
of the bonds invest money, which the intermediary uses to acquire government bonds.
Organisations seeking insurance against disaster pay annual premiums,which the intermediary also
uses to buy government bonds.At the end of the period of insurance, if no natural disaster has
occurred, the bondholders receive all the proceeds of the investments.These comprise both the
accumulated investment value of the initial investment,and the accumulated value from investing
the insurance premiums.The bondholders obtain an investment return, which is enhanced by
investing insurance receipts.In the event of the disaster occurring,the proceeds of the investments
accrue to the organisation buying insurance.In effect the buyers of catastrophe bonds are writing
options on the occurrence of natural disasters,and payment for the options is received in the form
of an enhancement to the accumulated ﬁnal investment value.

BONDS WITH VARIABLE PRINCIPALS (STRUCTURED NOTES)
A broad category of structured products comprises bonds with derivative features, which are
based on other asset classes.These products are similar to other bonds except that instead of the
principal sum to be repaid upon redemption being a ﬁxed sum of money, the sum to be repaid is
linked to an asset or commodity price.
The principal may be linked to a currency price, an oil price, the gold price, a stock index,
an index of house prices, or one of a number of other prices or indices. The link could be
through a forward contract, an option, or a more complex derivative position such as an option
spread.
A bond could be issued with ﬁxed annual coupon payments,and with a speciﬁed maturity date,
but with a principal repayment that is linked to a house price index.Such a bond may be attractive
to an investor who wants exposure to the UK property market without actually owning a property
(perhaps an expatriate worker who intends to return to the UK in the future). One problem for
the issuer of such a bond is the inability to hedge the inherent risk.If house prices rise more strongly
than expected, the issuer of the bond would need to meet high redemption payments.The issuer
could address this matter by issuing both bull and bear bonds.There is not only an issue of bonds
that provide gains from rises in house prices (bull bonds), but also an issue that provides gains
from price falls (bear bonds).The bear bonds would have principal repayments that are inversely
related to house price movements (these may be attractive to investors who feel that they are
overexposed to the housing market).The issue of both bull and bear bonds leaves the issuer with
no net exposure to the housing market.
Where an asset or commodity has a derivatives market, the bond issuer has less need to
simultaneously issue bull and bear bonds. For example an issuer could sell bonds with principal
repayments linked to an oil price, and hedge the resulting exposure to the oil price by taking
offsetting positions in oil forwards or futures.
The principal repayment could be linked to a price, or index, whilst guaranteeing that the
principal repayment would not fall below a speciﬁed sum of money. In that case the principal
repayment would entail an option. Effectively the bondholder would have a bond plus an option.
At redemption the investor would receive a predetermined ﬁxed sum of money plus a sum based
on,for example,the increase in an index of share prices.The issuer might hedge its risk by buying
call options.The cost of these options would be passed on to the bond investors.The investors might
pay for the options by way of accepting reduced coupon receipts.
The attraction of variable principal bonds to investors would include the ability to gain exposure
to a market,where such exposure may be difﬁcult by other means.Such bonds could,alternatively,
provide convenient means of hedging existing exposures.The attraction to the issuer would be the
ability to borrow at favourable rates. If the issuer caters for the needs of investors, the investors
would be willing to lend at lower coupon rates.
Structured funds can be constructed without the use of options. Consider the example in
Exercise 34.10.

EXERCISE 34.10
A fund manager offers a structured retail investment with the following characteristics.The
investment is for ﬁve years, there is a guaranteed 6.25% on half the investment, the other half is
paid a return equal to half the increase in the FTSE 100,and there is a guarantee that the payment
at the end of the ﬁve years cannot be less than the initial investment.
The fund manager can invest in a ﬁve-year bond at 5.25% p.a.,and the expected rate of dividend
yield on the FTSE 100 is 3% p.a.
(a) How can the fund manager construct the fund?
(b) What is the expected proﬁt for the fund manager,and the expected cost to the retail investor?
(c) What is the retail investor paying for?
Answers
(a) The investment pays half the increase in the FTSE 100 on half the value of the fund.This is the
same as paying the whole of the increase in the FTSE 100 on a quarter of the fund.This can
be provided by investing a quarter of the fund in an index tracker.The remaining three-quarters
can be invested in the bond at 5.25% p.a. So for every £1,000 made available to the fund
manager,bonds to the value of £750 can be bought.The remaining £250 is invested in the index
tracker fund.
(b) By the end of the ﬁve years the value of the investment in bonds would be £750  (1.0525)5
 £750  1.29155  £968.66.The £250 invested in an index tracker fund is expected to
provide a dividend yield of 3% p.a.in addition to the capital gain from the increase in the FTSE
100.The dividend yield is expected to provide £250  0.15  £37.5, which would also
attract interest.If interest rates were 5% p.a.,the interest accruing would be a little over £2.
The value of the fund, excluding the index tracker, would be (a little over):
£968.66  £37.5  £2  £1,008.16.
So there is no need to buy an option to guarantee the return of the £1,000 invested.
The value of the fund, inclusive of the index tracker, would be:
£1,008.16  £250  the capital gain from £250 invested in the index tracker fund
 £1,258.16  the capital gain from £250 invested in the index tracker fund.
The retail investor is due to receive 6.25% p.a. on £500 (for every £1,000 invested).This
amounts to:
£500  (1.0625)5  £500  1.35408  £677.04.
In addition there would be half the rate of rise in the FTSE 100 on £500.This amounts to
returning £500 plus the capital gain on the £250 invested in the index tracker fund. So the
total accruing to the retail investor is:
£677.04  £500  the capital gain from £250 invested in the index tracker fund
 £1,177.04  the capital gain from £250 invested in the index tracker fund.
STOCK OPTIONS
666

The expected proﬁt for the fund manager is:
£1,258.16  the capital gain from £250 invested in the index tracker fund 
minus £1,177.04  the capital gain from £250 invested in the index tracker fund.
 £1,258.16  £1,177.04  £81.12.
So for every £1,000 invested the expected proﬁt for the fund manager is £81.12.The present
value of £81.12 should be compared with the investment of £1,000 so that they both relate
to the same point in time. Using the bond yield as the rate of discount, the present value of
£81.12 is:
£81.12/(1.0525)5  £62.81.
This is both the proﬁt to the fund manager and the cost to the investor (note that the proﬁt to
the fund manager will be reduced to the extent that commission is paid to ﬁnancial advisers
who sell the fund to their clients).
(c) The retail investor is paying £62.81 (for each £1,000 invested) for the expertise of the fund
manager in the construction of the structured fund, in addition to paying for the underlying
investments.
COLLATERALISED DEBT OBLIGATIONS
AND THE SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS
A mortgage lender could package a number of mortgages together and sell the package to a bank
or institutional investor.If a bank were to buy the portfolio of mortgages,it might split the portfolio
into tranches.For example there could be four tranches of equal size.Each tranche might receive
an equal proportion of interest receipts but get a different priority as to order of receipt of capital
repayments.Tranche A might receive all capital repayments by the borrowers until it is fully repaid.
Next the capital repayments are paid to the holders of tranche B, and so on. Effectively tranche A
is a short maturity asset, and subsequent tranches have progressively longer maturities.Tranche
D, which is the ﬁnal tranche to be retired, has the longest maturity.Tranche D is also the most
subject to default risk.To the extent that some mortgage borrowers fail to repay the capital, the
holders of tranche D are most at risk.If a quarter of borrowers were to default on their mortgages,
the holders of tranche D could lose all of their investment. It could be the case that some of the
mortgage loans were to sub-prime borrowers, who are borrowers with poor credit ratings. Such
sub-prime borrowers are the most likely to default. If the portfolio of mortgages includes some
sub-prime mortgages, holders of tranche D have very risky assets.
The sub-prime mortgage crisis of summer 2007 entailed such Collateralised Debt Obligation
(CDO) structures. Defaults on sub-prime mortgages led to losses for the holders of the risky
tranches of CDOs. Since banks did not know which other banks and institutional investors held
risky CDOs,they became reluctant to lend to any ﬁnancial organisation.That was a credit crunch.
The credit crunch was worsened by the inability of mortgage lenders to sell their packages of
mortgage debts. Sales of such packages funded further mortgage lending. Buyers of the packages
STRUCTURED PRODUCTS
667

became reluctant to buy because of the risks of default.When the mortgage lenders were unable
to sell the packages, they were restricted in their ability to make new mortgage loans.
Some hedge funds had borrowed in order to buy the risky tranches of CDOs.This leveraged
buying yielded high returns because the interest on the risky CDOs was much higher than the
interest on the money borrowed to buy them.When mortgage defaults removed value from the
CDOs, the hedge funds made losses.The banks, which had lent to the hedge funds, demanded
repayment of their loans.The hedge funds sold assets, such as shares, in order to repay the loans.
In consequence stock markets fell.A number of hedge funds found that their liabilities exceeded
their assets and hence failed with the effect that the investors in those hedge funds lost all of their
investments.
A number of banks and hedge funds had increased the risks by using carry trades.That involved
borrowing in a low interest rate currency,typically the Japanese yen,in order to fund the purchase
of high-yielding US dollar CDOs.When problems emerged with CDOs attempts were made to
unwind the carry trades.Unwinding the carry trades required the purchase of Japanese yen in order
to repay the loans denominated in Japanese yen.The increased demand for the yen caused the
value of the yen to rise against the US dollar.So the problems faced by banks and hedge funds were
worsened by the rise in the value of their liabilities (yen debts) relative to the value of their assets
(dollar CDOs) associated with the adverse changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.
CONCLUSION
Options provide the means to structure investment packages tailored to the speciﬁc needs of
investors.Options funds,which provide gains from rising stock markets whilst protecting against
losses, could suit loss-averse investors. Prospect theory indicates that many investors are loss-
averse, such that they are prepared to forego some potential gains in order to avoid losses.
High yield funds use the receipts from the sale of options to enhance the income available to
investors, albeit at the possible cost of capital value. Such funds could appeal to investors who
require a high income whilst exhibiting mental accounting between capital and income.The mental
accounting results in a ‘never touch the capital’ attitude based on the perception that erosion of
the capital reduces future income potential.
Structured products are widely offered by institutional investors to retail consumers.They have
a very wide variety of forms. Most make use of options in order to achieve risk-return
characteristics that would be impossible without options.

Chapter 35
Warrants, convertibles,
and split-caps
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Warrants.
2. Convertible bonds (convertibles).
3. Split-capital investment trusts.
WARRANTS
Warrants are long-term options.They may have expiry dates that lie as much as ﬁve years or
more in the future (in contrast to stock options which often have a maximum life of nine
months). Most warrants are issued by the company upon whose shares they are based. If
they are exercised, the company will issue new shares. So, unlike options, warrants are usually
used as a means of raising corporate ﬁnance.The issuing company receives the money from
the sale of the warrants and subsequently receives the money paid upon exercise. In contrast
to options, warrants entail the expansion of the number of shares in issue. This can be to
the disadvantage of existing shareholders in that future proﬁts are divided among a larger
number of shares (this is known as dilution); in consequence dividends per share may be
reduced.
Warrants are often attached to newly issued corporate bonds when the warrants are issued.
The presence of the warrants renders the bonds more attractive to investors, and hence the
issuing company can raise money on more advantageous terms in that it needs to pay a lower
rate of interest (a lower coupon rate) than would otherwise be the case. In most instances,
the warrant is detachable from the host bond and can be traded in its own right. Some war-
rants are issued naked, that is without the presence of corporate bonds. Since warrants pay
no dividend or coupon, they provide an issuing company with a source of ﬁnance that involves
no servicing costs. Servicing costs (dividend payments) do not arise until the warrants
are exercised.
669

Covered Warrants
Covered warrants (sometimes called third-party warrants) might be written without any
involvement of the company on whose stock the warrants are based.They do not entail the issue
of new shares upon exercise.Covered warrants may be either calls or puts,whereas other warrants
tend to be calls. Many covered warrants are written on stock indices or foreign currencies.
The Capital Fulcrum Point
The capital fulcrum point is the minimum annual percentage increase in the share price that makes
it worthwhile to hold a warrant on a share rather than the share itself; it is the rate at which
percentage returns on the warrant overtake the percentage returns on the share.Share price rises
greater than the capital fulcrum point render the warrants preferable to the shares.The rate of share
price rise up to the warrant expiry date is the relevant rate.
The existence of a capital fulcrum point arises from two factors:(1) the existence of time value
and (2) the effect of gearing.The increase in intrinsic value, caused by the share price rise, must
exceed the loss in time value resulting from the passage of time. So the share price must rise at a
particular rate simply for the holder of the warrant to break even.There would be a further rise
in the share price required for the gain on the warrant to catch up with the gain on the share.This
catching up is possible because of the gearing offered by the warrant.
The formula for the capital fulcrum point is:
CFP  {[k/(s  w)]1/t  1}  100%
where CFP is the capital fulcrum point,k is the strike price of the warrant,s is the share price,
w is the price of the warrant, and t is the number of years to the expiry date of the warrant.
For example suppose that the strike price is 100,the current share price is 145,the price of the
warrant is 80,and expiry is in ﬁve years.Application of the formula provides a capital fulcrum point
of 9% p.a. If the share price rises at a faster rate, the warrant is the better investment. If the share
price increases at a slower rate, the share provides the higher percentage rate of return.
CONVERTIBLES
A convertible might be looked upon as a corporate bond with an attached warrant (which cannot
be detached from the bond).Convertibles are often referred to as convertible bonds (or convertible
unsecured loan stock, since most are unsecured) and involve the right to convert the bonds into
shares at speciﬁed rates and points in time.The investor pays nothing to convert apart from
surrendering the convertible bond.The period prior to the ﬁrst possible date for conversion is
known as the rest period.
The usual arrangement is for conversion into the shares of the company, which issues the
convertible bond. Occasionally the conversion is into the shares of a different company, in which
case the instrument is called an exchangeable bond.Some convertibles provide the right to convert
to other bonds rather than shares. Convertible preference shares are preference shares with the
right to convert to ordinary shares.
The number of shares for which the convertible bond can be exchanged is referred to as the
conversion rate.So,for example,the convertible may allow the conversion of £100 par (nominal)
STOCK OPTIONS
670

value of loan stock into 20 shares.Multiplication of the conversion rate by the share price provides
the conversion value.A share price of £6 would imply a conversion value of £120. In some cases
the conversion rate declines over the life of the convertible bond.A convertible bond would also
exhibit an investment, or straight bond, value.This is the value of the bond in the absence of the
right to convert.The investment value is the price of a corresponding straight bond.
The market value (price) of a convertible would normally be higher than the greater of the
conversion and investment values.The excess of the market value over the greater of the conversion
or investment value is often referred to as the premium. Figure 35.1 illustrates the relationship
between the conversion, investment, and market values of a convertible. It is assumed that the
conversion rate is 20 and that the investment value is £90 per £100 par value.The market value
(price) of the convertible is shown as the broken line.
The investment value,and hence the strike price of the implicit option,is not immutable.A rise
in interest rates would lower the investment value and strike price.Similar effects would arise from
a decline in the credit standing of the company.Such a decline in credit standing requires a higher
rate of return which, given a constant coupon, implies a fall in the price of the straight bond. (It
would also be expected that the investment value line would cease to be a horizontal straight line
as the share price approaches zero.The investment value would be expected to fall as the stock
price declines towards zero since the risk of default increases.)
Convertibles are hybrids in that they constitute a compromise between bonds and shares.They
provide more upside exposure to share price movements than bonds,but less than ordinary shares.
They provide less downside protection than bonds, but more than shares.The percentage rate of
dividend or coupon yield would be less than that of a straight bond (because the market value
exceeds the investment value),but probably more than that of the ordinary share (a rate of dividend

yield on the share that exceeds the rate of coupon yield on the convertible would probably induce
conversion of the convertible into the share).
The fact that a convertible involves a lower rate of coupon yield than a straight bond renders it
attractive to the issuer.The attached warrant causes the investor to require a lower coupon yield.
Convertibles thus provide a cheaper source of ﬁnance than bonds or preference shares.Their
advantage over ordinary shares, from the point of view of the issuer, is that they constitute a form
of deferred equity.In particular,voting rights do not accrue to the holder until conversion takes place.
Holders of a convertible have the right to convert during a conversion period.If conversion does
not take place during that period, the convertible simply becomes a bond. So, for example, a
convertible might offer the right to convert on 1 June of the sixth,seventh,eighth,ninth,or tenth
year of its life. If conversion does not take place on any of those dates it then becomes a bond
maturing at the end of a life of a further ten years,at which point it would be redeemed at par.The
period between the last possible conversion date and the maturity date of the bond is known as
the stub (it is possible for the maturity date to coincide with the last possible conversion date).
The conversion rate would normally imply a high purchase price of the share (if acquired
through conversion) on the issue date of the convertible so that a signiﬁcant share price advance
would be necessary for conversion to become worthwhile.The conversion price is the market
value of the convertible divided by the number of shares obtained upon conversion;but sometimes
it is defined as the par (nominal) value divided by the number of shares. At the time that the
convertible is issued, the conversion price will be greater than the share price.
The question arises as to why the holder of a convertible would exercise the right to convert,
since it might be expected that the market value would exceed the conversion value so that the sale
of the convertible appears to be preferable to conversion.The circumstances in which conversion
would take place are (1) call by the issuing corporation,(2) the existence of a ﬁnal conversion date,
or (3) the dividend yield of the share rising above the coupon yield of the convertible.
Sometimes the issuer of the convertible has the right to call it.This means that the holder must
either accept redemption of the convertible (probably at the par value of the bond) or convert it
into shares. If the latter provides the greater value, conversion will take place.When the ﬁnal
conversion date passes, the implicit option disappears, leaving only the investment value of the
convertible. If the conversion value exceeds the investment value on the ﬁnal conversion date, it
would be rational to exercise the right to convert.
The excess of the conversion price over the share price,when expressed as a percentage of the
share price, is known as the conversion premium:
Conversion price  Market value of convertible / Number of shares on conversion
Conversion premium (%)  {(Conversion price  Share price) / Share price}  100
In most circumstances the conversion premium would be positive.However,a time may come
when the dividend on the share exceeds the coupon on the convertible (the coupon is ﬁxed,
whereas the dividend is likely to rise over time). If conversion dates are at distant intervals (such
as a year apart), the prospect of a lower rate of yield on the convertible than on the share could
render it less valuable than the shares into which it might be converted.So a share dividend above
the coupon of the convertible, together with a long time before the next conversion date, could
entail a negative conversion premium.The prospect of a negative conversion premium subsequent
to a conversion date could lead to conversion on that date.

is £1.10p. Conversion can take place on 1 June of the ﬁfth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years.
(a) Calculate the conversion value.
(b) What would be the signiﬁcance for the market value of the convertible if conversion could
take place in year ﬁve only, rather than in any of the four years?
Answers
(a) Conversion value  100  £1.10  £110
(b) The ability to convert in year ﬁve only would reduce the time to expiry of the implicit option
and hence would reduce its time value. So the convertible should have a lower market value
(price).
SPLIT-CAPITAL INVESTMENT TRUSTS
Closed-end funds, such as investment trusts, have become the source of various ﬁnancially
engineered investments. One approach has been to divide funds into income shares and capital
shares. Buyers of income shares receive all of the dividends from the fund but are entitled to only
a pre-set amount of capital,which could be the initial share price,when the fund is wound up.The
holders of the capital shares of such a split-capital investment trust receive all or most of the capital
growth from the fund.
Such a split-capital investment trust has a predetermined date (maturity date) on which the
assets of the fund are sold and the proceeds returned to investors in the fund. In other words, a
split-capital investment trust has a maturity date on which it is wound up.
Another way in which a closed-end fund (investment trust) might take a split-capital form is
through division into geared ordinary shares and zero dividend preference shares (sometimes
referred to simply as zeros).Money raised from the issue of zero dividend preference shares is used
to fund additional investment by the investment trust.The fund is thus geared (i.e.partly ﬁnanced
by borrowing) and in consequence the ordinary shares of the fund can be regarded as being geared.
A geared ordinary share might be looked upon as an ordinary share partly financed through
borrowing by means of the issue of zero dividend preference shares.Geared ordinary shares receive
all of the dividends and some of the capital growth.(Strictly speaking,the sale of preference shares
is an issue of equity rather than borrowing.However the effect is the same as borrowing by means
of selling bonds.The issue of preference shares is equivalent to borrowing.)
The zero dividend preference shares would have redemption values above their initial issue
price.The difference between the redemption value and the issue price of the zero dividend
preference shares provides the investment return to their holders.If fund growth were more than
what is required to meet the redemption value, the surplus growth would accrue to the holders
of the geared ordinary shares.

cases in which share prices halve or double, what would be the outcome if the investment trust
had invested (entirely) in other investment trusts with 100% gearing?

(a) If the portfolio return is 0% p.a. but 6% must be paid on a sum equal to the principal
investment, the rate of return on the principal investment would be 6% p.a.
(b) If the total portfolio return is 3% p.a.,this is equivalent to 6% p.a.on the principal investment
since the total portfolio is double the principal investment.There is 6% p.a.interest on a sum
equal to the principal investment. So the net return is 6%  6%  0% p.a.
(c) If the total portfolio return is 8% p.a.,this is equivalent to 16% p.a.on the principal investment
since the total portfolio is double the principal investment.There is 6% p.a.interest on a sum
equal to the principal investment. So the net return is 16%  6%  10% p.a.
(d) If the total portfolio return is 15% p.a., this is equivalent to 30% p.a. on the principal
investment. So the net return on the principal investment is 30%  6%  24% p.a.
(e) If the value of the shares held by the investment trust suddenly halved in value, there would
be a loss equal to the principal investment (the value of the total portfolio was double the value
of the principal investment).The assets would now be matched by liabilities (investments
matched by debts) meaning that the investors have lost all their money but the debt can be
repaid.
If the investments had been in investment trusts with 100% gearing,the investments would
now be worth nothing.There would be liabilities but no assets.The investment trust defaults
on its debts.(This type of situation faced investors in UK split-capital investment trusts in the
early 2000s, when the holders of preference shares – effectively lenders to the investment
trusts – lost their investments along with the other investors in the investment trusts.)
(f) If the value of the shares had suddenly doubled, the value of the shareholding would be
four times the original principal investment. Net of the debt, the investment trust (its NAV)
would be three times the value of the original principal investment. Investors would have
tripled their wealth as a result of the doubling of share prices (ignoring any changes in
discounts/premiums).
If the investments had been in investment trusts with 100% gearing, the total investment
portfolio would have tripled in value (since each investment trust would be worth three
times its original principal investment). Investments would then be six times the original

principal value;and after subtracting the debt,investors would have seen their wealth increase
ﬁve-fold.
In cases (e) and (f) if the portfolio of the investment trust were invested in geared investment
trusts which also invested in geared investment trusts, the upward and downward effects
would be intensiﬁed. In the UK in the early 2000s there was a ‘magic circle’ of split-capital
investment trusts,which were geared and invested in one another.The fall in the stock market
between 2000 and 2003 wiped out the value of many individuals’ investments in the split-
capital investment trusts.When an investment trust is geared and invests in other geared
investment trusts (which in their turn might invest in geared investment trusts) the result is
a hugely exaggerated effect of stock market movements.
During the 1990s in the UK, many investment trust issues combined both aspects of splitting.
Those split-capital investment trusts had a predetermined maturity date on which the fund would
be wound up and the capital of the fund distributed to shareholders.Typically they had dividend
(income) shares, which paid out all of the dividends from the fund plus a capped return of capital
at maturity.The capped return of capital entailed an upper limit to the capital to be returned at
maturity. In addition there were capital shares that paid out any residual capital value at maturity,
but which paid no dividends.The third component was,typically,zero dividend preference shares.
These are similar to zero coupon bonds in that they pay no coupons during the life of the share but
pay a predetermined capital sum when the investment trust matures.
Effectively these split-capital investment trusts stripped portfolios of shares into component
parts,and traded those components separately on the stock market.Some of the investment trusts
also traded composite units, which combined the components into shares similar to the shares of
conventional investment trusts. Example 35.1 shows the capital structure of a hypothetical split-
capital investment trust.
WARRANTS, CONVERTIBLES, AND SPLIT-CAPS
675

So if the investment trust in Example 35.1 raised £100 million at issue, £25 million would have
been from the sale of income shares, £25 million from the sale of capital shares, and £50 million
from the sale of zero dividend preference shares. Some of these may have been combined into
composite units.The zero dividend preference shares are similar to zero coupon bonds and hence
could be regarded as a form of debt ﬁnance.In other words,50% of the funding is equity (income
shares and capital shares) and 50% is from borrowing (zero coupon preference shares).
All of the dividends from the £100 million fund are paid to the investors who paid £25 million
for the income (dividend) shares.Their dividend yield is thus quadrupled.For example,a 3% p.a.
dividend yield on the whole fund becomes 12% p.a. for the holders of the dividend shares.There
is a doubling of the dividend yield from the split into income and capital shares, and a further
doubling from the sale of zero dividend preference shares.
The holders of the capital shares bear a high proportion of the risk. Suppose that all shares
(income, capital, and zero dividend preference) were issued at £1 each.There are 25 million
income shares, 25 million capital shares, and 50 million zero dividend preference shares. At
maturity the holders of the income shares receive £25 million and the holders of the zero dividend
preference shares receive £100 million (£2  50 million). Since the holders of the capital shares
receive the residual value of the fund, the capital value of the fund must rise by at least 25% (to
£125 million) before the holders of capital shares receive anything. It must rise by 50% (to £150)
simply to pay back the initial investment into the capital shares. However since any excess above
£150 million accrues entirely to the holders of capital shares, the holders of those shares could
experience very high rates of return.The holders of the capital shares thus have high risk but also
the potential for high rates of return.The investors in capital shares accept a disproportionate
amount of the risk of the total fund.The investors in income and zero dividend preference shares
have correspondingly lowered risks.
Split-capital investment trusts can be interpreted as option structures. Consider the case of a
split-capital investment trust divided into income and capital shares but without zero dividend
preference shares (or other debt).The holders of the capital shares of such a split-capital investment
trust receive all or most of the capital growth from the fund.In effect they hold call options on the
fund, with the capital returnable to holders of income shares constituting the strike price of the
call options.
The holders of the income shares of a split-capital trust are effectively the sellers (writers) of
put options, since there is a maximum return of capital but no minimum other than zero. If the
fund becomes bankrupt, there will be no capital to be returned to investors.
The combined position of the holders of the income and capital shares is illustrated in Figure
35.2.Adding the values of the income and capital shares produces the value of an ordinary share
(an ordinary share is equivalent to an income share plus a capital share).Figure 35.2 illustrates the
case in which the capital returnable to holders of income shares equals the initial (issue) price of
the ordinary shares.
Split-capital investment trusts that issue zero dividend preference shares (or borrow in
another way) add a further option dimension. Borrowing to ﬁnance investment constitutes
gearing.This is equivalent to the gearing provided by a call option. So the holders of capital
shares of a split-capital investment trust, which has an issue of zero dividend preference shares in
addition to the income/capital share split, effectively have a compound option (an option on
an option).

SHARES AND BONDS AS OPTIONS
The situations of shareholders and bondholders can be analysed by using option theory.Shares can
be seen as call options, on the value of a company, with a strike price of zero. Bondholders can be
seen as having written (sold) put options.
Figure 35.3 shows the value of the company shares (in total) as a function of the value of the
company.The call options (shares) have no intrinsic value until the value of the company is greater
than the value of its debt. It is here assumed that bonds are the only debt.The value of the bonds
(in total) will be equal to B so long as the value of the company is at least equal to B. If the value
of the company is less than B, the value of the bonds will equal the value of the company. If the
company is liquidated when its value is below B,all the proceeds of liquidation will be paid to the

bondholders (and none would be available for shareholders).The value of the shares plus the value
of the bonds equals the value of the company.
Figure 35.3 does not consider the time value of the options.When time value is included the
call options (shares) increase in price if the expected volatility of the value of the company increases.
In other words, increased risk increases share prices.This effect is magniﬁed if the option loses
intrinsic value; that is if the net value of the company approaches the strike price of zero.When
the net value of the company is zero, shares can be seen as at-the-money options.Time value is at
its highest when an option is at-the-money. High time value entails high sensitivity to changes in
expected volatility of the value of the company.An increase in expected volatility can substantially
increase the option time value,and hence the share price.A low net value of the company increases
the desirability of accepting risk since the additional risk could considerably enhance the share price.
An increase in risk (expected volatility) worsens the position of option writers.An option is a
liability to the writer and therefore an increase in risk, by increasing the value of that liability,
works against option writers.So an increase in the expected volatility of the value of the company
would worsen the position of bondholders; that is it would reduce the value of bonds.This effect
would be particularly strong if the net value of the company (assets minus debts) is close to zero,
since the put options would be close to their strike price. It follows that increased risk taking by
the company,particularly when the company has little net value,can be expected to reduce bond
prices whilst increasing share prices.
This analysis can be extended to the case of investment trusts that are geared as a result of
issuing preference shares.After all,an investment trust is a company.In Figure 35.3 the strike price
of the call option (geared ordinary share) would be at a net asset value of zero,and preference shares

would replace bonds.The advantage of high risk taking for the shareholders might help to explain
why so many split-capital investment trusts bought shares in other split-capital investment trusts
(which were rendered high risk by their gearing).The disadvantage of high risk investing for the
holders of the preference shares underlines the error made by marketing the zero dividend
preference shares as low risk investments.
CONCLUSION
Some stock-exchange-traded investments have similarities to options.Warrants are long-term call
options,normally on the shares of the company issuing the warrants.Convertibles are bonds with
the right to exchange the bonds for shares of the company issuing the convertibles.They are
somewhat similar to bonds with attached call options.Split-capital investment trusts are investment
trusts, which are divided into income shares and capital shares.The income and capital shares
could be interpreted as option positions. Even ordinary shares and bonds could be interpreted as
option positions.
Convertibles could appeal to investors who are both loss-averse and prone to mental accounting.
The bond dimension of a convertible gives protection against loss from stock price falls.The bond
component also yields a greater income than the shares would.Convertibles could thus appeal to
investors whose mental accounting leads them to take a ‘never touch the capital approach’ whilst
requiring a relatively high ﬂow of income from their investments.
Investment trusts can have a dual relationship to these option-like investments.The investment
trust funds can invest in warrants,convertibles,and split-capital investment trusts.Also there can
be warrants based on investment trusts, convertibles that convert into investment trusts, and
investment trusts can have a split-capital structure.This means that very highly geared investments
are available. For example a warrant on an investment trust, which invests in warrants, is a very
highly geared investment.Small rises in the stock market can result in huge percentage gains,and
small market falls can cause very large losses. In the early 2000s many split-capital investment
trusts invested in other split-capital investment trusts.They provided extraordinarily high returns
when the stock market was rising, but many investors found that their investments became
worthless when the stock market fell.

Chapter 36
Option pricing and the
Black-Scholes model
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The determinants of option prices.
2. The Black-Scholes option pricing model.
3. The meaning and signiﬁcance of early exercise.
OPTION PRICES AS THE COSTS OF REPLICATION
One way of looking at option prices is to see the option price as the expected cost of replicating the
option.Option positions can be replicated by positions in the stock (or other underlying instrument).
The positions in the stock should provide the same proﬁt/loss outcome as the option being
replicated.The amount of the stock should reﬂect the option delta.The delta is the change in the
option price resulting from a 1p change in the stock price.For example,an option on £1 million of
the stock with a delta of 0.7 would tend to give the same proﬁt or loss as £700,000 of the stock.
Such replication will involve cash ﬂows. Replicating long option positions (bought options)
involves buying shares when the price of the stock rises and selling when it falls.This is because a
rise in the price of the stock causes an increase in delta and hence the need to buy more of the stock.
Conversely,a fall in price lowers delta and necessitates selling.Buying high and selling low entails
a net cash outflow.The theoretical value of the option equals the expected losses from such
transactions. So replicating long option positions results in losses that correspond to the value of
the replicated option.Conversely,the replication of a short option position would be expected to
provide proﬁts that correspond to the value of the option.The cost of replicating an option is the
basis for Black-Scholes option pricing.
THE DETERMINANTS OF OPTION PRICES
Probably the most popular way of calculating the ‘fair price’of an option is by means of the Black-
Scholes model. An intuitive feel for this model can be obtained by regarding it as equating the

OPTION PRICING AND THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL
681
price (premium) with the expected pay-off from an option. Expected pay-off is used in the sense
of possible pay-off outcomes weighted by their probabilities of occurrence (i.e. statistical
expectation).
Figure 36.1 illustrates this with respect to options on the FTSE 100 stock index.The curve in
the upper part of Figure 36.1 is a normal distribution curve and indicates the probabilities of the
various possible outcomes.The proﬁle ABC in the lower part shows the pay-off possibilities from
buying a call option.
Suppose that the area under the normal distribution curve between 1,600 and 1,610, as a
proportion of the total area under the curve, is 0.19.This means that there is a 19% chance that
the index will fall between 1,600 and 1,610.If the area under the curve between 1,610 and 1,620
is 0.15 of the total area, there is a 15% probability of the index being between 1,610 and 1,620.
The statistical expectation of the pay-off from the call option is given by the sum of the possible
pay-offs when each possible pay-off is weighted by its probability of occurrence.The calculation
of this expected pay-off is illustrated by Table 36.1 in which, for the sake of simpliﬁcation, the
possible pay-offs are represented by the mid-points of the respective ranges. (Note that the
probabilities are themselves expectations.)
Table 36.1 involves some simpliﬁcations that would be avoided in the actual calculation of
expected pay-off. In particular, the mid-point of a range is not the best measure of the average
possible outcome within the range.Nevertheless,the table serves to illustrate the principles behind
the calculation of the fair price of an option using the Black-Scholes model.In the example shown
the fair price of the option, expressed in index points, is 8.20.At £10 per index point, this would
correspond to a money price of £82 per contract.(The FTSE 100 options traded on LIFFE are based
on £10 per index point.) The option price estimated by means of the model is referred to as the
fair (or theoretical) price.The fair price may differ from the option price observed in the market.
Intrinsic value is the pay-off from immediate exercise of an option.In the case of an in-the-money
call option,intrinsic value is the stock price minus the strike price.Time value is the excess of the

option price over the intrinsic value.Time value is at its greatest when the option is at-the-
money (i.e. when the stock price equals the strike price) and declines as the option moves to
being either in-the-money or out-of-the-money.This behaviour of time value can be explained
intuitively.
An out-of-the-money option has to reach the at-the-money position before movements of the
index can start generating opportunities for exercise.Thus,an option buyer would regard an out-
of-the-money option as less valuable than an at-the-money option since some leeway has to be made
up before it reaches the threshold of pay-offs from exercise, whereas an at-the-money option is
already at this threshold.Consequently,the option buyer is prepared to pay less for an out-of-the-
money option. Conversely, the option writer would accept a lower price because of the reduced
chance of loss.(This line of reasoning also underlines the role of the market forces of demand and
supply in the establishment of option prices.Black-Scholes calculations merely serve as guidelines
to buyers and writers.)
The time value of an in-the-money option would be lower than if that option were at-the-
money because of the possibility of erosion of the intrinsic value.In the case of a call option,a rise
in the index would increase the intrinsic value of options that were either in-the-money or at-the-
money prior to the rise in the index.However,a fall in the index would reduce the intrinsic value
of an in-the-money option, whereas an at-the-money option has no intrinsic value to be eroded.
This potential for loss of intrinsic value is reﬂected in a lower time value.
Another determinant of option prices is the expected volatility of the index.A high volatility
would mean that the normal distribution of Figure 36.1 would spread out and ﬂatten, indicating
an increased chance of extreme values of the index.A calculation similar to that of Table 36.1 but
with a normal distribution curve exhibiting a greater variance would produce a higher expected
pay-off.Thus the fair price of the option rises as expected volatility increases,since the probability
of high pay-offs is enhanced.

OPTION PRICING AND THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL
683
The term ‘volatility’ can be seen as referring to the standard deviation of the distribution of
possible spot prices at the end of a particular period of time. (More accurately, the distribution is
log normal rather than normal.) This standard deviation depends upon the length of time involved.
The standard deviation will increase as the period lengthens (graphically depicted by the normal
distribution curve becoming wider and ﬂatter), since the likelihood of substantial movements
from the original price becomes greater.
The standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the period of time involved.So the
volatility over t days is equal to the square root of t times the daily volatility.
This relationship between volatility and the square root of time explains the observed pattern
of time value decline (decay).Time value is related to the square root of the amount of time
remaining before expiry of the option.Time value decays at an accelerating rate as the expiry date
is approached.This pattern of time value decay,which is slow when expiry is distant but becomes
rapid close to expiry, is illustrated in Figure 36.2.Time value reaches zero on the expiry date of
the option.
As an illustration, consider the decline in the period to expiry from 100 days to 81 days.The
square root moves from 10 to 9.The passage of time from 4 days to 1 day to expiry moves the square
root from 2 to 1. So the impact on volatility from the passage of 3 days, when expiry is close, is
the same as the passage of 19 days (10081) when expiry is distant.Volatility,and hence time value,
declines more rapidly as expiry is approached.
From what has just been said, it is clear that time to expiry also inﬂuences the option price.
Longer periods to expiry are associated with higher option prices.A long period to expiry provides
more opportunity for the index to move sufﬁciently above a call option strike price (or below a
put option strike price) to generate substantial intrinsic value.The enhanced likelihood of a
substantial pay-off would tend to raise the price that a buyer is prepared to pay and that a writer
would need to receive. (The point could alternatively be expressed in terms of a longer period
leading to a greater variance of the (log) normal distribution curve.)
Interest rates also have an inﬂuence on option prices.The inﬂuence of interest rates can be
understood by seeing options as a means of changing the timing of transactions in the underlying
stock.An investor can buy call options with the intention of taking delivery of the corresponding
shares when the option expires, and in the meantime can receive interest on the money that will
be used.The attractiveness of this procedure relative to buying the shares immediately is improved
by a rise in interest rates payable on the money held. It follows that when interest rates are high,
Time value

Figure 36.2

the demand for call options will be somewhat greater, and option prices will be boosted by this
additional demand.
Put options can be used to postpone the sale of shares. Instead of selling shares immediately,
the investor might buy put options with the intention of selling shares in the future. Pending the
sale of the shares, the investor would forgo interest on the money that would have been received
from an immediate sale. Using puts in this way becomes less attractive as the interest receipts
forgone rise. So investors are less likely to buy puts for this purpose when interest rates are high.
High interest rates are therefore associated with a somewhat lower demand for put options and
hence lower put option prices.
In the case of stock options,the prospect of an ex-dividend date can have an impact on the price
of an option.When a stock goes ex-dividend its price falls by an amount approximately equal to
the anticipated dividend. So an ex-dividend date can be seen as providing a price fall that is
anticipated.The share price fall will cause a reduction in the prices of call options and an increase
in those of put options.The option prices would normally discount the anticipated fall in the share
price well before the ex-dividend date.
Two points are worth emphasising about the roles of volatility and time to expiry.The ﬁrst is
that whereas increases in these variables would increase potential losses as well as potential proﬁts
on the underlying instrument, for example a stock index or a stock, the asymmetrical nature of
options means that potential proﬁts are enhanced more than potential losses.This is because once
the stock price is below the strike price of a call option (or above the strike price of a put option),
any further stock price falls (increases) would not bring about increased losses in terms of intrinsic
value. If an option is at-the-money or out-of-the-money, there is no potential for loss of intrinsic
value.
The second point is that time value can be divided into two components.One might be regarded
as the ﬁnancing-cost component and corresponds to K  K(1  r)t,where K is the strike price,
r the interest rate,and t the time to expiry.This component is not affected by market expectations
of volatility and is a linear function of time to expiry. It is the means whereby short-term interest
rates have a direct impact on option prices.
The other component of time value might be termed volatility value.It is the part of the option
price that is inﬂuenced by market expectations of volatility. It is also the component whose value
tends to be (at least according to the Black-Scholes model) a function of the square root of time
to expiry.
THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL
The Black-Scholes model, with its variants, is probably the most commonly used option pricing
model.This is despite its shortcomings, in particular its inability to allow for exercise prior to
expiry (this failure to allow for early exercise means that strictly it is applicable only to European-
style options). One reason for its popularity is that it allows for an analytical solution; this means
that there is a formula into which certain values are input and from which an option price is
forthcoming.This formula,when programmed into a computer or calculator,can produce option
prices within seconds.

OPTION PRICING AND THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL
685
The most basic Black-Scholes model (Black and Scholes 1973; Merton 1973) relates to non-
dividend paying stocks. It can be expressed as follows:
C  SN(d1)  KertN(d2)
d1
 0.5√t
d2 
 0.5√t
where C is the call option price,S is the stock price,N( ) is the cumulative normal distribution
function,K is the strike price,e is the exponential (which has the constant value of 2.7182818 and
appears on most hand-held calculators),r is the risk-free (annualised continuous) interest rate (as
a decimal), t is the time to expiry (in years), and  (sigma) is the volatility (annualised standard
deviation of stock returns) as a decimal.(It should be noted that,although this exposition focuses
on call options, there are corresponding equations for put options.)
The expression ert is a discount term similar to 1/(1  r)t and as such it determines the
present value of a future sum of money. A distinctive feature of ert is that it discounts on a
continuous basis. Continuous discounting parallels continuous compounding.To appreciate the
signiﬁcance of continuous compounding,consider the alternatives of receiving 12% payable to an
annual basis,6% six-monthly,and 1% monthly.The annualised receipts are 1.12,(1.06)2  1.1236
and (1.01)12  1.1268 respectively,corresponding to annual interest rates of 12%,12.36%,and
12.68%.The frequency of compounding affects the ﬁnal outcome.The effective interest rate
increases as the frequency of compounding rises.Continuous compounding is based on an inﬁnite
number of inﬁnitely small periods (although it can normally be thought of as daily compounding).
Likewise,the effect of discounting depends upon the time periods;for example annual discounting
at 12% p.a. gives a discount term of 1/(1.12)  0.8929, whereas continuous discounting over a
year at 12% p.a. provides a discount term equal to e0.12  0.8869.
It is also necessary to be aware of the meaning of N(d), the cumulative normal
distribution function.This is based on a standardised normal distribution. N(d1) is the area under
the distribution to the left of d1 and N(d2) is the area to the left of d2. Standardised normal
distributions have total areas of 1 so that N(d1) is the probability of d being d1 or less (likewise for
d2). N(d1) can be interpreted as the probability of the call option being in-the-money at expiry.
Areas under the standardised normal distribution to the left of particular values can be ascertained
from tables (as illustrated by the ensuing exercises) or by means of computer or calculator
programmes.
In the equations for d1 and d2, the term ln (S/K) appears.This is the natural logarithm of the
price relative (ratio of stock price to strike price).The model uses a lognormal rather than a normal
distribution.It is a normal distribution of logarithms.One reason for using a lognormal distribution
is that the price relative can never be negative (since the stock price cannot be negative),and hence
the price relatives cannot be normally distributed.The natural logarithm of the price relative can
be negative and hence can be normally distributed.
Probably the best way to get a feel for the model is through worked exercises.

So the fair price of the call option is estimated to be 10.51p per share (to two decimal places).
(10,510p, i.e. £105.10p for an option contract on 1,000 shares.)
EARLY EXERCISE
Early exercise refers to the exercise of an American-style option before the option expires
(European-style options cannot be exercised before expiry). In the case of call options, it would
never be rational to exercise an option on a non-dividend paying stock prior to expiry,since selling
the option would always be preferable.By selling the option both the time and intrinsic values would
be received, whereas exercise of the option would provide the intrinsic value only. It follows that
American-style options on non-dividend paying stocks are equivalent to European-style options
and can therefore be valued using the basic Black-Scholes model.The basic Black-Scholes model
(described in this chapter) does not allow for the possibility of early exercise.
It may be rational to exercise a call option on a dividend paying stock before expiry.The optimum
moment for such early exercise is just before the stock goes ex-dividend.(When a stock goes ex-
dividend the existing holder becomes eligible for the next dividend even if the shares are
subsequently sold before the dividend is paid; so a buyer foregoes the next dividend.) When the
stock goes ex-dividend its price falls by the amount of dividend that had been expected.This
reduction in the stock price entails a decline in the intrinsic value of a call option. If this potential
loss of intrinsic value exceeds the time value that would exist subsequent to the ex-dividend date,
it would be rational to exercise the option before it goes ex-dividend.In this case the intrinsic value
just before the ex-dividend date exceeds the prospective total value just after it.Another way of
looking at the point is in terms of dividend capture.By exercising before the ex-dividend date,the
right to the dividend is ensured and, if the value of the expected dividend is greater than the
prospective time value subsequent to (or on the) ex-dividend day,the option should be exercised.
The optimum time for the early exercise is immediately before the stock goes ex-dividend,because
such timing will minimise the ﬁnancing costs of holding the stock.
In the case of American-style put options,early exercise may be rational whether or not the stock
pays dividends. Consider the case in which a holder of stock has bought put options with a view
to guaranteeing a minimum selling price.When the option is exercised the proceeds can be put
on deposit to earn interest. Early exercise is rational when those prospective interest receipts
exceed the time value of the option. Another way of seeing the same point is in terms of the
prospective interest receipts exceeding the value of the possible increases in intrinsic value net of
possible decreases (time value being the value of possible increases in intrinsic value net of the risk
of losses in intrinsic value).Yet another way of interpreting the point is based on the minimum value
STOCK OPTIONS

OPTION PRICING AND THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL

of a European-style put being K/(1  rt)  S, while that of the equivalent American-style put is
K  S. If the difference, K  K/(1  rt), exceeds the time value (speciﬁcally volatility value), it
would be possible to exercise an American-style put and use the proceeds to buy a European-style
put while retaining part of the proceeds of exercise as cash.Again, this is based on a comparison
of prospective interest receipts and time value.
In the case of put options on dividend paying stocks, it may be rational to delay exercise until
after the stock has gone ex-dividend, particularly if the dividend is expected to be large. By such
a delay the dividend is obtained and, since the receipt upon exercise (the strike price) is the same
irrespective of whether the stock is cum- or ex-dividend, it makes sense to wait until the right to
the dividend is secured before exercising the option. (A stock is cum-dividend before it goes ex-
dividend.)
In the cases of both call and put options,at the time when it is rational to exercise early the price
of the option should equal its intrinsic value. No one should pay more than the intrinsic value for
an option that is about to be exercised.This prospective absence of time value should be reﬂected
in the price of the option at earlier stages; in effect, the date on which early exercise is rational
would be treated as the effective expiry date of the option when valuing it prior to that date.
CONCLUSION
Some future cash ﬂows are contingent upon the occurrence of events or situations.An asset, or
liability, that exhibits such contingent cash ﬂows is an option.The Black-Scholes model provides
a means of estimating fair prices for options. Discount models, together with a capital market
theory such as the capital asset pricing model, can be used to estimate fair prices for investments
with non-contingent cash ﬂows and option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes model, can
be used to estimate fair prices for contingent cash ﬂows.Option pricing models are thus of major
importance to the theory and practice of valuing assets and liabilities that have future cash ﬂows.
The models are therefore central to ﬁnance since ﬁnance is concerned with pricing investments
and debts that entail future cash ﬂows. Unfortunately the basic Black-Scholes model is limited in
its applicability, and for most uses it needs to be amended or replaced by other models.

Variations on the basic Black-
Scholes option pricing model
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Variations on the basic Black-Scholes model.
2. Defects of Black-Scholes models in relation to pricing bond options.
3. Use of the put-call parity relationship to price put options.
4. The reliability of the Black-Scholes model.
EUROPEAN-STYLE CALL OPTIONS
ON DIVIDEND PAYING STOCKS
To use the Black-Scholes model to value call options on dividend paying stocks, it is necessary to
adjust the stock price by removing the present value of dividends receivable prior to expiry (more
speciﬁcally, the dividends that relate to ex-dividend dates falling before expiry). Once the stock
price is adjusted in this way,the Black-Scholes model (using the adjusted stock price) can be used
in the usual way.
One means of understanding this adjustment process is in terms of the dividend discount model.
According to the dividend discount model,the current stock price is the present (i.e.discounted)
value of all future expected dividends. However, dividends accruing before the expiry date of the
option will be incorporated into the current stock price,but not the stock price on the expiry date.
Option pricing requires the use of the stock price on the one day (expiration day) on which exercise
of the European-style option can occur. So the stock price used in the Black-Scholes model is the
current stock price minus that part of the price that arises from dividends that will not be received
by the holder of expiry-day stock. In other words, the present value of dividends expected prior
to expiry needs to be subtracted from the current stock price in order to ascertain the stock price
to be used in the Black-Scholes model.

EXERCISE 37.1
Shares in stock A are priced at 100p. The interest rate is 6% p.a. and a dividend of 2p is
expected in two months. Expected share price volatility is 20% p.a. Using the Black-Scholes
model estimate the price of a European-style call option with a strike price of 100p and three
months to expiry.
Standardised cumulative normal probabilities are shown in the table.

It might be noted that different interest rates for three months and six months is incon-
sistent with the assumption of the Black-Scholes model that interest rates are constant and the
same for all maturities.The expected volatility of 20% p.a. relates to the six months to expiry,
and the Black-Scholes model assumes that volatility is expected to be constant during the period
to expiry.
EXERCISE 37.3
It is 24 January and shares in the Burnham Bakery plc stand at 100p.The next option expiry date
is 24 March and the next dividend is due in May.The two-month interest rate is 6% p.a. and you
estimate the share price volatility to be 10% p.a. Use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
estimate fair prices for at-the-money American-style call options expiring in March.Why might
the estimated fair prices for options expiring in September be less reliable?

The estimated prices for options expiring in September may be less reliable because (1) there
is a need to adjust the share price by the dividend expected in May, and that dividend may be
uncertain, (2) there is a possibility of early exercise (exercise before expiry) and the basic Black-
Scholes model does not allow for this, and (3) the assumptions of constancy of interest rates and
volatility (two assumptions of the Black-Scholes model) are more likely to be violated over a long
period than over a shorter period.
AMERICAN-STYLE CALL OPTIONS ON DIVIDEND PAYING
STOCKS (BLACK’S APPROXIMATION)
Since the Black-Scholes model is strictly applicable only to European-style options, its use in
valuing American-style options must be regarded as a relatively crude procedure that merely
produces an approximate price.The use of Black’s approximation makes the procedure less crude.
Black’s approximation is based on the principle that the only time that it might be rational to
exercise an American-style call option prior to expiry is just before an ex-dividend date.In the case
of a stock with one ex-dividend date before the option expiry date, there would be two possible
occasions on which a call option might be exercised, these being immediately before the ex-
dividend date and on the expiry date. Effectively there are alternative expiry dates.Two option
prices are calculated:one for each expiry date.The higher of the two prices is used as the estimate
of the option price.
When using Black’s approximation, the stock price is adjusted by removing the present value
of dividends expected prior to expiry.In the case of a stock with just one ex-dividend date before
the option expires, there would be no adjustment to the stock price when the day before the ex-
dividend date is used as the expiry date,but an adjustment would be needed when the actual expiry
date is used (note that when making such adjustments the expected dividends should be discounted
from the prospective date of receipt and not from the ex-dividend date).
EXERCISE 37.4
On 1 January the price of a share,which pays a quarterly dividend of 50p and goes ex-dividend on
1 March and 1 June,is £40.The interest rate is 9% p.a.Outline a way of calculating the approximate
value of a six-month American-style call option.
Answer
The option could be valued by means of Black’s approximation.This approach values the European
option expiring at the same time as the American and the European option that expires just before
STOCK OPTIONS
694

the last ex-dividend date.The higher of the two is used as an approximation to the value of the
American option.
The present value of all dividends accruing before the exercise date (i.e. all dividends not
receivable by the option holder) is subtracted from the current stock price and the resulting ﬁgure
is used in the Black-Scholes formula.So the value used for the stock price when valuing an option
expiring on 1 June would be:
£40  £0.5e0.09  0.167  £40  £0.493  £39.507
and the value used when valuing an option expiring on 1 July would be:
£40  £0.50e0.09  0.167  £0.50e0.09  0.417  £40  £0.493  £0.482  £39.025
It has been assumed that dividends are received on the ex-dividend dates (i.e.after 0.167 of a year
and after 0.417 of a year) whereas the dividends would actually be received on a later date.The
discounting should be based on the later date. The stock price adjustments, and Black’s
approximation,are used when the ex-dividend date falls before the expiry date but the discounting
is from the date of receipt of the dividend.
EUROPEAN-STYLE CALL OPTIONS ON STOCK INDICES
Stock index portfolios can usually be treated as producing a continuous income stream, since the
various component stocks would be paying dividends at different times.The adjustment that
corresponds to subtracting the present value of expected dividends involves discounting the spot
stock index by the expected rate of dividend yield. One way of looking at this is in terms of the
potential reinvestment of dividends allowing a discounted amount in the present to correspond to
the full amount at expiry,in much the same way as the future strike price is discounted to a present
value.In the case of stocks with discrete dividend payments,the adjusted stock price is used in all
three equations, including the equations for d1 and d2. In the case of stock index options, the
corresponding amendment to the equations for d1and d2takes the form of subtracting the expected
rate of dividend yield from the risk-free interest rate (i.e.from the discount rate applicable to the
strike price).The equations, for valuing a European-style call option on a stock index, are thus:

PRICING AMERICAN-STYLE OPTIONS
As for the valuation of American-style stock index options,the Black-Scholes model for European-
style stock index call options is frequently used to value American-style stock index call options
on the grounds that early exercise is unlikely.If an American-style option is unlikely to be exercised
prior to expiry, then it may be a reasonable approximation to treat it as if it were European-style.
(It is necessary to be wary of assuming that early exercise is unlikely in the case of put options.An
American-style put option may be exercised prior to expiry if the time value is exceeded by the
prospective interest returns,net of foregone dividend yield,on the funds receivable upon exercise.)
VALUING OPTIONS ON BONDS
There are particular problems that arise in relation to the use of the Black-Scholes model to value
options on bonds, to the extent that the Black-Scholes model may be inapplicable to the pricing
of such options.This is because bonds may seriously violate some of the assumptions underlying
the Black-Scholes model.
First,the Black-Scholes model assumes that the price of the underlying asset follows a diffusion
process (Brownian motion or Wiener process), which is a random walk process in which each
period’s price change is independent of the price changes of previous periods.The result is that
the variance of possible prices increases over time.This generates a lognormal distribution of
possible future prices with a standard deviation that increases over time (and is a function of the
square root of time). Since the distribution is lognormal rather than normal, the possibility of
negative values is allowed for.
Bonds usually have maturity dates on which their nominal, or par, values will be repaid. Since
the bond will be valued at par on its maturity date, its price will tend towards the par value as
maturity is approached.This is sometimes known as the pull to par. It implies that as maturity is
approached the range,or variance,of possible bond prices decreases.This is in direct contradiction
STOCK OPTIONS
702

to the diffusion process assumed by the Black-Scholes model.However,if the bond has a very long
period to maturity, the pull to par may not be too great a problem.
The diffusion process could also lead to bond prices so high that the redemption yields become
negative (the prospective capital loss as the bond price is pulled to par exceeds the coupon yield
on the bond). Since interest rates (redemption yields) cannot be negative, the diffusion model
could generate an impossible situation.
Second,the Black-Scholes model assumes constant short-term interest rates (for the period to
the expiry date of the option).Variations in bond prices arise from changes in long-term interest
rates.Use of the Black-Scholes model for pricing bond options requires the assumption that short-
term interest rates are constant,while long-term rates can vary.This is a difﬁcult assumption to justify
in the light of evidence that short-term interest rates tend to be more volatile than long-term rates.
Third,the Black-Scholes model assumes constant price volatility of the underlying asset for the
period to the expiry date of the option. Quite apart from the evidence that volatility is itself
volatile,bond price volatility is based on duration,which changes with the passage of time and with
interest rate variations.
PUT-CALL PARITY AND THE PRICING OF PUT OPTIONS
Once the fair price of a call option has been estimated by an option pricing model, the fair price
of the corresponding put option can be estimated by means of a put-call parity relationship.The
basic put-call parity equation can be expressed as:
C  P  K/(1  r)t  S [equivalently C  P  S  K/(1  r)t ]
where C is the fair price of the call option, P is the fair price of the put option, K is the strike
price of the options, r is the annualised interest rate, and t is the period to expiry in years. (The
put-call parity equation is based on equality between the price of the stock, S, and the price of a
synthetically created stock-equivalent,C  P  K/(1  r)t.By means of buying a call option and
writing a put option, the purchase of the stock at the strike price is guaranteed. Depositing K/(1
 r)t provides the cash needed to buy the stock at the strike price.The resulting construction is
equivalent to buying the stock.) So the equation for the fair price of a put option is:
P  K/(1  r)t  S  C
The formulation C  P  S  K/(1  r)t is based on there being no dividend yield from the
stock.If dividends were payable on a continuous basis,the put-call parity condition would become:
C  P  S/(1  )t  K/(1  r)t
where  is the annualised expected rate of dividend yield.(This can be understood in terms of
the stock price having a present value based on discounting at the expected rate of dividend yield.)
For individual stocks the assumption of a continuous dividend yield is unrealistic. However, it
is not too unrealistic for stock index portfolios that contain a large number of stocks paying
dividends at different points in time. So the put-call parity formulation of C  P  S/(1  )t
VARIATIONS ON THE BASIC BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL
703

 K/(1  r)t is a reasonably good approximation for stock index options.The equation for the
fair price of a stock index put option is thus:
P  K/(1  r)t  S/(1  )t  C
In the cases of individual stocks that pay dividends at discrete intervals (typically every six
months) a different approach is required.This involves subtracting the present values of expected
future dividends (those dividends relating to ex-dividend dates prior to the option expiry date)
from the stock price.The reasoning is that part of the initial cost of the share can be met by
borrowing on the basis of future dividend receipts (which would subsequently be used to repay
the debt). If D represents the present value of expected future dividends, then put-call parity for
an individual stock becomes:
C  P  S  D  K/(1  r)t
The fair price of a put option is estimated by the equation:
P  K/(1  r)t  S  C  D

Since the options are at-the-money, and the expected rate of dividend yield equals the
risk-free interest rate, the fair price of the put option is equal to the fair price of the call
option.

Incidentally, the put-call parity equation can be used to demonstrate the equivalence of a
shareholding plus a put option, on the one hand, to a call option plus a risk-free investment, on
the other hand. For example the basic put-call parity equation:
C  P  K/(1  r)t  S
can be rewritten as:
S  P  C  K/(1  r)t
The shareholding, S, plus the put option, P, equals the call option, C, plus the risk-free
investment, K/(1 r)t.
Implied Stock Prices, Observed Stock Prices, and Stock Price Bubbles
Expressions such as
C  P  K/(1  r)t
and C  P  D  K/(1  r)t
provide implied (synthetic) stock prices.Put-call parity suggests that those implied stock prices
should equal observed stock prices.The chapters in Part 7 dealing with the efficient market
STOCK OPTIONS

hypothesis indicated situations in which apparently irrational trading could move stock prices
away from their fundamental values (see especially Chapters 23 and 27 on weak form efﬁciency
and on stock market bubbles and crashes, respectively). If there were rational traders who
were aware of the mispricing, and prepared to profit from it, those traders might buy put
options in the event of stocks being overpriced and call options if they were underpriced. If
rational traders behaved in such a way, the implied stock prices might differ from observed stock
prices. Overpricing of stocks would be accompanied by lower implied prices, and underpricing
by higher synthetic prices. Battalio and Schultz (2006) investigated stock prices implied by
option prices during the technology stock bubble of the late 1990s and found no evidence of a high
demand for put options as would be indicated by relatively high put option prices and relatively
low implied stock prices.There appeared to be no evidence that rational investors were offsetting
the apparently irrational behaviour of the market (see Chapter 24 on noise traders and behavioural
ﬁnance).
RELIABILITY OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL
It must always be remembered that the fair option prices produced by Black-Scholes models,
together with the put-call parity relationship,are merely estimates of what the option prices should
be.The reliability of the estimates depends upon whether:
■The Black-Scholes model is the appropriate model.
■The expectation of volatility is accurate.
■The expectation of dividend yield is accurate.
■Arbitrage maintains put-call parity.
■The assumptions made by the Black-Scholes model hold (the assumptions include constancy
of interest rates, constancy of expected volatility, the absence of early exercise, a lognormal
distribution of share prices, and the absence of share price jumps).
Implied Volatility
Implied volatility refers to the market expectations of share price volatility implied by observed
option prices. Implied volatility is ascertained by reversing option pricing models. Instead
of calculating the theoretical option price using the stock price, strike price, expected volatility,
time to expiry, interest rate, and expected dividend yield, the observed option price becomes
an input and the expected volatility the output.The method is to find the level of expected
volatility that is consistent with an observed option price.The objective becomes one of ﬁnding
the value of expected volatility that generates a theoretical option price equal to the observed
option price.
Unfortunately, the Black-Scholes model cannot be rearranged to provide an analytical
solution for expected share price volatility. Instead, a numerical method must be employed.
This involves an iterative search process. This can be likened to a trial-and-error process in
which various values of expected volatility are put into the model and the resulting theoretical
option values are compared with the observed option price. Progressively the theoretical
option price gets closer to the actual price. Eventually the theoretical price equals the
VARIATIONS ON THE BASIC BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL
707

observed option price, and the inputted value of expected volatility at that stage is the implied
volatility.
For example it may be that the observed option price is 5.The ﬁrst step might be to input an
expected share price volatility value of 20% p.a. into the Black-Scholes model. If this gives a
theoretical option price of less than 5, then a higher expected volatility is tried. It may be
that a volatility of 25% produces a theoretical option price of 5.5.This tells us that the implied
volatility lies between 20% and 25% p.a.The next step may be to take an intermediate value such
as 22.5%. If this produces a fair option price less than 5, we then know that volatility lies between
22.5% and 25% p.a.Again,an intermediate value is taken (e.g.23.75%) and the theoretical option
price is calculated. If the fair option price is above 5, it follows that volatility lies between 22.5%
and 23.75% p.a.This iterative process progressively narrows down the range of possible values of
expected volatility and can be continued until implied volatility is estimated to the desired degree
of accuracy.
A difﬁculty with the implied volatility approach is that different option series (different strike
prices) may provide different implied volatilities,despite relating to the same share and having the
same expiry date.The question arises as to which value of implied volatility to choose.
Volatility Smiles and Volatility Smirks
The variation of implied volatilities across different option series (strike prices) is not random.
In particular, there is a relationship between implied volatility and the closeness of the option
series to being at-the-money. At-the-money options tend to exhibit relatively low implied
volatilities, whereas in-the-money and out-of-the-money options are prone to exhibit relatively
high implied volatilities.This is known as the smile effect. However market expectations of share
price volatility must be the same in all cases, since all of the option series relate to the same share
and the same expiry date.
The smile effect may arise from a systematic tendency of the Black-Scholes option pricing
model to misprice options. It seems to overprice at-the-money options and interprets the lower
observed prices as indicative of low expected volatility. Conversely, it appears to underprice
in-the-money and out-of-the-money options, and interprets the higher observed prices as being
the result of high expected volatility.
The question arises as to why the Black-Scholes model may systematically misprice options.
One explanation arises from the existence of leptokurtosis,better known as fat tails.Probabilities
of extreme values are often greater than supposed by normal distributions, and probabilities of
values near to the mean are often lower.There is general agreement that fat tails exist, but there
is no such agreement as to why. One view is that the Black-Scholes assumption of a normal
distribution is wrong and that fat-tailed distributions are more appropriate. In other words the
Black-Scholes assumption of (log)normal distributions is at variance with reality; actual
distributions of share prices show a greater tendency to extreme values than normal distributions.
Another explanation suggests that what is actually observed is a mixture of normal distributions
with different variances.According to this view, the observed distribution consists of a sequence
of normal distributions, each with a different variance.When combined, such distributions lead
to fat tails.The Black-Scholes model assumes constant expected volatility of share prices. If this
assumption is violated, fat-tailed distributions are observed.
STOCK OPTIONS
708

A third explanation of fat tails lies in the possibility that while prices follow a smooth diffusion
process most of the time,there is an occasional jump.In other words whereas share prices usually
change by small amounts (such a smooth share price movement is assumed by the Black-Scholes
model), there are occasional sudden and large share price movements (referred to as jumps).
These explanations suggest that at least one of the assumptions of the Black-Scholes model is
violated. In consequence, just as the estimated values of implied volatility become unreliable, the
fair option prices estimated by the Black-Scholes model may be unreliable.
Bollen and Whaley (2004) and Chan et al. (2004) found that out-of-the-money stock index
put options appeared to be relatively expensive, and hence their prices reﬂected high levels of
implied volatility. It was suggested that the effect arose as a result of net buying pressure from
hedging by institutional investors. Foresi and Wu (2005) established the pervasive nature of a
‘smirk’pattern wherein the smile effect is asymmetric.Their study indicated that implied volatility
was higher for low strike price stock index put options than for high strike price options whose
strike prices were of similar distance from the spot price.Their explanation was based on the idea
of a ‘crash-o-phobia’ whereby investors buy deep out-of-the-money (very low strike price) stock
index put options as insurance against stock market crashes.The high demand for such options raises
their prices and hence their implied volatilities.The elevated prices are also supported by low
supply of such options since option writers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to hedge the risk of a market crash.The
observation of the smirk is a useful reminder that option prices are determined by the forces of
demand and supply. Option pricing models inform buyers and sellers, but do not establish prices
in the market.
One of the implications of prospect theory is that people overestimate extremely low
probabilities (see Chapters 2 and 24 on the psychology of investment decisions and on noise trading
and behavioural ﬁnance,respectively).Given the choice between £1 and a 0.1% chance of £1,000
most people choose the 0.1% chance of £1,000.This helps to explain why people buy lottery
tickets and why demand for out-of-the-money call options, and hence their prices, may be high.
Conversely given the choice between paying £1 and a 0.1% chance of losing £1,000 most people
will pay the £1.This explains why people will buy insurance against long-shot possibilities and why
demand for out-of-the-money put options, and hence their prices, may be high.
CONCLUSION
The basic Black-Scholes option pricing model provides estimates of fair prices for European-style
call options on non-dividend paying stocks. However fair option prices are required for other
instruments such as dividend paying stocks, stock indices, currencies, and futures. Fair option
prices are also required for American-style options, and for put options.
The basic Black-Scholes model can be amended to produce a number of variations.Those
variations can be used to estimate fair prices for options on a range of instruments,and to estimate
the prices of American-style options. By adding the put-call parity condition, it is possible to
estimate put option prices as well as call option prices.
VARIATIONS ON THE BASIC BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL
709

The Black-Scholes model, despite the possibility of amendment, may not be suitable for a
number of valuation purposes. In particular, it may be unsuitable for estimating fair prices for
options on bonds and for estimating the fair prices of many exotic options. Other option pricing
models, such as binomial models, often need to be used (see Chapter 38 on the binomial option
pricing model).

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The basic binomial model.
2. The role of the equivalent portfolio.
3. Simple applications of the binomial model.
4. How the binomial model avoids assumptions needed by the Black-Scholes model.
5. Real options and their signiﬁcance.
The ﬁrst major advance in option pricing was made by Black and Scholes (1973).Arguably the next
was made by Cox et al. (1979), and takes the form of the binomial model. Black-Scholes models
are, strictly speaking, applicable only to options that cannot be exercised before expiry (i.e.
European-style options).Binomial models can deal with the possibility of early exercise,and hence
can be used for the valuation of American-style options.Another advantage of binomial models,
relative to Black-Scholes models,is that they are capable of allowing for variations in interest rates
and volatility over time.
A major disadvantage of the binomial model is that it does not permit an analytical solution and
must be solved numerically.This means that there is no formula that can be programmed into a
computer or calculator; instead a computer must be programmed to ascertain the solution by an
iterative process.This can take a considerable amount of computer time.
Binomial models use portfolios (consisting of shares and debt) that replicate the behaviour of
options; such portfolios being referred to as equivalent portfolios.This is based on there being a
portfolio of shares and debt that will behave in the same way as the option. Correspondingly the
fair price of the option equals the value of the portfolio.
Although the exposition of the binomial model in this chapter will treat the time to expiry of
an option as being one period, or divided into two periods, practical application of the binomial
model requires the time to expiry to be divided into a much larger number of periods.Whereas
some users consider as few as 15 periods to be sufﬁcient,others regard 30 as the minimum number
of periods.
711

THE ONE-PERIOD BINOMIAL MODEL
The basic principles of option pricing can be indicated by means of a simple binomial model.
Although this simple form of the model is highly unrealistic, it nevertheless conveys the essence
of the principles underlying more complex (and more realistic) option pricing models.
Suppose that a share,which is currently priced at 100p,can have one of two values one year hence.
These two values are 150p and 50p. Further suppose that a call option has a strike price of 100p
and an expiry date one year hence. Figure 38.1 shows binomial trees for the share and the option.
At the end of the year the share will be worth either 150p or 50p.The call option with a strike
price of 100p will be worth either 50p (if the share price rises to 150p) or 0 (if the share price falls
to 50p). Binomial option pricing looks for a share-based portfolio that has the same prospective
pay-offs as the option.This share-based portfolio is referred to as the equivalent portfolio.
Suppose that it is possible to buy fractions of a share and that money can be borrowed at zero
interest.The purchase of half a share for 50p, which is ﬁnanced partly by borrowing 25p, will
replicate the call option.The portfolio of 0.5 of a share plus a debt of 25p is equivalent to the call
option in terms of prospective outcomes.
If the share price rises to 150p, the value of the portfolio will be 50p.This arises from a
shareholding worth 75p and a debt of 25p.The value of the equivalent portfolio is therefore equal
to the value of the option.
If the share price falls to 50p,the value of the portfolio will be 0.This is because the shareholding
is worth 25p, and the debt is also 25p.Again the value of the portfolio is equal to the value of the
call option.
Since the call option and the equivalent portfolio have identical pay-offs, they should have the
same price.The construction of the portfolio involves a net cash outﬂow of 25p (50p for half a share
minus 25p borrowed).It follows that the cash outﬂow for acquiring the option should also be 25p.
In other words, the price of the option should be 25p.
MULTI-PERIOD MODELS
Figure 38.2 illustrates two-period binomial trees.The value at the end of a period is referred to
as a node. Starting with just one node, the number of nodes increases with the passage of each
period.The distance between the highest and lowest nodes also increases over time.The initial share
price is S. In each period the share price may rise by U or fall by D.

At each node in a binomial tree for an option there is an option price.There will be two option
prices in the next period arising from each node:one for the up-state and one for the down-state.
At the end of the ﬁnal period, the option would have no time value. Its price would equal its
intrinsic value, which is the higher of zero or the share price minus the option strike price.
At each node in a binomial tree for an option (prior to expiry) it is possible to construct a
portfolio that will behave in the same way as the option and exhibit the same end-of-period values.
The portfolios for calls consist of shareholdings together with debt (i.e. each portfolio would be
a margined shareholding, a shareholding partially ﬁnanced by borrowing).The call option price
should equal the value of the portfolio.
The quantities of shares and debt are ascertained by solving simultaneous equations. The
number of shares corresponds to the option delta.The equivalent portfolio will be different at each
node.The change in the portfolio from one node to the next (from one period to the next) will
be self-ﬁnancing.This self-ﬁnancing condition means that the cash ﬂows arising from the change
in the quantity of stock are precisely matched by the change in the size of the debt.So as time passes
there is no cash inflow to or outflow from the equivalent portfolio, and the proceeds from
one period’s portfolio will ﬁnance the next period’s portfolio (both in the up-state and in the
down-state).
At each node the theoretical call option price (which equals the value of the equivalent portfolio)
is compared with the intrinsic value of the option. If the intrinsic value is the higher, it is assumed
that the option would be exercised at that time and the intrinsic value (value upon exercise) is used
as the option price at that node (instead of the value of the portfolio).In this way the binomial model
can deal with the possibility of early exercise (and hence American-style options).
The call option price should equal the value of the equivalent portfolio otherwise there would
be arbitrage opportunities. If their values differed, the cheaper would be bought and the more
expensive sold, and this pursuit of arbitrage proﬁts would tend to restore the equality of the two
values.
The use of the binomial model is best illustrated by worked examples, and these follow.These
illustrations are limited to two periods, but in reality the period to expiry should be divided into
many more periods (normally at least 15).The division of a time period,such as a year,into a very
large number of periods (and hence the use of short periods) generates greater accuracy but at the
cost of more computer time.
Although the following illustrations use constant interest rates and volatility, it is possible to
vary these from period to period (an advantage of the binomial model relative to the Black-Scholes
model).

ILLUSTRATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE ONE-PERIOD MODEL
The share price is 100p and the expected share price volatility is 0.2 (i.e. 20% p.a.) The risk-free
interest rate is 6% p.a. Using a one-period binomial, estimate the fair price of a one-month call
option with a strike price of (a) 100p and (b) 105p. (Assume that D  1/U.)
Answer
If the annual volatility is 0.2,the monthly volatility is 0.2√1/12 (volatility equals annual volatility
multiplied by the square root of time to expiry in years).So U would be e0.2√(1/12)  1.0594 and
D would be 0.9439 (1/U).At the end of the month the share price would be 105.94p or 94.39p.
(a) The value of a 100p strike price call option at the end of the month would be 5.94p in the
event of a share price rise and 0p in the event of a share price fall.These numbers are based
on the higher of (S  K) and 0. In the case of the up-state, this amounts to 105.94p  100p
 5.94p. In the case of the down-state, 0 exceeds 94.39p  100p.
The equivalent portfolio (margined shareholding) should consist of a long position in the share
of , and a cash borrowing with an end-of-month value of X, such that:
105.94  X  5.94
and
94.39  X  0
In other words the values of  and X should be such that the equivalent portfolio has the same
pay-offs as the call option in the events of a rise and fall in the share price.It is possible to solve for
 and X as follows:
105.94  X  5.94
minus
(94.39  X  0)
gives
11.55  5.94
so
  5.94/11.55  0.514
To solve for X:

54.483  X  5.94
54.483  5.94  X
X  48.543
So a portfolio equivalent to a call option comprises 0.514 shares and a borrowing equal to the
present value of 48.543p.The present cost of such a portfolio would be:
(0.514  100p)  (48.543/1.005)  3.099
(1.005 is based on 6% p.a. for 1/12 year.)
So the fair price of the call option would be 3.10p (to two decimal places).

(b) The value of a 105p strike call option at the end of the month would be 0.94p (105.94p 
105p) in the event of a share price rise and 0p in the event of a share price fall.The equivalent
portfolio (equivalent to the call option) should have values of  and X such that:
105.94  X  0.94
and
94.39  X  0
Solve for 
105.94  X  0.94

8.622  X  0.94
8.622  0.94  X
X  7.682
The present cost of the equivalent portfolio would be (0.081  100)  (7.682/1.005) 
0.456p. So the fair price of the call option is 0.46p (to two decimal places).
ILLUSTRATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE TWO-PERIOD MODEL
The current share price is 100p and share price volatility is expected to be 0.2 (20% p.a.).The
risk-free interest rate is 6% p.a.Using a two-period binomial,estimate the fair price of a two-month
call option with a strike price of 100p. (Assume that D1/U.)
Answer
If the annual volatility is 0.2, the monthly volatility is 0.2√(1/12). So U would be e0.2√(1/12) 
1.0594 and D would be 0.9439. The possible stock prices after one and two months are
shown by the lattice of Figure 38.3.The corresponding call option prices would be as shown by
Figure 38.4.
To ascertain the one-month up-state call option price it is necessary to solve for  and X where:

If the annual volatility is 0.2, the monthly volatility is 0.2√(1/12). So U would be e0.2√(1/12) 
1.0594 and D would be 0.9439.The lattice of Figure 38.7 shows the possible stock prices after 1
and 2 months.The corresponding call option prices would be as shown by Figure 38.8.
The lattice of Figure 38.7 reﬂects the expectation that the share price will fall, by the value
of the expected dividend,when the dividend is paid.More speciﬁcally the share price is expected
to fall when the share changes from being cum-dividend (the share price includes the dividend since
a buyer would receive the dividend) to being ex-dividend (the share price no longer includes the
dividend since a buyer would not receive the dividend).It is being assumed that this change occurs
when the dividend is paid (in practice it normally occurs before the dividend payment date).

So the equivalent portfolio after 1 month would consist of one share and a debt equal to the
present value of 100p.When the share goes ex-dividend, the share price falls to 105.94p. At a
share price of 105.94p the portfolio would cost:
105.94  (100/1.005)  6.44p (to two decimal places).
However, if the option were exercised cum-dividend, the intrinsic value realised would
be 106.94p  100p  6.94p. So it would be rational to exercise the option to realise the
intrinsic value of 6.94p in preference to holding the option and experiencing an ex-dividend
value of 6.44p.
It can be seen that the binomial model allows for the possibility of early exercise (exercise
before the expiry date of the option), and hence can be used to value American-style options. If
exercise were rational it would occur immediately before the share goes ex-dividend.When the
share goes ex-dividend its price falls by the amount of the expected dividend,and the intrinsic value
of the call option falls by the same amount. Exercise avoids this loss of intrinsic value, but entails
the loss of time value. If the time value remaining after the share goes ex-dividend is less than the
intrinsic value lost,there would be a net gain from exercising and avoiding the loss of intrinsic value.

THE BINOMIAL MODEL AND THE ASSUMPTIONS
OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL
The binomial option pricing model postulates that in any period of time the price of the underlying
asset can either rise or fall (to an extent that reﬂects the price volatility of the asset).Over a number
of periods this leads to a set of possible ﬁnal prices.Corresponding to this set of ﬁnal prices of the
asset is a set of (at expiry) option prices.By working backwards from these potential future option
prices it is possible to generate a (theoretical or fair) present option price based on a portfolio of
shares and debt that gives the same outcomes as the option.
The binomial model avoids some of the restrictive assumptions of the Black-Scholes model.In
particular it avoids the assumption that early exercise is impossible.The illustration of the pricing
of an American-style option demonstrated that the binomial model can allow for early exercise,
and hence can be used for pricing American-style options.
The binomial model also avoids the assumptions that the short-term interest rate is constant
during the life of the option,and that volatility is constant during the life of the option.Within the
binomial model it is possible to have a different interest rate and different volatility for each period.
If the time to expiry of the option is divided into a large number of periods,considerable variation
in interest rates and volatility can be allowed for.The binomial model does not need the assumption
that the price of the asset follows a diffusion process that results in a lognormal distribution of
possible values.
The absence of such restrictive assumptions can render the binomial model more attractive than
the Black-Scholes model for the valuation of certain types of option, such as options on bonds.
Unfortunately the iterative process required for the use of the binomial model can involve
considerable computer time.Consequently option market participants who want option valuations
quickly, or without resort to powerful computers, tend to prefer to use Black-Scholes models.

REAL OPTIONS AND COMPANY VALUATION
Real options assign a value to flexibility in production. For example an electricity generating
company may invest in a power plant that is left idle during some periods but brought into
production in other periods when electricity demand, and the price of electricity, is high.A gold
mining company may have a mine that is not currently being used, but could be brought into
production if gold prices rise above a particular level.To value such production facilities purely in
terms of the net present value of their expected output would be to miss the beneﬁt of ﬂexibility.
The ﬂexibility in production levels constitutes real options. Flexibility has a value, which can be
measured as the price of a real option.The ﬂexibility can enhance the proﬁtability of the company,
and thereby expected earnings and dividends. So expectations of dividends and earnings should
take account of real options. Recognition of real options would increase the estimated value of a
company and the fair price of its shares. Company valuation and hence share valuation, which
ignores real options (alternatively known as flexibility options), is likely to produce an
underestimate of fundamental value.
The binomial model can be used to illustrate the valuation of real options. Consider a highly
simpliﬁed example of an oil company with a two-year lease on an unused oil ﬁeld capable of
producing 10 million barrels of oil in a year.The cost of production of the oil is $50 per barrel (oil
is conventionally priced in US dollars).The price of oil futures,with two-year maturity,is $50 per
barrel.The expectation is that revenues would do no more than cover production costs.When the
real option is ignored,the present value of the oil ﬁeld lease is deemed to be zero.Valuation of the
lease on the basis of the difference between expected revenues and costs ignores uncertainty and
erroneously treats zero proﬁt as certain.
Suppose that the price of one-year oil futures, one year hence, is expected to be either $60 or
$40 per barrel.In the $60 case production could be carried out,during the second year,at a proﬁt
of ($60  $50)  10 million  $100 million.In the $40 case there would be no production,and
hence zero proﬁt. In terms of a one-period binomial, the up-state is $100 million and the down-
state is 0.
It is possible to create an equivalent portfolio,comprising oil futures and risk-free assets (such
as bank deposits or Treasury bills),with the same up-state and down-state pay-offs as the oil ﬁeld.
The composition of the equivalent portfolio can be found by solving the following simultaneous
equations (which further simplify by ignoring discount rates):
(F  $10)  RFI  $100,000,000
(1)
(F  $10)  RFI  0
(2)
where F is the quantity of oil covered by futures contracts, and RFI is the investment in risk-
free assets.
Rewriting equation 2 as:
F  RFI/$10  RFI/$10
and substituting into equation 1 gives:
([RFI/$10]  $10)  RFI  $100,000,000

723

RFI  RFI  $100,000,000
RFI  $50,000,000
$50 million is invested in risk-free assets.Substituting this value into equation 1 allows F to be
ascertained.
(F  $10)  $50,000,000  $100,000,000
F  $10  $50,000,000
F  5,000,000
The purchase of oil futures relates to 5 million barrels. Checking this value using equation 2
gives:
(5,000,000   $10)  $50,000,000  0
The value of the real option should equal the value of the equivalent portfolio. Since
futures have a purchase price of zero, the cost of the equivalent portfolio equals the investment
in risk-free assets. The value of the equivalent portfolio, and hence of the real option, is
$50,000,000.
The lease on the oil ﬁeld is worth $50,000,000 rather than the value of zero obtained by simply
comparing expected revenues with costs of production.The value of the oil company includes the
value of real options.Estimates of future earnings and dividends that ignore the ﬂexibility provided
by real options will be underestimates.(The comparison of expected revenues and costs indicates
a certain proﬁt of zero whereas consideration of the real option indicates that the proﬁt would be
either $100 million or zero.)
Chance and Peterson (2002) suggest that binomial option pricing is often more appropriate
than Black-Scholes models because there may be multiple interacting options; a situation for
which Black-Scholes models are inadequate.Also, the assumptions of Black-Scholes models are
likely to be violated. The possible existence of multiple interacting options arises from the
potential presence of various options relating to the same situation.For example options to expand,
to contract, to abandon, and to defer may all be present simultaneously.
The data on which the pricing of ﬁnancial options is based comes from observable prices since
the shares or bonds (or other underlying instruments) are traded.The values to be used in the
valuation of real options usually relate to assets that are not traded, and hence do not have
observable prices. In the case of intellectual capital, such as that arising from research and
development expenditure, measurement may be particularly difﬁcult.
These considerations suggest that estimating the prices of real options is likely to be more
difﬁcult than estimating the prices of ﬁnancial options.A survey of stock analysts by Glaum and
Friedrich (2006) indicated that such analysts paid very little attention to real options.

CONCLUSION
The Black-Scholes option pricing model,and its variants,provides a convenient means of estimating
the fair prices of options.The values of a number of variables are input into the formula and the
fair option price is the output. However its applicability is limited.
There are a number of other approaches to estimating the fair prices of options.One approach
is to use a binomial model. Binomial models are capable of substantial variation, and have wide
applicability. However they are less convenient to use since it is not a matter of simply inputting
values of variables into an equation;an iterative process is required.Since they are not dependent
on the restrictive assumptions of the Black-Scholes model,such as the assumption of a lognormal
distribution of returns, they are more generally applicable and their results can be used with a
greater degree of conﬁdence.
The ﬂexibility of binomial models means that their use is not limited to ﬁnancial options. In
particular they can be used to estimate the fair values of real options. Real options can be useful
for estimating the fair values of shares.In regards to the estimation of fair stock prices real options
are particularly useful when other methods,such as dividend discount models,cannot be used (for
example because of an absence of dividends).

Using Currency Derivatives


Chapter 39
Currency forwards, futures,
swaps, and options
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. International money market investments.
2. Currency forwards and currency futures.
3. The role of arbitrage in the determination of forward and futures prices.
4. Hedging with currency futures.
5. Currency swaps.
6. Currency options as hedging instruments.
7. Zero-cost options.
8. Delta hedging with options.
INTERNATIONAL MONEY MARKET INVESTMENTS
When money is invested in foreign countries there are two elements to the return.There is
the return in foreign currency terms, and the return from exchange rate movements (changes
in the price of foreign currency in terms of the home currency).This might be expressed by
equation 1.
(1  rD)  (1  rF)(E1/E0)
(1)
where rD is the return in the investor’s home (domestic) currency,rF is the return in the foreign
currency, E1 is the currency price (exchange rate) at the end of the investment period, and E0 is
the currency price when the investment is made.The return in terms of the investor’s own currency
equals the foreign investment return (in foreign currency) multiplied by the return from the
change in currency price (exchange rate movement).
It is possible to predetermine the currency price to be received at the end of the investment
period by using currency forwards or futures.According to the principle of interest rate parity the
change in the price of foreign currency, guaranteed by forwards or futures, exactly offsets the
729

difference between the interest rates on the two currencies. The implication is that, when
considering short-term risk-free investments such as bank deposits or Treasury bills, there is no
difference in return between domestic and foreign investments when the currency price is
guaranteed by forwards or futures.This arises from the way in which forward and futures prices
are determined.
CURRENCY FORWARDS AND CURRENCY FUTURES
A forward contract removes exchange rate risk by guaranteeing a future exchange rate.The parties
to the contract agree to exchange, on a future date, currencies at an exchange rate agreed in the
present.Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements between two parties (e.g.a bank and
its client) for the exchange of two currencies on a future date at an exchange rate agreed in the
present (the forward exchange rate).
A currency futures contract provides a notional commitment to buy or sell,on a speciﬁc future
date (the maturity date of the futures contract), a standard amount of a particular currency at a
price that is known at the time of entering the contract. Futures are tradable.A futures contract
can be closed out (i.e.cancelled) by buying or selling an opposite contract.If a futures contract is
bought,that contract can be closed out by means of selling a contract with the same maturity date.
The two contracts cancel each other out.
It is desirable that the markets in futures contracts are liquid so as to ensure easy trading
conditions (a liquid market is one in which there is a large volume of trading). Financial futures
contracts are highly standardised so as to enhance the quantities of each contract and thereby
generate market liquidity.The contracts traded on financial futures exchanges have a limited
number of maturity dates each year.The contract sizes are also standard; for example for sterling
currency contracts they are £62,500 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This
standardisation limits the number of different contracts available and correspondingly increases
the volume traded in each contract.
Comparing Currency Forwards and Currency Futures
Futures and forwards are similar instruments whose prices tend to be very close.There are,
nonetheless, important differences. Forwards are actual commitments to future transactions,
whereas futures are notional commitments. Forward contracts are used to effect the end
transaction; the parties to the forward contract are the same as the parties to the subsequent
exchange of currencies. Futures rarely go to the point of delivery of the currency and, if they do,
the counterparties involved are not the same as the counterparties to the original futures deal.
Futures are ﬁnancial instruments that are independent of the underlying currency, albeit with
prices that normally correlate with those of the underlying currency.Futures positions are normally
closed out by taking an opposite futures position (e.g. someone who initially sells closes out the
short position by buying an equal number of contracts of the same maturity as those sold). Most
futures are closed out before they mature, and hence futures commitments are often referred to
as ‘notional’ commitments to reﬂect the absence of actual exchanges of currencies.
Second, forwards are over-the-counter (OTC) instruments whereas futures are exchange-
traded. OTC products take the form of an agreement between two parties (e.g. the client and a
INTERNATIONAL INVESTING: CURRENCY DERIVATIVES
730

bank).This agreement is not visible to other parties - the market is not transparent.This lack of
transparency means that it is not possible to know the prices at which others are transacting.
Different clients may obtain different prices from the banks. Futures markets are transparent.
Everyone can see the prices available.The most transparent markets are the face-to-face markets
in which all transactors occupy the same trading area (known as a pit). Everyone can see what
quantities are being traded and at what prices. Everyone can obtain the same prices: there is no
discrimination between different transactors.
Third,forwards can be tailor-made to the speciﬁc requirements of a client.The client can specify
dates and amounts to be transacted.Futures are highly standardised.Each futures contract relates
to a standard quantity of a currency. Furthermore, only a limited number of maturity dates are
available at any time.A high degree of standardisation is necessary for market liquidity, that is for
ensuring that the volumes traded are sufficiently high for buyers and sellers to experience no
difﬁculty in conducting their desired transactions. If the standardisation were less, for example
through a greater number of maturity dates or a variety of contract sizes,the number of different
contracts would be greater and each variety of contract might experience few and infrequent
trades.Such inadequate liquidity could reduce the ability of users,such as hedgers,to establish and
subsequently close out futures positions.
Fourth, the proﬁt or loss from a forward contract is realised, in its entirety, when the contract
matures. Proﬁts and losses on a futures contract are realised on a daily basis in response to daily
price movements (via a process known as marking to market).
In the case of currencies, successful forward and futures markets coexist.This coexistence is
most marked in North America. Elsewhere, particularly in Europe, forward markets are
predominant.A balanced coexistence might in time become the norm throughout the world since
forwards and futures have their relative merits.Futures have a considerable advantage in that they
allow ﬂexibility as to the date of closing out (futures can be closed out on any trading day up to
maturity), whereas forwards tend to involve a commitment to an exchange of currencies on a
speciﬁc date. If there is doubt as to the timing of the cash ﬂow being hedged, futures may be the
more attractive hedging instrument.
On the other hand, futures can be more complex to administer because of the daily cash ﬂows
arising from marking to market.Typically a futures margin account would be held, possibly with
a futures broker.Daily cash ﬂows would move into and out of the account.The hedger would only
be involved in making payments (or receiving money) if the balance in the margin account were
to fall below (or exceed) a predetermined limit.Margin accounts do have the disadvantage of tying
up liquidity.
When hedging with futures, the cash ﬂows from the futures arise before the cash ﬂows from
the transaction being hedged.Losses may precede proﬁts and there could be difﬁculty in ﬁnancing
those losses.There is a risk that losses from daily marking to market accumulate to a problematic
extent and,although there would be offsetting future proﬁts from the underlying transaction (the
transaction being hedged),signiﬁcant liquidity problems could arise prior to the date on which the
cash ﬂow from the underlying transaction takes place (Metalgesellschaft encountered this type of
problem when using commodity derivatives).
Currency forwards and futures involve two simultaneous prices:the price of each currency in
terms of the other. In the case of futures contracts possible confusion from this is reduced since
the major contracts price currencies in US dollars,use US dollars for the daily marking to market
CURRENCY FORWARDS, FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS
731

cash ﬂows, and stipulate contract sizes in amounts of the foreign (non-US dollar) currency, e.g.
£62,500 is the size of the pound sterling futures contract.
PRICING CURRENCY FORWARDS AND FUTURES
To a large extent the determination of forward prices and of futures prices is similar in that they
both reﬂect interest rate parity. Forward prices and futures prices should be very close.The
mechanics of price determination may differ between the two markets in that currency forward
prices are likely to be based on the costs of hedging the provision of forward contracts whereas
futures prices are likely to be based on arbitrage.
Interest Rate Parity
The current price of a currency is referred to as the spot price. If the forward price of a currency
exceeds the spot price, that currency is said to be at a premium. For example if the spot price of
sterling in terms of US dollars is £1  $1.50, while the six-month forward price is £1  $1.55,
then sterling is said to be at a premium against the dollar. Conversely, if the forward price is less
than the spot price,the currency is said to be at a discount.With a spot exchange rate of £1 $1.50,
a forward price of £1  $1.45 means that sterling is at a discount against the US dollar
(correspondingly, the dollar is at a premium against sterling).
Interest rate parity describes a relationship between spot and forward (and futures) currency
prices.One way of looking at this relationship is in terms of equality between the forward premium
or discount on the one hand and the difference between the two interest rates on the other.The
premium or discount offsets the difference in interest rates. For example if sterling yields the
higher interest rate it would trade at a discount to the US dollar.This means that the forward
(futures) price of sterling would be below the spot price so that, from the perspective of dollar-
based traders, there would be a guaranteed capital loss from holding sterling that matched the
additional interest from sterling deposits. Conversely if sterling interest rates were below US
dollar rates, sterling should trade at a premium in the forward and futures markets, that is the
forward (futures) price of sterling should be greater than the spot price so that there is a capital
gain that compensates for the lower interest returns.
The interest rate parity relationship can be described by the following equation:

where R$ is the (euro-)dollar interest rate for the period to the maturity of the forward or
futures contract, R£ is the (euro-)sterling interest rate for the same period, F is the forward or
futures price of sterling, and S is the spot price of sterling. (The preﬁx ‘euro-’ indicates that the
interest rates are eurocurrency rates,i.e.interest rates for currency outside its country of origin,
for example pounds sterling in Paris.This has nothing to do with the currency called the ‘Euro’.)
Covered Interest Arbitrage
Arbitrage plays a crucial role in the determination of the prices of futures contracts on foreign
exchange.The arbitrage is usually referred to as covered interest arbitrage.The arbitrage can be

seen as being between the futures contract on the one hand and a synthetic forward contract on
the other.The arbitrage involves buying the cheaper of the two and simultaneously selling the
more expensive.The fair futures price is the futures price that provides no opportunity for arbitrage
proﬁts.The price of the futures should equal that of the synthetic forward.
To illustrate the general principle for the case of currencies, consider futures contracts on
sterling using the US dollar as the base currency (the US dollar is normally the base currency in
foreign exchange futures contracts).The synthetic long forward involves borrowing dollars and
simultaneously buying spot sterling,which is put on deposit.There is no initial cash outlay but on
the maturity date a sum of sterling is held and a dollar debt has to be repaid. So the transactions
that occur on the maturity date are equivalent to those under a forward contract, dollars are paid
and sterling is received.
If sterling futures are overpriced relative to the synthetic,an arbitrage proﬁt can be made via a
synthetic long forward position together with a short (sold) futures position.If the price of buying
forward sterling by means of the synthetic is lower than the futures price of sterling, the dollar
receipts from selling sterling via the (overpriced) futures will exceed the dollar debt to be repaid.
The difference constitutes the arbitrage proﬁt.This arbitrage is illustrated by Figure 39.1.
Conversely,a futures price below the synthetic price offers an arbitrage proﬁt from buying the
(underpriced) futures and simultaneously taking a short position in the synthetic.
The short synthetic position is established by means of borrowing sterling and using the proceeds
to buy US dollars,which are then deposited.On the maturity date the sterling debt is repaid and the
dollar deposit matures to provide US dollars (so on the maturity date there is an outﬂow of sterling
and an inﬂow of dollars,just as in the case of a forward contract to sell sterling for US dollars).If the
futures price is below the price provided by the synthetic, it would be possible for an arbitrager to
construct the synthetic forward and use the dollar proceeds to buy sterling through the futures
contract.The amount of sterling thereby obtained would exceed the sum needed to repay the sterling
debt.The excess would be the arbitrage proﬁt.This arbitrage is illustrated by Figure 39.2.

These arbitrage processes would tend to bring the futures price into line with the synthetic price.
In the ﬁrst case,the sale of futures would tend to reduce the futures price towards the price of the
synthetic forward.Simultaneously,the purchase of spot sterling would tend to raise the spot price,
with the consequence that more dollars need to be borrowed. So the ratio of dollars to be repaid
to pounds received would rise; in other words, the forward price of sterling provided by the
synthetic would rise.The actual futures price would fall and the synthetic forward price rise.Hence
the two would move towards equality.When they are equal there would be no further arbitrage
proﬁts available (transaction costs may prevent complete equality,a point that will be returned to).
In the second case (underpriced futures and relatively overpriced synthetics), the opposite
transactions would take place and tend to restore equality between the two prices. In particular
the futures price would rise towards the price of the synthetic forward.
EXERCISE 39.1
The six-month US dollar interest rate is 5% p.a. and the six-month euro interest rate is 4% p.a.
The price of the euro is currently $0.95. If the futures (with six months to maturity) price of the
euro were $0.97, how might an arbitrage proﬁt be made?

The fair futures price is $0.9547.
If the futures price of the euro were $0.97, the futures would be overpriced. Covered interest
arbitrage would entail selling the overpriced futures.The US dollar would be borrowed,the euro
would be bought spot, euro futures would be sold, and the proceeds of the futures sale would be
used to repay the dollar debt.The proceeds of the futures sale would exceed the amount required
to repay the dollar debt.The excess is the arbitrage proﬁt.
Synthetics and the Pricing of Forward Contracts
Such arbitrage operations may also help to determine forward currency prices. However the
costs of synthetics may more directly affect forward prices. This is because banks offering
forward contracts are likely to use the costs of synthetic forwards (and hence the interest rate
parity equation) as the basis for pricing their forward contracts. They may even construct
synthetic forwards in order to generate the cash ﬂows to which the forward contracts commit
them; this would be a means of hedging risks arising from the agreement to a forward
exchange of currencies. For example a bank that provides a client with a short forward
contract on sterling (the client sells sterling for dollars) will receive sterling and pay dollars
on the maturity date of the forward contract. The bank may construct a synthetic short
forward since such a structure requires sterling, and receives dollars, on the maturity
date.
The Significance of Bid-Offer Spreads
The gross returns from arbitrage must exceed transaction costs, otherwise arbitrage would not
occur.In ascertaining the synthetic forward price,account must be taken of the fact that currency
is bought at an offer and sold at a bid price (and that the offer price is higher than the bid price).
Likewise, money is borrowed at the offer (high) interest rate and deposited at the bid (low) rate.
As a result,synthetic long and short positions have different prices.Speciﬁcally,synthetic purchases
will be at a relatively high price and synthetic sales at a lower price.The difference between the
prices will reﬂect the bid-offer spreads on currencies and interest rates (bid-offer spreads are the
differences between bid and offer prices/rates).The following exercise illustrates covered interest
arbitrage and the effects of bid-offer spreads.

A user of forward contracts can expect two different forward prices, one for forward purchases
and one for sales.These prices should reﬂect the two prices of synthetic forwards.A user of futures
will ﬁnd that there is just one futures price (or at least a very small difference between buying and
selling prices). For futures contracts the two prices implied by the synthetic forwards set upper
and lower limits to the actual futures price.Arbitrage keeps the futures price within a range of
values,the no-arbitrage band,with the two synthetic forward prices providing the upper and lower
limits to the range.Within the no-arbitrage band, the actual futures price will be determined by
the demand and supply arising from hedgers and speculators.The middle of this range of possible
futures prices is known as the fair futures price,which is the futures price that arbitrage would tend
to produce in the absence of transaction costs (transaction costs include bid-offer spreads).
HEDGING CURRENCY RISK WITH FUTURES
Hedgers using futures transfer their risks. If they buy futures, others must sell them, i.e. the
notional commitment to buy currency on a speciﬁed date in the future at a price agreed upon in
the present is matched by another user’s notional commitment to sell the currency at that date and
price.The seller of futures would be either a hedger wanting to avoid the opposite risk or a futures
trader (speculator) willing to take on the risk in the expectation of making a proﬁt.

EXAMPLE 39.1
3 February
An exporter anticipates receipt of $1 million on 1 May. The spot exchange rate is £1  $1.50
($1 million  £666,666).
The exporter buys ten sterling futures contracts, at £62,500 per contract, at an exchange rate of
£1  $1.50. The total face value of the futures is £625,000, notionally committing the exporter
to a payment of $937,500 for £625,000 (625,000  1.50  937,500).
1 May
The dollar has fallen so that the exchange rate stands at £1  $1.60. (A rise in the pound is a
fall in the dollar.) The sterling value of the $1 million is now £625,000.
The exporter sells ten sterling futures contracts at £1  $1.60. This gives the exporter the notional
right to the receipt of $1,000,000 (625,000  1.60) in exchange for £625,000.
The currency loss is £666,666  £625,000  £41,666 (  $66,666).
The futures proﬁt is $62,500 ($1,000,000  $937,500, the futures selling price minus the
futures buying price).
The loss in the currency market, arising from the weakening of the dollar, is largely offset by the
proﬁt in the futures market. The offset is not perfect since on 3 February the £666,666 in the
currency market is coupled with only £625,000 in the futures market. Such a mismatch arises
from the denomination of sterling futures contracts in units of £62,500; perfect matching is
impossible. Fortunately the exchange rate in the futures market moves in line with that in the
currency market, and is indeed equal to it.
In Example 39.1 it is assumed that a British exporter anticipates receipt of $1 million on 1 May.
The sale of goods is agreed upon on 3 February and the exporter wants to hedge against the risk
that the dollar will depreciate against the pound before 1 May, thus reducing the sterling value of
the dollar receipts.The exporter might anticipate a fall in the dollar or might simply want to obtain
protection against the possibility of a weakening of the dollar.In other words,the decision to hedge
may be based on a forecast of an adverse exchange rate movement or on the risk that there would
be an adverse change resulting from chance (unpredictable) currency movements. In either case
the exporter could hedge by buying sterling currency futures.

The exchange rate for futures need not be equal to, nor move to the same extent as, the spot
exchange rate.If the spot and futures rates change by different amounts,a degree of imperfection
enters the hedge.This possibility is illustrated by Example 39.2,which differs from Example 39.1
only in the assumption that the rate of exchange for the sterling futures moves to £1  $1.58 rather
than £1  $1.60.As a result the hedge is less successful.

EXAMPLE 39.2
3 February
The exporter anticipates receipt of $1 million on 1 May. The spot exchange rate is £1  $1.50
($1 million  £666,666).
The exporter buys ten sterling futures contracts at an exchange rate of £1  $1.50. Notionally
$937,500 is to be paid for £625,000.
1 May
The dollar has fallen so that the exchange rate stands at £1  $1.60. The sterling value of the
$1 million is now £625,000.
The exporter sells ten sterling futures contracts at £1  $1.58. This is equivalent to sales proceeds
of $987,500 (625,000  1.58) in exchange for £625,000.
The currency loss is £666,666  £625,000  £41,666 (  $66,666).
The futures proﬁt is $50,000 ($987,500$937,500).
EXERCISE 39.4
A UK institutional investor plans to invest £1,000,000 in US government bonds (Treasury bonds).
The current $/£ exchange rate is $1.80/£ and the three-month forward (and futures) exchange
rate is $1.7865.The investor takes the view that the US dollar is currently cheap but that US
Treasury bonds are currently overpriced,and would prefer to delay the purchase by three months.
(a) How can the investor hedge the currency risk of the purchase of US bonds?
(b) How many dollars does the investor expect to have available for the purchase of bonds when
hedging the currency risk?
(c) What is the forward (or futures) proﬁt or loss after the three months if the exchange rate turns
out to be (i) $1.60/£, and (ii) $2.00/£?
Answers
(a) The investor could sell £1,000,000 three month forward; or could sell 16 sterling futures
contracts (£1,000,000/£62,500) using futures with a maturity of (or in excess of) three
months.
(b) $1,786,500 (£1,000,000  $1.7865/£).
INTERNATIONAL INVESTING: CURRENCY DERIVATIVES
740

(c)
(i) The investor obtains $1,786,500 rather than $1,600,000 (£1,000,000  $1.60/£) and
hence proﬁts by $186,500 ($1,786,500  $1,600,000).
(ii) The investor obtains $1,786,500 rather than $2,000,000 (£1,000,000  $2.00/£) and
hence loses by $213,500 ($2,000,000  $1,786,500).
In both case (i) and case (ii) the futures proﬁt/loss will be increased by interest on variation
margin payments.
EXERCISE 39.5
A UK investment company has a ‘hedged’ US equity fund that seeks to provide exposure to the
US stock market whilst avoiding currency risk.The current exchange is $1.80/£ and the fund is
worth $9,000,000.
(a) How can the currency risk be hedged?
(b) What practical difﬁculties are likely to be encountered?
Answers
(a) Sterling ($9,000,000/$1.80  £5,000,000) could be bought forward,or 80 sterling futures
purchased (£5,000,000/£62,500  80).
(b) One problem is that the currency exposure varies with movements in the US stock market.
The size of the forward or futures position would need to be adjusted as the US dollar value
of the fund changes. Since very frequent changes are costly in terms of transaction costs, it is
not possible that the currency exposure will be perfectly covered at all times.
Forward and futures contracts would need to be renewed as they reach maturity.There would
be corresponding transaction costs each time a maturity date is reached.
EXERCISE 39.6
A UK fund manager has £10 million for a US stock market fund.The S&P 500 stands at 2000 and
S&P 500 futures trade at $250 per index point.The $/£ exchange rate is $2/£1.The size of the
sterling currency futures contract is £62,500.The fund manager wishes the fund to be hedged
against currency risk. Assume initial (and maintenance) margin of 5% for S&P 500 futures
contracts, and ignore initial (and maintenance) margin on the currency futures.
(a) Show how a fund, hedged against currency risk, can be structured using US stocks and
currency futures.
(b) Show how a fund, hedged against currency risk, can be structured using stock index futures
(i.e. a futures fund) and currency futures.
CURRENCY FORWARDS, FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS
741

(c) What hedge rebalancing may be required in (a) and (b)?
(d) What considerations would inﬂuence the choice between (a) and (b)?
Answers
(a) Sell the £10 million for $20 million.Use the $20 million to buy a portfolio of US stocks.Since
the risk is that the dollar will fall against the pound, i.e. that the pound will rise against the
dollar,it is necessary to buy sterling currency futures in order to hedge the fund.Initially the
requisite number of sterling currency futures contracts would be:
£10,000,000/£62,500  160
(b) Each S&P 500 futures contract relates to 2,000  $250  $500,000 of stock.To match a
balanced portfolio of $20 million of stock would require the purchase of:
$20,000,000/$500,000  40 S&P 500 futures contracts.
There would be a deposit of initial margin, which would need to be hedged against currency
risk.If initial margin were to be 5%,$1,000,000 would need to be hedged.This is equivalent
to hedging $1,000,000/$2  £500,000.The number of sterling currency futures contracts
to be bought is:
£500,000/£62,500  8
The remaining £9,500,000 could be held on deposit in sterling.
(c) In case (a),a rise in the S&P 500 would increase the exposure to the dollar.The sterling value
of the capital gain would need to be hedged, so the number of futures contracts should be
increased.The converse would apply to a fall in the S&P 500.
In case (b), movements in the S&P 500 futures price would cause changes in the level of
maintenance margin. This would require changes in the number of sterling currency 
futures contracts.Variation margin cash ﬂows could not be hedged with currency futures since
variation margin cannot be forecast (because movements of the S&P 500 and its futures cannot
be predicted).
(d) If there were a wish to actively manage the fund, the use of a futures fund would not be
appropriate.
If there is a desire to have an index tracker fund, the choice between (a) and (b)
would be inﬂuenced by factors such as relative transaction costs in stock and futures markets,
relative liquidity in stock and futures markets, the proximity of futures prices to their fair
prices, basis risk in futures markets, and the suitability of the S&P 500 as a stock index to be
tracked.
There may be a case for combining approaches (a) and (b) when structuring an index
tracker fund.The relative importance of the two approaches could be varied over time in the
light of factors such as the relationship of the futures price to its fair price (futures priced below
the fair price would be an attractive purchase).This would impart a form of active management
to an index tracker fund.

The ‘Guaranteed’ Exchange Rate
When using currency futures for hedging, the user attempts to guarantee an exchange rate.The
principles of futures pricing, in particular the interest rate parity relationship, have implications
for the exchange rate that a hedger may hope to guarantee.The exchange rate that a hedger expects
to obtain will lie between the spot rate and the futures rate,and will be dependent upon the timing
of closing out.
If the futures position is closed out immediately after being opened,the exchange rate obtained
will be the initial spot rate, e.g. £1  $1.50. If the futures contract is held to maturity, the rate
obtained will be the futures rate ruling on the date of entering the contract, e.g. £1  $1.48.
Closing out on an intermediate date would attain an exchange rate between these two extremes.
The exchange rate expected is a function of time. So, for example, if the futures contract initially
has six months to maturity and is closed out after three months,the exchange rate expected might
be £1  $1.49.
When a futures contract is held to maturity,currencies would be exchanged at the spot exchange
rate on the futures maturity date.The original futures exchange rate is obtained by setting the
futures profit/loss against the new currency price. Likewise the expected exchange rates on
intermediate dates are based on the new currency prices being offset (or added to) by proﬁts (or
losses) from futures contracts.
The variation of the realised exchange rate with the passage of time can be explained in terms
of changes in basis.Basis is initially $0.02 ($1.50  $1.48),but after six months it will have eroded
to zero: at maturity of a futures contract the futures and spot prices are identical.The difference
between the spot and futures prices can be regarded as the rate of depreciation/appreciation
required to offset the interest rate differential.As the time period shortens, the cash value of the
interest rate differential falls and the corresponding depreciation/appreciation declines to match.
So with just three months remaining to maturity the cash value of the interest rate differential is
half its level when six months remained and, correspondingly, the depreciation prior to maturity
is $0.01 rather than the original $0.02.
When closing out futures contracts prior to maturity there is no certainty that the anticipated
exchange rate will be obtained. If interest rates change before maturity, the implied currency
appreciation/depreciation will change,and with it the fair futures price.Furthermore the futures
price can move within the no-arbitrage band with the effect that the exchange rate actually obtained
using futures differs from the expected value.
EXERCISE 39.7
It is 1 December.A UK institutional investor is due to receive dividends of US$800,000 on 29
January.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange $/£ futures price for December maturity is $1.6012/£,
and for March maturity it is $1.6020/£.The futures maturity dates are 15 December and 15
March.
(a) How can the investor hedge the currency risk with futures?
(b) What exchange rate can the investor expect to be guaranteed for 29 January?
CURRENCY FORWARDS, FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS
743

(c) If on 29 January the March futures price is $1.6500/£, what is the proﬁt or loss from the
futures contracts?
Answers
(a) Based on an exchange rate of $1.6016/£, the expected $800,000 is equivalent to:
800,000/1.6016  £499,500.5
At £62,500 per contract, this corresponds to 499,500.5/62,500  7.99 sterling futures
contracts.The investor is most likely to hedge by buying eight futures contracts for March
maturity.
(b) 29 January falls midway between 15 December and 15 March.The expected exchange rate
therefore falls midway between the two futures prices,i.e.at $1.6016/£.(Assuming that the
futures prices equal the fair futures prices.)
(c) The proﬁt is $0.048 ($1.6500  $1.6020) per £1 on £500,000.This amounts to $0.048 
500,000  $24,000.
CURRENCY SWAPS
Currency swaps can be used to convert an investment in one currency into one in another currency.
Figure 39.3 illustrates a currency swap.Investor A has a US dollar bank deposit and wishes to swap
the interest receipts for the interest on a bank deposit in euros. Investor B has a euro deposit and
wants to exchange the interest receipts for those on a US dollar deposit. Investors A and B agree
to exchange interest and principal on their respective investments. A effectively obtains a euro
deposit and B simulates a dollar deposit.
The currency swap may be carried out by direct negotiation between the counterparties or by
means of a bank acting as intermediary and effectively becoming the counterparty to both
participants.Figure 39.4 illustrates the latter case.The bank operates as counterparty to both,and
investors A and B need not know the other’s identity.
The bank runs the risk of losses arising from default by one of the parties. If, for example, the
dollar strengthens against the euro,the bank will be gaining from its transactions with A and losing

with respect to B. Normally these gains and losses would cancel each other out but if A were to
renege on its obligations,the bank would be left with its loss-making commitments to B.The bank
is committed to paying both interest and principal in the relatively strong dollar while receiving
the same in the weakened euro.
CURRENCY OPTIONS AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS
The ultimate economic function of ﬁnancial derivatives (forwards,futures,swaps,and options) is
to provide means of risk reduction. Someone who is at risk from a price change can use options
to offset that risk.A call option gives the right to buy currency at a particular price,the strike price,
and a put option gives the right to sell currency at the strike price.A call option can be seen as a
means of ensuring an upper limit to the purchase price (if the market price exceeds the strike price,
then the option may be exercised in order to buy at the strike price).A put option provides a lower
limit to the selling price (exercise of the right to sell might occur in the event of the market price
being below the strike price). So options can be regarded as means of insurance against adverse
price movements.
A hedger needs to compare the use of options with at least two alternatives.Those alternatives
are leaving the exposure unhedged and covering it with futures or forwards. Consider a hedger
with a long position (such as a holder of a foreign currency investment) who seeks protection from
a fall in the currency price.The protection can be obtained by buying a put option.The put option
protects the hedger from a price fall since it allows the holder to sell the currency at the strike price,
and hence prevents any lower price being suffered. However, the put option does not prevent
gains being made from a rise in the currency price.
If the holder of a foreign currency investment is convinced that the currency price will not fall,
he or she will not be prepared to pay a premium for a put option to protect the position from a
price fall.At the other extreme,if the hedger feels certain that the price will fall,he or she would
cover the currency exposure completely by an offsetting short position (in markets where futures
or forwards are available,the short position can be achieved by selling futures contracts or selling
forward).The exposure to the currency price movement is thereby eliminated completely. It
follows that options will be used only when there is uncertainty as to the direction of price
movement.
One difﬁculty when using currency options to hedge foreign currency investments is that the
sum of foreign currency to be hedged is uncertain.The extent of the currency risk depends upon

the performance of the foreign currency investment. If the investment is in a stock that performs
very well, the currency exposure increases correspondingly. It is impossible to know how many
currency options are required. One solution for an investor is to use a quanto option.A quanto
option automatically adjusts the amount of currency being hedged to match changes in the foreign
currency value of the investment.
ZERO-COST OPTIONS
Buying an option involves paying a premium,whereas selling an option gives rise to the receipt of
a premium.Zero-cost options are instruments that can be broken down into constituent options.
They consist of long option positions ﬁnanced by the sale of other options.
One form of zero-cost option is known as a cylinder,or range forward.The constituent options
have different strike prices. A price fall could be hedged against by buying a put option with a
strike price below the currency price.The purchase of the put option could be ﬁnanced by means
of writing a call option,which has a strike price that is higher than the currency price.This has the
advantage of allowing some proﬁt from a rise in the currency price (up to the strike price of the
call option), but at the cost of having no protection against a price fall until the currency price
reaches the strike price of the put option.The other potential cost of this strategy is the loss of proﬁt
potential above the strike price of the written call option.If the currency price rises above the strike
price of the call,the buyer of the option is likely to exercise the right to buy currency at the strike
price.The writer of the call (the user of the zero-cost option) must sell currency at the strike price
when the currency price is higher.There is thus a loss on the written call that offsets the gain that
would otherwise have been made from a rise in the price of the currency.
DELTA HEDGING WITH OPTIONS
Matching the value to be hedged with the face value of options is known as ﬁxed hedging. For
example hedging a currency holding of 1,000,000 against a price fall might entail buying put
options that give the right to sell 1,000,000.A ﬁxed hedge will not provide full protection because
the premium paid will tend to ensure that there is a net loss.
Delta hedging provides a means of obtaining full compensation for an adverse currency price
movement. Delta hedging is alternatively known as dynamic hedging. Delta hedging provides a
technique for maintaining the original value of the currency holding.In other words,it can ensure
that the currency price plus proﬁt on the options equals the original currency price.This is achieved
by factoring up the number of option contracts purchased.
The delta of an option is the ratio of the change in the price of that option to the change in the
price of the underlying currency. Delta hedging involves the face value of the options exceeding
the amount of currency being hedged. If for example the delta were 0.5, the hedger would buy
options with a face value twice that of the currency covered.When the option price changes by half
as much as the currency price,twice as many options are bought.By using the appropriate ratio of
options to currency, any loss on the currency can be exactly offset by a proﬁt from the options.
The delta of an option is a measure of the responsiveness of the option price to movements in
the underlying currency price. It is the change in the option price divided by the change in the
currency price.Put options have negative deltas because they become more valuable as the currency
INTERNATIONAL INVESTING: CURRENCY DERIVATIVES
746

price falls.Call options have positive deltas because they rise in price as the currency price increases.
An option buyer can be regarded as having acquired an asset. Delta hedging involves ensuring
that increases in the value of one asset (the option) offset declines in the value of another asset (the
currency holding).
A difﬁculty that arises with delta hedging is the tendency for the delta to change as the currency
price moves.This suggests the need to adjust constantly the number of options held as the currency
price moves.This is problematical not only because of the time and expense involved in constantly
monitoring and adjusting option holdings,but also because option contracts are indivisible.Since
fractions of contracts cannot be bought, precise cover cannot be achieved.
CONCLUSION
The universe of investments includes foreign investments as well as domestic investments.
Investments in foreign countries tend to carry additional risks, when compared to domestic
investments. One of those risks is currency risk (exchange rate risk). A fall in the value of the
foreign currency relative to the domestic currency can severely damage the domestic currency
value of a foreign investment.Exchange rates can experience large changes in short periods.From
the perspective of a UK investor, a 50% rise in the value of a dollar-denominated asset would be
cancelled by a change in the exchange rate from £1$1.50 to £1$2.25.
Derivatives are available for the management of currency risk;they include forwards,futures,
options,and swaps.By using currency derivatives it is possible to remove the currency dimension
of an investment, and hence the currency risk. For example, covering a $1,500,000 investment
with £1,000,000 of sterling futures provides a cash ﬂow of $750,000 if the exchange rate moves
from £1$1.50 to £1$2.25.This amounts to £333,333 at the new exchange rate.This removes
the currency loss on the original investment, but there remains a currency loss on the gain from
the dollar asset. If the dollar investment produced a $450,000 gain, that gain would amount to
£200,000 ($450,000/$2.25  £200,000) at the new exchange rate rather than £300,000
($450,000/$1.50  £300,000).

Bond prices and
redemption yields
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Estimation of the fair price of a bond.
2. Consols and Permanent Interest-Bearing Shares (PIBs).
3. The significance of bond price convexity.
4. Bond equivalent yields, effective annual yields, and realised compound yields.
5. Horizon returns.
6. Estimating the real redemption yield on index-linked gilts.
DISCOUNT MODELS
As with other ﬁnancial investments, the fair prices of bonds are based on the present value of
expected future cash ﬂows.The general formula for estimating the fair price of a bond is:
P  C/(1r)  C/(1r)2  C/(1r)3  . . .  C/(1r)n  B/(1r)n
(1)
or P  C    
n
k1
1/(1r)k  B/(1r)n
(2)
where P is the fair price of the bond (its dirty price, which includes accrued interest), C is the
regular coupon payment each period, B is the money value to be paid to the bondholder at
redemption, r is the rate of discount per period, and n is the number of periods remaining to
redemption.
An important simpliﬁcation that has been made in equations (1) and (2) is the use of the same
rate of discount for all the future cash ﬂows.This assumes that interest rates are the same irrespective
of the term of the investment (i.e.that the yield curve is ﬂat).When valuing a bond an investment
analyst could use a different rate of discount for each cash ﬂow in order to take account of the
fact that there are different interest rates for different maturities.However,typically a single rate,
the redemption yield or yield to maturity,is applied to all future cash ﬂows.The redemption yield
751

(yield to maturity) of a bond could be looked upon as an average of discount rates applicable
to the various future cash ﬂows.The redemption yield indicates the average annual return to be
received by an investor holding a bond to maturity.
Interest rates (in the sense of redemption yields on risk-free bonds) are not the only
determinants of discount rates.Bonds with relatively high default risk need to yield a high expected
rate of return to compensate for the risk.The rate of discount is the required rate of return from
a bond.The required rate of return can be regarded as the sum of the yield on bonds that are free
of default risk (government bonds) and a risk premium to reﬂect the default risk of the bond
being valued.High default risk entails a high required rate of return and hence a high discount rate.
It follows that, for any particular stream of future cash ﬂows, high risk bonds would have higher
rates of discount and hence lower fair prices than low risk bonds.
Two conclusions that can be drawn from this account of bond pricing are,ﬁrst,that bond prices
have an inverse relationship to interest rates,and second,that they have an inverse relationship to
the risk of default. High interest rates and high risk are associated with low prices.
Discount models estimate the fair prices of bonds.The fair price of a bond is the price that an
investment analyst believes to be justiﬁed.Market prices of bonds may differ from fair prices.This
may be because market prices fail accurately to reﬂect all relevant information, or because the
estimated fair prices are poor estimates.The use of a single discount rate,rather than a time-varying
discount rate, on all future coupon and principal receipts is a potential source of error.Another
source of error is the possibility of inaccurate estimates of discount rates.
The estimation of future discount rates requires an understanding of the factors that affect
discount rates.This divides into understanding the determinants of risk-free rates (government
bond rates) and the determinants of risk premiums (the additions to government bond rates
required to compensate for the risk of default).If a single discount rate is to be used,the risk-free
rate is the redemption yield on a government bond of similar maturity (more precisely,duration)
to the bond being analysed.If a time-varying risk-free discount rate is to be used it may be necessary
to produce estimates based on the factors that inﬂuence government bond redemption yields.
Fleming and Remolona (1999),when investigating US government bonds,found that their prices
(and,by extension,their redemption yields) were inﬂuenced by economic data.In particular data
on employment, inflation, and short-term interest rates (central bank monetary policy) were
found to be important determinants of redemption yields. Other relevant factors included retail
sales and industrial production.
Ewing (2003) looked for factors that appeared to inﬂuence the default risk premiums to be
added to government bond redemption yields when estimating discount rates for corporate bonds.
Industrial production,inﬂation,and short-term interest rates (central bank monetary policy) were
found to be important factors.These factors may affect the risk of default by impacting on the
ﬁnancial position of companies.Ewing acknowledged that other researchers had found overreaction
to be a factor in the determination of risk premiums, which suggests that behavioural finance
factors (such as representativeness,sentiment,and momentum) may be partly responsible for the
size of risk premiums.
An important distinction to be made when considering bond prices is between the clean and
dirty prices.When a bond is purchased, the buyer must include in the purchase price a sum
corresponding to the seller’s share of the next coupon. If the coupon is paid six-monthly, and the
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
752

bond is sold three months after the last coupon payment date, the seller would require the price
to include half the next coupon so that holding the bond for the previous three months provides
an interest yield.The rights to the coupon accumulated by the seller are referred to as accrued
interest.The clean price of a bond excludes accrued interest whereas the dirty price includes it.
Quoted prices are usually clean prices whereas the price to be paid is the dirty price.
EXERCISE 40.1
A bond pays a coupon of £4 every six months, and £100 will be repaid at redemption.There are
two years to redemption and the next coupon is due in six months.The redemption yield on similar
bonds is 6% p.a. Estimate the fair price of the bond.
Answer
P  C/(1r)  C/(1r)2  C/(1r)3  C/(1r)4  100/(1r)4
where P is the fair price of the bond, C is the periodic coupon, and r is the redemption yield on a
six-month basis. Since coupons are paid every six months, the relevant period for discounting is
six months. Two years to redemption amounts to four six-month periods to redemption.
An interest rate of 6% p.a. indicates a rate of 3% per six-month period.

(ii) £100/(1.05)2  £90.70 or £100/(1.025)4  £90.60
It is to be noted that when the redemption yield equals the coupon rate the bond trades at
par (i.e. its price equals its nominal value of £100).Also sensitivity to interest rate changes
rises as the coupon rate falls.A fall in the interest rate from 10% p.a.to 5% p.a.causes a 9.4%
rise in the price of the 10% coupon bond,a 9.72% [(10091.14)/91.14  0.0972] rise in
the price of the 5% coupon bond,and a 9.75% rise in the price of the zero coupon bond using
annual discounting or a 10.13% rise in the price of the zero coupon bond when six-monthly
discounting is used.
It can thus be seen that, when the discounting is carried out in a consistent way (six-
monthly) across the three cases, the relationship between coupon rate and sensitivity to
interest rate changes is as shown in the table.
Lower coupon bonds have the greater sensitivity to interest rate changes.

VALUING COUPON STREAMS AS ANNUITIES
An annuity is a stream of future payments,typically a ﬁxed sum of money each period.The stream
of coupon payments on a bond can be seen as equivalent to an annuity. Correspondingly the
prospective series of coupon receipts can be valued as an annuity.The equation for valuing an
annuity is:
AV  { C  [ C/ (1  r)n ] }/ r
(3)
where AV is the value of the annuity (the present value of the expected coupons), C is the
coupon,n is the number of periods for which the coupon will be paid (typically six-month periods),
and r is the periodic interest rate (which is half the per annum rate in the case of six-monthly
payments).The equation shown is applicable when the next coupon receipt is a full period away.
The value of the bond can be estimated as being equal to the value of the annuity plus the present
value of the sum payable at maturity.
BV AV  M/ (1  r)n
(4)
where BV is the estimated value (fair price) of the bond and M is the sum to be received by the
bondholder at maturity. Despite the appearance of precision, this remains merely an estimate of
the fair price.This is partly because r is a proxy for a series of separate interest rates,each applicable
to a particular future cash ﬂow.
EXERCISE 40.3
A corporate bond pays a six-monthly coupon of £5,has just paid a coupon,and matures in ten years.
Ten-year government bond redemption yields are 5% p.a., and the corporate bond has a risk
premium of 3% p.a.Treating the coupon stream as an annuity,estimate the fair price of the bond.
Answer
The equation for an annuity is:
AV  {C  [C/(1  r)n]}/r
The discount rate is 4% since the annual interest rate is 8% (5%  3%), and the coupons
are paid six-monthly.The number of six-month periods, n, is 20.
The present value of the future coupons (the value of the annuity) is therefore:
AV  {5  [5/(1.04)20]}/0.04
 {5  [5/2.1911]}/0.04
 {5  2.2819}/0.04
 2.7181/0.04  £67.95
BOND PRICES AND REDEMPTION YIELDS
755

The annuity, in the form of the future coupon stream, has a value of £67.95.
The fair price of the bond is:
BV AV  M/(1  r)n
BV  £67.95  £100/(1.04)20
 £67.95  £100/2.1911
 £67.95  £45.64  £113.59
CONSOLS AND PIBs
Consols are undated government bonds; the government may choose to pay the ﬁxed periodic
coupon in perpetuity, there is no obligation to ever redeem the bond. PIBs (Permanent Interest-
Bearing shares) are issued by building societies. Like consols, PIBs pay a fixed annual sum in
perpetuity; the building society need never repay the original investment. Preference shares are
issued by ﬁrms and (usually) pay a ﬁxed annual dividend in perpetuity,with no obligation to repay
the initial sum paid for the shares.The factor that consols, PIBs, and preference shares have in
common is the perpetual nature of the coupon or dividend payments. When cash flows are
perpetual equation (1) or (2) can be simpliﬁed to equation (5).
P  C/r
(5)
P is the fair price of the security, C is the periodic coupon, and r is the discount rate (required
rate of return).It can be noted that equation (5) implies inverse proportionality between discount
rates and asset prices.If the discount rate halves the fair price doubles,if the discount rate doubles
the fair price halves. Since discount rates and interest rates are closely related this implies a
relationship,between asset prices and interest rates,which is close to being inversely proportional.
ACCRUED INTEREST AND REBATE INTEREST
If an investor buys a bond between coupon payment dates, the investor receives the next coupon
whereas the seller receives no coupon.This means that the seller receives no coupon return from
holding the bond since the previous coupon payment.To deal with this, an adjustment is made.
The buyer adds the value of accumulated coupon rights to the purchase price.This addition is
known as accrued interest.Accrued interest ensures that the next coupon is shared between the
buyer and seller in proportion to the amount of time (the time between coupon payments) each
has held the bond.The price of the bond excluding accrued interest is the clean price,and the price
inclusive of accrued interest is the dirty price.So the buyer receives the whole of the next coupon,
but will have already paid part of it to the seller.
For a bond that makes coupon payments twice a year,the accrued interest if the settlement date
(the date of sale/purchase) occurs on or before the ex-dividend date is:
(c/2)  (t/s)
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
756

where c is the annual coupon, t is the number of days since the last coupon payment, and s
is the number of days in the coupon period (period between the last and next coupon payment
dates).
Most bonds have ex-dividend dates.After the ex-dividend date the next coupon,in its entirety,
is paid to the seller.As an example, UK government bonds go ex-dividend seven days before the
coupon payment date. Subsequent to the ex-dividend date there is negative accrued interest.The
buyer pays a reduced price (a price below the clean price) to compensate for losing coupon returns
for a few days. Negative accrued interest is called rebate interest.
For a bond that makes coupon payments twice a year, the rebate interest in the event of the
settlement date occurring between the ex-dividend date and the coupon payment date is:
(c/2)  (1  [t/s])
BOND PRICE CONVEXITY
Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates, but the relationship is not symmetrical.
A particular percentage point interest rate change will have asymmetric effects on the bond
price dependent upon whether rates rise or fall. The proportionate fall in the bond price
resulting from a rise in interest rates is less than the proportionate rise in the bond price
caused by a fall when the percentage point change in interest rates is the same in the two
cases.
This can be illustrated by reference to the case of an irredeemable bond (a bond with no maturity
date such as a consol or PIB).The price of an irredeemable bond is given by equation 5.
P  C/r 
(5)
where P represents the fair price of the bond,C the coupon,and r is the interest rate (required
rate of return).Consider the case of a £5 annual coupon and an initial interest rate of 10% p.a.The
fair price of the bond would be estimated as:
£5 / 0.1  £50
If the interest rate falls by 2 percentage points to 8% p.a., the price of the bond is expected
to rise to:
£5 / 0.08  £62.50
If the interest rate rises by 2 percentage points to 12% p.a., the fair price of the bond falls to:
£5 / 0.12  £41.67
Whereas the interest rate fall results in a 25% price rise, the equivalent interest rate increase
causes a 16.67% price decline.This asymmetry of price response is referred to as convexity.

BOND EQUIVALENT YIELDS, EFFECTIVE ANNUAL YIELDS,
AND REALISED COMPOUND YIELDS
Earlier in this chapter it was shown that the future cash ﬂows from a bond, together with the
required rate of return, could be used to estimate the fair price of the bond.An investor could
estimate the fair price by using the required rate of return to discount the future cash ﬂows.The
process could be reversed in order to ascertain the redemption yield of the bond from knowledge
of its current price and the future cash ﬂows. For a bond that pays coupons annually, and has four
years to redemption, the redemption yield (y) can be obtained by solving equation 6 for y.
P  C/(1  y)  C/(1  y)2  C/(1  y)3  C/(1  y)4  B/(1  y)4
(6)
where P is the current market price of the bond, C is the annual coupon, B is the redemption
value of the bond, and y is the redemption yield (yield to maturity).
Suppose that a bond has six years to maturity, pays an annual coupon of £6, and is trading at
£104.From this information the redemption yield is found to be 5.21% p.a.(This can be calculated
using computer software or a ﬁnancial calculator.) This says that at the end of the six years,assuming
that coupons are invested at 5.21% p.a., the value of the bond investment will be the same as the
value of a deposit of £104 paying 5.21% p.a. accumulated over six years.
The redemption yield is less than the coupon rate of 6% because of the capital loss from the fall
in price from £104 to the redemption value of £100 over the six years. (This fall in price to the
par value of £100 is known as the pull to par.) A crude approximation can be obtained by dividing
the price fall by the number of years (£4/6  £0.67) in order to estimate the average price fall
per year.This ﬁgure is then subtracted from the coupon (£6  £0.67  £5.33).The resulting ﬁgure
is divided by the bond price in order to obtain a rate of return (£5.33/£104  5.13% p.a.).The
result is known as the simple yield to maturity.
UK government bonds (gilts) typically pay coupons twice a year. In this case a semi-
annual redemption yield can be computed.The semi-annual redemption yield is shown as w in
equation 7.
P  (C/2)/(1  w)  (C/2)/(1  w)2  (C/2)/(1  w)3  (C/2)/(1  w)4  (C/2)/
(1  w)5  (C/2)/(1  w)6  (C/2)/(1  w)7  (C/2)/(1  w)8  B/(1  w)8
(7)
The bond equivalent yield is obtained by doubling the semi-annual redemption yield. If the
bond equivalent yield is denoted by z,then z  2w.The bond equivalent yield ignores compounding
when converting from a semi-annual yield to an annual yield.
The effective annual yield takes account of the compounding.The effective annual yield is
given by:
(1  w)2 1
The realised compound yield is the average compound rate of return actually obtained from an
investment.The realised compound yield is affected by the rate of yield on reinvested coupons.
The above calculations of redemption yield assume that coupons are reinvested at the redemption
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
758

yield.The realised compound yield equals the redemption yield if coupons are reinvested at
the redemption yield and the bond is held to redemption.If the reinvestment rate for the coupons
exceeds the redemption yield, the realised compound yield will exceed the redemption yield.
If the reinvestment rate for the coupons is less than the redemption yield, the realised compound
yield will be less than the redemption yield. So if an investor buys a bond (with a view to holding
it to redemption) when the redemption yield is 5% p.a., and redemption yields on similar bonds
subsequently rise above 5% p.a., the realised compound yield will exceed 5% p.a. If redemption
yields fall below 5% p.a., the realised compound yield by the redemption date would be less
than 5% p.a.
EXERCISE 40.4
A bond, which has recently paid a coupon, pays a coupon of £5 annually and has two years to
redemption.The redemption yield on similar bonds is 5% p.a.
(a) What is the fair price of the bond?
(b) What is the realised compound yield if redemption yields remain at 5% p.a., and the bond is
held to redemption?
(c) What is the realised compound yield if redemption yields are 8% p.a. at the time of the next

(d) What is the realised compound yield if redemption yields are 2% p.a. at the time of the next
coupon payment, and the bond is held to redemption?
Answers
(a) The fair price, P, is given by:
P  £5/(1.05)  £105/(1.05)2  £100
(The £105 comprises £5 coupon plus £100 redemption value.)
(b) Reinvesting coupons at 5% p.a. produces a ﬁnal sum of:
£5 (1.05)  £105  £110.25
The realised compound yield is (1.1025)0.5  1  0.05, i.e. 5% p.a.
So,when coupons are reinvested at the initial redemption yield,the realised compound yield
equals the original redemption yield.
(c) Reinvesting coupons at 8% p.a. produces a ﬁnal sum of:
£5 (1.08)  £105  £110.4
The realised compound yield is (1.104)0.5 1  0.0507, i.e. 5.07% p.a.
BOND PRICES AND REDEMPTION YIELDS
759

So,when coupons are reinvested at a rate higher than the initial redemption yield,the realised
compound yield exceeds the original redemption yield.
(d) Reinvesting coupons at 2% p.a. produces a ﬁnal sum of:
£5 (1.02)  £105  £110.1
The realised compound yield is (1.101)0.5  1  0.0493, i.e. 4.93% p.a.
So,when coupons are reinvested at a rate lower than the initial redemption yield,the realised
compound yield is below the original redemption yield.
HORIZON RETURN (HOLDING-PERIOD RETURN)
The redemption yield can be decomposed into three components:
Redemption Yield  Coupons  Interest on Coupons  Pull to Par
The pull to par refers to the bond price change that results from the tendency of bond prices
to move towards their par (i.e. nominal) values as they approach maturity. For example a bond
bought for £90 would gain £10 by maturity as its price moves to £100, which is the bond value at
redemption (maturity).The value at redemption is the par, or nominal, value.
Bonds are not always held to redemption. If a bond is sold before redemption, the realised
return is unlikely to equal the redemption yield. In such a case any price change arising from
interest rate movements (the yield change effect) must be taken into account.The total yield
(horizon return) is now:
Horizon Return  Coupons  Interest on Coupons  Pull to Par Yield Change Effect
The pull-to-par gain (or loss) will be related to the ratio between the time to sale of the bond
and the time to redemption.
EXERCISE 40.5
Two years ago, an investor bought a ﬁve-year zero coupon bond with a par value of £100 when
interest rates were 7% p.a.The investor sold it recently when interest rates were 5% p.a.Assume
that the interest rate is the same (per annum) for all investment horizons.
What was the horizon return?
Answer
The price of the bond, two years ago, was £100/[1.07]5  £71.30.
The current fair price would be £100/[1.05]3  £86.38.

to par there is a yield change effect of (£86.38  £81.63)/£81.63  0.0582, i.e. 5.82%.
As a per annum rate the yield change effect is (1.0582)0.5  1  0.0287,i.e.2.87% p.a.Between

i.e. 10.07% p.a.
INDEX-LINKED GILT REDEMPTION YIELDS
Index-linked gilts adjust coupon and redemption payments so that they rise in line with inﬂation.
Inﬂation is measured by means of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) and the RPI used to adjust a cash
ﬂow is the index eight months prior to the cash ﬂow.To calculate a redemption yield for an index-
linked gilt,it is necessary to assume a rate of inﬂation.A constant inﬂation rate is normally assumed
for the period to redemption.
When a rate of inﬂation,for the period to redemption,is assumed it becomes possible to calculate
the future cash ﬂows in nominal (money) terms.The redemption yield (in nominal terms) can then
be derived from the current gilt price,the future coupons,and the future redemption payment.It
is then necessary to convert the nominal redemption yield to a real redemption yield. For a bond
that pays coupons once a year the real redemption yield can be derived from equation 8.
1  r  (1  n)/1  i)
(8)
where r is the real redemption yield, n is the nominal redemption yield, and i is the assumed
rate of inﬂation.Equation 8 can be readily amended to deal with gilts that pay their coupons twice
yearly. In newspapers such as the Financial Times real redemption yields for index-linked gilts are
shown based on the assumption of inﬂation rates of 3% p.a. and 5% p.a.
CONCLUSION
The word bond is used in many ways in the context of investments. Insurance companies and
building societies often use the word to describe particular institutional investments.In this chapter,
the word bond has been used to describe a class of assets that takes the form of debt. Bonds are
debts of the governments, companies, and organisations that issue them.
One of the ways in which bonds differ from shares is in the relative certainty of future cash ﬂows.
BOND PRICES AND REDEMPTION YIELDS
761

In the absence of default by the issuer,the future cash ﬂows from a bond are typically known with
certainty.This is in contrast to shares since shares typically have dividend payments, which are
variable and uncertain.The relative certainty of bond cash ﬂows renders the pricing and analysis
of bonds more precise than the pricing and analysis of shares.Whereas dividend discount models
are just one of many approaches to pricing shares,and do not provide absolutely reliable estimates
of fair prices, a discount model is often all that is required for the reliable estimation of the fair
price of a bond.The relative certainty of bond cash ﬂows means that other characteristics,such as
duration and convexity, can also be reliably estimated.
When including bonds in a portfolio,along with other asset classes such as shares,it is necessary
to have estimates of future bond yields and of bond price volatility (risk).Expected return and risk
are values required for each prospective investment to be included in a portfolio (see Chapter 13
on portfolio diversiﬁcation).The present chapter has examined some measures of bond return
(bond yield) and the next chapter examines measures of bond risk (bond duration).

Duration and risk
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Macaulay’s duration.
2. Modified duration.
3. Money duration (price value of a basis point).
4. Immunisation of a bond portfolio against interest rate risk.
5. Bond index (tracker) funds.
6. Interest rate anticipation strategies.
There are two types of risk encountered by investors in bonds.There is price (or capital) risk,and
reinvestment (or income) risk. Price risk is the risk that bond prices can change. For example a
general rise in interest rates, or a fall in the credit rating of a particular bond, would reduce the
price of a bond.A capital loss would result.
Reinvestment risk refers to the uncertainty as to the interest rate at which coupons and
redemption sums can be invested.This causes uncertainty as to the ﬁnal sum that will be available
at the end of an investment horizon.
Capital risk is measured by duration.The duration measures are useful for the purposes of
predicting the effects of interest rate changes, and protecting bond portfolios against the effects
of such changes. Duration measures can also be used to design portfolios such that price risk and
reinvestment risk tend to cancel each other out.
THE MEASUREMENT OF BOND PRICE VOLATILITY (DURATION)
Bond price volatility is measured by duration.The duration measures include Macaulay’s duration,
modified duration, and money duration. Macaulay’s duration is the average period of time to
the receipt of cash ﬂows. Each time period (to the receipt of a cash ﬂow) is weighted by
the proportionate contribution of that cash ﬂow to the fair price of the bond. Macaulay’s
763

duration is transformed into modiﬁed duration by means of dividing it by (1r/n) where r is the
redemption yield (which approximates an interest rate) and n is the number of coupon payments
per year.
Macaulay’s duration has another meaning, it is the proportionate change in the bond
price (fair price of the bond) arising from a unit proportional change in (1redemption yield).
That is:
Macaulay’s duration 
(1)
(The symbol  signiﬁes ‘change in’, and P is the bond price.)
The corresponding interpretation of modiﬁed duration is:
Modiﬁed duration 
(2)
Equation (2) is derived from equation (1) by means of dividing by (1r) and observing that
(1r)  r.
Equations (1) and (2) assume annual coupon payments.When coupons are paid more frequently,
r is replaced by r/n (the annual redemption yield divided by the number of coupon payments per
year).This is consistent with treating the redemption yield as being on a per period basis. For
example UK and US government bonds typically pay coupons six-monthly. In those cases n  2,
and r/2 is the redemption yield per six-month period.
The calculation of duration can be demonstrated by an example. Suppose that a bond has just
paid a coupon,matures in two years,and pays a coupon of £6 six-monthly.The interest rate is 10%
p.a. for all maturities.The fair price of the bond is:
P  £6/(1.05)  £6/(1.05)2  £6/(1.05)3  £106/(1.05)4
 £5.71  £5.44  £5.18  £87.21  £103.54
(Note that an interest rate of 10% p.a. is 5% per six-month period.)
Macaulay’s duration is calculated as the weighted average of the periods to the receipt of cash
ﬂows.The weighting is based on the contribution of the period’s cash ﬂow to the fair price of the
bond.The periods are 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 years.

EXERCISE 41.1
A corporate bond pays an annual coupon of £10 and has four years to maturity. It has just paid a
coupon.As a result of a downgrading of its credit rating,its required rate of return rises from 8%
p.a.to 12% p.a.What are the effects of this change on (a) the price,and (b) the Macaulay’s duration,
of the bond? (c) Discuss your results.

(a) The fair price of the bond, when the required rate of return is 8% p.a., is shown as P1 in the
following calculation.
P1  £10/(1.08)  £10/(1.08)2  £10/(1.08)3  £110/(1.08)4

P1  £9.26  £8.57  £7.94  £80.85  £106.62

(b) Macaulay’s duration when the required rate of return is 8% p.a.is shown as D1 in the following
calculation.
D1  (9.26/106.62)1  (8.57/106.62)2  (7.94/106.62)3  (80.85/106.62)4
D1  0.087  0.161  0.223  3.033  3.50 years (to two decimal places).
Macaulay’s duration, when the required rate of return is 12% p.a., is shown as D2 in the
following calculation.
D2  (8.93/93.93)1  (7.97/93.93)2  (7.12/93.93)3  (69.91/93.93)4
D2  0.095  0.170  0.227  2.977  3.47 years (to two decimal places).
(c) The calculations illustrate the inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates.
The relationship between default risk and bond price is also illustrated.Higher default risk
is associated with a higher required rate of return (and hence higher interest rate and discount
rate).The higher required rate of return entails a lower fair price of the bond.
A higher discount rate is associated with lower duration because the high discount rate has
a relatively large impact on the more distant cash ﬂows, and hence the weighting of longer
periods is reduced (in the calculation of duration).
The calculations also illustrate that discount rates above coupon rates are associated with
bond prices below par, and vice versa for discount rates below coupon rates.

MONEY DURATION (PRICE VALUE OF A BASIS POINT)
Modiﬁed duration multiplied by the change in bond redemption yield (multiplied by 1) shows
the approximate proportionate change in the bond price resulting from the yield change.
P/P  MD  r
(3)
where P/P is the proportionate change in the bond price, MD is the negative of modiﬁed
duration, and r is the change in the redemption yield of the bond. (The redemption yield
approximates the interest rate relating to the duration of the bond.)
Multiplying both sides of equation (3) by the initial bond price, P, gives equations (4) and (5).
P  (P/P)  P  MD  r  P 
(4)
P/r  MD  P
(5)
The term (MD  P) might be called money duration.It shows the price change resulting from
a yield change.It should be noted that yields are here expressed as decimals rather than percentages,
so for example 1% would be expressed as 0.01 and a basis point (0.01%) as 0.0001.Alternative
names for money duration are perturbation and,where the yield change is 0.01%,the price value
of a basis point (PVBP).
For small changes in redemption yield (e.g. 0.1%), equation (4) provides a reasonably good
approximation to the actual change in the bond price. However for large changes (e.g. 1%), the
approximation is less satisfactory.As the size of the change in the yield (or interest rate) increases,
equation (4) becomes less accurate as a means of estimating bond price movements.This is because
of convexity.(Since MD and P change when r changes,the ratio P/r changes when r changes.
Equations (4) and (5) are based on a constant MD  P.)

(a) A redemption yield of 3.5% p.a. is 1.75% per six-month period.
The fair price of the bond is:

Money duration is:
M  1.8383  £112.45  £206.72
(b) A 0.1% p.a. decrease in redemption yield should, using money duration, cause a:
£206.72  0.001  £0.21 increase in the bond price.
The new bond price should therefore be:
£112.45  £0.21  £112.66.
(c) A 1% p.a. decrease in redemption yield should, using money duration, cause a:
£206.72  0.01  £2.07 increase in the bond price.
Therefore the new bond price should be:
£112.45  £2.07  £114.52.
(d) Using the discount model, the fair price of the bond at a redemption yield of 3.4% p.a.
(3.5%  0.1%) is:
P  £5/1.017  £5/[1.017]2  £5/[1.017]3  £105/[1.017]4
 £4.92  £4.83  £4.75  £98.15  £112.65
The fair price of the bond at a redemption yield of 2.5% p.a. (3.5%  1%) is:
P  £5/1.0125  £5/[1.0125]2  £5/[1.0125]3  £105/[1.0125]4
 £4.94  £4.88  £4.82  £99.91  £114.55
(e) With a 0.1% p.a. change in redemption yield there is virtually no difference between the
bond price estimated using money duration,and that estimated using the discount model.In
fact the small difference, of 0.01, partly arises from rounding to two decimal places (i.e. it
would be less than 0.01 in the absence of the rounding).
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
768

With a 1% p.a. change in redemption yield the estimate using money duration is 0.03
lower than that from the discount model.This small error from the money duration approach
arises from convexity. Money duration fails to reﬂect the convexity of the bond price-yield
relationship and hence produces an erroneous estimate.
The estimate of the bond price change, using money duration, is more reliable when
redemption yield (interest rate) changes are small than when they are large.

(a) If the investor expects interest rates to increase, bond prices are expected to fall.The bond
with the higher modiﬁed duration should show the greatest fall.The investor would therefore
choose to sell bond A because it has the higher modiﬁed duration.
(b) If the investor expects interest rates to decrease, bond prices are expected to rise.The bond
with the higher modiﬁed duration would show the greater price rise.The investor should
choose to hold bond A and sell bond B since bond A has the higher modiﬁed duration.
THE BEHAVIOUR OF MACAULAY’S DURATION
The duration (Macaulay’s duration) of a bond is systematically affected by certain characteristics
of that bond.This can be summarised by a set of rules.
Rule 1:The duration of a zero coupon bond equals its time to maturity.
Since a zero coupon bond generates only one cash ﬂow, the payment of principal at maturity, the
average time to the receipt of cash ﬂows equals the time to that payment.
Rule 2: Holding time to maturity and redemption yield (yield to maturity) constant, duration is
inversely related to the coupon.
Duration is the weighted average time to the receipt of cash ﬂows,and the weighting of each time
period is related to the cash ﬂow at the end of that time period. Low coupon bonds involve
low weightings attached to time periods other than the period to ﬁnal maturity.The period
to the repayment of principal will dominate the earlier periods in the determination of
duration.High coupon bonds give higher weightings to the earlier periods with the result that
the average period (the duration) is shorter.
Rule 3: Holding the coupon rate constant, duration generally increases with time to maturity.
As maturity increases,the time periods to the receipt of cash ﬂows will increase.This will tend to
increase duration. However for bonds trading at a very deep discount (bonds whose coupon
rates are far below their redemption yields) increases in maturity may eventually be associated
with reductions in duration.
Duration increases by less than a year for each year that maturity increases (unless the bond has a
zero coupon). Furthermore duration increases at a decreasing rate as time to maturity
increases. Doubling the time to maturity tends to increase duration, but by less than double.
Rule 4: Holding coupon and maturity constant, duration is inversely related to redemption yield
(yield to maturity).
Higher redemption yields imply higher discount rates. Higher discount rates reduce the relative
importance of distant cash ﬂows. Distant time periods receive lower weightings, and hence
duration falls.This rule does not apply to zero coupon bonds.
Rule 5:The duration of an irredeemable bond is given by (1  r)/r, where r is the redemption
yield.
If a bond pays the same coupon each period forever without the principal ever being repaid, the
duration equals (1  r)/r. It is illustrative to consider some examples.Table 41.1 shows the
duration relating to various redemption yields.
In the case of high redemption yields,the cash ﬂows occurring early in the life of the bond dominate
the calculation of duration.The distant cash ﬂows are so heavily discounted that they provide
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
770

very low weightings for the longer periods. Finally it might be noted that as the maturity
of a bond increases, its duration will eventually converge towards that of an irredeemable
bond.

(d) (i) If the fund manager expects a rise in interest rates, bond prices are expected to fall.The
fund manager should shorten duration by replacing Treasury 15% 2000 with three-month
Treasury bills.This will reduce the extent of the loss since Treasury bills, having lower
duration, are less sensitive to interest rate changes than the bonds.
(ii) If the fund manager expects interest rates to fall,the expectation is that bond prices will
rise. Higher duration provides greater sensitivity to interest rate changes. By replacing
Treasury 15% 2000 with Treasury 12% 2002,the fund manager raises duration and hence
increases the proﬁt to be made from a fall in interest rates.(Since duration increases with
greater maturity and lower coupons,Treasury 12% 2002 will have a longer duration than
Treasury 15% 2000.)
PORTFOLIO IMMUNISATION
A portfolio of bonds may be held with a view to the provision of a known ﬂow of income in
the future.The investor could be an individual or an institution such as an insurance company
making annuity payments. Immunisation of a bond portfolio aims to protect the investor
against the future cash ﬂows falling below the levels required. Shortfalls could occur as a
result of either capital losses or a decline in the interest rates at which proceeds can be
reinvested.
One approach to portfolio immunisation is the construction of a dedicated portfolio.A dedicated
portfolio entails future cash ﬂow receipts, both of coupons and repayments of principal at
redemption, that precisely match the cash ﬂows required. For example the future payments to
pensioners from an annuity fund might be synchronised with the coupon and redemption receipts
from the bonds that comprise the fund.The matching of receipts with requirements must relate
to both amount and timing. Although dedicated portfolios achieve immunisation they are very
difﬁcult to construct.
An alternative approach to immunisation is maturity matching.The required cash ﬂows from
the portfolio, in terms of both amount and timing, are used as the basis for choosing the bonds
for the portfolio. By ensuring that bond maturities coincide with cash withdrawals from the
portfolio,the risk of interest rate changes depressing the market values of bonds is avoided.In this
way the portfolio manager would be sure of receiving the redemption value of a bond.One element
of uncertainty does remain when such a strategy is used.Since interest rates vary over time,there
is uncertainty as to the rate of return to be obtained from investing coupon receipts.This is
reinvestment risk. Changes in the rates of return on reinvested income can have a substantial
impact on subsequent values of the portfolio.This risk can be reduced by using duration matching
instead of maturity matching.
The duration of a portfolio can be calculated as the weighted average of the durations of the
bonds in the portfolio.The weighting is based on the market values of the various bond holdings
(e.g. if a particular bond provides 25% of the value of the portfolio, its duration would get a 0.25
weighting when calculating the duration of the portfolio).

Duration matching involves matching the Macaulay’s duration of the bond portfolio to the time at
which the cash ﬂow will be required.Bond price changes tend to offset variations in returns from
reinvested coupons.The capital risk of bond price changes and the income risk from reinvestment
of coupons tend to cancel each other out. Losses from bond price falls are offset by increased
income from the reinvestment of coupons, and vice versa. Redemption yield rises that reduce
bond prices raise the returns from reinvesting coupons. Conversely redemption yield falls raise
bond prices but lower the rate of return on reinvested coupons.

It can be seen that the capital loss from the 1% p.a. rise in interest rates is approximately

Since there would normally be more than one cash outﬂow to be funded from a bond portfolio,
duration matching becomes a matter of matching the Macaulay’s duration of the portfolio with the
Macaulay’s duration of the cash outﬂows.
A bond portfolio immunised by duration matching will require frequent rebalancing in order
to maintain the matching. In other words, it will be necessary to make frequent changes to the
composition of the portfolio.This is because Macaulay’s duration changes as a result of interest rate
movements, and in consequence of the passage of time.
These factors are likely to affect the duration of the cash outﬂow commitments differently from
the duration of the bond portfolio. In consequence, the composition of the portfolio would need
to be changed in order to keep its duration in line with that of the cash outﬂow commitments.
Duration matching is probably the easiest means of immunising a portfolio because of the facility
of using bond futures to achieve the requisite adjustments.Any discrepancy between the duration
of the liabilities (prospective cash outﬂows) and the duration of the bond portfolio can be removed
by taking an offsetting position in bond futures.
Bond futures are commitments to trade bonds during a future month at a price agreed when
taking the futures position. Futures positions make proﬁts and losses as bond prices change, and
hence as redemption yields change.Futures thus have durations.Buying futures adds to a portfolio’s
duration,and selling futures reduces the portfolio’s duration.Since futures positions cost nothing
to establish (the only initial cash outlay is a returnable deposit known as initial margin),they provide
an easy and cash efﬁcient means of altering the duration of a portfolio.
One problem with using portfolio duration is that the interest rate (redemption yield) becomes
ambiguous.Each bond in the portfolio will have its own redemption yield.Redemption yields do
not move to equal extents.Two portfolios with the same duration may respond differently to a
general change in interest rates because their redemption yields change to different degrees.
Short-term, medium-term, and long-term interest rates may change to different degrees.
Portfolios with identical durations may be constructed in different ways. A portfolio could be
structured entirely using bonds with a medium maturity (a bullet portfolio), or a portfolio might
be constructed using a combination of bonds from two very different maturity ranges (this is known
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
774

as a barbell portfolio and may combine very short maturity and very long maturity bonds), or a
portfolio could be structured using maturities spread over a wide range (a ladder portfolio).Despite
the identical durations, the values of these portfolios would respond very differently to a general
change in interest rates if the interest rate change is not uniform along the maturity spectrum.
INVERSE FLOATERS AND FLOATING RATE NOTES
Financial engineering can create derivatives from a non-derivative investment.One example is the
division of a conventional bond into an inverse ﬂoater and a ﬂoating rate note.An inverse ﬂoater
is a bond whose interest rate is inversely related to a market rate. For example an inverse ﬂoater
might pay a coupon rate of 10% p.a.minus LIBOR (LIBOR is a commonly used benchmark interest
rate that reﬂects market rates).The price of an inverse ﬂoater is extremely sensitive to interest rate
movements. Not only does the coupon rate fall when interest rates rise, but the rate at which the
coupons and principal value are discounted also rises.There are two effects of interest rate rises
that act to reduce the bond price. Conversely interest rate falls have two positive effects on the
bond price; the higher coupons are accompanied by a lower discount rate. So inverse ﬂoaters are
very sensitive to interest rate changes, in other words they have very long durations.
Inverse ﬂoaters are structured by dividing a conventional bond into an inverse ﬂoater and a
ﬂoating rate note. A ﬂoating rate note is a bond whose coupon rate moves in line with market
rates.For example the coupon rate on a ﬂoating rate note might be 2% p.a.plus LIBOR.Since the
coupon rate moves in the same direction as the rate of discount, effects of interest rate changes
tend to offset each other with the effect that there is little net effect on the bond price. Floating
rate notes exhibit low price volatility and hence short durations.
Suppose that a conventional bond has a coupon rate of 6% p.a. and LIBOR is 4% p.a.A bank
could buy £100 million of the conventional bond and divide it into £50 million of inverse ﬂoaters
and £50 million of ﬂoating rate notes.The inverse ﬂoaters might pay a coupon rate of 10% p.a.
minus LIBOR,whilst the ﬂoating rate notes pay 2% p.a.plus LIBOR.The annual coupon rates are
shown in Table 41.2.

It can be seen that the coupon rates always average 6% p.a., which is the coupon rate on the
conventional bond from which the inverse ﬂoater and the ﬂoating rate note are derived. LIBOR
interest rates above 10% p.a. are treated as if they were 10% p.a. since the coupon rate on the
inverse ﬂoater is not allowed to fall below 0% p.a.
The high duration of inverse ﬂoaters renders them useful for hedging long-term liabilities.
Falling interest rates increase the value of the liabilities,but that would be offset by the increase in
the value of the inverse ﬂoaters.Inverse ﬂoaters might be attractive to institutions with long-term
liabilities such as pension funds, annuity providers, and life assurance companies. Conversely
ﬂoating rate notes could be attractive to institutions with short-term liabilities,such as banks and
building societies.
BOND INDEX (TRACKER) FUNDS
Bond index funds attempt to construct portfolios that replicate the performance of a bond index.
The argument for index funds is based on the view that fund managers are unable to consistently
outperform indices.For example Blake et al. (1993) measured the performance of 223 bond funds
over 1986-1991 and compared them with index tracking portfolios. Most of the 223 funds
underperformed the index portfolios.The average amount of underperformance was slightly
higher than the charges on the funds (i.e. charges accounted for most of the underperformance).
The performance to be tracked is total return; which comprises coupons, capital gains (or
losses),and interest on reinvested coupons.Differences between the performance of an index and
that of an index tracking portfolio are referred to as tracking error.
Tracking error has three sources.First there is tracking error resulting from a mismatch between
the bonds in the portfolio and the bonds in the index. Second, there may be differences between
the bond prices used for calculating an index and those available to a portfolio manager.Third, a
portfolio manager faces transaction costs whereas the constructor of an index does not.
The ﬁrst two sources of deviation can be either advantageous or disadvantageous to a portfolio
manager.Transaction costs are always disadvantageous.There is a trade-off between tracking error
arising from mismatches and the error from transaction costs.Attempts to replicate precisely the
contents of an index may entail a large number of relatively small transactions.This is expensive
in terms of transaction costs.On the other hand,use of a smaller sample of bonds to represent an
index increases deviations arising from mismatches between the index and the index tracking
portfolio.Use of a small number of bonds,with infrequent rebalancing,reduces transaction costs
but the reduction in transaction costs incurs increased mismatch error.
Since it is unlikely that perfect replication of an index in terms of speciﬁc bonds and precise
proportions is practical in terms of transaction costs, a representative sample of bonds would
normally be used. One approach to obtaining a representative sample is the cell, or stratified
sampling, approach. Each cell contains its own combination of characteristics, and the portfolio
manager would ensure that all the important cells are reﬂected in the chosen sample.
For example the relevant characteristics might be duration (e.g. above five years versus
below ﬁve years), coupon (e.g. above 5% versus below 5%), and sector (e.g. government versus
corporate).This produces eight cells (one would be short duration, low coupon, government
and another would be long duration, low coupon, corporate, and so on).The portfolio manager
might attempt to hold at least one bond with the characteristics of each cell. The relative
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
776

importance of each cell in the index would be reﬂected in the value of bonds allocated to
the cell.
Bonds are removed from index calculations one year prior to maturity, since bonds with less
than a year to maturity cease to be regarded as bonds. So as bonds approach maturity they drop
out of bond indices.This entails the rebalancing of index tracking portfolios, and the associated
transaction costs.
An alternative form of passive management of bond portfolios is the buy-and-hold strategy.The
investor buys a portfolio of bonds that satisfy the investor’s needs,and holds those bonds until they
mature. Investors do not sell their bonds at any stage.An attraction of such a strategy is that the
investor need not be concerned about the liquidity of the bonds held. Bonds that lack liquidity,
that is bonds that may be difﬁcult to sell, tend to have higher yields to compensate for the poor
liquidity.This is one reason why corporate bonds have higher yields than government bonds.If an
investor is not concerned about the poor liquidity, the additional yield is a free bonus.Another
advantage of a buy-and-hold strategy is that it largely avoids transaction costs such as brokers’
commissions.The only transaction costs are those of the initial purchases;the costs of subsequent
selling and buying are avoided.
There are hybrid funds that have characteristics of both index funds and actively managed
funds.Enhanced index funds allow limited deviation from the index in an attempt to outperform
the index.
Closet trackers are actively managed funds that use part of the fund to track an index.Managers
of closet trackers seek to avoid the risk of substantially underperforming the index,and of thereby
being low in league tables of fund managers.
INTEREST RATE ANTICIPATION
If it were possible to forecast interest rates, active management of bond portfolios could
be proﬁtable. If interest rates were expected to fall, portfolio duration should be increased in
order to enhance the gains from such a fall.If interest rates were expected to rise,portfolio duration
should be reduced in order to reduce the prospective price falls. It needs to be remembered
that the investor does not simply need to be able to forecast interest rates, but needs to forecast
more accurately than other investors. Existing bond prices would reﬂect market expectations of
future interest rates.The rates at which future cash ﬂows are discounted to arrive at bond prices
are based on market expectations of future interest rates.The success of active fund management
based on forecasting depends upon accurately identifying circumstances in which the market
forecasts are wrong (and upon being able to do better). Bond fund managers who adopt such a
strategy would use highly liquid bonds, such as government bonds, so as to be able easily to
undertake the buying and selling required to adjust portfolio duration quickly.Speed is important
to such a strategy.Any superior forecasting ability needs to be acted upon before other investors
correct their forecasts.
The question arises as to whether it is possible to forecast interest rates.The Wall Street Journal
publishes the interest rate forecasts of prominent analysts.The surveys appear twice a year and are
for six months ahead. Kolb and Stekler (1996) analysed 17 of the surveys.They found that there
was usually a consensus amongst forecasters,but also found that the forecasts were not signiﬁcantly
better than a forecast of no change (i.e. using current rates as the forecast rates).
DURATION AND RISK
777

The conclusions of the Kolb and Stekler (1996) study,that professional forecasters do no better
than someone who simply assumes that interest rates will remain unchanged, is probably
representative of the research on the effectiveness of forecasting (Stephenson 1997). So there
should be doubt about the value of interest rate anticipation as an investment strategy. If it is not
possible to forecast interest rate changes, it is not possible to use forecasts to make proﬁts from
bond portfolio management.
CONCLUSION
The two characteristics of investments most frequently considered are expected return and
risk. In the case of shares, beta is the most frequently used measure of risk. In the case of bonds,
it is duration.
Bonds are used in institutional investment portfolios not only as means of accumulating wealth
but also as means of funding annuity payments. Since it is possible to obtain reasonably reliable
estimates of the duration of prospective annuity payment streams as well as the duration of bond
portfolios,it is possible to match the duration of the bond portfolio with the duration of the annuity
payments. Such duration matching, or immunisation, is very useful for annuity and pension
providers since it provides a high degree of protection against interest rate risk.
Duration is important for the structuring of bond index tracker funds. If such a fund were
to be constructed using stratiﬁed sampling based on a cell structure, one of the characteristics
of a cell would be duration. Other characteristics might be redemption yield and credit rating.
There would be a cell for each combination of characteristics (e.g.high duration,low redemption
yield,high credit rating),and the portfolio would contain an appropriately weighted combination
of cells.
Chapter 43 on bond futures explains how futures can be used for the management of portfolio
duration. If an annuity fund, index tracker fund, or other bond fund exhibits a duration that
differs from the optimum it is possible to use bond futures to adjust the portfolio duration to
the desired value.

Bond price convexity
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The problem of convexity.
2. The value of convexity.
3. The construction of bond portfolios.
4. Callable bonds.
THE PROBLEM OF CONVEXITY
Money duration merely provides an approximation to the relationship between yield changes and
bond price movements.This is illustrated by Figure 42.1. Figure 42.1 shows the price/yield
relationship for a bond together with a straight line representing money duration (i.e.price value
of a basis point, PVBP).
It can be seen from Figure 42.1 that for small changes in yield, such as R0 to R1 or R0 to R2 ,
the price change indicated by money duration along the straight line is a fair approximation to the
actual price change as shown by the curved price/yield relationship. However for large yield
changes, such as R0 to R3 or R0 to R4, the money duration line provides a poor estimate of the
actual price change. Money duration underestimates price rises and overestimates falls. In both
cases the new bond price is underestimated.The inaccuracies arise because money duration fails
to take account of the convexity (curvature) of the actual price/yield relationship of a bond.
EXERCISE 42.1
It is 24 November 1992.Treasury 12% 1994 (which has just paid a six-monthly coupon) has
a maturity date of 23 May 1994.The interest rate is 8% p.a. for all maturities up to 1.5 years.
Estimate (a) the Macaulay’s duration, and (b) the modiﬁed duration, of the gilt.

What capital gain or loss would arise from a holding of £1 million nominal of this gilt in the event
of a 1/4% p.a.fall in interest rates? Comment on the accuracy of this estimate of capital gain or loss.

It is to be noted that £6/(1.03875)  £6/(1.03875)2  £106/(1.03875)3  £5.7762 
£5.5607  £94.5742  £105.9111.(8%  0.25%  7.75%.7.75/2  3.875%.) Hence,
according to the discount model, the new value of the bonds should be £1,059,111. So the
modiﬁed duration approach predicts the new value of the bonds quite accurately  the error
is less than £23.
Modiﬁed duration does not provide a precisely accurate answer since it assumes a linear
price-yield relationship, whereas the relationship is actually convex.
EXERCISE 42.2
A bond has just paid a six-monthly coupon of £4.There are four more coupons to be paid by
maturity.How accurate is modiﬁed duration for the purpose of estimating the effect of a (a) 0.2%

are initially 2% p.a. Comment on the results of the calculations.

(a) With a redemption yield of 2% p.a., the fair price of the bond would be:

(0.009 is based on a six-month interest rate of 2%  0.2%  1.8% p.a., i.e. 0.9% per six-

The estimate based on modiﬁed duration is accurate.
(b) A fall in the redemption yield of 1% implies an estimated price rise of:
 1.875   1%  1.875%
Therefore modiﬁed duration indicates a new price of £111.70  1.01875  £113.79.
The dividend discount model shows a new price of:
£4/(1.005)  £4/(1.005)2  £4/(1.005)3 £104/(1.005)4  £3.98  £3.96  £3.94
 £101.95  £113.83.
(0.005 is based on a six-month interest rate of 2%  1%  1% p.a., i.e. 0.5% per six-
month period.)
Modiﬁed duration underestimates the extent of the bond price rise when the interest rate
(redemption yield) change is large.This error arises because of convexity.
THE VALUE OF CONVEXITY
Two bonds with identical durations, prices, and yields may have different convexities. In Figure
42.2 the curve A shows the price/yield relationship for bond A, and curve B does so for bond B.
It can be seen that bond B has greater convexity (curvature) than bond A.This gives bond B an
advantage over bond A. Changes in yield from R0, in either direction, raise the price of B relative
to that of A.This renders B preferable to A,especially if high volatility is expected.This should entail

B selling at a higher price, and hence lower yield, compared with A. It is unlikely that a situation
in which the bonds have identical prices and yields will persist.
CONSTRUCTION OF BOND PORTFOLIOS
The construction of a bond portfolio is frequently based on taking a view with respect to interest
rates.If interest rates are expected to fall,so that bond prices are expected to rise,a portfolio with
a relatively high duration would be constructed. Conversely, an expectation of a rise in interest
rates would entail a portfolio with low duration so that potential losses are reduced.
It is not just duration that a bond portfolio manager needs to be concerned with. Convexity
has value in that it leads to higher bond prices following interest rate movements,when compared
with an investment with zero convexity. High convexity bonds provide this beneﬁt to a greater
extent than low convexity bonds.The beneﬁts of convexity are greater when interest rate changes
are relatively large.This implies that the portfolio manager needs to consider the prospective size
of interest rate movement as well as the direction.
A bond with high convexity will tend to have a relatively low redemption yield.The advantage
bestowed by high convexity would be offset by a lower prospective yield.If interest rate movements
are small, the gains from convexity would not compensate for the low yield. So if a portfolio
manager expects a small interest rate change, bonds with low convexity should be chosen. If the
expectation is that there will be a substantial interest rate movement,high convexity bonds should
be chosen.
Convexity is greatest for low coupon, long maturity, and low-redemption-yield bonds (i.e.
high duration bonds).Convexity can be calculated and combined with measures of duration when
evaluating the potential effects of interest rate changes on bond prices.Since measures of duration
are accurate only for very small changes in interest rates,a convexity correction is required in the
case of large interest rate movements.To estimate the effects of relatively large interest rate changes
on bond prices, it is necessary to combine an estimate of convexity with an estimate of duration.
CALLABLE BONDS
Some corporate bonds are callable.This means that the issuer has the right to repurchase the bonds
at a predetermined price (the issuer has a call option on the bonds).A rise in the bond price that
renders the repurchase desirable would be brought about by a fall in market interest rates or an
improvement in the credit rating of the bonds. Under these circumstances the issuer could
repurchase the bonds and issue new bonds at a lower coupon rate.The issuer would choose to
repurchase since that would allow for a reduction in ﬁnancing costs. Bonds with a relatively high
coupon could be repurchased with money raised from the sale of bonds with a lower coupon.The
issuer thereby reduces coupon payments.
The predetermined price at which the issuer has the right to repurchase puts an upper limit on
the value of the bonds.No one would pay a higher price knowing that that they could be forced to
sell at the predetermined price.The price/yield relationship for a callable bond has an upper limit
to the price, as shown in Figure 42.3.The maximum price is depicted as Pmax.
An implication of the upper limit to the price is that, around point X, the convexity turns into
concavity.Another implication is that the coupon rate on a callable bond will be higher than the
BOND PRICE CONVEXITY
783

coupon rate on a bond without the call feature. If investors face a ceiling on their prospective
capital gains,they would require an enhanced coupon yield in compensation.Effectively investors
are providing the issuer with a call option.The investors would require payment for the call option.
The payment to the investors takes the form of increased coupons.
CONCLUSION
The relative certainty of bond cash ﬂows makes it worthwhile to make estimates that would be
pointless in the case of shares, whose future cash ﬂows are much less certain. One such estimate
is duration, another is convexity.
Duration provides a relationship between redemption yields and bond prices;a relationship that
permits estimates of the effects of redemption yield changes on bond prices. However the
relationship provided by duration measures is a linear relationship whereas the actual relationship
is a curve rather than a straight line.The straight line approximates the curve reasonably well when
redemption yield changes are very small.For larger changes in redemption yield a reliable estimate
of bond price change requires a measure of convexity to be combined with the measure of duration.
The effect of a redemption yield change on a bond price is a combination of the effects that operate
via duration with the effects that operate through convexity.
The degree of detail offered by convexity estimates may seem excessive. However an
institutional investor might hold more than £100 million in a particular bond issue. Apparent
details translate into substantial monetary values when investments are very large.

Chapter 43
Bond futures
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The nature of government bond futures.
2. The use of government bond futures to hedge, or immunise, bond portfolios.
3. The role of arbitrage in the determination of bond futures prices.
4. Implied repos.
5. Basis risk as a source of hedge imperfection.
6. The use of bond futures to simulate (synthesise) bond portfolios.
7. Credit derivatives.
BONDS
Bonds are issued in a wide variety of forms. However, most government bonds conform to a
conventional format.The conventional government bond (gilt in the UK):
1.
pays a ﬁxed coupon per period (usually 6 months);
2.
has a deﬁnite redemption date;
3.
has a market price expressed as a sum per £100 of nominal value.
A conventional gilt pays a ﬁxed sum of money, known as the coupon, every six months. It has a
deﬁnite redemption date on which the government is obliged to pay the nominal value of the bond
to its owner.Its market price is expressed in relation to its nominal value,for example pounds per
£100 nominal (so a market price of £96 means that £96 must be paid for every £100 to be repaid
at redemption).
FUTURES CONTRACTS
Government bond futures are commitments to buy or sell government bonds during speciﬁed
future months. A limited number of bonds are eligible for delivery in fulﬁlment of a futures

BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
786
contract, and the seller has the choice as to the speciﬁc bond to be delivered. Contracts are
commonly not held until maturity but are closed out by means of the holder taking out an opposite
contract;for example a buyer can close out by selling bond futures in an amount and for a delivery
month corresponding to those of the contracts previously bought. Daily cash ﬂows (by way of
marking-to-market variation margin) reﬂect the change in futures prices between the dates of
buying and selling.
HEDGING THE VALUE OF A PORTFOLIO
A portfolio manager may fear an increase in long-term interest rates, an occurrence that would
reduce the prices of bonds held in a portfolio.The manager could attempt to avoid this effect on
the value of the portfolio by taking a position in futures that would provide an offsetting gain from
a fall in bond prices.To achieve this, futures contracts would be sold.A fall in bond prices should
be accompanied by a fall in the prices of bond futures. If a loss were made from a decline in the
value of bonds,the portfolio manager would be compensated with proﬁts from the futures position.
The fund manager would be able to close out by buying bond futures at a price lower than that at
which they were sold.
This process is illustrated by Example 43.1, in which a fund manager hedges with futures.The
Gilt futures contract has a nominal value of £100,000 and the prices of contracts are expressed as
pounds per £100 nominal value.The portfolio manager has bonds worth £1,000,000 on 2 January
and is anxious about the possibility that interest rates might rise thereby reducing the value of the
bonds.

The long-term interest rate is 5% p.a. A £1,000,000 bond portfolio is vulnerable to an increase
in long-term interest rates.
The fund manager sells ten Gilt futures contracts. The futures price is £115.
15 February
The long-term interest rate has risen to 6% p.a. Correspondingly, the value of the bond portfolio
has fallen to £850,000.
The fund manager closes out by buying ten Gilt futures contracts. The price of the contracts has
fallen to £100.
There is a loss of £150,000 in the value of the bond portfolio.
There is a proﬁt of £150,000 from the futures position [(115100)  £1,000  10 contracts].

In Example 43.1 the hedge was perfect.The proﬁt on the futures exactly matched the loss on the
portfolio. Perfect hedges are very unlikely.This is partly because spot and futures markets do not
move perfectly in line with each other.
Some of the mismatch between portfolio and futures price movements can be removed by
ascertaining the appropriate ratio of futures value to portfolio value. In Example 43.1, the ratio
was treated as 1.This is not usually the case.The hedger would be able to ascertain the appropriate
number of futures contracts required before selling the contracts.The ratio of the nominal value
of futures contracts required to the nominal value of assets or liabilities to be hedged is known as
the hedge ratio.
Even with the correct hedge ratio, hedging may not be perfect. Imperfections will still arise if
the cash market and futures interest rates do not change to the same extent.However the difference
between cash and futures interest rates ﬂuctuates less than cash market rates and hence an imperfect
hedge is better than no hedge.Also it is unlikely that a whole number of futures contracts will
exactly match the exposure of the portfolio to be hedged (it is not possible to trade in fractions of
contracts).
EXERCISE 43.1
(a) An institutional investor holds undated bonds with a value of £10,000,000 when long-term
interest rates are 6% p.a.How can the investor use government bond futures to hedge against
the possibility of a rise in interest rates (recall that there is an inverse relationship between
bond prices and interest rates)?
(b) If long-term interest rates rise to 7.5% p.a., what happens to the value of the bonds? How
much futures proﬁt is needed to keep the value at £10,000,000?
(c) If the futures price is initially £100 and falls to £82, how effective is the hedge?
Answers
(a) If the value of the bond holding is to be maintained at £10,000,000, any fall in the value of
the bonds must be matched by a proﬁt on futures.A proﬁt from futures, in the event of an
interest rate rise, requires the sale of futures.An increase in interest rates will reduce bond
prices and hence the prices of bond futures.A proﬁt from a fall in the prices of bond futures
requires the sale of futures contracts.
(b) If long-term interest rates rise to 7.5%, the value of the bonds would fall to £8,000,000.
Since for undated bonds the fair price equals the coupon divided by the interest rate,a rise in
interest rates from 6% p.a.to 7.5% p.a.entails a fall in value from £10,000,000 to £8,000,000;
£10,000,000  0.06  £8,000,000  0.075  the unchanged value of coupons.A futures
proﬁt of £2,000,000 is required.
(c) If the futures price were initially £100 and falls to £82,and if the £10,000,000 were matched
by futures contracts (i.e.futures with a nominal value of £10,000,000 were sold),the futures

proﬁt would be [(10082)/100]  £10,000,000  £1,800,000.The hedge efﬁciency would
be £1,800,000/£2,000,000  0.9, i.e. 90%.
EXERCISE 43.2
(a) An investment trust intends to issue long-term bonds in order to borrow £10,000,000 when
long-term interest rates are 6% p.a. How can the investment trust use government bond
futures to hedge against the possibility of a rise in interest rates before the bonds are issued?
(b) If long-term interest rates rise to 7.5% p.a., what happens to the borrowing cost of the debt
of part (a)? How much futures proﬁt is needed to keep the borrowing cost at £600,000 p.a.?
What further advantage do the futures provide?
(c) If the futures price is initially £100 and falls to £82, how effective is the hedge?
Answers
(a) The expected borrowing cost is £10,000,000  0.06  £600,000. If the borrowing
cost is to be maintained at £600,000, any increase in interest rates must be matched by a
fall in the sum to be borrowed.The sum to be borrowed can be reduced by making proﬁts
on government bond futures. Proﬁts from futures, in the event of an interest rate rise,
require the sale of futures.An increase in interest rates will reduce bond prices and hence
the prices of bond futures.The futures contracts are then closed out by buying futures.
Since the futures buying price is less than the futures selling price, a proﬁt is made from
the futures.
(b) If long-term interest rates rise to 7.5%, the cost of borrowing £10,000,000 would rise to
£750,000 p.a.A futures proﬁt of £2,000,000 is required since this would reduce the sum to
be borrowed to £8,000,000.The borrowing cost would then be returned to £600,000 p.a.
(£8,000,000  0.075  £600,000).
The futures proﬁt reduces the sum to be repaid from £10,000,000 to £8,000,000.
(c) If the futures price were initially £100 and falls to £82, and if futures with a nominal value of
£10,000,000 were sold, the futures proﬁt would be [(10082)/100]  £10,000,000 
£1,800,000.This could be used to reduce the borrowing requirement.
The borrowing requirement is reduced to £10,000,000  £1,800,000  £8,200,000.At
an interest rate of 7.5% p.a., the annual borrowing cost becomes £8,200,000  0.075 
£615,000.The hedge reduces the borrowing cost from £750,000 to £615,000, but does not
completely reduce it to the original £600,000. The hedge efﬁciency is (750,000 
615,000)/(750,000  600,000)  135/150  0.9, i.e. 90%.

Delivery, Price Factors, Invoice Amounts, and the Cheapest-to-Deliver Bond
A futures contract will have a speciﬁc maturity month (alternatively known as the delivery month).
Typically the months in which government bonds may be delivered in settlement of futures
contracts are March,June,September,and December (i.e.traders choose between these maturity
months when buying or selling futures contracts). If a futures contract were held until maturity,
the seller chooses which bond to deliver.The seller also chooses the day of the month on which
delivery takes place (although for some futures contracts there is no choice as to delivery date).
The buyer must accept the bond and date chosen by the seller.
The coupon yield of a bond is the coupon (the total of the coupon payments during a year)
divided by the bond price.If the rate of coupon yield on the bond exceeds the interest rate on funds
borrowed to ﬁnance the purchase of the bond,the bond will be delivered at the end of the month
so as to maximise the beneﬁt from the relatively high coupon yield.If the coupon yield is less than
the ﬁnancing cost, the bond would be delivered at the beginning of the month so as to avoid the
net cost of holding the bond during the month.
The futures exchange speciﬁes which bonds are eligible for delivery. Every deliverable bond
has a price factor. Price factors are of considerable signiﬁcance for users of bond futures. UK gilt
futures contracts each have a nominal value of £100,000. Likewise, the gilts delivered when a
contract matures must amount to £100,000 in nominal value (the nominal value of a bond is the
sum to be repaid at redemption).Gilts may,however,have differing market values despite identical
nominal values. A £100,000 bond issued when the market rate was 12% p.a. would provide a
coupon of £12,000 p.a.,whereas a £100,000 bond issued at a rate of 5% p.a.would yield £5,000
p.a.The market value of bonds will vary according to the size of the coupon yield.A bond yielding
£12,000 p.a. is worth more than one with a coupon of just £5,000 p.a.A seller delivering a high
coupon gilt would expect to receive more money than if a lower coupon gilt were delivered.
To ensure that this happens, price factors are used in the calculation of the sums for which buyers
are invoiced.
The invoice amount is the sum that the buyer of a futures contract must pay to the seller if the
contract is taken to delivery of the bond.The futures price upon which the invoice amount is based
might be referred to as the settlement price, which is the market price of futures contracts at a
speciﬁc point in time prior to delivery.The principal invoice amount is the settlement price
multiplied by the price factor and by the nominal value of the futures contract (divided by 100 since
the settlement price is quoted per £100 nominal value).The sum for which the buyer is invoiced
is equal to the principal invoice amount plus accrued interest on the bond.The resulting invoice
amounts would normally differ from the market values of the bonds.
The seller chooses which bond to deliver in fulﬁlment of the contract. It is in the interests of
the seller to deliver the bond whose invoice amount exceeds the market price by the largest margin
(or whose invoice amount falls short of the market price by the smallest margin).This is the
cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) bond.
Hedge Ratios
The hedger must decide upon the number of contracts required to accomplish the desired hedge.
This calculation is simplest when hedging the cheapest-to-deliver bond:

Number of contracts 
 Price factor
The multiplication by the price factor is necessary to adjust for the price difference between
the cheapest-to-deliver bond and the notional bond on which the futures is based.A high coupon
yield bond has a higher value to be hedged than a low coupon yield bond and will require a
correspondingly larger number of futures contracts for the hedging (this difference will be greater
the more distant are the maturity dates of the bonds).
Suppose that for the December 2006 contract month the cheapest-to-deliver gilt was the
Exchequer 12% 2024, whose price factor was 1.2. If the hedger wished to hedge £10,000,000
nominal of this gilt, the requisite number of contracts would have been calculated thus:
Number of contracts 
 1.2  120
The hedger would have used 120 gilt futures contracts to hedge the position.
When hedging bonds other than the cheapest-to-deliver,account must be taken of the relative
volatility of the bonds.Volatility can be measured in terms of the money value of a (for example)
1% yield change per £100 nominal value. If the bond being hedged is more volatile than the
cheapest-to-deliver,a correspondingly greater number of futures contracts would be required for
the hedge (and vice versa for less volatile bonds). In this way, the larger price movements of
relatively volatile bonds are covered.The formula is as follows:
Number of contracts 
 Price factor of 
Relative 
cheapest-to-deliver  volatility
Thus, if the money value of a 1% redemption yield change per £100 nominal were £5.00 for
the gilt being hedged and £3.50 for the cheapest-to-deliver gilt, then the number of contracts
necessary to hedge £10,000,000 nominal of the gilts, in an example parallel to the previous one,
would be as follows:
Number of contracts 
 1.2 
 171.43
The appropriate number of gilt futures contracts is 171.A large number of futures contracts
are necessary so that the proﬁts/losses on futures succeed in offsetting the relatively large
losses/proﬁts on the gilt being hedged.Without adjusting for relative volatility, only £3.50 of
every £5 price change would be offset.
The deﬁnition of volatility used above is known as perturbation (or money duration).This
uses the impact of a speciﬁc interest rate change (e.g. 1%) on the prices of the bond to be hedged
and the cheapest-to-deliver.A frequently used interest rate (or redemption yield) change is the
basis point (0.01%), in which case perturbation is alternatively referred to as the price value
of a basis point (or PVBP).The measurement of volatility is illustrated in Chapter 41 on duration
and risk.

Perturbation or PVBP is estimated as:

where duration is Macaulay’s duration and the redemption yield is the redemption yield per
coupon period (i.e. annual redemption yield divided by the number of coupons per year).

where FB is the price factor of the cheapest-to-deliver bond.
Fixed interest securities other than government bonds can be hedged with government bond
futures; however, it must be borne in mind that the more dissimilar are the cheapest-to-deliver
bond and the instrument being hedged, the less effective is the hedge likely to be.This is the
problem of cross-hedging. Increasing difference between the instrument being hedged, and the
instrument on which the futures are based,is associated with increasing imperfection of the hedge.
EXERCISE 43.3
A fund manager has a portfolio of gilts with a nominal value of £5 million.The average price of
the gilts in the portfolio is £80.The duration of the portfolio is 12 years.The cheapest-to-deliver
gilt has a price of £130,a price factor of 1.2,and a duration of 10 years.Ten- and 12-year redemption
yields are both 8% p.a. How could the fund manager approximately halve the volatility of the

Since futures contracts are indivisible 22 would be sold.
Bond Portfolio Immunisation
Sometimes bond portfolios are held for the purpose of funding a known series of future cash ﬂows.
Interest rate risk on such bond portfolios may be reduced by the following means:
1.
Dedicated portfolios.The prospective cash ﬂows from the bonds held correspond to the future
cash ﬂow requirements in both amount and timing. For example the future payments to
pensioners from an annuity fund might be synchronised with the coupon and redemption
receipts from the bonds that constitute the fund. Such a dedicated portfolio is difﬁcult to
construct.
2.
Maturity matching. The maturities of the bonds in the portfolio match the times at
which cash ﬂows will be required.This avoids the price risk from interest rate changes
but is subject to reinvestment risk (the rate of interest on reinvested coupon receipts is
uncertain).
3.
Duration matching.The Macaulay’s duration of the bonds matches the time at which a cash ﬂow
will be required. Bond price changes tend to offset variations in returns from reinvested
coupons. So both the bond price risk of interest rate changes and the reinvestment risk
are substantially reduced.Bond futures can be used to adjust portfolio duration to the desired
level.Any discrepancy between the durations of the liabilities (prospective cash outﬂows) and
the durations of the bonds can be removed by taking an offsetting position in bond futures.
A difference between the average duration of the liabilities and the average duration of the
bonds in the portfolio can be offset by government bond futures. Since government bond
futures have durations,portfolio duration can be increased by buying futures or decreased by
selling them.
A bond portfolio manager using duration-based immunisation needs to be aware of the need for
frequent rebalancing (restructuring the portfolio).Frequent rebalancing is necessary ﬁrst because
duration declines more slowly than term to maturity.The passage of a year will reduce duration
by less than a year. Duration would then exceed the investment horizon. Second, the price-yield
relationship for bonds is convex. So duration changes as interest rates change.When portfolio
duration is matched to the average duration of liabilities,rather than a single investment horizon,
rebalancing remains necessary since the duration of the portfolio is unlikely to move precisely in
line with the average duration of the liabilities.

Adjusting Portfolio Duration with Futures
The volatility of a bond portfolio may be measured as the change in portfolio value arising from a
basis point, 0.01% p.a., change in yield (i.e. the price value of a basis point). Suppose that a
portfolio of bonds has a Macaulay’s duration of 15 years, a redemption yield of 4% p.a., a market
value of £10,000,000, and that coupons are paid annually (and remembering that a basis point as
a decimal is 0.0001). Portfolio volatility can be estimated as:
 £10,000,000  0.0001  £14,423
An interest rate change of 0.01% p.a.is expected to result in the value of the portfolio changing
by £14,423.This calculation is based on:
Modiﬁed Duration  Bond Price  Interest Rate Change,
which comes from the equation for money duration (price value of a basis point) described in
Chapter 41 on duration and risk.
If the portfolio manager seeks to reduce the portfolio duration to ten years,the desired volatility
(i.e. the PVBP, price value of a basis point) is given by:
 £10,000,000  0.0001  £9,615
Portfolio volatility needs to be reduced by £14,423  £9,615  £4,808.
The next step is to measure the volatility of a futures contract.This entails calculating the
volatility of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and then dividing by its price factor. Suppose that the
cheapest-to-deliver bond has a Macaulay’s duration of 12 years, a redemption yield of 4% p.a., a
price of £110 (£110,000 per £100,000 nominal),and pays an annual coupon.The volatility of the
cheapest-to-deliver bond is:
 £110,000  0.0001  £126.92
If the cheapest-to-deliver bond has a price factor of 0.9875, the volatility of a futures contract
is estimated as £126.92/0.9875  £128.52.In order to reduce the portfolio volatility by £4,808
it is necessary to sell £4,808/£128.52  37.4 futures contracts. Since futures contracts are
indivisible, either 37 or 38 contracts would be sold.
DETERMINATION OF BOND FUTURES PRICES
Arbitrage Pricing
As with other assets that can be carried during the life of a futures contract, bond futures prices
tend to be determined by cash-and-carry arbitrage. Long cash-and-carry involves buying bonds
while simultaneously selling bond futures. Short cash-and-carry (in its pure form) involves
borrowing bonds and selling them while buying futures.The futures price should be such that no
12

1.04
10

1.04
15

1.04

proﬁt is available from cash-and-carry arbitrage.The fair futures price is a price that precludes any
proﬁt from arbitrage.
When arbitrage involves buying bonds,pure arbitrage entails borrowing money in order to buy
the bonds. Interest must be paid on the borrowed money, and this is referred to as the ﬁnancing
cost of holding the bonds. For no arbitrage proﬁts to be available from long cash-and-carry, the
ﬁnancing cost of holding bonds should be matched by the returns from holding the bonds.The
returns would be in the form of coupon receipts plus capital gains (or losses) guaranteed by the
futures price relative to the spot price of the bonds.If the ﬁnancing cost exceeds the coupon yield,
there will be a net cost of holding the bonds.The absence of proﬁt/loss requires a capital gain that
matches this net cost.The capital gain comes from an excess of the futures price over the spot price
(i.e. there should be a futures premium over spot).The futures price should guarantee a selling
price of bonds that exceeds the buying price by the amount of capital gain required to match the
net cost of holding the bonds (the net cost of carry). If the ﬁnancing cost is less than the coupon
receipts, a futures discount, providing a capital loss, should exist.
For long cash-and-carry, when there are no coupons before the futures delivery date:
S(1  rt)  F
The interest rate is r and the time to the futures maturity (delivery) date in years is t.The cost
of buying the bonds (S), plus the ﬁnancing cost (S  rt), should equal the sum receivable from
selling against the futures (F).If the futures price is higher,there is an arbitrage proﬁt from buying
bonds and simultaneously selling futures.
For long cash-and-carry, when there are coupons before the futures delivery date:
S(1  rt)  D  F
The sum to be paid by the delivery date,S(1  rt),minus what is received,D (the future value
of the coupons),should match the sum receivable from selling against the futures.The future value
of coupons equals the value of the coupons plus interest on that value between the coupon payment
date and the futures delivery date.
By subtracting S from both sides it can be seen that the futures premium (or discount) relative
to spot matches the difference between the ﬁnancing cost and coupon yield.Thus:
FS  S(1  rt)  S  D
FS  S  (S  rt)  S  D
FS  (S  rt) D
It has been implicitly assumed that the bond has a price factor of 1;if this is not the case (and it
hardly ever will be), F in the equations needs to be divided by the price factor. More precisely, F
net of accrued interest should be divided by the price factor of the bond in order to ascertain the
futures price. Since S and F relate to sums actually paid and received, they must include accrued
interest (the rights to coupon payment between the last coupon payment date and the date on which
the bond is bought and sold).The price factor involved would be that of the bond used,which would
normally be the cheapest-to-deliver. Since the bond normally used in cash-and-carry arbitrage
would be the cheapest-to-deliver, the behaviour of the futures price would tend to relate closely
to the behaviour of the price of the cheapest-to-deliver bond.

EXERCISE 43.4
It is 30 September 1997 and Exchequer 9% 2007 has just paid a coupon.The price of this gilt is
£123 and its price factor is 1.The three-month interest rate is 7% p.a. If the December futures
contract is held to maturity,what is the most likely date on which delivery into the futures contract
would occur? What is the fair futures price on 30 September?
Answers
The current coupon yield on the gilt is (9/123)  100  7.32% p.a. So at current values the
coupon yield exceeds the interest rate (ﬁnancing cost) and so it seems likely that any delivery
would be made at the end of December. (The seller of the futures chooses on which day of the
maturity month to deliver the bond and there is a net gain to the seller from holding the bond during
December.)
The cost of buying and holding the gilt until the end of December would be [£123  (1.0175)]
 £125.15,from which accrued interest should be subtracted.The net cost of buying and holding
the gilt is thus £125.15  £2.25  £122.9, which is the fair futures price.
(The ﬁnancing rate of 1.75% is based on 7%  0.25 where 30 September to 31 December is
treated as 0.25 years.The accrued interest is based on £9  0.25 since a 9% gilt pays coupons of
£9 per year.)
EXERCISE 43.5
It is 30 June 1997 and Treasury 10% 2007 has just paid a coupon.The price of this gilt is £130 and
its price factor is 1.06.The six-month interest rate is 7% p.a. If the December futures contract is
held to maturity, what is the most likely date on which delivery into the futures contract would
occur? What is the fair futures price on 30 June?
Answers
The current coupon yield on the gilt is (10/130)  100  7.69% p.a. So at current values the
coupon yield exceeds the interest rate (ﬁnancing cost) and so it seems likely that any delivery
would be made at the end of December.
The cost of buying and holding the gilt until the end of December would be [£130  (1.035)]
 £5  £129.55.(£5 is accrued interest,which in this case would be received as a coupon payment
towards the end of December.)
£129.55 corresponds to a futures price of £129.55/1.06  £122.22,which is the fair futures
price.

Transaction costs have been ignored here.If bid-offer spreads are allowed for in both the bond
market and the interest rates, the result is a no-arbitrage band of futures prices rather than the
unique fair futures price (the fair futures price is the price that would prevail in the absence of
transaction costs).The no-arbitrage band can be described by the expression:
SB(1  rBt)  D ≤F ≤S0(1  r0t)  D
where SB is the spot bid price (dirty price,i.e.inclusive of accrued interest),S0 is the spot offer
price (dirty price), rB is the interest rate for period t (bid rate), r0 is the interest rate for period t
(offer rate), t is the time to maturity of the futures contract (in years), D is the future value of
coupons (relating to ex-coupon dates prior to the futures maturity date),and F is the futures price
(multiplied by the price factor and inclusive of accrued interest).
The left of the equation is based on short cash-and-carry arbitrage,which entails selling bonds
(at the bid price) and depositing the proceeds (at the bid rate).The right of the equation is based
on long cash-and-carry arbitrage, which involves buying bonds (at the offer price) with money
borrowed at the offer rate.
Arbitrage should operate to keep the futures price within the no-arbitrage band. If the
futures price rises above the band, long cash-and-carry arbitrage would tend to bring it back
into the band.This would involve bonds being bought (the consequent upward pressure on bond
prices will tend to raise the band) and futures being sold (thereby pushing futures prices down
into the band). If the futures price falls below the band, the underpriced futures should be
bought and the bonds sold; in other words, short cash-and-carry arbitrage should (at least
in principle) take place. Short cash-and-carry arbitrage will tend to lower the no-arbitrage
band (via reducing the spot bond price) and will raise the futures price until it is again within
the band.
Futures prices do not slavishly follow spot prices.Within the no-arbitrage band futures prices
can vary independently of spot prices. Hedging, and speculation based on expectations of
movements in futures prices, can move the futures price within the no-arbitrage band.
Futures prices can lead spot prices via cash-and-carry transactions. Hedging and speculation,
inﬂuenced by expectations, can push futures prices out of the no-arbitrage band.The resulting
arbitrage moves spot prices.In this way trading in futures can cause changes in spot prices that are
led by the changes in futures prices.
The Role of Implicit Options
The seller of bond futures contracts has choices relating to when to deliver during the delivery
month and which bond to deliver. In effect this gives the futures seller options, and the futures
buyer has provided them.The seller of futures must, in some way, pay for the options and the
buyer be paid.This is accomplished by a reduction in the bond futures price below the level that
would otherwise pertain.In this way,at delivery the futures seller receives a sum which is reduced
by the value of the option premiums, while the futures buyer receives payment for the options
in the form of having to pay less for the bonds when they are delivered upon maturity of the futures
contract.

Implied Repos
Buying bonds and simultaneously selling futures constitutes an investment whose maturity is the
same as that of the futures contract.The implied repo is the rate of return on that investment.The
return comprises coupon receipts plus the capital gain (or loss) guaranteed by the futures price.
The investment is equivalent to a bank deposit for the period to maturity of the futures in that there
is an initial outﬂow of cash and a subsequent receipt of cash.The implied repo rate is effectively
the interest rate.
Selling bonds and buying futures constitutes borrowing for the period to the futures maturity
date, at the implied repo rate. (Repo is an abbreviation of sale and repurchase: selling bonds and
buying futures is a form of sale and repurchase arrangement.) There is a source of risk, to the
borrower,in the use of the construction for borrowing in that there is no certainty as to which bond
will be delivered at maturity,and no certainty as to the date on which delivery will take place (these
being at the discretion of the seller of futures contracts).The procedure is equivalent to borrowing
since there is an initial receipt of cash and a subsequent payment of cash.The implied repo rate is
effectively the interest rate.The provision of bonds gives the lender security (the bonds act as
collateral) so the interest rate should be a risk-free rate.
EXERCISE 43.6
It is 31 March 1998.The cheapest-to-deliver bond is Treasury 2015 8%. Bond futures for June
maturity are priced at £102.The price factor of Treasury 2015 8% is 0.89.Two- and three- month
interest rates are 7.5% p.a.Treasury 2015 8% has just paid a coupon and is priced at £91.
(a) On what date is delivery into the futures contract likely to occur?
(b) What is the implied repo to that date?
(c) How could an arbitrage proﬁt be made?
Answers
(a) The coupon yield on the bond is £8/£91  8.79% p.a. which exceeds the ﬁnancing cost of
7.5% p.a.The bond will be delivered on the last business day in June since the seller can proﬁt
from holding the bond as long as possible.
(b) The implied repo is:
[{(102  0.89)  2}  91]/91  0.01956  1.956% for three months, i.e. 7.824% p.a.
(The £2 is the accrued interest at the end of June.)
(c) Buy bonds and sell futures thereby investing at a risk-free 7.824% p.a.The bonds are bought
with money borrowed at 7.5% p.a.There is an arbitrage proﬁt of 7.824  7.5  0.324%
p.a. (This is a long cash-and-carry arbitrage.)

BASIS RISK
Fair basis – the difference between the fair futures price and the adjusted spot price (clean spot
price divided by the price factor) – reﬂects the ﬁnancing cost (interest rate) relative to the coupon
yield on the bond.A change in the interest rate on money borrowed to ﬁnance the purchase of a
bond in cash-and-carry arbitrage would alter the fair basis. Such a change in basis introduces a
degree of imperfection into a hedge.This possibility is known as basis risk. Fortunately, basis risk
is likely to be low when the cheapest-to-deliver bond is being hedged.
As the characteristics of the bond being hedged diverge further and further from those of
the cheapest-to-deliver bond, basis risk progressively increases.To the basis risk arising from the
possibility of changes in ﬁnancing costs must be added the basis risk from possible changes in
the relative prices of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and the bond being hedged.The greater the
difference between the cheapest-to-deliver bond and the bond being hedged,the greater the basis
risk arising from this latter source.When basis risk is so large that there is not a close relationship
between changes in the futures price and changes in the price of the bond being hedged,the futures
contract does not provide a suitable means of hedging.
SYNTHETIC BOND PORTFOLIOS
Government bond futures,together with a corresponding sum in money market investments (e.g.
bank deposits), can be used to create a portfolio with the same characteristics as a portfolio of
government bonds.This could be particularly advantageous as a means of structuring a bond
investment based on foreign currency bonds.An advantage arises from the avoidance of currency
risk (the risk that losses could be experienced as a result of falls in the values of the currencies in
which the bonds are priced).A portfolio of foreign currency bonds entails a currency exposure
equal to the full value of the bonds held.A portfolio that uses bond futures rather than bonds will
have a currency exposure that is limited to the sum held in margin accounts,which will be a small
fraction of the value of the fund.
When replicating a bond portfolio with futures it is necessary to reproduce two characteristics
of the portfolio being synthesised. One of these characteristics is the exposure to capital gain or
loss from changes in interest rates.The other characteristic is the stream of income, which would
take the form of a series of coupon payments in the case of the actual portfolio of bonds.This
amounts to the creation of the risk and return characteristics of a bond portfolio.A futures position
would provide both characteristics.
To replicate the exposure to capital gain or loss from changes in interest rates it is necessary to
ascertain the volatility (i.e. the PVBP, price value of a basis point) of the bond portfolio and of a
futures contract.Division of the PVBP of the replicated portfolio by the PVBP of a futures contract
provides the number of futures contracts that should be bought in order to replicate the portfolio.
(See earlier in this chapter the section on Adjusting Portfolio Duration with Futures.)
The creation of the stream of income equivalent to the coupon receipts from a portfolio of bonds
involves two components.One component is the interest from the money market investments (e.g.
interest on bank deposits).Since a futures contract costs nothing,the money that would otherwise
have been used to buy bonds is available to invest in the money market (the part of the money that
is held in margin accounts can also earn interest).
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
798

BOND FUTURES
799
The other component of the cash ﬂow arises from capital gains or losses guaranteed by the
futures price. For no arbitrage proﬁts to be available from long cash-and-carry, the ﬁnancing cost
of holding bonds (the interest rate) should be matched by the returns from holding the bonds in
the form of coupon receipts, plus capital gains (or losses) guaranteed by the futures premium (or
discount) relative to the spot price of the bonds.
This implies that the interest on a bank deposit,plus the gains (or losses) from futures,will tend
to equal the coupon return on the bonds. If the interest rate is lower than the coupon yield, there
will be a futures discount to spot.When the futures price rises relative to the spot bond price as
the futures maturity date approaches,the holder of a futures contract will enjoy a capital gain.The
converse occurs if the interest rate is higher than the coupon yield.
If the interest rate (ﬁnancing cost) exceeds the coupon yield,cash-and-carry arbitrage requires
an offsetting capital gain from futures. In cash-and-carry arbitrage the purchase of bonds is
associated with a sale of futures.A sale of futures provides a proﬁt from a fall in the futures price.
Futures should trade at a premium to the spot price of bonds so that a proﬁt is generated as the
futures price converges on (falls towards) the spot price as the maturity date of the futures is
approached.
An excess of the interest rate over the coupon yield implies that a futures fund provides a cash
ﬂow in excess of that of the corresponding bond fund.The futures fund should provide an offsetting
capital loss in order to equalise the cash ﬂows.The futures fund entails the purchase of futures with
the effect that the fall in the futures price as it converges towards the bond price produces the capital
loss required to offset the excess of the interest rate over the coupon yield.
EXERCISE 43.7
An investor holds £10,000,000 nominal of a government bond that is priced at £110, has a
redemption yield of 5.2% p.a., pays coupons twice a year, and has a (Macaulay’s) duration of 11
years.The cheapest-to-deliver government bond is priced at £105, has a redemption yield of 5%
p.a.,pays coupons twice a year,has a (Macaulay’s) duration of 9 years,and has a price factor of 1.2.
(a) How many futures contracts are needed to hedge the government bond holding? Should the
futures position be long or short?
(b) If the investor,rather than hedging the government bond holding,wanted to simulate a further
£10,000,000 nominal of the bond, how could that be achieved?
(c) Why might the strategies of (a) and (b) prove to be imperfect?
(d) What additional problems would arise when attempting to simulate a holding of corporate
bonds using government bond futures?
Answers

In the absence of a hedge ratio the number of futures contracts required would be:
£10,000,000/£100,000  100
where £100,000 is the (nominal) size of a futures contract.Taking account of the hedge ratio
the required number of futures contracts is:
100  1.53501  153.501
The nearest whole number, rounding down, is 153 futures contracts.The futures should be
sold, i.e. a short position in futures is required.
(b) To simulate a bond holding identical to the existing holding, the investor would undertake
transactions opposite to those of the hedge.The investor would buy 153 futures contracts.
(c) Reasons for imperfect hedging and simulation could include:
(i) Changes in basis.
(ii) Bond price convexity (duration based hedge ratios are accurate only for small redemption
yield changes).
(iii) The inability to trade the required number of contracts because of liquidity problems.
(iv) Changes in the cheapest-to-deliver bond, i.e. another bond could take over as the
cheapest-to-deliver with the effect that the hedge ratio needs to be changed.
(v) The required hedge ratio could change as a result of changes in price factors,bond prices,
durations, and redemption yields during the period of the hedge or simulation.
(vi) Indivisibility of contracts means that the precise number of required contracts cannot
be achieved (the nearest whole number has to be used).
(d) An additional problem when simulating a holding of corporate bonds is the creation of the
higher default risk, and corresponding risk premium. (The risk premium is the addition to
expected return required to compensate for the default risk.) Also this risk,and risk premium,
could change over time.These problems may be dealt with by using credit derivatives.

A fund manager holds £100,000,000 nominal of a government bond that is priced at £105, has
a redemption yield of 5% p.a., pays coupons twice a year, and has a (Macaulay’s) duration of

of 4.8% p.a., pays coupons twice a year, has a (Macaulay’s) duration of 8 years, and has a price
factor of 1.1.

where £100,000 is the (nominal) size of a futures contract.Taking account of the hedge ratio
the required number of futures contracts is:

(b) To construct a £100,000,000 futures fund,the investor would undertake transactions opposite

CREDIT DERIVATIVES
Credit derivatives are derivatives on credit risk and can be used to hedge credit risk on a speciﬁc
bond.The pay-off from a credit derivative might be based on the relationship between the price
of a corporate bond and the price of a risk-free (normally government) bond.Alternatively the
pay-off may be based on the difference between the redemption yields.These relationships would
be affected by credit events.
Credit events would include bankruptcy, insolvency, or payment default on the part of the
issuer of the bond whose credit risk is being hedged. Other credit events could include rating
changes for the hedged bond, or a substantial price decline on the part of the bond.A reference
bond may be used for the derivatives rather than the actual bond being hedged.
A yield spread is the difference between the yields on two bonds.A forward contract might be
based on a speciﬁed bond’s yield spread over a benchmark asset (such as a government bond).At
maturity of the forward contract a payment would be made based on the difference between the
spread agreed in the contract and the spread at maturity.

Credit options take a number of different forms.A common form is the default put. If there is
a credit event the writer (seller) of the option pays the buyer a sum of money. In this way the
option buyer obtains protection from credit events.The credit event that triggers the payment could
arise in relation either to the speciﬁc bond being hedged or to a reference bond.Whereas default
puts pay a ﬁxed sum of money when a credit event occurs,spread options pay a sum of money that
varies according to the severity of the event.The severity of the event is measured by the change
in yield spread.The option strike price would be a particular spread,and the option would provide
a pay-off if the actual spread differed from the strike price spread.The pay-off would increase as
the difference increased.
The purchase of a bond, together with appropriate derivative positions, can simulate a bond
with different risk characteristics. For example the purchase of a UK government bond could be
combined with a derivatives position based on the credit risk of a corporate bond.This combination
simulates a holding of the corporate bond.
By combining credit derivatives with government bond derivatives, it is possible to simulate a
portfolio of corporate bonds.The addition of currency derivatives could allow the currency of the
simulated portfolio to be changed.
Credit derivatives allow the credit risk of an asset to be transferred to another party, thereby
separating the credit risk from ownership of the asset.Batten and Hogan (2002) point out that most
credit derivatives are created when an investor seeks to hedge a particular risk, which results in
the credit derivative being speciﬁcally designed to meet that particular need. So the market for
credit derivatives is one that provides a variety of unique derivatives,each designed for a particular
situation.The lack of standardisation and uniformity,in the view of Batten and Hogan,has inhibited
the development of exchange-traded credit derivatives.
Bomﬁm (2002) suggests that the determinants of the prices of credit derivatives include the
credit risk of the bond issuer, the credit risk of the seller of the derivative, the likelihood of
simultaneous default by those two parties, and the sum of money that might be recovered
subsequent to a default.
Credit derivatives could be combined with government bond derivatives for the purpose
of hedging corporate bonds. An alternative is to combine government bond derivatives with
stock index derivatives.Clare et al. (2000) investigated the effectiveness of combining government
bond futures with stock index futures for the purpose of hedging corporate bonds. Combining
futures in this way is known as dual-asset hedging. They found that this dual-asset hedging
was superior to the use of government bond futures alone in the cases of some low-grade
bonds but that in most cases single-asset hedging with government bond futures was more
effective.
CONCLUSION
Bond futures are used to manage bond risk. Bond risk can be seen either as bond price risk or as
interest rate (bond redemption yield) risk because of the relationship between bond prices and
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
802

803
interest rates. So bond futures can be seen as means of managing bond price risk, or as means of
managing interest rate risk.
Institutional investors hold bond portfolios either as means of accumulating capital,or as means
of funding cash ﬂows (such as payments to annuity holders).Bond futures can be used to manipulate
the duration of a bond portfolio. Reduction of the price risk of a bond portfolio (hedging against
bond price falls) entails reducing the duration of the portfolio. A short bond futures position
reduces the duration of a long position in bonds (holding bonds).
Reduction in the cash ﬂow risk could be seen in isolation from any liabilities in the form of cash
ﬂow payment commitments, or in combination with any such liabilities. Reduction in cash ﬂow
risk may aim at guaranteeing a speciﬁc level of cash ﬂows. Such a guarantee entails hedging bond
price risk,which amounts to hedging interest rate risk.Reduction of the risk of cash ﬂow variations
relative to cash ﬂow liabilities (variations of inﬂows relative to outﬂows) could be achieved by
duration matching, which entails matching the duration of the bond portfolio with the duration
of the liabilities.
It is possible to construct portfolios using bond and credit derivatives, and without any
investment in bonds.However the accuracy of simulation of a bond portfolio can be compromised
in a number of ways, which mirror the sources of hedge imperfection when using futures (see
especially Part 8 on stock index futures).Sources of imperfection and inaccuracy include changes
in basis within (fairly wide) no-arbitrage bands.These sources are in addition to the interest rate
risk, which is the risk of a movement of the band. Movements within the band arise from the
behaviour of hedgers and speculators. So the value of a synthetic bond portfolio could be
substantially inﬂuenced by the behaviour of speculators, and in some cases their trading might be
akin to noise trading (see Chapter 24 on noise trading and behavioural ﬁnance). Of course, such
sources of uncertainty are also present when bond futures are used for risk management purposes.

Yield curves and interest
rate futures
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. Yield curves (the term structure of interest rates).
2. Bond portfolio construction.
3. The use of yield curves to estimate market expectations of future interest rates.
4. Forward yield curves.
5. Short-term interest rate futures.
6. Hedging the level, slope, and curvature of yield curves.
YIELD CURVES
A yield curve shows the relationship between the redemption yields of (interest rates on) bonds
and the maturities of those bonds.Figure 44.1 illustrates three possible shapes of the yield curve.
These are not the only possible shapes.The number of possible yield curve patterns (alternatively
known as the term structure of interest rates) is inﬁnite.
On the far left of the yield curve the investments are very short-term deposits that can be
withdrawn without notice, or with just a few days notice. On the far right the investments have
very distant maturities, for example 25-year government bonds.
The most common yield curve pattern is for yields (interest rates) to rise with increasing
maturity but for the rate of increase to diminish.The diminishing rate of increase implies that,for
distant maturities, increases in maturity entail little or no increment to yields.The yield curve
labelled ‘normal’ illustrates this pattern.
The yield curve sometimes exhibits a downward slope, as illustrated by the curve labelled
‘inverted’.The ﬂat yield curve shows a situation in which interest rates are the same irrespective
of the length of time for which money is invested; such a situation is extremely unusual.
Explanations of the term structure of interest rates,and hence the shape of the yield curve,can
be divided into three theories.These three theories are pure expectations, expectations with risk
premium, and market segmentation.

YIELD CURVES AND INTEREST RATE FUTURES
805
According to the pure expectations theory, long-term interest rates can be seen as averages
(geometric means) of current and expected future short-term interest rates.So,for example,the
12-month interest rate would be an average of the current 3-month rate and the expected rates for
each of the subsequent three 3-month periods.Likewise the 5-year interest rate would be an average
of the current 1-year rate and the expected 1-year rates for each of the subsequent four years.
Suppose that the spot (current) 1-year interest rate is 10% p.a. and the expected rate for the
following year is 12% p.a.The current 2-year interest rate should be the geometric mean of these
two rates.
√(1.1)(1.12)  √1.232  1.11
(1)
The 2-year rate is 1.11  1  0.11 as a decimal,which is 11% p.a.as a percentage.The 2-year
rate is the rate which,when compounded over two years,gives the same ﬁnal value as 10% in one
year compounded with 12% in the following year. According to the pure expectations theory,
investors should have no preference between the alternative of investing at 11% p.a.for two years
and the other alternative of investing for one year at 10% p.a. whilst anticipating investment of
the proceeds for a further year at 12% p.a.
EXERCISE 44.1
The current 3-month interest rate is 11% p.a.and market expectations of the next seven 3-month
rates are 11%,11%,10%,10%,10%,9%,and 9% p.a.What,according to the pure expectations
theory, should the current 2-year rate be?

Figure 44.1

Since the interest rates are 3-month rates, the annual rates need to be divided by four (3-months
being treated as a quarter of a year). So, for example, 11% p.a. is 2.75% over three months.The
eight 3-month returns are compounded on one another to obtain the value of the investment at
the end of the two years, which is 1.22136. Since interest rates are always expressed on a per
annum (per year) basis, the square root of the ﬁnal sum is taken.The square root shows the per
annum rate, which when compounded over two years, produces the ﬁnal sum of 1.22136.
If the pure expectations theory is an accurate explanation of the level of long-term interest rates,
it is possible to infer market expectations of future interest rates from the yield curve.The implied
future interest rates are referred to as forward interest rates.
In the previous example, an investor knowing that the 1-year rate is 10% p.a. and the 2-year
rate is 11% p.a. could deduce that the 1-year rate expected to be available one year from now is
12% p.a.In other words,the forward interest rate is 12% p.a.The forward interest rate is the rate
which when compounded on the 1-year rate of 10% p.a. produces the same sum as 11% p.a.
compounded over two years.
EXERCISE 44.2
If the 2-year interest rate is 10.5% p.a., and the 1-year rate is 9.5% p.a., what does the market
expect the 1-year interest rate to be a year from now?
Answer
(1.105)2/1.095  1.1151
(1.1151  1)  100  11.51% p.a.
This can be seen as 1.095 being invested,at the end of the ﬁrst year,at 11.51% p.a.to yield (1.105)2
at the end of the second year.
The pure expectations theory assumes that investors are indifferent between investing for a long
period on the one hand and investing for a shorter period with a view to reinvesting the principal
plus interest on the other hand.For example an investor would have no preference between making
a 12-month deposit and making a 6-month deposit with a view to reinvesting the proceeds for a
further six months so long as the expected interest receipts are the same.This is equivalent to
saying that the pure expectations theory assumes that investors treat alternative maturities as
perfect substitutes for one another.
The pure expectations theory assumes that investors are risk-neutral.A risk-neutral investor is
not concerned about the possibility that interest rate expectations will prove to be incorrect, so

YIELD CURVES AND INTEREST RATE FUTURES
807
long as potential favourable deviations from expectations are as likely as unfavourable ones. Risk
is not regarded negatively.
Most people are not risk-neutral; they are risk-averse.They dislike risk. Risk-averse investors
are prepared to forgo some investment return in order to achieve greater certainty in regard to
the value of investments and the income from them.As a result of risk-aversion,investors may not
be indifferent between alternative maturities.Attitudes to risk may generate preferences for either
short or long maturities. If such is the case, the term structure of interest rates (the yield curve)
would reﬂect risk premiums.
If an investment is close to maturity, there is little risk of capital loss arising from interest
rate changes. A bond with a distant maturity (long duration) would suffer considerable capital
loss in the event of a large rise in interest rates.The risk of such losses is known as capital risk.
To compensate for the risk that capital losses might be realised on long-term investments,
investors may require a risk premium on such investments.A risk premium is an addition to the
interest or yield to compensate investors for accepting risk.This tends to impart an upward
slope to a yield curve.This tendency towards an upward slope is likely to be reinforced by the
preference of many borrowers to borrow for long periods (rather than borrowing for a succession
of short periods). Such borrowers may be willing to pay an interest premium for the facility of
borrowing long term.
There is a form of risk that would tend to have the opposite effect on the slope of a yield curve:
this is known as income risk. Some investors may prefer long maturity investments because they
provide greater certainty of income ﬂows.For example a conventional UK government bond pays
a constant coupon every six months until the bond reaches its redemption date. On the other
hand,interest receipts from bank deposits can change frequently.Income ﬂows from a bank deposit
are very uncertain.This uncertainty is income risk.
If investors have a preference for predictability of interest receipts, they may require a higher
rate of interest on short-term investments to compensate for income risk.This would tend to
cause the yield curve to be inverted (downward sloping).
The effects on the slope of the yield curve from factors such as capital risk and income risk are
in addition to the effect of expectations of future short-term interest rates. If money market
participants expect short-term interest rates to rise, the yield curve would tend to be upward
sloping. If the effect of capital risk were greater than the effect of income risk, the upward slope
would be steeper as a result.If market expectations were that short-term interest rates would fall
in the future, the yield curve would tend to be downward sloping.A dominance of capital-risk
aversion over income-risk aversion would render the downward slope less steep (or possibly turn
a downward slope into an upward slope).
Dimson et al.(2000) found that over the twentieth century,on average,long-term bonds showed
a modest premium over short-term investments (Treasury bills). In the UK the long end of the
maturity spectrum averaged a 0.3% premium over the short end.For a group of 12 countries the
premium was 0.6% on average.King and Kurmann (2002) investigated US interest rates between
1951 and 2001 and found that the expectations theory provided a reasonable approximation to the
observed term structure of interest rates.However they found that there were deviations from the
term structure predicted by expectations, and that the deviations could be ascribed to risk
premiums.They found that there was some tendency for the whole yield curve to move up and
down, indicating that there were factors that affected both short- and long-term interest rates

simultaneously. Not all studies have supported the expectations theory; for example a study by
Sarno et al. (2007) rejected the expectations hypothesis in the sense of pure expectations plus a
constant risk premium.
The third theory of the term structure of interest rates is the market segmentation approach.
According to the market segmentation theory,interest rates for different maturities are determined
independently of one another. The interest rate for short maturities is determined by the
supply of and demand for short-term funds. Long-term interest rates are those that equate the
sums that investors wish to lend long term with the amounts that borrowers are seeking on a
long-term basis.
According to market segmentation theory, investors (and borrowers) do not consider
successions of short-term investments (or borrowings) as substitutes for long-term ones.This lack
of substitutability keeps interest rates of differing maturities independent of one another. If
investors (or borrowers) considered alternative maturities as substitutes,they may switch between
maturities. If investors (and borrowers) switch between maturities in response to interest rate
changes, interest rates for different maturities would no longer be independent of each other.An
interest rate change for one maturity would affect demand/supply, and hence interest rates, for
other maturities.
A variation on the market segmentation theory is the preferred habitat hypothesis.The preferred
habitat hypothesis is less extreme than the market segmentation theory since it allows for some
substitutability between maturities. However the preferred habitat view sees substitutability as
being less than perfect so that interest premiums are needed to entice investors from their preferred
maturities to other maturities.
According to the market segmentation and preferred habitat explanations, government can
have a direct impact on the yield curve.Governments borrow by selling bills and bonds of various
maturities.If government borrows by selling long-term bonds,it will push up long-term interest
rates (push down long-term bond prices) and cause the yield curve to be more upward sloping
(or less downward sloping).If the borrowing were at the short maturity end,short-term interest
rates would be pushed up.
CONSTRUCTION OF BOND PORTFOLIOS
A portfolio manager needs to take account of potential changes in the slope of the yield curve. If
a portfolio manager expects the slope to change, the portfolio should be adjusted accordingly.
The effects of a change in slope can be seen by considering two possible portfolio constructions.
These constructions are known as a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio.A bullet portfolio uses
bonds of a single maturity, for example ten years.A barbell portfolio focuses on two maturities,
for example ﬁve years and twenty years.The two portfolios may have identical durations but exhibit
very different responses to a change in the slope of the yield curve.A steepening of the yield curve
(long-term redemption yields rising relative to short-term redemption yields) would be to the
disadvantage of the barbell portfolio relative to the bullet portfolio.
A steepening of the yield curve involves yields on distant maturity bonds rising relative to those
on short-term bonds. For a barbell portfolio, the interest rate rise impacts (negatively) on the
bonds that are most sensitive to interest rate changes whereas the interest rate fall (positively)
affects the bonds that are less sensitive to interest rate movements.So a steepening of the yield curve

tends to disadvantage barbell portfolios. Conversely a ﬂattening of the yield curve (long-term
yields falling and short-term yields rising) is to the advantage of a barbell portfolio.
A popular strategy among bond portfolio managers is known as ‘riding the yield curve’.This
strategy seeks to take advantage of risk (liquidity) premiums that cause longer-term redemption
yields to exceed shorter-term yields.The process entails buying longer-term bonds, with the
relatively high yields,and holding them until the yield declines as a result of the fall in risk premium
(this fall is due to the bond acquiring a shorter maturity from the passage of time).The decline in
yield would be associated with a rise in price (because of the inverse relationship between yields
and prices).The procedure may, for example, entail buying a two-year bond and selling it when
its maturity has fallen to one year.The decline in yield brings about a capital gain on the bond.The
strategy depends on the yield curve having an upward slope.
One danger for the investor is that a general rise in yields could eliminate the gains from the
fall in the relative yield.The decline in the risk premium could be overwhelmed by a rise in risk-
free yields,in other words the strategy would entail interest rate risk.If riding the yield curve were
seen as an alternative to holding a bond whose maturity matched the desired investment horizon,
it would entail buying bonds with maturities exceeding the investment horizon and selling at the
investment horizon. This would beneﬁt from the decline in the risk premium but would be
vulnerable to interest rate risk. Bieri and Chincarini (2005) suggest that this interest rate risk
could be managed by the use of a barbell investment.The longer-term bond could be combined
with a short-term investment such that the duration of the barbell matched the investment horizon.
They found that riding the yield curve did provide higher returns than simply investing in a bond
whose maturity matched the investment horizon.There were still excess returns when the barbell
strategy was used.
FORWARD INTEREST RATES AND EXPECTED
FUTURE INTEREST RATES
The manager of a portfolio of bonds may make changes to the portfolio in the light of that manager’s
expectations of future interest rates.The expectations that are relevant to investment decisions are
expectations relative to market expectations. An active portfolio manager bases investment
decisions on attempts to forecast interest rates more accurately than the average participant in the
money market.For this reason the manager of an actively managed bond portfolio needs to be able
to ascertain the market consensus forecast.Such market expectations can be deduced from forward
interest rates.
Forward interest rates are rates for periods commencing at points of time in the future.They
are implied by current rates for differing maturities. For example, the current 3-month interest
rate and the current 6-month interest rate between them imply a rate for a 3-month period which
runs from a point in time three months from the present until a point in time six months hence.
The forward 3-month rate for a period commencing three months from the present is the rate
which,when compounded on the current 3-month rate,would yield the same return as the current
6-month rate. For example if the 3-month rate is 9% p.a. and the 6-month rate is 10% p.a., the
forward rate is shown as x in equation (2).
(1.0225)(1  x)  1.05
(2)

0.0225 is the decimal rate for three months based on 9% p.a. (2.25% over a quarter of a year
is obtained by taking a quarter of 9%) and 0.05 is the decimal rate for six months based on 10%
p.a.The forward rate is calculated as:
x  (1.05/1.0225)  1  0.0269
which is 2.69% over three months and hence 10.76% p.a. (multiplying 2.69% by four).
The forward rate can be interpreted as the market expectation of the future interest rate under
speciﬁc circumstances.These circumstances are (1) the expectations theory of the yield curve is
correct and (2) there is no risk premium. If the expectations theory is seen as a good model, but
a risk premium is thought to be present,an adjustment is required to remove the effects of the risk
premium before the result can be interpreted as the market forecast of the future interest rate.
This is illustrated in Exercise 44.3.
EXERCISE 44.3
The one-year interest rate is 6.5% p.a. and the six-month interest rate is 6% p.a. What is
the forward six-month interest rate for the period between six months and one year from now?
Can this forward interest rate be taken to be the interest rate expected by money market
participants?
Answers
Let x be the forward interest rate p.a. (so that the rate for six months is x/2).
(1.03)(1  x/2)  1.065
1  x/2  (1.065)/(1.03)
x/2  [(1.065)/(1.03)]  1
x  2{ [(1.065)/(1.03)]  1}
Therefore x  0.068, i.e. 6.8% p.a.
The forward interest rate of 6.8% p.a. can be taken to be the market expectation if (1) the
expectations theory of the yield curve is correct and (2) there is no risk premium. If the
expectations theory is correct but there is a risk premium, the risk premium must be removed
before carrying out the calculation. Suppose that the six-month rate contains no risk premium,
but the one-year rate contains a risk premium of 0.1% p.a.The one-year interest rate, net of the
risk premium, is 6.4% p.a.The new calculation would be as follows:
(1.03)(1  x/2)  (1.064)
x  2{[(1.064)/(1.03)]  1}
Therefore x  0.066, i.e. 6.6% p.a.

(a) In the case of the one-year bond, an investment of £95 entails a receipt of £100 in one year.
£100/£95  1.0526 which implies a spot one-year interest rate of 5.26%.

The yield curve based on zero coupon bonds is known as the spot yield curve.It is regarded
as more informative than a yield curve that relates redemption yields to maturities of coupon-
bearing bonds because it is unambiguous.Yield curves that relate redemption yields of coupon-
bearing bonds to maturities involve ambiguities since each coupon represents a maturity. So
the redemption date is not the only maturity date.Coupon-bearing bonds may have differing
redemption yields, despite having common redemption dates, because of differences in the
coupon payments.Yield curves based on coupon-bearing bonds may not provide a single
redemption yield corresponding to a redemption (ﬁnal maturity) date. As a result the
relationship between redemption yield and maturity is ambiguous.
(c) 1.25/1.0526  1.18754

√1.18754  1.0897
1.0897  1  0.0897 i.e. 8.97% p.a.
The two-year forward rate for the period beginning one year from the present is 8.97% p.a.
THE FORWARD YIELD CURVE
The forward yield curve relates forward interest rates to the points of time to which they relate.
For example, rates of return on ﬁve-year bonds and rates on four-year bonds imply rates on one-
year instruments to be entered into four years from the present.The implied forward rate can be
calculated by means of the formula:
(1  4r1)  (1  r5)5 / (1  r4)4
where r5 is the ﬁve-year interest rate, r4 is the four-year interest rate, and 4r1 is the one-year
rate expected in four years’ time.
This formula arises from the relation:
(1  r5)5  (1  r4)4 (1  4r1)
which states that a ﬁve-year investment at the ﬁve-year interest rate should yield the same ﬁnal
sum as a four-year investment at the four-year rate with the proceeds reinvested for one year at
the one-year rate expected to be available four years hence.The value of 4r1 would be related to
the point in time, of four years, on the yield curve.
Carrying out such a calculation for a succession of future periods produces a series of forward
interest rates.When plotted against their respective dates, the series of forward rates produces a
forward yield curve.An unambiguous forward yield curve requires the use of zero coupon bonds
for the calculations.

YIELD CURVES AND INTEREST RATE FUTURES
813
SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE FUTURES
Both borrowers and investors face interest rate risk.Borrowers lose from increasing interest rates,
while investors lose in the event of declines. Short-term interest rate futures, which frequently
take the form of three-month interest rate futures, are instruments suitable for the reduction of
the risks of interest rate changes.Three-month interest rate futures are notional commitments to
borrow or deposit for a three-month period that commences on the futures maturity date.They
provide means whereby borrowers or investors can (at least approximately) predetermine interest
rates for future periods.
Three-month interest rate futures have a limited number of maturity dates each year; typi-
cally one in each of March, June, September, and December. Buying a June three-month sterling
interest rate futures contract notionally commits the buyer to the deposit of £500,000, for three
months from the June maturity date, at an interest rate determined in the present.The seller is
simultaneously notionally committed to borrowing for that period and is also guaranteed that
interest rate.
Short-term interest rate futures contracts are quoted on an index basis.The index is equal to
100 minus the annualised futures interest rate. For example, a three-month interest rate of 3%
giving an annualised rate of 12% p.a.implies that the contract would be priced at 88 (100  12).
It is to be emphasised that such prices are merely indices that are used in ascertaining proﬁts and
losses from futures trading and do not represent money payable for contracts.
DETERMINATION OF FUTURES PRICES
The creation of a forward position in interest rates can be looked upon as a deferred deposit or
borrowing. For example a potential investor who anticipates the receipt of money three months
hence and intends to deposit it for three months can, in the present, borrow money for three
months and deposit it for six months.When the cash is received, it is used to repay the three-
month borrowing, leaving the six-month deposit intact for the remaining three months. So there
is no net cash inﬂow or outﬂow in the present, but a cash outﬂow after three months (debt
repayment) and a cash inﬂow after six months (maturity of the six-month deposit).These cash
outﬂows and inﬂows are equivalent to a three-month deposit made three months hence.The
advantage of the creation of a forward position is that it guarantees the interest rate for the future
three-month period,this interest rate being implied by the spot three-month and six-month rates.
If the rates that can be guaranteed by such forward transactions differ from the rates that can
be guaranteed using futures contracts, an arbitrage opportunity may exist. Arbitragers could
borrow via the cheaper method and deposit through the approach yielding the higher interest rate.
This pursuit of arbitrage proﬁts would tend to cause both spot and futures rates to move so as to
eliminate arbitrage possibilities (by moving the two deferred interest rates towards equality).For
example if the futures interest rate is the lower one, arbitragers would sell futures (to guarantee
being able to borrow at that lower rate), thereby causing the futures price to fall and hence the
futures interest rate to rise until it has risen into line with the forward interest rate.
Arbitrage tends to ensure that the futures interest rate approximates closely to the forward
interest rate. If the futures rate were signiﬁcantly below the forward rate, arbitragers would lend
long and borrow short,using the futures market to guarantee future short-term borrowing rates.

Lending for the longer term and ﬁnancing the lending by short-term borrowing, whilst using
futures to guarantee that the debt can be renewed at a low rate,provides a high future lending rate
matched against a low future borrowing rate.This would involve selling futures (commitments to
future borrowing) and the increased sales would push down their prices.The fall in futures prices
corresponds to a rise in futures interest rates.This increase in futures interest rates will tend to
eliminate the scope for further arbitrage proﬁts.
EXERCISE 44.5
(a) If the three-month interest rate is 4.5% p.a. and the six-month interest rate is 5% p.a., what
is the forward interest rate for the three-month period commencing three months from now?
(b) On the basis of the forward interest rate,what should be the price of the three-month interest
rate futures contract maturing three months from now?
(c) If the futures price were 94.80, how could an arbitrage proﬁt be made?
(d) What should be the effect of the arbitrage on the futures price and the futures interest rate?
Answers
(a) 5% p.a. is 2.5% over six months, and 4.5% p.a. is 1.125% over three months.
(1.025)/(1.01125)  1.013597
1.013597  1  0.013597, i.e. 1.3597% for three months or 5.44% p.a. (to two decimal
places).
The forward interest rate is 5.44% p.a.
(b) The price of the futures should be 100  5.44  94.56.
(c) A futures price of 94.80 implies a futures interest rate of 100  94.80  5.20% p.a.
An arbitrage proﬁt could be made by selling futures and structuring a long forward interest
rate.A six-month deposit at 5% p.a. ﬁnanced by borrowing for three months at 4.5% p.a.
produces a three-month forward deposit at an interest rate of 5.44% p.a. By selling futures
at 94.80 a future three-month borrowing rate of 5.20% p.a.is guaranteed.An arbitrage proﬁt
equivalent to 5.44%  5.20%  0.24% p.a. is obtained.
(d) The sale of futures should reduce the futures price and raise the futures interest rate.
The futures interest rate should rise towards the forward interest rate.
HEDGING THE YIELD CURVE WITH FUTURES
The basic principle of hedging with ﬁnancial futures is that a futures position should be taken so
that the feared interest rate change causes a proﬁt on futures that compensates for the loss incurred
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
814

YIELD CURVES AND INTEREST RATE FUTURES
815
on the assets or liabilities. If an investor expects interest rates to fall (i.e. the level of the yield
curve to fall), short-term interest rate futures are bought.A decline in interest rates is associated
with a rise in futures prices. Buying futures would proﬁt from a price rise. So buying futures
provides a proﬁt that offsets the adverse effects of a fall in interest rates on the investor’s returns.
Short-term interest rate futures prices are quoted on the basis of:
100  the interest rate
For example a futures interest rate of 6% p.a. would be quoted as a futures price of 94 
(100  6).A fall in the futures interest rate causes a rise in the futures price, and vice versa.
A depositor (lender) would lose from a fall in interest rates and hence buys futures.A fall in
interest rates would raise futures prices and hence provide a proﬁt to the buyer of the futures.A
borrower would lose from a rise in interest rates and hence sells futures in order to proﬁt from a
fall in the futures price (rise in the futures interest rate).

(20  £500,000) for 3 months  £50,000.
Example 44.1 illustrates a perfect hedge.Hedging is rarely,if ever,perfect.One reason is that the
instrument underlying the futures contract is rarely identical to the instrument being hedged. In
other words there may be an asset mismatch. In addition to asset mismatch, there are date and
maturity mismatches.Futures have a limited number of maturity dates available,and it is unlikely
that a futures maturity date coincides with a deposit or borrowing date. In addition, short-term
interest rate futures are usually for three-month deposits and borrowings, whereas the hedged
position may be for a different period of time. Date and maturity mismatches involve exposures
to changes in the slope and curvature of the yield curve.
The objective of hedging is typically one of minimising, rather than eliminating, risk.When
hedging is undertaken,some risk remains.Probably the most signiﬁcant remaining risk is basis risk.
Basis is the difference between the futures interest rate and the interest rate on the asset or liability

being hedged.A change in basis renders a hedge imperfect. Basis risk arises from the tendency of
futures interest rates to show movements that differ in unpredictable ways from the interest rate
movements on the borrowing or investment being hedged.In other words,perfect hedging requires
futures interest rates and cash market interest rates to move exactly in line with each other (or at
least that any deviation should be predictable). Example 44.2 shows hedge imperfection arising
from a change in basis.

(20  £500,000) for 3 months  £25,000.
One way of dealing with basis risk is based on the observation that basis risk largely arises from
changes in the slope and curvature of the yield curve.One technique is the straddle,which involves
purchases of contracts with one maturity date and simultaneous sales of contracts with another
maturity date with a view to making proﬁts from relative price movements.The straddle hedges
against changes in the slope of the yield curve.This may be supported by the use of a futures
butterﬂy,which hedges against changes in the curvature of the yield curve (Redhead 1997,1999).
There are three dimensions of hedging yield curve risk.The ﬁrst involves hedging against changes
in the level of the yield curve.The second concerns hedging the risk that the slope of the curve may
change.The third hedging dimension relates to possible changes in the curvature of the yield curve.
These are three ascending levels of sophistication.Ideally,all three dimensions should be hedged.
Hedging the level of the yield curve is the basic hedge,but the effectiveness of the hedge could be
undermined if the slope of the yield curve changed (thereby causing basis to change).An attempt
to hedge against slope changes could be undermined by a change in curvature.So the most effective
hedging strategy addresses all three dimensions.
Straddles
As the hedging strategy is developed through these three levels of reﬁnement, it becomes
increasingly complex.To deal with the risk of slope changes, a futures straddle (inter-delivery or

YIELD CURVES AND INTEREST RATE FUTURES
817
time spread) should be added to the basic hedge. Hedging curvature risk would involve adding a
futures butterﬂy (a straddle of straddles) to the previous two hedges.So the most complete hedge
would add together a basic hedge, a straddle, and a butterﬂy. (Although the word ‘most’ has been
used here, there is scope for even greater levels of reﬁnement in hedging a yield curve.) If a
borrower seeks protection from a rise in the slope of the yield curve, a futures straddle can be
bought. Nearby futures contracts are bought and distant maturity contracts sold. A rise in the
slope (steepening) of the forward yield curve raises distant forward interest rates relative to earlier
forward rates.This lowers the price of the distant futures contracts relative to the nearby ones.
Buying nearby contracts and selling distant ones generates proﬁts in the event of the prices of
distant contracts falling relative to nearby ones.
Futures straddles involve buying and selling equal numbers of futures contracts for different
delivery months (e.g.buying ﬁve June and selling ﬁve September would constitute a long straddle).
The objective is to make a proﬁt from an otherwise unfavourable change in the gradient of the
yield curve.
Butterﬂy Spreads
In the case of butterﬂy spreads, the view is on the relationship between two straddles.A butterﬂy
is a spread of straddles.
Suppose that three-month sterling futures contracts have the prices shown in Table 44.1 for the
next three maturity months.The value of a straddle is obtained by subtracting the farther futures
price from the nearer futures price.Within the butterﬂy the nearby straddle is 150 basis points
(92.00  90.50),while the deferred straddle is 50 basis points (90.50  90.00).The value of the
butterﬂy spread is 100 basis points (150  50).
If the butterﬂy spread is expected to strengthen (more positive/less negative), the butterﬂy
spread is bought (buy the nearby straddle and sell the distant one);in the opposite case,the butterﬂy
is sold.A bought (long) butterﬂy proﬁts from increased curvature of the yield curve.
For example the numbers in Table 44.1 imply forward interest rates of 8%, 9.50%,
and 10%. If the December rate falls to 9%, the forward yield curve becomes more curved
(curvature increases). In this case the December futures price rises to 91.00. This gives a
proﬁt from buying the butterﬂy since the long butterﬂy entails buying December futures
contracts.
The addition of a straddle and a butterﬂy to a basic hedge does not necessarily lead to
a large increase in the total number of futures contracts. Between the three strategies there
would be some offsetting of long and short futures positions. The net number of futures
bought, or sold, would match the size of the asset or liability being hedged. However if
there is asset mismatch a further adjustment to the hedge is required, based on a generic
hedge ratio.

A GENERIC HEDGE RATIO
When the asset or liability being hedged differs in nature from the instrument on which the futures
are based, a hedge ratio should be applied.This hedge ratio is generic in that it is applicable to all
hedging with futures, irrespective of what is being hedged (interest rates, bond prices, stock
indices, etc.).The generic hedge ratio is expressed as:
H    (S/F)
where  is the coefﬁcient of correlation between the cash market and the futures (e.g.between
spot and futures interest rates), S is the cash market standard deviation, and F is the standard
deviation of the futures.
FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS
Forward Rate Agreements(FRAs) are often seen as OTC (over the counter) interest rate futures.
A client and a bank agree on a target, or benchmark, future interest rate and if the actual interest
rate differs from that target rate a compensatory cash ﬂow will occur between the client and
the bank.
The time periods used in FRAs correspond to the typical interest rate rollover periods in the
money markets.These periods tend to be quarters and half-years.Typical FRAs are ‘3 against 6’
and ‘6 against 12’.A ‘3 against 6’FRA entails a commitment to lend or borrow for a 3-month period
starting three months from the present. A ‘6 against 12’ FRA involves a commitment to lend
or borrow for 6 months commencing six months from the present.
The target, or benchmark, interest rates are based on the forward interest rates derived from
the yield curve. Consequently they are very close to futures interest rates. If the three rates were
not very close there would be arbitrage opportunities, and the pursuit of those opportunities
should bring the three rates together.
As with interest rate futures,FRAs can be used to hedge against unexpected changes in interest
rates.An investor might want to hedge against a fall in interest rates.The investor would sell an
FRA in order to guarantee the future interest rate (note that with futures the lender buys but with
FRAs the lender sells).As with futures,FRAs entail accounting for differences.They do not entail
lending or borrowing, they merely entail cash ﬂows arising from differences between target and
actual interest rates.
Suppose an investor sells an FRA with a target interest rate of 5% p.a.If the interest rate turns
out to be less than 5% p.a., the investor will receive money from the bank to compensate for the
reduced rate. If the interest rate turns out to be above 5% p.a., the investor pays the bank the
monetary value of the difference between the interest rates.Either way the investor guarantees an
interest rate of 5% p.a.
In the case of an FRA the cash ﬂow occurs when the investment (or borrowing) is to be made.
In the case of a ‘6 against 12’FRA,this would be six months after the FRA is sold (or bought).This
contrasts with futures, which use marking to market.The marking to market of futures contracts
entails daily cash ﬂows that reﬂect daily changes in futures prices.Futures entail the accumulation
of compensatory money ﬂows over time, rather than the whole sum changing hands at one point
in time.

819
As with other instruments,FRAs have bid-offer spreads.Borrowing rates exceed lending rates.
The market for FRAs is very competitive and,in consequence,bid-offer spreads are small.Spreads
of 4 basis points (0.04% p.a.) are common.
CONCLUSION
It is commonplace to talk about ‘the’ interest rate. In reality there are many interest rates.
There is a different interest rate for each combination of maturity and credit risk.Yield curves
indicate how interest rates vary with maturity.There would be a separate yield curve for each
level of credit risk.
Market expectations of future interest rates can be estimated from observed yield curves.Such
expectations are derived from the calculation of forward interest rates.Forward interest rates are
the basis for pricing short-term interest rate futures.
Short-term interest rate futures can be used to hedge the level, slope, and curvature of a
yield curve.They can be combined with bond futures to hedge longer-term interest rates (see
Chapter 43 on bond futures). Short-term interest rate futures have low durations and their
inclusion in a synthetic bond portfolio would help the manipulation of its duration.

Chapter 45
Interest rate swaps
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge of:
1. The nature of interest rate swaps.
2. The use of interest rate swaps for hedging risk.
3. The warehousing of swaps by banks.
4. Floating rate notes (FRNs).
5. How swaps can be priced.
6. Credit default swaps.
The term ‘swap’ is most commonly used in the sense of an agreement to the future exchange of
cash ﬂows.The cash ﬂows exchanged may have a wide variety of bases. In the case of interest rate
swaps,the typical exchange is of cash ﬂows arising from a ﬁxed rate of interest (ﬁxed for the period
to the maturity of the swap) for cash ﬂows arising from a ﬂoating interest rate (perhaps a rate
changed every six months reﬂecting movements in a market rate such as LIBOR,the London Inter-
Bank Offered Rate).
Most interest rate swaps involve cash ﬂows in the same currency but on different interest bases.
The ‘plain vanilla’swap involves the exchange of ﬁxed-rate interest ﬂows for ﬂoating rate interest
ﬂows. One possible motivation is that of hedging.
Swaps are typically longer-term instruments than forwards, futures, and options. Periods in
excess of ten years are not unusual. In many cases they are equivalent to a succession of forward
contracts stretching into the future.
There are also swaptions. Swaptions are options on swaps. In return for the payment of a
premium the buyer of a swaption obtains the right, but not the obligation, to enter a swap
agreement in the future on terms agreed when buying the swaption.
HEDGING INTEREST RATE RISK
Floating rate deposits expose an investor to the risk of decreases in the interest rate.An investor
may wish to avoid this risk by taking out a ﬁxed-rate deposit but may be committed to a ﬂoating

rate deposit.The investor could attempt to swap the ﬂoating rate asset for a ﬁxed-rate asset,thereby
obtaining a ﬁxed-rate investment.
The swap may be carried out directly between two counterparties or may involve a bank as
intermediary. In the latter case, the bank might take the role of counterparty to both of the
participants, thereby bearing the risk of default by either party and eliminating the need for the
participants to investigate the creditworthiness of the other.This has the additional advantage of
allowing anonymity of the parties.
In Figure 45.1, investor A has a ﬁxed-interest bank deposit and wishes to swap the interest
receipts for the interest on a ﬂoating rate deposit. Investor B has a ﬂoating rate bank deposit and
wants to exchange the interest receipts for those on a ﬁxed-rate deposit. Investor A effectively
converts to a ﬂoating rate whilst B simulates a ﬁxed-rate investment.
Figure 45.1 depicts the situation in which the two investors negotiate a swap directly with each
other. More usually a bank will be counterparty to both.This is illustrated by Figure 45.2.
When it acts as counterparty to both investors, the bank faces the risk that an investor could
default.This leaves the bank exposed to an interest rate risk; the remaining customer may be
receiving a high rate of interest and paying a low one.The original matching allowed losses from
transactions with one customer to be offset by the corresponding gains from the deal with the other
customer. Once one of the two counterparties defaults, the bank is exposed to the possibility of
losses, and indeed the customer from whom the bank is making gains is the one most likely to
renege on its agreement.The loss-making counterparty (the one paying more interest than it
receives) is more likely to default than the proﬁt-making counterparty.

BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS

EXAMPLE 45.1
A building society raises £5 million by issuing a eurobond at a ﬁxed interest rate of 6% p.a. over
three years, payable annually, for the purpose of providing mortgages on a ﬂoating rate basis (with
interest rates reassessed annually). It is exposed to the risk that interest rates might fall with the
effect that interest receipts from the mortgages are inadequate to meet the interest payments on
the eurobond. The building society could reduce its exposure by swapping its ﬁxed-rate liability
for one on a ﬂoating rate basis. It ﬁnds a bank prepared to enter a ﬂoating for ﬁxed swap on the
basis of receiving LIBOR  0.75% p.a. in exchange for paying 6% p.a. Initially LIBOR stands
at 5.25% p.a. Net interest payments to the bank under the swap arrangement, as shown in the
table, are on an annual basis.
LIBOR rises by 0.5% between the ﬁrst and second years, with the result that the building society
makes a net payment of £25,000 to the bank. LIBOR falls by 1.5% between years 2 and 3, with
the result that the bank pays the building society £50,000.

This example illustrates the fact that a hedger could either gain or lose from the hedging instrument
used.The essential point of hedging is that the gains/losses from the swap offset losses/gains on
the position being hedged.In this case in year 2 the gain from higher mortgage receipts,arising from
higher mortgage interest rates, is offset by a loss on the swap. If interest rates had fallen, thereby
reducing mortgage interest receipts, there would have been an offsetting gain from the swap.
WAREHOUSING
Warehousing by a bank consists of doing a swap and hedging it.When a suitable swap counterparty
appears,the hedge is undone.One way in which the hedging might be carried out is by the use of
ﬁnancial futures.For example a bank might agree to pay ﬁxed against receiving ﬂoating and covers
the risk of a fall in interest rates by buying ﬁnancial futures.
By buying three-month interest rate futures contracts the bank can lock in interest rates.
If interest rates fall the price of futures contracts will rise providing the bank with a gain that
compensates for the interest rate fall.
The willingness to make a market in swaps has considerably increased the speed with which
swaps are provided. Deals are available on demand without requiring simultaneous availability of
a matching counterparty.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS
823
Indeed a bank is likely to have a large portfolio of swaps, many of which tend to offset one
another. Only the net exposure needs to be hedged.The hedging may be undertaken with short-
term interest rate futures, long-term interest rate (bond) futures, and bonds (it will be seen that
swaps can be valued as the difference between two bond prices).
FLOATING RATE NOTES
Before turning to swap valuation it would be useful to examine floating rate notes (FRNs). A
ﬂoating rate note is a bond whose coupons are not ﬁxed but are varied at points in time,e.g.at six-
month intervals.The coupon rate would be reassessed in the light of a reference interest rate.Such
a bond might, for instance, pay 1% p.a. over LIBOR (the rate of interest at which major banks in
London will lend to each other).Once determined,the rate would then be ﬁxed for the appropriate
time interval, e.g. six months.
In many ways, FRNs are similar to short-term money market instruments, such as bank
deposits,in that the interest rate is variable.However,the rate is not quite as variable,because once
determined it is ﬁxed for a period.As a result of this incomplete variability,a small amount of capital
risk persists (as opposed to bank deposits which exhibit no capital risk). If interest rates rise
subsequent to a coupon ﬁxing date, the ﬁxed rate will seem unattractive and the bond price will
fall below par.Conversely,a fall in interest rates would cause a small enhancement to the value of
the FRN.This might be looked upon in terms of the next coupon being subject to discounting.
Of course, the price variations would be much smaller than in the case of conventional fixed
coupon bonds.
Since at each coupon adjustment date the rate of coupon yield would be equated to the required
rate of return,and hence the rate of discount,the FRN will equal its par value on that date.As the
value of an FRN will be equal to par on the coupon adjustment date, the valuation of an FRN can
be carried out as if there were only two future cash ﬂows.These cash ﬂows are the next coupon
payment and the par value on the coupon adjustment date. If the coupon payment date coincides
with the coupon adjustment date, the equation for the value of an FRN would be:
P  C/(1r)T  B/(1r)T
where P is the price of the FRN, C is the next coupon, B is the par value of the FRN, r is the
rate of discount, and T is the period in years (normally a fraction of a year) to the next coupon
payment (and adjustment) date.
As the period for discounting (i.e.T) is short, normally less than six months, the price of a
ﬂoating rate note will have only limited sensitivity to changes in the rate of discount,and hence to
changes in the interest rate.This is in contrast to a conventional bond whose ﬁxed coupons and
repayment of principal involve long discount times and hence high sensitivity to interest rate
movements.
SWAP PRICING
One way in which an interest rate (ﬁxed for ﬂoating) swap can be valued is to treat the ﬁxed rate
payments as being equivalent to the cash flows on a conventional bond and the floating rate

payments as being equivalent to a ﬂoating rate note (FRN).Although an interest rate swap does
not entail an exchange of principal at maturity, the correspondence to a bond and FRN can be
completed by evoking a hypothetical exchange of principal at maturity whereby the two
counterparties give each other the same amount of money in the same currency.
The value of the swap could be expressed as the value of the bond minus the value of the FRN.
That is:
V  B1  B2
(1)
where V is the value of the swap, B1 is the value of the bond, and B2 is the value of the ﬂoating
rate note.
The value of the bond is given by:
B1  
n
ke
i1
Ri.Ti  Qe Rn.Tn
(2)
where k is the periodic ﬁxed payment in the swap,Q is the principal sum,R the discount rates,
and T the corresponding time periods to the cash ﬂows. Equation (2) states that the value of the
bond is the present value of the future ﬁxed payment receipts plus the present value of the principal
sum.The value of the bond is the discounted value of the future cash ﬂows.
The value of the ﬂoating rate note is:
B2  k*e R1.T1  Qe R1.T1
(3)
where k* is the next coupon payment and Q is the principal sum, while R1 and T1 are the
(annualised) interest rate and length of time to the next coupon payment (next coupon
reassessment date). Only the next coupon reassessment date is relevant for discounting purposes
since FRNs tend to revert to their par values on the coupon reassessment dates.This is because
coupon rates on FRNs are set equal to the required rates of return,which are the relevant discount
rates. Equation (3) states that the value of the FRN is the discounted value of the next coupon
payment plus the discounted value of the principal sum where there is just one period to the receipt
of the cash ﬂows.
CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
Interest rate risk is not the only risk involved when investing in bonds.There is also credit risk,
which is the risk that the issuer of a bond will default on payments or that the bond will receive a
downgrade in its credit rating.Credit default swaps allow an investor to transfer the credit risk to
an insurer whilst continuing to hold the bonds.
Credit default swaps are a form of insurance against default.The bondholder pays a regular
premium to the insurer for a speciﬁed period. If there is no default during that period, nothing
more happens. If the bond does default (or receives a credit rating downgrade), the insurer buys
the bond from the investor for a pre-agreed price. If the swap agreement lasts for the life of the
bond, the pre-agreed purchase price is likely to be the nominal value of the bond.
BOND AND INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS
824

INTEREST RATE SWAPS
825
The premium paid for this insurance will be equal to (or related to) the default premium
component of the bond yield. Bonds, other than government bonds, will incorporate some
compensation for default risk in their rates of yield.This is normally quoted as a yield spread
relative to the yield on government bonds. It is this yield spread that determines the payments to
be made by the investor to the insurer.Typically the payments equal the monetary value of the yield
spread. If the bonds had a value of £10 million, and if the yield spread were 1.2% p.a. (i.e. 120
basis points),the payments would amount to £120,000 per year (£120,000 is 1.2% of £10 million).
Default, or credit downgrading, would normally lead to the insurer buying the bond at the
agreed price.Alternatively the insurer pays the bondholder a sum of money that matches the loss,
in value of the bond, resulting from the default or credit downgrade. In some cases the
compensatory cash ﬂows are not based on a particular bond, but are based on credit risk indices
which indicate the average credit risk of a class of bonds.An index may, for example, be based on
the credit risk of 100 bonds of a particular type.If there were a default of one out of the hundred,
each insured investor would receive a payment of about 1% of the value insured (assuming an
equally weighted index).This may be convenient for hedging the credit risk of bond portfolios.
CONCLUSION
Previous chapters looked at futures,forwards,and options as instruments for managing risk.This
chapter has examined the other major form of derivative,the swap.Swaps are similar to a sequence
of futures or forward contracts.Their relative advantage is that they typically cover risks further
into the future than futures and forwards can. However they lack flexibility such that the
commitments to future cash ﬂows are difﬁcult to cancel.Futures offer ﬂexibility as to terminating
(closing out) contracts and options provide ﬂexibility as to whether cash ﬂows will take place
(but at the cost of premiums to be paid).
