Get to know 
MECHATRONICS 
AND ROBOTICS 
ENGINEERING
Mechatronics is the combination of 
mechanical, electrical and computer 
engineering in the design of products 
and manufacturing processes.
Robotics is a subset of mechatronics 
– all robots are mechatronic!
Robotics, however, are an elevated
class of mechatronics, incorporating 
automation, programming, and even 
autonomous action.
As automation and autonomous 
machines become increasingly 
important in our society, robotics – 
and its parent discipline, mechatronics 
– are more vital than ever.
