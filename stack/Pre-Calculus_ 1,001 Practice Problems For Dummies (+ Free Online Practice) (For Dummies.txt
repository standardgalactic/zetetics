Introduction
P

re-calculus is a rather difficult topic to define or describe. There’s a little bit of this, a lot 
of that, and a smattering of something else. But you need the mathematics considered 
to be pre-calculus to proceed to what changed me into a math major: calculus! Yes, believe it 
or not, I started out as a biology major — inspired by my high school biology teacher. Then 
I got to the semester where I was taking invertebrate zoology, chemistry, and calculus (yes, 
all at the same time). All of a sudden, there was a bright light! An awakening! “So this is what 
mathematics can be!” Haven’t turned back since. Calculus did it for me, and my great prepa­
ration for calculus made the adventure wonderful.
Pre-calculus contains a lot of algebra, some trigonometry, some geometry, and some ana­
lytic geometry. These topics all get tied together, mixed up, and realigned until out pops the 
mathematics you’ll use when working with calculus. I keep telling my calculus students that 
“calculus is 60 percent algebra.” Maybe my figures are off a bit, but believe me, you can’t 
succeed in calculus without a good background in algebra (and trigonometry). The geom­
etry is very helpful, too.
Why would you do 1,001 pre-calculus problems? Because practice makes perfect. Unlike other 
subjects where you can just read or listen and absorb the information sufficiently, mathematics 
takes practice. The only way to figure out how the different algebraic and trigonometric rules 
work and interact with one another, or how measurements in degrees and radians fit into the 
big picture, is to get into the problems — get your hands dirty, so to speak. Many problems 
given here may appear to be the same on the surface, but different aspects and challenges 
have been inserted to make them unique. The concepts become more set in your mind when 
you work with the problems and have your solutions confirm the properties.
What You’ll Find
This book contains 1,001 pre-calculus problems, their answers, and complete solutions to 
each. There are 16 problem chapters, and each chapter has many different sets of ques­
tions. The sets of questions are sometimes in a logical, sequential order, going from one part 
of a topic to the next and then to the next. Or sometimes the sets of questions represent 
the different ways a topic can be presented. In any case, you’ll get instructions on doing 
the problems. And sometimes you’ll get a particular formula or format to use. Feel free to 
refer to other mathematics books, such as Yang Kuang and Elleyne Kase’s Pre-Calculus For 
Dummies, my Algebra II For Dummies, or my Trigonometry For Dummies (all published by 
Wiley) for even more ideas on how to solve some of the problems.
Instead of just having answers to the problems, you’ll find a worked-out solution for each and 
every one. Flip to the last chapter of this book for the step-by-step processes needed to solve 
the problems. The solutions include verbal explanations inserted in the work where neces­
sary. Sometimes, the explanation may offer an alternate procedure. Not everyone does alge­
bra and trigonometry problems exactly the same way, but this book tries to provide the most 
understandable and success-promoting process to use when solving the problems presented.

1,001 Pre-Calculus Practice Problems For Dummies 
How This Workbook Is Organized
This workbook is divided into two main parts: questions and answers. But you probably 
figured that out already.
Part I: The Questions
The chapters containing the questions cover many different topics:
)>>
✓)>>Review of basic algebraic processes: Chapters 1 and 2 contain problems on basic 
algebraic rules and formulas, solving many types of equations and inequalities, and 
interpreting and using very specific mathematical notation correctly. They thoroughly 
cover functions and function properties, with a segue into trigonometric functions.
)>>
✓)>>Graphing functions and transformations of functions: Functions and properties of 
functions are a big part of pre-calculus and calculus. You work with operations on func­
tions, including compositions. These operations translate into transformations. And 
all this comes together when you look at the graphs of the functions. Transformations 
of functions help you see the similarities and differences in basic mathematical 
models — and the practice problems help you see how all this can save you a lot of 
time in the end.
)>>
✓)>>Polynomial functions: Some of the more familiar algebraic functions are the polynomi­
als. The graphs of polynomials are smooth, rolling curves. Their characteristics include 
where they cross the axes and where they make their turns from moving upward to 
moving downward or vice versa. You get to practice your equation-solving techniques 
when determining the x-intercepts and y-intercept of polynomial functions.
)>>
✓)>>Exponential and logarithmic functions: You’re not in Kansas anymore, so it’s time to 
leave the world of algebraic functions and open your eyes to other types: exponential 
and logarithmic, to name two. You practice the operations specific to these types of 
functions and see how one is the inverse of the other. The applications of these func­
tions are closer to real-world than most others in earlier chapters.
)>>
✓)>>Trigonometric functions: Trigonometric functions take being different one step fur­
ther. You’ll see how the input values for these functions have to be angle measures, 
not just any old numbers. The trig functions have their own rules, too, and lots of 
ways to interact, called identities. Solving trig identities helps you prepare for that 
most exciting process in calculus, where you get to find the area under a trigonomet­
ric curve. So keep your eye on that goal! And the trig applications are some of my 
favorite — all so easy to picture (and draw) and to solve.
)>>
✓)>>Complex numbers and polar coordinates: Complex numbers were created; no, they 
aren’t real or natural. Mathematicians needed to solve problems whose solutions 
were the square roots of negative numbers, so they adopted the imaginary number i 
to accomplish this task. Performing operations on complex numbers and finding com­
plex solutions are a part of this general arena. Polar coordinates are a way of graphing 
curves by using angle measures and radii. You open up a whole new world of curves 
when you practice with these problems dealing with polar graphs.
)>>
✓)>>Conic sections: A big family of curves belongs in the classification of conics. You find 
the similarities and differences between circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas. 
Exercises have you write the standard forms of the equations so you can better deter­
mine individual characteristics and create reasonable sketches of the graphs of the 
curves.

3
 Introduction 
)>>
✓)>>Systems of equations and inequalities: When you have two or more statements or 
equations and want to know whether any solutions are common to both or all of them 
at the same time, you’re talking about solving systems. The equations can be linear, 
quadratic, exponential, and so on. You’ll use algebraic techniques and also use matri­
ces to solve some of the linear systems.
)>>
✓)>>Sequences and series: Some problems cover the basic arithmetic and geometric 
series. And, as a huge bonus, you’ll use the binomial theorem and Pascal’s triangle to 
expand binomials to fairly high powers.
)>>
✓)>>Limits and continuity: The basics of limits and continuity are covered — analytically 
and graphically. This point is actually the launching spot for calculus — where pre-
calculus finishes, calculus begins.
Part II: The Answers
This part provides not only the answers to all the questions but also explanations of the 
answers. So you get the solution, and you see how to arrive at that solution.
Beyond the Book
This book is chock-full of pre-calculus goodness, but maybe you want to track your progress 
as you tackle the problems. Or maybe you’re stuck on a few particularly challenging types 
of pre-calculus problems and wish they were all presented in one place where you could 
methodically make your way through them. No problem! Your book purchase comes with 
a free one-year subscription to all 1,001 practice problems online. Track your progress and 
view personalized reports that show where you need to study the most. And then do it. 
Study what, where, when, and how you want.
What you’ll find online
The online practice that comes free with this book offers you the same 1,001 questions and 
answers that are available here, presented in a multiple-choice format. The beauty of the 
online problems is that you can customize your online practice to focus on the topic areas 
that give you the most trouble. So if you aren’t yet a whiz at exponential and logarithmic 
functions, you can select these problem types and BAM! — just those types of problems 
appear for your solving pleasure. Or, if you’re short on time but want to get a mixed bag of 
a limited number of problems, you can plug in the quantity of problems you want to prac­
tice and that many — or few — of a variety of pre-calculus problems appears. Whether you 
practice a couple hundred problems in one sitting or a couple dozen, or whether you focus 
on a few types of problems or practice every type, the online program keeps track of the 
questions you get right and wrong so that you can monitor your progress and spend time 
studying exactly what you need.
You can access this online tool by using a PIN code, as described in the next section. Keep 
in mind that you can create only one login with your PIN. After the PIN is used, it’s no longer

Where to Go for Additional Help
The written directions given with the individual problems are designed to tell you what 
you need to do to get the correct answer. Sometimes the directions may seem vague if you 
aren’t familiar with the words or the context of the words. Go ahead and look at the solution 
to see whether it helps you with the meaning. But if the vocabulary is still unrecognizable, 
you may want to refer to Pre-Calculus For Dummies, Algebra II For Dummies, or Trigonometry 
For Dummies, all published by the fine folks at Wiley.
You may not be able to follow a particular solution from one step to the next. Is something 
missing? This book is designed to provide you with enough practice to become very effi­
cient in pre-calculus topics, but it isn’t intended to give the step-by-step explanation of how 
and why each step is necessary. You may need to refer to the books listed in the preceding

 Introduction 
paragraph or their corresponding workbooks to get more background on a problem or to 
understand why a particular step is taken in the solution of the problem.
Some pre-calculus topics are sometimes seen as being a bunch of rules without a particular 
purpose. Why do you have to solve for the exponent of that equation? Where will you use 
the fact that tan2 x + 1 = sec2 x? All these questions are more apparent when you see them 
tied together and when more background information is available. Don’t be shy about seek­
ing out that kind of information. And all this practice will pay off when you begin your first 
calculus experience. It may even be with Mark Ryan’s Calculus For Dummies!

Chapter 2
Solving Some Equations 
and Inequalities
T

he object of solving equations and inequalities is to discover which number or numbers 
will create a true statement in the given expression. The main techniques you use to 
find such solutions include factoring, applying the multiplication property of zero, creat­
ing sign lines, finding common denominators, and squaring both sides of an equation. Your 
challenge is to determine which techniques work in a particular problem and whether you 
have a correct solution after applying those techniques.

Chapter 3
Function Basics
A

function is a special type of rule or relationship. The difference between a function 
and a relation is that a function has exactly one output value (from the range) for 
every input value (from the domain). Functions are very useful when you’re describing 
trends in business, heights of objects shot from a cannon, times required to complete a 
task, and so on. Functions have some special properties and operations that allow for inves­
tigation into what happens when you change the rule.

Chapter 4
Graphing and Transforming Functions
Y

ou can graph functions fairly handily using a graphing calculator, but you’ll be frustrated 
using this technology if you don’t have a good idea of what you’ll find and where you’ll 
find it. You need to have a fairly good idea of how high or how low and how far left and right 
the graph extends. You get information on these aspects of a graph from the intercepts (where 
the curve crosses the axes), from any asymptotes (in rational functions), and, of course, 
from the domain and range of the function. A good working knowledge of the characteristics 
of different types of functions goes a long way toward making your graphing experience a 
success.
Another way of graphing functions is to recognize any transformations performed on basic 
function definitions. Just sliding a graph to the left or right or flipping the graph over a line 
is a lot easier than starting from scratch.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you’ll work with function graphs in the following ways:
)>>
✓)>>Graphing both a function and its inverse
)>>
✓)>>Determining the vertices of quadratic functions (parabolas)
)>>
✓)>>Recognizing the limits of some radical functions when graphing
)>>
✓)>>Pointing out the top or bottom point of an absolute-value function graph to establish 
its range
)>>
✓)>>Solving polynomial equations for intercepts
)>>
✓)>>Writing equations of the asymptotes of rational functions
)>>
✓)>>Using function transformations to quickly graph variations on functions
What to Watch Out For
When graphing functions, your challenges include the following:
)>>
✓)>>Taking advantage of alternate formats of function equations (slope-intercept form, 
factored polynomial or rational functions, and so on)
)>>
✓)>>Determining whether a parabola opens upward or downward and how steeply

Chapter 5
Polynomials
P

olynomial functions have graphs that are smooth curves. They go from negative infinity 
to positive infinity in a nice, flowing fashion with no abrupt changes of direction. Pieces 
of polynomial functions are helpful when modeling physical situations, such as the height of a 
rocket shot in the air or the time a person takes to swim a lap depending on his or her age.
Most of the focus on polynomial functions is in determining when the function changes 
from negative values to positive values or vice versa. Also of interest is when the curve hits 
a relatively high point or relatively low point. Some good algebra techniques go a long way 
toward studying these characteristics of polynomial functions.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
E

xponential and logarithmic functions go together. You wouldn’t think so at first glance, 
because exponential functions can look like 
, and logarithmic (log) functions 
can look like 
. What joins them together is that exponential functions and log 
functions are inverses of each other.
Exponential and logarithmic functions can have bases that are any positive number except 
the number 1. The special cases are those with base 10 (common logarithms) and base e 
(natural logarithms), which go along with their exponential counterparts.
The whole point of these functions is to tell you how large something is when you use a 
particular exponent or how big of an exponent you need in order to create a particular 
number. These functions are heavily used in the sciences and finance, so studying them 
here can pay off big time in later studies.

Trigonometry Basics
T

rigonometric functions are special in several ways. The first characteristic that separates 
them from all the other types of functions is that input values are always angle measures. 
You input an angle measure, and the output is some real number. The angle measures can 
be in degrees or radians — a degree being one-360th of a slice of a circle, and a radian being 
about one-sixth of a circle. Each type has its place and use in the study of trigonometry.
Another special feature of trig functions is their periodicity; the function values repeat over and 
over and over, infinitely. This predictability works well with many types of physical phenomena, 
so trigonometric functions serve as models for many naturally occurring observations.

Graphing Trig Functions
T

he graphs of trigonometric functions are usually easily recognizable — after you become 
familiar with the basic graph for each function and the possibilities for transformations of 
the basic graphs.
Trig functions are periodic. That is, they repeat the same function values over and over, so 
their graphs repeat the same curve over and over. The trick is to recognize how often this 
curve repeats and where one of the basic graphs starts for a particular function.
An interesting feature of four of the trig functions is that they have asymptotes — those not-
really-there lines used as guides to the shape of a curve. The sine and cosine functions don’t 
have asymptotes, because their domains are all real numbers. The other four functions 
have vertical asymptotes to mark where their domains have gaps.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you’ll work with the graphs of trigonometric functions in the following ways:
)>>
✓)>>Marking any intercepts on the x-axis to help graph the curves
)>>
✓)>>Locating and drawing in vertical asymptotes for the tangent, cotangent, secant, and 
cosecant functions
)>>
✓)>>Computing the change in the period of a function based on some transformation
)>>
✓)>>Adjusting the amplitude of the sine or cosine when the basic curve has a multiplier
)>>
✓)>>Making sideways moves when transformations involve horizontal translations
)>>
✓)>>Moving trig functions upward or downward with vertical translations
What to Watch Out For
When graphing trigonometric functions, some challenges will include

✓)>>Not misreading the period of the trig function when a transformation involves 
a fraction
)>>
✓)>>Drawing enough full cycles of the curve to show its characteristics properly

D

on’t have an identity crisis! In this chapter, you become more familiar with the possibilities 
for rewriting trigonometric expressions. A trig identity is really an equivalent expres­
sion or form of a function that you can use in place of the original. The equivalent format 
may make factoring easier, solving an application possible, and (later) performing an opera­
tion in calculus more manageable.
The trigonometric identities are divided into many different classifications. These groupings help 
you remember the identities and make determining which identity to use in a particular substitu­
tion easier. In a classic trig identity problem, you try to make one side of the equation match the 
other side. The best way to do so is to work on just one side — the left or the right — but some­
times you need to work on both sides to see just how to work the problem to the end.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you’ll work with the basic trigonometric identities in the following ways:
)>>
✓)>>Determining which trig functions are reciprocals of one another
)>>
✓)>>Creating Pythagorean identities from a right triangle whose hypotenuse measures 1 unit

✓)>>Determining the sign of identities whose angle measure is negated
)>>
✓)>>Matching up trig functions and their co-functions
)>>
✓)>>Using the periods of functions in identities
)>>
✓)>>Making the most of selected substitutions into identities
)>>
✓)>>Working on only one side of the identity
)>>
✓)>>Figuring out where to go with an identity by working both sides at once
What to Watch Out For
Don’t let common mistakes trip you up; keep in mind that when working on trigonometric 
identities, some challenges will include the following:
)>>
✓)>>Keeping track of where the 1 goes in the Pythagorean identities

he basic trig identities (see Chapter 9) will get you through most problems and applications 
involving trigonometry. But if you’re going to broaden your horizons and study more 
and more mathematics, you’ll find the additional identities in this chapter crucial to your 
success. Also, in some of the sciences, especially physics, these specialized identities come 
up in the most unlikely (and likely) places.
These trigonometric identities are broken into groups, depending on whether you’re trying 
to combine angles or split them apart, increase exponents or reduce them, and so on. 
The groupings can help you to decide which identity to use in which situation. Keep a list 
of these identities handy, because you’ll want to refer to them as you work through the 
problems.

ou may think that you’re “not in Kansas anymore” when you leave the familiar world 
of right triangles and Mr. Pythagoras to enter this new world of oblique triangles. 
Trigonometry allows for some calculations that aren’t possible with the geometric formu­
las and other types of measurement. The Law of Sines and Law of Cosines are relationships 
between the sides and angles of triangles that aren’t right triangles.
The applications you can solve using these new laws are many and varied. Whole new 
worlds are opened to you now that you don’t have triangle-type restrictions. The biggest 
challenge is in deciding which law to use, but even that is pretty straightforward.

Chapter 12
Complex Numbers and 
Polar Coordinates
C

omplex numbers are unreal. Yes, that’s the truth. A complex number has a term with a 
multiple of i, and i is the imaginary number equal to 
. Many of the algebraic rules 
that apply to real numbers also apply to complex numbers, but you have to be careful because 
many rules are different for these numbers. The problems in this chapter will help you under­
stand their particular properties.
You’ll also work on graphing complex numbers. Polar coordinates are quite different from 
the usual (x, y) points on the Cartesian coordinate system. Polar coordinates bring together 
both angle measures and distances, all in one neat package. With the polar coordinate 
system, you can graph curves that resemble flowers and hearts and other elegant shapes.

Conic Sections
C

onic sections can be described or illustrated with exactly what their name suggests: 
cones. Imagine an orange cone in the street, steering you in the right direction. Then 
picture some clever highway engineer placing one cone on top of the other, tip to tip. That 
engineer is trying to demonstrate how you can create conic sections (well, perhaps I stretch 
this a bit).
If you come along and slice one of those cones parallel to the ground, the cut edges form a 
circle. Slice the cone on an angle, and you have an ellipse. Slice the cone parallel to one of 
the sides, and you have a parabola. And, finally, slice through both cones together, perpen­
dicular to the ground, and you have a hyperbola. If these descriptions just don’t work for 
you, the problems in this chapter will certainly do the trick.

Chapter 14
Systems of Equations 
and Inequalities
A

system of equations is a collection of two or more equations involving two or more 
variables. If the number of equations is equal to the number of different variables, 
then you may be able to find a unique solution that’s common to all the equations. Having 
the correct number of variables isn’t a guarantee that you’ll have that solution, and it’s not 
terrible if a unique solution doesn’t exist; sometimes you just write a rule to represent the 
many solutions shared by the equations in the collection.
A system of inequalities has an infinite number of solutions (unless it has none at all). You 
solve these systems using graphs of the separate statements.
The techniques for solving these systems involve algebraic manipulation and/or matrices 
and matrix mathematics. Lots of practice using these techniques is available here. When 
you’re solving your own systems, the approach you use is up to you.

Sequences and Series
A

sequence is a list of items; in mathematics, a sequence usually consists of numbers 
such as 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . or 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . See the patterns in these two sequences? 
That’s part of what this chapter is about: finding patterns in lists of numbers so you can 
write the rest of the numbers in the list.
A series is the sum of a list of numbers, such as 1 + 2 + 4 + 8. Many times, you can find a for­
mula to help you add up the numbers in a series. Formulas are especially helpful when you 
have a lot of numbers to add or if they’re fractions or alternating negative and positive.
You can classify many sequences and series by type, which helps you determine particular 
terms or sums. Recognize the type, and you’re pretty much home free when doing your 
calculations.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you’ll work on sequences and series in the following ways:

✓)>>Finding a particular term in a sequence when given the general formula

✓)>>Generating terms by using the binomial theorem

and series, some challenges will include
)>>
✓)>>Correctly formulating terms in a sequence by using the order of operations

Part I: The Questions 

Chapter 16
Introducing Limits and Continuity
“W

hat’s the limit on this road?” “The sky’s the limit.” “We need to introduce term 
limits.” “Have you reached your limit?” People talk about limits in many ways. 
In mathematics, a limit suggests that you’re approaching some value. Some functions, such 
as a rational function with a horizontal asymptote, have a limit as the x values move toward 
positive or negative infinity — that is, as the value of x gets very small or very large. Limits 
are another way of describing the characteristics of particular functions.
Although limits are often demonstrated graphically (a picture is worth a thousand words?), 
you can describe limits more precisely using algebra. In this chapter, you find examples of 
both techniques.
Coupled with limits is the concept of continuity — whether a function is defined for all real 
numbers or not. Investigating a function’s continuity (or lack thereof) is part of this chapter.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you’ll work on limits and continuity in the following ways:
)>>
✓)>>Looking at graphs for information on a function’s limits
)>>
✓)>>Using analytic techniques to investigate limits
)>>
✓)>>Performing algebraic operations to solve for a function’s limits
)>>
✓)>>Determining where a function is continuous
)>>
✓)>>Searching for any removable discontinuities
What to Watch Out For
When you’re working with limits and continuity, some challenges include the following:
)>>
✓)>>Recognizing a function’s behavior at negative infinity or positive infinity
)>>
✓)>>Using the correct technique for an analytic look at limits
)>>
✓)>>Factoring correctly when investigating limits algebraically
)>>
✓)>>Using the correct conjugates in algebraic procedures
)>>
✓)>>Forgetting that the “removable” part of a removable discontinuity doesn’t really change 
a function’s continuity; a function with a removable discontinuity is not continuous

positive real roots is 0. (Remember, x5 has a positive sign even though the plus sign 
isn’t written.)
To find the possible number of negative real roots, find 
 and count the number of 
sign changes from term to term. The number of negative roots is equal to the changes 
in sign for

There’s a sign change between each pair of terms, so there are five changes in sign.

Synthetic division works only when a polynomial is divided by a linear factor and when 
the coefficient of the linear factor is 1. If 
 is a factor of the polynomial, then x = n is 
a zero of the polynomial, and if x = n is a zero, then 
 is a factor.
In this case, 
 may be a factor of 
, so x = –5 may be a zero. Therefore, 
write –5 on the outside of the synthetic division sign. Write the coefficients of the poly­
nomial on the inside. Here’s the process, step by step:
1.)>> Drop the 1 from the coefficient line to below the division line.
2.)>> Multiply 1 by –5 to get –5 and write that under the 6.
3.)>> Add

5.琀Add

amount is the remainder.
The first two numbers under the line are the coefficients of the quotient. The answer is

Therefore, write 4 on the outside of the synthetic division sign. Write the coefficients of 
the polynomial on the inside. Here’s the process, step by step:
1.)>> Drop the 2 from the coefficient line to below the division line.
2.)>> Multiply 4 by 2 to get 8 and write that under the –13.

other two sides added together. So if two of the sides of the triangle are 9 and 17, the 
third side can be any length between and including 9 and 25. This is assuming, of

You can divide the regular octagon into eight congruent triangles. Find the area of one 
of the triangles and multiply by 8.
Each triangle in the octagon has an angle at the center measuring 45°. Dividing a tri­
angle in half at that center, you have a right triangle with an angle of 22.5° and opposite 
side measuring 4 yards. Use the tangent of 22.5° to solve for the adjacent side of the 
triangle, h:
Now find the area of one of the eight triangles, which has a base of 8 yards and a height 
of 9.6569 yards:
So the area of the entire octagon is 8 times that area:
You could do this problem using Heron’s formula, which involves finding the length of 
one of the segments drawn from the center to a vertex of the octagon. That process 
would involve using the square root. You could also use the trig formula involving the 
sine of the angle and measures of two sides — the height and the segment to the vertex. 
That one is too much work. The method that uses right triangles seems to be the easi­
est. And, finally, if you have the formula in your back pocket, you can find the area of 
any regular polygon using 
, where the apothem is the 
height of the triangle. So many choices!

About the Author
Mary Jane Sterling is the author of six For Dummies titles: Algebra I For Dummies, 
Algebra II For Dummies, Trigonometry For Dummies, Math Word Problems For Dummies, 
Business Math For Dummies, and Linear Algebra For Dummies (all published by Wiley). 
She has also written many supplements — workbooks and study aids.
Mary Jane has been teaching at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, for 35 years and 
loves hearing from former students. She still remembers her favorite student evaluation 
remark: “Mrs. Sterling is way too excited about mathematics.” Yes!
Dedication
I dedicate this book to my friends and colleagues — current and former — at Bradley 
University. The feeling of community at this institution is unique and has made my 
tenure there a delight.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I issue a big thank you to project editor Georgette Beatty, who has taken on the huge 
challenge of pulling together this project. She has been a delight to work with — always 
upbeat and helpful. Thank you so much for your hard work and patience. Also, another 
big salute with sincere appreciation goes to the copy editors, Megan Knoll and Danielle 
Voirol. Their thoroughness and attention to detail help make for a polished product.
And, of course, a heartfelt thank you to the technical editors, Mark Kannowski and 
Becky Moening. As much as I try to check the problems carefully, there is always that 
chance of a silly error. The editors keep me honest!
As always, a grateful thank you to acquisitions editor Lindsay Lefevere, who again found 
me another interesting project.
