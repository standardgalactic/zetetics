Information is a change in a quantum state due to the modification of one degree of freedom from 
the considered quantum system moreover a quantum state is completely determined by only 
knowing the answers to all of the possible yes/no questions”, a yes/no question is presumably a 
selfadjoint operator with two distinct eigenvalues acting on the Hilbert space of Koopman van 
Neumann wave functions viewed as observable.  
Axiomatic Definition of Quantum Information:  
Let H be a Hilbert space of Koopman-van Neumann wave functions, and O a self-adjoint operator on 
H representing a yes/no question.  
  
Axiom 1: A quantum state ψ in H is completely characterized by the set of answers to all possible 
yes/no questions. That is, by the expectation values of all self-adjoint operators on H.  
  
Mathematically, ψ is determined by:  
⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ for all O  
where O ranges over all self-adjoint operators on H.  
  
Axiom 2: Information is quantified by the change in a quantum state due to the modification in one 
degree of freedom of the quantum system.  
  
Mathematically, if ψ evolves to ψ′ due to a change in a degree of freedom (e.g., by a unitary 
transformation U or some other quantum operation), then the "information" I associated with this 
change can be quantified by:  
(ψ, ψ′) = δ(⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ − ⟨ψ′|O|ψ′⟩)  
for some measure of difference δ and for a relevant set of operators O.  
  
Axiom 3: A yes/no question in quantum mechanics is represented by a self-adjoint operator O with 
two distinct eigenvalues. Without loss of generality, we can take these eigenvalues to be +1 (for 
"yes") and -1 (for "no").  
  
This means that the spectral decomposition of O is:  
𝑂 = 𝜆+ |ϕ+⟩ ⟨ϕ+| + λ− |ϕ−⟩ ⟨ϕ−|  
where 𝜆+=+1, λ− =−1 and ∣ϕ+⟩ and ∣ϕ−⟩  are the eigenvectors associated with these eigenvalues.  
  

"information" is essentially the difference in the quantum expectation values of relevant observables 
due to changes in the quantum state.  
  
Information as a Difference in Expectation Values:  
Now, consider a quantum system initially in state |ψ⟩. Suppose its state changes to |ψ′⟩ due to some 
process. If we compute the expectation value of an observable O before and after the change, the 
difference.  
Δ = ⟨ψ′|O|ψ′⟩ − ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩  
represents how our 'typical' outcome (or prediction) for a measurement of O changes due to the 
evolution of the quantum state.  
  
In the context of the statement, this difference Δ is seen as the "information" gained or lost due to 
the change in the state.   
If the expectation value remains unchanged (Δ =0), then from the perspective of the observable O, no 
information about the system's evolution has been gained.   
On the other hand, if Δ is significant, we've gained some information about the system's evolution by 
noting how the outcomes of O are expected to change.  
  
In essence, observing how the expected outcomes of measurements (quantified by expectation 
values) change as the state evolves gives us information about the nature and effects of the processes 
causing the evolution.
