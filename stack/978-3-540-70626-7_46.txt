De Broglie Wavelength (λ = h/p)
Bruce R. Wheaton
Initially a thought in the thesis of young Louis de Broglie in 1923 for his doctor-
ate from the Sorbonne. Attempting to reconcile special relativity with the quantum
transformation relation (QTR), de Broglie assumed a hypothetical “phase wave”
traveling faster than light that guides the physical displacement of an  electron (see
 matter waves). In the thesis he derived its putative wavelength in the degenerate
case of dipole oscillation, equal to  Planck’s constant divided by the momentum
of the linearly oscillating particle; at the same time deriving the action-integral rep-
resentation of the  Bohr atom’s orbital states by forcing every elliptical orbit to
contain an integral number of phase wavelengths, as in Fig. 1.
With de Broglie, others (Einstein  light-quantum, Schr¨odinger  wave
mechanics and Dirac  QED) recognized the generality of the de Broglie wave

representation to all micro-processes of matter, conﬁrming a missing permutation
of matter with light in  wave-particle duality. Some of the most important precur-
sors to λ = h/p were, in fact, concerns about the apparent  light-quantum behavior
of high-frequency X- and γ-rays.
Although the de Broglie wavelength, which predicted the electron diffraction
found in 1927, applies only on the most microscopic level, it lately has come to
have practical consequences. At extremely low temperatures (<10−9 ◦K achieved by
evaporative cooling) the  wave packet of particles increase in wavelength, spread,
and combine with others producing a sea of undifferentiated bosons ( Bose–
Einstein statistics) (rather than the non-fungible fermions ( Fermi-Dirac statistics)
they may have started as) in what is called a  “Bose–Einstein condensate” or BEC.
It has a macroscopic de Broglie wavelength (up to 30 μm so it can actually be pho-
tographed with visible light) because the entire assemblage of millions of atoms
functions as a single  wave function. See Fig. 2.
On the down-slope approach to this transition from atomic to Bosonic hierar-
chy lie  superconductivity,  superﬂuidity, the lowest temperatures yet attained
and a demonstrated matter-wave “laser” (masem?) One of the most remarkable
characteristics of a BEC is its phenomenally large effective group index of re-
fraction (νg ≈di/dν so slows by as much as 10−8) which, in almost stopping an
incident light beam, may lead to information storage in un-heard of density albeit

“quintessential” new state of matter.
