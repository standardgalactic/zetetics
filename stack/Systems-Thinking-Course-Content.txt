About
The Institute for Augmented Intelligence in Entrepreneurship, Engineering, 
and Management (EEM Institute) is engaged in strengthening the intelligence of its 
graduates so that they can quickly navigate future projects and be successful there. 
For that reason, the "Open-endedness" educational program has been developed. 
Please read below one of the program course's content.

6. How to Define Systems
6 Systems thinkin 
6 Transdisciplinarit!
6 Three main kinds of system 
breakdown definitio#
6 Functional analysis and modular 
synthesi/
6 One system, but many views, many 
names: that's okay
6 Variants of system breakdown/
6 The non-equivalence between the 
functional and product breakdowns of 
the system

and modular synthesi/
6 Alphas and artifacts/product/

meta-model/
