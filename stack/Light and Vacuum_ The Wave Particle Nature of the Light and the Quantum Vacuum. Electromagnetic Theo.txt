Prologue
Throughout this book, we give the main principles of the electromag-
netic theory and quantum electrodynamics (QED), both developed
for the understanding of light’s nature and for the explanation of the
associated phenomena when interacting with matter. Of course, it is
not in the scope of this manuscript to give a full and detailed presen-
tation of these theories. Only selected theoretical topics have been
chosen, supported by experimental evidence, which are indispensable
for the understanding of the present status of the theories on the
nature of light. The chapters of the book follow a well-deﬁned scheme
in order to provide the reader the necessary knowledge for under-
standing the wave and particle concepts of the light as well as the
advanced elaborations and the associated problematics at the end.
After the introduction and historical survey the Chapter 3
resumes Maxwell’s electromagnetic wave theory while Chapter 4
introduces the fundamentals of quantum mechanics employed for the
description of the particle nature of light. In Chapter 5, we discuss the
main diﬃculties encountered by both theories, to ensure a complete
and coherent mathematical description of the simultaneous wave-
particle nature of light put in evidence by experiments.
Finally, in Chapter 6, we enhance beyond the standard description
the basic aspect of QED related to the quantization of the vector
potential amplitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld to a single photon
state, and we advance further on its relationship with the classical
electromagnetic wave theory and the vacuum.
The topics are all drawn from many works previously published,
and given in the bibliography. The perspectives and elaborations

on the photon vector potential and its relationship to the quantum
vacuum are of my own, in the aim to raise questions and aspire
for further theoretical and experimental investigation, in order to
improve our knowledge and understanding on the real essence of
light and vacuum.
Note: In this book, the word “light” is not limited to the visible
ﬁeld, but concerns the whole electromagnetic spectrum ranging from
zero frequency to inﬁnity.

Chapter 1
Introduction
“Light is the means nature employs to observe itself”.
Man has always been fascinated by light. Since the rise of humanity,
light is related to life and darkness to death. This concept seems to
have intrinsic roots in the human mind whatever the tribe or nation,
on any continent and during any historic or pre-historic period.
The natural entities emitting light, helping man and animals to
see while eliminating the fears of darkness, like the sun, the moon
and ﬁre were venerated since the beginning and the absolute divine
was associated with them. Man quickly understood that life, as it
is met on the surface of this planet, would be inexistent or at least
completely diﬀerent without light. The forests are the main lags of
the earth’s atmosphere contributing to the production and to the
recycling of oxygen, a so crucial for the life element. In the absence of
the sun’s light, plants, trees and forests are condemned to disappear
and consequently animals would be unable to survive.
Within a biological point of view, light is the basic medium of
nature conferring the possibility to organisms possessing an appro-
priate detection system, optical or not, to see or detect the shapes
of the objects of the surrounding cosmos. By the same token, light
is the means nature has chosen to watch itself by way of live beings.
The exchange of energy and information between atoms, molecules
and more complex systems occurs through light, permitting life to
emerge in the cosmos. This notion, once understood, automatically
attributes a unique character to light in the universe.
In the old historical times, light on earth was only emitted from
ﬁre, volcanic lava or high temperature metallic objects. Ancient
1

Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
Greeks had such a profound respect for light that the only origin
they could imagine was undoubtedly divine. In the Greek language,
light is Phos (Φωs). This one-syllable word has quite a strong and
deep consonance that used to be attributed only to exceptional phys-
ical entities, like Pyr (Πυρ) ﬁre, or even the head of the Gods, Zeus
(Zευs). Hence, according to the legend, Prometheus has stolen the
ﬁre from Gods in order to oﬀer light and heat to mankind. Disregard-
ing the fact if mankind was worthy of it, the value of the gift was
invaluable. For his action, Prometheus was punished by the Gods to
be attached on the Caucasian mountains where an eagle was eating
his liver in the day while it was regenerated during the night. The
character of this endless torture without any chance of forgiveness
or clemency gives witness to the extreme importance ancient Greeks
attributed to the stolen entity from the Gods, ﬁre. One simply has
to wonder what human civilization would be like without ﬁre.
Not surprisingly, in most religions God is identiﬁed with light.
However, light has an intrinsic nature and undergoes speciﬁc phys-
ical laws governing its behavior, and studied by science. Today, a
quite considerable progress has been done in order to understand
the behavior laws but our mathematical representation of its wave-
particle nature and its relationship to the vacuum is still incomplete.

Chapter 2
Historical Survey
and Experimental Evidence
The concepts of light during the last 2500 years: corpuscles, ray
optics, wave optics, electromagnetic wave theory and ﬁnally quan-
tum particle theory.
As far as we know, the ﬁrst attempts to study the nature of light
from the scientiﬁc point of view are due to ancient Greeks. They
believed light to be composed of corpuscles.
Thales of Miletus in the sixth century BC knew already that in a
given medium, light propagates in straight lines and that the light of
the sun also obeys that property. Based on that knowledge and using
his famous theorem, he measured the height of the Cheops pyramid
in Egypt by comparing the length of its shadow to that of his stick
positioned vertically.
About two centuries later, Euclid published the book “Optica”
in which, based on the rectilinear propagation of light, he developed
the laws of reﬂection by applying principles of geometry. Archimedes,
developed the geometrical study of parabolas and ellipsoids and,
according to the legend, he created big metallic mirrors for focusing
the sunlight in order to burn the Roman battle ships during the siege
of Syracuse. That was the ﬁrst time in human history that light was
employed as a weapon.
A couple of centuries later, in his book “Optics”, Ptolemy of
Alexandria made a full synthesis of all the previous knowledge on light
following the concepts of Euclid, Archimedes and Heron of Alexandria,
treating refraction, reﬂection and colors. Refraction of the moonlight
and sunlight by the earth’s atmosphere was also analyzed.

Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
Euclid’s “Optica” and Ptolemy’s “Optics” are the ﬁrst known sci-
entiﬁc publications on light’s properties. Only a fraction of “Optics”
has been saved, and this is thanks to Arab mathematicians of the
7th to 10th centuries AC.
After the dominance of Christians during the third century AC,
the ﬁrst Byzantine emperors ordered the deﬁnite closure and destruc-
tion of all Greek mathematical and philosophical academies that were
spread from Greece to Egypt through the Middle East. Philosophers
and scientists were persecuted and murdered preventing any possibil-
ity of scientiﬁc development for more than thirteen centuries. The last
one of them was Hypatia of Alexandria who has been assassinated
by a crowd of fanatic christians because she was woman, scientist
and philosopher.
Humanity had to wait until 1620 AC for Snell’s works on refrac-
tion and Fermat’s principle, according to which light rays travel along
the path of least time. It was at this period that many scientists like,
Grimaldi, Boyle, Hook, Descartes and others began studying light’s
properties.
Half a century later, in the year of 1670, Newton had retaken the
proposals of Pierre Gassendi, who had revived the ideas of ancient
Greeks, and advanced the theory that light rays are composed of cor-
puscles that travel rectilinearly. However, he went further beyond this
description by announcing that under speciﬁc physical conditions,
the light corpuscles may give birth to waves in “aether”, without giv-
ing it a precise deﬁnition. Surprisingly, in the ﬁrst edition of his book
“Opticks”, the light corpuscles and the generated “aether” waves
were replaced by particles submitted to a kind of “periodic relief”.
Parallel to Newton, in the year of 1680, Huygens developed a
remarkable wave theory for light, deducing the laws of reﬂection and
refraction while demonstrating that wave propagation may not be in
contradiction with the rectilinear propagation. Huygens’ wave theory
was a hard opponent to Newton’s particles concept.
In the beginning of the 19th century, Young’s experiments
demonstrated that interference can be obtained by diﬀerent waves,
while Fresnel applied the wave theory to explain the diﬀraction
patterns observed experimentally. Furthermore, Young explained

Historical Survey and Experimental Evidence
5
some polarization observations by making the hypothesis that light
oscillations are perpendicular to the propagation axis. Nevertheless,
not even a scientist could seriously consider the interference theory
and Young’s studies were berated by the journalists. Nearly twenty
years later, the diﬀraction theories of Young and Fresnel, though not
identical, were the only ones capable of predicting all the observed
diﬀraction patterns and that was really the crucial turnover point in
the 19th century following which the scientiﬁc community started to
generally accept the wave nature of light.
The wave theory was dominant until the beginning of 20th cen-
tury. It is worth noting that until that time, nearly for more than
2500 years, the main question for scientists was focused on the parti-
cle or the wave nature of light, but nobody had advanced any speciﬁc
questions on the real nature of light, i.e., a corpuscle made of what?
or a wave of what?
In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell published his remarkable work
on the electromagnetic waves issued from . . . Maxwell’s equations
describing the relations between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and
has shown that the electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuum at
the same speed observed by astronomers for light. For the ﬁrst time
the speed of light was related directly to the vacuum electric permit-
tivity and magnetic permeability showing the natural relationship
between light and vacuum. Just a few years later, Hertz discovered
the long wavelength electromagnetic radiation demonstrating that it
propagates at the speed of light conﬁrming Maxwell’s theory.
It is quite amazing in the history of science that Maxwell’s and
Hertz’s works, carried out within roughly ten years, were absolutely
revolutionary and decisive in our understanding about the nature of
light, which remained stationary for over 25 centuries.
At the same period, from 1880 to 1900, the works of Stefan, Wien
and Rayleigh have shown for the ﬁrst time the direct relationship
between the thermal radiation energy and the temperature of the
emitting body, assimilated to a black body. However, the emitted
radiation energy density of the black body as a function of the tem-
perature calculated by Rayleigh, failed to describe the experimental
results obtained at short wavelengths. Scientists had given the name

6
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
of “UV catastrophe” to this situation which revealed the necessity of
a new theoretical approach.
In the very beginning of the 20th century, Max Planck assumed
that the bodies are composed of “resonators”, a kind of oscillators
that have the particularity of emitting the electromagnetic energy in
packets of hν, thus proportional to the wave frequency ν times h, that
was later called Planck’s constant. This hypothesis permitted Planck
to establish the correct energy density expression for the radiation
emitting from a black body with respect to temperature, which is in
excellent agreement with the experiment.
In 1902, Lenard pointed out that the photoelectric eﬀect, discov-
ered by Hertz ﬁfteen years earlier, occurs beyond a threshold fre-
quency of light and the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons does
not depend on the incident light intensity.
The experiments carried out by Michelson and Morley demon-
strated that the speed of light in vacuum is a universal physical
constant. This fundamental discovery was the starting point for the
development of the theory of special relativity, based on Lorentz’s
set of equations followed by Poincare’s theoretical studies. Einstein
grouped all these works in an elaborated theory published in 1905.
During the same year, based on the works of Planck and Lenard,
Einstein published also an article stating that the electromagnetic
radiation is composed of quanta of energy hν and advanced a simple
particle interpretation of the photoelectric eﬀect. In a second article
in 1917, Einstein re-established Planck’s radiation density formula
and expressed that the light quanta have a momentum hν/c, where
c is the velocity of light in vacuum. He advanced that “the energy
of a light ray when spreading from a point consists of a ﬁnite num-
ber of energy quanta localized in points in space, which move with-
out dividing and are only absorbed and emitted as a whole”. That
was a decisive step toward the particle theory of light, but Bohr,
who was strongly opposed to the photon concept, announced in his
Nobel lecture, “the light quanta hypothesis is not compatible with the
interference phenomena and consequently it cannot throw light in the
nature of radiation”. The concept of light composed of quanta was
still not generally accepted.

Historical Survey and Experimental Evidence
7
Compton published his works on X-ray scattering by electrons in
1923 showing that the experimental results can only be interpreted
based on the light quanta model. On the other side, Wentzel in 1926
and Beck in 1927 demonstrated that “the photoelectric eﬀect may be
quite well interpreted using Maxwell’s wave theory for radiation and
quantum theory for the atomic energy levels without ever having to
introduce the light quanta” in their calculations. Although their arti-
cles were an extremely strong argument in favor of the wave theory,
it is quite surprising that exactly the same year, the light quanta
concept started to be universally accepted by many scientists and
Lewis introduced the word “Photon”, from the Greek word Phos
(Φωs = light).
Obviously, just before 1930, the general picture on the nature of
light was extremely puzzling and confusing since both opposing sides
defending the wave or the particle theory presented equally strong
arguments. Not surprisingly, in 1928, Bohr inspired by De Broglie’s
thesis on the simultaneous wave character of particles announced
the “Complementarity Principle” according to which “light has both
wave and particle natures appearing mutually exclusive in each spe-
ciﬁc experimental condition”.
From 1925 to 1930, new theories have shaken physics. Heisenberg
developed matrix-mechanics, while in parallel, Schr¨odinger invented
wave-mechanics which was revealed to be equivalent to matrix-
mechanics. Dirac and Jordan developed the quantum theory of radi-
ation. A few years later, enhancing further Dirac’s works, Pauli and
Heisenberg developed the fundamentals of quantum electrodynamics
(QED) theory which was further developed in the years of forties to
sixties. According to this theory, photons are considered to be point
particles and the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld corresponds to,
that of an ensemble of quantized harmonic oscillators. In the com-
plete absence of photons, QED representation gives an inﬁnite energy
for the vacuum state.
By the end of 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, astro-
physical observations established the ﬁrst estimations of the vac-
uum energy density in the universe demonstrating that it is, roughly
10−9 J/m3 putting in evidence that the universe is speeding up rather

8
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
than decelerating as it might be predicted by the general relativity in
the standard matter sources universe. In 1989, Weinberg had already
argued that when considering reasonable cut-oﬀs in the UV spectrum
for the energy of high frequency photons, the vacuum energy density
obtained by QED is by far many orders of magnitude greater than the
measured one. This has been recently called the “quantum vacuum
catastrophe” in order to mark the analogy with the “UV catastro-
phe” which, a century ago, entailed the necessity of developing a new
theory to account with.
Considering that the fundamentals of QED were established in
the years of 1930 to 1950, since then no new theories came to light.
Nevertheless, the technological advances on microwaves during the
Second World War and the invention of masers and lasers in the years
of the ﬁfties and sixties, respectively, gave scientists an impulse for
advanced experiments on light’s nature. Some of them are brieﬂy
described in this book.

Chapter 3
Basic Principles
of the Electromagnetic
Wave Theory
3.1. Maxwell’s Equations
The works of Ampere and Faraday on the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
during the years of the 1860s were the starting point for establishing
the theory of electromagnetic waves.
Initially they were both investigating time varying electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. Faraday ﬁrstly understood that the curl of an electric
ﬁeld ⃗E (⃗r, t) (units: Volt m−1) at a position ⃗r and at an instant t, in a
medium with magnetic permeability µ (units: Henry m−1) equals the
time variation of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity ⃗H (⃗r, t) (units: Ampere
m−1) times µ
⃗∇× ⃗E (⃗r, t) = −µ ∂
∂t
⃗H (⃗r, t)
(3.1.1)
The last equation is still called Faraday’s law. A few years later,
Ampere put in evidence that in a medium with electric permittivity
ε (units: Farad m−1), the curl of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity ⃗H (⃗r, t)
equals the current density ⃗j (⃗r, t) plus the time variation of the elec-
tric ﬁeld intensity ⃗E (⃗r, t) times ε.
⃗∇× ⃗H (⃗r, t) = ⃗j (⃗r, t) + ε ∂
∂t
⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.1.2)
where the current density ⃗j (⃗r, t) (Coulomb m−2 s−1 or Ampere m−2)
is related to the charge density ρ (⃗r, t) (Coulomb m−3 ) through the
11

12
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
fundamental “continuity equation”
⃗∇·⃗j (⃗r, t) = −∂ρ (⃗r, t)
∂t
(3.1.3)
expressing that the spatial variation of the current density equals the
time variation of the charge density implying simply charge conser-
vation.
What one ﬁrst notices is the natural fact that the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds cannot evaluate independently of the medium which
is expressed in this case through the electric permittivity and the
magnetic permeability. We can thus introduce the notions of the
electric displacement ﬂux density ⃗D (⃗r, t) (units: Coulomb m−2) and
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux density, that is the magnetic induction, ⃗B (⃗r, t)
(units: Webers m−2) which are related to the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds intensities ⃗E (⃗r, t) and ⃗H (⃗r, t) respectively through the tensor
expressions,
⃗Dαβ(t) = ˆεαβ · ⃗Eαβ(t);
⃗Bαβ(t) = ˆµαβ · ⃗Hαβ(t)
(3.1.4)
where the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability respec-
tively are tensors ˆεαβ and ˆµαβ with α = x, y, z and β = x, y, z, char-
acterizing the intrinsic electric and magnetic nature of the medium
in which the electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities subsist.
At that point it is important mentioning that the electric ﬁeld
⃗E (⃗r, t) and the magnetic induction ⃗B (⃗r, t) are fundamental ﬁelds
while ⃗D (⃗r, t) and ⃗H (⃗r, t) are ﬁelds that include the response of the
medium at macroscopic level.
In isotropic media, i.e., in media in which the electric and mag-
netic properties are identical in all spatial directions, the electric
ﬁeld is parallel to the electric displacement and the magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂux intensity parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld
⃗D (⃗r, t) = ε ⃗E (⃗r, t)
⃗H (⃗r, t) = 1
µ
⃗B (⃗r, t)
(3.1.5)
Taking the divergence (⃗∇·) of the Faraday’s and Ampere’s laws,
(3.1.1) and (3.1.2), and using the continuity equation (3.1.3) one gets

directly Gauss’s laws
⃗∇· ⃗E (⃗r, t) = ρ (⃗r, t)
ε
(3.1.6)
⃗∇· ⃗H (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.1.7)
where (3.1.6) is also called Coulomb’s law.
Physically speaking Gauss’s equations express the fact that indi-
vidual electric charges, positive as well as negative, subsist in nature
and are expressed in the charge density ρ (⃗r, t) in equation (3.1.6),
while the absence of the magnetic monopoles is expressed in equation
(3.1.7).
James Clerk Maxwell in 1873 uniﬁed equations (3.1.1), (3.1.2),
(3.1.6) and (3.1.7) to a group called Maxwell’s equations which,
joined to the continuity equation (3.1.3) express the relationship
between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds intensities in a medium with
a given magnetic permeability µ and electric permittivity ε in the
presence of charges and current densities.
Frequently, Maxwell’s equations are written in such a way that
they express the relation between the electric ﬁeld intensity ⃗E (⃗r, t)
and the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux intensity ⃗B (⃗r, t), i.e., the fundamental
ﬁelds.
⃗∇× ⃗E (⃗r, t) = −∂
∂t
⃗B (⃗r, t)
(3.1.8)
⃗∇× ⃗B (⃗r, t) = µ⃗j (⃗r, t) + (εµ) ∂
∂t
⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.1.9)
⃗∇· ⃗E (⃗r, t) = ρ (⃗r, t)
ε
(3.1.10)
⃗∇· ⃗B (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.1.11)
The relations (3.1.8) to (3.1.11) together with the continuity equa-
tion (3.1.3) are the fundamental equations governing the behavior of
the electromagnetic ﬁelds. They are invariant under time reversal
(t →−t), or space inversion (⃗r →−⃗r) or even both time reversal
and space inversion. More precisely, the intrinsic space time trans-
formation properties are such that the electric ﬁeld ⃗E (⃗r, t), and
therefore the electric displacement ⃗D (⃗r, t), do not change sign under

14
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
time reversal but under space inversion. The opposite is valid for
the magnetic induction ⃗B (⃗r, t) and the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗H (⃗r, t). This
is also true for the response of a medium to an electric ﬁeld and a
magnetic induction consisting respectively by the electric polariza-
tion ⃗P (⃗r, t) (units: Coulomb m−2) and magnetization ⃗M (⃗r, t) (units:
Ampere m−1) expressed as following
⃗P (⃗r, t) = ⃗D (⃗r, t) −ε0 ⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.1.12)
⃗M (⃗r, t) = 1
µ0
⃗B (⃗r, t) −⃗H (⃗r, t)
(3.1.13)
According to the set of equations (3.1.8) to (3.1.11), in space
regions characterized by the absence of charges and current densities
|⃗j| = 0, ρ = 0, the physical vector entities ⃗E (⃗r, t) and ⃗B (⃗r, t) are
related through the quantities ε and µ which appear to be of cru-
cial importance in Ampere’s equation (3.1.9). Under these conditions
Maxwell’s equations get the simple form
⃗∇× ⃗E (⃗r, t) = −∂
∂t
⃗B (⃗r, t)
(3.1.14)
⃗∇× ⃗B (⃗r, t) = (εµ) ∂
∂t
⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.1.15)
⃗∇· ⃗E (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.1.16)
⃗∇· ⃗B (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.1.17)
Starting from the last set of equations, Maxwell deduced the time
varying propagation of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds that gave
birth, for the ﬁrst time, to a theoretical representation of the elec-
tromagnetic waves.
3.2. Electromagnetic Wave Propagation
• Dispersion relation
Let us analyze how Maxwell’s equations lead naturally to the
expressions of propagation of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. We make
the hypothesis that the electric ﬁeld intensity ⃗E and the magnetic
ﬁeld ﬂux intensity ⃗B at any spatial position ⃗r vary in time with an

angular frequency ω = 2πν = 2π 1
T , where ν and T are the frequency
and the period of the oscillation respectively, so as we can write


⃗E0 (⃗r)
⃗B0 (⃗r)

eiωt

(3.2.1)
where Re denotes the real part of the equation.
Then, Maxwell’s equations, more precisely Ampere’s and Fara-
day’s laws, are expressed through the angular frequency ω
⃗∇× ⃗E (⃗r, t) = iω ⃗B (⃗r, t)
(3.2.2)
⃗∇× ⃗B (⃗r, t) = −iω (εµ)⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.2.3)
⃗∇· ⃗E (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.4)
⃗∇· ⃗B (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.5)
The set of the above equation describes the behavior of the electric
ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux intensities of an electromagnetic har-
monic wave oscillating with an angular frequency ω in an isotropic
medium with electric permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ.
One should notice two important points:
a. the correspondence
∂
∂t →−i ω, which as we shall see, will be of
crucial importance in quantum mechanics formalism,
b. the curl inversion absence of symmetry between ⃗E and ⃗B which
is ensured through the factor −(εµ), and which is revealed to be
of high importance in the electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.
The ﬁrst remark will be extensively discussed in the next chapter.
However, the second reveals the role of the medium’s nature in the
propagation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Let us assume the media to be homogeneous. Therefore we can use
plane wave solutions for ⃗E0 (⃗r) and ⃗B0 (⃗r) in (3.2.1) of the form ei⃗k·⃗r
where ⃗k is a vector along the propagation axis called wave vector.
Hence, from Maxwell’s equations we obtain
⃗k × ⃗E (⃗r, t) = ω ⃗B (⃗r, t)
(3.2.6)

16
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
⃗k × ⃗B (⃗r, t) = −ω (µε)⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.2.7)
⃗k · ⃗E (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.8)
⃗k · ⃗B (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.9)
The last set of equations entail that in isotropic media ⃗k is per-
pendicular to ⃗E and ⃗B (while it is always perpendicular to ⃗D and
⃗B, even if the medium is anisotropic) and ⃗E is perpendicular to ⃗B.
Consequently, the unit vectors, ˆe =
⃗E
| ⃗E|, ˆb =
⃗B
| ⃗B|, ˆk = ⃗k
|⃗k| constitute
a right-hand rectangular coordinate system.
Considering equation (3.2.6) and taking the cross-product we get
⃗k × ⃗k × ⃗E (⃗r, t) = ω ⃗k × ⃗B (⃗r, t)
(3.2.10)
According to the vector property ⃗k×⃗k× ⃗E (⃗r, t) = (⃗k · ⃗E (⃗r, t))⃗k−
k2 ⃗E (⃗r, t) = −k2 ⃗E (⃗r, t) where we have also used equation (3.2.8), the
equation (3.2.10) using (3.2.7) becomes
Ω2
k ⃗E (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.11)
with Ω2
k = k2 −(µε) ω2. The solution to the last equation is Ω2
k = 0.
Thus,
k2 = (µε) ω2
(3.2.12)
which is called the “dispersion relation” relating the wave vector k
to the angular frequency ω through the medium intrinsic properties
ε and µ.
• Physical quantities involved in the electromagnetic ﬁeld
Notice that
1
εµ has the dimension of the square power of celerity.
Consequently, it is precisely the electric permittivity ε and magnetic
permeability µ that ﬁxes the velocity of the electromagnetic wave in
a medium whose refractive index n is deﬁned as
n =
 µε
µ0ε0
(3.2.13)
with µ0 = 4π × 10−7H m−1 and ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12F m−1 ≈
1
36π
10−9F m−1, the magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of
the vacuum.

Basic Principles of the Electromagnetic Wave Theory

This is already an amazing concept of the classical electromag-
netic theory that confers electric and magnetic properties to the vac-
uum state.
The characteristic impendence of a medium is given by
R =
µ
ε
(3.2.14)
corresponding to the resistance (units: Ohms, Ω) of the medium when
an electric potential is applied.
Consequently, the vacuum itself is characterized by the impen-
dence
Rvacuum =
µ0
ε0
≈120π Ω
(3.2.15)
which has the deﬁnite value of 376.7 Ω.
It is extremely worthy noticing that the vacuum state in classical
electrodynamics is not an empty, fully inertial entity characterized by
the perfect “inexistence” but has its own physical, measurable impen-
dence, Rvacuum, as well as electric, ε0, and magnetic, µ0, properties
aﬀecting the propagation of the electromagnetic waves in vacuum.
In fact, the speed of the electromagnetic waves in vacuum, c, results
directly from the intrinsic properties of the vacuum itself
c =
1
√ε0µ0
≈2.9979 108 m s−1
(3.2.16)
Although the origin of the vacuum’s electromagnetic properties
remains unknown, the last ones dictate the value of the highest pos-
sible velocity in the universe, c, in the frame of course of the present
state of knowledge.
The dispersion relation writes now
k2
 c2
n2

= ω2
(3.2.17)
expressing a fundamental relationship between the wave vector k
and the angular frequency ω through the speed of the light c/n in a
medium with refractive index n, where n = 1 for the vacuum.

Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
• Propagation equations of electromagnetic waves
Taking the curl of equation (3.1.14) and using (3.1.15)
⃗∇× ⃗∇× ⃗E (⃗r, t) = −∂
∂t (⃗∇× ⃗B(⃗r, t)) = −∂
∂t (µε) ∂
∂t
⃗E (⃗r, t)
= −(µε) ∂2
∂t2 ⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.2.18)
Considering the classical vector formalism
⃗∇× ⃗∇× ⃗E = ⃗∇(⃗∇· ⃗E) −⃗∇2 ⃗E = −⃗∇2 ⃗E
(3.2.19)
So (3.2.18) writes
⃗∇2 ⃗E (⃗r, t) −(µε) ∂2
∂t2 ⃗E (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.20)
which is the propagation equation for the electric ﬁeld in a medium
with refractive index n
⃗∇2 ⃗E (⃗r, t) −n2
c2
∂2
∂t2 ⃗E (⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.21)
An analogue equation can be obtained for the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux
intensity ⃗B (⃗r, t).
• Helmholtz equation
The vector relations of (3.2.6) to (3.2.9) show that ⃗k, ⃗E and ⃗B are
perpendicular to each other and construct a right-hand coordinate
system. Hence, the harmonic solutions of the propagation equation
for the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld induction write
⃗E (⃗r, t) = E0 (⃗r) ˆe e−i(⃗k·⃗r−ωt) + c.c.
(3.2.22)
⃗B (⃗r, t) = B0 (⃗r)(ˆk × ˆe) e−i(⃗k·⃗r−ωt) + c.c.
(3.2.23)
with c.c. denoting the complex conjugate part.
From (3.2.12), (3.2.17), (3.2.21) and (3.2.22), we deduce the
Helmholtz equation for each component of the electric ﬁeld

Basic Principles of the Electromagnetic Wave Theory

In other words, in the classical electromagnetic theory, the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds oscillate perpendicularly along the propagation
axis k with an angular frequency ω at the speed c/n.
This is called simply a plane wave solution. In this representation
the wave vector in vacuum (n = 1) has the simple expression
⃗k = ω
c
ˆk = 2π ν
c
ˆk = 2π
λ
ˆk
(3.2.25)
where λ is the wavelength, representing the spatial distance of a
complete oscillation of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors over a
period T and ˆk, the unit vector along the propagation axis.
For a given ﬁxed value of the angular frequency ω, and the wave-
length λ, the wave is called monochromatic (single color) and we will
use the notations ⃗Eω (⃗r, t) and ⃗Hω (⃗r, t) for the corresponding elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds, which, according to the above considerations
obey the same propagation equation
⃗∇2 ⃗Gω(⃗r, t) −n2
c2
∂2
∂t2 ⃗Gω(⃗r, t) = 0
(3.2.26)
where ⃗Gω(⃗r, t) is either ⃗Eω (⃗r, t) or ⃗Hω (⃗r, t).
More generally an electromagnetic wave is called Transverse
Electro-Magnetic (TEM) when both ⃗Eω(⃗r, t) and ⃗Hω(⃗r, t) lie in the
plane that is transverse to the direction of propagation, with the
same token Transverse Electric (TE) corresponding to the conﬁgu-
ration with all the components of the electric ﬁeld, but not those of
the magnetic ﬁeld, in the transverse plane to the propagation axis.
Conversely, a Transverse Magnetic (TM) electromagnetic wave has
all of the components of the magnetic ﬁeld, but not those of the
electric one, in the plane transverse to the propagation direction.
• Energy ﬂux of electromagnetic waves
The vector product
⃗Sω = ⃗Eω × ⃗Hω
(3.2.27)
represents the instantaneous magnitude and direction of the power
ﬂow of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and is called the Poynting vector.

20
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
The power density (units: Watt m−2) along the propagation axis
is obtained by time averaging the Poynting vector over a period T

(3.2.28)
The quantity ⟨⃗Sω⟩T is also called “Intensity” or “Irradiance” of
the monochromatic electromagnetic wave.
The energy density (units: Joules m−3) of a transverse monochro-
matic electromagnetic (TMEM) wave in vacuum oscillating at the
angular frequency ω is obtained at the coordinate ⃗r and at an instant
t by the expression:
Wω(⃗r, t) = 1
2

ε0| ⃗Eω(⃗r, t)|2 + 1
µ0
| ⃗Bω(⃗r, t)|2

(3.2.29)
where ε0 and µ0 are the vacuum permittivity and permeability
related to the velocity of light in vacuum c by the simple relation:
ε0µ0c2 = 1
(3.2.30)
implying once again that the vacuum in classical electrodynamics
has an electromagnetic essence.
Wω(⃗r, t) has to be understood as a time varying scalar ﬁeld
entailing that the energy density has not ﬁxed values at any space
coordinate, due naturally to the periodic variation of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. Frequently, Wω(⃗r, t) is expressed through the vacuum
permittivity only, getting for the total energy of a monochromatic
electromagnetic ﬁeld in a volume V :
E(ω, ε0) = ε0
2

V
(| ⃗Eω(⃗r, t)|2 + c2| ⃗Bω(⃗r, t)|2)d3r
(3.2.31)
It is quite important noticing that the energy of the electromag-
netic waves depends directly on the vacuum intrinsic properties, the
electric permittivity ε0 and magnetic permeability µ0.
Furthermore, Eω depends on the integration volume V and it is a
time varying function.

• TEM waves — Laplace equation
General solutions of Maxwell’s equations for TEM waves are with-
out longitudinal ﬁeld components.
From equations (3.1.5), (3.2.2) and (3.2.3), we can write the curls
of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld as following
⃗∇× ⃗E (⃗r, t) = −iω µ ⃗H (⃗r, t)
(3.2.32)
⃗∇× ⃗H (⃗r, t) = iω ε⃗E (⃗r, t)
(3.2.33)
Using the plane wave expression (3.2.22) and (3.2.23) and con-
sidering the propagation along the z-axis so that in Cartesian coor-
dinates the components of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities
of the transverse wave depend on (x, y), the equations (3.2.32) and

Hence, the components of TE waves, for which Ez = 0, as well
as TM waves, for which Hz = 0, are immediately deduced from
equations (3.2.41) to (3.2.44).
Now, one may wonder what happens for a TEM wave, when both
Ez and Hz are zero. Obviously, we cannot use equations (3.2.41) to
(3.2.44). Hence, we have to apply again equations (3.2.34) to (3.2.38)
from which, by eliminating Hx, we get simply

transverse components of the TEM wave behave as static ﬁelds

3.3. Scalar and Vector Potentials
The classical electromagnetic theory described brieﬂy above repre-
sents light as electromagnetic plane waves whose electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds may oscillate at any frequency from “zero” to “inﬁnity”.
From mathematical point of view, ⃗Eω(⃗r, t) and ⃗Bω(⃗r, t) can be gen-
erated from the coupling of scalar and vector potentials which are
frequently denoted by Φω(⃗r, t) and ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) respectively
⃗Eω(⃗r, t) = −⃗∇Φω(⃗r, t) −∂
∂t
⃗Aω(⃗r, t)
(3.3.1)
⃗Bω(⃗r, t) = ⃗∇× ⃗Aω(⃗r, t)
(3.3.2)
Obviously, the scalar and vector potentials are not precisely
deﬁned by the last relations since equations (3.3.1) and (3.3.2) remain
unaltered when considering any function σ(⃗r, t) such as
Φω(⃗r, t) →Φω(⃗r, t) −∂
∂tσ(⃗r, t)
(3.3.3)
and
⃗Aω(⃗r, t) →⃗Aω(⃗r, t) + ⃗∇σ(⃗r, t)
(3.3.4)
In electromagnetic theory, this property is called Gauge Invari-
ance which requires a supplementary condition for the deﬁnition of
the scalar and vector potential Φω(⃗r, t) and ⃗Aω(⃗r, t).
In Lorentz Gauge, the supplementary condition is chosen to be
⃗∇· ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) = −µε ∂
∂tΦω(⃗r, t)
(3.3.5)
From the propagation equation (3.2.20) and (3.3.1), in absence of
charges and current densities |⃗j| = 0, ρ = 0, and using the Lorentz
Gauge condition, we get
⃗∇2 ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) −µε ∂2
∂t2 ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) = 0
(3.3.6)

24
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
and
⃗∇2Φω(⃗r, t) −µε ∂2
∂t2 Φω(⃗r, t) = 0
(3.3.7)
showing that all the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a monochromatic
electromagnetic wave, ⃗Eω(⃗r, t), ⃗Bω(⃗r, t), ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) and Φω(⃗r, t) prop-
agate in space satisfying, exactly the same propagation equation.
If we consider that the current and charge densities are not zero,
it is easy to get from Maxwell’s equations (3.1.8) to (3.1.11) the
complete propagation equations:
⃗∇2 ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) −µε ∂2
∂t2 ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) = −µ ⃗J(⃗r, t)
(3.3.8)
and
⃗∇2Φω(⃗r, t) −µε ∂2
∂t2 Φω(⃗r, t) = −ρ (⃗r, t)
ε
(3.3.9)
The general solutions of the last equations are:

|⃗r −⃗r′|
d3r
(3.3.11)
in which the time delay appearing in the current and charge den-
sities is conditioned by the speed of the electromagnetic waves in
vacuum, c.
At that level it is very important to note that the dimension
analysis of (3.3.10) shows that the vector potential is inversely pro-
portional to time, hence proportional to a frequency.
Now, let us consider a diﬀerent Gauge condition which consider-
ably simpliﬁes the equations. In the so called Coulomb Gauge, the
supplementary condition is chosen as:
⃗∇· ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) = 0
(3.3.12)

Basic Principles of the Electromagnetic Wave Theory
25
From (3.3.5) and (3.3.9), we get Poisson’s equation relating the
scalar potential to the charge density:
⃗∇2Φω(⃗r, t) = −ρ (⃗r, t)
ε
(3.3.13)
whose solution is now independent of the time delay characterizing
the charge density:
Φ (⃗r, t) =
1
4πε
 ρ (⃗r ′, t′)
|⃗r −⃗r′| d3r′
(3.3.14)
Hence in the absence of charges Φ(⃗r, t) = 0 and from (3.3.1),
we get a quite important relation between the electric ﬁeld and the
vector potential in the Coulomb Gauge.
⃗Eω(⃗r, t) = −∂
∂t
⃗Aω(⃗r, t)
(3.3.15)
The last relation is principally used in classical and quantum elec-
trodynamics to calculate the electric ﬁeld starting from the vector
potential.
3.4. Vector Potential and Electromagnetic Field
Polarization
Using the above relations, the propagation equation for the vector
potential in vacuum writes
⃗∇2 ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) −1
c2
∂2
∂t2 ⃗Aω(⃗r, t) = 0
(3.4.1)
In the case of a plane monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld the
vector potential is real (from mathematical point of view) and it is
expressed in the same way as the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
⃗Aω (⃗r, t) = ⃗A0(ω) (e−i(⃗k·⃗r−ωt+θ) + c.c.)
= 2 ⃗A0 (ω) cos(⃗k · ⃗r −ω t + θ)
(3.4.2)
where θ is a phase parameter.
For the Coulomb Gauge condition to be satisﬁed, the following
relation between the wave vector and the amplitude of the vector
potential should hold:
⃗k · ⃗A0(ω) = 0
(3.4.3)

26
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
entailing that the wave vector is perpendicular to the vector potential
so that the electromagnetic wave is called transverse.
Taking θ = 0 and using the relations (3.3.15) and (3.3.2), while
putting ⃗A0 →A0(ω) ˆε and ⃗k = ω
c ˆk we get directly the electric ﬁeld
and magnetic induction expressed through the vector potential
⃗Eω(⃗r, t) = −2ω A0(ω) ˆε sin (⃗k · ⃗r −ω t)
(3.4.4)
⃗Bω(⃗r, t) = −1
c2 ωA0(ω)(ˆk × ˆε) sin (⃗k · ⃗r −ω t)
(3.4.5)
The polarization of the radiation, i.e., the spatial orientation of
the electric ﬁeld, is also speciﬁed by the unit vector of the vector
potential ˆε.
From the coupling of the equation (3.2.28) with the last expres-
sions one gets in vacuum,
⟨⃗Sω⟩T = 2ε0c ω2A2
0(ω) ˆk
(3.4.6)
expressing that the power density along the propagation axis
(Poynting vector) is also expressed through the vector potential over
a period T.
In the same way the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is
obtained by (3.2.29), (3.4.4) and (3.4.5):
Wω(⃗r, t) = 4ε0ω2A2
0(ω) sin2(⃗k · ⃗r −ωt)
(3.4.7)
whose mean value over a period writes:
⟨Wω⟩T = 2ε0ω2A2
0(ω) = 1
c|⟨⃗Sω⟩T |
(3.4.8)
Consequently, the only knowledge of the vector potential amplitude
A0(ω) is suﬃcient to deduce the principal physical properties of a
TMEM wave of angular frequency ω in vacuum.
We can now have a close look to the vector orientation of the
electric ﬁeld and that of the vector potential with respect to the
propagation axis. Following the equation (3.4.3), the unit vector of
the vector potential and thus that of the electric ﬁeld intensity, ˆε,
lies in a plane which is perpendicular to the propagation vector ˆk.

Basic Principles of the Electromagnetic Wave Theory
27
Considering two orthogonal unit vectors ˆe1 and ˆe2, deﬁning the plane
perpendicular to the wave vector ˆk forming a right-handed system:
ˆk = ˆe1 × ˆe2,
ˆe1 · ˆe2 = 0
(3.4.9)
so as the unit vector ˆε of the vector potential can be decomposed
simply as
ˆε = α1ˆe1 + α2ˆe2
(3.4.10)
And since ˆε is a unit vector, the following relation between the
coeﬃcients α1 and α2 holds
α2
1 + α2
2 = 1
(3.4.11)
Thus, we can deﬁne two complex orthogonal unit vectors ˆL and
ˆR such as
ˆL =
1
√
2(ˆe1 + iˆe2)
and
ˆR =
1
√
2(ˆe1 −iˆe2)
(3.4.12)
appropriate for describing respectively, the Left-hand and Right-
hand circularly polarized electromagnetic waves, corresponding to
two states of the radiation polarization.
In the ﬁrst case, the electric ﬁeld follows a circular left-hand pre-
cession along the propagation axis with the angular frequency ω,
while in the second one it follows a circular right-hand precession at
the same angular frequency.
From equations (3.4.2) and (3.4.12), one may easily deduce the
components of the vector potential of a circularly polarized plane
wave in Cartesian coordinates (ˆe1 →ˆx and ˆe2 →ˆy):
A(L)
x (z, t) = A(R)
x
(z, t) =
√
2A0(ω) cos (kz −ω t)
A(L)
y (z, t) = −A(R)
y
(z, t) = −
√
2A0(ω) sin (kz −ω t)
A(L)
z
= A(R)
z
= 0
(3.4.13)
Using (3.3.15) and (3.4.13), the expressions of the corresponding elec-
tric ﬁeld components write:
E(L)
x (z, t) = E(R)
x
(z, t) = ωA(L)
y
= −ωA(R)
y

28

(z, t) = −E(R)
y
(z, t) = −ωA(L)
x
= −ω A(R)
x
E(L)
z
= E(R)
z
= 0
(3.4.14)
Consequently, an arbitrary state of polarization can be obtained
by the complex unit vector ˆP consisting of a linear combination of
ˆL and ˆR:
ˆP = βL ˆL + βR ˆR
= 1
√
2(βL(ˆx + iˆy) + βR(ˆx −iˆy))
with |βL|2 + |βR|2 = 1
(3.4.15)
For example, a linear polarization consists of the oscillation of the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld in the orthogonal planes (x, z) and (y, z)
along the propagation axis z.
Obviously, such a polarization is easily obtained by the combi-
nation of two circularly polarized waves propagating in phase and
having right and left polarization.
3.5. Guided Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves
In the previous chapter, we have seen that the electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds of a monochromatic wave obey the propagation equation
(3.2.26) in free space. It is of high interest to explore the way the elec-
tromagnetic wave propagate in a waveguide of speciﬁc cross sectional
shape and dimensions. The problem consists of seeking solutions to
Maxwell’s equations satisfying the particular boundary conditions
imposed by the waveguide shape.
Let us consider the simple case in which the inner walls of the
waveguide consists of a homogeneous and isotropic dielectric with
ﬁxed values of ε and µ. It is worth noting that a TEM mode can
only propagate in the presence of two or more guiding conductors.
Consequently, a TEM mode cannot propagate in a hollow waveguide
since it is composed of a single conductor. Thus, we give below the
components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of transverse elec-
tric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes satisfying Maxwell’s
equations and the boundary conditions, in the case of rectangular
and circular waveguides.

• Rectangular waveguide of cross section a, b (a > b)
We also assume here time-harmonic ﬁelds with an angular fre-
quency ω, hence with an exponential dependence eiωt. The propa-

boundary conditions, for the components of the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds on the waveguide walls.

• Circular waveguide of radius r0
In a circular waveguide things are slightly diﬀerent and it is more
practical to use the cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z).
• Circular waveguide TEm,n modes

• Case of two parallel plates
This is a particular conﬁguration that accepts TE and TM waves
and can also support TEM waves since it is composed of two conduc-
tors. As we have seen in 3.2, the TEM waves behave as the static ﬁelds
between conductors and consequently they can be deduced from the
scalar potential that satisﬁes Poisson’s equation (3.3.13) in the plane
(x, y) and in the absence of charges.
⃗∇2
(x,y) Φ (x, y) = 0
(3.5.31)
Considering two parallel plates in the (x, z) plane separated by
a distance y0, having a potential diﬀerence of U, and considering a
deﬁnite length along the x axis, x0, for 0 ≤x ≤x0 and 0 ≤y ≤y0,
the boundary conditions for the scalar potential write
Φ(x, 0) = 0
and

where R is the impendence of the medium between the parallel plates

I(y0) = −
 x0

(3.5.38)
This is a quite interesting result showing that TEM waves can
propagate between two parallel plates with a potential diﬀerence U,
inducing a current density on the upper plate.
• Density of states
The guided propagation of the electromagnetic waves reveals that
whatever the shape of the box the exponential part of the wave func-
tion e−i⃗k·⃗r of (3.4.2) suﬀers the boundary conditions. This introduces
naturally the notion that the electromagnetic wave is composed of
“states”, whose number is imposed by the shape and the dimensions
of a given volume and can be calculated.
Let us consider the simple case of a cube of a large side L and
volume V . Then the periodic boundary conditions, like in (3.5.8) for
the wave vector are
kx = 2π
L nx,
ky = 2π
L ny,
kz = 2π
L nz
(3.5.39)
with nx, ny, nz = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .
The number of modes in the range dkxdkydkz = d3k writes
dkxdkydkz =
2π
L
3
dnxdnydnz
(3.5.40)

Assuming that L is too large compared to the wavelength, nx, ny,
nz can be considered as continuous variables
dnxdnydnz =
 L
2π
3
dkxdkydkz = V
8π3 4πk2dk
(3.5.41)
Using the dispersion relation ω = kc and considering two direc-
tions of polarization per state, the total number of states in the
angular frequency interval dω writes
dn(ω) = V ω2
π2c3 dω
(3.5.42)
Notice that the same expressions will be used later in quantum
mechanics for the calculation of the number of photons in a volume
V , revealing an interesting relation between the notion of electro-
magnetic ﬁeld “state” and the concept of the “photon”.
Hence, the states density, corresponding to the number of states
per unit volume and unit frequency ν = ω/2π results readily from
(3.5.42),
ρ(ν) = 8πν2

(3.5.43)
Equation (3.5.41) is extremely useful for transforming the discrete
summation over the wave vector k, characterizing each state to a
continuous summation over the angular frequencies

(3.5.44)
This is the key relation used in all calculations in quantum elec-
trodynamics for the description of a system with a large number of
photons in order to obtain physical results independent of the vol-
ume parameter V . It is of high importance to notice that the last
relation has been obtained under the condition that all the photons
wavelengths are much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of
the volume V .
Finally, we have to remark that according to (3.5.42) the density
of states theory predicts that a single mode of the electromagnetic

36
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
ﬁeld occupies a volume which is roughly
Vsinglemode ∝3π2c3
ω3
(3.5.45)
As we have seen from the guided propagation descriptions a given
mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld can only stand within a vol-
ume with characteristic dimensions equal or bigger than the cut-oﬀ
wavelength. The last relation leads to the important conclusion that
the minimum volume in which an electromagnetic ﬁeld mode can
stand is proportional to ω−3.
3.6. Conclusion Remarks
The principal conclusion that can be drawn out from the last chap-
ter is that the electromagnetic waves can propagate in vacuum and
the propagation equations are immediately deduced from Maxwell’s
equations.
However, in Maxwell’s theory the vacuum itself is not a com-
pletely empty medium but has an electromagnetic nature, processing
a magnetic permeability µ0 = 4π × 10−7H m−1 and an electric per-
mittivity ε0 = 8.85×10−12F m−1 ≈
1
36π10−9F m−1, and consequently
an impendence of a precise value, Rvacuum =

µ0
ε0 ≈120πΩ.
The vacuum intrinsic electric and magnetic properties play a cru-
cial role in Maxwell’s equations whatever the system of units used (SI
or CGS) because they ﬁx, the speed c of the electromagnetic waves
in vacuum c =
1
√ε0µ0 ≈2.9979 108 m s−1, which at the present status
of knowledge is considered to be the highest speed permitted in the
universe.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the energy density and
ﬂux of the electromagnetic waves depend equally on the vacuum
properties ε0 and µ0.
It turns out that the electromagnetic waves, in other words light,
appear to behave as a natural vibration of the vacuum, having intrin-
sic electric and magnetic properties. The vector potential of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, issued from Maxwell’s equations is proportional to
the angular frequency.

Basic Principles of the Electromagnetic Wave Theory
37
On the other hand, it is of high interest to note the volume impor-
tance for the existence of a “mode” of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
issued from the guided propagation studies. All the cut-oﬀwave-
lengths calculated for the diﬀerent shapes of waveguides entail that
longer wavelengths beyond those values cannot stand within a volume
of a given shape and dimensions. Consequently, an electromagnetic
wave mode of a given wavelength, even the simplest one composed
by a single state, cannot subsist in a volume whose dimensions corre-
spond to a smaller cut-oﬀwavelength. The characteristic volume cor-
responding to a single mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is inversely
proportional to the cube of the angular frequency.
Finally, the number of states per unit volume and unit frequency
calculated by ρ(ν) = 8πν2
c3
is only valid in a volume whose dimensions
are considerably bigger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic
waves.

Chapter 4
From Electromagnetic Waves
to Quantum Electrodynamics
4.1. Elements of Quantum Mechanics
• Blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe
The study of the properties of radiation emitted by hot bodies
was the starting point for the development of the quantum theory
at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. The
experimental evidence has shown that the spectral distribution, in
other words the distribution of the wavelengths of the radiation, as
well as the total energy radiated depend directly on the temperature
of the body.
The number of standing electromagnetic waves, i.e., the number of
modes, per unit volume and unit frequency within a cavity is given
by the expression (3.5.43). It can be shown that for a suﬃciently
big cavity this expression holds whatever its shape. Considering, the
electromagnetic waves to be in thermal equilibrium at temperature
T with the walls of the cavity, the probability p(E) that a mode
has an energy E included between E + dE, is obtained in classical
theory by
p (E) = e−E/kBT
kBT
(4.1.1)
where kB is Boltzmann’s constant.

The mean energy of a mode is thus
¯E =
 ∞
0
Ep (E) dE =
 ∞
0
E e−E/kBT
kBT
dE = kBT
(4.1.2)
Consequently, all the modes have the same mean energy, indepen-
dent of the frequency. Using (3.5.43), the energy per unit volume of
the cavity at temperature T and per unit frequency writes
u (T, ν) = 8πν2
c3 kBT
(4.1.3)
The last expression is known historically as the Rayleigh-Jeans
energy density which fails to describe the experimentally observed
results at high frequencies, often called the “ultraviolet catastrophe”,
while giving an inﬁnite total energy per unit volume of the cavity
when summing up along all the frequencies
U(T) =
 ∞
0
8πν2
c3 kBTdν →∞
(4.1.4)
In order to resolve this problem, Max Planck introduced the orig-
inal idea that the cavity walls are composed of local oscillators, each
one being capable of absorbing and emitting discrete quantities of
electromagnetic energy nhν, where n is an integer and h is a uni-
versal constant attributed in his honor to him, Planck’s constant.
This absolutely revolutionary concept at the beginning of the 20th
century, led in the following years to the development of the quantum
theory of the electronic energy levels in matter and in the quantiza-
tion of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Following Planck’s idea, the total energy of a mode is En = nhν
and the probability for a mode to be composed of n quantum of
electromagnetic energy, called photons, is
pn = γ e−nhν/kBT
(4.1.5)
where γ is a normalization factor so that the sum of all probabilities
be equal to 1.
Hence,
γ

e−nhν/kBT = 1 ⇒γ = 1 −e−hν/kBT
(4.1.6)

Now, using β =

and the electromagnetic energy per unit volume and unit frequency
now becomes within Planck’s hypothesis

(4.1.8)
The last expression is Planck’s radiation law and interprets quite
satisfactorily all the experimental results at any frequency and tem-
perature of a black body.
• Energy and momentum operators in quantum mechanics
In the ﬁrst two decades of the 20th century, the introduction by
Max Planck of the quantized energy levels of the atoms and molecules
resulting in quantized emissions and absorptions of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld, as well as many experiments demonstrating the wave prop-
erties of electrons (Davisson and Germer), created the necessity to
elaborate a new theory.
The birth of quantum mechanics came along with Niels Bohr’s
and Erwin Schr¨odinger’s works in 1925, based on the ideas put for-
ward by Louis de Broglie in 1924, following which the energy and
the momentum of particles are associated to a frequency and a wave-
length, through the formalism already established previously for light
E = hν = ℏω
⃗P = h
λˆek = ℏ⃗k
(4.1.9)
A plane wave is associated to the particle
Ψ (⃗r, t) = Ψ0 ei(⃗k·⃗r−ωt)
(4.1.10)
From the last two equations, one can easily deduce
i ℏ∂
∂tΨ = EΨ
−iℏ⃗∇Ψ = ⃗p Ψ
(4.1.11)

42
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
According to the last relations, a fundamental postulate of quan-
tum mechanics was born according to which for a nonrelativistic
particle, either it is free or not, the energy and the momentum are
represented by the operators
E →i ℏ∂
∂t
⃗p →−iℏ⃗∇
(4.1.12)
At that point, we recall the correspondence already deduced from
Maxwell’s equations in (3.2) between the angular frequency and the
time derivative operator ω →i ∂
∂t getting from (4.1.12), E →ℏω,
when considering plane wave solutions.
Taking into account the potential energy V of the particle in the
total energy and using (4.1.11), we get the Schr¨odinger equation
which consists the basis of quantum mechanics
i ℏ∂
∂tΨ =
 ⃗P 2
2m + V

Ψ = −ℏ2
2m
⃗∇2Ψ + V Ψ
(4.1.13)
To complement the fundamentals of the quantum mechanical the-
ory, we can now consider the action of the momentum operator
pα = −i ℏ∂
∂α along a Cartesian coordinate α where α is x, y or z
acting on a function φ(α). For that we apply the commutation oper-
ator [α, pa] = αpα −pαα on a function φ(α)
[α, pa]φ(α) = −iℏ

α∂φ(α)
∂α
−∂
∂ααφ(α)

= iℏφ(α)
(4.1.14)
The last result shows that the commutation between the coor-
dinate α and the corresponding component of momentum opera-
tor pα do not commute and can be generalized using the Cartesian
coordinates
[x, px] = [y, py] = [z, pz] = iℏ
(4.1.15)
All the other operators vanish, that is [α, pα′] = iℏδα,α′ where δα,α′
is Kronecker symbol such as δα,α′ = 1 when α = α′ and δα,α′ = 0 for
α ̸= α′.
The physical consequence of this is that for the non-commuting
operators a “simultaneous” measurement of the corresponding
observables is impossible.

From Electromagnetic Waves to Quantum Electrodynamics

• Particle in a square potential well — correspondence with the
waveguides
The simplest case of the application of Schr¨odinger equation is
to consider a particle of mass m in a one-dimensional inﬁnite square
potential well, V (z) deﬁned by
V (z) = 0
for |z| > z0
V (z) →∞
for z < −z0
and
z > z0
(4.1.16)
Since the potential tends to inﬁnity for z < −z0 and z > z0, the
particle has no possibility to be outside the borders of the poten-
tial, consequently its wave function Ψ(z) must tend to zero in that
interval.
For |z| < z0 where V (z) = 0, the Schr¨odinger equation is simply
written as
−ℏ2
2m
d2
dz2 Ψ(z) = EΨ (z)
(4.1.17)
Putting
k =
√
2mE
ℏ
(4.1.18)
the solution of (4.1.17) is a general trigonometric function of the form
Ψ(z) = c1 sin(kz) + c2 cos(kz)
(4.1.19)
Taking into account that Ψ(z) must be zero at z = ±z0 we get
two solutions:
Either
c1 = 0
and
cos(kz0) = 0
(4.1.20)
so that the only permitted values of k are
kn = nπ
2z0
(n = 1, 3, 5, 7, . . .)
(4.1.21)
Or
c2 = 0
and
sin (kz0) = 0
(4.1.22)
And the permitted values of k are now
kn = nπ
2z0
(n = 2, 4, 6, 8, . . .)
(4.1.23)

44
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
Consequently the energy is deduced from (4.1.18) and is found to
be quantiﬁed following the integer values of n
En = ℏ2k2
2m = ℏ2
8m
nπ
z0
2
(n = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .)
(4.1.24)
The wave function for both solutions can be normalized to
unity by
 z0
−z0
|Ψn(z)|2dz = 1
(4.1.25)
getting for both solutions respectively
Ψn(z) =

and


(n = 2, 4, 6, . . .)
(4.1.27)
Comparing (4.1.21) and (4.1.23) with (3.5.8), we deduce that
when attributing a wave function to a particle entails automatically,
it is submitted to boundary conditions obtaining for k equivalent
expressions with those of the guided electromagnetic waves.
4.2. Harmonic Oscillator in Quantum Mechanics
• From the classical expressions to the quantum mechanical ones
In order to have a precise understanding of the mathematical
process of the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, with which
we will deal in the next chapters, it is of outstanding importance
to know how the harmonic oscillator is described in the quantum
mechanical approach.
We may start with the simple case of one dimensional motion
along the x axis of a particle of mass m submitted to a central force
expressed by the well-known Hooke’s law
⃗F = −∂V (x)
∂x
⃗x
|x| = −Kx ⃗x
(4.2.1)

From Electromagnetic Waves to Quantum Electrodynamics
45
where V (x) is the potential energy and Kx is the force constant.
V (x) = 1
2Kx x2
(4.2.2)
The kinetic energy at any coordinate x of the motion of the par-
ticle is
Tx = 1
2m
∂x
∂t
2
= P 2
x
2m
(4.2.3)
where Px = m(∂x
∂t ) is the momentum of the particle along the x axis.
The total energy of the system writes
E(x) = Tx + V (x) = P 2
x
2m + 1
2Kx x2
(4.2.4)
Consequently, putting
ωx =
Kx
m
1/2
(4.2.5)
the energy simply becomes
E(x) = P 2
x
2m + 1
2mω2
x x2
(4.2.6)
Notice that ωx has the dimensions of an angular frequency along
the x axis.
As we have seen in the previous chapter, the general expression
of the three dimensions momentum operator in quantum mechanics
is
˜P = −i ℏ⃗∇
(4.2.7)
which writes along the x axis
˜Px = −i ℏ∂
∂x
(4.2.8)
Considering ψ (x) to be the eigenfunction, the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion for the linear harmonic oscillator derives immediately from
(4.2.6),
−ℏ2

Putting
ξ = x
mKx
ℏ2
1/4
(4.2.10)
and considering the dimensionless fraction
ηx = 2E(x)
ℏωx
(4.2.11)
we get the simpliﬁed equation
∂2ψ(ξ)
∂ξ2
+ (ηx −ξ2)ψ(ξ) = 0
(4.2.12)
The asymptotic behavior of the above equation when |ξ| →∞
suggests looking for solutions of the form:
ψ(ξ) = e−ξ2/2H(ξ)
(4.2.13)
where H(ξ) should be polynomial functions not aﬀecting the asymp-
totic behavior.
Solutions of (4.2.12) are found for
ηx = 2nx + 1
with ηx = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(4.2.14)
called the Hermite polynomials Hn(ξ) whose general expression is
Hnx(ξ) = (−1)nxeξ2 dnxe−ξ2
dξnx
(4.2.15)
Getting the complete eigenfunctions
ψnx(ξ) = Ce−ξ2/2Hnx(ξ) = C(−1)nxeξ2/2 dnxe−ξ2
dξnx
(4.2.16)
Where C is a constant which can be determined by imposing the
summation over the whole space of the square modulus of the wave
function to be normalized to unity. And the eigenvalues, that is the
energy spectrum with E(x) →Enx(ωx) writes
Enx(ωx) = ℏωx

nx + 1
2

(4.2.17)
Hence, the energy of the linear one dimensional harmonic oscilla-
tor in quantum mechanics can only get the discrete values of relation
(4.2.17) with nx = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

From Electromagnetic Waves to Quantum Electrodynamics
47
This is easily generalized in a three dimensional harmonic oscil-
lator for which the Schr¨odinger equation and the energy spectrum
take the expressions

(4.2.19)
This is a quite amazing result showing that a zero energy state
cannot exist, and even an one dimensional harmonic oscillator, in
complete absence of any external interaction, at zero temperature,
has a minimum nonzero energy which equals to E0(ω) = 1
2ℏω depend-
ing only on the potential and the mass of the particle according
to (4.2.5).
• Dirac representation, creation and annihilation operators
For an one dimensional harmonic oscillator of mass m at a coor-
dinate ⃗q with a momentum ⃗p = m d⃗q/dt, employing the reduced
expressions for the canonical variables of position Q = |⃗q|√m and
momentum P = |⃗p|/√m, the total energy (4.2.6) becomes
E = 1
2(P 2 + ω2Q2)
(4.2.20)
The transition to the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian is
obtained by imposing the following expressions for the momentum
and position operators respectively
ˆP = i

ℏω
2 (a+ −a)
and
ˆQ =

ℏ
2ω(a+ + a)
(4.2.21)
where a, a+ are respectively the annihilation and creation operators
of a quantum of energy of the harmonic oscillator, which can be
expressed by inversing equation (4.2.21)
a =

1
2ℏω(ω ˆQ + i ˆP)
and
a+ =

1
2ℏω(ω ˆQ −i ˆP)
(4.2.22)

48
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
Considering (4.1.15), the commutation relation between the posi-
tion and momentum operators is
[Q, P] = iℏ
(4.2.23)
and we get
[a, a+] = 1
(4.2.24)
Considering (4.2.21) and (4.2.20), we obtain directly the Hamil-
tonian of the harmonic oscillator expressed with respect to the anni-
hilation and creation operators
˜HHO = 1
2( ˆP 2 + ω2 ˆQ2) = ℏω

a+a + 1
2

(4.2.25)
In Dirac representation, each eigenfunction takes the simple
expression ψn(ξ) ⇒|n⟩corresponding to a quantum state composed
of n harmonic oscillators.
It can be shown that the actions of the creation and annihilation
operators a+ and a respectively on the eigenfunction are expressed
as following
a+|n⟩=
√
n + 1|n + 1⟩
a|n⟩= √n|n −1⟩
(4.2.26)
Consequently, the simpliﬁed Schr¨odinger equation in Dirac repre-
sentation is
˜HHO|n⟩= E|n⟩→ℏω

a+ a + 1
2

|n⟩
= ℏω

n + 1
2

|n⟩
(4.2.27)
The successive application of a ﬁrst and a+ next, i.e., a+ a on the
|n⟩state translates the number n of the quantum oscillators having
energy ℏω. Thus, a+ a is also called the number operator.
• The Dirac equation
In the last sections we have resumed basic principles of quantum
mechanics and the Schr¨odinger equation (4.1.13) has been established

From Electromagnetic Waves to Quantum Electrodynamics
49
by using a non-relativistic Hamiltonian. For a relativistic free particle
with non-zero rest mass the energy is
E2 = (c ⃗p)2 + (mc2)2
(4.2.28)
Introducing in the last expression the operator deﬁnitions (4.1.12)
for the energy and momentum we obtain the relativistic Schr¨odinger
equation
−ℏ2 ∂2
∂t2 Ψ(⃗r, t) = −ℏ2c2⃗∇2Ψ(⃗r, t) + (mc2)2Ψ(⃗r, t)
(4.2.29)
The last equation is usually called Klein-Gordon equation and is
employed mainly for the description of a relativistic free particle with
zero-spin. The presence of the second derivative with respect to time
in (4.2.29) was rather bothering for Dirac who was looking for a ﬁrst
order diﬀerential equation. He managed to overcome the diﬃculty
related to the expression of the Hamiltonian through the square root
of the energy by linearizing the equation. For that, he assumed that
a vector ⃗α and a scalar matrix β, both independent of E, ⃗p,⃗r and t
should exist for the following equation to hold
E =

(c ⃗p)2 + (mc2)2 = c ⃗α · ⃗p + β mc2
(4.2.30)
Using again (4.1.12) we get directly the Dirac equation

iℏ∂
∂t + iℏc ⃗α · ⃗∇−β mc2

Ψl = 0
(4.2.31)
where Ψl is now a column matrix with l components.
This is a ﬁrst order time diﬀerential equation for which the Dirac
Hamiltonian HD writes
HD = −iℏc ⃗α · ⃗∇+ β mc2
(4.2.32)
Obviously, for HD to be Hermitian the matrices α and β have
to be Hermitian too. On the other hand, each component of the Ψl
column matrix has to satisfy the equation (4.2.29). Hence, it has been
demonstrated that these conditions are fulﬁlled by α and β matrices
of minimum dimensions 4×4. This corresponds to the description of a
spin 1/2 particle whose wave function involve two spin states, but also

50
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
of its anti-particle. Consequently, the Dirac equation has the merit
to be capable of predicting the existence of spin 1/2 antiparticles.

We can easily verify that α and β are Hermitian, α = α+ and β = β+.
Thus, the Dirac equation is well appropriate for the description
of spin 1/2 particles and antiparticles and is considered as one of the
greatest achievements of modern physics.
4.3. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
and the Photon Description
Brief description of selected experiments that have historically
played an important role for the introduction of the photon concept.
We have seen in 4.1 that for the interpretation of black body
radiation, Planck was the ﬁrst to introduce the revolutionary idea of
the quantized absorptions and emissions of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
by oscillators.
In this chapter, we will discuss the main experiments that have
led to the particle concept of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and then we
will describe the theoretical methods that have been developed, in
order to transit from the continuous electromagnetic waves to the
quantum electromagnetic entity called the photon.

• The photoelectric eﬀect and the quantum interpretation
By the end of the 19th century, it has been observed by many
physicists like Hertz, Lenard, Stoletov and others, that metal surfaces
eject charged particles when irradiated by ultraviolet light. In a series
of experiments measuring the charge to mass ratio of the ejected
charged particles, Lenard demonstrated that these were electrons
and the eﬀect was called photoelectric.
Based on Planck’s ideas on the quantized emission of radiation
by the equally quantized energy levels of atomic oscillators for the
interpretation of the black body radiation, Einstein proposed in 1905,
an explanation for the photoelectric eﬀect. He advanced that light
consists of point particles, called photons, carrying an amount of
energy proportional to the frequency of the light E = hν, where h is
Planck’s constant.
Hence, considering that a minimum work W is required for an
electron to escape from the surface of the metal, he deduced that the
maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron is simply obtained by
Ekin = mu2
2
= hν −W
(4.3.1)
From 1914 to 1917, Millikan carried out many experiments on
the photoelectric eﬀect using the visible light on lithium, potassium
and sodium, all of these characterized by low values of the extraction
work W and conﬁrmed the last relation.
• Compton scattering
Modiﬁcations of the wavelength of X-rays when scattered by elec-
trons have been reported by many experiments between 1912 and
1920. In 1922, for the interpretation of the experimental observations,
Compton, who had carried out many similar experiments himself,
proposed the revolutionary concept that X-rays whose wavelength is
modiﬁed are scattered in crystals by electrons almost at rest.
The theoretical aspect of this eﬀect is described by considering not
only electrons but also photons as integral particles and by applying
the energy and momentum conservation laws.

Consider an X-ray photon with frequency ν colliding with an elec-
tron with rest mass m0 which after the collision acquires momentum.
The energy conservation law writes
hν + m0c2 = hν′ + mc2 ⇒h(ν −ν′) = (m −m0)c2

nature of the photon, which is characterized by energy, momentum
and directionality.
Finally, what is also extremely important here is that the Comp-
ton scattering demonstrates that the energy of a single photon, by
the same token, its wavelength and frequency, can be modiﬁed during
a collisional process.
• Low intensity Young’s double-slit interferences
As we have seen in the historical survey, Young performed the
famous double-slit experiment in 1802, obtaining an interference pat-
tern that could be only explained by the wave theory of the light.
At that time, it was the strongest argument supporting the wave
concept of the light against Newton’s particle hypothesis.
However, in 1909, Taylor repeated the same experiments by using
extremely low intensity light sources (Fig. 4.3.1) and observed that
“spots” were appearing on a photographic plate whose graduate
accumulation tended to form interference patterns.
This was readily interpreted by many authors as a demonstra-
tion of the photons existence. More recently, using lasers and single
photon pulse techniques, many experiments have also revealed the
creation of spots on the detection screen and the gradual formation
of interference pattern.

• Second quantization
The photoelectric eﬀect, Compton’s scattering and Taylor’s
experiments, among others, have given a decisive impulse toward the
general acceptance of the particle nature of light and consequently,
a theoretical eﬀort had started to model the quantized electromag-
netic ﬁeld based upon the harmonic oscillator quantum mechani-
cal model described in (4.2) satisfying Schr¨odinger’s equation. Along
these developments the question of the photon wave function arise
as well that of the photon position operator.
• Quantization process of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
We will give now the main lines of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
quantization procedure, which is generally described in the Coulomb
gauge.
Considering that the electromagnetic ﬁeld vector potential ⃗A(⃗r, t)
consists of a superposition of plane waves, the classical electromag-
netic ﬁeld energy in a given volume V can be written according to
(3.4.8) as
EV = 2ε0V

k,λ
ω2
k|Akλ|2
(4.3.9)
where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and |Akλ| the vector potential
amplitude corresponding to the mode with a wave vector k, angular
frequency ωk and polarization λ. Caution has to be taken here not to
confuse two diﬀerent physical entities, number of polarizations and
wavelength, which are both denoted in QED with λ.
Notice that (4.3.9) derives from (3.4.8), which is a mean value over
a period, in other words over the wavelength. It is generally accepted
that it is diﬃcult to conceive a photon along the propagation axis
with dimensions less than the wavelength. On the other hand, all the
calculations on the guided propagation of the electromagnetic waves
developed in Chapter 3 (3.5) show that a minimum volume has to
be considered for a given mode to subsist. Consequently, caution
has to be taken when using the formalism (4.3.9) in a volume V of
given dimensions for the total energy calculation based on the modes
summation.

From Electromagnetic Waves to Quantum Electrodynamics
55
In fact, for a ﬁxed volume V we can write more rigorously
EEM = 2ε0V

k≥kc,λ
ω2
k|Akλ|2
(4.3.10)
where the summation on the wave vectors has a lower cut-oﬀlimit
deﬁned by the boundary conditions of the box dimensions V . For the
sake of simplicity we will drop this lower limit in the next calcula-
tions, which comes out to consider that the volume V is much bigger
than the wavelengths of the modes considered.
The equivalence with the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian is
obtained by introducing equivalent expressions with the deﬁnitions
(4.2.21) and (4.2.22), relating Akλ to the canonical variables of posi-
tion Qkλ and momentum Pkλ
Akλ =

(4.3.11)
Using the above relations in (4.3.9), the energy of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld writes as a function of Qkλ and Pkλ
EEM = 1

(4.3.12)
Comparing the last relation with (4.2.25), it can be deduced
directly that each mode of the radiation ﬁeld can be considered equiv-
alent to a harmonic oscillator.
In order to express the amplitude of the vector potential with
respect to the quantized energy of the photons ℏω, we start from
the monochromatic electromagnetic wave energy density equation
(3.4.7). The energy density of N photons in a box V equals the mean
energy density over a period 2π/ω of the classical electromagnetic

(4.3.13)
Consequently, for N = 1 in the relation (4.3.13), we obtain
the link between the classical electromagnetic wave issued from
Maxwell’s equations and the quantized ﬁeld operators used in QED,
which is expressed by the intermediate of the vector potential ampli-
tude in a volume V as follows
Akλ =


kλ =

(4.3.14)
Where akλ and a+
kλ are respectively the annihilation and creation
operators of a k mode and λ polarization photon composing the
photon number operator ˆNkλ = a+
kλakλ.
Using the above expressions for the amplitude of the vector poten-
tial the classical formalism of equation (3.4.2) becomes in QED, when
taking into account all k modes and polarizations λ,
⃗A (⃗r, t) =



ℏ
2ε0ωkV [akλˆεkλei(⃗k·⃗r−ωkt+θ) + a+
kλˆε∗

(4.3.15)
According to (4.2.26), the creation and annihilation operators of
a k mode and λ polarization photon have the properties
a+
kλ|nkλ⟩=
√
nkλ + 1|nkλ + 1⟩
akλ|nkλ⟩= √nkλ|nkλ −1⟩
a+
kλakλ|nkλ⟩= ˆNkλ|nkλ⟩= nkλ|nkλ⟩
(4.3.16)
where the eigenvalue of the photon number operator expresses the
number of photons.
Using the link expressions (4.3.14) in the equations of Qkλ and Pkλ
given in (4.3.11), one obtains the position and momentum operators
expressed with respect to akλ and a+

Replacing the canonical variables Qkλ and Pkλ in equation
(4.3.12) by the expressions of ˆQkλ and ˆPkλ (4.3.17) and considering
the commutation relation [akλ, a+
kλ] = 1 we get the Hamiltonian of

(4.3.18)
Hence, in QED, photons are considered as point particles created
and annihilated by the operators a+
kλ and akλ respectively which obey
the properties of (4.3.16), and having the energy of an ensemble of
harmonic oscillators given by (4.3.18).
Generally, the polarization λ takes two values corresponding to
Right- and Left-hand circularly polarized photons.
The term 1/2 of the established radiation Hamiltonian is an occu-
pation operator, which rigorously means that in complete absence
of photons, i.e., when ˆNkλ = 0, empty space is ﬁlled permanently
by “half” photons of all frequencies and polarizations. Hence, the
quantization procedure of the classical expression of the energy of
the electromagnetic waves to get the radiation Hamiltonian leads
to the zero-point radiation ﬁeld, also called the quantum vacuum,
expressed by the term 
k,λ

2ℏωk. This term is mainly responsible
for the QED singularities related to the inﬁnite energy of the vacuum,
while at the same time it is used in many semi-classical descriptions
for the explanation of various experimentally observed eﬀects, such
as spontaneous emission, atomic levels energy shifts (Lamb shift),
the Casimir eﬀect etc.
• The Photon Wave Function
In the ﬁrst quantization process that we have brieﬂy described
in 4.1 and 4.2 particles with non-zero mass in a quantum state
are characterized by a wave function Ψ(⃗r, t), depending on space
and time, which satisﬁes Schr¨odinger’s equation (4.1.13) with eigen-
values the energy corresponding to the given quantum state. The
wave functions i.e. for the stationary quantum states of a particle
in a square or harmonic potential well are given by (4.1.26/27) and

58
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
(4.2.13) respectively. In the second quantization process the wave
functions for massive particles are expressed through operators.
The photon, as a relativistic massless particle, constitutes a par-
ticular case and the proposed wave functions published in the litera-
ture until now are not generally accepted. An important theoretical
diﬃculty, among others, lays in the fact that the photon is not
considered as a “localizable particle” and consequently a position
operator cannot be deﬁned. Furthermore, even the concept of a time-
dependent wave function for the photon is rejected by some authors.
Nevertheless, various fruitful attempts have been carried out in
order to establish a full photon wave function and can be found in the
bibliography of this Chapter. The most pertinent theoretical devel-
opments are based on the complex vector function ⃗F(⃗r, t) initially
introduced by Riemann
⃗F(⃗r, t) =
1
2√ε0
⃗D(⃗r, t) + i
1
2√µ0
⃗B(⃗r, t)
(4.3.19)
where the real functions of the electric displacement ﬂux density
⃗D(⃗r, t) and the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux density ⃗B(⃗r, t) have been deﬁned
in (3.1.4).
Using ⃗F(⃗r, t) the Maxwell’s equations for homogeneous medium
can be written in the following compact form
i ∂
∂t
⃗F(⃗r, t) = c⃗∇× ⃗F(⃗r, t)
(4.3.20)
⃗∇· ⃗F(⃗r, t) = 0
(4.3.21)
In this way, a proposed photon wave function can be deﬁned as
Φ(⃗r, t) =


(4.3.24)
The photon wave function Φ(⃗r, t) deﬁned in (4.3.22) does not
involve a position operator but due to the presence of the complex
Riemann ﬁeld ⃗F(⃗r, t) its square modulus provides the electromag-
netic ﬁeld energy density (3.2.29) at an instant t and at a given
coordinate ⃗r on the propagation axis

space the bilinear form of the complex vector function ⃗F(⃗r, t) getting
E =

⃗F ∗(⃗r, t) · ⃗F(⃗r, t) d3r
(4.3.26)
Some diﬀerent versions from the one described above have been
advanced for the photon wave function but without introducing a real
progress in the problem of position operator which still remains an
open question in the ﬁeld of the photon localization representation
formalism which is tightly related to the experimental conditions.
Mandel was the ﬁrst to introduce the deﬁnition of a “detection oper-
ator” for the interpretation of the photon detection experiments that
he was carrying out in the 60s

By the intermediate of this “detection operator” a local “photon

˜n(V ) =

It has been thus demonstrated that the localization region for a
k-mode photon cannot be shorter than its wavelength λk and conse-
quently the localization volume has to satisfy the condition

(4.3.29)
This is an important theoretical and experimental result that will
be quite useful for the development of a non-local description for the
photon which will be discussed in the following chapters.
4.4. Interaction between Electromagnetic Waves
and Charged Particles, Reality of the Vector Potential
• Interaction Hamiltonian between an electromagnetic wave and a
charged particle
The interaction Hamiltonian of a charged particle of charge q and
mass m, having a momentum ⃗p, in an electromagnetic ﬁeld charac-
terized by a vector potential ⃗A(⃗r, t) and a scalar potential Φ(⃗r, t) is
written as
H =
1
2m(⃗p −q ⃗A (⃗r, t))2 + qΦ(⃗r, t)
(4.4.1)
Using the Coulomb gauge
⃗∇· ⃗A(⃗r, t) = 0
and
Φ(⃗r, t) = 0
(4.4.2)
and considering the momentum operator (4.2.7), the time dependent
Schr¨odinger equation for an electron, where q = −e, in the electro-
static Coulomb potential of an hydrogenic atom −Ze2
4πε0r, interacting
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld writes

In fact, it can be easily shown that the Coulomb gauges makes ⃗A
and ⃗∇· to commute
⃗∇· ( ⃗AΨ) = ⃗A · (⃗∇Ψ) + (⃗∇· ⃗A)Ψ = ⃗A · (⃗∇Ψ)
(4.4.4)

From Electromagnetic Waves to Quantum Electrodynamics
61
In the case of weak ﬁelds, the term of the square of the vector
potential in Schrodinger equation is quite small compared to the
linear one and consequently, the main part of the interaction Hamil-
tonian between the bounded electron and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
writes
Hint(t) ∼= −iℏe
m
⃗A(⃗r, t) · ⃗∇
(4.4.5)
which is time dependent because of the vector potential.
From the established interaction Hamiltonian, arises the question
whether the vector potential represents a mathematical artifact or if
it corresponds to a physical entity.
• Reality of the vector potential, Ehrenberg–Siday or Aharonov–
Bohm eﬀect.
Obviously, according to the Hamiltonian (4.4.1), the vector poten-
tial directly aﬀects the modulus and the direction of the momentum
of a charged particle.
In 1949, W. Ehrenberg and R.E. Siday were the ﬁrst to deduce
the eﬀect of the vector potential of the electromagnetic ﬁelds on
charged particles. The Ehrenberg–Siday eﬀect is a ﬁne demonstra-
tion of the real existence of the scalar and vector ﬁelds issued from
the electromagnetic theory. In fact, before Ehrenberg’s and Siday’s
works, the vector and scalar ﬁelds, ⃗A(⃗r, t); Φ(⃗r, t) respectively, were
believed to be simply mathematical constructs for the development
of the gauge theories in electromagnetism. In reality, both of these
potentials interact with a charged particle even in absence of electric
and magnetic ﬁelds.
The same eﬀects were later rediscovered by Aharonov and Bohm
in 1959 and were conﬁrmed experimentally by Chambers in 1960 and
Osakabe in 1986 using a quite advanced experimental apparatus.
From a theoretical point of view the behavior of a charged particle
with charge q and mass m in the vicinity of a solenoid is described
by the Hamiltonian (4.4.1). In the case of a very long solenoid along
the z axis the magnetic ﬁeld is uniform in the region inside and
zero outside. Considering that the solenoid is not charged the scalar
potential Φ can be put to zero. However, the vector potential in the

62

outside region is not zero and depends on the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux in
the solenoid

(4.4.6)
where r is the radial distance from the z axis, S is the surface enclosed
in a circle with radius r perpendicular to z and ˆeθ the angular unit
vector in cylindrical coordinates.
Using the expression of the momentum operator from (4.1.12)
Schr¨odinger’s equation for the charged particle in the vector potential
region and in complete absence of any external potential (V (⃗r, t) = 0)
writes

where ⃗A is given by (4.4.6).

The exponential part of the wave function (4.4.8) entails that two
identical particles with equal charge, propagating both at the same

with the vector potential ⃗A and the second in the opposite direction,
will suﬀer a phase diﬀerence

Indeed, interference patterns for electrons in analogues condi-
tions have been observed experimentally with the phase diﬀerence

potential is not a mathematical artefact and interacts directly with
charged particles in full absence of magnetic and electric ﬁelds.

4.5. Transition Rates and Vacuum Induced
Spontaneous Emission
For describing the transitions between the quantized energy levels
of the atoms, we have started in the previous chapter, deﬁning the
interaction Hamiltonian (4.4.1) of a charged particle in an electro-
magnetic ﬁeld characterized by a vector potential ⃗A(⃗r, t) and a scalar
potential Φ(⃗r, t).
Hence, the interaction Hamiltonian is a time dependent pertur-
bation and can be studied within the time dependent perturbation
theory according to which the wave function Ψ(⃗r, t) is expended in
terms of the unperturbed eigenfunctions ϕl(⃗r), solutions of the time
independent Schr¨odinger equation

(4.5.2)
where the summation runs over all the discrete and continuous sets
of the eigenfunctions ϕl(⃗r). The time dependence is included in the

the vector potential (3.4.2), we obtain the transition probability
amplitude at a given instant t by integrating within an angular fre-
quency interval δω and over the time interval from 0 to t

• Photoelectric eﬀect and the semi-classical interpretation
At that level, within a chapter that deals mainly with the photon,
we will make a parenthesis to present brieﬂy the way Wentzel and
Beck in 1926, Lamb and Scully in 1960s demonstrated that the photo-
electric eﬀect may quite well be interpreted using the electromagnetic
wave nature of the light.
In fact, we can calculate the transition rate in the case of the
photoelectric eﬀect from (4.5.6) and (4.5.8), exactly in the same way
as in the previous paragraph

(4.5.16)
Between an initial bounded state and the continuum level, Dirac
delta function guarantees that the energy of the photoelectron sat-
isﬁes the photoelectric equation. The rate of the emission is directly
proportional to the square modulus of the radiation vector potential,
and consequently to the ﬁeld intensity. Obviously, because of (4.5.14),
the calculated transition rate for the photoelectric eﬀect is valid for
time periods t ≫ω−1 and consequently for visible and UV light, it
predicts the emission of electrons without any delay.
As remarked by many authors, a semi-classical calculation, in
which the electromagnetic ﬁeld is strictly considered with the
classical wave expressions, gives an excellent interpretation of the
photoelectric eﬀect without the introduction of the photon con-
cept. Recalling that the photoelectric eﬀect is used experimentally
to detect photons, this is a quite upsetting result.
• Spontaneous emission rate
As we have discussed in (4.3.18) in the QED description, the
vacuum state is composed by an inﬁnite quantity of photons of all
frequencies and polarizations 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk. Consequently, in order to
describe the spontaneous emission we have to use the expression
(4.3.15) for the vector potential, since in the classical electromagnetic
theory the vacuum has no electromagnetic ﬁelds and consequently
(3.4.2) is zero.

The special interest on the spontaneous emission arises from the
fact that it results from the coupling of the atomic levels to the

wavelength of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is too big with respect to
the atomic dimension, i.e., when kr ≪1, the exponential in (4.5.7)

Finally, it can be demonstrated that the interaction Hamilto-
nian between an electron and the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the dipole
approximation can be simply written
Hint = −⃗D · ⃗E(⃗r, t) = −e⃗r · ⃗E(⃗r, t)
(4.5.26)
with ⃗D = e⃗r the electric dipole moment of the electron with charge
e at the position ⃗r from the nucleus and ⃗E (⃗r, t), the electric ﬁeld of
the electromagnetic wave obtained by the vector potential according
to (3.3.15).
• The photon spin
Conservation of angular momentum during spectroscopy exper-
iments has shown that each photon has a component of angular
momentum along the propagation axis of magnitude ±ℏ. This cor-
responds to the intrinsic spin of photons whose component along
the propagation axis is also called helicity. A left-hand circularly
polarized photon has an helicity of +ℏwhile a right-hand circularly
polarized photon has an helicity of −ℏ.
Consequently, the λ subscript in the creation and annihilation
operators takes two values corresponding to L and R circular polar-
izations and the total spin angular momentum of an ensemble of
photons propagating along the z axis writes in a the general operator
form
⃗S = ℏ

k
(a+
k,Lak,L −a+

(4.5.27)
According to (3.4.12) the polarizations Πκλ for L and R k-mode
photons when considering the propagation function along z are
expressed as follows
|Πk,L⟩=

(4.5.28)
The combination of an ensemble of photons with circular polar-
izations can give rise to an elliptical polarization which is the one
mainly observed from the classical sources of light in nature. The
use of appropriate ﬁlters permits the selection of R, L or even linear
polarization for experimental purposes.

4.6. Lamb Shift
• Nonrelativistic calculations: Bethe’s approach
The energy diﬀerence between the energy levels 2S1/2 and 2P3/2
of the atomic hydrogen was measured precisely by W.E. Lamb and
R.C. Retherford in 1947 using microwave technics. They obtained a
value of 4.5 × 10−5 eV, which was not explained by Dirac’s theory,
which predict these two levels to have the same energy.
With the development of QED and the introduction of the notion
of the quantum vacuum, many scientists advanced the hypothesis
that the experimentally observed shifts of the atomic levels, named
Lamb shifts, are due to the interaction of the bounded electrons with
the vacuum. The ﬁrst to propose a theoretical interpretation was
H.A. Bethe in 1947 by introducing an astonishing way for extracting
ﬁnite quantities from singularities. We reproduce brieﬂy here those
calculations.
Since the basis of the hypothesis is the interaction of an elec-
tron with the vacuum photons, we go back to Schr¨odinger equation
(4.4.3) and start by examining the contributions of the vector poten-
tial terms.
The quadratic term of the vector potential contributes in the
same manner to all atomic states since it does not contain atomic
operators

The (4.6.1) expression is inﬁnite. However, it is fully neglected
based on the argument that it does not induce “measurable energy
shifts”.
Now, starting again from (4.4.3) and considering (4.5.15), the sec-
ond order perturbation theory gives the energy shifts to the atomic
levels, due to the coupling with the quantum vacuum resulting from
the linear term of the vector potential in the interaction Hamiltonian

As in the case of the quadratic term of the vector potential, the
obtained expression (4.6.3) for the energy shift ∆El( ⃗A) induced by
the linear part of the vector potential is also inﬁnite.
To circumvent this diﬃculty, Bethe introduced a renormalisation
procedure. In fact, for a free electron in the vacuum ﬁeld, all the
values of the atomic levels energy diﬀerences El −Ef are zero so that

levels |f⟩up to the continuum spectrum, Bethe found for the 2S
hydrogen level, an energy shift corresponding to a frequency of about
1000 MHz, in good agreement with the experimental value.
4.7. Conclusion Remarks
Some quite important concepts and calculation methodologies have
been developed in this chapter.
The second quantization processes introduced the link equations
(4.3.14) for the vector potential amplitude between the electromag-
netic wave expressions and those of the QED creation and anni-
hilation operators. This permitted to establish the correspondence
between the electromagnetic wave and the harmonic oscillators in
quantum mechanics establishing the Hamiltonian of the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld (4.3.18). The validity of this process will be
discussed in the next chapters. Note that the link equations (4.3.14)
etc., obtained by considering the mean value of the energy density
of the electromagnetic wave over a period, in other words over a
wavelength, are put equal to the value of a point photon with energy
ℏω in a given volume V .
Furthermore, we have seen that the interaction Hamiltonian
between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the charged particles is

74
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
expressed through the vector potential, a real physical entity, ﬁrst
demonstrated by Ehrenberg and Siday. The same interaction Hamil-
tonian has been employed by Wentzel, Beck, Lamb and Scully to
demonstrate that the photoelectric eﬀect, generally advanced as a
demonstration of the particle nature of the light, can quite well be
interpreted through the electromagnetic wave representation.
Finally, we have brieﬂy presented two important eﬀects of the
vacuum-electron interactions, the spontaneous emission and the
Lamb shift, which will extensively discussed in the next chapters.
Many authors have discussed and commented Bethe’s nonrelativis-
tic calculations for the Lamb shift. P.A.M. Dirac was the ﬁrst to
argue that intelligent mathematics consists of neglecting negligi-
ble quantities and not inﬁnite quantities because, simply, you don’t
want them. In fact, the original method that Bethe introduced was
to calculate ﬁnite quantities by subtracting and neglecting inﬁnite
quantities. However, as many authors remarked, what is extremely
puzzling is that after manipulating and ignoring inﬁnite quanti-
ties, after imposing arbitrary integration limits, after considering
mean logarithmic values over an inﬁnity of atomic energy levels near
the continuum, “the ﬁnal result compares “remarkably well” to the
experiment”.
We have not presented in this chapter, the relativistic calculation
of the Lamb shift, developed and published in 1949 by Kroll et al.
because the calculations are extremely tedious. Nevertheless, we have
to mention that even in this approach various approximations are
introduced and a “diﬀerent” mean logarithmic value is employed.
Furthermore, it seems that the upper integration limit appears natu-
rally in the relativistic approach, however, the author, as the major-
ity of the authors in the literature, has not attempted to reproduce
completely these calculations.

Chapter 5
Theory, Experiments and Questions
In what follows, we analyze the questions raised from the quantum
theory of radiation and we point out the mathematical diﬃculties
encountered mainly from the second quantization procedure which
has been developed to provide photons description from the quantum
point of view. We ﬁrst make a theoretical analysis of some particular
aspects of QED, including the well known singularities, and then we
present some experiments which strongly support the simultaneous
wave-particle nature of photons.
5.1. Planck’s Constant and the Vacuum Intrinsic
Electromagnetic Properties
The correspondence for the energy between the electromagnetic wave
theory and the Quantum electrodynamics (QED) describing the same
entity, the light, is given by the well-known expression
E (ω) = ℏω ↔E (ω, A0(ω)) =

V
2ε0ω2A2
0(ω,⃗r) d3r
(5.1.1)
In QED, the energy of the photon ℏω depends only on the angu-
lar frequency of the electromagnetic wave ω and it is proportional to
Planck’s reduced constant ℏ, while the vacuum electric permittivity
constant ε0 and the vector potential amplitude A0(ω), which both
play a major role in the classical electromagnetic wave description
(3.4.8), are totally ignored. On the other hand, it is obvious that the
knowledge of the angular frequency alone is not suﬃcient in the clas-
sical electromagnetic theory in order to deduce the electromagnetic
ﬁeld energy. The vector potential amplitude is indispensable.

Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
Consequently, for (5.1.1) to be physically coherent, ℏshould be
related to both the vacuum electric permittivity ε0 and the vector
potential amplitude A0(ω).
Indeed, ℏis related to ε0 through the ﬁne structure constant αFS
(4.6.4) according to the relation:
ℏ=
 e2
4πε0
 

cαFS

(5.1.2)
where e is the electron charge.
From the last equation one can also express in QED, the energy
of a photon depending on ε0 as follows
E(ω) = ℏω =
 e2
4πε0
 

cαFS

ω
(5.1.3)
According to (5.1.3), one may assume that the absolute value of
the energy of a photon with an angular frequency ω corresponds to
the Coulomb interaction between an electron and a positron sepa-
rated by the characteristic distance lω
lω = cαFS
ω
= αFS
λ
2π
(5.1.4)
where λ is the wavelength.
However, it is puzzling to note that the expression (5.1.3), intro-
duces the charge of the electron and the ﬁne structure constant which
essentially characterize the atomic energy levels. Consequently, one
could naturally wonder why these physical quantities should be nec-
essary to describe the energy of light in vacuum, in complete absence
of charges and matter? In fact, the electron (positron) and the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld are strongly related physical entities. Under par-
ticular conditions, in the presence of a strong electric ﬁeld like in
the vicinity of a heavy nucleus, a high energy gamma photon can be
annihilated, giving birth to an electron and a positron. Of course,
the probability of such a phenomenon is extremely low and becomes
signiﬁcant for a nucleus of Z ∼140, which is physically instable.
Nevertheless, Fulcher et al. have argued that such a nuclear state
could be created during the collision of two nuclei of large Z. Thus,
we can say that (5.1.3) is a simple relation which implies directly that
the electron (positron) and the electromagnetic waves are physical

entities that might be issued from the same quantum ﬁeld related to
vacuum. This aspect will be further analyzed in the next chapter and
an exact relation will be established expressing precisely the electron
charge with respect to the constants characterizing the vacuum.
Now, we have seen that we can easily establish a relation between
ℏand the vacuum permittivity ε0 through the ﬁne structure con-
stant αFS but what would be the dependence of the vector potential
amplitude A0(ω) on Planck’s constant for a single photon guessed
by (5.1.1)? In a coherent description of the photon as a quantum
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, this relation should be independent of
any external parameter such as the volume V involved in the link
equations (4.3.14).
We will also explore the possibility of such a relation in the next
chapter.
5.2. Hamiltonian Issued from the Quantization
of the Electromagnetic Field
Let us go back to the quantization procedure of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. When we introduce the link expressions (4.3.14), directly in the
relation of the energy of the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld (4.3.9), we
obtain the following radiation Hamiltonians
HEM =

It is very important to note that it is impossible to get HEM =

energy expression (4.3.9), the “normal ordering” is used or not.

Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
This mathematical ambiguity, which leads to a quite diﬀerent phys-
ical interpretation of the radiation zero-level state, demonstrates the
lack of a coherent mathematical transition from the classical to the
quantum mechanical formalism of the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy.
Consequently, a strong doubt may arise in whether the term

k,λ
1
2ℏωk, corresponding to the vacuum energy in (4.3.18) represents
a real physical state since it is not in reality a natural consequence of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld quantization. Hence, we will analyze in next
chapters, the reasons for which one obtains diﬀerent expressions for
the zero-point energy. Also we will show how the relation (4.3.12)
has to be transformed to ensure a coherent transition between the
classical electromagnetic wave energy and the quantum mechanical
Hamiltonian, in order to eliminate this mathematical ambiguity.
5.3. QED Singularities
Let us consider the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (4.3.18)
in complete absence of photons, that is when Nk,λ = 0, which
becomes
Hvacuum =

k,λ
1
2ℏωk
(5.3.1)
The summation runs over all modes k and polarizations λ. Hence,
as it has been mentioned in Chapter 4 (4.3.1), the vacuum in the QED
description consists of an inﬁnite sea of “photons” corresponding to
the state |Nk,λ = 0, ∀{k, λ}⟩corresponding to inﬁnite energy.
In this context, the vacuum electromagnetic energy density is
Wvacuum = 1

using (4.6.2) and considering two polarizations, we get

(5.3.3)
which is also inﬁnite. However, when considering “reasonable” cut-
oﬀs for the upper limit of the integration, that is an angular frequency
of ∼1043 Hz rad corresponding to Planck’s energy 1019 GeV, the

Theory, Experiments and Questions
81
values obtained in QED for the vacuum energy density are generally
of the order 10110 J/m3.
When limited in the visible region, situated in the wavelengths
range between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms, the energy density calcu-
lated using (5.3.3) corresponds roughly to 22 J/m3, which represents
a tremendous amount of energy in space which is fully unobservable
experimentally. Recent astronomical observations have demonstrated
that the measured vacuum energy density in space is 10−9 J/m3, that
is roughly a hundred of orders of magnitude less than that predicted
by QED theory. The huge discrepancy between the theoretical and
the measured values of the vacuum energy has been called the “quan-
tum vacuum catastrophe.”
On the other hand, the quantized radiation electric ﬁeld ⃗E(⃗r, t) is
obtained using the vector potential expression (4.3.15) and (3.3.15)
in the Coulomb gauge
⃗E(⃗r, t) = −∂⃗A(⃗r, t)

(5.3.4)
where ˆεkλ is a polarization vector. Consequently, the expectation
value of the photons electric ﬁeld in vacuum within a volume V is
given by the expression
⟨E(⃗r)2⟩vacuum =

k,λ

(5.3.5)
which is also inﬁnite.
Although the summation of (5.3.5) is divergent we can deduce the
electric ﬁeld |⃗εk| of a single k−mode photon state
|⃗εk| =

Using classical plane wave considerations the magnetic ﬁeld |⃗βk| =
√ε0µ0|⃗εk| of a single photon can be written
|⃗βk| =

(5.3.7)
As quoted by many authors in the literature, the last relations
signify that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a single photon depend
directly on an external arbitrary volume parameter V . However,
this is physically an intriguing result because the volume V is not
involved explicitly in the classical expression of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld energy density (3.4.7) even when it is space localized within a
wavelength (3.4.8). From the quantum point of view it is diﬃcult
to conciliate the concept of a point particle having precise energy
and momentum with that of an electromagnetic plane wave whose
electric and magnetic ﬁelds amplitudes are dependent on an external
volume. This particular concept will be further discussed in the next
chapter.
5.4. Electron-Vacuum Interactions and the Associated Eﬀects
The presence of the vacuum energy singularity in the quantised radi-
ation ﬁeld Hamiltonian Hvacuum = 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk constitutes the fun-
damental argument generally found in the literature, in order to
explain some physical eﬀects such as the spontaneous emission, Lamb
displacements in atomic levels as well as the Casimir eﬀect. The ter-
minology usually employed for that purpose uses the term “vacuum
ﬂuctuations”, though in most cases no mathematical representation
of any kind of ﬂuctuation is explicitly presented. Some authors pre-
fer using the term “virtual photons” for the vacuum Hamiltonian.
However, we could naturally wonder why the ﬁrst term of the Hamil-
tonian (4.3.18) is considered as real while the second one as “virtual”.
Nevertheless, it is absolutely certain that the last eﬀects are due
to the electron-vacuum interactions and cannot be calculated using a
semi-classical model, in which the atomic energy levels are quantized
while the electric ﬁeld is represented by a classical wave equation
in the interaction Hamiltonian. The reason is simply that in the
classical description, the vacuum has no electromagnetic waves and

Theory, Experiments and Questions
83
consequently, ⃗E(⃗r, t) in the interaction Hamiltonian Hint in (4.5.26)
is zero. Conversely, in QED, according to the radiation Hamiltonian
(4.3.18), the vacuum is considered to be composed by photons of all
modes and polarizations, permitting one to consider an interaction
Hamiltonian.
Now, the above eﬀects are due to the interaction between an
electron in a given atomic state and the vacuum. Consequently, for
their description the term 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk of the Hamiltonian (4.3.18),
which is the eigenvalue of the fundamental radiation eigenstate
| . . . , 0k,λ, . . . , 0k′,λ′, . . .⟩, corresponding to the vacuum state, should
be of high importance.
However, as we will see in the following, this singularity has no
implication in the mathematical interpretation of those eﬀects.
• Spontaneous emission
We recall the total Hamiltonian of an atom in the presence of an
electromagnetic ﬁeld in the dipole approximation:
Htot = HEM + Hint + Hatom
=

k,λ
ℏωk

ˆNkλ + 1


−⃗D · ⃗E(⃗r, t) +

(5.4.1)
where ⃗D = e⃗r is the dipole moment of an atomic electron of charge e
according to (4.5.26) and |Ψi⟩the atomic levels with the correspond-
ing energies ℏωi.
The spontaneous emission rate is always calculated in QED
neglecting 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk in Htot and using the expression (5.3.4) for
the electric ﬁeld ⃗E(⃗r, t).
Therein, we recall that according to Heisenberg’s equation of
motion (4.5.22.a), the electric ﬁeld writes
⃗E(⃗r, t) = −∂⃗A(⃗r, t)

(5.4.2)
Consequently, for the calculation of the electric ﬁeld attributed
to the vacuum state, the term 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk should be the principal

84
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
contribution to the Hamiltonian. But the commutation operator of
the vector potential and the vacuum Hamiltonian cancels

⃗A (⃗r, t),

k,λ
1
2ℏωk

= 0
(5.4.3)
Hence, the term 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk in this representation has absolutely
no contribution in the general expression of the quantized electric
ﬁeld used to calculate the spontaneous emission.
Obviously, the vacuum eﬀect in the quantized vector potential is
involved in the commutation relation [akλ, a+
kλ] = 1 and not in the

k,λ

2ℏωk term.
Indeed, in a rigorous calculation, the interaction Hamiltonian
between an atomic electron and the vacuum writes
Hint = −⃗d · i
ℏ

⃗A (⃗r, t),

k,λ

2ℏωk

= 0
(5.4.4)
which also vanishes in QED, as in the semi-classical description.
The physical reason is that in QED, the vacuum state Hamil-
tonian is not described by a function of akλ and a+
kλ operators and
consequently it is impossible to deﬁne an interaction Hamiltonian for
the description of the electron-vacuum interaction processes.
• Lamb shift
The mathematical treatment of the quantum vacuum eﬀects upon
the atomic energy levels described in Section 4.6 is without any doubt
among the most revolutionary ones introduced in modern physics. It
consists of neglecting inﬁnite quantities for calculating ﬁnite energy
diﬀerences which are measurable experimentally.
We can now have a close look to a detailed analysis of this calcu-
lation, resuming the comments and arguments of many authors.
First, the quadratic term of the vector potential of equation
(4.6.1) is dropped out, though it’s inﬁnite. Despite the fact that
the linear term of the vector potential of equation (4.6.3) is also
inﬁnite, it is not dropped out as the quadratic one, but instead it
suﬀers a renormalization procedure which equally results in an inﬁ-
nite quantity (4.6.6). At that level one should expect that since the

Theory, Experiments and Questions
85
quadratic term, being inﬁnite, does not induce a measurable shift,
by the same token the linear term, being also inﬁnite, should also
not induce a measurable shift. Nonetheless, the linear term is kept
in the calculation and in order to “overcome” the diﬃculty, an arbi-
trary upper limit for the integration of (4.6.6) is introduced in the
nonrelativistic approach whose choice, at that level of calculation, is
not based on any experimental or physical argument. Conversely, in
the relativistic approach developed much later, the upper integration
limit seems to appear “naturally”. Consequently, one may wonder
why the same upper limit is not equally applied in the integration of
the quadratic term of the vector potential. Furthermore, the intro-
duction of a mean value for the logarithmic term (4.6.9), calculated
numerically over an indeﬁnite number of discrete states, in a diﬀerent
manner in the nonrelativistic than in the relativistic approach, gives
rise to the upsetting feeling that under these calculation conditions,
the ﬁnal obtained displacement energy is accurate compared to the
experiment.
Finally, once again, in these calculations the vacuum eﬀects on
the atomic energy levels is not due to the zero-point level of the
Hamiltonian (4.3.18). Except Bethe’s quantum mechanical approach,
various semi-classical calculations of the Lamb shift have been pub-
lished, each one by considering the inﬂuence of the vacuum upon the
atomic orbitals through diﬀerent aspects; Welton’s vacuum electric
ﬁeld perturbation, Feynman’s gas interpretation, Stark shift due to
the vacuum electric ﬁeld and so forth. It is quite interesting noticing
that almost all these physical mechanisms used for the interpretation
of the atomic energy shifts do no require any mass renormalization
process.
• Casimir eﬀect
The behavior of two perfectly conducting and uncharged parallel
plates with similar surfaces S = L × L separated by a very short
distance d(d ≪L) has been investigated ﬁrst by Casimir in 1948.
This physical situation has been then extensively studied by many
authors over half a century and of course it is out of the scope of
this book to present all these works in details. In an analogue way

with the boundary conditions expressed in two dimensions for the
electromagnetic waves guided propagation in (3.5.2) the frequencies

where n1, n2, n3 = 0, 1, 2, . . . are integers with of course two simulta-
neous zero values excluded. Based on (5.3.1) the zero-point energy
between the plates writes
Evacuum =

n1,n2,n3,λ
1
2ℏωn1n2n3
(5.4.6)
The summation is inﬁnite entailing that the vacuum energy in
the QED description is inﬁnite in every ﬁnite volume. However,
when introducing appropriate cut-oﬀ, justiﬁed by the fact that
any material becomes transparent at extremely high frequencies,
then the vacuum energy diﬀerence between that contained in a
cubic box Evacuum(L3) and that in the rectangular conﬁguration
Evacuum(L2 × d) becomes ﬁnite inducing an attractive force between
the plates which after a slightly tedious calculation writes
F(d) = −π2ℏc
240
L2
d4
(5.4.7)
Consequently, an explanation advanced for the origin of the Casimir
force is that the density of the vacuum photons outside the plates is
higher than that in the region inside inducing a radiation pressure
pushing the plates together to come closer.
From the experimental point of view, the measurement of Casimir
force presents many technical diﬃculties laying mainly in the align-
ment of perfectly parallel plates at microscopic separation distances.
The ﬁrst experiments carried out by Sparnaay in 1958 and then by
van Blokland and Overbeek in 1978 in order to measure Casimir’s
force were not quite successful and the experimental errors were very
signiﬁcant, nearly 100% and 30% respectively. However, they permit-
ted to put in evidence an attractive force between the plates.
More recent experiments mentioned by Lambrecht and Reynaud
in 2002 attained a precision of the order of 1% but they were still

Theory, Experiments and Questions
87
unable of conﬁrming neither the theoretical predictions at larger dis-
tances nor the temperature eﬀects.
On the theoretical front, it is important underlying that Schwinger
et al. in 1978, Milonni in 1982 and Ezawa in 1997 obtained the same
expression for the Casimir attraction force without invoking at all the
zero-point energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In fact, as quoted by
Milonni in 1992, a simple summation of the Van der Waals pairwise
intermolecular forces on the surfaces of the two plates gives a quite
close result to that of the Casimir force. If the interactions with
third neighboring atoms are also taken into account in the calcula-
tions then the exact Casimir force is obtained. Hiroshi Ezawa, Koichi
Nakamura and Keiji Watanabe advanced an excellent demonstration
of the Casimir eﬀect from Lorentz’s forces issued on the surfaces of
the plates by the charge currents. There in, on the question if we still
need the vacuum zero-point energy the authors give a straightforward
answer “We wish to make it clear that we don’t”.
Consequently, the previous mentioned studies demonstrate that
the Casimir force can be established from a classical electrodynamics
approach without considering at all the hypothetical energy density
diﬀerence of the vacuum photons in the regions between and outside
the plates. Despite this and despite the experimental uncertainties,
the Casimir eﬀect is considered by many authors as the principle
demonstration of the existence of the vacuum zero-point level pho-
tons involved in the Hamiltonian (4.3.18).
Finally, a further fundamental diﬃculty for the conceptual com-
prehension of the Casimir eﬀect comes from the fact that the expres-
sion of the force given in (5.4.7) is completely independent on the
electron charge which is always involved in the interactions with
the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Many authors have commented this fact
concluding that the interpretations of the Casimir eﬀect are puz-
zling. Indeed, we have to underline that the Casimir eﬀect is fairly
well interpreted through the prism of two diﬀerent physical aspects
described above, introducing a certain ambiguity in the explanations
found in the literature. Hence, it appears that higher accuracy exper-
iments are further required in order to fully conﬁrm the agreement of
the experimental measures with the theoretical interpretations and
conﬁrm the real physical origin of the Casimir eﬀect.

5.5. Simultaneous Wave-particle Nature of the Photon
Revealed by the Experiments — Discussions
• Photoelectric eﬀect, Compton’s scattering and Young’s double-slit
experiment
The photoelectric eﬀect was initially considered as a direct demon-
stration of the particle nature of light and historically was the
strongest argument of the photon concept, although Einstein had not
advanced any explanation on what could correspond the frequency
ν for a point particle.
Nevertheless, as we have seen in Chapter 4 (4.5), Wentzel in
1926 and Beck in 1927, as well as much later, Mendel, Lamb and
Scully in the 1960s, demonstrated that the photoelectric eﬀect can
be interpreted remarkably well by considering the electromagnetic
wave nature of the light issued from Maxwell’s equations without
referring at all to the photon concept.
We also have to note that Klein and Nishina had advanced an
excellent semi classical interpretation of the Compton scattering by
considering a classical plane wave approach for the incident light
and Dirac’s equation (4.2.31) for the electron. Consequently, since
both wave and particle models interpret satisfactorily the photoelec-
tric eﬀect and Compton’s scattering, they cannot be considered as a
decisive experiments for the introduction of the photon concept.
On the other side, Young’s double-slit experiment, which was ini-
tially interpreted with the wave nature of light and was used as the
strongest argument against the particle theory, was used by Taylor
at very low intensities to demonstrate the particle concept.
The interpretation of Taylor’s experiment by some authors was
based on the wave nature of a single photon permitting to pass
through both slits. Many scientists were skeptical about this inter-
pretation, as in recent similar experiments, interference patterns have
been observed with heavy atoms and molecules. Indeed, Nairz et al.
obtained recently interferences with spherical fullerenes, which are
almost six orders of magnitude bigger than a nucleon particle. It is
impossible to conceive, at least in the present stage of our knowledge
that fullerenes can pass through both slits simultaneously.

Theory, Experiments and Questions
89
In order to get a comprehensive picture of all these interference
experiments carried out with light and material particles, Jin et al.
in 2010 advanced a particle-based description of Young’s double slit
interferences without even referring to the wave theory.
Consequently,
what
can
be
essentially
deduced
from
the
experimental evidence during more than two centuries of struggling
between the wave and particle theories, is that experiments simply
conﬁrm both natures for light (and for material particles).
Bohr, although initially in favor of the wave concept, understood
quite rapidly that the only way out of this frustrating dilemma is the
wave-particle complementarity, even if this concept is hardly com-
prehensive for the human common sense.
We will now present selected recent experiments and discuss the
ﬁnal results with respect to the second quantization procedure.
• Mizobuchi and Ohtake double-prism experiment
Since Bohr announced his famous complementarity principle
expressing that light has simultaneously both the wave and particle
nature, appearing mutually exclusive in every physical situation, the
opposition between the defenders of the wave or particle theories had
ceased. However, the majority of scientists were skeptical about the
wave-particle simultaneity which is not at all comprehensive for the
human mind.
With the development of lasers and the revolutionary parametric
down converters techniques, it becomes possible to realize conditions
in which, with a very high degree of statistical accuracy, only one
photon is present in the experimental apparatus. Hence, in order to
test Bohr’s complementarity principle, Ghose, Home and Agarwal,
proposed in 1991, the double prism experiment which was carried
out by Mizobuchi and Ohtake in 1992.
A single photon pulse goes through two prisms separated by
an air gap whose thickness is less than the incident photon wave-
length (Fig. 5.5.1). In these conditions, classical electromagnetic wave
theory predicts a tunneling eﬀect for the wave-like photon, according
to which the wave will traverse the air gap straightforward and will be
detected by Detector 1. On the other hand, a particle-like photon will

be reﬂected by the inner wall of the ﬁrst prism and will be detected
by Detector 2. Both detectors are connected to a coincidence counter
in order to detect any eventual coincidence.
The experiment results have shown very strong anti-coincidence
entailing that a single photon state goes either through the gap
by wave tunneling or is reﬂected by the ﬁrst prism like a particle.
Consequently, both the wave and the particle natures of the photon
are exhibited in the same experimental conditions, conﬁrming the
wave-particle concept and at the same time contradicting the mutual
exclusiveness of Bohr’s complementarity principle.
Finally, it is worth noting that simultaneous wave-particle duality
for neutrons in similar interferometer have also been reported by
Greenberger and Yasin.
• Grangier’s et al. experiments, photon indivisibility
The purpose of this experiment is to test the indivisibility of the

levels of Ca atoms 1S0 →1 P1 and 1P1 →1 S0 (Fig. 5.5.2). The ﬁrst

opens a rectangular gate to control the detection of the second photon
emission at ω2. The last one passes through a beam splitter behind
which photomultipliers can detect the transmitted and the reﬂected
ω2 photons. The intermediate level has a life time τ and in order to
decrease the probability to get coincidence, counting due to two ω2
photons issued from two diﬀerent Ca atoms, the gate width γ has
been chosen to be much smaller than τ.
The ﬁnal results of the experiment revealed extremely low levels
of coincidences, demonstrating without any doubt, that the photons
are integral particles transmitted or reﬂected by the beam splitter as
a whole.
Although the issue of the experiment shows the indivisibility of
the photons, it does not exclude the wave nature of them. It is
important adding here that A. Aspect’s experiments on the enta-
gled photon states, followed by a large number of other experiments
world around, have shown the permanent violation of Bell’s inequal-
ities implying the absence of hidden variables for the point particle
representation of photons. Furthermore, they have demonstrated the
necessity of the development of a non-local representation with a real
wave function in which new variables are not explicitly excluded.
Consequently, we will examine in the next Chapter the possibility
of establishing a quantum equation for the photon with a quantized

vector potential amplitude within a non-local representation with the
vector potential function playing the role of a real wave function.
• Hunter–Wadlinger experiments, the photon spatial expansion
Akhiezer and Berestetskii, among many others, have pointed out
that it is impossible to consider a photon within a length shorter
than the wavelength. In fact, a point-photon should have a zero
wavelength and inﬁnite energy. Nowadays, this concept is generally
accepted. However, the lateral expansion of the photon considered as
an integral particle was always an intriguing part of physics.
For many decades, it has been well known that Faraday’s metallic
cage is a quite eﬃcient shield toward electromagnetic waves, provided
that the dimensions of the holes of the grid are roughly ﬁve times
smaller than the wavelength of the incident radiation, which is ∼λ/5.
That was rather an empirical rule and most of the constructed grills
to screen the radiation of a wavelength λ imposed the dimensions of
the holes to be within the interval λ/4 to λ/8.
Robinson in 1953 and Hadlock in 1958 carried out experiments
using microwaves crossing small apertures, and deduced that no
energy is transmitted through apertures whose diameters are less
than roughly ∼λ/4.
In 1986, Hunter and Wadlinger, realized a very simple experiment
inspired by those carried out by Robinson and Hadlock (Fig. 5.5.3).
They used x-band microwaves with λ = 28.5 mm and measured the
transmitted power through rectangular or circular apertures of dif-
ferent dimensions.
The purpose was to deﬁne the smaller dimensions of the slit
beyond which the transmitted power is zero. All the results, corrected
with the subtraction of the ﬁrst harmonic of the emitted beam
by the microwave antenna, have shown that the cut-oﬀdimension
(diameter for the circular aperture, width for the rectangular one) is
roughly ∼λ/π.
Consequently, taking also into account that the longitudinal
extension of the photon along the propagation axis is the wavelength
λ itself, it implies that the intrinsic “photon volume” depends on its
wavelength and it should be proportional to λ3.

5.6. Conclusion Remarks
We have seen that the equivalence of the photons energy with that of
the classical electromagnetic wave description implies that a relation-
ship between Planck’s constant and the vector potential quantized
amplitude should exist. We have also analyzed the QED singularities
and shown that the zero-point energy term 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk is not involved
in the vacuum-electron interactions.
In fact, the vacuum eﬀects in QED like the spontaneous emis-
sion and the Lamb shift are interpreted based on the commutation
properties of the creation and annihilation operators a+
kλ and akλ
respectively, without invoking at all the term 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk in the cal-
culations. Indeed, 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk is a constant and in the QED repre-
sentation commutes with all Hermitian operators corresponding to
physical observables.
Conversely, the zero-point energy term 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk is used in var-
ious semi-classical descriptions for the interpretation of the Casimir
eﬀect and for the Lamb shift (Welton’s and Feynman’s models) in
which the appropriate cut-oﬀs, introduced in order to get physical
results, are taken from the QED calculations in which. . . the term

k,λ
1
2ℏωk is ignored.

94
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
In other words, the zero-point energy in QED results from
the mean value of the normal ordering and anti-normal ordering
Hamiltonians, leading to a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian and has
no inﬂuence in the quantum calculations for the vacuum eﬀects since
it is a constant but it is used in the semi-classical descriptions for
the interpretation of the vacuum eﬀects.
On the experimental front, we may essentially deduce that the
photoelectric eﬀect, Compton’s scattering and Young’s interferences
have been interpreted by both the wave and particle nature of light.
This has been further established by Mizobuchi and Ohtake’s exper-
iment, which also demonstrates that the wave and particle natures
appear simultaneously and are not necessarily exclusive.
On the other hand, Robinson, Hadlock, Hunter and Wadlinger
have demonstrated that the photon should have a lateral extension
of the order λ/4 to λ/π and cannot be a “point particle,” while the
experiments of Grangier et al. demonstrated the photon indivisibility.
During
the
Compton
scattering
experiments,
the
photon
exhibits a very particular property; it conserves its integrity as
particle, but may concede a fraction of its energy, entailing a modi-
ﬁcation of its wave- length and consequently its energy, momentum
and spatial extension. Bothe’s experiments demonstrated this partic-
ular property of light showing further the conservation of energy and
moment during each event of a x-ray photon scattered by an electron.
To sum up the experimental evidence, it turns out that the
photon appears to be an indivisible quantum (segment) of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld over a period, thus extended along a wavelength,
with intrinsic wave properties, emitted and detected as a whole and
capable of interacting with charged particles, increasing (or even
decreasing) its wavelength and consequently decreasing (or even
increasing) its energy.
In the next chapter, we will consider further theoretical elabo-
rations conform to the experiments and advance a non-local photon
representation based on a precise quantization of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld vector potential, linking coherently the electromagnetic theory
and quantum mechanics and entailing a well-deﬁned description of
the quantum vacuum.

Wave-Particle Representation
and the Quantum Vacuum
6.1. Quantized Vector Potential Amplitude of a Single
Photon State
Frequency and vector potential imply electromagnetic wave properties
while energy and momentum imply particle properties. In a full wave-
particle description of light the challenge consists of establishing a
coherent relation among all these physical quantities.
• Dimension analysis from Maxwell’s equations. Vector potential
amplitude proportional to the frequency.
The relations (4.1.9) attribute a precise value of energy and
momentum to a photon related to the electromagnetic wave only
by the angular frequency, while no information is supplied about the
photon vector potential which is basically indispensable in the clas-
sical electromagnetic description. As we have discussed in Chapter
5 (5.1), in the electromagnetic theory it is impossible to deﬁne the
energy of an electromagnetic wave simply by the frequency while
omitting the vector potential. Hence, if the photon is an integral
99

Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
particle with deﬁnite quantum energy then the exact quantization of
its vector potential amplitude should be a natural consequence.
Obviously, the quantization procedure of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, described brieﬂy in Section (4.3) does not result eﬀectively to
the description of the vector potential of individual photons. Indeed,
examining the link relations (4.3.14), obtained from (4.3.13) when
N = 1, the amplitude of the vector potential for a single k-mode
photon with angular frequency ωk used in quantum electrodynamics
(QED) description is given by
α0k(ωk) =

ℏ
2ε0ωkV
(6.1.1)
Of course, for a large number of photons in a volume V , with very
short wavelengths compared to the characteristic dimensions of V ,
the summation transformation (3.5.44) established in the density of
states theory serves to eliminate directly the external volume parame-
ter V involved in the expression of the square amplitude of the vector
potential. Consequently, one may argue that it is needless to enhance
further the analysis of (6.1.1) to a single photon since it is suﬃcient
for the description of physical systems studied in QED. However,
the extraordinary evolution of the experimental technics, such as the
parametric down conversion, permit the realization of single photon
state experiments opening possibilities for direct measurements of
the photon physical properties like the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
Hence, without going beyond the level of equation (6.1.1) we miss
fundamental information on the photon vector potential amplitude
that might ensure the link with the electromagnetic theory leading
to a comprehensive representation of the wave-particle single photon
state.
In fact, it is intriguing to deduce from (6.1.1) that the vector
potential of a single photon depends on an independent free space
variable V and that, for a given ﬁnite volume, it is inversely propor-
tional to the square root of the angular frequency. This is also puz-
zling from physical point of view because, knowing that the current
density ⃗j(⃗r, t) has units of charge (C) times m−2 s−1, a dimension

in equation (3.3.10) issued from the Maxwell’s equations shows that
it should be proportional to the frequency and consequently for a
k-mode photon with angular frequency ωk we should have
α0k(ωk) ∝ωk →α0k(ωk) = ξωk
(6.1.2)
where ξ is a constant.
This is contradictory with the frequency dependence of the vector
potential amplitude in equation (6.1.1) implying mathematically that
in the case of a single photon the volume V cannot be a free external
parameter but it has to be proportional to ω−3

(6.1.3)
Thus, according to the density of modes analysis in chapter 3 and
the relations (3.5.45) and (4.3.29) the quantization volume of a single
photon state seems to be naturally an intrinsic property.
The possible spatial extension of the photon will be discussed
later. First, we are going to have a close look to the vector potential
function and the associated quantization constant ξ of the amplitude.
• Quantum equation for the photon vector potential.
Based on (6.1.2), the fundamental physical properties characteriz-
ing both the particle (energy and momentum) and the wave (vector
potential, wave vector and dispersion relation) nature of a single
k-mode photon are related linearly to the angular frequency

ℏ= |⃗pk|
ℏ/c = α0k
ξ
=

√ε0µ0
= |⃗k|c = ωk
(6.1.4)
An interesting feature results when considering that the photon
momentum |⃗Pk| has the units of a mass mk times the velocity c
in vacuum so we may write |⃗Pk| = ℏk = mkc. Of course, mk is a
parameter that has simply a dimensional value here as the photon
is generally considered to be a massless particle. Using Ek = ℏωk =
ℏk c one gets directly Ek = mkc2 showing that the energy-mass
equivalence is a direct result of the wave-particle double nature of
light since we have used the wave dispersion relation ωk = |⃗k|c and
the momentum |⃗Pk| = ℏ|⃗k| which is a particle property.

Now, according to (6.1.2) the expression of the k-mode photon
vector potential may be written in a general plane wave expression
with the quantized amplitude

The propagation equation now writes

entailing that the photon vector potential amplitude can be expressed
as an operator ˜α0k proportional to the constant ξ
˜α0k = −iξc⃗∇
(6.1.9)
which is valid for every mode k. Obviously, the established vector
potential amplitude operator is quite symmetrical with the relativis-
tic Hamiltonian operator for a massless particle

(6.1.10)

Combination of the last two equations yields a linear time diﬀer-

Notice that the last equation for the vector potential with quan-
tization constant ξ is analogue to the Schr¨odinger equation for the
energy with quantization constant ℏ.
Of course, the photon vector potential function ⃗αkλ(⃗r, t)also sat-
isﬁes Schr¨odinger’s equation with the relativistic massless particle
Hamiltonian (6.1.10). Hence, we can write the vector potential-energy

Consequently, in a non-local representation the vector potential
function αkλ(⃗r, t), which also satisﬁes the wave propagation equation
(6.1.6), may play the role of a real wave function for the photon that
can be suitably normalized. The square modulus of ωk
√2ε0αkλ(⃗r, t)
gives the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld at the coordinate
⃗r at an instant t.
Furthermore, we also remark that when considering Heisenberg’s
energy-time uncertainty principle
δEkδt ≥ℏ
(6.1.15)
we deduce directly from the relations (6.1.4) a vector potential-time
uncertainty according to the relation
δα0kδt ≥ξ
(6.1.16)
It is worth noting the symmetrical correspondence between the
pairs {Ek(ωk), ℏ} and {α0k(ωk), ξ} for a single photon characterizing
its particle and wave nature respectively.
When considering the propagation of a k-mode photon with a
wavelength λk along the z axis, unlike the momentum operator which
is deﬁned by ⃗Pz = ℏ⃗kz →˜Pz = −iℏ∂
∂z, it is not obvious how to deﬁne

104
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
a position operator and this diﬃculty has been widely commented in
the literature. In fact, Heisenberg’s uncertainty for the position and
momentum for a photon propagating along the z-axis can be written
δz δPz →δz δ
 1


≥1
(6.1.17)
The physical meaning of this relation is that the photon as an
integral entity cannot be localized precisely along z except with a
high degree of uncertainty which is of the order of the wavelength
λκ. This is a natural consequence that lays in the intrinsic wave-
particle nature of the photon as expressed by the condition (4.3.29).
As quoted by many authors, despite the fact that the point-particle
model used in the QED formalism is an eﬃcient mathematical tool,
in reality, the photon cannot be deﬁned within a length shorter than
its wavelength. Consequently, according to the density of states the-
ory (3.5.45), the experimental evidence expressed in (4.3.29) and the
analysis leading to (6.1.3), a single photon state occupies a minimum
“quantization volume”.
Thus, when a k-mode photon is emitted at a coordinate ze at an
instant te and propagates in vacuum along the z-axis the probability
Πk to be localized at time t and at the coordinate z = ze+c(t−te) has
to be considered within a volume of roughly λ3
k (that is the quan-
tization volume) around the point z. Considering that the vector
potential can be a wave function for the photon then Πk is propor-
tional to the square of the angular frequency
Πk = |⃗αkλ(z, t)|2 ∝ξ2ω2
k
(6.1.18)
showing naturally that the higher the angular frequency (the shorter
the wavelength) of the photon the higher the localization possibility
on the propagation axis.
Following the expression (6.1.5), the photon vector potential can
be written in general wave-particle formalism

The vector potential with the quantized amplitude ξ in the wave
expression (6.1.19) translates the individual wave property of the
photon while that of (6.1.20) its particle property, reﬂected through
the vector potential amplitude operator. The representations of the

k-mode photon which writes
|⃗εkλ| =

				 ∝ξω2

(6.1.24)
The last relation lifts the external volume dependence involved
in (5.3.6) and expresses the dependence of the single k-mode pho-
ton electric ﬁeld on the square of the angular frequency. It is worth

106
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
investigating experimentally this result by using modern technics.
For example, the dependence of the photon electric ﬁeld on the angu-
lar frequency may be explored by high resolution laser spectroscopy
on the linear Stark shifts δEStark induced by the electric ﬁeld of a
single photon εkλ(ωk) on the atomic or molecular energy levels. In
fact, linear δEStark is precisely proportional to the electric ﬁeld which
itself depends on the angular frequency, δEStark ∝εkλ(ωk) ∝ωp
k. The
ratio of the measures of the Stark displacements δE1 and δE2 induced
independently by two photons with quite diﬀerent energies, ℏωk1 and
ℏωk2 could permit to deﬁne the power dependence p of the photon
electric ﬁeld on the angular frequency, that is δE1
δE2 ∝(ωk1
ωk2)p. Such
an experiment could also conﬁrm the validity of the relation (5.3.6)
and whether an external arbitrary macroscopic box with dimensions
much bigger than the photon wavelength has any inﬂuence on the
single photon electric ﬁeld.
To resume, the quantization of the vector potential amplitude
α0k = ξωk has permitted the development of a wave-particle for-
malism for the photon expressing its double nature put in evidence
by the experiments. The vector potential amplitude and the elec-
tric/magnetic ﬁeld for a single photon are intrinsic properties. It is
important to keep in mind that the quantum mechanical part of
the above wave-particle formalism is developed on the basis of the
QED frame in which photons are assumed to be point particles. This
hypothesis permits to use a remarkable mathematical formalism in
QED in order to study the interaction of light with matter. However,
many experiments like those described in the previous chapter have
shown that photons are not really point particles and that they are
spatially extended over a wavelength. Apparently, the real nature of
individual photons seems to be more complicated than the simple
point particle representation and we deal with this aspect in the
following.
• Photon quantization volume.
It is useful to recall that, in order to get the link equations (4.3.14)
one has to consider in (4.3.13) the mean value of a monochromatic
plane wave energy density over a period T (or in space representation

Analysis of the Electromagnetic Field Quantization Process
107
over a wavelength), while putting N = 1 for the photon number in the
quantum relation in the right hand side. In other words the operation
consists in QED to take the mean value of the classical electromag-
netic wave energy over a wavelength and attribute it to a single point
particle. Notice also that in classical theory the energy density of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld ⟨Wω⟩T and the energy ﬂux obtained by the
Poynting’s vector ⟨⃗Sω⟩T in (3.4.8) are both calculated over a period
T but they are completely independent on any external volume.
It comes out that both these physical quantities, ⟨Wω⟩T and
⟨⃗Sω⟩T , describing the energy density and ﬂow of a “fraction” of the
electromagnetic wave limited to its wavelength, depend on the angu-
lar frequency ω, on the amplitude of the vector potential α0(ω), and
on the vacuum electric permittivity ε0.
Consequently, following the above analysis and considering the
photon as an integral particle with a given energy we may write
using (3.2.29), (3.4.4) and (3.4.5) for a single k-mode photon

For the last relation to hold at any instant t we deduce that
the photon polarization unit vector ˆελ should have at least two
orthogonal components, ˆe1 and ˆe2, such as ˆελ = σ1ˆe1 + σ2ˆe2 with
|σ1|2 + |σ2|2 = 1 and ˆe1 · ˆe2 = 0.
According to (3.4.12) right (R) and left (L) hand circular polar-
ization unit vectors, ˆεL,R =

to satisfy this condition and equation (6.1.25) becomes

2ε0ω2
kα2
0k(ωk)d3r = ℏωk
(6.1.26)
Indeed, it is generally accepted that the photons are characterized
by Left or Right circular polarization and consequently λ takes only
two values.
The equation (6.1.26) is equivalent to the normalization of
the energy over a wavelength of a classical electromagnetic plane
wave with circular polarization, issued from Maxwell’s equations, to
Planck’s expression of the quantized radiation energy. At that point,
we recall the energy density equivalence between the classical and

108
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
the quantum mechanical formulations given by (4.3.13), which for
N = 1 is simply reduced to
2ε0ω2
kα2
0k(ωk)Vk = ℏωk
(6.1.27)
where α0k(ωk) is the vector potential amplitude that may be
attributed to a k−mode photon and Vk the corresponding quanti-
zation volume.
Comparison of the last two equations implies that Vk should cor-
respond to an intrinsic property of a k-mode photon. From (6.1.2)
and (6.1.27) we get
Vk =

(6.1.28)
where the dependence on the angular frequency is in agreement with
the previous analysis that led to the relations (3.5.45), (4.3.29) and
(6.1.3).
Since it has been demonstrated that a k-mode photon cannot
be considered as an integral entity within a region smaller than its
wavelength λκ (4.3.29) and since the directional character of photons
has been demonstrated experimentally by Compton, the integration
of (6.1.26) may be carried out in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, θ, z),
where z is the propagation axis along which the vector potential
rotates perpendicularly. In a full period interval, 0 ≤z ≤λk, the
angular coordinate θ is related to z by θ = 2πz/λk and the integration
may be reduced to the variables, z and ρ in the limits 0 ≤z ≤λk and
0 ≤ρ ≤ηλk , with η a positive dimensionless constant characterizing
the transverse spatial extension of the photon and permitting the

Recalling that c =

ε0µ0 , the physical meaning of the relations
(6.1.30) and (6.1.32) is that Planck’s constant is related to the vac-
uum electric permittivity ε0 and magnetic permeability µ0 by the
intermediate of the photon’s intrinsic physical parameters namely,
the transverse extension η and the vector potential amplitude quan-
tization constant ξ.
We can now deduce the particle properties of the photon by using
the wave characteristics and the quantization volume.
In fact, the particle properties, energy, momentum and spin of
a k-mode photon are not carried by a point particle and can be
expressed in terms of the quantization volume Vk and the wave prop-
erties namely the dispersion relation, the vector potential and the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
The energy of the photon can be obtained by (6.1.26) using the
quantization volume Vk and the quantized vector potential amplitude

where we have considered the property calculated by Rybakov and
Saha that the mean value of the length in a k-mode photon state is
equivalent to c/ωk.
The fact that the energy, momentum and spin of the photon
can be expressed through Vk supports that the photon is not in
reality a point but has a minimum spatial extension corresponding
to the quantization volume in which the quantized vector potential
oscillates over a period. Consequently instead of “wave-particle” we
should more properly employ the term “wave-corpuscle”. It is worth
noting that according to the relation (6.1.28) for micro-waves and
radio-wave frequencies the spatial extension of a single photon cor-
responds to macroscopic dimensions.
The quantization volume Vk appears to be an intrinsic property
for a single photon and deﬁnes the minimum space in which the
quantized electric and magnetic ﬁelds oscillate at the frequency ωk
over a wavelength along the propagation axis. It may also ensure the
link with the particle representation. In fact, when introducing the
particle operators ˜αp
0k and ˜αp∗
0k expressed in (6.1.23) into the quantum
electrodynamics position and momentum operators relations (4.3.11)
one gets directly the corresponding position ˆQkλ and momentum

showing that the origin of the uncertainty in the quantum mechanics

seen in (6.1.17) .
• Relation between the photon vector potential and the electron

(6.1.39)
where h is Planck’s constant.
Using for η the experimental approximate value of 1/4 discussed
in Chapter 5.5 we obtain immediately Q ∼1.6 10−19 Coulomb,
which is the electron charge, a physical constant appearing naturally
here when considering the equivalence of the classical and quantum
mechanical energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld beyond the
point particle concept.
This signiﬁes that the physical origin of the electron charge is
strongly related to the quantum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld over a
period, the photon. A similar result has been obtained by Williamson
and van der Mark following a semiclassical approach leading to the
expression Q2 =
3
(2π)3 (ε0hc) ≈1.4 10−19C. The better numerical
value obtained with (6.1.39) is due to the experimental estimation
of η.
Based on this result we can go further in the deﬁnitions of both η
and ξ constants by the intermediate of the electron charge expressed

through the ﬁne structure constant αF S as deﬁned in the equation
(4.6.4), by equating to (6.1.39)
η2
4 (ε0hc) = 2αF S(ε0hc)
(6.1.40)
getting
η = √8αF S
(6.1.41)
Consequently, we can have an approximate idea of the numerical
value of the vector potential amplitude quantization constant from
(6.1.38) and the coupling of (6.1.30) to (6.1.41)

where e is the electron change. Appropriate experiments could
attribute more precise values to η and ξ.
Note that according to the numerical value obtained for ξ and
without yet considering any normalization factor the probability Πk
in (6.1.18), expressing the possibility of localizing a photon at the
coordinate z within approximately the quantization volume, tends
naturally to 1 for high values of frequencies, of the order 1024 Hz,
which correspond to photon wavelengths shorter than the electron
radius.
Finally, it is important remarking that when introducing in the
relation (4.6.4) the expression ℏ≈4πceξ issued from (6.1.42) and
taking into account that c2 = 1/ε0µ0 we obtain the interesting result
that the electron charge can be expressed naturally through the ﬁne
structure constant and the vacuum constants ξ and µ0.
e = (4π)2αF S

The physical meaning of the last relation is that the elementary
charges might also be issued from the quantum vacuum like photons

structures of the quantum vacuum that might lead to the elementary
charges arises naturally from the last relation.

• Analysis of the origin of the zero-point energy in the QED
formalism
Let us go back to the two expressions of the Hamiltonians, (5.2.1)
and (5.2.3) which result simply from the commutation of A∗
kλ and
Akλ in equation (4.3.9) and let us deal with the fundamental problem
of the mathematical origin of the zero-point energy term ℏω/2.
As it is well known, a simple commutation between the vector
potential amplitude and its complex value, which has absolutely
no inﬂuence in the classical expression of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
energy (4.3.9), proves to be of crucial importance for the quan-
tum mechanical Hamiltonian. We can now analyse the reason for
which the harmonic oscillator radiation Hamiltonian (4.3.18) cannot
be obtained when the link equations (4.3.14) are introduced in the
expression of the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy (4.3.9).
We recall that for a harmonic oscillator of a particle with mass
m ̸= 0 and momentum ⃗p = md⃗q/dt, the transition from the classical
expression of energy (4.2.20) to the Hamiltonian (4.2.25), i.e.,
EHO = 1

2( ˆP 2 + ω2 ˆQ2) = ℏω

(6.2.1)
where ˆP = i

ℏω
2 (a+ −a) and ˆQ =

ℏ
2ω(a+ + a), is immediate and
needs no commutation operations between the canonical variables of
position and momentum.
Consequently, the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian ˜HHO for a
non-zero mass particle is a direct result expressing a perfect cor-
respondence between the classical canonical variables of momentum
and position, P and Q respectively, and the quantum mechanical
Hermitian operators ˆP and ˆQ.
Conversely, this is not the case for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
because commutations between Qkλ and Pkλ occur during the
transition from the expression (4.3.9) to (4.3.12). Therein, we recall

114
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
that Heisenberg’s commutation relation [ ˆQkλ, ˆPk′λ′] = iℏδkk′δλλ′ is
a fundamental concept of quantum mechanics which should not be
ignored when transiting from classical variables to quantum mechan-
ical operators. This is exactly the reason for which the equation
(4.3.12) cannot be considered as the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy
expression for establishing the quantized radiation Hamiltonian since
it is not equivalent, from the quantum mechanical point of view, to
equation (4.3.9).
In fact, introducing the vector potential amplitude expressions of
(4.3.11) in the equation (4.3.9)

This is the correct mathematical way to get identical results

The last operations clearly show that considering the mean value
of the normal ordering and antinormal ordering Hamiltonians implies
that the Heisenberg commutation relation is eliminated suppressing
by this way an important quantum property involved in both Hamil-
tonians. However, the physical reasons for considering this mean
value of the Hamiltonians in order to get a harmonic oscillator one
are quite elusive since no experiment has ever demonstrated that a
single photon state is a harmonic oscillator.
As it has been analyzed in section (5.4), the zero-point energy of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld Hamiltonian as a constant value is not really
involved directly in the electron-vacuum interactions because it com-
mutes with all Hermitian operators corresponding to physical observ-
ables. Therein, it has been pointed out by many authors that the
mathematical and physical basis for the description of the electron-
vacuum interactions in QED issues from the properties of the pho-
ton creation and annihilation operators,a+
kλ and akλrespectively. On
that point, K.Symanzik was the ﬁrst to argue that the zero-point
energy singularity in the quantized ﬁelds theory is intriguing leading
to unphysical situations.
Indeed, one may wonder whether the contribution of the term

This is not an harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian and it is generally
employed in QED casting aside the quantum vacuum energy singu-
larity. Now, we may naturally wonder that if the Hamiltonian (6.2.7)
represents the physical state of a system of photons then what could

be the quantum vacuum in complete absence of photons? We will
investigate this particular situation in the following.
• Ground level of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the vacuum
According to the relations (6.1.4), for ωk →0 all the physical
properties of the photon vanish. However, even when ωk = 0, that
is in complete absence of energy and vector potential, the ﬁeld Ξkλ
expressed in (6.1.19 to 6.1.22) does not cancel and reduces to the
vacuum ﬁeld Ξ0λ, involving the polarization, which can be described
as a vector ﬁeld as well as a quantum mechanical operator
⃗Ξ0λ = ξˆελeiϕ + ξ∗ˆε∗
λe−iϕ
(6.2.8)
˜Ξ0λ = ξakλˆελeiϕ + ξ∗a+
kλˆε∗
λe−iϕ
(6.2.9)
whereas the presence of the creation operator means that the vac-
uum ﬁeld ˜Ξ0λis a dynamic entity capable of inducing electronic
transitions.
Equations (6.2.8) and (6.2.9) represent the ground state of the
radiation ﬁeld (ωk = 0, ∀k), in complete absence of energy and vector
potential and can thus be assimilated to the vacuum state. Obvi-
ously, the ﬁeld Ξ0λ is a real entity having the units Volt m−1s2
implying an electric potential nature of the quantum vacuum as
in the case of the classical electromagnetic description. In fact, as
we have seen in (3.2.13) and (3.2.15), since the very beginning of
the electromagnetic theory the vacuum has been characterized by an
impedance, Rvacuum =

µ0
ε0 ≈120π Ω, a magnetic permeability µ0 =
4π × 10−7Hm−1 and an electric permittivity ε0 = 8.85× 10−12Fm−1.
These physical quantities play an important role in Maxwell’s equa-
tion independently on the system of units used because they deﬁne
the celerity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuum, c =

1/ε0µ0.
The vacuum ﬁeld Ξ0λ is the generating function for photons. Con-
sequently, the energy and by the same token the mass appear to be
the direct result of the real vacuum ﬁeld vibrations.
Furthermore, following the relation (6.1.43) the electric potential
character of the vacuum expressed through the constant ξ entails that

118
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
every charge moving in space with an acceleration ⃗γ will experience
an electric potential Uvacuum due precisely to the ﬁeld Ξ0λ
Uvacuum = ξ |⃗γ|
(6.2.10)
This could play an important role in the cosmic vacuum energy
and consequently contributes to the cosmological constant as we will
discuss later.
Finally, introducing (6.1.28) in (5.3.5) we obtain the expectation
value of the electric ﬁeld in vacuum which tends to zero in the absence
of photons
⟨E(⃗r)2⟩vacuum =

k,λ
(ξω2
k)2 →0
for ωk(∀k) →0
(6.2.11)
Hence, in this description the QED singularities, related to the
inﬁnite vacuum energy and inﬁnite expectation value of the photons
electric ﬁeld in the vacuum state are lifted.
6.3. The Vacuum Field Eﬀects
We can examine now in which manner the eﬀects due to the quan-
tum vacuum, described brieﬂy in Section 4 and whose diﬃculties are
encountered in Section 5, can be described through the formalism
developed in the previous chapter.
• Spontaneous emission
For the description of the electron-vacuum interaction and in
order to overcome the diﬃculty arising from the (5.4.4), a “vacuum
action” operator corresponding to an interaction Hamiltonian per
angular frequency between the vacuum ﬁeld ˜Ξ0λ and an electron of
mass me and charge e can now be deﬁned like the third term of the
Hamiltonian (4.4.3)
Hωk = −iℏe
me
˜Ξ0λ · ⃗∇
(6.3.1)
Thus, the amplitude of the transition probability per angular fre-
quency between an initial state |Ψi, 0⟩with total energy Ei = ℏωi,
corresponding to an atom in the state |Ψi⟩with energy Ei in vacuum
| . . . , 0kλ, . . . , 0k′λ′, . . .⟩, and a ﬁnal state |Ψf, nkλ⟩with total energy

119
Ef,nkλ = ℏωf + nkλℏωk representing the atom in the state |Ψf⟩with
energy Ef = ℏωf in the presence of nkλ photons, can be expressed
in ﬁrst order time dependent perturbation theory using (4.5.5)

kλ · ⃗∇a+
kλ|Ψi, 0⟩ei(ωi−ωf −nkλωk)t′]dt′
(6.3.2)
Since akλ|Ψi, 0⟩= 0, using the fundamental deﬁnition of the momen-
tum operator (4.1.12) as well as Heisenberg’s equation of motion
(4.5.22b) the scalar product of the equation (6.3.2) corresponding to
the creation operator a+
kλ writes
⟨Ψf, nkλ|ξ∗⃗ε ∗
kλ · ⃗∇a+
kλ|Ψi, 0⟩= −ξ∗δ1,nkλmeωif⃗ε ∗
kλ · ⃗rif/ℏ
(6.3.3)
with ⃗rif = ⟨Ψf|⃗r|Ψi⟩, ωif = ωi −ωf and considering the expression
of ξ =

4πecfrom (6.1.43) one gets with an equivalent calculation as
in (4.5.24) the spontaneous emission rate in the elementary solid
angle dΩ

(6.3.4)
The calculation shows that the spontaneous emission is mainly
due to the creation operator a+
kλ, which here is involved in the quan-
tum vacuum expression ˜Ξ0λ permitting to establish an interaction
Hamiltonian.
• Lamb shift
In section 4.6 we have calculated the energy level shift due to the
vacuum interaction by employing Bethe’s famous calculation consist-
ing of neglecting inﬁnite quantities and imposing arbitrary integra-
tion limits. Whatever the strongly negative comments of Dirac and
those of many authors in the literature Bethe’s calculations have
the merit to be the ﬁrst demonstrating the inﬂuence of the creation
operator onto the atomic energy levels obtaining precise results. It is
worth mentioning that when introducing the vector potential opera-
tor (6.1.23) in the interaction Hamitonian inducing the energy shift

120
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
(4.6.3) in Bethe’s calculation and considering the same assumptions
we get identical result showing that the energy shift is indeed due to
the interaction with the vacuum.
However, we can now have a diﬀerent look to the Lamb shift
by applying a method for the description of the interaction of the
vacuum state with the atomic energy levels based on the vacuum
radiation pressure.
Within a ﬁrst approximation, the energy shifts of the electron
bounded states can be seen as a topological eﬀect of the vacuum
radiation pressure upon the electronic orbitals. In fact, the motion of
a bounded state electron with charge e, whose energy is Enlj, in the
vacuum ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ can be characterised by Bohr’s angular frequency
ωnlj = Enlj
ℏ
= R∞
n2ℏ
(6.3.5)
where n, l, j are the quantum numbers of the corresponding orbital
entailing the rise in the electron frame of a vector potential amplitude
α0(nlj) = ξω(nlj)
(6.3.6)
corresponding to “vacuum photons” with energy
4πecξωnlj = ℏωnlj
(6.3.7)
Hence, despite the fact that the vacuum state has no photons in
the normal ordering Hamiltonian representation, an electron experi-
ences in its frame photons due to its periodic motion in the vacuum
ﬁeld. The radiation pressure per unit surface on the atomic orbitals
writes
dPvacuum =

λ
ε0
			E(R,L)

2
dΩ
(6.3.8)
where |E(R,L)
0
| is the electric ﬁeld amplitude of the left and right
hand polarized photons seen by the electron in its frame due to the
vacuum.
Using (3.4.13) and (3.4.14) to express the circular polarization
components we obtain for the square amplitude of the electric ﬁeld
|E(R)
0
|2 = ω2
nlj(|A(R)

= ω2
nlj(2ξ2ω2

(6.3.9)

Analysis of the Electromagnetic Field Quantization Process
121
Consequently, using (6.3.9) and (6.1.43) the summation of (6.3.8)
over the two circular polarizations, R and L, and over the whole solid
angle gives the total vacuum radiation pressure
Pvacuum = 4πε0(4ξ2ω4
nlj) ≈
ℏω4
nlj
4αF Sπ2c3
(6.3.10)
Hence, if the electron subsists in the eﬀective volume Vnlj(eﬀ) of
the nlj orbital the corresponding energy shift due to vacuum radiation
pressure writes
δE = PvacuumVnlj(eﬀ) ≈
ℏω4
nlj
4αF Sπ2c3 Vnlj(eﬀ)
(6.3.11)
A delicate operation consists of deﬁning V(nlj)(eﬀ). The nS elec-
tronic orbitals for example are characterised by a probability den-
sity distribution decreasing smoothly with an exponential expression.
Furthermore, for the excited electronic nS states the radial wave
functions contain negative values and the electron probability den-
sity distribution involves a signiﬁcant space area with zero values.
Hence, in the case of atomic hydrogen for the spherically symmetri-
cal electronic orbitals nS, in order not to take into account the space
regions where the probability density is zero, the eﬀective volume
may be written in a ﬁrst approximation
V(nS)(eﬀ) ≈1

(6.3.15)
Signiﬁcant Lamb shifts have been observed for the nS orbitals
(n being the principal quantum number) having a spherical prob-
ability density distribution and zero orbital momentum l = 0. We
obtain the Lamb shifts frequencies for the hydrogen nS levels
1S: ∼7.96 GHz(8.2),
2S: ∼1000 MHz (1040),
3S: ∼296 MHz (303),
4S: ∼124 MHz
where the experimental values are given in parenthesis.
Consequently, the energy shifts of the nS levels of the hydrogen
atom interacting with the vacuum can be estimated with a rather
good approximation for such a simple calculation by considering the
radiation pressure of the vacuum “seen” in the frame of the electrons
due to their periodic motion in the vacuum ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ.
By the same token the Casimir eﬀect may be interpreted as the
radiation pressure diﬀerence between the inner and outer space of
the conducting plates due to photons “seen” by the electrons, atoms
and molecules of the inner and outer surfaces of the plates due to
the ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ.
• Vacuum energy density and the cosmological constant
In Chapter 5.3 we have pointed out that recent astronomical
observations revealed the vacuum energy density in the universe to
be roughly 10−9 J/m3, about 120 orders of magnitude lower than the
value predicted by the QED theory which is 10110 J/m3 when consid-
ering cut-oﬀs for the integration of equation (5.3.3) at about 1043 Hz
rad corresponding to Planck’s energy ∼1019 GeV. Not surprisingly,
some authors have characterized this result as the “worst theoretical
prediction in the history of physics”. This huge discrepancy between
the theoretical and the observed values of the vacuum energy den-
sity has been called “vacuum catastrophe”, in analogy with the “UV
catastrophe” which a century ago revealed the necessity for the devel-
opment of a new theory, Quantum Mechanics. We recall again that

Analysis of the Electromagnetic Field Quantization Process

the vacuum catastrophe” is a direct result of the zero-point energy

k,λ

2ℏωk of the ﬁelds which results when considering the mean
value of the normal ordering and antinormal ordering Hamiltonians
in the quantization process.
Recent studies on the dark energy and the arising constraints
have stimulated the creation of new models in order to remedy the
theoretical diﬃculties in cosmology. Carroll et al. have shown that
the modelling of the dark energy as a ﬂuid has led to the classi-
cal phantom description which revealed to be instable from both
quantum mechanical and gravitational point of view. Some propos-
als based on phantom cosmology have introduced more consistent
dark energy models such as Fanaoni’s quantum eﬀects in general
relativity, Nojiri’s non-linear gravity-matter interaction, Abdalla’s
revised gravity and Elizalde’s eﬀective phantom phase and hologra-
phy among many others.
On the other hand, various studies on the contribution of the
quantum vacuum state to the dark energy have been carried out
based on both quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and QED descrip-
tions like those of Frieman, Silvestri, and more recently Labun’s
works. However, it has been pointed out by many authors that our
understanding of the extremely complex QCD vacuum state is very
blurred. Conversely, QED theory oﬀers a quite comprehensive frame-
work and it is worthy to analyse here the eventual contribution of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld ground state (zero energy, zero vector potential)
to the cosmic vacuum energy density.
According to the relation (6.1.28), for photons with very low angu-
lar frequencies the corresponding spatial extension gets extremely big.
For ωk →0 the volume of a k-mode photon tends to cosmic dimen-
sions while the energy, the vector potential and the momentum tend
to extremely low values. For a ﬁnite, universe behaving as a cosmic
cavity, ωk in (6.1.28) gets inﬁnitely small but not zero. Hence, we may
assume the universe to be ﬁlled by electromagnetic waves with cosmic
dimensions and extremely low energy. Under these conditions a quite
large number of cosmic photons issued from the ﬂuctuations of the
background vacuum ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ could contribute to the vacuum energy
density. Furthermore, in particular situations the various distributions

124
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
of mass and charges in the universe may also induce ﬂuctuations of
Ξ0λ giving rise to higher frequency photons that might be in the range
of long wavelength radio waves up to microwaves contributing to the
microwaves irregularities observed in space.
Another possible contribution to the cosmic vacuum energy den-
sity could come from the interaction of particles with the vacuum
ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ. In fact, as we have seen in Chapter 6 for ωk →0 (∀k)the
ﬁeld ⃗Ξkλ(ωk,⃗r, t) does not vanish and reduces to the electromagnetic
ground ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ ﬁlling the whole space and having electric poten-
tial units Volt m−1 s2. Consequently, any charge q submitted to an
acceleration ⃗γ in the ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ experiences an electric potential pro-
portional to the acceleration, given in (6.2.10). Thus, the amplitude
of the interaction energy in this case is
Evacuum = |qξ⃗γ|
(6.3.16)
As a result, a part of this interaction energy with the vacuum is
radiated in space by Bremsstrahlung eﬀect. The energy density due
to the interaction of N accelerated charges in a volume V with the
vacuum ﬁeld ⃗Ξ0λ writes
Wvacuum = 1
V
N

i
|qiξ⃗γi|
(6.3.17)
In the case of solar conditions e.g., in which the charge density
is roughly ∼1030q/m3 (q ∼10−19C), considering that the mean
acceleration of the charges vary from 104 m/s2 up to relativistic
values 107 m/s2 we obtain from (6.3.17) energy densities in the
range Wvacuum ∝10−10 −10−7 J/m3 which compare well with the
astrophysical observations. Obviously, the total energy density issued
from the vacuum interactions in all the cosmic bodies withinin the
galaxies, in the intergalactic gaz and dusts as well as in the inter-
stellar medium should participate to the cosmic background energy
density. Consequently, the interaction energy of charged particles
in the universe with the electromagnetic ﬁeld ground state ⃗Ξ0λ,
as well as the low frequency electromagnetic waves that may be
issued from the ﬂuctuations of the last ﬁeld may have a signiﬁcant

contribution to the cosmological constant and is worthy to be inves-
tigated experimentally.
6.4. Conclusion Remarks
In this chapter we have advanced theoretical elaborations in order to
ensure a coherent link between the electromagnetic wave theory and
quantum electrodynamics with the purpose to establish a non-local
wave-particle description of the photon with a real wave function as
required by the experiments. We have started from the fact that the
vector potential amplitude of a single photon state is not physically
deﬁned in (6.1.1) since it depends on an arbitrary external volume
parameter V . Hence, the essential concept of the elaborations is based
on the fact that the k-mode electromagnetic ﬁeld vector potential
amplitude α0k is proportional to the angular frequency ωk. This is
not a hyphothesis but a direct result of the dimension analysis of
the vector potential issued from the resolution of Maxwell’s equa-
tions. Consequently, since the energy of a k-mode photon considered
as an integral and indivisible entity corresponds to a deﬁnite value
ℏωk, then the vector potential amplitude has to be quantized at a
single photon level α0k = ξωk, where ξ is the quantization constant.
The value of ξ has been evaluated in a ﬁrst approximation to be
|ξ| ≈1.747 10−25 Volt m−1s2.
This operation complements the wave-particle relations of the
photon by introducing the vector potential amplitude in the equa-
tions (6.1.4) and leads to a linear time-dependent equation (6.1.13)
for the vector potential amplitude operator ˜α0 = −iξc⃗∇with the
eigenvalue ξωk, which is analogue to the Schr¨odinger’s equation for
the energy with the relativistic Hamiltonian for a massless particle
˜H = −iℏc⃗∇and the eigenvalue ℏωk. The coupling of (6.1.13) with
the Schr¨odinger’s equation yields the vector potential–energy (wave-
particle) equation for the photon expressed in (6.1.14). In addition
to the wave propagation equation (6.1.6), the vector potential func-
tion ⃗αkλ(⃗r, t) (6.1.5) with the quantized amplitude ξωκ satisﬁes the
coupled equation (6.1.14) and consequently behaves as a real wave
function for the photon that can be suitably normalized.

126
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
On the other hand attempting to understand the real physical
nature of single photons, the equivalence between the classical and
the quantum mechanical energy density (4.3.13) results inevitably
to a spatial extension for a k-mode photon according to the relation
Vk ∝ω−3
k
∝λ3
k. The particle properties of a single photon, energy,
momentum and spin can be expressed through the quantization vol-
ume Vk which is revealed to be proportional to the cubic power of the
wavelength Vk = ℏ/2ε0ξ2ω3
k. This entails that the photon cannot be a
“point” but is rather a “wave-corpuscle” with a minimum quantized
volume extended over a period of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Hence,
the probability of detecting a photon has to be considered within a
volume λ3
k around a given coordinate ⃗r along the propagation axis
and is proportional to the square modulus of the vector potential
amplitude which is proportional to ξ2ω2
k. It comes out that the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds of individual photons are intrinsic physical
properties and they are directly proportional to ξω2
k.
Next we have analyzed the origin of the vacuum energy singularity
in QED which is responsible for the quantum vacuum catastrophe.
As quoted previously by many authors the electromagnetic ﬁeld zero-
point energy results from the mathematical ambiguity regarding the
commutation relation of canonical variables of position and momen-
tum and that of the corresponding quantum mechanics operators.
Disregarding this ambiguity the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian
can only be obtained by considering the mean value of the nor-
mal ordering and antinormal ordering Hamiltonians which automati-
cally casts aside the fundamental Heisenberg’s commutation relation
[ ˆQkλ, ˆPk′λ′] = iℏδkk′δλλ′.
In the experimental frame no experiments have demonstrated that
individual photons are harmonic oscillators. In the theoretical frame,
the normal ordering Hamiltonian, which is not a harmonic oscilla-
tor one, is mainly used in QED. Photons appear to have a more
complicated structure and are neither point particles nor harmonic
oscillators.
Within the normal ordering Hamiltonian description, the vacuum
state appears from the electromagnetic ﬁeld ground state Ξ0λ which
can be expressed as a vector function ⃗Ξ0λ = ξˆελeiϕ+ξ∗ˆε∗
λe−iϕ as well

Analysis of the Electromagnetic Field Quantization Process
127
as a quantum operator ˜Ξ0λ = ξakλˆελeiϕ + ξ∗a+
kλˆε∗
λe−iϕ involving the
photon creation and annihilation operators. It is worth noting that
the circular polarization is present in both expressions of the vacuum
ﬁeld entailing a direct inﬂuence on the entangled photon states.
Thus, photons appear to be “wave-corpuscles” issued from the
oscillation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld ground state Ξ0λ. The wave
properties result from the oscillation over a period of the quantized
vector potential with circular polarization within a minimum quan-
tization volume Vk extended along a wavelength and repeated suc-
cessively along the propagation axis. In this description the vector
potential with the quantized amplitude ⃗αkλ(⃗r, t) behaves as the pho-
ton wave function that can be complemented to take into account
the lateral extension of the vector potential and then suitably nor-
malized.
We
have
shown
that
Heisenberg’s
commutation
relations
[ ˆQkλ, ˆPk′λ′] = iℏδkk′δλλ′ as well as the exact electron charge e =
(4π)2αF S ξ/µ0, a physical constant, result naturally from the non-
local expression of the photon energy.
Finally, the quantum vacuum ﬁeld eﬀects such as the spontaneous
emission, Lamb’s shift and the cosmological vacuum energy density
have been discussed showing the consistency of the elaborations.

Chapter 7
Epilogue
The mathematical expressions of a valid theory should correctly
describe the physical mechanisms involved in a complete ensemble
of experimentally observed phenomena. When many theories, each
based on diﬀerent concepts, interpret only partially some measurable
observables then it becomes obvious that they cannot be epistemo-
logically valid entailing that they have to be improved, if possible, or
abandoned. Hence, the historical evolution over twenty ﬁve centuries
of the concepts on light’s nature followed the sequence Corpuscles,
Ray Optics (without having any idea on the nature of the rays), Wave
Optics (with no idea about the nature of the waves), Electromagnetic
Waves Theory and ﬁnally Quantum Point Particle Theory. Despite
of all these evolutions, the general picture of the nature of light is
not satisfactory and Bohr’s Complementarity Principle was, and still
remains, the artiﬁcial mask beyond which is hidden the diﬃculty of
our comprehension of the simultaneous wave-particle concept. How-
ever, the mutual exclusiveness of Bohr’s Complementarity Principle,
according to which light has both wave and particle natures but
only one of those is expressed explicitly in a given physical situa-
tion, is strongly put in doubt by recent experiments. Following the
elaborations presented in the last Chapter, the next sequence on the
comprehension of the nature of light conform with the experimental
evidence might be: “wave-corpuscle”.
In this book we have tried to resume selected chapters of both
classical electromagnetism and quantum electrodynamics in order
to help the reader forming an opinion on how the nature of light
is represented through each theory. It is of outstanding importance
131

132
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
to note that in both representations, light and vacuum are strongly
related entities.
Classical
electrodynamics
issued
from
Maxwell’s
equations
revealed the necessity of introducing the notion of volume for an
electromagnetic wave to stand entailing precise values of cut-oﬀwave-
lengths for each mode in order to account with the shape and dimen-
sions of the surrounding space. Conversely, QED theory considers
light to be composed of point particles, disregarding the conceptual
question on how the frequency of oscillating electric and magnetic
ﬁelds may be attributed to a point particle. The concept of the pho-
ton being a massles point particle with energy and momentum cannot
be epistemologically valid and conﬂicts with experimental evidence.
The energy and momentum of an electromagnetic wave are carried
by the electric and magnetic ﬁelds oscillating over a period which
for a given mode need a minimum volume to ocupy and cannot
be conceived as a point. The theoretical basis for establishing the
QED mathematical expressions for a point particle is the classical
and the quantum mechanical energy density equivalence (4.3.13) in
which the mean value of the energy of an electromagnetic plane wave
over a wavelength is attributed to a point particle. This operation has
permitted the development of a powerfull and eﬃcient mathematical
formalism in QED for the study of the interactions of light with mat-
ter but revealed unable of providing a physical and comprehensive
picture of the photon compatible with the experiments. Obviously,
the incapacity of QED to advance a physical description of a single
photon state lays in the point particle concept. Furthermore, the vec-
tor potential for a single photon as well as the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are not precisely deﬁned in QED. Based on Maxwell’s equations
we have thus developed the quantized vector potential description
for a single photon that led to the vector potential — energy (wave-
particle) equation (6.1.14). The photon electric and magnetic ﬁelds
are revealed to be proportional to the square of the angular frequency
(6.1.24).
On the experimental front we have seen that the photoelectric
eﬀect, traditionally presented as strong demonstration of the par-
ticle nature of light, is pretty well interpreted in a semi-classical

133
formalism by applying classical electromagnetism using the wave
concept. A similar approach using Dirac’s equation for the electron
and plane wave classical formalism for the incident light has been
applied successfully for the interpretation of Compton’s scaterring
which was equally considerd as a demonstration of the particle nature
of light. On the other hand, Young’s diﬀraction experiments, initially
supporting the wave theory, were quite well interpreted using particle
formalism.
We also presented some particular single-photon experiments
requiring for their interpretation the notion of the simultaneous
wave-particle nature of light and which can be hardly interpreted
either by classical electromagnetism alone or the QED theory.
Using a remarkable experimental setup Grangier et al. demonstrated
the indivisibility of photons. Various experiments carried out by
Robinson, Hadlock, Hunter and Wadlinger conﬁrmed the spatial
extension of the photons over a wavelength while Mandel’s exper-
iments and theoretical developments showed that a photon cannot
be detected in a volume smaller than the cube of its wavelength.
All these strongly suggest that the natural way out of the wave-
particle dilemma and the QED shortcomings is to go beyond the stan-
dard model and consider that a k-mode photon is not a point particle
but rather a quantum, “segment”, of the electromagnetic ﬁeld within
a minimum volume Vk, corresponding to a three dimensional expan-
sion over a wavelength, composed of a quantized vector potential
with deﬁnite amplitude proportional to the angular frequency, rotat-
ing (with R or L circular polarization) over a period and giving rise
to local oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Hence, for a physical
and comprehensive picture it should be more appropriate to consider
the photon as an indivisible “wave-corspuscle” composing the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld and propagating along the vector potential wave
function. By this way, the QED formalism should evolve towards a
3-dimensional representation i.e., creation and annihilation operators
of individual 3-dimensional photons a+
Vkλ and aVkλ respectively.
In Chapter 5 we have analyzed the QED main theoretical diﬃ-
culties and singularities related to the zero-point energy, that is the
electromagnetic quantum vacuum.

134
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
The zero-point energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld as deduced
in the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian (4.3.18) issues from the
mathematical ambiguity related to the drop of the permutation
of the canonical variables of position and momentum during the
quantization procedure casting aside Heisenberg’s commutation
relations which are of crucial importance because the ﬁnal result is
transformed into the quantum mechanics operator formalism. In fact,
the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic ﬁeld can
only be obtained by considering the mean value of the normal order-
ing and antinormal ordering Hamiltonians, although the necessity
of this operation is not supported by any experimental evidence.
Furthermore, it yields an inﬁnite energy quantum vacuum, an unob-
served experimentally singularity which leads to serious cosmological
problems, among which the very challenging quantum vacuum catas-
trophe related to the vacuum energy density. In fact, the contribution
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld vacuum energy to the cosmological con-
stant in QED is in contradiction with the astronomical observations
by rougly 120 orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the vacuum
eﬀects like the spontaneous emission and the Lamb shift are inter-
preted in QED based on the commutation properties of the creation
and annihilation operators, a+
kλ and akλ respectively, without invok-
ing the zero-point energy term 
k,λ
1
2ℏωk in the calculations. In fact,

k,λ
1
2ℏωk is a constant and in the QED formalism commutes with all
Hermitian operators corresponding to physical observables. Finally,
we have seen that the Casimir eﬀect has been quite well interpreted
by many authors using aspects of electrodynamics and without invok-
ing at all the vacuum photons. All these deﬁnetly indicate that the
zero-point energy of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld does not correspond to a real physical state.
We have then analysed what could be the vacuum state when
considering naturally the normal ordering Hamiltonian, which is in
reality the only one used in QED. In the extension of the calcula-
tions developed in Chapter 6, the vacuum appears naturally to have
an electric potential nature, composed of a universal electromagnetic
ﬁeld ground state Ξ0λ with amplitude ξ which is also the essence
of the photon vector potential. Under these conditions, the photon

Epilogue
135
can be seen as a quantum vacuum vibration. Consequently, the vac-
uum is not a sea of photons with all frequencies and polarizations,
which leads to the well-known QED singularity of inﬁnite vacuum
energy, but the electromagnetic waves (photons) are oscillations of
the quantum vacuum sea which is composed of a real electric poten-
tial ﬁeld Ξ0λ.
The calculations show that the ﬁeld Ξ0λ is a real entity, capable
of interacting with the matter since it is expressed as a function of
photon creation and annihilation operators a+
kλ and akλ respectively.
An interaction Hamiltonian between the vacuum and the electrons
can be deﬁned in this way in order to describe the spontaneous emis-
sion eﬀect. Ξ0λ can also be used in Bethe’s calculation for the Lamb
shift getting identical results. In a diﬀerent way, the atomic level
energy shifts as well as the Casimir eﬀect can also be interpreted as
a result of the vacuum radiation pressure “seen” by the electrons in
their frame due to their periodic motion in the vacuum ﬁeld.
Analysis of the equation (6.1.13) with the wave function (6.1.5)
indicates physically that a vibration of the vacuum ﬁeld at an angu-
lar frequency ωκ gives rise to a k-mode photon with vector potential
amplitude ξωk oscillating over a wavelength and yielding the quan-
tum energy ℏωk according to (6.1.26/27). Point photons (and parti-
cles) do not exist and the mass-energy equivalence appears to be a
direct result of the “wave-corpuscle” nature of the physical entities
(photons and particles).
As shown in (6.1.39) the electron charge, a physical constant,
appears naturally when considering the equivalence between the
energy of an electromagnetic ﬁeld restricted to the wavelength and
the quantum expression ℏω. It yields that the electron charge may be
expressed through the vacuum parameters only e = (4π)2αF Sξ/µ0.
The electron, and perhaps all the elementary particles, might also
be issued from the quantum vacuum ﬁeld vibrations. Thus, energy,
mass and charge may originate from the vacuum ﬁeld.
This representation coherently links the Electromagnetic theory
to QED opening possibilities for further developments beyond the
standard theories. Also, it attributes well deﬁned physical prop-
erties to single photons and to the vacuum state and shows the

136
Light and Vacuum (Second Edition)
complementarity of the wave-corpuscle nature of light as required
by the experimental evidence. The natural space interval for a pho-
ton is the wavelength. Despite the fact that the point particle rep-
resentation of the photon in QED is a practical model permitting
the association of a quite eﬃcient mathematical formalism, the real
nature of a single photon occupying a characteristic minimum quan-
tization volume of wavelength dimensions is quite diﬀerent and needs
to be further explored experimentally. These concepts open perspec-
tives for new experiments which are indispensable in order to ﬁxe
the value of ξ, investigate the spatial expansion of the single photon
state and ﬁnally the dependence of the photon electric ﬁeld on its
angular frequency ξω2
k. The theoretical formalism in QED has also to
evolve consequently in order to reﬂect a more realistic representation
of the 3-dimensional photon nature.
Finally, with an objective point of view we can frankly confess
that at the present state of knowledge our comprehension of the
photon is still unsatisfactory and the purpose of this manuscript is
to raise questions and give hints of answers in order to stimulate
further theoretical and experimental investigations.
