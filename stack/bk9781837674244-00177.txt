Karplus Equation
The Karplus equation is an empirical expression for the variation with
torsional angle f of the spin–spin coupling constant 3J between protons
in a fragment HCCH. It comes in a variety of forms, two of which are
3J ¼ A þ B cos f þ C cos 2f
3J ¼ A0 þ B0cos f þ C0cos2f
The parameters in these two expressions are related (by using the
relation cos2f ¼ 1
2 (cos 2f þ 1)) as follows:
A ¼ A0 þ 1
2 C0;
B ¼ B0;
C ¼ 1

Kelvin Scale
On the Kelvin scale of temperature, the lowest point, ‘absolute zero’,
lies at T ¼ 0 and higher temperatures are expressed as multiples of
1 kelvin (1 K). The scale was originally defined in terms of the triple
point of water, taken to lie at 273.16 K exactly, but it is now defined
in terms of fundamental constants. The conversions between the
Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales are
y=3C ¼ T=K  273:15;
y=3F ¼ 9
5 T=K  459:67
The numbers are exact. The degree Celsius has the same size as 1 K.
Kelvin Equation
The Kelvin equation expresses the vapour pressure of a liquid that is
dispersed as droplets of radius r:
p ¼ p ew;
w ¼ 2gVm
rRT
where p* is the vapour pressure of the bulk liquid of molar volume Vm
and g is the surface tension of the liquid. For the vapour pressure
inside a spherical cavity, change the sign of w.
Kinetic Chain Length
The kinetic chain length, v, of a polymerization chain reaction is defined as
v ¼ number of monomer units consumed
number of active centres produced
¼ propagation rate
initiation rate
It is therefore a measure of the eﬃciency of the chain propagation
mechanism: the faster the propagation of a chain, the greater is the
kinetic chain length.

Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy, Ek and sometimes (in mechanics, when there is no
chance of confusing it with temperature) T, is the energy due to the
motion of a body. For a body of mass m travelling at a nonrelativistic
speed v,
Ek ¼ 1
2 mv2 ¼ p2
2m
where p ¼ mv is the magnitude of the linear momentum of the body.
In quantum mechanics, the operators in the position representation
for kinetic energy in one and three dimensions are
bEk ¼  ˉh2
2m
d2
dx2 ;
bEk ¼  ˉh2
2m r2
It follows that the greater the local curvature of a wavefunction, then
the greater is the contribution to the expectation value of the kinetic
energy to the total energy. The kinetic energy of a body with moment
of inertia I rotating with an angular velocity o is
Ek ¼ 1
2 Io2 ¼ J2
2I
where J is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the body.
Kinetic Isotope Eﬀect
The primary kinetic isotope eﬀect is the reduction of the rate of a re-
action by the replacement of an atom by a heavier isotope. The eﬀect

is most pronounced when hydrogen (strictly, protium, 1H) is replaced
by deuterium (2H). It can be traced to the lowering of the zero-point
energy of the X–H bond that is undergoing cleavage in the rate-
determining step (Figure K.2). This lowering increases the activation
energy of the reaction and hence reduces the rate of the reaction. The
secondary kinetic isotope eﬀect is the eﬀect on rate caused by isotopic
substitution elsewhere in the molecule.
Kinetic Salt Eﬀect
The kinetic salt eﬀect is the modification of the rate of reaction be-
tween ions in solution caused by a change in the ionic strength, I, of
the solution. If the charges of the ions have the same sign, then the
rate is increased when the ionic strength is increased; if they have
opposite sign, then the rate is reduced.
The eﬀect is ascribed to the modification of the ionic atmosphere
when ions come together to form the activated complex. Ions of the
same charge increase the charge density, strengthen the ionic at-
mosphere, lower the energy of the activated complex, so reduce the
activation energy of the reaction, and thereby increase its rate. The
opposite is true when ions of opposite charge come together and form
an activated complex of lower total charge. The limiting (as I - 0) rate
constant can be expected to follow the relation
log kr ¼ log kr
 þ 2AzAzBI1=2
where zA and zB are the (signed) charge numbers of the ions and A
is the parameter that occurs in the Debye–Hückel limiting law
(Figure K.3).

Kinetic Model of Gases
The kinetic model of gases (KMT, or kinetic theory of gases) treats a gas
as a collection of point molecules in ceaseless random motion and
which have no interactions except when they undergo elastic col-
lisions. An elastic collision is a collision in which the translational
energy is unchanged.
The pressure, p, of the gas is derived by assessing the force the
molecules exert on the walls of the container of volume V containing
N molecules as they change direction on impact:
pV ¼ 1
3 Nmv2
rms ¼ 1
3 nMv2
rms
where vrms is the root-mean-square speed of the molecules and n is
the amount of molecules of molar mass M. This expression and the
Maxwell distribution of speeds can be used to infer the following
features of the speeds of the molecules:
vrms ¼
3RT
M

1=2
;
vmean ¼
8RT
pM

1=2
;
vrel ¼ 21=2vmean
where vmean is their mean speed and vrel is their relative mean speed.
Two further parameters are used to characterize the spatial and
time scales of events in the gas. Both require the addition to the
model of the notion of a collision cross-section, s, an area around a
molecule which, if the centre of a second molecule enters as it moves
through space, is counted as a ‘collision’. If the diameter of the
molecules are both taken to be d, then s ¼ pd2 (Figure K.4). The mean
free path, l, is the average distance that a molecule travels before it
collides with another molecule. The collision frequency, z, is the
average number of collisions a molecule makes in a given time

interval divided by the duration of the interval (colloquially, the ‘number
of collisions per unit time’).
l ¼ kT
sp ;
z ¼ svrelp
kT
In a container of constant volume, l is independent of temperature
(because then p p T). Typical collision frequencies in air at sea level
are about 5 ns1. The kinetic model is used in to establish approxi-
mate expressions for transport properties.
Koopmans’ Theorem
Koopmans’ theorem states that the ionization energy of an electron
from a specified orbital is equal to the negative of the one-electron
energy of that orbital:
Ii ¼  ei
The theorem is only an approximation because it ignores the adjust-
ment in electron density that occurs when one electron is removed.
