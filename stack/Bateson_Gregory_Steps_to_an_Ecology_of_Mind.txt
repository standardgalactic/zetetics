STEPS TO AN ECOLOGY OF MIND
Here is the book which develops a new way of think-
ing about the nature of order and organization in
living systems, a unified body of theory so encom-
passing that it illuminates all particular areas of study
of biology and behavior. It is interdisciplinary, not in
the usual and simple sense of exchanging information
across lines of discipline, but in discovering patterns
common to many disciplines.
. "In this invaluable book, systemic intellectual
clarity and moral clarity convene and evoke
a convincing ethic of what is sacred, what is
right for life. lowe more understanding than
I know to Gregory Bateson and Steps to an
Ecology of Mind."

Preface
I have been one of Gregory Bateson's students for three
years and I was able to help him select the essays which
are here brought together for the first time in one volume.
I believe that this is a very important book, not only for
those who are professionally concerned with the behavioral
sciences, biology, and philosophy, but also and. especially
for those of my generation-the generation born since Hiro-
shima-who are searching for a better understanding of'
themselves and their world.
The central idea in this book is that we create the world
that we perceive, not. because there is no reality outside
our heads
(the Indochinese war
is· wrong, we are
de-
stroying our ecosystem and therefore ourselves, whether we
believe it or not), but because we select and edit the reality
we see to conform to our beliefs about what sort of world we
live in. The maD. who believes that the resources of the world
are infinite, for example, or that if something is good for you
then the more of it the better, will not be able to see
-his errors, because he will not look for evidence of them.
For a man to change his basic, perception-determining be-
liefs-what Bateson calls his epistemological premises-he
must first become aware that reality is not necessarily as
he believes it to be. This is not an easy or comfortable
thing to learn, and most men in history have probably been
able to avoid thinking about it. And I am not convinced
that tne unexamined life is never worth leading. But some-
times the dissonance between reality and false beliefs reach-
es a point when it becomes impOSSible to avoid the aware-
ness that the world no longer makes sense. Only then is
it possible for
the mind to consider radically different
ideas and perceptions.
Specifically, it is clear that our cultural mind has .c~~e
to such a point. But there is danger as well as possl?ility
in our situation. There is no guarantee that the new Ideas

brought me to the very edge of what later became cy-
bernetics, but I lacked the concept of negative feedback.
When I returned from overseas after the war, I went to
Frank Fremont-Smil!h of the Macy Foundation to ask for a
conference on this then-mysterious matter. Frank said that
he had just arranged such a .conference with McCulloch
as chairman. H thus happened that I was privileged to be
a member of the famous Macy Conferences on Cybernet-
ics. My debt to Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John
von
Neumann, Evelyn Hutchinson,
and
other members
of these conferences is evident in everything that I have
written since World War II.
In my first attempts to synthesize cybernetic ideas with
anthropological data, I had the benefit of a Guggenheim
Fellowship.
In the period of my entry into the psychiatric field, it
was Jurgen Ruesch, with whom I worked in the Langley
Porter Clinic, who initiated me into many of the curious
features of the psychiatric world.
From 1949 to 1962, I had the title of ''Ethnologist'' in
the Veterans Administration Hospital at Palo Alto, where I
was given singular freedom to study whatever I thought in-
teresting. I was protected from outside demands and given
this freedom' by the director of the hospital, Dr. John J.
Prusmack.
In this period, Bernard Siegel suggested that the Stan-
ford University Press republish my book, Naven, which had
fallen Hat on its.face when first published in 1936; and I
was lucky enough to get film footage of a sequence of play
between otters in the Fleishhacker Zoo which seemed to
me of such theoretical interest as to justify a small research
program.
lowe my first ~research grant in the psychiatric field to
the late Chester Barnard of the Rockefeller Foundation,
who had kept a copy of Naven for some years by his bed-
side. This was a grant to study "the role of the Paradoxes
of Abstraction in Communication."
C
Under this grant, Jay Haley, John Weakland, and Bill Fry
joined me to form a small research team within the V.A.
Hospital.
But again there was failure. Our grant was for only
two years, Chester Barnard had retired, and in the opin-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
xi
on of the Foundation staff we did not have enough re-
sults to justify renewal. The grant ran out, but my team
loyally stayed with me without pay. The work went on, and,
·a few days after the end of. the grant, while I was writing
a desperate letter to Norbert Wiener for ibis advice about
where to get the next grant, the double bind hypothesis
fell into place.
Finally Frank Fremont-Smith and the Macy Foundation
saved us.
Mter that there were grants from the Foundations Fund
for Psychiatry and from the National Institute of Mental
Health.
Gradually it appeared that for the next advances in the
study of logical typing in communication I should work
with animal material, and I started to work with octopus.
My wife, Lois, worked with me, and for over a year we
kept about a dozen octopuses in our living room. This
preliminary work was promising but needed to be repeated
and extended under better conditions. For this no grants
were available.
At this point, John Lilly came forward and invited me to
be the director of his dolphin laboratory in the Virgin Is-
lands. I worked there for about a year and became inter-
ested in the problems of cetacean communication, but I
think I am not cut out to administer a laboratory dubiously
funded in a place where the logistics are intolerably diffi-
cult.
H was while I was struggling with these problems that
I received a Career Development Award under the Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health. These awards were ad-
ministered by Bert Boothe, and lowe much to his con-
tinued faith and interest.
In 1963, Taylor Pryor of the Oceanic Foundation in
Hawaii invited me to work in his Oceanic Institute on ceta-
ceanand other problems of animal and human communica-
tion. It is here that I have written more than half of the
present book, including the whole of Part V.
While in Hawaii, I have also been working recently with
the Culture Learning Institute of the East-West Center in
the University of Hawaii, and owe some theoretical in-
sights regarding Learning III to discussions held in that
Institute.

Introduction:
The Science of Mind and Drder*
The title of this book of collected essays and lectures
is intended precisely to define the contents. The essays,
spread over thirty-five years, combine to propose a new
way of thinking about kkas and about those aggregates
of ideas which I call "minds." This way of thinking I call
the "ecology of mind," or the ecology of ideas. It is a
science which does not yet exist as an organized body of
theory ~r knowledge.
But the definition of an "idea" which the essays combine
to propose is much wider and more fonnal than is con-
ventional. The essays must speak for themselves, but here
at the beginning let me state my belief that such matters
as the bilateral symmetry of an animal, the patterned ar-
rangement of leaves in a plant, the escalation of an anna-
ments race, the processes of courtship, the nature of play,
the grammar of a sentence, the mystery of biological evo-
lution, and the contemporary crises in man's relationship to
his environment, can only be understood in tenns of such
an ecology of ideas as I propose.
The questions which the book raises are ecological: How
do ideas interact? Is there some sort of natural selection
which determines the survival of some ideas and the ex-
tinction or death of others? What sort of economics limits
the multiplicity of ideas ina given region of min~? What

Evidently I was not answering the question, "An example
of what?"
,
In desperation, I constructed a diagram to describe what
I conceive to be the task of the scientist. By use of this
diagram, it became clear that a difference between my
habits of thought and thOse of my students sprang from
the fact that they were trained to think and argue inductive-
ly from data to hypotheses but never to test hypotheses
against knowledge derived by deduction from the fuDda-
mentals of science or philosophy.
The diagram had three columns. On the left, I listed
various sorts of uninterpreted data, such as a film record
of human or animal behavior, a description of an experiment,
a description or photograph of a beetle's leg, or a recorded
human utterance. I stressed the fact that "data" are not
events or objects but always records or descriptions
or
memories of events or objects. Always there is a transforma-
tion or recoding of the raw event which intervenes between
the scientist and his object. The weight of an object is
measured against the weight of some other object or reg-
istered on a meter. The human voice is transformed into
variable magnetizations of tape. Moreover, always -and in-
evitably, there is a selection of data because the t?tal uni-
verse, past and present, is not subject to observation from
any given observer's position.
In a strict sense, therefore, no data are truly "raw," and
every record has been -somehow subjected to editing and
transformation either by man or byhis instruments. ,
But still the data are the most reliable source of informa-
tion, and from them the scientist must start. They provide
his first inspiration and to them he must later return.
In the middle column, I listed a number of imperfectly
deflned explanatory notions which are commonly used in the
behavioral sciences- "ego," "anxiety," "instinct," "purpose,"
"mind," "self," "flxed action pattern," "intelligence," "stu-
pidity," "maturity," and the like, For the sake of politeness, I
call these "heuristic" concepts; but, in truth, most of them are
so loosely derived and. so mutually irrelevant that they mix
together to make a sort of conceptual fog which does much
to delay the progress of science.
.
In the right-hand column, I listed what I call "funda-
mentals." These are of two kinds: propositions and systems

1 - Moliere, long ago, depicted an oral doctoral examination in

which the learned doctors ask the candidate to state the
"cau~eand .reason" why opium puts people to sleep. The
candidate triumphantly answers in dog Latin, "Because there
is in it a donnitive principle (virtus dormitiva),"
<?haracteristi~lly,,the scientist: confronts a complex inter-
active system-m this case, an interaction between man and
opium. He observes a change in the system-the man falls

i
er
e opium· contains
a remed dormitive prinCiple, or the man contains ·a remed
need for sleep, an adormitosis, which is "expressed" in his
response to opium.
And, characteristically, all such hypotheses are "donnitive"
in the sense that they put to sleep the "critical faculty"
(another remed fictitious cause) within the scientist him-
seH.
The state of mind or habit of thought which goes from
data to donnitive hypothesis and back to data is seH-rein-
forcing. There is, among all scientists, a high value set upon
prediction, and, indeed, to be able to predict phenomena is
a fine thing. But prediction is a rather poor test of an hypoth-
esis, and this is especially true of "dormitive hypotheses,"
H we assert that opium contains a dormitive principle, we
can then devote a lifetime of research to studying the
characteristics of this principle. Is it heat-stable? In which
fraction of a distillate is it located? What is its molecular
formula? And so on. Many of these questions will be an-
swerable in the laboratory and will lead on to derivative
hypotheses no less "dormitive" than that from which we
started.
In fact, the multiplication of dormitive hypotheses is a
symptom of excessive preference for induction, and this pref-
erence must always lead to something like the present state
of the behavioral sciences-a mass· of quaSi-theoretical speo-
ulation unconnected with any core of fundamental knowl-
edge.
In contrast, I try to teach students-and this collection
of essays is very much concerned with trying to communicate
this thesis-that in scientific research you 'start from two
beginnings, each of which has its own kind of authority: the

of careful philosophic and humanistic thought about man-
who cannot define either entropy or a sacrament-had better
hold his peace rather than add to the existing jungle of
half-baked hypotheses.
But the gulf between the heuristic and the fundamental
is not solely due to empiricism and the inductive habit, nor
even to the seductions of quick application and the faulty
educational system which makes profeSSional scientists out
of men who care little for the fundamental structure of
science. It is due also to the circumstance that a very
large part of the fundamental structure of nineteenth-century
science was inappropriate or irrelevant to the problems and
phenomena which confronted the biologist and behavioral
scientist.
For at least 200 years, say· from the time of Newton
to the late nineteenth century, the dominant preoccupation
of science was with those chains of cause and effect which
could be referred to forces and impacts. The mathematics
available to Newton was preponderantly quantitative, and
this fact, combined with the central focus upon forces and
impacts, led men to measure with remarkable accuracy quan-
tities of distance, time, matter, and energy.
As the measurements of the surveyor must jibe with
Euclidean geometry, so scientific thought had to jibe with
the great conservative laws. The description of any event
examined by a physicist or chemist was to be founded upon·
budgets of mass and energy, and this rule gave a particular
kind of rigor to the whole of thought in the hard sciences.
The early pioneers of behavioral science not unnaturally
began their survey of behavior by desiring a similar rigor-

ous base to guide their speculations. Le~gth and mass were
concepts which they could hardly use in describing behavior
(whatever that might be), but energy seemed more handy,
It was tempting to relate "energy" to already existing meta-
.1.
phors such as "strength" of emotions or character or "vigor."
Or to think of "energy" as somehow the opposite of "fatigue"
or "apathy." Metabolism obeys an energy budget (within
the smct meaning of "energy"), and energy expended in
behavior must surely be included in this budget; therefore
it seemed sensible to think of energy as a determinant of
behavior.
It would have been more fruitful to think of lack of
energy as preventive of behavior, since in the end a starv-
ing man will cease to behave. But even this will not do:
an amoeba, deprived of food, becomes for a time more
active. Its energy expenditure is an inverse function of energy
input.
The nineteeth-century scientists
(notably Freud)
who
med to establish a bridge between behavioral data and the
fundamentals of physical and chemical science were, surely,
correct in insisting upon the need for such a bridge but,
I believe, wrong in choosing "energy" as the foundation
for that bridge.
If mass and length are inappropriate for the describing
of behavior, then energy is unlikely to be more appropriate.
Mter all, energy is Mass X Velocity2, and no behavioral
scientist really insists that "psychic energy" is of these dimen-
sions.
It is necessary,
therefore,
to
look
again
among
the
fundamentals for an appropriate set of ideas aga,inst which
we can test our heuristic hypotheses.
But some will argue that the time is not yet ripe; that
surely the fundamentals of science were all arrived at by
inductive reasoning from experience, so we should continue
with induction until we get a fundamental answer.
I believe that it is simply not true that the fundamentals
of science began in induction from experience, and I sug-
gest that in the search for a bridgehead among the funda-
mentals we should go back to the very beginnings of scien-
tific and philosophic thought; certainly to a period before
science, philosophy, and religion had become separateac-

CIplines.
Consider, for example, the central origin myth of the
Juda~o-Christi.an ?eoples. What are the fundamental philo-
sophic and SCIentific problems with which this myth is con-
cerned?
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God
divided the light from the darkness. And God called
the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And
the evening and the morning were the first day.
And God said, ~t there be a firmament in the midst
of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the
waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the
waters which were~ under the firmament from the waters
which were above the firmament: and it was so. And
God called the firmament Heaven.. And the evening and
the morning were the second day.
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be
gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land
appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land
Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called

Authorized version
Out of these first ten verses of thunderous prose, we can
draw some of the premises or fundamentals of ancient Chal-
dean thought and it is strange, almost eerie, to note how
many of the fundamentals and problems of modem science
are foreshadowed in the ancient docwnent.
(1) The problem of the origin and nature of matter is
summarily dismissed.
(2) The passage deals at length with the problem of
the origin of order.

lt
xxiv
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
(3) A separation is thus generated between the two sorts
of problem. It is possible that this separation of problems
was an error, but-error or not-the separation is maintained
in the fundamentals of modem science. The conservative laws
for matter and energy are still separate from the laws of
order, negative entropy, and information.
(4) Order is seen as a matter of sorting and dividing.
But the essential notion in all sorting is that some diHerence
shall cause some other diHerence at a later time. If we are
sorting black balls from white balls, or large balls from small
balls, a diHerence among the balls is to be followed by a
difference in their location-balls of one class to one sack
and balls of another class to another. For such an operation,
we need something like a sieve,a threshold, or, par excel-
lence, a sense organ. It is understandable, therefore, that
a perceiving Entity should have been invoked to .perform
this function of creating an otherwise improbable order.
.
(5) Closely linked with the sorting and dividing is the
mystery of classification, to be followed later by the extraor-
dinary human achievement of naming.
It is not at all clear that the various components of this
myth are all products of inductive reasoning from experi-
ence. And the matter becomes still more puzzling when
this origin myth is compared with others which embody
diHerent fundamental premises.
Among the Iatmul of New Guinea, the central origin
myth, like the Genesis story, deals with the question of
how dry land was separated from water. They say that
in the beginning the crocodile Kavwokmali paddled with
his front legs and with his hind legs; and his paddling kept
the mud suspended in the water. The great culture hero,
Kevembuangga, came with his spear lind killed Kavwok-
mali. Mter that the mud settled and dry land was formed.
Kevembuangga then stamped with his foot on the dry
land, i.e., he proudly demonstrated "that it was good."
Here there is a stronger case for deriving the myth from
experience combined with inductive reasoning. Mter all,
mud does remain in suspension if randomly stirred and does
settle when the stirring ceases. Moreover, the Iatmul people
live in the vast swamps of the Sepik River valley where
the separation of land from water is imperfect. It is under-
.~

standable that they might be interested in the differentia-
tion of land from water.
In any case, the Iatmul have arrived at a theory of order
which is almost a precise converse of that of the book of
Genesis. In Iatmul thought, sorting will occur if randomiza-
tion is prevented. In Genesis, an agent is invoked to do
the sorting and dividing.
But both cultures alike assume a fundamental division
between the problems of material creation and the prob-
lems of order and·diHerentiation.
Returning now to the question of whether the fundamentals
o~ science fID;d/ or ?hilosophy were, at the primitive level, ar-
nved at by mductive reasoning from empirical data, we find
that the answer is not Simple. It is difficult to see how the di-
chotomy between substance and form could be arrived at by
inductive argument. No man, after all
has ever seen or
experienced formless and unsorted matter; just as no man
has ever seen or experienced a "random" event. If, there-
fore, the·notion of a universe "without form and void" was
arrived at by induction, it was by a monstrous-and per-
haps erroneous-jump of extrapolation.
~d even ~o'. i~ is n~t clear that the starting point from
w~ch the prmutive philosophers took off was observation.
It IS at least equally likely that dichotomy between form
and substance was an unconscious deduction from the sub-
ject-predicate relation in the structure of primitive language.
This, however,· is a matter beyond the reach of useful specu-
lation.
~e that as it may, the central-but usually not explicit-
SU?Jee:t ma~ter of the lectures which I used to give to psy-
chiatric reSIdents and of these essays is the bridge between
behavioral data and the "fundamentals" of science and
philosophy; and my critical comments above about the meta-
phOric use of "energy" in the behavioral sciences add up to a
rather ~ple acx:usation of many of my colleagues, that they
have tried to build the bridge to the wrong half of the an-
cient dichotomy between form and substance. The conserva-
tive laws for
e~ergy and matter concern substance rather
than form. But mental process, ideas, communication organi-
zation, diHerentiation, pattern, and so on, are matters'of form
rather than substance.
Within the body of fundamentals, that half which deals

Part 1: Metalogues
DEFINITION: A metalogue is a conversation about some
problematic subject. This conversation should be such
that not only do the participants discuss the problem
but the structure of the conversation as a whole is also
relevant to the same subject. Only some of the con-
versations here presented achieve this double format.
Notably, the history of evolutionary theory is in-
evitably a metalogue between man and nature, in which
the creation and interaction of ideas must necessarily
exemplify evolutionary process.

Metalogue: Why Do Things Get in a Muddle?*
Daughter:
Daddy, why do things get in a muddle?
Father:
What do you mean? Things? Muddle?
D:
Well, people spend a lot of time tidying things, but
they never seem to spend time muddling them. Things
just seem to get in a muddle by themselves. And
then people have to tidy them up again.
F:
But do your things get in a muddle if you don't
touch them?
.
D:
No-not if nob,ody touches them. But if you touch
them-or if anybody touches them-they get in a
muddle and it's a worse muddle if it isn't me.
F:
Yes-that's why I try to keep you from touching the
things on my desk. Because my things get in a worse
muddle if they are touched by somebody who isn't
1ne.
D:
But do people always muddle other people's things?
Why do they, Daddy?
F:
Now, wait a minute. It's not so simple. First of all,
what do you mean by a muddle?
D:
I mean-so I can't find things, and so it looks all
muddled up. The way it is when nothing is straight-
F:
Well, but are you sure you mean the same thing by
muddle that anybody else would mean?

tidy person and if I say things are in a muddle,
I'm sure everybody else would agree with me.
All right-but do you think you mean the same thing
by "tidy" that other people would? If your mummy
makes your things tidy, do you know where to find
them?
Hmm ••• sometimes-because, you see, I know where
she puts-things when she tidies up-
Yes, I try to keep her away from tidying my desk,
too. I'm sure that she and I ·don't mean the same
thing by "tidy."
Daddy, do you and I mean the same thing by "tidy?"
I doubt it, my dear-I doubt it.
But, Daddy, isn't that a funny thing-that everybody
means the same when they say "muddled" but every-
body means something diHerent by "tidy." But "tidy"
is the opposite of "muddled," isn't it?
F:
Now we begin to get into more difficult questions.
Let's start again from the beginning. You said ''Why
do things always get in a muddle?" Now we have
made a step or two-and let's change the question to
"Why do things get in a state which Cathy calls 'not
tidy?' " Do you see why I want to make that change?
D: •.. Yes, I think so-because if I have a
~pecial
meaning for "tidy" then some of other people's "tidies"
will look like muddles to me-even if we do 'agree
about most of what we call muddles-
F:
That's right. Now-let's look at what you call tidy.
When your paint box is put in a tidy place, where is it?
D:
Here on the end of this shelf.
.,
F:
Okay-now if it were anywhere else?
D:
No, that would not be tidy.
F:
What about the other end of the shelf, here? Like
this?
D:
No, that's not where it belongs, and anyhow it would
have to be straight, not all crooked the way you put
it.
F:
Oh-in the right place and straight.
D:
Yes.
F:
Well, that means that there are only very few places
which are "tidy" for your paint box-
D:
Only one place-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
5
No-very few places, because if I move it a little bit,
like this, it is still tidy.
All right-but very, very few places.
All right, very, very few places. Now what about
the teddy bear and your doll, and the Wizard of Oz
and your sweater, and your shoes? It's the same for
all the things, isn't it, that each thing has only a very,
very few places which are "tidy" for that thing?
D:
Yes, Daddy-but the Wizard of Oz could be any-
where on that shelf. And Daddy-do you know what?
I hate, hate it when my books get all mixed up with
your books and Mummy's books.
F:
Yes, I know. (Pause)
D:
Daddy, you didn't finish. Why do my things get the
way I say isn't tidy?
F:
But I have flnished-it's just because there are more
ways which you call "untidy" than there are ways
which you call "tidy."
D:
But that isn't a reason why-
F:
But, yes, it is. And it is the real and only and very
bnportantreason.
D:
Oh, Daddyl Stop it.
F:
No, I'm not fooling. That is the reason, and all of
science is hooked up with that reason. Let's take an-
other example. If I put some sand in the bottom of
this cup and. put some sugar on the top of it, and
now stir it with a teaspoon, the sand and the sugar
will get mixed up, won't they?
.
D:
Yes, but, Daddy, is it fair to shift over to talking about
"mixed up" when we started with "muddled up?"
F:
Hmm ••• I wonder ••• but I think so-Yes-because
let's say we can find somebody who thinks it is more
tidy to have all the sand underneath all the sugar. And
if you like rll say I want it that way-
D:
Hmm •••
F:
All right-take another example. Sometbnes in the
movies you will see a lot of letters of the alphabet all
scattered over the screen, all higgledy-piggledy and
some even upside down. And then something shakes
the table so that the letters start to move, and then as
the shaking goes on, the letters all come together to
spell the title of the film.

But-no-that's not sensible. He cannot do all that work
so that lat6f' he will be able to tell the other guy that
he is angry by just keeping his own arms still. How does

He doesn't know. But, just incase •.•
No, Daddy, it doesn't make sense. I don't smile so as
to be able to tell you I am angry by not smiling later on.
Yes-I think that that is part of the reason for smiling.
And there are lots of people who smile in order to tell
you that they are not angry-when they really are.
But that's different, Daddy. That's a sort of telling lies
with one's face. Like playingpoker.
Yes.
Now where are we? You don't think it sensible for
Frenchmen to work so hard to tell each other that
they are not angry or hurt. But after all what is most
conversation about? I mean, among Americans?
But, Daddy, it's about all sorts of things-baseball and
ice cream and gardens and games. And people talk
about other people and about themselves and about
what they got for Christmas.
Yes, yes-but who listens? I mean-all right, so they
talk about baseball and gardens. But are they exchang-

Daddy, when they teach us French at school, why don't
they teach us to wave our hands?
I don't know. I'm sure I don't know. That is probably
one of the reasons why people find learning languages
so difficult.
can never convey the same message as gestures-if
there are no "mere words"?
Well, the words might be written.
No---:-that won't let me out of the difficulty. Because
written words still have some sort of rhythm and they
still have overtones. The point is that no mere words
exist. There are only words with either gesture or tone
of voice or something of the sort. But, of course,
ges~
tures without words are common enough.
Anyhow, it is all nonsense. I mean, the notion that
language is made of words is all nonsense-and when I
said that gestures could not be translated into "mere
words," I was talking nonsense, because there is no
such thing as "mere words." And all the syntax and
grammar and all that stuff is nonsense. It's all based on
the idea that "mere" words exist-and there are none.
But, Daddy ...
I
t~ll ,you-we have to start all over again from the
begmmng and assume that language is Drst and fore-
most a system of gestures. Animals after all have only
gestures and tones of voice-and words were invented
later. Much later. And after that they invented school-
masters.
Daddy?
Yes.
Would it be a good thing if people gave up words and
went back to only using gestures?
Hmm. I don't know. Of course we would not be able to
have any Conversations like this. We could only bark, or
mew, and wave our arms about, and laugh and grunt
and weep. But it might be fun-it would make life a
sort of ballet-with dancers making their own music.

No, it isn't-not for you it isn't.
Because I don't even want to cheat?
Yes-partly that.
But do you want to cheat and bluff all the time?
No--of course not.
Well then?
Oh-Daddy-you'll never understand.
I guess I never will.
Look, I scored a sort of debating point just now by
forcing you to admit that you don't want to cheat-
and then I tied onto that admission the conclusion that
therefore the conversations are not "serious" for you
either. Was that a sort of cheating?
Yes-sort of.
I agree-I think it was. I'm sorry.
You see, Daddy-if I cheated or wanted to cheat, that
would mean that I was not serious about the things we
talk about. It would mean that I was only playing a game
with you.
F:
Yes, that makes sense.
D:
But it doesn't make sense, Daddy. It's an awful muddle.
F:
Yes-a muddle-but still a sort of sense.
D:
How, Daddy?
Wait a minute. This is difficult to say. First of alI-
I think that we get somewhere with these conversations.
I enjoy them very much and I think you do. But also,
apart from that, I think that we get some ideas straight
and I think that the muddles help. I mean-that if we
both spoke logically all the time, we would never get
anywhere. We would only parrot all the old cliches that
everybody has repeated for hundreds of years.
D:
What is a cliche, Daddy?
F:
A cliche,? It's a French word, and I think it was originally
a printer's word. When they print a sentence they have
to take the separate letters and put them one by one
into a sort of grooved stick to spell out the sentence.
But for words and sentences which people use often,
.the printer keeps little sticks of letters ready made up.
And these ready-made sentences are called cliches.

You brought up two questions. And really there are a
lot more: .• We started from the question about these
conversations-are they serious? Or are they a sort of
ga~e? And you felt .hurt that I might be playing a game,
~hil~ you wer~ senous. It looks as though a conversa-
tion IS a game if a person takes part in it with one set of
emotions or ideas-but not a "game" if his ideas or
emotions are different.
Yes, it's if your ideas about the conversation are different
from mine .••
F:
If we both had the game idea, it would be all right?
D:
Yes-of course.
F:
Then it seems to be up to me to make clear what I
mean by the game idea. I know that I am serious-
whatever that means-about the things that we talk
about. We talk about ideas. And I know that I play
with the ideas in order to understand them and fit
them together. It's "play" in the same sense that a
small ,child "plays" with blocks ••• And a child with
buil~~ blocks is mostly very serious about his "play."

mg together to build the ideas up so that they will
stand.

Daddy, do our talks have rules? The difference between
a game and just playing is that a game has rules
Yes. Let'me think about that. I think we do have ~ sort
of rules • • . and I think a child playing with blocks
D:
F:
D:
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
But I've forgotte'n now what you were saying
cliches, Daddy.
Yes-it was about the muddles that we get into in
these talks and how getting into muddles makes a sort
of sense. If we didn't get into muddles, our talks would
be like playing rumniy without first shufHing the cards.
Yes, Daddy-but what about those things-the ready-
made sticks of letters?
>i.1
The cliches? Yes-it's the same thing. We all have lots 11
of ready-made phrases and ideas, and the printer has-'!
ready-made sticks of letters, all sorted out into phrases. 1
•..
But if the printer wants to print something new-say,
something iIi a new language, he will have to break up
all that old sorting of the. letters. In the same way, in
order to think new thoughts or to say new things, we
have to break up all our ready-made ideas and shuffle
the pieces.
But, Daddy, the printer would not shuffle all the let-
ters? Would he? He wouldn't shake them all up in a
bag. He would put them one by one in their places-
all the as in one box and all the b's in another, and all
the commas in another, and so on.
Yes-that's right. Otherwise he would go mad trying to
find an a when he wanted it.

D:
Well, I see what you mean about our getting into mud-
dIes. That that makes us say new sorts of things. But I
am thinking about the printer. He has to keep all his
little letters sorted out even though he breaks up all
the ready-made phrases. And I am wondering about
our muddles. Do we have to keep the little pieces of
our thought in some sort of order-to keep from going
mad?
F:
I think so--yes-but I don't know what sort of order.
That would be a terribly hard question to answer. I
don't think we could get an answer to that question
today.

Yes, that's right. We can play canasta whenever we
want to. But at the moment I would rather play this
game. Only I don't know what sort of a game this is. Nor
what sort of rules it has.
And yet we have been playing for some time.
Yes. And it's been fun.
Yes.
Let's go back to the question which you asked and
which I said was too difficult to answer today. We were
talking about the printer breaking up his cliches, and
you said that he 'would still keep Some sort of order
among his letters-to keep from going mad. And then
you asked "What sort of order should we cling to so
that when we get into a muddle we do not go mad?" It
seems to, me that the "rules" of the game is only an-
other name for that sort of order.
D:
Yes-and cheating is what gets us into muddles.
F:
In a sense, yes. That's right. Except that the whole
point of the game is that we do get into muddles, and
do come out on the other side, and if there were no
muddles our "game" would be like canasta or chess-
and that is not how we Want it to be.
D:
Is it you that make the rules, Daddy? Is that fair?
F:
That, daughter, is a dirty crack. And probably an unfair
one. But let me accept it at face value. Yes, it is I who
make the rules-after all, I do not want us to go mad.
D:
All right. But, Daddy, do you also change the rules?
Sometimes?
F:
Hmm, another dirty crack. Yes, daughter, I change
them constantly. Not all of them, but some of them.
D:
I wish you'd tell me when you're going to change themI
F:
Hrnm-yes-again. I wish I could. But it isn't like that.·
If it were like chess or canasta, I could tell you the
rules, and we could, if we wanted to, stop playing and
discuss the rules. And then we could start a new game
with the new rules. But what rules would hold us be-
tween the two games? While we were discussing the
rules?

I don't understand.
Yes. The point is that the purpose of these conversa-
tions is to discover the

D:
How did we get into it, Daddy?
F:
All right, let's see if we can retrace our steps. We were
talking about the "rules" of these conversations. And I
said that the ideas that we play with have rules of
logic...
'
D:
Daddyl Wouldn't it be a good thing if we had a few
more rules and obeyed them more carefully? Then we
might not get into these dreadful muddles.
F:
Yes. But wait. You mean that I get us into these muddles
because I cheat against rules which we don't have. Or
put it this way. That we might have rules which would
stop us from getting into muddles-as long as we obeyed
them.
D:
Yes,Daddy, that's what the rules of a game are for.
F:
Yes, but do you want to turn these conversations into.
D:
that sort of a game? I'd rather play canasta-which ,;

F:
is fun too.
D:
But you said that if we always talked logically and did
not get into muddles, we could never say anything new.
We could only say ready-made things. What did you
call those things?
F:
Cliches. Yes. Glue is what cliches are stuck together
with.

has rules. The blocks themselves make a sort of rules
They will balance in certain positions and they will not
balance in other positions. And it would be a sort of'
cheating if the child used glue to make the blocks
stand up in a position from which they would otherwise
fall.
D:
But what rules do we have?
F:
Well, the ideas that we play with bring in a sort of rules.
There are rules about how ideas will stand up and sup-'
port each other. And if they are wrongly put together
the whole building falls down.

No gIue, Daddy?

No-no glue. Only logic.

I use about a quarter of it-or use it at about a quarter
efficiency. So let's say half a pound.

know more than I do?

Hmm-I once knew a little boy in England who asked
his father, "Do fathers always know more than sons?"
and the father said, "Yes,"

"Daddy, who invented the steam engine?" and the fa-
ther said, "James Watt." And then the son came back
with "-but why didn't James Watt's father invent it?"

I don't like arithmetic, Daddy.
F:
Yes, I knpw. The working it out is dull, but some of the
ideas in it are amusing. Anyhow, you wanted to know
how to measure knowledge, and if you start measuring
things that always leads to arithmetic.
D:
We haven't measured any knowledge yet.
~
F:
No. I know. But we have made a step or two toward
knowing how we would measure" it if we wanted to.
And that means we are a little nearer to knowing what
knowledge is.
'
D:
That would be a funny sQrLpf knowledge, Daddy. I
mean knowing about knowledge--would we measure
that sort of knowing the same way?
F:
Wait a minute--I don't know-that's really the $64
Question on this subject. Because--well, let's go back
to the game of Twenty Questions. The point that we
. never mentioned is that those questions have to be in
a certain order. First the wide general question and then
the detailed question. And it's only from answers to the
wide questions that I know which detailed questions
to ask. But we counted them all alike. I don't know.
But now you ask me if knowing about knowledge would
be measured the same way as other knowledge. And
the answer must surely be no. You see, if the early
questions in the game tell me what questions to ask
later, then 'they must be partly questions about know-
ing. They're explOring the business of knowing.

F:
But yes I can, too. H the things to be multiplied are
pieces of knowledge or facts or something like that.
Because every one of them is a double something.
D:
I don't understand.
F:
Well-at least a double something.
D:
Daddy!
F:
Yes-take the game of Twenty Questions. You think of
something. Say you think of "tomorrow." All right. Now
I ask "Is it abstra<:t?" and you say "Yes." Now from
your "yes" I have got a double bit of information. I
know that it is abstract and I know that it isn't concrete.
Or say it this way-from your "yes" I can halve the
number of pOSSibilities of what the thing can be. And
that's a multiplyirig by one over two.
D:
Isn't it a division?
F:
Yes-it's the same thing. I mean-all right-it's a multi-
plication by .5. The important thing is that it's not just
a subtraction or an addition.

clearer way of saying it. I mean it's clearer than talking
about bits of knowledge and trying to count them.

D:
Daddy, why don't you use the other three-quarters of
your brain?
F:
Oh, yes-that-you see the trouble is that I had school-
teachers too.· And they :6.lled up about a quarter of my
brain with fog. And then I read newspapers and lis-
tened to what other people said, and that filled up
another quarter with fog.
D:
And the other quarter, Daddy?

F:
Oh-that's fog that I made for myself when I was trying
to think.
Metalogue: Why Do Things Have Dutlims?*
Daughter: Daddy, why do things have outlines?
Father:
Do they? I don't know. What sort of things do you
mean?
.
D:
I mean when I draw things, why do they have outlines?
F:
Well, what about other sorts of things-a Hock of sheep?
or a conversation? Do they have outlines?
D:
Don't be silly. I can't draw a conversation. 1 mean
things.
F:
Yes-l was trying to find out just what you meant. Do
you mean "Why do we give things outlines when we
draw them?" or do you mean that the things have out-
lines whether we draw them or not?
D:
I don't know, Daddy. You tell me. Which do I mean?
F:
I don't know, my dear. There was a very angry artist
once who scribbled all sorts of things down, and after
he was dead they looked in his books and in one place
they found he'd written
~'Wise men see outlines and
therefore they draw them" but in another place he'd
written "Mad men see outlines and therefore they draw
them."
D:
But whioh does he mean? I don't understand.
F:
Well, William Blake-that was his name-wasa great
artist and a very angry man. And sometimes he rolled

up his ideas into little spitballs so that he could throw
them at people.
D:
But what was he mad about, Daddy?
F:
But what was he mad about? Oh, I see-you mean
"angry," We have to keep those two meanings of "mad"
clear if we are going to talk about Blake. Because a lot
of people thought he was mad-really mad-crazy.
And that was one of the things he was mad-angry about.
And then he was mad-angry, too, about some artists
who painted pictures as though things didn't have out-
lines. He called them "the slobbering school,"
D:
He wasn't very tolerant, wasae, Daddy?
F:
Tolerant? Oh, -God. Yes, I know-that's what they drum
into youat school. No, Blake was not very tolerant. He
didn't even think tolerance was a good thing. It was just
more slobbering. He thought it blurred all the outlines
and muddled everything-that it made all cats gray.
So that nobody would be able to see anything clearly
and sharply.
D:
Yes, Daddy.
F:
No, that's not the answer. I mean "Yes, Daddy" is not
the answer. All that says is that you don't know what
your opini9n is-and you don't give a damn what I
say or what Blake says and that the school has so
befuddled you with talk about tolerance that you can-
not tell the difference between anything and anything
else.
D:
(Weeps.)
F:
Oh, God. I'm sorry, but I was angry. But not really an-
gry with you. Just angry at the general mushiness of how
people act and think-and how they preach muddle
and call it tolerance.
D:
But, Daddy-
F:
Yes?
D:
I don't know. I don't seem able to think very well. It's
all in a muddle.
F:
I'm sorry. I suppose I muddled you by starting to let off
steam.

D:
Daddy?
F:
Yes?
D:
Why is that something to get angry about?
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
29
F:
Is what something to get angry about?
D:
I mean-about whether things have outlines. You said
William Blake got angry about it. And then you get
angry about it. Why is that, Daddy?
F:
Yes, in a way I think it is. I think it matters. Perhaps in
a way, is ,the thing that matters. And other things only
matter because they are part of this.
D:
What do you mean, Daddy?
F:
I mean, well, let's talk about tolerance. When Gentiles
want to bully Jews because they killed Christ, I get
intolerant. I think the
Gentiles are being muddle-
headed and are blurring all the outlines. Because the
Jews didn't kill Ghrist, the Italians did it.
D:
Did they, Daddy?
F:
Yes, only the ones who did are called Romans today,
and we have another word for their descendants. We
call them Italians. You see there are two muddles and
I was making the second muddle on purpose so we
could catch it. First there's the muddle of getting the
history wrong and saying the Jews did it, and then
there's the muddle of saying that the descendants
should be responsible for what their ancestors didn't
do. It's all slovenly.
D:
Yes, Daddy.
F:
All right, I'll try not to get angry again. All I'm trying to
say is that muddle is something to get angry about.
D:
Daddy?
F:
Yes?
D:
We were talking about muddle the other day. Are we
really talking about the same thing now?
F:
Yes. Of course we are. That's why it's important-
what we said the other day.

D:
And you said that getting things clear was what Science
was about.

Yes, that's the same thing again.

I don't seem to understand it all very well. Everything

No, hedgehogs. They Were hedgehogs. They don't have

pine.
D:
Go on about Alice and don't be silly, Daddy.
F:
Yes, we were talking about flamingos. The point is that
the man who wrote Alice was thinldng about the same
things that we are. And he amused ihimself with little
Alice by imagining a game of croquet that would be all
muddle, just absolute muddle. So he said they should
use flamingos as mallets because the flamingos would
bend their necks so the player wouldn't know even
whether his mallet would hit the ball or how it would
hit the ball.
D:
Anyhow the ball might walk away of its own accord
because it was a hedgehog.
F:
That's right. So that it's all so muddled that nobody can
tell at all what's going to happen.
D:
And the hoops walked around, too, because they were
soldiers.
F:
That's right-everything could move and nobody could
~
tell how it would move.

Did everything have to be alive so as to make a com-
plete muddle?

No-he could have made it a muddle by . . . no, I
suppose you're right. That's interesting. Yes, it had to be
that way.

minute.
It's curious but you're
right. Because if he'd muddled things any other way,
the players could have learned how· to deal with the
muddling details. I mean, suppose tb,e croquet lawn was

of the mallets just wobbly instead of being alive, then
the people could still learn and the game would only
be more difficult-it wouldn't be impossible. But once
you bring live things into it, it becomes impossible. I
wouldn't have expected that.
Wouldn't y~u, Daddy? I would have. That seems nat-
ural to me.
Natural? Sure--natural enough. But I would not have
expected it to work that way.
Why not? That's what I would have expected.
Yes. But this is the thing that I would not have ex-
pected. That animals, which are themselves able to see
things ahead and act on what they think is going to
happen:-a cat can catch a mouse by jumping to land
where the mouse will probably be when she has com-
pleted her jump-but it's just the fact that animals are
capable of seeing ahead and learning that makes them
the only really unpredictable things in the world. To
think that we try to make laws as though people were
quite regular and predictable.
D:
Or do they make the laws just because people are not
predictable, and the people who make the laws wish
the other people were predictable?
F:
Yes, I suppose so.

D:
What were we talking about?
F:
I don't quite know-not yet. But you started a new
line by asking if the game of croquet could be made
into a real muddle only by having all the things in it
alive. And I went chasing after that question, and I
don't think I've caught up with it yet. There is some-
thing funny about that point.
D:
What?
F:
I don't quite know-not yet. Something about living
things and the difference between them and the things
that are not alive--machines, stones, so on. Horses
don't fit in a world of automobiles. And that's part of
the same point. They're unpredictable, like flamingos
in the game of croquet.
D:
What about people, Daddy?

What about them?

D:
Well, they're alive. Do they fit? I mean on the streets?

But what about the danCf1r? Is she human? Of course
she feaUy is, but, on the stage, she seems inhuman or
impersonal-perhaps superhuman. I don't know.

You mean..;.....that while the swan is only a sort of swan
and has no webbing between her toes, the dancer
seems only sort of human.

What did you mean by a conversation having an out-

you're in the middle of it. Because if you could see it,

you would be predictable-like the machine. And I
would be predictable-and the two of us
together
would be predictable-
D:
But I don't understand. You say it is important to be
clear about things. And you get angry about people
who blur the outlines. And yet we think it's better to
be unpredictable and not to be like a machine. And you
say that we cannot see the outlines of our conversation
till it's over. Then it doesn't matter whether we're
clear or not. Because we cannot do anything· about it
then.

No, I suppose they don't really fit-or only by workin
pretty hard to protect themselves and make themselv
fit. Yes, they have to make themselves predictable, be-
cause otherwise the machines get angry and kill them.
D:
Don't be silly. If the machines can get angry, then
they would not be predictable. They'd be like you,
Daddy. You can't predict when you're angry, can you?
F:
No, I suppose not.
D:
But, Daddy, I'd rather have you unpredictable-soII}e-
times.
F:
No-I get confused when I speak of the "swan" and
the dancer as two different things. I would rather say
that the thing I see on the stage-the swan figure-is
both "sort of" human and "sort of" swan.
D:
But then you would be using the word "sort of" in two
senses.

F:
And then there is that other relationship which is
emphatically not "sort of." Many men have gone to the
stake for the proposition that the bread and wine are
not "sort of' the body and blood.
D:
But is that the same thing? I mean-is the swan ballet
a sacrament?
F:
Yes-I think so-at least for some people. In Protestant
language we might say that the swanlike costume
and movements of the dancer are "outward and visible
signs of some inward and spiritual grace" of woman.

ship.

Between what and what?

Between ideas, I think.

No. Between some ideas that I have about a puppet
and some ideas that I have about people.

as hounds and, greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept
all by the name of dogs.
(Macbeth, Act III, Scene 1)
No-that's what-you said just now. What was it?
"Another subdivision of a larger group?" I don't think
that's it at all.
'
No, it's not only that. Macbeth, after all, uses dogs in his
simile. And "dogs" means either noble hounds or scav-
engers. It would not be the same if he had used the
domestic varieties of cats--oi: the subspecies of wild
roses.
D:
All right, all right. But what is the answer to my
question? When a Frenchman calls a man a "sort of"
camel, and I say that the swan is "sort of" human, do
we both mean the same thing by "sort of"?
• • •
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
Yes, that's so. But anyhow, when I say that the swa
figure is "sort of' hwnan, I don't mean that it (or she ,
is a member of that species or sort which we call hwnan.
No, of-course not.
Rather that she (or it) is a member of another subdivi-
sion of a larger group which would include Petroushka .
puppets an,d ballet swans and people.

No, it's not like genera and species. Does your larger
group include geese?

F:
It's like-there's a passage in Macbeth. Macbeth is talk- -
,ing to the murderers whom he is sending out to kill
Banquo. They claim to be men, and he tells them they
are sort of men.
Ay-in the catalogue ye go for men.
F:
But we don't have to avoid puns. In French the phrase
espece de (literally "sort of') carries a special sort of
punch. If one man calls another "a camel" the insult
may be a friendly one. But if he calls him an espece de
chameau--a sort of camel-that's bad. It's still worse to
call a man an espece d'espece-a sort of a sort.
D:
A sort of a sort of what?
F:
NO-just a sort of a sort. On the other hand, if you say
of a man that he is a. true camel, the insult carries a
flavor of grudging admiration.
D:
But when a Frenchman calls a man a sort of camel, is he
using the phrase sort oj in anything like the same way
as I, when I say the swan is sort of human?

All right. Then I evidently do not know what the word
"sort of" means. But I do know that the whole of fantasy,
poetry, ballet, and art in general owes its meaning and
importance to the relationship which I refer to when
I say that the swan figure is a "sort of" swan--or a
"pretend" swan.
D:
Then we shall never know why the dancer is a swan
or a puppet or whatever, and shall never be abl~ to say
what art or poetry is until someone says what IS really
meant by "sort of."

put me off by saying, "You saw it-it is for you to de-
cide, if you want to, whether or not it is sacramental for
you," Or she might say, "Sometimes it is .and sometimes
it isn't," Or "How was I, last night?" But in any case
she can have no direct control over the matter.
• • •
Daddy, what has happened? We were trying to find
out what "sort of" means when we say that the swan
is "sort of" human. I said that there must be two senses
of "sort of," One in the phrase "the swan figure is a 'sort
of' swan, and another in the phrase "the swan figure is
'sort of' human," And now you are talking about mys-
terious secrets and control.
All right. I'll start again. The swan fIgure is not a real
swan but a pretend swan. It is also a pretend-not hu-
man being. It is also "really" a young lady wearing a
white dress. And a real swan would resemble a young
lady in certain ways.
But which of these is sacramental?
Oh Lord, here we go again. I can only say this: that it
is not one of these statements but their combination
which constitutes a sacrament. The "pretend" and the
"pretend-not" and the "really" somehow get fused to-
gether into a single meaning.
But we ought to keep them separate.
Yes. That is what the logicians and the scientists try to
do. But they do not create ballets that way-nor sacra-
ments.
F:
I mean that if we could say clearly what is meant by-'
the proposition "the bread and wine is not 'sort of'-
D:
the body and blood"; then we should know more about
what we mean when we say either that the swan is
"sort of" human or that the ballet is a sacrament.
D:
Well-howdo you tell the difference?
F:
Which difference?
D:
Between a sacrament and a metaphor.
• • •
F:
Wait a minute. We are, after all, talking about the per-
former or the artist or the poet, or a given member
of the audience. You ask me how I tell the difference
between a sacrament and a metaphor. But my answer
must deal with the person and not the message. You
ask me how I would decide whether a certain dance
on a certain day is or is not sacramental for the partic-
ular dancer.
'
D:
All right-but get on with it.
F:
Well-I think it's a sort of a secret.
D:
You mean you won't tell me?
F:
No-it's not that sort of secret. It's not something
that one must not tell. It's something that one cannot
tell.

D:
What do you mean? Why not?

that dance which you perform-is it for you a sacra·,
ment or a mere metaphor?" And let us imagine that I "

D:
Daddy, is an explanatory principle the same thing as an
hypothesis?
F:
Nearly, but not quite. You see, an hypothesis tries to
explain some particular something but an explanatory
principle-like "gravity" or "instinct"-really explains
nothing. It's a sort of conventional agreement between
scientists to stop trying to explain things at a certain
point.
D:
Then is that what Newton meant? If "gravity" explains
nothing but is only a sort of full stop at the end of a
line of explanation, then inventing gravity was not the
same as inventing an hypothesis, and he could say he
did not jingo any hypotheses.
F:
That's right. There's no explanation of an explanatory
principle. It's like a black box.
D:
Oh.
D:
Daddy, what's a black box?
F:
A "black box" is a conventional agreement between

linking together two descriptive statements is an hy-
pothesis. If you say that there was a full moon on
February 1st and another on March 1st; and then you
link these two observations together in any way, the
statement which links them is an hypothesis.
D:
Yes-and I know what non means. But what's jingo?
F:
Well-jingo is a late Latin word for "make." It forms a
verbal noun fictio from which we get the word "fiction."
D:
Daddy, do you mean that Sir Isaac Newton thought that
all hypotheses were just made up like stories?
F:
Yes-precisely that.
D:
But didn't he discover gravity? With the apple? .
F:
No, dear. He invented it.
D:
Oh.••• Daddy, who invented instinct?
F:
I don't know. Probably biblical.
D:
But if the idea of gravity links together two descriptive
statements, it must be an hypothesis.
F:
That's right.
D:
rrhen Newton did jingo an hypothesis after all.
F:
Yes-indeed he did. He was a very great scientist.
D:
Oh.
D:
Do you mean that you cannot use one explanatory
principle to explain another? Never?

Hmm... hardly ever. That is what Newton meant
when he said, "hypotheses non jingo."

And what does that mean? Please.

Daughter:
Daddy, what is an instinct?
Father:
An instinct, my dear, is a explanatory principle.
D:
But what does it explain?
F:
Anything-almost anything at all. Anything you want it
to explain.
.
D:
Don't be silly. It doesn't explain gravity.
F:
No. But that is because nobody wants "instinct" to ex-
plain gravity. If they did, it would explain it. We could
simply say that the moon has an instinct whose strength
varies inversely as the square of the distance .••
D:
But that's nonsense, Daddy.
F:
Yes, surely. But it was you who mentioned "instinct,"
not I.

.All right-but then what does explain gravity?

Nothing, my dear, because gravity is an explanatory
principle.

Self-preservative instinct?
I suppose so.
What is a self, Daddy? Does a dog know it has a self?
I don't know. But if the dog does know it has a self,
and it wiggles in order to preserve that self. then its
wiggling is rational, not instinctive.
Dh. Then a "self-preservative instinct" is a contradiction.
Well, it's a sort of halfway house on the road to an-
thropomorphism.
Dh. That's bad.
But the dog might know it had a self and not know
that that self should be preserved. It would then be
rational to not wiggle. So if the dog still wiggles, this
would be instinctive. But if it learned to wiggle, then
it would not be instinctive.
Dh.
What would not be instinctive, Daddy? The learning or
the wiggling?
No-just the wiggling.
And the learning would be instinctive?
Well ••• yes. Unless the dog had to learn to learn.
Oh.
But, Daddy. what is instinct supposed to explain?
I keep trying to avoid that question. You see, instincts
were invented before anybody knew anything about
genetics, and most of modem genetics was discovered
before anybody knew anything about communication
theory. So it is doubly difficult to translate "instinct"
into modem terms and ideas.
D:
Yes, go on.
F:
Well, you know that in the chromosomes, there are
genes; and that the genes are some sort of messages
which have to do with how the organism develops and
with how it behaves.
.
D:
Is developing different from behaving, Daddy? What's
the difference? And which is learning? Is it "developing"
or "behaving?"
F:
Nol Nol Not so fast. Let's avoid those questions by
putting developing-learning-behavior all together in one
basket. A single spectrum of phenomena. Now let's try

scientists to stop trying to explain things at a ce
point. I guess it's usually a temporary agreement.
But that doesn't sound like a black box.
No-but that's what it's called. Things often don't s
like their names.
No.
It's a word that comes from the engineers. When th'
draw a diagram of a complicated machine, they use
sort of shorthand. Instead of drawing all the det .
they put a box to. stand for a whole bunch of parts an
label the box with what that bunch of parts is suppos
~&
.
So a "black box" is a label for what a bunch of thin
are supposed to do.•••
That's right. But it's not an explanation of how
bunch works.
And gravity?

Is a label for what gravity is supposed to do. It's not
an explanation of how it doesit.
.
Dh.
Daddy, what is an instinct?
.;
It's a label for what a certain black box is supposed to'!
do.
But what's it supposed to do?
Hm. That is a very difficult question •••
Goon.
Well. It's supposed to control-partly control-what an
organism does.
Do plants have instincts?
,
No. If a botanist used the word "instinct," when talking
about plants. he would be accused of zoomorphism.
Is that bad?
Yes. Very bad for botanists. For a botanist to be guilty
of zoomorphism is as bad as for a zoologist to be guilty
of anthropomorphism. Very bad. indeed.
Dh.! see.
D:
What did you mean by "partly control"?
F:
Well. IT an animal falls down a cliff, its falling is con-
trolled by gravity. But if it wiggles while falling, that .
might be due to instinct.

D:
But isn't instinct all on the behavior end of that "sp
trum"? And
~n't learning all determined by environ
ment and not chromosomes?
F:
Let's get this clear-that there is no behavior and nO"
anatomy and
I;l0 learning in the chromosomes them+
selves.
.
D:
Don't they have tl).eir own anatomy?
F:
Yes, of course. And their own physiology. But the
anatomy and physiology of the genes and chromosomes·:
is not the anatomy and physiology of the whole animal
D:
Of course not.
F:
But it is about the anatomy and physiology of the whole
animal.
D:
Anatomy about anatomy?
F:
Yes, just as letters and words have their own forms
and sbapes and those shapes are parts of words or sen-
tences and so on-which may be about anything.
D:
Oh.
D:
Daddy, is the anatomy of the genes and chromosomes
about the anatomy of the whole animal? And the phys-
iology of the genes and chromosomes about the phys-
iology of the whole animal?
F:
No, no. There is no reason to expect that. It's not like
that, Anatomy and physiology are not separate in that
way.
D:
Daddy, are you going to put anatomy and physiology
together in one basket, like you did developing-learn-
ing-behavior?
F:
Yes. Certainly.
D:
Ob.

D:
The same basket?
F:
Why not? I think developing is right in the middle of
that basket. Right smack in the middle.
D:
Oh.

If chromosomes and genes have anatomy and physiol-
ogy, they must have development.
Yes. That follows.
Do you think their development could be about the
development of the whole organism?
I don't even know what that question would mean.
I do. It means that the chromosomes and genes would
be changing or developing somehow while the baby is
developing, and the changes in the chromosomes would
be about the changes in the baby. Controlling them or
partly controlling them.
No. I don't think so.
Oh.
Do chromosomes learn?
I don't know.
They do sound rather like black boxes.
Yes, but if chromosomes or genes can learn, then they
are much more complicated black boxes than anybody
at present believes. Scientists are always assuming or
hoping that things are simple, and then discovering that
they are not.
D:
Yes, Daddy.
D:
Daddy, is that an instinct?
F:
Is what an instinct?
D:
Assuming that things are simple.
F:
No. Of course not. Scientists have to be taught to do
that.
D:
But I thought no organism could be taught to be wrong
e~ry time.
F:
Young lady, you are being disrespectful and wrong. In
the first place, scientists are not wrong every time they
assume that things are simple. Quite often they are
right or partly right and still more often, they think they
are right and tell each other so. And that is enough
reinforcement. And, anyhow you are wrong in saying
that no organism can be taught to be wrong every time.
D:
When people say that something is "instinctive," are
they trying to make things Simple?
Yes, indeed.

Do birds practice their songs?
Yes. Some birds are said to practice.
I guess instinct gives them the first part of singing, but
they have to work on the second part.
Perhaps.
Could practicing be instinctive?
I suppose it could be--but I am not sure what the
word "instinct" is coming to mean in this conversation.
It's an explanatory principle, Daddy, just like you said.
... There's one thing I don't understand.
Yes?
.
Is there a whole lot of instinct? Or are there lots of
instincts?
Yes. That's a good question, and scientists have talked
a great deal about it, making lists of separate instincts
and then lumping them together again.
But what's the answer?
Well. It's not quite clear. But one thing is certain:
That explanatory principles must be not multiplied be-
yond necessity.
D:
And 'that means? Please?
F:
It's the idea behind monotheism-that the idea of one
big God is to be preferred to the idea of two little
gods.
D:
Is God an explanatory principle?
F:
Oh, yes-a very big one. You shouldn't use two black
boxes-or two instincts-to explain what one black box
would explain ..•
D:
If it were big enough.
F:
No. It means .••
D:
Are there big instincts and little instincts?
F:
Well-as a matter of fact,scientists do talk as if there
were. But they call the little instincts by other names
-"reflexes," "innate releaSing mechanisms," "fixed ac-
tion patterns," and so on.
D:
I see--like having one big God to explain the universe
and lots of little "imps" or "goblins" to explain the small
things that happen.
F:
Well, yes. Rather like that.
D:
Are habits always twice learned?
F:
What do you mean?
D:
I mean-when I learn a set of chords on the guitar,
first I learn them or find them; and then later when I '.
practice, I get the habit of playing them that way. And
sometimes I get bad habits.
F:
Learning to be wrong every time?
,
D:
Oh-all right. But what about that
twice-ov~ busi-
ness? Would both parts of learning be not there if guitar
playing were instinctive?
F:
Yes. If both parts of learning were clearly not there,
scientists might say that guitar playing is instinctive.
D:
But what if only one part of learning was missing?
F:
Then, logically, the missing part could be explained by
"instinct."
D:
Could either part be missing?
F:
I don't know. I don't think anybody knows.
D:
Oh.
44
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
D:
And are they wrong?
F:
I don't know. It depends on what they mean.
D:
Oh.
D:
When do they do it?
c
F:
Yes, that's a better way of asking the question. They
do it when they see a creature do something, and they.
are sure: first, that the creature did not learn how to>
do that something and, second, that the creature is toQ',
stupid to understand why it should do that.
,
D:
Any other time?
F:
Yes. When they s,ee that all members of the species do
the same things under the same circumstances; andi:.
when they ,see the animal repeating the same action:
even when the circumstances are changed so that the-
action fails.
D:
So there are four ways of knowing that it's instinctive.
F:
No. Four conditions under which scientists talk about
instinct.
D:
But what if one condition isn't there? An instinct
sounds rather like a habit or a custom.
F:
But habits are learned.
D:
Yes.

But, Daddy, how do they lump things together to
the big instinct~?
F:
Well, for example, they don't say that the dog has
instinct which makes it wiggle when it falls down
cliff and another which makes it run away from
D:
You mean those would both be explained by as;
preservative instinct?
.
F:
Something like that. Yes.
D:
But if you put those different acts together under a
instinct, then you cannot get away from saying that
dog has the use of the notion of "self."
F:
No, perhaps not.
D:
What would you do about the instinct for the song a
the instinct for practiping the song?
F:
Well-depending on what the song is used for. B
song and practice might be under a territorial instin
or a sexual instinct.
D:
I wouldn't put them together.
F:
No?
D:
Because what if the bird also. practiced picking u·
seed or something? You'd have to multiply the instinc.
-what is it?-beyond necessity.
F:
What do you mean?
D:
I mean a food-getting instinct to explain the practicin
picking up seed, and a territory instinct for practicin .
song. Why not have a practicing instinct for both? Thq;
saves one black box.
F:
But then you would throwaway the idea of lumpin
together under the same instinct actions which hav:
the same purpose.
,
D:
Yes-because if the practicing is for a pilrpose-I me
if the bird has a purpose-then the practicing is ratio
and not instinctive. Didn't you say something like that
F:
Yes, I did say something like that.
D:
Could we do without the idea of "instinct"?
F:
How would you explain things then?
D:
Well. I'd just look at the little things: When some-
thing goes "pop," the dog jumps. When the ground is
not under his feet, he wiggles. And so on.
,-
F:
You mean-all the imps but no gods?
D:
Yes, something like that.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
47
Well. There are scientists who try to talk that way, .
and it's becoming quite fashionable. They say it is
more objective.
And is it?
Oh, yes.
What does "objective" mean?
.
Well. It means that you look very hard at those things
which you choose to look at.
That sounds right. But how do the objective people
choose which things they will be objective about?
Well. They choose those things about which it is easy
to be objective.
You mean easy for them?
Yes.
But how do they know that those are the easy things?
I suppose they try different things and find out by
experience.
So it's a subjective choice?
Ob, yes. All experience is subjective.
But it's human and subjective. They decide which bits
of animal behavior to be objective about by consulting
human subjective experience. Didn't you sa}' that an-
thropomorphis';ll is a bad thing?
Yes-but they do try to be not human.
Which things do they leave out?
What do you mean?
I mean--'--subjective experience shows them which things
it is easy to be objective about. So, they go and study
those things. But which things does their experience
show are difficult? So that they avoid those things.
Which are the things they avoid?
Well, you mentioned earlier something called "prac-
tice." That's a difficult thing to be objective about. And
there are other things that are difficult in the same sort
of way. Play, for example. And exploration. It's difficult
to be objective about whether a rat is really exploring or
really playing. So they don't investigate those things.
And then there's love. And, of course, hate.

D:
I see. Those are the sorts of things that I wanted
invent separate instincts for.
F:
Yes-those things. And don't forget humor.
D:
Daddy-are animals objective?
F:
I don't know-probably not. I don't think they are
sul;>jective either. I don't think they are split that way•.
D:
Isn't it true that people have a special difficulty about
being objective about the more animal parts of their
nature?
F:
I guess so. Anyhow Freud said so, and I think he was
right. Why do "you ask?
D:
Because, oh dear, those poor people. They try to' study
animals. And they specialize in those things that they
can study objectively. And they can only be objective
about those things in which they themselves are least
like animals. It must be difficult for them.
F:
No-that does not necessarily follow. It is still possible
for people to be objective about some things in their
animal nature. You haven't shown that the whole of
animal behavior is within the set of things that people
cannot be objective about.
D:
No?
D:
What are the really big differences between people
and animals?
F:
Well-intellect, language, tools. Things like that.
D:
And it is easy for people to be intellectually objective
in language and about tools?
.
F:
That's right.
D:
But that must mean that in people there is a. whole
set of ideas or whatnot which are all tied together.
A sort of second creature within the whole person, and
that second creature must have a quite different way of
thinking about everything. An objective way.
F:
Yes. The royal road to conscidUsness and objectivity is
through language and tools.
D:
But what happens when this creature looks at all those
parts of the person about which it is difficult for people
to be objective? Does it just look? Or does it meddle?
F:
It meddles.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
49
D:
And what happens?
F:
That's a very terrible question.
D:
Go on. H we are going to study animals, we must face
that question.
F:
Well ... The poets and artists Imow the answer better
than the scientists. Let me read you a piece:
Thought chang'd the infinite to a serpent, that which
pitieth
To a devouring flame; and man fled from its face and hid
In forests of night: then all the eternal forests were
divided
Into earths rolling in circles of space, that like an ocean
rush'd.
.And overwhelmed all except this finite wall of flesh.
Then was the serpent temple form'd, image of infinite
Shllt up in finite revolutions; and man became an Angel,
Heaven a mighty circle turning, God a tyrant crown'd.*
D:
I don't understand it. It sounds terrible, but what does
it mean?
F:
Well. It's not an objective statement, because it is taIk-
. ing about the effect of objectivity-what the poet calls
here "thought" upon the whole person or the whole of
life. «Thought" should remain a part of the whole but
instead spreads itself and meddles with the rest.
D:
Goon.
F:
Well. It slices everything to bits.
D:
I don't understand.
F:
Well, the first slice is between the objective thing and
the rest. And then inside the creature that's made in
the model of intellect, language, and tools, it is natural
that purpose will evolve. Tools are for purpOses and
anything which blocks purpose is a hindrance. The world
of the objective creature gets split into "helpful" things
and ''hindering'' things.
D:
Yes. I see that.
F:
AIl right.. Then the creature applies that split to the
world of the whole person, and "helpful" and ''hinder-

mean how are two dreams related to each
Do you
other?
No. Because, as you said, they are only bits and pieces.
What I mean is: How is a dream put together inside
itself? Could animal behavior be put together in the
same sort of way?
F:
I don't know where to begin.
0:
Well. Do dreams go by opposites?
F:
Oh Lordi The old folk idea. No. They don't predict
the future. Dreams are sort of suspended in time. They
don't have any tenses.
D:
But if a person is afraid of something which he knows
will happen tomorrow, he might dream about it to-
night?
F:
Certainly. Or about something in his past. Or about both
past and present. But· the dream contains no label to
tell him what it is "about" in this sense. It just is.
D:
Do you mean it's as if the dream had no title page?
F:
Yes. It's like an old manuscript or a letter that has lost
its beginning and end, and- the historian has to guess
what it's all about and who wrote it and when-from
what's inside it.
0:
Then we're going to have to be objective, too?
F:
Yes indeed. But we know that we have to be careful
about it. We have to watch that we don't force the
concepts of the creature that deals in language and
tools upon the dream material.
0:
How do you mean?
F:
Well. For example: if dreams somehow have not tenses
and are somehow suspended in time, then it would be
forcing the wrong sort of objectivity to say that a dream
"predicts" something. And·equally wrong to say it is a
statement about the past. It's not history.
D:
Only propaganda? .
F:
What do you mean?
D:
I mean-is it like the sort of stories that propagandists
write which they say are history but which are really
only fables?
F:
All right. Yes. Dreams are in many ways like myths
and fables. But not consciously made up by a propa-
gandist. Not planned.
D:
Daddy, we've talked about two ways of studying ani-
mals-the big instinct way and the S-R way, and
neither way seemed very sound. What do we do now?
F:
I don't know.

Didn't you say that the royal road to objectivity and
consciousness is language and tools? What's the royal
road to the other half?

What are dreams? How are they put together?
F:
Well-dreams are bits and pieces of the stuff of which
we are made. The non-objective stuff.
D:
But how are they put together?
F:
Look. Aren't we getting rather far from the question of
explaining animal behavior?
D:
I don't know, but I don't think so. It looks as if we
are going to be anthropomorphic in one way or another,
whatever we do. And it is obviously wrong to build
our anthropomorphism on that side of man's nature in
which he is most unlike the animals. So let's try the
other side. You say dreams are the royal road to the
other side. So .••

I didn't. Freud said it. Or something like it.

All right. But how are dreams put together?

53
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
Well, yes. As a matter of fact
they do
But I'm not
sure it's the same thing . ..'
.
Go on. How do they? And when?
Well. You know how a puppy lies on his back and
prese~ts his belly to a bigger dog. That's sort of inviting
the bIgger dog to attack. But it works in the opposite
way. It stops ~e bigger dog from attacking.
Yes. I see. It IS a sort of use of opposites. But do they
know that?
You mean does the big dog know that the little dog is
s~ying the opposite of what he means? And does the
little dog know that that is the way to stop the big dog?
Yes.
I don't know. I sometimes think the little dog knows
~ little more about it than the big dog. Anyhow, the
little dog does not give any signals to show that he
knows. He obViously couldn't do that.
Then it's ~ke th? ~eams. There's no label to say that
the dream IS dealing In opposites.
That's right.
I
think we're getting somewhere.
Dreams deal in
oPP?sites, and animals deal in opposites, and neither
carnes labels to say when they are dealing in opposites.
F:
Hmm.

But why are the labels missing? Is it for the same
reason in both animals and dreams?

deal in opposites.

And animals don't have language. It's perhaps part of
the wrong sort of objectivity.

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
D:
Does a dream always have a moral?
F:
I don't know about always. But often, yes. But the-
moral is not stated in the dream. The psychoanalyst
tries to get the patient to find the moral. Really the····
whole dream is the moral.
D:
What does that mean?
F:
I don't quite know.
D:
Well. Do dreams go by opposites? Is the moral the
opposite of what the dream seems to say?
F:
Oh yes. Often. Dreams often have an ironic or sar-
castic twist. A sort of reductio ad absurdum.
D:
For example? -
'
-
F:
All right. A friend of mine was a fighter pilot in World
War II. After the war he became a psychologist and
had to sit for his Ph. D. oral exam. He began to be
terrified of the oral, but, the night before the exam, he
had a nighbmire in which he experienced again being
in a plane Which had been shot down. Next day he
went into the examination without fear.
D:
Why?
F:
Because it was silly for a fighter pilot to be afraid of a
bunch of university professors who couldn't really shoot
him down.
D:
But how did he know that? The dream could have
been telling him that the professors would shoot him
down. How did he know it was ironic?
F:
Hmm. The answer is he didn't know. The dream doesn't
have a label on it to say it is ironic. And when people
are being ironic in waking conversation, they -often don't
tell you they are being ironic.
D:
No. That's true. I always think it's sort of cruel.
F:
Yes. It often is.

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
55
I doubt whether they would know. Certainly neither
animal knows it about the other. The dreamer doesn't
know at the beginning of the dream how the dream is
going to end.
'
Then it's a sort of experiment.•••
Yes.
So they might get into' a fight in order to find out
whether fighting was what they had to do.
Yes-but I'd rather put it less purposively-that the
fight shows them what sort of relationship they have,
after it. It's not planned.
Then "not" is really not there when the animals show
their fangs?
I guess not. Or often not. Perhaps old friends might
engage in playful fighting and know at the beginning
what they are doing.
D:
But, then, why does the dream leave out the "not"?
F:
I think really for a rather similar reason. Dreams are
mostly made of images and feelings, and if you are
going to communicate in images and feelings and such,
you again are governed by the fact that there is no
image for "not,"
D:
All right. Then the "not" is absent in animal behavior
because "not" is part of verbal language, and there can-
not be any action signal. for "not;" And because there
is no "not," the only way to agree on a negative is to
act out the whole reductio ad absurdum. You have to
act out the battle to prove it isn't one, and then you
have to' act out the submission to prove that the other
won't eat you.
Yes.
Did the animals have to think that out?
No. Because it's all necessarily true. And that which is
necessarily true will govern what you do regardless of
whether you know that it is necessarily true. If you put
two apples with three apples you will get five apples-
even though you cannot count. It's another way of "ex-
plaining" things.

That still has a tense in it. But never mind. If the anunal
is not biting the' other, he's not biting it, and that's it.
But he might be not doing all sorts of other things,
sleeping, eating, running, and so on. How can he say,
"It's biting that I'm not doing"?
He can only do that if biting has somehow been men-
tioned.
Do you mean that he could say, ''I am not,biting you"
by first showing his fangs and then not biting?
Yes. Something like that.

But what about two animals? They'd both have to show
their fangs.

D:
But you could dream of a "Stop" sign with a lin
through it, which would mean "No Stopping."
:
F:
Yes. But that's halfway toward language. And the delet-;
ing line isn't the word "not." It's the word "don't,"-'
"Don't"
can be conveyed in action language-if the'
other person makes a move to mention what you want to"

"not" might be among them. But I doubt if you Can '
dream a "not" which is about the dream. I mean a.
"not" which means "This dream is not to be taken lit-
erally." Sometimes, in very light sleep, one knows that -
one is dreaming.
'
D:
But, Daddy, you still haven't answered the question
about how dreams are put together.
F:
I think really I have answered it. But let me try again.
A dream is a metaphor ora tangle of metaphors. Do you
know what a metaphor is?
D:
Yes. H I say you are like a pig that is a simile. But if-
I say you are a pig, that is a metaphor.
F:
Approximately, yes. When a metaphor is labeled as
metaphor it becomes a simile.
D:
And it's that labeling that a dream leaves out.
F:
That's right. A metaphor compares things Without spell-
ing out the comparison. It takes what is true of one
group of things and applies it to another. When we say
a nation "decays," we are using a metaphor, suggesting
that some changes in a nation are like changes which
bacteria produce in fruit. But we don't stop to mention
the fruit or the bacteria.
D:
And a dream is like that?
F:
No. It's the other way around. The dream would men-
tion the fruit and possibly the bacteria but would not
mention the nation. The dream elaborates on the re-
lationship but does not identify the things that are re-
lated.
D:
Daddy, could you make a dream for me?
F:
You mean, on this recipe? No. Let's take the piece of
verse which I read you just now and turn it into a,
dream. It's almost dream material the way it stands.,
For most of it, you have only to substitute images for
the words. And the words are vivid enough. But the,

of them pegs the metaphors down. But what I don't
c
understand is-why, when the animals do these things,
it makes sense. I mean for them· to work in op.posites.
And they don't have to peg down their metaphors-but
I don't see why dreams should be like that, too.
F:
Nor do I.
D:
And there's another thing.
F:
Yes?
D:
You talked about genes and chromosomes
carrying
messages about development. Do they talk like animals
and dreams? I mean in metaphors and with no "nots"?
Or do they talk like us?
F:
I don't know. But I am sure their message system con-
tains no simple transform of Instinct Theory.
Part II: Form and Pattern
in Anthropology

Culture Contact and Schismoqenesis*
The Memorandum written by a Committee of the Social
Sciences Research Council (Man, 1935, 162) has stimulated
me to put forward a point of view which differs considerably
from theirs; and, though the beginning of this article may
appear to he critical of their Memorandum, I wish to make
it clear from the outset that I regard as a real conbibution
any serious attempt to devise categories for the study of cul-
ture contact. Moreover, since there are several passages in
the Memorandum (among them the Definition) which I do
not perfectly understand, my criticisms are offered with some
hesitation, and are directed not so much against the Com-
mittee as against' certain errors prevalent among anthropolo-
gists.
(1) The uses of such systems of categories. In general
it is unwise to construct systems of this sort until the prob-
lems which they are designed to elucidate have been clearly
formulated; and so far as· I can see; the categories drawn
up by.the Committee have been constructed not in reference
to any specifically defined problems, but to throw a general

function which overtops the rest, leads by extension to the
idea that a culture can be subdivided into "institutions"
where the bundle of traits which make up one institution
are alike in their major functions. The weakness of this meth-
od of subdividing a culture has been conclUSively demon-
strated by Malinowski and his pupils, who have shown that
almost the whole of a culture may be seen variously as a
mechanism for modifying and satisfying the sexual needs of
the individuals, or for the enforcement of the norms of be-
havior, or for supplying the individuals with food. 2 From this
exhaustive demonstration we must expect that any single trait
of a culture will prove on examination to be not simply eco-
nomic or religious or structural, but to partake of all these
qualities according to the point of view from which we look
• Cf. Malinowski, Sexual Life and Crime and Custom;
A. I. Richards, Hunger and Work. This question of the
subdivision of a culture into "institutions" is not quite
as simple as I have indicated; and, in spite of their own
works, I believe that the London School still adheres
to a theory that some such division is practicable. It is
likely that confusion arises from the fact that certain
native peoples-perhaps all, but in any case those of
Western Europe-actually think that their culture is so
subdivided. Various cultural phenomena also contribute
something toward such a subdivision,
e.g.,
(a)
the
division of labor and differentiation of norms of be-
havior between different groupS of individuals in the
same community, and (b) an emphasis, present in certain
cultures, upon the subdivisions of place and time upon
which behavior is ordered. These phenomena lead to
the possibility, in suc/1 cultures, of dubbing all behavior
which, for example, takes place in church between
11.30 and 12.30 on Sundays as "religious." But even in
the study of such cultures the anthropologist must look
with some suspicion upon his classification of traits into
institutions and must expect to find a great deal of over-
lapping between various institutions.
An analogous fallacy occurs in psychology, and con-
sists in regarding behavior as classifiable according to
the impulses which inspire it, e.g., into such categories
as self-protective, assertive, sexual, acquisitive, etc. Here,
too, confusion results from the fact that not only the
psychologist, but also the individual studied, is prone to
think in terms of these categories. The psychologists
would do well to accept the probability that every bit
of behavior is-at least in a well-integrated individual
--8imultaneously relevant to all these abstractions.
62
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
light on "the problem" of acculturation, while the problem _
itself remains vague.
(2) From this it follows that our immedia!e nee~ is n?t
so much the construction of a set of categorIes which will
throw a light on all the problems, but rather the schematic
formulation of the problems in such a way that they may
be separately investigable.
(3) Although the Committee leave their problems un-
defined, we may from a careful reading. of the
catego~ies
gather roughly what questions they are asking of the matenal.
It seems that the Committee have, as a matter of fact, been
influenced by the _sort of questions which adminis~ators ask
of anthropologists-"Is it a good thing to use force m culture
contacts?" "How can we make a given people accept a cer-
tain sort of trait?" and so on. In response to this type of
question we find in the definition of acculturation ~n empha-
sis upon difference in culture between the .groups ~ contact
and upon the resulting changes; and such dlChotomles as that
_.
between "elements forced upon a people or received volw:"-
tarily by them"! may likewise be regarded as symptomatic
of this thinking in terms of administrative
probl~s. The
same may be said of the categories V, A, B, and C,
accep-
tance " "adaptation" and "reaction."
(4) We may agr~ that answers are badly needed to these
questions of administration and, further, that a s~dr of cul-
ture contacts is likely to give these answers. But It IS almost
certain that the scientific formulation of the problems of ~n­
tact will not follow these lines. It is as if in the constructi.on
of categories for the study of criminology we
starte~.~I~
a dichotomy of individuals into criminal and ~noncnmmal
-and indeed that curious science was hampered for a long
while by this ~ery attempt to define a "criminal type."
(5) The Memorandum is based upon a fallacy: t?at we
can classify the traits of a culture under such headings as
economic, religious, etc. We are asked, for ex~ple, to clas-
sify traits into three classes, presented respectively be.earu:e
of: (a) economic profit or political dominance; (b) desrrabil:
ity of bringing about conformity t.o val?es of d.on?r group,
and (c) ethical and religious conSiderations. This Idea, that _
each trait has either a single function or at least some one_
1 In any case it is clear that in a scientific study

can have no place.

64
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
at it. H this be true of a culture seen in synchronic section,
then it must also apply to the diachronic processes of culture
contact and change; and we must expect that for the offering,
acceptance or refusal of every trait that are simultaneous
causes of an economic,
structural, sexual,
and religious
nature.
(6) From this it follows that our categories "religious,"
"economic," etc., are not real subdivisions which are present
in the cultures which we study, but are merely abstractions
which we make for our own convenience when we set out
to describe cultures in words. They are not phenomena pres-
ent in culture, but are labels for various points of view which
we adopt in our studies. In handling such abstractions we
must be careful to avoid Whitehead's "fallacy of misplaced
concreteness," a fallacy into which, for example, the Marxian
historians fall when they maintain that economic "phe-
nomena" are "primary."
With this preamble, we may now consider an alternative
scheme for the study of contact phenomena.
(7) Scope of the inquiry
I suggest that we should con-
sider under the head of "culture contact" not only those cases
in which the contact occurs between two communities with
different cultures and results in profound disturbance of the
culture of one or both groups; but also cases of contact within
a single community. In these cases the contact is between
differentiated groups of individuals, e.g., between the sexes,
between old and young, between aristocracy and plebs, be-
tween clans, etc., groups which live together in approximate
equilibrium. I would even extend the idea of "contact" so
Widely as to include those processes whereby a- child is
molded and trained to fit the culture into which he was born,S
but for the present we may confine ourselves to contacts be-
tween groups of individuals, with different cultural norms of
behavior in each group.
(8)
H we consider the possible end of the drastic distur-
I The present scheme is oriented toward the study of
social rather than psychological processes, but a closely
analogous scheme might be constructed for the study of
psychopathology. Here the idea of "contact" would be
studied, especially in the contexts of the molding of the
individual, and the processes of schismogenesis would
be seen to play an important part not only in accentuat-
ing the maladjustments of the deviant, but also in as-
similating the normal individual to his group.

bances ~?ich follow contacts between profoundly different
commuruties, we see that the changes must theoretically re-
sult in one or other of the following patterns:
(a) the complete fusion of the originally different groups
(b) the elimination of one or both groups
(c) the persistence of both groups in dynamic equilibrium
within one major community
(9) My purpose in extending the idea of contact to cover
the con~tions of differentiation inside a single culture is to
use our knowledge of these quiescent states to throw light
upon the factors which are at work in states of disequilibrium.
It may be easy to obtain a knowledge of the factors from
their ~uiet working, but impOSSible to isolate them when they
are
~olent. The laws of gravity ,cannot conveniently be
studied by observation of houses collapSing in an earth-,
quake.
(10) Complete fusion
Since this is one of the pOSSible
~nds of the process we must know what factors are present
10 a group of individuals with consistent homogeneous pat-
terns of behavior in all members of the group. An approach
~o .such conditions may be found in any cOmmunity which
IS 10 a state of approximate equilibrium but, unfortunately,
our own communities in Europe are in a state of such flux
~at these c0Il;~tions scarcely occur. Moreover, even in prim-
I~ve con.un.unlties the conditions are usually complicated by
differentIation, so that we must be content with studies of
such homogeneous groups as can be observed within the
major differentiated communities.
.O~ first task will ,be to ascertain what sorts of unity obtain
WIthin such groups, or rather-bearing in mind that we are
concerned with aspects and not classes of phenomena-what
aspects of the unity of the body of traits we must describe
in order to get a whole view of th~ situation. I submit that
the material, to be fully understood, must be examined in,
at least, the following five separable aspects:
(a) A structural aspect of unity The behavior of anyone
individual in anyone context is, in some sense, cognitively
consistent V'(ith the behavior of all the other individuals in
all other contexts. Here we must be prepared to find that
the inherent logic of one culture differs profoundly from that
of others. From this point of view we shall see, for example,
that when individual A gives a drink to individual B, that

66
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
behavior is consistent with other norms of behavior obtaining
within the group which contains A arid B.
This aspect of the unity of the body of behavior patterns
may be restated in terms of a standardization of the cognitive
aspects of the personalities of the individuals. We may say
that the patterns of thought of the individuals are so stan-
dardized that their behavior appears to them logical.
(b) Affective aspects of unity In studying the culture
from this point of view, we are concerned to show the emo-
tional setting of all the details of behavior. We shall see the
whole body of behavior as a concerted mechanism oriented
toward affective satisfaction and dissatisfaction of the indi-
viduals.
This aspect of a culture may· also be described in terms
of a standardization of affective aspects of the personalities
of the individuals, which are so modified by their culture
that their behavior is to them emotionally consistent.
(c) Economic unity Here we shall see the whole body
of behavior as a mechanism oriented toward the production
and distribution of material objects.
(d) Chronological and spatial unity
Her~ we shall see
the behavior patterns as schematically ordered according to
time and place. We shall see A as giving the drink to B
"because it is Saturday evening in the Blue Boar."
(e) Sociological unity Here we shall see the behavior of
the individuals as oriented toward the integration and disin-
tegration of the major unit, the Group as a whole. We shall
see the giving of drinks as a factor which promotes the soli-
darity of the group.
(U) In addition to studying the behavior of members of
the homogeneous group from all these points of view, we
must examine a number of such groups to discover the effects
of standardization of these various points of view in the .peo-
pIe we are studying; We have stated above that every bit
of behavior must be regarded as probably relevant to all these
viewpoints, but the fact remains that some peoples are more
inclined than others to see and phrase their own behavior
as '10gical" or "for the good of the State."
(12) With this knowledge of the conditions which obtain
in homogeneous groups, we shall be in a position to examine
the processes of fUsion of two diverse groups into one. We
may even be able to presCribe measures which will either .
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
67
promote or retard such fusion, and predict that a trait which
fits the five aspects of unity can be added to a culture with-
out other changes. If it does not fit, then we can· search for
appropriate modifications either of the culture or of the trait.
(13) The elimination of one 01' both groups This end re-
sult is perhaps scarcely worth studying, but we should at
least examine any material that is available, to determine
what sort of effects such hostile activity has upon the culture
of the survivors. It is possi~le, for example, that the patterns
of beh~~or ass~ciated ~th elimination of other groups may
be assmulated mto thell' culture so that they are impelled
to eliminate more and more.
(14) Persistence of both groups in dynamic eqUilibrium
This is probably the most instructive of the poSSible end
results of contact, since the factors active in the dynamic
equilibrium are likely to be identical or analogous with those
which, in disequilibrium, are active in cultural change. Our
first task·is to study the relationships obtaining between
groups of individuals with differentiated behavior patterns,
and later to consider what light these relationships throw
upon what are more usually called "contacts," Every anthro-
pologist who has been in the field has had opportunity of
studying such differentiated groups.
(15) The possibilities of differentiation of groups are by
no means infinite, but fall clearly into two categories (a)
cases in which the relationship is chiefly symmetrical, e.g.,
~ the differentiation of moieties, clans, villages and the na-
tions of Europe; and (b) cases in which the relationship is
complementary, e.g., in the differentiation of social strata,
classes,· castes, age grades, and, in some cases
the cultural
differentiation between the sexes.' Both these'types of dif-

first task is to decide which of the end results outlined in
paragraph 8 is desirable and possible of attainment. This de-
cision he must make without hypocrisy. If he chooses fusion,
then he must endeavor to contrive every step so as to promote
the conditions of consistency which are outlined (as prob-
lems for investigation) in paragraph 10. If he chooses that
both groups shall persist in some form of dynamic equilib-
rium, then he must contrive to establish a system in which
the possibilities of schismogenesis are properly compensated
or balanced against each other. But at every step in the
scheme which I have outlined there are problems which must
be studied by trained students and which when, solved will
contribute, not only to applied sociology, but to the very basis
of our understanding of human beings in society.

takin~ place against the use of loose analOgies,
espeCIally against the Spencerian analogy between the Or-
g~ an~ Society. Thanks to this mystical belief in the per-
vading umty of the phenomena of the world, I avoided a
gr~at deal of intellectual waste. I never had any doubt that
this analogy was fundamentally sound; since to doubt would
have' been emotionally expensive. Nowadays, of course, the
emphasis has shifted. Few would seriously doubt that the
ways of analysis which have been found useful in analyzing
one complex functioning system are likely to be of use in
analyzing any other similar system. But the mystical prop
was useful then, though its phraSing was bad.
There is another way, too, in which that mysticism has
helped-a way which is especially relevant to my thesis. I
want to emphasize that whenever we pride ourselves upon
finding a newer, stricter way of thought or exposition; when-
eve~ we s.tart insisting too hard upon "operationalism" or sym-
bolic lOgIC or any other of these very essential systems of
tramlines, we lose something of the ability to think new
thoughts. And equally, of course, whenever we rebel against
the sterile rigidity of formal thought and exposition and let
our ideas run wild, we likewise lose. As I see it, the advances
in scientific thought come from a combination of loose and
strict thinking. and this combination is the most precious tool
of science.
.
M~ mystical view of phenomena contributed specifically
to bwld up this double habit of mind-it led me into wild
"hunches" and, at the same time, .compelled more formal
thinking about those hunches. It encouraged looseness of
thought and then immediately insisted that that looseness be
measured up against a rigid concreteness. The point is that
the first hunch from analogy is wild, and then, the moment
I be~ to work

the rIgId formulatiOns which have been devised in the field
from which I borrow the analogy.
Perhaps it is worth giving an example of this; it was a
matter of formulating the social organization of a New

and perhaps especially from the overtones of his talk. J.Ie
himself was inarticulate about philosophy and mathem.atics
and logic, and he was articulately ~strustful of such subjects,
but still, in spite of himself, I think, he passed on to me
something of these matters.
The attitudes which I got from him were especially th?se
which he had denied in himself. In his early-and as I ~ink
he knew-his best work he posed the problems of aromal
symmetry segmentation, serial repetition of parts,
patt~rns,
etc. Late; he turned away from this field into Mendelism,
to which he devoted the remainder of his life. But he had
always a hankering after the problems of patt~rn and ~­
metry and it was this hankering and the mysticism that m-
spired it that I picked up and which, for better or worse,
I called "science."
I picked up a vague mystical feeling that we must look
for the same sort of processes in all fields of natural phenom-
ena-that we might expect to find the same sort of laws at
work in the structure of a crystal as in the structure of so-
ciety, or that the segmentation of an ea.;thworm mi~ht really
be comparable to the process by' which basalt pillars are
formed.

I should not preach this mystical faith in qUite those terms
today but would say rather that I. believe ~at the types of
mental operation which are useful m analyzmg one field may
be equally useful in another-that the framework
(the
eidos) of science rather than the framework of Nature, is
the same in all fields. But the more mystical phrasing of
the matter was what I vaguely learnt,and it was of. p~a­
mount importance. It lent a certain dignity to ~ny sCIentific
investigation, implying that when I was analyzmg the pat-
terns of partridges' feathers, I might really get an answer or a
bit of an answer to the whole puzzling bus~ess of pa.tt~rn
and regularity in nature. And further, this bIt of mysti~m
was important because it gave me freedom to use my sCIen-
tific background, the ways of thought that.I had. picked up in
biology and eJementary physics and chemIStry;, It encour~ged
me to expect these ways of thought to fit in WIth very differ-
ent fields of observation. It enabled me to regard all my,.,
training as potentially useful rather than utterly irrelevant to l
anthropology.

schismatic (a following after other leaders without change of
dogma).
You will note that here I overrode my analogy at one
point and that this matter is still not perfectly clear. When a
transverse fission or a lateral budding occurs in a trans-
versely segmented animal, the products of that bud or fission
are identical, the posterior half which was held in·check by
the anterior is relieved of this control and develops into a
normal, complete animal. I am therefore not in step with
my analogy when I regard the differentiation which accom-
panies fission in a hierarchical society as comparable with
that which exists before fission in a transversely segmented
animal. This divergence from the analogy will surely be
worth investigation; it will take us into a more precise study
of the asymmetrical relations which obtain between the units
in the two cases and raise questions about the reactions of
the subordinate member to its position in the asymmetry.
This aspect of the matter I ,have not yet examined.
Having got some sort of conceptual frame within which to
describe the interrelations between clans, I went on from
this to consider the interrelations between the various age
grades in terms of this same frame. Here, if anywhere, where
age might be expected to provide a basis for serial differen-
tiation, we ought to expect to find some analogue of the
transverse segmentation with asymmetrical relations between
the successive grades-and to a certain extent the age-grade
system fitted this picture. Each grade has its ceremonies and
its secrets of initiation into that grade; and in these ce.re-
monies and secrets it was
perfec~ly easy to trace a met-
americ differentiation. Ceremonies which are folly devel-
oped at the top of the system are still recognizable in their
basic form in the lower levels-but more rudimentary at
each level as we go down the series.
But the initiatory system contains one very interesting ele-
ment which was brought into sharp relief when my point of
view was defined in terms of animal segmentation. The
grades alternate, so that the whole system consists of two
opposed groups, one group made up of grades 3, 5, 7, etc.
(the odd numbers), and the other made up of 2, 4, 6, etc.;
and these two groups maintain the type of relationship which
I had already described as "symmetrical"-each providing
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
79
sanctions by quarreling with the other when their rights are
infringed.
Thus even where we might expect the most definite hier-
archy, the Iatmul have substituted for it a headless system
in which one side is symmetrically opposed to the other.
From this conclusion my enquiry, influenced by many
other types of material, will go on to look at the matter from
other points of view-especially the psychological problems
of w?ether a. pref~rence for.symmetrical rather than asym-
metrical relationshIps can be unplanted in the individual, and
what t!he mechanisms of such character formation may be.
But we need not go into that now.
Enough has been said to bring 'out the methodological
theme-that a vague "hunch" derived from
some other
science leads into the precise formulations of that other
science in terms of which it is possible to think more fruit-
fully about our own material.
You will have noticed that the form in whi~ I used the
biological findings was really rather different from that in
which a zoologist would talk about his material. Where the
zoologist might talk of axial gradients, I talked about "asym-
metrical relationships between successive segments," and in
my phrasing I was prepared to attach to the word "suc-
cessive" two simultaneous meanings-in referring to the ani-
mal material it meant a morphological series in a three-
dimensional concrete organism, while in referring to the
anthropological material the word "successive" meant some
abstracted property of a hjerarchy.
I think it would be fair to say that I use the analogies in
so~e curiously abstract form-that, as for "axial gradients" I
substitute "asymmetrical relationships," so also I endow the
word "successive" with some abstract meaning which makes
it applicable to both sorts of cases.
This brings us to another very important motif in my think-
ing-a habit of constructing abstractions which refer to terms
of comparison between entities; and to illustrate this I can
clearly remember the first occasion on which I was guilty of
such an abstraction. It was in my Zoological Tripos examina-
tion at Cambridge, and the examiner had trIed to compel me
to answer at least one question gn each branch of the subject.
Comparative anatomy I had always regarded as a waste of
time, but I found myself face to face with·it in the exami-

80
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
nation and had not the necessary. detailed knowledge. I was
asked to compare the urinogenital system of the amphibia
with that of the mammalia, and I did not know much about it,
Necessity was the mother of invention. I decided that I
ought to be able to defend the position that comparative
anatomy was a muddled waste of time, and so I set to work
to attack the whole emphasis on homology in zoological the-
ory. As you probably will know, zoologists conventionally
deal in two sorts of comparability between organs-homology
and analogy. Organs are said to be "homologous" when it can
be shown that they have similar structure or bear similar
structural relations to other organs, e.g., the trunk of the
elephant is homologous with the nose and lip of a man be-
cause it has the same formal relation to other parts--eyes,
etc.; but the trunk of an elephant is analogous to the hand
of a man because both have the same uses. Fifteen years
ago comparative anatomy revolved endlessly around these
two sorts of comparability, which incidentally are good ex-
amples of what I mean by "abstractions which define the
terms of a comparison between entities."
My attack on the system was to suggest that there might
be other sorts of comparability and that these would con-
fuse the issue to such a degree that mere morpholOgical
analysis would not suffice. I argued that the bilateral fins
of a fish would conventionally be regarded as homologous
with the bilateral limbs of a mammal, but that the tail of a
fish, a median organ, would conventionally be regarded a
"different from" or at most only "analogous to" the fins. But
what about the double-tailed Japanese goldfish? In this ani-
mal the factors causing an anomaly of the tail alsq cause the
same anomaly in the bilateral fins; therefore there was here
another sort of comparability, an equivalence in terms of pro-
cesses and laws of growth. Well, I don't bow what mark I
got for my answer. I found out much later that, as a matter
of fact, the lateral fins of the goldfish are scarcely, if at all,
affected by the factors which cause the anomaly in the tail,
but I doubt if the examiner caught me in my bluff; and I
found also that, curiously, Haekel in 1854 had actually
coined the word "homonomy" for the very type of equiva-
lence that I was inventing. The word is, so far as I bow,
obsolete, and was obsolete when.1 wrote my answer.
So far as I was concerned, however, the idea was new
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
81
and I had thought of it myseH. I felt that i had discovered
how to think. That was in 1926, and this same old clue-
recipe, if you like-has remained with me ever since. I did
not realize that I had a recipe; and it was not until ten years
later that I fully grasped the significance of this analogy-
homology-homonomy business.
~erhaps it will ~e of interest to recount in some detail my
vanous brushes WIth these concepts and the recipe which
they contained. Soon after the examination to which I have
referred, I went into anthropology and for some time stopped
thinking-wondering rather what could be made of this
subject, but not getting anything clear except a repudiation
of most of the conventional approaches which, to me, seemed
~eaningless. I wr~te a little skit on the concept of totemism
m 1930, first prOVIng that the totemism of the Iatmul is true
totemism because it contains a "high percentage" of charac-
teristics of totemism listed in "Notes and Queries on Anthro-
pology" issued more or less ex cathedra by the Royal
AnthropolOgical I~titute, and then going on to the question,
what sort of eqUIvalence we thought we were referring to
when we equate some bits of IatmUl cUlture with the totem-
ism of North America, and dragging in homology-homon-
omy, etc.
In this discussion of "true" totemism I still had the homon-
omy~homology abstractions perfectly clear and was using the
concepts with a clean (though inarticulate) understanding
of what sort of abstractions they were-but it is interesting
that I afterwards made some other comparable abstractions
for the analysis of latmUl material and muddled the issues
through forgetting this very thing.
" I ~as especially interested in studying what I called the
feel
of culture, and I was bored with the conventional
study of the more formal detaiIs. I went out to New Guinea
with that much vaguely cIear-and in one of my first letters
home I complained of the hopelessness of putting any sort
~f s8;!t on the tail of such an imponderable concept as the
fe~l
of cul~e. I had .b~en watching a casual group of
natives chewmg betel, Spitting, laughing, joking, etc., and I
felt acutely the tantalizing impossibility of what I wanted to
do.
A year later,still in New Guinea, I read Arabia Deserta
and recognized with a· thrill that Doughty had in a sense

"ethos," and you must excuse me if I have gathered moral
support for this confession by a digression to show that at
any rate others have committed the same crime.
Let us examine the stages by which I got into the fallacy
and the way in which I got out of it. I thirlk the first step
toward an escape from sin was to multiply offenses-and
there is a good deal to be said for this method. Vice is
after all a dull business whether it be physical or intellectual,
and an effective cure can sometimes be achieved by in-
dulgence to the point at which the patient realizes this. It
is a way of proving that a. given line of thought or conduct
will not do, by experimentally extrapolating it to infinity,
when its absurdities become evident.
I multiplied my offenses by creating several more con-
cepts of about the same degree of abstraction as "ethos"-
I had "eidos," "cultural structure," "sociology"-and all these
I handled as though they were concrete entities. I pictured
the relations between ethos and cultural structure as being
like the relation between a river and its banks-"The river
molds the banks and the banks guide the river. Similarly, the
ethos molds the cultural structure and is guided by it." I was
still looking for physical analogies, but now the position was
not quite the same as when I was looking for analogies in
order to get concepts which I could use in analyzing ob-
served material. I was looking now for physical analogies
which I could use in analyzing my own concepts, and that
is a very much less satisfactory business. I do not mean, of
course, that the other sciences can give one no help in the
attempt to straighten out one's thoughts; they surely can.
For example, the theory of Dimensions in physics may be of
enormous help in this field. What I mean is that when one
is seeking an analogy for the elucidation of material of one
sort, it is good to look at the way analogous material has
been analyzed. But when one is seeking an elucidation of
one's own concepts, then one must look for analogies on an
equally' abstract level. However, these similes about rivers
and their banks seemed pretty to me and I treated them
quite seriously.
Here I must digress for a moment to describe a trick of
thought and speech, which I have found useful. When I am
faced with a vague concept and feel that the time is not yet
ripe to bring that concept into strict expression, I coin some

of the culture; I was interested in a sCientific analysIS of It.
i
On the whole I think that Doughty was an encouragement
-to me, and. the greatest encouragement I got from him was
due to a fallacious bit of thinking which he prompted. It
appe~red to me that it was
impossi~"e
t~
under~tand the
behavior of his Arabs apart from the
feel
of their culture,
and from this it seemed to follow that the "feel" of the culture
was in some way causative in shaping native beha,?-or. This
encouraged me to go on thinking that I was trying. after
something that was important-so far so good. But It also
guided me into regarding the "feel" of the culture as much
more concrete and causally active than I had any right to do.
This false concreteness was reinforced later by an acci-
dent of language. Radcliffe-Brown called to my attention the
old word "ethos" and told me that that .was what I was
trying to study. Words are dangerous things, and it so hap"
pens that "ethos" is in some ways a very bad word. If I
had been compelled to make up my own word for what I
wanted to say, I might have done better and saved myself a
great deal of confusion. I would, I hope, have put forward
something like "ethonomy," which would have remindecl me
that I was referring to an abstraction of the same order as
homology or homonomy. The trouble with the word "e~os"
is just this-that it is too short. It is a unit word, a .sID?le
Greek substantive, and as such helped me to go on. thinking
that it referred to a unit something which I could still regard
as causative. I handled the word as if it were a category of
behavior or a sort of factor which shaped behavior.
We are all familiar with this loose use of words in such
phrases as: "the causes of war are economic," "economic'
behavior" "he was influenced by his emotions," ''his symp-
toms ar; the result of conflict between his superego and his
id." (I am not sure how many of these fallacies are contained
in that last example; at a rough count, there seem to be five
with a possible sixth, but there may be more. Psychoanalysis
has erred sadly in using words that are too short and there- "
fore appear more concrete than they are.) I was guilty of
just this sort of shoddy thinking in my handling of the word

contain some attempt to discriminate between the sort of
thing that I called "ethos" and the sort of thing that I
called "eidos," etc.
I was in a state approximating that panic in the examina-
tion room which formerly produced the concept of homon-
amy. I was due to sail for my next field trip-my book had
to be finished before I sailed-the book could not stand
without some clear statement about the interrelations of
these concepts of mine.
Here I will quote what finally appeared in the book in
this last chapter:
,
"I began to doubt the validity of my own categories, and
pedormed an experiment. I chose three bits of culture: (a)
a wau (mother's brother) giving food to a woo (sister's
son); a pragmatic bit,
(b)
a man scolding his wife; an
ethological bit, and (0) a man marrying his father's sister's
daughter; a structural bit. Then I drew a lattice of nine
squares on a large piece of paper, three rows of squares with
three squares in each row. I labeled the horizontal rows
with my bits of culture and the vertical columns with my
categories. Then I forced myself to see each bit as con-
ceivably belonging to each category. I found that it' could
be done.
"I found that I could think of each bit of culture struc-
turally; I could see it as in accordance with a ,consistent set
of rules or formulations; Equally, I could see each bit as
'pragmatic,' either as satisfying the needs of individuals or
as contributing to the integration of society. Again, I could
see each bit ethologically, as an expression of emotion.
"This experiment may seem puerile, but to me it was very
.... important, and I have recounted it at length because there
may be some among my readers who tend to regard such
concepts as 'structure' as concrete parts which 'interact' in
culture, and who find, as I did, a difficulty in thinking of
these concepts as labels merely for points of view adopted
either by the scientist or by the natives. It is instructive to
perform the same experiment with such concepts as eco-
nomics, etc."2
In fact, "ethos" and the rest were finally reduced to ab-
stractions of the same general order as "homology," ''homon-

loose expression for referring to this concept and do not
want to prejudge the issue by giving the concept too mean-
~~
ingful a term. I therefore dub it hastily with some brief con-
'"
crete colloquial term-generally Anglo-Saxon rather than Lat-
in-I will speak of the "stuff" of culture, or ''bits'' of culture,
or the "feel" of culture. These brief Anglo-Saxon terms have
for me a definite feeling-tone which reminds me all the time
that the concepts behind them are vague and await ~alysis.
It is a hick like tying a knot in a handkerchief-but has the
advantage that it still permits me, if I may so express it, to
go on using the handkerchief for other purposes. I can go

I
But these similes' about ethos being the river and the
formulations of culture or "cultural structure" being its banks
were not Anglo-Saxon reminders that I was leaving some-
thing for analysis at a later date. They were, as 1 thought,
the real thing-a real contribution to our understanding ()f
how culture works. 1 thought that there was one sort of
phenomenon which I could call "ethos" and another sort
which 1 could call "cultural structure" and that these two
worked together........;had mutual effect one on the other. All
that remained for me to do was to discriminate clearly be-
tween these various sorts of phenomena so that other people
could pedorm the same sort of analysis that I was doing.
This effort of discrimination 1 postponed, feeling perhaps
that the problem was not quite ripe-and i went on with the
cultural analysis. And did what I still think was good work. I
want to emphasize this last point-that, as a matter of fact,
considerable contnbutions to science can be made with very .
blunt and crooked concepts. We may joke about the way {
misplaced concreteness abounds in every word of psycho-'
analytic writing-but in spite of all the muddled thinking.,
that Freud started, psychoanalysis remains as the outstanding
conhibution, almost the only contribution to our understand..
ing of the family-a monument to the importance and value
of loose thinking.

adopted by the investigator. I was, as you may lDlagme,
enormously excited at getting this tangle straightened out-
but I was also worried because I thought I should be com-
pelled to reWrite the whole book. But I found that this was

warni~g the reader that,
these passages might be taken as a warnmg of how not to
say things-and so on. But the body of the boo~ was sound
enough-all that it needed was new castors on Its legs.
So far I have spoken of my own personal experiences w;ith
strict and loose thinking, but I think actually the story whICh
I have narrated is typical of the whole fluctuating business
of the advance of science. In my case, which is a small one
and comparatively insignificant in the whole advance of
science, you can see both elements of the alternating pro-
cess-first the loose thinking and the building up of a. struc-
ture on unsound foundations and then the correctipn to
stricter thinking and the substitution of a new underpinning
beneath the already constructed mass. And that, I believe,
is a pretty fair picture of how. scie~ce advances, with. ~
exception, that usually the edifice
IS larger
.an~ the m~­
viduals who finally contribute the new underpmnmg are dif-
ferent people from those who did the initial loose thinking.
Sometimes, as in physiCS, we find centuries between the :first
building of the edifice and the later correction of the founda-
tions-but the process is basically the same.
And if you ask me for a recipe for speeding up this
process, I would say :first that we ought to accept and enjoy
....
this dual nature of scientific thought and be willing to value
the way in which the two processes work together to give us
advances in understanding of the world. We ought not to
frown too much on either process, or at least to frown
equally on either process when it is unsupplemented by the
other. There is, I think, a delay in ...cience when we start to
specialize for too long either in stric~ or in.loose thinking. I
suspect, for example, that the Freudian edifice has been al-
lowed to grow too big before the corrective of ...trict thou!?ht
is applied to it-and now when investigators start rephrasmg .
the Freudian dogmas in new stricter terms there may be a_

87
lot of ill feeling, which is wasteful. (At this point I might
perhaps throw out a word of comfort to the orthodox in
psychoanalysis. When the formulators begin rooting about
among the most basic of analytic premises and questioning
the concrete reality of such concepts as the "ego" or "wishes"
or the "id" or the "libido"-as indeed they are already be-
ginning to root-there is no need to get alarmed and to
start having terror dreams of chaos and storms at sea. It is
certain that most of the old fabric of analysis will still be
left standing after the new underpinning has been inserted.
And when the concepts, postulates, and premises have been
straightened out, analysts will be able to embark upon a new
and still more fruitful orgy of loose thinking, until they reach
a stage at which again the results of their thinking must be
strictly conceptualized. I think that they ought to enjoy this
alternating quality in the progress of science and not delay
the progress of science by a refusal to accept this dualism.)
Further than this, besides simply not hindering progress, I
think we might do something to hasten matters, and I have
suggested two ways in which this might be done. One is to
train scientists to look among the older sciences for wild
analogies to their own material, so that their wild hunches
about their own problems will land them among the strict
formulations. The second method is to train them to tie
knots in their handkerchiefs whenever they leave some mat-
ter upformulated-to be willing to leave the matter so for
years, but still leave a warning sign in the very terminology
they use, such that these terms will forever stand, not as
fences hiding the unknown from future investigators, but
rather as signposts which read:
':UNEXPLORED BEYOND THIS
POINT."

It is, in ~e first place, argued that not the people but
rather the C1I'cumstances under which they live differ from
one community to another; that we have to deal with dif-
f~rences either in historical background or in current condi-
tions, and that these factors are sufficient to account for all
differences in behavior without our invoking any differences
of
charact~r in the individuals
~ncerned. Essentially this
argument IS an appeal to Occam s Razor-an assertion that
we ought .not to
~ultiply entities beyond necessity. The
argument IS that, where observable differences in circum-
stance exist, we ought to invoke those rather than mere in-
ferred differences in character, which we cannot observe.
The argument may be met in' part by quoting experi-
me~tal da~, such as Lewin's experiments (unpublished ma-
terIal), which showed that there are great differences in the
way in which Germans and Americans respond to failure in
an experimental setting. The Americans treated failure as a
challenge to increase effort; the Germans responded to the
same failure with discouragement. But those who argue for·
the effectiveness of conditions rather than character can still
reply that the experimental conditions are not, in fact, the
same for both groups; that the stimulus value of any circum-
stance depends upon how that circumstance stands out
against the background of other circumstances in the life of
the subject, and that this contrast cannot be the same for
both groups.
It is possible, in fact, to argue that since the same circum-
stances never occur for individuals of different cultural back-
ground, it is therefore unnecessary to invoke such abstractions
as national character. This argument breaks down I believe
when it is pointed out that, in stressing circumst~nce rathe;
than ~aracter, we would be ignoring the known facts about
leammg. Perhaps the best documented generalization in the
field of psychology is that, at any given moment, the be-
havioral characteristics of any mammal, and especially of
man, depend upon the previous experience and behavior of
that. individual. Thus in presuming that character, as well
as cIrcumstance, must be taken into account, we are not mul-
tiplying entities beyond necessity; we know of the signifi-
~nc~ of learned character from other types of data, and it
IS this knowledge which compels us to consider the additional
"entity:'

Scientific enquiry has been diverted from questions of this
type by a number of trains of thought which lead scientists
to regard all such questions as unprofitable or unsound. Be-

differences to be expected among European populations,
therefore, these. diverting trains of thought must be exam-

Barriers to Any Concept of "National Character"
. We shall proceed as follows: (1) We shall examine some
of the criticisms which can be urged against our entertaining
any concept of "national character." (2) This examination
will enable us to state certain conceptual limits within which
the phrase "national character" is likely to be valid. (3) We
shall then go on, within these limits, to outline what orders of
difference we may expect to find among Western nations,
trying, by way of illustration, to guess more concretely at
some of these differences. (4) Lastly, we shall consider how
the problems of morale and international relations are af-
fected by differences of this order.

for example, between the sexes, such complemen~ p:ttern~
as
sp~ctatorship-exhibitionism,
dominance-submission,
and
succonng-de,Pendence, or mixtures of these. Never do we
find mutualllTelevance between such groiJps.
Although it is unfortunately true that we know very little
about the te~s of habit differentiation between classes,
sexes, occupational groups, etc., in Western nations there is
I think, no danger in applying this general conclusion to all
~ase~ of stable differentiation between groups which are liv-
~g n:'" mutual contact. It is, to me, inconceivable that two
diffenng groups could exist'side by side in a community with-
out s~~e sort of mutual relevance between the special 'char-
actenstlcs of one group and those of the other. Such an occur-
~ence woul~ be contrary to the postulate that a community
IS an o~ga~zed unit. We shall, therefore, presume that this
generalization applies to all stable social differentiation.
~ow, all that we know of the mechanics of character for-
ma~on-especiaIIy the processes of projection, reaction for-
~ation, compensation, and the like-forces us to regard these
bIpolar patterns as unitary within the individual. If we know
that an individual is trained in overt expression of one-half
of one of these patterns, e.g., in dominance behavior we can
predict with certainty (though not in precise langu;ge) that
the seeds of the other half-submission-are Simultaneously
~own in his personality. We have to think of the individual
m
f~t, as trained in dominance-submission, not in eithe;
dommance or submission. From this it follows that where we
are dealing with stable differentiation within a community
we are justified in ascribing common character to the mem~
bers ?f. that community, provided we take the precaution of
des~bm~ that common character in terms of the motifs of
relationship between the differentiated sections of the com-
munity.
The same sort of considerations will guide us in dealing
•We are considering here only those cases in which
~thological differentiation follows the sex dichotomy. It
IS also probable that, where the ethos of the two sexes is
not sharply differentiated, it would still be correct to
say that the ethos of each promotes that of the other

A second barrier to any acceptance of the notion of "na-

tional character" arises after the first has been negotiated.,I
Those who grant that character must be considered can still

doubt whether any uniformity or regularity is likely to obtain

within such a sample of human beings as constitutes a nation.
Let us grant at once that unlformtty obviously does not occur,
I'
and let us proceed to consider what sorts of regularity may
be expected.
II
The criticism which we are trying to meet is likely to take
five forms. (1) The critic may point to the occurrence of
subcultural differentiation, to differences between the sexes, I
or between classes, or between occupational groups within
I
the community. (2) He may point to the extreme heter-
ogeneity and confusion of cultural norms which can be ob-
i
served in "melting-pot" communities. (3) He may point to
!
the accidental deviant, the individual who has undergone
some "accidental"· traumatic experience, not usual among
.
those in his social environment. (4) He may point to the
I
phenomena of cultural change, and especially to the sort of
I
differentiation which results when one part of the commUnity
lags behind some other in rate of change. (5) Lastly, he
\
may point to the arbitrary nature of national boundaries.
t
These objections are closely interrelated, and the replies
to them all derive ultimately from two postulates: first, that
the individual, whether from a physiological or a psycho-
logical point of view, is a single organized entity, such that
all its "parts" or "aspects" are mutually modifiable and
mutually interacting; and second, that a community is like-
wise organized in this sense.
If we look at' ..llocial differentiation in a stable com-
munity..:......say,
at
sex
differentiation
in
a

tribal-we find that it is not enough to say that the habit
system or the charaCter structure of one sex is different from
that of another. The significant point is that the habit system
of each sex cogs into the habit system of the other; that the
90

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
93
be systematically related to the old. As long as we confine
ow-selves to the terms and themes of this systematic rela-
tionship, therefore, we are entitled to expect regularity of
character in the individuals. Furthermore, the expectation
and experience of change may, in some cases, be so impor-
tant as to become a common character-determining factorS
sui generis, in the same sort of way that "heterogeneity" may
have positive effects.
Lastly, we may consider cases of shifting national boun-
daries, our fifth criticism. Here, of course, we cannot expect
that a diplomat's signature on a treaty will immediately modi-
fy the characters of the individuals whose national allegiance
is .thereby changed. It may even happen-for example, in
cases where a preliterate native population is brought for the
first time in contact with Europeans-that, for some time
after the shift, the two parties to such a situation will behave
~n an exploratory or almost random manner, each retaining
Its own norms and not yet developing any special adjustments
to the situation of contact. During this period, we should
still not expect any generalizations to apply to both groups.
Very soon, however, we know that each side does develop
special patterns of behavior to use in its contacts with the
other.4 At this point, it becomes meaningful to ask what
systematic terms of relationship will. describe the common
character of the ·two groups; and from this pomt on, the de-

"heterogeneity" in melting-pot communities, cf. M. Mead

• In the South Seas, those special modes of behavior
which Europeans adopt toward native peoples, and those
other modes of behavior which the native adopts toward
Europeans, are very obvious. Apart from analyses of
"pidgin" languages, we have, however, no psychological
data on these patterns. For a description of the analogous
patterns in Negro-white relationships, cf.

with our second criticism-the extremes of heterogeneity,
such as occur in modem "melting-pot" communities. Suppose,=I
we attempted to analyze out all the motifs of relationship
between individuals and groups in such a community as New
York City; if we did not end in the madhouse long before
we had completed our study, we should arrive at a picture
of common character that would be almost infinitely com-
plex-<:ertainly that would contain more fine differentiations
than the human psyche is capable of resolving within itself.
At this point, then, both we and the individuals whom we
are studying are forced to take a short cut: to treat heter-
ogeneity as a positive characteristic of the common environ-
ment, sui generis. When, with such an hypothesis, we begin
to look for common motifs of behavior, we note the very clear
tendencies toward glorying in heterogeneity for its own sake
(as in the Robinson Latouche "Ballad for Americans") and
toward regarding the world as made up of an infinity of dis-
connected quiz-bits (like Ripley's "Believe It or Not").
The third objection, the case of the individual deviant, falls
in the same frame of reference as that of the differentiation
of stable groups. The boy on whom an English public-school
education does not take, even though the original roots> of
his deviance were laid in some "accidental" traumatic in-
cident, is reacting to the public-school system. The behavioral
habits which he acquires may not follow the norms which
the school intends to implant, but they are acquired in reac-
tion to those very norms. He may (and often does) acquire
patterns the exact opposite of the normal; but he cannot con-
ceivably acquire irrelevant patterns. He may become a "bad"
public-school Englishman, he may become insane, but still
his deviant characteristics will be systematically. related to
the norms which he is resisting. We may describe his charac-
ter, indeed, by saying that it is as systematically related to
the standard public-school character as the character of
Iatmul natives of one sex is systematically related to the char-
acter of the other sex. His character is oriented to the motifs
and patterns of relationship in the society in which he lives.
The same frame of reference applies to the fourth consider-
ation, that of changing communities and the sort of differen-
tiation which occurs when one section of a community lags
behind another in.change. Since the direction in which a
change occurs will necessarily be conditioned by the statfJ8 .

•The Balinese social system in the mountain commu-
nities is almost entirely devoid of such dualisms. The
ethological differentiation of the sexes is rather slight;
political factions are completely absent. In the plains,
there is a dualism which has resulted from the intrusive
Hindoo caste system, those with caste being discrimi-
nated from those without caste. At the symbolic level
(partly as a result of Hindoo influence) dualisms are
much more frequent, however, than they are in the social
structure (e.g., Northeast vs. Southwest, Gods vs. demons,
symbolic Left vs. Right, symbolic Male vs. Female, etc.).
scriptions some such continua as "degree of interest in, or
orientation toward, dominance-submission."
So far, we have mentioned only a very short list of bipolar
characteristics:
dominance-submission,
succoring-depen-
dence, and exhibitionism-spectatorship. One criticism will
. certainly be uppermost in the reader's mind, that, in short, all
three of these characteristics are clearly present in all West-
ern cultures. Before our method becomes useful, therefore,
we must try to expand it to give us sufficient scope and
discriminatory power to differentiate one Western culture
from another.
As this conceptual frame develops, no doubt, many further
expansions and discriminations will be introduced. The pres-
ent paper will deal with only three such types of expansion.
Alternatives to Bipolarity
When we invoked bipolarity as a means of handling differ-
entiation within society without foregoing some notion of
common character structure, we considered only the possibil-
ity of 5imple bipolar differentiation. Certainly this pattern is
very common in Western cultures; take, for instance, Repub-
lican-Democrat, political Right-Left, sex differentiation, God
and the devil, and so on. These peoples even try to impose
a binary pattern upon phenomena which are not dual in na-
ture--youtli versus age, labor versus capital, mind versus
matter-and, in general, lack the organizational devices for
handling triangular systems; the inception of any "third"
party is always regarded, for example, as a threat to our
political organization. This clear tendency toward dual sys-
tems ought not, however, to blind us to the occurrence of
other patterns.6
The above examination of "straw men" in the case against
"national character" has very. stringently limited the scope
of this concept. But the conclusions from this examination
are by no means simply negative. To limit the scope of a
concept is almost synonymous with defining it.
We have added one very important tool to our equipment
-the technique of describing the common character (or the
"highest common factor" of character) of individuals in a hu-·
I
man community in terms of bipolar adjectives. Instead of
I
despairing in face of the fact that. nations are ~igh1y ~~er-
.
entiated, we shall take the dimensIOns of that differentiation
I
as our clues to the national character. No longer 'content to
'c I
say, "Germans are submissive," or ''Englishmen are aloof,"
.,
we shall use such phrases as "dominant-submissive" when re-

lationships of this sort can be shown to occur. Similarly, we

acter," unless we can show that by "paranoidal" we mean

•The term "cooperation," which is sometimes used as
the opposite of "competition," covers a very wide variety
of patterns, some of them symmetrical and others com-
plementary, soine bipolar and others in which the
cooperating individuals are chiefly oriented to some
personal or impersonal goal. We may expect that some
careful·analysis of these patterns will give us vocabulary
for describing other sorts of national characteristics. Such
an analysis cannot be attempted in this paper.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
Certainly, any full discussion of English character
to allow for ternary, as well ,as bipolar patterns.
Symmetrical Motifs
So far, we have considered only what we have called "com-
plementary" pattenlS of relationship, in which the behavior
patterns at one end of the relationship are different from,
but fit in with, the behavior pattenlS at the other end
(dominance-submission,
etc.).
There
exists,
however,
a
whole category of human interpersonal behavior which does
not conform to this description. In addition to the contrasting
complementary patterns, we have to recognize the existence
of a series of symmetrical pattenlS, in which people respond
to what others are doing by themselves doing something simi-
lar. In particular, we have to consider those competitivell pat-
,-
tenlS in which individual or group A is stimulated to more
of any type of behavior by perceiving more of that same type
of behavior (or greater success in that type. of behaVior)
in individual or group B.
There is a very profound contrast between such competi-
tive systems. of behavior and complementary dominance-
submission systems-a highly significant contrast for any dis-
cussion of national character. In complementary striving, the
stimulus which prompts A to greater efforts is the relative
weakness in B; if we want to make A subside or submit,
,we ought to show him that B is stronger than he is. In fact,
.' the complementary character structure may be summarized
by the phrase "bully-coward," implying the combination of
these characteristics in the personality. The symmetrical com-
.petitive systems, .on the other hand, are an almost precise
,functional opposite of the complementary. Here the stimulus
M"hich evokes greater striving in A is the vision of greater

11 For a fuller study, we ought to consider such other
motifs as aggression-passivity, possessive-possessed, agent-
tool, etc. And all of these motifs will require somewhat
more critical definition than can be attempted in this
paper.
Combinations of Motifs
Among the complementary motifs, we have mentioned only
three-dominance-submission,
exhibitionism-spectatorship,
and succorance-dependence--but these three will suffice to
illustrate the sort of verifiable hypotheses at which we can
arrive by deSCribing national character in this hyphenated
terminology.12
Since, clearly, all three of these motifs occur in all Western
cultures,
the possibilities for
international difference
are
limited to the proportions and ways in which the motifs are
combined. The proportions are likely to be very difficult to
detect, except where the diHerences are very large. We may
be sure ourselves that Germans are more oriented toward
dominance-submission than are Americans, but to demon-
strate this ~ty is likely to be difficult. To estimate
,diHerences in the degree of development of exhibitionism-
"pectatorship or succorance-dependence in the various na-
tions will, indeed, probably be quite impossible.
,
H, however, we consider the possible ways in which these
~otifs may be combined together, we find sharp qualitative
:diHerences which are susceptible of easy verification. Let us
'asswne that all three of these motifs are developed in all
~lationships in all Western cultures, and from this asswnp-
fon go on to consider which individual plays which role.

strate to A that B is really weak, A will relax his efforts.
It is probable that these two contrasting patterns are alike
available as potentialities in all hwnan beings; but clearly,
any individual who behaves in both ways at once will risk
internal confusion
and
conflict. .In
the
various
national
groups, consequently, different methods of resolving this dis-
crepancy have developed. In England and in America, where
children. and adults are subjected to an almost continuous
barrage of disapproval whenever they exhibit the compie-
~1'
mentary patterns, they inevitably come to accept the ethics
of "fair play." Responding to the challenge of difficulties, they
cannot, without gUilt, kick the underdog.10 For British morale

In Germany, on the other hand, the same cliches are appar-

ently lacking, and the community is chiefly organized on the
basis of a complementary hierarchy in terms of dominance-
!
submission. The dominance behavior is sharply and clearly
developed; yet the picture is not perfectly clear and needs
further investigation. Whether a pure dominance-submission
hierarchy could ever exist as a stable system is doubtful. It
seems that in the case of Germany, the submission end of
the pattern is masked, so that overt submissive behavior is
almost as strongly tabooed as it is in America or England.
In place of submission, we find a sort of parade-ground im- •
passivity.
'
.
A hint as to the process by which the submissive role is
modified and rendered tolerable comes to us out of the inter-
views in a recently begun study of German life histories.ll
One German subject described how diHerent was the treat-
ment which he, as a boy, received in his South German home,
from that which his sister received. He said that much more
was demanded of him; that his sister was allowed to evade
discipline; that whereas he was always expected to click his

dependence.

symbols accordingly. Our God, or our king, is the "fath
of his people. In Bali, on the other hand, the gods are
"children" of the people, and when a god speaks thro
the mouth of a person in trance, he addresses anyone w
will listen as "father."
Similarly, the rajah is sa;angan
("spoilt" like a child) by his people. The Balinese, furth'
are very fond of putting children in the combined roles "
god and dancer; in mythology, the perfect prince is polish
and narcissistic. Thus the Balinese pattern might be s ,
marized thus:

Though the analogous German'pattern probably resembles
i
the American in the arrangement of the paired comple-
i
mentary roles, certainly it differs from the American in that
the father's dominance is much stronger and much more con-
sistent, and especially in that the content of the boy's exhibi-
tionism is quite different. He is, in fact, -dominated into a
sort of heel-clicking _exhibitionism which takes the place of
overt submissive behavior. Thus, while in the American char-
acter exhibitionism is encouraged by the parent as a method
of psychological weaning, both its function and its content
are for the German entirely different.
Differences of this order, which may be expected in all
European nations,are probably the basis of many of our
naive and often unkind international comments. They may,
indeed be of considerable importance in the mechanics of
intern~tional relations, in as much as an understanding of
them might dispel some of our misunderstandings. To an
American eye, the English too often appear "arrogant,"
whereas to an English eye the American appears,to be "boast-
ful." H we could show precisely how much of truth and how
much of distortion is present in these impressions, it might
be a real contribution to interallied cooperation.
~,
In terms of the diagrams above, the "arrogance" of the :
Englishman would be due to the combination of dominance.:
and exhibitionism. The Englishman in a'performing role (the,
parent at breakfast, the newspaper editor,
the political,4',
spokesman, the lecturer, or what not) assumes that he is also, '
in a dominant role-that he can decide in accordance With
vague, abstract standards what sort of performance to giv:
-and the audience can "take it or leave it," His own
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
103
rogance he sees either as "natural" or as mitigated by his
humility in face of the abstract standards. Quite unaware that
his behavior could conceivably be regarded as a comment
upon his audience, he is, on the contrary, aware only of be-
having in the performer's role, as he understands that role.
But the American does ,not see it thus. To him, the "arrogant"
behavior of the Englishman appears to be directed against
the audience, in which case the implicit invocation of some
abstract standard appears only to add insult to injury.
Similarly, the behavior which an Englishman interprets as
"boastful" in an American is not aggressive, although the
Englishman may feel that he is being subjected to some sort
of invidious comparison. He does not know that, as a matter
of fact, Americans will only behave like this to people whom
they rather like and respect. According to the hypotheSiS
above, the "boasting" pattern results from the curious linkage,
whereby exhibition of self-sufficiency and independence is
played off against overdependence. The American, when he
boasts, is looking for approval of his upstanding indepen-
dence; but the naive Englishman interprets this behavior as
a bid for some sort of dominance or superiority.
In this sort of way, we may suppose that the whole flavor
of one national culture may differ from that of another, and
that such differences may be considerable enough to lead to
serious misunderstandings. It is probable, however, that these
differences are not so complex in their nature as to be beyond
the reach of investigation. Hypotheses of the type which we
have advanced could be easily tested, and research on these
lines is urgently needed.
National Character and American Morale
Using the motifs of interpersonal and intergroup relation-
ship as our clues to national character, we have been able
to indicate certain orders of regular difference which we may
expect to find among the peoples who share our Western
civilization. Of necessity, our statements have been theoreti-
cal rather than empirical; still, from the theoretical structure
which we have built up, it is possible to extract certain for-
mulas which may be useful to the builder of morale.

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
105
pedal the fact that we have a man-sized job on our hands,
but they will do well to insist also that America is a man-
sized nation. Any sort of attempt to reassure Americans by
minimizing. the strength of the enemy must be avoided, but
frank boasts of real success are good.
(4) Because our vision of the peace is a factor in our war-
making morale, it is worthwhile to ask at once what light
the study of national diHerences may throw upon the prob-
lems of the peace table.
We have to devise a peace treaty (a) such that Americans
and British will fight to achieve it, and (b) such that it
will bring out the best rather than the worst characteristics
of our enemies. If we approach it scientifically, such a prob-
lem is by no means beyond our skill.
The most conspicuous psychological hurdle to be negoti-
ated, in imagining such a peace treaty, is the contrast be-
tween British and American symmetrical patterns and the
German complementary pattern, with its taboo on overt sub-
missive behavior. The allied nations are not psychologically
equipped to enforce a harsh treaty; they might draw up such
a treaty, but in six months they would tire of keeping the
underdog down. The Germans, on the other hand, if they
see their role as "submissive," will not stay down without
harsh treatment. We have seen that these considerations ap-
plied even to such a mildly punitive treaty as was devised
at Versailles; the allies omitted to enforce it, and the Germans
refused to accept it. It is, therefore, useless to dream of such
a treaty, and worse than useless to repeat such dreams as
a way of raising our morale now, when we are angry with
Germany. To do that would only obscure the issues in the
final settlement.
This incompatibility between complementary and sym-
metrical motivation means, in fact, that the· treaty cannot be
organized around Simple dominance-submissive motifs; hence
we are forced to look for alternative solutions. We. must ex-
amine, for example, the motif of exhibitionism-spectatorship .
--.,;what dignified role is each of the various nations best
fitted to play?-and that of succoring-dependence-in the
starving postwar world, what motivational patterns shall w~
evoke between those who give and those who receive food?

It would bean oversimplification-it would even be false

:.Among the physicists and chemists there may be some who

(6) The link with erogenous zones suggested in 5, above,
indicates that we ought, perhaps, not to think of simple rising
exponential curves of intensity limited only by factors analo-
gous to fatigue, such as Richardson's equations would imply;
but rather that we should expect our curves to be bounded
by phenomena comparable to orgasm-that the achievement
of a certain degree of bodily or neural involvement or inten-
sity may be followed by a release of schismogenic tension.
Indeed, all that we know about human beings in various sorts
of simple contests would seem to indicate that this is the
case, and that the conscious or unconscious wish for release
of this kind is an important factor which draws the partici-
pants on and prevents them from simply withdrawing from
contests which would otherwise not commend themselves to
"common sense." H there be any basic human characteristic
which makes man prone to struggle, it would seem to be
this hope of release from. tension through total involvement.
In the case of war this factor is undoubtedly often potent.
(The real truth-that in modem warfare only a very few
of the particip'ants achieve this climactic release-seems
hardly to stand against the insidious myth of "total" war.)
(7) In 1936 it was suggested that the phenomenon of
"falling in love" might be comparable to a schismogenesis
with the signs reversed, and even that "if the course of true
love ever ran smooth it would follow an exponential curve:'7
Richardson8 has since, independently, made the same point
in more formal terms. Paragraph 6, above, clearly indicates
,that the "exponential curves" must give place to some type
of curve which will not rise indefinitely but will reach a cli-
max and then fall. For the rest, however, the obvious relation-
ship of these interactive phenomena to climax and orgasm
very much strengthens the case for regarding schismogenesis
,and those cumulative sequences of interaction which lead to

Balinese Character
(a) The most important exception to the above generaliza-
tion occurs in the relationship between adults (especially
parents) and children. Typically, the mother will start a small
flirtation with the child, pulling its penis or otherwise stimu-
lating it to interpersonal activity. This will excite the child,
and for a few moments cumulative interaction will occur.
Then just as the child, approaching some small climax, flings
its arms around the mother's neck, her attention wanders.
At this point the child will typically start an alternative cum-
ulative interaction, building up toward temper tantrum. The
mother will either play aspeetator's role, enjoying the child's
tantrum, or, if the child actually attacks her, will brush off
his attack with no show of anger on her part. These se-
quences can be seen either as an expression of the mother's
distaste for this type of personal involvement or as context
in which the child acquires a deep distrust of such involve-
ment. The perhaps basically human tendency towards cumu.:,,'

child s tendenCIes toward competitive and rivalrous behavior
The mother will, for example, tease the child by suckling
the baby of some other woman and will enjoy her own child's
efforts to push the intruder from the breast.ll
(c) In general the lack of climax is characteristic for Bali-
nese music, drama, and other art forms. The music typically
has a progression, derived from the logic of its formal strue-
~e, and modifications of intensity determined by the dura-
tion and progress of the working out of these formal relations.
It does not have the sort of rising intensity and climax struc-
ture characteristic of modem Occidental music but rather
a formal progression.12

(d). Balinese culture includes definite teclmiques for deal-
ing With quarrels. Two men who have quarrelled will go for-
mally
~o the
offic~ of the local representative of the Rajah
and will there regIster their quarrel, agreeing that whichever
speaks to theo~er shall pay a fine or make an offering to
the gods. Later, if the quarrel terminates, this contract may
be
formally
nullified.
Smaller-but
similar-avoidances
(pwik) are practiced, even by small children in their quar-
rels. It is
s~gnificant, perhaps, that this procedure is not an
attempt t~ influ~nce the protagonists away from hostility and
toward fne~dship. Rather: it is a formal recognition of the
state o~ therr mutual relationship, and possibly, in some sort,
a. peggIng of the relationship at that state. H this interpreta-
tion is correct, this method of dealing with quarrels would
correspond to the substitution of a plateau for a climax.

The foregOing descriptive generalizations are all partial an-
sw~rs to a ne&ative question-"Why is Balinese society non-
schismogenicr-and from the combination of these generali-
zations we arrive at a picture of a society differing very
markedly from our own, from that of the Iatmul, from those
systems of social opposition which Radcliffe-Brown has ana-
lyzed, .and from any social structure postulated by Marxian
analySIS.
We started with the hypothesis that human beings have
~ tend~cy to invol;e themselves in sequences of cumulative
mteraction,
an~ thIS hypoth.esis is still left virtually intact.
Among .the Balinese the babIes, at least, evidently have such
tendenCIes. But for sociological validity this hypothesis must
now be guar~ed with a p~ren.thetical clause stipulating that
~ese ten?encles are.ol?erative m the dynamics of society only
if the childhood tralDlng is not such as to prevent their ex-
pression in adult life.
We have made an advance in our knowledge of the scope
of hum~n character formation in demonstrating that these
tendenCIes toward cumulative interaction are subject to some
sort of modification, deconditiOning, or inhIbition.15 And this
is an important advance. We know how it is that the Balinese
are nonschismogenic and we know how their distaste for
schismogenic patterns is expressed in various details of the
SOcial organization-the rigid hierarchies, the institutions for
the handling of quarrels, etc.-but we still know nothing of
the positive dynamics of the society. We have answered only
the negative question.

different psychology of warfare was no doubt developed
when the kingdom of Karangasem embarked on the conquest
of the neighboring island of Lombok in the beginning of the
eighteenthcentury. The psychology of this militarism has .not
been investigated, but there is reason to believe that the time
perspectiye of the Balinese colonists in Lombok is today sig-
nificantly different from that of Balinese in Bali.)18
(f) The formal techniques of social inHuenee-oratory and
the like-are almost totally lacking in Balinese culture. To
demand the continued attention of an individual or to exert
emotional inHuence upon a group are alike distasteful and
virtually impossible; because in such circumstances the atten-
tion of the victim rapidly wanders. Even such continued
speech as would. in most cultures, be used for the telling
of stories does not occur in Bali. The narrator will, typically,
pause after a sentence or two, and wait for SOme member
of the audience to ask him a concrete question about some
detail of the plot. He will then answer the question and so
resume his narration, This procedure apparently breaks the
cumulative tension by irrelevant interaction.

the caste system and the hierarchy of full citizens who are

Balinese Ethos
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
The next step, therefore, is to ask about Balinese ethos.
~'
What actually are the motives and the values which accom-
~t'\
pany the complex and rich cultural activities of the Balinese? }: '
What, if not competitive and other types of cumulative in- i.L
terrelationship, causes the Balinese to carry out the elaborate
_1!..
-
patterns of their lives?
"
(1) It is immediately clear to any visitor to Bali that the
driving force for cultural activity is not either acquisitivenessifJ'
or crude physiological need. The Balinese, especially in the ,-t!" :.
plains, are not hungry or poverty-stricken. They are wasteful -.,: -
of food, and a very considerable part of their activity gOElB!>'V
into entirely nonproductive activities of an artistic or rituaL:':
nature in which food and wealth. are lavishly expended. Es-'~
sentially, we are dealing with an economy of plenty rather.;:
than an economy of scarcity. Some, indeed, are rated "POOr"'ff
by their fellows,. but none of these poor ar~ threatened by ,ti:
starvation, and the suggestion that human bemgs may actual.',;
ly starve in great Occidental cities was, to the Balinese, un·
utterably shocking.
'
(2) In their economic transactions the Balinese show a:
great deal of carefulness in their small dealings. They
.
"penny wise." On the other hand, this carefulness is counte
acted by occasional "pound foolishness" when they will 6.
pend large sums of money upon ceremonials and other fo
of lavish consumption. There are very few Balinese who ha

w~alth or prop
these few are partly disliked and partly regarded as oddi . ,

They are saving until they have enough to spend largely o.

in terms of the individual's attempt to maximize value, h~
rather compare it with the relaxation oscillations of physt,
ogy and engineering, realizing that not only is this anal
descriptive of their sequences of transactions, but that
themselves see these sequences as naturally having some s
form.

(6) It is of great interest to note th.at ma~y B~linese ac-
tions are articulately accounted for m soclQloglCal terms
rather than in terms of individual goals or values,17
This is most conspicuous in regard to all actions related
to the village council, the hierarchy which includes all full
citizens. This body, in its secular aspects, is referred to as
I Desa (literally, "Mr. Village"), and numerous rules and
procedures are rationalized by reference to th~s abst;act ?er-
sonage. Similarly, in its sacred aspects, the vdlage IS deIfied
as Betara Desa (God Village), to whom shrines are erected
and offerings brought. (We may guess that a Dur~eimian
analysis would seem to the Balinese to. be an obVIous
an~
appropriate approach to the understanding of much of theIr
public culture.)
.
.
In particular all money transactions which involve the vil-
lage treasury are governed by the gener~lization,."The vill~ge
does notlose" (Desanne sing dadi pot,ol). ThIS generaliza-
tion applies, for example, in all cases in which -a beast is
sold from the village herd. Under no circumstances can the
village accept a price less than that which it actually or nomi-
nally paid. (It is important to ~ote that .~e ru~e takes th.e

him the money. In response to further pressing as to what
would happen if he really refused, we were told that nobody
ever had refused, but that if somebody did, nobody would
go through the ceremony again. Implicit in this answer and
in the fact that nobody ever does refuse is the assumption
that the ongoing cultural process is itself to be valued.
(7) Actions which are culturally correct (patoet) are ac-
ceptable and aesthetically valued. Actions which are permis-
sible (dmii) are of more or less neutral value' while actions
which ~e not permissible (sing dmii) are to 'be deprecated
and aVOIded. These generalizations, in their translated form,
are no doubt true in many cultures, but it is important to
get a cl~ar ~derstanding of what the Balinese mean by dadi.
~he notion IS not to.be equated with our "etiquette" or "law,"
smce each of these Invokes the value judgment of some other
per~on or sociological entity. In Bali there is no feeling that
actions have been or are categorized as dmii or sing dadi
by some human or supernatural authority. Rather, the state-
me~t ~at such-and-such an action is dadt is an absolute gen-
er~liza~on

tIllS action IS regular.1s It is wrong for a casteless person to
~d~ess a prince in other than the "polished language," and
It IS wrong for a menstruating woman to enter a temple. The
prince or the deity may express annoyance, but there is no
feeling that either the prince, the deity, or the casteless per-
son made the rules. The offense is felt to be against the order
and natural structure of the universe rather than against the
actual person offended. The offender, even in such serious
matters as incest (for which he may be extruded from the
sOciety) 19 is not blamed for anything worse than stupidity
and clumsiness. Rather, he is "an unfortunate person" (anak

.by consld.enng the premisses of a strictly competitive Von
Neumanruan ga~e and procee~ by c,onsidering what changes
we must make m these premisses m order to approximate
more closely to the Balinese system.

(1) ~e players in a Von Neumannian game are, by
ypOtheslS, motivated only in terms of a single linear (sc.
onetary) scale of value. Their strategies are determined:
(a) ~y the rules. of ~e hypothetical game; and (b) by their
telligence, which IS, by hypothesis, sufficient to solve all
roblems presented by the game. Von Neumann shows that,
nder certain definable circumstances depending upon the
umber of players and upon the rules, coalitions of various
orts will be formed by the players, and in fact Von Neu-
ann's analysiS concentrates mainly upon the structure of
ese coalitions and the distribution of value among the
embers. In comparing these games with human societies we

The details are too complex and too various for this, and
so the individual Balinese is forever picking his way, like a
\ .
tightrope walker, afraid at any moment lest he make some
~_L
misstep.
~J
(8) The metaphor from postural balance used in the last
paragraph is demonstrably applicable in many contexts of
Balinese culture:
(a) The fear of loss of support is an important theme in .
Balinese childhood.20
(b) E.!evation (with its attendant problems of physical
and metaphorical balance) is the passive complement of ra-
spect.21

must then move in that direction in order to maintain the

is not punctuated in this way, and eaoh individual faces a
vista of unknowable factors whose number increases (prob-
ably exponentially) into the future.
(d) The Von Neumannian players are, by hypothesis, not
susceptible either to economic death or to boredom. The
losers can go on losing forever, and no player can withdraw
from the game, even though the outcome of every play is
definitely predictable in probability terms.
(3) Of these differences between Von Neumannian and
human systems, only the differences in value scales and the
possibility of "death" conCern us here. For the sake of sim-
plicity we shall· assume that the other differences, though
very profound, can for the moment be ignored. '
(4) Curiously, we may note that, although men are mam-
mals and therefore have a primary value system which
is multidimensional and nonmaximizing, it is yet possible for
these creatures to
b~ put into contexts in which they will
strive to maximize one or a few simple variables (money,
prestige, power, etc.).
(5) Since the multidimensional value system is apparently
primary, the problem presented by, fQr example, Iatmul
social organization is not so much to account for the be-
havi,or of Iatmul individuals by invoking (or abstracting)
their value system; we should also ask how that value system
is imposed on the mammalian individuals by the social orga-
nization in which they find themselves. Conventionally in
anthropology
this
question
is
attacked through
genetic
psychology. We endeavor to collect data to show how the
value system implicit in the social organization is built into
the character structure of the individuals in their childhood.
There is, however, an alternative approach which would
momentarily ignore, as Von Neumann does, the phenomena
of learning and consider merely the strategic implications of
those contexts which must occur in accordance with the
given "rules" and the coalition system. In this connection it is
important to note that competitive contexts-provided the
individuals can be made to recognize the contexts
as
competitive-inevitably reduce the complex gamut of values
to very simple and even linear and monotone terms.<26 Con-

players.

.
(b) The mammalian value scale IS not SImple and mono-
tone, but may be'exceedingly complex. We know: ev~n at a
physiological level, that calcium will not replace VItamIns, nor
will an amino acid replace oxygen. Further, we know that
the animal doeS not strive to maximize its supply of any of
these discrepant commodities, but rather is required to main-
tain the supply of each within tolerable limits. Too much may
be as harmful as too little. It is also doubtful whether
mammalian preference is always transitive.
(0) In the Von Neumannian system the number o! moves
in a given "play" of a game is assumed to be finite,. The
strategic problems of the individuals are soluble beca~e the
individual can operate within a limited time perspective. He
need only look forward a finite distance to the end of the
play when the gains and losses will be paid. up and. ever;- .
thing will start again from a tabula rasa. In human SOCIety life
1Il Alternatively, we might ha,ndle the analogy in another
way. A social system is, as Von Neumann and Morge!"-
stem point out, comparable to a non-zero sum .game m
which one or more coalitions of people play agamst ~~h
other and against nature. The non-zero sum charactenstic
is based on the fact that value is continually extr~cted
from the natural environment.
Inas.muc~ as .Balinese
society exploits nature, the total entity, mcluding both
environment and people, is clearly compw::able
t~ a
game requiring coalition between people. It 18 poSSIble,
however, that that subdivision of the total game ~m­
prising the people only might be such that th~ formatl~n .,
of coalitions within it would not be
essential--;th~t

Balinese society may differ from ~ost other sOCleties in'',f;

unlikely to be maintained if the position of the balls of the
governor is clamped, Similarly a tightrope walker with a
balancing pole will not be able to maintain his balance except
by varying the forces which he exerts upon the pole.
(9) Returning now to the conceptual model suggested in
paragraph 7, let us take one further step toward making this
model comparable with Balinese, society. Let us substitute
for the umpire a: village council composed of all the players.
We now have a system which presents a number of analogies
to our balancing acrobat. When they speak as members of
the village council, the players by hypothesis are interested
in maintaining the steady state of the system-that is, in
preventing the maximization of any simple variable the ex-
cessive increase of which would produce irreversible change.
In their daily life, however, they are still engaged in Simple
competitive strategies.
(10) The next step toward making our model resemble
Balinese society more closely is clearly to postulate in the
character structure of the individuals and/or in the contexts
of their daily life those factors which will motivate them
toward maintenance of the steady state not only when they
speak in council, but also in their other interpersonal relations.
These factors are in fact recognizable in Bali and have been
enumerated above. In our analysis of why Balinese society is
nonschismogenic, we noted that the Balinese child learns to
avoid cumulative interaction, I.e" the maximization of certain
Simple Variables, and that the social organization and contexts
of daily life are so constructed as to preclude competitive
interaction, Further, in our analysis of the Balinese ethos, we
noted recUITent valuation: (a) of the clear and static defini-
tion of status and spatial orientation, and (b) of balance and
such movement as will conduce to balance.
In sum it seems that the Balinese extend to human rela-
tionships attitudes based upon bodily balance, and that they
generalize the idea that motion is essential to balance, This
last point gives us, I believe, a partial answer to the question
of why the society not only continues to function but func-
tions rapidly aI;ld busily,continually undertaking ceremOnial
. and artistic tasks whicliare not economically or competitively
determined, This steady state is maintained by continual
nonprogressive change.

small restraining effect at low intensities of schismogenesis
may increase with increase of intensity. Friction, fatigue, and
limitation of energy supply would be examples of such
factors.
In contrast with these schismogenic systems, Balinese so-
ciety is an entirely diHerent type of mechanism, and in de-
scribing it the anthropologist must follow entirely diHerent
procedures, for which rules cannot as yet be laid down,
Since the class of "nonsohismogenic" social systems is defined
only in negative terms, we cannot assume that members of
the class will have common characteristics. In the analysts
of the Balinese system, however, the following steps oc-
curred, and it is possible that some at least of these may be
applicable in the analysis of other cultures of this class: (1)
it was observed that
s~ogenic sequences are rare in
Bali: (2) the exceptional cases in which such sequences
occur were investigated; (3) from this investigation it ap-
peared, (a) that in general the contexts which recur in
Balinese social life preclude cumulative interaction and (b)
that childhood experience trains the child away from seeking
climax in personal interaction: (4) it was shown that certain
positive values-related to balance-1'ecur in the culture and
are incorporated into the character structure during child-
hood, and, further, that these values may be specifically re-
lated to ,the steady state: (5) a more detailed study is now
required to arrive at a systematic statement about the se1£-
correcting characteristics of the system. It is evident that the
ethos alone is insufficient to maintain the steady state. From
time to time the village or some other entity does step in to
correct infractions. The nature of these instances of the work-
ingof the corrective mechanism must be studied: but it is
clear that this intemlittent mechanism is very diHerent from
the continually acting restraints which must be present in all
schismogenic systems.

placed sideways and lacks .that grace which the animals
have and which God has.
I argue that art is a part of man's quest for grace; some-
times his ecstasy in partial success, sometimes his rage and
agony at failure.
I argue also that there are many species of grace within
the major genus; and also that there are many kinds of
failure and frustration and departure from grace. No doubt
each culture has its characteristio species of grace toward
which its artists shive, and its own species of failure.
Some cultures may foster a negative approach to this
difficult integration, an avoidance of complexity by crass
preference either for total consciousness or total unconscious-
ness. Their art is unlikely to be "great."
I shall argue that the problem of grace is fundamentally a
problem of integration and that what is to be integrated is
the diverse parts of the mind-especially those multiple lev-
els of which one extreme is called "consciousness" and the
other the "unconscious," For" the attainment of grace, the
reasons of the heart must be integrated with the reasons of
the reason.
Edmund Leach has confronted us, in this conference, with
the question: How is it that the art of one culture can have
meaning or validity for critics raised in' a different culture?
My answer would be that, if art is somehow expressive of
something like grace or psychic integration, then the success
of this expression might well be recognizable across cultural
barriers. The phYSical grace of cats is profoundly different
from the physical grace of horses, and yet a man who has the
physical grace of neither can evaluate that of both.
And even when the subject matter of art is the frustration
of integration, cross-cultural recognition of the products of
this frustration is not too surprising.
The central question is: In what form is information about
psychic integration contained or coded in the work of art?
Style and Meaning
They say that "every picture tells a story," and this gen"
eraIization holds fQr most of art if we exclude. "mere" geo-
metric ornamentation. But I want precisely to avoid analyzing

1:

.. I.
130
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
the "story." That aspect of the work of art which can m~st
easily be reduced to words-the mytholog~ connected WIth
the subject matter-is not what I want to discuss. ~ shall not
even mention the unconscious mythology of phallic symbol-
ism, except at the end.
..'
I am concerned with what impOl:tant psychic information
is in the art object quite apart from what it may "represe~t,"
"Le style est l'homme t'nBme" ("The style is the man hlID-
seH") (Buffon). What is implicit in style, materials, composi-
tion, rhythm, skill, and so on?
..
Clearly this subject matter will include geometrIcal orna-
mentation along with the composition and stylistic aspects of
more representational works.
.
The lions in Trafalgar Square could have been eagles or
bulldogs and still have carried the same (or similar) messages
about empire and about the cultural premises of nineteenth-
century England. And yet, how different might their message
have been had they been made of woodl
.
But representationalism as £uch is relevant. The extremely
realistic horses and stags of Altamira are surely not about
the same cultural premises as the highly
conventiona~ed
black outlines of a later period. The code whereby perceIved
objects or persons (or supernaturals) are
transform~d into
wood or paint is a source of information about the artist and
his culture.
It is the very rules of transformation that are of interest
to me--not the message, but the code.
My goal is not instrumental. I do not want to use the
transformation rules when discovered to undo the transfor-
mation or to "decode" the message. To translate the art ob-
ject into mythology and then examine the mythology would
be only a neat way of dodging or negating the problem of
"what is art?"
I ask, then, not about the meaning of the encoded messa~e
but rather about the meaning of the code chosen. But still
that most slippery word "meaning" must be defined.
It will be convenient to define meaning in the most gen-
eral possible way in the first instance.
.
"Meaning" may be regarded as an approximate synonym
of pattern, redundancy, information, and "restraint," within a
paradigm of the following sort:
.
Any aggregate of events or objects (e.g., a sequence of
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
131
phonemes, a painting, or a frog,' or a culture) shall be said
to contain "redundancy" or ~'pattern" if the aggregate can be
divided in any way by a "slash mark," such that an observer
perceiving. only what is on one side of the slash mark can
guess, with better than random success, what is on the other
side of the slash mark. We may say that what is on one side
of the slash contains information or has meaning about what
is on the other side. Or, in engineer's language, the aggre-
gate contains "redundancy,"Or, again, from the point of view
of a cybernetic observer, the information available on one
side of the slash will restrain (i.e., reduce the probability
of) wrong guessing. Examples:
The letter T in a given location in a piece of written
English prose proposes that the next letter is likely to be an
H or an R or a vowel. It is possible to make a better than
random guess across a slash which immediately follows the
T. English spelling contains redundancy.
From a part of an English sentence, delimited by a slash,
it is possible to guess at the syntactic structure of the re-
mainder of the sentence.
From a tree visible above ground, it is possible to guess
at the existence of .roots below ground. The top provides
information about the bottom.
From an arc of a drawn circle, it is possible to guess at
the position of other parts of the circumference. (From the
diameter of an ideal circle, it is possible to assert the length
of the circumference. But this is a matter of truth within a
tautological system.)
From how the boss acted yesterday, it may be possible to
guess how he will act today.
From what I say, it may be possible to make predictions
about how you will answer. My words contain meaning or
information about your reply.
,
Telegraphist A has a written message on his pad and
sends this message over wire to B, s9 that B now gets the
same sequence of letters on his message pad. This transaction
(or "language game" in Wittgenstein's phrase) has created a
redundant universe for an observer O. If 0 knows what was
on A's pad, he can make a better than random guess at what
is on B's pad.

information, and/or the reduction of the random by "re-
straint."
'It is, I believe, of prime importance to have a conceptual
system which will force us to see the "message" (e.g., the art
object) as both itself internally patterned and itself a part ~
a larger patterned universe--the culture or som? part of It.
The characteristics of objects of art are believed to be
about, or to be partly derived from, or determined by, other
characteristics of cultural and psychological systems. Our
problem might therefore be oversimply represented by the
diagram:
lOua.lerlltlel .1 lII'tobJecI/CbuacterlJtlel 01 reat of culturel
where square brackets enclose the universe of relevance, and
where the oblique stroke represents a slash across which
50me guessing is poSSible, in one direction or in both. The
problem, then, is to spell out what sorts of 'relationships, cor-
respondences, etc., cross or transcend this oblique stroke.
Consider the case in which I say to you, "It's raining," and
you guess that if you look out the window you will see
raindrops. A similar diagram will serve:
[Cbuaderlltlel of ''It'. ralnlng"/perception of m1ndropo]
Notice, however, that this case is by no means sinlple.
Only if you know the language and have some trust in my
veracity will you be able to make a guess about the rain-
drops. In fact, few people in this situation restrain them-
selves from seemingly duplicating their information by look-
ing out of the window. We like to prove that our guesses are
right, and that our friends are honest. Still mor~ important,
we like to test or verify the correctness of our view of our
relationship to others.
This last point is nontrivial. It illustrates the necessarily
hierarchic structure of all communicational systems: the fact
of conformity or nonconformity (or indeed any other rela-
tionship) between parts ofa patterned whole may itself be "
informative as part of some still larger whole. The matter may
be diagram~edthus:
[(''It'. raining" /mIndrop.)hon-me relatloll8blp]
where redundancy across the slash mark within the smalle :
universe enclosed in round brackets proposes (is a messa
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
133
about) a redundancy in the larger universe enclosed in
square brackets.
Bu: the message "It's raining" is itself conventionally coded
and mternally patterned, so that several slash mar~ could
be drawn across the message indicating patterning within
the message itself.
'
And the same is true of the rain. It, too, is patterned and
struct:ure~. From the direction of one drop, I could predict
the dllection of others. And so on.
B,ut the slash marks across the verbal message "It's rain..
ing' wlU not.correspond in ffny simple way to the slash marks
across the raindrops.
If, inst?ad of a verbal message, I had given you a picture
of the ram, so~e of the slashes on the picture would have
corresponded Wlth slashes on the perceived rain.
T~s ~iffer~~ce pro~~es a neat formal criterion to separate
the arbItrary and digItal coding characteristic-of the verbal
part of language from the iconic coding of depiction.
B~t v?rbal des.c~ption is often iconic in its larger structure.
A SCIentist descnbmg an earthworm might start at the head
?nd .an~ "":ork down its length-thus producing a description

se~uence and elongation. Here again we ob-
serv~ a ?lerarchic structuring, digital or verbal at one level
and lcot11C at another.
Levels and Logical Types
"L~ve~" have been mentioned: (a) It was noted that the
com~matwn of th~ message "It's raining" with the perception
.of ramdrops can Itself constitute a message about a universe
of personal relations; and (b) that when we change our
focus of attention from smaller to larger units of message
mat~rial, we may discover that a larger unit contains iconic
codmg though the smaller parts of, which it was made are
verbal: the verbal description of an earthworm may
as a
whole, be elongated.
'
The matter of levels now crops up in another form which
is crucial for any epistemology of art:
The word "know" is not merely ambiguous in covering
both connaZtre (to know through the senses to r~COgnize or
perceive) and savoir (to know in the mind), but varies-
b!\

-whether of action, perception, or thought) sinks to deeper
and deeper levels of the mind. This phenomenon, which is
central to Zen diScipline (cf. Herrigel, Zen in the Art of
Archery), is also relevant to all art and all skill.
(2) Adalbert Ames' demonstrations that the conscious,
three-dimensional visual images, which we make of that
which we see, are made by processes involving mathematical
premises of perspective, etc., of the use of which we are
totally unconscious. Over these processes, we have no volun-
tary control. A drawing of a chair with the perspective of
van Gogh affronts the conscious expectations and, dimly,
reminds the consciousness of what had been (unconsciously)
taken for granted.
.
(3) The
Freudian
(especially
FenicheI's)
theory
of
dreams as metaphors coded according to primary process.
I shall consider style-neatness, boldness of contrast, etc.-
as metaphoric and therefore as linked to those levels of the
mind where primary process holds sway.
(4) The Freudian view of the unconscious as the cellar
or cupboard to which fearful and painful memories are con-
signed by a process of repression.
Classical Freudian theory assumed that dreams were a
secondary product, created by "dream work," Material unac-
ceptable to conscious thought was supposedly translated into
the metaphoric idiom of primary process to avoid waking the
dreamer. And this may be true of those items of information
which are held in the unconscious by the process of repres-
sion. As we have seen, however, many other sorts of informa-
tion are inaccessible to conscious inspection, including most
of the premises of mammalian interaction. It would seem to
me sensible to think of these items as existing primarily in
the idiom of primary process, only with difficulty to be trans-
.lated into "rational" terms. In other words, I believe that
much of early Freudian theory was upSide down. At that
time many thinkers regarded conscious reason as normal and
self-explanatory while the unconscious was regarded as mys-
terious, needing proof, and needing explanation. Repression
was the explanation, and the unConscious was filled with
thoughts which could have been conscious but which repres-
sion and dream work had distorted. Today we think. of con-
sciousness as the mysterious, and of the computational meth-

actively shifts-in meaning for basic systemic reasons. That
which we know through the senses can become knowledge

In all cases, we deal with a redundancy or patternmg 0
a quite complex sort:
[("I know • • /'/DJ7 mlDdl//l1Ie road]
and the difficulty is to determine the nature of the patterning
within the round brackets, or, to put the ma~er another
way: what parts of the mind are redundant WIth the par-
ticular message about "knowing,"
.
Last, there is a special form of "knowing" 'Yhich ~ usually
regarded as adaptation rather than information. A shark IS
beautifully shaped for locomotion in water, but th~ genome
of the shark surely does not contain direct information about
hydrodynamics. Rather, the genome must be supposed to
contain information or instructions which are the complement
of hydrodynamics. Not hydrodynamiCS, but wha~ hydrody-
namics requires, has been built up in the shark s genome.
Similarly a migratory bird perhaps does not 'know the way to
its des~ation in any of the senses outlined above, but the
bird may contain the complementary instructiOl;1s necessary
to cause it to fly right.

the mind has been discussed from many pomts of ~ew, at
least four of which must be mentioned and woven mto any
scientific approach to art:
.
(1) Samuel Butler's insistence that the better an.orga~

edge, i.e., there is a process whereby knowledge (or 'habIt".

136
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
ods of the unconscious, e.g., primary process, as continually
active, necessary, and all-embracing.
These conSiderations are especially relevant in any at-
tempt to derive a theory of art or poetry. Poetry is not a sort
of distorted and decorated prose, but rather prose is poetry
which has been stripped down and pinned to a Procrustean
bed of logic. The computer men Who would. program the
translation of languages sometimes forget this fact about the
primary nature of language. To try to construct a machine
to translate the art of one culture into the art of another
would be equally silly.
Allegory, at best a distasteful sort of art, is an inversion
of the normal creative process. Typically an abstract relation,
e.g., between truth and justice, is Drst conceived in rational
terms. The relationship is then metaphorized and dolled up
to look like a product of primary process. The abstractions are
personified and made to participate in a pseudomyth, and
so on. Much advertising art is allegorical in this sense, that
the creative process is inverted.
In the cliche system of Anglo-Saxons, it is commonly as-
sumed that it would be somehow better if what is uncon-
scious were made conscious. Freud, even, is said to have
said, "Where id was, there ego shall be," as though such an
increase in conscious knowledge and control would be both
possible and, of course, an improvement. This view is the
product of an ahnost totally distorted epistemology and a
totally distorted view of what sort of thing a man, or any
other organism, is.
Of the four sorts of unconsciousness listed above, it is very
clear that the Drst three are necessary. Consciousness, for
obvious mechanical reasons,l must always be limited to a
rather small fraction of mental process. If useful at all, it
must therefore be husbanded. The unconsciousness associ-
ated with habit is an economy both of thought a~d of con-
sciousness; and the same is true of the inaccessability of the
processes of perception. The conscious organism does not
require (for pragmatic purposes) to know how it perceives
-only to know what it perceives. (To suggest that we might

set which would report upon its screen all the working';,':"
of its component parts, including especially those parti
concerned in this reporting.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind

operate without a foundation in primary process would be to
suggest that the human brain ought to be differently struc-
tured.) O~ the four types, only the Freudian cupboard for
skeletons IS perhaps undesirable and could be obviated But
the
there. ~ay still be advantages in keeping the
skeleto~ off
dInIng room table.
In tr~th, our life is such that its unconscious components
~: c?ntinuously.pres~nt in all their multiple forms. It follows
t m our relationships we continuously exchange messages
afout these unconscious materials, and it becomes important
a so to exchange metamessl'iges by which we tell each other
whathorder and species of unconsciousness (or consciousness)
attac es to our messages.
In a merely pragm~tic way, this is important because the
orders of truth are ~fferent for different sorts of messages.
Inso~ar as a message IS conscious and voluntary, it could be
deceitful..I can tell you that the cat is on the mat when- in
fact she IS not there. I can tell you "I love you" when in
fact I do ~ot. But discourse about relationship is commonly
acco~p~med by.a mass of semivoluntary kinesic and auto-
nomIC Signals which prOvide a more trustworthy comment on
the verbal message.
Similarly with skill, the fact of skill indicates the presence
of large unconscious components in the performance.
It thus. becomes relevant to look at any work of art with
the question: What components of this message material had
wh~t orders ?f unconsciousness (or consciousness) for the
artIst? And this question, I believe, the sensitive critic usually
asks, though perhaps not consciously.
Art becomes, in this sense, an exercise in communicating
about the species .of unconscious?ess. Or, if you prefer it, a
sort of p!ay behaVIor Whose function is, amongstother things,

as a body of logic or computation as precise and complex as
the reasons of consciousness.
(I have noticed that Anglo-Saxon anthropologists some-
times misunderstand the writings of Claude Levi-Strauss for
precisely this reason. They say he emphasizes too much the
intellect and ignores the "feelings.'" The truth is that he as-
sumes that the heart has precise algorithms.)
These algorithms of the heart, or, as they say, of the un-
conscious, are, however, coded and organized in a manner
totally different from ilie algorithms of language. And since
a great deal of conscious thought is structured in terms of
the logics of language, the algorithms of the unconscious
are doubly inaccessible. It is not only that the conscious
mind has poor access to this material, but also the fact that
when such access is achieved, e.g., in dreams, art, poetry,
religion, intoxication, and the like, there is still a formidable
problem of translation.
This is usually expressed in Freudian language by saying
that the operations of the unconscious are structured in terms
of primary process, while the thoughts of consciousness (es-
pecially verbalized thoughts)
are expressed in secondary
process.
Nobody, to my knowledge, knows anything about secon-
dary process. But it is ordinarily assumed that everybody
knows all about it, so I shall not attempt to describe secon-
dary process in any detail, assuming that you know as much
about it as T.
Primary process is characterized (e.g., by FenicheI) as
lacking negatives, lacking tense, lacking in any identification
of linguistic mood (i.e., no identification of indicative, sub-
junctive, optative, etc.) and metaphOriC. These characteriza-
tions are based upon the experience of psychoanalysts, who
must interpret dreams and the patterns of free association.
It is also true that ilie subject matter of primary-process
discourse is different from the subject matter of language and
consciousness. Consciousness talks about things or persons,
and attaches predicates to the specific things or persons
which have been mentioned. In primary process the things
or persons are usually not identified, and the focus of the
discourse is upon the relationships .which are asserted to ob-
.tain between iliem. This is really only anofuer way of saying
that the discourse of primary process is metaphoric. A meta-

/
140
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
phor retains unchanged the relationship which it "illustrates"
while substitutiDg other things or persons for the relata. In
a simile, the fact that a metaphor is being used is marked
by the insertion of the words "as if" or "like." In primary
process (as in art) there are no markers to indicate to the
conscious mind that the message material is metaphoric.
(For a schizophrenic, it is a major step towards a more
conventional sanity when he can frame ibis schizophrenic ut-
terances or the comments of his voices in an "as if" terminol-
ogy.)
The focus of "relationship" is, however, somewhat more
narrow than would be indicated merely by saying that pri-
mary-process material is metaphoric and does not identify the
specific relata. The subject matter of dream and other pri-
~ary-process material is, in fact, relationship in the more
narrow sense of relationship between self and other persons
or between self and the environment.
Anglo-Saxons Who are. uncomfortable with the idea that
feelings and emotions are the outward signs of precise and
complex algorithms usually have to be told that these matters,
the relationship.between self and others, and the relationship
between self and environment, are, in fact, the subject matter
of what are called "feelings"-love, hate, fear, confidence,
anxiety, hostility, etc. It is unfortunate that these abstractions
referring to patterns of relationship have received names,
which are usually 'handled in ways that assume that the "feel-
ings" are mainly characterized by quantity rather than by
precise pattern. This is one of the nonsensical contributions
of psychology to a distorted epistemology.
,
Be all that as it may, for our present purposes it is impor-
tant to note that the characteristics of primary process as
described above are the inevitable characteristics of any com-
municational system between organisms who must use only
iconic communication. This same limitation is characteristio
of the artist and of the dreamer and of the prehuman mam-
mal or bird. (The communication of insects is, perhaps, an-
other matter.)
In iconic communication, there is no tense, no simple nega-
tive, no modal marker.
The absence of simple negatives is of especial interest be-
cause it often forces organisms into saying the opposite of
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
141
what they mean in order to get across the propOsition that
they mean the opposite of what they say.
Two dogs approach each other and need to exchange the
me~sage: "We are not going to fight." But the only way in
which fig?t can be mentio?ed in iconic communication is by
~e showmg of
u fangs..It IS then necessary for the dogs to.
discover that this mention of fight was, in fact, only explora-
tory. They must, therefore, explore what the showing of fangs
means. They therefore engage in a brawl; discover that nei-
ther ultimately intends to kill the other; and, after that, they
can be friends.

Islanders. Consider also the functions of inverted statement

In general, the discourse ·of animals is concerned with rela-
tionship either between self and other or self and environ-
me~t. In neither, case is it necessary to identify the relata.
Animal A tells B about his relationship with B and he tells
C about his relationship with C. Animal A does not have
to tell animal C ~bout his relationship with B.. Always the
relata are perceptibly present to illustrate the discourse and
always the discourse is iconic in the sense of being composed
of part actions ("intention movements") which mention the
whole action which is being mentioned. Even when the cat
asks you for milk, she cannot mention the object which she
wants (unless it be perceptibly present)

All ~s
~dicates that primary-process thoughts and the
c:ommumcation of such thoughts to others are, in an evolu-
~onary sense, more archaic than the more conscious opera-
tions of. language, etc. This has implications for the whole
economics and dynamic structure of the mind. Samuel Butler
was perhaps first to point out that that which we know best
is that of which we are least conscious, i.e., that the process
of ha?it formation is a s~g of lmowledge down to less
consCIous and more archaiC levels. The unconscious contains
not .only the' painful matters which consciousness prefers to
not mspect, but also many matters which are so familiar that
we do not need to inspect them. Habit, therefore, is a major
economy of conscious thought. We can do things without

143
ring in the circuit structure which we have just added. And
so on.
Clearly, the problem is insoluble, and every next step in
the approach to total consciousness will involve a great in-
crease in the circuitry required.
It follows that all organisms must be content with rather
little consciousness, and that if consciousness has any useful
functions whatever (which has never been demonstrated but
is probably true), then economy in consciousness will be of
the first importance. No organism can afford to be conscious
of matters with which it could deal at unconscious levels.
This is the economy achieved by habit formation.
Qualitative Limits of Consciousness
It is, of course, true for the TV set that a satisfactory pic-
ture on the screen is an indication that many parts of the
machine are working as they should; and similar considera-
tions apply to the "screen" of consciousness. But what is pro-·
vided is only a very indirect report of the working of all those
parts. If the TV suHers from a blown tube, or the man from
a stroke, effects of this pathology may be evident enough
on the screen or to consciousness, but diagnosis must still
be done by an expert.
This matter has bearings upon the nature of art. The TV
which gives a distorted or otherwise imperfect picture is, in
a sense, communicating about its unconscious pathologies-
exhibiting its symptoms; and one may ask whether some ar-
tists are not doing something similar. But this still won't do.
lt is sometimes said that the distortions of art (say, van
Gogh's "Chair") are directly representative of what the artist
"sees:' If such statements refer to "seeing" in the simplest
physical sense (e.g., remediable. with spectacles), I presume
that they are nonsense. If van Gogh could only see the chair
in that wild way, his eyes would not serve properly to guide
ihim in the very accurate placing of paint on canvas. And,
conversely, a photographically accurate representation of the
chair on the canvas would· also be seen by van Gogh in the
wild way. He would see no need to distort the painting.
.
But suppose we say that the artist is painting today what
he saw yesterday-or that he is painting what he somehow
Quantitative_Limits of Consciousness
A very brief consideration of the problem shows that it
is not conceivably possible for any system to be totally con-
scious. Suppose that on the screen of consciousness there are
reports from many parts of the total mind, and consider the
addition to consciousness of those reports necessary to cover .
what is, at a given stage of evolution, not already covered.
This addition will involve a very great increase in the circuit
.
structure of the brain but still will not achieve total coverage.<
The next step will be to cover the processes and events occur- ."
142
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
consciously thinking about them. The skill of an artist, or
rather his demonstration of a skill, becomes a message about
these parts of his unconsciousness. (But not perhaps a mes-
sage from the unconscious.)
But the matter is not quite so simple. Some types of knowl-
edge can conveniently be sunk to unconscious levels, but
other types must be kept on the surface. Broadly, we can
afford to sink those sorts of knowledge which continue to
be true regardless of changes in the environment, but we
must maintain in an accessible place all those controls of be-
havior which must be modified for every instance. The lion
can sink into his unconscious the proposition that zebras are
his natural prey, but in dealing with any particular zebra
he must be able to modify the movements of his attack to
fit with the particular terrain and the particular evasive tac-
tics of the particular zebra.
.
The economics of the system, in fact, pushes orgamsms
toward sinking into the unconscious those generalities of I~la­
tionship which remain permanently true and toward keepmg
within the conscious the pragmatics of particular instanc~.
The premises may, economically, be sunk, but particular
conclusions must be conscious. But the "sinking," though ec0-
nomical, is still done at a priee--'the price of inacces.sibility.
Since the level to which things are sunk is charactenzed by
iconic algorithms and metaphor, it becomes difficult for the
organism to examine the matrix out of which his
conscio~s
conclusions spring. Conversely, we may note that what
IS
common to a particular statement and a corresponding meta-
phor is of a generality appropriate for sinking.

sciousness. It is not merely the selectivity of preference
whereby the skeletons 'accumulate in the Freudian uncon:
scious, that makes such extrapolation unsound. Such a selec-
tion by preference would only promote optimism.
.What is serious is the crosscutting of the circUitry of the
mmd. If, as we must believe; the total mind is an integrated
network (of propositions, images, processes, neural pathol-
ogy, or what have you-according to what scientific language
you prefer to use), and if the content of consciousness is
only a sampling of different parts and localities in this net-
work; then, inevitably, the conscious view of the network as
a whole is a monstrous deniaI of the integration of that whole.
From ~e cutting ~f ~ns~iousness, what appears above the
surface IS arcs of ClrCWts mstead of either the complete cir-
cuits or the larger complete circuits of circuits.
What tJ:1e unaided consciousness (unaided by art, dreams, .
and the like) can never appreciate is the systemic nature
of mind.
~. notion can conv~niently be illustrated by an analogy:
the livmg human body IS a complex, cybernetically integrated
system. This system has been studied by, scientists-mostly
medical men-for many years. What they now know about
the body may aptly be compared with what the unaided con-
sciousness knows about the mind. Being doctors, they had
purposes: to cure this and that. Their research efforts were
therefore focused (as attention focuses the consciousness)
upon those short trains of causality which they could manipu-
late, by means of drugs or other intervention to correct more
or less Specific and identifiable states or symptoms. Whenever
they discovered an effective "cure" for something, research
in that area ceased and attention was directed elsewhere. We
can now prevent polio, but nobody knows much more about
!he systemic asp~ts of that fascinating disease. Research on

the artist's message about his relationship to the animal-his
empathy.
(They say the Altamira things were made for sympathetic
hunting magic. But magic only needs the crudest sort of rep-
resentations. The scrawled arrows which deface the beautifu1'~

to murder the artist, like moustaches scrawled on the Mona
Lisa.)

The question has been: Does the art tell us about what
sort of person made it? But if art, as suggested above, has a
positive function in maintaining what I called "wisdom," i.e.,
in correcting a too purposive view of life and making the
view more-systemic, then the question to be asked of the
given work of .art becomes: What sorts of correction in the
direction of wisdom would be achieved by creating or view-
ing this work of art?
The question becomes dynamic rather than static.
Analysis of Balinese Painting
Turning now from the consideration of epistemology to a
specific art style, we note first what is most general and
most obvious.
With almost no exceptions, the behaviors called art or
their products
(also called art)
have two characteristics:
they require ot exhibit skiU, and they contain redundancy
or pattern.
But those two characteristics are not separate: the skill
is first in maintaining and then in modulating the redun-
dancies.
The matter is perhaps most clear where the skill is that
of the journeyman, and the redundancy is of comparatively
low order. For example, in the Balinese painting by Ida
Bagus Djati Sura of the village of Batuan, 1937 and in almost
all p~ting ~f ~e. Batuan school, skill of a certain elementary
but highly disCiplined sort was exercised or practiced in the
background of foliage. The redundancies to be achieved in-
volve rather urmorm and rhythmical repetition of leaf forms
but this redundancy is, so to speak, fragile. It would
b~
broken or interrupted by smudges or irregularities of size or
tone in the painting of the successive leaves.
When a Batuan artist looks at the work of another, one of
the first things he examines is the technique of the leafy
background. The leaves are first drawn, in free outline in
pencil; then each outline is. tightly, redefined with pen and
black ink. When this has been done for all the leaves, the
artist begins to paint with brush and Chinese ink. Each leaf is
covered with a pale wash. When these washes are dry, each
leaf receives a smaller concentric wash and after this. another
146
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
chain is part of some large or small circuit structure of sys-
tem. And the remainder of our technology (of which medical
science is only a part) bids fair to disrupt the rest of our
ecology.
The point, however, which I am trying to make in this
paper is not an attack on medical science but a demonstration
of an inevitable fact: that mere purposive rationality unaided
by such phenomena as art, religion, dream, and the like, is
necessarily pathogenic and destructive of life; and that its
virulence springs specifically from the circumstance that life =1
depends upon interlocking circuits of contingency, while con-
sciousness can see only such short arcs of such circuits as
human purpose may direct.
In a word, the unaided consciousness must always involve
man in the sort of stupidity of which evolution was guilty
when she urged upon the dinosaurs the common-sense values
of an armaments race. She inevitably realized her mistake
a million years later and Wiped them out.
Unaided consciousness must always tend toward hate; not,
only because it is good common sense to exterminate the.
other fellow, but for the more profound reason that, seeing
only arcs of circuits, the individual is continually surprised
and necessarily angered when his hardheaded policies re-
turn to plague the inventor.
If you use DDT to kill insects, you may succeed in re-
ducing the insect population so far that the insectivores
will starve. You will then have to use more DDT than be-
fore to kill the insects which the birds no longer eat. More.
probably, you will kill off the birds in the first round when
they eat the poisoned insects. If the DDT kills 'off the dogs, "
you will have to have more police to keep down the burglars.. '1
The burglars will become better armed and more cunning'

That is the sort of world we live in-a world of circuit!f
structures-and love can survive only if wisdom (i.e., a sense:'
or recognition of the fact of circuitry) has an effective voice.,i,
What has been said so far proposes questions about any-,
particular work of art' somewhat different from those which
have been conventionally asked by anthropologists. The "cul-

structure of the wood. A special "effect" is achieved, not by
the mere representationalism, but by the perceiver's partial
awareness that a physical system other than that of draftsman-
ship has contributed to determine his perception.
We now turn to more complex matters, still concen-
trating attention upon the most obvious and elementary.
Composition
,(I) The delineation of leaves and other forms does not
reach to 'the edge of the picture but shades off into darkness
so that almost all around the rectangle there is a band of
undifferentiated dark pigment. In other words, the picture is
framed within its own fade-out. We are allowed to feel
that the matter is in some sense "out of this world"; and
this in spite of the fact that the scene depicted is familiar-
the starting out of a cremation procession.
,
(2) The picture is filled. The composition leaves no open
spaces. Not only is none of the paper left unpainted, but
no considerable area is left in uniform wash. The largest
such areas are the very dark patches at the bottom between
the legs of the men.
To Occidental eyes, this gives an effect of "fussiness."
To psychiatric eyes, the effect is of "anxiety" or "compul-
sivity." We are all familiar with the strange look of those
letters from cranks, who feel that they must fill the page.
(3) But before trying too fast to diagnose or evaluate,
we have to note that the composition of the lower half of
the picture, apart from this filling of background space, is
turbulent. Not merely a depiction.of active figures, but a
swirling composition mounting upwards and closed off by the
contrasting direction of the gestures of the men at the top
of the pyramid.
The upper half of the picture, in contrast, is serene.
Indeed, the effect of the perfectly balanced women with
offerings on their heads is so serene that, at first glance, it
appears that the men with musical instruments must surely
be sitting. (They are supposed to be moving in procession.)
But this compositional structure is the reverse of the usual
Occidental. We expect the lower part of a picture to be the
148

still smaller, and so on. The final result is a leaf wi~ an al- .

washes on every leaf. (This part;i.cu ar pamting IS no
very
~
"good" in this sense. The leaves are done in only three or
four steps.)
The skill and the patterning so far discussed depend upon
muscular rote and muscular accuracy-achieving the per-
haps not negligible artistic level of a well-laid out field of
turnips.

You have to be able to do that without thinking.
But on top of this level of redundancy is another. The
uniformity of the lower-level redundancy must be modulated
to give higher orders of redundancy. The leaves in one area
must be different from the leaves in another area, and these
differences must be in some way mutually redundant: they
must be part of a larger pattern.
Indeed the function and necessity of the first-level control
is
precis~ly to make the second level possible. The per-
ceiver of the work of art must receive information that the
artist can paint a uniform area of leaves because. ~thout
this information 'he will not. be able to accept as SIgnificant
the variations in that uniformity.
'
Only the'violinist who can control the quality of his notes
can use variations of that quality for musical purposes.
.~
This principle is basic and accounts, I suggest,
~or the ,W
almost universal linkage in aesthetics between skill and
pattern. The exceptions-e.g., the cult of natural landscapes,
"found objects," inkblots, scattergrams, and the works of
Jackson Pollock-seem to exemplify the same rule in reverse.
In these cases, a larger patterning seems to propose the
illusion that the details must have been controlled. Inter-
mediate cases also occur: e.g., in Balinese carving, the natu-
ral grain of the wood is rather frequently used to suggest de- ,
tails of the form or surface of the subject. In these cases, the .
skill lies not in the draftsmanship of the details, but in the '.,
artist's placement of his design within the three-dimensional

more stable and expect to see action and movement in the
upper part-if anywhere.
.
(4) At this point, it is appropriate to examine the picture
as a sexual pun and, in this connection, the internal evidence
for sexual reference is at least as strong as it is in the case'of
the Tangaroa figure discussed by Leach. All you have to
do is to set your mind in the correct posture and you will
see an enormous phallic object (the cremation tower) with
two elephants' heads at the base. This object must pass
through a narrow entrance into a serene courtyard and thence
onward and upward through a still more narrow passageway.
Around the base of the phallic object you see a turbulent
mass of homunculi, 'a crowd in which
Was none who would be foremost
To lead such dire attack;
But those behind cried "Forwardl"
And those before cried "Backl"
And if you are so minded, you will find that Macaulay's
poem about how Horatius kept the bridge is no less sexual
than the present picture. The game of sexual interpretation
is easy if you want to play it. No doubt the snake in .the
tree to the left of' the picture could also be woven into the
sexual story.
It is still possible, however, that something is added to
our understanding of a work of art by the hypothesis
that the subject matter is double: that the picture repre-
sents both the start of a cremation procession and a phallus
with vagina. With a little imagination, we could also see
the picture as a symbolic r~presentation of Balinese social
organization in which the smooth relations of etiq?ette and
gaiety metaphorically cover the turbulence of passlOn. And,
of course, "Horatius" is very evidently an idealized myth' of
nineteenth-century imperial England.
It is probably an error to think of dream, myth, and art
as being about anyone matter other than relationship. As
was mentioned earlier, dream is metaphoric and is not par-
ticularly 'about the relata mentioned in the dream. In the
conventional interpretatiori of dream, another set of relata,
often- sexual, is substituted for the' set in the dream. But
perhaps by doing this we only create another dream. There
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
151
indeed is no a priori reason for supposing that the sexual
relata are any more primary or basic than any other set.
In general, artists are very unwilling to accept interpre-
tations of this sort, and it is not clear that their objection is
to the sexual nature of the interpretation. Rather, it seems
that rigid focusing upon any single set of relata destroys
for the artist the more profound significance of the work.
If the picture were only about sex or only about social
organization, it would be trivial. It is nontrivial or profound
precisely because it is about sex and social organization and
cremation, and other things. In a word, it is only about re-
lationship and not about any identifiable relata.
(5) It is appropriate then to ask how the artist has
handled the identification of his subject matter within the
picture. We note first that the cremation ,tower which oc-
cupies almost one-third of the picture is almost invisible.
It does not stand out against its background as it should
if the artist wanted to assert unequivocally "this is a crema-
tion." Notably also, the coffin, which might be expected to
be a focal point, is appropriately placed just. below the
center but even so does not catch the eye. In fact, the
artist has inserted details which label the picture as a cre-
mation scene but these details become almost whimsical
asides, like the snake and the little birds in the trees. The
women are carrying the ritually correct offerings on their
heads, and two men appropriately bring bamboo containers
of palm toddy, but these details, too, are only whimsically
added. The artist plays down the subject identification and
thereby gives major stress to the contrast between the
turbulent and the serene mentioned in 3, above.
(6) In sum, it is my opinion that the crux of the pic-
ture is the interwoven contrast between the serene and the
turbulent. And a similar contrast or combination was also
present, as we have seen, in the painting of the leaves.
There, too, an exuberant freedom was overlaid by precision.
In terms of this conclusion, I can now attempt an answer
to the question posed above: What sorts of correction,
in the direction of systemic wisdom, could be achieved by
creating or viewing this work of art? In final analysis, the
picture can be seen as an affirmation that to choose either
turbulence or serenity as a hwnan purpose would be a. vul-
gar error. The conceiving and creating of the picture must

152
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
have provided an experience which exposed this err?r. The
unity and integration of the picture assert that ne1t?er of
these contrasting poles can be chosen to the exclusIOn
~f
the other, because the poles are mutually dependent. This
profound and general truth is simultaneously asserted for the

Since World War II, it has been fashionable to engage
in "interdisciplinary" research, and this usually means, for
example, that an ecologist will need a geologist to tell him
about the rocks and soils of the particular terram which
he is investigating. But there is another sense in which scien-
tific work may claim to be interdisciplinary.
The man who studies the arrangement of leaves and
branches in the growth of a flowering plant may note an
analogy between the formal relations between stems, leaves,
and buds, and the formal relations that obtain between differ-
ent sorts of words in a sentence. He will think of a "leaf"
not as something flat and green but as something related
in a particular way to the stem from which it grows and
to the secondary stem (or bud) which is formed in the
angle between leaf and primary stem. Similarly the modem
linguist thinks of a "noun" not as the "name of a person,
place, or thing," but as a member of a class of words de-
fined by their relationship in sentence structure to "verbs"
and other parts.
Those who think :first of the "things" which are related
(the "relata") will dismiss any analogy between grammar
and the anatomy of plants as far-fetched. After all, a leaf
and a noun do not at all resemble each other in outward
appearance. But if we think :first 'ofthe relationships and
consider the relata as defined solely by their relationships,
then we begin to wonder. Is there a profound analogy
between grammar and anatomy? Is there an interdisciplin-
153

154
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
ary science which should concern itself with such analogies?
What would such a science claim as its subject matter? And
why should. we expect such far-flung analogies to have
significance?
In dealing with any analogy, it is important to define
exactly what is claimed when we say that. the analogy is
meaningful. In the present example, it is not claimed that
a noun should look like a leaf. It is not even claimed that
the relation between leaf and stem is the same as the rela-
tion between noun and verb. What is claimed is, first, that
in both apatomy and grammar the parts are to be classified
according to the relations between them., In both fields, the
relations are to be thought of as somehow primary, the relata
as secondary. Beyond this, it is claimed that' the relations
are of the sort generated by processes of information ex-
change.
In other words, the mysterious and polymorphic rela-
tion between context and content obtains in b'oth anatomy
and linguistics; and evolutionists of the nineteenth century,
preoccupied with what were called "homologies," were,. in
fact, studying precisely the contextual structures of biolog-
ical development.
'
All of this speculation be~omes almost platitude when we
realize that both grammar and biological structure are prod-
ucts of communicational and organizational process. The
anatomy of the plant is a complex transform of genotypic
instructions, and the '1anguage" of the genes, like any other
language, must of neceSSity ihave contextual structure. More-
over, in all communication, there must be a relevance be-
tween the contextual structure of the message and some
structuring of the recipient. The tissues of the plant could
not "read" the genotypic instructions carried in the chromo-
somes of every cell unless cell and tissue eXist, at that
given moment, in a contextual structure.
What has been said above will serve as sufficient defi-
nition of what is here meant by "form and pattern." The
focus of discussion was upon form rather than content, upon
context rather than upon what' occurs "in" the given con-
text, upon relationship rather than upon the related per-
sons or phenomena.
The essays included range £rom a discussion of "schis-

mogenesis" (1935) to two essays written after the birth
of cybernetics.
.
In 1935, I certainly had not clearly grasped the central
importance of "context." I thought that the processes of scms-
mogenesis were important and nontrivial because in them
I seemed to see evolution at work: if interaction between
persons could undergo progressive qualitative change as in-
tensity increased, then surely this could be the very stuff
of cultural evolution. It followed that all directional change,
even in biological evolution and phylogeny, might-or must
-be due to progressive interaction between organisms. Un-
der natural selection, such change in relationships would
favor progressive change in anatomy and physiology.
The progressive increase in size and armament of the
dinosaurs was, as I saw it, simply an interactive armaments
race-a schismogenic process. But I could not then see that
the evolution of the horse from Eohippus was not a one-sided
adjustment to life on grassy plains. Surely the grassy plains
themselves were evolved pari passu with the evolution of
the teeth and hooves of the horses and other ungulates.
Turf was the evolving response of the vegetation to the
evolution of the horse. It is the context which evolves.
The classification of schismogenic process into "symmetri_
cal" and "complementary" was already a classification of con-
texts of behavior; and, already in this essay, there is a
proposal to examine the possible combinations of themes in
complementary behavior. By 1942, I had completely for-
gotten this old proposal, but I attempted to do precisely
what I had proposed seven years previously. In 1942 many
of us were interested in "national character" and the con-
trast between England and America fortunately brought
into focus the fact that "spectatorship" is in England a
filial characteristic, linked with dependency and submission,
while in America spectatorship is a parental characteristic
linked with dominance and succoring.
'
This hypothesis, which I called "end-linkage," marked a
turning point in my thinking. From that time on, I have
consciously focused upon the qualitative 'structure of con-
texts rather than upon intensity of interaction. Above all,
the phenomena of end-linkage showed that contextual struc-
tures could themselves be messages--an important point
which is not made in the 1942 article. An Englishman when

156
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
he is applauding another is indicating or signaling potential
submission and/or dependency; when he shows off or de-
mands spectatorship, he is signaling dominance or supe-
riority; and so on. Every Englishman who writes a book
must be guilty of this. For the American, the converse
must hold. His boasting is but a bid for quasiparental ap- ,
provaI.
The notion of context reappears
in the essay "Style,
Grace, and Information in Primitive Art," but here the idea
of context has evolved to meet the related ideas of "re-
dundancy," "pattern," and "meaning."

stances will a dog learn to salivate in response to a bell?" or,
"What variables govern success in rote learning?" Our ques-
tion is one degree more abstract, and, in a sense, bridges the
gap between the experimental work on simple learning and
the approach of the gestalt psychologists. We are asking,
"How does the dog acquire a habit of punctuating or ap-
perceiving the infinitely complex stream of events (includ-
ing his own behavior) so that this stream appears to be
made up of one type of short sequences rather than an-
other?" Or, substituting the scientist for the dog, we might
ask, "What circumstances. determine that a given scientist
will punctuate the stream of events so as to conclude that
all is predetennined, while another will see the str.eam of
events as so regular as to' be susceptible of control?" Or,
again, on the same level of abstraction let us ask-and this
question is very relevant to the promotion of democracy-
"What circumstances promote that specific habitual phras-
ing of the universe which we caII 'free will' and those others
which we call 'responsibility: 'constructiveness: 'energy:
'passivity: 'dominance: and the rest?" For all these abstract
qualities, the essential stock-in-trade of the educators, can
be seen as various habits of punctuating the stream of ex-
perience so that it takes on one or another sort of coherence
and sense. They are abstractions which begin to assume
some operational meaning when we see. them take their
place on a conceptual level between the statements of
Simple learning and those of gestalt psychology.
We can, for example, put our finger very simply on the
process which leads to tragedy and disillusion whenever men
decide that the "end justifies the means" in their efforts
to achieve either a Christian or a blueprintedheaven-on-
earth. They ignore the fact that in social manipulation, the
tools are not hammers and screwdrivers. A screwdriver is
not seriously affected when, in an emergency, we use it as
a wedge; and a hammer's outlook on life is not affected
because we sometime!- use its handle as a simple lever. But
in social manipulation our tools are people, and people learn,
and they acquire habits which are more subtle and per-
vasive than the tricks which the blueprinter teaches them.

in our culture science has had instrumental leanings since
before the Industrial Revolution, and emphasis upon indi-

democratic motif and simultaneous spread of the mstru-
mental motif. Finally, the conflict is now a life-or-death
struggle over the role which the social sciences shall play
in the ordering of human relationships. It is hardly an exag-
geration to say that this war is ideologically about just this-
the role of the social sciences. Are we to reserve the tech-
niques and the right to manipulate people as the
pri~leg.e
of a few planning, goal-oriented, and power-hungry mdi-
viduals, to whom the instrumentality of science makes a
natural appeal? Now that we have the techniques, are we,
in cold blood, going to treat p,eople as things? Or what are
we going to do with these techniques?
The problem is one of very great difficulty as
~eII. as
urgency, and it is doubly difficult because we, as SCIentiSts,
are deeply soaked in habits of instrumental thought-those
of us, at least, for whom science isa part of life, as well
as a beautiful and dignified abstraction.
Let us
try to
surmount this additional source of difficulty by turning the
tools of science upon this habit of instrumental thought and
upon the new habit which Dr. Mead envisages-the habit
which looks for "direction" and "value" in the chosen act,
rather than in defined goals. Clearly, both of these habits
are ways of looking at time sequences. In the old jargon of
psychology, they represent different ways of apperceiving
sequences of behavior, or in the newer jargon of gestalt
psychology, they might both be described as habits of
looking for one or another sort of contextual frame for be-
havior. The problem which Dr. Mead-who advocates a
change in such habits-raises is the problem of how habits
of this abstract order are learned.
This is not the simple type of question which is posed
in most psychological laboratories, "Under what circum-

prejudicial to the success of his blueprint, but because the
children are people they will do more than learn this simple
trick-they will build this experience into their whole phi-
losophy of life; it will color all their future attitudes to-
ward authority. Whenever they meet certain sorts of con-
text, they will tend to see these contexts as structured on
an earlier familiar pattern. The blueprinter may derive an
initial advantage from the children's tricks; but the ultimate
success of his blueprint may be destroyed by the habits
of mind which were learned with the trick. (Unfortunately,
there is no reason to believe that the Nazi blueprint will
break down for these reasons. It is probable that the un-
pleasant attitudes here referred to are envisaged as basic
both to the plan itself and to the means of achieving it.
The road to hell can also be paved with· bad intentions,
though well-intentioned people find this hard to believe.)
We are dealing, apparently, with a sort of habit which is a
by-product of the learning process. When Dr. Mead tells us
that we should leave off thinking in terms of blue-prints and
should instead evaluate our planned acts in terms of their
immediate implicit value, she is saying that in the upbringing
and education of children, we ought to try to inculcate a sort
of by~product habit rather different from that which we ac-
quired and which we daily reinforce in ourselves in our con-
tacts with science, politics, newspapers, and so on.
She states perfectly clearly that this new shift in the em-
phasis or gestalt of our thinking will be a 'setting forth into
uncharted waters. We cannot know what manner of human
beings will result from such a course, nor can we be sure that
we ourselves would feel at horne in the world of 1980. Dr.
Mead can only tell us that if we proceed on the course which
would seem most natural, planning our applications of social
science as a means of attainirig a defined goal, we shall surely
.hit a rock. She has charted the rock for us, and advises that
we embark on a course in a direction where the rock is not;
but in a new, still uncharted direction. Her paper raises the
question of how we are.to chart this new direction.
Actually, science can give us something approaching a
chart. I indicated above that we might see a mixed bunch of
abstract terms-free will, predestination, responsibility, con-
structiveness, passivity, dominance, etc.-as all of them de-

scriptive of apperceptive habits, habitual ways of looking at
the stream of events of which our own behavior is a part, and
further that these habits might all be, in some sense, by-
products of the learning process. Our next task, if we are to
achieve some sort of chart, is clearly to get something better
than a random list of these possible habits. We must reduce
this list to a classification which shall show how each of these
habits is systematically related to the others.
We meet in common agreement that a sense of individual
autonomy, a habit of mind somehow related to what I have
called "free will," is an essential of democracy, but we are
still not perfectly clear as to how this autonomy should be
defined operationally. What, for example, is the relation be-
tween "autonomy" and compulsive negativism? The gas sta-
tions which refuse to conform. to the curfew-are they or are
they not showing a fine democratic spirit? This sort of "nega-
tivism" is undoubtedly of the same degree of abstraction as
"free will" or "determinism"; like them it is an habitual way
of apperceiving contexts, event sequences and own behavior;
but it is not clear whether this negativism is a "subspecies" of
individual autonomy; or is it rather some entirely different
habit? Similarly, we need to know how the new habit of
thought which Dr. Mead advocates is related to the others.
Evidently our need is for something better than a random
list of these habits of mind. We need some systematic frame-
work or classification which shall show how each of these
habits is related to the others, and such a classification might
provide us with something approaching the chart we lack. Dr.
Mead tells us to sail into as yet uncharted waters, adopting
a new habit of thought; but if we knew how this habit is
related to others, we might be able to judge of the benefits
and dangers, the possible pitfalls of such a course. Such a
chart might provide us with the answers to some of the ques-
tions which Dr. Mead raises-as to how we are to judge of
the "direction" and value implicit in our planned acts.
.
You must not expect the social scientist to produce such a
chart or classification at a moment's notice, like a rabbit out
of a hat, but I think we can take a first step in this direction;
we can suggest
som~ of the basic themes-the cardinal
points,if you like--1,lpon which the final classification must
be built.

We have noted that the sorts of habit with which we :ue
concerned are, in some sense, by-products of the learnmg
processes, and it is therefore natural that we lo~k first t~ the
phenomena of simple learning as likely to proVIde us WIth a
clue. We are raising questions one degree more abst:act
than those chiefly studied by the experimental psychologIsts,
but it is still to their laboratories· that we must look for our
answers.
.
.
Now it so happens that in the psychological laboratones
there is acornmon phenomenon of a somewhat higher ~e~ee
of abstraction or generality than those which the experunen~s
are planned to elucidate. It is a commonplace that the expen-
mental subject-whether animal or man, becomes a better
subject after repeated experiments. He not
~nly leams to
salivate at the appropriate moments, or to reClte the appro-
priate nonsense syllables; he also, in some. way, learns to
leam.-He not only solves the problems set him by ~e exper-
imenter where each solving is a piece of simple learmng; but,
more than this, he becomes more and more skilled in the
solving of problems.
In semigestalt or semianthropomorphic
p?raseo~ogy, we
might say that the subject is learning to onent hunself to
certain types of contexts, or is acq?iring "insig~t" into the
contexts of problem solving. In the Jargon o~ this pap.er, we
may say that the -subject has acquired a habIt of looking for
contexts and sequences of one type rather than another, a
habit of "punctuating" the stream of events to give repetitions
of a certain typeof meaningful sequence.
The line of argument which we have f~llowed has. brought
us to a point at which statements about slffiple learmng meet
statements about gestalt and contextual structure, and we
have reached the hypothesis that "learning to learn" is a
synonym for the acquisition of that class of abstract habits of
thought with which this paper is concerned; tha~ th~ states ~f
mind which we call "free will," instrumental thmking, domI-
nance, passivity, etc., are acquired by a process which we
may equate with "learning to leam."
.
This hypothesis is to some extent new2 to psychologists
• Psychological papers bearing upon this problem of the
relationship between gestalt and simple learning are very
numerous, if we include all who have.worked on the

167
as well as to laymen, and therefore I must digress at this
point to supply technical readers with a more precise state-
ment of my meaning. I must demonstrate at least my will-
ingness to state this bridge between Simple learning and
gestalt in operational terms.
Let us coin two words, "proto-learning" and "deutero-
learning," to avoid the labor of defining pperationally all the
other terms in the field (transfer of learning, generalization,
etc., etc.). Let us say that there are two sorts of gradient
discernible in all continued learning. The gradient at any
point on a simple learning curve (e.g., a curve of rote learn-
ing) we will say chiefly represents rat'e of proto-learning. If,
however, we inflict a series of similar learning experiments
on the same subject, we shall find .that in each successive
experiment the subject has a somewhat steeper proto-learn-
ing gradient, that he learns somewhat more rapidly. This
progessive change in rate of proto-learning we will call "deu-
tero-Iearning."
From this point we can easily go on to represent deutero-
learning graphically with a curve whose gradient shall repre-
sent rate of deutero-learning. Such a representation might be
obtained, for example, by intersecting the series of proto-
learning curves at some arbitarily chosen number of trials, and
noting what proportion of successful responses occurred in
each experiment at this point. The curve of deutero-learning
concepts of transfer of learning; generalization irradia-
tion, reaction threshold (Hull), insight, and 'the like.
Historically, one of the first to pose these questions was
Mr. Frank .(L. K. Frank, ''The Problems of Learning,"
Psych. ReVIew, 1926, 33: 329-51; and Professor Maier
has recently introduced a concept of "direction" which
is closely related to the notion of "deutero-learning." He
says: "direction . . . is the force which integrates mem-
ories in a particular manner without being a memory
itself." (N. R. F. Maier, "The Behavior Mechanisms
Concerned with Problem Solving," Psych. Review, 1940,
47: 43-58.) If for "force" we substitute "habit," and for
"memory" we substitute "experience of the stream of
events," the concept of deutero-Iearning can be seen as
almost synonymous with Professor Maier's concept of
"direction."

would then be obtained by plotting these numbers against
the-serial numbers of the experiments.s
In this definition of proto- and
deutero-learning,
one
phrase remains conspicuously vague, the phrase "a series of
similar experiments." For purposes of illustration, I imagined
a series of experiments in rote learning, each experiment
similar to the last, except for the substitution of a new series
of nonsense syllables in place of those already learned. In
this example, the curve of deutero-learning represented in-
creasing proficiency in the business of rote learning, and, as
an experimental fact, such increase in rote proficiency can
be demonstrated.4
Apart from rote learning, it is much more difficult to de-
fine what we mean by saying that one learnIng context is
"similar" to another, unless we are content to refer the
matter back to the experimentalists by saying that learning
contexts shall be considered to be "similar" one to another
whenever it can be shown experimentally that experience
of learning in one context does, as a matter of fact, promote
speed of learning in another, and asking the experimenta-
lists to find out for us what sort of classification they can
build up by use of this criterion. We may hope that they
will do this; but we cannot hope for immediate answers to
our questions, because there are very serious difficulties in
the way of such experimentation. Experiments in simple
learning are already difficult enough to control and to per-
form with critical exactness, and experiments in deutero-
learning are likely to prove almost impossible.
There is, however, an alternative course open to us. When
we equated "learning to learn" with acquiring appercep-
tive habits, this did not exclude the pOSSibility that such

deutero-learning is necessarily somewhat easier than that
of proto-learning. ActuallY, no simple learning curve
represents proto-learning alone. Even within the duration
of the single learning experiment we must suppose that
some deutero-leaming will occur, and this will make the

habits might be acquired in other ways. To suggest that the
only method of acquiring one of these habits is through
repeated experience of learning contexts of a given kind
would be logically analogous to saying that the only way to
roast pig is by burning the house down. It is obvious that in
human education such habits are acquired in very various
ways. We are not concemed with a hypothetical isolated
individual in contact with an impersonal events stream, but
rather with real individuals who have complex emotional
patterns of relationship with other individuals. In such a real
world, the individual will be led to acquire or reject apper-
ceptiv.e habits by the very complex phenomena of personal
example, tone of voice, hostility, love, etc. Many such h_abits,
too, will be conveyed to him, not through his own naked
experience of the stream of events, for no human beings
(not even scientists) are naked in this sense. The events
stream is mediated to them through language, art, technology,
and other cultural media which are structured at every
point by tramlines of apperceptive habit.
It therefore follows that the psychological laboratory is
not the only possible source of knowledge about these habits;
we may turn instead to the contrasting patterns implicit and
explicit in the various cultures of the world studied by the
anthropologists. We can amplify our list of these obscure
habits by adding those which have been developed in cul-
tures other than our own.
Most profitably, I believe, we can combine the insights of
the experimental psychologists with those of the anthropolo-
gists, taking the contexts of experimental learning in. the
laboratory and asking of each what sort of apperceppve habit
we should expect to find
associat~d with it; then looking
around the world for human cultures in which this habit
has been developed. Inversely, we may be able to get a
more definite--more operational-definitionof such habits as
"free will" if we ask about each, "What sort of experimental
learning context would we devise in order to inculcate
.this habitP" "How would we rig the maze or problem-box
so that the anthropomorphic rat shall obtain a repeated and
reinforced impression of his own free will?"
The classification of contexts of experimental learning is
as yet very incomplete, but certain definite advances have

been made.5 It is possible to classify the principal contexts
of positive learning (as distinct from' negative learning or
inhibition, learning not to do things) under four heads, as
follows:
(1) Classical Pavlovian contexts
These are characterized by a rigid time sequence in
which the conditioned stimulus (e.g., buzzer) always pre-
cedes the unconditioned stimulus (e.g., meat powder) by a
fixed interval of time. This rigid sequence of events is not
altered by anything that the animal may do. In these con-
texts, the animal learns to respond to the conditioned stimu-
lus with behavior
(e.g.,
salivation)
which was formerly
evoked only by the unconditioned stimulus.
(2) Contexts of instrumental reward or escape
These are characterized by a sequence which depends
upon the animal's behavior. The unconditioned stimulus in
these contexts is usually vague
(e.g., the whole sum of
circumstances in which the animal is put, the problem-box)
and may be internal to the animal (e.g., hunger). If and
when, under these circumstances, the animal performs some
act within its behavioral repertoire and previously selected
• various classifications have been devised for purposes
of exposition. Here I follow that of HilgEird and Marquis
(E. R. Hilgard and D. G. Marquis, Conditioning and
Learning, New York, Appleton Century Co., 1940). These
authors subject their own classification to a brilliant crit-
ical analysis, and to this anaJysis I am indebted for one
of the formative ideas upon which this paper is based.
They insist that any learning context can be described
in terms of any theory of learning, if we are willing to
stretch and overemphasize certain aspects of the context
to fit onto the Procrustean bed of the theory. I have
taken this notion as a cornerstone of my thinking, sub-
stituting "apperceptive habits" for "theories of learning,"
and arguing that almost any sequence of events can be
stretched and warped and punctuated to fit in with any
type of apperceptive habit. (We may suppose that ex-
perimental neurosis is what happens when the subject
fails to achieve this assimilation.)
I am also indebted to Lewin's topological analysis of
the contexts of reward and punishment.
(K. Lewin,
A Dynamic Theory of Personality, New York, McGraw-
Hill Book Co., 1936.)

by the experimenter (e.g., lifts its leg), it is immediately
rewarded.
(3 ) Contexts of instrumental avoidance
These are also characterized by a conditional sequence.
The unconditioned stimulus is usually definite (e.g., a warn-
ing buzzer) and this is followed by an unpleasant experience
(e.g., eleCtric shock) unless in the interval the animal per-
forms some selected act (e.g., lifts leg).
(4) Contexts of serial and rote learning
These are characterized by the predominant conditioned
stimulus being an act of the subject. He learns, for example,
always to give the conditioned response (nonsense syllable
B)
after he has 'himself uttered the conditioned stimulus
(nonsense syllable A).
This small beginning of a: classification6 will be sufficient to
• Many people feel that the contexts of experimental
learning are so oversimplified as to have no bearing upon
the phenomena of the real world. Actually, expansion
of this classification will give means of defining syste-
matically many hundreds of possible contexts of learning
with their associated apperceptive habits. The scheme
may be expanded in the following ways:
a. Inclusion of contexts of negative learning (inhibition).
b. Inclusion of mixed types (e.g., cases in which saliva-
tion, with its physiological relevance to meat powder,
is also instrumental in obtaining the meat powder).
c. Inclusion of the cases in which the subject is able to
deduce some sort of relevance (other than the physi·
ological) between some two or more elements in the
sequence. For this to be true, the subject must have
experience of contexts differing systematically one
from another, e.g., contexts in which some type of
change in one element is constantly accompanied by
a constant type of change in another element. These
cases c:~ be spread out on a. lattice of possibilities,
accordIng. to which pa,ir of elements the subject sees
as interrelated. There are only five elements (con-
ditioned stimulus, conditioned response, reward or
punishment, and two time intervals), but any pair
of these. may be· interrelated, and of' the interrelated
pair, either may be seen by the subject as determining
the other. These possibilities, multiplied for our four
basic contexts, give forty-eight types.
d. The list of basic types may be extended by including
those cases (not as yet investigated in learning ex-

illustrate the principles with which we are concerned and we
can now go on to ask about the occurrence of the appropriate
apperceptive habits among men of various cultures. Of great-
est interest-because least famiIiar-are the Pavlovian pat-
terns and the patterns of rote. It is a little hard for members
of Western civilization to believe that whole systems of
behavior can be built on premises other than our own' mix-
ture of instrumental reward and instrumental avoidance. The
Trobriand Islanders, however, appear to live a life whose
coherence and sense is based upon looking at events through
Pavlovian spectacles, only slightly tinted with the hope of
instrumental reward, while the life of the Balinese is sensible
if we accept premises based upon combining rote with in-
strumental avoidance.
Clearly, to the "pure" Pavlovian, only a very limited fatal-
ism would be possible. He would see all events as preor-
dained and he would see himself as fated only to search for
omens, not able to influence the course of events-able
at
most, from his reading of the. omens, to put himself in 'the
properly receptive state, e.g., by salivation, before the in-
?vitable ~ccurred. Trobriand culture is not so purely Pavlov-
Ian ,as this, but Dr. Lee,7 analyzing Professor Malinowski's
rich observations, has shown that Trobriand phrasings of pur"
pose, cause, and effect are profoundly different from our
own; and though Dr. Lee does not use the sort of classifica-
tion here proposed, it appears from Trobriand magiC' that
these people continually exhibit a habit of thinking that to
act as if a thing were so will make it so. In this sense, we
may describe them as semi-Pavlovians who have decided
that "salivation" is instrumental to obtaining "meat powder."
perim~nts but common in interpersonal relationships)
In which the toles of subject and experimenter are
reversed. In these, the learning partner provides the
initial and final elements, while some' other person
(or circumstance) provides the middle term. In these
types, we see the buzzer and the meat powder as the
behavior of a Person and ask: "What does this person
learn?" A great part of the gamut of apperceptive
habits associated with authority and parenthood is
based on contexts of this general type.

Malinowski, for example, gives us a dramatic description of
the almost physiological extremes of rageS which the Tro-
briand black magician practices in his incantations, and we
may take this as an illustration of the semi-Pavlovian frame of
mind in contrast with the very various types of magical
procedure in other parts of the world, where, for example,·
the efficacy of a spell may be associated not with theinten-
sity but with the extreme rote accuracy of the recitation. I
Among the Balinese9 we find another pattern which con-· 1
trasts sharply both with our own and with that of the Tro-
.1
brianders. The treatment of children is such that- they learn
not to see life as .composed of connative sequences ending in
satisfaction, but rather to see it as composed of rote se-
quences inherently satisfying in themselves-a pattern which
is to some extent related to that pattern which Dr. Mead has
recommended, of looking for value in the act itself rather
than regarding the act as a means to an end. There is, how-
ever, one very important difference between the Balinese
pattern and that recommended by Dr. Mead. The Balinese
pattern is essentially derivative from contexts of instrumental
avoidance; they see the world as dangerous, and themselves
as avoiding, by the endless rote behavior of ritual and
courtesy, the ever-present risk of faux pas. Their life is
built upon fear, albeit that in general they enjoy fear. The
positive value with which they endow their immediate acts,
not looking for a goal, is somehow associated
wi~h this
enjoyment of fear. It is the acrobat's enjoyment both of the
thrill and of his own virtuosity in avoiding disaster.
"It is possible that semi-Pavlovian phrasings of the
stream of events tend, like the experiments which are their
prototypes, to hinge particularly upon autonomic re-
actions-that those who see events in these terms tend
to see these reactions, which are only partially subject
to voluntary control, as peculiarly effective and powerful
causes of outside events. There may be some ironical
logic in Pavlovian fatalism which predisposes-us to be-
lieve that we can alter the course of events only by means
of those behaviors which we are least able to control.
•The Balinese material collected by Dr. Mead and my-
self has not yet been published in extenso, but a brief out-
line of the theory· here suggested is available-d. G.
Bateson, "The Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis and
Culture," Psychological Review, 1941, 48:
35~55.

175
We are now, after a somewhat long and technical excur-
sion into psycholOgical laboratories and foreign cultures, in a
position to examine Dr.
Mead~s proposal in somewhat more
concrete terms. She advises that when we apply the social
sciences we look for "direction" and "value" in our very acts,
rather than orient ourselves to some blueprinted goal. She is
not telling us that we ought to be like the Balinese, except
in our time orientation, and she would be the first to dis-
parage any suggestion that fear (even enjoyed fear) should
be our· basis. for assigning value to our acts. Rather, as I
understand it, this basis should be some sort of hope--not
looking to some far-off future, but still some sort of hope or
optimism. In fact, we might summarize the recommended
attitude by saying that it ought to be formally related to
instrumental reward, as the Balinese attitude is related to
instrumental avoidance.
Such an attitude is, I believe, feasible. The Balinese atti-
tude might be defined as a habit of rote sequences inspir~d
by a thrilling sense of ever-imminent but indefinite danger,
and I think that what Dr. Mead is urging us toward might be
defined in like terms, as a habit of· rote sequences inspired
by a thrilling sense of ever-imminent but undefined reward.
As to the rote component, which is almost certainly a
necessary concomitant of the peculiar time orientation ad-
vocated by Dr. Mead, I, personally, would welcome it, and
I believe that it would be infinitely preferable to the com-
pulsive type of accuracy after which we strive. Anxious tak-
ing-care and automatic, rote caution are alternative habits
which perform the same function. We can either have the
habit of automatically looking before we cross the street, or
the habit of carefully remembering to look. Of the two I
prefer the automatic, and I think that, if Dr. Mead's rec-
ommendatiOn implies an increase in rote automatism,- we
ought to accept it Alreildy, indeed, our schools are inculcat-
ing more and more automatism in such processes as reading,
writing, arithmetic, and languages.
As to the reward component, this, too, should not be
beyond our reach. H the Balinese is kept busy and happy
by a nameless, shapeless. fear, not located in space or time,
we might be kept on our toes by a nameless, shapeless,
unlocated hope of enormous achievement. For such a hope
to be effective, the achievement need scarcely be defined.

All we need to be sure of is that, at any moment, achieve-
ment may be just around the comer, and, true or false, this
can never be tested. We have got to be like those few
artists and scientists who work with this urgent sort of in-
spiration, the urgency that comes from feeling that great
discovery, the answer to all our problems, or great creation,
the perfect sonnet, is always only just beyond our reach, or
like the mother of a child who feels that, provided she pay

constant enough attention, there is a real hope that her child
maybe that infinitely rare phenomenon, a great and happy'
person.
A Theory of Play and Fantasy*,
This research was planned and started with an hypothesis
to guide our investigations, the task of the investigators being
to collect relevant observational data and, in the process, to
.amplify and modify the hypothesis.
The hypothesis will here be described as it has grown in
our thinking.
Earlier fundamental work of Whitehead, Russell,l Witt-
genstein,2 Camap,3 Whorf,4 etc., as well as my own at-
tempt5 to use this earlier thinking as an epistemological base
for psychiatric theory, led to a series of generalizations:

always does operate at many contrasting levels of abstrac-

tion. These range in two drrectlOns from the seemmgly Slm- ."
pie denotative level ("The cat is on the mat"). One range
or set of these more abstract levels includes those explicit or
implicit messages where the· subject of discourse is the lan-
guage. We will call these metalinguistic (for example, "The
verbal sound 'cat' stands for any member of such and such
class of objects," or "The word, 'cat,' has no fur and cannot
scratch"). The other set of levels of abstraction we will call
metacommunicative (e.g., "My telling you where to find the
·1
cat was friendly," or "This is play"). In these, the subject of
discourse is the relationship between the speakers.
I
It will be noted that the vast majority of both metalinguis_
tic and metacommunicative messages remain implicit; and
also that, espeCially in the psychiatric interview, there occurs
a further class of implicit messages about how metacommuni-
cative messages of friendship and hostility are to be inter-
preted.
(2) If we speculate about the evolution of communication,
it is evident that a very important stage in this evolution
occurs when the organism gradually ceases to respond quite
"automatically" to the mood-signs of another and becomes
able to recognize the sign as a Signal: that is, to recognize
that the other individual's and its own Signals are only Signals,
which can be trusted, distrusted, falsified, denied, ampli-
fied, corrected, and so forth.
Clearly this. realization that signals are signals is by no
means complete even among the human species. We all too

though these stimuli were direct object-indications of events
in our environment instead of signals concocted and trans-
mitted by creatures as complexly motivated as ourselves,
The nonhuman mammal is automatically excited by the sex-
ual odor of another; and rightly so, inasmuch· as the secretion
of that sign is an "involuntary" mood-sign; i.e., an outwardly
perceptible event which is a part of the physiological process
which we have called a mood. In the human species a more
complex state of affairs begins to be the rule. Deodorants
mask the involuntary olfactory signs, and in their place the
cosmetic industry provides
the individual with perfumes
which are not involuntary signs but voluntary Signals, rec-
ognizable as such. Many a man has been thrown off balance
by a whiff of perfume, and if we are to believe the ad-

vertisers, 'it seems that these signals, voluntarily worn, }(ave
sometimes an automatic and autosuggestive effect even upon
the voluntary wearer.
Be that as it may, this brief digression will serve to illus-
trate a stage of evolution-the drama precipitated when
organisms, having eaten of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,
discover that their signills are signals. Not only the character-
istically human invention of language can then follow, but
also all the complexities of empathy, identification, projec-
tion
and so on. And with these comes the possibility of
co~unicating at the multiplicity of levels of abstraction men~
tioned above.
(3)
The first definite step in the formulation of the
hypothesis guiding this research occurred in January, 1952,
when I went to the Fleishhacker Zoo in San Francisco to
look for behavioral criteria which would indicate whether
any given organism is or is not able to recognize that the
signs emitted by itself and other members of the species
are signals. In theory, I had thought out what such criteria
might look like--that the occurrence of metacommunicative
signs (or signals) in the stream of interaction between the
animals would indicate that the animals have at least some
awareness (conscious or unconscious) that the signs about
which they metacommunicate are signals.
I knew, of course, that there was no likelihood of finding
denotative messages among nonhuman mammals, but I was
still not aware that the animal data would require an ahnost
total revision of my thinking. What I encountered at the zoo
was a· phenomenon well known to everybody: I saw two
young monkeys playing, i.e., engaged in an interactive se-
quence of which the unit actions or signals were similar to
but not the same as those of combat. It was evident, even to
the human observer, that the sequence as a whole was not
combat, and evident to the human observer that to the
participant monkeys this was "not combat."
Now, this phenomenon, play, could only occur if the par-
ticipant organisms were capable of some degree of meta-
communication, i.e., of exchanging signals which would carry
the message "this is play."
(4) The next step was the examination of the message
"This is play," and the realization that this message contains
those elements which necessarily generate a paradox of the

[
L
I
180
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
RusseIlian or Epimenides type-a negative statement con-
taining an implicit negative metastatement. Expanded, the
statement "TIus is play" looks something like this: "These
actions in which we now engage do not denote what those
actions for which they stand would denote."
We now ask about the italicized words, "for which they
stand:' We say the word "cat" stands for any member of a
certain class. That is, the phrase "stands for" is a near
synonym of "denotes:' If we now substitute "which they
denote" for the words "for which they stand" in the ex-
panded definition of play, the result is: "These actions, in
which we now engage, do not denote what would be de-
noted by those actions which these actions denote:' The
playful nip denotes the bite, but it does not denote what
would be denoted by the bite.
According to the Theory of Logical Types such a message
is of course inadmissable, because the word "denote" is be-
ing used in two degrees of abstraction, and' these two uses
are treated as synonymous. But all that we learn from such
a criticism is that jt would be bad nahll'al history to expect
the mental processes and communicative habits of mammals
to conform t9 the logician's ideal. Indeed, if human thought
and communication always conformed to the ideal, Russell
would not-in fact could not-have formulated the ideal. '
(5) A related problem in the evolution of communication,
concerns the origin of what Korzybski6 has called the map-
territory relation: the fact that a message, of whatever kind,
does not consist of those objects which it denotes
(''The
word 'cat' cannot scratch us"). Rather, language bears to the
objects which it denotes a relationship comparable to that
which a map bears to a territory. Denotative communication
as it occurs at the human level is only possible after the
evolution of a complex-set of metalinguistic (but not verbal-
ized)7 rules which govern how words and sentences shall
be related to objects and events. It is therefore appropriate
to look for the evolution of such metalinguistic and/or meta-
communicative rules at a prehuman and preverbal level.
•A. Korzybski, Science, and Sanity, New York, Science
Press, 1941.
•The verbalization of these metalinguistic rules is a
much later achievement which can only occur after the
evolution of a nonverbalized meta-metalinguistics.

It appears from what is said above that play is a phenom-
enon in which the actions of "play" are related to, or
denote, other actions of "not play." We therefore meet in
~lay with an instance of signals standing for other events, and

In that, actions denote, but are different from, other actions.

It refers to a possible fuhll'e (but at present nonexistent)
punch. And threat also is commonly recognizable among non-
human mammals. Indeed it has lately been argued that a

a single species is rather to be regarded as threat (Tin-

(8) We might expect threat, play, and histrionics to be
,three independent phenomena all contributing to the evolu-
tion of the discrimination between map and territory. But it
seems that this would be wrong, at least so far as mammalian
communication is concerned. Very brief analysis of childhood
behavior shows that such combinations as histrionic play,
b~uff~ playful threat, teasing play in response to threat, his-
trlOmc threat, and so on form together a single total complex
of p~enom~na. ~d such ad,;dt phenomena as gambling and

dividual-are a part of this complex. It is probable that not
only histrionics but also spectatorship should be included
within this field. It is also appropriate to mention self-pity.
(9) A further extension of this thinking leads us to include
ritual within this general field. in which the discrimination is
drawn, but not completely, between denotative action and
that which is to be denoted.
Anthropological studies
of
peace-making- ceremonies, to cite only one example, sup-
port this conclusion.
In the Andaman Islands, peace is concluded after each
side has been given ceremonial freedom to strike the other.
This example, howev{)r, also illustrates the labile nature of the
frame "This is play," or "This is ritual." The discrimination
between map and territory is always liable to break down,
and the ritual blows of peace-making are always liable to be
mistaken for the "real" blows of combat. In this event, the
peace-making
ceremony
becomes
a
battle
(Radcliffe-
Brown12 ).
(10) But this leads us to recognition of a more complex
fonn of play; the game which is constructed not upon the
premise "This is play" but rather around the question "Is
this play?" And thIs type of interaction also has its ritual
fonns, e.g., in the hazing of initiation.
(ll) Paradox is doubly present in the Signals which are
exchanged within the context of play, fantasy, threat, etc.
Not only does the playful nip not denote what would be
denoted by the bite for which it stands, but,. in addition,
the. bite itself is·fictional. Not only do the playing animals
not quite mean what they are saying but, also, they

ers ac~eve a strange a~dictive realism by equating the chips
for whICh they play With dollars. They still insist however
that the loser accept his loss as part of the game.'
,
Finally, in the dim region where art, magic, and religion
meet and overlap, human beings have evolved the "meta-
phor that is meant," the Hag which men will die to save and
the sacrament that is felt to be more than "an outward and
visible sign, giv.en unto us." Here we can recognize an attempt
to deny the dIfference between map and territory, and to
get back to the absolute innocence of communication by
means of pure mood-sign~.
(12) We face then two peculiarities of play: (a) that the
messages or signals exchanged in play are in a certain sense
untrue or not meant; and (b) that that which is denoted by
these
signals
is
nonexistent.
These
two
peculiarities
sometimes
combine strangely
to
a reverse
a
conclusion
reached above. It was stated (4) that the playful nip de-
notes the bite, but does not denote that which would be
denoted by the bite. But there are other instances where an
opposite phenomenon occurs. A man experiences the full in-
tensity of subjective terror when a spear is Hung at him out
of the 3J? sc:een or w~en ~e falls. headlong from some peak
created m his own rmnd m the mtensity of nightmare. At
the m~ment of terror there was no questioning of "reality,"
but still there was no spear in the movie house and no cliff
in the bedroom. The images did not denote that which they
seemed to denote, but these same images did really evoke
that terror which would have been evoked by a real spear
or a real precipice. By a similar trick of self-contradiction
the fi?-makers of Hollywood are free to offer to a
puri~
tanical public a vast range of pseudosexual fantasy which
otherwise would not be tolerated. In DaVid and Bathsheba
Bathsheba can be a Troilistic link between David and Uriah:
And in Hans Christian Andersen, the hero starts out ac-
companied by a boy. He tries to get a woman, but when he is
defeated in this attempt, he returns to the boy. In all of
this, there is, of course, no homosexuality, but the choice of
these symbolisms is associated in these fantasies with certain
characteristic ideas, e.g., about the hopelessness of the het-
erosexual masculine position when faced with certain sorts
of women or with certain sorts of male authority. In sum, the

184

pseudohomosexuality of the fantasy does not stand
fo~ any
real homosexuality, but does stand for and express attitudes
which might accompany a real homosexuality or feed .its
etiological roots. The symbols do not denote homosexuality,
but do denote ideas for which homosexuality is an appropriate
symbol. Evidently it is necessary .to re-e~amine the p~ec~e
semantic validity of the interpretations which the psychIatrist
offers to a patient, and, as preliminary to this analysis, .it
will be necessary to examine the nature of the frame ill
which these interpretations are offered.
(13) What has previously been said about play can be
. used as an introductory example for the discussion of frames
and contexts. In sum; it is our hypothesis ·that the message
"This is play" establishes a paradoxical frame comparable to
Epimenides' paradox. This frame may be diagrammed thus:
All statements within this
frame are untrue.
I love you.
I hate you..
The first statement within this frame isa. self-contradictory
proposition about itself. If this first .statement is true, then ~t
must be false. If it be false, then It must be true. But this
first statement carries with it all the other statements in the
frame. So, if the first statement be true, then all the otherS
must be false; and vice versa, if the first statement be untrue
then all the others mustbe true.
(14) The logically minded will notice a non-sequitur. It
could be urged that even if the first staement is false, there
remains a logical possibility that some of the other stat~~ents
in the frame are untrue. It is, however, a charactenstic of
unconscious or "primary-process" thinking that the thinker is
unable to discriminate between "some" and "all," and unable
to discriminate between "not aU" and "none." It seem.s that
the achievement of these discriminations is performed by
'higher or more conscious mental processes which serve .in
the nonpsychotic individual to correct the black-and-white
thinking of the lower levels. We ~ssume, and~s seems to
be an orthodox assumption, that pnmary process IS continual-

ly 0rerating, and that the psychological validity of the para-
dOXICal play frame depends upon this part of the mind.
.(15) But, conversely, while it is necessary to invoke the
prImary process as an explanatory principle in order to delete
the notion of "some" from between "all" and "none," this
does not mean that play is simply a primary-process phenom-
enon. The discrimination between "play" and "nonplay"
like the discrimination between fantasy and nonfantasy
is
certainly a function of secondary process, or "ego." Within
the dream the dreamer is usually unaware that he is dream-
ing, and within "play" he must often be reminded that ''This
is play,"
.
Similarly, within dream or fantasy the dreamer does not
operate with the concept "untrue," He operates with all sorts
of statements but with a curious inability to achieve meta-
statements..He can~lOt, unle:ss close to waking, dream a state-
ment refemng to (J.e., frammg) his dream.
It tlterefore follows that the pla~ frame as here used as
an. explanatory principle implies a special combination of
prImary and secondary processes. This, however, is related
to what was said
ear~er, when it was argued that play
marks a step forward m the evolution of communication-
the
c~cial step in the discovery of map-territory relations.
In prlIDary process, map and territory are equated; m sec-
ondary process, they can be discriminated. In play, they are
both equated and discriminated.
.. (16) Another logical anomaly in this system must be men-
~lOned: that tlte rel~tionship between two propositions which
~s
com~only deSCrIbed by the word "premise" has become
mtransItive. In general, all asymmetrical relationships are
transitive. The relationship "greater tltan" is typical in this
respect; it is conventional to argue that if A is greater than
B, and B is greater than C, tlten A is greater than- C. But
in psycholOgical processes the transitivity of asymmetrical re-
lations is not observed. The proposition P may be a premise
for Q; Q may be a premise for R; and R may be a premise
for P. Specifically, in the system 'which we are considering,
the circle is still more contracted. The message, "All state-
ments within this frame are untrue" is itself to be taken as a
premise in evaluating its own truth or untruth. (Cf. the in-
transitivity of psychological preference discussed by McCul-

recognized
and
even represented in vocabulary
("play,"
"movie,"
"interview,'"
"job,"
"language,"
etc.) .
In
other
cases, there may be no explicit verbal reference to the
franie, and the subject may have no consciousness of it. The
analyst, however, finds that his own thinking is Simplified if
he uses the notion of an unconscious frame as an explanatory
- principle; usually he goes further than this and infers its
existence in the subject's unconscious.
But while the analogy of the mathematical set is perhaps
over abstract, the analogy of the picture fram!,! is excessively
concrete. The psychological concept which we are trying to
define is neither phYSical nor logical. Rather, the actual
phYSical frame is, we believe, added by human beings to
physical pictures because these human beings operate more
easily in, a universe in which some of their psychological
characteristics are externalized. ·It 'is these characteristics
which we are trying to discuss, using the externalization as
an illustrative device.
(18) The common functions and uses of psychological
frames may now be listed and illustrated by reference to the
analogies whose limitations have been indicated in the pre-
vious paragraph:
(a) Psychological frames are exclusive, i-e., by including
certain messages (or meaningful actions) within a frame, cer-
tain other messages are excluded.
(b) Psychological frames are inclusive, i.e., by excluding
certain messages certain others are included. From the point
of
vi~w of set theory these two functions are synonymous,
but from the point of view of psychology it is necessary to
list them separately. The frame, around a picture, if we con-
sider this frame as a message intended to order or organize
the perception of the viewer, says, "Attend to what is within
and do not attend to what is outside." Figure and ground, as
these tenns are used by gestalt psychologists, are not sym-
metrica~ly related as are the set and nonset of set theory.
Perception of the ground must be positively inhibited and
perception of the figure (in this case the picture) must be
positively enhanced.
(c)
Psychological frames are related to what we have
called "premises." The picture frame tells the' viewer that
he is.not to use the same sort of thinking in interpreting
the pICture that he might use in interpreting the wallpaper

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
loch.1s The paradigm for all paradoxes of this general type is
Russell's14 "class of classes which are not members of them-
selves," Here Russell demonstrates that paradox is generated
by treating the relationship, "is .. a m~ber .of,::· as
~n i?-
transitive. ) With this caveat, that the
premlSe .relation m
psychology is likely to be intransitive, we sh~ use the word
"preinise" to denote a dependency of one .Idea or message
upon another comparable to the dependency
o~ one pr?p-
osition upon another which is referred to in lOgIC by saymg
that the proposition P is a premise for Q.
.
(17) All this, however, leaves unclear what 15 meant by
"frame" and the related notion of "context," To clarify these,
it is necessary to insist first that these ar~ psychological .con-
cepts. We use two sorts of analogy to discuss these notions:
the physical analogy of the picture frame and the more
abstract, but still not psychological, analogy of the mathe-
matical set. In set theory the mathematicians have. de~el­
oped axioms and theorems to discuss ,?th rigor th.e logtc2"lun;,
plications of membership in overlappmg categones or
sets.
The relationships between sets are commonly illustrat~d by
diagrams in which the items or members of a larger unlVerse
are represented by dots, and the smaller sets are delimited
by imaginary lines enclosing the members of each set. Su~h
diagrams then illustrate a topological approach to the l~gIC
of classification. The first step in defining a psychologtcal
frame might be to say that it is (or delimits) a class o~ s~t .of
messages (or meaningful actions). The play of two mdivld-
uals on a certain occasion would then be defined as the
set of all messages exchanged by them within a limited
period of time and modified by the paradoxical. prem~se
system which we have described. In a set-theoretical dia-
gram these messages might be represented by dots, and the
"set" enclosed by a line which would separate these f~om
other dots representing nonplay messages. The mathematical
analogy breaks down, however, because
th~
ps>:cholo~cal
frame is not satisfactorily represented by an_ unagtnary line.
We assume that the psychological frame has some degree of
real existence. In many instances, the frame is consciously
r
I

I~
188
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
outside the frame. Or, in terms of the analogy from set
theory, the messages enclosed within the imaginary line are
defined as members of a class by virtue of their sharing
common premises or mutual relevance. The frame itself thus
becomes a part of the premise system. Either, as in the c~se
of the play frame, the frame is involved in the evaluation
of the messages which it contains, or the frame merely
assists the mind in understanding the contained messages by
reminding the thinker that these messages are ~utually rele-
vant and the messages outside the frame may be Ignored.
.
(d) In the sense of the previous paragraph, a frame
IS
metacommunicative. Any message, which either expli.citly .or
implicitly defines a 'frame, ipso facto gives the receIVer In-
structions or aids in his attempt to understand the messages
included within the frame.
(e) The
converse
of
(d)
is
also
true.
Every

explicitly or implicitly, the set of messages about which it com-
municates, i.e., every metacommunicative mes.sage is

such complex metacommunicative mess~ges as the
p~ychI~­
trist's definition of his own curative role In terms of which his
contributions to the whole mass of messages in psychotherapy
are to be understood.
(I) The relation between psychological frame and per-
ceptual gestalt needs to be considered, and. h~re the analogy
of the picture frame is useful. In a
paI~ting by Roualt
or Blake,
~e human figures and other objects represented
are outlined. "Wise men see outlines and therefore they draw
them." But outside these lines, which delimit the perceptual
gestalt or "figure," there is a background or :'~ound" .which
in turn is limited by the picture
~rame.
S~larly,.m set-
theoretical diagrams, the larger uruverse ':"Ithin which th.e
smaller sets are drawn is itself enclosed In a frame. This
/
double framing is, we believe, not merely a matter of "frames
within frames" but an indication that mental processes re-
, semble logic in needing an outer frame to delimit the ground
against which the figures are to be perceived. This need is
often unsatisfied, as when we see a piece of sculpture in a
junk shop window, but this is uncomfortable. We suggest
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
189
that the need for this outer limit to the ground is related to a
preference for avoiding the paradoxes of abstraction. When
a logical class or set of items is defined-for example, the
class of matchboxes-it is necessary to delimit the set of
items which are to be excluded, in this case, all those things
which are not matchboxes. But the items to be included in
the background set must· be of the same degree of abstrac-
tion, i.e., of the same "logical type" as those within the set
itself. Specifically, if paradox is to be avoided, the "class of
matchboxes" and the "class of nonmatchboxes" (even though
both these items are plearly not matchboxes) must not be
regarded as members of the class of nonmatchboxes. No class
can be a member of itself. The picture frame then, because
it delimits a background, is here regarded as an external
representation of a very special and important type of psycho-
logical frame-namely a frame whose function is to delimit
a logical type. This, in fact, is what was indicated above
when it was said that the picture frame is an instruction to
the viewer that he should not extend the premises which
obtain between the figures within the picture to the wall
paper behind it.
But, it is precisely this sort of frame that precipitates
paradox. The rule for avoiding paradoxes insists that the
items outside any enclosing line be of the same logical type
as those within, but the picture frame, as analyzed above,
is a line dividing items of one logical type from those of
another. In passing, it is interesting to note that Russell's rule
cannot be stated without breaking the rule. Russell insists
that all items of inappropriate logical type be exluded (i.e.,
by an imaginary line) from the background of any class, i.e.,
he insists upon the drawing of an imaginary line of precisely
the sort which he prOhibits.
(19) This whole matter of frames and paradoxes may be
illustrated in terms of animal behavior, where three types of
message may be recognized or deduced:
(a) Messages of
the sort which we here call mood-signs; (b) messages which
simulate mood-signs (in play, threat, histrionics, etc.); and
(c) messages which enable the receiver to discriminate be-
tween mood-signs and those other signs which resemble
them. The message "This is play" is of this third type. It tells
the receiver that certain nips and other meaningful actions
are not messages of the first type.

The message "This is play" thus sets a frame of the sort
which is likely to precipitate paradox: it is an attempt to
di~criminate between, or to draw a line between, categories
of different logical types.
(20) This discussion of play and psychological frames es-
tablishes a type of triadic constellation (or system of re-
lationships)
between messages. One instance of this con-
stellation is analyzed in paragraph 19, but it is evident that
constellations of this sort occur not only at the nonhuman
level but also in the much more complex communication of
human beings. A fantasy or myth may simulate a denota-
tive narrative, and, to discriminate between these types of
discourse, people use messages of the frame-setting type,
and so on.
(21) In conclusion, we arrive at the complex task of
applying this theoretical approach to the particular phenom-
ena of psychotherapy. Here the lines of our thinking may
mos~ briefly be summarized by -presenting and partially an-
swering these questions:
(a) Is there any indication that certain forms of psycho-
pathology are specifically characterized by abnormalities in
the patient's handling of frames and paradoxes?
(b) Is there any indication that the techniques of psycho-
therapy necessarily depend upon the manipulation of frames
and paradoxes?
(c) Is it possible to describe the process of a given
psychotherapy in
terms
of the interaction
between
the
patient's abnormal use of frames and the therapist's manipu-
lation of them?
(22) In reply to the first question, it seems that-the "word
salad" of schizophrenia can be described in terms .of the
patient's failure to recognize the metaphoric nature 'of his
fantasies. In what should be triadic c,onstellations of messages,
the frame-setting message
(e.g.,
the phrase "as if")
is
omitted, and the metaphor or fantasy is narrated and acted
upon in a manner which would be appropriate if the fantasy
were a message- of the more direct kind. The absence of
metacommunicative framing which yvas noted in the case of
dreams (15) is characteristic of the waking communications
of the schizophrenic. With the loss of the ability to set
metacommunicative frames, there is also a loss of ability to
achieve the more primary or primitive message. The meta-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
191
phor is
tr~ated
directl~ as a message of the more primary
type. (This matter is dIscussed at greater length in the paper
given by Jay Haley at this Conference.)
(~3) The dependence of psychotherapy upon the manip-
ulation of frames follows from the fact that therapy is an
attempt to change the patient's metacommunicative habits.
Before .therapy, the patient thinks and operates in terms -of
a certam set of rules for the making and understanding of
~essages.After successful therapy, he operates in terms of a
different.set of such rules. (Rules of this sort are in·general,
unverbali,zed, and unconscious both before and after.) It
follows that, in the process of therapy, there must have been
communication at a level meta to these rules. There must
have been communication about a change in rules. .
But such a communication about change could not con-
cei~abli' occur in me~sa~es of the type permitted by the
patient s metacommumcative rules as they existed either be-
fore or after therapy.
It was suggested above that the paradoxes of play are
~a:acteristlc of an evolutionary step. Here we suggest that
smular .paradoxes are a necessary ingredient in that process
of change which we call psychotherapy.
The resemblance between the process of therapy and the
phenomenon of_play is, in fact, profound. Both occur within
a delimited psychological frame,
a spatial and temporal
bounding of a set of interactive messages. In both play and
therapy, the messages have a special and peculiar relationship
to a more concrete or basic reality. Just as the pseudocombat
of play is not real combat, so also the pseudolove and pseu-
dohate of therapy are not real love and hate. The "transfer"
is discriminated from real love and hate by signals invoking
the psychological frame; and indeed it is this frame which
permits the transfer to reach its full intensity and to be dis-
cussed between patient and therapist.
~e formalcharac~~stics_of the therapeutic process may
be illustrated by bwldingup a model in stages. Imagine
first two players who engage in a game of canasta according
to a standard set of rules. So long as these rules govern and
are unquestioned ~y both players, the game is unchanging,
i.e., no therapeutic change will occur. (Indeed many at-
~empts at psychotherapy fail for this reason.) We may imag-
me, however, that at a certain moment the two canasta play-

i
Il
192
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
ers cease to play canasta and start a discussion of the rules.
Their d~scourse is now of a diHerent logical type from that
of their play. At the end of this discussion, we can imagine
that they return to playing but with modified rules.
This sequence of events is, however, still an imperfect
model of therapeutic interaction, though it illustrates our
contention that therapy necessarily involves a combination of
discrepant logical types of discourse. Our imaginary players
avoided paradox by separating their discussion of the rules
from their play, and it is precisely this separation that is im-
possible in psychotherapy. As we see it, the process of
psychotherapy is a framed interaction between two persons,
in which the rules are implicit but subject to change. Such
change can only be proposed by experimental action, hut
every such experimental action, in which a proposal to change
the rules is implicit, is itself a part of the ongoing game. It
is this combination of logical types within the single mean-
ingful l!ct that gives to therapy the character not of a rigid
game likecanasta but, instead, that of an evolving system of
interaction. The play of kittens or otters has this character.
(24) In regard to the specific relationship between the
way in which the patient handles frames and the way in
which the therapist manipulates them, very little can at
present be said. It is, however, suggestive to observe that the
psychological frame of therapy is an analogue of the frame-
setting message which the schizophrenic is unable to achieve.
To talk in "word salad" within the psychological frame of
therapy is, in a sense, not patholOgical. Indeed the neurotic is
specifically encouraged to do precisely this, narrating his
dreams and free associations so that patient and- therapist
may achieve an understanding of this material. By the pro-
cess of interpretation, the neurotic is driven to insert an "as
if" clause into the productions of his primary process thinking,
which productions he had previously deprecated or re-
pressed. He must learn that fantasy contains truth.
For the schizophrenic the problem is somewhat diHerent.
His error is in treating the metaphors of primary process
with the full intensity of literal truth. Through the discovery
of what these metaphors stand for he must discover that
they are only metaphors.
(25) From the point of view of the project, however, '
psychotherapy constitutes only one of the many fields which
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
193
we are attempting to investigate. Our central thesis may be
summed up as a statement of the necessity of the paradoxes
of abstraction. It is not merely bad natural history to suggest
that people might or should obey the Theory of Logical
Types in their communications; their failure to do this is not
due to mere carelessness or ignorance. Rather, we believe
that the paradoxes of abstraction must make their appear-
ance in all communication more complex than that of mood-
signals, and that without these paradoxes the evolution of
communication would be at an end. Life would then be an
endless interchange of stylized messages, a game with rigid
rules, unrelieved by change or humor.

Epidemiology of a Schizophrenia*
If we are to discuss the epidemiology of mental condi-
tions, i.e., conditions partly induced by experience, our first
task is to pinpoint a defect of an ideational system sufficiently
so that we can go on from that pinpointing to postulate what
sort of contexts of learning might induce this formal defect.
It is conventionally said that schizophrenics have "ego
weakness." I now define ego weakness as trouble in iden-
tifying and interpreting those signals which should tell the
individual what sort of a message a message is, i.e., trouble
with the signals of the same logical type as the signal "This
is play." For example, a patient comes into the hospital can-
teen and the girl behind the counter.says, "What can I do
for you?" The patient is in doubt as to what sort of a
message this is-is it a message about doing him in? Is it an
indication that she wants him to go to bed with her? Or
is it an offer of a cup of coffee? He hears the message and
does not know what sort or order of a message it is. He is
unable to pick up the more abstract labels which we are

most of us able to use conventionally but are most of us
unable to identify in the sense that we don't know what
told us what sort of a message it was. It is as if we some-
how make a correct guess. We are actuallly quite uncon-
scious of receiving these messages which tell us what sorts
of message we receive.
Difficulty with signals of this sort seems to be the center
of a syndrome which is characteristic for a group of schizo-
phrenics, so therefore we can reasonably look for an etiol-
ogy starting from this· symptomatology as formally defined.
When you begin thinking in this way, a great deal of
what the schizophrenic says falls into place as a description
of his experience. That is, we have a second lead toward
the theory of etiology or transmission. The first lead is from
the symptom. We ask, "How does a human individual acquire
an imperfect ability to discriminate these specific Signals?"
and .when we look at his speeches, we find that, in that
peculiar language which is schizophrenic salad, he is de-
scribing a traumatic situation which involves a metacom-
municative tangle.
A patient, for example, has a central notion that "some-
thing moved in space," and that that is why he cracked up.
I somehow, from the way he spoke about "space," got an
idea that space is his mother and said so. He said, "No,
space is the mother."
I suggested to him that she might
be in some way a cause of his troubles. He said, "I never
condemned her." At a certain point he got angry, and he
said-this is verbatim-"If we say she had movement in
her because of what she caused, we are only condemning
ourselves." Something moved in space that made him crack
up. Space is not his mother, it is the mother. But now we
focus upon his mother whom he says he never condemned.
And he now says, "If we say that she had movement in her
because of what she caused, we are only condemning our-
selves.~'
Look very carefully at the logical structure of that last
quotation. It is circular. It implies a way of interaction and
chronic cross-purposes with the mother such that for the
child to make those moves which might straighten out the
misunderstanding was also prohibited.
On another occasion he had skipped his therapy session
in the morning, and I went over to the dining hall at supper

196
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
time to see him and assure him that he would see me next
day. He refused to look at me. He looked away. I made
some remark about 9.30 the next morning-no answer. Then,
with great difficulty, he said, "The judge disapproves." Be-
fore I left him, I said, "You need a defense attorney," and
when I found him on the grounds next morning I said,
"Here is your defense attorney," and we went into session
together. I started out .by saying, "Am I right in supposing
that the judge not only disapproves of your talking to me
but also disapproves of your telling me that he disapproves?"
He said, "YesI" That is, we are dealing with two levels
here. The "judge" disapproves of the attempt to straighten
out the confusions and disapproves of communicating the
fact of his (the judge'S) disapproval.
We have to look for an etiology involving multiple levels
of trauma.
I am not talking at all about the content of these trau-
-matic sequences, whether they be sexual, or oral. Nor am
I talking about the age of.the subject at the time of trauma,
nor about which parent is involved. That is .all episodic as
far as I'm concerned. I'm only building up toward the state-
ment that the trauma must have had formal structure in
the sense that multiple logical types were played against
each other to generate this particular pathology in this indi-
vidual.
Now, if you look at our conventional communication with
one another,
wh~t you find is that we weave these logical
types with incredible complexity and quite surprising facility.
We even make jokes, and these may be difficult for a
foreigner to understand. Most jokes, both canned 'and spon-
taneous, and nearly anywhere, are weavings of multiple log-
icaltypes. Kidding and hazing Similarly depend upon the
unresolved question whether the kid-ee can identify that
this is kidding. In any culture, the individuals acquire quite
extraordinary skill in handling not only the flat identification
of what sort of a message a message is but in dealing in multi-
ple identifications of what sort of a message a message is.
When we meet these multiple identifications we laugh, and
we make new psycholOgical discoveries about what goes on
inside ourselves, which is perhaps the reward of real humor.
But there are people who have the utmost difficulty
with this problem of multiple levels,
~nd it seems to me
r
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
197
that this unequal distribution of ability is a phenomenon
which we can approach with the questions and terms of
epidemiology. What is needed for a child to acquire, or to
not acquire, a skill in the ways of interpreting these signals?
There is not only the miracle that any of them acquire
the skills-and a lot of them do-there is also the other side,
that a great many people have difficulty. There are people,
for example, who, when Big Sister in the soap opera suffers
from Ii cold, will send a bottle of aspirin to the radio station
or recommend a cure for Big Sister's cold, in spite of the
fact that Big Sister is a fictitious character within a radio
soap opera. These particular members of the audience are
apparently a little bit askew in their identification of what
sort of a communication this is that is coming from their
radio.
We all make errors of ·that kind at various times. I'm
not sure that I've ever met anybody that doesn't suffer from
"schizophrenia p" more or less. We all have some difficulty in
deciding sometimes whether a dream was a dream or not,
and it would not be very easy for most of us to say how
we know that a piece of our own fantasy is fantasy and
not experience. The ability to place an experience in time
is one of the important cues, and referring it to a sense organ
is another.
When you look at the mothers and fathers of patients
for an answer to this etiological question, you meet with
several sorts of answers.
First of all there are answers connected with what we may
call. the intensifying factors. Any disease is made worse. or
more probable by various circumstances, such as fatigue,
cold, the number of days of combat, the presence of other
diseases, etc. These seem to have a quantitative effect upon
the incidence of almost any pathology. Then there are those
factors which I mentioned-the hereditary characteristics and
potentialities. To get confused about the logical types, one
presumably has to be intelligent enough to know that there
is something wrong, and not so iIiteIligent as to be able to
see what it is that is wrong. I presume that these char-
acteristics are hereditarily determined.
But the nub of the problem, it seems to me, is to identify
what real circumstances lead to the specific pathology. I
acknowledge that the bacteria are not really by any means

f

the sale detenninant of a bacterial disease, and grant'also
therefore that the occurrence of such traumatic sequences or
contexts is not by any means the sale detenninant of mental
illness. But still it seems to me that the identification of
those contexts is the nub of understanding the disease; as
identifying the bacteria is essential to understanding a bac-
terial disease.
I have met the mother of the patient whom I mentioned
earlier. The family is not badly off. They live in a nice
tract house; 1 went there with the patient, and when we
~
arrived nobody was home. The newspaper boy had tossed
the evening paper out in the middle of the lawn, and my
patient wanted to get that paper from the middle of that
perfect lawn. He came to the edge of the lawn and started
to tremble.
The house looks like what is called a "model" home-
a house which has been furnished by the real estate people
in order to sell other houses to the public. Not a house
furnished to live in, but rather furnished to look like a fur-
nished house.
I discussed his mother with him one day, and suggested
that perhaps she was a rather frightened person. He said,
''Yes.'' I said, ''What is she frightened of?" He said, "The
appeariential securities."
There is a beautiful, perfectly centered mass of artificial,
plastic vegetation on the middle of the mantle. A china
pheasant here and a china pheasant there, symmetrically
arranged. The wall-to-wall carpet is exactly as it should be.
After his mother arrived, I felt a little uncomfortable,
intruding in this house. He had not visited there for about
~
Dve years, but things seemed to be going all right, so I
decided to leave him there and to come back when it was
time to go back to the hospital. That gave me an hour in
the streets with absolutely nothing to do, and I began to
think what I would like to do to this setup. What and how
could I communicate? I decided that I would like to put
into it something that was b6th beautiful and untidy. In try-
ing to implement that decision, I decided that Bowers were
the answer, so I bought some gladioluses. I took the gladio-
luses, and, when I went to get him, I presented them to the
mother with a speech that I wanted her to have in her house
something that was "both beautiful and untidy." "Ohl" she
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
199
said, "Those are not untidy Bowers. As each one withers,
you can snip it off."
Now, as I see it, what is interesting is not so much the
castrative statement in that speech, but the putting me in
the position of having apolOgized when in fact I had not.
That is, she took my message and reclassified it. She changed
the label which indicated what sort of a message it was,
and that is, I believe, what she does all the time. An
endless taking of the other person's message and replying
to it as if it were either a statement of weakness on the
part of the speaker or an attack on her which should be turned
into a weakness on the part of the speaker; and so on.
What the patient is up against today-and was up against
in childhood-is the false interpretation of his messages. If
he says, "The cat is on the table," she replies with some
reply which makes out that his message is not the sort of
message that he thought it was when he gave it. His own
message identifier is obscured or distorted by her when the
message comes back. And her own message identifier she
continually contradicts. She laughs when she is saying that
which is least funny to her, and so on.
Now there is a regular maternal dominance picture in this
family, but I am not concerned at the moment to say that
this is the necessary fonn of the trauma. I am only con-
cerned with the purely fonnal aspects of this traumatic con-
stellation; and I presume the constellation could be made
up with father taking certain parts of it, mother taking certain
other parts of it, and so forth.
I am trying to make only one point: that there is here a
probability of trauma which will contain certain fonnal char-
acteristics. It will propagate a specific syndrome in the pa-
tient because the trauma itself has impact upon a certain
element in the communicational process. That which is at-
tacked is the use of what I have called the "message-iden-
tifying signals"-those signals without which the "ego" dare
not discriminate fact from fantasy or the literal from the
metaphOric.
What I tried to do was pinpoint a group of syndromata,
namely those syndromata related to an inability to know what
sort of a message a message is. At one end of the classifica-
tion of those, there will be more or less hebephrenic in-
dividuals for whom no message is of any particular definite

type but who live in a sort of chronic shaggy-dog story.
At the other end are tlJose who try to overidentify, to
make an overly rigid identification of what sort of a messa~e
every message is. This

type of picture. Withdrawal IS another pOSSIbIlity..
.
Finally, it seems to me that with a
h~otheslS of ~
kind
one could look for the determinants ill a population
whi~h might lead to the occurrence of that sO.J;t of con-
stellation. This would seem to me an appropriate matter for
epidemiological study.
Toward a Theory of Schizophrenia*
Schizophrenia-its nature, etiology, and the kind of
therapy to use for it-remains one of the most puzzling
of the mental illnesses. The theory of schizophrenia pre-
sented here is based on communications analysis, and
specifically on the Theory of Logical Types. From this
theory and from observations of schizophrenic patients
is deriVed a description, and the necessary conditions for,
a situation called the "double bind"-a situation in which
no matter what a person does, he "can't win." It is
hypothesized that a person caught in the double bind
may develop schizophrenic symptoms. How and why
the double bind may arise in a family situation is dis-
cussed, together with illustrations from clinical and ex-
perimental data.
This is a reportl
on a research project which has been
formulating and testing a broad, systematic view of the
nature, etiology, and therapy of schizophrenia. Our research

of data and ideas, with all of us contributing according to

analysis, psychotherapy, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis. We
have now reached common agreement on the broad outlines
of a communicational theory' of the origin and nature of
schizophrenia; this paper is a preliminary report on our con-
tinuing research.
.
The Base in Communications Theory
Our approach is based on that part of communications
theory which Russell has called the Theory of Logical Types.2
The central thesis of this theory is that there is a discon-
tinuity between a class and its members. The class cannot
be a member of itself nor can one of the members be
the. class, since the term used for the class is of a different
level at abstraction--a different Logical Type-from terms
used for members. Although in formal logic there is an at-
tempt to maintain this discontinuity between. a class and
its members, we argue that in the psychology of real com-
munications this discontinuity is continually and inevitably
breached,s and that a priori we must expect a pathology
to occur in the human organism when certain formal pat-
terns of the breaching occur in the communication between
continued, financed by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation.
To Jay Haley is due credit for recognizing that the symp-
toms of schizophrenia are suggestive of an, inability to
discriminate the Logical Types, and this was amplified
by Bateson, who added the notion that the symptoms and
etiology could be formally described in terms of a dou-
ble bind hypothesis. The hypothesis was communicated
to D. D. Jackson and found to fit closely with his ideas
of family homeostasis. Since then Dr. Jackson has worked
closely with the project. The study of the formal analo-
gies between hypnosis and schizophrenia has been the
work of John H. Weakland and Jay Haley.

mother and child. We shall argue that this pathology at its
extreme will have symptoms whose formal characteristics
would lead the pathology to be classified as a schizophrenia.
Illustrations of how human beings handle communication
involving multiple Logical Types can be derived from the
following fields:
1. The use at various communicational modes in human
communication. Examples are play, nonplay, fantasy, sacra-
ment, metaphor, etc. Even among the lower mammals there
appears to be an exchange of signals which identify certain
meaningful behavior as "play," etc.4 These signals are evi-
dently of higher Logical Type than the messages they classify.
Among human beings this framing and labeling of messages
and meaningful actions reaches considerable complexity, with
the peculiarity that our vocabulary for such discrimina-
tion is still very poorly developed, and we rely preponder-
antly upon nonverbal media of posture, gesture, facial ex-
pression, intonation, and the context for the communication
of these highly abstract, but vitally important, labels.
2. Humor. This seems to be a mettlOd of exploring the
implicit themes in thought or in a relationship. The method of
exploration involves the use Of messages which are char-
acterized by a condensation of Logical Types or communi-
cational modes. A discovery, for example, occurs when it
suddenly becomes plain that a ~essage was not only meta-
phoric but also more literal, or vice versa. That is to say,
the explosive moment in humor is the moment when the
labeling of the mode undergoes a dissolution and resyntheSiS.
Commonly, the punch line compels a r.e-evaluation of earlier
signals which ascribed to certain messages a particular mode
(e.g., literalness or fantasy). This has the peculiar effect
of attributing mode to those signals which had previously
the status of that higher Logical Type which classifies the
modes.
3. The falsification of mode-identifying signals; Among hu-
man beings mode identifiers can be falsified, and we have
the artificial laugh, the manipulative simulation of friendliness,
the confidence trick,kidding, and the like.
S~ilar falsifica-
• A film prepared by this project, "The Nature of
Play; Part I, River Otters," is available.

204
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
tions have been recorded among mammals.6 Among human
beings we meet with a strange phenomenon-the uncon-
scious falsification of these Signals. This may occur within
the self-the subject may conceal from himself his own real
hostility under the guise of metaphoric play-or it may occur
as an unconscious falsification of the subject's understanding
of the other person's mode-identifying signals. He may mis-
take shyness for contempt, etc. Indeed most of the errors of
self-reference fall under this head.
4. Learning. The simplest level of this phenomenon is
exemplified by a situation in which a subject receives a
message and acts appropriately on it: "I heard the clock
strike and knew it was time for lunch. So I went to the
table." In learning experiments the analogue of this se-
quence of events is observed by the experimenter and com-
monly treated as a single message of a higher type. When
the dog salivates between buzzer and meat powder, this
sequence is accepted by the experimenter as a message in-
dicating that "The dog has learned that buzzer means meat
powder." But this is not the end of the hierarchy of types
involved. The experimental subject may become more skilled
in learning. He may learn to learn,6 and it is not incon-
ceivable that still higher orders of learning may occur in
human beings.
5. Multiple levels of learning and the Logical Typing at
signals. These are two inseparable. sets of phenomena-in-
separable because the ability to handle the multiple types
of Signals is itself a learned skill and therefore a function
of the multiple levels of learning.

According to our hypothesis, the term "ego function" (as
this term is used when a schizophrenic is described ashav-
ing "weak ego function")
is precisely the process of dis-
criminating communicational modes either within the self or
between the self and others. The schizophrenic exhibits weak-
ness in three areas of such function: (a) He has difficulty in
assigning the correct communicational mode to the messages
he receives from other persons.
(b)
He has difficulty in
assigning the correct communicational mode to those messages
which he himself utters or emits nonverbally. (c) He has
difficulty in assigning the cprrect communicational mode to
his own thoughts, sensations, and percepts.
At this point it is appropriate to compare what was said
in the previous paragraph with von Domarus'7 approach to
the systematic description of schizophrenic utterance. He
suggests that the messages (and thought)
of the schizo-
phrenic are deviant in syllogistic scructure. In place of struc-
tures which derive from the syllogism, Barbara, the schizo-
phrenic,
according to this
theory, uses structures which
identify predicates. An example of such a distorted syllogism
is:
Men die.
Grass dies.
Men are grass.
But as we see it, von Domarus' formulation is only a more
precis&-and therefore valuabl&-way of saying that schizo-
phrenic utterance is rich in metaphor. With that generaliza-
tion we agree. But metaphor is an indispensable tool of
thought and expression-a characteristic of all human com-
munication, even of that of the scientist. The conceptual
models of cybernetics and the energy theories of psycho-
analysis are, after all, only labeled metaphors. The peculiar-
. ity of the schizophreniC is not that he uses metaphors, but
that he uses unlabeled metaphors. He has special difficulty.in
handling signals of that class whose members assign Logical
Types to other Signals.
H our formal summary of the symptomatology is correct

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
and if the schizophrenia of our hypothesis is essentially a
result of family interaction, it should be possible to arrive
a priori at a fonnal description of these sequences of ex-
perience which would induce such a symptomatology. What
is known of learning theory combines with the evident fact
that human beings use context as a guide for mode .dis-
crimination. Therefore, we must look not for some specific
traumatic experience in the infantile etiology but rather for
characteristic sequential patterns. The specificity for which
we search is to be at an abstract or fonnal level. The se-
quences must have this
characteris~c:~at from them. the
patient will acquire the merital habIts whICh are exempli~ed
in schizophrenic communication. That is to say, he must lwe
in a universe where the sequences of events are such that
his unconventivnal communicational habits will be in some
seme appropriate. The hypothesis which we .offer is that
sequences of this kind in the external expenence of ~e
patient are responsible for the inner, conflicts. of Logtcal
Typing. For such unresolvable sequences of experiences, we
use the tenn "double bind."
The Double Bind
The necessary ingredients for a double bind situation, as
we see it, are:
1. Two or more persons. Of these, we designate one,
for purposes of our definition, as the "victim." We do not
assume that the double bind is inflicted by the mother
alone, but that it may be done either by mother alone or
by some combination of mother, father, and/or Siblings.
.
2. Repeated experience. We assume that the double bmd
is a recurrent theme in the experience of the victim. Our
hypothesis does not invoke a single traumatic
e~perience,
but such repeated experience that the double bmd struc- '
ture comes to be an habitual expectation.
I.
3. A primary negative injunction. This may have either of
two fonns: (a) "Do not do so and so, or I will punish you,"
or (b) "H you do not do so and so, I will punish you."
Here we select a context of learning based on avoidance
of punishment rather than a context of reward seeking.
There is perhaps no formal reason for this selection. We as-
sume that the punishment maybe either the withdrawal
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
207
of love or the expression of hate or anger-or most devastat-
ing-the kind of abandonment that results from the parent's
expression of extreme helplessness.8
4. A secondary infunction r,;onflicting with the first at a
more abstract level,· and like the first enforced by punish-
ments or signals which threaten survival. This secondary
injunction is more difficult to describe than the primary for
two reasons. First, the secondary injunction is commonly
communicated to the child by nonverbal means. Posture,
gesture, tone of voice, meaningful action, and the implications
co~cealed in verbal comment may all be used to
cO~lVey
this more abstract message. Second, the secondary injunc-
_tiOl~ .may impinge upon any element of the primary pro-
hibItion. Verbalization of the secondary injunction may, there-
fore, include a wide variety of forms; for example, "Do
not see this as punishment"; "Do not see me as the punish-
ing agent"; "Do not submit to my prOhibitions"; "Do not think
of what you must not do"; "Do not question my love of
which the primary prohibition is (or is not) an example";
and so on. Other examples become possible when the double
bind is inflicted not by one individual but by two. For ex-
ample, one parent may negate at a more abstract level the
injunctions of the other.
5. A tertiary negativeinfunction prohibitingthe victim from
escaping from the field. In a formal sense it is perhaps un-
necessary to list this injunction as a separate item since
the reinforcement at the other two levels involves a threat
to survival, and if the double binds are imposed during
infancy, escape is naturally impOSSible. However, it seems
that in some cases the escape from the field is made im-
possible by certain devices which are not purely negative,
e.g., capricious promises of love, and the like..
6. Finally, the complete set of ingredients is no longer nec-
essary when the victim has learned to perceive his universe
in double bind patterns. Almost any part of a double bind
sequence may then be sufficient to precipitate panic or rage.
8 Our concept of punishment is being refined at present.
It appears to us to involve perceptlial experience in a
way that cannot be encompassed by the notion of "trau-
ma."

The pattern of conflicting injunctions may even be taken
over by hallucinatory voices.o
The Effect of the Double Bind
In the Eastern' religion, Zen Buddhism, the goal is to
achieve enlightenment. The Zen master attempts to bring
about enlightenment in his pupil in various ways.
One
of the things he does is to hold a stick over the pupil's head
and say fiercely, "If you say this stick is real, I will strike you
with it. If you say this stick is not real, I will strike you with
it. If you don't say anything, I will strike you with it." We
feel that the schizophrenic finds himself continually in the
same situation as the pupil, but he achieves something like
disorientation rather than enlightenment. The Zen pupil might
reach up and take the stick away from the master-who
might accept this response, but the schizophrenic has no
such choice since with him there is no not caring about
the relationship, and his mother's aims and awareness are
not like the master's.
We hypothesize that there will be a breakdown in any
individual's ability to discriminate between Logical Types
whenever a double bind situation occurs. The general char-
acteristics of this situation are the following:
(1) When the iiidividual is involved in an intense rela-'
tionship; .that is, a relationship in which he feels it is vitally
important that he discriminate accurately what sort of mes-
sage is being communicated so that he may respond ap-
propriately.
(2) And, the individual is caught in a situat!on in which
the other person in the relationship is expressing two orders
of message and one of these denies the other.
.
(3) And, the individual is unable to comment on the
messages being expressed to correct his discrimination of
what order of message to respond to, i.e., he cannot make
a metacommunicative statement.
We have suggested that this is the sort of situation which

occurs between the preschizophrenic and his mother, but
it also occurs in normal relationships. When a pers,on is caught
in a double bind situation, he will respond defensively in
a manner. similar to the schizophrenic. An individual will
take a metaphorical statement literally when he is in a situa-
tion where he must respond, where he is faced with con-
tradictory messages, and when he is unable to comment on
the contradictions. For example, one day an employee went
home during office hours. A fellow employee called him
at his home, and said lightly, "Well, how did you get
there?" The employee replied, "By automobile." He responded
literally because he was faced with a message which asked
him what he was doing at home when he should have
been at the office, but which denied that this question
was being asked by the way it was phrased.
(Since the
speaker felt it wasn't really his business, he spoke meta-
phorically.) The relationship was intense enough so that
the victim was in doubt how the information would be used
and he therefore responded literally. This is
characteristi~
of anyon~ who feels "on the spot," as demonstrated by the
careful literal replies of a witness on the stand in a court
~al. The schizop~enic feels so terribly on the spot at all
times that he habItually responds with a defensive insistence
on the literal level when it is quite inappropriate, e.g., when
someone is joking.
.
Schizophrenics also confuse the literal and metaphoric in
their o~ utterance when they feel themselves caught in a
double bmd. For example, a patient may wish to criticize
his therapist for being late for an appointment, but he may
be unsure what sort of a message that act of being late
was-particularly if the therapist has anticipated the pa-
tient's ;reaction and apologized for the event. The patient
cannot say,' "Why were you late? Is it because you don't
want to see me today?" This would be an accusation, and
so he shifts to a metaphorical statement. He may then say
"1 knew a fellow once who missed a boat his name wa~
Sam and th? boat almost sunk, .. : etc.," Thus he develops
a. metap~o~cal .story and the therapist may. or may not
~cover m It a comment on ibis being late. The convenient
thing about a metaphor is that it leaves it up to the therapist
(or mother) to see an accusation in the statement if he
chooses, or to ignore it if he chooses. Should the therapist

210
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
accept the accusation in the metaphor, then the patient
can accept the statement he has made about Sam as meta-
phorical. If the therapist points out that this doesn't sound
like a true statement about Sam, as a way of avoiding the
accusation in the story, the patient can argue that there
really was a man named Sam. As an answer to the double
bind situation, a shift to a metaphorical statement brings
safety. However, it also prevents the patient from making the
accusation he wants to make. But instead of getting over
his accusation by indicating that this is a' metaphor, the
schizophrenic patient seems to try to get over the fact that it
is a metaphor by making it more fantastic. If the therapist
should ignore the accusation in the story about Sam, the
schizophrenic may then tell a story about going to Mars
in a rocket ship as a way of putting over his accusation.
The indication that it is a metaphorical statement lies in
the fantasti.c aspect of the metaphor, not in the, signals
which usually accompany metaphors to tell the listener that
a metaphor is being used.
It is not only safer for the victim of a double bind to
shift to a metaphorical order of message, but in an im-
possible situation it is better to shift and become somebody
else, or shift and insist that he is somewhere else. Then
the double bind cannot work on the victim, because it isn't
he and besides he is in a different place. In other words,
the statements which sho,\'I that a patient is disoriented can
be interpreted as ways of defending himseH against the
situation he is in. The pathology enters when the victim
himseH either does not know that his responses are meta-
phorical or cannot say so. To recognize that he was speak-
ing metaphorically he would need to be aware that he was
defending himseH and therefore was afraid of the other
person. To him such an awareness would be an indictment
of the other person and therefore provoke disaster.
If an individual has spent his life in the kind of double
bind relationship described here, his)Vay of relating to peo-
ple after a psychotic break would have a systematic pat-
tern. First, he would riot share with normal people those
Signals which accompany messages to indicate what a person
means. His metacommunicative system-the communications
about communication-would have broken down, and he
would not know what kind of message a message was. If
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
211
a person said to him, "What would you like to do today?"
he would be unable to judge accurately by the context or
by the tone of voice or gesture whether he was being con-
demned -for what he did yesterday, or being offered a
sexual invitation, or just what was meant. Given this in-
ability to judge accurately what a person really means and
an excessive concern with what is really meant, an indi-
vidual might defend himseH by choosing one or more of
several alternatives. He. might, for example, assume that
behind every statement there is a concealed meaning which
is detrimental to his weHare. He w01.!ld then be excessively
concerned with hidden meanings and determined to demon-
strate that he could not be deceived-as he had been all
his life. If he chooses this alternative, he will be continually
searching for meanings behind what people say and behind
chance occurrences in the environment, and he will be
characteristically suspicious and defiant.
He might choose another alternative, and tend to accept
literally everything people say to him; when their tone or
gesture or context contradicted what they said, he might
establish a pattern of laughing off these metacommunica-
tive signals. He wcmld give up trying to discriminate between
levels of message and treat all messages as unimportant or
to be laughed at.
If he didn't become suspicious
of metacommunicative
messages or attempt to laugh them off, he might choose to
try to ignore them. Then he would find it necessary to see
and hear less and less of what went on around him, and
do his utmost to avoid provoking a response in his environ-
ment. He would try to detach his interest from the external
world and concentrate on his own internal processes and,
therefore, give the appearance of being a withdrawn, per-
haps mute, individual.
This is another way of saying that if an individual doesn't
know what sort of message a message is, he may defend
himseH in ways which have been described as paranoid,
hebephrenic, or catatonic.. These three alternatives are not
the only ones. The point is that he cannot choose the one
alternative which would help him to discover what people
mean; he cannot, without considerable help, discuss the
messages of others. Without being able to do that, the hu-
man being is like any seH-correcting system which has lost

its governor; it spirals into never-ending, but always sys-

A Description of the Family Situation
The theoretical possibility of double bind situations stim-
ula~ed us
t~ look. for such communication sequences in the.
schizophremc patient and in his family situation. Toward this
end
wehav~ studied the written and verbal reports of
psychotherapl~ts who have treated such patients
int~nsively;
we have studied tape recordings of psychotherapeutiC inter-
views, both of our own patients and others; we have inter-
viewed and taped parents of schizophrenics; we have had
two mothers and one father participate in intensive psy-
chotherapy; and we have interviewed and taped parents
and patients seen conjOintly.
On the basis. of t?ese.data w.e have developed a hypothesis
a~~ut the fam~ly situation whICh ultimately leads to an in-
diVidual suffenng from schizophrenia. This hypothesis has
not been statistically tested; it selects and emphasizes a
rather simple set of interactional phenomena and does not
atte~pt to desc:ribe comprehensively. the extraordinary com-
pleXIty of a faITIlly relationship.
We hypothesize that the family situation of the schizo-
phrenic has the following general characteristics:
(1) A child whose mother becomes anxious and· with-
~aws if t~e,child responds to her as a loving mother. That
IS, the
chil~ s very existence has a special meaning to the
mother which arouses her anxiety and hostility' when she
is in danger of intimate contact with the child.
(2) A mother to whom feelings of anxiety and hostility
toward the child are not acceptable, and whose way of deny-
ing them is to express overt loving behavior to persuade
the child to respond to her as a loving mother and -to with-
draw from him if he does not. "Loving behavior" does not
necessarily imply "affection"; it can, for example, be set in
a framework of doing the proper thing, instilling "goodness,"
and the like.
(3) The absence of anyone in the family, such as a
strong and insightful father, who can intervene in the rela-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
213
tionship between the mother and child and support the
child in the face of the contradictions involved.
Since this is a formal description we are not specifically
con<;erned with why the mother feels this way about the
child, but we suggest that she could feel this way for
various reasons. It may be that merely having a child arouses
anxiety about herself and her relationships to her own fam-
ily; or it may be important to her that the child is a boy
or a girl, or that the child was born on the anniversary of
one of her own siblings,lO or the child may be in the same
sibling position in the family that she was, or the child may
be special to her for other reasons related to her own emo-
tional problems.
Given a situation with these characteristics, we hypothe-
size that the mother of a schizophrenic will be simultaneously
expressing at least two orders of message.
(For simplicity
in this presentation we shall confine ourselves· to two orders.)
These orders of message can be roughly characterized as
(a) hostile or withdrawing behavior which is aroused when-
ever the child approaches her, and (b) simulated lOVing or
approaching behavior which is aroused when the child re-
sponds to her hostile and withdrawing behavior, as a way
of denying that she is withdrawing. Her problem is to con-
trol her anxiety by controlling the closeness and distance
between herself and her child. To put this another way, if
the mother begins to feel affectionate and close to her child,
she begins to feel endangered and must withdraw from him;
but she cannot accept this hostile act and to deny it must
simulate affection and closeness with her child. The impor-
tant point is that her loving behavior is then a comment on
(since it is compensatory for) her hostile behavior and con-
sequently it is of a difterent or~r of message than the hostile
behavior-it is a message about a sequence of messages.
Yet by its nature it denies the existence of those messages
which it is about, i.e., the hostile withdrawal.
The mother uses the child's responses to affirm that her
behavior is loving, and since the loving behavior is simu-
lated, the child is placed in a position where he must not
accurately interpret her communication if he is to maintain

cipitated by Children," Psychiatry, 1953, 16: 73-80.

214
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
his relationship with her. In other words, he must not
discriminate accurately between orders of message, in this
case the difference between the expression of simulated
feelings
(one Logical Type)
and real feelings
(another
Logical Type). As a result the child must systematically
distort his perception of metacommunicative signals. For ex-
ample, if mother begins to feel hostile (or affectionate) to-
ward her child and also feels compelled to withdraw from
him, she might say, "Go to bed, you're very tired and I
want you to get your sleep." This overtly loving statement
is intended to deny a feeling which could be verbalized
as "Get out of my sight
becaus~ I'm sick of you." If the
child cOrrectly discriminates her metacommunicative signals,
he would have to face the fact that she both doesn't want
him and is deceiving him. by her loving behavior. He would
be "punished" for learning to discriminate orders of messages
accurately. He therefore would tend to accept the idea that
he is tired rather than recognize his mother's deception.
This means that he must deceive himseH about his own in-
ternal state in order to support mother in her deception. To
survive with her he must falsely discriminate his own internal
messages
as well as falsely discriminate the messages of
others.
The problem is compounded for the child because the
mother is "benevolently" defining for him how he feels; she
is expressing overt maternal concern over the fact that he
is tired. To put it another way, the mother is controlling
the child's definitions of his own messages, as well as the
definition of his responses to her (e.g., by saying, "You
don't really mean to say that," if he should criticize her)
by insisting that she is not concerned about herseH but orily
about him. Consequently, the easiest path for the child is
to accept mother's simulated loving behavior as real, and his
desires to interpret what is going on are undermined. Yet
the result is that the mother is withdrawing from him and
defining this withdrawal as the way a loving relationship
should be.
.
_
However, accepting mother's simulated loving behavior
as real also is no solution for the child. Should he make this
false discrimination, he would approach her; this move to-
ward closeness would provoke in her feelings of fear and
helplessness, and she would be compelled to withdraw. But

215
if he then withdrew from her, she would take his with-
drawal as a statement that she was not a loving mother a~d
would either punish him for withdrawing or approach h1m

, An analysis of an incident occurring between a schizo-
phrenic patient and his mother illustrates the double bind
situation. A young man who had fairly well recovered from
an acute schizophrenic episode was visited in the hospital by
~s mother. He was glad to
~ee her and impulSively put
his arm around her shoulders, whereupon she stiffened. He
withdrew his arm and she asked, "Don't you love me any
more?" He then blushed, and she said, "Dear, you must
not be so easily embarrassed and afraid of your feelings."
The patient was able to stay with her only a few minutes
more and following her departure he assaulted an aide and
was put in the tubs.
Obviously, this result could have been avoided if the
young man had been able to say, "Mother, it is obvious
that you become uncomfortable when I put my arm around
you, and that you have difficulty accepting a gesture of affec-
tion from me:' However, the schizophrenic patient doesn't
have this possibility open to him. His intense dependency and
training prevents him from commenting upon his mother's
communicative behavior, though she comments on his and
forces him to accept and to attempt to deal with the com-
plicated sequence. The complications for the patient include
the following:
(1) The mother's reaction of not accepting her son's affec-
tionate gesture is masterfully covered up by her condemna-
tion of him for withdrawing, and the patient denies his per-
ception of the situation by accepting her condemnation.
(2) The statement "Don't you love me any more" in this
context seems to imply:
(a) "I am lovable:'
(b) "You should love me and if you don't you are bad
or at fault:'
(c) ''Whereas you did love me previously you don't any
longer," and thus focus is shifted from his expressing affec-
tion to his inability to be affectionate. Since the patient has
also hated her, she is on good ground here, and he re-
sponds appropriately with guilt, which she then attacks.
(d) "What you just expressed was not affection," and
216
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
or indirectly on that expression. This metacommunicative
le:el the schizophre~c.seems unable to use successfully,11
GIven these charactel1stIcs of the mother, it is apparent why.
If she is denying one order of message, then any statement
about her statements endangers her and she must forbid it.
The~efore, the child grow~ up unskilled in his ability to com-
murncate about commuDlcation and, asa result, unskilled
in determining what people really mean and unskilled in
expressing what he really means, which is essentiaJ for normal
relationships.
In summary, then, we suggest that the double bind na-
ture of the family situation of a schizophrenic results in
placing the child in a position where, if he responds to his
mother's simulated affection, her anxiety will be aroused
and she will punish him (or insist, to protect herself, that
his
overtur~ are simulated, thus confusing him about the
nature of hIS own messages) to defend herself from close-
ness with him. Thus the child is blocked off from intimate
and secure associations with his mother. However, if he does
not make overtures
of affection, she will feel that this
means she is not a loving mother and her anxiety will be
arous.ed. Therefore, she will either punish him for with-
drawmg or make overtures toward the child to insist that
he demonstrate that he loves her. If he then responds.and/
shows her affection, she will not only feel endangered again,
but she may resent the fact that she had to force him to
~esp~nd .. In either case in a relationship, the most important
m
~1S .life and the model for all others, he is punished if
he m~cates love and affection and punished if he does not;
and his escape routes from the situation, such as gaining
support from others; are cut. off. This is the' basic nature of
the double bind relationship between mother and child. This
deSCription has not depicted, of coUrse, the more compli-
cated interlocking gestalt that is the "family" of which the
"mother" is one important part.I2

in order to accept this statement, the patient must deny
what she and the culture have taught him about how one
expresses affection. He must also question the times with
her, lI;Ild with others, when he thought he was experiencing
affection and when they seemed to
treat the situation
as if he had. He experiences here loss-of-support phenom-'
ena. and,is put in doubt about the reliability of past ex-
penence.
(3) The statement, ''You must not be so easily em-
barrassed and afraid ofyour feelings," seems to imply:
(a) "You are not like me and are different from other nice
or normal people because we express our feelings."
(b) "The feelings you express are all right, it's only that
you can't accept them," However, if the stiffening on her
part had indicated "These are unacceptable feelings," then
the boy is told that he should not be embarrassed by un-
acceptable feelings. Since he has had a long training in
what is and is not acceptable to both her and society, he
again comes into conflict with the past. H he is unafraid
of his own feelings
(which mother implies is good), he
should be unafraid of his affection and would then notice
it was she who was afraid, but he must not notice that be-
cause her whole approach is aimed at covering up this short-
coming in herself.
The impossible dilemma thus becomes: "H I am to keep
-
I
my tie to mother, I must not show her that I love her,
but,!f I do not show her that I love her, then I will lose
her.
'
The importance to the mother of her special method of
control is strikingly illustrated by the interfamily situation of
a young woman schizophrenic who greeted the therapist on
their first meeting with the remark, "Mother had to get
married and now I'm here," This statement meant to the
therapist that:
(1) The patient was the result of an illegitimate preg-'
nancy.
,
(2) 'I:his fact was related to her present psychosis (in,
her opinion).
.
(3) "Here" referred to the psychiatrist's office and to the
patient's presence on earth for which she had to be eternally
indebted to her mother, especially since her mother had
sinned and suffered in order to bring her into the world.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
219
(4) "Had to get married" referred to the shotgun nature
of mother's wedding and to the mother's response to pres-
sure that she must marry, and the reciprocal, that she re-
sented the forced nature of the situation and blamed the
patient for it.
Actually, all these suppositions subsequently proved to be
factually correct and were corroborated by the mother dur-
ing an abortive attempt at psychotherapy. The flavor of the
mother's communications to the patient seemed essentially
this: "1 am lovable, lOving, and satisfied with myself. You
are lovable when you are like me and when you do
what I say," At the same time 'the mother indicated to the
daughter both by words and behavior: ''You are physically
delicate, ,llnintelligent, and different from me ('not normal').
You.need me and me. alone because of these handicaps, and
1 WIll take care of you and love you." Thus the patient's
life was a series of beginnings, of attempts at experience,
which would result in failure and withdrawal back to the
maternal hearth and bosom because of the collusion between
her and her mother.
It was noted in collaborative therapy that certain areas
important to the mother's self-esteem were especially con-
flictual situations for the patient. For example, the mother
needed the fiction that she was close to her family and
that a deep love existed between her and her own mother.
By analogy the relationship to the grandmother served as
the prototype for the mother's relationship to her own
daughter. On one occasion when the daughter was seven '
or eight years old, the grandmother in a rage threw a
knife which barely missed the little girl. The mother said
not!hing to the grandmother but hurried the little girl from
the room with the words, "Grandmom'my really loves you."
It is significant that the grandmother took the attitude to-
ward the patient that she was not well enough controlled,
and she used to chide her daughter for being too easy on
the child. The grandmother was living in the house during
one of the patient's psychotic episodes, and the girl took
great delight in throwing various objects at ilie mother and
grandmother while they cowered in fear.
Mother felt herself very attractive as a girl, and she felt
that her daughter resembled her rather closely, although by
damning with faint praise, it was obvious that she felt the

l.
220
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
daughter definitely ran second. One of the daughter's first
acts during a psychotic period was to announce to her mother
that she was going to cut off all her hair. She proceeded
to do this while the mother pleaded with her to stop.
Subsequently the mother would show a picture of herself
as a girl and explain to people how the patient would look
if she only had her beautiful hair.
The mother, apparently without awareness of the signifi-
cance of what she was doing, would equate the daughter's
illness with not being very bright and with some sort of
organic brain difficulty. She would invariably contrast this
with her own intelligence as demonstrated by her own
scholastic record. She treated her daughter with a com-
pletely patronizing and placating manner which was insin-
cere. For example, in the psychiatrist's presence she prom-
ised her daughter that she would not allow her to have
further shock treatments, and as soon as the girl was out
of the room she asked the doctor if he didn't feel she
should be hospitalized and given electric shock treatments.
One clue to this deceptive behavior arose during the mother's
therapy. Although the daughter had had three previous hos-
pitalizations, the mother had never mentioned to the doctors
that she herself had had a psychotic episode when she
discovered that she was pregnant. The family whisked her
away to a small sanitarium in a nearby town, and she was,
according to her own statement, strapped to a bed for six
weeks. Her family did not visit her during this time, and
no one except her parents and her sister knew that she
was hospitalized.
There were two times during therapy when the mother
showed intense emotion. One was in relating her own psy-
chotic experience; the other was on the occasion of her
last visit when she accused the therapist· of trying to drive
her crazy by forcing her to choose between her daughter
and her husband. Against medical advice, she took her daugh-
ter out of therapy.
The father was as involved in the homeostatic aspects
of the. intrafamily situation as the mother. For ex~ple, he
stated that he had to quit his position as an important at-
torney in order to bring his daughter to an area where
competent psychiatric help was available. Subsequently, act-
ing on cues from the patient (e.g., she frequently referred
\.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind·
221
to a character named "Nervous Ned"), the therapist was
able to elicit from him that he h~d hated his job and for
years had been trying to "get out from under," However, the
daughter was made to feel that the move was initiated
for her.
On the basis of our examination of the clinical data, we
:have been impressed by a number
~f observations includ-
ing:
(1) The helplessness, fear, exasperation, and rage which
a double bind situation provokes in the patient, but which
the mother may serenely and un-understandingly pass over.
We have noted reactions in the father that both create
double bind situations, or extend and amplify those created
by the mother, and we have seen the father, passive and
outraged, but helpless, become ensnared in a similar manner
to the patient.
.
(2) The psychosis seems, in part, a way of dealing with
double bind situations to overcome their inhibiting and con-
trolling effect. The psychotic patient may make astute, pithy,
often metaphorical remarks that reveal an insight into the
forces binding him. Contrariwise, he may become rather
expert in setting double bind situations himself.
(3) According to our theory, the communication situation
described is essential to the mother's security, and by in-
ference to the family homeostasis. If this be so, then when
psychotherapy of the patient helps him become less vul-
nerable to mother's attempts at control, anxiety will be pro-
duced in the mother:. Similarly, if the therapist interprets to
the mother the dynamics of the situation she is setting up
with the patient, this should produce an anxiety response in
her. Our impression is that when there is a perduring con-
tact between patient and family (especially when the pa-
tient lives at home during psychotherapy), this leads to a
disturbance
(often severe) in the mother and sometimes
in both mother and father and other siblings.18

Current Position and Future Prospects
Many writers have treated schizophrenia in terms of the
most extreme contrast with any other form of human think-
ing and behavior. While it is an isolable phenomenon, so
much emphasis on the differences from the normal-rather
like the fearful physical segregation of psychotics-does not
help in understanding the problems. In our approach we as-
sume that schizophrenia involves general principles which
are important in all communication and therefore many in-
formative similarities can be found in "normal" communica-
tion situations.
We have been particularly interested in various sorts of
communication which involve both emotional significance and
the necessity of discriminating between orders of message.
Stich situations include play, humor, ritual, poetry, and fic-
tion. Play, especially among animals, we have studied at
some length.a It is a situation which strikingly illustrates the
occurrence of metamessages whose correct discrimination is
vital to the cooperation of the individuals involved; for ex-
ample, false discrimination could easily lead to combat. Rath.
er closely related to play is humor, a continuing subject
of our research. It involves sudden shifts in Logical Types
as well as discrimination of those shifts. Ritual is a field
in which unusually real or literal ascriptions of Logical Type
are made and defended as vigorously as the schizophrenic
defends the "reality" of his' delusions. Poetry exemplifies
the communicative power of metaphor-even very unusual
metaphor-when labeled as such by various signs, as con-
trasted to the obscurity of unlabeled schizophrenic meta-
phor. The entire field of fictional communication, defined as
the narration or depiction of a series of events with more
or less of a label of actuality, is most relevant to the in-
vestigation of schizophrenia. We are not so much concerned
with the content interpretation of fiction-although analysis
of oral and destructive themes is illuminating to the student
of schizophrenia-as with the formal problems involved in
simultaneous existence
of multiple
levels
of message
in
222

223
the fictional presentation of "reality." The drama is especially
interesting in this respect, with both performers and specta-
tors responding to messages about both the actual and the
theatrical real,ity.
We are giving extensive attention to hypnosis. A great ar-
ray of phenomena that occur as schizophrenic symptoms-
hallucinations, delusions, alterations of personality, amnesias,
and so on-ean be produced temporarily in normal sub-
jects with hypnosis. These need not be directly suggested
as specific phenomena, but can be the "spontaneous" result
of an arranged communication sequence. For example, Erick-
sonlo will produce a hallucination by first inducing cata-
lepsy in a subject's hand and then saying, "There is no
conceivable way in which your hand can move, yet when I
give the signal, it must move." That is, he tells the subject
his hand will remain in place; yet it will move, and in no
way the subject can consciously conceive. When Erickson
gives the signal, the subject hallucinates the hand moved,
or hallucinates himseH in a different place and therefore the
hand was moved. This use of hallucination to resolve a
problem posed by contradictory commands which cannot be
discussed seems to us to illustrate the solution of a double
bind situation via a shift in Logical Types. Hypnotic re-
sponses to. direct suggestions or statements also commonly
involve shifts in type, as in accepting the words "Here's a
glass of water" or "You feel tired" as external or internal
reality, or in literal response to metaphorical statements, much
like schizophrenics. We hope.that further study of hypnot-
ic induction, phenomena, and waking will, in this con-
trollable situation, help sharpen our view of the essential
communicational sequences which produce phenomena like
those of schizophrenia.
Another Erickson experiment seems to isolate a double
bind communicational sequence without the specific use of
hypnosis. Erickson arranged a seminar so as to have a young
chain smoker sit next to him and to be without cigarettes;
other participants were briefed on what to do. All was
ordered so that Erickson repeatedly turned to offer the
young man a cigarette, but was always interrupted by a
question from someone so that he turned away, "inadver-

tently" withdrawing the cigarettes from
the young man's
reach. Later another participant asked this ,young man if
he had received the cigarette from Dr. Erickson. He re-
plied, "What cigarette?", showed clearly that he had forgot-
ten the whole sequence, and even refused a cigarette offered
by another member, saying that he was too interested in
the seminar discussion to smoke. This young man seems to
us to be in an experimental situation paralleling the schizo-
phrenic's double bind situation with mother: .a.n important
relationship, contradictory messages (here of glvmg and tak-
ing away), and comment blocked-because there was a
seminar going on, and anyway it was all "inadvertent:" And
note the similar outcome: amnesia for the double bmd se-
quence and reversal from "He doesn't give" to "I don't want."
Although we have been led into these collateral areas,
our main field of observation has been schizophrenia itself.
All of us have worked directly with schizophrenic patients
and much of this case material has been recorded on tape
for detailed study. In addition, we are recording interviews
held jointly with patients and their families, and we are tak-
ing sound motion pictures of mothers and disturbed,. pre-
sumably preschizophrenic, children. Our hope is that these
operations will provide a clearly evident record of the
c~n­
tinuing, repetitive double binding which we
hYR0th~slZe
goes on steadily from infantile beginni~gs in th~ faml~y Sltu~­
tion of individuals WJ;lO become schlzophremc. ThIS baslC
family situation, and the overtly communicational
characte~­
istics of schizophrenia, have been the major focus of this
paper. However, we expect our concepts and some of these
data will also be useful in future work on other, problems
of schizophrenia, such as the variety of other symptoms,
the character of the "adjusted state" before schizophrenia
becomes manifest, and the nature and circumstances of the
psychotic break.
Therapeutic Implications of this Hypothesis
Psychotherapy itself is a context of multilevel communica-
tion, with exploration of tJ:1e ambiguous lines

literal and metaphoric, or reality and fantasy, and mdeed,
various forms of play, drama, and hypnosis have been used

extensively in therapy. We have been interested in therapy,
and in addition to our own data we have been collecting
and examining recordings, verbatim transcripts, and personal
accoWlts of therapy from other therapists. In this we prefer
exact records since we believe that how a schizophrenic
talks depends greatly, though often subtly, on how another
person talks to him; it is most difficult to estimate what was
really occurring in a therapeutic interview if one has only a
description of it, especially if the description is already in
theoretical terms.
Except for a few general remarks and some speculation,
however, we are not yet prepared to comment on the
relation of the double bind to psychotherapy. At present we
can only note:
(1) Double bind situations are created by and within
the psychotherapeutic setting and the hospital milieu. From
the point of view, of this hypothesis, we wonder about the
effect of medical "benevolence" on the schizophrenic pa-
tient. Since hospitals exist for the benefit of personnel as well
as-as much as-more than-for the patient's benefit, there
will be contradictions at. times in sequences where actions
are taken "benevolently" for the patient when actually they
are intended to keep the staff more comfortable. We would
assume that whenever the system is organized for hospital
purposes and it is announced to the ,Patient that .the. ac-
tions are for his benefit, then the schizophrenogemc SItua-
tion is being perpetuated. This kind of deception will pro-
voke the patient to respond to it as a double bind situation,
and his response will be "schizophrenic" in the sense that
it will be indirect and the patient will be Wlable to comment
on the fact that he feels that he. is being deceived. One
vignette, fortunately amusing,
iIl~strates
su~ a
r~s~ons~.
On a ward with a dedicated and 'benevolent
phySICIan ill
charge there was a sign on the physician's door which said
"Doctor's Office. Please Knock." The doctor was driven to
distraction and finally capitulation by the obedient patient
who carefully knocked every time he passed the door.
(2) The Wlderstanding of the. double bind and its com-
municative aspects may lead to innovations in therapeutic
technique. Just what these innovations may be is difficult
to say, but on the basis of our investigation we are assuming
that double bind situations occur consistently in psycho-

226
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
therapy. At times these are inadvertent in the
se~s~ that
the therapist is imposing Ii- double bind sttuation snmlar to
that in the patient's history, or the patient is imposing a
double bind situation on the therapist. At other times thera-
pists seem to impose double binds, either deliberately or
intuitively, which force the patient to respond. differently,
than he has in the past.
An incident from the experience of a gifted psychothera-
pist illustrates the intuitive understanding of a double bind
communicaQonal sequence. Dr. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann16
was treating a young woman who from the age of seven h~d
built· a highly complex religion of her own replete With
powerful gods. She was very schizophrenic and quite hesi-
tant about entering into a therapeutic situation. At the be-
ginning of the treatment she said, "God R .says.! shouldn:t
talk with you." Dr. Fromm-Reichmann replied, . Lo~k,
l~t s
get something into the record. To me God R doesn t eXISt,
and that whole world of yours doesn't exist. To you it does,
and far be it from me to think ,that I can take that away
from you, 1 have no idea what it means. So I'm willing
to talk with you in terms of that world, if only you know
I do it so that we have an understanding that it doesn't exist
for me. Now go to God' R and tell him that we have to
talk and he should give you permission. Also you must teU
him that I am a doctor and that you have lived with him
in his kingdom now from seven to sixteen-that's nine years
-and he hasn't helped you. So now' he must permit me
to try and see whether you and I can do that job. Tell
him that I am a doctor and this is what I want to try."
The therapist has her patient in a "therapeutic
dou~le
bind:' If the patient is rendered doubtful about her belief
in her god, then she is agreeing with Dr. Fromm-Reic~a~,
and is admitting her attachment· to therapy. If she
ill,SISts
that God R is real, then she must tell him that Dr. Fromm-
Reichmann is "more powerful" than he-again admitting her
involvement with the therapist.
The difference between the therapeutic bind and the
original double bind situation is in pait the fact that
~w
therapist is not involved in a life and death struggle him-

and gradually aid the patient in his emancipation from them.
Many of the uniquely appropriate therapeutic gambits ar-
ranged by therapists seem to be intuitive. We share the
goal of most psychotherapists who strive toward the day
when such strokes of genius will be weB enough understood
to bc:l systematic and commonplace.

they stress change or learning exhibited by the subjects. De-
spite our following its conventional use,
this word is a
misnomer. It evokes analOgies with physics which are totally
false.
"Dynamics" is principally a language devised by physi-
cists and mathematicians for the description of certain events.
In this strict sense, the impact of one billiard balI upon an-
other is subject matter for dynamics, but it would be an
error of language to say that billiard baIls "behave." Dynam-
ics appropriately describe those events whose descriptions
can be checked by asking whether they contravene the
First Law of Thermodynamics, the Law of the Conserva-
tion of Energy. When one billiard balI strikes
another,
the motion of the second is energized by the impact of the
first, and such transferences of energy are the central sub-
ject matter of dynamics. We, however, are not concerned
\ with event sequences which have this characteristic. If I
kick a stone, the movement of the stone is energized by
the act, but if I kick a dog, the behavior of the dog
may indeed be partly conservative-he may travel along a
Newtonian trajectory if kicked hard enough, but this is mere
physics. What is important is that he may exhibit responses
which are energized not by the kick but by his metabolism;
he may turn and bite.
This, I think, is what people mean by magic. The realm
of phenomena in which we are interested is always char-
acterized by the fact that "ideas" may influence events.
To the physicist, this is a grossly magical hypothesis. It is
one which cannot be tested by asking questions about the
conservation of energy.
All this, however, has been better and more rigorously
said by Bertalanffy, which makes it easier for me to further
explore this realm of phenomena in which communication
occurs. We shall settle for the conventional term "dynamics"
provided it is clearly understood that we are not talking
about dynamics in the physical sense.
Robert Louis Stevensonl in "The Poor Thing" has achieved
perhaps the most vivid characterization of this magical realm:

The Group Dynamics of Schizophrenia*
First, I intend to attach very specific meaning to the title
of this paper. An essential notion attached to the word
"group" as I shall use it is the idea of relatedness between
members. Our concern is not with the.sort of phenomena
which occur in experimentally formed groups of graduate
students who have no previously determined habits of com-
munication-no habitual differentiations of role. The group
to which I mostly refer is the family; in general, ·those fami-
lies in which the parents maintain an adjustment to the w.orId
around them without being recognized as grossly deVIant,
while one or more of their offspring differ conspicuously
from the normal population in the frequency and obvious
nature of their responses. I shall also be thinking of other
groups analogous to these, i.e., ward organizations, which
work in such a way as to promote schizophrenic or schizo-
phrenoid behavior in some of the members.

for all studies of personal interaction and especially when

from the point of view of communications theory, they could
have been anything from aardvarks to zygomatic arches.
It might well be sufficiently confusing to be told that,
according to the conventions of communication in use at the
moment, anything can stand for anything else. But this
realm of magic is not that simple. Not only can the shoe
of a horse stand for· anything else according to the con-
ventions of communication, it can also and simultaneously
be a signal which will alter the conventions of communica-
tion. My fingers crossed behind my back may alter the whole
tone and implication of everything. I recall a schizophrenic
patient who, like many other schizophrenics, had difficulty
with the first person pronoun; in particular, he did not like
to sign his name. He had a number of aliases, alternative
named aspects of self. The ward organization, of which he
was a part, required that he sign his name to obtain a pass,
and for one or two weekends he did not receive a pass
because he insisted on signing one of his aliases.
One
day. he remarked that he was going out the next weekend.
I said, "Oh, did you sign?" He said, "Yes," with an odd grin.
His real name, we will say, was Edward W. Jones. What
he had actually signed was "w. Edward Jones." The ward
officials did not notice the difference. It appeared to them
that they had won !' battle and had succeeded in forcing
him to act sanely. But to himself the message was, "He
(the real me) did not sign." He had won the battle. It was
as if his fingers were crossed behind his back.
All communication has this characteristie--it can be magi-
cally modified by accompanying communication. In this con-
ference, we have been discussing various ways of interact-
ing with patients, describing what we do and what our
strategy seems to us to be. It would have been more difficult
to discuss our actions from the patients' point of view. How
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
231
do we qualify our communications to the patients, so that
the experience which they receive will be therapeutic?
Appleby, for example, described a set of procedures on
his ward, and if I were a schizophrenic listening to him,
I would have been tempted to say, "It all sounds like oc-
cupational therapy to me." He tells us very convincingly
and with figures that his program is successful, and in docu-
menting his success he is no doubt telling the truth. If this
is so, then his description of the program must necessarily
be incompl~te. The experiences which the program provides
for the patients must be something a little more alive than
the dry bones of the program which· he has described. The
whole series of therapeutic procedures must have been
qualified, possibly with enthusiasm or with humor with some
set of signals which altered the mathematical Si~-plus or
minus-of what was being done. Appleby has told us only
about the shoe of the horse, not about the multitude of
realities which determined for what that horseshoe stood.

environmental impact. It follows, therefore, that the differ-

be one which modifies or modulates the whole system of
genetic messages, so that every message in the system
takes on a different look while retaining its former relation-
ship to all neighboring messages. It is, I believe, this stability
of the relationship between messages under the impact of
the change in one part of the constellation that provides a
basis for the French aphorism "Plus (:a change,. plus c'est
la ,mbne chose."
It is a reCOgnized fact that the skulls
of the various anthropoids can be drawn upon diversely
skewed coordinates to demonstrate the fundamental similarity
of relations and the systematic nature of the transformation
from one species to another.2
My father was it geneticist, and he used to say, "It's
all vibrations,"3 and to illustrate this he would point out
that the striping of the common zebra is an .octave higher
than that of Grevy's zebra. While it is true that in this par-
ticular case the "frequency" is doubled, I don't think that it
is entirely a matter of vibrations as he endeavored to ex-
plain it. Rather, he was trying to say that it is all a matter
of the sort of modifications which could be expected among
systems whose determinants are not a matter of physics in the
crude sense, but a matter of messages and modulated sys-
tems of messages.
It is worth noting, too, that perhaps organic forms are beau-
tiful to us and the systematic biologist can find aesthetic
satisfaction in the differences between related organisms sim-
ply because the differences are due to modulations of com-
munication, while we ourselves are both organisms who com-
municate and whose forms are determined by constellations
of genetic messages. This is not the place, however; for such
a revision of aesthetic theory. An expert in the theory of
mathematical groups could make a major contributiop. in this
field.
All messages and parts of messages are like phrases or seg-
ments of equations which a mathematician puts in brackets.
Outside the brackets there may always be a qualifier or mul-
tiplier which will alter the whole tenor of the phrase. More-
over, these qualifiers can always be added, even years later.

They do not have to precede the phrase inside the brackets.
Otherwise, there could be no psychotherapy. The patient
would be entitled and even compelled to argue, "My mother
slapped me down in such and such ways, and, therefore,
I am now sick; and because those traumata occured in the
past they cannot be altered, and I, therefore, cannot get
well:' In the realm of communication, the events of the
past constitute a chain of old horseshoes so that the mean-
ing of that chain can be changed and is continually being
changed. What exists today are only messages about the
past which we call memories, and these messages can al-
ways be framed and modulated from moment to moment.
Up to this point the realm of communication appears to
be more and more complex, more flexible, and less amenable
to analysis. Now the introduction of the group concept-
the consideration of many persons-suddenly simplifies this
confused realm of slipping and sliding meanings. H we shake
up a number of irregular stones in a bag, or subject them
to an almost random beating by the waves on the seashore,
even at the crudely physical level, there will be a gradual
simplification of the system-the stones will resemble each
other. In the end, they will all become spherical, but in
practice we usually encounter them as partly rounded peb-
bles. Certain forms of homogenization result from multiple
impact .even at the crude physical level, and when the im-
pacting entities are organisms capable of complex learning
and communication, the total system operates rapidly to-
ward either uniformity or toward systematic differentia-
tion-an increase of simplicity-which we call organization.
H there are differences between the impacting entities, these
differences will undergo change, either in the direction of
reducing the difference, or in the direction of achieving a
mutual fitting or complementarity. Among groups of people,
whether the direction of change is toward homogeneity or
toward complementarity, the achievement is a sharing of
premises regarding the meaning and appropriateness of mes-
sages and other acts in the context of the relationship.
I shall not go into the complex problems of learning in-
volved in this process but shall proceed to the problem of
schizophrenia. An individual, i.e., the identified patient, exists
within a family setting, but when we view him singularly,
certain pecularities of his communicational habits are noted.

says makes sense. To be close to that parent, he must sacri-
.fice his right to indicate that he sees any metacommunicative
incongruencies, even when his perception of these incon-
gruen~ie~ is ?orrect. There is, therefore, a curious disparity in
the dIstribution of awareness of what is happening. The pa-

is an accomplice in the parent's unconscious hypocrisy. The

Moreover, these distortions are always precisely those which
would seem appropriate when the victims are faced with a

Notice that Dunkett could only invent this double bind
j
for rats by way of an hallucinatory experience, and that
both Butler and Jones immediately regarded the trap as a
paradigm for human relations. Indeed, this sort of dilemma
is not rare and is not confined to the contexts of schizo-
phrenia.
The question which we must face, therefore, is why these
sequences are either specially frequent or specially destruc-
238
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
Butler went to dinner at Mr. Seebohm's where he met
Skertchley, who told them about a rat-trap invented by
Mr. Tylor's coachman.
DUNKEIT'S RAT-TRAP
Mr. Dunkett found all his traps fail one after another,
and was in such despair at the way the corn got eaten
that he resolved to invent a rat-trap. He began by putting
himself as nearly as possible in the rat's place.
"Is there anything," he asked himself, "in which, if
I were a rat, I should have such complete confidence
that I could not suspect it without suspecting everything
in the world and being unable henceforth to move fear-
lessly in any direction?"
He pondered for a while and had no answer, till one
night the room seemed to become full of light and he
hears a voice from heaven saying:
"Drain-pipes."
Then he saw his way. To suspect a common drain-
pipe would be to cease to be a rat. Here Skertchley
enlarged a little, explaining that a spring was to be con-
cealed inside, but that the pipe was to be open at both
ends; if the pipe were closed at one end, a rat would
naturally not like going into it, for he would not feel
sure of being able to get out again; on which I [Butler]
interrupted and said:
"Ab, it was just this which stopped me from going in-
to the Church."
When he [Butler] told me this I [Jones] knew what
was in his mind, and that, if he had not been in such
respectable company, he would have said: "It was just
this which stopped me from getting married."

239
tive in those families which contain schizophrenics. I do not
have the statistics to assert this; however,. from limited but
intense observation of a few of these families, I can offer an
hypothesis about the group dynamics which would deter-
mine a system of interaction, such that double bind experi-
ences must recur ad nauseam. The problem is to construct
a model which will necessarily cycle to ·recreate these pat-
terned sequences over and over again.
Such a model is provided in Von Neumann's and Mor-
genstern'sO theory of games, presented here not, indeed,
with its full mathematical rigor, but at least in tenns some-
what technical.
Von Neumann was concerned with mathematical study
of the fonnal conditions under which entities, with total in-
telligence and a preference for gain, would fonn coalitions
among themselves in order to maximize the profits which coali-
tion members might receive at the expense of the non-
members. He imagined these entities as engaged in some-
thing like a game and proceeded to ask about the fonnal
characteristics of the rules which 'r'I'ould compel the totally
intelligent but gain-oriented players to fonn coalitions. A very
curious conclusion emerged, and it is this conclusion which I
would propose as a model.
Evidently, coalition between players can only emerge when
there are at least three of them. Any two may then get
together to exploit the third, and if such a game be sym-
metrically devised, it evidently has three solutions which we
may represent as
AB vs. C
BCvs. A
ACvs. B
For this three-person system, Von Neumann demonstrates
that once fonned, anyone of these coalitions will be stable.
H A and B are in alliance, there is nothing C can do about
it. And, interestingly enough, A and B will necessarily de-
velop conventions (supplementary to the rules) which will,
for example, forbid them from listening to C's approaches.

Games and Economic Behavior, Princeton, Princeton

In the five-person game, the position becomes quite differ-
ent; there will be a variety of possibilities. It may be that
four players contemplate a combination against one, illus-
trated in the following five patterns:

But none of these would be stable. The four players

But in the system 3 vs. 2, it would be advantageous for

the three to recruit over to their side one of the two, in
order to make their gains more certain. Now we are back to
a 4 vs. 1 system-not necessarily the particular line-up that
we started from but at any rate a system having the same
general properties. It, in turn, must break down into 2 vs. 2 ;
~~~OO~
t
In other words, for every possible pattern of coalitions, 'Ii
there is at least one other pattern which will "dominate"
it-to use Von Neumann's term-and the relationship of
domination between solutions is intransitive. There will al-

solution, always selecting another solution which is preferable .
to that which preceded it. This means, in fact, that the
robots (owing to their total intelligence) will be unable to
decide upon a single "play" of the game.
I offer this model as being reminiscent of what happens
in schizophrenic families. No two members seem able to get
together in a coalition stable enough to be decisive at the
given moment. Some other member or members of the
family will always intervene. Or, lacking such intervention, the
two members who contemplate a coalition will feel guilty
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
241
vis-a-vis what the third might do or say, and will draw back
from the coalition.
Notice that it takes five hypothetical entities with total
intelligence to achieve this particular sort of instability or
oscillation in a Von Neumannian game. But three human
be~gs seem to be enough. Perhaps they are not totally in-
telligent or perhaps they are systematically inconsistent re-
garding the sort of "gain" in terms of which they are moti-
vated.
I want to stress that in such a system, the experience of
each separate individual will be of this kind: every move
which he makes is the common-sense move in the situation as
he correctly sees it at that moment, but his every move is
subsequently demonstrated to have been wrong by the
moves which other·members of the system make in response
to his "right" move. The individual is thus caught in a
perpetual sequence of what we have called double bind
experiences.
I do not know how valid this model may be, but I offer
it for two reasons. First, it is proposed as a sample of trying
to talk about the larger system-the family-instead of talk-
ing, as we habitually. do, about the individual. If we are to
understand the dynamics of schizophrenia, we must devise
~ lan.guage adequate to the phenomena which are emergent
m this larger system. Even if my model is inappropriate it is
still worthwhile to try to talk in the sort of language ~hich ,
we shall need for describing these emergent phenomena.
Secondly, conceptual models, even when incorrect, are useful
to the extent that criticism of the model may point to new
theoretical developments.
Let me, therefore, point out one criticism of this model,
and consider to what ideas it will lead. There is no theorem
in Von Neumann's book which would indicate that his entities
o.r robots, engaged in this infinite dance of changing coali-
tions, would ever become schizophrenic. According to the
abstract theory, the entities simply remain totally intelligent
ad infinitum.
Now, the major difference between people and von Neu-
m~'s r~bots. lies in th~ fac~ of learning. To be infinitely in-
telligent unplies to be infirntely flexible, and the players in
the dance which I have described could never experience
the pain which human beings would feel if continually

have a commitment to the solutions which they discover, and ..
it is this psychological commitment that makes it possible ell
for ~em to be hurt in the way members of a schizophrenic tl
famIly arehurt.C:1
It appears then, from consideration of the model, that the
I
double bind hypothesis, to be explanatory of schizophrenia,
j
must depend upon certain psychological assumptions about
I
the nature of the human individual as a learning organism.
.-
For the individual to be prone to schizophrenia, individua-
tion must comprise two contrasting psychologicalmecha-
nisms. The first is. a mechanism of adaptation to demands of
the personal environment; and the second, a process or
mechanism whereby the individual becomes either briefly
or enduringly committed to the adaptations which the first
process has discovered.
I think that what I am calling a brief commitment to an
adaptation is what BertalanfIy called the imma~nt state of
action; and that the more enduring commitment to adapta-
tion is simply what we usually call "habit,"
What is a personP What do I mean when I say ClIP" Per-
haps what each of us means by the "self" is in fact an
aggregate of habits of perception and adaptive action plus.
from moment to moment, our "immanent states .of action," If
somebody attacks the habits and immanent states which
characterize me at the given moment of dealing with that
somebody-that is, if they attack the very habits and imma-
nent states which have been called into being as part of my
relationship to them at that moment-they are negating me.
If I care deeply about that other person-the negation of me
will be still more painful.
What we have said so far is enough to indicate the sorts
of strategy-or perhaps we should say symptoms-which are:;
to be expected in that strange institution. the schizophreniC ,0
family. But it is still surprising to observe how these strategies 't
may be continually and habitually practiced without friends
and neighbors noticing that something is wrong. From theory
we may predict that every participant member of such an
institution must be defensive of his or her own immanent
states of action and enduring adaptive habits; protective, ;
that is, of the self.
To illustrate with one example: a colleague had been
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
243
worJ<.ing for some weeks with one of these families, particular.
ly WIth the father, the mother, and their adult schizophrenic
son. His meetings were on the conjoint pattern-the mem-
bers of the family being present together. This apparently
provoked some anxiety in the mother and she requested
face-to-face interviews with me. This move was discussed at
the next conjoint meeting and in due course she came to her
first session. Upon arrival she made a couple of conversational
remarks, and then opened her purse and from it handed me a
piece of paper, saying, "It seems my husband wrote this," I
unfolded the paper and. found it to be a single sheet of
single-spaced typescript, starting with the words, "My hus-
band and I much appreciate the opportunity of discussing
our problems with you," etc. The document then went on to
outline certain specific questions which "I would like to
raise."
It appeared that the husband had, in fact, sat down at his
typewriter the night before and had written this letter to me
as though it were written by his wife, and in it he outlined
the questions for her to discuss with me.
In normal daily life this sort of thing is common enough;
it passes muster. When attention is focused upon the charac-
teristic strategies, however, these self-protecting and self.
destroying maneuvers become conspicuous. One suddenly
discovers that in such families these strategies seem to pre-
dominate over all others. It becomes hardly surprising that the
identified patient exhibits behavior which is almost a carica-
ture of that loss of identity which is characteristic of all the
family members.
.
I believe that this is the essence of the matter, that the
schizophrenic family is an organization with great ongoing
stability whose dynamics and inner workings are such that
each member is continually undergoing the experience of
negation of self.

---------------------------
Minimal Requirements for a Theory of
Schizophrenia*
Every science, like every person, has a duty toward its
neighbors, not perhaps to love them as itself, but still to lend
them its tools, to borrow tools from them, and, generally, to
ke~p the neighboring sciences straight. We may perhaps
judge of the importance of an advance in anyone science in
terms of the changes which this advance compels the neigh-
boring sciences to make in their methods and in their think-
ing. But always there is the rule of parsimony. The changes
which we in the behavioral 5ciences may ask for in genetics,
or in philosophy, or in information theory must always be
minimal. The unity of science as a whole is achieved by this
system of minimal demands imposed by each science upon
its neighbors, and-not a littl~by the lending of conceptual
tools and patterns which occurs among the various sciences.
My purpose, therefore, in the present lecture is not so
much to discuss the particular theory of schizophrenia which
we have been developing at Palo Alto. Rather, I want to
indicate to you that this theory and others like it have impact
upon ideas about the very nature of explanation. I have used
the title "Minimal Requirements for a Theory of Schizo-
• Second' Annual Albert D. Lasker Memorial Lecture,
delivered at the Institute for Psychosomatic and Psy-
chiatric Research and Training of the Michael Reese
Hospital, Chicago, April 7, 1959. This lecture is here

phrenia," and what I had in mind in choosing this title was a
discussion of the implications of the double bind theory for
the wider field of behavioral science and even, beyond that,
its effect upon evolutionary theory and biological episte-
mology. What minimal changes does this theory demand in
related sciences?
I want to deal with questions about the impact of an
experiential theory of schizophrenia upon that triad of re-
lated sciences, learning theory, genetics, and evolution.
The hypothesis may fustbe briefly described. In its essen-
tials, the idea appeals -only to everyday experience, and
elementary common sense. The first proposition from which
the hypothesis is derived is that learning occurs always in
some context which has formal characteristics. You may
think, if you will, of the formal characteristics of an instru-
mental avoidance sequence, or of the formal characteristics
of a Pavlovian experiment. To learn to lift a paw in a
Pavlovian context is different from learning the same action
in a context of instrumental reward.
Further, the hypothesis depends upon the idea that this
structured context also occurs within a wider context-a
metacontext if you will-and that this sequence of contexts
is an open, and conceivably infinite, series.
The hypothesis also assumes that what occurs within the
narrow context (e.g., instrumental avoidance) will be af-
fected by the wider context within which this smaller one
has its being. There may be incongruence or conflict be-
tween context and metacontext.
A context of Pavlovian
learning may, for example, be set within a metacontext
which would punish learning of this kind, perhaps by insist-
ing upon insight. The organism is then faced with the
dilemma either of being wrong in the primary context or of
being right for the wrong reasons or in a wrong way. This is
the so-called double bind. We are investigating the hypoth-
esis that schizophrenic communication is learned and be-
comes habitual as a result of continual traumata of this kind.
That is all there is to it.
But even these "common-sense" assumptions break away
from the classical rules of scientific epistemology. We have
learned from the paradigm of the freely falling body-and
from many similar paradigms in many other sciences-to
approach scientific problems in a peculiar way: the problems

246
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
are to be simplified by ignoring-or postponing consideration
of-the possibility that the larger context may influence ~e
smaller. Our hypothesis runs counter to this rule, and
IS
focused preQisely upon the determining relations between
larger and smaller contexts.
Even more shocking is the fact that our hypothesis suggests
-but does not stand or fall with the /luggestion-that there
may be an infinite regress of such rele~ant contex~.
In all of this, the hypothesis reqwres and reinforc~ th~t
revision in scientific thought which has been oceurnng ill
many fields from physics to biology. The observer must be
. cluded within the .focus of observation, and what can be
:tudied is always a relationship or an infinite regress of rela-
tionships. Never a "thing."
.
An example will make clear the relevance .of. the
l~ger
contexts. Let us consider the larger context WIthi~ whICh .a
learning experiment might be conducted using a schizophr~mc
as a subject. The schizophrenic is what is called a
~ati~nt,
vis-a-vis a member of a superior and unloved organlZatiO~,
the hospital staff. If the patient were a good
pra~atic
Newtonian
he would be able to say to himself:
The
cigarettes ~hich I can get by doing what this fellow expe.ctB
me to do are after all only cigarettes, and as an applied
scientist I will go ahead and do what he wants.me to U? I
will solve the experimental problem. and
o~tam th~ CIga-
rettes." But human beings, and especIally schlZophremcs, do
not always see the matter this way. They are affected by the
circumstance that the experiment is being conducted by
somebody whom they would rather not please. T}1ey may
even feel that there would be a certain shamelessness about
seeking to please some one whom they dislike. It th~ comes
about that the sign of the signal which the expenmenter
emits, giving or withholding cigarettes, is reversed. What the
experimenter thought was a reward turns out to be a message
of partial indignity, and what the experimenter ~ought was
a punishment becomes in part a source of satisf~ctio~.
Consider the acute pain of the mental patient ill a large
hospital who is momentarily treated as a human being by a
member of the staff.
To explain the observed phenomena we always have to
consider the wider context of the learning experiment, and
every transaction between persons is a context of learning.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
247
The double bind hypothesis, then, depends upon attrib-
uting certain characteristics to the learning process. If this
hypothesis is even approximately true, room must be made
for it within the theory of learning. In particular, learning
theory must be made discontinuous so as to accommodate the
discontinuities of the hierarchy of the contexts of learning to
which I have referred.
Moreover, these discontinuities are of a peculiar nature. I
have /laid that the larger context may change the sign of the
reinforcement proposed by a· given message, and evidently
the larger context may also change the mode--may place
the message in the category of humor, metaphor, etc. The
setting may make the message inappropriate. The message
may be out of tune with the larger context, and so on. But
there are limits to these modifications. The context may tell
the recipient anything about the message, but it cannot ever
destroy or directly contradict the latter. "I was lying when
I said 'The cat is on the mat''' tells the vis-a-vis nothing
about the location of the cat. It tells him only something
about the reliability of his previous information. There is a
gulf between context and message (or between metamessage
and message) which is of the same nature as the gulf be-
tween a thing and the word or sign which stands for it, or
between the members of a class and the name of the class.
The context (or metamessage) classifies the message, but
can never meet it on equal terms.
In order to fit these discontinuities into learning theory, it
is necessary to enlarge the scope of what is to be included
within the concept of learning. What the experimenters have
described as "learning" are in general changes in what an
organism does in response to a given signal. The experi-
menter observes, for example, that at first the buzzer evokes
no regular response, but that after repeated trials in which
the buzzer has been followed by meat powder, the animal
will begin to salivate whenever it hears the buzzer. We may
say loosely that the animal has begun to attach significance
or meaning to the buzzer.
A change has occurred. In order to construct a hierarchic
series, we pick on the word "change." Series such as we are
interested in are in general built in two ways. Within the
field of pure communications theory, the steps of an hierarchic
series may be constructed by successive use of the word

'1971. In my final version of this hierarchy of orders
of learning, published in this volume as "The Logical
Categories of Learning and Communication," (see p.
283) I have used a different system of numbering. The
receipt of a signal is there called "Zero Learning";
changes in Zero Learning are called Learning I; "deutera-
learning" is called Learning II, etc.
"about," or "meta." Our hierarchic series will then consist of
message, metamessage, meta-metamessage, and so on. Where
we deal with phenomena marginal to communications theory,
similar hierarchies may be constructed by the piling up of
"change" upon "change:' In classical physics, the sequence:
position; velocity (i.e., change in position); acceleration (i.e.,
change in velocity or change in change of.position); change
of acceleration, etc., is an example of such a hierarchy.
Further
complications
are
added-rarely
in
classical
physics but comn::only in human communication-by noting
that messages may be about (or "meta" to) the relationship
between messages of different levels. The smell of the ex-
perimental harness may tell the dog that the buzzer will
mean meat powder. We will then say that the message of
the harness is meta to the message of the buzzer. But in
human relations another sort of complexity may be gener-
ated; e.g., messages may be emitted forbidding the subject
to make the meta connection. An alcoholic parent may
punish a child for showing that he knows that he should
look out for storms whenever the parent gets the bottle out
of the cupboard. The hierarchy of messages and contexts
thus becomes a complex branching structure.
So we cali construct a similar hierarchic classification within
learning
theory in
substantially the _same way
as
the
physicists.
What the experimenters have investigated is
change in the receipt of a signal. But, clearly, to receive a
signal already denotes change-a change of a simpler or
lower order than that which the experimenters have in-
vestigated. This gives us the two first steps in a hierarchy of
learning, and above these an infinite series can be iInagined.
This hierarchyl can now be laid out as follows:
(1) The Receipt of a Signal' I am working at my desk
on which there is a paper bag, containing my lunch. I hear
the hospital whistle, and from this I know that it is twelve
o'clock. I reach out and take my lunch. The whistle may be
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
249
regarded as an answer to a question laid down in my mind
by previous learning of the second order; but the single
event-the receiving of this piece of information-is a piece
of learning, and is demonstrated to be so by the fact that
having received it, I am now changed and respond in a
special way to the paper bag.
(2) Those Learnings Which Are Changes in (1)
These
are exemplified by the classical.learning experiments of vari-
ous kinds:
Pavlovian,
instrumental
reward,
instrumental
avoidance, rote, and so on.
(3) Those
Learnings. Which
Constitute
Changes
in
Second-Order Learning
I have in the past, unfortunately
called these phenomena "deutero-Iearning," and have trans:
lated this as
"l~arning to learn:' It would have been more
correct to coin the word trita-learning and to translate it as
<1earning to leam to receive signals." These are the phenom-
ena in which the psychiatrist is preponderantly interested,
namely, the changes whereby an individual comes to ex-
pect his world to be structured in one way rather than an-
other. These are the phenomena which underlie "trans-
ference"-the expectation on a patient's part that the rela-
tionship with the therapist will contain the same sorts of
contexts of learning that the patient has previously met with
in dealing with his parents.
(4) Changes in Those Processes of Change Referred to
in (3)
Whether learning of this fourth order occurs in hu-
man beings is unknown. What the psychotherapist attempts
to produce in his patient is usually a third-order learning, but
it is possible, and certainly conceivable, that some of the
slow and unconscious changes may be shifts in sign of some
higher derivative in the learning process.
At this point it is necessary to compare three types of
hierarchy with which we are faced: (a) the hierarchy of
orders of learning; (b) the hierarchy of contexts of learning,
and (c) hierarchies of circuit structure which we may-
indeed, must-expect to find in a telencephalized brain.
It is my contention that (a) and (b) are synonymous in
the sense that all statements made in terms of contexts of
learning could be translated (without loss or gain) into
statements in terms of orders of learning, and, further, that
the classification or hierarchy of contexts must be isomorphic
with the classification or hierarchy of orders of learning. Be-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
248
I·1j-
-I

250
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
yond this, I believe that we should look forward to a classi-
fication or hierarchy of neurophysiological sb.1lctures which
will be isomorphic with the other two classifications.
This synonymy between statements about context and
statements about orders of learning seems to me to be self-
evident, but experience shows that it must be spelled out.
"The b.1lth cannot be said so as to be understood, and not be
believed," but, conversely, it cannot be believed until it is
said so as to be understood.
It is necessary first to insist that in the world of communica-
tion the only relevant entities or "realities" are messages, in-
cluding in this tenD, parts of messages, relations between
messages, significant gaps in messages, and so on. The per-
ception of an event or object or relation is real. It is .a
neurophysiological message. But the event itself or the ob-
ject itself cannot enter this world and is, therefore, irrelevant
and, to that extent, unreal. Conversely, a message has. no
reality or relevance qua message, in the Newtonian world:
it there is reduced to sound waves or printer's ink.
By the same token, the "contexts" and "contexts of con-
texts" upon which I am insisting are only real or relevant in-
sofar as they are communicationally effective, i.e., function
as messages or modifiers of messages.
The difference between the Newtonian world and the
world of communication is simply this: that the Newtonian
world ascribes reality to objects and achieves its simplicity by
excluding the Context of the context-excluding indeed all
metarelationships-a fortiori excluding an infinite regress of
such relations. In contrast, the theorist of communication in-
sists upon examining the metarelationships while achieving
its simplicity by excluding all objects.
This world, of communication, is a Berkeleyan world, but
the good bishop was guilty of understatement. Relevance or
reality must be denied not only to the sound of the tree
which faIls unheard in ,the forest but also to this chair which
I can see and on which I am sitting. My perception of the
chair is communicationally real, and that on which I sit is, for
me, only an idea, a message in which I put my trust.
'
"In my thought, one thing is as good as another in this
world, and the shoe of a horse will do," because in thought
and in experience there are no things, but only messages and
the like.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
251
In this world, indeed, I, as a material object, have no
relevance and, in this sense, no reality. "I," however, exist in
the communicational world as an essential element in the
syntax of my experience and in the experience of others,
and the communications of others may damage my identity,
even to the point of breaking up the organization of my
experience.
Perhaps one day, an ultimate synthesis will be achieved to
combine the Newtonian and the communicational worlds.
But that is not the purpose of the present discussion. Here I
am concerned to make clear the relation between the con-
texts and the orders of learning, and to do this it was first
necessary to bring into focus the difference between New-
tonian and communicational discourse.
With this introductory statement, however, it becomes
clear that the separation between contexts and orders of
learning is only an artifact of the contrast between these
tw~ sorts of discourse. The separation is only maintained by
saymg that the contexts have location outside the phYSical
individual, while the orders of learning are located inside.
But in the communicational world, this dichotomy is irrele-
vant and meaningless. The contexts have communicational
reality only insofar as they are effective as messages, i.e.,
insofar as they are represented or reflected (correctly or with
distortion) in multiple parts of the communicational system
which we are studying; and this system is not the phYSical
individual but a wide network of pathways of messages.
Some of these pathways happen to be located outside the
physical individual, others inside; but the characteristics of
the, system are in no way dependent upon any boundary
lines which we may superpose upon the communicational
map. It is not communicationally meaningful to ask whether
the blind man's stick or the scientist's microscope are "parts"
?f the man who uses them. Both stick and microscope are
lIDportant pathways of communication and, as such, are parts
~f the network in which we are interested; but no boundary
line--e.g., halfway up thestick-ean be relevant in a
description of the topology of this net.
o
~~wever, this disc,arding of the boundary of the physical
mdiVldual does not lIDply (as some might fear) that com-
municational discourse is necessarily chaotic. On the con-
trary, the proposed hierarchic classification of learning and/

double-bind hypothesis.
Man must be the
sort of animal whose

;1
he could not become schizophrenic under the frustrations
Ci
of the double bind.
On the evidential side, there is beginning to be a body of
experiment demonstrating the reality of third-order learn-
ing2; but on the precise point of discontinuity between these
orders of learning there is, so far as I know, very little
evidence. The experiments of John Stroud are worth quot-
ing. These were tracking experiments. The subject is faced
with a screen on which a spot moves to represent a moving
target. A second spot, representing the aim of a gun, can be
controlled by the subject, who operates a pair of knobs. The
subject is challenged to maintain coincidence between the
target spot and the spot over which he has control. In such
an experiment the target can be given various sorts of mo-
tion, characterized by second-, third-, or higher-order deriva-
tives. Stroud showed that, as there is a discontinuity in
the orders of the equations which a mathematician might
use to describe the movements of the target spot, so also
there is a discontinuity in the learning of the experimental
subject. It is as if a new learning process were involved
with each step to a higher order of complexity in the move-
ment of the target.
It is to me fascinating to find that what one had supposed
was a pure artifact of mathematical description is also ap-
parently an inbuilt characteristic of the human brain, in spite
of the fact that ,this brain certainly does not operate by
means of mathematical equations in such a task.
There is also evidence of a more general nature which
would support the notion of discontinuity between the orders
of learning. There is, for example, the curious fact that
psychologists have not habitually regarded what I call learn-

253
ing of the first order, the receipt of a meaningful signal, as
learning at all; and the other curious fact, that psychologiSts
have until recently shown very little appreciation of that
third order of learning, in which the psychiatrist is predomi-
nantly interested. There is a formidable gulf between the
thinking of the experimental psychologist and the thinking
of the psychiatrist or anthropologist. This gulf I believe to
be due to the discontinuity in the hieraJ;"chic structure.
Learning, G~netics, and Evolution
Before we consider the impact of the double bind hypoth-
esis upon genetics and evolutionary theory, it is necessary to
examine the relationship between theories of learning and
these two other bodies of knowledge. I referred earlier to
the three subjects together as a triad. The structure of this
triad we must now consider.
Genetics, which covers the communicational phenomena
of variation, differentiation, growth, and heredity, is com-
monly recognized as the very stuff of which evolutionary
theory is made. The Darwinian theory, when -purged of
Lamarckian ideas, consisted of a genetics in which varia-
tion was presumed to be random, combined with a theory
of natural selection·would impart adaptive direction to the
accumulation of changes. But the relation between learn-
ing and this theory has been a matter of violent contro-
versy which has raged over the so-called "inheritance of
acquired characteristics."
Darwin's position was acutely challenged by Samuel But-
ler, who argued that heredity shou,ld be compared with-
even identified with-memory. Butler proceeded from this
premise to argue that the processes of evolutionary change,
and
especially
adaptation,
should, be
regarded
as
the
achievements of a deep cunning in the ongoing How of life,
not as fortuitous bonuses conferred by luck. He drew a close
analogy between the phenomena of invention and the phe-
nomena of evolutionary adaptation, and was perhaps the first
to point out the existence of residual organs in machines.
The curious homology whereby the engine is located in the
front of an automobile, where the horse used to be, would
have delighted him. He also argued very _cogently that there

254
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
is a process whereby the newer inventions of adaptive be-
havior are sunk deeper into the biological system of the
organism. From planned and conscious actions they become
habits, and the habits become less and less conscious and
less and less subject to voluntary control. He assumed, with-
out evidence, that this habitualization, or sinking process,
could go so deep as to contribute to the body of memories,
which we would call the genotype, and which determine
the characteristics of the next generation.
The controversy about the inheritance of acquired char-
acteristics has two facets. On the one hand, it appears to be
an argument which could be settled by factual material.
One good case of such inheritance might settle the matter
for the Lamarckian side. But the case against such inheri-
tance, being negative, can never be proved by evidence and
must rely upon an appeal to theory. Usually those who take
the negative view argue from the separation between· germ
plasm and somatic tissue, urging that there can be no syste-
matic communication from the soma to the germ plasm in
the light of which the genotype might revise itself.
The difficulty looks like this: conceivably a biceps muscle
modified by use or disuse might secrete specific metabolites
into the circulation, and these might conceivably serve as
chemical messengers from muscle to gonad. But (a) it is
difficult to believe that the chemistry of biceps is so dif-
ferent from that of, say, triceps that the message could be
specific, and (b ) it is difficult to believe that the gonad
tissue could be equipped to be appropriately affected by
such messages. After all, the receiver of any message must
know the code of the sender, so that if the gemf cells are
able to receive the messages from the somatic tissue, they
must already be carrying some version of the somatic code.
The directions which evolutionary change could take with
the aid of such messages from the soma would have to be
prefigured in the germ plasm.
The case against the inheritance of acquired character-
istics thus rests upon a separation, and the difference be-
tween the schools of thought crystallizes around philosophic
reactions to such a separation. Those who are willing to
think of the world as organized upon multiple and separable
principles will accept the notion that somatic changes in-
duced by environment may be covered by an explanation
Steps to an Ecology of. Mind
255
which could be totally separate from the explanation of
evolutionary change. But those who prefer to see a unity in
nature will hope that these two bodies of explanation can
somehow be interrelated.
Moreover, the whole relationship between learning and
evolution has undergone a curious change since the days
when Butler maintained that evolution was a matter of cun-
ning rather than luck, and the change which has taken place
is certainly one which neither Darwin nor Butler could have
foreseen. What has happened is that many theorists now
assume learning to be fundamentally a stochastic or proba-
bilistic
affair,
and
indeed,
apart from. nonparsimonious
theories
which .would
postulate liome
entelechy
at
the
console of the mind, the stochastic approach is perhaps
the only organized theory of the nature of learning. The
notion is that random changes occur, in the brain or else-
where, and that the results of such random change are
selected for survival by processes of reinforcement and ex-
tinction. In basic theory, creative thought has come to re-
semble the evolutionary process in its fundamentally stochas-
tic nature. Reinforcement is seen as giving direction to
the accumulation of random changes of the neural system,
just as natural selection is seen as giving direction to the
accumulation of random changes of variation.
In both the theory of evolution and the theory of learn-
ing, however, the word "random" is conspicuously unde-
fined, and the word is not an easy one to define. In both
fields, it is assumed that while change may be dependent
upon probabilistic phenomena, the probability of a given
change is determined by something different from probabil-
ity. Underlying both the stochastic theory of evolution and
that of learning, there are unstated theories regarding the
determinants of the probabilities in question.8 If, however,
we ask about change in these determinants, we shall again
be given stochastic answers, so that the word "random," up-
on which all of these explanations turn, appears to be a
word whose meaning is hierarchically structured, like the
meaning of the word "learning," which was discussed in
the first part of this lecture.
•In this sense, of course, all the theories of change as-
sume that the next change is in some degree prefigured
in the system which is to undergo that change.

Lastly, the question of the evolutionary function. of ac;-
quired characteristics has been reopened by Waddington.s
work on phenocopies in Drosophila. At the very least, thIS
work indicates that the changes of phenotype which can be
achieved by the organism under environmental stress are
a very important part of the machinery by which the species
or hereditary line maintains its place in a stressful and com-
petitive environment, pending the later appearance of some
mutation or other genetic change which may make the
species or line better able to deal with the ongoing. stress.
In this sense at least, the acquired characteristics have ~­
portant evolutionary function. However, the. actual. expen-
mental story indicates something more than thIS and IS worth
reproducing briefly.
What Waddington works with is a phenocopy of the
phenotype brought about by the gene bithorax. This gene
has very profound effects upon the adult J?henotype. In its
presence the third segment of the thorax IS modified to re-
semble the second,
and the little balancing organs,
~r
halteres on this third segment become wings. The result IS
a
four-~nged fly. This four-winged characteristic ~n be
produced artificially in Hies which 'do
n~t ca~ th~
g~ne
bithorax by subjecting the pupae to a ~enod of mtoxlCa~on
with ethyl ether. Waddington works With large populations
of Drosophila Hies derived from a wild strain believed to b.e
free of the gene bithorax. He subjects the pupae of this
population in successive generations to the ether treatment,
and from the resulting adults selects for breeding those
which show the best approximation to bithorax. He has con-
tinued this experiment over many generations, and already
in the twenty-seventh generation he finds that the bithorax
appearance is achieved by a limited number of Hies whose
pupae were withdrawn from the experimental treatment and .
not subjected to ether. Upon breeding from these, it turns
out that their bithorax appear.ance is not due to the presence
of the specific 'gene, bithorax, but is due to a constellation
of genes which work together to give this effe~t.
.
These very striking results can be read m ;anous w~ys.
We can say that in selecting the best pheno~p~es, Waddi.ng-
ton was in fact selecting for a genetic potentiality for achIev-
ing this phenotype. Or we can say that he was selecting to
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
257
reduce the threshold of ether stress necessary to produce
this result.
Let me suggest a possible model for the deScription of
these phenomena. Let us suppose that the acquired char-
acteristic is achieved by some process of fundamentally
stochastic nature--perhaps some sort of somatic learning-
and the mere fact that Waddington is able to select the
"best" phenocopies would lend suppOli to this assumption.
Now, it is evident that any such process is, in the nature of
the case, wasteful. To achieve a result by trial and error
which could have been achieved in any more direct way
necessarily consumes time and effort in some sense of these
words. Insofar as we think of adaptability as achieved by
stochastic process, we let in the notion of an economics of
adaptability.
.
In the field of mental process, we are very familiar with
this sort of economics, and in fact a major and necessary
saving is achieved by the familiar process of habit formation.
We may, in the first instance, solve a given problem by
trial and error; but when similar problems recur later, we
tend to deal with them more and more economically by
taking them out of the rllnge of stochastic operation and
handing over the solutions to a deeper and less flexible
mechanism, which we call "habit." It is, therefore, perfectly
conceivable that !iome analogous 'phenomenon may obtain
in regard to the production of bithorax characteristics. It
may be more economical to produce these by the rigid
mechanism of genetic determination rather than by the more
wasteful, more flexible (and perhaps less predictable) meth-
od of somatic change.
This would mean that in Waddington's population of Hies
there would be a selective benefit for any hereditary line of
Hies which might contain appropriate genes for the whole--
or for some part-of the bithorax phenotype. It is also pos-
sible that such Hies would have an extra advantage in that
their somatic adaptive machinery might then be available
for dealing with stresses of other kinds. It would appear that
in learning, when the solution of the given problem has been
passed on to habit, the stochastic or exploratory mechanisms
are set free for the solution of other problems, and it is
quite conceivable that a similar advantage is achieved by

259
pitalized members carry a gene for schizophrenia and that
the others do not. Rather, we have to expect that several
genes or constellations of genes will alter patterns and po-
tentialities in the learning process, and that certain of the
resultant patterns, when confronted by appropriate fonns of
environmental stress, will lead to overt schizophrenia.
In the most general tenns, any learning, be it the ab-
sorption of one bit of infonnation or a basic change in the
character structure of the whole organism, is, from the point
of view of genetics, the acquisition of an "acquired char-
acteristic:' It is a change in the phenotype, of which that
phenotype was capable thanks to a whole chain of phys-
iologic and embryologic processes which lead back to the
genotype. Every step in this backward leading series may
(conceivably) be modified or interrupted by environmental
impacts; but, of course, many of the steps will be rigid in the
sense that environmental impact at that point would destroy
the organism. We are concerned only with those points in
the hierarchy at which environment ca,n take eHect and the
organism still be viable. How many such points there may
be we are far from knowing. And ultimately, when we reach
the genotype, we are concerned
to know whether the
genotypic elements in which we are interested are or are not
variable. Do differences occur from genotype to genotype
which will aHect the modifiability of the processes leading
to the phenotypic behaviors which we observe?
In the case of schizophrenia we deal evidently with a
relatively long and complex hierarchy; and the natural his-
tory of the disease indicates that the hierarchy is not merely
a chain of causes and eHects from gene-script to phenotype,
",:hich chain becomes at certain points conditional upon en-
vrronme?tal factors. Rather, it seems that in schizophrenia
the envrromental factors themselves are likely to be modi-
fied by the subject's behavior whenever behavior related to
schizophrenia starts to appear.
To illustrate these complexities, it is perhaps worthwhile to
consider for a moment the genetic problems presented by
other fonns of communicational behavior-humor, mathemat-
ical skill, or plUsical composition. Perhaps in all these cases,
. there are considerable genetic diHerences between individ-
uals in those factors which make for an ability to acquire the
appropriate skills. But the skills themselves and their par-
Genetic Problems Posed by Double Bind Theory
If schizophrenia be a modification or distortion of the
learning process, then when we ask about the genetics of
schizophrenia, we cannot be content just with genealogies
upon which we discriminate some individuals who have been
committed to hospitals, and others who have not. There is
no a priori expectation that these distortions of the learning
process, which are highly fonnal and abstract in their nature,
will necessarily appear with that appropriate content which
would result in hospital commitment. Our task as geneticists
will not be the simple one upon which the Mendelians con-
centrated, assuming a one-to-one relation between pheno-
type and genotype. We cannot simply assume that the hos-
~
'These considerations alter somewhat the old problem
of the evolutionary effect of use and disuse. Orthodox
theory could only suggest that a mutation reducing the
(potential) size of a disused organ had survival value
in terms of the resulting economy of tissue. The present
theory would suggest that atrophy of an organ, occurring
at the somatic level, may constitute a drain upon the
total available adaptability of the organism, and that
this waste of adaptability might be saved if reduction of
the organ could be achieved more directly by genetic
determinants.
258

passing on the business of detennining a somatic character-
istic to the gene-script.4
It may be noted that such a model would be char-
acterized by two stochastic mechanisms: first, the more su-
perficial mechanism by which the changes are achieved at
the somatic level, and, second, the stochastic mechanism of
mutation
(or the shuffiing of gene constellations)
at the
chromosomal level. These two stochastic systems will, in the
long run under selective conditions, be compelled to work
together, even though no message can pass from the more
superficial somatic system to the genn plasm. Samuel But-
ler's hunch that so~ething like "habit" might be crucial in
evolution was perhaps not too wide of the mark.
With this introduction we can now proceed to look at the
problems which a double bind theory of schizophrenia would
pose for the geneticist.

::,~ exp,~~:ep~,:::.:;~w~ ::en_=~wr
circumstances and even upon specific training. In additiOn; i
however, to these two components of the situation, there is
I
the fact that the individual who shows ability, e.g., in mu-
;
sical composition, is likely to mold his environment in a
direction which will favor his developing his ability, and
that he will, in turn, create an environment for others which
will favor their development in the same direction.
In the case of humor, the situation may even be one de-
gree more complicated. It is not olear that in this case the
relationship between humorist and his human environment
will necessarily be symmetrical. Granted that in some' cases
the humorist promotes humor in others, in many other oases
there occurs the well-known complementary relationship be-
tween humorist and "straight" man. Indeed, the humorist,
insofar as he hogs the center of the stage, may reduce others
to the position of receiving humor but not themselves con-
tributing.
These considerations can be applied unchanged to the
problem of schizophrenia.
Anybody watching the trans-
actions which occur between the members of a family con-
taining an identified schizophrenic will perceive immediate-
ly that the symptomatic behavior of the identified patient
fits with this environment and, indeed, promotes in the other
members those characteristics which evoke the schizophrenio
behavior. Thus, in addition to the two stochastic mechanisms
outlined in the previous section, we now face a third, name-
ly the mechanism of those changes whereby the family,
perhaps gradually, becomes organized (i.e., limits the be-
haviors of the component individuals) in such a way as to fit
the schizophrenia.
A question which is frequently asked is this: "H this fam-
ily is schizophrenogenic; how does it happen that alI of the
siblings are not diagnosable as·schizophrenic patients?" Here
it is necessary to insist that the family, like any other or-
ganization, creates and depends upon differentiation among
its members. As in many organizations, there is room only
for one boss, in spite of the fact that the organization
operates upon those premises which would induce adminis-
trative skill and ambition in its members; so also in' the
schizophrenogenic family there may be room for only one
schizophrenic. The case of the humorist is quite compa-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
261
rable. The organization of the Marx family, which could create
four professional humorists, must have been quite
excep~
tionaI. More usually one such individual would suffice to re-
duce the others to more commonplace behavioral roles. Gene-
tics may play a role in deciding which of several siblings
shall be the schizophrenic-or which shall be the clown-
but it is by nO means clear that such hereditary factors
could completely determine the evolution or roles within
the family organization.
A second· question-to which we have no final answer-
concerns the degree of schizophrenia (genetic andlor
a~
quired) which must be assigned to the schizophrenogenic
parent. Let me, for purposes of the present inquiry, define
two degrees of schizophrenic symptomatology, and note that
the so-called "psychotic break" sometimes divides these two
degrees.
The more serious and conspicuous degree of symptoma-
tology is what is conventionally called schizophrenia. I will
call it "overt schizophrenia."
The persons so affiicted be-
have in ways which are grossly deviant from the cultural
environment. In particular, their behavior seems character-
ized by conspicuous or exaggerated errors and distortions
regarding the nature and typing of their own messages (in-
ternal and external), and of the messages which they re-
ceive from others. Imagination is seemingly confused with
perception. The literal is confused with the metaphoric.
Internal messages are confused with external. The trivial is
confused with the vital. The originator of the message is
confused with the recipient and the perceiver· with the thing
perceived. And so on. In general, these distortions boil down
to this: that the patient behaves in such a way that he shall
be responSible for no metacommunicative aspect of his mes-
sages. He does this, moreover, in a manner which makes his
condition conspicuous: in some cases, flooding the environ-
ment with messages whose logical typing is .either totally
obscure or misleading; in other cases, overtly withdrawing
to such a point that he commits himself to no overt message.
In the "covert" case the behavior of the identified patient
is Similarly but less conspicuously characterized by a con-
tinual changing of the logical typing of his or her messages,
and a tendency to respond to the messages of others (es-
pecially to those of other family members) as though these

262
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
were of logical type, different from that which the speaker
intended. In this system of behavior the messages of the
vis-a-vis are continually disqualified, either by indicating that
they are inappropriate replies to what the covert schizo-
phrenic has said or by indicating that they are the product of
some fault in the .character or motivation of the speaker.
Moreover, this destructive behavior is in general maintained
in such a way as to be undetected. So long as the covert
schizophrenic can succeed in putting the other in the wrong,
his or her pathology is obscured and the blame falls .,else-
where. There is some evidence that these persons few: col-
lapse into overt schizophrenia when faced by circumstances
which would force them to recognize the pattern of their
operations. They will even use the threat, "You are driving
me crazy," as a defense of their position.
What I am here calling covert schizophrenia is character-
istic of the parents of schizophrenics in the families which
we have studied. This behavior, when it occurs in the
mother, has been extensively caricatured; so I shall use here
an example of which the central figure is the father. Mr.
and Mrs. P. had been married some eighteen years and have
a near-hebephrenic son of sixteen. Their marriage is difficult
and is characterized by almost continual hostility. However,
she is a keen gardener, and on a certain Sunday afternoon
they worked together planting rQses in what was to be her
rose garden. She recalls that this was an unusually pleasant
occasion. On Monday moming, the husband went to work as
usual, and while he was gone Mrs. P. received a phone call
from a complete stranger inquiring, rather apologetically,
when Mrs. P. was going to leave .the house. This came as
somewhat of a surprise. She did not know that from her hus-
band's point of view the messages of shared work on the
rose garden.were framed within the larger context of his
having agreed during the previous week to sell the house.
In some cases, it almost looks as though the overt schizo-
phrenic were a caricature of the covert.
If we assume that both the grossly schizophrenic symp-
toms of the identified patient and the "covert schizophrenia"
of the parents are in part determined by genetic factors,
i.e., that, given the appropriate experiential setting, genetics
in some degree renders the patient more liable to develop
these particular patterns of behavior, then we have to ask
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
263
how these two degrees of pathology might be related in a
genetic theory.
.
.
.
Certainly, no answer to this question IS at present
aV~ll­
able
but it is clearly pOSSible we here face two qUIte
disfuct problems. In the case of the overt schizophrenic, the
geneticist will have to identify those formal characteristics
of the patient which will render him more likely to be driven
to a psychotic break by the covertly inconsistent behavior of
his parents (or by this in conjunction and contrast with the
more consistent behavior of people outside the family). It is
too early· to make a specific guess at these characteristics,
but we may reasonably assume that they would include
some sort of rigidity. Perhaps the person prone to overt
schizophrenia would be characterized by some extra strength
of psychological commitment to the status quo as he at the
moment sees it, which commitment would be hurt or frus-
trated by the parents' rapid shifts of frame and context. Or
perhaps this patient might be characterized by the high
value of some parameter determining the relationship be-
tween problem solving and habit formation. Perhaps it is
the person who too readily hands over the solutions to habit
who is hurt by those changes in context which invalidate his
solutions just at the moment when he has incorporated them
into his habit structure.
In the case of covert schizophrenia, the problem for the
geneticist will be different. He will have to identify those
formal characteristics which we observe in the parents of
the schizophrenic. Here what is required would seem to be
a flexibility rather than a rigidity. But, having had some ex-
perience in dealing with these people, I must coqfess to
feeling that they are rigidly committed to their patterns of
inconsistency.
Whether the two questions which the geneticist must an-
swer can Simply be lumped together by regarding the covert
patterns as merely a milder version of the overt, or can be
brought under a single head by suggesting that in some
sense the same rigidity operates at different levels in the two
cases, I do not know.
Be that as it may, the difficulties which we here face are
entirely characteristic of any attempt to find a genetic base
for any behavioral characteristic. Notoriously, the sign of any
message or behavior is subject to reversal, and this generali-

264
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
zation is one of the most important contributions of psycho-
analysis, to our thinking. If we find that a sexual exhibitionist
is the child of a prudish parent, are we justified in going to
the geneticist to ask him to trace out the genetics of some
i
basic characteristic which will find its phenotypic expression
both in the prudishness of the parent and in the exhibi-
tionism of the offspring? The phenomena of suppression and
overcompensation lead continually to the difficulty that an
1
excess of something at one level (e.g., in the genotype)
..
may lead to a deficiency of the direct expression of ,that
something at some more superficial level
(e.g,.
in" the
phenotype). And conversely.
'
Weare very far, then, from being able to pose specific
questions for the geneticist; but I believe that the wider
implications of what I have been saying modify ,somewhat
the philosophy of genetics. Our approach to the problems of
schizophrenia by way of a theory '"Of levels or logical types
has disclosed first that the problems of adaptation and learn-
ing and their pathologies must be considered in tenns of a
hierarchic system in which stochastic change occurs at the
boundary points between the segments of the hierarchy.
We have considered three such regions of stochastic change
-the level of genetic mutation, the level of learning, and
the level of change in family organization. We have dis-
closed the poSSibility of a relationship of these levels which
orthodox genetics would deny, and we have disclosed that
at least in human societies the evolutionary system consists
not merely in the selective survival of those persons who
happen to select appropriate environments but also in the
modifi~tion of family environment in a direction· which
might enhance the phenotypic and gynotypic characteristics
of the individual members.
What Is Man?
If I had been asked fifteen years ago what I understood
1
by the word materialism, I think I should have'said that
materialism is a theory about the nature of the universe, and
I would have accepted as a' matter of course the notion
that this theory is in some sense nonmoral. I would have
agreed that the scientist is an expert who can provide him-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
265
self and
others
with
inSights
and
techniques,
but
that
science could have nothing to say about whether these tech-
niques should be used. In this, I would have been following
the general trend of scientific philosophy associated with
such names at Democritus, Galileo, Newton,!! Lavoisier, and
Darwin. I would have been discarding the less respectable
views of such men as Heraclitus, the alchemists, William
Blake, Lamarck, and Samuel Butler. For these, the motive
for scientific inquiry was the desire to build a comprehensive
view of the universe which should show what Man is and
how he is related to the rest of the universe. The picture
which these men were trying to build was ethical and
aesthetic.
There is this much connection certainly between scientific
truth, on the one hand, and beauty and morality, on the
other: that if a man entertain false opinions regarding his
own nature, he will be led thereby to courses of action which
will be in some profound sense immoral or ugly.
Today, if asked the same question regarding the meaning
of materialism, I would say that this word stands in my
thinking for a collection of rules about what questions should
be asked regarding the nature of the universe. But I would
not suppose that this set of rules has any claim to be unique-
ly right.
The mystic "sees the world in a grain of sand," and the
world which he sees is either moral or aesthetic, or both.
The Newtonian' scientist sees a regularity in the behavior of
falling bodies and claims to draw from this regularity no
nonnative conclusions whatsoever. But his claim ceases to be
consistent at the moment when he preaches that this is the
right way to view the universe. To preach is possible only in
tenns of nonnative conclusions.
I have touched upon several matters in the course of this
Ffhe name of Newton certainly belongs in this list. But
the man himself was of a different kidney. His mystical
p~eoccupation with alchemy and apocalyptic writings, and
hIS secret theological monism indicate that he was not
the first objective scientist but, rather the "last of the
magicians" (see J. M. Keynes,
"Ne~on
the Man"
Tercentenary Celebrations,
London,
Ca~bridge
Ur:i-
versity Press, 1947, pp. 27-34). Newton and Blake were
alike in devoting much time aild thought to the mystical
works of Jacob Boehme.

lecture which have been foci of controversy in the long bat-
tle between a nonmoral materialism and a more romantic
view of the universe. The battle between Darwin and Sam-
uel Butler may have owed some of its bitterness to what
looked like personal affronts, but behind all this the
argu~
ment concerned a question which had religious status. The
battle ,,:as really about "vitalism." It was a question of how
.much life and what order of life could be asSigned to
organisms; and Darwin's victory amounted to this, that while
~e
~ad not
suce:e~e? in detracting from the mystedous
liveliness of the mdiVldual organism, he had at least dem-
onstrated that the evolutionary picture could be reduced to
natural "law."
.
It was, therefore, very important to demonstrate that the
as yet unconquered tenitory-the life of the individual or-
ga:usm-c?uld not ~ntain anything which would recapture
thIS e;olutionary te~tory. It was still mysterious that living
o~g~ms. could achieve adaptive change during their in-,
diVldual lives, and at all costs these adaptive changes, the
famous acquired characteristics, must not have influence up-
on the evolutionary tree. The "inheritance of acquired char-
acteristics" threatened always to recapture the field of evo-
lution for the vitalist side. One part of biology must be
separate from the other. The objective scientists claimed, of
course, to believe in a unity in nature-that ultimately the
wh?le of
n~tural phenomena would prove susceptible to
therr analYSIS, but for about a hundred years it was con-
venient to set up an impermeable screen between the bi-
ology of the individual and the theory of evolution. Samuel
Butler's "inherited memory" was an attack upon this s~een.
The question with which I -am concerned in this conclud-
ing section of the lecture could be put in various ways. Is
the battle between nonmoral materialism and the more
mystical view of the universe affected by a change in the
function assigned to the "acquired characteristics?" Does the
older materialist thesis really depend upon the premise that
contexts are isolable? Or is our view of the world changed
when we admit an infinite regress of contexts, linked to each
o~e~ in a complex network of metarelations? Does the pos-
SIbIlity that the separate levels of stochastic change
(in
phenotype and genotype) may be connected in the' larger
.1
I
·1

267
context of the ecological system alter our allegiance in the
battle? '
In breaking away from the premise that contexts are al-
ways conceptually isolable, I have let in the notion of a
universe much more unified-and in that sense much more
mystical-than the conventional universe of nonmoral mate-
rialism. Does the new position so achieved give us new
grounds for hope that science might answer moral or aes-
thetic questions?
I
~rlieve that the position is significantly changed, and
perha,ps I can best make this clear, by considering a matter
which you as psychiatrists have thought about many times.
I mean the matter of "control" and the whole related com-
plex suggested by such words as manipulation, spontaneity,
free will, and technique. I think you will agree with me
that there is no area in which false premises regarding the
nature of the self and its relation to others can be so surely
productive of destruction and ugliness as this area of ideas
about control. A human being in relation with another has
very limited control over what happens in that relationship.
He is a part of a two-person unit, and the control which
any part can have over any whole is strictly limited.
The infinite regress of contexts which I have talked about
is only another example of the same phenomenon. What I
have contributed to this discussion is the notion that the
contrast between part and whole, whenever this contrast ap-
pears in the realm of communication, is Simply a contrast in
logical typing. The whole is always in a metarelationship
with its parts. As in lOgiC the proposition can never determine
the meta proposition, so also in matters of control the small-
er context can never determine the larger. I have remarked
(e.g.; when discussing the phenomena of phenotypic com-
pensation) that in hierarchies of logical typing there is often
some sort of change of sign at each level, when the levels
are related to each other in such a way as to create a seIf-
corrective system. This appears in a simple diagrammatic
form in the initiatory hierarchy which I studied in a New
Guinea tribe. The initiators are the natural enemies of the
novices, because it is their task to bully the novices into
shape. The men who initiated the present initiators now have
a role of criticizing what is now being done in the initia-
tion ceremonies, and this makes them the natural allies of

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
269
Let me then conclude with a warning that we social
scientists would do well to hold back our eagerness to control
that world which we so imperfectly understand. The fact
of our imperfect understanding should not be allowed to
feed our anxiety and so increase the need to control. Rather,
our studies could be inspired by a more ancient, but today
less honored, motive: a curiosity about the world of which
we are part. The rewards of such work are not power but
beauty.
I~, is a strange fact that every great scientific advance-
not aeast the advances which Newton achieved-has been
elegant.

This gives us a view of the world which is still almost

functioning of such hierarchies may be compared with the

trailers are attached. Each segmentation of such a system
denotes a reversal of sign, and each added segment climotes
a drastic decreaSe in the amount of control that can be

to the right-hand side of the road, and he wants the trailer
immediately behind him to approach the right-hand side, he
must turn his front wheels to the left. This will guide the

right. And so on.

of available control falls off rapidly. To back a truck with
one trailer is already difficult because there is only a limited
range of angles within which the control can be exerted. If
the trailer is in line, or almost in line, with the truck, the
control is easy, but as the angle between trailer and truck I
diminishes, a point is reached at which control is lost and the
I
attempt to exert it only results in jackknifing of the system. I
When we consider the problem of controlling a second
trailer, the threshold for jackknifing is drasticaIIy reduced,
I
and control becomes, therefore, ahnost negligible.

As I see it, the world is made up of a very complex net- I
work (rather than a chain) of entities which have this sort
of relationship to each other, but with this difference, that

Double Bind, 1969*
Double bind theory was, for me, an exemplification of how
to think about such matters and, in this aspect at least, the
whole business is worth some re-examination.
Sometimes-often in science and always
< in art-one does
not know what the problems were till after they have been
solved. So perhaps it will be useful to state retrospectively
what problems were solved for me by double bind theory.
First there was the problem of remcation.
Clearly there are in the mind no objects or events-no
pigs, no coconut palms, and no mothers. The mind contains
only transforms, percepts, images, etc., and rules for making
these transforms, perc,epts, etc. In what form these rules exist
we do not know, but presumably they are embodied in the
very machinery which creates the transforms. The rules are
certainly not commonly explicit as conscious "thoughts."
In any case, it is nonsense to say that a man was frightened
by a lion, because a lion is not an idea. The man makes an
idea of the-lion.
The explanatory world of substance can invoke no dif-
ferences and no ideas but only forces and impacts. And,
per contra, the world of f~ and communication invokes no
things, forces, or impacts but only differences and ideas. (A
*This paper was given in August, 1969, at a Symposi-
um on the Double Bind; Chairman, Dr. Robert Ryder;
sponsored by the American Psychological Association. It
was prepared under Career Development Award (MH-
21,931) of the National Institute of Mental Health.

difference which makes a difference is an idea. It is a "bit,"
a unit bf information.)
l
But thest' things I learned only later-was enabled to'.....•:
learn them by double bind theory. And yet, of course, they
..,.
are implicit in the theory which could hardly have been
created without them.
I
Our original paper on the double bind contains numerous
I
errors due simply to our having not yet articulately examined
'
the reification problem. We talk in that paper as though a
-Ii
double bind were a something and as thoughsucli some-
things could be counted.
I~
Of course that's lill nonsense. You cannot count the bats in
an inkblot because there are none. And yet a man-if he be
''bat-minded''-may "see" several.
But are there double binds in the mind? The question is
not trivial. As there are in the mind no coconuts but only
percepts and transforms of coconuts, so also, when I perceive
(consciously or unconsciously) a double bind in my
bos~'
behavior, I acquire in my mind no double bind but only a
percept or transform of a double bind. And that is not
what the theory is about.
We are talking then about some sort of tangle in the rules
for making the transforms and about the acquisition or culti-
vation of such tangles. Double bind theory asserts that there
is an experiential component in the determination or etiology
of schizophrenic symptoms and related behavioral patterns,
such as humor, art, poetry, etc. Notably the theory does not
distinguish between these subspecies. Within its terms there
is nothing to determine whether a given individual shall
become a clown, a poet, a schizophrenic, or some' combina-
tion of these. We deal not with a single syndrome but with
a genus of syndromes, most of which are riot conventionally
regarded as pathological.
Let m~ coin the word "transconte?Ctual" as a general term
for this genus of syndromes.
. .
It seems that both those whose life is enriched by trans-
contextual gifts and those who are impoverished by transcon-
textual confusions are alike in one respect: for them there is
always or often a "double take." A falling leaf, the greeting of
a friend, or a "primrose by the river's brim" is not "just that
and nothing more." Exogenous experience may be framed in
the contexts of dream, and internal thought may be projected
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
273
into the contexts of the external world. And so on. For all
this, we seek a partial explanation in learning and experience.
There must, of course, also be genetic components in the
etiology of the transcontextual syndromes. These would ex-
pectably operate at levels more abstract than the e?'Per-
iential. For example, genetic components might determine
skill in learning to be transcontextual or (more abstractly)
the potentialities for acquiring this skill. Or, conversely, the
genome might determine skills in resisting transcontextual
patl:\ways, or the potentiality for acquiring this latter skill.
(Geneticists have paid very little attention to the necessity
of defining the logical typing of messages carried by DNA.)
In any case, the meeting point where the genetic deter-
mination meets the e?'Periential is surely quite abstract, and
this must be true even though the embodiment of the
genetic message be a Single gene. (A single bit of informa-
tion-a single difference--may be the yes-or-no answer to a
question of any degree of complexity, at any level of ab-
straction. )
Current theories which propose (for "schizophrenia") a
single dominant gene of "low penetrance" seem to leave the
field open for any e?Cperiential theory which would indicate
what class of experiences might cause the latent potentiality
to appear in the phenotype.
I must confess however that these theories seem to me of
little interest until the proponents try to specify what com-
P?~:mts of ~e complex process of determining "schizophre-
ma are prOVIded by the hypothetical gene. To identify these
components must be a subtractive process. Where the con-
tribution of environment is large, the genetics cannot be in-
vestigated until the environmental effect has been identified
and can be controlled.
. But sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander, and
what is said above about geneticists places an obligation
upon me to make clear whatcomponeIits of transcontextual
process could be provided by double bind experience. It is
appropriate therefore to re-examine the theory of deutero-
learning upon which double bind theory is based.
All biological systems (organisms and social or ecological
organizations of organisms) are capable of adaptive change.
But adaptive change takes many forms, such as response,

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
275
repetitive truth, and these are commonly of a relatively high
order of abstraction.!
Now the particular propositions which I believe to be im-
portant in the deteImination of the transcontextual syndromes
are those formal abstractions which describe and determine
interpersonal relationship.
I say "describe and determine," but even this is inade-
quate. Better would be to say that the relationship is the
exchange of these messages; or that the relationship is im-
_manent in these messages.
Psychologists commonly speak as if the abstractions of re-
lationship ("dependency," "hostility," "love," etc.) were real
things which are to be described or "expressed" by messages.
This is epistemology backwards: in truth, the messages con-
stitute the relationship, .and words like "dependency" are
verbally coded descriptions of patterns inlmanent in the
combination of exchanged messages.
As has already been mentioned, there are no "things" in
the mind-not even "dependency,"
We are so befuddled by language that we cannot think
straight, and it is convenient, sometimes, to remember that
we are really mammals. The epistemology of the ''heart'' is
that of any nonhuman mammal. The cat does not say
"milk"; she simply acts out (or is) her end of an interchange,
the pattern of which we in language would call "depen-
dency,"
But to act or be one end of a pattern of interaction is to
propose the other end. A context is set for a certain class of
response.,
This.weaving of contexts and of messages which propose

all messages
whatsoever,

1 What is important, however, is that the proposition be
constantly true, rather than that it be abstract. It just so
happens-coincidentally-that abstractions, if well cho-
sen, have a constancy of truth. For human beings it is
rather constantly true that air is present around the nose;
the reflexes which control respiration can therefore be
hard-programmed in the medulla. For the porpoise, the
proposition "air around the blowhole" is only inter-
mittently true, and therefore respiration must be con-
trolled in a more flexible manner from some higher
center.

learning, ecological succession, biological evolution, cultural
evolution, etc., according to the size. and complexity of the
system which we choose to consider.
Whatever the system,
adaptive change depends
upon
feedback loops, be it those provided by natural selection or
those of individual reinforcement. In all cases, then, there
mus~ be a process of trial and error and a mechanism of
comparison.
But trial and error must always involve error, and error is
always biologically and/or psychically expensive. It follows
therefore that adaptive change must always be hierarchic.'{
There is needed not only that first-order change which
suits the immediate environmental (or physiological) demand
but also second-order changes which will reduce the amount
of trial and error needed to achieve the first-order change.
And
so
on.
By
superposing
and
interconnecting many
feedback loops, we (and all other biological systems) not
only solve particular problems but also form habits which
we apply to the solution of clllsses of problems.
We act as though a whole class of problems could be
solved in terms of assumptions or premises, fewer in number
than the members of the class of problems. In other words,
we (organisms) learn to learn, or in the more technical
phrase, we deutero-learn.
But habits are notoriously rigid and their rigidity follows as
a necessary corollary of their status in the hierarchy of
adaptation. The very economy of trial and error which is
achieved by habit formation is only pOSSible because habits
are comparatively ''hard programmed," in the engineers'
phrase. The economy consists precisely in not re-examining
or rediscovering the premises of habit every time the habit
is used. We may say that these premises are partly "un-
conscious", or-if you please-that a habit of not examining
them is developed.
Moreover, it is important to note that the premises of
habit are almost necessarily abstract. Every problem is in
some degree different from every other and its de~cription or
representation in the mind will therefore contain unique
propositions. Clearly to sink these unique propositions to the
level of premises of habit would be an error. Habit can deal
successfully only with propositions which have general or

"meaning" only by virtue of context-is' the subject matter
of the so-called double bind theory.
The matter may be illustrated by a famous and formally
correct2 botanical analogy. Goethe pointed out 150 .years~j
ago that there is a sort of syntax or grammar in the anatomy
~l
of Howering plants. A "stem" is that which bears "leaves";
,;I
a "leaf" is that which has a bud in its axil; a bud is a stem'
I
which originates in the axil of a leaf; etc. The formal (i.e.,
>-1
the communicational) nature of each organ is determined--I
by its contextual status-the context in which it occurs" and
-..-.-:.•1
the context which it sets for other parts.
:1:
I said above
th~t double bind theory is concerned with
the experiential component in the genesis of tangles in th.e
rules or premises of habit. I now go on to assert that expen-
enced breaches in the weave of contextual structure are in
fact "double binds" and must necessarily (if they conbibute
at all to the hierarchic processes of learning and adaptation)
promote what I am calling transcontextual syndromes.
Consider a very simple paradigm:
a female porpoise
(Steno bredanensis) is trained to accept the sound of the
trainer's whistle as a "secondary reinforcement." The whistle
is expectably followed by food, and if she later repeats what
she was doing when the whistle blew, she will expectably
again hear the whistle and receive food.
This porpoise is now used by the trainers to demonstrate;~.
__-
"operant conditioning" to the public. When she enters the
'fi
exhibition tank, she raises her head above surface, hears the 'tl
whistle and is fed. She then raises her head again and is
again reinforced. Three repetitions of this sequence;: is enough;1
for the demonstration and the porpoise is then sent off."stage i
to wait for the next performance two hours later. She has-~
learned some simple rules which relate her actions, the
whistle, the exhibition tank, and the trainer into a pattern-
a contextual structure, a set of rules for how to put the in-
formation together.
But this pattern is fitted only for a single episode in the
exhibition tank. She must break that pat~rn to deal with the
•Formally correct because morphogenesis, like be-
havior, is surely a matter of messages in contexts. (See
G. Bateson, "A Re-examination of 'Bateson's' Rule,'''
Journal of Genetics, in press.)
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
277
class of such episodes. There is a larger context of contexts
which will put her in the wrong.
At the next performance, the trainer again wants
to
demonstrate "operant conditioning," but to do this she must
pick on a different piece of conspicuous behavior.
When the porpoise comes on stage, she again raises her
head. But she gets no whistle. The trainer waits for the next
piece of conspicuous behavior-likely a tail Hap, which is a
common expression of annoyance. This behavior is then rein-
forced and repeated.
But the tail Hap was, of course, not rewarded in the third
performance.
Finally the porpoise learned to deal with the context of
contexts-by offering a different or new piece of conspic-
uous behavior whenever she came on stage.
All this had happened in the free natural history of the
relationship between porpoise and trainer and audience. The
sequence was then repeated experimentally with a new
porpoise and carefully recorded.8
Two points from this experimental repeat of the sequence
must be added:
First, that it was necessary (in the trainer's judgment) to
break the rules of the experiment many times. The experi-
ence of being in the wrong was so disturbing to the porpoise
that in order to preserve the relationship between porpoise
and trainer (i.e., the context of context of context) it v.:as
necessary to give many reinforcements to which the porpOIse
was not entitled.
Second, that each of the first
fourteen
sessions
was
characterized by many futile repetitions of whatever be-
havior had been reinforced in the immediately previous ses-
sion. Seemingly only by "accident" did the animal provide a
piece of different behavior: In the
time~out between the
fourteenth and fifteenth SeSSIOns, the porpOIse appeared to be
much excited, and when she came on stage for the fifteenth
session she put on an elaborate performance including eight
conspicuous pieces of behavior of which four were entirely
new-never before observed in this species of animal.

All species of behavioral scientists are concerned with
"learning" in one sense or another of that word. Moreover,
since "learning" is a communicational phenomenon, all are
affected by that cybernetic revolution in thought which has
occUrred in the last twenty-five years. This revolution was
triggered by the engineers and communication theorists but
has older roots in the physiological work of Cannon and
Claude Bernard, in the physic1l of Clarke Maxwell, and in the
mathematical philosophy of Russell and Whitehead. Insofar
as behavioral scientists still ignore the problems of Principia
Mathematica,l they can claim approximately sixty years of
obsolescence.
It appears, however, that the barriers of misunderstanding
which divide the various species of behavioral scientists can
be illuminated (but not eliminated) by an application of
Russell's Theory of LOgical Types to the concept of "learning"

The story illustrates, I believe,two aspects of the genesis
of a transcontextual syndrome:
First that severe pain and maladjustment can be induced
by PJItting a mammal in the wrong I:egar~ing i,ts rules for
making sense of an important relatIonship wIth another
mammal.
And second that if this pathology can be warded off or
resisted, the total experience may promote creativity.

volved in generating that paradox is thereby negated and
reduced to nothing. It is as if it had never been. But in the
real world (or at least in our descriptions -of it), there is
always time, and nothing which has been can ever be totally
negated in this way. The computer which encounters a para-
dox (due to faulty programming) does not vanish away.
The "if ... then ..." of logic contains no time. But in the
computer, cause and effect are used to simulate the "if ..•
then . . ." of logic; and all sequences of cause and effect
n~essarily involve time. (Conversely, we may say that in
s<;\entific explanations the "if . . . then •. ." of logic is used
to simulate the "if ... then .• ." of sause and effect.)
The computer never truly encounters logical paradox, but
only the simulation of paradox in trains of cause and effect.
The computer therefore does not fade away. It merely
oscillates.
In fact, there are important differences between the world
of logic and the world of phenomena, and. these differences
must be allowed for whenever we base our arguments upon
the partial but important analogy which exists between them.
It is the thesis of the present essay that this partial
analogy can provide an important guide for behavioral
scientists in their classification of phenomena related to learn-
ing. Precisely in the field of animal and mechanical communi-
cation something like the theory of types must apply.
Questions of this sort, however, are not often discussed
in zoological laboratories, anthropological field camps, or
psychiatric conventions, and it is necessary therefore to
demonstrate that these abstract considerations are important
to behavioral scientists.
Consider the follOwing syllogism:
(a) Changes in frequency of items of mammalian be-
havior can be described and predicted in terms of
various "laws" of reinforcement.
(b) "Exploration" as observed in rats is a category, or
class, of mammalian behavior.
(c) Therefore, changes in frequency of "exploration"
should be describable in terms of the same "laws"
of reinforcement.

The Theory of Logical Types
First, it is appropriate to indicate the subject matter of the
Theory of Logical Types: the theory asserts that no class can,
in formal logical or mathematical discow;se, be a member of
itself; that a class of classes cannot be one of the classes
which are its members; that a name is not the thing narhed;
that "John
Bateson~' is the class of which that boy is the
unique member; and so forth. These assertions may seem
trivial and even obvious, but we shall see later that it is )lot
at all unusual for the theorists of behavioral science to
commit errors which are precisely analogous to the error of
classifying the name with the thing named-or eating the
menu card instead of the dinner-an error of logical typing.
Somewhat less obvious is the further assertion of the
theory: that a class cannot be one of those items which are
correctly classified as its nonmembers. If we classify chairs
together to constitute the class of chairs, we can go on to
note that tables and lamp shades are members of a large
class of "nonchairs," but we shall commit an error in formal
discourse if we count the class of chairs among the items
within the class of nonchairs.
Inasmuch as no class can be a member of itself, the class
of nonchairs clearly cannot be a nonchair. Simple considera-
tions of symmetry may suffice to convince the l}onmathe-
matical reader: (a) that the class of chairs is of the same
order of abstraction (i.e., the same logical type) as the class
of nonchairs; and further, (b) that if the class of chairs is not
a chair, then, correspondingly, the class of nonchairs is not a,
-,j
nonchair.
Lastly, the theory asserts that if these simple rules of
formal discourse are contravened, paradox will be generated
and the discourse vitiated.
The theory, then, deals with highly abstract matters and
was first derived within the abstract world of logic. In that
world, when a train of propositions can be shown to generate
a paradox, the entire structure of axioms, theorems, etc., in-
280

with which all are concerned. To attempt this
will be a purpose of the present essay.

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
Be it said at once: first, that empirical data shOw that the
conclusion (c) is untrue; and second, that if the conclusion
(c) were demonstrably true, then either (a) or (b) would
be untrue.2
Logic and natural history would be better served by an
expanded and corrected version of the conclusion (c) some-
what as follows:
(c) If, as asserted in (b), "exploration" is not an item
of mammalian behavior but is a category of such
items, then no descriptive statement which is true
of items of behavior can be true of "exploratidfi."
If, however, descriptive statements which are true
of items of behavior are also true of "exploration,"
then "exploration" is an item and not a category of
items.
The whole matter turns on whether the distinction be-
tween a class and its members is an ordering principle in the
behavioral phenomena which we study.
In less formal language: you can reinforce a rat (positively
or negatively) when he investigates a particular strange ob-
ject, and he will appropriately learn to approach or avoid it.
But the very purpose of exploration is to get information
about which
objects
should
be
approached
and
which
avoided. The discovery that' a given object is dangerous is
therefore a success in the business of getting information.
The success will not discourage the rat from future explora-
tion of other strange objects.
~
A priori it can be argued that all perception and all re-
sponse, all behavior and all classes of behavior, all learning
and all genetics, all neurophYSiology and endocrinology,--all
organization and all evolution--one entire subject matter-
"it is conceivable that the same words might be used in
describing both a class and its members and be true in
both cases. The word "wave" is the name of a class of
movements of particles. We can also say that the wave
itself "moves," but we shall be referring to a movement
of a class of movements. Under friction, this metamove-
ment will not lose velocity as would the movement of a
particle.

. The word '1earni~g" undol;Ibtedly denotes change of some
kind. To say what kmd of change is a delicate matter.
However, from the gross common denominator, "change,"
we can deduce that our descriptions of "learning" will have
to make the same sort of allowance for the varieties of
logical type which has been routine in phYSical science since
the days of Newton. The Simplest and most familiar form
of c~ange is motion, and even if we work at that very simple
phy'~ICa! .level we must
~tru,<;~e our descriptions in terms
o!
:e~~ltion or zero motion,
constant velocity," "accelera-
tion,
rate of change of acceleration," and so on.S
Change denotes process. But processes are themselves
subject to "change." The process may accelerate
it may
slow down, or it may undergo other types of cha~ge such
that we shall say that it is now a "different" process.
These considerations suggest that we should begin the
ordering of our ideas about "learning" at the very Simplest
level.

Change of acceleration can only happen with deforma-

Incapable of deformatIOn or any other internal change. It
~as therefore not subject to rate of change of accelera-

An examination of this fonnal fiction will contribute to our
definition of zero learning.
(1) The "player" may receive, from the events of the
game, infonnation of higher or lower logical type, and he
may use this infonnation to make decisions of higher or
lower type. That is, his decisions may be either strategic or
tactical, and he can identify and respond to indications of
both the tactics and the strategy of his opponent. It is, how-
ever, true that in Von Neumann's fonnal definition of a
"game," all problems which the game may present are con-
ceiv,ed as computable, i.e., while the game may contain
problems and infonnation of many different logical types,
the hierarchy of these types is strictly finite.
It appears then that a definition of zero learning will not
depend upon the logical typing of the infonnation received
by the organism nor upon the logical typing of the adaptive
decisions which the organism may make. A very high (but
finite)
order of complexity may characterize adaptive be-
havior based on nothing higher than zero learning.
(2) The "player" may compute the value of infonnation
which would benefit him and may compute that it will pay
him to acquire this infqnnation by engaging in "exploratory"
moves. Alternatively, he may make delaying or tentative
moves while he waits for needed infonnation.
It follows that a rat engaging in exploratory behavior
might do so upon a basis of zero learning..
(3) The "player" may compute that it will pay him to
make random moves. In the game of matching pennies, he
will compute that if he selects "heads" or "tails" at random,
he will have an even chance of winning. If he uses any plan
or pattern, this will appear as a pattern or redundancy in the
sequence of his moves and his opponent will thereby re-
ceive infonnation. The "player" will therefore elect to play
.in a random manner.
(4) The "player" is incapable of "error." He may, for
good reason, elect to make random moves or exploratory
moves, but he is by definition incapable of "learning by trial
and error."
If we assume that, in the name of this learning process,
the word "error" means what we meant it to mean when we
said that the "player" is incapable of error, then "trial and
error" is excluded from the repertoire of the Von Neuman-
In ordinary, nontechnical parlance, the word "learn" is
often applied to what is here called "zero learning," i.e., to
the simple receipt of information from an external event, in
such a way that a similar event at a later (and appropriate)
time will convey the same infonnation: I "learn" from the
factory whistle that it is twelve o'clock.
It is also interesting to note that within the frame of our
definition many very simple mechanical devices show at least
the phenomenon of zero learning. The question is not, "Can
machines learn?" but what level or order of learning does a
given machine achieve? It is worth looking at an' extreme, if
hypothetical, case:
The "player" of a Von Neumannian game is a mathemati-
cal fiction, comparable to the Euclidean straight line in ge-
ometry or the Newtonian particle in physics. By definition,
.;
the "player" is capable of all computations necessary to solve
<,
whatever problems the events of the game may present; he
-
is incapable of not performing these computations whenever
they are appropriate; he always obeys the findings of his
computations. Such a "player" receives infonnation from the
events of the game and acts appropriately upon that infor-
mation. But his learning is limited to what is here called
zero learning.

In experimental settings, when "learning" is com-
plete and the animal gives approximately 100 per
cent correct responses to the repeated stimulus.
In cases of habituation, where the
animal has
ceased to give overt response to what was formerly
a disturbing stimulus.
In cases where the pattern of the response is mini-
mally determined by experience and maximally de-
termined by genetic factors.
In cases where the response is now highly
s(~reo­
typed.

structure is not itself subject to change resulting
from the passage of impulses within the circuit-

"response" are as the engineers say "soldered in."

nian player. In fact, the Von Neumannian "player" forces us
to a very careful examination of what we .mean by "trial and
error" learning, and indeed what is meant by "learning" of
any kind. The assumption regarding the meaning of the
word "error" is not trivial and must now be examined.
There is a sense in which the "player" can be wrong. For
example, he may base a decision upon probabilistic consid-
erations and then make that move which, in the light of the
limited available information, was most probably right. When
more information becomes available, he may discover·that
that move was wrong. But this discovery can contrilh#e
nothing to his future skill. By definition, the player used
correctly all the available information. He estimated the
probabilities correctly and made the move which was most
probably correct. The discovery that he was wrong in the
particular instance can have no bearing upon future in-
stances. When the same problem retlllTls at a later time, he
will correctly go through the same computations and reach
the same decision. Moreover, the set of alternatives among
which he makes his choice will be the same set-and cor-
rectly so.
In contrast, an organism is capable of being wrong in a
number of ways of which the "player" is incapable. These
wrong choices are appropriately called "error" when they are
of such a kind that they would provide information to the
organism which might contribute to his future skill. These
will all be cases in which some of the available information
was either ignored or incorrectly used. Various species of
such profitable error can be classified.
Suppose that the external event system contains details
which might tell the organism: (a) from what set of alterna-
tives he should choose his next move; and (b) which mem-
ber of that set he should choose. Such a situation permits
two orders of error-
(1)
The
organism
may use correctly the information
which tells him from what set of alternatives he should
choose, but choose the wrong alternative within this set; or
(2) He may choose from the wrong set of alternatives.
(There is also an interesting class of cases in which the sets
of alternatives contain common members. It is then pOSSible
for the organism to be "right" but for the wrong reasons.
This form of error is inevitably self-reinforcing.)

If now we accept the overall notion that all learning
(~ther

~,in some degree stochastic
(f.e., contams, components of
trial and error"), it follows
that an ordermg of the processes of learning can be built
upon an hierarchic classification of the types of error which
are t? be :orrected in the various learning processes. Zero
learnmg will then be the label for the immediate base of all
those
~cts (simI;Jle and complex) which are not subject to
co~rection by trial and.e;ror. Learning I will be an appro-
pr1ate label for. the reVlSIO~ of choice within an unchanged
sep of alternatives; Learnmg II will· be the label for the
revision of the set from which the choice is to be made; and
soon.
Learning I
F?llo~g the f~,rmal"analogy prOvided by the "laws" of
motion (f.e., the
rules
for describing motion), we now
look for the class of phenomena which are appropriately
described as changes in zero learning (as "motion" describes
~ange of position). !heseare the cases in which an entity
gI."es at Tune 2. a different response from what it gave at
Tune 1, and agll;ID we enco~ter a variety of cases Variously
related to expenence, phYSIOlogy, genetics, and mechanical
process:
(a) There is the phenomenon of habituation-the change
from responding to each occurrence of a repeated event to
not overtly responding. There is also the extinction or loss of
habituation, which may occur as a result of a more or less
long gap .or other interruption in the sequence of repetitions
of ~e
~timulus event. (Habituation is of especial interest.
~pecificlty ?f ,response, which we are calling zero learning,
IS characterIStic of all protoplasm, but it is interesting to note
that "habituation".is perhaps the only form of Learning I
which living things can achieve without a neural circuit.)
(b) The most familiar and perhaps most studied case is
that of the classical Pavlovian. conditioning. At Time 2 the
dog.salivates in response to the buzzer; he did not do this
at Tune 1.
(c) There is the "learning" which occurs in contexts of
instrumental reward and instrumental avoidance.

(d) There is the phenomenon of rote learning, in which
:
an item in the behavior of the organism becomes a stimulus
for another item of behavior.
(e) There is the disruption, extinction, or inhibition of
"completed" learning which may follow change
01" absence
of reinforcement.
In a word, .the list of Learning I contains those items
which are most commonly called "learning" in the psycho-
logical laboratory.
Note that in all cases of Learning I, there is in our de-
scription an assumption about the "context." This ,assumptIon
must be made explicit. The definition of Learning I assun'les
that the buzzer (the stimulus) is somehow the "same" at
Time 1 and at Time 2. And this assumption of "sameness"
must also delimit the "context," which must (theoretically)
be the same at both times. It follows that the events which
occurred at Time 1 are not, in our description, included in
our definition of the context at Time 2, because to include
them would at once create a gross difference between "con-
text at Time 1" and "context at Time 2."
(To paraphrase
Heraclitus: "No man can go to bed with the same girl for
the first time twice.")
The conventional assumption that context can be re-
peat~d, at least in some cases, is one which the writer adopts
10 this essay as a cornerstone of the thesis that the study of
behavior must be ordered according to the Theory of Logi-
cal Types. Withoot the assumption of repeatable context
(andthe hypothesis that for the Organisms which we study
the sequence of experience is really somehow punctuated in
this manner), it would follow that all "learning" would be of
one type:
namely,
all would be zero learning.
Of the
Pavlovian experiment, we would simply say that the dog's
neural circuits contain "soldered in" from the beginning such
characteristics that in Context A at Time 1 he will not sali-
vate, and that in the totally different Context B at Time 2 he
will salivate. What previously we called "learning" we would
now describe as "discrimination" between the events of Time
1 and the events of Time 1 plus Time 2. It would then
follow logically that all questions of the type, "Is this be-
havior 'learned' or 'innate'?" should be answered in favor of
genetics.
,I
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
289
We would, argue that without the assumption of repeat-
able context, our thesis falls to the ground, together with the
whole general concept of "learning." If, on the other hand,
the assumption of repeatable context is accepted as somehow
tru~ of the. organisms which we study, then the case for
lOgIcal typ10g of the phenomena of learning necessarily
sta~ds, because the notion "context" is itself subject to logical
typ1Og.
Either we must discard the notion of "context,"
or we
reupo this notion and, with it, accept the hierarchic series-
stiwulus, context of stimul1)S, context of context of stfmulus
etc. This series can be spelled out in the form of a hierarch;
of logical types as follows:
Stimulus is an elementary signal, internal or external.
Context of stimulus is a metamessage which classifies the
elementary Signal.
Context of context of stimulus is a meta-metamessage
which classifies the metamessage.
And so on.
The same hierarchy could have been built up from the
notion of "response" or the notion of "reinforcement."
Alternatively, following up the hierarchic classification of
errors to be corrected by stochastic process or "trial and
error," we may regard "context" as a collective term for all
those events which tell the organism among what set of
alternatives he must make his next choice.
At this point it is convenient to introduce the term "con-
text marker." An organism responds to the "same" stimulus
differently in differing contexts, and we must therefore ask
about the source of the organisms's information. From what
percept does he know that Context A is different from Con-
text B?
In many instances, there may be no specific signal or
label which will classify and differentiate the two contexts,
and the organism will be forced to get his information from
the actual congeries of events that make up the context in
each case. But, certainly in human life and probably in that
of
m~ny. other
or~anisms, there occur signals whose major
function IS to clas81fy contexts. It is not unreasonable to sup-
PQse that when the harness is placed upon the dog, who
has had prolong~d training in the psycholOgical laboratory,
he knows from this that he is now embarking upon a series of

These, however, are examples from the social life of .a
highly complex organism, and it is more profitable at thIS
stage to ask about the analogous phenomena at the pre-
verbal level.
A dog may see the leash in his master's hand and act .as
if he knows that this indicates a walk; or he may get ill-
fonnation from the sound of the word "walk" that this type
of context or sequence is coming.

When a rat starts a sequence of exploratory activities, does
he do so in response to a "stimulus?" Or in response to a
context? Or in response to a context marker?

contexts of a certain sort. Such a source of infonnation we
shall call a "context marker," and note immediately that, at
least at the human level, there are also "markers of contexts
of contexts." For example: an audience is watching Hamlet
on the stage, and hears the hero discuss suicide in ~e con-
text of his relationship with his dead father, Ophelia, and
the rest. The audience members do not immediately tele-
phone for the police because they have received infonnation
about the context of Hamlet's context. They know that it is a
"play" and have· receive~ this infonn~tion from ~any "mark-
ers of context of context -the playbIlls, the seating arrange-
ments, the curtain, etc., etc. The "King," on the other hand,
when he lets his conscience be pricked by the play within
the play, is ignoring many "markers of context of context."

within the category of "context markers." A few examples

These questions bring to the surface fmmal problems
about the Theory of Logical Types which must be dis-
cussed. The theory in its original fonn deals only with rig-
orously digital communication, and it is doubtful how far it
may be applied to analogue or iconic systems. What we are
here calling "context markers" may be digital (e.g., the word
"walk" mentioned above); or they may be analogue signals
-a briskness in the master's movements may indicate that a
walk is pending; or some part of the coming context may
serve as a marker (the leash as a part of the walk); or in the
extreme case, the walk itself in all its complexity may stand
for itself, with no label or marker between the dog and the
experience. The perceived event itself may communicate its
own occurrence. In this case, of course, there can be no
error of the "menu card" type. Moreover, no paradox can be
generated because in purely analogue or iconic communica-
tion there is no signal for "not."
There is, in fact, almost no fonnal theory dealing with
analogue communication and, in particular"no equivalent of
InfOlmation Theory or Logical Type Theory. This gap in
fonnal knowledge is inconvenient when we leave the rarified
world of logic and mathematics and come face to face with
the phenomena of natural history. In the natural world,
communication is rarely either purely digital or pillely ana-
logic. Often discrete digital pips are combined together to
make analogic pictures as in the printer's halftone block;
and sometimes, as in the matter of context markers, there is
a continuous gradation from the ostensive through the iconic
to the purely digital. At the digital end of this scale all the
theorems of infonnation theory have their full force, but at
the ostensive and analogic end they are meaningless.
It seems also that while much of the behavioral communi-
cation of even higher mammals remains ostensive or analogic,
the
internal
mechanism
of
these
creatures
has
become
digitalized at least at the neuronal level. It would seem that
analogic communication is in some sense more primitive than
digital and that there is a broad evolutionary. trend .toward
the substitution of digital for analogic mechanisms. This trend
seems to operate faster in the evolution of internal mech-
anisms than in the evolution of external behavior.

'We recapitulate and extend the definitions so far given:
Zero learning is characterized by specificity of response,
which-right or wrong-is not subject to correction.
Learning I is change in specificity of response by correc-
tion of errors of choice within a set of alternatives.
Learning II is change in the process of Learning I, e.g.,
a corrective change in the set of alternatives from which
choice is made, or it is a change in how the sequence of
experience is punctuated.
Learning III is change in the process of Learning II,
e.g., a corrective change in the system of sets of alternatives
from which choice is made.
(We shall see later that to
demand, this level of performance of some men and some
mammals is sometimes pathogenic.)
Learning IV would be change in Learning III, but prob-
ably does not occur in any adult living organism on this
earth. Evolutionary process has, however, created organisms
whose ontogeny brings them to Level III. The combination
of phylogenesis with ontogenesis, in fact, achieves Level
IV.
Our immediate task is to give substance to the definition
of Learning II as "change in Learning I," and it is for this
that the ground has been prepared. Briefly, I believe that
the phenomena of Learning II cim all be included under the
rubric of changes in the manner in which the stream of action
and experience is segmented or punctuated into contexts
together with changes in the use of context markers.

The list of phenomena classified under Learning I includes
a
considerable
(but
not
exhaustive)
set
of
differ«ntly
structured contexts. In classical Pavlovian contexts, the contin-
gency pattern which describes the relation between "stimu-
lus" (CS), animal's action (CR), and reinforcement (DCS)
is profoundly different from the contingency pattern charac-
teristic of instrumental contexts of learning.

is
a
necessary
premise for any theory which defines "learning" as change.
(b) This notiOIl. is not a mere tool of our description but
contains the implicit hypothesis that for the organisms which
we study, the sequence of ,life experience, action, etc., is
somehow segmented or punctuated into subsequences or
"contexts" which may be equated 'or differentiated by the
organism.
(c) The distinction which is commonly drawn between
perception and action, afferent and efferent, input and out-
put, is for higher organisms in complex situations not valid.
On the one hand, ,almost every item of action may be re-
ported either by external sense or endoceptive mechanism
to the C.N.S., and in this case the report of this item be-
comes an input. And, on the other hand, in higher organisms,
perception is not by any means a process of mere passive
receptivity but is at least partly determined by efferent con-
trol from
higher centers. Perception,
notoriously,
can be
changed by experience. In principle, we must allow bo1;h for
the possibility that every item of action or output may create
an item of input; and that percepts may in some cases par-
take of the nature of output. It is no accident that almost all
sense organs are used for the emission of Signals between
organisms. Ants communicate by their ~ntennae; dogs by the
pricking of their ears; and so on.
(d) In principle, even in zero learning, any item of
ex~
perience or behavior may be regarded as either "stimulus"
or "response" or as both, according to how the total sequence
is punctuated. When the scientist says that the buzzer is
the "stimulus" in a given sequence, his utterance implies an
hypothesis
about how
the
organism punctuates
that se-
quence. In Learning I, every item of perception or behavior
may be stimulus or response or reinforcement according to
how the total sequence of interaction is punctuated:

In the Pavlovian case: If stimulus and a certain lapse of
tUne: then reinforcement.
In the Instrumental Reward case: If stimulus and a par-
ticular item of behavior: then reinforcement.
In the Pavlovian case, the reinforcement is not contingent
upon the animal's behavior, whereas in the instrumental
case, it is. Using this contrast as an example, we say that
Learning II has occurred if it can be shown that expe?ence
of one or more contexts of the Pavlovian type results ill the
animal's acting in some later context as though this, too, had
the Pavlovian contingency pattern. Similarly, if past experi-
ence of instrumental sequences leads an animal to act in
some later context as though expecting this also to be an
instrumental context, we shall again say that Learning II has
occurred.
When so defined, Learning II is adaptive only if the ani-
mal happens to be right in its expectation of a given con-
tingency pattern, and in such a case we shall ~xpect to se~ a
measurable learning to learn. It should reqwre fewer trIals
in the new context to establish "correct" behavior. If; on the
other hand, the animal is wrong in ms identification of the
later contingency pattern, then we shall expect a delay of
Learning I in the new context. The animal who has had
prolonged experience of Pavlovian co~texts might never~et
around to the particular sort of trial-and-error behaVIOr
necessary to discover a correct instrumental response.
There are at least four fields of experimentation where
Learning II has been carefully recorded:
(a) In human rote learning. Hu1l6 carried out very careful
quantitative studies which revealed this phenomenon, and
constructed a mathematical model which would simulate or
explain the curves of Learning I which he recorded. He also
observed a second-order phenomenon which we may call
"learning to rote learn" and published the curves for this
phenomenon in the Appendix to his book. These curves were
separated from the main body of the book because, as he
states, his mathematical model (of Rote Learning I) did not
cover tms aspect of the data.

Rote Learning, New Haven, Yale University, Institute .

295
It is a corollary of the theoretical position which we here
take that no amount of rigorous discourse of a given logical
type can "explain" phenomena of a higher type. Hull's model
acts as a touchstone of logical typing, automatically excluding
from explanation phenomena beyond its logical scope. That
this was s~and that Hull perceived it-is testimonial both
to his rigor and to his perspicacity.
What the data show is that for any given subject, there
is an improvement in rote learning with successive sessions,
asymptotically approaching a degree of skill which varied
from subject to subject.
.
The context for this rote learning was quite complex and
no doubt appeared subjectively different to each learner.
Some may have been more motivated by fear of being
wrong, while others looked rather for the satisfactions of
being right. Some would be more influenced to put up a
good record as. compared with the other subjects; others
would be fascinated to compete in each session with their
own previous showing, and so on. All must have had ideas
(correct or incorrect) about the nature of the experimental
setting, all must have had "levels of aspiration," imd all must
have had previous experience of memorizing various sorts of
material. Not one of Hull's subjects could have come into the
learning context uninfluenced by previous Learning II.
In spite of all this previous Learning II, and in spite of
genetic differences which might operate at this level, all
showed improvement over several sessions. This improvement
cannot have been due to Learning I because any recall of
the specific sequence of syllables learned in the previous
session would not be of use in dealing with the new
sequence. Such recall would more probably be a hindrance.
I submit, therefore, that the improvement from session to
session can only be accounted for by some sort of adaptation
to the context which Hull provided for rote learning.
It is also worth noting that educators have strong opinions
about the value (positive or negative) of training in rote
learning. "Progressive" educators insist on training in "inSight,"
while the more conservative insist on rote and drilled recall.
(b) The second type of Learning II which has been ex-
perimentally studied is called "set learning."
The concept
and term are derived from Harlow and apply to a rather
special case of Learning II. Broadly, what Harlow did was to

does not occur in absence of the many context markers
characteristic of the laboratory situation.7
It appears, then, that Learning II is a necessary preparation
for the behavioral disturbance. The information, "This is a
context for discrimination," is communicated at the beginning
of the sequence and underlined in the series of stages in
which discrimination is made progreSSively more difficult. But
when discrimination becomes impOSSible, the structure of the
context is totally changed. The context markers (e.g., the
smell of the laboratory and the experimental harness) now
become misleading because the animal is in a situation which
demands guesswork or gambling, not discrimination. The en-
tire
experimental
sequence is,
in fact,
a
procedure for
putting the animal in the wrong at the level of Learning II.
o In my phrase, the animal is placed in a typical "double
bind," which is expectably schizophrenogenic.8
.
In the strange world outside the psychological laboratory,
phenomena which belong to the category Learning II are a
major preoccupation of anthropologists, educators, psychia-
trists, animal trainers, human parents, and children. All who
think about the processes which determine the character of
the individual or the processes of change in human (or ani-
mal) relationship must use in their thinking a variety of
assumptiQns about Learning II. From time to time, these
people call in the laboratory psychologist as a consultant, and
then are confronted with a linguistic barrier. Such barriers
must always result when, for example, the psychiatrist is talk-
ing about Learning II, the psychologist is talking about Learn-
ing I, and neither recognizes the logical structure of the
diHerence.
Of the multitudinous ways in which Learning II emerges
in humanaHairs, only three will be discussed in this essay:
(a)
In describing individual human beings,
both the
scientist and the layman commonly resort to adjectives de-
scriptive of "character." It is said that Mr. Jones is dependent,
hostile,
fey,
finicky,
anxious,
exhibitionistic,
narcissistic,

present rhesus monkeys with more or less complex gestalten
or "problems." These the monkey had to solve to get a food
reward. Harlow showed that if these problems were of simi-
lar "set," i.e., contained. similar types of logical complexity,
there was a carry-over of learning from one problem to the
next. There were, in fact, two orders of contingency patterns
involved in Harlow's experiments: first the overall pattern of
instrumentalism (if the monkey solves the problem, then
reinforcement); and second, the contingency patterns of
logic within the specific problems.
(c) Bitterman and others have recently set a fashion in
experimentation with "reversal learning." Typically in these
experiments the subject is first taught a binary discrimination.
When this has been learned to criterion, the meaning of
the stimuli is reversed. If X initially "meant" RI> and Y
initially meant R2, then after reversal X comes to mean
R
"
and Y comes to mean RI • Again the trials are run to
criterion when again the meanings are reversed. In these
experiments, the crucial question is: Does the subject learn
about the reversal? I.e., after a series of reversals, does the
subject reach criterion in fewer trials than he did at the
beginning of the series?
In these experiments, it is conspicuously clear that the
question asked is of logical type higher than that of questions
about simple learning. If simple learning is based upon a set
of trials, then reversal learning is based upon a set of such
sets. The parallelism between this relation and Russell's rela-
tion between "class" and "class of classes" is direct.
(d)
Learning II is also exempli6.'ed in the well-known
phenomena of "experimental neurosis." Typically an animal
is trained, either in a Pavlovian or instrumental learning con-
text, to discriminate between some X and some Y; e.g.,
between an ellipse and a circle. When this discrimination has
been learned, the task is made more difficult: the ellipse is
made progressively fatter and the circle is flattened. Finally
a stage is reached at which discrimination is impossible. At
this stage the animal starts to show symptoms of severe
disturbance.
Notably, (a) a naive animal, presented with a situation in
which some X may (on some random basis) mean either
A or B, does not show disturbance; and (b) the disturbance

humorous, playful, canny, optimistic,perfectionist, careless,
careful, casual, etc. In the light of what has already been
said, the reader will be able to assign all these adjectives to
their appropriate logical type. All are descriptive of (possi-
ble) results of Learning II, and if we would define these
words more carefully, our definition will consist in laying
down the contingency pattern of that context of Learning I -
which would. expectably bring about that Learn,ing II which
would make the adjective applicable.
We might say of the "fatalistic" man that the pattern of
his transactions with the environment is such as he might
have acquired by prolonged or repeated experience as sub-
ject of Pavlovian experiment; and note that this definition of
"fatalism" is specific and precise. There are many other
forms of "fatalism" besides that which is d.efined in terms of
this particular context of learning. There is, for example, the
more complex type characteristic of classical Greek tragedy
where a man's own action is felt to aid the inevitable working
of fate.
(b) In the punctuation of human interaction. The critical
reader will have observed that the adjectives above which
purport to describe individual character are really not strictly
applicable to the individual but rather describe transactions
between the individual and his material and human environ-
ment. No man is "resourceful" or "dependent" or "fatalistic"
in a vacuum. His characteristic, whatever it be, is not his but
is rather a characteristic of what -goes on between him and
something (or somebody) else.
,
This being so, it is natural to look into what gOes on be-
tween people, there to find contemof Learning I which are
likely to lend their shape to processes of Learning II. In such
systems, involving two or more persons, where most of the
important events are postures, actions, -or utterances of the
living creatures, we note immediately that the stream of
events is commonly punctuated into contexts of learning by a
tacit agreement between the persons regarding the nature of
their relationship--or by context markers and tacit agreement
that these context markers shall "mean" the same for both
parties. It is insbuctive to attempt analysis of an ongoing
interchange between A and B. We ask about any particular
item of A's behavior: Is this item a stimulus for B? Or is it a
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
299
response of A to something B said earlier? Or is it a rein-
forcement of some item provided by B? Or is A, in this item,
consummating areinforcement for himself? Etc.
Such questions will reveal at once that for many items of
A's behavior the answer isoften quite unclear. Or if there be a
clear answer, the clarity is due only to a tacit (rarely fully
explicit) agreement between A and B as to the nature of
their mutual roles, i.e., as to the nature of the contextual
sbuctmo which they will expect of each other.
If we look at such an exchange in the abstract: • • • • . •
a1b1a2b2asbsa4b4a5b5 •.•... , where the a's refer to items
of A's behavior, and the b's to items of B's behavior, we can
take any flt and construct around it three simple contexts of
leammg. These will be:
i.
(aj bj aj+1), in which aj is the stimulus for bj'
ii. (bj- 1 flt bj), in which aj is the response to bj-l> which
response B reinforces with bj'
"-
iii. (aj-1 bj - 1 ajL in which aj is now A's reinforcement
of B's bj-l> which Was response to aj-1'
It follows that aj may be a stimulus for B or it may be
A's response to B, or it may be A's reinforcement of B,
,
Beyond this, however, if 'we consider the ambiguity of
the notions "stimulus" and "response," "afferent" and "ef-
ferent"-as discussed above--we note that any al may also
be a stimulus for A; it may be A's reinforcement of self; or it
may be A's response to some previous behavior of his own, as
is the case in sequences of rote behavior.
This general ambiguity means 'in fact that· the ongoing
sequence of interchange between two persons is sbuctured
only by the
person~s own perception of the sequence as a
series of contexts, each context leading into the next. The
particular manner in which the sequence is sbuctured by any
particular person will be determined by that person's previ-
ous Learning II (or possibly by his genetics).
In such a system, words like "dominant" and "submissive,"
"succoring" and "dependent" will take on definable meaning
as descriptions of segments of interchange. We shall say that
"A dominates B" if A and B show by their behavior that
they see their relationship as characterized by sequences of
the type
a1b1~, where a1 is seen (by A and B)
as a
signal defining conditions of instrumental reward or punish-

error behavior will simply continue. The premises of "pur-
pose" are simply_not of the same logical type as the material
facts of life, and therefore cannot easily be contradicted by
them.
The practitioner of magic does not unlearn his magical
view of events when the magic does not work. In fact, the
propositions which govern punctuation have the general
characteristic of being self-validating.9 What we term "con-
text" includes the subject's behavior as well as the external
events. But this behavior is controlled by former Learning II
and therefore it will be of such a kind as to mold the total
context to fit the expected punctuation. In sum, this self-
validating characteristic of the content of Learning II has the
effect that such learning is almost ineradicable. It follows that
~earning II acquired in infancy is likely to persist through
life.
Con~e~sely, we mus! expect
~any cif the important
charactenstics of an adult s punctuation to have their roots
in early infancy.
In regard to the unconsciousness
of these habits
of
punctuation, we observe that the "unconscious" includes not
onlr: repressed material but also most of the processes and
hah~s of gestalt"perception. Subjectively we are aware of
our
dependency but unable to say clearly how this pattern
was constructed nor what cues were used in our creation of

Learning III
What has
been said
above .about the
self-validating
chara~ter of ~re~ises acquired by Learning II indicates that
Learnmg III IS likely to be difficult and rare even in human
beings. _Expectably, it will also be difficult for scientists who
are only human, to imagine or describe this process. B~t it is
claimed that something of the sort does from time to time
occur in psychotherapy, religiOUS conversion, and in other
sequences in which -there is profound reorganization of
character.

ment; hi as a signal or act obeying these conditions; and
a2 as a signal reinforcing hi'
Similarly we shall say that "A is dependent on B" if their
relationship is characterized by sequences alhla2, where al
is seen as a signal of weakness; hi as a helping act; and
a2 as an acknowledgement of hi'
But it is up to A and B to distinguish (consciously or un-
consciously or not at all) between "dominance" and "de-
pendence." A "command" can closely resemble a
cry for
"help."
(c) In psychotherapy, Learning II is exempli6.ed most con-
spicuously by the phenomena of "transference." Orthodox
Freudian theory asserts that the patient will inevitably bring
to the therapy room inappropriate notions·about his relation-
ship to the therapist. These notions
(conscious or uncon-
scious) will be such that he will act and talk in a way
which would press the therapist to respond in ways which
would resemble the patient's picture of how some important
other person (usually a parent) treated the patient in the
near or distant past. In the language of the present paper,
the patient will try to shape his interchange with the
therapist according to the premises of his
(the patient's)
former Learning II.
It is commonly observed that much of the Learning II
which determines a patient's transference patterns and, in-
deed, determines much of the -relational life of all human
beings, (a) dates from early infancy, and (h) is unconscious.
Both of these generalizations seem to be correct and both
need some explanation.
,
It seems probable that these two generalizations are true
because of the very nature of the phenomena which we are
discussing. We suggest that what is learned in Learning II is
a way of punctuating events. But a way of punctuating is not
true or false. -There is nothing contained in the propositions
of this learning that can be tested against reality. It is like a
picture seen in an inkblot; it has neither correctness nor
incorrectness. It is only a way of seeing the inkblot.
Consider the instrumental view of life. ~ organism with
this view of life in a new situation will engage in mal-and-
error behavior in order to make the situation provide a posi-
tive reinforcement. If he fails to get this reinforcement, his
purposive philosophy is not thereby negated. His trial-and-

assert that these matters are totally beyond the reach of
language. But, in spite of this warning, let me begin to
speculate about what must (logically) be the case.
First a distinction must be drawn: it was noted above
that the experiments in reversal learning demonstrate Learn-
ing II whenever there is measurable learnin~ aboot the ,fact
of reversal. It is possible to learn (Learnmg I) a gtven
premise at a given time and to learn the converse premis~ at
a later time without acquiring the knack of Jeversal learmng.
In such a case, there will be no improvement from one
reversal to the next. One item of Learning I has simply re-
placed another item of Learning I without any achievement of
Learning II. H, on the other himd, improvement occurs with
successive reversals, this is evidence for Learning II.
If we apply the same sort of logiC to the relation between
Learning II and Learning III, we are led to expect that there
might be replacement of premises at the level of Learning II
withoot the achievement of any Learning III.
Preliminary to any discussion of Learning III, it is there-
fore necessary to discriminate between mere replacement
without Learning III and that facilitation of replacement
which would be truly Learning III.
That psychotherapists should be able to aid their patients
even in a mere replacement of premises acquired by Learn-
ing II is already no mean feat when we consider the self-
validating character of such premises and their more or less
unconscious nature. But that this much can be done there
is no doubt.
Within
the
controlled
and
protected
setting
of
the
therapeutic relationship, the therapist may attempt one or
more of the following maneuvers:
.
(a) to achieve a confrontation between the premIses of
the patient and those of the therapist-,,;,ho. is carefully
trained not to fall into the trap of validating the old
premises;
.
(b) to get the patient to act, either in the ther~py room
or outside, in ways which will confront his own premISes;
.
(c)
to demonstrate contradiction among the premIses
which currently control the patient's behavior;
(d) to induce in the patient some exag~eration or caric~­
ture (e.g., in dream or hypnosis) of expenence based on hIS
old premises.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
303
As William Blake noted, long ago, "Without Contraries is
no progression."
(Elsewhere I have called these contradic-
tions at level II "double binds.")
But there are always loopholes by which the impact of
contradiction can be reduced. It is a commonplace of learn-
ing psychology that while the subject will learn (Learning I)
more rapidly if he is reinforced every time he responds
correctly, such learning will disappear rather rapidly if rein-
forcement ceases. H, on the other hand, reinforcement is
only occasional, the subject will learn more slowly but the
resulting learning will not easily be extinguished when rein-
forcement ceases altogether. In other words, the subject may
learn (Learning II) that the context is such that absence of
reinforcement does not indicate that his response was wrong
or inappropriate. His view of the context was, in fact, correct
until the experimenter changed his tactics.
The therapist must certainly so support or hedge the con-
traries by which the patient is driven that loopholes of this
and other kinds are blocked. The Zen candidate who has
been assigned a paradox (koan) must labor at his task "like a
mosquito biting on an iron bar."
I have argued elsewhere ("Style, Grace, and Infonnation in
Primitive Art," see p. 128) that an essential and necessary
function of all habit fonnation and Learning II is an economy
of the thought processes (or neural pathways) which are
used for problem-solving or Learning I. The premises of what
is commonly called "character"-the definitions of the "self"
-save the individual from having to examine the abstract,
philosophical, aesthetic, and ethical aspects of many se-
quences of life. "I don't know whether it's good music; I only
know whether I like it."
But Learning III will throw these unexamined premises
open to question and change.
Let us, as was done above for Learning I and II, list some
of the changes which we shall be willing to call Learning
III.
(a) The individual might learn to fonn more readily those
habits the fonning of which we call Learning II.
(b) He might learn to close for himself the "loopholes"
which would allow him to avoid Learning III.
(c) He might learn to change the habits acquired by
, Learning II.

304
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
(d) He might learn that he is a creature which can and
does Wlconsciously achieve Learning II.
(e) He might learn to limit or direct his Learning II.
(f) If Learning II is a learning of the contexts of Learning
I, then Learning III should be a learning of. the contexts of
those contexts.
But the above list proposes a paradox. Learning III (i.e.,
leariling about Learning II) may lead either to an increase
in Learning II or to a limitation and perhaps a reduction of
that phenomenon. Certainly it must lead to a greater flexi-
bility in the premises acquired by the process of Learning II
-a freedom from their bondage.
I once heard a Zen master state categorically: "To become
accustomed to anything isa terrible thing."
But any freedom from the bondage of habit must also
denote a profoWld redefinition of the seH. If I stop at the
level of Learning II, "I" am the aggregate of those character-
istics which I call my "character." "I" am my habits of acting
in context and shaping and perceiving the contexts in which
I act. SeHhood is a product or aggregate of Learning II. To
the degree that a man achieves Learning III, and learns to
perceive and act in terms of the contexts of contexts, his
"seH" will take on a sort of irrelevance. The concept of "seH"
will no longer fWlction as a nodal argument in the pWlctua-
tion of experience.
This matter needs to be examined. In the discussion of
Learning II, it was asserted that all words like "dependency,"
"pride," "fatalism," refer to characteristics of the seH which
are learned (Learning II) in sequences of relationship. These
words are, in fact, terms for "roles" in relationships 'and refer
to something artificially chopped out of interactive sequences.
It was also suggested that the correct way to assign rigorous
meaning to any such words is to spell out the formal structure
of the sequence in which the named characteristic might
have been learned. Thus the interactive sequence of Pavlov-
ian learning was proposed asa paradigm for a certain sort
vf "fatalism," etc.
But now we are asking about the contexts of these con-
texts of learning. i.e., about the larger sequences within
which such paradigms are embedded.
Consider the small item of Learning II which was men-
tioned above as providing a "loophole" for escape from Learn-
---------,
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
305
ing III. A certain characteristic of the seH-call it "persis-
tence"-is generated by experience in multiple sequences
among which reinforcement is sporadic. We must now ask
about the· larger context of such sequences. How are such
sequences generated?
The question is explosive. The simple stylized experimen-
tal sequence of interaction in the laboratory is generated by
and partly determines a network of contingencies which goes
out in a hWldred directions leading out of the laboratory into
the processes by which psycholOgical research is designed,
the interactions between psychologists, the economics of re-
search money, etc., etc.
Or consider the same formal sequence in a more "natural"
setting. An organism is searching for a needed or missing
object. A pig is rooting for acorns, a gambler is feeding a slot
~achine hoping for a jackpot, or a man must find the key to
his car. There are thousands of situations where living things
must persist in certain sorts of behavior precisely because
r~inf~rcement ~ sporadic or
~probable. Learning II will
SImplify the UDlverse by handling these instances as a single
category. But if Learning III be concerned with the contexts
of these instances, then the categories of Learning II will be
burst open.
.
Or consider what the word "reinforcement" means at the
various levels. A porpoise gets a fish from the trainer when
he does what the trainer wants. At level I, the fact of the
fish is linked with the "rightness" of the particular action. At
level II, the fact of the fish confirms the porpOise's Wlder-
standing of his (pOSSibly instrumental or dependent) rela-
tionship with the trainer. And note that at this level if the
porpoise hates or fears the trainer, pain received fr~m the
latter may be a positive reinforcement confirming that hate
("If it's not the way I want it, I'll prove it.")
.
But what of "reinforcement" at level III (for porpoise or
forman)?
If, as I have suggested above, the creature is driven to'
level·III by "contraries" generated at level II, then we may
expect that it is the resolving of these contraries that Will
constitute positive reinforcement at level III. Such resolution
can take many forms.
Even the attempt at level III can be dangerous and some
fall by the wayside. These are often labeled by psychiatry as

-
306
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
psychotic, and many of them find themselves inhibited from
using the first person pronoun.
For others, more successful, the resolution of the contraries
may be a collapsing of much that was leamed at level II,
revealing a simplicity in which hunger leads directly to eat-
ing, and the identified self is no longer in charge of organizing
the behavior. These are the incorruptible innocents of the
world.
For others, more creative, the resolution of contraries re-
veals a world in which personal identity merges into all the
processes of relationship in some vast ecology or aesthetics
of cosmic interaction. That any of these can survive seems
almost miraculous, but some are perhaps saved from being
swept away on oceanic feeling by their ability to focus in on
the minutiae of life. Every detail of the universe is seen as
proposing a view of the whole. These are the' people for
whom Blake wrote the famous advice in the "Auguries of
Innocence:"
To see the World in a Grain of Sand,'
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour.
.
The Role of Genetics in'Psychology
Whatever can be said about an animal's learning or in-
ability to learn has bearing upon the genetic make-up of the
animal. And what has been said here about the' levels of
learning has bearing upon the whole interplay between
genetic make-up and the changes which that individual can
and must achieve.
For any given organism, there is an upper limit beyond
which all is determiDed by'genetics. Planarians can probably
not go beyond Learning I. Mammals other than man are
probably capable of Learning II but incapable of Learning
III. Man may sometimes achieve Learning III.
This upper limit for any organism is (logically and pre-
sumably) set by genetic phenomena, not perhaps by in-
dividual genes or combinations of genes, but by whatever
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
307
factors control the development of basic phylar character-
istics.
For every change of which an organism is capable, there
is the fact of that capability. This fact may be genetically
determined; or the capability may have been learned. If the
latter, then genetics may have determined the capability of
learning the capability. And so on.
This is in general true of all somatic changes as well as of
those behavioral changes which we call learning. A man's
skin tans in the sun. But where does genetics enter this
picture? Does genetics completely determine his ability to
tan? Or can some men increase their ability to tan? In the
latter case, the genetic factors evidently have effect at a
higher logical level.
The problem in regard to any behavior is clearly not
"Is it learned or is it innate?" but "Up to what logical level is
learning effective and down to what level does genetics play
a determinative or partly effective role?"
The broad history of the evolution of learning seems to
have been a,slow pushing back of genetic determinism to
levels of higher logical type.
A Note on Hierarchies
The .model discussed in this paper assumes, .tacitly, that
the logICal. types can be ordered in the form of a simple, un-
branching ladder. I believe that it was wise to deal first with
the problems raised by such a Simple model.
But the world of action, experience, organization, and
learning cannot be completely mapped onto a model which
excludes propositions about the relation between classes of
differentlogical type.
If C1 is a class of propositions, and C2is a class of
propositions about the members of C1; Cs then being a class
of propositions about the members of C2 ; how then shall we
classify propositions about the relation between these classes?
For example, the proposition "As members of C1 are to
members of C2, so members of C2 are to members of Ca"
cannot be classified within the unbranching ladder of types.
The whole of this essay is built upon the premise that
the relation between C2. and Ca can be compared with the
l

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
relation betwee~ CI and C2• Ihave again and again taken a
stance to the sIde of my ladder of logical types to discuss
the structure of this ladder. The essay is therefore itself an
example of the fact that the ladder is not unbranching.
It ~ollows.that a next task will be to look for examples of
learmng.which cam:ot be classified in terms of my hierarchy
of le:unmg but whICh !all ,to the side 9f this hierarchy as
learmng about the relation between steps of the hierarchy. I
have suggested elsewhere ("Style, Grace, and Information
in Primitive Art") that art is commonly concerned with learn-
ing of this sort, i.e., with bridging the
g~p between the
more or less
unc~nsc~ous premises acquired by Learning II
and the more eplSodIC content of consciousness and imme-
diate action.
.
I~
sho~ld
~lso be noted that the structure of this essay
IS mductme ill the sense that the hierarchy of orders of
learning is presented to the reader from the bottom upward,
from level zero to level III. But it is not intended that the
explanations of the phenomenal world which the model af-
fords shall be unidirectional. In explaining the model to the
reader, a unidirectional approach was necessary, but within
the model it is assumed that higher levels are explanatory
of lower levels and vice versa. It is also assumed that a
similar reflexive relation-both inductive and deductive--ob-
tains among ideas and items of learning as these exist in
the lives of the creatures which we study.
Finally, the model remains ambiguous in the sense that
while it is asserted that there are explanatory or determina- -
tive relations between ideas of adjacent levels both upward
and downward, it is not clear whether direct.explanatory
relations exist between separated levels, e.g., between level
III and level I or between level zero and level II.
This question and that of the status of propositions and
ideas

the
hierarchy

The Cybernetics of "Self": ATheory of Alcoholism*
The "logic" of alcoholic addiction has puzzled psy-
chiatrists no less than the "logic" of the strenuous spiri- .
tual regime whereby the organization Alcoholics Anony-
mous is able to counteract the addiction. In the present
essay it is suggested: (1) that an entirely new epistemol-
ogy must come out of cybernetics' and systems theory,
involving a new understanding of mind, self, human
relationship, and power; (2) that the addicted alcoholic
is operating, when sober, in terms of an epistemology
which is conventional in Occidental culture but which
is not acceptable to systems theory; (3) that surrender
to alcoholic intoxication provides a partial and sub-
jective short cut to a more correct state of mind; and
(4) that the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous coincides
closely with an epistemology of cybernetics.
The present essay is based upon ideas which are, per-
haps all of them, familiar either to psychiatrists who have
had dealings with alcoholics.. or to philosophers who have
thought about the implications of cybernetics and systems
. theory. The only novelty which can be claimed for the
thesis here offered derives from treating these ideas se-
riously as premises of argument and from the bringing to-

310
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
gether of commonplace ideas from two too separate fields of
thought.
, In its first conception, this essay was planned to be a
systems-theoretic study of alcoholic addictiOn, in which I
would USe data from the publications of Alcoholics Auony- :
mous, which has the only outstanding record of success in
dealing with alcoholics. It soon became evident, however, '
that the religiOUS views and the organizational structure of
AA presented points of great interest to systems theory, and "
that the correct scope of my study should include not only"
the premises of alcoholism but also the premises of the AA
system of treating it and the premises of AA organization.
My debt to AA will be evident throughout-also, I hope,
my respect for that organization and especially for, the ex-
~
traordinary wisdom of its cofounders, Bill W. and Dr. Bob.
'
In addition, I have to acknowledge a, debt to a small
sample of alcoholic patients with whom I worked intensively
for about two years in 1949-52, in the Veterans Administra-
tion Hospital, Palo Alto, California. These men, it should be
mentioned, carried other ,diagnoses-mostly of
~schizophre­
nia"-in addition to the pains of alcoholism. Several were
members of AA. I fear that I helped them not at all.
The Problem
It is rather generally believed that "causes" or "reasons"
for alcoholism are to be looked for in the sober life of the
alcoholic. Alcoholics, in their sober manifestations, are
com~ "
monly
dubbed
"immature,"
"maternally
fixat~d,"
"oral,"
"homosexual,""passive-aggressive,"
"fearful
of
success,"
"oversensitive," "proud," "affable," or simply "weak." But the
logical implications of this belief are usually not examined:
(1) If the sober life of the alcoholic somehow drives him
to drink or proposes the first step toward intoxication, it is
not to be expected that any procedure which reinforces his
:
particular style of sobriety will reduce or control his alco-
'"
holism;
,
(2) If his style of sobriety drives him to drink, then that
style must contain error or pathology; and intoxication must
provide some-at least subjective-correction of this enor.
In other words, compared with his sobriety, which is in
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
311
some way "wrong," his intoxication must be in some way
"right." The old tag In vino ,veritas m,ay contain a truth more
profound than is usually attrIbuted to It.
(3) An alternative hypothesis would suggest that when
sober, the alcoholic is somehow more sane than the people
around him, and that this situation is intolerable. I have
heard alcoholics argue in favor of this possibility, but I shall
ignore it in this essay. I think that Bernard Smith, the non-
alcoholic legal representative of AA, came close to the mark
when he said, "the [AA] member was never enslaved by
alcohol. Alcohol simply served as an escape from personal
-enslavement to the false ideals of a materialistic society."1
It is not a matter of revolt against msane ideals around him
but of escaping from his own insane premises, which ,are
continually reinforced by the surrounding society. It is pos-
sible, however, that the alcoholic is in some way more vul-
nerable or sensitive than the normal to the fact that his
insane (but conventional) premises lead to unsatisfying re-
sults.
'
(4) The present theory of alcoholism, therefore, will pro-
vide a converse matching between the sobriety and the in-
toxication, such that the latter may be seen as an appropriate
subjective correction for the former.
(5) There are, of course, many instances in which people
resort to alcohol and even to extreme intoxication as an
anesthetic giving release 'from ordinary grief, resentment, or
physical pain. It might be argued that the anesthetic action
of alcohol provides a sufficient converse matching for our
theoretical purposes. I shall, however, specifically exclude
these cases from consideration as being not relevant to the
problem of addictive or repetitive alcoholism; and this in
spite of the undoubted fact that "grief," "resentment," and
"frustration" are commonly used by addicted alcoholics as
excuses for drinking.
.
I shall demand, therefore, a converse matching between
sobriety and intoxication more specific than that provided
by mere anesthesia.

puts it, "trying to use will power is like trying to lift yourseH

The first two steps of AA are adollows:

I·
The friends and relatives of the alcoholic commonly urge
him to be "strong," and to "resist temptation." What they
mean by this is not very clear, but it is significant that the
alcoholic himself-while sober-eommonly agrees with their
view of his "problem." He believes that he could be, or, at
least, ought to be "the captain of his soul."2 But it is a cliche
of alcoholism that after "that first drink," the motivation to
stop drinking is zero. Typically the whole matter is phrased
overtly as a battle between "self"
and "John Barleycorn."
Covertly the alcoholic may be planning or even secretly lay-
ing in supplies for the next binge, but it is almost impossible
(in the hospital setting) to get the sober alcoholic to plan
his next binge in an overt manner. He cannot, seemingly; be
the "captain" of his soul and overtly will or command his
own drunkenness. The "captain" can only command sobriety "
-and then not be obeyed.
Bill W., the cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, himseH
an alcoholic, cut through all this mythology of conflict in the
very first of the famous "Twelve Steps" of AA. The first
step demands that the alcoholic agree that he is powerless
over alcohol. This step is usually regarded as, a "surrender"
and many alcoholics are either unable to achieve it or
achieve it only briefly during the period of remorse following
a binge. AA does not regard these cases· as promising: they
have not yet "hit bottom"; their despair is ina<iequate and:
after a more or less brief spell of sobriety they will again
attempt to use "seH-control" to fight the "temptation." They
will not or cannot accept the premise that, drunk or sober,
the total personality of an alcoholic is an alcoholic personality ,
which cannot conceivably fight alcoholism. As an AA leaflet
•This phrase is used by AA in derision of the alcoholic "c
who tries to use will power against the bottle. The quota-
tion, along with the line, "My head is bloody but un-·
bowed," comes from the poem "Invictus" by William
Ernest Henley, who was a cripple but not an alcoholic.
I
The use of the will to conquer pain and physical' dis-'
I ability is probably not comparable to the alcoholic's
use of will.
1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol-that
our lives had become unmanageable.
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than our-
selves could restore us to sanity.s
Implicit in the com1:)ination of these two steps is an ex-
traordinary-and I
believe correct-idea:
the experience
of defeat not only serves to convince the alcoholic that
change is necessary; it is the first step in that change. To be
defeated by the bottle and to know it is the first "spiritual
experience." The myth of self-power is thereby broken by
the demonstration of a greater power.
In sum, I shall argue that the "sobriety" of the alcoholic
is characterized by an unusually disastrous variant of the
Cartesian dualism, the division between Mind and Matter,
or, in this case, between conscious will, or "self," and the
remainder of the personality. Bill W.'s stroke of genius was
to break up with the first "step" the structuring of this
dualism.
I
Philosophically viewed, this first step is nat a surrender; it
is simply a change in epistemology, a change in how to
know about the personality-in-the-world. And, notably, the
change is-from an incorrect to a m~re correct epistemology.
Epistemology and Ontology
Philosophers have recognized and separated two sorts of
problem. There are first the problems of how things are,
what is a person, and what sort of a world this is. These are
the problems of ontology. Second, there are the problems
of how we know anything, or more specifically, how we
know what sort of a world it is'and what sort of creatures
we are that can know something (or perhaps nothing) of
this matter. These are the problems of epistemology. To

The Epistemology of Cybernetics
What is new and surprising is that we now have partial
answers to some of these questions. In the last twenty-five
years extraordinary advances have been made in our knowl-
edge of what sort of thing the environment is, what sort
of thing an organism is, and, especially, what sort of thing a
mind is. These advances have come out of cybernetics,
systems theory, information theory, and related sciences.
We now know, with considerable certainty, that the an-
cient problem of whether the mind is immanent or tran-
scendent can be answered in favor of immanence, and that
this answer is more economieal of explanatory entities than
any transcendent answer: it has at least the negative sup-
port of Occam's Razor.
On the positive
side~ we can assert that any ongoing
ensemble of events and objects which has the, appropriate
complexity of causal circuits and the appropriate energy re-
lationS will surely show mental characteristics. It will com-
pare, that is, be responsive to difference
(in addition to
being affected by the ordinary physical "causes" such as
impact or force). It will "process information" and will in-
evitably be self-corrective either toward homeostatic op-
tima or toward the maximization of certain variables.
A "bit" of information is definable as a difference which
makes a difference. Such a' difference, as it travels and un-
dergoes successive transformation in a circuit, is an elemen-
tary idea.
But, most relevant in the present context, we know that
no part of such an internally interactive system can have
unilateral control over the remaiDder or over any other part.
The mental characteristics are inherent or immanent in the
ememble as a whole.
Even in very simple self-corrective systems, this holistic
character is evident. In the steam engine with a "governor,"

I am concerned especially with that group of premises
upon which Occidental concepts of the "seH" are built, and
conversely, with premises which are corrective to some of
the more gross Occidental errors associated with that con-
cept.

these questions, both ontological and epistemological, philos-
ophers try to find true answers.
But the naturalist, observing hwnan behavior, will ask
rather different questions. If he be a cultural relativist, he
may agree with those philosophers who hold that a "true"
ontology is conceivable, but he will not ask. whether the
ontology of the people he observes is '''true.'' He will expect
their epistemology to be culturally determined· or even idio-
syncratic, and he will expect the culture as a whole to make
sense in terms of their particular epistemology and ontology.
If, on the other hand, it is clear that the local epistemology
is wrong, then the naturalist should be alert to the possibility
that the culture as a whole will never really make "sense," or
will make sense only under restricted
cirewn~tances, which
contact with other cultureS and new technologies might dis-
rupt.
In the natural history of the living hwnan being, ontology
and epistemology cannot be separated. His (commonly un-
conscious) beliefs about what sort of world it is will de-'
termine how he sees it and acts within it, and his ways of
perceiving and acting will determine his beliefs about its
nature. The living man is thus bound within a net of episte-
mological and ontolOgical premises which-regardless of ulti- .
mate truth or falsity-become partially self-validating for
him.oi
It is awkward to refer constantly to both epistemology and
ontology and incorrect to suggest that they are separable in
,j.
hwnan natural history. There seems to be no convenient
word to cover the combination of these two concepts. The
nearest approximations are "cognitive structure" or "char-
acter structure," but these terms fail to suggest that what is
important is a body of habitual asswnptions or premises
implicit in the relationship betWeen man and environment,
and that these premises may be true or false. I shall there-
fore use the single term "epistemology" in this essay to
cover both aspects of the net of premises which govern
adaptation (or maladaptation) to the hwnan and physical
environment. In George Kelly's vocabulary, these are the
rules by which an individual "construes"his experience.

the very word "governor" is a misnomer if it be taken to
mean that this part of the system has unilateral control. The
governor is, essentially, a sense organ or transducer which
receives a transform of the difference between the actual
running speed of the engine and some ideal or preferred
speed. This sense organ transforms these diHere.nces into
differences in some efferent message, for example, to fuel
supply or to a brake. The behavior of the governor is de-
termined, in other words, by the behavior of the other parts
of the system, and indirectly by its own behavior at a pre-
..
vious time.
The holistic and mental character of the system is most
clearly demonstrated by this last fact, that the behavior of
the governor (and, indeed, of every part of the causal cir-
cuit) is partially determined by its own previous behavior.
Message material (i.e., successive transforms of diHerence)
must pass around the total circuit, and the time required
for the message material to return to the place from which
it started is a basic characteristic of the total system. The
behavior of the governor (or any other part Qf the circuit) is
thus in some degree determined not only by its immediate
past, but by what it did at a time which precedes the pres-
ent by the interval necessary for the message to complete
the circuit. There is thus a sort of determinative memory in
even the simplest cybernetic circuit.
The stability of the system (i.e., whether it will act self-
correctively or oscillate or go into runaway) depends upon
the relation between the operational product of all the
transformations of diHerence around the circuit and upon
this characteristic time. The "governor" has no control over
these factors. Even a human governor in a social system is
bound by the same limitations. He is controlled by infor-
mation from the system and must adapt his own actions to
its time characteristics and to the effects of his own past
action.
,
Thus, in no system which shows mental characteristics can
-;
any part have unilateral control over the whole. In other
words, the mental characteristics of the system are imma-
nent, not in some part, but in the system as a whole.
The significance of this conclusion appears when we ask,
"Can a computer think?" or, "Is the mind in the brain?"
And the answer to both questions will be negative unless the
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
317
question is focused upon one of the few mental character-
istics which are contained within the computer or the brain.
A computer is self-corrective in regard to some of its in-
ternal variables. It may, for example, include thermometers
or other sense organs which are affected by diHerences in
its working temperature, and the response of the sense or-
gan to these diHerences may affect the action of a fan
which in tum corrects the temperature. We may therefore
say that the system shows mental characteristics in regard
to its internal temperature. But it would be incorrect to say
that the main business of the computer-the transformation
of input differences into output diHerences-is "a mental
process." The computer is only an arc of a larger circuit
which always includes a man and an environment from which
information is received and upon which efferent messages
from the computer have effect. This total system, or en-
semble, may legitimately be said to show mental character-
istics. It operates by trial and error and has creative char-
acter.
Similarly, we may say that "mind" is immanent in those
circuits of the brain which are complefe within the brain.
Or that mind is immanent in circuits which are complete
within the system, brain plus body. Or, finally, that mind is
immanent in the larger system-man plus environment.
In principle, if we desire to explain or understand the
mental aspect of any biological event, we must take into
account the system-that is, the network of closed circuits,
within which that biolOgical event is determined. But when
we seek to explain the behavior of a man or any other
organism, this "system" will usually not have the same limits
as the "self"-as this term is commonly (and variously) un-
derstood.
Consider a man felling a tree with an axe. Each stroke· of
the axe is modified or corrected, according to the shape of
the cut face of the tree left by the previous stroke. This self-
corrective (i.e., mental) process is brought about by a total
system, tree-eyes-brain-muscles-axe-stroke-tree; and it is this
total system that has the characteristics of immanent mind.
More correctly, we shoUld spell the matter out as: (dif-
ferences
in
tree) -(differences
in
retina) - (differences
in
brain) -(diHerences in muscles) -(differences in movement of
axe)-(differences in tree), etc. What is transmitted around

the circuit is transforms of differences. And, as noted above,
/a difference which makes a difference is an idea or unit of
information.
But this is not how the average Occidental sees the event
sequence of tree feIling. He ~ays, "1.c~t down the tree:: an~
he even believes that there IS a delimIted agent, the
self,
which performed a delimited "purposive" action upon a de-
limited object.
It is all very well to say that "Billiard ball A hit billiard ball
B and sent it into the pocket"; and it would perhaps be all
right (if we could do it) to give a complete hard-science
account of the events all around the circuit contajning the
man and the tree. But popular parlance includes mind in its
utterance by invoking
the
personal pronoun,
and
then
achieves a mixture of mentalism and physicalism by re-
stricting mind within the man and reifying the tree. Finally
the mind itself becomes reified by the notion that, since the
"self" acted upon the axe which acted upon the tree, the
"self" must also be a "thing." The parallelism of syntax be-
tween "1 hit the billiard ball" and "The ball hit another ball"
is totally misleading.
,
If you ask anybody about the localization and boundaries
of the self, these confusions are immediately displayed..Or
consider a blind man with a stick. Where does the blind
man's self begin? At the tip of the stick? At the handle of
the stick? Or at some point halfway up the stick? These
questions are nonsense, because the stick is a pathway al?ng
which
differences
are
transmitted
under
transformation,
so that to draw a delimiting line across this patp.way is to
cut off a part of the systemic circuit which determines the
blind man's locomotion.
Similarly, his sense organs are transducers or pathways
for information, as also are his axons, etc. From a systems-
theoretic point of view, it is a misleading metaphor to say
that what travels in an aXon is, an "impulse." It would be
more correct to say that what travels is a difference, or a
transform of a difference. The metaphor of "impulse" sug-
gests a hard-science line of thought which will ramify only
too easily into nonsense about "psychic energy," and those
who talk this kind of nonsense will disregard the informa-
tion content of quiescence. The quiescence of an axon dif-
fers as much from activity ,as its activity does from quifls-
Steps to' an Ecology of Mind
319
cence. Therefore quiescence and activity have equal infor-
mational relevance. The message of activity can, only be
accepted as valid if the message of quiescence can also be
trusted.
It is even incorrect to speak of the "message of activity"
and the "message of quiescence." Always the fact that in-
formation is a transform of difference should be remem-
bered, and we might better call the one message "activity
-not quiescence" and the other "quiescence-not activity."
Similar considerations apply to the repentant alcoholic. He
cannot simply elect "sobriety." At best he could only elect
"sobriety-not drunkenness," and his universe remains polar-
ized,carrying always both alternatives.
The total self-corrective unit which processes information,
or, as I say, "thinks" and "acts" and "decides," is a system
whose boundaries do not at all coincide with the boun-
daries either of the body or of what is popularly called the
"self" or "consciousness"; and it is important to notice that
there are multiple differences between the thinking system
and the "self" as popularly conceived:
(1) The system is not a transcendent entity as the "self"
is commonly supposed to be.
(2) The ideas are immanent in a network of causal path-
ways along which transforms of difference are conducted.
The "ideas" of the system are in all cases at least binary in
structure. They are not '''impulses'' but "information."
(3) This network of pathways is not bounded with con-
sciousness but extends to include the pathways of all un-
conscious mentation-both autonomic and repressed, neural
and hormonal.
(4) The network is not bounded by the skin but includes
all external pathways along which information can travel. It
also includes those effective differences which are immanent
in the "objects" of such information. It includes the path-
ways of sound and light along which travel transforms of
differences originally immanent in things and other people
-and especially in. our own actions.
It is important to note that the basic-and I believe er-
roneous-tenets of popular epistemology are mutually rein-
forcing. If, for example, the popular premise of transcen-
dence is discarded, the immediate substitute is a premise of
immanence in the body. But this alternative will be unac-

ceptable because large parts of the thinking network are lo-
cated outside the body. The so-called "Body-Mind" prob-
lem is wrongly posed in terms which force the argument
toward paradox: if mind be supposed immanent in the body,
then it must be transcendent. If transcendent, it must be
immanent. And so on.Ii
Similarly, if we exclude the unconscious processes from
the "self" and call them "ego-alien," then these processes
take on the subjective coloring of "urges" and "forces"; and
this pseudodynamic quality is then extended to the con-
scious "self" which attempts to "resist" the "forces" of the
unconscious. The
(~self" thereby becomes itself an organiza-
tion of seeming "forces:' The popular notion which would
equate "self" with consciousness thus leads into the notion
that ideas are "forces"; and this fallacy is in turn supported
by saying that the axon carries "impulses:' To find a way out
of this mess is by no means easy.
We shall proceed by first examining the structure of ~e
alcoholic's polarization. In the epistemologically unsound res-
olution, "I will fight the bottle," what is supposedly lined 'up
against what?
Alcoholic "Pride"
Alcoholics are philosophers in that universal sense in which
all human beings (and all mammals) are guided by highly
abstract principles of which they are either quite uncon-
scious, or unaware that the principle governing th(;lir percep-
tion and action is philosophic. A common misnomer for such
principles is "feelings:'6
This misnomer
arises
naturally from
the Anglo-Saxon
epistemological tendency to reify or attribute to the body all
mental phenomena which are peripheral to consciousness.
. And the misnomer is, no doubt, supported by the fact that
the exercise and/or frustration of these principles is often
accompanied by visceral and other bodily sensations. I be-

321
lieve, however, that Pascal was correct when he said, "The
heart has its reasons which the reason does not at all per-
ceive."
But the reader must not expect the alcoholic to present
a consistent picture. When the underlying epistemology is
full of error, derivations from it 'are inevitably either self-
contradictory or extremely resbicted in scope. A consistent
corpus of theorems cannot be derived from an inconsistent
body of axioms. In such cases, the attempt to be consistent
leads either to the great proliferation of complexity charac-
teristic of psychoanalytic theory and Christian theology or
to the extremely narrow view characteristic of contempor-
ary behaviorism.
I shall therefore proceed to examine the "pride" which is
characteristic of alcoholics to show that this principle of their
behavior is derived from the strange dualistic epistemology
characteristic of Occidental civilization.
A convenient way of describing such principles as "pride,"
"dependency," "fatalism," and so forth, is to examine the
prinCiple as if it were a result of deutero-Iearning7 and to ask
what contexts of learning might understandably inculcate this
principle.
.
(l) It is clear that the prinCiple of alcoholic life which AA
calls "pride" is not contextually structured
around
past
achievement. They do not use the wQrd to mean pride in
something accomplished. The emphasis is not upon "I suc-
ceeded," but rather upon "I can... :' It is. an obsessive
acceptance of a challenge, a repudiation of the proposition
"I cannot:'
9 This use of formal contextual structure as a descrip-
tive device does not necessarily assume that the principle
discussed is wholly or in part actually learned in contexts
having the appropriate formal structure. The principle
could have been genetically determined, and it might still
follow that the principiI:' is best described by the formal
delineation of the contexts in which it is exemplified. It
is precisely this fitting of behavior to context that makes it
difficult or impossible to determine whether a principle of
behavior Was genetically determined. or learned in that
context; see G. Bateson, "Social Planning and the Con-
cept
of
Deutero-Learning,"
Conference
on
Science,
Philosophy a"d Religion, Second Symposium, New York,
Harper, 1942.

The so-called pride of the alcoholic always presumes a real
or fictitious "other," and its complete contextual definition
therefore demands that we characterize the real or imagined
relationship to this "other."
A first step in this task is to
classify the relationship as either "symmetrical" or "comple-
mentary."9 To do this is not entirely simple when the
"other" is a creation of the unconscious, but we shall see that
the indications for such a classification are clear.
An explanatory digression is, however, necessary. The pri-
mary criterion is simple:
If, in a binary relationship, the behaviors of A and B are
regarded (by A and B) as similar and are linked so that more
of the given behavior by A stimulates more of it in B, and
vice versa, then the relationship is "symmetrical" in regard to
these behaviors.
If, conversely, the behaviors of A and B are dissimilar but
mutually fit together (as, for example, spectatorship fits ex-
hibitionism), and the behaviors are linked so that more of
A's behavior stimulates more of B's fitting behavior, then
the relationship is "complementary" in regard to these be-
haviors.
Common examples of simple symmetrical relationship are
armaments races, keeping up with the Joneses, athletic emu-
lation, boxing matches, and the like. Common examples of
complementary relationship are dominance-submission, sa-
dism-masochism,
nurturance-dependency,
spectatorship-ex-
hibitionism, and the like.
More complex considerations arise when higher logical
typing is present. For example: A and B may compete in
gift-giving, thus superposing a larger symmetrical frame upon
primarily complementary behaviors. Or, conversely, a thera-
pist might engage in competition with a patient in some sort
of play therapy, placing· a complementary nurturant frame
around the primarily symmetrical transactions of the game.
Various sorts of "double binds" are generated when A and
B perceive the premises of their relationship in different

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
(2) After the alcoholic has begun to suffer from-or be
blamed for-alcoholism, this principle of "pride" is mobilized
behind the proposition, "I can stay sober." But, noticeably,
success in this achievement destroys the "challenge."
The
alcoholic becomes "cocksure,"
as AA says. He relaxes his
determination, risks a drink, and finds himself on a binge.
We may say that the contextual structure of sobriety changes
with its achievement. Sobriety, at this point, is no longer the
appropriate contextual setting for "pride." It is the risk of the
.1
drink that now is challenging and calls out the fatal "I
"
can....
(3) AA does its best to insist that this change in con-
textual structure shall never occur. They restructure the
whole context by asserting over and over again that "Once an
alcoholic, always an alcoholic." They try to have the alcoholic
place alcoholism within the self, much as a Jungian analyst
tries to have the patient discover his "psychological type"
and to learn to live with the strengths and weaknesses of
that type. In contrast, the contextual structure of alcoholic
"pride" places the alcoholism outside the self: "I can resist
drinking."
(4) The
challenge component of alcoholic "pride" is
linked with risk-taking. The principle might be put in words:
"I can do something where success is improbable and failure
would be disastrous." Clearly this principle will never serve
to maintain continued sobriety. As success begins to appear
probable, the alcoholic must challenge the risk of a drink.
The element of "bad luck" or "probability" of failure places
failure beyond the limits of the self. "If failure occurs, it is
not mine." Alcoholic "pride" progressively narrows the con-
cept of "self," placing what happens outside its scope.
(5) The principle of pride-in-risk is ultimately ahnost sui-
cidal. It is all very well to test once whether the universe is
on your side, but to do so again and again, with increasing
stringency of proof, is to set out on a project which can only
prove that the universe hates you. But, stilI and all, the AA
narratives show repeatedly that, at the very bottom of de-
spair, pride sometimes prevents suicide. The final quietus
must not be delivered by the "self."8

tenns-A may r~gard B's behavior as competitive when B
thought he was helping A. And so on.
With these complexities we are not here concerned, be-
cause the imaginary "other" or counterpart in the "plide"
of the alcoholic does not, I believe, play the complex games
which are characteristic of the "voices" of schizophrenics.
Both complementary and symmetrical relationships are
liable to progressive changes of the sort which I have called
"schismogenesis,''lO Symmetrical struggles
and armaments
races may, in the current phrase, "escalate"; and the nc;>nnal
pattern of succoring-dependency between parent and ,phi1d
may
become
monstrous.
These
potentially
pathological
developments are due to 1llldamped or 1lllcorrected positive
feedback in the system, and may-as stated--occur in either
complementary or symmetrical systems. However, in mixed
systems schismogenesis is necessarily reduced. The aima-
ments race between two nations will be slowed down by
acceptance of complementary themes such as dominance, de-
pendency, admiration, and so forth, between them. It will
be speeded up by the repudiation ofthese themes. '
This antithetical relationship between complementary and
symmetrical themes is, no doubt, due to the fact that each is
the logical opposite of the other. In a merely symmetrical
annaments race, nation A is motivated to greater efforts by
its estimate of the greater strength of B. When it estimates
that B is weaker, nation A will relax its efforts. But the exact
opposite will happen if A's structuring of the relationship is
complementary. Observing that B is weaker than they, A will
go ahead with hopes of conquest.ll

patterns may be more than Simply logical.

tion, retention, and the like--all of these are classed as
"libidinal,"
Whereas rivalry, competition, and the like fall
under the rubric of "ego" and "defense."
It is also pOSSible that the two antithetical codes-sym-
metrical and complementary-may be physiologically repre-
sented by contrasting states of the central nervous system.
The progressive changes of schismogenesis may reach cli-
mactic discontinuities and sudden reversals. Symmetrical rage
may suddenly 'turn to- grief; the retreating animal with tail
between his legs may suddenly "turn at bay" in a desperate
battle of symmetry to the, death. The bully may suddenly
become the coward when he is challenged, and the wolf who
is beaten in a symmetrical conflict may suddenly give "sur-
render" signals which prevent further attack.
The last example is of specia:l interest. If the struggle be-
tween the wolves is symmetrical-that is, if wolf A is stimu-
lated to more aggressive behavior by the aggressive be-
havior of B-then if B suddenly exhibits what we may
call "negative aggression," A will not be able to continue to
fight unless he can quickly switch over to that complemen-
tary state of mind in which B's weakness would be a stimulus
for his aggression. Within the hypothesis of symmetrical and
complemetary modes, it becomes unnecessary to postulate
a specifically "inhibitory" effect for the surrender Signal.
Human beings who possess language can apply the label
"aggreSSion" to all attempts to damage the other, regardless
of whether the attempt is pro1I1pted by the other's strength
or weakness; but at the prelinguistic mammalian level these
two sorts of "aggression" must appear totally different. We
are told that from the lion's point' of view, an "attack" on a
zebra is totally different from an "attack" on another lion.1s
Enough has now been said so that the question can be
posed: Is alcoholic pride contextually structured in symmet-
rical or complementary fonn?
First, there is a very strong tenqency toward symmetry in
the nonnal drinking habits of Occidental culture. Quite apart
from addictive alcoholism, two men drinking together are
impelled by convention to match each other, drink for drink.
At this stage, the "other" is still real and the symmetry, or
rivalry, between the pair is friendly.

As the alcoholic becomes addicted and tries to resist drink-
ing, he begins to find it difficult to resist the social context in
which he should match his friends in their drinking. The
AA says, "Heaven knows, we have tried hard enough and
long enough to drink like other peoplel"
As things get worse, the alcoholic' is likely to become a
solitary drinker and. to exhibit the whole spectrum of re-
sponse .to challenge. His wife and friends begin to suggest
that his drinking is a weakness, and he may respond, with
symmetry, both by resenting them and by asserting· his
strength to resist the bottle. But, as is characteristic ofsym-
metrical
responses~ a brief period of successful struggle
weakens his motivation and he falls off the wagon. Sym- .
metrical effort requires continual opposition from the oppo-
nent.
Gradually the focus of the battle changes, and the alco-
holic finds himself committed to a new and more deadly
type of symmetrical conflict. He must now prove that the
bottle cannot kill him. His "head is bloody but unbowed."
He is still the "captain of his soul"-for what it's worth.
Meanwhile, his relationships with wife
and boss
and
friends have been deteriorating. He· never did like the
complementary status of his boss as an authority; and now as
he deteriorates his wife is more and more forced to take a
complementary role. She may try to exert authority, or she
becomes protective, or she shows forbearance, but all those
provoke either rage or shame. His symmetrical "pride" can
tolerate no complementary role.
In sum, the relationship between the alcoholic and his
real or fictitious "other" is clearly symmetrical and clearly
schismogenic. It escalates. We shall see that the religious
conversion of the alcoholic when saved by AA can be de-
scribed as a dramatic shift from this symmetrical habit, or
epistemology, to an almost purely complementary view of
his relationship to others and to the universe or God.
Pride or Inverted Proof?

ble. These levels of the mind are prelinguistic and the
computation which goes on there is coded in primary pro-
cess.
Both in dream' and in mammalian interaction, the only
way to achieve a proposition which contains its own negation
("I will not bite you," or "I am not afraid of him") is by
an elaborate imagining or acting out of the proposition to be
negated, leading to a reductio ad absurdum. "I will not bite
you" is achieved between two mammals by an experimental
combat
which
is
a
"not
combat,"
sometimes
called
"play;" It is for this reason that "agonistic" behavior common-
ly evolves into friendly greeting.14
In this sense, the so-called pride of the alcoholic is in
some degree ironic. It is a determined effort to test some-
thing like "self-control" with an ulterior but unstateable pur-
pose of proving that "self-control" is ineffectual and absurd.
"It simply won't work." This ultimate proposition, since it
contains a simple negation, is not to be expressed in pri-
mary process. Its final expression is in an action-the taking
of a drink. The heroic battle with the bottle, that fictitious
"other," ends up in a "kiss and make friends."
In favor of this hypothesis, there is the undoubted fact
that the testing of self-control leads back into drinking. And,
as I have argued above, the whole epistemology of self-
control which his friends urge upon the alcoholic is mon-
strous. If this be so, then the alcoholic is right in rejecting
it. He has achieved a reductio ad absurdum of the conven-
tional epistemology.
But this description of achieving a reductio ad absurdum
verges upon teleology. If the proposition "It won't work" can-
not be entertained within the coding of primary process,
how then' can the computations of primary process direct
the organism to try out those courses of action which will
demonstrate that "It won't work"?
Problems of this general type
a~e frequent in psychiatry
and can perhaps only be resolved by a model in which,
under certain circumstances, the organism's discomfort acti-
vates a positive feedback loop to increase the behavior
which preceded the discomfort. Such positive feedback would

pro;ide a .verification that it was really that particular be-

change would become possible.
In psych?therapy such a positive feedback loop is com-
monl~ pr~vIded by the therapist who pushes the patient in
the direction of hIS symptoms-a technique which has been
called the "therapeutic double bind." An example of this
technique is quoted later in this essay, where the AA member

It is also usual that the symptoms and hallucinations of
the schizophrenie---'-like dreams-constitute a corrective ex-
perience, so that the whole schizophrenic episode takes on
the character of a self-initiation. Barbara O'Brien's account
of.her own psychosisI5 is perhaps the most striking example of
this phenomenon, which has been discussed elsewhere.16

common human trait. It is perhaps what Freud called the
"death instinct."

fortable state-he can get drunk. Or, "at least," have a drink.
With this complementary surrender, which the alcoholic
will often. see as an act· of spite-a Parthian dart in a
symmetrical struggle-his entire epistemology changes. His
anxieties and resenbnents and panic vanish as if by magic.
His self-control is lessened, but his need to compare himself
with others is reduced even further. He feels the phYSiological
warmth of -alcohol in his veins and, in many cases, a cor-
responding psychological warmth toward others. He may be
eith~r maudlin or angry, but he has at least become again
a pait of the human scene. .
Direct data bearing upon the thesis that the step from
sobriety into intoxication is also a step from symmetrical chal-
lenge into complementarity are scarce, and always confused
both by the distortions of recall and by the complex toxicity
of the -alcohol. But there is strong evidence from song and
story to indicate that the step is of this kind. In ritual,
partaking of wine has always stood for the social aggregation
of persons united in religious "communion" or secular Gemut-
lichkeit. In a very literal sense, alcohol supposedly makes the
individual see himself as and act as a part of the group.
That is, it enables complementarity in the relationships which
surround him.
Hitting Bottom
AA attaches great importance to this phenomenon and
regards the alcoholic who has not hit bottom as a poor
prospect for their help. Conversely, they are inclined to
explain their failure by saying that the individual who goes
back to his alcoholism has not yet "hit bottom."
Certainly many sorts of disaster may cause an alcoholic
to hit bottom. Various sorts of accidents, an attack of delirium
tremens, a patch of drunken time of which he has no
memory, rejection by wife, loss of job, hopeless diagnosis,
and so on-any of these may have the required effect. AA
says that "bottom" is different for different men and some
may be dead before they reach it,17
It is pOSSible, however, that "bottom" is reached many

times by any given individual; that "bottom" is a spell of
panic which provides a favorable moment for ch.ange, but
not a moment at which change is inevitable.
Fn~nds and
relatives and even therapists may pull the alcoholic

hit a more disastrous "bottom" at some later time, when he
will again be ripe for a change. The attempt to chang~ th.e
alcoholic in a period between such moments of pamc
IS
unlikely to succeed.
,
The nature of the panic is made clear by· the folloWing
description of a "test."
We do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic,
but you can .quickly diagnose yourself. Step over to the
nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try
to drink and stop abruptly. Try it more than once. It
will not take long for you to decide, if you are. honest
with yourself about it. It may be worth a bad case of
d··
18
jitters if you get a full knowledge of your con 1tlon.
We might compare the test quoted above to commanding
a driver to brake suddenly when traveling on a slippery
road: he will discover fast that his control is limited..(The
metaphor "skid row" for the alcoholic section of town 1S not
inappropriate.)

Suddenly, pressure on what he knows is th~ brake. seems. to
make the vehicle go faster. It is the pamc of
discovem~g
that it (the system, self plus vehicle) is bigger than he IS.
mterms of the theory here presented, we may say that
hitting bottom exemplifies systems theory at three levels:.
(1) The alcoholic works on the discomforts of sob.nety to
a threshold point at which he has bankrupted the ep1stemol-
ogy of "self-control" He then gets drunk-because the "sys-
tem" is bigger than he is-and he may as well surrender
to it.
(2) He works repeatedly at getting drunk until he proves
:IS Alcoholics Anonymous, {}p.
cit., p. 43.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
331
that there is a still larger system. He then encounters the
panic of "hitting bottom."
(3) If friends and therapists reassure him, he may achieve
a further unstable adjustment-becoming addicted to their
help-until he demonstrates that this system won't work, and
"hits bottom" again but at a lower level. In this, as in all
cybernetic systems, the sign (plus or minus) of the effect of
any intrusion upon the system depends upon timing..
(4) Lastly, the phenomenon of hitting bottom is complexly
related to the experience of double bind.10 Bill W. narrates
that/he hit bottom'when diagnosed as a hopeless alcoholic
by Dr. William D. Silkworth in 1939, and this event is re-
garded as the beginning of AA history.2o Dr. Silkworth also
."supplied us with the tools with which to puncture the
toughest alcoholic ego, those shattering phrases by which he
described our illness: the obsession of the mind that compels
us to drink and the allergy of the body that condemns us
to go mad or die."21 This is a double bind 'correctly founded
upon the alcoholic's dichotomous epistemology of mind ver-
sus body. He is forced by these words back and back to the
point at which only an involuntary change in deep un-
conscious epistemology-a spiritual experience-will make
the lethal description irrelevant.
The Theology of Alcoholics Anonymous
Some outstanding points of the theology of AA are:
(1) There is a Power greater than the self. Cybernetics
would go somewhat further and recognize that the "self" as
ordinarily understood is only a small part of a much larger
trial-and-error system which does the thinking, acting, and
deciding. This system includes all the informational path-
ways which are relevant at any given moment to any given
decision. The "self" is a false reification of an improperly de-
limited part of this much larger field of interlocking pro-
cesses. Cybernetics also recognizes that two or more persons

phrenia," Behavioral Science, 1956, 1: 251-64.
00 AA Comes of Age, op. cit., p. vii.
n Ibid., p. 13. (Italics in the original)

332
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
-any group of persons-may together form such a thinking-
and-acting system.
(2) This Power is felt to be personal and to be intimately
linked with each person. It is "God as you understand him
to be."
Cybernetically speaking, "my" relation to any larger system
around me and including other things and persons will be
different from "your" relation to some similar system around
you. The relation "part of" must necessarily and logically al-
ways be complementary but the meaning of the phrase "part
of' will be different for every person.22 This difference; will
be especially important in systems containing more than one
person. The system or "power" must necessarily appear dif-
ferent from where each person sits. Moreover, it is expect-
a~le that such systems, when they encounter each other,
wIll recognize each other as systems in this sense. The
"beauty" of the woods through which I walk is my recogni-
tion both of the individual trees and of the total ecology
of the woods as systems. A similar esthetic recognition is
__3till more striking when I talk with another person.
(3) A favorable relationship with this Power is discovered
through "hitting bottom" and "surrender."
(4) By resisting this Power, men and especially alcoholics
bring disaster upon themselves. The materialistic philosophy
which sees "man" as pitted against his environment is rapidly
breaking down as technological man becomes more and more
able to oppose the largest systems. Every battle that' he
wins brings a threat of disaster. The unit of survival-either
in ethics or in evolution-is not the organism or t)1e species
but the largest system or "power" within which the creature
lives. If the creature destroys its environment, it destroys it-
self.
(5) But-and this is important-the Power does not re-
ward and punish. It does not have "power" in that sense.
In the biblical phrase, "All things work together for good to
them that love God," And, conversely, to them that do not.
The idea of power in the sense of unilateral control is
foreign to AA. Their organization is strictly "democratic"
(their word), and even their deity is still bound by what
.. This diversity in styles of integration could account
for the fact that some persons become alcoholic while
others do not.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
333
we might call a systemic determinism. The same limitation
applies both to the relationship between the AA sponsor and
the drunk whom he hopes to help and to the relationship
between AA central office and every local group.
(6) The first two "steps" of Alcoholics Anonymous taken
together identify the addiction as a manifestation of this
Power.
(7) The healthy relation between each person and this
Power is complementary. It is in precise contrast to the
"pride" of the alcoholic, which is predicated upon a sym-
me~ical relationship to an imagined "other," The schismo-
genesis is always more powerful than the participants in it.
(8) The quality and content of each person's relation to
the Power is indicated or reflected in the social structure of
AA. The secular aspect of this system-its governance-
is delineated in "Twelve Traditions"23 which supplement the
"Twelve Steps," the latter developing man's r,elationship to
the Power. The two documents overlap in the Twelfth Step,
which enjoins aid to other alcoholics as a necessary spiritual
exercise without which the member is likely to relapse. The
total system is a Durkheimian religion in the sense that the
rela~onship between man and his community parallels the
relationship between man and God. "AA is a power greater
than any of US,"24
In sum, the relationship of each individual to the "Power"
is best defined in the words is part at,"
(9) Anonymity. It must be understood that anonymity
means much more in AA thinking and theology than the
mere protection of members from exposure and shame. With
~creasingfame and success of the organization as a whole,
It has become a temptation for members to use the. fact
of ~eir membership as a positive asset in public relations,
politics, education, and many other fields. Bill W., the co-
fo~der. of the organization, was himself caught by this temp-
tation m early days and has discussed the matter in a
pub~hed articIe.25 He sees first that any grabbing of the
spotlight must be a -personal and spiritual danger to the
member, who cannot affort such self-seeking; and beyond

this that it would be fatal for the organization as a whole to
become involved in politics, religious controversy, and social
reform. He states clearly that the errors of the alcoholic are
the same as the "forces which are today ripping the world
apart at its seams," but that it is not the business of AA to
save the world. Their single purpose is "to carry the AA
message to the sick alcoholic who wants it."26 He concludes
that anonymity is "the greatest symbol of self-sacrifice that
we know." Elsewhere the twelfth of the "Twelve Tradi-
tions" states that "anonymity is the spiritual foundation. of
our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before
personalities."
.
To this we may add that anonymity is also a profound
statement of the systemic relation, part-to-whole. Some sys-
tems theorists would go even further,
because a major
temptation for systems theory lies in the reification of theoret-
ical concepts. Anatol Holt says he wants a bumper sticker
which would (paradoxically) say, "Stamp out nouns."27
(10) Prayer. The AA use of prayer similarly affirms the
complementarity of part-whole relationship by the very sim-
ple technique of asking for that relationship. They ask for
those personal characteristics, such as humility, which are in
fact exercised in the very act of prayer. If the act of prayer
be sincere (which is not so easy), God cannot but grant
the request. And this is peculiarly true of "God, as you
understand him." This self-affirming tautology, which con-
tains its own beauty, is precisely the balm required after the
anguish of the double binds which went with hitting bottom.
Somewhat more complex is the famous "Serenity Prayer":
"God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot
change, courage to change the things we can, and wisdom
to know the difference."28
If double binds cause anguish and despair and destroy

to the conclusion of despair, "There are no alternatives."
In this connection it is worth mentioning that the great
schizophreniC,
John PercevaL
observed. a change in his
"voices." In the beginning of his psychosis they bullied him
with "contradictory commands" (or as I would say, double
binds), but later he began to recover when they offered
him choice of clearly defined alternatives.29
(11) In one characteristic, AA differs profoundly from
such natural mental systems as the family or .the redwood
forest. It has a single purpose--"to carry the AA message to
the sick. alcoholic who wants it"-and the organization is
dedicated to. the maximization of that purpose. In this re-
spect, AA is no more sophisticated than General Motors or an
Occidental nation. But biological systems, other than those
premised upon Occidental ideas
(and especially money),
are multipurposed. There is no single variable in the red-
wood forest of which we can say that the whole system is.
oriented to maximizing that variable and all other variables
are subsidiary to it; and, indeed, the redwood forest works
toward optima, not maxima. Its needs are satiable, and too
much of anything is toxic.
There is, however, this: that the single purpose of AA is
directed outward
and
is
aimed at a noncompetitve re-
lationship to the larger world. The variable to be maximized
is a complementarity and is of the nature of "service" rather
than dominance.

Finally, the above analysis is subject to the following
limitations and implications:
.
(1) It is not asserted that all alcoholics operate according
to the logic which is here outlined. It is very possible
that other types of alcoholics exist and almost certain that

cultures

lines.
(2) It is not asserted that the way of Alcoholics Anony-
mous is the only way to live correctly or that their theology
is the only correct derivation from the epistemology of cyber-
netics and systems theory.
(3) It is not asserted that all transactions between human
beings ought to be complementary, though it is clear that
the relation between the indiVidual and the larger system of
which he .is a part must necessarily be so. Relations between
persons.will (I hope) always be complex.
(4) It is, however, asserted that the nonalcoholic world
has many lessons which it might learn from the epistemology
of systems theory and from the ways of AA. If we continue
to operate in terms of a Cartesian dualism of mind versus
matter, we shall probably also continue to see the world in
terms of God versus man; elite versus people; chosen race
versus others; nation versus nation; and man versus environ-
meilt. It is doubtful whether a species. having both an ad-
vanced technology and this strange way of looking at its
world can endure.

these themes as so fundamental that they shall be called
"epistemological," even in a natural history study of cultural
and interpersonal premises.
The answer seems to hang upon what is meant by "funda-
mental" in such a study of man's natural history; and the
word seems to carry two sorts of meaning.
First, I call more fundamental those premises which are
the more deeply embedded in the mind, which are the
more ''hard programmed" and the less susceptible to change.
-
In this sense, the symmetrical pride or hubris of the alcoholic
is fundamental.
':
Second, I shall call more fundamental those premiseS of
mind which refer to' the larger rather than the smaller sys-
tems or gestalten of the universe. The proposition "Grass is
green" is less fundamental than the proposition "Color dif-
ferences make a difference."
But, if we ask about what happens when premises are
changed, it becomes clear that these two definitions of the
"fundamental" overlap to a very great extent. H a man
achieves or suffers change in premises which are deeply
embedded in his mind, 'he will surely find that the results of
that change will ramify throughout his whole universe. Such
changes we may well call "epistemological."
The question then remains regarding what is
episte-
mologically "right" and what is epistemologically "wrong." Is
the change from alcoholic symmetrical "pride" to the AA
species of complementarity a correction of his epistemology?
And is complementarity always somehow better than sym-
metry?
.
For the AA member, it may well be true that- comple-
mentarity is always to be preferred t!> symmetry and that
even the trivial rivalry of a game of tennis or chess may be
dangerous.
The
superficial
episode
may
touch
off
the
deeply embedded symmetrical premise. But this does not
mean that tennis and chess propose epistemological error for
everybody.
The ethical and philosophic problem really concerns only
the widest universe and the deepest psychological levels. If,
we deeply and even unconsciously believe that our relation
to the largest system which concerns us-the "Power greater
than self"-is symmetrical and emulative, then we are in
error.

Limitations of the Hypothesis

Comment on Part III
In the essays collected in Part III, I speak of an action or
utterance as occurring "in" a context, and this conventional
way of talking suggests that the particular action is a "depen-
dent" variable,
while
the
context is
the
"independent"
or detennining variable. But this view of how an action is
related to its context is likely to distract the reader-as it
has distracted me--from perceiving the ecology of the ideas
which together constitute the small subsystem which 1 call
"context."
This heuristic error-copied like so many others from the
ways of thought of the physicist and chemist-requires cOr-
rection.
It is important to see the particular utterance or action as
part of the ecolOgical subsystem called context and not as .
the product or effect of what remains of the context after
the piece which we want to explain has been cut out from
it.
The mistake in question is the same fonnal error as that
mentioned in the comment on Part II where I discuss the
evolution of the horse. We should not think of this process
just as a set of changes in the animal's adaptation to life on
the grassy plains but as a constancy in the relationship be-
tween animals and environment. It is the ecology which sur-
vives and slowly evolves. In this evolution, the relata-the
animals and the grass-undergo changes which are indeed
adaptive from moment to moment. But if the process of
adaptation were the whole story, there could be no systemic
338
",,
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
339
pathology. Trouble arises precisely because the "logic" of
adaptation is a different "logic" from that of the survival and
evolution of the ecological system.
In
Warren
Brodey's
phrase,
the
"time-grain"
of
the
adaptation is different from that of the ecology.
"Survival"
means
that
certain
deSCriptive
statements
about some living system continue to be true through some
period of time; and, conversely, "evolution" refers to changes
in the truth of certain descriptive statements about some
living system.
The
trick is
to
define which
statements
about which systems remain true or undergo change.
The paradoxes (and the pathologies)
of systemic pro-
cess arise precisely because the constancy and survival of
some larger system is maintained by changes in the constitu-
ent subsystems.
.-
The relative constancy-the survival-of the relationship
between animals and grass is maintained by changes in both
relata. But any adaptive change in either of the relata, if
uncorrected by some change in the other, will always jeopar-
dize
the
relationship
between
them.
These
arguments
propose a new conceptual frame for the "double bind" hy-
pothesis, a new conceptual frame for thinking about "schizo-
phrenia," and a new way of looking at context and levels of
learning.
In a word, schizophrenia, deutero-learning, and the double
bind cease to be matters of individual psychology and be- I'
come part of the ecology of ideas in systems or "minds"
whose boundaries no longer coincide with· the skins of the
participant individuals.

On Empty-Headedness Amonq Bioloqists and
State Boards of Education*
My father, the geneticist William Bateson, used to read
us passages of.the Bible at breakfast-lest we grow up to be
empty-headed atheists; and so I find it natural to wonder
what broadening of the mind may come from the strange
anti-evolutionary ruling of the State Board of Education in
California.!
Evolution has long been badly taught. In particular, stu-
dents-and even professional biologists-acquire theories of
evolution without any deep understanding of what problem
these theories attempt to solve. They learn but little of the
evolution of evolutionary theory..
The extraordinary achievement of the writers of the first
chapter of Genesis was their perception of the problem:
Where does order come from? They observed.that the land
and the water were, in fact, separate and that species were
separate; they saw that such separation and sorting in the
universe presented a fundamental problem. In modern terms,
we may say that this is the problem implicit in the Second
Law of Thermodynamics: If random events lead to things
getting mixed up, by what nonrandom events did things
come to be sorted? And what is a "random" event?
This problem has been central to biology and to many

of fundamentalism. It was to him inconceivable that God

'could have created a world in which Adam had no navel;
the !trees in the Garden of Eden, no rings of growth; and
the rocks, no strata. Therefore, God must have created the
world as though it had a past.
It will do the student no
harm
to wrestle with the
paradoxes of Gosse's "Law of Prochronism"; if he listens care-
fully to Gosse's groping generalizations about the biolog-
ical world, he will hear an early version of the "steady \
state" hypothesis.
Of course, everybody knows that biological phenomena
are cyclic-from egg, to hen, to egg, to hen, etc. But not all
biologists have examined the implications of this cyclic char-
acteristic for evolutionary and ecological theory. Gosse's,view
of the biological world might broaden their minds.
It is silly and vulgar to approach the rich spectrum of
evolutionary thought with questions only about who was
right and who was wrong. We might as well assert that the
amphibia and reptiles were "wrong" and the mammals and
birds "right" in their solutions to the problems of how to, live.
By fighting the fundamentalists, we are led into an empty-
headedness analogous to theirs. The truth of the matter is
that "Other men have laboured and ye are entered into their
labours" (John 1:38), and this text is not only a reminder of
" the need for humility, it is also an epitome of the vast
evolutionary process into which
WE organisms are willy-nilly

other sciences for the last 5000 years, and the problem
is not trivial.
With what Word should we designate the principle of
order which seems to be immanent in the universe?
The California ruling suggests that students be told of other
attempts to solve this ancient problem. I myself collected one
of these among the Stone Age head-hunters of the Iatmul
tribe in New Guinea. They, too, note that the land and
the water are separate even in their swampy region. They
say that
in
the
beginning
there
was
a
vast
crocodile,
Kavwokmali, who paddled with his front legs and paddled
with his back legs, and thereby kept the mud in suspension.
The culture hero, Kevembuangga, speared the crocodile, who
then ceased to paddle, causing the mud and the water to
separate. The result was dry land upon which Kevembua~gga
stamped his foot in triumph. We might say he venfied;·
that "it was good."
Our students might have their minds broadened somewhat
if they would look at other theories of evolution and consider
',,,,\
how a man's spirit must take a different shape if he believes
that all sorting in the universe is due to an external agent,
or if, like the Iatmul and modern scientists, he sees that the
potentiality for order and pattern is immanent throughout
this world.
And then the student may be forced by the new system
to look at the "Great Chain of Being," with Supreme Mind
at the top and the protozoa at the bottom; He will see how
Mind was invoked as an explanatory principle all through
the Middle Ages and how Mind later became the problem.
Mind became that which needed explanation when Lamarck
showed that the Great Chain of Being should b'e inverted
to give an evolutionary sequence from the protozoa iIpward.
The problem then was to explain Mind in terms of what
could be known of this sequence.
And when the student reaches the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury, he might be given as a textbook Philip Henry Gosse's
Creation (Omphalos): An Attempt to Untie the Geological
Knot. He will learn from this extraordinary book things about
the structure of animals and plants which are today scarcely
mentioned in many courses of biology; notably, that all
animals and plants show a time structure, of which the rings
of growth in trees are an elementary example and

impact of internal physiology, it is possible to write an
equation in which the value of the characteristic in ques-
tion is expressed as some function of the value of the inl-
pacting circumstance. "Human skin color is some function
of exposure to sunlight," "respiration rate is some function of
atmospheric pressure," etc. Such equations are constructed to
be true for a variety of particular observations, and nec-
essarily contain subSidiary propositions which are stable (I.e.,
continue to be true) over a wide range of values of im-
pacpng circumstance and somatic characteristic. These sub-
sidiary propositions are of different logiCal type from the
original observations in the laboratory and are, in fact, de-
scriptive not of the data but of our equations. They are
statements about the form of the particular equation and
about the values of the parameters mentioned within it.
It would be sinlple, at this point, to draw the line between
genotype and phenotype by saying that the forms and
parameters of such equations are prOvided by genes, while
the inlpacts of environment, etc. determine the actual event
within this frame. This would amount to saying, e.g., that the
ability to tan is genotypically determined, while the amount
of tanning in a particular case depends upon exposure to sun-
light.
In terms of this oversimplified approach to the overlapping
roles of genotype and environment, the proposition excluding
Lamarckian inheritance would read somewhat as follows: In
the attempt to explain evolutionary process, there shall be
no assumption that the achievement of a particular value of
some variable under particular circumstances will affect, in
the gametes produced by that individual, the form or param-
eters of the functional equation governing the relationship
between that variable and its environmental circumstances.
Such a view is oversimplified, and parentheses must be
added to deal with more complex and extreme cases. First,
it is inlportant to recognize that the organism, considered
as a communicational system, may itself operate at multiple
levels of logical typing; loe., that there will be instances in
which what were above called "parameters" are subject to
change. The individual organism might as a result of "train-
ing" change its ability to develop a tan under sunlight. And
this type of change is certainly of very great importance
All theories of biological evolution depend upon at least
three SOl'ts- of change: (a) change of genotype, either by
mutation or by redistribution of genes; (b) somatic change
under pressure of environment; and (c) changes in environ-
mental conditions. The problem for the f!volutionist is to
build a theory combining these types of change into an
ongoing process which, under natural selection, will account
for the phenomena of adaptation and phylogeny.
Certain conventional premises may be selected to govern
such theory building:
(a) The theory shall not depend upon Lamarckian In-
heritance. August Weismann's argument for this premise still
stands. There is no reason to believe that either somatic
change or changes in environment can, in principle, call (by
physiological
communication)
for
appropriate
genotypic
change. Indeed, the little that we know about cOmmunica-
tion within the multicellularl individual indicates.that such
communication from soma to gene script is likely to be rare
and unlikely to be adaptive in effect. However, it is appro-
priate to attempt to spell out in this essay what this premise
implies:
Whenever some characteristic of an organism is modifiable

Second, the oversimplified view must be elaborated to

Be all that as it'may, both Weismann's objection to La-

because the environment returns to the previous normal.
The premise is truistical, regardless of the magnitude of
the time span involved.
_
( 0 ) Somatic change is also neoessary to oope with any
ohanges of genotype which might aid the organism in its
external struggle with the environment. The individual or-
ganism is a complex organization of interdependent parts.
A mutational or other genotypic change in anyone of these
(however externally valuable in terms of survival) is cer-
tain to require change in many others-which changes will
probably not be specified or implicit in the single mutational
change of the genes. A hypothetical pregiraffe, which had
the luck to carry a mutant gene "long neck," would have
to adjust to this change by complex modifications of the
'heart and circulatory system. These collateral adjustments

would have to be achieved at the somatic level. Only those
'1',,'
pregiraffes which are (genotypically) capable of these somat-
•
ic modifications would survive.
,
(d) In this essay, it is assumed that the oorpus of geno-
typic messages is preponderantly digital in nature. In con-
,
trast, the soma is seen as a working system in which the
genotypic recipes are tried out. Should it transpire that the
genotypic corpus is also in some degree analogio--a work-
ing model of the soma-premise 0 (above) would be ne-
ga~~d to that
degr~e. It would then be conceivable that
the mutant gene "long neck" might modify the message of
those genes which affect the development of the heart. It
is, of course, known that genes may have pleiotropic effect,
but these phenomena are relevant in the present connec-
tion only if it can be shown, e.g., that the effect of gene A
upon. the phenotype and its effect upon the phenotypic ex-
presSIOn of gene B are mutually appropriate in the overall
integration and adaptation of the organism.
These considerations lead to a classifying of both, geno-
typic and environmental changes in terms of the price which
they exact of the flexibility of the somatic system. A lethal
ch~ge in .~ither
en~onment or' genotype is simply one
. which demands somatic modifications which the organism
cannot achieve.
But the somatic price of a given change must depend,
not absolutely upon the change in question, but upon the
r~nge ~ somati~ flexibility. available to the organism at the
gIven time. This range, m turn, will depend upon how
much of the, organism's somatic flexibility is already being
used up in adjusting to other mutations or environmental
changes. We face an eoonomics' of flexibility which, like
any other economics, will become determinative for the
course of evolution if and only if the organism is operating
close to the limits set by this economics.
However, this economics of somatic flexibility will differ
in one important respect from the more familiar economics
of money or available energy. In these latter, each new
expenditure can simply be added to
the preceding ex-
penditures and the economics becomes coercive when the
additive total approaches the limit of the budget. In con-
1

Step8 ro an Ecology of Mind
trast, the combined eHect of multiple changes, each of which
exacts a price in the soma, will be multiplicative. This point
may be stated as follows: Let S be the finite set of all possible
living states of the organism. Within S, let
I'll be the
smaller set of all states compatible with a given mutation
( ffll)
and let 82 be the set of states compatible with a
second mutation (m2)' It follows that the two mutations in
combination will limit the organism to the logical product
of 81 and 82, i.e., to that usually smaller subset of states
which is composed only of members common to both 81 and8~.
In this way each successive mutation (or other genotypIc
change) will fractionate the possibilities for the somatic
adjustment of the organism. And, should the one mutation
require some somatic change, the exact opposite of a change
required by the other, the pOSSibilities for somatic adjustment
may immediately be reduced to zero,
The same argument must surely apply to multiple en-
vironmental changes which demand somatic adjustments;
and this will be true even of those changes in environ-
ment which might seem to benefit the organism. An im-
provement in diet, for example, will exclude from the or-
ganism's range of somatic adjustments those patterns of
growth which we would call "stunted" and which might be
required to meet some other exigency of the environment.
From these considerations it follows that if evolution pro-
ceeded in accordance with conventional theory, its process
would be blocked. The finite nature of somatic change in-
dicates that no ongoing process of evolution can result only
from successive. externally adaptive genotypic changes since
these must, in combination, become lethal, demanding COIl}-
binations of internal somatic ~djustments of which the soma
is incapable.
We turn therefore to a consideration of other classes of
genotypic change. What is required to give a balanced theory
of evolution is the occurrence of genotypic changes which
shall increase the available range of somatic flexibility. When
the internal organization of the organisms of a species has
been limited by environmental or mutational pressure to
some narrow subset of the totalrange of living states, further
evolutionary progress will require some sort of genotypic
change which will compensate for this limitation.
Step8 ro an Ecology of Mind
351
We note first that while the results of genotypic change
are irreversible within the life of the individual organism,
the opposite is usually true of changes which are achieved
at the somatic level. When the latter are produced in re-
sponse to special environmental conditions, a return of the
envirorunent to the previous norm is usually followed by a
diminution or loss of the characteristic. (We may reasonably
expect that the same would be true of those somatic adjust-
ments which must accompany an externally adaptive muta-
tion' but, of course, it is impOSSible in this case to remove
from the individual the impact of the mutational change.)
A further point regarding these reversible somatic changes
is of special interest. Among higher organisms it is not
unusual to find that there is what we may call a "de-
fense in depth" against environmental demands. H a man is
moved from sea level to 10,000 feet, he may begin to pant
and his heart may race. But these first changes are swiftly
reversible: if he descends the same day; they will dis-
appear immediately. H, however, he remains at the high al-
titude, a second· line of defense appears. He will become
slowly acclimated as
a
result
of
complex physiological
changes. His heart will cease to race, and he will no longer
pant unless he undertakes some special exertion. H now
he returns to sea level, the characteristics of the. second line
of defense will disappear rather slowly and he may even
experience some discomfort.
.
From the point of view of an economies of somatic flexi-
bility, the first eHect of high altitude is to reduce the or-
g:inismto a limited set of states (81) characterized by the
racing of the heart and the panting. The man can still·
surVive, but only.as a comparatively inflexible creature. The
later acclimation has precisely this value: it corrects for the
loss of flexibility. After the man is acclimated he can use his
panting mechanisms to adjust to other emergencies which
might otherwise be lethal.
A similar "defense in depth" is clearly recognizable in the
field of behavior. When we encounter a new problem for
the first time, we deal with it either by trial and error or
possibly by insight. Later, and more or less gradually, we
form the "habit" of acting in the way which earlier experi-
ence rewarded. To continue to use insight or trial and error

by corrective action is initiated. Moreover, this entire cir-
cuit must, in some degree, be available for this purpose for
the entire
time
during which
the reversible
change
is
maintained-a considerable using up of available message
pathways.
The matter of communicational economics becomes still
more serious when we note that the homeostatic circuits of
an organism are not separate but complexly interlocked, e.g.,
hormonal messengers which play a part in the homeostatic
control of organ A will also affect the states of organs B, C,
and D. Any special ongoing loading of the circuit controlling
A will therefore diminish the organism's freedom to control
B, C, andD.
In contrast, the changes brought about by mutation or other
genotypic change are presumably of a totally different na-
ture. Every cell contains a copy of the new genotypic corpus
and
therefore
will
(when
appropriate)
behave
in
the
changed manner, without any change in the messages which
it receives from surrounding tissues or organs. H the hypo-
thetical pregiraffes carrying the mutant gene "long neck"
could also get the gene "big heart," their hearts would be
enlarged ,without the necessity of using the homeostatic
pathways of the body to achieve and maintain this en-
largement. Such a mutation will have survival value not be-
cause it enables the pregiraffe to supply its elevated head
with sufficient blood, since this was already achieved by
somatic change-but because it increases the overall flexibility
of the organism, enabling it to survive other demands which
may be placed upon it either by environmental or geno-
typic change.
It appears, then, that the process of biological evolution
could be continuous if there were a class of mutations or
other genotypic changes which would simulate Lamarckian
inheritance. The function of these changes would be to
achieve by genotypic fiat those characteristics which the
organism at the given time is already achieving by the un-
economical method of somatic change.
Such a hypothesiS, I oelieve, conflicts in no way with
conventional theories of genetics and natural selection. It
does,
however,
somewhat alter
the
current conventional
picture of evolution as a whole, though related ideas were

upon this class of problem would be wasteful. These mech-
anisms can now be saved for other problems.2
Both in acclimation and in habit formation the economy
of flexibility is achieved by substituting a deeper and more
enduring change for a more superficial and more rever-
sible one. In the terms used above in discussing the anti-
Lamarckian premise, a change has occurred in the param-
eters of the functional equation linking rate of respiration
to external atmospheric pressure. Here it seems that the
organism is behaving as we may expect any ultrastable
system to behave. Ashby8 has shown that it is a general
formal characteristic of such systems that those circuits con-
trolling the more rapidly fluctuating variables act as balanc-
ing mechanisms to protect the ongoing constancy of those
variables in which change is normally slow and of small
amplitude; and that any interference which fixes the values
of the changeful variables must have a disturbing effect upon
the constancy of the normally steady components of the
system. For the man who must constantly pant at high
altitudes, the respiration rate can no longer be used as a
changeable quantity in the maintaining of phYSiological bal-
ance. Conversely, if the respiration rate is to become avail-
able again as a rapidly fluctuating variable, some change
must occur among the more stable components of the system.
Such a change will, in the nature of the case, be achieved
comparatively slowly and be comparatively irreversible.
Even acclimation and habit formation are, however, still
reversible within the life of the individual, and this very
reversibility indicates a lack of communicational economy in
these adaptive mechanisms. Reversibility implies that the
changed value of some variable is achieved by means of
homeostatic, error-activated circuits. There must be a means
of detecting an undesirable or threatening change in some
variable, and there must 'be a train of cause and effect where-

put forward over sixty years ago. Baldwin4 suggested that
we consider not only the operation of the external environ-'
ment in natural selection but also what he called "organic
selection" in which the fate of a given variation would de-
pend upon its physiologic. viability. In the same article,
Baldwin attributes to Lloyd Morgan the suggestion that
there might exist "coincident variations" which would simu-
late Lamarckian inheritance (the so-called "Baldwin effect").
According to such a hypothesis, genotypic change in an
organism becomes comparable to legislative change in a
society. The wise legislator will only rarely initiate a new rule
of behavior; more usually he will confine himseH to affirming
in law that which has already become the custom of the peo-
ple. An innovative rule can be introduced only at the price
of activating and perhaps overloading a large number of
homeostatic circuits in the society.
It is interesting to ask how a hypothetical process of evolu-
tion would work if Lamarckian inheritance were the rule,
i.e., if characteristics achieved by somatic homeostasis were
inherited. The answer is simple: it would not work, for the
following reasons:
(1) The question tumsupon the concept of economy in
the use of homeostatic circuits, and it would be the reverse
of economical to fix by genotypic change aU the variables
which accompany a given desirable and homeostatically
achieved characteristic. Every such characteristic is achieved
by ancillary homeostatic changes all around the circuits, and
it is most undesirable that these ancillary changes should
be fixed by inheritance, as would logically happen according
to any theory involving an indiscriminate Lamarckian in-
heritance. Those who would defend a Lamarckian theory
must be prepared to. suggest how in the genotype an appro-
priate selection can be achieved. Without such a selection,
the inheritance of a1::quired characteristics would merely in-
crease the proportion of nonviable genotypic changes.
(2) Lamarckian inheritance would disturb the relative
timing of the processes upon which evolution must-ac-
cording to the present hypothesis-depend. It is essential
that there be a time lag between the uneconomical but

reversible somatic achievement of a given characteristic and
the economical but more enduring alterations of the geno-
type. If we ~ook ?pon ~v~ry soma. as a working model which

that
sufficie~t but not infinite time must be given for these

porated into the final blueprint for mass production. This

would be unduly shortened by Lamarckian inheritance.
.1?e princi~le ~volved here is general and by no means
trlVlal. It obtams 10 all homeostatic systems in which a given
effect can be brought about by means of a homeostatic cir-
cuit, which circuit can, in turn, be modified in its characteris-
tics br some higher system of control. In all such systems
(rangmg from the house thermostat to systems of govern-
ment and administration) it is important that the higher
system of control lag behind the event sequences in the
peripheral homeostatic circuit.
In evolution two control systems are present: the homeo-
stases of the body which deal with tolerable internal stress

m~mbers of the population. From an engineer-
mg pomt of vIew; the problem is to limit communication from
the lower, reversible somatic system to the higher irreversible
genotypic system.
.
Another aspect of the proposed hypothesis about which
we can only speculate is the probable relative frequency of
the tw? classes of genotypic change: those which initiate
so~ething new an~ those which affirm some homeostatically
achieved charactenstic. In the Metazoa and multicellular
plants, w~ fa.ce

far outnumber those which initiate change, if the species is

-
to avoid that cul-de-sac in which the flexibility of the soma
approaches zero.
Conversely, this picture suggests that most organisms, at
any given time, are probably in such a state that there are
multiple possibilities for affirmative genotypic change. li, as
seems probable, both mutation and gene redistribution are
in some sense random phenomena, at least the chances are
considerable that one or other of these multiple possibilities
will be met.
Finally, it is appropriate to discuss what evidence is avail-
able or might be sought to support or disprove such a
hypothesis. It is clear at the outset that such a testing will be
difficult. The affirmative mutations upon which the hypothesis
depends will usually be lmxsible. From among the many
members of a population which are achieving a given ad-
justment to environmental circumstances by somatic· change,
it will not be possible immediately to pick out those few
in which the same adjustment is provided by the genotypic
method. In such a case, the genotypically changed individ-
uals will have to be identified by breeding and raising the
offspring under more normal conditions.
A still greater difficulty arises in cases where we would
investigate
those
homeostatically
acquired
characteristics
which are achieved in response to some innovative genotypic
change. It will often be impossible, by mere inspection of the
organism, to tell which of its characteristics are the primary
results of genotypic change and which are secondary somatic
adjuStments to these. In the imaginary case of the pregiraffe
with a somewhat elongated neck and an
enlarge~ heart, it
may be easy to guess that the modification of the neck is
genotypic while that of the heart is somatic. But all such
guesses will depend upon the very imperfect present knowl-
edge of what an organism can achieve in way of somatic
adjustment.
It is a major tragedy that the Lamarckian controversy has
deflected·the attention of geneticists away from the phenom-
enon of somatic adaptability. After all, the mechanisms,
thresholds, and maxima of individual phenotypic change un-
der stress must surely be genotypically determined.
Another difficulty, of rather similar nature, arises at the
population level, where we encounter another "economics"
of potential change, theoretically distinguishable from that
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
357
which operates within the individual. The population of a
wild species is today conventionally regarded as genotypical-
ly heterogeneous in spite of the high degree of superficial
resemblance between the individual phenotypes. Such a
population expectably functions as a storehouse of genotypic
possibilities. The economic aspect of this storehouse of pos-
sibilities has, for example, been stressed by Simmonds.1i He
points out that farmers and breeders who demand 100
per cent phenotypic uniformity in a highly select crop are in
fact throwing away most of the multiple genetic pOSSibilities
accumulated through hundreds of generations in the wild
population. From this Simmonds argues that there is urgent
need for institutions which shall "conserve" this storehouse of
variability by maintaining unselected populations.
Lerner6
has
argued
that
self-corrective
or
buffering
mechanisms operate to hold constant the composition of these
mixtures of wild genotypes and to resist the effects of artifi-
cial selection. There is therefore at least a presumption that
this economics of variability within the population will turn
out to be of the multiplicative kind.
Now, the difficulty of discriminating between a characteris-
tic achieved by somatic homeostasis and the same char-
acteristic achieved
(more economically)
by a genotypic
short cut is clearly going to be compounded when we come
to consider populations instead of phYSiologic individuals.
All actual experimentation in the field will inevitably work
with populations, and, in this work, it will be necessary to
discriminate the effects
of that economics of
flexibility
which operates inside the individuals from the effects of
the economics of variability which operates at the population
level. These two orders of economics may be easy to separate
in theory, but to separate them in experimentation will
surely be difficult.
Be all that as it may, let us consider what evidential sup-
port may be available for some of the propositions which
are crucial to the hypothesis:

bility. In general, we believe that the presence of stress A
may reduce an organism's ability to respond to stress Band,
guided by this opinion, we commonly protect the sick from
the weather. Those who have adjusted to the office life may
have difficulty in climbing mountains, and trained mountain
climbers may have difficulty when confined to offices; the •
stresses of retirement from business may be lethal; and so
on. But scientific knowledge of these matters, in man or
other organisms, is very slight.
(2)
That this economics of flexibility has the logical
structure described above-each successive demand upon
flexibility fractionating the set of available possibilities. The
proposition is expectable, but so far as I know there is no
evidence for it. It is, however, worthwhile to examine the
criteria which determine whether a given "economic" system
is more appropriately described in additive or multiplicative
tenns. There would seem to be two such criteria:
(a) A system will be additive insofar as the units of its
currency are mutually interchangeable and, therefore, can-
not meaningfully be classified into sets such as were used
earlier in this paper to show that the economics of flexibility
must surely be multiplicative. Calories in the economics of
energy are completely interchangeable and unclassifiable, as
are dollars in the individual budget. Both these systems
are therefore additive. The permutations and combinations
of variables which define the states of an organism are
classifiable and-to this extent-noninterchangeable.
The
system is therefore multiplicative. Its mathematics will re-
semble that of information theory or negative entropy rather
than that of money or energy conservation.
(b) A system will be additive insofar as the units of its
currency are mutually independent. Here there would seem
to be a difference between the economic system of the
individual, whose budgetary problems are additive (or sub-
tractive) and those of society at large, where the overall
distribution or flow of wealth is governed by complex (and
perhaps imperfect) homeostatic systems. Is there, perhaps,
an economics of economic flexibility
(a metaeconomics)
which is multiplicative and so resembles the economics of
physiological flexibility discussed above? Notice, however,
that the units of this wider economics will· be not dollars
but patterns of distribution of wealth. Similarly, Lerner's
Steps to an Ecology of Mind

"genetic homeostasis," insofar as it is truly homeostatic, will
have multiplicative character.
The matter is, however, not simple and we cannot expect
that every system will be either totally multiplicative or
totally additive. There will be intennediate cases which
combine the two characteristics. Specifically, where several
independent alternative homeostatic circuits control a single
variable, it is clear that the system may show additive
characteristics-and even that it may pay to incorporate
such alternative pathways in the system provided they can
, be effectively insulated from each other. Such systems of
multiple alternative controls may give survival advantage
insofar as the mathematics of addition and subtraction will
pay better than the mathematics of logical fractionation.
(3) That innovative genotypic change commonly makes
demands upon the adfustive ability of the soma. This prop-
osition is orthodoxly believed by biologists but cannot in
the nature of the case be verified by direct evidence.
(4) That successive genotypic innovatiims make multi-
plicative demands upon the soma. This proposition (which
involves both the notion of multiplicative economics of
flexibility and the notion that each innovative genotypic
change has its somatic price) has several interesting and
perhaps verifiable implications.
(a) We may expect that organisms in which numerous
recent genotypic changes have accumulated
(e.g.,
as
a
result of selection, or planned breeding) will be delicate,
i.e., will need to be protected from environmental stress.
This sensitivity to stress is to be expected in new breeds of _
domesticated animals and plants and experimentally pro-
duced organisms carrying either several mutant genes or
unusual (i.e., recently achieved) genotypic combinations.
(b)
We may expect that for such organisms further
genotypic innovation (of any kind other than the affinnative
changes discussed above) will be progressively deleterious.
(c) Such new and special breeds should become more
resistant both to environmental stress and to genotypic
change, as selection works upon successive generations to
favor those individuals in which "genetic assimilation of
acquired characteristics" is achieved (Proposition '5).

replaced by similar charact6ri8tic8 which are geneticaUy
determined. This phenomenon has been demonstrated by
Waddington7 for the bithorax phenotypes of Drosophila.
He calls it the "genetic assimilation of acquired characteris-
tics," Similar phenomena have also probably occurred in
various experiments when the experimenters set out to prove
the inheritance of acquired characteristics but did not
achieve this proof through failure to control the conditions
of selection. We have, however, no evidence at all as to the
frequency of this phenomenon of genetic assimilation. It is
worth noting, however, that, according to the arguments of
this essay, it maybe impossible, in principle, to exclude
the factor
of selection from
experiments which would
test "the inheritance of acquired characteristics." It is pre-
cisely my thesis that the simulation of Lamarckian inheritance
will have survival value under circumstance of undefined or
multiple stress.
(6). That it is, in general, more economical of flexibility
to achieve a given characteristic by genotypic than by soma-
tic change. Here the Waddington experiments do not throw
any light, because it was the experimenter who did
~e
selecting. To test this proposition, we need experiments m
which the population of organisms is placed under
dou~le
stress:
(a) that stress which will induce the charactens-
tic in which we are interested, and (b) a second stress which
will selectively decimate the population, favoring, we hope,
the survival of those individuals whose flexibility is more able
to meet this second ,stress after adjusting to the first. Accord-
ing to the hypothesis, such a system should favor those
individuals which achieve their adjustment to the first stress
by genotypic process.
(7) Finally, it is interesting to consider a corollary which
is the converse of the thesis of this essay. It has been
argued here that simulated Lamarckian inheritance will have
survival value when the population must adjust to a stress
which remains constant over successive generations. This
case is in fact the one which has been examined by those

Steps to an Ecology of Mind
361
who would demonstrate an inheritance of acquired charac-
teristics. A converse problem is presented by those cases in
which a population faces a stress which changes its intensity
unpredictably and rather often-perhaps every two or three
generations. Such situations are perhaps very rare in nature,
but could be produced in the laboratory.
Under such variable circumstances, it might pay the
organisms in survival terms to achieve the converse of the
genetic assimilation of acquired characteristics. That is, they
might profitably hand over to somatic homeostatic mecha-
nisms the control of some, characteristic which had previous-
ly been more rigidly controlled by the genotype.
It is evident, however, that such experimentation would be
very difficult. Merely to establish the genetic assimilation of
such characteristics as bithorax requires selection on an as-
tronomical scale, the final population in which the genetically
determined bithorax individuals can be found being a
selected sample from a po.tential population of something like
1050 or 1060 individuals. It is very doubtful whether, after
this selective process, there would still exist in the sample
enough genetic heterogeneity to undergo a further
conver~e
selection favoring those individuals which still achieve theIr
bithorax phenotype by somatic means.
Nevertheless, though this converse corollary is possibly not
demonstrable in the laboratory, something of the sort seems
to operate in the broad picture of evolution. The matter may
be presented in dramatic form by considering the dichotomy
between "regulators" and "adjusters."s Prosser proposes that
where internal physiology contains some variable of the same
dimensions as some external environmental variable, it is
convenient to classify organisms according to the degree to
which they hold the internal variable constant in spite of
changes in the external variable. Thus, the homoiothermic
animals are classified as "regulators" in regard to tempera-
ture while the poikilothermic are "adjusters."
The same
dichotomy can be applied to aquatic animals according to
how they handle internal and external osmotic pressure.
We usually think of regulators as being in some broad
evolutionary sense "higher" than adjusters. Let us now con-

sider what this might mean. If there is a broad evolutionary
trend in favor of regulators, Is this trend consistent with what
has been said above about the survival benefits which accrue
when control is transferred to genotypic mechanisms?
.
Clearly, not only the regulators but also the adjusters
must rely upon homeostatic mechanisms. If life is to go on,
a large number of essential physiological variables must be
held within narrow limits. If the internal osmotic pressure,
for example, is allowed to change, there must be mechanisms
which will defend these essential variables. It follows that
the difference between adjusters and regulators is a matter
of where, in the complex network of physiologic causes and
effects, homeostatic process operates.
In the regulators, the homeostatic processes operate at or
close to the input and output points of that network which
is the individual organism. In the adjusters, the environ-
mental variables are permitted to enter the body and the
organism must then cope with their effects, using mecha-
nisms which will involve deeper loops of the total network.
In tenns of this analysis, the polarity between adjusters
and regulators can be extrapolated another. step to include
what we may call "extraregulators" which achieve homeo-
static controls outside the body by changing and controlling
the environment-man being the most conspicuous example
of this class.
In the earlier part of this essay, it was argued that in
adjusting to high altitude there is a benefit to be obtained,
in terms of an economics of flexibility, by shifting from,
e.g., panting to the more profound and less reversible changes
of acclimation; that habit is more economical than' trial and
error; and that genotypic control may be more economical
than acclimation. These are all centripetal changes in the
location of control.
In the broad picture of evolution, however, it seems
that the trend is in the opposite direction: that natural selec-
tion, in the long run, favors regulators more than adjusters,
and extraregulators more than regulators. This seems to indi-
cate that there is a long time evolutionary advantage to be
gained by centrifugal shifts in the locus of control.
To speculate about problems so vast is perhaps romantic,
but it is worth noting that this contrast between the overall
evolutionary trend and the trend in a population faced with

constant stress is what we might expect from the converse
corollary here being considered. If constant stress favors
centripetal shift in the locus of control, and variable stress
favors centrifugal shift, then it should follow that in the vast
spans of time and change which determine the broad evo-
lutionary picture, centrifugal shift of control will be favored.
Summary
In this essay the author. uses a deductive approach. Start-
ing from premises of conventional physiology and evolution-
ary theory and applying to these the arguments of cyber-
netics, he shows that there must be an economics of somatic
flexibility and that this economics must, in the long run, be
coercive upon the evolutionary process. External adaptation
by mutation or genotypic reshufHing, as ordinarily thought of,
will inevitably use up the available somatic flexibility. It
follows-if evolution is to be continuous-that there must
also be a class of genotypic changes which will confer a
bonus of somatic flexibility.
In general, the somatic achievement of change is uneco-
nomical because the process depends upon homeostasis, i.e.,
upon whole circuits of interdependent variables. It follows
that inheritance of acquired characteristics would be lethal
to the evolutionary system because it would fix the values of
these variables all around the circuits. The organism or
species would, however, benefit (in survival terms) by geno-
typic change which would simulate Lamarckian inheritance,
i.e., would bring about the adaptive component of somatic
homeostasis without involving the whole homeostatic cir-
cuit. Such a genotypic change (erroneously called the "Bald-
win effect") would confer a bonus of somatic flexibility and
would therefore have marked survival value.
Finally, it is suggested that a contrary argument can be
applied in those·· cases where a population must acclimate
to variable stress. Here natural selection should favor an
anti-Baldwin effect.

Problems in Cetacean and Other
Mammalian Communication*
The Communication of Preverbal Mammals
Of the Cetacea I have had little experience. I once dis-
sected in the Cambridge Zoological Laboratories a specimen
of Phocoena bought from the local fishmonger, and did not
really encounter cetaceans again until this year, when I had
an opportunity to meet Dr. Lilly's dolphins. I hope that my
discussion of some of the questions that are iri my mind as I
approach these peculiar mammals will assist you in examin-
ing either these or related questions.
- My previous work in the fields of anthropology, animal
ethology,
and

theory
provides
a
theoretical
framework for the transactional analysis of behavior. The
premises of this theoretical position may be briefly sum--
marized: (1) that a relationship between two (or more)
organisms is, in fact, a sequence of S-R sequences (I.e., of
contexts in which proto-learning occurs); (2) that deutero-
learning (I.e., learning to learn) is, in fact, the acquiring of
information about the contingency patterns of the contexts
in which proto-learning occurs; and (3) that the "character"
of the organism is the aggregate of its deutero-learning and

These premises are essentially a hierarchic structuring of

Typ~.2 ?e premises, following the Theory of
Types, are prImanly appropriate for the analysis of digital
communication. To what extent they may be applicable to
analogic communication or to systems that combine. the digi-
tal with the analogic is ·problematic. I hope that the study of
dolphin communication will throw light on these fundamental
problems. The point is not either to discover that dolphins
have complex language or to teach them English, but to
close gaps in our theoretical knowledge of communication by
studying a system. that, whether rudimentary or complex, is
almost certainly of a totally unfamiliar kind.
Let me start from the fact that the dolphin is a mammal.
This fact has, of course, all sorts of implications for anatomy
and physiology, but it is not with these that I am concerned.
I am' interested in his communication, in what is called his
"behavior," looked at as an aggregate of data perceptible and
meaningful to 'other members of the same· species. It is
meaningful, first, in the sense that it affects a recipient ani-
mal's behavior, and, second, in the sense that perceptible
failure to achieve appropriate meaning in the first sense will
affect the behavior of both animals. What I say to you may
be totally ineffective, but my ineffectiveness, if perceptible,
, will affect both you and me. I stress this point because it
must be remembered that in all relationships between man
and some other animal, especially when that animal is a
dolphin, a very large proportion of the behavior of both
organisms is determined by this kind of ineffectiveness.
When I view the behavior of dolphins as communication,
the mammalian label implies, for me, something very defi-
nite. Let me illustrate what I have in mind by an example
from Benson Ginsburg's wolf pack in the Brookfield Zoo.
Among the Canidae, weaning is performed by the mother•
When the puppy asks for milk, she presses down with her

open mouth on the.hack of his neck, crus~g him. do~ to
the ground. She does this repeatedly until he stops asking.
This method is used by coyotes, dingoes, and the domestic
dog. Among wolves the system is different. The puppies
graduate smoothly from the nipple to regurgitated food. The
pack comes back to the den with their .bellies full. All re-
gurgitate what they have got and all eat together. At some
point the. adults start to wean the puppies from these meals,
using the method employed by the other Canidae; the adult
crushes the puppy down by pressing its open mouth on the
back of the puppy's neck. In the woH this function is not
confined to the mother, but is perlormed by adults of both
sexes.
The pack leader of the Chicago pack· is a
magnifi~nt
male animal who endlessly patrols the acre of land to which
the pack is confined. He moves with a beautiful trot that
appears tireless, while the other eight or nine members of
the pack spend most of their time dozing. When the females
come in heat they usually proposition the leader, bumping
againSt him with their rear ends. Usually, however, he does
not respond, though he does act to prevent other males
from getting the females. Last year one of these males suc-
ceeded in establishing coitus with a female. As in the other
Canidae, the male woH is locked in the female, unable to
withdraw his penis, and this animal was helpless. Up rushed
the pack leader. What did he do to the helpless male who

prerogatives?

morphism would suggest that he would tear. the helpless
male to pieces. But no. The film shows

down the head of the oHending male four times WIth his
open jaws and then simply walked away.
.
.
What are the implications for research from this illustra-
tion? What the pack leader does is not describable, or only
insufficiently described, in S-R terms. He does not "negatively
reinforce" the other male's sexual activity. He asserts or af-
finns the nature of the relationship between himseH and the
other. If we were to translate the pack leader's action into
words, the words would not be ''Don't do that," Rather, they
would translate the metaphoric action: "I am your senior
adult male, you puppy!" What I am trying to say about
wolves in particular, and about preverbal mammals in gen-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
367
eral, is that their discourse is primarily about the rules and
the contingencies of relationship.
Let me oHer a more familiar example to help bring home
to you the generality of this view, which is by no means
orthodox among ethologists. When your cat is trying to tell
you to give her food, how does she do it? She has no word
for food or for milk. What she does is to make movements
and sounds that are characteristically those that a kitten
makes to a mother cat. If we were to translate the cat's
message into words, it would not be correct to say that she
is crying "Milk'" Rather, she is saying something like "Ma-
ma'" Or, perhaps still more correctly, we should say that she
is asserting "Dependency! Dependency'" The cat talks in
terms of patterns and contingencies of relationship, and
from this talk it is up to you to take a deductive step,
guessing that it is milk that the cat wants. It is the necessity
for this deductive step which marks the difference between
preverbal mammalian communication and both the com-
munication of bees and the languages of men.
What was extraordinary-the great new thing-in the
evolution of human language was not the discovery of ab-
straction or generalization, but the discovery of how to be
specific about something other than relationship. Indeed, this
discovery, though it has been achieved, has scarcely af-
fected the behavior even of human beings. If A says to B,
"The plane is scheduled to leave at 6.30," B rarely accepts
this remark as simply and solely a statement of fact about
the plane. More often he devotes a few neurons to the
question, "What does A's telling me this indicate for my re-
lationship to A?" Our mammalian ancestry is very near the
surface, despite recently acquired linguistic tricks.
Be that as it may, my first expectation in studying dolphin
communication is that it will prove to have the general mam-
malian characteristic of being primarily about relationship.
This premise is in itseH perhaps sufficient to account for
the sporadic development of large brains among mammals.
We need not complain that, as elephants do not talk and
whales invent no mousetraps, these creatures are not overtly
intelligent. All that is needed is to suppose that large-
brained creatures were, at some evolutionary stage, unwise
enough to get into the game of relationship and that, once
the species was caught in this game of interpreting its mem-
l

bers' behavior toward one another as relevant to this com-
plex and vital subject, there was survival value for those in-
dividuals who could play the game with greater ingenuity or
greater wisdom. We may, then, reasonably expect to find a
high complexity of cOIIUIlunication about relationship among
the Cetacea. Because they are mammals, we may expect
that their communication will be about, and primarily in
terms of, patterns and contingencies of relationship. Be-
cause they are social and large-brained, we may expect a
high degree of complexity in their communication.
Methodological Considerations
The above hypothesis introduces very special difficulties
into the problem of how to test what is called the "psy-
chology" (e.g., intelligence, ingenuity, discrimination, etc.)
of individual animals. A simple discrimination experiment,
such as has been run in the Lilly laboratories, and no doubt
elsewhere, involves a series of steps: (1) The dolphin may
or may not perceive a difference between the stimulus ob-
jects, X and Y. (2) The dolphin mayor may not perceive
that this difference is a cue to behavior. (3) The dolphin
mayor may not perceive that the behavior in question has
a good or bad effect upon reinforcement, that is, that do-
ing "right" is conditionally followed by fish. (4) The dolphin
mayor may not choose to do "right," even after he knows
which is right. Success in the first three steps merely
pro~
vides the dolphin with a further choice point. This extra
degree of freedom must be the first focus of our investiga-
tions.
It must be our first focus for methodological reasons. Con-
sider the arguments that are conventionally based upon ex-
periments of this kind. We argue always from the later
steps in the series to the earlier steps. We say, "If the ani-
mal was able to achieve step 2 in our experiment, then he
must have been able to achieve step 1." If he could learn to
behave in the way that would bring him the reward, then
he must have had the necessary sensory acuity to discrimi-
nate between X and Y, and so on.
Precisely because we want to argue from observation of
the animal's success in the later steps to conclusions about
-------------1
I
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
369
the more elementary steps, it becomes of prime importance
to know whether the organism with which we are dealing is
capable of step 4. If it is capable, then all arguments about
steps 1 through 3 will be invalidated unless appropriate
methods of controlling step 4 are built into the experimental
design. Curiously enough, though human beings are fully
capable of step 4, psychologists working with human sub-
jects have been able to study steps 1 through 3 without
taking special care to exclude the confusions introduced by
this fact. If the human subject is "cooperative and sane," he
usually responds to the testing situation by repressing most
of his impulses to modify his behavior according to his per-
sonal view of his relationship to the experimenter. The words
cooperative and sane imply a degree of consistency at the
level of step 4. The psychologist operates by a sort of petitio
principii: if the subject is cooperative and sane (i.e., if the
relational rules are fairly constant), the psychologist need
not worry about changes in those rules.
The problem of' method becomes entirely different when
the subject is noncooperative, psychopathic, schizophrenic,
a naughty child, or a dolphin. Perhaps the most fascinating
characteristic of this animal is derived precisely from his
ability to operate at this relatively high level, an ability that
is still to be demonstrated.
Let me now consider for a moment the art of the animal
trainer. From. conversations with. these highly skilled people
-trainers of both dolphins and guide dogs-my impression
is that the first requirement of a trainer is that he must be
able to prevent the animal from exerting choice at the level
of step 4. It must continually be made clear to the animal
that, when he knows what is the right thing to do in a
given context, that is the only thing he can do, and no non-
sense about it. In other words, it is a primary condition of
circus success that the animal shall abrogate the use of
certain higher levels of his intelligence. The art of the hyp-
notist is similar.
There is a story told of Dr. Samuel Johnson. A silly lady
made her dog perform. tricks in his presence. The Doctor
seemed unimpressed. The lady said, "But Dr. Johnson, you
don't know how difficult it is for the dog." Dr. Johnson re-
plied, ''Difficult, madam? Would it were impossible!"

has stripped the whales of facial expression. They have no
external ears to Hap and few if any erectile hairs. Even the
cervical vertebrae are fused into a solid block in many
species, and evolution has streamlined the body, sacrificing
the expressiveness of separate parts to the locomotion of the
whole. Moreover, conditions of life in the sea are such that
even if a dolphin had a mobile face, the details of his ex-
pression would be visible to other dolphins only at rather
short range, even in the clearest waters.
It is reasonable, then, to suppose that in these animals
vocalization has taken over the communicative functions that
roost animals perform by facial expression, wagging tails,
clenched fists, supinated hands, Haring nostrils, and the like.
We might say that the whale is the communicational op-
posite of the giraffe; it has no neck, but has a voice. This
speculation alone would make the communication of dol-
phins a subject of great theoretical interest. It would be
fascinating, for example, to know whether or not, in an
evolutionary shift from kinesics to vocalization, the same gen-
eral structure of categories is retained.
My own impression-and it is only an impression unsup-
ported by testing-is that the hypothesis that dolphins have
substituted paralinguistics for kinesics does not quite fit in
with my experience when I listen to their sounds. We ter-
restrial mammals are familiar with paralinguistic communica-
tion; we use it ourselves in grunts and groans, laughter and
sobbing, modulations of breath while speaking, and so on.
Therefore we do not find the paralinguiStic sounds of other
~ammals totally opaque. We learn rather easily to recognize
in them certain kinds of greeting, pathos, rage, persuasion,
and territoriality, though our guesses may often be wrong.
But when we hear the sounds of dolphins we cannot even
guess at their significance. I do not quite trust the hunch
that would explain the sounds of dolphins as merely an
elaboration of the paralinguistics of other mammals.
(To
argue thus from our inability is, however, weaker than to
argue from what we can do,)
I personally do not believe that the dolphins have any-
thing that a human linguist would call a "language." 1 do not
think that any animal without hands would be stupid
enough to arrive at so outlandish a mode of communication.
Communication About Relationship
As I said earlier,. I expect dolphin communication to be of
an almost totally unfamiliar kind. Let me expand on this
point. As mammals, we are familiar with, though .largely
unconscious of, the habit of communicating about our re-
lationships. Like other terrestrial mammals, we do most of
our communicating on this subject by means of kinesic and
paralinguistic signals, such as bodily movements, involuntary
tensions of voluntary muscles, changes of facial expression,
hesitations, shifts in tempo of speech or movement, overtones
of the voice, and irregularities of respiration. If you want
to know what the bark of a dog "means," you look at his
lips, the hair on the back of his neck, his tail, and so on.
These "expressive" parts of his body tell you at what object
of the environment he is barking, and what patterns of re-
lationship to that object he is likely to follow in the 'next
few seconds. Above all, you look at his sense organs: his
eyes, his ears, and his nose.
In all mammals, the organs of sense become
~lso organs
for the transmission of messages about relationship. A blind
man makes us uncomfortable, not because he cannot see--
that is his problem and we are only dimly aware .of it-but
because he does not transmit to us through the movement of
his eyes the messages we expect and need so that we may
know and be sure of the state of our relationship to him.
We shall not know much about "dolphin communication until
we know what one dolphin can read in another's use, di-
rection, volume, and pitch of echolocation.
Perhaps it is this lack in us which makes the communica-
tion of dolphins seem mysterious and opaque, but I suspect
a more profound explanation. Adaptation to life in the ocean

What is amazing about circus tricks is that the animal
can abrogate the use of so much of his intelligence and still
have enough left to perform the trick. I regard the con-
scious intelligence as the greatest ornament of the human
mind. But many authorities, from the Zen masters to Sig-
mund Freud, have stressed the ingenuity of the less con-
scious and perhaps more archaic level.

the work prove rewarding, the success will be only a weak
verification of the epistemology.
(2) We do not even know what a primitive digital sys-
tem for the discussion of patterns of relationship might look
like, but we can guess that it would not look like a "thing"
language. (It might, more probably, resemble music.) I shall
therefore not expect the techniques for cracking human
linguistic codes to be immediately applicable to the vocali-
zation of dolphins.
.
(3) The first requirement, then, is to identify and to clas-
sify the varieties and the components of relationship existing
among the animals through detailed ethological study of
their actions, interactions, and social organization. The ele-
ments of which these patterns are built are doubtless still
present in the kinesics and actions of the species. We there-
fore begin with a listing of the kinesic signals of individual
dolphins, and then ~ to relate them to the contexts in which
they are used.
(4) No doubt, just as the pack leader's behavior tells us
that "dominance" among wolves is metaphorically related to
weaning, so also the dolphins will tell us their kinesic meta-
phors for "dominance," "dependency," and other I.l. functions.
Gradually this systein of signals will fit together piece by
piece to form a picture of the varieties of relationship exist-
ing even among animals arbitrarily confined together in a
tank.

correspond (directly or inversely) to magnitudes in the re- i

It is logical, then, to consider the hypothesis that the
vocalization of dolphins may be a digital expression of I.l.
functions. It is this possibility that 1 especially have in mind
in saying that this communication may be of an almost totally
unfamiliar kind. Man, it is true, has a few words for I.l. func-
tions, words like "love," "respect," "dependency," and so on.
But these words function poorly in the actual discussion of
relationship between participants in the relationship. 1£ J:ou
say to a girl, "1 love you," she is likely to pay more attention
to the accompanying kinesics and paralinguistics than to the
words themselves.
We humans become very uncomfortable when somebody
starts to interpret our postures and gestures by translating
them into words about relationship. We much prefer that
our messages on this subject remain analogic, unconscious,
and involuntary. We tend to distrust the manwho can simu-
late messages about relationShip. We therefore have no idea
what it is like to be a species with even a very simple and
rudimentary digital system whose primary subject matter
would be I.l. functions. This system is something we terrestrial
mammals. cannot imagine and for which we have no em-
pathy.

Comments
Mr. Wood:
In the course of twelve years in Marine Stu-
dios in· Florida, I spent a great deal of time watching what
was perhaps the 'most natural assemblage of TfJrsiops in
captivity, including animals of various ages, usually two or
more of them in ,the process of ,growing up, and I saw re.-
markably little of what you are going to look for in a much
more restricted group of animals in the Virgin Islands.
One time I saw something very interesting. Early one
morning about six or six-thirty, over a period of at least half
an hour, the adult male assumed a position next to one of the
females in the tank who was hanging motionless in the CUI-
rent.' He would go up occasionally and move away and then
come back and assume a position beside her, and he would
stroke her side with his right flipper repeatedly. There was
no indication that this had sexual significance. There was no
erection on the part of the male, and no observable re.-
sponse on the part of the female. But it was as clear-cut a
nonvocal signal as I ever observed in the tank.

Dr. Ray:
I tend to agree with Mr. Bateson. We are
working at the New York Aquarium with the beluga whale,
and I believe these animals are much more expressive than
we like to suspect. I think one of the reasons they don't do
very much in captivity is that they are bored to tears most
of the time. There is nothing much of interest in their tank
environment, and I would like to suggest that we have to
manipulate their captivity much more cleverly than we do.
I don't mean handling the whales. They don't like that. But
the introduction of different types of animals, or clever little
things that we might do would get them to respond more.
Captive Cetaceans· are like monkeys in a cage. They are
higWy intelligent and highly developed, and they are bored.
Another factor is our skill in observation, and in the beluga
whale, at least, we have been able to notice visually the
sounds they are making by watching the change in the
shape of the melon, which is extremely mm:ked in this ani-
mal. It can swell on one side or the other, or take several
different shapes correlated with sound production. So, by
very careful observation and/or sldlled manipulation, I think
a great deal can be done with these animals rather simply.
Mr. Bateson:
I would like to say that the -amount of

Introduction
A He-examination of "Bateson's Hule"*
Nearly eighty years ·ago, my father, William Bateson, be-
came fascinated by the phenomena of symmetry and ~eta­
Imerlo regularity as exhibited in the morphology of ammals
. and plants. It is difficult today to define precisely what he
! was after, but, broadly, it is clear that he believed that an
entirely new concept of the nature of living things would
develop from the study of such phenomena. He held, no
doubt correctly, that natural selection could not be ,the only
determinant of th~ direction of evolutionary change and that
f the genesis of variation could not be a .random,matter. H~
'I. therefore set out to demonst:rat~.regulanty and 'lawfulness
. among the phenomena of vanability.
In ibis attempt to demonstrate a sort of order which the
biologists of his day had largely ignored, he was guided by
the notion, never clearly formulated, that the place to look
for regularity in variation would be precisely where variation
had its impact upon what was already regular and repetitive.
The phenomena of symmetry and metamerism, themselves
strikingly regular, must surely have been brought about by
regularities or "laws" within the evolutionary process and,

Dr. Purves:
It seems to me that the dolphin or the
cetacean must suHer from an even greater disadvantage
than man has in the past, because-I have forgotten the
authority-it has been said that the origin of human speech
is an analogue language. In other words, if y()u use the word
"down," you lower the hand, and lower the lower jaw at the
same time. If you say "up," you raise the hand and raise
the lower jaw. And if you use the word "table," and, better
still, pronounce it in French, your mouth widens out and :
you make a horizontal gesture. However complicated the
human language is, it has its origin in an analogue language.
The poor porpoise has nothing like this to start from. So he
!
must have been highly intelligent to have developed a com-
munication system completely de novo.
Mr. Bateson:
What has happened to this cr:eatu're is that
the information we get Visually and the other terrestrial ani-
mals get visually must have been pushed into voice. I still
maintain that it is appropriate for us to start by investigating
what is left of the visual material.

In 1894, it appeared that the problem centered ~ound
the question: What causes the development of bilateral
symmetry in a context where it does not belong?
.
But modern theory has turned all such qu.estions ups~de
down. Information, in the technical sense, ~ that which
excludes certain alternatives. The machine Wlth a governor
does not elect the steady state; it prevents itself
fro~
staying in any alternative state; and in all such Cl,fbernetic
systems, corrective action is brought
ab.o~~ by
di~erence~
In the jargon of the engineers, the system IS error activ~~ed.
The difference between some present state and some
pre-
ferred" state activates the corrective response.
The technical term "information" may be succinctly de-
fined as any difference which makes a difference in ~ome
later event. This definition is fundamental for all ~~alys~ of
cybernetic systems and organization. The definition links
such analysis to the rest of science, where ~e causes of
events are commonly not differences but forces, ID1pacts, and
the like. The link is classically exemplified by the
he~t
engine, where availab!e' energy (i.e., negative entropy)

a function of a difference between two temperatures. In
this classical instance, "information" and "negative entropy"

It was for this study that he coined the word "genetics,''1
He set out to examine the material in the world's mu
seums, private collections, and journals bearing upon th
teratology of animal symmetry and metamerism. The de
tails of this smvey were published in a large book2 which .
still of considerable interest.
To demonstrate regularity within the field of teratologica
variation, he attempted a classification of the various so
of modification that he encountered. With this classificatio
I am not here concerned, except that in the survey he hap
pened upon a generalization which can be called a "dis"
covery." This discovery came to be called "Bateson's Rule"
and remains one of the unexplained mysteries of biology.
The purpose of the present note is to place Bateson'
Rule in a new theoretical perspective determined by cy
bernetics, information theory, and the like.
Briefly, Bateson's Rule asserts in its simplest form tha
when an asymmetrical lateral appendage
(e.g.,
a righ
hand) is reduplicated, the resulting reduplicated limb wi
be bilaterally symmetrical, consisting of two parts each a
mirror image of the other and so placed that a plane of
symmetry could be imagined between them.
He himself was, however, very doubtful' whether such
simple reduplication ever ocems. He believed and accumu-
lated evidence to show that, in a very large proportion of
such cases, one component of the reduplicated system was it
self double. He asserted that in such systems the three.
components are normally in one plane; that the two com-
ponents of the doublet are mirror images of each other; and

Moreover, the energy relations of such cybernetic systems ~
are commonly inverted.
Because organisms
are able to'll
store energy, it is usual that the energy expenditure is, I
for limited periods of time, an inverse function of energy in-
put. The amoeba is more active when it l.acks food, and th.e
I
stem of a green plant grows faster on that side which is
turned away from the light.. .
'
I
Let us therefore invert the question about the symmetry
of the total reduplicated appendage: Why is this double
appendage not asymmetrical like the corresponding appen-
I
dages of normal organisms?
I
To this question· a formal and general (but not particular) I
answer can be constructed on the following lines:
(1) An unfertilized frogs egg is radially symmetrical,
!
with animal and vegetal poles but no differentiation of its
equa~orial radii. Such an egg develops into a bilaterally sym-
metrical embryo, but how does it select one meridian to be
the plane of bilateral symmetry of that embryo? The· an-
swer is known-that, in fact, the frog's egg receives informa-
tion from the outside. The point of entry of the spermato-
zoon (or the prick of a fine fiber) marks one meridian as
different from all others, and that meridian is the future
plane of bilateral symmetry.
Converse cases can also be cited. Plants of many families
bear bilaterally symmetrical flowers. Such flowers are all
clearly derived from triadic radial symmetry (as in orchids)
or from pentadic symmetry (as in Labiatae, Leguminosae,
etc.); and the bilateral symmetry is achieved by the differ-
entiation of one axis (e.g., the "standard" of tl;J.e familiar
sweet pea) of this radial symmetry. We again ask how it is
possible to select one of the similar three (or five) axes.
And again we find that each flower receives information
from the outside. Such bilaterally symmetrical Howers can
only be produced on branch stems, and the differentiation
of the Hower is always oriented to the manner in which the
flower-bearing branch stem comes off from the main stem.
Very occasionally a plant which normally bears bilaterally
symmetrical flowers will form a Hower at the terminus of a
main stem. Such a Hower is necessarily only radial in its
symmetry-a cup-shaped monstrosity. (The problem of bi-
laterally asymmetrical flowers, e.g., in the Catasetum group
of orchids, is interesting. Presumably these must be borne,
---------~
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
383
lik~ the lateral. appendages of animals, upon branches from
~am stems which are themselves already bilaterally symmet-
ncal, e.g., dorso-ventrally flattened.)
(2) W,e note then that, in biological systems, the step
fro~
radi~ ~etry to. bilateral symmetry commonly re-
qUIres a pIece of information from the outside. It is, however,
conceivab~e that some divergent process might be touched
off by mmu,te.. and randomly distributed differences, e.g.,
among the radii of the frog's egg. In this case, of course, the
selectio? of a particular meridian for special development
would Itself be random and could not be oriented to other
parts of the organism as is the plane of bilateral symmetry
in sweet peas and labiate Howers.
(3) Similar considerations apply to the step from bilateral
symmetry to asymmetry. Again either the asymmetry (the
differentiation of one half from the other) must be achieved
by ~ random process or ~t must be -aChieved by information
receIved from the outsIde, i.e., from neighboring tissues
and organs. Every lateral appendage of a vertebrate or
:rrthropod is more or less asymmetrical4 and the asymmetry
IS never set randomly in relation to the rest of the animal.
Right limbs are not borne upon the left side of the body,
except under
experimental circumstances.
Therefore the
asymmetry must depend upon the outside information, pre-
sumably derived from the neighboring tissues.
(~) But if. ~e ste.p from ?ilateralsymmetry to asymmetry
reqUIres additional mformation, then it follows that in ab-
sence of this additional information, the appendage which
should have been asymmetrical can only be bilaterally sym-
metrical.
The problem of the bilateral symmetry of reduplicated
'In this connection, scales and feathers and hairs are of
special interest. A feather would seem to have a very
~lear bilateral symmetry in which the plane of symmetry
IS related to the antero-posterior differentiation of the
bird. Superposed on this is an asymmetry like that of the
individual bilateral limbs. As in the case of lateral limbs
co.rres~nding feathers on opposite sides of the body ar~
mIrror Images of each other. Every feather is, as it
were, a flag whose shape and coloring denote the
values of determining variables at the point and time
of its growth.

Typically6 one leg (rarely more than one) of a beetle is
abnormal in bearing a branch at some point in its length.
This branch is regularly a doublet, consisting of two parts
which may be fused at the point of branching off from the
primary leg but which are commonly separate at their distal
ends.
Distally frOm the point of branching there are thus three
components-a primary leg and two supernumerary legs.
These three lie in one plane and have the following sym-
metry: the two components of the supernumerary doublet
are a complementary pair~ne being a left and the other
a right-as Bateson's Rule would suggest. Of these two, the
leg nearest to the primary leg is complementary to it.
These relations are represented in Figure 6. (See page
345.) Each component is shown in diagrammatic cross section
and their dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior faces
ar~
indicated by the letters D, V, A, and P, respectively.
What is surprising about these abnormalities-in that it
conflicts with the hypothesis offered above-is that there is
no clear discontinuity by which the cases can be classified
according to which sort of orienting information has been
lost. The supernumerary doublet may be borne on any part
of the circumference of the primary leg.
Figure 6 illus~ates.the symmetry of a doublet occurring
in the dorsal regIOn. FIgure 7 (page 345) illustrates the sym_
metry of a doublet in the dorsa-anterior region.
It appears, then, that the planes of symmetry are parallel
to .a tangent of.the cir~erence of the primary leg at the
pomt of branching but, smce the points of branching may be
.anywhere on the circumference, a continuous series of pos-
sible bila~eral symmetries is generated.
Figure 8 (page 343) is a maclIine invented by W. Bateson
to demonstrate this continuous series of possible bilateral
symmetries.
If the bilateral symmetry of the doublet is due to a loss
of orienting information, we should expect the plane of that
bilateral symmetry to be at right angles to the direction of the
lost information; i.e., if dorso-ventral information were lost,
the resulting limbs or doublet should contaip a plane of
symmetry which would be at right angles to the dorso-ventral
line.

limbs thus becomes simply a problem of the loss of a piece
of information. This follows from the general lOgical rule
that every reduction in symmetry (from radial to bilateral
or from bilateral to asymmetrical) requires additional in-
formation.
It is not claimed that the above argument is an explanation
of all the phenomena which illustrate Bateson's Rule. Indeed~
the argument is offered only to show that there are Simple
ways of thinking about these phenomena which have scarce-
ly been explored. What is proposed is a family of hypotheses
rather than a single one. A critical examination of what has
been said above as·if it were a single hypothesis will, how-
ever, prOvide a further illustration of the method.
In any given case of reduplication, it will be necessary
to decide what particular piece of information has been
lost, and the argument so far given should make this decision
easy. A natural first guess would be that the developing
appendage needs three sorts of orienting information to en-
able it to achieve asymmetry: proximo-distal information; dor-
so-ventral information; and antera-posterior information. The
simplest hypothesis suggests that these might be separately
received and therefore that one of these sorts of information
will be lost or absent in any given case of reduplication. It
should then be easy to classify cases of reduplication ac-
cording to which piece of orienting information is. missing.
There should be at most three such types of reduplication,
and these should be clearly distinct.
Supernumerary Double Legs in Coleoptera
But in the only set of cases where this deduction can be
tested, facts clearly do not fit the hypothesis. The cases
are those of supernumerary pairs of appendages in beetles.
About a hundred such cases were lmown in 1894, and of
these Bateson5 describes about half and figures thirteen.
The formal relations are remarkably uniform and leave no
doubt that a single type of explanation should apply to the
symmetry in all cases.

branch at the point of loss.
H
The matter becomes superficially paradoxical:
the loss
"
of a gradient which might inhibit branching results in branch
1
formation, such that the branch cannot achieve asymmetry.
I
It appears, then, that the hypothetical centro-peripheral
gradient or difference may have two sorts of command
I
I
functions: (a) to inhibit branching; and (b) to determine
an asymmetry in that branch which can only come into
existence at all if the centro-peripheral gradient is absent.
If these two sorts of message functions can be shown to
overlap or be in some sense synonymous, we shall have
generated an economical hypothetical description of the
phenomena.
We therefore address ourselves to the question: Is there
an a priori case for expecting that the absence of a gradient
which would prohibit branching in the primary leg will
permit the formation of a branch which will lack the informa-
tion necessary to determine asymmetry across a plane at righ.t
angles to the missing gradient?
The question must be inverted to fit the upside-down-
ness of all cybernetic explanation. The concept "information
necessary to determine asymmetry" then becomes "informa-
tion necessary to prohibit bilateral symmetry."
But anything which "prohibits bilateral symmetry" will
also "prohibit branching," since the two components of a
branching structure constitute a symmetrical pair
(even
though the components may be radially symmetrical).
It therefore becomes reasonable to expect that loss or
blurring of a centro-peripheral gradient which prohibits
bran~ formation will permit the formation of a branch
which will, however, itself be bilaterally symmetrical about
a plane parallel to the circumference of the primary limb.
Meanwhile, within the primary limb, it is possible that
a centro-peripheral gradient, by preventing branch forma-
tion, could have a function in preserving a previously deter-
mined asymmetry.
The above hypotheses provide a possible framework of
explanation of the formation of the supernumerary doublet
and the bilateral symmetry within it. It remains to consider
the orientation of the components of that doublet. According

(The argument fQr this expectation may be spelled. out
as follows: a gradient in a lineal sequence creates a
diffe~­
ence between
the
two
ends
of
the
sequence. If
this
gradient is not present, then the ends of the sequence will
be similar, i.e., the sequence will be symmetrical about a
plane of symmetry transverse to itself. Or, consider the case

As ~oted above, the supernumerary doublets may origi-
nate from any face of the primary leg, and therefore all
intermediates occur between the expectedly discontinuous
types of loss of information. It follows that. if bilat~ral sym-
metry in these doublets is due to loss of mformation, ~en
the information lost cannot be classified as antero-postenor,
dorso-ventral, or proximo-distal.
The hypothesis must therefore be corrected:
.
Let us retain the general notion of lost information, 'and
the corollary of this that the plane of bilateral symme?"r
must be at right angles to the direction of the information
that was lost.
.
The next simplest hypothesis suggests that the lost. info~­
mation must have been centro-peripheral. (1 here retam this
bipolar term rather than use the simpler "radial.")
.
Let us imagine, then, some centro-peripheral ~.erence

cross section of the primary leg; and suppose that. the loss
or blurring of this difference at some point along ~e length
of the primary leg determines that any branch limb pro-
duced at this point shall fail to achieve asymmetry.
It will follow, naturally, that such a branch limb (if pro-
duced) will be bilaterally symmetrical and that it~ pl~ne of

One schematic paradigm will suffice: if the right anterior

point of insertion. The secondary will be a mirror image of

the primary, and may even later develop a tertiary which
I
will typically be formed outside the secondary, i.e., on that
side of the secondary which is farthest from the primary.
The formation of the left primary on the right side of the
body is explained9 by assuming that antero-posterior orien-
tation is received by the lilnb bud earlier than dorsa-ventral
information, and that, once received, this antero-posterior
information is irreversible. It is supposed that the graft is
already antero-posteriorly determined at the time of grafting
but later receives dorso-ventral information from the tissues
with which it is now in contact. The result is a limb whose
dorso-ventral orientation is correct for its new setting but
whose antera-posterior orientation is reversed. It is tacitly
assumed that the proximo-distal orientation of the bud is
undisturbed. The result is a limb which is reversed in re-
gard to one of its three sorts of 'asymmetry. Such a limb must
logically be a left.

reduplications.

without overlapping, our explanations will commonly be
insufficient, failing to explain the facts of biological inte-
gration.
We know little about how the pathways of evolutionary
change are influenced by such morphogenetic and physiol~g­
ical redundancies. But certainly such internal redundancIes
must impose nonrandom characteristics upon the phenomena
of variation.7

tion of Double Limbs in Amphibians," Journal of Ex-

At this point. it is interesting to turn from analysis of
reduplication in beetles' legs to another body of data in
which reduplication commonly occurs and has been referred
to Bateson's Rule.s These are the data on reduplication in
the experimentally transplanted limbs of larval newts.
(1) There are some cases, mostly of heterotopic trans-
plants in which the grafted limb bud develops into a simple
and apparently equal binary system, in which the two
components are in mirror image symmetry. I was shown
about three years ago a very striking preparation by Dr.
Emerson Hibbard of the California Institute of Technology•.
In this specimen th'e limb bud had been rotated -through

, so that the anterior edge of the bud faced toward the
posterior end -of the host, and had been implanted in a
median
dorsal position on
the posterior region
of the
head of the host. This transplant had -developed Jnto two
remarkably complete legs in mirror image relationship. This
binary system was connected to the head of the host only
by a slender bridge of tissue.

Such preparations, where the product IS bmary and the
parts equal, certainly look like what would be expect?d from
a simple loss of one dimension of orienting information. (It

This essay on the symmetry of reduplicated lateral ap-
pendages starts from an explanatory principle, viz., that any
step of ontogenetic diHerentiation which reduces the sym-
metry of an organ (e.g.• from radial to bilateral symmetry or
fr~m
~ila~eral sYJl.UDetry to asymmetry) requires
additi~nal
onentmg information. From this principle it is argued that a

ess~ pIece of onenting information, will only be able to
achi~ve bilateral symmetry, i.e.• instead of a normal asym-
metrIcal appendage, the result will be a bilaterally symmetri-

To examine tIlls explanatory principle, the writer has at-
temp~ed to co~s~ct a hypothesis to explain Bateson's Rule

to another, and that each transform or code is subject to
characteristic limitations:

right side of the body but it did not soHer from such a
deficiency of information as would make it immediately fail
to achieve asymmetry. The reduplication cannot simply be
ascribed to loss of orienting information in the primary.
(b) The reduplications in beetles' legs may occur at
any ~int along the length of the leg. But those of amphibian
larvae usually arise from the region of attachment of the
limb to the body. It is not even sure that the secondary
always shares tissue with the primary.

COMMENT ON PART IV
The papers placed together in this part are diverse in that
while each paper is a branch from the main stem of the argument
of the: book, these branches come off from very different locations.
"The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution" is an expansion of the
thought behind "Minimal Requirements for a Theory of Schizo-
phrenia," while "Problems in Cetacean .and Other Mammalian
Communication" is an application of "The Logical Categories of
Learning and Communication" to a particular type of animal.
"A Re-examination of Bateson's Rule" may seem to break new
ground, but is related to the remainder of the book in that it ex-
.tends the notion of informational control to include the field of
morphogenesis and, by discussing what happens in absence of
needed information, brings out the importance of the context into
which information is received.
. Samuel Butler, with uncanny insight, once commented upon the
analogy between dreams and parthenogenesis. We may say that
the, monstrous double legs of the beetles share in this analogy: they
are the projection of the receptive context deprived of information
which should have come from an external source.
Message material, or information, comes out of a context into
a context, and in other parts of the book the focus has been on
the context out of ,which information came. Here the focus is
rather upon the internal state of the organism as a context·into
which the information must be received.
Of course, neither foGUS is sufficient by itself for our under-
standing of either animals or men. But it is perhaps not an acci-
dent that in these papers dealing with non-human organisms the
"context" which is discussed is the obverse or complement of the

this case, the info~ationpassed on by the method of shared
periphery will be necessarily inverted: if the primary be a
right, the branch will be a left.
(c) The information in morphological form being (by
.hypothesis) unable to inhibit branching, the asymmetry of
a growing primary must be preserved by a centro-peripheral
gradient-not itself a determinant of that asymmetry.
(d) It is suggested that the loss of such a centro-periph-
eral gradient ,might have. two effects: that of permitting
branching and that of depriving the resulting branch of
one dimension of necessary orienting information; so that
the brandh can only be a bilaterally symmetrical unit with
a plane of symmetry at right angles to the 'lost centro-
peripheral gradient.
The data on reduplication in the experimentally trans-
planted limb buds of amphibia are also examined. It is
argued that these data are not to be explained by simple
loss of orienting information. Simple loss, it is sugg,ested, will
expectably result in equal and synchronous bilateral sym-'
metry. The amphibian reduplicates are, in general, unequal
and successive. In a few cases, synchronous and equal re-
duplication occurs in the amphibian experiments, especially
in heterotopic implants. Such cases could perhaps be re-
garded as due to simple loss of orienting information.

Consider the case of the unfertilized frog's egg for which the
.
entry point of the spermatozoo.n defines the plane of bilateral
,
symmetry of the future embryo.
The prick of a hair from a camel's hair brush can be substi-
tuted and still carry the same message. From this it seems that. the
.:1
external context out of which the message comes is relatively un-
i..I
defined. From the entry point alone, the egg learns but little about
.~ i
the external world. But the internal context into which the mes-
-1
sage comes must be exceedingly complex.
1
The unfertilized egg, then, embodies an Immanent question
to which the entry point of spermatozoon provides an answer; and
this way of stating the matter is the contrary or obverse .of the
conventional view, which would see the external context of
learning as a "question" to which the "right" behavior of the
organism is an answer.
We cliIl even begin to list some of the components of the im-
manent question. First there are the already existing poles of the
egg and, necessarily, some polarization of the intervening proto-
plasm towards these poles. Without some such structural con-
ditions for the receipt of the prick of the spermatozoon, this mes-
sage could have no meaning. The message must come into an ap-
propriate structure.
But structure alone is not enough. It seems probable that any
meridian of the frog's egg can potentially become the plane of
bilateral symmetry and that, in this, all meridians are alike. It
follows that there is, to this extent, no structural diHerence be-
tween them. But every meridian must be ready for the activating
message, its "readiness" being given direction but otherwise un-
restricted by structure.
Readiness,
in fact,
is
precisely
not-
structure. If and when the spermatozoon delivers its message, new
structure is generated.
In terms of the economics of flexibility; discussed in "The Role
of Somatic Change in Evolution" and later in "Ecology
~d
Flexibility in Urban Civilization" (Part VI), this "readiness" is
uncommitted potentiality for change, and we note here that this
uncommitted potentiality is not only always·finite in quantity but
must be appropriately located in a structural matrix, which also
..
must be quantitatively finite at any given time.
·1
These considerations lead naturally into Part V, which I have

titled "Epistemology and Ecology." Perhaps "epistemology" is
only another word for the study of the ecology of mind.

Cybernetic Explanation*
It may be useful to describe some of the peculiarities of
cybernetic explanation.
Caus,al explanation is usually positive. We say that billiard
ball B moved in such and such a direction because billiard
ball A hit it at s~ch and such an angle. In contrast to this,
cybernetic explanation is always negative. We consider what
alternative possibilities could conceivably have occurred and
then ask why many of the alternatives were not followed, so
that the particular event was one of those few which could,
in fact, occur. The classical example of this type 'of explana-
tion is the theory of evolution under natural selection. Ac-
cording to this theory, those organisms which were not both
physiologically and environmentally viable could not possibly
have 'lived to reproduce. Therefore, evolution always fol-
lowed the pathways of viability. As Lewis Carroll has pointed
out, the theory explains quite satisfactorily why there are
no bread-and-butter-flies today.
In cybernetic language, the course of events is said to be
subject to restraints, and it is assumed that, apart from such
restraints,the pathways of change would be governed only
by equality of probability. In fact, the "restraints" upon
which cybernetio explanation depends can in all cases be
regarded as factors w:hich determine inequality of prob-

ability. If we flnd a monkey striking a typewriter apparently
at random but in fact writing meaningful prose, we shall
look for restraints, either inside the moneky or inside the
typewriter. Perhaps the monkey could' not strike inappro-
priate letters; perhaps the type bars could not move if im-
properly struck; perhaps incorrect letters could not survive
on the paper. Somewhere there must have been a circuit
which could identify error and eliminate it.
Ideally-and commonly-the actual event in any
se-
,quence or aggregate is uniquely determined within the
terms' of the cybernetic explanation. Restraints of many' dif-
ferent kinds may cOn'1b~e to generate this unique determina-
tion. For example, the selection of a piece for a given position
in a jigsaw puzzle is "restrained" by many factors. Its shape
must conform to that 'of its several neighbors and pOSSibly
that of the boundary of the puzzle; its color must conform
to the color pattern of its region; the orientation of its edges
must obey the topolOgical regularities set by the cutting
machine in which the puzzle was made; and so on.. From
the point of view of the man who is trying to solve the pUz.-
zle, these are, all clues, i.e., sources of information which
will guide him in his selection. From the point of view of the
cybernetic observer, they are restraints.
Similarly, from the cybernetic point of view, a word in a
sentence, or a letter within the word, or the anatomy of
some part within an organism, or the role of a species in an
ecosystem, or the behavior of a member within a, family-
these are all to be (negatively) explained by an analysis of
restraints.
,
The negative form of these explanations is precisely com-
parable to the form of logical proof by reductio ad absurdum.
In this species of proof, a sufficient set of mutually exclusive
alternative propositions is enumerated, e.g., "P" and "not P,"
and the process of proof procedes by demonstrating that all
but one of this set are untenable or "absurd," It follows that
the surviving member of the set must be tenable within the
terms of the logical system. This is a form of proof which the
nonmathematical sometimes flnd unconvinGing and, no doubt,
the theory of natural selection sometimes seems unconvinc-
ing to nonmathematical persons for similar reasons-what-,
ever those reasons may be.

concrete~y, ~hen a computer is used to simulate a complex
commum.cati~nal ~roc~s. But this is not the only appearance
of mappmg m this SCIence. Formal processes of mapping,
translatiOn, or transformation are, in principle, imputed to
eve~ st~p of any ~equence of phenomena which the cyber-
neti<flSt IS attempting to explain. These' mappings or trans-
formations may be very complex, e.g., where the output of
some machine is r~garded as a transform of the input; or
they may be very sunple, e.g., where the rotation of a shaft
at a ~~en p~int alo?g its length is regarded as a transform
(albeIt Identical) of Its rotation at some previous point.
The relations which remain constant under such transfor-
mation may be of any conceivable kind.
. This p~allel, between cybernetic explanation and the tac-
?cs of lOgIcal or mathematical proof, is of more than trivial
mterest. Outsi~e of crbernetics, we look for explanation, but
,n.ot for. anything w?ich would simulate logical proof. This
s~ula~on ?f proo~ IS something new. We can say, however,
WIth hindsIght WISdom, that explanation by simulation of
logi~al or mathematical proof was expectable. After all, the
subject matter of cybernetics is not events and objects but
t?e
informa~ion"carried" by events and objects. We con-
s~der the objects or events only as proposing facts, proposi-
tions, messages, percepts, and the like. The subject matter
being propositional, it is expectable that explanation would

Because the subject matter of cybernetics is the propo-

different from those of the other sciences. The differentia-

central explanatory quantity, information, is of zero dimen-
sions. Quantities of real dimensions (mass, length, time) and
their derivatives

cybernetic explanation.
The status of energy is of special interest. 'In general in
communicational systems, we deal with sequences which re-
semble stimulus-and-response rather than cause-and-eHect.
When one billiard ball strikes another, there is an energy
transfer such that the motion of the second ball is energized
by the impact of the first. In 'communicational systems, on the
other hand, the energy of the response is usually provided by
the respondent. H I kick a dog, his immediately sequential
behavior is energized by his metabolism, not by my kick.
Similarly, when one neuron fires another, or an impulse from
a microphone activates a circuit, the sequent event has its
own energy sources.
Of course, everything that happens is still within the
limits defined by the law of energy conservation. The dog's
metabolism might in the end limit his response, but, in gen-
eral, in the systems with which we deal, the energy supplies
are large compared with the demands upon them; and, long
before the supplies are exhausted, "economic" limitations
are imposed by the finite number of available alternatives,
I.e., there is an economics of probability. This economics

ability-being a ratio-is not subject to addition or subtrao-
tion but only to multiplicative processes, such as fraction-
ation. A telephone exchange at a time of emergency may be
"jammed" when a large fraction of its alternative pathways
are busy. There is, then, a low probability of any given mes-
sage getting through.
In addition to the restraints due to the limited economics
of alternatives, two other categories of restraint must be dis-
cussed: restraints related to "feedback" and restraints related
to "redundancy."
We consider first the concept of feedback:

chains of causation. In certain regions of this universe (no-

Similarly, the whole matter of induction and deduction

will take on a new significance when we recognize inductive
and deductive steps not only in our own argument but in the
relationships among data.

Of especial interest in this connection is the ;elationship
between context and its content. A phoneme eXIsts as such
only in combination with other phonemes which make up a
word. The word is the context of the phoneme. But the
word only exists as such-only has "meaning"-in the larger
context of the utterance, which again has meaning only in
a relationship.
This hierarchy of contexts within contexts is universal for .
the communicational (or "emic") aspect of phenomena and
drives the scientist always to seek for explanation in the ever
larger units. It may

determines which' letters shall occur in whi:h slots. As. a
result: if the receiver of the message had received the ~ntire

letter K which we are discussing, he might have been. a~le,
with better than random success, to guess. that the mlssmg
letter was, in fact, K. To the extent that this was so, the let-
ter K did" not, for that receiver, exclude the other twenty-
five letters because these were already partly excluded by
information which the recipient received from the
r~st of
the message. This patterning or predictability. of parti.cular
events within a larger aggregate of events
IS technically
called "redundancy."

information
pad.
Evidently, the nature of "meaning," pattern, redundancy,
information and the like, depends upon where we sit. In
the usual engineers' discussion of a message sent from A
to B, it is customary to omit the observer and to say that B
received information from A which was measurable in terms
of the number of letters transmitted, reduced by such re-
dundancy in the text as might have permitted B to do some
guessing. But in a wider ul)iverse, i.e., that defined by the
point'of view of the observer, this no longer appears as a
"transmission" of information but rather as a spreading of
redundancy. The activities of A and B have combined to
make the universe of the observer ~ore predictable, more
ordered, and more redundant. We may say that the rules of
the "game" played by A and B explain (as "restraints")
what would otherwise be a puzzling and improbable coin-
cidence in the observer's universe, namely the conformity be-
tween what is written on the two message pads.
To guess, in essence, is to face a cut or slash in the
sequence of items and to predict across that slash what
items might be on the other side. The slash may be spatial
or temporal
(or both)
and the guessing may be either
predictive or retrospective. A pattern, in fact, is definable
as an aggregate of events or objects which will permit in
some degree such guesses when the entire aggregate is not
available for inspection.
But this sort of patterning is also a very general phenom-
enon, outside the realm of communication between orga-
nisms. The reception of message material by one organism is
not fundamentally different from any other case ofpercep-
tion. If I see the top part of a tree standing up, I can predict
-with better than random success-that the tree has roots
in the ground. The percept of the tree top is redundant
with (i.e., contains "information" about) parts of the system
which I cannot perceive owing to the slash provided by the
opacity of the ground.
If then we say that a messageohas "meaning" or is "about"
some referent, what we mean is that there is a larger uni-
verse of relevance consisting of message-plus-referent, and
that redundancy or pattern or predictability is .introduced
into this universe by t,he message.

If I say to you "It is raining," this message introduces re-
dundancy into the universe, message-pIus-raindrops, so that
from the message alone you could have guessed-with better
than random success-something of what you would see if
you looked out of the window. The universe, message-plus-
referent, is given pattern or form-in the Shakespearean
sense, the universe is informed by the message; and the
"form" of which we are speaking is not in the message nor
is it in the referent. It is a correspondence between mes-
sage and referent.
In loose talk, it seems simple to locate information. The
letter K in a given slot proposes that the letter in that
particular slot is a K. And, so long as all information is of
this'very direct kind, the information' can be "located": the
information about the letter K is seemingly in that slot.
The inatter is not quite so simple if the text of the mes-
sage is redundant but, if we are lucky and the redundancy
is of low order, we may still be able to point to paI!S of the
text which indicate (carry some of the information) that the
letter K is expectable in that partlcularslot.
But if we are asked: Where are such items of information
as that:
(a) "This message is in English"; and (b) "In
English, a letter K often follows a letter C, except when the
C begins a word"; we can only say that such information is
not localized in any part~of the text but is rather a statistical
induction from the text as a whole (or perhaps from an
aggregate of "similar" texts). This, after all, is metainforma-
tion and is of a basically different order-of different logical
type-from the information that "the letter in this-slot is K," .
This matter of the localization of information has be-
deviled communication theory' and especially neurophysiolo-
gy for many years and it is, therefore, interesting to consider
how the matter looks if we start from redundancy, pattern
or form as the basic concept.
It is flatly obvious that no variable of zero dimensions
can be truly located. "Information" and "form" resemble con-

conformity, and the like in being of zero dimensions and,
therefore, are not to be located. The contrast between this

delimit regions of the aggregate within which the observer
can achieve. be~ter .than random guessing. A further step
t0v.:ard lo.calization IS accomplished by cutting across these
regtons WIth slash marks, such that it is across these that the
educated observer can guess, from what is on one side of the
slash, something of what is on the other side.
.
Such a mapping of the distribution of patterns is
how-
e.ver, in principle, incomplete because we have
n~t con-
SIdered the sources of the observer's prior knowledge of the
re~undancy rules. If, now, we consider an observer with no
pnor knowledge, it is clear that he might discover some of
the relevant rules from his perception of less than the whole
aggregate. He cOl;lld then use his discovery in predicting
rules for the remamder-rules which would be correct even
though not exemplified. He might discover that "H often
follo~s T" even though the remainder of the aggregate
contamed no example of this combination. For this order of
phenomenon a different order of slash mark-metaslashes
-will be necessary.
It is interesting to note that metaslashes which demarcate'
what is necessary for the naive observer to discover a rule
are, in principle, displaced relative to the slashes which

To the aesthetic eye, the form of a crab with one claw big-
ger than. the other is not simply asymmebical. It first pro-
poses a rule of symmetry and then subtly denies the rule by
proposing a more complex combination of rules.)
When we exclude all things and all real dimensions from
our explanatory system, we are left regarding each step in a
communicational sequence as a transform of the previous
step. H we consider the passage of an impulse along an
axon, we shall regard the events at each point along the
pathway as a transform (albeit identical or similar) of events
at any previous point. Or" if we consider a series of neurons,
each firing the next, then the firing of each neuron is a
transform of the firing of its predecessor. We deal with event
sequences which do not necessarily imply a passing on of
the same energy.
Similarly, we can consider any network of neurons, and
arbitrarily transect the whole network at a series of different
positions, then we shall regard the events at each transec-
tion as a transform of events at some previous transection.
In considering perception, we shall not say, for example,
"I see a tree," because the tree is not within our explanatory
system. At best, it is only pOSSible to see an image which is a
complex but systematic transform of the tree. This image, of
course, is energized by my metabolism and the nature of the
transform is, in part, determined by factors wit:l$ my neural
circuits: "I" make the image, under various restraints, some
of which are imposed by my neural circuits, while others are
imposed by the external tree. An hallucination or dream
would be more truly «mine" insofar as it is produced without
immediate external resb·aints.
'
All that is not Information, not redundancy, not forniand
not restraints-is noise, the only pOSSible source of new
patterns.
Redundancy and Coding*
Discussion of the evolutionary and other relationships be-
tween the communication systems of men and those of other
animals has made it very clear that the coding devices
characteristic of verbal
communication differ profoundly
from those of kinesics and paralanguage. But the point has
been made that there isa great deal of resemblance between
the codes of kinesics and paralanguage and the codes of
nonhuman mammals.
We may, I think, state categorically that man's verbal
system is
no~
d~rived in any
s~ple way from these pre-
ponderantly lcomc codes. There IS a general popular belief
that in the evolution of man, language replaced the cruder
systems of the oilier animals. I believe this to be totally
wrong and would argue as follows:

vis-a-vis or between self and environment and that the na-
ture of human society is such that falsification of this dis-
course rapidly becomes pathogenic. From an adaptive point
of view, it is therefore important that this discourse be
carried on by techniques which are relatively unconscious
and only imperfectly subject to voluntary control. In the
language of neurophysiology, the controls of this discourse
must be placed in the brain caudad of the controls of true
language.
If this general view of the matter be correct, it must follow
that to translate kinesics or. paralinguistic messages into
words is likely to introduce gross falsification due not merely
to the human propensity for trying to falsify statements about
"feelings" and relationship and to the distortions which
arise whenever the products of one system of coding are
dissected onto the premises of another, but especially to the
fact that all such translation must give to the more or less
unconscious and involuntary iconic message the appearance
of conscious intent.
As scientists, we are concerned to build a simulacrum of
the phenomenal universe in words. That is, our product is
to be a verbal transform of the phenomena. It is necessary,
therefore, to examine rather. carefully the rules of this trans-
formation and the differences in coding between natural
phenomena, message phenomena, and words. I know that
it is unusual to presume a "coding" of nonliving phenomena
and, to justify this phrase, I must expand somewhat on the
concept of "redundancy" as this word is used by the commu-
nications engineers.
.
The
engineers
and mathematicians have
concentrated
their attention rigorously upon the internal structure of
message material. Typically, this material consists of a se-
o quence or collection of events or objects (commonly mem-
bers of finite sets-phonemes and the like). This sequence
is differentiated from irrelevant events or objects occurring
in the same region of time-space by the signal/noise ratio and
by other characteristics. The message material is said to
contain "redundancy" if, when the sequence is received with
some items missing, the receiver is able to guess at the miss-
ing items with better than random success. It has been
pointed out that, in fact, the term "redundancy" so used be-
l

It,r
I't__
I

ll
414
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
comes a synonym for "patterning."1 It is important to note
that this patterning of message material always helps the
receiver to diHerentiate between sigtlal and noise. In fact,
the regularity called sigtlallnoise ratio is really only a special
case of redundancy. Camouflage (the opposite of communi-·
cation) is achieved (1) by reducing thesigtlaI/noise ratio,
(2 )by breaking up the patterns and regularities in the sig-
nal, or (3) by introducing similar patterns into the noise.
By confining their attention to the internal structure of
the message material, the engineers believe that they can
avoid the complexities and difficulties introduced into co:rrunu-
nication theory by the concept of "meaning." I would argue,
however, that the concept "redundancy" is at least a partial
synonym of "meaning." As I see it, if the receiver can guess
at missing parts of the message, then those parts which are
received must, in fact, carry a meaning which refers' to the
missing parts and is information about those parts.
H now we turn away from the narrow universe of mes-
sage structure and consider the outer world of natural phe-
nomena, we observe at once that this outer world is similarly
characterized by redundancy, i.e., that when an observer
perceives only certain parts of a sequence or configuration
of phenomena, he is in many cases able to guess, with better
than random success, at the parts which he cannot immedi-
ately perceive. It is, indeed, a principal goal of the scientist
to elucidate these redundancies or patternings of the phe-
nomenal world.
H we now consider that larger' universe of which these
two subuniverses are parts, i.e., the 'system: message plus
external phenomena, we find that this larger system contains
redundancy of a very special sort. The observer's ability
to predict external phenomena is very much increased by
his receipt of message material. H I tell you that "it is raining"
and you look out the window, you will get less information
from the perception of raindrops than you would have got
had you never received my message. From my message
you could have guessed that you would see rain.
In sum, "redundancy" and "meaning" become synonymous
whenever both words are applied to the same universe of

Psychology, New York, Henry Holt and Co., 1959.

discourse. "Redundancy" within the restricted universe of
,t}te m~s~g~
sequ~ce is
~ot, of course, synonymous with
meanmg' In the WIder urnverse that includes both message
and external referent.
.It ~ll be noted that this way of thinking about commu-
IDeation groups all methods of coding under the single
~bric of part-for-whole. The verbal message "It is raining"
IS to be seen as a part of a larger universe within which
~at"mess~ge cre~t~ red~.dan~"or pr~ctability. The "dig-
Ital,, the
analoglC,
the
ICOIDC,
the
metaphoric," and all
other methods of coding are subsumed under this single
heading.•(What the grammarians call "synecdoche" is the
metaphonc use of the name of a part in place of the name
of th~ whole, as in the phrase "five head of cattle.")
This approach to the matter has certain advantages: the
analyst is forced at all times to define ilie universe of dis-
course within which "redundancy" or "meaning" is supposed
to occur. He is.forced to examine ilie "logical typing" of all
message matenal. We shall see that this broad view of
the matter makes it easy to identify major steps in ilie
evolution of communication. Let us consider the scientist who
is o?serving two animals in a physical environment. The fol-
lowmg components then must be considered:
• (1) The physical environment contains internal pattern-
mg or redundancy, I.e., the perception of certain events or
objects makes other events or objects predictable for the
animals and/or for the observer.
. (2) Sounds or other sigtlals from one animal may con-
tribute redundancy to the system, environment plus signal;
i.e., the sigtlals may be "about" the environment.
(3) The sequence of sigtlals will certainly contain redun-
'dancy-one sigtlal from an animal making another sigtlal
from the same animal more predictable.
'
(4) The sigtlals may contribute redundancy to the uni-
verse; A's signals plus B'a signals, I.e., the signals may be
about the interaction of which they are component parts.
(5) H all rules or codes of animal communication and
understanding· were genotypically fixed, _the list would end
at this point. But some animals are capable of learning,
e.g., the repetition of sequences may lead to their becom-
ing effective as patterns. In logic, "every proposition proposes
its own truth," but in natural history we deal always with a

~16
Steps tv an Eoology of Mind
~-
converse of this generalization. The perceivable events which
accompany a given percept propose· that that perc~pt shall
"mean" these events. By some such steps an orgarusm may
learn to use the information contained in patterned se-
quences of external events. I can therefore predict with bet-
ter than random succeSs that in the universe, organism
plus environment, events will occur. to complete
patt~rns
or configurations of learned adaptation between organIsm
and environment.
(6) The behavioral "learning" which is usually studied
in psychological laboratories is of a different order.:rhe
redundancy of that universe, which consists of the animal's
actions plus external events, is increased, from the
anima~'s
point of view, when the animal regularly responds to certam
events with certain actions. Similarly, this universe gains re-
dundancy when the animal succeeds in producing those
actions which function as regular precursors (or causes) of
specific external events.
(7) For every organism there are limitations and regu-
!.
larities which define what will be learned and under what
circumstances this learning will occur. These regularities and
patterns become basic premises for the individual adaptation
and social organization of any species.
(8) Last but not least, there is the matter of phylo-
genetic learning and phylogeny in general. There is re-
dundancy in the system, organism-plus-environment, such
that from the morphology and behavior of the organism a
human observer can guess with better than random success
at the nature of the environment. This "information" about
the environment has become lodged in the organism through
a long phylogenetic process, and its coding is of a very special
kind. The observer who would learn about the aquatic
environment. from the shape of a shark must deduce the
hydrodynamics from the adaptation which copes with the
water. The information contained in the phenotypic shark
is implicit in forms which are complementary to characteris-
tics of other parts of the universe, phenotype plus environ-
ment whose redundancy is increased by the phenotype.
This very brief and incomplete survey of some of the sorts
of redundancy in biological systems and the universes of
their relevance indicates that under the general rubric "part-
for-whole" a number of different sorts of relationship between
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
417
. part and whole are included. A listing of some of the charac-
teristics of these formal relations is in order. We consider
some of the iconic cases:
(1) The events or objects which we here call the "part"
or "signal" may be real components of an existing sequence
or whole. A standing trunk of a tree indicates the probable
presence of invisible roots. A cloud may indicate the corning
storm of which it is a part. The bared fang of a dog may be
part of a real attack.
(2) The. "part" may have only a conditional relationship
to its whole: the cloud may indicate that we shall get wet
if we don't go indoors; the bared fang may be the begin-
ning of an attack which will be completed unless certain
conditions are met.
(3) The "part" may be completely split from the whole
which is its referent. The bared fang at the given instant
may mentUm an attack which, if and when it occurs, will
include a new baring of the fangs. The "part" has now
became a true iconic signal.
(4) Once a true iconic signal has evolved-not neces-
sarily through steps 1, 2, or 3, above-a variety of other
pathways of evolution become possible:
(a) The "part" may become more or less digitalized, so
that magnitudes within it no longer refer to magnitudes
within the whole which is its referent. but, for example,
contribute to an improvement of the signal/noise ratio.
(b) The "part" may take on special ritual or metaphOric
meanirigs in contexts where.the original whole to which it
once referred is no longer relevant. The game of mutual
mouthing between mother dog and puppy which once fol-
lowed her weaning of the pup may become a ritual aggre-
gation. The actions of feeding a baby bird may become a
ritual of courtship, etc.
Throughout this serles, whose branches ·and varieties are
here only briefly indicated, it is notable that animal commu-
nication is confined to signals which are derived from actions
of the animals themselves, t.e., those which are parts of such
actions. The external universe is, as already noted, redun-
dant in the sense that it is replete with part-for-whole
messages, and-perhaps for that reason-this basic style
of coding is characteristic of primitive .animal communi-
cation. But in so far as animals can signal at all about the
l

418
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
external universe, they do so by means of actions -which are
parts of their response to that universe. The jackdaws indi-
cate to each other that Lorenz is a "jackdaw-eater" -not by
simulating some part of the act of eating jackdaws but by
simulating part of their aggression vis-a-vis such a creature.
Occasionally actual pieces of the external. environment-
scraps of potential nest-building material, "trophies," and ~e
like-are used for communication, and in these cases agam
the messages usually contribute redundancy to the universe

In terms of evolutionary theory, it is not simple to ex-
plain why over .and over again genotypic controls have
been evolved to determine such iconic signaling. From the
point of view of the human observ?r such icon~c si~als ~re
rather easy to interpret, and we might expect IC~ruC coding
to be comparatively easy for animals todecode-m so. far as
the animals must leam to do so. But the genome
IS pre-
sumed not capable of learning in this sense, and we might
therefore
expect
genotypically. determined signals
to be
aniconic or arbitrary rather than iconic.
Three possible explanations of the iconic nature of geno-
typic signals can be offered:
(1) Even genotypically determined signals do not occur
as separate and isolated elements in the life of the phenotype
but are necessarily components in a complex matrix of be-
havior some, at least, of which is learned. It is possible that
the iconic coding of genotypically determined signals ren-
ders these easy to assimilate into this matrix. Th~re may be
an experiential "schoolmarm" which acts selectively to favor
those genotypic changes which will give rise to iconic rather
than arbitrary signaling.
(2) A signal of aggression which places the signaler in
a position of readiness to attack probably has more survival
value than would a more arbitrary signal.
(3)
When the genotypically determined signal affects
the behavior of another species-e.g., eye marks or postures
which have a warning effect, movements· which facilitate-
camouHage or aposematic mimicry-clearly the signal must
be iconic to the perceptive system of that other species.
However, an interesting phenomenon arises in many instances
where what is achieved is a secondary statistical iconicism.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
419
LabroUles dimidiatus, a small Indo-Pacific wrasse, which
lives on the ectoparasites of other fishes, is strikingly colored
and moves or "dances" in a way which is easiiy recognized.
No doubt these characteristics attract other fish and are
part of a signaling system which leads the other fish to
permit the approaches of the cleaner. But there is a mimic
of this species of Labroides, a saber-toothed blenny (Aspi-
da;'tus tae.~tus), whose similar coloring and movement per-
mIt the mImiC to approach-and bite off pieces of the fins of
other fishes. 2
Clearly the coloring and movements of the mimic are
iconic and "represent" the cleaner. But what of the coloring
~nd movements of the latter? All that is primarily required
IS that the cleaner be conspicuous or distinctive. It is not
required that it represent something else. But when we
consider the statistical aspects of the system, it becomes clear
that if the blennies become too numerous, the distinctive
features of the wrasses will become iconic warnings and
their hosts will avoid them. What is necessary is that the
signals of the wrasse shall clearly and indubitably represent
wrass.e, i.e., the
sig~als, though perhaps aniconic in the
first lDstance, must achieve and maintain by multiple im-
pact a sort of autoiconicism. ''When I say it three times it
is true." But this necessity for autoiconicism may also a;ise
within the species. Genotypic control of signaling ensures
the necessary repetitiveness (which might be only fortuitous
if the signals had to be learned).
(4) .Th~re is a case for asserting that the genotypic
deterrnmation of adaptive characteristics is, in a speci~l sense,
more economical than the achievement of similar character-
istic by somatic change or phenotypic learning. This matter
has been. argued elsewhere.8 Briefly it is asserted that the
somatic adaptive flexibility and/or learning capacity of any
organism is limited and that the demands placed upon these
capacities will be reduced by genotypic change in any
appropriate direction. Such changes would therefore have

survival value because they set free precious adaptive or
learning capacity for other uses. This amounts to an argument
for Baldwin effects. An extention of this argument would
suggest that the iconic character of genotypically controlled
signaling characteristics may, in some cases, be explained
by supposing that these characteristics were once learned.
(This hypothesiS does not, of course, imply any sort of La-
marckian inheritance. It is obvious (1) that to fix: the value
of any variable in a homeostatic circuit by such inheritance
would soon gum up the homeostatic system of the body,
and (2) that no amount of modification ,of the dependent
variables in a homeostatic circuit will change the bias of the
circuit.)
(5) Last, it is unclear at what level genotypic determina-
tion of behavior might act. It was suggested above that
iconic codes are easier for an organism to leam than more
arbitrary codes. It is possible that the genotypic contribution
to such an organism might take the form, not· of fixing the
given behavior, but rather of making this behavior easier
to leam-a change in specific learning capacity rather than
a change in genotypically determined behavior. Such a con-
tribution from the genotype would have obvious advantages
in that it would work along with ontogenetic change instead
of working possibly at cross-purposes with it.
To sum up the argument so far:
(1) It is understandable that an early (in an evolution-
ary sense) method of creating redundancy would be the use
of iconic part-for-whole coding. The external nonbiologi-
cal uniyerse contains ,redundancy of this kind, and iIJ. evolving
a code of communication it is expectable that organisms
would fall into the same trick. We have noted that the
"part" can be split from the whole, so that a showing of
the fangs can denote a possible but as yet nonexistent fight.
All this provides an explanatory background for communi-
cation by means of "intention movements" and the like.
(2) It it partly understandable that such tricks of coding
by iconic parts might become genotypically fixed.
(3) It has been suggested that the survival of such primi-
tive (and therefore involuntary) signalling in human commu-
nication about personal relationship is explained by a need
for honesty in such matters.

But the evolution of aniconic verbal coding remains un-
explained.
We know from studies of aphasia, from Hockett's enumera-
tion at this meeting of the characteristics of language and
from elementary common sense that the component processes
of creating and understanding verbal communication are
many and that language fails when anyone of those com-
ponent processes is interrupted. It Js possible that each of
these processes should be the focus of a separate study. Here,
however, I shall consider only one aspect of the matter: the
evolution of Simple indicative assertion.
An interesting intermediate between the iconic coding of
animals and the verbal coding of human speech can be
recognized in human dreaming and human myth. In psy-
choanalytic theory, the productions of dream process are
said to be characterized by "primary-process" thinking.4
Dreams, whether verbal or not, are to be considered as
metaphoric statements, i.e.,
the referents of dream
are
relationships which the dreamer, consciously or unconscious-
ly, perceives in his waking world. As in all metaphor, the
relata remain unmentioned and in their places appear other
items such that the relationships between these substitute
items shall be the same as those between the relata in the
waking world.
To identify the relata in the waking world to which the
dream refers would convert the metaphor into a simile, and,
in general, dreams contain no message material which overt-
ly performs this function. There is no signal in the dream
which tells the dreamer that this is metaphor or what the
referent of the metaphor may be. Similarly, dream contains
no tenses. Time is telescoped, and representations of past
events in real or distorted forms may have the present as
their referent-or vice versa. The patterns of dream are
timeless.
In a theater, the audience is informed by the curtain and
the framing of the stage that the action on the stage is
"only" a play. From within that frame the p.I'0ducers and
actors may attempt to involve the audience in an illusion of
reality as seemingly direct as the experience of dream. And,

conscious of the fact of sleep, there is no curtain and no

framing of the action. The partial negative-''This is only

I suggest that this absence of metacommunicative frames
and the
persiste~c: ~ dream of pattern recognition are
archaic charactenstics m an evolutionary sense. If this be cor-
rect, then an understanding of dream should throw light
both on how iconic communication operates among animals
and on the mysterious evolutionary step from the iconic to
the verbal.
. U~der the ~it~tionimposed by the lack of a metacommu-
~~tiv?frame, It 18 clearly impossible for dream to make an
md!cative statement, either positive or negative. As there can
be no frame which labels the content as "metaphoric," so
there can be no frame to label the content as "literal" Dream

rammg" or "It is not raining." Therefore, as we have seen
the usefulness in imagining "rain" or "drought" is limited
to thett metaphoric aspects.
.
Dream can propose theapplicabillty of pattern. It can
nev~,assert or deny this applicability. Still less can it make
an mdicative statement about any identified referent, since
no referent is identified.
The pattern is the thing.
. These characteristics of dream may be archaic, but it is
~po~tant to r~em~er that they are not obsolete: that, as
kineslC and paraIingw.stic communication has been elaborated
into dance, music, and poetry, so also the logic of dream
has been elaborated into theater and art. Still more astonish.

lar sign, but these are nonmathematical and no computer
needs them. In the strictly mathematical procedure, as in
the process of dream, the pattern of relationships controls
all operations, but the relata are unidentified.
We return now to the contrast between the iconic method
of
creating redundancy
in
the
universe,
organism
plus
other organism, by the emission of parts of interactive pat-
tenlS and the linguistic device of naming the relata. We
noted above that the human communication which creates
redundancy i~ the relationships between persons is still pre-
ponderantly iconic and js achieved by means of kinesics,
paralinguistics, intention movements, actions, and the like. It
is in dealing with the universe, message plus environment,
that the evolution of verbal language has made the great-
est strides.
In animal discourse, redundancy is introduced into this
universe by signals which are iconic parts of the signaler's
probable response. The environmental items may serve an
ostensive function 'but cannot, in general, be mentioned.
Similarly, in iconic communication about relationship, the re-
lata-the organisms themselves-do not have to be identi-
fied because the subject of any predicate in this iconic dis-
course is the emitter of the signal, who is always ostensively
present.
It appears then that at least two steps were necessary to
get from the iconic use of parts of patterns of own behavior
to the naming of entities in the external environment: there
was both a change in coding and a change in the centering
of the subject-predicate frame.
To attempt to reconstruct these steps can only be specu-
lative, but some remarks may be offered:
(1) Imitation of environmental phenomena makes it pos-
sible to shift the subject-predicate frame from the seH to
some environmental entity while still 'retaining the iconic
code.
(2) A similar shifting of the
subject-predicate frame
from seH to other is latent in those interactions between ani-
mals in which A proposes a pattern of interaction and B
negates this with an iconic or ostensive "don't." The subject
of B's message here verbalized as "don't" is A.
(3) It is possible that the paradigms of interaction which
are basic to iconic signaling about relationship could serve

J,l...
:'.':

424
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
as evolutionary models for the paradigms of verbal grammar.
We should not, I suggest, think of the earliest rudiments of
verbal communication as resembling what a man does with
only a few words of a foreign language and no knowledge
of its grammar and syntax. Surely, at all stages of the evolu-
tion of language, the communication of our ancestors was
structured and formed-eomplete in itself, not' made of
broken pieces. The antecedents of grammar must surely be
as old or older than the antecedents of words.
(4) For actions of the self, iconic abbreviations are readily
available, and these control the vis-a-vis by implicit reference
to interactional paradigms. But all such communication is
necessarily positive. To show the fangs is to mention combat,
and to mention combat is to propose it. There can be no
simple iconic representation of a negative: no simple way
for an animal to say "I will not bite you." It is easy, however,
to imagine ways of communicating negative commands if
(and only if)' the other organism will first propose the pat-
tern of action which is to be forbidden. By threat, by inap-
propriate response and so on, "don't" can be communicated.
A pattern of interaction, offered by one organism, is negated
by the other, who disrupts the proposed paradigm.
But "don't" is very different from "not." Commonly, the
important message "I will not bite you" is generated as an
agreement between two organisms following
~eal or ritual
combat. That is, the opposite of the final message is worked
through to reach a reductio ad abStlrdum which can then be
the basis of mutual peace, hierarchic precedence, or sexual
relations. Many of the curious interactions of animaJs, called
"play," which resemble (but are not) combat are probably
the testing and reaffirmation of such negative agreement.
But these are cumbersome and awkward methods
of
achieving the negative.
(5) It was suggested above that the paradigms of verbal
grammar might somehow be derived from the paradigms of
interaction. We, therefore, look for the evolutionary roots
of the simple negative among the paradigms of interaction.
The matter, however, is not simple. What is known to occur
at the animal level is the simultaIieous' presentation of con-
tradictory Signals-postures which mention both aggression
and flight, and the like. These ambiguities are, however,
quite different from the phenomenon familiar among humans

425
where the ~riendli.ness of .a man's words may be contradicted
by th~ tenslO~ or,aggressiveness of 'his voice or posture. The
man IS e~gagIng In a sort of deceit, an altogether more com-
ple~ .achievemen.t, while the ambivalent animal is offering
positive alternatives. From neither of these patterns is it
easy to derive a simple "not."
-
(6), From these, considerations it appears likely that the
~v~lution of the SImple negative arose by introjection or
ImItation of the vis-a-vis, so that "not" was somehow derived
from "don't."
(7) This still leaves unexplained the shift from communi-
cation about interaction patterns to communication about
thing~ and other components of the external world. This is
the shift which determines that language would never make
obsolete the iconic communication about the contingency
patterns of personal relationship.
. Further than that we cannot at present go. It is even pos-
Sible
~at the ev?lution of verbal naming preceded the
evolution of the Simple negative. It is, however, important
t~, ,note that evolution of a Simple negative would be a de- '
~sIVe ~tep toward langua~e as we know it. This step would
~mediately endow the slgnals~be they verbal or iconic-
With a degree of separateness from their referents
which
would justify us in referring to the signals as "nam;s." The
same st~p ,,:ould make. pOSSible the use of negative aspects
of classification: those Items which are not members of an
identified class would become identifiable as nonmembers.
And, lastly, Simple affirmative indicative statements would
become possibl~.

whole Romano-Palestinian system. It is this that I am in-
terested in talking about. I do not care, here, about defend-
ing the Romans or defending the Palestinians-the
upp~r
dogs or the underdogs. I want to consider the dynamics of
the whole traditional pathology in which we are caught, and
in which we shall remain as long as we continue to struggle
within that old conflict. We just go round and round in terms
of the old premises.
Fortunately our civilization has a third root-in Greece.
Of course Greece got caught up in a rather similar mess,
but still there was a lot of clean, cool thinking of a quite
surprising kind which was different.
Let me approach the bigger problem 'historically. From
St. Thomas Aquinas to the eighteenth century in Catholic
countries, and to the Reformation among Protestants (be-
cause we threw out a lot of Greek sophistication with the
Reformation), the structure of our religion was Greek. In
mid-eighteenth century the biological world looked like this:
there was a supreme mind at the top of the ladder, which
was the basic explanation of everything downwards from
that-the supreme mind being, in Christianity, God; and
having various attributes at various philosophic stages. The
ladder of explanation went downwards deductively from the
Supreme to man to the apes, and so on, down to the in-
fusoria.
This hierarchy was a set of deductive steps from the most
perfect to the most crude or simple. And it was rigid. It was
assumed that every species was unchanging.
Lamarck, probably the greatest biologist in history, turned
that ladder of explanation upSide down. He was the man
who said it starts with the infusoria and that there were
changes leading up to man. His turning the taxonomy upside
down is one of the most astonishing feats that has ever
occurred. It was the equivalent in biology of the Copernican
revolution in astronomy.
.
The logical outcome of turning the taxonomy upside down
was that the study of evolution might provide an explana-
tion of mind.
Up to Lamarck, mind was the explanation of the biologi-
cal world. But,' hey presto, the question now arose: Is the
biological world the explanation of mind? That which was

that mental process must always have phYSICal re?resenta-
tion; and that the complexity of the nervous system IS related
to the complexity of mind.
.
There the matter rested for 150 years, mamly because
evolutionary theory was taken over, not by a Catholic heresy
but by a Protestant heresy, in the mid-nineteenth
ce~tury.
Darwin's opponents, you may rem~m~er: were not Aristotle

announced his discovery of natural ·selection, which com-
cided with Darwin's. Part of his description of the struggle
for existence is interesting:
The action of this principle [the struggle for existence]
is exactly like that of the steam engine, which checks and
corrects any irregularities almost before they
.beco~e
evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficle~cy m
the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous
magnitude, because it wo~d make .itself felt at ~e v~ry

The steam engine with a governor is simply a circular
train of causal events, with somewhere a link in that chain
~uch th~t ~e more o~ something, the less of the next thing
m the Clfcwt. The wider the balls of the governor diverge,
the less the fuel supply. If causal chains with that general
c?aracteristic are provided with energy, the result will be
(if you are lucky and things balance out) a self-corrective
system.
Wallace, in fact, proposed the first cybernetic model.
Nowadays cybernetics deals with much more complex sys-
tems of this general kind; imd we know that when we talk
about the processes of civilization, or evaluate human be-
havior, human organization, or any biological system, we are
concerned with self-corrective systems. Basically these sys-
te~s are always conservative of something. As in the engine
Wlth a governor, the fuel supply is changed to conserve-to
keep constant-the speed of the flywheel, so always in such
systems changes occur to conserve the truth of some descrip-
tive statement, some compOnent of the status quo. Wallace
saw the matter correctly, and natural selection acts primarily
to keep the species unvarying; but it may act at higher
levels to keep constant that complex variable which we call
"Survival."
Dr. Laing noted that the obvious can be very difficult
for people to see. That is because people are self-corrective
systems. They are self-corrective against disturbance, and if
the obvious is not of a kind that they can easily assimilate
without internal disturbance, their self-corrective mechanisms
work to Sidetrack it, to hide it, even to the extent of shutting
the eyes if necessary, or shutting off various parts of the
process of perception. Disturbing information can be framed
like a pearl so that it doesn't make a nuisance of itself: and
this ~ be done, according to. the understanding of the sys-
!em Itself ?f what would be a nuisance. This too-the prem-
ISe regarding what would cause disturbance-is something
which is learned and then becomes perpetuated or con-
served.
At this conference, fundamentally, we deal with three of
these enormously complex systems or arrangements of con-
servative loops. One is the human indiVidual. Its physiology
and neurology conserve body temperature, blood chemistry,

be, because you cannot do without any of the competing
organs and parts. IT any of the parts did not have the ex-
pansive characteristics they would go out, and you would

In a SOCiety, the same is true.
I think ,You have ~o ~ssume that all important physiolOgi-
calor SOCIal change IS In some degree a slipping of the sys-
tem at some point along an exponential curve. The slippage
may not g? far, or it may go to disaster. But in principle if,
say, you .kill off the thrushes in a wood, certain components
of the balance will run along exponential curves to a new
stopping place.
In such slippage there is always danger-the pOSSibility
that some Variable, e.g., population density, may reach such
a v~lue that further slippage is controlled by factors which
are inherently harmful. IT, for example, population is finally

whose
str:ucture is essentially that of a bag of tricks. Within this
SCIen~the;e is e~aordinarily little lmowledge of the sort

all that I don't argue. But still we do not know two-penn'or~

on The Wisdom of the Body, but nobody has written a book

CIsely the thing which it lacks. Wisdom I take to be the

which, if disturbed, IS likely to generate exponential curves
of change.
Consciousness operates in the same way as medicine in
its sampling of. the events and processes of the body and of
what goes on ill the total mind. It is organized in terms of
purpose. It is a short-cut device to enable you to get quickly

so on. There is a certain amount of comparbnentalization,
which is no doubt a necessary economy. There is one com-
partmentalization which is in many ways mysterious but cer-
tainly of crucial importance in man's life. I refer to the
"semipermeable" linkage between consciousness and the re-
mainder of the total mind. A certain limited amount of in-
formation about what's happening in this larger part of the
mind seems to be relayed to what we may call the screen
of consciousness. But what gets to consciousness is selected;
it is a systematic (not random) sampling of the rest.
Of course, the whole of the mind could not be reported
in a part of the miild. This follows logically from the rela-
tionship between part and whole. The television screen does
not give you total coverage or report of the events which
occur in the whole television process; and this not merely
because the viewers would not be interested in such a re-
port, but because to report on any extra part of the total
process would require extra circuitry. But to report on the
events in this extra circuitry would require a still further
addition of more circuitry, and' so on. Each additional step
toward increased consciousness will take the system farther
from total consciousness. To add a report on events in a
given part of the machine will actually deereasq the per-
centage of total events reported.
We therefore have to settle for very limited
conscious~
ness, and the question arises: How is the selecting done?
On what prinCiples does your mind select that which "you"
will be aware of? And, while not much is lmown of these
principles, something is known, though the principles at work
are often not themselves· accessible to consciousness. First of
all, much of the input is consciously scanned, but only after it
has been processed by the totally unconscious process of per-
ception. The sensory events are packaged into images and
these images are then "conscious."
I, the conscious I, see an unconsciously edited version of a
small percentage of what affects my retina. I am guided in
my perception by purposes. I see who is attending, who is
not, who' is understanding, who is not, or at least I get a
myth about this subject, which may be quite correct. I am
interested in getting that myth as I talk. It is relevant to my
purposes that you hear me.

garden, there were two anthropoids who were more intelli-
gent than the other animals.
On one of the trees there was a fruit, very high up, which
the two apes were uriable to reach. So they began to think.
That was the mistake. They began to think purposively.
By and by, the he ape, whose name was Adam, went and
gQt an empty box and put it under the tree and stepped on
it, but he found, he still couldn't reach the fruit. So he got
another box and put it on top of the first. Then he climbed
up on the two boxes and finally he got that apple.
Adam and Eve then became almost drunk with excite-
merit. This was the way to do things. Make a plan, ABC
and you get D.
'
They then began to specialize in doing things the planned
way. In effect, they cast out from the Garden the concept of
their own total systemic nature and of its total systemic na-
ture.
Mter they had cast God out of the Garden, they really
went to work on this purposive business, and pretty soon
the topsoil disappeared. Mter that, several species of plants
became "weeds" and some, of the animals became "pests";
and Adam found that gardening was much harder work.
He had to get his bread by the sweat of his brow and he
said, "It's a vengeful God. I should never have eaten that
apple."
Moreover, there occurred a qualitative change in the re-
lationship between Adam and Eve, after they had discarded
God from the Garden. Eve began to resent the business of
sex and reproduction. Whenever these rather basic phenom-
ena intruded upon her now purposive way of living, she
was reminded of the larger life which 'had been kicked out
of the Garden. So Eve began to resent sex and reproduction,
and when it came to parturition she found this process very
painful. She said this, too, was due to the vengeful nature of
God. She even heard a Voice say "In pain shalt thou bring
forth" and "Thy desire shall be unto thy husband, and he
shall rule over thee."
The biblical version of this story, from which I have bor-
rowed extensively, does not explain the extraordinary perver-
sion of values, whereby the woman's capacity for love comes
to seem a cUrse inflicted by the deity.

But you may say: "Yes, but we have lived that way

acteristic of man for at least a million years, and may have
been with us a great deal longer than that. I am not prepared
to say that dogs and cats are not conscious, still less that
porpoises are not conscious.
So you may say: "Why worry about that?"

I think that much of what brings us here to ay IS
aSI-
cally related to the thoughts that I have been putting before
you. On the one hand, we have the systemic nature of the
individual human being, the systemic nature of th~ cul~e
in which he lives, and the systemic nature of the bIOloglCal,
ecological system around him; and, on the
o.the~ .hand, the
curious twist in the systemic nature of the mdivIdual man
whereby consciousness is, almost of necessitr, blinde? to the
systemic nature of the man himself. purposl~e conscIOusness
pulls out, from the total mind, sequences which do not have
the loop structure which is characteristic of the whole sys-
temic structure. If ,you follow the "common-sens,e" dictates
of consciousness you become, effectively,
gree~y. and un-
wise-again I use "wisdom" as a word for recogrution of and
guidance by a knowledge of the total syste~ic creature.
Lack of systemic wisdom is always purnshed. We may say ,
that the biological systems-the individual, the. culture, and
the ecology-are partly living sustainers of theIr comp.on~nt
cells or organisms. But the systems are nonet~eles~ pumshing
of any 'species unwise enough to quarrel WIth Its ecology.
Call the systemic forces "God"if you will.

propaganda. He is therefore in the position of being re-
sponsive to what they are saying. Therefore he cannot have a
simple lineal control. We do not live in the sort of universe in
which simple lineal control is possible. Life is not like that.
Similarly, in the field of psychiatry, the family is a cyber-
netic system of the sort which I am discussing and usually
when systemic pathology occurs, the members blame each
other, or sometimes themselves. But the truth of the matter
is that both these alternatives are· fundamentally arrogant.
Either alternative assumes that the individual human being
has total power over·the system of which he or she is a part.
Even within the individual human being, control is limited.
We can in some degree set ourselves to learn even such
abstract characteristics as arrogance or humility, but we are
not by any means the captains of our souls.
It is, however, possible that the remedy for ills of con-
scious purpose lies with the individual. There is what Freud
called the royal road to the unconscious. He was referring
to dreams, but I think we should lump together dreams and
the creativity of art, or the perception of art, and poetry and
such things. And '1 would include with these the best of
religion. These are all activities in which the whole individual
is involved. The artist may have a conscious purpose to sell
his picture, even perhaps a conscious purpose to make it.
But in the making he must necessarily relax that arrogance
in favor of a creative experience in which his conscious mind
plays only a small part.
We might say that in creative art man must experience
himself-his total'self-as a cybernetic model.
,
It is characteristic of the 1960s that a large number of
people are looking to the psychedelic drugs for some sort
of wisdom or some sort of enlargement of consciousness,.
and I think this symptom of our epoch probably arises as
an attempt to compensate for our excessive· purposiveness.
But I am not sure that wisdom can be got that way. What
is required is not simply a relaxation of consciousness to let
the unconscious material gush out. To do this is merely to
exchange one partial view of the self for the other partial
view. I suspect that what is needed is the synthesis of the
two views and this is more difficult.

To introduce this question the following considerations are
offered:
(1) All biological and evolving systems (i.e., individual
organisms, animal and human societies, ecosystems, and the
like) consist of complex cybernetic networks, and all such
systems share certain formal characteristics. Each system con-
tains subsystems which are potentially regenerative, i.e.,
which would go into exponential "runaway" if uncorrected.
(Examples of such regenerative components are Malthusian
characteristics of population, schismogenic changes of personal
interaction, armamentlj races, etc.) The regenerative poten-
tialities of such subsystems are typically kept in check by
various sorts of governing loops to achieve "steady state."
Such systems are "conservative" in the sense that they tend
to conserve the truth of propositions about the values of their
component variables-especially they conserve the values of
those variables which otherwise would show exponential
change. Such systems are homeostatic, i.e., the effects of
small changes of input will be negated and the steady state
maintained by reversible adjustment.
.
(2) But "plus c'est la ~me chose, plus ~a change." This
converse of the French aphorism seems to be the more exact
description of biological and ecological systems. A constancy
of some variable is maintained by changing other variables.
This is characteristic of the engine with a governor: the con-
stancy of rate of rotation is maintained by altering the fuel
supply. Mutatis mutandis, the same logic underlies evolu-
tionary progress: those mutational changes will be perpet-
uated which contribute to the constancy of that complex
variable which we call "survival." The same logic also applies
to learning, social change, etc. The ongoing truth of certain
descriptive propositions is maintained by altering other prop-
ositions.
(3) In systems containing many interconnected homeostat-
ic loops, the changes brought about by an external impact
may slowly spread through the system. To maintain a given
variable (VI) at a given value, the values of V2, Va, etc.,
undergo change. But V 2 and Va may themselves be subject
to homeostatic control or may be linked to variables (V4, V 5,
etc.) which are subject to control. This second-order homeo-
stasis may lead to change in V o, V7 , etc. And so on.
(4) This phenomenon of spreading change is in the widest

"Progress," "learning," "evolution," the similarities .and dif-
ferences between phylogenetic and cultural evolution, and
so on, have been subjects for discussion for m~y years. These
matters become newly investigable in the light of cyber-
netics and systems theory.
.
In this Wenner-Gren conference, a particular· aspect of
this wide subject matter will be examined, namely the ~ole
of consciousness in the ongoing process of hum~n adaptati~n.
Three cybernetic or homeostatic systems Wlll be. conSId-
ered: the individual human organism, the human.SOCIety, and
the larger ecosystem. Consciousness will be conSidered as an
important component in the coupling of these systems.
A question of great scientific interest and perhaps grave
importance is whether the information processed through
consciousness is a<\equate and appropriate for the task of ~u­
man adaptation. It may well be that consciousness contams
systematic distortions of view which, when implemented by
modem technology, become destructive of the balances be-
tween man, his society and his ecosystem.

sense a sort of learnmg.-Acclimation and addiction are special
cases of this process. Over time, the system
bec?~es de-
pendent upon the continued presence of that on~al ex-
ternal impact whose immediate effects were neutralized by
the first order homeostasis.
.
Example: under the impact o! Prohibition:
th~ AmerIcan
social system reacted homeostatically to mam~am the con-
stancy of the supply of alcohol. A new profeSSIon, the boot-
legger, was generated. To control this profession, changes
occurred in the police system. When the question of repeal
was raised, it was expectable that certainly the bo?tle9g.ers
and possibly the police would be in favor of mamtammg
hombilioo.
.
(5) In this ultimate sense, all biological change ~
~n­
servative and all learning is aversive. The rat, who IS
re-
warded" with food, accepts that reward to neutralize the
changes wmch hunger is beginning to induce; and the con-
ventionally drawn distinction between "reward" and "pun-
ishment" depends upon a more or less arbitrary line wmch
we draw to delimit that subsystem wmch we call the "indi-
vidual:' We call an external event "reward" if its.occurrence
corrects an "internal" change wmch would be pUniShing. And
ro~

(6) Consciousness and the "self" are closely re at
1 eas,
but the ideas (possibly related to genotypically determined
premises of territory) are crystallized by that more or less
arbitrary line wmch delimits the individual and defines a .
logical difference between "reward" and "punishment," When
we view the individual as a
servosystemco~pled with its
environment or as a part of the larger system wmch is indi-
vidual + e~vironment, the whole appearance of adaptatio~.
and purpose changes.

.
(7) In extreme cases, change will preCIpitate or
pen~nt
some runaway or slippage along the potentially exponential
curves of the underlying regenerative circuits. This m.ay oc-
cur without total destruction of the system. The slippage
along exponential curves will, of course, always be limited,
in extreme cases, by breakdown of the system. ~h?rt of this
disaster, other factors may limit the slippage. It ~ .Important,
however to note that there is a danger of reaching levels at
which the limit is imposed by factors wmch lire in them-;'
selves deleterious. Wynne-Edwards has pointed out-what
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
443
every farmer knows-that a population of healthy individuals
cannot be" directly limited by the -available food supply. If
starvation is the method of getting rid of the excess popula-
tion, then the survivors will suffer if not death at least severe
dietary deficiency, while the food supply itself will be re-
duced, perhaps irreverSibly, by overgrazing. In principle, the
homeostatic controls of biological systems must be activated
by variables which are not in themselves harmful. The re-
flexes of respiration are activated not by oxygen deficiency
but by relatively harmless CO2 excess. The diver who learns
to ignore the signals of CO2 excess and continues his dive to .
approach oxygen deficiency runs serious risks.
(8) The problem of coupling self-corrective systems to-
gether is central in the adaptation of man to the societies and
ecosyste~s in which he lives. Lewis Canoll long ago joked
about the nature and order of randomness created by the
inappropriate coupling of biological systems. The problem, we
may say, Was to create a "game" which should be random,
not only in the restricted sense in which "matching pennies"
is random, But meta-random. The randomness of the moves of
the two players of "matching pennies" is restricted to a finite
set of known alternatives, namely ''heads'' or "tails" in. any
given play of the game. There is no possibility of going out-
side this set, no meta-random choice among a finite or infinite
set of sets.
By imperfect coupling of biological systems in the famous
game of croquet, however, Carroll creates a meta-random
game. Alice is coupled willi a flamingo, .and the "ball" is a
hedgehog.
The "purposes" (if we may use the term) of these con-
trasting biological systems are so discrepant that the random-
ness of play can no longer be delimited willi finite sets of
alternatives, known to the players.
Alice's difficulty arises from the fact that she does not
"understand" the flamingo, i.e., she does not have systemic
information about the "system" which confronts her. Similarly,
the flamingo does not understand Alice. They are at "cross-
purposes." The problem of coupling man. throngh conscious-
ness" with his biological environment is comparable. If con-
sciousness lacks information about the nature of man and the
environment, or if the information is distorted and inappro-

444
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
priately selected, then the coupling is likely to generate
meta-random sequence of events.
(9) We presume that consciousness is not entirely with-
out effect-that it is not a mere collateral resonance without
feedback into the system, an observer behind a one-way
mirror, a TV monitor which does not itself affect the pro-
gram. We believe that consciousness has feedback into the
remainder of mind and so an effect upon action. But the
effects of this feedback are almost unknown and urgently·
need investigation and validation.
(10) It is surely true that the content of consciousness is
no random sample of reports on events occurring in the re-
mainder of mind. Rather, the content of the screen of con-
sciousness is systematically selected from the enormously
great plethora of mental events. But of the rules and pref-
erences of this selection, very little is known. The matter
requires investigation. Similarly the limitations of verbal lan-
guage require consideration.
(11) It appears, however, that the system of selection of
information for the screen of consciousness is importantly re-
lated to "purpose," "attention," and similar phenomena which
are also in need of definition, elucidation, etc.
(12) If consciousness has feedback upon the remamder
of mind (9, above), and if consciousness deals only with a
skewed sample of the events of the total mind, then there
must exist a systematic (i.e., nonrandom) difference between
the conscious views of self and the world, and the true na-
ture of self and the world. Such a difference must distort
the processes of'adaptation.
,
(13) In this connection, there is a profound difference be-
tween the processes of cultural change and those of phylo.
genetic evolution. In the latter, the Weismannian barrier be.
tween soma and germ plasm is presumed to be totally;
opaque. There is no coupling from environment to genome.
In cultural evolution and individual learning, the couplin
through consciousness is present, incomplete and probabl
distortive.
(14) It is suggested that the specific nature of this di
tortion is such that the cybernetic nature of self and t
world tends to be imperceptible to consclousness, insofar
the contents of the "screen" of consciousness are determine
by considerations of purpose. The argument of purpose ten

to take the form "D is desirable; B leads to C; C leads to
D; so I! can be achieved by way of Band C:' But, if the
t?tal mmd and the outer world do not, in general, have this
Imeal struc.ture, then by forcing this structure upon them, we
become blind to the cybernetic circularities of the self and
the external world. Our conscious sampling of data will not

~Y our selective attention. Specifically, the at-
tem~t to achIeve. a change in a given variable, located ei-
ther 10 self or enVIronment, is likely to be undertaken without
comprehension of the homeostatic network surrounding that
varia~le. The c?nsiderations outlined in paragraphs 1 to 7
of, this essay WIll then be ignored. It may be essential for
WtSdom that the narrow purposive view be somehow cor-
rected.
(15) The function of consciousness in the coupling be-
tween man and the homeostatic systems around him is, of
course, no new phenomenon. Three circumstances however
make the ~vestigatio~ of thfs phenomenon an urg~nt matter:
(16) Frrst, there IS man s habit of changing his environ-
me?t rather than changing 'himself. Faced with a changing
vanable (e.g., temperature) within itself which it should
control, the organism may make changes either within itself
or in the external environment. It may adapt to the environ-
ment or adapt the environment to itself. In evolutionary
history, the great majority of steps have been changes within
the organism itself; some steps have been of an intermediate
kind in which the organisms achieved change of environment
by change of locale. In a few cases organisms other than
man have achieved the creation of modified rnicroenviron-
~ents around themselves, e.g., the nests of hymenoptera and
buds, concentrated forests of conifers, fungal colonies, etc.
In all such cases, ~e logic. of evolutionary progress is to-
ward ecosystems which sustam only the· dominant, environ-
ment-controlling species, and its symbionts and parasites.
~an,
~e
outsta~ding modifier of environment, similarly
achIeves smgle-speCles ecosystems in his cities, but he goes
one step further, establishing special environments for his
symbionts. These, likewise, become single-species ecosystems:
fields of com, culturl')s of bacteria, batteries of fowls, colonies
of laboratory rats, and the like.
(17) Secondly, the power ratio between purposive con-

~.-
446
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
sciousness and the environment has changed rapidly in the
last one hundred years, and the rate of change in this ratio
is certainly rapidly increasing with technological advance.
Conscious man, as a changer of his environment, is now fully
able to wreck himself and that environment-with the very
best of conscious intentions.
. .
(18) Third, a peculiar sociological phenomenon has arisen
in the last one hundred years which perhaps threatens to
isolate conscious purpose from many corrective processes
which might come out of less conscious parts of the mind.
The social scene is nowadays characterized by the existence
of a large nUmber of self-maximizing entities which, in
law, have something like the status of "persons"-1:rusts, co~­
panies, political parties,
~ons,
co~me~cial and financial
agencies, nations, and the like. In bIOlOgical fact, these en-
tities are precisely not persons and are not even aggregates
of whole persons. They are aggregates of paris of persons.
When Mr. Smith enters the board room of his company, he
is expected to limit his thinking narrowly to the specific pur-
poses of the company or to those of that part of 0e com-
pany which he "represents." Mercifully it is not en~ely pos-
sible for him to do this and some company declSlons are
influenced by considerations which spring from wider and
wiser parts of the mind. But ideally, Mr. Smith isexpecte? to
act as a pure, uncorrected consciousness-a dehumamzed
creature.
(19) Finally, it is appropriate to mention some of
~e
factors which may act as correctives-areas of human action
which are not' limited by the narrow distortions of coupling
through conscious purpose and where wisdom can obtain.
(a) Of these, undoubtedly the most important is love
Martin Buber has classified interpersonal relationships in
relevant manner. He diHerentiates "I-Thou" relations fro
''I-It'' relations, defining the latter as the normal pattern 0
interaction between man and inanimate objects. The "1-1
relationship he also regards as characteristic of human reI
tions wherever purpose is more important than love. But
the complex cybernetic structure of societies and ecosyste
is in some degree analogous to animation, then it would fo
low that an "I-Thou" relationship is conceivable between m
and his society or ecosystem. In this connection, the form
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
447
tion of "sensitivity groups" in many depersonalized organiza-
tions is of special interest.
(b) The arts, poetry, music, and the humanities similarly
are areas in which more of the mind is active than mere
consciousness would admit. "Le coeur a ses raisons que la
raison ne connatt point."
(c) Contact between man and animals and between man
and the natural world breeds, perhaps-sometimes-wisdom.
(d) There is religion.
(20) To conclude, let us remember that Job's narrow
piety, his purposiveness, his common sense, and his worldly
success are finally stigmatized, in a marvelous totemic poem,
by the Voice out of the Whirlwind:
Who Is this that darkeneth counsel by words
without understanding . ••
Dost thou know when the wild goats of the
rock bring forth?
Or canst thou tell w.hen the hinds do calve?

Form, Substance, and Difference*
Let me say that it is an extraordinary honor to be here
tonight, and a pleasure. I am a little frightened of you all,
because I am sure there are people here who know every
field of knowledge that I have touched much better than I
know it. It is true that 1 have touched a number of fields, and
I probably can face anyone of you and say I have touched a
field that you have not touched. But I am sure that for every
field I have touched, there are people here who are much
more expert than I. I am not a well-read philosopher, and
philosophy is not my business. I am not a very well-read
anthropologist, and anthropology is not exactly my business.
But I have tried to do something which Korzybski was
very much concerned with doing, and with which the whole
semantic movement has been concerned, namely, I have
studied the area of impact between very abstract and formal
philosophic thought on the one hand and the natural history
of man and other creatures on the other. This overlap be-
tween formal premises and actual behavior is, I assert, of
quite dreadful importance today. We face a world which is
threatened not only with disorganization of many kinds, but
also with the destruction of its environment, and we, today,

philosophic ~g, gOIng back to Greece, and wriggling
through the history of European thought over the last 2000
years. In this history, there has been a sort of rough dichot-
omy and often deep controversy. There has been a violent
enmity and bloodshed. It all starts, I suppose, with the
Pythagoreans versus their predecessors, and the argument
took the shape of "Do you ask what it's made of-earth
fire, water, etc?" Or do you ask, "What is its pattern?':
Pythagoras stood for inquiry into pattern rather than inquiry
into substance.1 That controversy has gone through the ages,
and the Pythagorean half of it has, until recently, been on
the whole the submerged half. The Gnostics follow the
Pythagoreans, and the alchemists follow the Gnostics, and
soon. The argument reached a sort of climax at the end of
the eighteenth century when a Pythagorean evolutionary
theory was built and then discarded-a theory which in-
volved Mind.
The
evolu~onary theory. of the late eighteenth century,
the ~amarckian theory, ~hich was the first organized trans-
fOrmIst theory of evolution, was built out of a curious his-
torical background which has been described by Lovejoy in
The Great ?hain of Being. Before Lamarck, the organic
. world, the h'ving world, was believed to be hierarchic in
structure, with Mind at the top. The chain, or ladder, went
down through the angels, through men, through the apes,
down to the infusoria or protozoa, and below that to the
plants and stones.
What Lamarck did was to tum that chain upside down.
He observed ~t animals changed under environmental pres-
sure. He was Incorrect, of course, in believing.that those
changes were inherited, but in any case, these changes were
for him the evidence of evolution. When he turned the lad-

;:
de< """de down, what h.d h_ the ""Plon.lion, o"",ely,
;
the Mind at the top, now became that which had to be
explained. His problem was to explain Mind. He was con-
,
vinced about evolution, and there his interest in it stopped.
So that if you read the Philosophie Zoologique (1809), you
will find that the first third of it is devoted to solving the
problem of evolution and the turning upside down of the
taxonomy, and the rest of the book is really devoted to com-
parative psychology, a science which he founded. Mind was
what he was really interested in. He had used habit as one
of the axiomatic phenomena in his theory of evolution, and
this of course alllo took him into the problem of comparative
psychology.
.
Now mind and pattern as the explanatory principles which,
above all, required investigation were pushed out of biologi-
cal thinking in the later evolutionary theories which were
developed in the mid-nineteenth century by Darwin, Huxley,
etc. There were still some naughty boys, like Samuel Butler,
who said that mind could not be ignored in this way-but
they were weak voices, and incidentally, they never looked
at organisms. I don't think Butler ever looked at anything
except his own cat, but he still knew more about evolution
than some of the more oonventional thinkers.
Now, at last, with the discovery of cybernetics, systems
theory, information theory, and so on, we begin to have a
formal base enabling us to think about mind and enabling us
to think about all these problems in a way which was totally
heterodox from about 1850 through to World War II. What
I have to talk a~out is how !be great dichotomy of episte-
mology has shifted under the impact of cybernetics and
information theory.
We can now say--or at any rate, can begin to say-what
we think a mind is. In the next twenty years there will be
other ways of saying it and, because the discoveries are
new, I can only give you my personal version. The old ver-
sions are surely wrong, but which of the revised pictures will
survive, we do not know.
Let us start from the evolutionary side. It is now em-
pirically clear that Darwinian evolutionary theory contained
a very great error in its identification of the unit of survival
under natural selection. The unit which was believed to be
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
451
crucial and around which the theory was set up was either
the breeding individual or the family line or the sub-
species or some similar homogeneous set of conspeci.fics. Now
I suggest that the last hundred years have demonstrated
empirically that if an organism or aggregate of organisms
sets to work with a focus on its own survival and thinks that
that is the way to select its adaptive moves, its "progress"
ends up with a destroyed environment. If the organism ends
up destroying its environment, it has in fact destroyed itself.
And we may very easily see this process carried to its
ultimate reductio ad absurdum in the next twenty years.
The unit of survival· is not the breeding organism, or the
family line, or the society.
The old unit has already been partly corrected by the
population geneticists. They have insisted that the evolution-
ary unit is, in fact, not homogeneous. A wild population
of any species consists always of individuals whose genetic
constitution varies widely. In other words, potentiality and
readiness for change is already built into the survival unit.
The heterogeneity of the wild population is already one-
half of that trial-and-error system which is necessary for
dealing with environment.
The artificially homogenized populations of man's domestic
animals and plants are scarcely fitfor survival.
And today a further correction of the unit is necessary.
The flexible environment must also be included along with
the flexible organism because, as I have already said, the
organism which destroys its environment destroys itself. The
unit of survival is a flexible organism-in-its-environment.
Now, let me leave evolution for a moment to consider
what is the unit of mind. Let us go back to the map and
the territory and ask: "What is it in the territory that gets
onto the map?" We know the territory does not get onto the
map. That is the central point about which we here are all
agreed. Now, if the territory were uniform, nothing would
get onto the map except its boundaries, which are the points
at which it ceases to be ubiform against some larger
matrix. What gets onto the map, in fact, is difference, be it
a difference in altitude, a difference in vegetation, a dif-
ference in population structure, difference in surface, or what-
ever. Differences are the things that get onto a map.
But what is a difference? A difference is a very peculiar

and obscure concept. It is certainly not a thing or an event.
This piece of paper is different from the wood of this lec-
tern. There are many differences between them-of co!or,
texture, shape, etc. But if we start to ask about th~ localiza-
tion of those differences, we get into trouble. ObvIously the
difference between the paper and the wood is not in the
paper; it is obviously not in the wood; it is obviously not in
the space between them, and it
~ obviously not ~ th.e
time between them. (Difference whICh occurs across time IS
what we call "change.")
A difference, then, is an abstract matter.
.1
In the hard sciences, effects are, in general, cause,d by
'rather concrete conditions or events-impacts, forces, and so
forth. But when you enter the world of communication,
o~­
ganization, etc., you leave. behind that }'Vhole world
In-
which effects are brought about by forces and impacts and
energy exchange. You enter a world in which "effects"-
and I am not sure one should still use the same word-are
brought about by differences. That is, they are brought
about by the sort of "thing" that gets onto the map from the
territory. This is difference..
Difference travels from the wood and paper into my retina.
It then gets picked up and worked on by this fancy piece
of computing machinery in my head.
The whole energy relation is different. In the world of
mind, nothing-that which is not-can be a cause. In the
hard sciences, we ask for causes and we expect them to
exist and be "rea!''' But remember that zero is different from
one, and because zero is different from one, zero can be a
cause in the psychological world, the world of' communica-
tion. The letter which you do not write can get an angry
reply; and the income tax form which you do 'not fill in can
trigger the Internal Revenue boys into energetic action, be-
cause they, too, have their breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner
and can react with energy which they derive from their
metabolism. The letter which never existed is no source of
energy.
It follows, of course, that we must change our whole way
of thinking about mental and communicational process. The
ordinary analogies of energy theory which people borrow
from the hard sciences to provide a conceptual frame upon
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
453
which they try to build theories about -psychology and be-
l:tavior-that entire Procrustean structure-is non-sense. It is
in error.
I suggest to you, now, that the word "idea," in its most
elementary sense, is synonymous with "difference." Kant, in
the Critique of Judgment-if I understand him correctly-
asserts that the most elementary aesthetic act is the selection
of a fact. He argues that in a piece of chalk there are an
infinite number of potential facts. The Ding an sich, the piece
of chalk, can never enter into communication or mental pro-
cess because of this infinitude. The sensory receptors cannot
accept it; they filter it out. What they do is to select certain
facts out of the piece of chalk, which then become, in mod-
ern terminology, information.
I suggest that Kant's statement can be modified to say
that there is an infinite number of differences around and
within the piece of chalk. There are differences between the
chalk and the rest of the universe, between the chalk and the
sun or the moon. And within the piece of chalk, there is for
every molecule an infinite number of differences between its
location and the locations in which it might have heen. Of
this infinitude, we select a very limited number, which be-
come information. In fact, what we mean by information-the
elementary unit of information-is a difference which makes
o difference, and it is able to make a difference because the
neural pathways along which it travels and is continually
transformed are themselves provided with energy. The path-
ways are ready to be triggered. We may even say that
the queStion is already implicit in them.
There is, however, an important contrast between most of
the pathways of information inside the body and most of the
pathways outside it. The differences between the paper
and the wood are first transformed into differences in the
propl!gation of light or sound, and travel in this form to my
sensory end organs. The first part of their journey is ener-
gized in the ordinary hard-science way, from "behind." But
when the differences enter my body by triggering an end
organ, this type of travel is replaced by travel which is
energized at every step by the metabolic energy latent in
the
prot~plasm which receives the difference, recreates or
transforms it, and passes it on.

454
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
When I strike the head of a nail with a hammer, an im-
pulse is transmitted to its point. But it is a semantic errol',
a misleading metaphor, to say that what travels in an axon is
an "impulse." It could correctly be called "news of a dif-
ference."
Be that as it may, this contrast between internal and ex-
ternal pathways is not absolute. Exceptions occur on both
sides of the line. Some external chains of events are ener-
gized by relays, and some chains of events internal to the
body are energized from "behind." Notably, the mecha,nical
interaction of muscles can be used as a computational model.2
In spite of·these exceptions, it is still broadly true that
the coding and transmission of diHerences outside the body
is very diHerent from the coding and transmission inside, and
this diHerence must be mentioned because it can lead us into
error. We <Xlmmonly think of the external "physical world"
as somehow separate from an internal "mental world." I be-
lieve that this division is based on the contrast in coding and -
transmission inside and outside the body.
The mental world-the mind-the world of information
processing-is not limited by the sm.
Let us now go back to the notion that the transform of
a diHerence traveling in a circuit is an elementary idea. If
this be correct, let us ask what a nifud is. We say the map is
different from the territory. But what is the territory? Opera-
tionally, somebody went out with a retina or a measuring
stick and made representations which were then put upon
paper. What is on the paper map is a representation of
what was in the retinal representation of the man who made
the map; and as you push the question back, what you find
is an infinite regress, an infinite series of maps. The territory
never gets in at all. The territory is Ding an sich and you
can't do anything with it. Always the process of representa-
tion will ffiter it out so that the mental world is only maps of
•It is interesting to note that digital computers depend
upon transmission of energy "from behind" to send
"news" along wire from one relay to the next. But each
relay has its own energy source. Analogic computers,
e.g., tide machines and the like, are commonly entirely
driven by- energy "from behind." Either type of energi- -
zation can be used for computational purposes.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
455
-maps of maps, ad infinitum.8 All "phenomena" are literally
"appearances."
Or we can follow the chain forward. I receive various
sorts of mappings which I call data or information. Upon
receipt of these I act. But my actions, my muscular con-
tractions, are transforms of differences in the input material.
And I receive again data which are transforms of my actions.
We get thus a picture of the mental world which has some-
how jumped loose from our conventional picture of the phys-
ical world.
This is not new, and for historic background we go again
to the alchemists and Gnostics. Carl Jung once wrote a very
curious little book, which I recommend to all of you. It is
called Septem Sermones ad Mortuos, Seven Sermons to the
Dead.4 In his Memoirs, Dreams and Reflections, Jung teIls
us that his house was full of ghosts, and they were noisy.
They bothered him, they bothered his wife, and they both-
ered the children. In the vulgar jargon of psychiatry, we
might say that everybody in the house was as psychotic as
hooty owls, and for quite good reason. If you get your
epistemology confused, you go psychotic, and Jung was going
through an epistemological crisis. So he sat down at ,his desk
and picked up a pen and started to write. When he started
to write the ghosts all disappeared, and he wrote this little
book. From this he dates all his later inSight. He signed it
"Basilides," who was a famous Gnostic in Alexandria in the
second century.
-
He points out that there are two worlds. We might call
• Or we may spell the matter out and say that at every
step, as a difference is transformed and propagated
along its pathway, the embodiment of the difference be-
fore the step is a "territory" of which the embodiment
after the step is a "map." The map-territory relation ob-
tains at every step.
• Written in 1916, translated by H. G. Baynes and pri-
vately circulated in 1925. Republished by Stuart & Wat-
kins, London, and by Random House, 1961. In later
work, Jung seems to have lost the clarity of the Seven
Sermons. In his "Answer to Job," the archetypes are
said to be "pleromatic." It is surely true, however, that
constellations of ideas may seem subjectively to resem-
ble "forces" when their ideational character is unrecog-
nized.

them two worlds of explanation. He names them the pleroma
and the creatura, these being Gnostic terms. The pleroma is
the world in which events are caused by forces and impacts
and in which there are no "distinctions." Or, as I would say,
no "differences." In thecreatura, effects are brought about
precisely by difference. In fact, this is the same old dichotomy ,
between mind and substance.
We can study and describe the pleroma, but always the
distinctions which we draw are attributed by us· to the
pleroma. The pleroma knows nothing of difference and dis.
tinction; it contains no "ideas" in the sense in which J: am
using the word., When we study and describe the creatura,
we must correctly identify those differences which are ef-
fective within it.
I suggest that "pleroma" and "creatura" are words which
we could usefully adopt, and it is therefore worthwhile to
look at the bridges which exist between these two "worlds."
It is an oversimplification to say that the "hard sciences" deal
only with the pleroma and that the sciences of the mind
deal only with the creatura. There is more to it than that.
First, consider the relation between energy and negative
~
ent:rQpy. The classical Carnot heat engine consists of a cylin-
der 'of gas with a piston. This cylinder is alternately placed ,
in contact with a container of hot gas and with a container '
of cold -gas. The gas in the cylinder alternately expands
and contracts as it is heated or cooled by the hot and C9ld
sources. The piston is thus driven up and down.
But with each,cycle of the engine, the difference be-
tween the temperature of the hot source and that of the
cold source is reduced. When this difference becomes zero,
the engine will stop.'
The physicist, describing the pleroma, will write equations
to translate the temperature difference into "available ener-
gy," which he will call "negative entropy," and will go on
from there.
The analyst of the creatura will note that the whole sys. '
tem is a sense organ which is triggered by temperature dif- .
ference. He will call this difference which makes a difference
"information" or "negative entropy." For him, this is only a
special case in which the effective difference happens to be
a matter of energetics. He is equally interested in all differ-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
457
ences which can activate some sense organ. For him, any such
difference is "negative entropy,"
Or consider the phenomenon which the neurophysiologists
call "synaptic summation," What is observed is that in cer-
tain cases, when two neurons, A and B, 'have synaptic connec-
tion to a third neuron, C, the firing of neither neuron by it-
seH is sufficient to fire C; but that when both A and B fire
simultaneously (or nearly so), their combined "impulses" will
cause C to fire.
In;pleromatic language, this combining of events to sur-
mount a threshold is called "summation,"
But from the point of view of the student of creatura (and
the neurophysiologist must surely have one foot in the pIe-
roma and the other in creatura), this is not summation at all.
What happens is that the system operates to create dif-
ferences. There are two differentiated classes of firings by A:
those firings which are accompanied by B and those which
are unaccompanied. Similarly there are two classes of firings
byB.
The so-called "summation," when both fire, is not an ad-
ditive process from this point of view. It is the formation of
a logical product-a process of fractionation rather than sum-
mation.
The creatura is thus the world seen as mind, wherever
such a view is appropriate. And wherever this view is ap-
propriate, there arises a species of complexity which is ab-
sent from pleromatic description: creatural description is al-
.ways hierarchic.
I have said that what gets from territory to map is trans-
forms of difference and that these (somehow selected) dif-
ferences are elementary ideas.
But there are differences between differences. Every ef-
fective difference denotes a demarcation, a line of classifica-
tion, and all classification is hierarchic. In other words, dif-
ferences are themselves to be differentiated and classified.
In this context I will only touch lightly on the matter of
classes of difference, because to carry the matter further
would land us in problems of Principia Mathematica.
Let me invite you to a psychological experience, if only to
demonstrate the frailty of the human computer. First note
that differences in texture are different
(a)
from
differ~
ences in color. Now note that differences in size are different

Steps to an Ecology of Mind

cerned with differences in the cut face of the tree, differ-
ences in the retina of the man, differences in his central
nervous system, differences in his efferent neural messages,
differences in the behavior of his muscles, differences in how
the axe Hies, to the differences which the aXe then makes
on the face of the tree. Our explanation (for certain pur-
poses) will go round and round that circuit. In principle,
if you want to explain or understand anything in human
behavior, you are always dealing with total circuits, completed
circuits. This is the elementary cybernetic thought.
The elementary cybernetic system with its messages in
circuit is, in fact, the simplest unit of mind; and the trans-
form of a difference traveling in a circuit is the 'elementary
idea. More complicated systems are perhaps more worthy to
be called mental systems, but essentially this is what we are
talking about. The unit which shows the characteristic of
trial and error will be legitimately called a mental system.
But what about «me"? Suppose I am a blind man, and I
use a stick. I go tap, tap, tap. Where do I start? Is my mental
system bounded at the handle of the stick? Is it bounded by
my skin? Does it start halfway up the stick? Does it start at
the tip of the stick? But these are nonsense questions. The
stick is a pathway along which transforms of difference are
being transmitted. The way to delineate the system is to
draw the limiting line in such a -way that you do not cut any
of these pathways in ways which leave things inexplicable.
If what you are trying to explai,n is a given piece of be-
havior, such as the locomotion of the blind man, then, for
this ,purpose, you will need the street, the stick, the man;
the street, the stick, and so on, round and round.
But when the blind ,man sits down to eat his lunch, his
stick and its messages wilIno longer be relevant-if it is his
eating that you want to understand.
And iIi. addition to what I have said to define the in-
dividual mind, I think it necessary to include the relevant
parts of memory and data "banks." After all, the simplest
cybernetic circuit can be said to have memory of a dynamic
kind-not based upon static storage but upon the travel of
information around the circuit. The behavior of the governor
of a steam engine at Time 2 is partly determined by what it
did at Time I-where the interval between Time 1 and

Now let me invite you, as disciples of Korzybski, to defin
the differences between "different (a) ," «different (b)," an
«different (0)" in the above paragraph.
The computer in the human head boggles at the task.
But not all classes of difference are as awkward to handle
One such class you are all familiar with. Namely, the clas

formation whereby the differences immanent in the tenito

absolutely essential to recognize the differences of this class"
and, indeed, it is these that form the central subject matter
of "Science and Sanity."
An hallucination or a dream image is surely a transforma-
tion of something. But of what? And by what rules of trans-
formation?
Lastly there is that hierarchy of differences which biolo-
gists call "levels." I mean such differences as that between a
cell and a tissue, between tissue and organ, organ and or.
ganism, and organism and society.
These are the :hierarchies of units or Gestalten, in which
each subunit is a part of the unit of next larger scope. And,
always in biology, this difference or relationship which I call
"part of" is such that certain differences in the part have
informational effect upon the larger unit, and vice versa.
Having stated this relationship between biological part and
whole, I can now go on from the notion of creatura as Min
in general to the question of what is a mind.
What do I mean by "my" mind?
I suggest that the delimitation of an individual mind mus
always depend upon what phenomena we wish to under-
stand or explain. Obviously there are lots of message path-
ways outside the skin, and these and the messages which
they carry must be included as part of the mental system
whenever they are relevant.

Time 2 is that time necessary for the information to complete
the circuit.
We get a picture, then, of mind as synonymous with
cybernetic 'system-the relevant total information-proces~in~,
trial-and-error completing unit. And we know that WIthin
Mind in the widest sense there will be a ihierarchy of sub-
systems, anyone of which we can call an individu~l mind.
.
But this picture is precisely the same as the pIcture which
1 arrived at in discussing the unit of evolution. I believe that
this identity is the most important generalization which I
have to offer you tonight.
\
In considering units of evolution, I argued that yo~ have
at each step to include the completed pathways outsIde the
protoplasmic aggregate, be it DNA-in-th~ell,?r cell-in-the:-
body, or body-in-the-environment. The hierarchic structure IS
not new. Formerly we talked about the breeding individual
or the family line or the taxon, and so on. Now each step
of the hierarchy is to be thought of as a system, instead of a
chunk cut off and visualized as against the surrounding
matrix.
This identity between the unit of mind and the unit of
evolutionary survival is of very great importance, not only
theoretical, but also ethical.
It means, you see, that I now localize something which I
am calling "Mind" immanent in the large biologic.al system-:-
the ecosystem. Or, if I draw the system boundanes at.a dif-
ferent level, then mind is immanent in the total evolutionary
structure. If this identity between mental and evolutionary
units is broadly right, then we face a number ?f shifts in
our thinking.
First, let us consider ecology. Ecology has currently two
faces to it: the face which is called bioenergetics-the eco-
nomics of energy and materials within a coral reef, a red-
wood forest, or a city-and, second, an economics, of infor-
mation, of entropy, negentropy, etc. These two do not fit
together very well precisely because the units are diHerently
bounded in the two sorts of ecology. In bioenergetics it is
natural and appropriate to think of -units bounded at the cell
membrane, or at the skin: or of units composed of sets of
conspecific individuals. These boundaries are then the fron-
tiers at which Il)easurements can be made to determine the
additive-subtractive budget of energy for the given unit. In
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
461
contrast, informational or entropic ecology deals with the
budgeting of pathways and of probability. The resulting bud-
gets are fractionating
(not subtractive). The boundaries
must enclose, not cut, the relevant pathways.
Moreover, the very meaning of "survival" becomes dif-
ferent when we stop talking about the survival of something
bounded by the skin and start to think of the survival of the
system of ideas in circuit. The contents of the skin are
randomized at death and the pathways within the skin are
randomized. But- the ideas, under further transformation,
may go on out in the world in books or works of art. Socrates
as a bioenergetic individual is dead. But much of him still
lives as a component in the contemporary ecology of ideas.II
It is also clear that theology becomes changed and per-
haps renewed. The Mediterranean religions for 5000 years
have swung to and fro between immanence and transcen-
dence. In Babylon the gods were transcendent on the tops
of hills; in Egypt, there was god immanent in Pharoah: and
Christianity is a complex combination of these two beliefs.
The cybernetic epistemology which I have offered you
would suggest a new approach. The individual mind is
immanent but not only in the body. It is immanent also in
pathways and messages outside the body: and there is a
larger Mind of which the individual mind is only a sub-
system. This larger Mind is comparable to God and is per-
haps what Some people mean by "God," but it is still im-
manent in the total interconnected social system and planetary
ecology.
Freudian psychology expanded the concept of mind in-
. wards to include the whole communication system within the
body-the autonomic, the habitual, and_the vast range of
unconscious process. What I am saying expands mind out-
wards. And both of these changes reduce the scope of the
conscious 'self. A certain humility becomes appropriate, tem-

H you put God outside and set him vis-i-vis his creation

H 1 am right, the whole of our thinking about what we

to do it in. If we continue to operate on the premises that
were fashionable in the precybemetic era, and which were
especially underlined and strengthened during the Indus-,
trial Revolution, which seemed to validate the Darwinian
unit of survival, we may have twenty or thirty years before

than the destruction of any group of nations; The most im-
portant task today is, perhaps, to learn to think in the new
way. Let me say that I don't know how to think that way.
Intellectually, 1 can stand here and 1 can give you a rea-
soned exposition of this matter; but if 1 am cutting down a
tree, 1 still think "Gregory Bateson" is cutting down the tree.
I am cutting down the tree. "Myself" is to me lStill an ex-
cessively concrete object, different from the rest of what I
have been calling "mind.'"
The step to realizing-to making habitual-the other way
of thinking-so that one naturally thinks that way when
one reaches out for a glass of water or cuts down a tree--
that step is not an easy one.
l~
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
463
And, quite seriously, 1 suggest to you that we should
trust no policy decisions which emanate from persons who do
not yet have that habit.
There are experiences and disciplines which may help
me to imagine what it would be like to have this habit of
correct thought. Under LSD, 1 -have experienced, as have
many others, the disappearance of the division between self
and the music to which 1 was listening. The perceiver aI14l
the thing perceived become strangely united into a single
entity. This state is surely more correct than the state in
which it seems that "I hear the music." The sound, after all,
is Ding an sieh, but my perception of it is a part of mind.
It is told of Johann Sebastian Bach that when somebody
asked him how he played so divinely, he answered, "I play
the notes, in order, as they are written. It is God who makes
the music," But not many of us can claim Bach's correctness
of epistemology-or that of William Blake, who knew that
the Poetic Imagination was the only reality. The poets have
known these things all through the ages, but the rest of us
have gone astray into all sorts of false reifica:tions of the
"self' and separations between the "self" and "experience,"
For me another clue-another moment when the nature
of mind was for a moment clear--was provided by the
famous experiments of Adelbert Ames, Jr. These are optical
illusions in depth perception. As Ames' guinea pig, you dis-
cover that those mental processes by which you create the
world in three-dimensional perspective are within your mind
but totally unconscious and utterly beyond voluntary con-
trol. Of course, we all know that this is so--that mind
creates the images which "we" then see. But still it is a pro-
found epistemological shock to have direct experience of
this which we always knew:
'
Please do not misunderstand me. When 1 say that the
poets have always known these things or that most of mental
process is unconscious, 1 am not advocating a greater use of
emotion or a lesser use of intellect. Of course, if what 1 am
saying tonight is approximately true, then our ideas about
the relation between thought and emotion need to be re-
vised. H the boundaries of the "ego" are wrongly drawn or
even totally fictitious, then it may be nonsense to regard
emotions or dreams or our unconscious computations of per-
spective as "ego-alien."

that it follows from this mental character of the m~cro8copic world that the

464
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
We live in a strange epoch when many psychologists try
to "humanize" their science by preaching an anti-intellectual
gospel. They might, as sensibly, try to physicalize physics by
discarding the tools of mathematics.
It is the attempt to separate intellect from emotion that is
monstrous, and I suggest that if is equally monstrous-and
dangerous-to attempt to separate the external mind from
~e internal. Or to separate mind from body.
Blake noted that "A tear is an intellectual thing," and
Pascal asserted that "The heart has its reasons of which, the
reason knows nothing." We need not be put off by the:fact
that the reasonings, of the heart (or of the hypothalamus) are
accompanied ,by sensations of joy or grief. These computa-
tions are concerned with matters which are vital to mam-
mals, namely, matters of relationship, by which I mean love,
hate, respect, dependency, spectatorship, performance, dom-
inance, and so on. These are central to the life of any
mammal and I see no objection to calling these computations
"thought," though certainly the units of relational computa-
tion are different from the units which we use to compute
about isolable things.
But there are bridges between the one sort of thought and
the other, and it seems to me that the artists and poets are
specifically concerned with these bridges. It is not that art
is the expression of the unconscious, but rather that it is con-
cerned with the relation between the levels of mental pro-
cess. From a work of art it may be possible to analyze out
some unconscious thoughts of the artist, but I believe that,
for example, Freud's ,analysis of Leonardo's Virgin on the
Knees of St. Anne precisely misses the point of ilie wh~le
exercise. Artistic skill is the combining of many levels of mmd
-unconscious, conscious, and external-to make a statement
of their combination. It is not a matter of expressing a single
level.
Similarly, Isadora Duncan, when she said, "If I could say
it, I would not have to dance it," was talking nonsense, be-
cause her dance was about combinations of saying and mov-
ing.
.
Indeed, if what I have been saying is at all corr.ect, the
whole base of aesthetics will need to be re-exanuned. It
seems that we link feelings not only to the computations of
the heart but also to computations in the external pathways
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
465
of the mind. It is when we recognize the operations of
creatura in the external world that we are aware of "beauty"
or "ugliness." The "primrose by the river's brim" is beautiful
because we are aware that the combination of differences
which constitutes its appearance could only be achieved by
information processing, i.e., by thought. We recognize an-
other mind within our own external mind.
And last, there is death. It is understandable that, in a
civilization which separates mind from body, we should
either try to forget death or to mak!" mythologies about the
surVival of transcendent mind. But if mind is immanent not
only in those pathways of information which are located in-
side the body but also in external pathways, then death
takes on a different aspect. The individual nexus of pathways
which I call "me" is no longer so precious because that
nexus is only part of a larger mind.
The .ideas which seemed to be me can also become im-
manent in you. May they survive-if true.
COMMENT ON- PART V
In the flnal essay of this part, "Form, Substance and Difference,"
much of what has been said in earlier parts of the book falls into
place. In sum, what has been said amounts to this: that in addi-
tion to (and always in conformity with) the familiar physical
determinism which characterises our universe, there is a mental
determinism. This mental determinism is in n~ sense supernatural.
Rather it is of the very nature·of the macroscopico world that it
exhibit mental characteristics. The mental determinism is not
transcendent but immanent and is especially complex and evident
in those sections of the universe which are alive or which include
living things.
But so much of occidental thinking is shaped on the premise
of transcendent deity that it is difficult for many people to rethink
their theories in terms of immanence. Even Darwin from time to
time wrote about Natural Selection in phrases which almost
ascribed to this process the char,acteristics of transcendence and
purpose.

466
Steps to an Ecology at Mind
It may be worthwhile, therefore, to give an extreme sketch of
the difference. between the belief in transcendence and that in
immanence.
Transcendent mind or deity is imagined to be personal and
omniscient, and as receiving information by channels separate from
the earthly. He sees a species acting in ways which must disrupt
its ecology and, either in sorrow or in anger, He sends the wars,
the plagues, the pollution, and the fallout.
Immanent mind would achieve the same final result but without
either sorrow or anger. Immanent mind has no separate and un-
earthly channels by which to know or act and, therefore, can have
no separate emotion 01" evaluative oomment. The immanent will
differ from the transcendent in greater determinism.
St. Paul (GalatianS VI) said that "God is not mocked," and
immanent mind similarly is. neither vengeful nor forgiving. It is
of no use to make excuses; the immanent mind is not "mocked."
But since our minds-and this includes our tools and actions-
are only parts of the larger mind, its computations can be con-
fused by our contradictions and confusions. Since it contains our
insanity, the immanent mind is inevitably subject to possible in-
sanity. It is in our power, with our technology, to create insanity
in the larger system of which we are parts.
In the final section of the book, I shall consider some of these
mentally pathogenic processes.

From Versailles to Cybernetics*
I have to talk about recent history as it appears to me in
my generation and to you in yours and; as I Hew in this
morning, words began to echo in my mind. These were
phrases more thunderous than any I might be able to
compose. One of these groups of words was, "The fathers
have eaten bitter fruit and the children's teeth are set on
edge:' Another was the statement of Joyce that "history is
that nightmare from which 'there is no awakening:' Another
was, "The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children
even to the third and fourth generation of those that hate
me:' And lastly, not so immediately relevant, but still I
think relevant to the problem of social mechanism, "He who
would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars.
General Good is the plea of the rooundrel, hypocrite, and
Hatterer:'
,
We are talking about serious things. 'I call this lecture
"From Versailles to Cybernetics," naming the two historic
events of the twentieth century. The word "cybernetics" is
familiar, is it not? But how many of you know what hap-
pened at Versailles in 1919?

history of the last sixty years? I am sixty-two, and, as.I be-

the ro~m and when the room is hot, the thermometer switch
turns it off again. The system is what is called a nomeostatic
circuit or a' servocircuit. But there is also a little box in the
living room on the wall by which you set the thermostat. If
the house has been too cold for the last week, you must
move it up from its present setting to make the system now
oscillate around a new level. No amount of weather, heat or
cold or whatever, will change that setting, which is called
the "bias" of the system. The temperature of the house will
oscillate, it will get hotter and cooler according to various
circumstances, but the setting of the mechanism will not be
changed by those changes. But when you go and you move
that bias, you will change what we may call the "attitude"
of the system.
Similarly, the important question about history is: Has the
biaS or setting been changed? The episodic working out of
events under a single stationary setting is really trivial. It is
with this thought in mind that I have said that the two most
important 'historic events in my life were the Treaty of Ver-
sailles and the discoveryof cybernetics.
Most of you probably haxdly bow how the Treaty of
Versailles came into being. The story is very simple. World
Wax I dragged on and on; the Germans were rather ob-
viously losing. At this point, George Creel, a public relations
man-and I want you not to forget that this man was a
granddaddy of modem public relations-had an idea: the
idea was that maybe the Germans would surrender if we
offered them soft armistice terms. He therefore drew up a
set of soft terms, according to which there would be no
punitive measures. These terms were drawn up in fourteen
points. These Fourteen Points he passed on to President Wil-
son. If you are' going to deceive somebody, you had better
get an honest man to caJ:ry the message. President Wilson
was an almost pathologically honest man and a humanitarian.
He elaborated the points in a number of speeches: there
were to be "no annexations, no contributions, no punitive
damages; .." and so on. And the Germans surrendered.
We, British and Americans-especially the British-con-
tinued of course to blockade Germany because we didn't
want them to get uppity before the Treaty was signed. So,
for another yeax, they continued to starve.

time, it seemed to me that I had really only seen two momen~
that would rate as really important from an anthropologist s
point of view. One was the events leading up to the Treaty
of Versailles. and the other was the cybernetic breakthr~ugh.
You may be surprised or shocked that I have not mentioned
the A-bomb, or even World Wax 11. I have not mentioned
the spread of the automobile, nor of the radio and TV, nor
many other things that have occurred in the last sixty
yeaxs.
Let me state my criterion of historical importance:
(
Mammals ip. general, and we among them, caxe extrewely,
not about episodes, but about the patterns of their relation-
ships. When you open the refrigerator door and the cat
comes up and makes certain sounds, she,is not talking about
liver or milk, though you may bow very well that that is
what she wants. You may be able to guess correctly and give
her that-if there is, any in the refrigerator. What she ac-
tually says is something about the relationship between her-
self and you. :1£ you translated her message into words, it
would be something like, "dependency, dependency, depen-
dency." She is talking, in fact, about a rather abstract pat-
tern within a relationship. From that assertion of a pattern,
you axe expected to go from the general to the speci£io--to
deduce "milk" or "liver."
This is crucial. This is what mammals are about. They
axe concerned With patterns of relationship, with where they
stand in love, hate, respect, dependency, trust, and similax
abstractions,
vis~a-vis somebody else. This is where it hurts
us to be put in the Wrong. If we trust and find j:hat that
which we have trusted was untrustworthy; or if we distrust,
and find that that which we distrusted was in fact trust-
worthy, we feel bad. The pain that human beings and all
other mammals can suJIer from this type of error is extreme.
If therefore, we really want to know what axe the significant
p~ints in history, we have to ask which axe the moments in
history when attitudes were changed..These are the mo-

Craik, and so on. All these separate developments in dif-
ferent intellectual centers dealt with communicational prob-
lems, especially with the problem of what sort of a thing is
an organized system.
You will notice that everything I said about history and
about Versailles is a discussion of organized systems and their
properties. Now I want to say that we are developing a cer-
tain amount of rigorous scientific understanding of these very
mysterious organized systems. Our knowledge today is way
~ad of anything that George Creel could have said. He
was an applied scientist before the science was ripe to be
applied.
One of the roots of cybernetics goes back to Whitehead
and Russell and what is called the Theory of Logical Types.
In principle, the name is not the thing named, and the name
of the name is not the name, and so on. In terms of this
powerful theory, a message about war is not part of the war.
Let me put it this way: the message "Let's play chess"
is not a move in the gaIlle of chess. It is a message in a more
abstract language than the language of the game on the
board. The message "Let's make peace on such and such
terms" is not within the same ethical system as the deceits
and tricks of battle. They say that all is fair in love and war,
and that may be true within love and war, but outside and
about love and war, the· ethics are a little different. Men
have felt for centuries that .treachery in a truce or peace-
making is worse than trickery in battle. Today this ethical
principle receives' rigorous theoretical and scientific support.
The ethics can now be looked at with formality, rigor, logic,
mathematics, and all that, and stands on a different sort of
basis from mere invocational preachments. We do not have to
feel our way; we can sometimes know right from wrong.
I included cybernetics as the second historic event of
importance in my lifetime because I have at least a dim hope
that we can bring ourselves to use this new understanding
with some honesty; H we understand a little bit of what
we're
do~g, maybe it will help us to find our way out of
the maze of hallucinations that we have created around our-
selves.
Cybernetics is, at any rate, a contribution to change-not
Simply a change in attitude, but even a change in the under-
standing of what an attitude is.

"Mrs. Grundy"), the guardian of Erewhonian moraIs. She.

But after the great deception, this philosophy is unten-
able. You are perfectly correct that·something is wrong; and
that the something wrong is of the nature of a deceit· and a
hypocrisy. You live in .the midst of corruption.
Of course, your natural responses are puritanical. Not sex-
ual puritanism, because it is not a sexual deceit that lies in
the background. But an extreme puritanism against com-
promise, a puritanism against hypocrisy, and this ends up as a
reduction of life to little pieces. It is the big integrated
structures of life that seem to have carried the lunacy, and
so you try to focus down on the small~t things. "He who
would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars.
General Good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and·
flatterer." The general good smells of hypocrisy to the rising
generation.
-
I don't doubt that if you asked George Creel to justify the
Fourteen Points, he would urge the general good. It is pos- .
sible that that little operation of his saved a few thousand
American lives in 1918. I don't know how many it cost in
World War II, and since in Korea and Vietnam. I recall that
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were justified by the g~neral good
and saving American lives. There was a lot of talk about
"unconditional surrender," perhaps because we could not
trust ourselves to -honor a conditional armistice. Was the fate
of Hiroshima determined at Versames?
Now I want to talk about the other significant historical
event which has happened in my lifetime, approximately in
1946-47. This was the growing together of a number of ideas .
which had developed in different places during World War 1'.
II. We may call the aggregate of these ideas cybernetics, or,.
communication theory, or information theory, or systems the-
ory. The ideas were generated in many places: in Vienna by
BertalanfIy, in Harvard by Wiener, in Princeton by v~n Neu-:
mann, in Bell Telephone labs by Shannon, in Cambndge by

The stance that I have taken in choosing what is important
in history-saying that the important things are the moments
at which attitude is determined, the moments at which the
bias of the thermostat is changed-this stance is derived
directly from cybernetics. These are thoughts shaped by
events from 1946 and after.
But pigs do not go around ready-roasted. We now ~a~e a
lot of cybernetics, a lot of games theory, and the begm~gs
of understanding of complex systems. But any understanding
can be used in destructive ways.
,
I think that cybernetics is the biggest bite out of the fnrlt
of the Tree of Knowledge that mankind has taken in the last
2000 years. But most of such bites out of the apple have
proved to be rather indigestible-usually for cybernetic rea-
sons.
Cybernetics has integrity within itseH, to help us to not be
seduced by it into more lunacy, but we cannot trust it to keep
us from sin.
For example, the state departments of several nations
are today using games theory, backed up by computers, as
a way of deciding international policy.
Th~y iden~
~st
what seem to be the rules of thegame of mternational m-
teraction; they then consider the distribution of strength,
weapons, strategic points, grievances, etc., over the geogra-
phy and the identified nations. They then ask the computers
to compute what should be our next move to minimize the
chances of our losing the game. The computer then cranks
and heaves and gives an answer, and there is some tempta-
tion to obey the computer. After all, if you follow ,the com-
puter you are a little less responsible than if you made up.
your own mind.
But if you do what the computer advises, you assert by
that move that you support the rules of the game which you
fed into the computer. You have affirmed the rules of that
game.
.
No doubt nations of the other side also have computers
and are playing similar games, and are affirming the rules of
the game that they are feeding to their comput~s. The ,re-
sult is a system in which the rules of international mteraction
become more and more rigid.
I submit to you that what is wrong with the international
field is that the rules need changing. The question is not
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
477
what is the best thing to do within the rules as they are at
the moment. The question is how can we get away from the
rules within which we have been operating for the last ten
or twenty years, or since the Treaty of Versailles. The prob-
le~ is .to c~nge the rules, and insofar as we let our cyber-
netic mventions-the computers-lead us into more and
more rigid situations, we shall in fact be maltreating and
abusing the first hopeful advance since 1918.
~d, of course, there are other dangers latent in cyber-
netics and many of these are still Unidentified. We do not
knGW, for example, what effects may follow from the com-
puterization of all government dossiers.
But this much is sure, that there is also latent in cyber-
netics the means of achieving a new and perhaps more
human outlook, a means of changing our philosophy of con-
trol and a means of seeing our own follies in wider per-
spective.

error. The erroneous premises, in fact, work.
~
On the other hand, the premises work only up to a certain
t:,'j
limit, and, at some stage or under certain circumstances, if
l
you are carrying serious epistemolOgical errors, you will find
I
that they do not work any more. At this point you discover
,
I
to your horror that it is exceedingly difficult to get rid of the
J
error, that it's sticky. It is as if you had touched honey. As
with honey, the falsification gets around; and each thing you
try to wipe it off on gets sticky, and your hands still remain
sticky.
Long ago I knew intellectually, and you, no doubt, all
know intellectually, that you do not see me; but I did not
really encounter this truth until I went through the Adelbert
Ames experiments and encountered circumstances
under
which my epistemolOgical error led to errors of action.
Let me describe a typical Ames experiment with a pack
of Lucky Strike cigarettes and a book of matches. The Lucky
Strikes are placed about three feet from the subject of ex-
periment supported on a spike above the table and the
matches are on a similar spike six feet from the subject.
Ames had the subject look at the table and say how big the
objects are and where they are. The subject will agree that
they are where they are, and that they are as big as they
are, and there is no apparent epistemological error. Ames
then says, "I want' you to lean down and look through this
plank here." The plank stands vertically at ,the end of the
table. It is just a piece of wood with a round hole in it, and
yol,l look through the hole. Now, of course, you have lost
use of one eye, and you have been brought down so that
you no longer have a crow's-eye view. But you still see the
Lucky Strikes where they are and 'of the size which they
are. Ames then said, "Why don't you get a parallax effect
by sliding the plank?" You slide the plank sideways and sud-
denly your image changes. You see a little tiny book of
matches about half the size of the original and placed three
feet from you; while the pack of Lucky Strikes appears to be
twice its original size, and is now six feet away.
This effect is accomplished very simply. When you slid
the plank, you in fact operated a lever under the table
which you had not seen. The lever reversed the parallax
effect; that is, the lever caused the thing which was closer

First, I would like you to join me in a little experiment.
Let me ask you for a show of hands. How many of you will
agree that you see me? I see a number of hands-so I guess
insanity loves company. Of ·course, you don't "really" see me.
What you "see" is a bunch of pieces of information about
me, which you synthesize into a picture image of me. You
make that image. It's that simple.
The proposition "I see you" or "You see me" is a proposi-
tion which contains within it what I am calling "epistemol-
ogy." It contains within it assumptions about how we get in-
formation
what sort of stuff information is, and so forth.
~
When yo~ say you "see" me and put up your hand in an
innocent way, you are, in fact, agreeing to certain proposi-
tions about the nature of knowing and the nature of the
universe in which we live and how we know about it.
I shall argue that inany of these propositiOns happen to be
false, even though we all share them. In the case of such
epistemological propositions, error is not easily detected and
is not very quickly punished. You and I are able to get along
in the world and fly to Hawaii and read papers on psychiatry
and find our placeg around these tables and in general

to you to travel with you, and thatwhich was far from you to
get left behind.
Your mind has been trained or genotypically determined
-and there is much evidence in favor of training-to do the
mathematics necessary to use parallax to create an image in
depth. It performs this feat without volition and without
your consciousness. You cannot control it.
I want to use this example as a paradigm of the sort of
error that I intend to talk about. The case is simple; it has
experimental backing; it illustrates the intangible nature of
epistemological error and the difficulty of changing episte-
mological habit.
.
!
In my everyday thinking, I see you, even though I know
intellectually that I don't. Since about 1943 when I saw the
experiment, I have worked to practice living in the world
of truth instead of the world of epistemological fantasy; but I
don't think I've succeeded. Insanity, after all, takes psycho-
therapy to change it, or some very great new experience.
Just one experience which ends in the laboratory is in-
sufficient.
This morning, when we were discussing Dr. Jung's paper,
I raised the question which nobody was. willing to treat
seriously, perhaps because my tone of voice encouraged
them to smile. The question w~ whether there are true
ideologies. We find that different peoples of the world have
different ideologies, diHerent epistemofogies, different ideas
of the relationship between man and nature, diHerent ideas
about the nature of man himself, the nature of his 'knowl-
edge, his feelings, l\lnd his will. But if there we~e a truth
about these matters, then only those social groups which
thought according to that truth could reasonably be stable.
And if no culture in the world thinks according to that truth,
then there would be no stable culture.
Notice again that we face the question of how long it takes
to come up against trouble. Epistemological error is often
reinforced and therefore self-validating. You can get along
all right in spite of the fact that you entertain at rather deep
levels of the mind premises which are simply false.
I think perhaps the most interesting-though still incom-
plete--scientific discovery of the twentieth century is the
discovery of the nature of mind. Let me outline some of the
ideas which have contributed to this discovery. Immanuel
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
481
Kant, in the .C'?tiqueof ~udgment, states that the primary
act of aesthetic Judgment IS selection of a fact. There are, in
a sense, no facts in nature; or if you like, there are an infinite
number of potential facts in nature, out of which the judg-
ment .selects a few which become truly facts by that act of
selection. Now, put beside that idea of Kant Jung's insight in
Seven Sermons to the Dead, a strange document in which
he points out that there are two worlds of explanation or
worlds of understanding, the pleroma and the creatura. In
the.pleroma there are only forces and impacts. In the cre-
attqa, there is diHerence. In other words, the pleroma is the
world of the hard sciences, while the creatura is the world
of communication and organization. A diHerence cannot be
localized. There is a difference between the color of this
desk and the color of this pad. But that difference is not in
the pad, it is not in the desk, and I cannot pinch it between
them. The difference is not in the space between them. In
a word, a difference is an id,3a.
-:he world of creatura is that world of explanation in
w!Uch effects are brought about by ideas, essentially by
differences.
If now we. put Kant's insight together with that of Jung, we
create a philosophy which asserts that there is an infinite
number of differ~nces in this piece of chalk but that only a
few of these differences make a difference. This is the
episte~olo?ca~ base for information theory. The unit of in-
fo~ati~n IS diHerence. In fact, the unit of psycholOgical in-
put IS diHerence.
The whole energy structUre of the pleroma-the forces
and impacts of the hard sciences~have Hawn out the win-
dow, so far as explanation within creatura is concerned. Mter
all, zero differs from one, and zero therefore can be a
cause, which is not admissible in hard science. The letter
which you did not write can precipitate an angry reply,
because zero can be one-half of the necessary bit of infor-
mation. Even sameness can be a cause
because sameness
diHers from diHerence.
. '
These strange relations obtain because we organisms (and
many of the machines that we make) happen to be able to
store energy. We happen to have the necessary circuit struc-
ture so that our energy expenditure can be an inverse func-
tion of energy input. If you kick a stone, it moves with

482
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
energy which it got from your· kick. H you kick a. dog. it
moves with the energy which it got from its meta~olism. An
amoeba will, for a considerable period of time, move more
when it is hungry. Its energy expenditure is an inverse
function of energy input.
These strange creatural effects (which do not occur
~n
the pleroma) depend also upon circuit structure, and a CIr-
cuit is a closed pathway (or network of pathways) along
which differences (or transforms of differences) are trans-
mitted.
Suddenly, in the last twenty years, these notions
ha~e
come together to give us a broad conception of the wo.rld ~
which we live--a new way of thinking about what a mmd IS.
Let me list what seem to me to be those essential minimal
characteristics of a system, which I will accept as character-
istics of mind:
(1) The system shall operate with and upon differences.
(2) The system shall consist of closed loops or networ~
of pathways along which differences an.d transfOl:ms of dif-
ferences shall be transmitted.
(What IS transmItted on a
neuron is not an impulse, it is news of a difference.)
(3) Many events within the system shall be energized by
the respondent part rather than by impact from the trigger-
ing part.
(4) The system shall show seH-correctiveness in the di-
rection of homeostasis and/or in the direction of runaway.
SeH-correctiveness implies trial and error.
Now, these minimal characteristics of mind ~e generated
whenever and wherever the appropriate circuit structure of
causal loops
exi.sts~ Mind is a necessary, an inevitable f~c­
tion of the appropriate complexity, wherever that compleXIty
occurs.
But that complexity occurs in a great many other places
besides the inside of my head and yours. We'll come
l~ter
to the question of whether a man or a computer has a mmd.
For the moment, let me say that a redwood forest or a coral
reef with its aggregate of organisms interlocking in their re-
lationships has the necessary general structure. The ener/?y
for the responses of every organism is supplied from Its
metabolism, and the total system acts seH-correctively in
various ways. A human society .is like this with closed loops
of causation. Every human organization shows both the seH-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
483
corrective characteristic and ihas the potentiality for runaway.
Now, let us consider for
a moment the question of
whether a computer thinks. I would state that it does not.
What "thinks" and engages in "trial and error" is the man
plus the computer plus the environment. And the lines
b~­
tween man, computer, and environment are purely arti-
ficial, DctitiOUS lines. They are lines across the pathways
along which information or difference is transmitted.. They
are not boundaries of the thinking system. What thinks IS
the total system which engages in trial and error, which is
man plus environment.'
.
But if you accept seH-correctiveness as the criterion of
thought or mental process, then obviously there is "thought"
going on inside the man at the ~u~onomic level to main~a~
various internal variables. And SImilarly, the computer, if It
controls its internal temperature, is doing some simple think-
ing within itseH.
Now we begin to see some of the epistemological fal-
lacies of Occidental civilization. In accordance with the gen-
eral climate of thinking in mid-nineteenth-century England,
Darwin proposed a theory of natural selection and evolution
in which the unit of survival was either the family line or the
species or subspecies or something of the sort. But today it
is quite obvious that this is not the unit of survival in the real
biological world. The unit of survival is organism plus en-
vironment. We are learning by bitter experience that the
'organism which destroys its environment destroys itseH.
H, now, we correct the Darwinian unit of survival to in-
clude the environment and the interaction betw,een organism
and environment, a very strange and surprising identity
emerges: the unit of evolutiotuiry survival tUfflSout to be
identical with the unit of mind.
Formerly we thought of a hierarchy of taxa-individual,
family line, subspecies, species, etc.-as units of survival. We
now see a different hierarchy of units-gene-in-organism,
organism-in-environment, ecosystem, etc. Ecology, in the
widest sense, turns out to be the study of the interaction and
survival of ideas and programs (i.e., differences, complexes
of differences, etc.) in circuits.
Let us now consider what happens when you make the
epistemological error of choosing the wrong unit: you end up
with the species versus the other species around it or versus

484
8tepe-to an~Ecology of Mind
the environment in which it operates. Man against nature.
You end up, in fact, with Kaneohe Bay polluted, Lake Erie a
slimy green mess, and "Let's build bigger atom bombs to kill
off the next-door neighbors." There is an ecology of bad
ideas, just as there is an ecology of weeds, and it is char-
acteristic of the system that basic error propagates itself. It
branches out like a rooted .parasite through the tissues of life,
and everything gets into a rather peculiar mess. When you
narrow down your. epistemology and act on the premise
"What interests me is me, or my organization, or my species,"
you chop off consideration of other loops of the loop struc-
ture. You decide that you want to get rid of the by-products
of human life and that Lake Erie will be a good place to put
them. You forget that the eco-mental system caUed Lake
Erie is a part of your wider eco-mental system-:-and that if
Lake Erie is driven insane, its insanity is incorporated in
the larger system of your thought and experience.
You and I are so deeply acculturated to the idea of "self"
and organization and species that it is hard to believe that
man might view his relations with the environment in any
other way than the way which I have rather unfairly blamed -
upon the nineteenth-century evolutionists. So I must say a
fewwords about the history of all this.
Anthropologically, it would seem from what we know of
the early material, that man in society took clues from the
natural world around him and applied those clues in a sort
of metaphoric way to the society in which he lived. That is"
he identified with or empathized with
th~ natural world
around him and took that empathy as a guide for his own
social organization and his own theories of his own psycholo-
gy. This was what is called "totemism."
In a way, it was all nonsense, but it made more sense than
most of what we do today, because the natural world around
us really has this general systemic structure and therefore is
an appropriate sour~e of metaphor to enable man to under-
stand himself in his social organization.
The next step, seemingly, was to reverse the process and
to take clues from himself and apply these to the natural
world around him. This was "animism," extending the notion
of personality or mind to mountains, rivers, forests, and such
things. This was still not a bad idea in many ways.' But the
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
485
next step was to separate the notion of mind from the natural
world, and then you get the notion of gods.
But when you separate mind from the structure in which
it is immanent, such as human relationship, the human so-
ciety, or the ecosystem, you thereby embark, I believe, on
fundamental error, which in the end will surely hurt you.
Struggle may be good -for your soul up to the moment
when to win the battle is easy. When you have an effective
enough technology so that you can really act upon your
epistemological errors and can create havoc in the world in
~hich ~ou li~~, then the error is lethal. Epistemological error
15 all rIght, It s fine, up to the point at which you create
around yourself a universe in which that error becomes im-
manent in monstrous changes of the universe that you have
created and now try to live in.
:ou see, ;re're not talking about the dear old Supreme
Mmd of Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, and so on down
through ages-the Supreme Mind which was incapable of
error a~d incaJ?abl~ of insanity. We're talking about imma-
nent mmd, which IS only too capable of insanity, as you all
p:ofe.ssionally know. This is precisely why you're here. These
CIrc,,?ts and balan~ o~ nature can only too easily get out
of l.tilter, and they meVltably get out of lkilter when certain
baSIC errors of our thought become reinforced by thousands
of cultural details.
I
d~n't know how ~any people today really believe that
there 15 an overall mmd separate from the body separate
from the society, and separate from nature. But fo~ those of
you who would say that that is all "superstition," I am pre-
pared to wager that I can demonStrate with them in a few
minutes tha~ ~e habits.an.d ways of thinking that went with
fuose supemtions are still m their heads and still determine a
]a~ge part of their thoughts. The idea that you cJn see me
still governs your thought and action in spite of the fact that
you may know intellectually that it is not so. In the same
way we are most of us governed by epistemologies that we
know to be wrong. Let us consider some of the implications
of what I have been saying.
Let us look at how the basic notions
ar~ reinforced and
expressed in all sorts of detail of how we behave. The very
fact that I am monologuing to you-this is a norm of
academic subculture, but the idea that I can -teach
y~':,

486
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
unilaterally, is derivative from the premise that the mind
controls the body. And whenever a psychotherapist lapses
into Wlilateral therapy, he is obeying the same premise. I, in
fact, standing up in front of you, am performing a subversive
act by reinforcing in your minds a piece of thinking which is
really nonsense. We all do it all the time because it's built
into the detail of our behavior. Notice how I stand-while you
sit.
The same thinking leads, of course, to theories of control
and to theories of power. In that Wliverse, if you do not get
what you want, you will blame somebody and establish
either a jail or a mental hospital, according to taste, and you
will pop them in it if you can identify them. If you cannot
identify them, you will say, "It's the system." This is roughly
where our kids are nowadays, blaming the establishment, but
you know the establishments aren't to blame. They are part
of the same error, too.
'
Then, of course, there is the question of weapons. If you
believe in that unilateral world and you think that the other
people believe in that .world (and you're probably right;
they do), then, of course, the thing is to get weapons, hit
them hard, and "control" them.
They say that power corrupts; but this, 1 suspect, is non-
sense. What is true is that the Ulea of power corrupts. Pow-
er corrupts most rapidly those who believe in it, and it is
they who will want it most. ObviOUSly our democratic system
tends to give powel\ to those who hunger for it and gives
every opportunity to those who don't want power to avoid
getting it. Not a very satisfactory arrangement if power
corrupts those who believe in it and want it.
Perhaps there is no such thing as unilateral power. Mter
all, the man "in power" depends on receiving information all
the time from outside. He responds to that information just
~ much as he "causes" things to happen. It is not possible
for Goebbels to control the public opinion of Germany be-
cause in order to do so he must have spies or legmen or
public opinion polls to tell him what the Germans are think-
ing. He must then trim what !lie says to this information; and
then again find out how they are responding. It is an inter-
action, and not a lineal situation.
But the myth of power is, of course, a very powerful myth
and probably most people in this world more or less believe
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
487
in it. It is a myth which, if everybody believes in it, becomes .
to that extent seH-validating. But it is still epistemological
lWlacy and leads inevitably to various sorts of disaster.
Last, there is the question of urgency. It is clear now to
many people that there are many catastrophic dangers which
have grown out of the Occidental errors of epistemology.
These range from insecticides to pollution, to atomic fallout,
to the pOSSibility of melting the Antarctic ice cap. Above all,
our fantastic compulsion to save individual lives has created
the pOSSibility of world famine in the immediate future.
Perhaps we have an even chance of getting through the
next twenty years with no disaster more serious than the
mere destruction of a nation or group of nations.
1 believe that this massive aggregation of threats to man
and his ecological systems arises out of errors in our habits of
thought at deep and partly unconscious levels.
As therapists, clearly we have a duty.
First, to achieve clarity in ourselves; and then to look for
every sign of clarity in others and to implement them and
reinforce them in whatever is sane in them.
And there are patches of sanity still surviving in the world.
Much of Oriental philsophy is more sane than anything the
West has produced, and some of the inarticulate efforts of
our own yOWlg people are more sane than the conventions
of the establishment.

The Roots of Ecological Crisis*
Summary: Other testimony has been presented regarding
bills to deal with particular problems of pollution and en-
vironmental degradation in Hawaii. It is hoped that the pro-
posed Office of Environmental Quality Control and the
Environmental Center at the University of Hawaii will go be-
yond this ad hoc approach and will study the more basic
causes of the.current rash of environmental troubles.
The present testimony argues that these basic causes lie
in the combined action of (a) technological advance; (b)
population increase; and (c) conventional (but wrong) ideas
about the nature of man and his relation to the environment.
It is concluded that the next five to ten years will be a
period like the Federa¥st period in United States history in
which the whole philosophy of government, education, and
technology must be debated.
'We submit:

wise. and sufficient if and only if either the disease is surely
terminalOf' will cure itself.
The history of DDT illustrates the fundamental fallacy of
ad hoc measures. When it was invented and first put to use, it
was itself an ad hoc measure. It was discovered in 1939 that
the stuff was an insecticide (and the discoverer got a Nobel
Prize). Insecticides were "needed" (a) to increase agricul-
tural products; and (b) to save people, especially troops
overseas, from malaria. In other words, DDT was a symp-
tomatic cure for troubles connected with the increase of
population.
By 1950, it was known to scientists that DDT was se-
riously toxic to many other animals (Rachel Carson's popular
book Silent Spring was P'l!blished in 1962).
But in the meanwhile, (a) there was a vast industrial
commitment to DDT manufacture; (b) the insects at which
DDT was directed were becoming immune; (c) the animals
which normally ate those insects were being exterminated;
(d) the population of the world was permitted by DDT to
increase.
In other words, the world became addicted to what was
once an ad hoc measure and is now known to be a major
danger. Finally in 1970, we begin to prohibit or control this
danger. And we still do not know, for example, whether the
human species on its present diet can surely survive the
DDT which is already circulating in the world and will be
there for the next twenty years even if its use is immedi-
ately and totally discontinued.
It is now reasonably certain (since the discovery of sig-
nificant amounts of DDT in the penguins of Antarctica) that
aU the fish-eating birds as well as the land-going carnivorous
birds and those which formerly ate insect pests are doomed.
It is probable that all the carnivorous fishl will soon contain
too much DDT for human cqnsumption and may themselves
become extinct. It is pOSSible that the earthworms, at least in
forests and other sprayed areas, will vanish-with what ef-

poisonous as carriers of mercury rather than DDT.

feet upon the forests is anybody'sguess. The plankton of
the high seas (upon which the entire planetary ecology de-
pends) is believed to be still unaffected.
That is the story of one blind application of an ad hoc
measure; and the story can be repeated for a dozen other
inventions.
(2) That the proposed combination of agencies in State
Government and in the University should address itself to
diagnosing, understanding and, if possible, suggesting reme-
dies for the wider processes of social and environmental
degradation in the world and should attempt to define Ha-
waifs policy in view of these processes.
(3) That aU of the many current threats to man's survival
are traceable to three root causes:
(a) technological progress
(b) population increase
(c) certain errors in the thinking and attitudes of
Occidental culture. Our "values" are wrong.
We believe that all three of these fundamental factors are
necessary conditions for the destruction of our world. In
other words, we optimistically believe that the correction of
anyone of them would save us.
(4) That these fundamental factors certainly interact. The
increase of population spurs technological progress and cre-
ates that anxiety which sets us against our environment as
an enemy; while technology both facilitates increase of pop_.
ulation and reinforces our arrogance, or "hubris," vis-a-vis the
natural environment.
The attached diagram illustrates the interconnections. It
will be noted that in this diagram each comer is clockwise,
denoting that each is by itself a self-promoting (or, as the
scientists say, "autocatalytic") phenomenon: the bigger the
population, the faster it grows; the more technology we have,
the faster the rate of new invention; and the more we be-
lieve in our "power" over an enemy environment, the more
"power" we seem to have and the more spiteful the environ-
ment seems to be.
Similarly the pairs of comers are clockwise connected to
,$
make three self-promoting suQsystems.
The problem facing the world and Hawaii is simply how
to introduce some anticlockwise processes into this system.
How to do this should be a major problem for the pro-

posed State Office of Environmental Quality Control and the
University Environmental Center.
It appears, at present, that the only possible entry point
for reversal of the process is the conventional attitudes to-
ward the environment.
(5) That further technological progress cannot now be
prevented but that it can possibly be steered in appropriate
directions, to be explored by the proposed offices.
(6) That the population explosion is the single most im-
portant problem facing. the world today. As long as popula-
tion continues to increase, we must expect the continuous
creation of new threats to survival, perhaps at a rate of one
per year, until we reach the ultimate condition of famine
(which Hawaii is in no position to face). We offer no solu-
tion here to the population explosion, but we note that every
solution which we can imagine is made difficult or impos-
sible by the thinking and attitudes of Occidental culture.
(7) That the very first requirement for ecological stability
is a balance between the rates of birth and death. For bet-
ter or for worse, we have tampered with the death rate,
especially by controlling the major epidemic diseases and the
death of infants. Always, in any living (i.e., ecological) sys-
tem, every increasing imbalance will generate its own limit-
ing factors as side effects of the increasing imbalance. In the
present instance, we begin to know some of Nature's ways of
correcting the imbalance-smog, pollution, DDT poisoning,
industrial wastes, fam~e, atomic fallout, and war. But the
imbalance has gone so far that we cannot trust Nature- not to
overcorrect.
(8) That the ideas which dominate our civilization at the
present time date in their most virulent form from the In-
dustrial Revolution. They may be summarized as:
(a) It's us against the environment.
(b) It's us against other men.
(c) It's the individual (or the individual company, or
the individual nation) that matters.
(d) We can have unilateral control over the environ-
ment and must strive for that control.
(e) We live within an infinitely expanding "frontier."
(f) Economic determinism is common sense.
(g) Technology will do it for us.
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
493
We submit,that these ideas are simply proved false by the
great but ultimately destructive achievements of our tech-
nology in the last 150 years. Likewise they appear to be
false under modem ecological theory. The creature that wins
against its environment destroys itself.
(9) 1,?at o~er attitudes and premi~es-other systems of
human
values -have governed man s relation to his en-
vironment and his fellow man in other civilizations and at
other times. Notably, the ancient Hawaiian civilization and
the Hawaiians of today are unconcerned about Occidental
''hubris.'' In other words, our way is not the only possible hu-
man way. It is conceivably changeable.
(10) That change in our thinking has already begun-
among
sci~n~ts and
philosopher~, and among young peo-
pl~. But It
18 not only
long~harred professors and long-
harred youth who are changing their ways of thought.
There are also many thousands of businessmen and· even
legislators who wish they could change but feel that it
would be unsafe or not "common sense" to do so. The
changes will continue as inevitably as technological progress.
(11) That these c~anges in thought will impact upon our
g~v~rnment, economIC structure, educational philosophy, and
ml1itary stance because the old premises are deeply built
into all these sides of our society.
(12) That nobody can predict what new patterns will
emerge from these drastic changes. We hope that·the period
o~ chan~e may be characterized by wisdom, rather than by
eIther vlOlence or the fear of violence. Indeed the ultimate
goal of this bill is to make such a transition pOSSible.
(.13) We conclude that the next five to ten years will be a
P?nod comparable to the Federalist period in United States
history. New philosophies of government, education, and
~echnology ~ust be debated both inside the government and
m the public press, and especially among leading citizens.
The University of Hawaii and the State Government could
take a lead in these debates.·

It appears that the man-enviroDIIient system has certainly
been progressively unstable since the introduction of metals,
the wheel, and script. The deforestation of Europe and the
man-made deserts of the Middle East and North Mrica are
evidence for this statement.
Civilizations have risen and fallen. A new technology for
the exploitation of nature ora new technique for the exploi-
tation of other men permits the rise of a civilization. But
each civilization, as it reaches the limits of what can be ex-
ploited in that particular way, must eventually fall. The new
invention gives elbow room or flexibility, but the using up of
that flexibility is death.
Either man is too clever, in whioh case we are doomed, or
he was not clever enough to limit his greed to courses which
would not destroy the ongoing total system. I prefer the
second hypothesis.
It becomes then necessary to work toward a definition of
"high."
(a) It would not be wise (even if possible) to return to
the innocence of the Austi-alianaborigines,
the Eskimo,
and the Bushmen. Such a return would involve loss of the
wisdom which prompted the return and would only start
the whole process over.
(b) A "high" civilization should therefore be presumed
to have, on the technological side, whatever gadgets are
necessary to promote, maintain (and even increase) wisdom
of this general sort. This may well include computers and
romplex communication devices.
(c) A "high" civilization shall contain whatever is neces-
sary (in educational and religious. institutions) to maintain
the necessary wisdom in the human population and, to give
physical, aesthetic, and creative satisfaction to people. There
shall be a· matching between the flexibility of people and
that of the civilization. There shall .be diversity in the
civilization" not only to accommodate the genetic and experi-
ootial diversity of persons, but also to provide the flexibility
and "preadaptation" necessary for unpredictable change.
.(d) A "high" civilization shall be limited in its transactions
Ecology and Flexibility in Urban Civilization*

it will be convenient to have, not aspeciflc or

by ecologica{ health. Such a general notion will both guide
the collection of data and guide the evaluation of observed

I suggest then that a healthy ecology of human ClVI

tion would be defined somewhat as follows:
A single system of environment combined with. h!~h ~u­
man civilization in which the flexibility of the
Clviliza~on
shall match that of the environment to create an
ongolI~g
complex system, open-ended for slow change of even basIC
(hard-programmed) characteristics.

with environment. It shall consume unreplaceable natural re-
sources only as a means to facilitate necessary change (as a
chrysalis in metamorphosis must live on its fat). For the rest,
the metabolism of the civilization must depend upon the
energy income which Spaceship Earth derives from the sun.
In this connection, great technical advance is necessary. With
present technology, it is probable that the world could only
maintain a small fraction of its present human population,
using as energy sources only photosynthesis, wind, tide, and
water power.
Flexibility
To achieve, in a few generations, anything like the healthy
system dreamed of above or even to get out of the grooves
of fatal destiny in which our civilization is now caught, very
great flexfbility will be needed. It is right, therefore, to ex-
amine this concept with some care. Indeed, this is a crucial
concept. We should evaluate not so much the values and
trends of relevant variables as the relation between these
trends and ecological flexibility.
Following Ross Ashby, I assume that any biological sys-
tem (e.g., the ecological environment, the human civiliza-
tion, and the system which is to be the combination of these
two) is describable in terms of interlinked' variables such
that for any given variable there is an upper and a lower
threshold of tolerance beyond which discomfort, pathology,
and ultimately death must occur. Within these limits," the
variable can move (and is moved)
in order to achieve
adaptation. When, under stress, a variable must take a value
close to its upper or lower limit of tolerance, we shall say,
borrowing a phrase from the youth culture, that the system
is "up tight" in respect to this variable, or lacks "flexibility"
in this respect.
But, because the variables are interlinked, to be up tight
in respect to one variable commonly means that other vari-
ables cannot be changed without pushing the up-tight vari-
able. The loss of flexibility thus spreads through the system.
In extreme cases, the system will only accept those changes
which change the tolerance limits for the up-tight variable.
For
example,
an
overpopulated
society
looks for
those
-i
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
497
ch~nges .(increased food, new roads, more houses, etc. )
which WIll make the pathological and pathogenic conditions
of overpopulation more
comfortable.
But these ad
hoc
changes are precisely those which in longer time can lead
to ~ore fundam~ntal ecolo!pcal pathology.
.
The pathologtes of our time may broadly be said to be the
a?~um.ulated results of this process-the eating up of flexi-
bility ill response to stresses of one sort or another (especially
th.e stress of population pressure) and the refusal to bear
WI0 those by-products of stress (e.g., epidemics and famine)
which are the. age-old correctives for population excess.
. The ecol?gtcal analyst faces a dilemma: on the one hand,
if any of his recommendations are to be followed, he must
first recommend whatever will give the system a positive
?u.d%et.of fl~bility; and on the other hand, the people and
illSti~tiOns WIth which he must deal have a natural pro-
pen~l~ to eat up all available flexibility. He must create
fleXIbIlity and prevent the civilization from immediately ex-
panding into it.
.
I~
~?llows that while the ecologist's goal is to increase
fleXIbility, and to this extent he is less tyrannical than mo:';t
welfare planners (who tend to increase legislative control)
he. must also exert authority to preserve such flexibility
a~
eXISts or can be created. At this point (as in the matter of
unreplaceable natural resources), his recommendations must
be tyrannical.
Social flexibility is a resource as precious as oil or titanium
a~d must be budgeted in appropriate ways, to be spent
(~e fat) .u:p?n ~eeded change. Broadly, since the "eating
up
of fleXIbility IS due to regenerative (i.e., escalating) sub-
systems within the civilization, it is, in the end, these that
must be controlled.
It is w.orth noting here that flexibility is to specialization as
entropy IS to negentropy. Flexibility may be defined as un-
commited potentiality for change.

,

498
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
It will be noted that the budget of flexibility is fractionat-
ing (not subtractive, as is a budget of money or energy).
The Distribution of Flexibility
Again following Ashby, the distribution of flexibility among
the many variables of a system is a matter of very great
importance.
The healthy system, dreamed of above, may be compared
to an acrobat on a high wire. To maintain the ongoing truth
of his basic premise ("I am on the wire"), he must be free to
move from one position of instability to another, i.e., certain
variables such as the position of his anns and the rate of
movement of his arms must have great flexibility, which he
uses to maintain the stability of other more fundamental and
general characteristics. If his arms are fixed or, paralyzed
(isolated from communication), he must fall.
In this connection, it is interesting to consider the ecology
of our legal system. For obvious reasons, it is difficult to con-
trol by law those basic ethical and abstract principles upon
which the social system depends. Indeed, historically, the
United States was founded upon the premise of freedom of
religion and freedom of thought-the separation of Church
and State being the classic example.
.
On the other hand, it is rather easy to write laws which
shall fix the more episodic and superficial details of human
b
avior. In other words, as laws proliferate, our acr:obat is
progressively limited in his arm movement but is given free
permission to fall off the wire.
Note, in passing, that the analogy of the acrobat can be
applied at a higher level. During the period when the acro-
bat is learning to move his anns in an appropriate way, it is
necessary to have a safety net under him, i.e., precisely to
give him the freedom to fall off the wire. Freedom and flex-
ibility in regard to the most basic variables may be necessary
during the process of learning and creating a new system
by social change.
These are paradoxes of order and disorder which the
ecological analyst and planner must weigh.
Be all that as it may, it is at least arguable that the trend
of social change in the last one hundred years, especially.in
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
499
the USA, has been towards an inappropriate distribution of
flexibility among the variables of the civilization. Those vari-
ables which should be flexible have been pegged, while
those which should be comparatively steady, changing only
slowly, have been cast loose.
But, even so, the law is surely not the appropriate method
for stabilizing the fundamental variables. This should be
done by the processes of education and character fonnation
-those parts of our social system which are currently and
expectably undergoing maximum perturbation.
The Flexibility of Ideas
A civilization runs 011 ideas of all degrees of generality.
These ideas are present (some explicit, some implicit) in
the actions and interactions of persons-some conscious and
clearly defined, others vague, and many unconscious. Some
of these ideas are widely shared, others differentiated in
various subsystems of the society.
If a budget of'flexibility is to be a central component of
!
our
understanding
of
how
the
environment-civilization
works, and if a category of pathology is related to unwise
spending of this budget, then surely the flexibility of ideas
!
will play an important role in our theory and practice.
A few examples of basic cultural ideas will make the mat-
tei' clear:
"The Golden Rule," "An eye for an eye," and "Justice."
"The common sense of scarcity economics" versus "The
common sense of afIluence."
"The name o( that thing is 'chair'" and many of the
reifying premises of language.
''The -survival of the fittest" versus "The survival of
organism-plus-environment."
Premises of mass production, challenge, pride, etc.
The premises of transference, ideas about how character
is determined, theories of education, etc.
Patterns of personal relatedness, doininance, love, etc.

500
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
Th~ ideas in a civilization are (like all other variables)
interlinked, partly by some sort of psycho-logic and partly by
consensus about the quasi-concrete effects of action.
. It is c;haracteristic of this complex network of determina-
tion of Ideas (and actions) that particular links in, the net
are ofte.n weak bu~ th~t any given idea or action is subject
to multiple determmation by many interwoven strands We
turn off th~ light whe~.we go to bed, influenced. par~y by
the economIcs of scarCIty, partly by premises of transference
partly by ideas of privacy, partly to reduce sensory input'
etc.'
'
This multiple determination is characteristic of all biologi-
cal :fi~lds. Characteristically, every feature of the anatomy of
an aromal or plant and every detail of behavior is determined
by a.mul~tude of interacting factors at both the genetic and
physlOloW;cal· levels; and, correspondingly, the processes of
any ongomg ecosystem are the outcome of multiple deter-
mination.
~ore~ver; it is r~ther unusual to find that any feature of
a b.1010~cal system ~ at all directly determined by the need
w~ch It fulfill.s. Eating is governed by appetite, habit, and
SOCIal convention rather than by hunger, and respiration is
governed by CO2 excess rather than by oxygen lack. And so
on.
In contrast, the products of human planners and engineers
~e constructed to meet specified needs in a much more
~rrect manner, and are correspondingly less viable. The mul-
tiple .causes of eatibg are likely to ensure the performance
of this necessary act under a large variety of circumstances
and stre~ses wher~as, if eating were controlled only by hypo-
glycaemIa, any disturbance of the single pathway of control
would result in death. Essential biological functions are not
controlled by lethal variables, and planners will do well to
note this fact.
Against this complex background, it is not easy to con-
struct a theory of flexibility of ideas and to conceive of a
budget of flexibility. There are, however, two clues to the
major theoretical problem. Both of these are derived nom
the stochastic process of evolution or .learning whereby such
interlocked systems of ideas come into being. First we con-
sider the "natural selection" which governs which ideas shall
Steps f.o an Ecology of Mind
501
survive longest; and second we shall consider how this pro-
cess sometimes works to create evolutionary culs-de-sac.
(More broadly, I regard the' grooves of destiny into which
our civilization has entered as a special case of evolutionary
cul-de-sac. Courses which offered short-term advantage have
been adopted, have become rigidly programmed, and have
begun to prove disastrous over longer time. This is the
paradigm for extinction by way of loss of flexibility. And this
paradigm is more surely lethal when the courses of action
are chosen in order to maximize single variables.)
.
In a simple learning experiment (or any other experi-
ence), an organism, especially a human being, acquires a
vast variety of information. He learns something about the
smell of the lab; he learns something about the patterns of
the experimenter's behavior; he learns something about his
own capacity to learn and how it feels to be "right" or
"wrong"; he learns that there is "right" and "wrong" in the
world. And so on.
U he now is subjected to another learning experiment (or
experience), he will acquire some new items of information:
some of the items of the first experiment will be repeated or
affirmed; some will be contradicted.
In a word, some of the ideas acquired in the first experi-
ence will survive the second experience, and natural selec-
tion will tautologically insist that those ideas which survive
will survive longer than those which do not survive.
But in mental evolution, there is also an economy of flexi-
bility. Ideas which survive repeated use are actually han-
dled in a special way which is different from the way in
which the. mind handles new ideas. The phenomenon of
habit formation sorts out the ideas which survive repeated
use and puts them in a more or less separate category. These
trusted ideas then become available for immediate use with-
out thoughtful inspection, while the more flexible parts of
the mind can be saved for use on newer matters.
In other words, the frequency of use of a given idea be-
comes a determinant of its survival in that ecology of ideas
which we call Mind; and beyond that the survival of a
frequently used idea is further promoted by the fact that
habit formation tends to remove the idea from the field of
critical inspection.
B1}.t the survival of an idea is also certainly determined by

502
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
its relations with other ideas. Ideas may support or contradict
each other; they may combine more or less readily. They
may influence each other in cOmplex unknown ways in polar-
ized systems.
It is commonly the more generalized and abstract ideas
that survive repeated use. The more generalized ideas thus
tend to become premises upon which·other ideas depend.
These premises become relatively inflexible.
In other words, in the ecology of ideas there is an evolu-
tionary process, related to the economics of flexibility, and
this process determines which ideas shall become hard pro-
grammed.)
The same process determines that these hard-programmed
ideas become nuclear or nodal within constellations of other
ideas, because the survival of these other ideas depends on
how they fit with the hard-programmed ideas.1 It follows
that any change in the hard-programmed ideas may involve
change in the whole related constellation.
But frequency of validation of an idea within a given
segment of time is not the same as proof that the idea is
either true or pragmatically useful over long time. _We are
discovering today that several of the premises which are
deeply ingrained in our way of life are simply untrue and
become pathogenic when implemented with modern tech-
nology.
Exercise of Flexibility
It is asserted above that the overall flexibility of a system
depends upon keeping many of its variables in the middle
of their tolerable limits. But there is a partial converse of
this generalization:
I Analogous relations certainly obtain in the ecology of
a redwood forest or a coral reef. The most frequent
or "dominant" species are likely to be nodal to constella-
tions of other species, because the survival of a new-
comer to the system will commonly be determined by
how its way of life fits with that of one or more domi-
nant species.
In these contexts-both ecological and mental-the
word "fit" is a low-level analogue of "matching flexibil-
ity."
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
503
Owing to the fact that inevitably many of the subsystems
of the society are regenerative, the system as a whole tends
to "expand" into any area of unused freedom.
It used to be said that "Nature abhors a vacuum," and
indeed something of the sort seems to be true of unused
potentiality for change in any biological system.
In other words, if a given variable remains too long at
some middle value, other variables will encroach upon its
freedom, narrowing the tolerance limits until its freedom to
move is zero or, more precisely, until any future movement
can only be achieved at the price of disturbing the encroach-
ing variables.
In other words, the variable which does not change its
value becomes Ipso facto hard programmed. Indeed, this
way of stating the genesis of hard-programmed variables is
only another way of describing habit formatwn.
As a Japanese Zen master once told me, "To become
accustomed to anything is a terrible thing."
From all of this it follows that to maintain the flexibility
of a given variable, either that flexibility must be exercised,
or the encroaching variables must be directly controlled.
We live in a civilization which seems to prefer prohibition
to positive requirement, and therefore we try to legislate
(e.g., with antitrust laws) against the encroaching variables;
and we try to defend "civil liberties" by legally slapping the
wrists of encroaching authority.
We try to prohibit certain encroachments, but it might be
more effective to enoourage people to know their freedoms
and flexibilities and to use them more often.
In our civilization, the exercise of even the physiological
body, whose proper function is to maintain the flexibility of
many of its variables by pushing them to extreme values,
becomes a "spectator sport," and the same is true of the
flexibility of social norms. We go to the movies or the courts
--<>r read newspapers-for vicarious experience of excep-
tional behavior.
The Transmission of Theory
A first question in all application of theory to human prob-
lems copcerns the education of those who are to carry out

504
Steps. to an Ecology of Mind
the plans. This paper is primarily a presentation of theory
to planners; it is an attempt at least to make some theoretical
ideas available to them. But in the restructuring of a great
city over a period of ten to thirty years, the plans and their
execution must pass through the heads and hands of hun-
dreds of persons and dozens of committees.
Is it important that the right things be done for the right
reasons? Is it necessll.r)' that those who revise and carry out
plans should understand the ecolOgical insights which guided
'
the planners? Or should the original planners put into the
'
very fabric of their· plan collateral incentives which will se-
duce those who come later into carrying out the plan for
reasons quite different from those which inspired the plan?
This is an ancient problem in ethics and one which (for
example) besets every psychiatrist. Should he be satisfied
if his patient makes a readjustment to conventional life for
•
neurotic or inappropriate reasons?
The question is not only ethical in the conventional sense,
it is also an ecological question. The means by which one
man influences another are a part of the ecology of ideas in
their relationship, and part of the larger ecological system
within which that relationship exists.
'T,he hardest saying in the Bible is that of St. Paul, ad-
dressing the Galatians: "God Is not mocked," and this saying
applies to the relationship between man and his ecology. It is
of no use to plead that a particular sin of pollution or ex-
ploitation was only a little one or that it was unintentional
or that it was committed with the best intentions. Or that
"If I didn't, somebody else would have." The processes of
ecology are not mocked.
On the other hand, surely the mountain lion when he kills
the deer is not acting to protect the grass from overgrazing:
In fact, the problem of how to transmit our ecological
reasoning to those whom we wish to influence in what seems
to us to be an ecologically "good" direction is itself an eco-
logical problem. We are not outside the ecology for which
we plan-we are always and inevitably a part of it.
th
Herein lies the charm and the terror of ecology-thatj
...:.C...:.....
e ideas of this ·science are irreversibly becoming a part of
our own ecosocial system.
-!
We live then in a world different from that of the moun-
Steps to an Ecology of Mind
505
tain lion-he is neither bothered nor blessed by having
ideas about ecology. We are.
I believe that these ideas are not evil and that our great-
est (ecological) need is the propagation of these ideas as
they develop-and as they are developed by the (ecologi-
cal) process of their propagation.
If this estimate is correct, then the ecological ideas im-
plicit in our plans are more important than the plans them-
selves and it would be foolish to sacrifice these ideas on the
altar ~f pragmatism. It will not in the long run pay to "sell"
the plans by superficial ad hominem arguments which will
conceal or contradict the deeper insight.
