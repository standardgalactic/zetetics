c. Community status: TBD. 
d. City status: Planner - Connie Chauv. Submittal on Feb. 18. 
e. NC status: PLUM voted to oppose Specific Plan Exception that would allow 
encroachment into ROW for additional 10 ft. to provide a full front yard setback 
(15 ft. required, 5 ft. provided onsite, additional 10 ft. provided in ROW via R-
Permit). 
f. Motion: Request that developer purchase the ROW at market-rate price, instead 
of obtaining an R-Permit. 
i. Justification: An R-Permit does not guarantee that the space will be 
provided in perpetuity, and if the city reclaims it, the houses will not have 
a full front yard. Only the purchase of land will allow for a front yard in 
perpetuity.

8. Motions: Tennessee Pl. triangle.

Making a Difference in Your Neighborhood 
i. Justification: The Expo TNP upzoning will bring thousands of new 
residents to the neighborhood, but the city did not provide for any parks or 
open space for them. This location is centrally located and its shape 
makes it difficult to build housing. Our city is park poor, and the city 
intends to build no new parks in our N.C. district. 
b. Motion: Request that BOE, DOT and Planning Dept. reduce the width of 
Tennessee Ave. and Tennessee Place (east of Bundy) to 60 ft, (40 ft. roadway + 
10 ft sidewalks) and builder wider public sidewalks with green landscaping 
parkways. 
i. Justification: Current width of ~78 ft. is excessively wide, and 20 ft. wider 
than the Local Road designation, which is typical for similar 
neighborhoods. Our neighborhood has 32% vacancy for street trees, and 
this land can be used to plant more trees. 
c. Motion: Request that BOE, DOT and Planning Dept. reduce the width of 
Tennessee Ave. and Tennessee Place (east of Bundy) to 60 ft, (40 ft. roadway + 
10 ft sidewalks) and vacate extra land to property owners, but mandate that 
green landscaping must be constructed (not buildings). 
i. Justification: Current width of ~78 ft. is excessively wide, and 20 ft. wider 
than the Local Road designation, which is typical for similar 
neighborhoods. 
9. Motion: Request that City revise the Exposition Station Transit Neighborhood Plan as 
follows: Building breaks shall be clarified and defined per the same standards of the 
Westside Multifamily Q Conditions (below) – buildings that exceed 150 ft. in length 
(reduced from 250 ft.) shall have a break that is at least 20 ft wide and landscaped as an 
amenity, continuous from the ground floor to the sky, and must extend back the entire 
building. Garage entrances shall not count as breaks. 
2. MASSING b. Any building that has more than 150 feet of frontage along a public street 
shall provide at least one vertical break beginning at the ground floor. This break 
shall be a minimum of 40 feet deep and 20 feet wide and shall be open to the sky. 
10. 2225 S. Amherst Ave. houses: New construction of 4 houses (3 stories). Demolition of 1 
house of 1-story height. 
2041? S. Barry Ave. houses: New construction of x houses (3 stories). Demolition of 1 
house of 1-story height. 
a. Application/plans: (click on "Amherst 2225" folder).

b. Community status: TBD. 
c. City status: Permits issued. 
d. NC status: First presentation for PLUM to be scheduled in March. 
e. Representative: Cory Singer, Thomas James Homes. 
f. Owner: Cory Singer, Thomas James Homes. 
11. Provisions for unions or prevailing wages on large construction projects. 
12. Bundy/Exposition/Amherst apartments: Developer will present at April or May meeting, 
per PLUM resolution in January. 
a. 2 apartments of 7-8 stories of 460 units (52 affordable), 429 parking spaces. 
Demolition of 16 houses. Removal of 54 trees: 
b. 2217-2227 S. Bundy Ave. & 2222-2244 S. Amherst Ave.: 1.3-acre site. 
Demolition of 9 1-story houses, and new construction of 8-story building (83 ft 
tall) with 265 units (30 extremely low-income). Total building area: 239,000 sf. 
Total open space (26,713 sf). Total green space: 2,985 sf. 2-level subterranean 
parking (239 spaces). 43,090 cy of excavation (3,792 truck trips). Removal of 39

Owner: Will Cipes, Carmel Partners, Bundy Expo LLC. 
13. Motion: Request that City revise the Westside Multifamily Q Conditions Ordinance 
#186249 to:  
a. Include APNs 0426-500-9175 and 0426-500-9176, which are currently exempted 
(11967-11973 Mayfield Ave., Brentwood). 
i. Justification: These are the only 2 parcels that are exempted, and they 
are rectangular and flat and the same as every other parcel on the block 
and in the area. 
b. Require that only 1 side of a corner lot be designated as a front setback, and the 
2nd frontage be designated as a side setback. 
i. Justification: Many parts of the LAMC consider the short side of a corner 
lot to be the front, and the long side to be the side setback. 
c. Clarify that sidewalk width must comply with ADA (4 ft wide). 
14. DWP-West L.A. facility:

i. Request to calculate EMF in neighborhood at various distances.

a. Ayres-Barrington apartment: Lighted sign. 
b. Olympic-Butler mixed-use: Neon lights on walls that face houses on Purdue Ave.. 
c. Lumen office: Bright lights on roof pavilion that shine outward to the street. 
17. West L.A. Community Plan update: 
a. Motion: Request that Planning Dept. provide zoning capacity of the city, in order 
to review proposals for upzoning. 
i. Justification: This information may be readily available because the City 
has completed and voted to approve its Housing Element, and it would 
need this information to approve a plan. Also, the Planning Dept. has 
spent two years studying demographics as part of the Westside 
Community Plans updates, and should have information available after 
two years. 
b. CD11 to lead supplemental tour. 
c. Determine if City has calculated population projections - Replies from Kinikia 
Gardner, Westside Plan Update: 
i. This information is disclosed when the DEIR is published.  
ii. In tandem with refining concepts based on all of last summer/fall 
feedback, the team is also working on understanding SCAG 
projections - and once the team is ready to share that information 
they will.  Planning staff does not do projections - SCAG 
demographers do.  After Scoping the staff will then again refine 
plan concepts and work on the Proposed Plan's reasonably 
anticipated development that may meet and/or exceed SCAG's 
projections.  
iii. In order to get there - we need to wrap up refining concepts and 
collect more feedback during the Scoping process. 
iv. In between Scoping and the DEIR publication there will be MORE 
outreach efforts to show progress and solicit feedback on the draft 
plan and zoning.  
d. Request for community to review a draft copy of the community plans to review, 
before the CEQA scoping starts and it's too late.

i. Yes, a preliminary draft of the emerging goals and policies is shared.  And an 
open house and/or outreach event is hosted to share the draft plan and 
draft zoning before the DEIR is published.  It takes 8-12 months - there are 
various factors that can prolong this time - in between a Scoping Meeting 
and a DEIR publication for a comprehensive and long range community 
plan update.

Other items (may or may not be considered at this meeting, pending time availability): 
7. Administrative:  
a. What does “we need housing” mean? 
i. Is it an excuse for developers to build as big as possible? 
ii. Does every project “need” to be as big as possible while providing 
miniscule open space and minimal landscaping? Or, should housing be 
built that blends with the neighborhood, does not impose on the older 
housing stock, yet still increase the unit count? 
b. Role of PLUM: 
i. Rubber-stamp for Planning Dept. and approve all project as long as they 
“comply” with zoning in our opinion (though only the Planning Dept. can 
determine that)? Or, shall we defend the long-time neighbors and 
character of the community by supporting reasonable, smart growth?  
1. See Exhibit: Letter from Gloria Campbell. 
ii. Is the minimally-required amount of required affordable housing OK for 
density bonus and TOC projects, or should we request more? 
c. NC reputation with Planning Dept. – do they actually hold NCs in low regard if 
NCs place conditions/ restrictions on projects to improve the project and protect 
the neighborhood?  
i. Which planners say the WLASNC requests unreasonable design 
revisions, and which planners hold them in low regard because of 
community input? 
d. Role of NC involvement: Desire of land owner vs. desire of community. NC is one 
of several community groups who can influence city. 
e. What does it mean when developers say “The Council Office supports it”? 
i. Examples of 1735 Westgate Ave. small lot subdivision and 1702 Granville 
Ave. small lot subdivision.

f. What does it mean when developers say “The Planning Dept. supports it” for 
small lot subdivisions? 
i. Consequential items (height, FAR, setbacks, open space) vs. non-
consequential items (design, articulation, color). 
g. Philosophy of PLUM and basis of decisions: Rubber stamp for Planning Dept., 
defer to developers for design decisions, vs. push back for better projects for 
community? 
i. Facts vs. speculation (i.e. hearsay). 
ii. City prohibition on decisions based on financial impact on owner, 
developer and neighbors. 
iii. Minutiae of Planning/Zoning Code vs. concept/vision of best way to 
integrate with existing neighborhood. 
h. Items of consideration: 
i. Condominiums vs. apartments. 
ii. Sales prices and rents. 
iii. Types of retail. 
 
8. Old/new/future business: 
a. Motion: Ban on campaign contributions by developers to City Councilmembers 
and support Councilman Ryu’s Motion (see exhibit). 
b. Motion: Planning Commissions appointees shall have defined terms (e.g. 5 
years). 
c. Motion: CD11 shall notify the NC of all meetings with developers and invite an 
NC member to attend. 
d. Motion: Planning Dept. staff reports shall list all meetings between the developer 
and Planning Dept., Planning Commissioners and Council District, and shall list 
all campaign contributions from developer employees and their spouses/ 
domestic partners to elected officials. 
e. Motion: PLUM shall recommend that the NC require commercial uses within 200 
ft. of residences to reduce nighttime noise after 10:00 pm to 35 decibels and/or 
prevent noise from leaving the site (per DBS code). 
f. Motion: Housing Committee proposal for addition of a “penalty of perjury” clause 
to forms required for demolition, giving the city the ability to punish developers 
who mislead planners about the project’s compliance with the rent stabilization 
ordinance. Prohibit condominium conversions unless neighborhood vacancy rate 
is 5% or more (see exhibit). 
g. Motion: Request status of Quimby/Parks funds available for NC district and 
possible uses (pocket parks, playground equipment, sports fields, Civic Center). 
h. Motion: CD11 and DOT shall audit parking meter revenue and designate traffic-
calming and other projects to fund. 
i. 
Parking ratios: Discussion of ratios for suburban, urban, and transit-oriented 
locations, leadership by government versus desires of drivers, increase in traffic 
caused by free parking, increase in global warming from car pollution (see 
exhibit).

Re: 
Resolution - 11835 Tennessee Pl. houses - opposition to Specific Plan Exception 
 
AA-2022-1158-PMLA-SL-HCA. ENV-2022-1157-EAF. APCW-2022-1156-SPE-HCA 
 
Resolution: The PLUM voted, 4-0-0, to recommend that the Board oppose the Specific Plan 
Exception to the Exposition Station Transit Neighborhood Plan, and authorize the Chair to 
submit Community Impact Statements in the future. 
 
Facts and background: 
1. The 2 proposed front yards (on both the north and south sides of the triangle parcel) are 5 
ft. long, which is 10 ft. shorter than the required 15 ft. yards for R3 zone. 
2. The developer requests a Revocable Permit to use 10 ft. of the public right-of-way to 
install a front yard with greenery.  
a. This 10-ft. area is already used by the owners for landscaping and yard areas. 
b. A new 5-ft. sidewalk with street trees would be installed outside the 10-ft. permit 
boundary, where the existing roadway asphalt is. 
3. The two streets that abut the property, Tennessee Ave. and Tennessee Pl., are wider (80 
ft.) than the current Local Street standard width of 60 ft. 
4. A large redwood tree is on the south portion of the site. 
 
Findings and justifications: 
1. Public land should not be given to private owners without market-rate compensation. 
2. Density is not the penultimate zoning standard. Compliance must be with all standards 
(FAR, height, setbacks, open space).  
a. A smaller building can be constructed on the site within the required density and 
setbacks. 
3. Neighbors like the wide street widths of Tennessee Ave. and Tennessee Pl., and do not 
wish to give up parts of them to private use. 
4. Variances may be granted if a community benefit is provided in return. 
5. A Revocable Permit cannot guarantee that the 10-ft. front yard will remain in perpetuity. 
If the permit is revoked, the property will have only a shorter 5-ft. front yard, which is 
insufficient for recreation use by families.

Resolution: The PLUM voted, 4-0-1, to recommend that the Board request the following design 
changes to the Bundy-Exposition-Amherst-Tennessee apartments, and authorize the Chair to 
submit Community Impact Statements in the future: 
 
1. Add 10 moderate income units to existing affordable units. 
2. Revise the affordability of existing for more diversity, i.e. instead of all extremely low 
income, replace with some low- and very low-income units. 
3. Sidewalk width of 13 ft. on Bundy Ave. frontage, and 15 ft. along Amherst and 
Tennessee Ave. (measured from curb to property line, does not include front setback 
area). 
4. Preserve all existing street trees along Amherst Ave. (currently proposed to be cut down). 
a. Developer shall protect them during construction, ensure sufficient soil for root 
growth and health, and maintain them in the future. 
5. Plant all onsite trees along the full perimeter of the site (all frontages) in soil that allows 
sufficient root growth and health (not in planters or pots). 
6. Plant a line of trees along the entire south frontages of both buildings adjacent to existing 
houses.  
a. Trees shall be planted in soil that allows sufficient root growth and health (not in 
planters or pots) 
7. No light shall trespass from balcony ceiling lights onto neighbors’ properties. Hoods shall 
be installed, and light shall be aimed toward the building, not the neighbors. 
a. The 2465 Purdue Ave. apartments installed balcony ceiling lights that shine 
directly into rear neighbors’ yards all night. 
8. The project shall provide outdoor public use facilities at ground level, adjacent to a public 
sidewalk, and note the specific size and space location on the plans (possibly the fitness 
green area on the north frontage). 
a. No Los Angeles public park is nearby, and the City failed to include public parks 
or open space in the Expo NTP Plan, despite upzoning large areas with thousands 
of future residents. Each new project in the area shall also contribution similar 
public use areas. 
9. The City shall not issue on-street parking permits for residents or guests of this project.

a. As a TOC project that receives incentives for reduced parking because residents 
and guests are expected to use transit, the residents and guests do not need street 
parking (plus they can use the garage). 
10. Truck staging shall be prohibited at all times in the residential neighborhood, i.e. 
Amherst, Tennessee, Wellesley, Carmelina, south side of Exposition. 
a. The contractor shall stage trucks away from the neighborhood and radio them in. 
11. Concrete trucks (or any trucks) shall not idle and line up waiting on residential streets 
under any circumstances, i.e. Amherst, Tennessee, Wellesley, Carmelina, south side of 
Exposition. 
a. The contractor shall stage trucks away from the neighborhood and radio them in. 
b. The Olympic/Butler project lined up concrete trucks, blocked traffic, and harmed 
the neighbors’ homes with loud noise and air pollution for hours, and the City did 
not cite them for violating the law. 
12. The City and LAPD, in concert with CD11, shall not issue any variances for noise 
permits for any work prior to 7:00 am under any circumstances (including concrete 
pours). 
a. The City and LAPD, in concert with CD11, approved noise variances for the 
Martin Cadillac (West Edge) project, which inundated the nearby residences with 
pile-driver/pump noise as early as 5:45 am several times. 
Carmel Partners plans 455 apartments near Expo/Bundy Station 
Replacing single-family housing in the Expo TNP area 
December 10, 2021, 8:30AMSteven Sharp 32 Comments  
 
Developer Carmel Partners is back with plans for another big multifamily residential 
development near a Westside stop on Metro's E Line. 
Earlier today, the Los Angeles Department of City Planning published an application from the 
San Francisco-based firm to redevelop 16 single-family homes just south of Expo/Bundy Station 
with two large apartment buildings. The project, if fully realized, would include 455 residential 
units - more than 50 of which would be earmarked for rent by lower-income households.

View of 2217 and 2301 S Bundy Drive from Amherst 
The first site, which spans approximately 1.3 acres at 2217-2227 S. Bundy Drive and 2222-2244 
S. Amherst Drive, is slated for the construction of an eight-story, 239,370-square-foot building 
containing 265 apartments above 239 parking stalls located at grade and in a two-level 
subterranean garage. 
Carmel is pursuing entitlements through the Transit Oriented Communities incentives, 
permitting relief from zoning regulations relative to building height, floor area, density, parking, 
open space, and lot coverage. As a trade-off, the developer will be required to set aside 30 of the 
proposed one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments for rent as affordable housing at the 
extremely low-income level. 
The companion project, slated for a one-acre site across Tennessee Avenue at 2301-2319 S. 
Bundy Drive and 2302-2312 S. Amherst Avenue, would be a second eight-story structure 
featuring 195 one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments atop semi-subterranean parking for 190 
vehicles.

Like the larger building across the street, proposed entitlements include Transit Oriented 
Communities incentives to achieve a larger building than otherwise permitted by zoning rules. In 
exchange, 22 of the apartments will be reserved as extremely low-income affordable housing. 
Both projects are being designed by Carrier Johnson + Culture, and are portrayed as 
contemporary podium-type buildings clad in plaster, concrete, and glass. Architectural plans 
show that each would include central courtyards, small roof decks, and common amenity rooms 
at street level. 
While Bundy Drive apartments are hardly the first development to sprout near an E Line Station, 
they are the first large projects to be developed within the confines of the Exposition Corridor 
Transit Neighborhood Plan, which established new base zoning for communities near stops in 
the Sawtelle, Rancho Park, and Palms communities. The blocks to the south of Expo/Bundy 
Station, developed in 1930s with single-family homes, were one of several areas "upzoned" to 
permit higher-density construction.

Expo/Bundy Station has also spawned the West Edge, a larger mixed-use project now under 
construction at the former site of Martin Cadillac that will include 600 apartments, a Gelson's 
supermarket, and a 200,000-square-foot office building leased by Riot Games. However, 
approval of that project predates the adoption of the Expo Neighborhood Plan in 2019. 
Carmel is one of the developers responsible for transforming neighborhoods around several E 
Line stops. In 2020, the company completed work on Linea, a 595-unit apartment complex with 
retail next to Expo/Sepulveda Station. The developer is also in the midst of construction on the 
Cumulus District, a sprawling complex next to La Cienega/Jefferson Station that will ultimately 
feature more than 1,200 apartments.
