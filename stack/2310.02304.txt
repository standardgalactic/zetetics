ABSTRACT
Several recent advances in AI systems (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts and Program-Aided
Language Models) solve problems by providing a “scaffolding” program that struc-
tures multiple calls to language models to generate better outputs. A scaffolding
program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we
use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start
with a seed “improver” that improves an input program according to a given utility
function by querying a language model several times and returning the best solution.
We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream
tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better
performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies
are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms,
and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered,
this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a
modern language model, GPT-4 in our proof-of-concept experiments, is capable
of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We consider concerns around
the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with
which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.

INTRODUCTION
A language model can be queried to optimize virtually any objective describable in natural language.
However, a program that makes multiple, structured calls to a language model can often produce
outputs with higher objective values (Yao et al., 2022; 2023; Zelikman et al., 2023; Chen et al.,
2022). We refer to these as “scaffolding” programs, typically written (by humans) in a programming
language such as Python. Our key observation is that, for any distribution over optimization problems
and any fixed language model, the design of a scaffolding program is itself an optimization problem.
In this work, we introduce the Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP), a method in which code that applies a
language model to improve arbitrary solutions is applied recursively to improve itself. Our approach
begins with an initial seed ‘improver’ scaffolding program that uses the language model to improve a
solution to some downstream task. As the system iterates, the model refines this improver program.
We use a small set of downstream algorithmic tasks to quantify the performance of our self-optimizing
framework. Our results demonstrate improvement when the model applies its self-improvement
strategies over increasing iterations. Thus, STOP shows how language models can act as their own
meta-optimizers. We additionally investigate the kinds of self-improvement strategies that the model
proposes (see Figure 1), the transferability of the proposed strategies across downstream tasks, and
explore the model’s susceptibility to unsafe self-improvement strategies.

Figure 2: Our seed improver. Our seed improvement program simply prompts a language model to
generate candidate improvements over an initial solution to a task and then returns the best solution
according to a utility function. STOP (Algorithm 1) uses this improver to recursively improve itself.
We refer to this problem as recursively self-improving code generation, which is inspired by but
not completely a Recursively Self-Improving (RSI) system because the underlying language model
remains unchanged. The idea of RSI dates back at least half a century, formalized by Good (1966)
and later by Schmidhuber (2003). However, that work focused on the development of more generally
capable systems and assumed that the model was permitted to refine every aspect of its code. Our work
is a small step in that direction, focusing only on the ability of the model to recursively improve the
scaffold that calls it. This paper first formulates the RSI-code-generation problem in a mathematically
well-defined fashion. We then define and evaluate STOP, which demonstrates the potential utility
of RSI-code-generation. Improvements are shown across a variety of downstream tasks. Figure 1
illustrates a number of the functional and interesting scaffolds proposed by STOP when using a
version of the GPT-4 language model (OpenAI, 2023b) trained on data up to 2021, well in advance of
the introduction of most scaffolding systems. Further experiments in Section 6.2 measure the rate at
which the model attempts to disable a sandbox flag. Lastly, Section 8 discusses concerns related to
the responsible advancement of such technologies.
Contributions. The main contributions in this work are (a) formulating an approach to meta-
optimization where a scaffolding system recursively improves itself, (b) demonstrating that this
system using a modern language model (GPT-4 in particular) can successfully recursively improve
itself, and (c) investigating the self-improvement techniques proposed and implemented by the model,
including the ways in which the model circumvents safety measures such as a sandbox.

RELATED WORK
Language Model Scaffolding. Many prompting strategies and scaffolds have been developed to
enable more systematic reasoning in language models (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; 2023;
Zelikman et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022a; Khattab et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022;
Sel et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023; Poesia et al., 2023). For example, scratchpads and chain-of-thought
rely on communicating to the model that it should work through a problem step-by-step (Nye et al.,
2021; Wei et al., 2022). Tree-of-Thoughts algorithmically scaffolds the model to consider branching
paths of reasoning steps (Yao et al., 2023). Graph of thoughts extends this, allowing other graph
operations (where nodes are reasoning steps), such as aggregation (Besta et al., 2023). Other work
has focused on letting models reason with access to an interpreter such as Program of Thoughts
prompting (Chen et al., 2022), Program-aided Language Models (Gao et al., 2023), Reflexion (Shinn
et al., 2023), or ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), while yet others formalized this scaffolding structure such
as Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) (Khattab et al., 2022), Language Model Cascades (Dohan et al.,
2022), or Cognitive Architectures (Sumers et al., 2023). Each work can be understood as the result of
researchers asking, “Given an imperfect language model, how can we provide structure to help it
solve problems?” In this work, we instead ask if the language model can design that structure for
itself and use its proposed structure to recursively improve that structure. Surprisingly, we even find
that GPT-4 naturally proposes several of these techniques despite not having them in its training data.

Language Models as Prompt Engineers. Work has also explored the ability of language models to
optimize prompts, such as the Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) (Zhou et al., 2022b) or, recently,
OPRO (Yang et al., 2023) and Promptbreeder (Fernando et al., 2023). Note that, for these, the goal
has consistently been to scaffold the language model to produce a prompt but not to scaffold it to
produce a better scaffolding (beyond prompting-only scaffolds like zero-shot chain of thought), nor
to produce a recursively applicable scaffolding. In other words, these prior works can be understood
as proposing particular new scaffolds for prompt engineering but not for proposing new scaffolds.
For example, while Promptbreeder (Fernando et al., 2023) could improve the prompts used in a given
scaffolding, it could not implement or improve such a scaffolding itself. But, we share the inspiration
of using the model to improve its reasoning without fine-tuning.
Language Model Self-Improvement. Prior work, such as STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022), demon-
strated that language models can learn to solve harder problems by learning from their reasoning
chains by filtering based on incorrect answers (as well as Huang et al. 2022, which explored the
specific case where a majority vote is used as the filter and Uesato et al. 2022, which emphasized the
value of checking the accuracy of the reasoning itself). Inspired by self-play in games, Haluptzok
et al. (2023) designed a self-improvement framework for code generation where a language model
generates novel problems for fine-tuning itself. However, our approach is orthogonal to these, as we
do not leverage fine-tuning and instead focus on a model’s ability to improve code that allows it to
solve problems. Other related works are Voyager (Wang et al., 2023), showing that a language model
can optimize the programs available to an embodied agent to improve exploration in the video game
Minecraft, and its contemporaneous work Language Models as Tool Makers (Cai et al., 2023).
Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI). RSI was suggested by Minsky (1966) and Good (1966), as
cited by Yampolskiy (2015). Schmidhuber (2003) first provided a rigorous formalization, wherein
a problem solver would leverage itself to solve iteratively harder problems by making provable
improvements to itself. Some of these principles are also highlighted in Schmidhuber (1987). Unlike
this work, we do not attempt to prove that scaffold improvements made by the model are optimal.
As mentioned, RSI code generation differs from full RSI because only the scaffolding is improved.
Additionally, many previous analyses involved selecting programs at random (i.e., “monkeys at
typewriters”) or enumeration with no dependence on the goal to be improved (Levin, 1973). In
contrast, using language models, we can describe the underlying goal in a prompt (which itself may be
improved). Intuitively, providing this goal may make program search more effective. Some work has
also suggested constraining the types of improvements (Nivel et al., 2013; Steunebrink et al., 2016)
so as to encourage improvements that mitigate dangerous behavior. Regarding implementations,
while efforts have been made for Gödel machines (Hall, 2007; Steunebrink & Schmidhuber, 2012),
our work is first to leverage language models for recursively self-improving code generation.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this section, we formulate the goal of selecting an improver via recursively self-improving code
generation. This is viewed as a computationally expensive “pre-optimization” step with benefits
that can be reaped in numerous downstream applications. First, we present definitions. Formally,
let Σ∗denote the set of finite text strings, and suppose we have a randomized black-box language
model L : Σ∗→Σ∗which can be used to generate code, given a query. A utility u = (ufunc, ustr) is
a pair where ufunc : Σ∗→R is a black-box, possibly randomized function that assigns real values to
solution strings; and ustr ∈Σ∗is a description which may simply be the source code of the function.
With a slight abuse of notation we write u(x) ≡ufunc(x) for solution x. A task τ = (u, s) is specified

by utility u and a solution s ∈Σ∗. In our applications, solutions s are strings representing the source
code of a program, but more generally any utility defined on strings can be used.
An improver I is a program1 that improves a task solution using a language model L:
s′ = I(u, s, L) ideally with high utility u(s′) ≫u(s).
Now, suppose that there is a distribution D over downstream tasks τ ∼D. Thus, the goal is to find an
improver program I that has high expected utility when used on a downstream task,
¯u(I) ≜E(u,s)∼D

u(I(u, s, L))

.
(1)
For training, we assume that we are given a collection of n downstream tasks D ∼Dn drawn
independently from distribution D. We define the meta-utility ˆu of an improver I as the average
utility over downstream training tasks,
ˆu(I) ≜
1
|D|
X
(u,s)∈D
u(I(u, s, L)).
The above equations define ¯ufunc and ˆufunc. For their description string, we use a common “grey-box”
description ¯ustr = ˆustr which is a description (e.g., source code) indicating that the utility is the
expectation over a set of downstream tasks, but the individual downstream tasks themselves are not
included in the description. This enables one to optimize over ˆu as an approximation to the actual
objective ¯u. In addition, our theoretical analysis in Appendix A provides simple conditions under
which optimizing ˆu also nearly optimizes ¯u.
Resource bounds. Appendix A also formalizes resource bounds on runtime and language mod-
els. Additionally, we note that one could apply an improver two or more times. For example,
ED[u(I(u, I(u, s, L), L))] would be the expected utility of using the improver twice. However, an
improver can also do this internally using whatever budget it has. Furthermore, as mentioned, the
selection of the improver is viewed as a pre-optimization to which we can devote significantly more
resources than to any given downstream task, of which there may be many. Hence, it is essential for
I to run much faster than the procedure for finding I.
Finally, Appendix A also gives an equivalent formulation of recursively self-improving code genera-
tion in terms of recursive maximization. However, in the maximization framework, no initial solution
must be given. In this paper, STOP adopts the improver formulation because we have found the initial
solution valuable for warm-starting the self-improvement process, but we suggest that the recursive
maximization framework is more amenable to theoretical analysis.
1Note that representing programs as strings enables us to sidestep defining the type of an improver.

SELF-TAUGHT OPTIMIZER (STOP)
Figure 3 provides a visual schematic of the self-improvement pipeline envisaged in Section 3, while
Algorithm 1 provides pseudocode for this Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP).
The key observation is that the selection of I is an optimization problem itself, to which we can
recursively apply improvement. STOP begins with an initial seed improver I0. We define the t-th
improver as the output of t successive rounds of self-improvement with meta-utility ˆu,
It ≜It−1(ˆu, It−1, L).
(2)
This is iterated for some prespecified number of iterations T, depending on available resources.
Intuition. By using ˆu, STOP selects improver based on a downstream utility improvement. This
approach is motivated by the intuition that improvers that are good at improving downstream solutions
may be more likely to be good scaffolding programs and thus to be good at self-improvement.
Similarly, the intuition is that selecting for single-round improvements may lead to better multi-round
improvements. In the maximization formulation, we discuss a meta-utility that covers both self-
optimization and downstream optimization but is more expensive to evaluate. In practice, we allow
the utilities and language model to impose budget constraints (e.g., limits on runtime or the number
of times the function can be called) and the initial solutions to be generated by humans or the model.
Moreover, the cost is then essentially O((budgetu + budgetL) ∗budgetˆu), where each budget term
corresponds to the number of times that function can be used by an improver.
Designing the seed improver. Our chosen seed improver (Figure 2) simply prompts the language
model to generate candidate improvements of an initial solution and then returns the best solution
according to the utility function. We chose this particularly simple form to provide nontrivial
improvement for a generic downstream task while 1) encouraging the language model to be as
“creative” as possible, 2) minimizing initial prompt complexity, since self-improvement introduces
additional complexity due to nested references to code strings inside of prompts, and 3) minimizing
the prompt token count and therefore the costs of querying a language model. We also considered
other variants of this seed prompt but heuristically found that this version maximized the novelty of
improver improvements proposed by the GPT-4 language model.
Describing the utility. To effectively convey the details of the utility function to the language model,
we provide the utility to the improver in two forms, as a callable function and as a utility description
string containing the essential elements of the utility source code (see Appendices E and F for
examples). This choice was made for the following reasons. The description allows us to clearly
convey budgetary constraints (e.g., on runtime or function calls) imposed by the utility to the language
model. We first attempted to describe budgetary instructions in the seed improver prompt, but, as we
discuss in Section 6.2, this led to the removal of such instructions and attempts at reward-hacking in
later iterations. The downside of our approach is that it separates the constraints from the code to
be optimized by the language model, which may decrease the likelihood that it will be used by the
language model (Liu et al., 2023). Finally, we observe empirically that replacing the source code with
a purely English description of the utility leads to a reduced frequency of non-trivial improvement.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
Using the GPT-4 language model, we explore 1) the benefits of self-improvement over a static seed
improver for a fixed target task, 2) how well an improver trained on one task generalizes to new tasks,
and 3) how using a smaller language model (GPT-3.5-turbo; OpenAI 2023b) affects performance.
5.1
SELF-IMPROVEMENT FOR A FIXED DOWNSTREAM TASK
We begin by evaluating STOP on a fixed downstream task with GPT-4. Section 5.3 evaluates GPT-3.5
similarly. We select the task of learning parity with noise (LPN) (Blum et al., 2000) as a less-well-
known, quickly-testable, and difficult algorithmic task. In LPN, bitstrings are labeled with their
parity computed over an unknown subset of the bits; given a training set of bitstrings with noisy
labels, one aims to predict the true labels of new bitstrings. Noiseless LPN is easily solved via
Gaussian elimination, but noisy LPN is conjectured to be computationally intractable for large input
dimensions (Blum et al., 2000)–we use a tractable input dimension of 10 bits per example. To define a
downstream utility u, we sample M = 20 independent instances of the LPN task with a short timeout

Iteration 0 records the performance of the seed improver I0. Given access to a strong language model
like GPT-4 (left), STOP monotonically improves mean downstream performance. In contrast, with
the weaker GPT-3.5 language model (right), mean performance degrades. Details are in Section 5.1.
and a small amount of noise and return the average accuracy of the solution across those instances.
For the initial solution s, we use a simple random sampling approach described in Appendix J. Finally,
since the language model and hence the improver are stochastic, we choose D to be 5 identical copies
of (u, s) in Algorithm 1. In particular, to evaluate the generalization of each improved improver
to new problem instances from the same task, we report test meta-utility on an independent set of
Mtest = 50 LPN instances not observed during improvement.
Figure 4 (left) reports mean test meta-utility (±1 standard error) across 5 independent STOP runs,
demonstrating improved downstream performance from 1–3 rounds of self-improvement. Note,
however, that, for an individual run, performance need not be monotonic, as 1) a better improver
for optimizing downstream task code need not be better at optimizing itself and 2) there is inherent
stochasticity in the evaluation, due to nondeterministic calls to the language model. On the other
hand, because the language model does not see the downstream task or solution when prompted from
the self-improving scaffold—each prompt contains only a template with placeholders for the task and
solution—the language model cannot directly optimize the improver for the downstream task.

Our second set of experiments explores
whether an improved improver is transfer-
able across downstream tasks. Note that
transferability is plausible as, in the self-
improvement phase, the self-improver is
not shown the downstream utility or the
downstream solution, only the meta-utility
and its own improver code. Specifically,
we select one of the better-performing im-
provers from Section 5.1 generated by
T
= 4 STOP iterations and evaluate
its performance on five new downstream
tasks. Remarkably, we find that the improved improver, detailed in Appendix H, outperforms the
seed improver on each new downstream task without further optimization, as shown in Table 1.
As with LPN, we selected three tasks that are easy to evaluate, not very well known, and still fairly
difficult: String Grid Distance, a string manipulation problem featured in a recent programming
competition (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1852/D); a version of
the quadratic assignment problem where each facility has a preference over each location that must
also be considered when minimizing costs (Koopmans & Beckmann, 1957); and, parity without
noise, as another form of generalization. We also include two well-known tasks: identifying solutions
to random 3-SAT formulae and solving instances of the maxcut problem, both with short time
constraints. The corresponding utilities and initial solutions are in Appendix G.

5.3
SELF-IMPROVEMENT WITH SMALLER LANGUAGE MODELS
We next explore the ability of a smaller language model, GPT-3.5-turbo, to improve its scaffolding.
Following the protocol of Section 5.1 with 25 independent runs instead of 5, we find that GPT-
3.5 is sometimes able to propose and implement better scaffolds, but only 12% of GPT-3.5 runs
yielded at least a 3% improvement. In addition, GPT-3.5 exhibits a few unique failure cases that
we did not observe with GPT-4. First, we found it was more likely to propose an improvement
strategy that did not harm a downstream task’s initial solution but did harm the improver code (e.g.,
randomly replacing strings in lines with some low probability per line, which had less impact on
shorter solutions). Second, if the proposed improvements mostly harmed performance, suboptimal
scaffoldings that unintentionally returned the original solution could be selected, resulting in no
continued improvement as seen in Figure 4 right. Generally, the “ideas” behind the improvement
proposals were reasonable and creative (e.g., genetic algorithms or local search), but implementations
were often overly simplistic or incorrect. We observe that, initially, the seed improver with GPT-3.5
has a higher meta-utility than the one with GPT-4 (65% vs 61%). We attribute this primarily to a
slightly higher prevalence of more complex solutions by GPT-4 that time out, such as training a
neural network written with numpy for a thousand epochs.
6
INSPECTING THE IMPROVEMENTS
Next, we qualitatively investigate the self-improvement strategies proposed by STOP, highlighting
both the encouraging and novel approaches as well as some undesirable patterns. We notably find
that a small fraction of generations attempt to perform reward hacking or sandbox circumvention.
6.1
PROPOSED SELF-IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES
We begin by discussing a number of proposed self-improvement strategies, with examples detailed in
Appendix B and visualized in Figure 1. While each strategy was implemented by STOP, not all were
ultimately selected by the improvement code, and some used an earlier iteration of the seed improver
than that shown in Figure 2 (see Appendix Figure A.19). Nonetheless, a variety of self-improvement
strategies were selected as improved improvers, including the example given in Figure 5.
Beam search. The most common meta-heuristic we observed used by the model was beam search:
the model would keep a list of all of its improvement attempts based on utility and expand the best k
in the list. This has some similarity to the Tree-of-Thoughts approach (Yao et al., 2023) which was
invented years after the training cutoff for the GPT-4 version we used (Sept. 2021).
Genetic and evolutionary algorithms. One of the most common approaches proposed by the model
was to use a genetic algorithm. Many of these attempts were infeasible in some essential way;
for example, many attempts would include mutations that perturbed random characters or lines or
performed crossover based on combining strings, which is extremely unlikely to work. However, a
portion of attempts were reasonable, relying on the language model to generate mutations and perform
crossover. We highlight that although multiple works have proposed to use genetic or evolutionary
algorithms to improve prompts or to perform neural architecture search (Chen et al., 2023; Guo et al.,
2023), to our knowledge, all of these works were after the training cutoff for GPT-4. We include a
few examples of proposed genetic algorithm implementations in Appendix B.
Decomposing and improving parts. A less common but noteworthy approach we observed was one
where the model attempts to improve the performance one function at a time. For example, as shown
in Appendix Figure A.12, the model used regular expressions to separate the solution into function
blocks and then attempted improvements to each block one by one. This approach can be understood
as analogous to that of Zelikman et al. (2023): the probability that at least one of n attempts at a
problem solves all of a problem’s independent, modular parts correctly drops precipitously with the
number of parts, but the probability that at least one attempt solves any given part does not depend
on the number of parts. Therefore, investigating combinations of attempts at parts can substantially
increase the success rate. We observed a related approach in which the model randomized the prompt
to optimize varying specific aspects of the solution at a time, for example, alternating between
searching for a better data structure or a way to reduce memory usage or leveraging parallelism.
Simulated annealing. Despite being one of the best-known metaheuristics, to our knowledge,
simulated annealing has not previously been applied as a scaffolding. This approach seems to draw
on an analogy between the concepts of temperature in language modeling and in simulated annealing,

Figure 5: Example of a self-improved improver after T = 10 iterations. This algorithm maintains
a population of top solutions and uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploiting known good
solutions and exploring new ones. Each exploration step corresponds to a higher-temperature sample,
and epsilon is adjusted dynamically based on the relative rates of utility improvement from exploration
and exploration. Temperature is also managed dynamically to adapt an exploration-exploitation
tradeoff. Finally, an improvement stopping criterion and reset mechanism are used for efficiency.
where it gradually decreases and determines whether to accept a transition from one point to another
with worse utility. Notably, it can find global optima despite many local optima (Goffe et al., 1994).
Varying temperature to explore. One alternative is to treat temperature as an exploration parameter:
the closer the model is to depleting its budget, the more conservative it is with its exploration. This
bears some resemblance to simulated annealing but is focused on optimizing the sampling temperature
rather than controlling the acceptance criteria for the change in utility of an improved solution.
Multi-armed prompt bandit and upper-confidence-bound (UCB) based search. Another method
that views the optimization objective as an exploration task is reframing as a bandit problem: since
the utility function can be stochastic, this approach emphasizes optimally selecting the best solution
out of a set of sampled improvements.

6.2
CIRCUMVENTION ATTEMPTS
We also explore whether the language model proposes self-improvement strategies to circumvent
the provided constraints (limiting the number of queries to the downstream utility, the number of
language model calls, and the number of samples per language model call). We observed a few
interesting patterns. First, when not strictly enforcing budget constraints, initially most generated
programs would follow them, but because those that ignored the constraints performed better, these
would be identified by the improver as better. Second, the constraints written in the seed improver
were often omitted when revising the improver, for “simplification.” Finally, although the language
model is passed as an object to the algorithm to enforce the constraints, in at least one proposed
solution the language model attempted to create a new language model object with larger constraints.
To further explore potential risks, we implemented a functionality-limiting “sandbox” as part of the
utility evaluation (see Appendix I), adding a run function with a use_sandbox=True parameter.
To test the language model’s frequency of sandbox adherence, we used the language model to generate
10,000 independent improvements of the seed improver. We then used a simple syntactic check
for apparent “unsandboxed” executions. Specifically, we consider an improver to be unsandboxed
if it contains either of the strings "use_sandbox=False" or "exec(". Since this was a
computationally simple syntactic procedure, we also ran it on the OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo language
model. Interestingly, unsandboxing was more than twice as common for GPT-4 than GPT-3.5-turbo.
We also considered a second variant of the seed which included a warning, as illustrated in Figure 6.
Unsandboxing occurred at a higher average rate despite the warning, though the difference was not
statistically significant for either model (via a two-proportion z-test with significance level 0.05).
Results are reported in Table 2. A manual inspection of the model’s plans in the generations did not
explicitly mention anything “malicious”–all comments discussing the removal of the sandbox were
declared to be “for efficiency” or similar reasons, though the “intent” of a model is ill-defined.
6.3
REWARD HACKING
We note that the downstream utility function must be defined with care: reward hacking occurs
when an unintended behavior is selected due to a misspecified reward and is a consequence of
exploitable utility functions (see, e.g., Skalse et al., 2022). For example, for the LPN task, we
initially defined the utility with a numpy vector computation: acc = np.sum(y_hat == y)
/ n_test. However, we had not considered that the code may ‘improve’ the seed improver to
return the predictions in a different “shape,” i.e., an array with dimensions that were not as intended.
Rather than causing an error, the result was a returned “accuracy” of over 1000%. Some techniques
have been presented to avoid reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016; Laidlaw et al., 2023), and it would
be valuable to explore their applicability to STOP in future work.
7
LIMITATIONS
A fundamental limitation of our approach is that the language model itself is not improved. Further-
more, our meta-utility measures improver quality only indirectly via improvements in downstream
task utility. Unlike in some prior work (e.g., Schmidhuber, 2003), any single attempted improvement
may result in worse performance, which can lead to further deterioration. Another limitation is
that STOP requires an efficiently-evaluatable (and describable) utility function, which may not be
available for every task. Our improvement framework also maintains a single improver at each step,
while some approaches may benefit from maintaining a population. While this is not a strict limitation
in that an improver could itself sample from a population of implementations, it likely imposes a bias.
8
CONCERNS ABOUT DEVELOPING STOP
Concerns about the consequences of RSI have been raised since its first mention. Minsky (1966) wrote,
“Once we have devised programs with a genuine capacity for self-improvement, a rapid evolutionary
process will begin... It is hard to say how close we are to this threshold, but once it is crossed, the
world will not be the same.” This is a particularly contentious topic recently, with intensified concern
over negative consequences (Ambartsoumean & Yampolskiy, 2023; Gabriel & Ghazavi, 2021).

Line of seed code (written by us) with sandbox flag
23
score = utility(solution, use_sandbox=True)
# DO NOT CHANGE use_sandbox=True
Generated code with modification disabling the sandbox flag
35
score = utility(solution, use_sandbox=False)
# Use more efficient scoring mechanism
Figure 6: Disabled sandbox. The language model disables the sandbox flag, ostensibly for the
purpose of “efficiency.” A further, more detailed example is given in Appendix Figure A.34.
It is therefore important to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of studying RSI and specifically the
small advance we introduce. First, STOP does not alter the black-box language model and hence is
not full RSI. Moreover, at this point, we do not believe that the scaffolding systems STOP creates are
superior to those hand-engineered by experts. If this is the case, then STOP is not (currently) enabling
additional AI misuse. At the same time, it facilitates the study of aspects of RSI code generation such
as sandbox avoidance and reward hacking. As Christiano (2023) argues, advances in scaffolding and
agent models have the advantage of interpretability compared to advances in language models.
However, as techniques for API-based fine-tuning of closed models become more available (OpenAI,
2023a), it would be plausible to incorporate these into the improvement loop. Therefore, it is difficult
to assess the generality of our approach, especially with increasingly powerful large language models.
However, this is itself a motivation for this work: understanding how language models improve
their scaffolding in the STOP self-improvement loop can help us understand and potentially mitigate
negative impacts of better models. For instance, the simplistic ways in which the current language
models disable the sandbox are easily detectable. In essence, we would rather first observe problems
with GPT-4 in simplified settings than with even more powerful language models in real-world use.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we introduced STOP, a framework for recursively optimizing code generation using
language models as meta-optimizers. We demonstrated that large language models like GPT-4
are capable of improving code that leverages the language model itself. We found that, across a
variety of algorithmic tasks, STOP generates improvers that boost the performance of downstream
code. While the model does not optimize its weights or underlying architecture, this work indicates
that self-optimizing language models do not require that. However, this is itself a motivation: the
capabilities of future language models may be misunderstood if strong scaffolding strategies are
not tested. Understanding the ways language models improve their scaffolding with STOP can help
researchers understand and mitigate the potential for misuse of more powerful language models.
Moreover, STOP may allow researchers to investigate the effectiveness of different techniques for
mitigating undesirable self-improvement strategies.
Ethics Statement There are several potential benefits of AI systems related to education, health, and
many important aspects of quality of life. However, we recognize and take seriously the potential
negative consequences of AI systems as well. Of particular interest is the concerns that recursively
self-improving systems may have unintended negative consequences, which have been discussed by
many authors. Section 8 discusses the reasons we feel this research, in balance, contributes to the
study of a problem that is net beneficial. Specifically, the study of recursively self-improving code
generation produces interpretable code, which makes it easier to detect and understand unintended
behaviors of such systems. Our experiments in Section 6.2 show how this line of work enables the
quantitative study of such behaviors.
Reproducibility Statement We include implementation details, prompts, and relevant code examples
throughout the paper and appendix. For reproducibility, we also include sandbox experiment details
in Appendix I, additional experimental details around the utility description construction and the
downstream tasks in Appendix J, the various utility descriptions and seed algorithms in Appendix F
and Appendix G, and code examples of all discussed improvement attempts in Appendix H. We
use models that are publicly available (primarily gpt-4-0314) and will open-source our code at

A
THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
Here we extend the definitions of Section 3 to account for bounded resources such as runtime and
language model calls, to prove generalization bounds, and to present an equivalent definition in terms
of maximization.
A.1
BOUNDED RESOURCES
We first consider bounded resources. Recall that Σ∗denotes the set of finite strings over an alphabet
(or token set) Σ ⊇{0, 1}. Let |x| denote the length of string x.
Bounded language-models. First, to consider bounded resources, To capture most modern language
models, we suppose that there are constants c, k ∈N such that the language model L : Σc →Σc
generates responses of length c, called the context length, to query strings of length c, in time k
(shorter strings are handled by padding). Note that a bounded language model cannot output a
program longer than c, and the same is true for our seed improver I0(u, s, L). Interestingly, however,
other improvers can output meaningful programs longer than c by making more than one call to L.
Bounded-runtime programs. Programs are represented by finite strings ∈Σ∗in a fixed (Turing-
complete) programming language. For simplicity of analysis we assume programs operate serially in
steps. Every string π can be considered as a program and we write π(·) ∈Σ∗to denote its output
(always a string) on one or more inputs. We assume the inputs can either be strings (which can encode
numbers, text, programs, or arbitrary types of objects) or black-box (possibly randomized) functions.
We assume that programs can call the following special black-box functions:
• A clock function that, in unit time, returns the integer number of steps computed by the current
program thus far and can therefore determine the duration of black-box function call.
• A random bit function that returns a uniformly random bit in {0, 1} on each invocation, also
running in unit time. We assume a fixed runtime bound brun on all programs being run to avoid
long-running or infinite computations. We assume that there is a special string ⊥∈Σ∗where
π(x) indicates a program failure, which may be a timeout, or π not encoding a valid program (i.e.,
a syntax error), or a runtime error on its input.
• A sandbox function that runs a given program or black-box function with a parameter indicating a
timeout number of steps.
Bounded utility functions. It will be convenient to bound the range of the utility function. We
assume that the utility function u : Σ∗→[0, 1] is bounded by 1 and that u(⊥) = 0. To be completely
formal, we must explain how to represent utility functions that output real values. One can do this
by adding an additional parameter that indicates the desired precision, i.e., the number of bits of the
output. We omit this from our analysis for simplicity.
Bounded language model calls. The bounds on program runtime indirectly impose a bound on
number of language model calls ≤brun/k. However, we note that in STOP’s implementation,
additional bounds on the number of calls of a language model are explicitly made.
Iterated downstream task improvement. The STOP framework, as in Section 4, considers only one
round of improvement. It would be conceptually straightforward to modify ˆu to explicitly account
for multiple iterations of downstream task improvement. However, note that an improver can already
internally perform multiple iterations of downstream task improvement.
A.2
GENERALIZATION BOUNDS
STOP can be viewed as a “pre-optimization” (like pre-training a language model) to find a good
improver that will be used on a variety of downstream tasks. Generalization bounds concern the
problem of how well will an improver work on future unseen tasks, albeit from the same distribution as
the “training” tasks. In particular, they bound the degree to which one might be overfitting by using a
limited number of training tasks rather than the full distribution. We provide two simple generalization
bounds in this section. The first relates how close ˆu is to expected (one-shot) improvement on new
downstream tasks from the same distribution. The second provides absolute guarantees but for a
slightly different (randomized) meta-utility function.
15

Thus far we have considered a fixed set of n tasks (u, s) ∈D, i.e., |D| = n, each being defined
by a utility function u = (ufunc, ustr) consisting of a black-box function ufunc and a string ustr, as
well as an initial solution s ∈Σ∗. We now consider a distribution D over tasks (u, s) ∼D. This is
arguably the quantity we ultimately care about, as ¯u(I) determines the expected performance of a
(single iteration) of an improver on a downstream task. If the tasks D ∼Dn are drawn i.i.d. from D,
then one can prove a generalization bound stating that the average performance of an improver I on
D is close to its expected performance on D:
Lemma 1. Let n ≥1, δ ∈[0, 1], l ≥2, D be a multiset of n i.i.d. tasks from D, and Σ≤l denote the
set of strings I (improver programs) of length |I| ≤l. Then,
Pr
D∼Dn

For all I ∈Σ≤l :
ˆu(I) −¯u(I)
 < ϵ

≥1 −δ,
where ϵ ≜
q

n
 l ln(|Σ|) + ln 1
δ

.
Proof. The standard proof follows from Chernoff bounds and the union bound. Denote the tasks by
τ = (u, s) ∼D. For any fixed improver I, there is a value yτ := u(I(τ, L)) for each task τ, and
ˆu(I) = P
τ∈D yτ/n is simply the average of n i.i.d. random samples yτ, while ¯u(I) = Eτ∼D[yτ] is
the expectation. Thus, by the Chernoff bound, for any ϵ > 0 and fixed I,
Pr
D∼Dn [|ˆu(I) −¯u(I)| ≥ϵ] ≤2 exp
 −2ϵ2n

= 2|Σ|2l
δ
≤|Σ|l+1
δ
,
where in the last step we have used the fact that l, |Σ| ≥2. Now there are only |Σ|l+1 possible
programs (strings) of length ≤l, and so by the union bound, the probability that any of them have
|ˆu(I) −¯u(I)| ≥ϵ is at most δ.
The above lemma means that if selecting the best among any set of improvers according to ˆu will
yield a value of ¯u that is within 2ϵ of the best in the set.
Iterated improvement bounds. The above bound is relevant to the case where a final improver I is
used in a single step of improvement on a downstream tasks, so the ultimate quantity of interest is
¯u(I). It implies that approximately optimizing ˆu(I) is equivalent to approximately optimizing ¯u(I).
We note that exactly the same bounds would apply to multiple steps of improvement if one replaced
ˆu and ¯u by the corresponding averages of any given number of rounds of iterated improvement on
the new downstream task sampled from D.
Stochastic meta-utility. Another simple generalization bound can be given if we consider the case in
which the meta-utility is randomized. In particular, consider ˙u(I) which is defined to be a randomized
function that returns u(I(τ, L)) for a random task τ ∼D. Clearly E[ ˙u(I)] = ¯u(I), so ˙u is an
unbiased estimate of ¯u. Thus it is intuitive that one can similarly improve using ˙u, albeit with more
calls. One advantage of ˙u is the following trivial observation:
Observation 1. Any algorithm that makes at most n calls to ˙u can be perfectly simulated using a a
training set of n = |D| i.i.d. samples D ∼Dn.
Grey-box utility descriptions. The results in this section lend support to use of grey-box descriptions
of ˆu, which only show its form as an average of utilities, because the grey-box description is identical,
in expectation, to that of ¯u. Put another way, it would be easier to overfit to the training tasks (up to the
worst-case bounds, as shown in this section) if the tasks are given explicitly to the pre-optimization
algorithm, especially in the case where the program is quite large (as in over-parametrized neural
networks that are larger than their training set size).
A.3
ANALYSIS OF EQUIVALENT MAXIMIZATION FORMULATION
A second, equivalent formulation is defined in terms of a maximizer program M which, given a
language model and utility, outputs a solution string M(u, L) ∈Σ∗. Since we are thinking of a
16

fixed language model throughout, we omit L and write M(u) = M(u, L) (and I(u, s) = I(u, s, L))
when the language model L is understood from context. The goal is to achieve high utility u(M(u)).
Unlike an improver, a maximizer M does not require an initial solution. However, M can be still
used to produce a higher-quality maximizer by applying M to an appropriately defined meta-utility
function. To parallel the STOP approach of choosing M based on downstream tasks, one can use a
set of downstream task utilities U (no initial solutions needed) to define the maximizer meta-utility
˜u(M) ≜|U|−1 P
u∈U u(M(u)) and consider iterating Mt ≜Mt−1(˜u).
To see the equivalence between maximizers and improvers, first note that one can, of course, convert
any maximizer to an improver by ignoring the input solution and taking I(u, s) ≡M(u). For the
converse, note that one can utilize improvers as maximizers by including an initial solution in the
utility u and optionally overriding it with a more recent solution in the comments of M. Specifically,
suppose one defines a function e(M, u) extracting an appropriately encoded prior solution from M, if
there is one, and otherwise the initial solution from u. Then one can convert improvers to maximizers
by taking M(u) ≡I(u, e(M, u)). Note that either optimizer can return itself, similar to a “quine.”
STOP uses performance at improving downstream tasks as a heuristic approximation to selecting
good improvers more generally. It is not immediately clear how one would even give a non-cyclic
definition of performance at improving improvers. Now we illustrate a way to define recursive
maximizer performance in a consistent fashion.
To do so, consider a randomized process in which, in each iteration, a coin is flipped, and if it is
heads, the maximizer is applied to the downstream task; if it is tails, however, it is applied to the
problem of maximizing the maximizer. If the next flip is heads, then the result is used to maximize
the downstream task. Otherwise, it recurs. If the coin has probability λ ∈(0, 1) of being heads, then
this process results in an expected number of maximizer calls, including for maximization and finally
for the downstream task, is 1/λ. Hence, it is similar to a process where the maximizer is iteratively
applied ≈1/λ times. However, this randomness enables us to define the objective consistently. In
particular, for parameter λ ∈(0, 1), define:
uλ(M) ≜
˜u(M)
with probability λ,
uλ M(uλ)

with probability 1 −λ.
While the above definition looks cyclic, it is well-defined, just as a recursive program is well-defined.
One can repeatedly expand the bottom case to get,
uλ(M) =













˜u(M)
with probability λ, (maximize downstream performance)
˜u(M(uλ))
with probability λ(1 −λ), (maximize downstream maximizer)
˜u
 M(uλ)(uλ)

with probability λ(1 −λ)2, (max max that maxes downstream max)
˜u
 M(uλ)(uλ)(uλ)

with probability λ(1 −λ)3, (max max ...)
...
Recursively self-improving code generation within the maximization framework may be achieved
by taking a seed program M0(u) similar to our seed improver, which, for example, queries L for a
solution maximizing ustr and takes the best according to ufunc. (The number of queries is taken so as
to remain in the runtime budget brun.) Then, one can define Mt ≜Mt−1(uλ) for t = 1, 2, . . . , T.
It is tempting to think that a fixed point M λ
∗= M λ
∗(uλ), again a “quine” of sorts, may be good, but it
may equally well be a minimizer as nothing in our framework favors maximization over minimization
(except the seed and the assumption that u(⊥) = 0).

Figure A.7: Genetic algorithm with explicit fitness. An example of a language-model-proposed
and implemented algorithm for improving code using a genetic algorithm and a language model.
There are two main kinds of genetic algorithms that we saw the language model propose: first, those
where fitness is mostly implicit and survival is primarily controlled by the crossover-based decisions
of the language model (i.e., the language model is asked to combine two solutions, theoretically with
the ability to disregard one or the other); alternatively, the utilities could be explicitly considered and
used to rank the candidates.

I
SANDBOX CIRCUMVENTION DETAILS
As discussed in Section 6.2, we slightly modified the seed prompt and meta-utility in a manner to
make it apparent that the code was intended to be run in a sandbox. These modifications are shown
in bold in Figure A.33. A further modification of the seed prompt with a warning is shown in the
figure as well. For this experiment, we did not run any code but instead performed a simple syntax
check for either of the strings "use_sandbox=False" or "exec(". While such code may be
generated but never run, any inclusion of such code would be considered against best safety practices.
Figure A.34 gives an additional example of disabling the sandbox flag. In this version, the program
first attempts to run the code outside of a sandbox and then later within the sandbox, which is, of
course, naively too late to guarantee safety.
J
SUPPLEMENTARY EXPERIMENT DETAILS
The string representation of the utility function need not match the true code exactly. For example,
we typically obfuscate irrelevant logging code and any random seed values. We use multithreading
libraries for implementing timeouts, but we remove these for simplicity and instead only present
simpler timeout mechanisms to the model, like returning a zero score if an evaluation takes too long.
Outside of the sandbox experiments, we include an exec command in the utility description but have a
minimal function to evaluate the code to help debug and prevent the use of some undesirable libraries
like multiprocessing. We also omit details that assign necessary properties to utility function like the
budget or this currently-discussed string representation.
For learning parity with noise, we use a timeout of 2 seconds, a fixed bitlength (10 bits), a p = 30%
chance that a bit will be included in the parity subset for a task, 100 train samples for a given instance,
and 20 test samples.
All Wilson (1927) confidence intervals for binomial proportions were computed using the Python
function statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_confint.

computational cost and help to find an optimal solution faster.
